{"id": "14573", "revid": "49848256", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=14573", "title": "Recipe", "text": "A recipe, sometimes also referred to as a blueprint, refers to an action in which the player is capable of using a set of required &lt;a href=\"ingredient\"&gt;ingredient&lt;/a&gt;s (also known as &lt;a href=\"reagent\"&gt;reagent&lt;/a&gt;s or materials) to make or produce an &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"enchantment\"&gt;enchantment&lt;/a&gt;, or in rare cases perform what can be considered a spell. Different types of recipes composes different crafting-&lt;a href=\"profession\"&gt;profession&lt;/a&gt;s.\nIt is often important to differ between whether a recipe is in item-form, or in spell-form, although they are highly related.\nRecipes as items.\nA recipe in form of an item is similar to what a recipe would look like in real life - it is simply an item which is capable of teaching the player how to make something. It does this by teaching the player the recipe in spell form. As such, recipes in the form of items will often be considered the \"source\" of a recipe rather than the recipe itself. Unlike real-life recipes however, a recipe in World of Warcraft will disappear when a player has \"read\" it. Notice that the expression \"recipe as item\" used here is not to be confused with the item the recipe (as a spell) has the ability to create (given it creates an item).\nHowever, not every player may learn every recipe. As a player is limited to know two primary professions, in addition to all the secondary professions, a recipe-item is only available to him/her if the following conditions are met:\nHaving all kinds of sources, recipes may be found all over the world. A recipe may typically be obtained in one of these four ways:\nIn some cases a recipe may have more than one source. Notice that many high-level and/or powerful recipes are &lt;a href=\"BoP\"&gt;BoP&lt;/a&gt;.\nRarely, a recipe will not teach the player how to make an item, but instead a new &lt;a href=\"Profession%23Proficiency_levels\"&gt;proficiency level&lt;/a&gt; (aka \"skill levels\"). This type of recipe is however hardly ever used as they were made obsolete in &lt;a href=\"3.1.0\"&gt;patch 3.1.0&lt;/a&gt;.\nRecipe names and icons.\nAs seen below in the next section, recipe-items are often named in a specific manner depending on which profession they are used in. The two exceptions are Alchemy and Cooking, in which a recipe is just referred to as a \"recipe\". In addition to naming, recipe-items are also often depicted in a similar manner. One type of recipe-items are usually having scrolls as icons, while another type may use paper sheets instead. \nAlthough an important feature in professions, recipe names will usually (possibly only) be used when dealing with recipes in item-form. For example, when a player uses a and learns how to create origami rocks, the ability to do so will not in any way (by the system) be mentioned as a \"technique\". This includes linking (see &lt;a href=\"Recipe%23Linking\"&gt;below&lt;/a&gt;). The same goes for the recipe-item icon.\nIt is however common to see recipe names either being used in a broader or narrower manner than the game uses them. An example of the former is how the Wowpedia article about &lt;a href=\"engineering%20recipes\"&gt;engineering recipes&lt;/a&gt; describe all those recipes as \"schematics\", although just a handful of them are learned from recipe-items. An example of the latter is how players often refer to any kind of recipe as a \"recipe\", whether it is a technique, schematic, etc. A third example, which can be considered both broader and narrower at the same time, is that recipe names are, to an extent, interchangeable. It is not uncommon to see people referring to ANY recipe, be it jewelcrafting, alchemy, etc, as a \"pattern\", \"plans\", or \"design\".\nRarity of different recipe items.\nRecipes often come in different colors (both icon and name), depending on their rarity. Although the system differs between different professions, a common rule is that recipe-items in white are \"common\" recipes that usually are bought from vendors, while any other colors are more uncommon recipes dropped by monsters or obtained from quests. Generally, the color of a recipe-item reflects the quality of the crafted item, and if the item is either unusual or powerful for its level, the recipe-item is often hard to obtain. \nThere are however several exceptions; some white Cooking recipe-items may for example be considered somewhat rare even though they are bought for less than a gold from easily accessible vendors, or are rewards from simple low-level quests. This is because many Cooking recipe-items are only obtainable by players playing as a Horde-character and vice versa, thus only allowing the opposite faction to learn the recipe by selling it the recipe-item in the neutral &lt;a href=\"auction%20house\"&gt;auction house&lt;/a&gt;. Another phenomenon is rare recipe-items often selling for quite the price between players even though the crafted item may be next to useless; this is because many players devoted to their profession seek to complete it as much as possible, even with useless items. Before selling a recipe-item, players therefore should always check the market to see what people are willing to pay.\nRecipes as spells.\nA recipe in spell form allows you to craft the item it describes, given you have the required ingredients. One may consider it the knowledge a person possesses to create something. Recipes in this form may be browsed in the profession-window, given the profession has one / is able to use recipes. &lt;a href=\"Skinning\"&gt;Skinning&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Herbalism\"&gt;Herbalism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fishing\"&gt;Fishing&lt;/a&gt; (despite the &lt;a href=\"Weather-Beaten%20Journal\"&gt;Weather-Beaten Journal&lt;/a&gt;) do not have profession windows. &lt;a href=\"Archaeology\"&gt;Archaeology&lt;/a&gt; does, but due to its high difference from a \"normal\" crafting-profession it can be discussed whether it produces items through \"recipes\".\nWhile recipes in a profession are used to craft useful items, it is also used to improve a profession by yielding &lt;a href=\"skillup\"&gt;skillup&lt;/a&gt;s (aka \"skill points\"). This is done by crafting items which are considered more or less advanced for your skill in a profession. To put it simply, in order to become better in a profession, you improve your skills by crafting more and more powerful items, which are taught by recipes. A higher skill in a profession will then allow the player to learn more powerful recipes. The \"potential\" (aka \"difficulty\") of a recipe to grant one (or in rare cases, several) skillups follows the color code below:\nMost recipes start at orange (given they are learned as soon as they are available) and eventually turn yellow, green, and gray. As such, players are forced into learning new recipes one way or another to further improve their professions. Other recipes may begin at green or yellow, or even gray (meaning the recipe doesn't have any skillup-potential at all). You can check the skillup-potential of a recipe on a WoW-database such as &lt;a href=\"Wowhead\"&gt;Wowhead&lt;/a&gt;, as seen &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wowhead.com/skill%3D164%23recipes\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; (to the right) and &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wowhead.com/spell%3D29569\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; (top right) . For example, 385 425 437 450 means that the recipe can be learned at skill 385, at which it is orange, becomes yellow at 425, green at 437, and gray at 450. Having knowledge of recipes' skillup-potentials, as well as choosing recipes requiring cheap materials, is an important part of economic profession-&lt;a href=\"power%20leveling\"&gt;power leveling&lt;/a&gt; (if the profession uses recipes, of course).\nRecipes \"directly\" taught as spells.\nNotably, only a portion of the recipe-spells a player knows is taught by recipe-items, meaning that the other recipes have other \"sources\". Many of these recipes are also taught by &lt;a href=\"profession%20trainer\"&gt;profession trainer&lt;/a&gt;s. These can be found all over the game, in every &lt;a href=\"capital%20city\"&gt;capital city&lt;/a&gt; and often in small villages as well. \nRecipes taught by trainers follow much the same conditions as recipes taught by recipe-items do:\nA few recipes are taught from other sources as well. These sources are:\nEven if a NPC which teaches you a recipe is not a \"real\" profession trainer (possibly just a quest giver), it can still be considered a trainer.\nCategorizing, filtering and searching.\nRecipes known as spells are automatically and conveniently categorized in a number of different sections. It is furthermore easy to search for and browse in known recipes by using the different filters or having the profession search for items with matching letters and names. The categories and types of filters differ between professions.\nLinking.\nIt is also possible to link a recipe as a spell in chat. This is done by opening a chat command line, shift-clicking the recipe in your profession window (which causes the recipe to create a link) and then posting the message normally.\nRecipes from recipes.\nIn a few special cases, performing a recipe (as in making an item, not learning it) has a chance of teaching the player another recipe in the same profession. This may be considered a third method to gain new recipes, but only exists in a few professions. Recipes learned like this are not \"revealed\" before you know them; you won't know what you'll learn (or even if you will learn anything at all) before the moment you do so. This way of learning recipes is referred to as \"discovery\".\nInscription.\nInscription uses \"researches\" to learn new recipes. When you \"craft\" any of them, you will learn how to make a new type of &lt;a href=\"glyph\"&gt;glyph&lt;/a&gt;. Notably, both have a &lt;a href=\"cooldown\"&gt;cooldown&lt;/a&gt; which resets every day, meaning each can only be performed once each day. This is to prevent players from learning everything at once.\nAlchemy.\nAlchemy uses two kinds of \"discovery\", one in which the player creates different items and another where the player performs a research.\nRecipe-spell counting macro.\nBelow is a &lt;a href=\"macro\"&gt;macro&lt;/a&gt; which can be used to quickly tell you the number of recipes you know in a profession. In order to \"adjust\" it to the profession you want to check, replace the word PROFESSION with the name of the profession, such as engineering. Then, execute the macro. The result will be displayed in your chat window.\n /run CastSpellByName(\"PROFESSION\")local c,n,t=0 for i=1,GetNumTradeSkills()do n,t=GetTradeSkillInfo(i)if t~=\"header\" then c=c+1 end end print(c..\" recipes known!\")\nThe macro works by counting the \"available\" recipes listed, which means it is affected by filters. If you for example have materials in your inventory which can be used to create 5 different recipes, turn on the filter for \"have materials\" and then execute this macro, it will calculate that you know 5 recipes.\nIt sometimes gives you an incorrect number if you run it without having the profession's window displayed, possible due to the counting finishing faster than the list of recipes can load. As such, it's better to open the profession window and \"then\" run the macro in order to receive an accurate calculation.\nThe macro can also be used to calculate the number of recipes in a profession known by another player in your &lt;a href=\"guild\"&gt;guild&lt;/a&gt;. In order to see a guild member's profession window, open your guild roster, filter after professions, select the specific profession and then select the player."}

At the Speaker's direction, the Honorbound carried out missions of subterfuge, reconnaissance, assassination, and other focused strikes against the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Garona%20Halforcen\"&gt;Garona Halforcen&lt;/a&gt; recruited reinforcements for the war effort.\nAs apart of their mission, the Honorbound sought to established footholds within Kul Tiras, though the exact order of their formation is unknown. &lt;a href=\"Trade%20Prince\"&gt;Trade Prince&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jastor%20Gallywix\"&gt;Gallywix&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eitrigg\"&gt;Eitrigg&lt;/a&gt;, and the Speaker established the &lt;a href=\"Krazzlefrazz%20Outpost\"&gt;Krazzlefrazz Outpost&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=\"Drustvar\"&gt;Drustvar&lt;/a&gt; Meanwhile, &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Hunter%20Ty%27jin\"&gt;Shadow Hunter Ty'jin&lt;/a&gt;, seeking a base within &lt;a href=\"Tiragarde%20Sound\"&gt;Tiragarde Sound&lt;/a&gt;, struck a bargain with &lt;a href=\"Owings\"&gt;First Mate Owings&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Fogsail%20Freebooters\"&gt;Fogsail Freebooters&lt;/a&gt;, in which she would allow the Horde the use of &lt;a href=\"Plunder%20Harbor\"&gt;Plunder Harbor&lt;/a&gt; in exchange for their aid with her coup against &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Rhenik\"&gt;Captain Rhenik&lt;/a&gt;. Thus when she launched her coup the Honorbound aided the mutineers, enabling the death of Rhenik, where soon after Plunder Harbor was officially made a foothold of the Horde.\nAfter the Honorbound established and fortified &lt;a href=\"Warfang%20Hold\"&gt;Warfang Hold&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormsong%20Valley\"&gt;Stormsong Valley&lt;/a&gt;, they came under attack by the Kul Tiran forces. The attack forced them to the shore and sunk their ships, leaving the Honorbound forces with nowhere to run and nowhere to tide. However, they were saved by the timely intervention of &lt;a href=\"High%20Warlord%20Cromush\"&gt;High Warlord Cromush&lt;/a&gt; and the Speaker of the Horde, who manned a cannon against the Kul Tirans on the coast which gave the troops some breathing room. The Speaker then united with &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Centurion%20Kaga%20Warmstone\"&gt;Centurion Kaga Warmstone&lt;/a&gt; in putting out the flames within the hold and fighting against the Kul Tiran forces within, culminating in the death of &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Ara\"&gt;Captain Ara&lt;/a&gt;. With their enemies dead the Speaker sounded the &lt;a href=\"Warhorn%20of%20the%20Hold\"&gt;Warhorn of the Hold&lt;/a&gt;, which rallied the troops and allowed the Horde to secure Warfang Hold.\nWith the footholds secured, &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller\"&gt;Nathanos Blightcaller&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the Honorbound forces, turned to combating the Alliance, while the Speaker directed them with claiming &lt;a href=\"Swiftwind%20Post\"&gt;Swiftwind Post&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wolf%27s%20Den\"&gt;Wolf's Den&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Windfall%20Cavern\"&gt;Windfall Cavern&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stonefist%20Watch\"&gt;Stonefist Watch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hillcrest%20Pasture\"&gt;Hillcrest Pasture&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stonetusk%20Watch\"&gt;Stonetusk Watch&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Mudfisher%20Cove\"&gt;Mudfisher Cove&lt;/a&gt; as Horde outposts.\nSeeking the corpse of &lt;a href=\"Marshal%20M.%20Valentine\"&gt;Marshal M. Valentine&lt;/a&gt;, Nathanos directed the Honorbound with sailing towards the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt;. As the Speaker searched the sea for Valentine's corpse, the Honorbound came under attack by the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. However, Nathanos and his forces were able to beat back the Alliance and the Speaker returned to the \"&lt;a href=\"Banshee%27s%20Wail\"&gt;Banshee's Wail&lt;/a&gt;\" with the corpses of Valentine and &lt;a href=\"Derek%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Derek Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;. Derek's corpse was soon used as bait to lure away Kul Tiran forces from &lt;a href=\"Boralus\"&gt;Boralus&lt;/a&gt; so that the Speaker and &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Zelling\"&gt;Thomas Zelling&lt;/a&gt; could claim the &lt;a href=\"%3AAbyssal%20Scepter\"&gt;:Abyssal Scepter&lt;/a&gt;. As they carried this mission, the Honorbound clashed with the Kul Tirans attacking Plunder Harbor. After the Abyssal Scepter was claimed by the Horde, Nathanos used it to destroy the Kul Tiran fleet, securing victory for the Honorbound.\nTides of Vengeance.\nAs part of the renewed war effort the Honorbound launched an assault against the &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt; supply that was in the possession of Kul Tiras and the Alliance at &lt;a href=\"Norwington%20Estate\"&gt;Norwington Estate&lt;/a&gt;. After claiming the Azerite, they withdrew from the manor. As the war against the Alliance &lt;a href=\"Faction%20Assaults\"&gt;intensified&lt;/a&gt;, the Honorbound under the command of High Warlord Cromush defended &lt;a href=\"Faction%20Assault%20on%20Vol%27dun\"&gt;Vol'dun&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Faction%20Assault%20on%20Nazmir\"&gt;Nazmir&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Faction%20Assault%20on%20Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt; and struck out against Alliance forces within &lt;a href=\"Faction%20Assault%20on%20Drustvar\"&gt;Drustvar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Faction%20Assault%20on%20Tiragarde%20Sound\"&gt;Tiragarde Sound&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Faction%20Assault%20on%20Stormsong%20Valley\"&gt;Stormsong Valley&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter receiving word that the Alliance had mounted an attack through &lt;a href=\"Nazmir\"&gt;Nazmir&lt;/a&gt;, the Honorbound joined the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Empire\"&gt;Zandalari Empire&lt;/a&gt; in battle against their enemies in the region. Following the death of &lt;a href=\"Blademaster%20Telaamon\"&gt;Blademaster Telaamon&lt;/a&gt; and the destruction of the Abyssal Scepter, the Honorbound discovered that Telaamon and his forces were a bait to lure them away from &lt;a href=\"Dazar%27alor\"&gt;Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt; in order to weaken the city's defenses. Realizing that the city was in danger, the combined Zandalari and Horde army rushed back to defend the city.\nAfter being informed that the \"&lt;a href=\"the%20Swift%20Vengeance\"&gt;the Swift Vengeance&lt;/a&gt;\" had been taken by &lt;a href=\"Irontide%20Raiders\"&gt;Irontide&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"pirate\"&gt;pirate&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Chandlery%20Wharf\"&gt;Chandlery Wharf&lt;/a&gt;, Nathanos declared they would be sent to search the area for the stolen ship. However, in reality &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; and Thomas Zelling had rescued the raised Derek Proudmoore from being turned into a weapon for Sylvanas and had set up the pirates to hide their actions from her. Unbeknownst to them, Sylvanas had discovered their actions and called for the leaders of the Horde to gather at Warfang Hold, which Baine suspected was a show of force. The Honorbound served as a guard for the subsequent meeting that ended with Zelling's death and Baine's arrest at Slyvanas's command.\nRise of Azshara.\nThe Honorbound were among the Horde forces that joined the fleet under the command of &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller\"&gt;Nathanos Blightcaller&lt;/a&gt;, who used the &lt;a href=\"Xal%27atath\"&gt;black blade&lt;/a&gt; to guide the Horde fleet and the pursuing Alliance fleet towards &lt;a href=\"Nazjatar\"&gt;Nazjatar&lt;/a&gt; where both would be attacked by the naga under &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt;'s command after the seas opened. While &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Holgresh\"&gt;Captain Holgresh&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Veteran%20Crew\"&gt;Veteran Crew&lt;/a&gt;s lost their lives as a result, others members of the Honorbound like &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Dawnsail\"&gt;Captain Dawnsail&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Jalazko\"&gt;Captain Jalazko&lt;/a&gt; were discovered alive. It is presumed that other possible survivors rallied to &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"First%20Arcanist%20Thalyssra\"&gt;First Arcanist Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Unshackled\"&gt;Unshackled&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Newhome\"&gt;Newhome&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the Horde split between &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; revolutionaries and the loyalists of Sylvanas Windrunner, Nathanos rallied to Sylvanas's side. However, the Honorbound as an organization stood out from the conflict, which ended with Saurfang's death and Sylvanas's abandonment of the Horde. With Nathanos remaining &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20loyalists\"&gt;loyal&lt;/a&gt; to the Banshee Queen, the Honorbound became leaderless.\nVisions of N'Zoth.\nIn the aftermath of &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;'s death and the end of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the Horde and Alliance entered into an armistice with one another, putting the Fourth War on hold indefinitely, if not permanently. The exact status of the Honorbound as result of the armistice is unknown, with it possibly being reassigned or disbanded."}

Regular patrols are sent out, and a number of small orcish encampments have been established nearby to further strengthen the Horde's control over the region. It is one of the few orcish communities to still have a &lt;a href=\"great%20hall\"&gt;great hall&lt;/a&gt; in its midst and is protected by two &lt;a href=\"burrow\"&gt;burrow&lt;/a&gt;s. Several trainers and vendors can be found at the post. &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;Mage&lt;/a&gt;s with sufficient skill can learn to &lt;a href=\"teleport\"&gt;teleport&lt;/a&gt; or open a &lt;a href=\"Portal%20%28spell%29\"&gt;portal&lt;/a&gt; to here.\nPreviously, Stonard was notable for being the location of the horde master &lt;a href=\"Alchemy\"&gt;alchemist&lt;/a&gt; and the only Horde &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; trainer in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nFirst and Second Wars.\nThe town was originally established by the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt; as an outpost in the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Morass\"&gt;Black Morass&lt;/a&gt; after the first opening of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;. It is one of the oldest &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;ish settlements of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, along with the fortress formerly known as &lt;a href=\"Rockard\"&gt;Rockard&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, Stonard was probably destroyed or abandoned but has since been re-established as an outpost with the formation of the new &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and the orcs' renewed interest in the area. Although Stonard was reconstructed, Rockard was taken over by the &lt;a href=\"Dreadmaul\"&gt;Dreadmaul&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s who renamed it as &lt;a href=\"Dreadmaul%20Hold\"&gt;Dreadmaul Hold&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nStonard is a center of operations for adventurers who seek to enter the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Atal%27Hakkar\"&gt;Temple of Atal'Hakkar&lt;/a&gt;, and one of the closest Horde outposts to the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, which is located in &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt; to the south. Until the retaking of Dreadmaul Hold, it was the only Horde outpost in the nearby regions.\nThe swamp was still largely an uncharted territory to the orcs, who were sending &lt;a href=\"Stonard%20Wayfinder\"&gt;wayfinders&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stonard%20Cartographer\"&gt;cartographers&lt;/a&gt; to map the region.\nCataclysm.\nDue to its location near the vulnerable Alliance territories of &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Elwynn%20Forest\"&gt;Elwynn Forest&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Duskwood\"&gt;Duskwood&lt;/a&gt;, Stonard has recently become the target of a renewed Alliance war effort. In opposition to Stonard, &lt;a href=\"Marshtide%20Watch\"&gt;Marshtide Watch&lt;/a&gt; was built on the edge of the &lt;a href=\"Pool%20of%20Tears\"&gt;Pool of Tears&lt;/a&gt; to the northeast. As a result, assaults against Stonard by the Alliance are now a common occurrence, with the main field of battle being the &lt;a href=\"Bloodmire\"&gt;Bloodmire&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn Warcraft: Orcs &amp; Humans.\nIn the of \"Warcraft: Orcs &amp; Humans\", Stonard and Rockard are mentioned as the last defense of the Horde before &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt; and both were destroyed at the end of the campaign. Since the last stages of the human campaign are not canon, both survived the war.\nIn the RPG.\nThis southern town lies just off the &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20of%20Sorrows\"&gt;Swamp of Sorrows&lt;/a&gt;' only road. Formerly used as an &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; stronghold during the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Wars\"&gt;wars&lt;/a&gt;, now it functions as a &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; outpost. While populated mostly by orc &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s, some do follow their calling as &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;s.\nIt is protected by 8-foot walls, and sentries watch every gate. Although there is little traffic through the swamps, the orcs must guard against &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; attacks. They send &lt;a href=\"caravan\"&gt;caravan&lt;/a&gt;s to their allies in &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt; to trade for supplies twice a year, though the town does boast several weaponsmiths who create beautiful weapons with the ore they trade for.\nThe orcs are, if not friendly, certainly not the evil orcs that fought in the wars. There might actually be something to the claims that the Horde and the Alliance are at truce in the west."}

It is a &lt;a href=\"council%20encounter\"&gt;council encounter&lt;/a&gt; with three targets on 10-man and four targets on 25-man.\nBackground.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"The first line of defense against those daring to enter the vaults is a stolid row of enchanted, bestial statues. Hard as granite and ceaseless in their vigil, the sentries of the Stone Guard present an insurmountable wall of flame, fangs, and claws.\"\nSpells and Abilities.\nEach guardian gains energy when it is within 12 yards of another guardian. This energy can be used to cast its colored Overload. If no other guardian is within range, the guardian instead gains the Solid Stone effect.\nShared Abilities.\nAll four guardians have access to these abilities:\nStrategy.\nOverview.\nThe Stone Guard is a one-phase &lt;a href=\"council%20encounter\"&gt;council-style encounter&lt;/a&gt; where the raid will encounter a series of three (10-player and LFR) or four (25-player) Quilen Guardians. The Guardians have a shared health pool and each has its own resource bar which represents its energy.\nEach Guardian gains energy when it is being tanked within 10 yards of another Guardian, and at max energy will use its Overload ability, which will do a large amount of raid-wide damage. Simultaneously, one Guardian will always be petrifying the raid, reducing the damage it deals by its own abilities by 90% and slowly turning the raid to stone. If petrification reaches 100 stacks the raid will wipe by virtue of being unable to move or act, but the petrification process can be interrupted if the guardian that is petrifying Overloads before petrification finishes.\nAs such, the primary focus of the encounter on all difficulty levels is for tanks to juggle aggro on the Guardians such that the Guardians only Overload when they are also petrifying while healers and DPS focus on dealing with the Guardians' various other abilities.\nRaid composition.\nThese are the ideal raid compositions, but similar configurations may work just as well. Note that proper execution of the optimal strategy does require two tanks on 10-player mode and three tanks on 25-player mode.\nEnrage mechanics.\nThe encounter has an 8 minute hard &lt;a href=\"enrage%20%28mechanic%29\"&gt;enrage&lt;/a&gt; timer and no soft enrage mechanics. After 8 minutes the Guardians will gain vastly increased attack speed and damage and will wipe the raid in a matter of seconds.\nRaid Finder Mode.\nIn LFR, it is advised to simply gather all three Guardians in the center of the room and attack all three simultaneously, while simply healing through Overloads and raid damage, as these abilities do far less damage in LFR. Players must still avoid Cobalt Mines and Amethyst Pools, and remain near each other when affected by Jasper Chains, as described below.\nNormal Mode.\nAt the Pull.\nOn 10-player mode and LFR, the main tank should pick up the two Guardians that are on the same side, while the off-tank should pick up the third. The Guardians should, initially, be tanked near where they spawn.\nOn 25-player mode, the main tank should pick up two Guardians and the off-tanks should pick up one each. One of the off-tanks should move their Guardian back towards the stairs leading to the entrance, while being careful not to be out of range of the healers or out of taunt range for the other tanks' Guardians. The other two tanks should remain close to where their Guardians spawn.\nIn both raid sizes, it is best if ranged DPS and healers spread out loosely in the center of the room while melee DPS stack with the current main tank.\nTanks.\nOne of the Guardians will start petrifying the raid shortly after the pull. If an off-tank's Guardian is petrifying, that off-tank needs to taunt one of the main tank's Guardians. If one of the main tank's Guardians is petrifying, the tanks do not need to do any juggling just yet.\nWhen the petrifying Guardian reaches 50 energy, one of the off-tanks should taunt the petrifying Guardian. When the petrifying Guardian reaches 100 energy it will overload, dealing very little damage as petrification reduces its damage by 90%. At this point, two Guardians will have 50 energy and one Guardian will have zero. From this point forward, the tanks will need to repeatedly swap the petrifying Guardian to ensure that, as much as possible, the one that will Overload is also the one currently petrifying.\nIf a Guardian overloads when it is not petrifying, tanks should use their defensive cooldowns to buy healers necessary time to heal the raid.\nHealers.\nHealers should pay attention to Rend Flesh on their tanks and try to prevent or effectively heal through this damage quickly.\nWhile proper execution of the tank swaps should result in Overloads from non-petrifying Guardians being rare or nonexistent, it is best for healers to save their burst healing cooldowns for these, as they are extremely damaging and may result in multiple deaths.\nIt is generally not worth going through the trouble of breaking the Jasper Chains, but if your raid opts to do so, you should only do it when the Jasper Guardian is petrifying, and healers may need to focus additional healing on the affected players. Affected players should check the Guardians' energy to avoid doing this too close to an Overload.\nDPS.\nSince the Guardians share a health pool, it is best to take advantage of this with cleaves and multidotting on the two Guardians being held by the main tank. No DPS should be focused on the Guardian(s) being tanked separately, as Solid Stone will reduce damage on these by 90%.\nEntire raid.\nAll members of the raid need to be aware of the Amethyst Pools and Cobalt Mines and make an effort to move out of both of them. The Amethyst Pools do constant damage to any players standing in them, while the Cobalt Mines will arm after a few seconds and then explode if anyone is in or enters the circle, dealing damage and rooting all affected players in place. Cobalt Mines that never explode should be cleared by DPS or healers whenever the Cobalt Guardian is petrifying, as this will reduce their damage by 90%.\nPlayers affected by Jasper Chains should stay close to the player they are chained to. While it is preferable for ranged DPS and healers to stay in the center of the room, if they are affected by Jasper Chains they should move into melee range if chained to a melee DPS.\nBreaking the chains should only be attempted when the Jasper Guardian is petrifying, reducing most of the damage from the chains. However, the players must ensure that the Jasper Guardian will not overload before the chain breaks, because this may result in one or both of the players dying. The Jasper Guardian does use Jasper Chains fairly often, and it is often advantageous to simply have players who are chained stay near each other rather than worrying about breaking them. This can however be very inconvenient when a melee DPS is chained to a Healer or a ranged DPS as the melee has to move a lot to keep in range of the Guardians being tanked together and to dodge the Amethyst Pools and Cobalt Mines.\nHeroism/Bloodlust/Time Warp.\nGiven that this is a single-phase encounter that does not become progressively more difficult over the course of the fight, it is best to use these abilities at the pull when all players are alive and can benefit from their procs and cooldowns when attempting it on Normal mode. On Heroic mode, it would be best to use it when the floor has as many energized tiles as possible.\nHeroic Mode.\nIn general, the encounter on Heroic Mode is very similar to its Normal Mode counterpart, but does introduce a new mechanic relating to the tiles on the floor. After the pull, a crystal will be present where each Guardian spawns. If a player clicks this crystal they will receive a debuff called Living Jasper, Living Jade, Living Amethyst or Living Cobalt applicable to the color ofthe Guardian that spawns there. On 10-player mode, the player will receive 10 stacks and on 25-player mode they will receive 7.\nThis debuff does damage every second to the affected player, but stacks may be quickly dropped by running across the white tiles on the floor of the room. When a player runs over a tile while the debuff is active, it will become an Energized Tile and glow brightly and the player will lose one stack of the debuff. Each tile that has been energized will increase the raid's damage and Spirit by 1%, and this effect stacks for each additional tile that becomes energized. The raid leader should assign a few DPS players to click the crystals after the pull and then these players should energize tiles in the room until the number that your raid is comfortable with have been energized.\nThe Guardians will reset the energized tiles with their Power Down ability when they reach 75% health and again when they reach 40% health, thus requiring the raid to energize them again in order to restore the buff.\nThe only other difference on heroic mode, which does not necessitate a change in strategy, is that the Guardian(s) tanked by the off tanks will not lose their current energy when they are in Solid Stone state.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

It is a 3 phase fight with 2 transitions which harshly tests the raid's ability to position dangerous abilities properly, as well as managing the dangerous &lt;a href=\"Bleed\"&gt;Bleed&lt;/a&gt; debuffs that Kaal can hit players with. \nAdventure Guide.\n\"The ancient stoneborn generals, Kaal and Grashaal, have hounded the Prince Renathal's rebellion at every turn. Once they were General Draven's apprentice and mentor; now their strength, strategy, and soldiers have been unleashed against him and any who would defy the Sire's will.\"\nStrategy.\nThis fight requires 2 tanks as each boss has a tank-swap mechanic. To start with, the raid should place raid markers on the left and right side of the arena: One to bring Kaal's Wicked Blades and one to bring Grashaal's Reverberating Eruptions. The melee/tanks should be in a group separate, but close to the range group, so that if a player from one group is targeted by Crystaline Burst, they can easily move to either group to soak bleed stacks. &lt;a href=\"Bloodlust\"&gt;Bloodlust&lt;/a&gt; should be saved for the final phase when raid damage is at its highest. \nPhase 1.\nThe first phase consists of battling Kaal solo while Grashaal flies in the air and remains untargetable. Kaal will hit the tanks with Serrated Tear, giving them a stacking bleed debuff. Tanks want to swap after every cast to keep the damage low, as they will both be dropping their bleed stacks at the same time when Grashaal casts Crystaline Burst. He will mark one non-tank player with a radius. This player should move to the tanks, as well as anyone else who has a bleed stack from other abilities, and become petrified. This will stun the players for 1 second and remove all bleed stacks from everyone within. Afterward, people should stay with the originally targeted player as Grashaal will then launch a meteor at them that needs to be soaked to avoid lethal damage. Afterward, the raid can spread again. \nGeneral Kaal will also be throwing Wicked Blades at non-tank players. These boomerangs will hit the 2 targeted players, as well as anyone in the way, with another bleed debuff that needs to be removed via Crystaline Burst. While the damage is negligible on Normal, this ability becomes deadly on Heroic and requires quick reactivity from raid members to avoid multiple people being hit by the blades, which can quickly lead to a wipe. Melee should also be cautious and stay behind the boss relative to where she's throwing the boomerangs, as careless DPS or tanks can be clipped by the blades either when she throws it or when it is returning to her. Correct handling of this ability should only leave the 2 targeted people with bleed debuffs which can be safely removed. \nFinally, Kaal applies Heart Rend to random players, a damaging debuff which needs to be dispelled. Once the debuff is gone, it will be replaced by Heart Hemmorage, forcing healers to spot-heal the affected person for a short period, which is preferable to the more long-lasting damage of Heart Rend. Keep everyone healthy and watch out for the bleed debuffs until Kaal reaches 50% health. \nTransition.\nAt half health, Kaal activates a shield which blocks 95% of damage to herself, making damaging her mostly pointless. At the same time, Grashaal's forces and General Draven will be fighting in the skies, while a Stone Legion Goliath attacks the raid. You will see a meter at the top of the screen which shows Prince Renathal's anima. The raid's goal in this phase is to take down the goliath and fill up Renathal's anima meter to 100% to transition to the next phase. \nKaal and Grashaal will continue casting their same abilities from Phase 1, but now the DPS should focusing on the goliath. This add is very dangerous due to the Ravenous Hunger stacks, which increase it's damage endlessly until it dies, so DPS may consider saving cooldowns for this add. It will also cast Ravenous Feast, which has the add pin a non-tank player to the ground and deal high damage over a few seconds. If the Ravenous Hunger stacks are too high, the feast can easily 1-shot players, meaning killing it as soon as possible is top priority. Once it reaches 30% health, the goliath will stop attacking and activate Soultaint Effigy, which gradually reduces the healing all players receive. Letting this stack too high will inevitably lead to the tanks' deaths, so finish off the goliath quickly. \nTo end the phase, bring the anima orbs that appear around the arena to Renathal. General Draven will be killing adds in the air, causing them to drop down. These small orbs will restore 10% of Renathal's anima. Killing the Stone Legion Goliath will drop a huge orb that is worth 40%, meaning the raid should be looking to grab 6 small orbs and the goliath's orb to end the phase. Stay close to the inside of the arena, since the blast that Renathal uses to destroy Kaal's shield will knock players back, potentially over the the cliff if they are too far away.\nPhase 2.\nAs Kaal flies away, the raid will now be fighting General Grashaal directly. Kaal will be throwing her Wicked Blades from the air, while Grashaal casts Crystalize on the ground. Simply deal with these abilities as before. \nGarshaal will now cast Stone First on the tanks, which leaves a debuff that increases the damage taken by Stone Fist. This is not a bleed attack and simply knocks the tank backwards. The tanks should taunt after every cast to keep the stack below one. \nNext, he will cast Seismic Upheaval. This ability will cause swirls underneath each player's feet and erupt in a stone spike after 4 seconds. After the first spike, another will spawn, and one more after that before the ability ends, forcing the players to keep moving until 3 spikes appear. The raid should be spread out for this phase due to this ability, as clumping together will make it harder to avoid all the stone spikes. \nLast for this phase is the Reverberating Eruptions. Grashaal will mark a player. After 5 seconds, he will leap into the air and crash down on the player's location, leaving an 8-yard area of Unstable Ground behind. Using the markers the raid set up previously, keep the areas of Unstable Ground near the back of the arena, but not too far away from the raid. Each time Grashaal casts Reverbrating Eruption, the previously created Unstable Grounds will begin to erupt. At the end of the cast, if no one is standing within an area of Unstable Ground, it will erupt and hit the raid with high damage. To counter this, keep the raid close to the areas to allow people to soak these eruptions. Only 1 person is required per area of Unstable Ground, but soaking will leave the soaking player with Reverberating Vulerability, meaning players cannot soak twice in a row without an immunity. This means that everyone in the raid must be ready to soak at a moment's notice if they do not have the vulnerability debuff. \nAfter a second transition, whose mechanics are the same as the first, the final phase begins.\nPhase 3.\nFinally, both Kaal and Grashaal will land and face the raid together. Both bosses need to die at the same time, because if one boss dies before the other, they will get a 200% damage buff which will quickly wipe the raid. The raid should have someone calling out which abilities are going out, since confusing which abilities are which can spell disaster. The most vital parts of this phase are: \nIf all 5 of these mechanics are understood and followed through, the bosses should go down. "}

Not all stone golems are actually made of \"stone\".\nHistory.\nStone golems were created by the titans or &lt;a href=\"Keepers\"&gt;Keepers&lt;/a&gt; at an unknown point in time, and left to guard their now-ruined cities across &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt some point, the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;Dark Iron clan&lt;/a&gt; gained the ability to produce them. The construction process can be seen throughout &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Depths\"&gt;Blackrock Depths&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Cauldron\"&gt;The Cauldron&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; has uncovered the secret to creating life from stone and plans to build an army of unstoppable golems to aid him in conquering the whole of &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe dark irons plumbed the secrets of Uldaman to make their golems more powerful. They seek the &lt;a href=\"Discs%20of%20Norgannon\"&gt;Discs of Norgannon&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe term \"&lt;a href=\"war%20golem\"&gt;war golem&lt;/a&gt;\" is used by both the dark irons and the iron dwarves for various types of their golems. The exact context, beyond that they are golems made for war, is unknown.\nStone golems can be either titan-made, or dark iron-made. Some titanic ones are newly made by (often corrupted) titan factories and constructs. Who or what produced them can usually be assumed by location. Some in Uldaman and the Badlands could be either, due to the presence of both influences. Some anomalies exist, such as &lt;a href=\"Brutus\"&gt;Brutus&lt;/a&gt;, who has an unknown maker and serves the &lt;a href=\"Bloodsail%20Buccaneers\"&gt;Bloodsail Buccaneers&lt;/a&gt;.\nCannon-wielding stone golems also exist. The dark iron dwarves seem to have expanded on the initial titan design, replacing the hands of some of their golems with cannons, and adding a cannonball magazine to their backs. However, the existence of one titan-made version was revealed in &lt;a href=\"Sholazar%20Basin\"&gt;Sholazar Basin&lt;/a&gt;, the titanic &lt;a href=\"Stormwatcher\"&gt;Stormwatcher&lt;/a&gt;s, calling the assumption the dark irons invented this modification into question.\nThe iron dwarves have created a similar type of golem made from the same type of iron that most things related to them are made of, the &lt;a href=\"iron%20golem\"&gt;iron golem&lt;/a&gt;. However, some were seemingly left by the titans, and do not serve the nefarious iron dwarves.\nThe dark iron clan has recently made a new version of their golems, the &lt;a href=\"dwarven%20golem\"&gt;dwarven golem&lt;/a&gt;, resembling a large dwarf made of metal. Units with this model were allegedly created centuries ago by the dark iron dwarves, and then abandoned. The &lt;a href=\"earthen\"&gt;earthen&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Deepholm\"&gt;Deepholm&lt;/a&gt; use similar-looking golems.\nIn the RPG.\n&lt;a href=\"Black%20iron%20golem\"&gt;Black iron golem&lt;/a&gt;s are seemingly a specialized version of this type of golem in the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;. Their purpose is unknown.\nRelation to stone watchers.\nThe secrets of constructing a &lt;a href=\"stone%20watcher\"&gt;stone watcher&lt;/a&gt; were lost long ago with the titans. Today, those who have located and studied stone watchers attempt to duplicate the stone watcher's superior techniques, but invariably fall short. Anyone wishing to construct a stone watcher only succeeds in creating a stone golem instead. \"This may refer to a generic golem made of stone.\""}

A stone keeper has a humanoid body, although it is otherwise nearly featureless. It is made from a smooth, grey marble alien to Azeroth. It stands 7 feet tall and weighs 1,300 pounds. Stone keepers have relatively plain features, as though their creators could not be bothered with the details of appearance. They are functional, and nothing more. Only a few colored crystals embedded in its left forearm are particularly distinguished.\nThe titans created stone keepers to be servants and assistants. These constructs were granted an almost sapient intelligence, though little of the brute strength of the &lt;a href=\"stone%20watcher\"&gt;stone watcher&lt;/a&gt;. While stone watchers served as guardians of the titans\u2019 property, stone keepers often served as companions; one might even think as pets. Stone keepers possess a programmed intelligence so sophisticated that observers have a difficult time distinguishing one from a sentient being. A stone keeper is able to communicate in the ancient language of the titans. However, few creatures (if any) are alive who understand this language. Not all is lost. The constructs can use powerful magic to analyze languages, and are able to communicate with any intelligent being capable of speech.\nA stone keeper is generally not programmed to fight, but is usually programmed to defend itself. Stone keepers tactics often include simple frontal assaults, but some employ tactics when necessary. A stone keeper can manipulate the crystals on its forearm to generate any number of spell-like abilities, such as tongues. Further, a stone keeper can activate its crystals to retrieve archived information. Most of the stone keeper's knowledge tends to be millennia out of date. A transmute rock to mud spell slows a stone keeper, while transmute mud to rock heals it completely. A stone to flesh spell does not actually change the keeper's structure.\nThe secrets of constructing a stone keeper were lost long ago with the titans. Today, those who have located and studied stone keepers may try to replicate these masterpieces; but they succeed only in replicating basic traits, not its programmed intelligence."}

They've been warring against the earthen ever since, for thousands of years. They often are found working with &lt;a href=\"fungus\"&gt;fungus&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nFollowing their war with the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"keeper\"&gt;keeper&lt;/a&gt;s set to work creating a new generation of titan-forged by using the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Wills\"&gt;Forge of Wills&lt;/a&gt;. However, their initial designs proved too complex, and the result was a race of stone-skinned brutes known thereafter as \"troggs\". Distressed by the savage creatures, the keepers refined their design, resulting in the &lt;a href=\"earthen\"&gt;earthen&lt;/a&gt; race. The keepers could not bring themselves to destroy their already-existing defect creations, and instead the giantess &lt;a href=\"Ironaya\"&gt;Ironaya&lt;/a&gt; created the vault of &lt;a href=\"Uldaman\"&gt;Uldaman&lt;/a&gt; to serve as a stasis chamber for the troggs. However, some troggs later managed to escape the vault and began wandering the world. One group somehow managed to make their way into &lt;a href=\"Deepholm\"&gt;Deepholm&lt;/a&gt; via &lt;a href=\"Uldum\"&gt;Uldum&lt;/a&gt; more than fifteen thousand years ago. These troggs were not afflicted by the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Flesh\"&gt;Curse of Flesh&lt;/a&gt;, unlike their cousins on Azeroth, and are therefore known as stone troggs, the \"true form\" of troggs."}
{"id": "189520", "revid": "39299307", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=189520", "title": "Stone watcher", "text": "A stone watcher is a type of &lt;a href=\"stone%20keeper\"&gt;stone keeper&lt;/a&gt;. It resembles a massive humanoid statue and has a nondescript, featureless face, and is emotionless. It raises its arms to strike with stony fists. A stone watcher is 15 feet tall and weighs 6,000 pounds. The stone that makes up the watcher's body is unnatural, and no stone like it exists on Azeroth except in the construction of these constructs and the related &lt;a href=\"stone%20keeper\"&gt;stone keeper&lt;/a&gt;s. This creation is incredibly swift; it relies on time magic to move with a devastating purpose. Much like the enigmatic &lt;a href=\"black%20iron%20golem\"&gt;black iron golem&lt;/a&gt;s, there is a similarity in the apparent design of these constructs. Most stone watchers lurk over ancient ruins, guarding entrances to long-lost halls and crumbled stone constructions of immense size. The constructs are obviously guardians of some sort, left to watch over long-abandoned sites that once probably held great significance. These creatures sometimes guard ancient roads or remote wilderness areas waiting for intruders to attempt to pass. Stone watchers served as guardians of the titans' property, while stone keepers often served as companions.\nThese relics of an ancient race can still prove a deadly and final menace to the unwary. A stone watcher exists in a bubble of time that is slightly out of phase with the normal world. The effect is similar to a haste spell, but the effect cannot be dispelled. The spell makes the stone watcher appear to be moving faster than its normal speed. Finally, a stone watcher is able to make even larger shifts through time, and seemingly move from one place to another almost instantly. Time seems to cease for everyone but the stone watcher when this ability is used. The stone watcher cannot interact with the material world while it is in this special state, shifting through time. After making a large shift, a stone watcher's energy reserves must recharge; and it cannot make another shift for a while. A transmute rock to mud spell strips a stone watcher of its time distortion ability, while transmute mud to rock fully heals the watcher. A stone to flesh spell does not actually change the watcher's structure.\nThe secrets of constructing a stone watcher were lost long ago with the titans. Today, those who have located and studied stone watchers attempt to duplicate the stone watcher's superior techniques, but invariably fall short. Anyone wishing to construct a stone watcher only succeeds in creating a &lt;a href=\"stone%20golem\"&gt;stone golem&lt;/a&gt; instead.\nNotable stone watchers.\n\"These creatures seem to have been renamed as just &lt;a href=\"titanic%20watcher\"&gt;watchers&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nNotes.\nStone watchers have been represented in WoW using the \"&lt;a href=\"stonekeeper\"&gt;stonekeeper&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"stone%20giant\"&gt;stone giant&lt;/a&gt;\" models, among others."}

{"id": "363392", "revid": "27079649", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=363392", "title": "Stoneborn", "text": "The stoneborn, also known as gargoyles, are winged stone constructs who serve the &lt;a href=\"venthyr\"&gt;venthyr&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Revendreth\"&gt;Revendreth&lt;/a&gt; as soldiers and guards.\nBackground.\nAs their name implies, stoneborn are carved from stone and then awakened by being infused with &lt;a href=\"anima\"&gt;anima&lt;/a&gt;. When deprived of anima or when their services are no longer required, they return to their natural stone form but can be reawakened at a later date. It is implied that they are fully conscious while in this state.\nStoneborn serve their venthyr masters with a sense of infallible loyalty forged over a lifetime of fighting side by side. Most stoneborn serve &lt;a href=\"Sire%20Denathrius\"&gt;Sire Denathrius&lt;/a&gt; as members of the &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Legion\"&gt;Stone Legion&lt;/a&gt; under the command of the &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Legion%20Generals\"&gt;Stone Legion Generals&lt;/a&gt; and are responsible for protecting Revendreth, keeping order in each of the Wards, and purging &lt;a href=\"manifestation\"&gt;manifestation&lt;/a&gt;s. The &lt;a href=\"Darkwing%20%28stoneborn%29\"&gt;Darkwing&lt;/a&gt; have instead sided with &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Renathal\"&gt;Prince Renathal&lt;/a&gt;'s rebellion under &lt;a href=\"General%20Draven\"&gt;General Draven&lt;/a&gt;. After the events of the rebellion, the return of the &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Revendreth\"&gt;Revendreth&lt;/a&gt;, and the Stonewright's allegiance to Renathal, the stoneborn are operating as the Stone Legion once more.\nThe first stoneborn were created by &lt;a href=\"the%20Stonewright\"&gt;the Stonewright&lt;/a&gt; long ago to defend Revendreth against the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;'s invasion, as the &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxi\"&gt;Maldraxxi&lt;/a&gt; did not rise up to defend Revendreth during that event. The Stonewright sees each stoneborn as her \"stonechild\", and they, in turn, view her as their mother. &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Renathal\"&gt;Prince Renathal&lt;/a&gt; remembers when the first stoneborn were made by the Stonewright. Stoneborn refer to each other as \"stonebrother\" and \"stone sister\".\nThe venthyr carve stoneborn into different shapes because diversity in form allows for diversity in strategy; their different shapes give them different purpose. The most common humanoid type is called stoneborn brutes. In battle, brutes bludgeon their enemies with an array of martial weapon skills or use their unparalleled mobility to outflank them. A larger, unnamed type resemble &lt;a href=\"felbat\"&gt;felbat&lt;/a&gt;s and move on all fours while on the ground. A third type is the gravewings (somewhat confusingly also called \"stoneborn brutes\" by one source), which act as flying mounts for the venthyr. Gravewings are fearless and nearly indestructible and were reawakened by the Stonewright after anima began flowing again in &lt;a href=\"Sinfall\"&gt;Sinfall&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Stone%20fiend\"&gt;Stone fiend&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"gargon\"&gt;gargon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"dredbat\"&gt;dredbat&lt;/a&gt;s are made in the same way as stoneborn, but gargons and dredbats lack the stoneborn's intelligence. Stone fiends are sometimes considered stoneborn.\nAs a mount.\nAll gravewing mounts are exclusive to members of the &lt;a href=\"Venthyr%20Covenant\"&gt;Venthyr Covenant&lt;/a&gt;."}

He acts as an ambassador between the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Lotus\"&gt;Golden Lotus&lt;/a&gt; and the people of &lt;a href=\"Sunwalker%20Dezco\"&gt;Sunwalker Dezco&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nBleeding Sun.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale&lt;/a&gt; had been opened to the outsiders for couple of days, &lt;a href=\"Zhi%20the%20Harmonious\"&gt;Zhi the Harmonious&lt;/a&gt; and a handful of Golden Lotus members, including Mokimo and &lt;a href=\"Weng%20the%20Merciful\"&gt;Weng the Merciful&lt;/a&gt;, had visited the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Two%20Moons\"&gt;Shrine of Two Moons&lt;/a&gt; to seek a new guardian among the children there. They performed a \"simple test\" involving the use of a special gong to find the promising child. As he rang the gong, the avatar of &lt;a href=\"Chi-Ji\"&gt;Chi-Ji the Red Crane&lt;/a&gt; appeared and chose one of Dezco's twin sons as the new member of Golden Lotus. Chi-Ji said only one child would need to serve the vale Zhi surprisingly commented he didn't expect the new member to be a child of the outsiders.\nThough Zhi gave Dezco time to think of choosing which son to be the guardian, the sunwalker had decided to leave the Vale with both of his sons, not allowing any of his son taken away from him. Zhi agreed and sent Mokimo to inform Dezco that Golden Lotus would respect the sunwalker's decision. But Dezco had suspected it was Zhi's oblique way of asking him to stay in the Vale with his children. Mokimo also told Dezco his early story as he was once homesick and expected to go home, only to found his family and the entire village decimated when Zhi allowed him to. He realized \"expectation\" to be a dangerous thing, and held honor to his duty since then. \nNonetheless, a tragic battle broke out in the Vale shortly after. Mokimo had done his best to aid Dezco defending his children. But despite their best efforts, one of Dezco's sons, Cloudhoof, had died in the heat of the battle. With Redhorn the other child also greatly wounded, Mokimo led both of them to one of the magical pools in the Vale, teaching him to let the Vale do its miraculous work. An translucent image of Chi-Ji then appeared and healed the dying child. Amazed by the order's love and concern for his children, and stirred by Mokimo's speech of home, Dezco realized at last the true meaning of his wife's visions concerning the Vale, and gave Redhorn to Mokimo, saying goodbye to his only child and his last connection to his wife, in the knowledge that this was in fact the true reason for his tribe's journey to the Vale.

To prepare would-be champions against him, Highlord &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt; presents a test of courage, endurance, and teamwork. His hardened veterans will weed out those who lack the stomach to face the ravening throngs of undead.\"\nStrategy.\nMokra the Skullcrusher is a very dangerous opponent. The big thing to watch out for is his &lt;a href=\"Bladestorm\"&gt;Bladestorm&lt;/a&gt; ability which can, very quickly, kill all non-tanks in melee range when he starts spinning. Tanks will need to be careful not to accidentally drag him into another group member because even plate dps will be killed with just a few hits and the healer will most likely be focused on keeping the tank up. It's important to note that he moves as fast as you do when he &lt;a href=\"Bladestorm\"&gt;Bladestorm&lt;/a&gt;s so running is not an option.\nThe second thing to watch for with Mokra is your threat. Because of his &lt;a href=\"Intercept%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Intercept (Classic)&lt;/a&gt; ability, any ranged DPS or healer who manages to pull aggro will most likely immediately die when Mokra charges and one-shots them. Best case in this situation is Mokra kills the offending group member and bee-lines back to the tank. Worst-case he one-shots your healer in time for his &lt;a href=\"Bladestorm\"&gt;Bladestorm&lt;/a&gt; cooldown to wipe out all your ranged DPS before they can even think about hitting their aggro-dumps.\nAn uncontrolled Mokra \"will\" kill your group by himself.\nWhen dealing with Mokra it's usually best to target him anything other than first. He has more staying power than the other champions because of his shield, but deals less, and more predictable damage than &lt;a href=\"Deathstalker%20Visceri\"&gt;Deathstalker Visceri&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally he lacks any form of CC, heals, or manner of disrupting your group which makes him strictly a secondary target regardless of who you're fighting.\nNotes.\nEven on heroic Mokra is vulnerable to disarms. A well-timed or lucky &lt;a href=\"Disarm\"&gt;Disarm&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Dismantle\"&gt;Dismantle&lt;/a&gt; that lands just before he bladestorms will greatly reduce the damage he deals.\nIf you have a Rogue in your group any melee burn on Mokra should be accompanied with a &lt;a href=\"Dismantle\"&gt;Dismantle&lt;/a&gt;. Getting rid of his shield will significantly increase the damage he takes.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

This is where the &lt;a href=\"Attunement%20to%20the%20Core\"&gt;Attunement to the Core&lt;/a&gt; quest can be completed - the core fragment is on the far side of the bridge, next to the portal. Note that you do not need to enter the core to finish this quest; in fact, if you enter the core by mistake, when you exit the core you will appear outside of the depths, next to the questgiver for the attunement quest. You will then need to run all the way back through the depths to rejoin your group. \nThe lava path shortcut.\nIf you are aiming for The Emperor, &lt;a href=\"Black%20Forge\"&gt;Black Forge&lt;/a&gt; or the entrance to MC, you might consider taking the lava path. It begins below the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Anvil\"&gt;Black Anvil&lt;/a&gt;, and ends at the Black Forge, bypassing much of the instance. \nJumping left after first entering the room from the direction of the bar into the lava its a short swim to the nearest flat piece of land that lines the walls. This path winds around until you come to a ledge far below the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20Enchantment\"&gt;Chamber of Enchantment&lt;/a&gt;. Lower level players may need to deal with incidental elementals that flank this route on a small nearby island. The next step is a long stretch of lava patrolled by an elemental that you have to cross to reach an island in the center of the lava, which also has 4 elementals on it. Its best to pull the patrolling elemental and deal with it before crossing. It is possible to avoid all four elementals on the island, or to deal with them individually or in pairs. After that island, the last step is a short swim until you come up underneath the bridge, where you can climb up to the Black Forge. Beware of aggroing the 1st 3 elementals on the left. \nThe lava path allows for nice quick runs to 3 of the main objectives in BRD, but it can be dangerous for the inexperienced, or soloing characters. If you are aiming for the Emperor, you will come up before &lt;a href=\"the%20Lyceum\"&gt;the Lyceum&lt;/a&gt;, needing the &lt;a href=\"Shadowforge%20Key\"&gt;Shadowforge Key&lt;/a&gt; to continue, and you cannot move backwards into the room of 7. As described, it is possible currently for the 1st mob you fight in the instance to be the elemental patrolling the lava before the island."}

It was one of two forty (40) player raid dungeons available upon release of \"World of Warcraft\", the other being &lt;a href=\"Onyxia%27s%20Lair\"&gt;Onyxia's Lair&lt;/a&gt;. Considered the pinnacle of raiding achievement at the time, the Molten Core enticed adventurers to enter the instance in the search of realm glory. \nThe sulfuric Molten Core is a gateway from the &lt;a href=\"Firelands\"&gt;Firelands&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe Molten Core was created during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;War of the Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt; more than 300 years ago. Near the end of the war, &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer-Thane%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt;, sought to summon a powerful fire elemental to defeat the combined forces of the Bronzebeard and Wildhammer clans. He was more successful than he could have imagined, as he released Ragnaros the Firelord from millennia of captivity under the &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt;.\nRagnaros destroyed the city of Thaurissan and created the volcano of &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt;. He dwells there to this day with his elemental servants and the enslaved remnants of the Dark Iron dwarf clan. The burning lake where Ragnaros lies sleeping acts as a rift connecting to the plane of fire, allowing the malicious elementals to pass through.\nAt some point, &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Antonidas\"&gt;Archmage Antonidas&lt;/a&gt; was studying the entrance of the Molten Core.\nFrom the &lt;a href=\"Game%20Guide/Raid%20Areas\"&gt;Raid Areas&lt;/a&gt; page on the official World of Warcraft Community Site:\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Dagran%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Dagran Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt;'s death, &lt;a href=\"Moira%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Moira Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt;, hoping to free the Dark Iron dwarves from the fire elementals' rule, made sure the people of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; knew about the threat of the elementals and about riches hidden deep below Blackrock Mountain. When Azeroth's &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;heroes&lt;/a&gt;, recruited by the &lt;a href=\"Hydraxian%20Waterlords\"&gt;Hydraxian Waterlords&lt;/a&gt;, carefully moved through the Molten Core, killing the greatest of the fire elementals, vicious flamewakers, corehounds and their monstrous father, Magmadar, and even Majordomo Executus, and ultimately Ragnaros. The Firelord and his defeated elemental minions were banished back into the Firelands.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Raiment\"&gt;Cenarion Raiment&lt;/a&gt; was liberated from the Molten Core and bestowed upon a worthy &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the area was entered by &lt;a href=\"Thaelin%20Darkanvil\"&gt;Thaelin Darkanvil&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; adventurer, seeking a &lt;a href=\"Fragment%20o%27%20the%20Molten%20Core\"&gt;Fragment of the Molten Core&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Anvil\"&gt;Black Anvil&lt;/a&gt;. Despite previous efforts, several fire elementals and beasts still lingered in the cavern. The pair proceeded through the Core on &lt;a href=\"The%20Tank\"&gt;The Tank&lt;/a&gt; and found &lt;a href=\"Gezzrok%20the%20Keeper\"&gt;Gezzrok the Keeper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros%27%20Lair\"&gt;Ragnaros' Lair&lt;/a&gt;. Gezzrok provided them with the fragment after proving their worth in a duel.\nGeography.\nThe Molten Core consists of rock and lava, with the lava forming rivers, small lakes and \"lavafalls\". Other features are small volcano-like smoke vents, molten cracks in the walls and roof, occasional &lt;a href=\"dark%20iron\"&gt;dark iron&lt;/a&gt; deposits, and &lt;a href=\"the%20runes%20of%20warding\"&gt;the runes of warding&lt;/a&gt;. Most locations do not have specific names, causing the majority of the Molten Core to be called simply \"The Molten Core\".\nThere are three possible ways to enter Molten Core:\nLoot.\nUpon successful completion of the encounters, all bosses drop &lt;a href=\"tier%201\"&gt;tier 1&lt;/a&gt; set items - excluding Ragnaros, who drops &lt;a href=\"tier%202\"&gt;tier 2&lt;/a&gt; leg items. In addition, trash mobs may drop &lt;a href=\"Fiery%20Core\"&gt;Fiery Core&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Lava%20Core\"&gt;Lava Core&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Core%20Leather\"&gt;Core Leather&lt;/a&gt;, which can be used to craft armor and weapons available with &lt;a href=\"Thorium%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Thorium Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; reputation.\nBattle pets.\nThe item drops themselves are &lt;a href=\"bind%20on%20pickup\"&gt;bind on pickup&lt;/a&gt;, but the learned pets can be crated and traded.\nRaid history.\nOn release, Molten Core and &lt;a href=\"Onyxia%27s%20Lair%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Onyxia's Lair&lt;/a&gt; were the only 40-player instances in the game, thus Ragnaros was the first \"game end boss.\" With the advent of &lt;a href=\"Blackwing%20Lair\"&gt;Blackwing Lair&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt;, the original level-60 version of &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt;, and the raising of the level cap with the game's expansions, defeating Ragnaros has long since ceased to be the pinnacle of raiding success. However, prior to the \"&lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;\", slaying him was still considered a very important step in raid progression before engaging in more challenging content. It was the first raid encounter which required a concerted effort in acquiring massive amounts of a particular statistic (in this case, fire resistance). Moreover, the encounter was the first one to demand the extensive use of consumables, at least in the learning process and in the first few kills. As such, it was once a very important stage in the evolution of a raiding guild.\nMolten Core is now typically only run for the &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Core%20%28achievement%29\"&gt;Molten Core (achievement)&lt;/a&gt; achievement, or by players seeking to craft &lt;a href=\"Sulfuras%2C%20Hand%20of%20Ragnaros\"&gt;Sulfuras, Hand of Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Thunderfury%2C%20Blessed%20Blade%20of%20the%20Windseeker\"&gt;Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, three &lt;a href=\"battle%20pet\"&gt;battle pet&lt;/a&gt;s were added in &lt;a href=\"Patch%205.1\"&gt;Patch 5.1&lt;/a&gt; as part of the &lt;a href=\"Raiding%20with%20Leashes\"&gt;Raiding with Leashes&lt;/a&gt; achievement, giving players another reason to run the instance.\nPlayers were able to start soloing Molten Core in \"Wrath of the Lich King\", and more easily in \"Cataclysm\" and \"Mists of Pandaria\". Now that pre-current-expansion raids do not require a raid group to enter, soloing the raid for &lt;a href=\"transmogrification\"&gt;transmogrification&lt;/a&gt; purposes or other loot is easier than ever.\nPrerequisites.\nWhile technically there are no prerequisites to enter Molten Core through its entrance at the bottom of Blackrock Depths, every Core raider will want to complete the &lt;a href=\"Attunement%20to%20the%20Core\"&gt;Attunement to the Core&lt;/a&gt; quest to enable the shortcut at the bottom of Blackrock Mountain. This quest is given at level 55 by &lt;a href=\"Lothos%20Riftwaker\"&gt;Lothos Riftwaker&lt;/a&gt; who is located just outside the &lt;a href=\"Grinding%20Quarry\"&gt;Grinding Quarry&lt;/a&gt;, on the way to &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Depths\"&gt;Blackrock Depths&lt;/a&gt;. Once attuned you can access Molten Core by talking to Lothos again. When dead (as ghost) you also have the possibility to jump into the lava near Lothos. This can also be done by living players if they have a way to slow fall, or by jumping first onto the small ledge in the pillar on the right as you enter the main chamber of Blackrock Mountain, healing, then jumping down, back toward the wall of the lava pit, to cover the remaining distance to the platform below. \nBefore Ragnaros can be summoned, the raid must defeat Majordomo Executus. Majordomo Executus will only appear if the raid douses the seven runes that are located near certain bosses in the Molten Core.\nEach of the bosses in Molten Core has a very specific &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Core%20Loot\"&gt;loot table&lt;/a&gt;, which includes the &lt;a href=\"Tier%201\"&gt;Tier 1&lt;/a&gt; armor pieces as well as a number of other epic-quality items.\nAs stated, the Molten Core includes several mechanics which forces players to fight the bosses in a specific order. These mechanics are:\nPowerful players (level 70-80+) can fight the eight first bosses in any way they prefer. It's also possible to skip Lucifron.\nAnniversary edition.\nFor WoW's 10-year anniversary, a special 40-player &lt;a href=\"Raid%20Finder\"&gt;Raid Finder&lt;/a&gt; version of Molten Core was re-released to players as a &lt;a href=\"Looking%20For%20Raid\"&gt;Looking For Raid&lt;/a&gt; instance, with the encounters tuned and updated numerically, but \"99% of nostalgia preserved\". Elemental immunities/resistances were one of the only things \"nerfed\" in the name of playability; &lt;a href=\"Golemagg\"&gt;Golemagg's&lt;/a&gt; aggro radius was also reduced. According to one developer, watching Blizzard's internal testers do &lt;a href=\"Core%20Hound%20pack\"&gt;Core Hound pack&lt;/a&gt;s was glorious.\nThe anniversary raid appeared as an option in max-level players' Group Finder menus for the duration of the anniversary. The description for the raid read \"Celebrate World of Warcraft's Anniversary by running rampant through Ragnaros's hallowed Core, to his very lair\", referencing &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt;'s well-known dialogue just before fighting him. Defeating &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; awarded the achievement &lt;a href=\"Boldly%2C%20You%20Sought%20the%20Power%20of%20Ragnaros\"&gt;Boldly, You Sought the Power of Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt;, which came with the mount &lt;a href=\"Core%20Hound%20Chain\"&gt;Core Hound Chain&lt;/a&gt;. Ragnaros himself also had a 100% chance to drop a helm of the appropriate armor type, each sharing the same fiery model as the original &lt;a href=\"Crown%20of%20Destruction%20%28item%29\"&gt;Crown of Destruction item&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Circle%20of%20Flame\"&gt;Circle of Flame&lt;/a&gt;. He had a very low chance to drop the companion &lt;a href=\"Hatespark%20the%20Tiny\"&gt;Hatespark the Tiny&lt;/a&gt; and the cosmetic enhancer . Other bosses dropped only gold. All enemies awarded &lt;a href=\"Hydraxian%20Waterlords\"&gt;Hydraxian Waterlords&lt;/a&gt; reputation just as in the original version."}

The talent is popular among Fire-specced PvE raiding mages. The last 35% of a raid boss fight can be the most critical, with low mana and dead players. By the 35% mark, &lt;a href=\"aggro\"&gt;aggro&lt;/a&gt; is firmly established and DPS classes are free to unload, making the effective DPS increase much more valuable. Also, because this is a multiplicative damage increase, it increases more effectively as other vulnerabilities are applied to the target (such as &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20the%20Elements\"&gt;Curse of the Elements&lt;/a&gt;) as well was gaining increases from talents such as &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Power%20%28mage%20talent%29\"&gt;Fire Power (mage talent)&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlthough this talent is situated in the &lt;a href=\"Fire\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt; tree it applies to all spell damage caused by the mage.\nBesides boss fights also consider using this talent in a &lt;a href=\"Blizzard\"&gt;Blizzard&lt;/a&gt; build, where the gradual decrease in mob health increases your effective kill speed by 4% in the optimal case (12% * (35/100))."}
{"id": "68413", "revid": "22514", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=68413", "title": "Molten Giant", "text": "Molten Giants are a type of fiery and molten &lt;a href=\"mountain%20giant\"&gt;mountain giant&lt;/a&gt;s found in the &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Core\"&gt;Molten Core&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Molten%20giant\"&gt;Molten giant&lt;/a&gt;s are huge fiery creatures that reside in the darkest hottest places of Azeroth and the &lt;a href=\"Firelands\"&gt;Firelands&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Plane\"&gt;Elemental Plane&lt;/a&gt;. Their skin is a deep red, and they are affiliated with fire elementals, which often coexist with them. Their largest numbers can currently be found in Molten Core. \nFirst two mobs in the instance. These always come in pairs, and are impossible to pull alone. As you progress through the &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Core\"&gt;Molten Core&lt;/a&gt;, Molten Giants will gradually be replaced with &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Destroyer\"&gt;Molten Destroyer&lt;/a&gt;s, starting with one Destroyer and one &lt;a href=\"Giant\"&gt;Giant&lt;/a&gt;, and eventually two Destroyers. The easiest way to deal with them is to put a tank on each and separate them so their stomps do not hurt the same group. Finish one then the other.\nThis mob spawns in pairs. The giants are very tough beasts with high HP.\nStrategy.\nEach giant has a tank with one or two healers each to keep them up through the stomps. Hunters can use their instant shots to pull the giants to each tank. The giants are then kept separated and away from the main raid. DPS begins after 2 to 3 sunders, focusing first on giants and then destroyers.\nNote to tank: Since the Knockback is threat reducing, you might lose aggro on the giant. So once you tank the giant, do not use the &lt;a href=\"taunt\"&gt;taunt&lt;/a&gt;. Just as the giant hit you with a knockback, taunt him back, and build the threat up again. Also, tanking him with your back to a wall is helpful, since the knockback won't knock you out of melee range.\nNotes.\nThe main focus of the giants in the zone seems to be to slow players down, and pace the speed at which the zone is cleared. They are the high hp meat-and-potatoes of the initial clear."}

The &lt;a href=\"Leaping%20Gorger%20Residue\"&gt;Leaping Gorger Residue&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Power%20Geode\"&gt;Power Geode&lt;/a&gt; buffs can be obtained here, and Goren Eggs looted. The inhabitants of this area are known as the &lt;a href=\"Destructors\"&gt;Destructors&lt;/a&gt; fighting against the &lt;a href=\"Shapers\"&gt;Shapers&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvent.\nCollect Empowered Ore is the special event in the Molten Quarry.\nScattered around the Molten Quarry are chunks of ore. Players can click on a chunk to pick it up, and can then travel to their faction's mine card to deposit it. The first faction to collect 10 pieces of ore wins the event. Players can only carry one chunk of ore at a time, and their movement speed is reduced while doing so.\nLeaping Gorgers.\nLeaping Gorger are corpses sometimes found in the zone which can be interacted with to obtain the &lt;a href=\"Leaping%20Gorger%20Residue\"&gt;Leaping Gorger Residue&lt;/a&gt; buff. The buff grants the player's jumps a chance to proc the 5-second Leaping Legs debuff, allowing them to execute up to three greatly enhanced jumps, even while in mid-air. The jumps can be used whether mounted or unmounted, and can be chained together to reach otherwise unreachable locations. Additionally, no fall damage will result from falling following one of these jumps, even if the player falls far further than the jumps themselves carried the character.\nThe Leaping Gorger corpse itself is an object that rarely spawns in one of two locations in Molten Quarry. For precise locations, see &lt;a href=\"http%3A//wod.wowhead.com/npc%3D84465\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The Gorger spawns as a corpse and does not need to be killed.\nPower Geodes.\n&lt;a href=\"Power%20Geode\"&gt;Power Geode&lt;/a&gt;s are extremely weak, neutral mobs found around the Quarry. Killing them grants the &lt;a href=\"Power%20Geode%20%28buff%29\"&gt;Power Geode buff&lt;/a&gt;, a non-stacking buff that increases all damage and healing done by 100% for 20 seconds. Stacks with the effects of the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Artifact\"&gt;Ancient Artifact&lt;/a&gt;. The Geodes can often be killed with a single attack, and can be very useful for increasing damage output while farming other mobs in the area, or to respond to greater threats.\nGoren Eggs.\nGoren Eggs are lootable objects that can be found lying about the landscape. These generally contain only &lt;a href=\"Artifact%20Fragment\"&gt;Artifact Fragment&lt;/a&gt;s, although other items can sometimes be found.\nTrivia.\nAn of Ashran shows this area marked as \"Quarry/Mine\". During &lt;a href=\"Warlords%20of%20Draenor%20beta%20timeline\"&gt;the expansion's beta&lt;/a&gt;, it was known simply as \"The Quarry\"."}

Though ultimately loyal to Ragnaros, the giants are kept in line by the heavy-handed rule of .\nThese elementals are powerful, unpredictable and violent. The summoning and controlling of molten giants is forbidden by the &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt;, as the use of such coercion could anger the elements and trigger an event similar to the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;.

Small glowing yellow eyes peer out of a massive red stone skull. In fact, this creature's entire body is formed from chunks of red stone, even what appears to be a beard or mane. Its arms and legs are thick pillars of rock, and every inch is covered with molten veins.\nMolten giants are the brutal and cunning front-line defenders of Ragnaros' army. They view themselves as an autonomous society, serving their &lt;a href=\"flamewaker\"&gt;flamewaker&lt;/a&gt; masters and even &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; himself only by choice. The truth is they could not leave his service if they wanted to, but they are a proud race and refuse to believe otherwise. Molten giants are opportunistic among their own kind. Their leaders continually jockey for position within their ranks and seek favor with the flamewaker nobility. Molten giants speak Kalimag.\nMolten giants stand toe-to-toe with foes, slamming and bashing until each opponent in turn stops moving. When molten giants fight in pairs, one sometimes uses a war stomp while the other slams prone victims. If lava is present, as it often is near a molten giant settlement, molten giants attempt to bull rush victims into it. A molten giant generates so much heat that its mere touch deals additional fire damage. Its body deals extra fire damage whenever it hits in melee. A molten giant's metallic weapons also conduct this heat. Molten giants generally wield huge stone greatclubs. Stone clubs conduct only half the heat."}

He hoped the demons would be pleased and reward him with greater power. To that end, sought to establish a secret base near &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; to further the Legion's goals. He used &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; to disguise himself as a &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard\"&gt;Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; dwarf and headed to &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt; to search for an appropriate spot. After a few days, he discovered a cave that was perfect for his purposes. Natural geography hid it from the eyes of travelers and explorers, and it was large enough to comfortably house a small army of nascent warlocks and to carry out his experiments; however, a problem presented itself: The cave was already in use. A necromancer, &lt;a href=\"Toren%20Snapjoint\"&gt;Toren Snapjoint&lt;/a&gt;, was in the cave. Toren had two &lt;a href=\"acolyte\"&gt;acolyte&lt;/a&gt;s with him as well. Molus kept tabs on Toren for a couple of weeks and saw him raid the local graveyards and animate the dead as &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s. Toren also slew some traveling dwarves but Molus managed to hide the bodies before anyone discovered them.\nMolus worried that if Toren was not careful, Ironforge would soon discover his dealings and would be on high alert for other dark magic. It also angered him that Toren was a servant of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, who had betrayed Molus's masters of the Burning Legion. Molus had one option: Destroy Toren, quickly and quietly, and take the necromancer's cave as his base. Molus did not relish the idea of facing Toren alone though. While disguised as Lugni Scopewol, he hired a group of adventurers, including &lt;a href=\"Widge%20Whistlevalve\"&gt;Widge Whistlevalve&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jarlath%20Brewbelly\"&gt;Jarlath Brewbelly&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Botrek%20Pahno\"&gt;Botrek Pahno&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cerise%20Moonrain\"&gt;Cerise Moonrain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maith%27hal\"&gt;Maith'hal&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Yinny\"&gt;Yinny&lt;/a&gt;, to go in and take care of the problem for him.\nAfter they defeated Toren, Molus entered the cave, no longer disguised, with some hired muscle. He attacked the heroes who were weakened from their previous encounter. The group managed to defeat Molus through a great effort."}

Your current total is shown at the bottom right of your open &lt;a href=\"backpack\"&gt;backpack&lt;/a&gt; window.

If you use money to put a deposit down for auctioning an item, you lose the deposit if it doesn't sell or if you cancel the auction, but any failed bids are returned via mail.\nTypes of coins.\n\"Coin\" as a term can also refer to the currency of \"World of Warcraft\", though its use is mostly limited to quest givers giving out monetary rewards to players.\nConversion rates.\nNOTE: You can never have more than \u2014 if you get to , it will automatically change to in the silver column. The same is true when you get to , if you add another copper then it will automatically change to . There is no conversion rate for gold coins, so you may have more than .\nTechnical considerations.\nThe amount of money on a server is not constant. From a technical point of view, money can be \"created\" (i.e., added to the player economy) and \"destroyed\" (removed from the player economy).\nMoney is \"created\" when:\nMoney is \"destroyed\" when:\nMoney is also traded between players in exchange for items and services, but this does not itself affect the amount of money in circulation.\nWhile leveling a character, a player naturally \"creates\" hundreds of gold, though much of it is \"destroyed/spent\" by repair costs and personal spendings.\nSince a character starts with no money, it is clear that a perfectly new server has no money in circulation. As the server ages, money will be \"created\" at a greater rate, as players kill mobs (monsters) that drop more money and do quest with larger rewards.\nHowever, the amount of money \"destroyed\" also increases with age: players obtain better gear which has higher repair cost, and more players raid which means more total repairs, as raiding increases the average players' chance of death. As the economy matures, Auction House activity increases, with the House taking a 5-15% commission on each sale. Older servers also see an increased significant one-time destruction's of money as people buy increased riding skills and expensive mounts.\nDeflation.\nThere is also economic deflation on many realms since &lt;a href=\"gold%20farmer\"&gt;gold farmer&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"bot\"&gt;bot&lt;/a&gt;s have a dramatic effect on the local realm economy by selling items at reduced price on the Auction House. This is equally annoying to players as it means their own item value decreases over time. The launch of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;The Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;\" patch had a predictable effect on the economy, as many level 70 players now had gold reserves in excess of 10,000 where before few players would have seen more than 1 or 2 thousand after quite some time at level 60. Auction house prices soared as a result, and &lt;a href=\"twink\"&gt;twink&lt;/a&gt; items were even higher in price than usual. Another effect of the patch was that the market became flooded with \"high\"-level (level 60) items such as &lt;a href=\"Brilliant%20Chromatic%20Scale\"&gt;Brilliant Chromatic Scale&lt;/a&gt; which was already declining in price on certain realms pre-TBC. Since then these items are now worth much less than they were pre-TBC which has meant players who weren't able to sell them before the expansion have missed out on quite a lot of gold. Of course, the average wealth isn't affected by auction-house transactions, but a lot of players have been put out by the fluctuating prices.\nGold farmers and bots do not only affect the economy via the prices of items but also via the large amounts of gold they make (hence the name \"gold farmer\"). They have various ways of making gold; the Auction House merely being one of them. On February 21, 2008, Blizzard reported in an announcement regarding &lt;a href=\"gold%20buying\"&gt;gold buying&lt;/a&gt; that an \"alarmingly high\" proportion of all gold bought originates from hacked accounts.\nControl by Blizzard.\nBlizzard often steps in to control the amount of gold in the game, usually in response to the excessive amounts of gold generated by gold farmers and bots. While gold selling and other similar actions such as character selling is illegal, Blizzard has also stated that the economy resulting from it negatively affects the gameplay of the players. An example is their announcement on October 12, 2006, in which they stated that they had banned over 76,000 accounts and removed 11 million gold from game economies in Europe, Korea, and the US during September. This was a continuation from previous incidents the same year in which Blizzard banned 59,000 accounts with 22 million gold in July and 30,000 accounts and 30 million gold in May.\nOther methods of control include the &lt;a href=\"gold%20sink\"&gt;gold sink&lt;/a&gt;. The term usually describes a system or factor which effectively \"destroys\" money, controlling the economy by preventing the in-game amount of money to accumulate out of control. An example would be the &lt;a href=\"Mekgineer%27s%20Chopper\"&gt;Mekgineer's Chopper&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Mechano-Hog\"&gt;Mechano-Hog&lt;/a&gt; which both require over 12,000 gold to craft. Another example would be the &lt;a href=\"Reins%20of%20the%20Traveler%27s%20Tundra%20Mammoth\"&gt;Reins of the Traveler's Tundra Mammoth&lt;/a&gt; which at minimum costs 14,000 gold. &lt;a href=\"Mount\"&gt;Mount&lt;/a&gt;s have been popular gold sinks to date, due to their high visibility and unique look or properties; the Traveler's Tundra Mammoth, for example, is not only one of the few multi-player mounts, but also one of the few mounts that carries vendors who can buy junk, perform repairs, and sell food or reagents. This was continued with the &lt;a href=\"%3AReins%20of%20the%20Grand%20Expedition%20Yak\"&gt;:Reins of the Grand Expedition Yak&lt;/a&gt; in \"Mists of Pandaria\" that carries vendors who can buy junk, perform repairs, sell reagents and &lt;a href=\"reforging\"&gt;reforging&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Mists%20of%20Pandaria\"&gt;Mists of Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;\" introduced another gold sink in the form of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Market%20Auction%20House\"&gt;Black Market Auction House&lt;/a&gt;. Despite the name, this is not player-run like the faction Auction Houses, but rather a group of NPC vendors who sell rare or discontinued items to the highest bidder. Exceptionally rare items could remove hundreds of thousands of gold from the system.\nEconomy summary.\nThe WoW economy will always fluctuate, and large events such as the Burning Crusade launch will have a knock-on effect. The best advice to any player worried about an economic decline on their realm is not to buy any gold from gold sellers, as this will have a worse effect on the economy. Also, make sure you price your auctions based on market-value and not just stab-in-the-dark wishwork.\nAlthough it is technically against the ToS to affect other's gameplay in a negative way (including the economy), it's generally accepted that under-pricing doesn't count as it doesn't affect the average wealth of players on your realm. It's also generally accepted that underpricing is very annoying, since other players will find it difficult to sell items at the correct price, and it may even lower the value of the item you're selling. Slight underpricing (up to around 10% of market value off) is acceptable, however.\nAlthough little is known about the actual average WoW player's wealth, there is much speculation about it and wherever you look you'll find a different figure. Blizzard has yet to publish anything regarding the economic status of any of the servers in any country.\nGold limit.\nThe most money a single character can carry is ; the same limit applies to guild banks. Prior to &lt;a href=\"patch%207.0.3\"&gt;patch 7.0.3&lt;/a&gt;, the limit for both was .\nBefore &lt;a href=\"patch%204.0.1\"&gt;patch 4.0.1&lt;/a&gt;, the limit had been (or ) because Blizzard stored a character's money as a signed 32-bit integer.\nHistory.\nMined from the rich earth of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28continent%29\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; is commonly used as coins in exchange for goods and services. As a rare substance that is always in short supply, gold must be dug out from the rock and soil within established &lt;a href=\"gold%20mine\"&gt;gold mine&lt;/a&gt;s. Many of these mines were abandoned when the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; raids began and the workers fled for their very lives. Since the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, these sites are frequently operated while under the protection of military forces. Gold was scarce in Lordaeron, even in the height of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;'s power.\n&lt;a href=\"Goblin\"&gt;Goblin&lt;/a&gt;s call their currency &lt;a href=\"macaroon\"&gt;macaroon&lt;/a&gt;s, and they refer to money as moolah.\n&lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;'s coinage has traditionally been the copper penny, the silver groat, and the gold sovereign.\nIn the RPG.\nIn the past, all coinage was in gold. After three wars, silver and copper have come into use. Platinum coinage has not come to use yet. The &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; enjoys marring &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; minted coins creating \"cross-eyed coins\u201d which is a sign of treason to the throne. Some coins that are not minted any longer are worth more to some people."}

Monks are able to perform each of the three group &lt;a href=\"role\"&gt;role&lt;/a&gt;s via different &lt;a href=\"specialization\"&gt;specialization&lt;/a&gt;s: &lt;a href=\"%23Brewmaster\"&gt;Brewmaster&lt;/a&gt; monks &lt;a href=\"tank\"&gt;tank&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"%23Mistweaver\"&gt;Mistweaver&lt;/a&gt; monks &lt;a href=\"healer%20%28role%29\"&gt;heal&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"%23Windwalker\"&gt;Windwalker&lt;/a&gt; monks &lt;a href=\"damage%20%28role%29\"&gt;deal damage&lt;/a&gt; using melee abilities. &lt;a href=\"Energy\"&gt;Energy&lt;/a&gt; is the primary resource of Brewmaster and Windwalker monks (whom also use Chi as a secondary resource), while Mistweavers use &lt;a href=\"mana\"&gt;mana&lt;/a&gt; instead. Monks are available to every race except &lt;a href=\"Dracthyr%20%28playable%29\"&gt;Dracthyr&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhatever their combat role, monks rely mainly on their hands and feet to do the talking, and on a strong connection with their inner &lt;a href=\"chi\"&gt;chi&lt;/a&gt; to power their abilities. Abilities such as &lt;a href=\"Expel%20Harm\"&gt;Expel Harm&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chi%20Wave\"&gt;Chi Wave&lt;/a&gt; heal their allies while at the same time damaging their enemies.\nClass overview.\n\"When the pandaren were subjugated by the mogu centuries ago, it was the monks that brought hope to a seemingly dim future. Restricted from using weapons by their slave masters, these pandaren instead focused on harnessing their chi and learning weaponless combat. When the opportunity for revolution struck, they were well-trained to throw off the yoke of oppression.\"\n\"Masters of bare-handed combat, monks never rely solely on the need to have a weapon in their hands to defend against their enemies. Although most widely known to the outside world for their fearsome jabs and flying kicks, they refuse to limit themselves to a single method of combat. Many monks prefer instead to \u201csoak it up\u201d and seem to revel in the intoxicating effect of absorbing blow after blow while their companions press the attack. Other monks specialize in calling upon the restorative power of the mists to balance the good and bad energy within people, returning them to good health and fortune.\"\n\"Monks bring a unique martial arts style to any fight, and harness an exotic form of magical energy that\u2019s unfamiliar to those who practice other arcane arts. They seek spiritual balance in life and in combat, and as dangerous as Monks can be on the battlefield, they\u2019re rarely looking to pick a fight without just cause. They view the world through a different lens, finding power through serenity and inner peace\u2014then expressing it through artful combat techniques and powers that mend life. Perhaps most surprisingly, Monks are also adept at producing powerful brews they consume to aid them in battle.\"\nBackground.\nNearly 12,000 years ago, long before the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, the continent now known as &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; was ruled by a monstrous race of warlords known as the &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt;. Their reign was incredibly harsh and brutal. Mogu taskmasters forbade their slaves to carry weapons. During these dark times, many pandaren tried to lift the spirits of their beleaguered brothers and sisters. They were the storytellers, the brewmasters, and the healers who helped knit their oppressed society together in the midst of darkness.\nAs the mogu empire began to fray, the pandaren saw an opportunity for a revolution. Because they had no weapons, they trained common people to fight with their unarmed fists and feet. They mastered the use of positive energy - or 'chi' - to empower themselves. These unarmed resistance fighters would become the first monks.\nFor the history of the spread of the ways of the monk to the other races, see &lt;a href=\"Monk%20races\"&gt;Monk races&lt;/a&gt;.\nDespite both using the &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20of%20Life\"&gt;Spirit of Life&lt;/a&gt;, monks are differentiated from &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;s in their inability to ask the elements for help.\nRaces.\nThe monk class can be played by all races except &lt;a href=\"Dracthyr%20%28playable%29\"&gt;dracthyr&lt;/a&gt;:\nRacial abilities.\nBelow is a brief exploration of some of the &lt;a href=\"racial%20trait\"&gt;racial trait&lt;/a&gt;s most relevant to monks. For a full list, see &lt;a href=\"Racial%20trait\"&gt;Racial trait&lt;/a&gt;. \nSpecializations.\nBrewmaster.\n A sturdy brawler who uses liquid fortification and unpredictable movement to avoid damage and protect allies. \nBrewmasters are capable &lt;a href=\"tank\"&gt;tank&lt;/a&gt;s who use a combination of ancient martial arts techniques and drunken taunts to draw the attacks of their enemies and soak up damage. Brewmasters absorb and stagger damage, while provoking their enemies with traditional brewing-based attacks.\n\"The brewmaster is a quirky character, though dangerous when underestimated. Brewmasters may seem to struggle with balance as they chug their concoctions in the middle of a fight, but this unpredictable behavior is far from foolhardiness. Most opponents barely have time to process the erratic nature of the brewmaster\u2019s fighting tactics before they find themselves laid low\u2014possibly the result of a keg smash to the head. When an opponent actually manages to land an attack, it\u2019s often unclear how much the brewmaster feels it . . . if at all.\"\nMistweaver.\n A healer who mixes traditional herbal medicine with Pandaren martial arts.\nMistweavers are &lt;a href=\"healer%20%28role%29\"&gt;healers&lt;/a&gt; with a sideline in damage dealing. As well as a range of traditional healing techniques, Mistweavers may also use melee range attacks to increase the effect of their healing spells, through certain combinations such as &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Focus%20Tea\"&gt;Thunder Focus Tea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rising%20Thunder\"&gt;Rising Thunder,&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rising%20Sun%20Kick\"&gt;Rising Sun Kick&lt;/a&gt; resulting in unique gameplay. Mistweaver monks gain &lt;a href=\"mana\"&gt;mana&lt;/a&gt; as a primary resource, in place of &lt;a href=\"energy\"&gt;energy&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Mistweavers are unique among those who heal. The energies they channel are mysterious, oftentimes misunderstood by commoners\u2014who rarely travel beyond the borders of their homelands\u2014as some form of folk medicine. But those who weave the mists wield the power of life\u2019s essence, using a mixture of preventative and restorative spells to mend their allies\u2019 wounds. The inner tranquility that guides mistweavers allows them to sustain their healing for long periods of time, and gives them the strength to care for multiple injured allies.\"\nWindwalker.\n A martial artist without peer who pummels foes with hands and fists.\nWindwalkers are &lt;a href=\"damage%20%28role%29\"&gt;damage dealers&lt;/a&gt;, focusing on dealing melee damage through a range of martial arts abilities. With their lightning kicks and furious fists, Windwalkers can pummel nearby foes, but also have some ranged attacks and can use their legendary abilities to move swiftly across the battlefield. In addition to Energy, Windwalker Monks use Chi as a secondary resource.\n\"Among monks, none have mastered the martial arts as the windwalkers have, and few across Azeroth can fight with their grace. Windwalkers possess unparalleled physical finesse, and are capable of overwhelming their enemies with a dizzying flurry of punches and kicks. Their skill comes primarily from a lifetime of intense training and discipline, but the power they exhibit is shrouded in more mysticism than meets the untrained eye. The combination of their peak physical conditioning, state of inner calm, and leveraging of mystical chi makes windwalker monks a true force to be reckoned with.\"\nAbilities.\nBrewmaster and Windwalker abilities are influenced by real life martial arts style, such as a form of Wushu, commonly known as Drunken Boxing, which inspired some of the Brewmaster's animations. Other Brewmaster abilities such as &lt;a href=\"Keg%20Smash\"&gt;Keg Smash&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ironskin%20Brew\"&gt;Ironskin Brew&lt;/a&gt; further this fantasy (even though Wushu does not involve actual drinking). Mistweavers typically focus on maintaining the balance of life energy around them, calling upon the mists to heal their allies and disorient their foes. In addition to these fantasies, each specialization revolves around an &lt;a href=\"August%20Celestial\"&gt;August Celestial&lt;/a&gt;; Brewmasters revere &lt;a href=\"Niuzao\"&gt;Niuzao&lt;/a&gt;, Windwalkers fight with the fury of &lt;a href=\"Xuen\"&gt;Xuen&lt;/a&gt;, and Mistweavers call upon the aid of &lt;a href=\"Yu%27lon\"&gt;Yu'lon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chi-Ji\"&gt;Chi-Ji&lt;/a&gt;.\nGear.\nMonks can wear &lt;a href=\"cloth\"&gt;cloth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"leather\"&gt;leather&lt;/a&gt; armor.\nMonks mainly focus on &lt;a href=\"fist%20weapon\"&gt;fist weapon&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"staves\"&gt;staves&lt;/a&gt;, but can also use one-handed &lt;a href=\"sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt;s, one-handed &lt;a href=\"mace\"&gt;mace&lt;/a&gt;s, one-handed &lt;a href=\"axe\"&gt;axe&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"polearm\"&gt;polearm&lt;/a&gt;s.\nIn the RPG.\nMonks are culturally considered ascetic and studious. When &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt; is in humanoid form, he takes the shape of a studious monk or similar individual. &lt;a href=\"Pandaren\"&gt;Pandaren&lt;/a&gt; are formidable monks, following their philosophies to the letter and perfecting their martial arts as they see fit. &lt;a href=\"Runemaster\"&gt;Runemaster&lt;/a&gt;s are said to be monk-like as well.\nRPG notes.\nMonks were initially a in the original Warcraft RPG sourcebook, at the time believed not to be relevant to the \"Warcraft\" world. However, monks were later incorporated through the &lt;a href=\"runemaster\"&gt;runemaster&lt;/a&gt;, and references to monks appear throughout various points in RPG lore as well as in \"World of Warcraft\". However (at the time), no specific monk class was ever created in the RPG, and no specific lore was ever given.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

The village, led by &lt;a href=\"Akama\"&gt;Akama&lt;/a&gt;, was suffering under attacks by the &lt;a href=\"fel%20orc\"&gt;fel orc&lt;/a&gt;s serving &lt;a href=\"Magtheridon\"&gt;Magtheridon&lt;/a&gt; in the area. Illidan and &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;his forces&lt;/a&gt; decided to help the draenei in order to gain their support against Magtheridon. After crushing the fel orc base nearest to the village, the draenei accepted to join his side. This was the first time Illidan met Akama, and likely the first time Akama and his soldiers received any form of reinforcements.\nThe mission which these events unfold in is titled \"&lt;a href=\"Gates%20of%20the%20Abyss\"&gt;Gates of the Abyss&lt;/a&gt;\" and is chapter five of \"&lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20the%20Blood%20Elves\"&gt;Curse of the Blood Elves&lt;/a&gt;\" - the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elf&lt;/a&gt;) campaign in \"\".\nLocation.\nAs seen from the Warcraft III Outland map, this was actually just one of three draenei villages in the vicinity. It is, however, very difficult to estimate where they were located, how far it was between them, and which of them was discovered by Illidan, due to the related to the map. However, much of the events that occurred in Outland during the events of \"The Frozen Throne\" have been &lt;a href=\"Retcon%20speculation\"&gt;retconned&lt;/a&gt; to have been set in &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Valley\"&gt;Shadowmoon Valley&lt;/a&gt;, which seem to be the same also regards to this village, given that the &lt;a href=\"Dimensional%20gateway\"&gt;Dimensional Gateways&lt;/a&gt; present in the chapter \"&lt;a href=\"Gates%20of%20the%20Abyss\"&gt;Gates of the Abyss&lt;/a&gt;\" were located near the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt; to reinforce Magtheridon's positions. \nThe Warcraft III-draenei's usage of giant mushrooms to build their houses is also similar to &lt;a href=\"Telredor\"&gt;Telredor&lt;/a&gt; in World of Warcraft.\nQuest.\nSaving the draenei village is actually an optional mission. It will be available as soon as the player discovers the village. Akama will still join Illidan in his next chapter to defeat Magtheridon whether you complete this quest or not.\nQuotes related to the quest.\nDiscovering the village:\nAfter the orange fel orc base have been defeated:\nFreed draenei prisoners (found in camps around on the map):"}

{"id": "68818", "revid": "38791128", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=68818", "title": "Draenei controversy", "text": "Please note: The following article was largely written prior to the introduction of the draenei as a playable race for \"World of Warcraft\". It is kept for historical purposes, documenting the reaction of some of the player-base to the race's introduction as part of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;The Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThere has been confusion relating to the new lore for the &lt;a href=\"draenei%20%28playable%29\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;. \nDraenei origin and relations.\nThe revelation that they are an offshoot of the &lt;a href=\"eredar\"&gt;eredar&lt;/a&gt; was bewildering to some fans, as was the idea that &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; corrupted the eredar as opposed to the other way round. However, while Sargeras's corruption of the eredar is a &lt;a href=\"retcon\"&gt;retcon&lt;/a&gt;, it should be noted that the draenei-eredar relationship is \"not\". Except in the case of the &lt;a href=\"lost%20ones\"&gt;lost ones&lt;/a&gt;.\nDimensional ship.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Dimensional%20Ship\"&gt;Dimensional Ship&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Tempest%20Keep\"&gt;Tempest Keep&lt;/a&gt; was also controversial, as some fans considered the concept more at home in sci-fi than fantasy. \nIn a post on the \"World of Warcraft\" forums, &lt;a href=\"Chris%20Metzen\"&gt;Metzen&lt;/a&gt; apologized for the difficulties the new lore created, but stood by his revisions, believing that this version grounds the draenei and the eredar more firmly in WarCraft lore (he admitted that he simply forgot the eredar were already demons before they met Sargeras). Metzen also claimed that the new dimensional ship lore would not be too similar to science-fiction \"spacecraft,\" with enough of a twist to make it work in a fantasy environment. The ship does not travel through \"outer space\" (referred to as the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark\"&gt;Great Dark&lt;/a&gt; in Warcraft lore). It instead teleports between &lt;a href=\"world\"&gt;world&lt;/a&gt;s using the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;. Therefore it is inaccurate to say the draenei are in any way related to outer space. \nIt could in some ways be compared to the teleportation spells of the mage, on a much larger scale. Also, many are quick to forget that the ship is of naaru origin, and actually has little to do with the draenei. However, with escape pods and a great deal of in game information about flying the ship between worlds and crashing into the planet many players feel this is simply a cover up.\nShaman.\nThe most recent addition to controversy surrounding the draenei race has been the recent choice of Blizzard to allow draenei, an &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; race, to become &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; (a class previously limited to &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; characters). As a matter of balance, they are allowing the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; race, to become &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s (a class previously limited to &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; characters). The decision for draenei to become shamans actually helps clarify the role of the shamans and the &lt;a href=\"elemental%20spirit\"&gt;elemental spirit&lt;/a&gt;s in the lore and the fight to stop the Burning Crusade.\nPronunciation.\nIn \"\", and the \"&lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;\" beta, the race's name is pronounced with a short initial vowel sound and the accent on the first syllable: 'dra-nI. (see &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.m-w.com/help/pronguide.htm\"&gt;this guide&lt;/a&gt;)\nIn forum post on 6th October 2006, &lt;a href=\"Nethaera\"&gt;Nethaera&lt;/a&gt; has given the official pronunciation to be \"dran eye\". &lt;a href=\"http%3A//blue.cardplace.com/newcache/us/32154031.htm\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\nVarious alternative pronunciations have also been heard or described:\nThe female playable draenei makes fun of the difficulty in pronunciation in one of her &lt;a href=\"Joke\"&gt;\"/silly\" quotes&lt;/a&gt;: \"Why does everyone have trouble with the name of our people? It sounds just like it is spelled.\"\nDimorphism.\nAn article in Wired criticized the &lt;a href=\"http%3A//blog.wired.com/underwire/2007/05/sexual_dimorphi.html\"&gt;immense dimorphism&lt;/a&gt; in the species, asserting that female draenei more closely resemble blood elves than their own kinsmen."}

It was a large, fertile world dominated by vast plains, dense forests, and lush swamps. Besides the orcs and draenei it was originally home to many other intelligent humanoid races, including the ancient, bird-like &lt;a href=\"arakkoa\"&gt;arakkoa&lt;/a&gt;; the mighty &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s and their brutal &lt;a href=\"gronn\"&gt;gronn&lt;/a&gt; masters; and the aggressive tree-men known as &lt;a href=\"botani\"&gt;botani&lt;/a&gt;.\nDue to the corruption of &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt;, during the last days of its life, Draenor was a transformed world. Now a barren husk of badlands and hardscrabble vegetation, all under a blood-red sky, the planet was referred to as the Red World. When the orc &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; recklessly opened dimensional portals to find new worlds to conquer, Draenor was torn apart and believed completely lost. However, a large fragment of the world remained intact. That fragment is known today as &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nGrond and the Evergrowth.\nDraenor formed without a &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"world-soul\"&gt;world-soul&lt;/a&gt;. Abundant in the element of &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20%28lore%29\"&gt;Spirit&lt;/a&gt;, life flourished, creating a savage ecosystem with a fierce and competitive food chain. At the top of the food chain was a carnivorous plant species known as the &lt;a href=\"Sporemound\"&gt;Sporemound&lt;/a&gt;s, which would eventually gain communal sentience with the rest of Draenor's plant life after tapping into the Spirit that suffused the planet's soil, becoming collectively known as the &lt;a href=\"Evergrowth\"&gt;Evergrowth&lt;/a&gt;. If any major threat arose, the Evergrowth reacted in unison. However, such threats were non-existent, for the Evergrowth dominated everything in sight.\nWhen the titan &lt;a href=\"Aggramar\"&gt;Aggramar&lt;/a&gt; came across Draenor in his travels, he was intrigued by the world, but foresaw its doom at the unchecked expansion of the Evergrowth. Unwilling to leave Draenor to its fate, yet unable to combat the Evergrowth himself lest he risk damaging the world itself, Aggramar knew that he would need to neutralize the Sporemounds, the heart of the Evergrowth's power. This led to Aggramar's creation of &lt;a href=\"Grond\"&gt;Grond&lt;/a&gt;, a mighty servant formed from a mountain in the titan's image. Grond began marching across the world to conquer the Evergrowth, conquering the Sporemounds and tearing them from the earth. \nMere roots would not topple Grond; instead, the Sporemounds began to adapt. Draining the life essence of the surrounding forests and jungles, three Sporemounds arose and walked to face Grond: &lt;a href=\"Zang\"&gt;Zang&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Naanu\"&gt;Naanu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Botaan\"&gt;Botaan&lt;/a&gt;. Although the Evergrowth allowed the three Sporemounds to fight in unison, Grond's elemental might allowed him to crush Zang and Naanu. Zang's corpse would become the &lt;a href=\"Zangar%20Sea\"&gt;Zangar Sea&lt;/a&gt;, and Naanu became &lt;a href=\"Tanaan%20Jungle\"&gt;Tanaan Jungle&lt;/a&gt;. \nDespite these victories, Grond began to weaken, and eventually fell to the last Sporemound, Botaan. Grond's body crumbled, and much of his corpse then formed a mountain range at the edge of a region that would later be called &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt;.\nGrond's death also released the primordial elemental energies that once gave him life, allowing the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20spirit\"&gt;elemental spirits&lt;/a&gt; of Draenor to take physical form. The greatest among the elementals, the &lt;a href=\"Furies\"&gt;Furies&lt;/a&gt;, would come to dwell near the remains of Grond's head, which would become known as the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20the%20Elements\"&gt;Throne of the Elements&lt;/a&gt;.\nOther life arose from the battles between Grond and the Sporemounds, from the pieces that fell as the battling parties wounded one another. From the pieces of the Sporemounds emerged a number of plant beings, the most powerful of which were the &lt;a href=\"genesaur\"&gt;genesaur&lt;/a&gt;. The debris that fell off Grond became the &lt;a href=\"Colossal\"&gt;colossals&lt;/a&gt;, who, with Aggramar's aid, would continue Grond's fight against Botaan and the new genesaur in the titan's absence. From the bodies of fallen colossals, the &lt;a href=\"magnaron\"&gt;magnaron&lt;/a&gt; arose, and though they felt no loyalty towards their progenitors, still opposed the Evergrowth and fought the genesaur that crossed their paths. \nAfter millennia of constant fighting, the remaining colossals launched a final, suicidal attack on Botaan using titan relics given to them by Aggramar to aid in their battles. The resulting explosion destroyed both parties, scattering their remains. The remains of the colossals sank into the earth and formed veins of &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Ore\"&gt;blackrock ore&lt;/a&gt;, and Botaan's corpse would become the region of &lt;a href=\"Farahlon\"&gt;Farahlon&lt;/a&gt;, the communal sentience of the Evergrowth finally destroyed.\nIn the years to follow, new beings would arise from those created from the bodies of the colossals and the Sporemounds. When Botaan died, it released spores infused with the Spirit of Life, changing elemental beings into flesh and blood. This would lead to the rise of the &lt;a href=\"gronn\"&gt;gronn&lt;/a&gt;, then the &lt;a href=\"ogron\"&gt;ogron&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Ogre\"&gt;ogres&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;orcs&lt;/a&gt;. From the forests and jungles touched by Botaan's spores came plant creatures, such as the &lt;a href=\"Podling\"&gt;podlings&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sporeling\"&gt;sporelings&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"botani\"&gt;botani&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis era would later be known as the &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Colossals\"&gt;Age of Colossals&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Apexis.\nThe &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s believed that they were the first beings to be created by the Titans (or \"Forgers\", as they call them), shaped from burning slag when the god-like beings squeezed the light from the great ball of fire that was Draenor.\nLong ago, the &lt;a href=\"arakkoa\"&gt;arakkoa&lt;/a&gt; were created by the god &lt;a href=\"Rukhmar\"&gt;Rukhmar&lt;/a&gt; atop &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Gorgrond's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Vortex%20Summit\"&gt;highest peak&lt;/a&gt;. She taught them about the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; and told them stories of &lt;a href=\"Anzu\"&gt;Anzu&lt;/a&gt;, who they also worshiped, and from the stories they also began to practice the &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt;. She always intended on them returning to &lt;a href=\"Spires%20of%20Arak\"&gt;Arak&lt;/a&gt;, her homeland for which the arakkoa were named, and as she grew old she led them there, three thousand years before the opening of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;. But just as they reached Arak, Rukhmar breathed her last breath. Flames consumed her form and she burned like a second sun in the sky. The arakkoa saw Rukhmar's passing as a sign of their ascendancy. They vowed to create a grand civilization that would outshine any other culture on Draenor in order to honor her. The light of their knowledge and their power would blaze in the heavens just as Rukhmar had.\nCalling themselves the &lt;a href=\"Apexis\"&gt;Apexis&lt;/a&gt;, the arakkoa claimed the highest reaches of Arak's spire. They harvested timber from the surrounding woods and metals from the nearby mountains and built illustrious gilded structures around their new home. Using their mastery of the Light, the Apexis crafted enormous lanterns burning with enchanted flames that hung along the length of the spire. Guided by tales of Anzu and his noble sacrifice, arakkoa sorcerers investigated the &lt;a href=\"Sethekk%20Hollow\"&gt;Sethekk Hollow&lt;/a&gt;. By carefully studying the cursed pools, they unraveled the mysteries of shadow magic and developed the unique ability to combine the arcane with the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;. Embracing both Light and Void, the Apexis believed they were both natural parts of life. Two factions formed within the Apexis: the &lt;a href=\"Anhar\"&gt;Anhar&lt;/a&gt; order studied holy magic, while the &lt;a href=\"Skalax\"&gt;Skalax&lt;/a&gt; studied shadow and arcane magics. Both groups occupied the upper echelons of arakkoa society, sharing equal prestige and influence.\nAs the arakkoa solidified their power in Arak, they also began to explore the rest of Draenor; though not expansionists, they were curious. Outposts were forged across the land to observe local flora and fauna, and by studying and mapping the forests and mountains they were in awe when they realized that many of these were the &lt;a href=\"Grond\"&gt;remains&lt;/a&gt; of ancient &lt;a href=\"Sporemound\"&gt;creatures&lt;/a&gt; that had once walked Draenor. Based on stories from Rukhmar, the Apexis realized the &lt;a href=\"Primals\"&gt;Primals&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Breakers\"&gt;Breakers&lt;/a&gt; were the primordial giants' offspring. They watched the endless warring between the two with pity and fascination. However, they never intervened; they had inherited a touch of Rukhmar's arrogance and to play a part in the lives of land-dwellers was seen as beneath the Apexis.\nTwo thousand years before the opening of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, the Apexis developed a device called the &lt;a href=\"Breath%20of%20Rukhmar\"&gt;Breath of Rukhmar&lt;/a&gt; that harnessed the sun's energy into incredible destructive power to combat the &lt;a href=\"Primals\"&gt;Primals&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Sporemound\"&gt;Sporemound&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Taala\"&gt;Taala&lt;/a&gt; when they encroached on Arak.\nCenturies after defeating the Evergrowth and 1,200 years before the opening of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, the Apexis had flourished into an empire and their population had swelled. They saw themselves as the most powerful force in the world, that not even the mightiest of Primals had been able to contend with. With nothing to threaten them, the Apexis dedicated themselves to the advancement of science and magic, and knowledge became their culture's most coveted resource. The Anhar and Skalax became the caretakers of wisdom with the duty of cataloging history, the study of magic, and information about the world and its various creatures. Rather than keeping this knowledge in tomes or scrolls, the Anhari and Skalaxi sorcerers combined their magic to develop &lt;a href=\"Apexis%20Crystal%20%28item%29\"&gt;Apexis crystals&lt;/a&gt;. By merely touching one of the crystals, an arakkoa would consume all of the knowledge contained within and even experience the memories of whoever had crafted it.\nThe Apexis applied their magics to the creation of &lt;a href=\"Apexis%20guardian\"&gt;mechanical constructs&lt;/a&gt; that would do their bidding. The arakkoa had always been arrogant, and they had become even more so after their victory. They deemed those who walked the surface to be unclean and used their constructs to mine and gather other resources from the ground.\nDuring the height of Apexis culture, a small group of Anhari priests sought out the remains of Rukhmar. They found her charred bones near the spire, and they used their magics to resurrect her. But it was only a partial success. This new Rukhmar had only a sliver of the original's power and intelligence. Nonetheless, the Apexis worshiped her as their goddess reborn. The Anhari infused her with their Light powers, granting her a long life so she could soar the skies for millennia.\nThe Anhari priests constructed a gleaming sun temple around the Breath of Rukhmar used centuries before. Hundreds of arakkoa gathered each year to commemorate the Apexis victory and honor Rukhmar. Other arakkoa visited shrines carved into the solid rock near the foot of the spire where the Skalaxi sorcerers performed rituals to honor Anzu and his ancient sacrifice. Though Apexis culture seemed destined to continue its rise, a rivalry developed between the Anhar and Skalax as each vied for the support of the greater populace. The Anhari knew that to seize power they would need to control knowledge. Their leader &lt;a href=\"Priest-Lord%20Velthreek\"&gt;Priest-Lord Velthreek&lt;/a&gt; order his followers to gather as many Apexis crystals as they could, and the Anhari did so in secret over a number of years, storing them in their sun temple atop the spire.\nThe Skalaxi and their leader, &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer-Lord%20Salavass\"&gt;Sorcerer-Lord Salavass&lt;/a&gt; eventually uncovered what was happening. They believed that knowledge was a basic right for all arakkoa and Salavass called for the immediate release of the crystals. However, Velthreek ignored the demand. He declared the Anhari the sole rulers of the Apexis and that they would decide who would access the crystals and their knowledge. In addition, he claimed that he and the Anhari were the living representatives of Rukhmar herself. Therefore, following their teachings was the only way to attain her favor. Salavas was cunning and knew what would happen to his order if they did not act: the Skalaxi would become marginalized in society and gradually lose influence. He gathered his followers and struck at the sun temple to take the Apexis crystals by force.\nThe battle that erupted at the gates to the sun temple quickly spilled into the lower levels of the spire, with some arakkoa allying with the Anhari and others with the Skalaxi. The civil war engulfed the spire for many months, and to turn the tide of the conflict the Anhari harnessed the Breath of Rukhmar. As the weapon ignited and they prepared to incinerate the Skalaxi, Salavass knew they would be doomed against it and led a handful of his most gifted sorcerers to the top of the spire where they stormed through the Anhari guards. As the Ahhari cut down the intruders Salavass weaved a spell to destabilize the Breath of Rukhmar. It worked, but the result was catastrophic: a furious explosion erupted from the Breath of Rukhmar, instantly kiling most of the arakkoa on the spire and shattering the land. After the light dimmed, all was dark.\nThe explosion had split Arak's spire into many smaller spires and the surrounding region was left a barren wasteland. In time, it came to be known as the Spires of Arak. It would take generations for life to bloom in the area again, and even longer for the surviving arakkoa to recover from what had happened. The Apexis society was no more and the &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Order\"&gt;Age of Order&lt;/a&gt; was over, but from its ashes new cultures would arise.\nThe Gorian Empire.\nTwo hundred years after the fall of the &lt;a href=\"Apexis\"&gt;Apexis&lt;/a&gt;, a remnant of the &lt;a href=\"Skalaxi\"&gt;Skalaxi&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Yonzi\"&gt;Yonzi&lt;/a&gt; led to the rise of the &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Gorian%20Empire\"&gt;Gorian Empire&lt;/a&gt; when they taught them arcane sorcery to rebel against their &lt;a href=\"ogron\"&gt;ogron&lt;/a&gt; slavemasters. They did this to obtain Apexis ruins under the city of &lt;a href=\"Goria\"&gt;Goria&lt;/a&gt;, but the ogre they had taught - &lt;a href=\"Gorgog%20the%20Gronnslayer\"&gt;Gorgog the Gronnslayer&lt;/a&gt; - killed Yonzi slowly and gruesomely. Arakkoa ventures into ogre lands became few and far between, and the ogres began to prize &lt;a href=\"Apexis%20Crystal%20%28item%29\"&gt;Apexis crystals&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe ogres ruled from Goria for six hundred years. This was until &lt;a href=\"Imperator%20Molok\"&gt;Imperator Molok&lt;/a&gt; attempted to claim the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20the%20Elements\"&gt;Throne of the Elements&lt;/a&gt;, and the elements themselves, for the empire. His attempts to subjugate both resulted in the near destruction of the former, and the 'wounding' (in a sense) of the latter. This ignited a great war between the ogres and the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s, as the latter came to the defense of the spirits and eventually laid siege to Goria. Seeing no reason to waste countless lives in an attempt to break down the city's significant fortifications, the orcs were content to keep their distance on the surrounding hills and starve out their enemy. The Gorians believed they could outlast any siege thanks to their ocean port. Due to the tumultuous state of the &lt;a href=\"furies\"&gt;elements&lt;/a&gt;, the orcish &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; were not as effective in calling on their powers as they once had been.\nHowever, as the months passed, the ogres found themselves unable to maintain their empire. Trade via the ocean was not enough; the ogres needed access to their network of land-based trade routes, which the orcs had severed. Imperator Molok and his &lt;a href=\"sorcerer\"&gt;sorcerer&lt;/a&gt;s revisited their Apexis crystals, searching for a way to break the siege. In time, they discovered the &lt;a href=\"arakkoa\"&gt;arakkoa&lt;/a&gt;n legend about the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Sethe\"&gt;Curse of Sethe&lt;/a&gt;, and began experimenting with ways to create a similar affliction among the orcs. They succeeded, and soon the so-called &lt;a href=\"red%20pox\"&gt;red pox&lt;/a&gt; spread like wildfire through the orcs' encampments, culling vast amounts of the orcish combatants.\nThe orc &lt;a href=\"Nelgarm\"&gt;Nelgarm&lt;/a&gt; and his fellow shaman, realizing that the pox was an unseen attack from the ogres and that the siege was now doomed to fail, beseeched the elements to destroy Goria. The orcs and the elemental spirits both understood that Molok would resume meddling with the Throne of the Elements if the orcs failed, and so the elements agreed to unleash their fury upon Goria. The shaman gathered outside the ogre city's mighty walls and witnessed the fury of the spirits. What happened next would never be forgotten. A roaring storm churned above the city as the ground groaned and trembled. Over several hours, lightning, fire and earthquakes ravaged the city, bringing down every wall and building, sealing off the escape routes and burning the ships in the harbor. When nothing but ash and rubble remained, the earth itself wrenched open like a giant maw to swallow Molok and the remains of his great city whole.\nUntold thousands of ogres died that day; none were left alive by the elementals. Only whispers of the event would reach the other Gorian cities and outposts, but those whispers would be enough to discourage any further tampering with the elements. The orcs were victorious, but they had suffered massive losses and witnessed a destructive power they never wanted to see again. Nelgarm and the other shaman were particularly frightened by the elementals' wrath and said that the need for a unified orc army had passed. There was little argument, and the clans returned to their lands.\nArrival of the draenei.\nNearly 200 years before &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; crashed upon this remote world in their &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; vessel, the \"&lt;a href=\"Genedar\"&gt;Genedar&lt;/a&gt;\". They believed that this world would be an ideal refuge for their millennia-long exodus and named it Draenor, which meant \"Exiles' Refuge\" in their tongue; since the native &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s did not have a name for the planet\u2014other than simply \"world\"\u2014they eventually adopted the &lt;a href=\"Draenei%20%28language%29\"&gt;Draenei&lt;/a&gt; term. The settlers quietly cultivated their society once again and kept their magic hidden, ever wary of being discovered again by the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s forces. The draenei also built &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt; in the location where the city of &lt;a href=\"Goria\"&gt;Goria&lt;/a&gt; once stood. The &lt;a href=\"talbuk\"&gt;talbuk&lt;/a&gt;s that they had brought along from their homeworld of &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt; proved capable of surviving on their own on the new world, becoming integrated with the native ecosystem.\nTheir arrival, however, placed a literal dark burden on the planet. One of the naaru on board, K'ara, was severely injured in the crash and flung into orbit where it entered the 'darkened' stage of a naaru's life-cycle. As a dark naaru its presence was felt by the orc clan who dwelled in the &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Valley\"&gt;Shadowmoon Valley&lt;/a&gt; who called it the 'Dark Star'. Some of its members even began to channel the darkness that K'ara produced, allowing them to defile the dead and summon &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; creatures. In horror, the chieftain of the &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20clan\"&gt;Shadowmoon clan&lt;/a&gt; banned the use of shadow under any circumstances.\nRise of the Horde.\nFor generations the orcs lived in a clan-based, shamanistic society that existed in deep harmony with the surrounding natural world, though frequently clashed with ogre clans and occasionally the reclusive Primals. Their peaceful way of life, however, ended when the Shadowmoon clan's chieftain, &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;, was tricked into forming an alliance with the Burning Legion. When he attempted to back out of the deal, his apprentice &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; eagerly betrayed and succeeded him. Gul'dan's manipulations transformed the orcs into a unified army of bloodthirsty conquerors, ultimately leading them to drink the blood of the demon lord &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt; and become bound to the will the Legion. The &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; magics wielded by the corrupted orcs turned much of Draenor's vibrant landscape into a dusty wasteland as they, under orders from Mannoroth's master &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;, decimated the draenei, enslaved the ogres, and took dark dominion over the world. &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the draenei, survived the orcish genocide and fled with the remnants of his people to the fungal swamps, where they once more hid themselves from the gaze of the Legion. Before the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Orcish Horde&lt;/a&gt; could destroy itself in its bloodlust, Gul'dan, acting in concert with the possessed &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;, opened the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, connecting the worlds of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and Draenor. The orcs spilled through into an unsuspecting world and started a new war \u2013 one that would ultimately pave the way for the Burning Legion's &lt;a href=\"Burning%20legion%23The%20Second%20Invasion\"&gt;second invasion of Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;.\nDestruction of Draenor.\nDespite its surprise assault and demonic backing, the orcish horde was eventually beaten back by the forces of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, and Draenor became the focus of a furious counterattack via the same Dark Portal the orcs had used to invade Azeroth. In the midst of the ensuing battle, the elder shaman &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; attempted to provide his fellow remaining orcs a means of escape by opening more dimensional portals to other worlds; his &lt;a href=\"Spell%20of%20Conjuration\"&gt;reckless&lt;/a&gt; use of magic backfired, however, and the presence of so many portals began to tear the very fabric of the planet apart, causing massive tidal waves, earthquakes, and volcanoes to erupt.\nIn a desperate bid to save Azeroth from the impending chain reaction, the ill-fated but heroic &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Expedition\"&gt;Alliance Expedition&lt;/a&gt; closed the Dark Portal from Draenor, trapping themselves there even as it began to crumble beneath their feet. Draenor's remnants were hurled towards the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Nether&lt;/a&gt; and they became known as &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;.\nThough Ner'zhul's gambit had doomed Draenor itself, it did not doom his people: Many orcs managed to weather the savage storm of Draenor's end, while others escaped the destruction of their homeworld by remaining in Azeroth during the Alliance counterattack. Of these survivors, &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; would go on to be captured and enslaved, &lt;a href=\"Grom%20Hellscream\"&gt;others&lt;/a&gt; would eke out a living as free but listless warriors on the fringes of a foreign world, and &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; would even prove strong enough to rise from the ashes of a broken land. Their deeds would go on to deeply affect Draenor's future \u2013 or perhaps, more accurately, its past.\nOf the draenei and Alliance present on Draenor at the time; many of the former survived, though mutated, and managed to cobble together a meager existence in the wilds of the shattered world. Others, notably Turalyon and Alleria, were saved by the naaru prime Xe'ra and recruited into her &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Army of the Light&lt;/a&gt; to crusade against the Burning Legion.\nAlternate timeline.\n35 years ago, on an alternate version of Draenor, a &lt;a href=\"Kairozdormu\"&gt;rogue Bronze Dragon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; arrived to instigate the creation of a different horde. Kairoz was killed and Garrosh took charge of the dragon's plans and manipulated this universe's version of Grommash Hellscream into binding the orc clans into a single force united by their iron will called the Iron Horde. Equipped with advanced Goblin technology from the main-universe Azeroth's modern day the Iron Horde eagerly pursues their new destiny as free-willed, but equally cruel and bloodthirsty conquerors.\nIn the RPG.\nDraenor ceased to be a material world, and its barely-hospitable remnants were rechristened &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 the torn fragments of a once verdant realm cursed to float in the darkness of the &lt;a href=\"Nether\"&gt;Nether&lt;/a&gt; until the end of time.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

Khadgar describes it as 'the far side of the looking glass'. As a result it's extremely important to note that this Draenor, while \"almost\" the same as the one that became Outland, is not \"exactly\" the same (see the pertinent section below for further details).\nThe arrival of &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; from the main universe and his subsequent meddling with history allowed him to create a technologically advanced &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt; under the leadership of .

The overthrown warchief was tasked to prevent the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Curse\"&gt;Blood Curse&lt;/a&gt; from coming to pass within this parallel universe in order to create an uncorrupted orcish Horde for their machinations. Garrosh, however had no intention of being a pawn in someone else's plans and once on Draenor with Kairoz, he killed him and stole the fragment of the &lt;a href=\"%3AVision%20of%20Time\"&gt;:Vision of Time&lt;/a&gt;, which served as the catalyst that bridged both universes, and then departed to unite the Horde for his own purposes.\nGarrosh convinced Grommash of his race's eventual fate, using the Vision of Time to show him the prime universe's events up to the aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, shared information about some of the modernized &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; technology and how to create it, with himself later smuggling some of it into the parallel universe, thanks to his connections within &lt;a href=\"Blackfuse%20Company\"&gt;Blackfuse Company&lt;/a&gt;, and then plotted his way to prevent the orcs from entering the Blood Pact, which ultimately succeeded. This was the major turning point of this universe's timeline, where the newly established union of the clans, the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt;, started their conquest of Draenor under the leadership of of the . Grom also put Garrosh in the position of Warlord of the Warsong clan to replace him.

Orc and draenei lived alongside each other for years. However, without demons to fight, the draenei became fixated upon the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; then compelled them to spread their influence among the orcs, and they formed an army known as the &lt;a href=\"Lightbound\"&gt;Lightbound&lt;/a&gt;. A few orcs were converted willingly, while others had the Light forced upon them. Ogres also joined the Lightbound. Decades later, the planet began to die. While only Gorgrond is seen, it is considerably less forested than it was before, the sky is clouded over, and there is a green tint in the air. The Lightbound accuse the orcs of causing this, while the Mag'har, in turn, accuse the Lightbound of causing it.\nWhile decades had passed on Draenor, only a handful of years had passed on Azeroth. &lt;a href=\"Eitrigg\"&gt;Eitrigg&lt;/a&gt; and the old Commander arrived on Draenor in the middle of the war between the Lightbound and Mag'har, led by Yrel and Grommash respectively. Having been unaware of this and of the years that had passed from Draenor's perspective, the forces from Azeroth had intended on recruiting the Mag'har to the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. A group of Mag'har led by &lt;a href=\"Overlord%20Geya%27rah\"&gt;Overlord Geya'rah&lt;/a&gt;, the daughter of Draka and the deceased Durotan, fled to Azeroth with Eitrigg and the Commander while Grommash held off Yrel.\nGeography.\nThe world of Draenor is comprised of at least two (most likely unnamed) &lt;a href=\"continent\"&gt;continent&lt;/a&gt;s, and only one of them is known to Azeroth's races. The continent we visit is the central one. After Draenor's destruction in the prime universe, that continent became Outland, the only known surviving fragment of the Red World. The second landmass is located southwest of it and is said to be the homeland of the ogres, as well as the heart of their &lt;a href=\"Gorian%20Empire\"&gt;empire&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Zangar%20encroachment\"&gt;Zangar encroachment&lt;/a&gt; is the name given to a fungal ecosystem seeking to overtake the land by spreading its spores from the .\nDraenor has two moons. The larger moon is bright with reflected light, responsible for the illumination of , while the smaller appears closer and is far darker. Nowhere is the larger of the two moons more imposing than over Shadowmoon Valley. The name \"&lt;a href=\"Pale%20Lady\"&gt;Pale Lady&lt;/a&gt;\" is assumed to refer to the larger of the two moons.\nDifferences between the alternate Draenor and prime Draenor.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Don%20Adams\"&gt;Don Adams&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard&lt;/a&gt;'s goal with the expansion was to depict &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;'s past. Because of that, the general background presented in the &lt;a href=\"alternate%20universe\"&gt;alternate universe&lt;/a&gt; is the same as the one of the prime universe.\nHowever, there are two types of differences between both backstories:\nAmong the differences of the second type we can count:\nGetting there.\nPlayers that will reach level 90 will embark on a journey that will lead them to repel the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s invasion entering &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; through the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, which has turned red because of a time warp that now connects it with the world of Draenor in the alternate past. &lt;a href=\"Warlords%20of%20Draenor%20intro%20experience\"&gt;The prologue quest&lt;/a&gt; will be a similar experience to the &lt;a href=\"death%20knight%20quests\"&gt;death knight starting experience&lt;/a&gt;. After defeating the invading army, they will travel through the portal and arrive at &lt;a href=\"Tanaan%20Jungle\"&gt;Tanaan Jungle&lt;/a&gt; (located in the same place as what will eventually become Hellfire Peninsula). After the prologue, &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; will be sent to , while the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; will go to the &lt;a href=\"Frostfire%20Ridge\"&gt;Frostfire Ridge&lt;/a&gt; - their own faction territories, with fully-fledged &lt;a href=\"Garrison\"&gt;Garrison&lt;/a&gt;s (that they need to build first) in Draenor."}

Unlike other abilities perks did not have a fixed level at which they were acquired; instead, upon reaching one of these levels, a perk would be randomly selected from those not yet known by the player. Perks would also be learned by the character's currently inactive specializations, meaning that by level 98 the character will have learned all perks for their class.\nThe Draenor Perks were retired when &lt;a href=\"patch%207.0.3\"&gt;patch 7.0.3&lt;/a&gt; went live, with many of their effects added into the existing abilities.\nSpeculation.\nThe introduction of the Draenor Perks may have been partly intended to compensate for a lack of new abilities when leveling from 90 to 100. With the expansion's substantial pruning to the current list of abilities, and larger than ever range of levels across which to spread their acquisition, it was likely that few if any new non-talent abilities would be awarded between 90 and 100. The Perks may have therefore made sense as a form of ability progression which did not require the player to be missing substantial pieces of their skillset until they reached max level; if several key abilities were learned only above level 90, the limited pool of pre-90 abilities might have left lower-level play unbalanced and monotonous."}

The ancients get their name from their &lt;a href=\"Ancient\"&gt;analogues on Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;; they are tied closely to &lt;a href=\"Primals\"&gt;a prehistoric plant lineage&lt;/a&gt; that unites much of Draenor's flora and places them in opposition to the &lt;a href=\"Breakers\"&gt;creatures of stone&lt;/a&gt;. These enigmatic ancients remain in the same area for hundreds of years and are reluctant to move unless their home is threatened. &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s should be cautious when harvesting the valley's lumber, as they may find the forest fighting back.\nAncients tend to be guardians and tenders, but that does not make them any less dangerous. An enraged ancient is something to be behold. Taking a branch from one is a worthy deed.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Tangleheart\"&gt;Tangleheart&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"botani\"&gt;botani&lt;/a&gt; use &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Growth%20Sap\"&gt;a special sap&lt;/a&gt; to quickly grow ancients to full size. The botani known as imbues ancient saplings with anger and hatred towards creatures unlike them. The \"Ritual of the Charred\" is a strange ritual wherein the full-grown ancients step into fire, burning the leaves from their branches and charring their bark.\nThere once was a grove of ancients in either &lt;a href=\"Gorgrond\"&gt;Gorgrond&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Frostfire%20Ridge\"&gt;Frostfire Ridge&lt;/a&gt;, its name forgotten. They lived there in ancient times before the destruction of Outland. &lt;a href=\"Mosswood%20the%20Ancient\"&gt;Mosswood the Ancient&lt;/a&gt; is one of the last of these ancients.\nThe appearance of Draenor ancients vary depending on their their environment; for instance, many ancients in &lt;a href=\"Gorgrond\"&gt;Gorgrond&lt;/a&gt; have palm-like leaves, while the ones in tend to more closely resemble the willows commonly found in that area."}

{"id": "14686", "revid": "38896978", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=14686", "title": "Dragon", "text": "Dragons (known as nelghor in &lt;a href=\"Orcish%20%28language%29\"&gt;orcish&lt;/a&gt;) are immense, powerful, winged reptilian creatures, created from &lt;a href=\"proto-dragon\"&gt;proto-dragon&lt;/a&gt;s by the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"keeper\"&gt;keeper&lt;/a&gt;s to safeguard the world of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; millennia ago. They are divided into several types called &lt;a href=\"dragonflight\"&gt;dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;s. Since the fall of &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, they have lost their titan-given powers as well as the ability to reproduce. They still remain powerful sorcerers, however. As of the blooming of Amirdrassil the Dragon Aspects, including Vyranoth, were empowered by Azeroth. Though gifted with their ancestral power again, it remains to be seen if their ability to reproduce has also returned.\nName.\n\"Dragon\" is the name for these beings in the &lt;a href=\"Common%20%28language%29\"&gt;Common&lt;/a&gt; language. It's not confirmed what they call themselves in &lt;a href=\"Draconic\"&gt;Draconic&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Orcish%20%28language%29\"&gt;Orcish&lt;/a&gt;, dragons are called \"nelghor\", meaning \"loyal beasts\". The &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt; originally used this word to refer to their &lt;a href=\"rylak\"&gt;rylak&lt;/a&gt; mounts on &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;. After arriving on Azeroth, they applied the term to dragons as well. All orcs eventually came to refer to dragons as \"nelghor\".\nA female dragon is sometimes called a dragoness.\nHistory.\nThe &lt;a href=\"proto-dragon\"&gt;proto-dragon&lt;/a&gt;s were the ancestors of dragons before they evolved into the sapient, beautiful majestic creatures that they are known as today. &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; recently uncovered evidence, corroborated by reports from adventurers in &lt;a href=\"Deepholm\"&gt;Deepholm&lt;/a&gt;, that proto-dragons and dragons may have originated from &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt; drakes (i.e, &lt;a href=\"stone%20dragon\"&gt;stone dragon&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"storm%20dragon\"&gt;storm dragon&lt;/a&gt;s). Dragons share a common ancestry with both &lt;a href=\"gryphon\"&gt;gryphon&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"wyvern\"&gt;wyvern&lt;/a&gt;s, but it is unknown how far back they diverged.\n&lt;a href=\"Galakrond\"&gt;Galakrond&lt;/a&gt;, a massive proto-dragon, is known as the \"progenitor of dragonkind.\" It is said that it is from Galakrond the titans created the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspect\"&gt;Aspects&lt;/a&gt;, but this is a rumor the Aspects actively encouraged so as to keep the truth about Galakrond a secret from the dragonflights.\nAt one time, their numbers were uncountable, but in present-day Azeroth there are very few left. Originally, there were many different &lt;a href=\"dragonflight\"&gt;dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;s, with many different colors to be seen. The five most influential, however, were the reds, the greens, the bronze, the blacks, and the blues, and eventually most (if not all) of the other flights disappeared.\nChosen by the titans, each of the five dragonflights was given domain over a certain aspect of the world, ranging from the earth to time itself. During the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, the dragonflights sought to fulfill their duty and strike against the invading &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Over time, the dragons have endured much hardship and only a handful still remain, hostile to all that may tamper with the titans' creations.\nAegwynn and the dragon hunt.\n823 years before the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, a large hunting party of &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s were stalking &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragon\"&gt;blue dragon&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, having also managed to kill a &lt;a href=\"Green%20dragon\"&gt;green&lt;/a&gt; one. &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt; traveled to the distant north and tracked these demons into the mountains. There, she found that the demons were killing and draining their preys of their innate magic. The mighty dragons, who had fled from the ever-advancing march of mortal societies, found themselves too evenly matched against the dark magics of the Legion. Aegwynn confronted the demons, and with help from the noble dragons, eradicated them.\nSecond War.\nDragons first appeared as a unit of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt; in \"\". They were described as such:\n\"Dragons are native to the untamed &lt;a href=\"northlands\"&gt;northlands&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Reclusive by nature, Dragons have had little contact with their earthbound neighbors over the centuries. &lt;a href=\"Dal%27rend%20Blackhand\"&gt;Rend&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Maim%20Blackhand\"&gt;Maim&lt;/a&gt;, the Chieftains of The &lt;a href=\"Black%20Tooth%20Grin%20clan\"&gt;Black Tooth Grin clan&lt;/a&gt;, masterminded the capture of the Dragon Queen &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstraza&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt;. With their Queen held captive, these majestic creatures have been forced into subservience by the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; - her progeny being raised by the Dragonmaw clan to slaughter the enemies of the Horde.\"\n\"By combining their incredible destructive powers with a keen intellect, the Dragons represent the single most powerful force within the Horde. The devastating flame that issues forth from the mouths of older serpents can level any number of enemy troops, while their powerful wings allow them to tirelessly soar through the skies.\"\nDespite being depicted with green sprites, the dragons of \"\" were enslaved members of the &lt;a href=\"red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; as later lore developed. These red dragons were additionally explained to be mounted by &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;ish &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20rider\"&gt;riders&lt;/a&gt; instead of acting on their own. The Dragonmaw riders launched attacks on Lordaeron through the war and even after its end.\nIn \"\" the dragons of the Horde were then being described as once having been enslaved but now continuing to feed upon humans, roosting at &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt; and being led by &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;. Later lore changed them to being willing members of the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;.\nThird War.\nOn some melee maps &lt;a href=\"dragon%20roost\"&gt;dragon roost&lt;/a&gt;s were available to buy dragons. The colors of the dragons varied depending on the tileset of the maps.\nBiology and culture.\nAlthough each &lt;a href=\"dragonflight\"&gt;dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; has its own unique characteristics, there are a number of traits shared by all dragons.\nPhysique.\nThe older a dragon gets, the larger they grow. They have enough sexual dimorphism that it's possible to determine if they're male or female based on their appearance. Specifically, males have larger crests.\nDragons have keen senses far surpassing even those of &lt;a href=\"high%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt;, including exceptional hearing, eyesight, night vision, and smell. They are able to recognize the scents of individual mortals, and some mortals even say that they can, within limitations, smell magic.\nDragons are covered in scales, but they're vulnerable at the back of the skull and can be killed if struck there. Dragon scale is an extremely strong and durable material, and very small amounts of it can go a long way in crafting. One of the few things capable of ripping through their scales are the beings' own claws. When a dragon shakes their body, their scales clatter rhythmically. They generally lose scales in the same way that other creatures lose fur. The exposed area eventually hardens and becomes new scales, but until then, the soft flesh is vulnerable to weapons and poison. Holding a scale or other part of a dragon supposedly grants a hold of their power, as expressed in a saying once heard by &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt;: \"To bear some bit of the greatest of leviathans is to have a hold on their power\". &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Korialstrasz&lt;/a&gt; internally remarked that a gem he had magically fashioned from one of his scales bore properties that would've astounded any &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; if they'd known how to cast \"dragon magic\", which few do.\nDragons are known for their deadly breaths, each dragonflight having a different one. But cutting off their air passage when they are seeking to unleash their internal powers might end in catastrophic results, such as the dragon exploding from within.\nDragon blood is scarlet in color. Most animals can't tolerate ingesting dragon blood, with the notable exception of &lt;a href=\"crocolisk\"&gt;crocolisk&lt;/a&gt;s, whose stomachs are protected like plate armor.\nWhile the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; are the ones most attuned to it, all dragons are \"creatures of magic\". As a result, draining the magic from them is even more lethal than plunging a sword through their throat. Dragons always keep various natural magical defenses about themselves.\nDragons are born to the sky. Despite their size, they can leap into the air with less effort than many other flying creatures, fly much faster than &lt;a href=\"hippogryph\"&gt;hippogryph&lt;/a&gt;s and most other creatures, and cover several miles in a matter of minutes. They can fly at least as high as Azeroth's , thousands of feet above the ground. Racing has always been a popular competition among dragons, and they play games where they maneuver through mountain ranges from the moment they can fly.\nThey are also skilled swimmers. Some are more born to the water than others, but even members of the &lt;a href=\"red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;\u2014who are primarily creatures of the sky\u2014can swim very well, and Korialstrasz had the ability to hold his breath for more than an hour.\nDragons do not need as much sleep as most races. They can slumber for minutes, days, or weeks at a time, depending on the circumstances. During some periods, the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragon\"&gt;black dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sinestra\"&gt;Sinestra&lt;/a&gt; went for more than a century without sleeping, though this is not normal for most of her kind. Dragons do dream, a fact not limited to the green dragonflight.\nAt least some dragons can survive being submerged in lava, but only for a short time before burning to death. If gravely injured, red and black dragons can dive into lava and use its heat to revive themselves, but this is more the way of the black flight and is a very unpleasant experience for reds.\nName.\nEvery dragon has a unique name; among them, \"a name is granted to one and one alone\". Most of the dragonflights have unique naming patterns, however, not all flights use them extensively.\nBehavior.\nDragon minds are far more complex and advanced than those of the short-lived races. They think on a larger scale and can cope with sensory impressions that &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s would find overwhelming, such as a spell to expand one's view in all directions.\nAmong their kind, many dragons regard with arrogance the mortal races which they call the \"lesser races\". The others are intrigued by them, and take pleasure in mingling among them with their mortal forms.\nSince dragons live long, and their mind refuses to forget the horrors that have beset this world for ages upon ages, the duty and burdens of the world can often weigh heavy on their mind wishing for silence or the peace of a dream. Consequently, some dragonkin specialize in tinctures and tonics to ease the burdens for a time, so that the dragons might find their way to a dream.\nA common draconic show of affection is to gently nuzzle each other. They can also hug each other by folding their wings around the other's body. They express respect or obeisance by bowing their heads (which can also be done as a polite greeting) and gratitude by sliding their tails back and forth. They prick up their ears when attentive and flatten them against their skulls when angered. Dragon cheers are described as sounding thrumming and musical, and their laughter is oddly sweet and bell-like. When fighting, they snap, hiss, and display their teeth and claws to each other. Despite being covered in scales, dragons visibly blush when they feel embarrassed.\nObjects called &lt;a href=\"oathstone\"&gt;oathstone&lt;/a&gt;s are important to dragons as bonds of agreement.\nDragons enjoy the sport &lt;a href=\"Talon%20Toss\"&gt;Lish Llrath&lt;/a&gt;.\nLife cycle.\nDragon is both the name for the race as a whole and the short title for the mature-aged dragon (aka \"mature dragon\"). When young, dragons are known for their bloodlust, which they eventually grow out of when becoming older and wiser. Once a dragon has come of age, it is acceptable for them to choose a different gender identity than the one they were born with if they wish.\nReproduction.\nSince the fall of &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the main dragonflights have all lost the ability to lay eggs.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Sinestra\"&gt;Sinestra&lt;/a&gt;, it was possible for dragons from different flights to interbreed, but the flights tended to keep strictly to their own kind due to tradition and prejudice.\nWhen dragons could still reproduce, only half of all eggs ever hatched, and only half of those who hatched survived to adulthood\u2014a harsh beginning to a life of wonder and glory. Dragon eggs can range from being the size of an elf's fist to being almost as large as one whole elf. Newly-laid eggs are smooth and nearly round. As they get closer to hatching, they take on an oval shape, and their shells become rough and scaly. At this point, they shine with a pulsing glow from within and have veins running through their thick shells. Dragons are already conscious while in their unhatched eggs.\nDragons from the same clutch of eggs refer to each other as \"clutch brother\"/\"clutch sister\" and are considered the closest of siblings. Dragons also use the term \"my blood\" for individuals they have close ties with; not just comrades or members of the same flight, but closer yet, such as clutch siblings or parents and offspring.\nDeath and afterlife.\nWhen dragons near the end of their lives, they fly to the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Wastes\"&gt;Dragon Wastes&lt;/a&gt; in the center of the &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; to die and enrich the land with their passing. As a result, the Dragon Wastes are a place of powerful magical energies left by the spirits of the dead dragons, and some of their bones still hold this power. The &lt;a href=\"taunka\"&gt;taunka&lt;/a&gt; believe that this magic can be wielded by those that the dragons' spirits deem worthy. The reason they fly specifically to the Dragonblight is &lt;a href=\"flavor%20lore\"&gt;possibly&lt;/a&gt; because it is the site of &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20Aspects\"&gt;Chamber of Aspects&lt;/a&gt;, where the Dragon Aspects were allegedly empowered by the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;. Many choose to set their bodies close to the &lt;a href=\"Galakrond%27s%20Rest\"&gt;resting place&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Galakrond\"&gt;Galakrond&lt;/a&gt;, since he is (incorrectly) believed to have been the progenitor of dragons.\n&lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; has variously thought of his own &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt; as \"what passed for a dragon's soul\" and \"any soul one of his kind might have\", implying that their souls are different in some way from short-lived races. Members of the blue dragonflight often stay near the Dragonblight to commune with the spirits of long-dead dragons.\nAs they are creatures of the sky, the &lt;a href=\"Wild%20God\"&gt;Wild God&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Aviana\"&gt;Aviana&lt;/a&gt; considers dragons to be under her protection. Prior to the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, the souls of dragons who died were brought to Aviana's realm, the great tree &lt;a href=\"G%27Hanir\"&gt;G'Hanir&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;, to spend the afterlife alongside birds and other winged creatures. It's unclear if this is still the case; G'Hanir died alongside Aviana during the War of the Ancients, but she set out to restore the tree after her resurrection during the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;. Some dragons believe that the spirits of their dead kin \"ascend\" to the Chamber of Aspects. &lt;a href=\"Zeryxia\"&gt;Zeryxia&lt;/a&gt; claimed that she could hear the voice of the deceased &lt;a href=\"Sintharia\"&gt;Sintharia&lt;/a&gt; whispering to her from \"the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;Dark Beyond&lt;/a&gt;\". After &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt; died, her soul was sent to the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt; realm of &lt;a href=\"Ardenweald\"&gt;Ardenweald&lt;/a&gt; to recover in a &lt;a href=\"wildseed\"&gt;wildseed&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href=\"Sapphiron\"&gt;Sapphiron&lt;/a&gt; was summoned by &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; in the form of an undead dragon in &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxus\"&gt;Maldraxxus&lt;/a&gt;. Maldraxxus is also home to other undead dragons such as &lt;a href=\"Xantuth%20the%20Blighted\"&gt;Xantuth the Blighted&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Rotwing%20Construct\"&gt;Rotwing Construct&lt;/a&gt;, but their origin is not stated.\nShapeshifting.\nDragons and some other dragonkin like the &lt;a href=\"dracthyr\"&gt;dracthyr&lt;/a&gt; have the innate ability to shapeshift into many different forms, primarily the various humanoid races. As evidenced by &lt;a href=\"Alurmi\"&gt;Alurmi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt;, and some of &lt;a href=\"Chronormu\"&gt;Chronormu&lt;/a&gt;'s appearances, they have this ability even when they are as young as &lt;a href=\"dragon%20whelp\"&gt;whelps&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey shapeshift for a variety of reasons, the main one being that it is easier to communicate, work with, and live among mortals while wearing a mortal guise. When the Aspects first realized that dragons were destined to share Azeroth with the younger races, the timeways told them that they had to learn to live alongside them. As such, each of them took on a form to allow them to see the world as the young races do. The dragonflights keep disguised spies placed among each of the younger races, who (in the dragons' view) have a tendency to cause disasters when left to their own devices. Even when the mortals they interact with know their true nature, some dragons choose to use their humanoid form to appear less threatening as a show of courtesy. Other reasons include moving unnoticed through areas where a being as large as a dragon would be easily spotted, fitting in smaller spaces, or even for enjoyment: one of the great pleasures of humanoid forms is that soft skin is more sensitive to receiving a loving touch than scales. According to &lt;a href=\"Desharin\"&gt;Desharin&lt;/a&gt;, dragons generally do not use their disguises to take positions of power among the short-lived races, with some exceptions: black dragons often use humanoid disguises to manipulate mortal affairs (with &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Onyxia&lt;/a&gt; both famously infiltrating human kingdoms) and &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Korialstrasz&lt;/a&gt; became a member of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Six\"&gt;Council of Six&lt;/a&gt; under the name Krasus. Up to the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, it was considered a secret even amongst &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s that dragons had such transformation powers.\nAll dragons are individuals and prefer different shapes for different reasons, though some dragons will have shapes looking like those of their own relatives. Deathwing, Onyxia and &lt;a href=\"Nefarian\"&gt;Nefarian&lt;/a&gt; all had visage shapes featuring similar facial features. When a dragon comes of age, they undergo a ceremony known as &lt;a href=\"Visage%20Day\"&gt;Visage Day&lt;/a&gt; and cast a special incantation that defines their main mortal form (\"visage\"). The choice of visage is deeply personal and says much about the dragon's personality, as it is not only about how they wish for others to perceive them, but also about how they see themselves and how they experience the world alongside others. The guises of the former Aspects are elaborate and formal, as they command the respect of both dragons and mortals, and many dragons follow their example with their own visages. Others like &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; intentionally choose humbler forms as a contrast to this, since they want to walk among mortals as friends and equals. Yet others, like Onyxia, view shapeshifting solely as a tool to manipulate mortals and take what they want, which was reflected in Onyxia's choice of a form that appealed to human vanity. &lt;a href=\"Tyrygosa\"&gt;Tyrygosa&lt;/a&gt; refuses to take the form of a human, since she finds elves to be more aesthetically pleasing. While all dragons decide for themselves what form they want to use, each of the main dragonflights tend to gravitate to appearing as certain races. &lt;a href=\"Green%20dragonflight\"&gt;Greens&lt;/a&gt; prefer the forms of &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; due to their relationship with &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Archdruid Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Red%20dragonflight\"&gt;Reds&lt;/a&gt; prefer &lt;a href=\"high%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blues&lt;/a&gt; prefer &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Bronze%20dragonflight\"&gt;bronzes&lt;/a&gt; (though their task necessitates a variety of disguises) seem to enjoy appearing as &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;s.\nEven after choosing a visage, dragons are not limited to a single disguise and can assume any form they wish, as shown by Deathwing, Korialstrasz, &lt;a href=\"Acridostrasz\"&gt;Acridostrasz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kairozdormu\"&gt;Kairozdormu&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Vaelastrasz\"&gt;Vaelastrasz&lt;/a&gt; all appearing as different races on different occasions. However, if they use a form different from one they're used to, this may be evident by unnatural-looking movements.\nThey are not limited to appearing as humanoids\u2014for example, they can also take on the appearance of &lt;a href=\"proto-dragon\"&gt;proto-dragon&lt;/a&gt;s or disguise themselves as part of a tree\u2014nor even to lifeforms that actually exist. A red dragon assigned to spy on &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt; prior to the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; used a form whose face resembled a strange mix of reptile and elf. During his long madness, &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt; wore the form of a strange, insect-like humanoid creature, and on one occasion, &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt; used an elf-like shape with the face of an owl. Dragons also do not need to transform the entirety of their body all at once, and can instead choose to alter only certain parts of it, such as stretching a smile to inhuman length and revealing menacing draconic teeth.\nTransforming is normally a quick process that takes place in the space of a heartbeat or the blink of an eye, with the dragon's body changing faster than the eye can follow. Sometimes, the transformation is accompanied by a swirl of magic that envelops the dragon as they shift, such as a cloud of golden magic for Nozdormu and Chronormu, swirls of &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; magic for Kalecgos, and a cloud of ash for Onyxia. However, rapidly shifting back and forth can be very painful and exhausting.\nDragons are more vulnerable in mortal form, such as being more sensitive to poison, but they can still survive wounds and injuries that would kill or incapacitate humans and other mortal races. Their senses\u2014including sight, smell, and night vision\u2014remain much more acute than those of the beings they disguise themselves as, though their night vision is implied to be weaker than when they're in their true shape. When in mortal form, they also require far less food than when they are in their dragon form.\nMany dragons have nicknames they use when in the company of mortals, since dragon names can sound \"a bit formal\" for the younger races. The clothes they wear in their humanoid forms are not true clothes but rather a false image conjured by the dragon. This also means that they are much more durable than true garments. If such clothes do get damaged, the disguised dragon can make them whole again with a simple wave of their hand. When they resume their dragon form, any clothes they're wearing either fade to nothing or get shredded, fly into the air, and settle on their body to become scales. If a dragon carries an injury in their true form, this will be reflected in their mortal guise as well (such as with &lt;a href=\"Sinestra\"&gt;Sinestra&lt;/a&gt;'s various scars and burns). If they die while shapeshifted, they remain in their shapeshifted form.\nVarious factors can cause dragons to become trapped in their mortal guise. During the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ysondre\"&gt;Ysondre&lt;/a&gt; appeared exclusively as a night elf since she was too weak to assume her true form. &lt;a href=\"Dar%27Khan%20Drathir\"&gt;Dar'Khan Drathir&lt;/a&gt; used an enchanted collar to keep &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; trapped in his mortal form. Years later, the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; did the same to &lt;a href=\"Kirygosa\"&gt;Kirygosa&lt;/a&gt; using a magical chain.\nThe Dragon Aspects.\nThe &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s chose a member of each of the five dragonflights to watch over Azeroth in their absence. Several have died, though others have risen to take their place:\nConsorts.\nThe Aspects are aided in their tasks by their consorts, who are their companions, partners, and lovers. Typically, the consorts are chosen by traditional draconic courtship rituals; though a consort may be smarter or more powerful than the average dragon, only those loved by the Aspect will rise to the position. The consorts at any given time are led by the Prime Consort, the one who has held the position longest or is else the most capable. Typically, an Aspect would have three or four consorts at any time.\nIn the RPG.\nA dragon is a reptilian creature, usually winged, with magical or unusual abilities.\nThe dragons of Azeroth are far more intelligent even than the humans who hunt them and struggle to reconcile their metaphysical nature with the reality of the savage world they inhabit. While each dragon is a powerful entity, dragons also represent the origins of the world and were given care over various parts of Azeroth's creation since time immemorial. Today, the dragons still remember their original natures and attempt to use their powers to continue their original purposes: for some, to shape stone and raise mountains; for others, to protect the forests or expand the realm of magic.\nThe dragons of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; reach maturity after a mere hundred years have passed. They are very cunning and magical, using spells to complement their powerful physical capacity. Because each creature has an intimate connection with the world around it, the death of a dragon is never a simple thing; it is a metaphysical event, driven by the creature's natural connection to the spirit of the world. A dragon's death can cause massive upheaval in the natural surroundings \u2014 earthquakes, surface lava explosions, a new lake flooding forth from a sudden crack in the earth\u2018s crust, and so on. Even young dragons, those who have not established as close a bond to the spiritual world, still make ripples in the fabric of reality when they die. Although these ripples are not always seen or felt by other races, a young dragon's death nonetheless garners the attention of other dragons in the area \u2014 and creatures particularly attuned to the natural state of being that surrounds them.\nTactics.\nDragons have a number of reasons for fighting; they are territorial, and numerous factions hunt them for a variety of different reasons. With the exception of black dragons, most dragons do not attack random groups of mortals on sight; although like mortals, each dragon has a different personality and some are more aggressive than others.\nEach of the dragonflights fights slightly differently, but their overall tactics are relatively similar. Fearsome alone, groups of dragons are nearly impossible to combat; all five dragonflights are intelligent, and they use everything they can think of to their advantage. When possible, the dragonflights use &lt;a href=\"dragonspawn\"&gt;dragonspawn&lt;/a&gt; troops to open the way into combat, allowing these ground-based troops to draw their enemies' attention while they strike from above or a distance. Even when bereft of dragonspawn support, dragons prefer to fight from the skies, resorting to melee only when necessary or when enraged. Dragons are highly intelligent and, due to their long lives, possess vast experience. Thus, they are excellent judges of when to call a tactical retreat. Yet if dragons decide that the cause is worthy, they will fight to the death for it, however hopeless the battle might be.\nBlue dragons open combat with magic to disrupt their enemies, such as creating illusions or walls of force. Red and black dragons focus on offensive magic and breath attacks, using spells like chain lightning and blazing column to eliminate waves of weaker enemies. Green and bronze dragons use spells to allow them to maneuver around their opponents, or directly incapacitate their enemies; greater invisibility and charm monster are popular.\nWhen facing a large group of enemies, dragons attempt to affect as large a group as they can with an individual spell or attack. In the battles against the qiraji a thousand years ago, dragons focused their efforts on taking down wave after wave of lesser qiraji with their breath weapons; the mortals had the responsibility of dealing with enemy commanders. This does not mean that if the opportunity presents itself a dragon won't take a bite out of an enemy commander; however, they are more likely to wreak as much havoc as they can than spend their time hunting a specific opponent.\nWhen fighting against a single target, dragons use spells to complement each other; one dragon might serve as a healer or cast enhancement spells like brilliance aura, while another decreases their target's defenses with bestow curse and detrimental magic, while the third attacks directly. In this respect, dragons work together in ways similar to a mortal adventuring party, but due to their inherent abilities they can switch roles and last longer in an extended battle."}

{"id": "15127", "revid": "35538764", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=15127", "title": "Dragon Aspects", "text": "The Dragon Aspects (also called Great Aspects, Aspects of Azeroth or simply Aspects) are the leaders of the five &lt;a href=\"dragonflight\"&gt;dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;s, empowered by the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s to protect &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Since the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, they have lost their titan-given power, which they sacrificed in order to empower the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt;. They, however, remain extremely powerful, ancient, and wise beings.\nBackground.\nCreation of the original Aspects.\nBefore they were dragons, the Aspects were &lt;a href=\"proto-dragon\"&gt;proto-dragon&lt;/a&gt;s. They stood united against a bloodthirsty monster who threatened their race, the Father of Dragons known as &lt;a href=\"Galakrond\"&gt;Galakrond&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the ordering of Azeroth, &lt;a href=\"Tyr\"&gt;Keeper Tyr&lt;/a&gt;, the greatest &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt; warrior, stood against Galakrond and with the help of five powerful and intelligent proto-dragons - Alexstrasza, Malygos, Neltharion, Nozdormu, and Ysera - that held dominion over their brethren, they defeated the massive proto-dragon known as Galakrond.\nBecause of this and their courage, Tyr suggested to the other &lt;a href=\"Keeper\"&gt;Keeper&lt;/a&gt;s to empower them and make them defenders of Azeroth as they proved they were able to stand for the planet. &lt;a href=\"Odyn\"&gt;Odyn&lt;/a&gt; disagreed, and forbid the other Keepers to proceed with that idea, but they decided to go against him. They reached out to the Pantheon and each of the titans blessed the proto-dragons with a portion of their vast power, channeled through the Keepers. The dragonflights were thus charged with the task of watching over Azeroth, lest any force should threaten its perfect tranquility. They became majestic beings called &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;s and were known as the Aspects. However, mortals are told that the Aspects were created from Galakrond. This is a rumor spread by the Aspects themselves in order to prevent proto-dragons and dragons from doing the same thing as Galakrond and becoming immeasurably powerful and mad.\nSelection.\nThe titans empowered the five dragons, each with specific powers, to lead the dragonflights and watch over &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and its evolution.\n&lt;a href=\"Aman%27Thul\"&gt;Aman'Thul&lt;/a&gt;, the Highfather of the Pantheon, charged the bronze dragon &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt; with guarding over time itself and police the ever-spinning pathways of fate and destiny. &lt;a href=\"Eonar\"&gt;Eonar&lt;/a&gt;, the Titan patron of all life, blessed both the red dragon &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; and her younger sister, the green dragon &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt;, so they would safeguard all living creatures and watch over the growing wilds of the world, respectively. &lt;a href=\"Norgannon\"&gt;Norgannon&lt;/a&gt;, the Titan lore keeper and master magician, made the blue dragon &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt; the guardian of magic and hidden arcanum. &lt;a href=\"Khaz%27goroth\"&gt;Khaz'goroth&lt;/a&gt;, the Titan shaper and forger of the world, gave the black dragon &lt;a href=\"Neltharion\"&gt;Neltharion&lt;/a&gt; dominion over the earth and the deep places of the world.\nAman'Thul's vision of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s one day causing the &lt;a href=\"Hour%20of%20Twilight\"&gt;Hour of Twilight&lt;/a&gt;, capable of potentially wiping out all &lt;a href=\"life\"&gt;life&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, was one of the reasons the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; empowered &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt; and the other Aspects with their powers, to ultimately avert this single catastrophe, although Aman'Thul for all his vast powers was not omniscient and was unaware &lt;a href=\"Neltharion\"&gt;Neltharion&lt;/a&gt; would eventually be corrupted into &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;.\nAccording to legends, when the Aspects were first created, the moons had been in a rare conjunction known as the &lt;a href=\"Embrace\"&gt;Embrace&lt;/a&gt;. A repeat of this same alignment was crucial to the proper working of the magic necessary to turn a normal dragon into an Aspect. It is impossible to select a new Aspect or even try to call a new one, as long as the current one lives.\nPowers and duties.\nAspects are more than just dragons with different skills and extra powers. When the titans blessed all of them, they gave them insights and other ways of understanding things. Until the creation of &lt;a href=\"Chromatus\"&gt;Chromatus&lt;/a&gt; barring other Aspects, no single dragon was able to defeat one. Although they are parts of a whole and were never meant to be separate, they are also complete unto themselves as well. When the titans departed, they said to the Aspects: \"Unto each of you was given a gift; unto all of you is given the duty.\" Their one true duty was to preserve the world of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and prevent the &lt;a href=\"Hour%20of%20Twilight\"&gt;Hour of Twilight&lt;/a&gt; at all costs.\nHowever, the titans' gift was also a burden. Neltharion felt every rock in Azeroth pressed down on him. His body splintered and cracked. It was beyond physical agony; his spirit was unraveling, suffocated by the unfathomable load. He saw it as a life of eternal torment. However with it came an incredible strength, as the weight of Azeroth was his to command.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Lorekeeper%20Lydros\"&gt;Lorekeeper Lydros&lt;/a&gt;, the ancient and legendary blade &lt;a href=\"%3AQuel%27Serrar\"&gt;:Quel'Serrar&lt;/a&gt; was \"crafted for an unknown entity by the combined might of the five Aspects\" long before even the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Dragon Soul.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, Alexstrasza, Ysera, Malygos, and Nozdormu fought the demons of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. It was also in that war that the black dragon Neltharion deceived his fellow Aspects, using the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt; to steal a portion of their power. At the end of the War of the Ancients, the blue, green, bronze, and red Aspects had found and enchanted the weapon so that neither Deathwing nor any other dragon could wield it again. Millennia after that, it had fallen into the hands of the Dragonmaw orcs, who had then used it to enslave the Life-Binder and her brood. Many red dragons had been forced to act as mounts of war during that harrowing time. So Deathwing held the upper hand in every battle with the other, weakened Aspects, until the human mage &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt; was able to use the scale Deathwing had given him to destroy the Dragon Soul. Cutting the scale across the surface, Rhonin unleashed the power trapped within and returned to the Aspects their essence given at the creation of the Dragon Soul.\nThe Hour of Twilight.\nNeltharion's duty to protect Azeroth's earthly expanses meant that he was susceptible to the influences of &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s who were imprisoned beneath the planet's surface.\nThe trials and tribulations that had afflicted the Dragonflights throughout history, from Deathwing's betrayal to the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;, from the &lt;a href=\"Infinite%20dragonflight\"&gt;Infinite dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Nexus%20War\"&gt;Madness of Malygos&lt;/a&gt;, were to culminate as the Hour of Twilight, the Old Gods' grand scheme to eliminate the Aspects and usher the end of life on Azeroth.\nShortly after the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; agreed to undergo a journey at the request of the Green Aspect, Ysera; a journey that eventually led him to Dragonblight and Wyrmrest Temple; there, Thrall was able to tap into Azeroth\u2019s essence and use it to help bind Kalecgos, Ysera, Nozdormu, and Alexstrasza together, allowing them to combine their power and stave off an attack by the Twilight\u2019s Hammer and the chromatic dragon &lt;a href=\"Chromatus\"&gt;Chromatus&lt;/a&gt;. Although successful in defending Wyrmrest Temple, the Aspects still needed to stop Deathwing. However, the fallen Aspect was so twisted by the dark energies of the Old Gods that not even the combined might of every living being on Azeroth could stop him. No physical assault, however immense, could destroy him; the only hope of stopping him was by unraveling his very essence, a power that only the Dragon Soul possessed.\nThere were various points in time when the Dragon Soul could be retrieved, but it had been altered throughout history. In order to be used as a weapon against Deathwing, it had to be taken while in its purest form. Nozdormu agreed to send the adventurers back to the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; to retrieve it but found that all timeways were being directed to the same event, &lt;a href=\"End%20Time\"&gt;the end of time itself&lt;/a&gt;. In order to retrieve the Dragon Soul, the Infinite Dragonflight and its leader &lt;a href=\"Murozond\"&gt;Murozond&lt;/a&gt; had to be slain, so the adventurers were sent to the future where they defeated Murozond. With the timeways reopened, the adventurers were sent to the Well of Eternity during the War of the Ancients. Once secured, the Dragon Soul was brought to present-day Dragonblight. There, &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, aided by the adventurers, transported it to &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt;, a place of great power housing the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20the%20Aspects\"&gt;Chamber of the Aspects&lt;/a&gt;, the very chamber in which the artifact was first imbued with the power of the Dragonflights.\nWhen Deathwing learned of their intent, he and his minions converged on &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt; and the temple to waylay them at any cost. Atop Wyrmrest Temple, the Aspects began to infuse the Dragon Soul with their essences once again, making it even more powerful than before. Kalecgos then began work to alter its properties so that it could affect Deathwing because he had never imbued his own essence into the disk. In order for the Dragon Soul to be used as a weapon against him, it had to be empowered with the essence of the Earth-Warder. Thrall possessed a portion of that very essence, and although it was incredibly small, he was able to impart it to the Dragon Soul. After the death of the twilight dragon &lt;a href=\"Ultraxion\"&gt;Ultraxion&lt;/a&gt;, Thrall unleashed the freshly infused Dragon Soul upon its creator. Wounded, Deathwing fled toward the Maelstrom, attempting to return to the relative safety of &lt;a href=\"Deepholm\"&gt;Deepholm&lt;/a&gt;. Thrall, the Aspects, and the adventurers boarded the gunship &lt;a href=\"the%20Skyfire\"&gt;the Skyfire&lt;/a&gt; and gave chase, fighting an army of twilight drake riders, led by &lt;a href=\"Warmaster%20Blackhorn\"&gt;Warmaster Blackhorn&lt;/a&gt;, along the way.\nUpon catching the Black Aspect, the adventurers leapt from the decks of the Skyfire, parachuted onto &lt;a href=\"Spine%20of%20Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing's back&lt;/a&gt;, and began prying away the elementium armor that protected the Aspect, eventually exposing enough of his warped body for Thrall to blast Deathwing with the Dragon Soul. Deathwing, critically wounded, fell from the sky and crashed into the Maelstrom. Proclaiming victory, the defenders of Azeroth briefly rejoiced at having finally defeated the Destroyer, but the celebration was short-lived. Deathwing rose from the Maelstrom, his body mutated into a mass of molten lava and tentacles. The &lt;a href=\"Madness%20of%20Deathwing\"&gt;final battle for Azeroth began&lt;/a&gt; in earnest, until one final blast from the Dragon Soul infused with the complete essence of each Aspect completely obliterated the fallen Aspect. With Deathwing truly defeated, the Aspects had fulfilled their duty of protecting Azeroth from the Hour of Twilight and the ancient powers granted to them by the Titans were expended; ushering in the &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Mortals\"&gt;Age of Mortals&lt;/a&gt;. As such, they sacrificed their roles as Aspects.\nFortunately, the Aspects are still true to the gifts given to them by the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s, as life, magic, nature, and time last forever.\nUpon remembering the battle against &lt;a href=\"Galakrond\"&gt;Galakrond&lt;/a&gt; and urging of Kalec, Alexstrasza concluded that even though they are no longer Aspects, they are still dragon beings and that they will remain and help the world eventually.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nThe powers of the Aspects coalesced in five scales that could be found in places important to the flights: the &lt;a href=\"Nexus\"&gt;Nexus&lt;/a&gt; for the blue, &lt;a href=\"Neltharion%27s%20Lair\"&gt;Neltharion's Lair&lt;/a&gt; for the black, the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; for the green, &lt;a href=\"Vermillion%20Redoubt\"&gt;Vermillion Redoubt&lt;/a&gt; for the red, and an unknown location for the bronze. The scales were gathered by Alexstrasza, Kalecgos, &lt;a href=\"Ebyssian\"&gt;Ebyssian&lt;/a&gt; in place of Deathwing, &lt;a href=\"Merithra\"&gt;Merithra&lt;/a&gt; in place of Ysera who had died in the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Chronormu\"&gt;Chronormu&lt;/a&gt; in place of Nozdormu whose absence was not commented on. The essences of the five flights were used to empower the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Azeroth\"&gt;Heart of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, a relic created to heal the world after she was stabbed by &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;.\nDragonflight.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Primal%20Incarnates\"&gt;Primal Incarnates&lt;/a&gt;, ancient &lt;a href=\"proto-dragon\"&gt;proto-dragon&lt;/a&gt; enemies of the Dragon Aspects who oppose the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s and embrace the &lt;a href=\"element\"&gt;element&lt;/a&gt;s, return from their imprisonment. Knowing that the Aspects cannot currently defeat the Incarnates as they have been weakened since Deathwing's defeat, Alexstrasza declares that they must find a way to regain their powers.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

The court is made up of the eponymous Harvesters; venthyr that were created or chosen from former mortals by &lt;a href=\"Denathrius\"&gt;Denathrius&lt;/a&gt; to represent certain sins to be used in the name of Revendreth.

The Medallions give each Harvester authority of their respective Ward and duties otherwise, as well as great power.\nThere is &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20the%20Harvesters\"&gt;an area&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;a href=\"Sinfall\"&gt;Sinfall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Nathria\"&gt;Castle Nathria&lt;/a&gt; with the same name. The Harvesters were originally created in &lt;a href=\"Sinfall\"&gt;Sinfall&lt;/a&gt;, but of the original Harvesters only two remain: Prince Renathal and the Curator. The original Stonewright still exists, but she was stripped of her power; the current Stonewright was the first mortal soul to be sired to become a venthyr.\nIf a medallion is stolen from a Harvester, so long as it is not removed from Revendreth, the Harvesters are able to locate it by summoning &lt;a href=\"manifestation\"&gt;manifestation&lt;/a&gt;s of that sin from the dais of &lt;a href=\"Sinfall\"&gt;Sinfall&lt;/a&gt;."}

Their presence has become more notable recently due to the recent reduction of staffing hours.\nThe Coven in some form has been present since at least 2008, but officially formed as a collective in early 2009.\nThey are responsible for a large number of sticky threads, and guides regularly linked to by the Blizzard posters, as well as some stock replies used by the Blizzard staff.\nCertain members were also instrumental in former Blizzard poster &lt;a href=\"Xemafir\"&gt;Xemafir&lt;/a&gt;'s eventual gift of a hamster desk toy.\nThe Coven's website can be found at &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.bamboobix.info/\"&gt;www.bamboobix.info&lt;/a&gt;\nCoven Members.\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//eu.battle.net/wow/en/character/Trollbane/Amarielle/\"&gt;Amarielle&lt;/a&gt;.\nAmarielle is an experienced player and has been playing for over 4 years.

Can be found posting on the &lt;a href=\"http%3A//forums.wow-europe.com/board.html%3FforumId%3D11079%26amp%3Bsid%3D1\"&gt;Technical Support&lt;/a&gt; forums very frequently.\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//eu.battle.net/wow/en/character/Alonsus/Hazegood/\"&gt;Hazegood&lt;/a&gt;.\nHas been playing WoW for over 3 years, although did take 3 months away due to illness, a regular poster on the EU forums. Originally coined 'The Coven' name in a thread response, this was later adapted to 'Coven of the Blue Panda' by other members.

Possibly the youngest member, diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome which he believes makes him \"a bit slow on the answers\". He believes his key ability is to sort out the more lesser issues which the Coven does not continuously spam around such as harassment or posts posted on the wrong forum to different forums.\nBecause of his disability, he has had conflicts, and his status within the Coven has been questioned by members on his realm. The validity of Jakino's claims of Asperger's have been questioned several times in the past by members of his realms. Jakino overall appears as a normal poster and a good, ordinary individual.\nRegardless of that Jakino is very willing to offer much needed assistance to those who need the help on the In-Game Customer Support forum.\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//eu.battle.net/wow/en/character/Ghostlands/Shammoz/\"&gt;Shammoz&lt;/a&gt;.\nHas been a player for 3 years (Warlock, Shaman, Druid, Priest, Mage (and of course a Death Knight).

{"id": "652877", "revid": "38791128", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=652877", "title": "Covenant", "text": "Covenants are ancient and powerful &lt;a href=\"Organization\"&gt;orders&lt;/a&gt; who rule over the different realms of the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;. They have existed since the Shadowlands were shaped long ago and bear sacred duties to help maintain the afterlife's ecosystem. To achieve their goals within the Shadowlands, players will work hand in hand with these Covenants, and eventually align themselves with one. There are four major Covenants players will encounter:\nWhen players reach maximum level and have explored the first four zones, they'll be able to pledge themselves to a Covenant. Each Covenant offers its champions &lt;a href=\"Ability\"&gt;abilities&lt;/a&gt; based on their choice, including &lt;a href=\"class\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt;-specific abilities for each Covenant, and &lt;a href=\"cosmetic\"&gt;cosmetic&lt;/a&gt; rewards that can be unlocked through a &lt;a href=\"Covenant%20Campaign\"&gt;Covenant Campaign&lt;/a&gt;\u2014an epic storyline unique to the &lt;a href=\"faction\"&gt;faction&lt;/a&gt;\u2014and other activities over time. This alliance also gives the player access to a &lt;a href=\"Covenant%20Sanctum\"&gt;Covenant Sanctum&lt;/a&gt;, a city only open to players who have forged a pact with its rulers.\nOriginally, the plan was make it to be possible to switch covenants, but the price to switch would be costly. In a later interview, Ion Hazzikostas shared that it would be easy to switch to a new Covenant, but not easy to return to one that had already been left.\nHistory.\nBefore the \"Shadowlands\" expansion, each covenant governed over specific zones of the Shadowlands, helping them find a purpose in death. However, because of the constant wars in Azeroth and Sylvanas' machinations, the Maw is stripping all other Shadowlands zones out of &lt;a href=\"anima\"&gt;anima&lt;/a&gt;, the life force responsible to maintain order within the Shadowlands. As such, the different covenants are starved for energy and will need help to regain their former glory.\nSoulbinding.\nWhen you join a Covenant, you'll be able to undergo an ancient rite to bind your &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt; to some of its most powerful members. By doing so, your character harnesses their power, gaining access to powerful bonuses. Over time, you can unlock new tiers of power and even switch &lt;a href=\"Soulbind\"&gt;Soulbind&lt;/a&gt;s when strategy demands it.\nAbilities.\nIf you choose to join a Covenant, you'll gain two abilities tailored to the theme of that Covenant. The first of these is the Covenant's signature ability, which is available to all Covenant members regardless of class, race, or specialization. The second of these abilities is specific to your class and gives you a new spell or power to use in combat."}

Several \"Stay awhile and listen\" dialogues are now available from NPCs throughout the respite, as shown by a large icon above the NPC's head. The icon disappears after the first time the player triggers the dialogue, but the option remains permanently available from the NPCs in case the player wants to see the dialogue again.\nIn addition, a &lt;a href=\"Misplaced%20Venthyr%20Tome\"&gt;Misplaced Venthyr Tome&lt;/a&gt; on the lower level of the respite offers the optional extra quest &lt;a href=\"A%20Loose%20Thread\"&gt;A Loose Thread&lt;/a&gt;.\nMore dialogue is available after the quest in other locations, with some being only accessible to members of the relevant covenant."}

Crabby returned as an April Fool in 2012 and 2013, and has since been incorporated into the Battle.net launcher, as part of the maintenance message when the launcher is unable to access Battle.net.\nAdded in 2015, Crabby also makes an appearance as an in \"&lt;a href=\"Heroes%20of%20the%20Storm\"&gt;Heroes of the Storm&lt;/a&gt;\".

However, every adventurer knows that the more fantastic the treasure, the more powerful its guardians \u2014 and some of the challenges posed by World of Warcraft's Heroic dungeons can be quite daunting.\nWouldn't it be nice to have a helpful friend at your side, ready to provide you with tips and hints when you're stuck? A friend who's there to provide encouragement, who will help you pick yourself up off the floor after the fifteenth wipe of the night? Someone who will stick with you \u2014 no matter what?\nEveryone can use a friend like that... a friend like Crabby!\nSomeone to Watch Over Me.\nYou're a hero. An adventurer. A sword-swinger or spell-slinger for hire. Whatever your character's motivation may be, if trouble doesn't find you, it's because you found trouble first. But what do you do when Asaad throws down a grounding field? How do you respond when the Faceless Corruptors enter Erudax's room? Eventually, you'll be thrown a curve ball that you can't catch. When that happens, you'll be glad to have Crabby at your side!\nCrabby uses a complex and extensive set of context-sensitive situational heuristics to analyze your current status in real-time; that's tech talk for \"Crabby always knows what's up.\" He watches your every move with his all-seeing eyes. Nothing escapes his unwavering gaze; not even the slightest nuance of your play style goes unnoticed. Before long, Crabby will know what you're going to do before you even do it. And he will use this knowledge to help.\nCrabby is able to tell you exactly what's going on and what you should do. His many useful tips will appear in the bottom right corner of your screen, where he hangs out, ever patiently, waiting for you to need his help. Of course, whether you follow his advice or not is entirely up to you; Crabby may possess an advanced level of artificial intelligence, but we're reasonably sure he doesn't have any feelings you could hurt. Reasonably sure. But just in case, the ability to remove Crabby has been disabled for now.\nI've Got You Under My Skin.\nFew things are more fun than plumbing the depths of Azeroth's dungeons with a trusty, unwavering friend at your side. Together with Crabby, your new companion on all your journeys going forward, you can rest assured that no challenge will be beyond your reach.\nEncounter Journal.\nCrabby appears on the top of the &lt;a href=\"Encounter%20Journal\"&gt;Encounter Journal&lt;/a&gt; window.\nQuotes.\nCrabby made its appearance on the WoW Battle.net forums in the bottom right corner of the browser window (requires Flash Player and an ad blocker not configured to block Crabby). Every few seconds, Crabby will popup a message. Some messages contain user dialogue options (italicized below) leading to more messages, creating a dialogue tree. Some of Crabby's messages are exclusive to the section of the website the user is currently browsing; other messages may be presented while browsing any part of the site. There is no option to disable Crabby.\n2012 appearance.\nCrabby returned as an April Fool in 2012. When appearing on the WoW Battle.net forums, he brought a selection of new quotes, as well as a collection of hats. Crabby would initially appear without a hat, but by clicking on Crabby, a randomly selected hat would appear on his head; clicking again would select another. Refreshing the page or loading a new one would work to remove Crabby's hat.\nQuotes.\nIn addition to many of the quotes from his first appearance, 2012 brought many new messages from Crabby, as well as a few modified ones. \"General\" messages could appear while browsing any part of the site, while other types would only appear while browsing the appropriate section. Crabby also accompanies certain messages with a change of expression. \nForums.\nClicking in the text field to post a reply to a forum topic prompts Crabby to immediately reply with the below message. Crabby will present the same message afresh each and every time the user clicks inside the text field.\nBattle.net launcher.\nCrabby appears in the Battle.net launcher when it is experiencing technical difficulties, complete with his array of interchangeable hats. \n\"Heroes of the Storm\".\nFirst discovered in May 2015, Crabby makes a cameo appearance in \"&lt;a href=\"Heroes%20of%20the%20Storm\"&gt;Heroes of the Storm&lt;/a&gt;\", appearing on the character select screen as a talkative constellation.\nNotes.\nCrabby bears a strong resemblance, in looks, interface, and text, to Microsoft Word's office assistant Clippy.\n\"I'm Commander Crabby, and this is my favorite forum on the website!\" is a reference to the video game \"\", specifically the phrase \"I'm Commander Shepard, and this is my favorite store on the Citadel!\"\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

{"id": "27259", "revid": "46586549", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=27259", "title": "Voodoo", "text": "Voodoo (also known as black magic) is a dark and powerful form of &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;, referred to as the \"ancient power of the trolls\" by &lt;a href=\"Rokhan\"&gt;Rokhan&lt;/a&gt;. It is practiced primarily by &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"shadow%20hunter\"&gt;shadow hunter&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"hexxer\"&gt;hexxer&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"witch%20doctor\"&gt;witch doctor&lt;/a&gt;s as well as others. While not practiced by all trolls, voodoo is certainly at least as widespread as &lt;a href=\"cannibalism\"&gt;cannibalism&lt;/a&gt;. Little is known about its emergence among the trolls, since most tribes that possess such knowledge are unwilling to share it with outsiders. However, following the advent of &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari troll&lt;/a&gt;s to &lt;a href=\"Yojamba%20Isle\"&gt;Yojamba Isle&lt;/a&gt;, several notable researchers have come to speculate that voodoo may have originated with the Zandalari. The trolls' use of &lt;a href=\"mojo\"&gt;mojo&lt;/a&gt; in their voodoo magic has long been established. &lt;a href=\"Blood%20magic\"&gt;Drinking blood&lt;/a&gt; provides power, the darkest of voodoo.\nA practitioner of voodoo is sometimes called a voodooist or vodouisant.\nShadow hunters.\nShadow hunters are masters of voodoo magics who can use their spirit-powers to both heal their allies and place curses upon their hapless enemies.\nVoodoo Figurines.\n&lt;a href=\"Voodoo%20Figurine\"&gt;Voodoo Figurine&lt;/a&gt;s, mechanical golems, are powered by &lt;a href=\"Flask%20of%20Mojo\"&gt;flasks of mojo&lt;/a&gt;, troll sweat, the flesh of tribal enemies, or by devouring tiny portions of their owners' &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;s.\nLoa.\nEach of the troll priests within &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Gurub\"&gt;Zul'Gurub&lt;/a&gt; worships a particular &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt;, called a primal god, and has the ability to assume an avatar of that god. For example, &lt;a href=\"High%20Priest%20Venoxis\"&gt;High Priest Venoxis&lt;/a&gt; can become the avatar of &lt;a href=\"Hethiss\"&gt;Hethiss&lt;/a&gt; (a snake).\nThere are four primal gods worshipped in &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt;: the bear, lynx, dragonhawk, and eagle gods. In addition, any spirit of a dead ancestor \u2014 or even the &lt;a href=\"shadow%20ascendant\"&gt;shadow ascendant&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 can be considered loa.\nIn the RPG.\nSome scholars view voodoo as a type of &lt;a href=\"animism\"&gt;animism&lt;/a&gt;, and to an extent that theory is true. The trolls\u2019 religion takes a decidedly different dark bent than the &lt;a href=\"shamanistic\"&gt;shamanistic&lt;/a&gt; beliefs of the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt;, though. Trolls have a complex belief system involving malign spirits and their effect on the world, but no scholar has established what is truth and what is simply long-held belief. The &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear trolls&lt;/a&gt; come from a dark and bloodthirsty history of sacrifice, &lt;a href=\"cannibalism\"&gt;cannibalism&lt;/a&gt; and black magic. They consider spirits to be individuals much like living creatures. Spirits are greedy, hostile and dangerous. Trolls also believe their ancestors linger on as jealous spirits who miss the land of the living and require blood sacrifices to appease them. Trolls sacrifice and eat their enemies. They conduct these practices for two reasons. First, they believe the sacrifice of sapient creatures appeases malicious spirits. Second, they believe that after death, an enemy\u2019s spirit can visit misfortune on its killer. By consuming the flesh of their enemies, trolls believe they can also consume their enemy\u2019s spirit, or at least damage it enough to render it impotent. \nThe orcs\u2019 influence tempers the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear\"&gt;Darkspear&lt;/a&gt; trolls\u2019 spiritual beliefs. The trolls willingly support &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, and they understand that their destructive rituals offend their allies. Under Thrall\u2019s tutelage, the Darkspear trolls abandoned the sacrifice of sapient creatures and took up animal sacrifice instead. These trolls no longer eat their enemies, but practice other methods of trapping, injuring or destroying enemy spirits. These methods include witch doctor blessings, the burning of enemy hearts, drowning corpses and head-shrinking. \n&lt;a href=\"Witch%20doctor\"&gt;Witch doctor&lt;/a&gt;s hold an important position in troll society. Trolls respect their witch doctors as the wisest and most powerful tribe members, and show them courtesy and deference. Trolls are superstitious. They see bad omens everywhere and rely on witch doctors to interpret and exorcise these omens. Witch doctors govern success or failure in battle almost more than the &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s do; trolls believe that a witch doctor who reads the portents correctly and conducts the proper rituals can guarantee success in any endeavor. Until Thrall\u2019s involvement with the Darkspear trolls, only male trolls became witch doctors. Female trolls have since seen the equality other Horde women possess and crave their own emancipation. Despite their efforts, few female witch doctors exist, and those who attempt to take on the role of tribal witch doctor meet with much derision and resistance. Trolls call female witch doctors \u201czufli,\u201d a corruption of the voodoo master prefix \u201czul.\u201d \u201cZufli\u201d is a derogatory term and literally means \u201cbaby witch,\u201d but some females have taken on the title as a mark of pride. \nTroll death rituals used to involve ritual mutilation of the body. The trolls believed that simulating the sacrifice of a corpse distracted nearby malign spirits. The spirits, drawn to the pretend sacrifice, would fail to notice the new spirit entering their world. This allowed the deceased\u2019s spirit to pass more easily into the next world and find a place for itself without harassment. Now trolls avoid these rituals because the Horde finds them disturbing and the rituals evoke unpleasant associations with the Scourge. Trolls frown on cremation, as they believe the body provides the spirit with a tie to the mortal world, and to destroy it sets a spirit adrift and confused for eternity. Recently the trolls have taken to cutting the eyes out of a corpse, thus opening a path into the skull where the spirit resides. Often a witch doctor sacrifices an animal nearby to distract any hungry spirits; if the mourners have no time for such a ritual, they may instead cut their arms and let their blood spill to achieve the necessary distraction. To avoid the possibility of undeath, trolls either bury their comrades\u2019 bodies in hidden places or in sections (usually the body in one place and the head in another).\nTroll head-shrinking.\nSupposedly, upon his death, an enemy\u2019s spirit lingers in his body for a short time. Then the spirit flees the corpse and is free to wreak havoc and revenge on its killer. Troll witch doctors believe that a fallen enemy\u2019s spirit lairs in the corpse\u2019s head before fleeing the body. Trolls who wish to trap enemy spirits often turn to head-shrinking. To shrink a head, a troll first decapitates his fallen\nenemy. Then he makes a slit up the back of the head and carefully removes the skull (which he saves or discards). The troll then sews up the incision and boils the head for two hours to shrink. The troll uses scalding hot rocks and sand to fill the head cavity and shrink the head further. When the head is fistsized and rubbery, the troll sews up the eyes, mouth, and neck with elaborate stitching. The enemy spirit now remains trapped inside the head forever. Most members of the Horde look askance at the practice of head-shrinking, but consider it a step up from human sacrifice and cannibalism. Some trolls have techniques to shrink skulls as well, which involve removing key pieces and reconstructing the skull as a smaller version using animal parts and resins to hold it together."}

Originally called Andrassil, meaning the \"Crown of the Snow\", it was grown from a branch taken from &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s in order to stop the spread of &lt;a href=\"saronite\"&gt;saronite&lt;/a&gt; in the northern continent. Without the blessings of the &lt;a href=\"Aspects\"&gt;Aspects&lt;/a&gt; however, it was vulnerable to the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s' corruption. The ancient druids were forced to fell the tree, which they renamed Vordrassil.\nIt has since become the site of the &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"city\"&gt;city&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Grizzlemaw\"&gt;Grizzlemaw&lt;/a&gt; but since the tree's roots had pierced the prison of the Old God &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt;, it led to the corruption of the furbolg there. Andrassil allowed the Old Gods access into the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;, from which they created the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;.\nWithin the Emerald Dream, Andrassil still stands tall, even as the Emerald Nightmare corrupts the rest of the area.\nParts of the tree include: &lt;a href=\"Vordrassil%27s%20Heart\"&gt;Vordrassil's Heart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vordrassil%27s%20Limb\"&gt;Limb&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vordrassil%27s%20Tears\"&gt;Tears&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"Vordrassil%20Pass\"&gt;passage&lt;/a&gt; through a major portion of the trunk.\nHistory.\n4,500 years before the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt; took branches from &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt;, the World Tree, and planted them over &lt;a href=\"saronite\"&gt;saronite&lt;/a&gt; that had begun to appear across the world. The largest tree grew over a particularly large saronite deposit in the Grizzly Hills; Fandral and his druids named it Andrassil, or \"Crown of the Snow\". &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; and the rest of the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; became furious upon learning that these branches had been planted without their approval. They did, however, agree that the plan seemed to have worked. For several decades, Andrassil towered over Northrend, and all seemed well. Yet in time, circumstances changed. Bloody battles erupted between the &lt;a href=\"taunka\"&gt;taunka&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"forest%20nymph\"&gt;forest nymph&lt;/a&gt;s of Northrend, two races not known for their warring ways. The fighting was sudden and shockingly vicious, filled with barbarism and unspeakably vile acts. Word slowly reached the druids, and the Cenarion Circle launched an expedition to investigate the source of the violence.\nWhat the druids found chilled them to their marrow. Andrassil's roots had reached so deep into the earth that they had touched &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt;'s subterranean prison. The Old God had infused the tree with its foul energies, and thus all living creatures in the area were slowly being driven to madness. The Cenarion Circle knew that, without the blessing of the Aspects, Andrassil was vulnerable to corruption. They were also aware that there was no way to spare the World Tree or ease its suffering, so they decided that the only recourse was to destroy Andrassil. Afterward, it was renamed Vordrassil, or \"Broken Crown.\"\nAlthough killing Andrassil had been a heartbreaking task, the Cenarion Circle was pleased it had stopped the growth of saronite. Yet unbeknownst to the druids, something dark had taken root in the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;. Yogg-Saron had used the trees planted by Fandral as a doorway into the Dream - a doorway through which the other Old Gods could grasp the ethereal domain and well. Small seeds of corruption were spread throughout &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt;'s realm. In time, these seeds polluted the dreamways. This marked the beginning of what would become known as the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe stump that was left behind was eventually taken over by the furbolg tribes, who built the settlement that became &lt;a href=\"Grizzlemaw\"&gt;Grizzlemaw&lt;/a&gt;.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nVordrassil fell to earth in several segments spread across the west-central portion of the Grizzly Hills, where they rooted deep into the ground. Foul oozes surround these segments, known as &lt;a href=\"Vordrassil%27s%20Heart\"&gt;Vordrassil's Heart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vordrassil%27s%20Limb\"&gt;Vordrassil's Limb&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vordrassil%27s%20Tears\"&gt;Vordrassil's Tears&lt;/a&gt;. A corruptive darkness resides in the depths. The corruption also spread to the furbolgs in Grizzlemaw itself, and it was there the Alliance and the Horde began their investigation into what went wrong. &lt;a href=\"Hierophant%20Thayreen\"&gt;Hierophant Thayreen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Windseer%20Grayhorn\"&gt;Windseer Grayhorn&lt;/a&gt; sent Alliance and Horde adventurers, respectively, to collect samples of the oozes growing in the three segments, as well as determining the source of the darkness within them. It was then discovered that the furbolg tribes had managed to resurrect the great &lt;a href=\"bear\"&gt;bear&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Wild%20God\"&gt;Ancient&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ursoc\"&gt;Ursoc&lt;/a&gt;, killed during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; ten thousand years earlier; however, Ursoc's children, &lt;a href=\"Orsonn\"&gt;Orsonn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kodian\"&gt;Kodian&lt;/a&gt;, recognized that their father had been corrupted in the same manner as the furbolgs who restored him, as their blood was tainted with the same darkness as found in the oozes around Vordrassil's shattered remnants.\nThe trail thus led into Grizzlemaw itself, where the furbolg were using seeds left over from Vordrassil's destruction to regrow the tree within the great stump. The adventurers were tasked with burning the sapling growing within its depths and collecting the ashes, as well as collecting Vordrassil's seeds to prevent the furbolg from regrowing it again. Once the ashes were purified, they journeyed to &lt;a href=\"Ursoc%27s%20Den\"&gt;Ursoc's Den&lt;/a&gt; to confront the corrupted Ancient. After defeating him and sprinkling Vordrassil's ashes on his corpse, the freed spirit of Ursoc appeared and revealed the influence of the Old God Yogg-Saron, warning that his influence stretched &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;beyond Vordrassil's roots&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nWithin the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;, Andrassil stands tall even as the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; corrupts the rest of the area."}

He is the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Scryers\"&gt;Scryers&lt;/a&gt; faction.\nBiography.\nVoren'thal was a potent magister that followed Prince &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. When &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; decided to strike against &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt;, believing the naaru's holdings could threaten his own sovereignty over Outland, he left the matter to Kael'thas and his blood elves. The prince ordered Voren'thal to lead the attack, but the battle would end before a single drop of blood was spilled.\nEn route to Shattrath, Voren'thal had a vision of the future: a time when his people would rise up and live free from addiction and despair, restored to their glory. At the heart of the vision was a &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt;, shining its Holy Light over &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; and easing the torment in the soul of every blood elf it touched. Voren'thal was forever changed by this vision. The blood elves that had followed Kael to Outland had languished on the ruined planet with almost nothing to show for it but further pain. Voren'thal knew that the salvation of his race did not lie with his increasingly unstable prince or the capricious Betrayer.\nVoren'thal told his followers of what he had seen, that the key to saving their people may in fact lie with the naaru. Many were optimistic, and shared his sentiments; they were desperate for a new, better path to follow.\nThe blood elf forces approached Shattrath, and the &lt;a href=\"Aldor\"&gt;Aldor&lt;/a&gt; vindicators and exarchs prepared to defend their city. However, the unexpected happened - the blood elves put down their weapons before the draenei defenders. Voren'thal stepped forward and demanded an audience with the master of the &lt;a href=\"Sha%27tar\"&gt;Sha'tar&lt;/a&gt;, the naaru &lt;a href=\"A%27dal\"&gt;A'dal&lt;/a&gt;. As A'dal approached him, Voren'thal went to his knees before the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; and said, \"I've seen you in a vision, naaru. My race's only hope for survival lies with you. My followers and I are here to serve you.\" A'dal accepted the offer of assistance from Voren'thal and his men, who became known as the Scryers. This defection proved to be devastating to Kael, and subsequently to Illidan; Voren'thal's forces had included many of Kael's most gifted scholars and magisters.\nVoren'thal sent word to Kael'thas, urging him to break away from Illidan and lead their people to Shattrath, but Kael was furious that his army had abandoned him to follow the naaru. Publicly, he condemned the act as treason and an attack on his sovereignty as prince. Privately, he saw Voren'thal's defection as evidence of his own failure.\nAfter the defection, Voren'thal and his followers set a base in what is now known as the &lt;a href=\"Scryer%27s%20Tier\"&gt;Scryer's Tier&lt;/a&gt; in the southern part of &lt;a href=\"Shattrath\"&gt;Shattrath&lt;/a&gt;. Voren'thal himself continues to lead the Scryers from within the &lt;a href=\"Seer%27s%20Library\"&gt;Seer's Library&lt;/a&gt; at the center of the Tier, where he directs the Scryers' efforts against both Kael'thas and Illidan.\nBefore he joined Shattrath, at some point he killed &lt;a href=\"Kaylaan\"&gt;Kaylaan&lt;/a&gt;'s brother.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; approached A'dal to ask for help against the Betrayer, the naaru refused to help her but advised her to see Voren'thal. As she turned to leave, she saw a blood elf walking toward her and thought it Voren'thal. She just raced past him and left.\nAccording to the quest text in &lt;a href=\"Turning%20Point\"&gt;Turning Point&lt;/a&gt;, Voren'thal is in rather poor health; he says \"My frail health prevents me from aiding you in person with this endeavor\", indicating that he is not well.\nAlso, according to the quest text in &lt;a href=\"Bound%20for%20Glory%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Bound for Glory&lt;/a&gt;, he also appears to be old in relation to other blood elves; &lt;a href=\"Spymaster%20Thalodien\"&gt;Spymaster Thalodien&lt;/a&gt; says, \"Make sure Voren'thal doesn't topple over with excitement from the news - the old man's getting a bit fragile, if you know what I mean.\", pointing once again to the fact that he Voren'thal ill.\nQuotes.\nThere are those who seek to lie and twist the truth. Seers, on the other hand, bring the truth to light.\nThe purpose of this library, &lt;name&gt;, is to make a seer out of everyone."}
