He may also represent those who have purchased accounts through an auction site on the Internet or used a leveling service to achieve this effect. Finally, &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Awesome\"&gt;Johnny Awesome&lt;/a&gt; is the \"twink\" alt character, the beneficiary of a player's main or older alts that have purchased heirloom (or rare and epic &lt;a href=\"bind%20on%20equip\"&gt;bind on equip&lt;/a&gt;) items to make it overpowered for its level and plow through content easily (and perhaps even having an overbearing sense of entitlement in the process).

As I add the finishing touches, I'd like you to set this incense by the candles near the runestone to my left.\nI believe it will help us to attract the wolf spirit's attention, since it was made in the days of the orcish clans. I can almost imagine my ancestors using it in a ceremony paying tribute to the &lt;a href=\"Lo%27Gosh\"&gt;wolf spirit&lt;/a&gt; after a successful hunt.\nOnce you've placed the incense, I'll begin the ceremony.\nProgress.\nReestablishing ties with the wolf spirit is just the beginning of my journey, not the end. \nCompletion.\nThis is incredible! I set out on this journey unsure of whether the wolf spirit would answer our summons and now it feels as though he's always been here. Perhaps he was, &lt;name&gt;.\nPerhaps he was waiting for the orcs to realize what their choices had wrought. \nGains.\nUpon completion of this quest you will gain:\nNotes.\nThe ceremony plays out as follows:"}

He was previously a a level 60 &lt;a href=\"elite\"&gt;elite&lt;/a&gt; quest giver located inside &lt;a href=\"Scholomance%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Scholomance&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nThird War.\nWeldon Barov escaped from the massacre at &lt;a href=\"Caer%20Darrow\"&gt;Caer Darrow&lt;/a&gt;. He later encountered his &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; brother &lt;a href=\"Alexi%20Barov\"&gt;Alexi&lt;/a&gt; but spared his life.\nInheritance.\nHe is one of the two \"surviving\" (if such can be said about his &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; brother Alexi) descendants of the &lt;a href=\"Barov\"&gt;Barov&lt;/a&gt; family. As such, they are both heirs to the family fortune. Although it is unknown how exactly they intended to deal with obtaining that fortune - since most of it is probably still buried somewhere within the treasuries of &lt;a href=\"Caer%20Darrow\"&gt;Caer Darrow&lt;/a&gt; - the brothers nonetheless sought the four deeds that were believed to be somewhere in &lt;a href=\"Scholomance\"&gt;Scholomance&lt;/a&gt;. This inheritance made them enemies, and Weldon was willing to stop at nothing to become the only surviving heir to the Barov fortune.\nWeldon was affiliated with the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and was located at &lt;a href=\"Chillwind%20Camp\"&gt;Chillwind Camp&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Western Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;. He tasked Alliance adventurers with collecting the family deed as well as with slaying his brother in Tirisfal. Horde adventurers sent by Alexi also attacked him and attempted to seize &lt;a href=\"Head%20of%20Weldon%20Barov\"&gt;his head&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, Alexi seems to have given up battle against Weldon for heritage rights. Weldon, still determined to claim it, asked an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; to bring him all four deeds to &lt;a href=\"Southshore\"&gt;Southshore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tarren%20Mill\"&gt;Tarren Mill&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Brill\"&gt;Brill&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Caer%20Darrow\"&gt;Caer Darrow&lt;/a&gt;. With the deeds in hand, Weldon finally became the rightful owner of the four towns.\nPartnership on Draenor.\nWeldon came to with his brother, Alexi, having made up and become partners in &lt;a href=\"Barov%20Industries\"&gt;Barov Industries&lt;/a&gt;. They had united to plunder the world's riches, but their greed got the better of them and they betrayed each other. Weldon is found under a tree and rescued by the adventurer. After joining the adventurer at &lt;a href=\"Lunarfall\"&gt;Lunarfall&lt;/a&gt;, he asks them once again to kill his brother. He can also be seen watching adventurers fight in the &lt;a href=\"Coliseum\"&gt;Coliseum&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Highmaul\"&gt;Highmaul&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuotes.\nDon't listen to anything Alexi says. He was a fool to stay during the plague and now look at him - he's no better than the other abominations in this place.\nDon't fret, we will reclaim Scholomance and the surrounding lands for the last living son of Barov - the rightful heir.\nAs the last living Barov, I have rightful claim to all of my family's holdings!\nDraenor.\nGarrison.\nMy brother must be brought to justice!\nThis place is quaint. It reminds me of the servant's quarters in my summer retreat on the shores of &lt;a href=\"Lordamere%20Lake\"&gt;Lordamere Lake&lt;/a&gt; - only more rustic. And dirtier.\nPerhaps you should make an investment in some of Barov Industries' wares to secure this make-shift tree fort before a light breeze topples the structure."}

The Well was located on the ancient continent of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor%20%28landmass%29\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; near the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elven&lt;/a&gt; city of &lt;a href=\"Zin-Azshari\"&gt;Zin-Azshari&lt;/a&gt;. The present area where the Well of Eternity was located became the &lt;a href=\"Maelstrom\"&gt;Maelstrom&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Well was the central focus of the Burning Legion's invasion during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, and the area around it served as the final battleground of the conflict. Its waters were so powerful, that the demons hoped to bring &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; himself to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; by turning the Well into a great portal. The Well's ensuing destruction forever spread arcane power throughout the world, physically changed its geography, and heralded a new era in Azerothian history. Shortly after this, a &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity%20%28Hyjal%29\"&gt;second Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; was created at &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, who preserved water from the first Well in magical vials.\nHistory.\nOrigin.\nThe original Well of Eternity was formed from a great wound in Azeroth's surface, created when &lt;a href=\"Aman%27Thul\"&gt;Aman'Thul&lt;/a&gt;, the Highfather of the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;, ripped the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;Y'Shaarj&lt;/a&gt; from the world's crust and tore it apart. The volatile &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; lifeblood of Azeroth's &lt;a href=\"world-soul\"&gt;world-soul&lt;/a&gt; rushed to the surface and roiled over the world. It was through this event that the Pantheon realized that the Old Gods had embedded themselves too deep in Azeroth's surface to remove without severely harming the world-soul, and so they instead resolved to imprison the vile entities below the surface of the world.\nAfter the Old Gods and their &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt; minions had been defeated and sealed in their prisons, the titans' most powerful servants \u2014 the &lt;a href=\"keeper\"&gt;keeper&lt;/a&gt;s \u2014 set to work to seal the still-bleeding wound. After having labored day and night to construct magic wards around the wound, the tumultous arcane energies eventually calmed and settled into balance, and the keepers named it the \"Well of Eternity\". The enormous lake became the true heart of the world's magic and natural power. Drawing its energies from the infinite &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;Great Dark Beyond&lt;/a&gt;, the Well acted as a mystical fount, sending its potent energies out across the world to nourish life in all its wondrous forms. The Well accelerated the cycles of growth and rebirth, and before long, it caused sentient beings to evolve from the land's primitive life forms.\nAncient history.\nKeeper &lt;a href=\"Freya\"&gt;Freya&lt;/a&gt; soon set to work to populate the world with life. She created great enclaves of life at the locations where the Well's energies had coalesced \u2014 the areas that would later become known as &lt;a href=\"Un%27Goro%20Crater\"&gt;Un'Goro Crater&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sholazar%20Basin\"&gt;Sholazar Basin&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt;. The waters also appeared in &lt;a href=\"Thaldraszus\"&gt;Thaldraszus&lt;/a&gt;, but Freya is not stated to have gone there. She nurtured and molded various life forms and seeded them around the world, the greatest of which were the colossal animal spirits known as the &lt;a href=\"Wild%20God\"&gt;Wild God&lt;/a&gt;s.\nSome legends say that from this magical ether the &lt;a href=\"silithid\"&gt;silithid&lt;/a&gt; were born.\nAmong the first and most prolific creatures to emerge from the primordial wilderness were the &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s. In time, a tribe of &lt;a href=\"dark%20troll\"&gt;dark troll&lt;/a&gt;s came to settle near the translucent waters of the Well. Over time, the Well's cosmic power affected the tribe, making them wise and immortal. Their skin turned various shades of violet, and they gained a shorter, yet more upright stature. Inspired by titanic words found on &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt; relics around the Well's periphery, the tribe adopted the name \"&lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;kaldorei&lt;/a&gt;\", meaning \"children of the stars\". They believed that their moon goddess, &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;, slept within the Well's shimmering depths during the daylight hours.\nThe night elves and the War of the Ancients.\nThe kaldorei, or \"night elves\", soon built a wondrous society around the Well. They built their capital, &lt;a href=\"Zin-Azshari\"&gt;Elun'dris&lt;/a&gt;, on the Well's shores and honed their ties with the surrounding woodlands. Soon, however, a small group of elves, later known as the &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt;, became obsessed with unlocking the Well's secrets and began rigorously studying the lake's arcane energies. It is said the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Zin-Azshari\"&gt;Heart of Zin-Azshari&lt;/a&gt; was key in the elves' dominance of the Well of Eternity. It was considered forbidden to take water from the Well, and even the Highborne wouldn't think of it, for the tale of &lt;a href=\"Aru-Talis\"&gt;Aru-Talis&lt;/a&gt; warned of using the Well's powers against itself.\nLater, &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; convinced &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt; and her Highborne to create a portal in the Well, leading to the first invasion of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Following the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, the Well of Eternity was destroyed, and most of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor%20%28landmass%29\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; with it, leaving only the &lt;a href=\"Maelstrom\"&gt;Maelstrom&lt;/a&gt;.\nHowever, &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; had filled seven magical vials with water from the Well of Eternity, and he poured three of the magical vials of water into the lake at the top of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, creating a new Well. For this insane act, his brother &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion&lt;/a&gt; and the demigod &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt; imprisoned him deep beneath Mount Hyjal. The new Well was completely covered by the growth of the &lt;a href=\"World%20Tree\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt;, bringing it into balance, further aided by the enchantments of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt;.\nHowever, Illidan had not emptied all of his vials in creating the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity%20%28Hyjal%29\"&gt;second Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; (which is why the Aspects were able to enchant the World Tree with no interference). Somehow, the Highborne under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Dath%27Remar%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Dath'Remar Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; had acquired one of the remaining vials and, after founding their new homeland of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, used it to create the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;. At least two of the last three vials somehow found their way back into Illidan's possession, and he gave one each to his lieutenants, &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Vashj\"&gt;Lady Vashj&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;. They remained in their possession until the &lt;a href=\"Scale%20of%20the%20Sands\"&gt;Scale of the Sands&lt;/a&gt; recruited &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to take them back. These vials are now in the hands of &lt;a href=\"Soridormi\"&gt;Soridormi&lt;/a&gt;, prime mate of &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt;.\nAppearance.\nThe first Well of Eternity was an incandescent and shimmering lake of energy. As the &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt;'s obsession with the Well grew, they recklessly drew magic from its depths, throwing it into constant turmoil. Dark storms broke out over its surface, and its waters darkened until they became utterly black. The physical dimensions of the Well were only a trick of the mind. The true Well existed in a thousand dimensions, a thousand places, simultaneously.\nAlthough the original Well of Eternity appears in the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity%20%28instance%29\"&gt;titular five-player dungeon&lt;/a&gt;, it's portrayed as considerably smaller than in lore, as well as much smaller than the in-game portrayal of the &lt;a href=\"Maelstrom\"&gt;Maelstrom&lt;/a&gt; which occupies the exact same space.\nIllidan splashes himself with &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.wowhead.com/spell%3D103952/waters-of-eternity\"&gt;Waters of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; during the last part of the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Well of Eternity dungeon&lt;/a&gt;. This lets the nearby &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s resist the flames of an &lt;a href=\"Abyssal%20Doombringer\"&gt;Abyssal Doombringer&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpeculation.\nThe final vial.\nSpeculation about the final vial Illidan took from the Well points to its original host. It is unknown whether or not Illidan was in possession of it at the time of his death at the former &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Karabor\"&gt;Temple of Karabor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is also possible (but not certain) that the final vial was used by Illidan during the War of the Ancients, to defend himself against the &lt;a href=\"Abyssal%20Doombringer\"&gt;Abyssal Doombringer&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; instance. The uncertainty stems from a scene where Malfurion sees Illidan with his hand in the Well after the battle, leading to the possibility that he may have refilled it.\nIn \"\", &lt;a href=\"Kanrethad%20Ebonlocke\"&gt;Kanrethad Ebonlocke&lt;/a&gt; notes that the powers of the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Lost%20Souls\"&gt;Shrine of Lost Souls&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt; are very similar to the Well of Eternity. Thus, it is likely that Illidan used the final vial to power the shrine as a source of arcane power to help assuage his allies' fel addiction.\nThe Elemental Plane.\nThe Well of Eternity may have had some sort of connection to the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Plane\"&gt;Elemental Plane&lt;/a&gt;, as the Maelstrom was used by &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; to escape from &lt;a href=\"Deepholm\"&gt;Deepholm&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Sharas%27dal%2C%20Scepter%20of%20Tides\"&gt;Sharas'dal, Scepter of Tides&lt;/a&gt;, made with water from the Well, is described as being made of \"living water\" and is capable of controlling creatures of the sea such as &lt;a href=\"sea%20giant\"&gt;sea giant&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"makrura\"&gt;makrura&lt;/a&gt;."}

This well is referred to as the second Well of Eternity, the first having sat at the center of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor%20%28landmass%29\"&gt;Ancient Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; for countless millennia before its eventual destruction. The second Well of Eternity glows with an intense blue radiance and remains pure due to the deep roots of Nordrassil. The World Tree was designed to keep others from abusing the magic of the new Well, and also to prevent the second fount's power from growing too great overtime.\nAt the end of the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, when &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;the original well&lt;/a&gt; imploded in on itself, the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; rescued several vials of its waters from destruction. After the ensuing &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, he would forge a new, second Well of Eternity using three of these vials. However, Illidan's actions were regarded as a crime by his kin; to both protect and control this new font of power, Nordrassil was grown atop it.\nSince its birth, the second Well has been a target of destructive forces, and was unsuccessfully attacked by the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; during both their &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;second&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third&lt;/a&gt; invasions of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nBirth.\nThe first &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; sat at the center of the ancient continent of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor%20%28landmass%29\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; since its formation by the &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt;s, existing as the very lifeblood of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"world-soul\"&gt;world-soul&lt;/a&gt; made manifest. Its constructive power gave birth to the &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Empire\"&gt;Kaldorei Empire&lt;/a&gt;, but also drew the attention of the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Though their following invasion failed, the Well was irreparably destabilized and collapsed in on itself in a &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;vast explosion&lt;/a&gt;.\nJust prior to the Well's death, the legendary &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; secretly gathered seven vials of its waters. Illidan remained convinced that a new font of power would be needed if the demons' were to return, and hoped to create a new Well of Eternity to realize this. The other kaldorei survivors, however, would consider Illidan's plan both dangerous and insane, for it was the Well's power which first drew the Legion to Azeroth.\nIllidan traveled to a lake at the summit of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, a body of water luckily untouched by the war. There, he began emptying the vials of the Well's water into the lake, which began to take on the properties of the Well of Eternity. By the third vial, he was interrupted by the other night elves present, who were horrified upon realizing exactly what Illidan was doing. When they moved to stop him, Illidan struck at his kin, killing most of them with magical flames. Only the intervention of his brother, &lt;a href=\"Malfurion\"&gt;Malfurion&lt;/a&gt;, halted Illidan's rampage. However, even three out of seven of the vials was enough to transform the lake into something approaching the previous Well.\nA second Well of Eternity had been created, possessing a large portion of the enchanting and dangerous power of the first. With the help of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspect\"&gt;Dragon Aspect&lt;/a&gt;s, Malfurion and the other night elves oversaw the planting of a &lt;a href=\"World%20Tree\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt; above the new font, anxious to protect and contain its energies. The three Aspects present (&lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt;) also placed their own enchantments on the tree. Over the following millennia, Nordrassil and the second Well became sacred to the new night elf civilization, who guarded both with fierce determination.\nThird War.\nAs was feared during its creation, the existence of a new Well of Eternity would become another target for the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. After over 10,000 years, the demonic armies of &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; once more &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;invaded&lt;/a&gt; the world. Leading the assault, &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; the Defiler marched on &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; with the Well and World Tree as his goals. The Legion planned to consume the concentrated, powerful energies contained within Well and use its power to form a powerful gateway for the Legion and conquer Azeroth once and for all.\nThough they mounted a defense, both individually and eventually united, the races of Azeroth could not withstand the Legion's relentless advance. In a last ditch effort, armies of the kaldorei, &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Human%20Expedition\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; tried to hold Archimonde back at Hyjal's summit to buy time for Malfurion Stormrage. When the Defiler reached Nordrassil and victory seemed at hand, a trap was sprung. A great explosion detonated by &lt;a href=\"wisp\"&gt;wisp&lt;/a&gt;s vaporized the &lt;a href=\"demon%20lord\"&gt;demon lord&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to severely damaging the World Tree. Nevertheless, both the Well of Eternity and the tree survived, and were safe for the time being, although the Tree's Dragon Aspect blessings were nevertheless depleted and the kaldorei permanently lost their &lt;a href=\"immortality\"&gt;immortality&lt;/a&gt; as a result.\nCataclysm.\nThe Well was left untouched for many years following the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, while Azeroth's &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s maintained a close watch on it and &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, both would be threatened by the &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt; invasion of &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt;, the Firelord. The very shores of the Well would became a base for the &lt;a href=\"Guardians%20of%20Hyjal\"&gt;Guardians of Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;. After much fighting throughout the region, this attack was eventually defeated.\nLegion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the demons once again targeted the Well atop &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;. The Legion wanted to open a gateway within the pool itself, and spill forth to overwhelm the area's defenders. &lt;a href=\"Druid\"&gt;Druid&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Dreamgrove\"&gt;Dreamgrove&lt;/a&gt; arrived to drive back the invaders, also seeking the waters of the Well in order to purify &lt;a href=\"G%27Hanir\"&gt;G'Hanir&lt;/a&gt;. Together, they drove the demons back and slew their leader &lt;a href=\"Destromath\"&gt;Destromath&lt;/a&gt;. This harmed the Well terribly but, despite being heavily depleted, so long as a single drop remains, it endures.\nLater, the Well is shown whole when the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Archdruid&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Remulos\"&gt;Keeper Remulos&lt;/a&gt; and several other druids attempted to commune with &lt;a href=\"Malorne\"&gt;Malorne&lt;/a&gt;. Later, the &lt;a href=\"Alor%27idal%20Crystal\"&gt;Alor'idal Crystal&lt;/a&gt; given by Illidan to Tyrande summoned past visions of Tyrande, Illidan and Malfurion that transformed into sparkles and dived into the Well.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt; scars and &lt;a href=\"Azerite%20elemental\"&gt;elementals&lt;/a&gt; appeared at the roots of Nordrassil. &lt;a href=\"Aviana\"&gt;Aviana&lt;/a&gt; came to aid, fighting against an &lt;a href=\"Azerite%20Leviathan\"&gt;Azerite Leviathan&lt;/a&gt; that had emerged in the lake.\nAfter the war, when &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Calia%20Menethil\"&gt;Calia Menethil&lt;/a&gt; went to a meeting with &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; in Nordrassil, Calia noticed faerie dragons chasing each other across the surface of the lake below Nordrassil. The Horde leaders met with the night elven co-leaders in a bower on a hill, on the opposite side of the lake from Nordrassil Inn.\nIn the RPG.\nFollowing its birth, to protect the &lt;a href=\"World%20Tree\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt; and continue to guard the Well, Malfurion gathered all the druids into a conclave, where they underwent a great slumber, sending their spirits into the Emerald Dream. A great barrier of mist grew around Kalimdor, to prevent eyes even in Azeroth from finding the Well. Thanks to the World Tree, the Well of Eternity itself no longer provided the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; with such a potent source of corruption.\nThe glowing, swirling pool ways once a sizable lake. It extends around Nordrassil, creating a layer of protection around the Tree. Its mystic power is so potent that none who attempt to drunk from it - or, foolishly, swim in it - can hope to survive, assuming that the ambassadors would let anyone get close enough to make the attempt. The &lt;a href=\"Eternity%20Bridge\"&gt;Eternity Bridge&lt;/a&gt; arcs from the south shore of the Well to the massive roots of Nordrassil. The magic of the Well and the Tree make the creatures of Hyjal stronger and smarter than those anywhere else on Kalimdor.\nCoveted by demons, warlocks, and many mages, the well is currently the greatest source of arcane magic in the world. While the World Tree's powers have suppressed the corrupting nature of this magic for centuries, if the tree were ever destroyed, this Well would be the source of unfathomable power to an evil creature powerful enough to wield it. The Tree and the Well are now guarded by the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"bronze%20dragonflight\"&gt;bronze dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; feared that the remaining &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s were tunneling from the &lt;a href=\"Darkwhisper%20Gorge\"&gt;Darkwhisper Gorge&lt;/a&gt; closer to the Well. Eventually, &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragon\"&gt;blue dragon&lt;/a&gt;s discovered that demons led by an &lt;a href=\"eredar%20warlock\"&gt;eredar warlock&lt;/a&gt; were draining the waters of the Well into the tunnels. The warlock planed to consume the water in a ritual in an attempt to gain enough power to resurrect &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; believed that the water from the Well of Eternity could restore the defiled &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; wanted to create another Well of Eternity on &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; to fuel his &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;' &lt;a href=\"magical%20addiction\"&gt;magical addiction&lt;/a&gt;."}

The second instance is situated in a pre-&lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Sundering&lt;/a&gt; Kalimdor, over ten thousand years in the past, during the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;first invasion of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.

There's only one artifact with the power to weaken the Black Scourge, but it has long since been destroyed: the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt; (a.k.a Demon Soul). To retrieve the golden disc the Aspects must charge the heroes of Azeroth with its retrieval from the depths of time. Deathwing first unleashed the power of the Dragon Soul to stop &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; from entering Azeroth through the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;. That means sending players to the Caverns of Time and &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt;. Upon arriving, the Aspect of Time will tell them that his ability to send them back to the battle at the Well of Eternity is being interfered with by an entity in the future. First then, players must go forward into the &lt;a href=\"End%20Time\"&gt;End Time&lt;/a&gt; and kill &lt;a href=\"Murozond\"&gt;Murozond&lt;/a&gt;. Within they'll witness a charred vision of the world should the plan to defeat Deathwing fail. With Murozond's defeat, players will be able to venture into the past and partake in the near-apocalyptic clash at the Well of Eternity. There, players will fight alongside such prominent characters of Warcraft lore as &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;. They'll see the demon &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt; and the delusional highborne queen, &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt;.\nDungeon Journal.\n\"Ten-thousand years in the past, the night elven capital city of Zin-Azshari was a magnificent sparkling metropolis. Situated on the shores of the Well of Eternity, it was here that the aristocratic Highborne first opened a portal into the Twisting Nether and invited the Burning Legion to invade Azeroth. Under the command of the night elven queen, Azshara, they now pour their energies into the portal, preparing it for the terrifying and glorious entrance of the demon god Sargeras.\"\nDescription from site.\n\"With a gateway to the past now open, &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt; will transport players to &lt;a href=\"Azshara%27s%20Palace\"&gt;Azshara's palace&lt;/a&gt;, where you'll witness one of the most catastrophic events in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, dating back 10,000 years. While assisting the much younger Tyrande and Illidan in a battle against the Highborne and Burning Legion, players will need to steal the Dragon Soul hovering above the Well. With so many of Azshara's most empowered wizards locked in ritual and pouring their magical energies into the turbulent depths of the Well, retrieving the Dragon Soul will require victory over some lethal foes.\"\n\"The task at hand requires nothing short of total success. In order for &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and the Dragon Aspects to rally heroes of the Horde and Alliance to defeat &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, you must steal the Dragon Soul from the distant past. However, the tragic events which took place at the Well of Eternity must ultimately come to pass, leading to the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Maelstrom\"&gt;Maelstrom&lt;/a&gt;, and the loss of countless lives.\"\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

They are indigenous to &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; but can also be found in the mountains of &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Morogh\"&gt;Dun Morogh&lt;/a&gt;. Cannibalistic, savage and exceedingly voracious, wendigo are solitary by nature and rarely live amongst others of their kind. They are highly territorial and do not take kindly to intruders strumbling into their hunting grounds.\nThe wendigo of Northrend are believed by many to be the primordial cousins of the southern variety that dwell in Dun Morogh. They differ in appearance from their southern cousins, being significantly larger with more ape-like builds and curved horns. Though rarely seen, the existence of the northern wendigo is evidenced by the fierce, primal roars that echo across Northrend's mist-shrouded peaks. Dwelling in bone-littered caves and venturing out only to hunt, they are ferocious and aggressively defend their lairs, food supply, and young from any perceived threat. &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s who do not wish to be added to the wendigo's bone-mounds would be wise to run at the sound of their savage bellows.\nWendigo, along with &lt;a href=\"ice%20troll\"&gt;ice troll&lt;/a&gt;s, were among the races enslaved by the newly created &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; shortly after the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt; crashed into the &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt; glacier. After the end of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, a group of dead wendigos was found by &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Korialstrasz&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Nexus\"&gt;Nexus&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey often have frost breaths or frost roars attacks.\nWarcraft III.\nIn ' and ', wendigos appeared as white-furred humanoid &lt;a href=\"creep\"&gt;creep&lt;/a&gt;s. Some of them showed signs of intelligence, with the ability to use &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;- or &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;-like abilities like &lt;a href=\"Reincarnation\"&gt;Reincarnation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rejuvenation\"&gt;Rejuvenation&lt;/a&gt;.\nWarcraft Adventures: Lord of the Clans.\nIn the canceled \"\", wendigo were shown to live around the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Valley\"&gt;Frostwolf Settlement&lt;/a&gt; area. One of them had killed the wolf mount of &lt;a href=\"Nazgrel\"&gt;Nazgrel&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; saved the orc by scaring the beast away with fire. The &lt;a href=\"raider\"&gt;raider&lt;/a&gt; turned out ungrateful about this help, for the wendigo was initially the target of his hunt.\nIn the RPG.\nWendigo often range in levels of 5-7 and are often hunted en masse in central Dun Morogh. Wendigo can be skinned at apprentice level.\nThe indigenous wendigo of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; are exceedingly voracious creatures. Cannibalistic and savage, these fur-covered humanoids are very territorial and do not take kindly to intruders stumbling into their hunting grounds. They take even less kindly to those who enter their lands intentionally. This tall, muscular humanoid is covered in shaggy fur. Its feet and clawed hands are huge, and a pair of deadly horns crowns its head. The hulking humanoid stand 10 feet tall. It looks vaguely ogre-like but is covered in a fury white pelt. Sharp claws extend from its large hand and its mouth stretches in a ravenous grin as it shambles forward. Wendigo are fierce predators that are fond of human and orc flesh. Solitary by nature, they seldom live among others of their kind. The only exception is when offspring must be reared, which the parents do as a family. Wendigo typically give birth to two young per litter. The parents drive off the young once they reach maturity, then go their own separate ways as well. (A wendigo is considered fully mature when it reaches nine years). Otherwise, an encounter between two wendigo always ends in the death of one, even during times of mating. Each wendigo controls miles of territory. It is not unusual for one to spend weeks hunting a single meal.\nWendigo are bestial, cave-dwelling humanoids. Barely intelligent, these creatures prefer to remain hidden when travelers pass close to their territory. A wendigo\u2019s behavior turns aggressive, however, if a visitor overstays his welcome or threatens the yeti\u2019s family. It is possible for a small tribe of wendigo to go unnoticed by a nearby community for years. The townsfolk may tell tales of beast-men living in the woods, but few residents, if any, see one directly. Wendigo living in close proximity are not necessarily a threat, and rumors say that some adopt and protect small villages, eliminating dangers from the shadows.\nA wendigo prefers to avoid combat altogether, but once angered, just about the only way to stop it is to slay the beast. Wendigo attack with their claws in combat. They are so adept with their natural weapons that they can fell several lesser creatures in a single round. Even young wendigo can be quite lethal in combat. They are not suicidal, however, and will break off combat with a superior foe. The wendigo will then stalk the prey, biding its time until the target offers the best time to be dispatched.\nAn adult wendigo stands well over 7 feet tall and weighs about 1,200 pounds."}

This camp consisted of many cranes on mountains, a shredder with walkway, an entire lumber mill, a crane with a swinging bunch of logs, and a cave with a see-through wall. There was also a burning airplane (the same as the ones found in Gnomeregan) that sits atop a cliff on the lower part of the mountain wall, not too far above the cave. The plane appears to have crashed into the mountain wall. Further exploration leads to a little cliff, a little to the west of the burning plane, that contained three small helipads. Two of which were occupied by the same type of airplane, one was empty, and one had a deactivated shredder standing next to the ramp that led up to the plane.\nCataclysm.\nThe Logging Camp has been removed.

With the bulk of the Stormwind Army abroad, they barely had enough men to keep the roads of the region safe.

The Garrison holds the community of Westbrook and ensures that gnolls and &lt;a href=\"bandit\"&gt;bandit&lt;/a&gt;s do not gain a strong foothold in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;-held territory.

The town of &lt;a href=\"Hearthglen\"&gt;Hearthglen&lt;/a&gt; was the seat of the regional administration, while the town of &lt;a href=\"Andorhal\"&gt;Andorhal&lt;/a&gt; was the center of grain distribution in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;'s northern provinces.\nKnowing that the quickest way to spread the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;Plague of Undeath&lt;/a&gt; would be via the grain exported from Andorhal, the necromancer &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Cult of the Damned&lt;/a&gt; infected the grain with the Plague, and set up four massive plague cauldrons in the fields of the area's four largest farmsteads. As Lordaeron collapsed, the farmlands and the forests began to die. The trees in the Plaguelands pulsate with tumor-like growths, and the needles of the pines are a sickly brown.\nWith the kingdom collapsed, the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; attempted to salvage what little of their lands remained, taking possession of &lt;a href=\"Mardenholde%20Keep\"&gt;Mardenholde Keep&lt;/a&gt; in Hearthglen as a regional headquarters. In Year 24, the crusade invaded an unnamed settlement, killing its living inhabitants.\nSome time later after the fall of the Scarlet Crusade and the war in Outland, &lt;a href=\"War%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;the fight against the Scourge&lt;/a&gt; was brought to &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; and victory claimed by the &lt;a href=\"Ashen%20Verdict\"&gt;Ashen Verdict&lt;/a&gt;, the town of Hearthglen was reclaimed by its former lord and the leader of &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt;, Tirion Fordring; it now serves as a main base of operations and training ground for the Argent Crusaders in Lordaeron.\nThe plague covering the region was mostly dispelled during the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, thanks to the efforts of the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt;. Although life started to emerge once again, war still raged places as &lt;a href=\"Andorhal\"&gt;Andorhal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gahrron%27s%20Withering\"&gt;Gahrron's Withering&lt;/a&gt;.

At Hearthglen, &lt;a href=\"Mardenholde%20Keep\"&gt;Mardenholde Keep&lt;/a&gt; has become a training ground for new recruits. The Crusade's reports that &lt;a href=\"Caer%20Darrow\"&gt;Caer Darrow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Scholomance\"&gt;Scholomance&lt;/a&gt; were still active and in operation as a school of necromancy, under the control of &lt;a href=\"Darkmaster%20Gandling\"&gt;Darkmaster Gandling&lt;/a&gt;.\nGetting there.\nThere are several ways to get there on foot (or mounted):\nGeography.\nThe Western Plaguelands contain the instanced dungeon &lt;a href=\"Scholomance\"&gt;Scholomance&lt;/a&gt;, aimed towards level 40 players.

Once at its border, you can see how the land itself grows darker, and a baleful shadow seems to engulf the horizon. There are a lot of terrible stories about these lands so it is advised to travelers to proceed with caution because even the air is an enemy in this accursed wasteland.\n&lt;a href=\"Undead\"&gt;Undead&lt;/a&gt; wander the land and haunt the abandoned towns and farmsteads. The largest &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; city here is &lt;a href=\"Andorhal\"&gt;Andorhall&lt;/a&gt;, beneath which is an underground complex housing the undead's &lt;a href=\"Scholomance%23In%20the%20RPG\"&gt;School of Necromancy&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; strikes against the Scourge from &lt;a href=\"Hearthglen\"&gt;Hearthglen&lt;/a&gt;. The only place of any sanity in the Western Plaguelands is &lt;a href=\"Uther%27s%20Tomb\"&gt;Uther's Tomb&lt;/a&gt;, a consecrated monument to the fallen hero &lt;a href=\"Uther%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther Lightbringer&lt;/a&gt;. The tomb is tended by the &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thel%27danis\"&gt;Thel'danis&lt;/a&gt; and he needs all the help he can get.\nHistory.\nOnce &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;'s agricultural center, this region was one of the first to fall to the Scourge. Since that time, the land has wasted and blackened, the trees have fallen to corruption and the undead creatures have tightened their grasp. They wander the landscape and are under the command of &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; in the east and, ultimately, &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;. Scourge forces slay all living creatures within their realm.\nThe Scarlet Crusade also maintains a presence in the Western Plaguelands albeit they are just as nutty as their eastern counterparts. They struggle valiantly and foolishly against the Scourge and send occasional patrols into &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt; who end up killed by the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"dreadlord\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Varimathras\"&gt;Varimathras&lt;/a&gt;. The Western Crusade is led by &lt;a href=\"Taelan%20Fordring\"&gt;Taelan Fordring&lt;/a&gt; and a human priest, &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Inquisitor%20Isillien\"&gt;High Inquisitor Isillien&lt;/a&gt;, who is completely insane, devoted to destroying all undead and anyone else who may carry the plague \u2014 evil or good. He is a thoroughly unpleasant individual wholly absorbed in his mad, vengeful campaign who is manipulating Taelin do fulfill his will.\n&lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt;, the former Paladin Governor of the region and father of Taelin, freed an &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Eitrigg\"&gt;prisoner&lt;/a&gt; some years ago and was banished for it. Since then he has been wandering the land lending help when he can. He is a seasoned warrior and is hoping to rescue his son before the Scarlet Crusade consumes him.\nIn an attempt to expand the Scarlet Crusade's influence, Taelan Fordring led an expedition to retake the small community of &lt;a href=\"Cinderhome\"&gt;Cinderhome&lt;/a&gt; a dozen miles to Hearthglen's east. He and his men slew the undead, but before they could bring in settlers and reinforcements, a Scourge host arrived and laid siege to the village. Tirion Fordring, who observed this whole endeavor, is worried for his son. He desperately needs heroes to help him break through the undead line and save the Crusaders within. He hopes to use this situation as an opportunity to extirpate Taelan from the Crusade's grasp or, failing that, as a way to prove that not all those who wander the Plaguelands are evil.\nGeography.\nThe Western Plaguelands is a flat, gently rolling country dotted with abandoned &lt;a href=\"Farm\"&gt;farms&lt;/a&gt; and windmills that turn forlornly in the tainted air. Stands of enormous toadstools mark where trees once stood. Elevation rises in the south toward the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, and the Western Plaguelands' northern border stretches across Lordaeron's coast.\nThe land resembles the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Eastern Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt; in most respects. The earth is gray and sick with blight. The trees are corrupted and transformed into enormous, spotted mushrooms, and the same &lt;a href=\"Poison%20Mist\"&gt;toxic mist&lt;/a&gt; that pervades the Eastern Plaguelands haunts this realm as well. Even the air seems darker. Though the Scourge capital of &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt; is many miles away, you can still feel Kel'Thuzad's presence in the land. Undead monstrosities roam the land and infest the ruined farmsteads that dot this flat landscape. Scarlet Crusaders fight a hopeless war against the undead.\nThe Western Plaguelands is west of the Eastern Plaguelands, east of Tirisfal Glades and north of the Alterac Mountains. &lt;a href=\"Lordamere%20Lake\"&gt;Lordamere Lake&lt;/a&gt; borders the region to the southwest.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

It is filled with a smoky gray mist and the creatures here are blighted and sick, angrily attacking anyone who wanders too close with surprising ferocity. The land is also home to countless &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; who infest the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Andorhal\"&gt;Andorhal&lt;/a&gt;, the four cauldron fields, and &lt;a href=\"Sorrow%20Hill\"&gt;Sorrow Hill&lt;/a&gt;.

The Scarlet Crusade strikes against the Scourge from Hearthglen. The only place of any sanity in the Western Plaguelands is Uther's Tomb, a consecrated monument to the fallen hero Uther Lightbringer.\nHistory.\nThe area now called the Western Plaguelands was a beautiful forested farmland to the east of the Capital City of Lordaeron. It was the lush eastern belt of the &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt; stretching from Lordaeron in the west to the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Darrowmere Forest&lt;/a&gt; to the east. The town of &lt;a href=\"Hearthglen\"&gt;Hearthglen&lt;/a&gt; was the seat of the regional administration, while the town of &lt;a href=\"Andorhal\"&gt;Andorhal&lt;/a&gt; was the center of grain distribution in the Kingdom of Lordaeron's northern provinces.\nKnowing that the quickest way to spread the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;Plague of Undeath&lt;/a&gt; would be via the grain exported from Andorhal, the necromancer &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Cult of the Damned&lt;/a&gt; infected the grain with the Plague, and set up four massive plague cauldrons in the fields of the area's four largest farmsteads.

With the Kingdom collapsed, the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; attempted to salvage what little of their lands remained, taking possession of &lt;a href=\"Mardenholde%20Keep\"&gt;Mardenholde Keep&lt;/a&gt; in Hearthglen as a regional headquarters. The &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt; also has a presence here, including setting up a &lt;a href=\"Chillwind%20Camp\"&gt;camp&lt;/a&gt; near the overcrowded cemetery at &lt;a href=\"Sorrow%20Hill\"&gt;Sorrow Hill&lt;/a&gt; for the Alliance, aiding the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; in reinforcing their &lt;a href=\"bulwark\"&gt;bulwark&lt;/a&gt; on the eastern border of Tirisfal, and sending soldiers of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; into battle against the Scourge.\nDespite being where the Plague took hold in Lordaeron, the Western Plaguelands are in surprisingly better condition (though still quite dead) than the Eastern Plaguelands. It is clear that the land is trying to resist the Plague with what little it has left.\nGetting there.\nThere are several ways to get there on foot (or mounted):\nGeography.\nThe Western Plaguelands contain the instanced dungeon &lt;a href=\"Scholomance\"&gt;Scholomance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dungeon\"&gt;micro dungeon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Hearthglen\"&gt;Hearthglen&lt;/a&gt;.

At Chillwind Camp, &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Ashlam%20Valorfist\"&gt;Commander Ashlam Valorfist&lt;/a&gt; seeks aid in the battle against the Scourge. At Caer Darrow, &lt;a href=\"Eva%20Sarkhoff\"&gt;Eva Sarkhoff&lt;/a&gt; attempts to rid the Scholomance of its most powerful evils. At Andorhal, the bronze dragon &lt;a href=\"Chronormu\"&gt;Chronormu&lt;/a&gt; sends bold adventurers into the ruins in search of temporal anomalies."}

Ravaged by the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, this rich lands of rolling pastures and farms were once beautiful and green, until they were afflicted by drought and the mistreatment inflicted by the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;, an organization of former &lt;a href=\"Stonemasons%20Guild\"&gt;stonemasons&lt;/a&gt; who became bandits under the command of &lt;a href=\"Edwin%20VanCleef\"&gt;Edwin VanCleef&lt;/a&gt;. The grass is yellowed, the fields are infested with ravenous &lt;a href=\"carrion%20bird\"&gt;carrion bird&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"mechanical\"&gt;mechanical&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"harvest%20watcher\"&gt;harvest watcher&lt;/a&gt;s who have gone rogue, and years of neglect and conflict have not improved the situation.\nAfter years of corruption and internal political conflicts caused by the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragon\"&gt;black dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Onyxia&lt;/a&gt;, Stormwind has been working hard to secure and renovate the region. The &lt;a href=\"Westfall%20Brigade\"&gt;Westfall Brigade&lt;/a&gt; under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Gryan%20Stoutmantle\"&gt;Marshal Gryan Stoutmantle&lt;/a&gt;, formerly known as the &lt;a href=\"People%27s%20Militia\"&gt;People's Militia&lt;/a&gt;, erected a bastion of military power in the region at &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20Hill\"&gt;Sentinel Hill&lt;/a&gt; from where they issue commands to anyone willing to aid the cause, and thus succeeded in defeating the Defias Brotherhood. Although most of the area's farms have fallen to disrepair, there are still farmers who bravely cling to their holdings.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, discontent roared in Westfall, where many people living became homeless and bankrupt as a result of the costs of the &lt;a href=\"War%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;campaign in Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. Now inhabited by transients, homeless citizens, and drifters, the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; made a resurgence under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Vanessa%20VanCleef\"&gt;Vanessa VanCleef&lt;/a&gt;, daughter and successor of Edwin, and attempted to rally the discontented masses in &lt;a href=\"Moonbrook\"&gt;Moonbrook&lt;/a&gt;. While they managed to burn Sentinel Hill to the ground, they were once again defeated by the adventurers and the forces of the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Army\"&gt;Stormwind Army&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the years that followed, the kingdom continued to support the region, waging a war against banditry and the &lt;a href=\"Riverpaw%20pack\"&gt;Riverpaw pack&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt;s. Following his coronation, &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;'s reforms brought more aid to the region, which extinguished the spark of the revolution. He also gave the royal pardon and reparations to the former &lt;a href=\"Stonemasons%20Guild\"&gt;Stonemasons&lt;/a&gt; and their families hidden in the region, allowing them to end their life of banditry and return to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Breadbasket%20Guild\"&gt;Breadbasket Guild&lt;/a&gt; was later formed by the farmers to revitalize the region with the support of the kingdom.\nHistory.\nCenturies ago, throughout the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;, the disparate human nations flourished, among them the smallest and most isolated of the kingdoms was &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;. Over the years, it found prosperity through the farmsteads that dotted the surrounding fertile region, and as its population grew, small towns sprang up in the nearby regions, notably Westfall, which became the breadbasket of the kingdom.\nDuring the reign of &lt;a href=\"Barathen%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Barathen Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt;s began launching brazen attacks on &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;, but it quickly became clear that these assaults were merely distractions. While soldiers defended the city against a large number of enemies, they could only send a few troops to protect the agricultural lands, and Westfall farmsteads were burned during what was called the &lt;a href=\"Gnoll%20War\"&gt;Gnoll War&lt;/a&gt;. At the end of the war, the gnolls were wiped out following the death of their leader, and the kingdom regained control of its lands which were rebuilt.\nYears later, a &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20tribe\"&gt;Gurubashi&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jungle%20troll\"&gt;trolls&lt;/a&gt; raiding party slipped through Stormwind's patrol lines and cut a path of destruction through Westfall, burning three towns to the ground. Stormwind's soldiers eventually caught and slew the raiders, but it was too late for dozens of humans, and their deaths were gruesome. This sparked talks among the Stormwind leadership, which then led to the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20War\"&gt;Gurubashi War&lt;/a&gt;.\nEventually, during the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, the Warchief Blackhand ordered raiding parties to cut deep into Stormwind's lands, as he wanted to drive the human populace to panic. Entire villages in Westfall fell to the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s control, with their inhabitants either killed or forced to flee. Following the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, the territories of Stormwind were reclaimed by the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; and the returning Stormwindians, with the help of the &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Supreme Commander Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; who oversaw the efforts to repatriate the kingdom's citizens and to secure &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;'s place as the next king.\nRise of the Defias.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Stonemasons%20Guild\"&gt;Stonemasons Guild&lt;/a&gt; spent years toiling to rebuild &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;, they were left broke, as their fees and salaries were left unpaid and unspoken for by the city's officials. When the time of the rightful payment came, the nobles of Stormwind couldn't because they ran up a huge debt by expanding the kingdom's military presence through &lt;a href=\"Elwynn%20Forest\"&gt;Elwynn&lt;/a&gt; and into &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn&lt;/a&gt;, and the massive debt crippled the kingdom's economy. In the shadow, &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Lady Katrana Prestor&lt;/a&gt; manipulated both sides with the &lt;a href=\"%3ADrakefire%20Amulet\"&gt;:Drakefire Amulet&lt;/a&gt; - her meddling in the rebuilding of Stormwind left the nobility unsatisfied with the craftsmanship of the guild, while the workers were enraged that the nobility despised them and were threatening to withhold payment. When the Guildmaster &lt;a href=\"Edwin%20VanCleef\"&gt;Edwin VanCleef&lt;/a&gt; spoke out, demanding restitution for their works, the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Nobles\"&gt;House of Nobles&lt;/a&gt; ordered the guild disbanded, and it turned into a heated dispute, which resulted in riots that led to the murder of &lt;a href=\"Tiffin%20Ellerian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Queen Tiffin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn response, &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; vowed to punish those responsible and dealt with the rioters more severely. The Stonemasons, fleeing the city, hid in the rural areas of Westfall to escape prosecution. Knowing Varian's anger would never fade, many were forced to remain in hiding. From the shadows, &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Onyxia&lt;/a&gt; continued to stoke their rage by using her influence to cut off supplies and support to the region. They became the terrorist organization known as the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;, and under &lt;a href=\"Edwin%20VanCleef\"&gt;Edwin VanCleef&lt;/a&gt;'s reign, they turned to &lt;a href=\"bandit\"&gt;bandit&lt;/a&gt;ry and murder to recover the gold owed to them. While Lady Prestor's political machinations caused chaos in the kingdom, the Defias sowed anarchy and terror in the lands of Stormwind for the next decade.\nConsequently, Westfall started to grow fallow after years of conflict and neglect had diminished its harvests. Crops could eventually no longer be cultivated in the fields, and the once-abundant &lt;a href=\"mine\"&gt;mine&lt;/a&gt;s were ultimately deserted. Even the former defenders from the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Guard\"&gt;Stormwind Guard&lt;/a&gt; pulled stake and abandoned the lonely realm when the cost of upkeep became too great. Over the years, the ranks of the Brotherhood grew to include the skilled, the desperate, and the outcast.\nJourney of Brann.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the dwarf &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; traveled south from &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt; to survey the lands of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28continent%29\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. When he came to Westfall, he was surprised at finding only abandoned farms and countless acres of abandoned cropland. He later inspected a few of the scattered, lonely farms, and only found a few discarded mementos of the humans who had once toiled ceaselessly over the region. When he arrived at the abandoned mining town named Moonbrook, he fought agents of the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"harvest%20golem\"&gt;harvest golem&lt;/a&gt;, and left Westfall in the direction of &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt;.\nBloodsail Buccaneer.\nAt some point, &lt;a href=\"James%20Blackridge\"&gt;James Blackridge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Liam\"&gt;Liam&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Bram%20Woodring\"&gt;Bram Woodring&lt;/a&gt; went fishing in Westfall. As they had no luck with the fishes, they moved to &lt;a href=\"Westfall%20Lighthouse\"&gt;Westfall Lighthouse&lt;/a&gt;, where they discovered the &lt;a href=\"Bloodsail%20Buccaneers\"&gt;Bloodsail Buccaneers&lt;/a&gt; crew led by &lt;a href=\"Jerias%20Bloodvein\"&gt;Jerias Bloodvein&lt;/a&gt;. The Bloodsails abducted them and trained them to be &lt;a href=\"pirate\"&gt;pirate&lt;/a&gt;s. When the pirate crew returned to Westfall after a few months, they marched to Moonbrooke and invaded the Deadmines in hopes to enact vengeance on &lt;a href=\"Edwin%20VanCleef\"&gt;Edwin VanCleef&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;. In order to rescue his parents among the prisoners, James faced and killed in a duel the pirate captain that had captured them. The rescued prisoners were then escorted to &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20Hill\"&gt;Sentinel Hill&lt;/a&gt;, and the young man was certain that with Bloodvein dead, the Bloodsails would not return to Westfall.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nDue to this lack of military protection, Westfall was all but destroyed by the rebel &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;. The Brotherhood, composed mainly of thieves and bandits, easily took control of the poorly defended farmlands, driving off many of the good farm folk, and made Westfall their new refuge. Needing a secure location to oversee the construction of a massive &lt;a href=\"Juggernaught\"&gt;Juggernaught&lt;/a&gt;, their weapon to destroy &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; from the sea, &lt;a href=\"Edwin%20VanCleef\"&gt;Edwin VanCleef&lt;/a&gt; chose the &lt;a href=\"Deadmines\"&gt;Deadmines&lt;/a&gt; as his base of operations, an abandoned mining network hidden beneath a barn in &lt;a href=\"Moonbrook\"&gt;Moonbrook&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith Westfall under his control, Edwin VanCleef took advantage of the resources at his disposal and used his considerable manpower to run many of the farmers off, and took over the handful of gold mines. He made a deal with the &lt;a href=\"Riverpaw%20pack\"&gt;Riverpaw pack&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt;s, hiring them as thugs and stationing them throughout Westfall. In order to further hurt the people of Westfall, they also began burning the farmers' fields and salting the earth to prevent them from growing crops. With the addition of &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s to the Brotherhood's ranks, their armaments grew to include &lt;a href=\"harvest%20golem\"&gt;harvest golem&lt;/a&gt;s, which they programmed to hunt down and terminate the human inhabitants of Westfall. These mechanical monstrosities did their job well, as they elicited terror in anyone foolish enough to roam the fallow fields of Westfall alone.\nOnly the &lt;a href=\"People%27s%20Militia\"&gt;People's Militia&lt;/a&gt; rose up to stand in their way. Considering that Stormwind had abandoned their cause, &lt;a href=\"Gryan%20Stoutmantle\"&gt;Gryan Stoutmantle&lt;/a&gt; founded this volunteer military organization in order to keep the land free from corruption. In his efforts to defend the people of Westfall, he recruited the young heroes of the Alliance and sent them to eliminate large numbers of Defias spotted by his scouts across the region. In order to help, &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; also directed reconnaissance operations on the Brotherhood activities, and later sent &lt;a href=\"Agent%20Kearnen\"&gt;Agent Kearnen&lt;/a&gt; in Westfall to spy on &lt;a href=\"Klaven%27s%20Tower\"&gt;Klaven's Tower&lt;/a&gt;. Once they found that the leaders of the Defias Brotherhood were hiding in the Deadmines beneath &lt;a href=\"Moonbrook\"&gt;Moonbrook&lt;/a&gt;, Stoutmantle called upon the heroes of the Alliance to destroy the Brotherhood and Edwin at their head. With support from Stoutmantle's soldiers, the heroes succeeded and Westfall was safe once again.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"War%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;Scourgewar&lt;/a&gt;, the People's Militia renamed themselves the &lt;a href=\"Westfall%20Brigade\"&gt;Westfall Brigade&lt;/a&gt; and joined the &lt;a href=\"Valiance%20Expedition\"&gt;Valiance Expedition&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. Following the fall of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; and their tour of duty, the Brigade returned home to Westfall, where they found that the cost of the war had left thousands homeless, who then migrated to Westfall to squat on many of the abandoned properties.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Li%20Li%20Stormstout\"&gt;Li Li Stormstout&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Strongbo\"&gt;Strongbo&lt;/a&gt; came to Westfall on their journey to find &lt;a href=\"Chen%20Stormstout\"&gt;Chen Stormstout&lt;/a&gt;.\nDark Riders.\nPrior to the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the People's Militia forces who remained in Westfall were mobilized to bring order and defeat the last remaining Defias. According to one of their officer, morale was rather low among the troops, consisting mostly of militiamen and not soldiers, which sometimes led to conflicts for food.\nThe &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Karlain\"&gt;Karlain&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Revil%20Kost\"&gt;Revil Kost&lt;/a&gt; teamed up in a camp of the People's Militia, and together they traveled to &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Coast%20Quarry\"&gt;Gold Coast Quarry&lt;/a&gt; to find &lt;a href=\"Tannos\"&gt;Tannos&lt;/a&gt;. A group of the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; was patrolling the area, and soon they ambushed Tannos and the others. The presence of Tannos' &lt;a href=\"Hand%20of%20Azora\"&gt;artifact&lt;/a&gt; drew the attention of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Riders\"&gt;Dark Riders&lt;/a&gt; into Westwall as well, so when the Defias were defeated, the Dark Riders suddenly appeared, killed Tannos, and took the Hand of Azora. Revil then proceeded to track them to &lt;a href=\"Duskwood\"&gt;Duskwood&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"War%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;campaign in Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, Westfall reported tidal waves and storms. Many people living in Westfall became homeless and bankrupt, and those who weren't in a military occupation faced especially hard times. Westfall is now inhabited by transients, homeless Stormwind citizens, and drifters. The farmlands are still reeling from years of neglect and desolation. The Westfall Brigade, having returned from the war in Northrend, fortified &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20Hill\"&gt;Sentinel Hill&lt;/a&gt; and started working on cleaning up the mess left behind by the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;, expanding the reach of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and maintaining order with the full support of &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; created a large sinkhole named the &lt;a href=\"Raging%20Chasm\"&gt;Raging Chasm&lt;/a&gt;, located in the western part of Westfall, between the &lt;a href=\"Molsen%20Farm\"&gt;Molsen Farm&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Alexston%20Farmstead\"&gt;Alexston Farmstead&lt;/a&gt; who were partially devoured by the disaster. Consequently, many &lt;a href=\"Provincial%20Settler\"&gt;farmers&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Thurman%20Grant\"&gt;Thurman Grant&lt;/a&gt; left Westfall in order to try and resettle the newly cleansed lands in the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Western Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;. The kingdom later sent supplies, troops, and siege engines in hopes of rebuilding the former breadbasket of the kingdom, and to house the citizens of Stormwind whose homes were destroyed by the Cataclysm. While they sought to secure the region and restore it to its former glory; the resurgence of an old and familiar enemy hinder their efforts.\nIn the shadow, the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; made a resurgence, primarily due to growing resentment of Stormwind's leadership among the people of Westfall, the cause of which was poverty among the people and a perceived indifference to this poverty by the king. &lt;a href=\"Edwin%20VanCleef\"&gt;Edwin VanCleef&lt;/a&gt;'s daughter, &lt;a href=\"Vanessa%20VanCleef\"&gt;Vanessa&lt;/a&gt;, took the leadership of the Defias and had been encouraging the anti-Stormwind sentiment among the people of Westfall, recruiting new allies to aid her in their vengeance against the kingdom. The Brotherhood then mounted a surprise attack on &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20Hill\"&gt;Sentinel Hill&lt;/a&gt; and burned it virtually to the ground. Following a large conflict between the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Army\"&gt;Stormwind Army&lt;/a&gt; and the Brotherhood, a force of Alliance &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;heroes&lt;/a&gt; entered once again the Deadmines, where they wiped out all the new Defias leadership. Eventually, they confronted Vanessa herself atop the rebuilt &lt;a href=\"Juggernaught\"&gt;Juggernaught&lt;/a&gt;, and faced with defeat, she detonated a series of explosions which essentially blow up her and the ship, ending her plans and the activities of the Brotherhood in Westfall.\nLegion and aftermath.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt; targeted Westfall as one of their &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Invasions\"&gt;invasion points&lt;/a&gt;, ravaging the region with their armies of &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s, while some &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt; enslaved its inhabitants. Under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Gryan%20Stoutmantle\"&gt;Gryan Stoutmantle&lt;/a&gt;, Westfall was successfully defended by the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Army\"&gt;Stormwind Army&lt;/a&gt; with the help of the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s of the Alliance and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt;, the latter having temporarily installed one of their camps before leaving once the assaults and demons repelled. Among the defenders, some &lt;a href=\"Uprooted%20Farmhand\"&gt;farmhands&lt;/a&gt; acted like &lt;a href=\"militia\"&gt;militia&lt;/a&gt;s, they took up weapons to defend themselves and repel demons, thus indicating that farmers are still present to work in Westfall. At this time, all members of the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; had left the region, and the &lt;a href=\"Deadmines\"&gt;Deadmines&lt;/a&gt; fell silent.\nDuring his exploration of the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;, the Spymaster &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; reported that the transients who arrived here after the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; continued to come and go, this time unsettled by a &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;massive war&lt;/a&gt;, not a world's breaking. However, Shaw noted that they provide a rich source of rumors for to investigate. While &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20Hill\"&gt;Sentinel Hill&lt;/a&gt; was being rebuilt and fortified, the &lt;a href=\"Westfall%20Brigade\"&gt;Westfall Brigade&lt;/a&gt; worked with the SI:7 to maintain order in the region, stop troublemakers, and keep at bay the packs of disordered &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt;s since &lt;a href=\"Hogger\"&gt;Hogger&lt;/a&gt;'s death. The &lt;a href=\"Raging%20Chasm\"&gt;Raging Chasm&lt;/a&gt; was also reported to be still present and active in the region.\nDragonflight.\nIn the years that followed the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s defeat, &lt;a href=\"Vanessa%20VanCleef\"&gt;Vanessa VanCleef&lt;/a&gt; had an agreement with &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt;, while she kept the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; on a short leash, the wouldn't come after them for their crimes. Though she tried to reign in their banditry to focus on aiding the people of Westfall, &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;'s reforms allowed more aid and resources to arrive at Westfall, which caused the spark of revolution to fade. The young king also offered pardons and reparations for former &lt;a href=\"Stonemasons%20Guild\"&gt;Stonemasons&lt;/a&gt; and their families, who therefore left their life of banditry and returned to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; as citizens, leaving the Brotherhood with only the thieves and bullies with no qualms about targeting innocents.\nSome time after the discovery of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;, a disgraced noble named &lt;a href=\"Count%20Clessington\"&gt;Count Clessington&lt;/a&gt; convinced the remaining Defias in Westfall to turn against Vanessa. He ordered them to steal the &lt;a href=\"%3ADrakefire%20Amulet\"&gt;:Drakefire Amulet&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt;, and sent a few of his &lt;a href=\"Clessington%20Attendant\"&gt;attendants&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Moonbrook\"&gt;Moonbrook&lt;/a&gt;, in order to get rid of those who would get in his way. In the &lt;a href=\"Deadmines\"&gt;Deadmines&lt;/a&gt;, Count Clessington and &lt;a href=\"Duncon%20Ratsbon\"&gt;Duncon Ratsbon&lt;/a&gt; used the artifact's powers to convince the Defias to turn against Vanessa and march on &lt;a href=\"Northshire%20Abbey\"&gt;Northshire Abbey&lt;/a&gt;, with the aim of using it as a staging ground to pillage &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; itself. Seeing how easily a corrupted noble turned the Brotherhood against her, Vanessa realized that she was no longer one of them. She left the ranks of the Brotherhood, and told her remaining &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Rebel\"&gt;loyal Defias&lt;/a&gt; to return home to their families, as this fight was no longer theirs, and that they should help the people of Westfall in other ways.\nLater, the &lt;a href=\"Breadbasket%20Guild\"&gt;Breadbasket Guild&lt;/a&gt; was created by a gathering of Westfall &lt;a href=\"farmer\"&gt;farmer&lt;/a&gt;s, former Defias members, and war &lt;a href=\"refugee\"&gt;refugee&lt;/a&gt;s, who sought to help Westfall and its inhabitants. They are good people trying to do right by each other, notably by working the farms again and to get proper homes built for folks. With the help and support of &lt;a href=\"Cecilia%20Clessington\"&gt;Countess Cecilia Clessington&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Nobles\"&gt;House of Nobles&lt;/a&gt;, their organization was formalized to request support from the kingdom.\nGeography.\nOnce a proud land of farmers and herders, Westfall became a wasteland largely because of the thieves who usurped it. Weeds and seedling trees mark the rich land, and the wind cries over the fields. The &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; were the greatest threat to farmers and travelers, but after their defeat, it is now mainly the &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt;s and the slouching &lt;a href=\"harvest%20golem\"&gt;harvest golem&lt;/a&gt;s that threaten the region.\nThere is one instanced dungeon - the &lt;a href=\"Deadmines\"&gt;Deadmines&lt;/a&gt;, that can be found in Westfall. No other dungeons or battlegrounds can be found here.\nMaps and subregions.\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//wow.gamepressure.com/map.asp%3FID%3D16\"&gt;Topographic map of Westfall&lt;/a&gt;\nNotable characters.\nWestfall is home to several humans of note. &lt;a href=\"Tiffin%20Ellerian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Queen Tiffin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; belonged to the &lt;a href=\"Ellerian\"&gt;Ellerian&lt;/a&gt; noble family of Stormwind, a small house that only had a small chunk of land in Westfall.\nAt &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20Hill\"&gt;Sentinel Hill&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Gryan%20Stoutmantle\"&gt;Gryan Stoutmantle&lt;/a&gt; leads the &lt;a href=\"Westfall%20Brigade\"&gt;Westfall Brigade&lt;/a&gt; and sends promising &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s of the Alliance to rid the land of any threat. He is assisted in his efforts by &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Danuvin\"&gt;Captain Danuvin&lt;/a&gt;, who also seeks to rid Westfall of the vile &lt;a href=\"Riverpaw%20pack\"&gt;Riverpaw gnolls&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe &lt;a href=\"Deadmines\"&gt;Deadmines&lt;/a&gt; were once the headquarters of the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Edwin%20VanCleef\"&gt;Edwin VanCleef&lt;/a&gt;, the former guildmaster of the &lt;a href=\"Stonemasons%20Guild\"&gt;Stonemasons Guild&lt;/a&gt;. He was killed at the hands of &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s sent by Gryan Stoutmantle, and years later, was replaced by his daughter &lt;a href=\"Vanessa%20VanCleef\"&gt;Vanessa VanCleef&lt;/a&gt;. She was also defeated by the heroes, but managed to escape by faking her death with hallucinogens and explosives.\nAt the &lt;a href=\"Westfall%20Lighthouse\"&gt;Westfall Lighthouse&lt;/a&gt;, the ghostly &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Grayson\"&gt;Captain Grayson&lt;/a&gt; recruits adventurers to make Longshore a safer place to venture.\nResources.\nDropped items in this area and their purpose:\nOther resources:\nIn the RPG.\nThe peaceful inhabitants of Westfall find it a frightening place to live after recent events. While the Defias Brotherhood hatches its schemes to hurt Stormwind, the Alliance and all beholden to it, Westfall's simple folk just try to live from day to day with thieves, bandits, and gnolls threatening them. The thieves and bandits find it a large area in which they can plan their attacks without much bother. Little fun and celebration occur among Westfall's inhabitants, as they have poor community support and hardly any aid from Stormwind. The garrison at Sentinel Hill is nothing more than a Stormwind figurehead.\nThe thieves of the Brotherhood, on the other hand, apparently live a fine life.

The region was stolen right under the Alliance\u2019s nose by its own bitter people. This rich land has lain fallow since the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, but it is now held by the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;. Stormwind claims the land as its own, but it has found little time to be concerned with it, with insufficient funds and might to retake the region. A handful of farmers still try to keep their land, and some even attempt a tithe to Stormwind every year, but most only grow enough to feed themselves. The Defias Brotherhood controls much of the region, focused in the southern area of &lt;a href=\"Moonbrook\"&gt;Moonbrook&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce a rich agricultural center, much of Westfall now lies fallow and forgotten. The Defias Brotherhood, renegade humans who wield secrecy and technology against Stormwind, control much of the area. Bandits and gnolls raid those farms that remain, and Stormwind\u2019s resources are stretched too thin to protect the beleaguered populace. Westfall has the mild temperatures of Elwynn, but winds batter it both from the sea and from Duskwood. The bare farmlands add little to break the wind, which can cut through clothing on a blustery day.\nWestfall is a region of rolling pastures and farms that were once beautiful and green, but now have become barren with drought and maltreatment at the hands of bandits. The grass is yellowed and the fields are infested with ravenous &lt;a href=\"carrion%20bird\"&gt;carrion bird&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"mechanical\"&gt;mechanical&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"harvest%20watcher\"&gt;harvest watcher&lt;/a&gt;s gone rogue. The outlawed Defias Brotherhood has gained a strong foothold in Westfall and controls several camps and farmsteads in the area. It is rumored that these bandits possess a large &lt;a href=\"Deadmines\"&gt;mine&lt;/a&gt; with an entrance somewhere in the small town of Moonbrook, and that they have connections with the &lt;a href=\"kobold\"&gt;kobold&lt;/a&gt;s that occupy the &lt;a href=\"Jangolode%20Mine\"&gt;Jangolode Mine&lt;/a&gt; in Westfall and the various mines in &lt;a href=\"Elwynn%20Forest%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Elwynn Forest&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"People%27s%20Militia\"&gt;People's Militia&lt;/a&gt; has erected a last bastion of military power in the region at &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20Hill\"&gt;Sentinel Hill&lt;/a&gt;, from where they issue commands to anyone willing to aid the cause. Although most of the area's farms have fallen to disrepair and passed into control of the Defias, there are still a number of farmers who bravely (and desperately) cling to their holdings in spite of overwhelming odds.\nAlso, note that on &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt; servers and even some &lt;a href=\"PvE\"&gt;PvE&lt;/a&gt; servers high-level &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; players enjoy killing human NPCs at Sentinel Hill.\nHistory.\nAll other Azeroth territories taken out of Alliance control had the Horde, the undead, or the demons behind them. Westfall fell to bitter humans soon after the Second War. The Defias Brotherhood, led by Edwin VanCleef, attempted to take &lt;a href=\"Elwynn%20Forest%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Elwynn Forest&lt;/a&gt; but failed. Its members chose Westfall as their new home, and the farmers, still shaken from the Horde attacks, put up little resistance. The Brotherhood found that the time to steal land from their own accepted ruler was when he was too concerned with orcs, undead and demons to realize that a good chunk of the continent was gone. The rulers at Stormwind, even with knowledge of the Brotherhood\u2019s actions, considered other threats to be higher priorities and figured they\u2019d get to Westfall eventually. They do not know the true threat Westfall presents \u2014 or even how much the city would miss the agricultural tributes the farmers made.\nOnce the breadbasket of the kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, the land of Westfall started to grow fallow after years of conflict and neglect had diminished its harvests. Crops could eventually no longer be cultivated in the fields, and the once-abundant &lt;a href=\"mine\"&gt;mine&lt;/a&gt;s were ultimately deserted. Even the former defenders from Stormwind pulled stake and abandoned the lonely realm when the cost of upkeep became too great.\nDue to this lack of military protection, Westfall was all but destroyed by the rebel &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; and its minions; who could easily take control of the poorly defended farmlands and burn their fields and salt the earth. The Brotherhood, composed mainly of thieves and bandits, drove off many of the good farm folk and made Westfall their new refuge. Employing everything from local superstitions to sabotaging mechanical &lt;a href=\"harvest%20watcher\"&gt;harvest watcher&lt;/a&gt;s, the Brotherhood stopped at nothing to scare away trespassers and protect their stolen treasures. Only the People's Militia, a volunteer military organization, has risen to stand in their way, recruiting young heroes of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; to strike back and regain what has been stolen. This battle is ongoing, and in the end the only hope the people of Westfall have is to strike directly against the leaders of the Defias \u2014 in hiding somewhere deep below ground.\nPeople and culture.\nThe peaceful inhabitants of Westfall find it a frightening place to live after recent events. While the Defias Brotherhood hatches its schemes to hurt Stormwind, the Alliance and all beholden to it, Westfall\u2019s simple folk just try to live from day to day with thieves, bandits and gnolls threatening them. The thieves and bandits find it a large area in which they can plan their attacks without much bother. Little fun and celebration occurs among Westfall\u2019s inhabitants, as they have poor community support and hardly any aid from Stormwind. The garrison at Sentinel Hill is nothing more than a Stormwind figurehead.\nThe thieves of the Brotherhood, on the other hand, apparently live a fine life. Only a few Brotherhood members live in Moonbrook, presumably acting as sentries. The bulk of the population occupies the Dead Mines, which the Brotherhood has converted into an underground fortress.\nGeography.\nOnce a proud land of farmers and herders, Westfall now lies fallow for the most part because of the thieves who have usurped it. Weeds and seedling trees mark the rich land, and the wind cries over the fields. Thieves and bandits are the greatest problems here, but gnolls and the slouching harvest golems also terrorize the already harried farmers. Most of Westfall is choked by the Defias Brotherhood. Residents who are not part of the Brotherhood live in fear and constant vigilance and pray for Alliance aid that rarely comes.\nThere is one instanced dungeon - the &lt;a href=\"Deadmines%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Deadmines&lt;/a&gt;, that can be found in Westfall. No other dungeons or battlegrounds can be found here.\nThe fastest way for an &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; character to get to &lt;a href=\"Yojamba%20Isle\"&gt;Yojamba Isle&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Stranglethorn&lt;/a&gt; is by flying to &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20Hill\"&gt;Sentinel Hill&lt;/a&gt;, riding across Westfall, or swimming south around the bend.\nNotable characters.\nWestfall is home to several humans of note, both living and dead. At Sentinel Hill, &lt;a href=\"Gryan%20Stoutmantle\"&gt;Gryan Stoutmantle&lt;/a&gt; leads the People's Militia and sends promising young humans to rid the land of the clusters of Defias bandits who have taken a chokehold on the land. He is assisted in his efforts by &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Danuvin\"&gt;Captain Danuvin&lt;/a&gt;, who also seeks to rid Westfall of the vile Riverpaw gnolls. And at the Westfall Lighthouse, the ghostly &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Grayson\"&gt;Captain Grayson&lt;/a&gt; recruits adventurers of all factions to make Longshore a safer place to venture; one of the rewards for the quest &lt;a href=\"The%20Coastal%20Menace\"&gt;The Coastal Menace&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href=\"Grayson%27s%20Torch\"&gt;Grayson's Torch&lt;/a&gt; which is popular amongst RP characters because of it looking and acting like a flame-lit torch.\nQuests.\n&lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20Hill\"&gt;Sentinel Hill&lt;/a&gt; is the main settlement in this region. It has many subquests that culminate in the large instanced dungeon called \"The &lt;a href=\"Deadmines\"&gt;Deadmines&lt;/a&gt;\" where you must find and kill &lt;a href=\"Edwin%20VanCleef\"&gt;Edwin VanCleef&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;. The entrance to the Deadmines is located in Moonbrook, a broken town controlled by the Defias Brotherhood in the south-west region of Westfall, near &lt;a href=\"The%20Dagger%20Hills\"&gt;The Dagger Hills&lt;/a&gt;.\nResources.\nDropped items in this area and their purpose:\nOther Resources:\nNotes &amp; tips.\nIn Northwestern Westfall, running along the cliff, there is a lone windmill with a tiny shack at its base. It is surrounded by 6-7 Defias mobs, levels 12-13, which respawn immediately upon death. Due to the difficulty (relative to player level) of fighting them, you should probably be level 24 or higher before taking them on. Grinding on these Defias at a high level can be useful for:"}

The initiative was based in &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20Hill\"&gt;Sentinel Hill&lt;/a&gt; but protectors could also be found wandering various nearby roads. Members of the militia also enlisted young adventurers to thin out the local &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt; population and deal with other various threats. Their leader, &lt;a href=\"Gryan%20Stoutmantle\"&gt;Gryan Stoutmantle&lt;/a&gt;, directed them from the lower section of &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20Tower\"&gt;Sentinel Tower&lt;/a&gt; in Sentinel Hill.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nUnder the command of Gryan Stoutmantle, promoted to the rank of &lt;a href=\"Captain%20%28rank%29\"&gt;Captain&lt;/a&gt;, they were a part of the &lt;a href=\"Valiance%20Expedition\"&gt;Valiance Expedition&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;.

The operation was to rescue none other than Princess Talanji and her escort, Zul the Prophet. These two figureheads of the Zandalari Empire had been captured by the Alliance while in transit to Orgrimmar for negotiations.\nWhile in the Stockades, you encountered the captured High Warlord Saurfang. Although freedom was offered to him, he chose to stay behind rather than return to a Horde run by Sylvanas.\nSpeaker of the Horde.\nAfter a narrow escape from Stormwind, Princess Talanji redirected your rescue team to her home city of Zuldazar where negotiations could continue in her favor instead of Orgrimmar. There you met the Zanchuli Council and King Rastakhan, and were apprised of why the Zandalari might have any use for the Horde.\nRather than throw you from the pyramid of Dazar'alor, King Rastakhan instead showed you his thanks for rescuing his daughter by naming you Speaker of the Horde.\nThe Kul Tiras Campaign.\nWhile you and the Horde struggle to gain the naval might of the Zandalari Empire, the Alliance has sought to gain the favor of their old allies of Kul Tiras.\nThis threat cannot go unmet, and so Lady Sylvanas Windrunner has dispatched you and some of the Horde's finest champions and leaders to secure footholds on this enemy isle.\nThe Drustvar Foothold.\nYou have been dispatched to Drustvar with Trade Prince Gallywix and Eitrigg to investigate the large seams of Azerite that can be mined or pillaged from the dark forest.\nAfter navigating the forest infested with witches and other horrifying apparitions, Trade Prince Gallywix and Eitrigg decided the less-infested mountains would be the best place to install a base of operations. And so you founded Krazzlefrazz Outpost.\nThe Stormsong Foothold.\nRexxar sent word that Warfang Hold in Stormsong is under siege. You were assigned to High Warlord Cromush to break the siege and reinforce the outpost.\nYou joined forces with Rexxar on the battlefield and helped re-take and secure the foothold of Warsong Hold.\nAfter a bribe, a disguise, and a mutiny, you secured support for the Horde in Plunder Harbor."}

Unstable ruins and shattered memories are your only clues to a life that feels like a vague recollection.\nYou discovered and awoke Scalecommander Azurathel and several other dracthyr. No one can recall what happened, or why blue dragon magic was used to conjure a stasis.\nHow much time has passed? Where is the Earth-Warder, Neltharion, the black dragon who sired the dracthyr?\nFalling back on training, you and the other dracthyr arm yourselves and press towards the exit of the War Creche. Along the way you are joined by Scalecommande Cindrethresh.\nHowever, the way is barred by a blue dragon and his drakonid minions. Their only purpose for being here seems to prevent the dracthyr from escaping into the world.\nAfter a pitched battle, you and the dracthyr fight your way past the blue dragon and their minions and escape the War Creche. But the dragon has collapsed the entryway behind you.\nOld Weyrn Grounds.\nEscaping the War Creche, you and your fellow dracthyr found yourselves in the overgrown and ruined Old Weyrn Grounds, the ancient training and parade grounds of the dracthyr.\nWhen investigating a large arcane beacon, you were granted a vision of several similar beacons placed in front of the other creches of the dracthyr. Each is struck by calamity and conflict.\nYou also briefly saw a vision of two black dragons high in the sky.\nScalecommander Emberthal blazed on to the scene, exterminating an attacking band of tarasek. She shared the sad news with you and the other scalecommanders that she was the only survivor of her weyrn.\nShe also imparted wisdom of how evokers like yourself are the elite soldiers of the dracthyr, trained by all five weyrns to be masters of magic and draconic heritage. As such, she had some thoughts on how best to levy your skills to rescue the other creches of dracthyr.\nThe Healing Wings.\nYou and Scalecommander Cindrethresh were dispatched to the Caldera of the Menders to see what fate has befallen the Healing Wings.\nThe Healing Wings are dracthyr specialized in healing and support, though Cindrethresh's primary concern seemed to be for their leader, Scalecommander Viridia.\nUpon arrival, you discovered that the Support Creche had been breached and was flooded with toxic gasses from swarms of aggressive beetles. Dracthyr with scarred lungs emerged coughing and barely alive, escaping stasis only to find themselves exposed to a cloud of death.\nAt Scalecommander Viridia's request, you provided aid to the severely injured Healing Wings.\nShe even asked you to provide healing for the blue drakonid who had been holding the dracthyr prisoner. In doing so, it forced the drakonid to confront their previous expectations of the dracthyr, and even change allegiances.\nArmed against the toxins, you ventured into the Support Creche to recover survivors, find evidence of what had transpired, and retrieve the horn signet rings of the fallen so that they might be remembered.\nThe Ebon Scales.\nYou and several others were dispatched to Stormsunder Crater to aid the Ebon Scales. This weyrn of dracthyr specialize in siege magics, yet now find themselves under siege.\nProto-dragons infused with elemental magic, along with a zealous tauren shaman, seem to be conducting an empowerment ritual. They are preventing the Ebon Scales from escaping their creche.\nThese enemies, calling themselves Primalists, seek to awaken or free some powerful entity trapped in the Forbidden Reach.\nAfter driving the main Primalist forces from Stormsunder Crater, you were able to rendezvous with the Ebon Scales.\nLed by Scalecommander Sarkareth, these dracthyr were enraged by the state of affairs. Despite a reluctance to take any order not directly issued by Neltharion, Sarkareth agreed to assist the rest of the dracthyr against the Primalists.\nFroststone Vault.\nAs the dracthyr prepared to face the Primalists en masse, they were joined by two black dragons who had been observing them from above.\nEbyssian and Wrathion call for a joint effort against the Primalists to prevent them from releasing a powerful entity from an ancient prison within the Froststone Vault.\nYou and the combined forces of all five weyrns of the dracthyr and two black dragons attempted to hold your ground against the Primalists at Froststone Vault.\nIn the end, their numbers proved too great.\nKurog Grimtotem, Grand Summoner of the Primalists, was able to gain access to the Vault and release the being within:\nRaszageth, the Storm-Eater.\nWrath of the Storm-Eater.\nFreed from her long captivity, Raszageth the Storm-Eater unleashes a violent tempest that threatens the entire Reach.\nYou and your allies have no choice but to retreat before her wrath.\nThe release of Raszageth is felt through the world, drawing forth Nozdormu, the Aspect of Time.\nWith his magic, the dracthyr are provided the cover they need to escape the Forbidden Reach. Each weyrn scattering in different directions, to different continents, with different intentions.\nThe Obsidian Warders.\nYour weyrn, the Obsidian Warders, led by Scalecommander Azurathel, followed Wrathion to the Eastern Kingdoms. It is your duty to warn the members of the Alliance about the coming storm.\nUpon meeting with some of the leaders of the Alliance, you learn that an expedition is being mounted to the Dragon Isles.\nThe dracthyr have volunteered to assist the Alliance in their expedition, partially to learn more about these potential allies, but also to gain answers about their own history and origins.\nThe Dark Talons.\nYour weyrn, the Dark Talons, led by Scalecommander Cindrethresh, followed Ebyssian to Kalimdor. It is your duty to warn the members of the Horde of the coming storm.\nUpon meeting with some of the leaders of the Horde, you learn that an expedition is being mounted to the Dragon Isles.\nThe dracthyr have volunteered to assist the Horde in their expedition, partially to learn more of this potential ally, but also to gain answers about their own history and origins.\nThe Dragonscale Expedition.\nYou were summoned to Stormwind by the black dragon Wrathion. There, Wrathion presented Alexstrasza's invitation to the Alliance to join the dragonflights on the Dragon Isles.\nLord Commander Turalyon appointed Toddy Whiskers to co-lead the Dragonscale Expedition, a joint Horde-Alliance effort to explore the Dragon Isles. Together, you helped rally the many skilled scholars, artisans, and explorers needed to ensure the success of the expedition in the Dragon Isles.\nWhile preparing to set sail for the Dragon Isles, Archmage Khadgar arrived with troubling news of Raszageth, a powerful storm proto-dragon who leads the Primalists against the dragonflights.\nYou sailed with Toddy and the Dragonscale Expedition to the Dragon Isles on the Rugged Dragonscale, a Kul Tiran ship commissioned for this adventure.\nUpon arriving in the Waking Shore, you discovered proto-dragons had swarmed the expedition's landing site. While rescuing expedition members, you fought off the proto-dragons and helped secure the Dragonscale Expedition's camp in the nearby Wingrest Embassy.\nUpon arriving at the Wingrest Embassy, you were greeted by an eager drakonid cadet named Senxrax. Wrathion and the other dragons were nowhere to be found.\nYou were summoned to Orgrimmar by the black dragon Ebyssian, in his visage form as Spiritwalker Ebonhorn. There, Ebyssian presented Alexstrasza's invitation to the Horde Council to join the dragonflights on the Dragon Isles.\nThe Horde Council appointed Naleidea Rivergleam to co-lead the Dargonscale Expedition, a joint Horde-Alliance effort to explore the Dragon Isles. Together, you helped rally the many skilled scholars, artisans, and explorers needed to ensure the success of the expedition in the Dragon Isles.\nWhile preparing to set flight for the Dragon Isles, Archmage Khadgar arrived with troubling news of Raszageth, a powerful storm proto-dragon who leads the Primalists against the dragonflights.\nThe Waking Shores.\nDragons in Distress.\nMajordomo Selistra and Wrathion arrived to inform you that the djaradin, ancient rivals of the dragons, have reawakened and attacked a nearby dragon outpost.\nYou helped Commander Lethanak and Sendrax save the injured civilians and whelplings from the djaradin attack.\nOnce the whelplings were safe, you fought your way into the djaradin volcanic fortress. With the help of Wrathion's spies and Majordomo Selistra, you ensured the djaradin would pose no more threat to their neighbors. At least for now.\nYou sought out Sendrax at the Life-Binder Conservatory, healing injured dragonkin along the way.\nInside the ruins of the conservatory, you and Sendrax quickly found yourselves surrounded by Primalists. Their leader, a massive fire proto-dragon, commanded them to infuse stolen red dragon eggs with elemental power. Despite your and Sendrax's best efforts, the whelplings that hatched from the eggs were beyond redemption, made feral by the Primalist influence.\nSendrax heroically sacrificed her life in order to save the last unhatched egg from the Primalists.\nIn Defense of Life.\nMajordomo Selistra hurriedly flew you and the rescued egg to Queen Alexstrasza at the Ruby Lifeshrine.\nAt the Lifeshrine, you learned much about the goals and culture of the red dragonflight, who cultivate life and tend to the eggs of all of the dragonflights.\nYou were also introduced to dragonriders, drakes and mortals who have teamed up to explore the wonders of the Dragon Isles together. While training with them, you found your first dragonriding companion, a renewed proto-drake, and took to the skies in style.\nYour peaceful exploration was cut short when Raszageth, leader of the Primalists, led a direct assault on the Lifeshrine. Queen Alexstrasza took to the skies to fend off Raszageth while Majordomo Selistra and the rest of the dragonflight rallied to defend their home on the ground.\nYou and the Majordomo were able to push back the Primalists and rescue all of the stolen dragon eggs from the Primalist enclave. However, Queen Alexstrasza was wounded while forcing Raszageth away from the Lifeshrine.\nWrathion, having helped Alexstrasza drive off Raszageth, argued that Alexstrasza and her brood must now help him retake the Obsidian Citadel, the ancestral home of the black dragonflight. Alexstrasza urged patience as she focused her efforts on tending to the recovered dragon eggs.\nWrathion's Gambit.\nImpatient and unwilling to wait, Wrathion began his assault of the Obsidian Citadel, despite being badly outnumbered by the djaradin forces he sought to drive off.\nDuring Wrathion's desperate charge, a black dragon named Sabellian arrived just in time to help, having returned from Outland with his powerful brood of black dragons.\nWith the combined strength of Wrathion's mortal army and Sabellian's dragon army, the pair of black dragons were able to force their way into the Obsidian Citadel to reforge the Obsidian Oathstone and successfully empower it.\nA Purpose Restored.\nAfter empowering the Obsidian Oathstone, Wrathion and Sabellian argued over who should be the one to sit on the throne as Aspect and lead the newly restored black dragonflight.\nUnable to resolve the argument, you agreed to help them escort the clutch of black dragon eggs brought by Sabellian to the Ruby Life Pools.\nThrough a clever ruse, Sabellian ensured the safety of the eggs during transit, and frustrated Wrathion's attempts to curry favor with Queen Alexstrasza.\nOhn'ahran Plains.\nInto the Plains.\nYou arrived in the &lt;a href=\"Ohn%27ahran%20Plains\"&gt;Ohn'ahran Plains&lt;/a&gt; to reach the &lt;a href=\"green%20dragonflight\"&gt;green dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; and help them empower the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Oathstone\"&gt;Emerald Oathstone&lt;/a&gt;. To do so, you had to establish diplomacy with the &lt;a href=\"Maruuk%20Centaur\"&gt;Maruuk&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt; so that you could cross their lands.\nYou met &lt;a href=\"Scout%20Tomul\"&gt;Scout Tomul&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Shikaar\"&gt;Clan Shikaar&lt;/a&gt; and aided her hunting party in taking down &lt;a href=\"Blazing%20Proto-Dragon\"&gt;a proto-dragon&lt;/a&gt;. She introduced you to &lt;a href=\"Sansok%20Khan\"&gt;Sansok Khan&lt;/a&gt;, the deaf leader of Clan Shikaar. She shared that the green dragons were sending an emissary to the centaur's upcoming gathering and agreed to bring you along if you pulled your weight.\nYou traveled alongside the caravan, sharing stories and hunting alongside them during the journey. You helped their mystic, &lt;a href=\"Ohn%20Seshteng\"&gt;Ohn Seshteng&lt;/a&gt;, receive a bleak omen from their god, &lt;a href=\"Ohn%27ahra\"&gt;Ohn'ahra&lt;/a&gt;, before arriving in &lt;a href=\"Maruukai\"&gt;Maruukai&lt;/a&gt;.\nMaruukai.\nYou arrived in Maruukai for the centaur gathering, the &lt;a href=\"Khural\"&gt;Khural&lt;/a&gt;. You met the other powerful clans of the plains.\nYou met &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Teerai\"&gt;Clan Teerai&lt;/a&gt;, the tradition keepers, and helped cook an offering for the ancestors.\nYou met &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Ohn%27ir\"&gt;Clan Ohn'ir&lt;/a&gt; mystics and helped clarify an earlier omen, revealing that Ohn'ahra is in danger.\nYou met &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Nokhud\"&gt;Clan Nokhud&lt;/a&gt;, the warriors, and sparred with them.\nYou met the emerald emissary, &lt;a href=\"Gemisath\"&gt;Gemisath&lt;/a&gt;, and learned that the green dragons needed the centaurs' aid to push back a Primalist threat. As the centaur leader, &lt;a href=\"Khanam%20Matra%20Sarest\"&gt;the Khanam Matra&lt;/a&gt;, agreed to help Gemisath, the Nokhud &lt;a href=\"Khan\"&gt;Khan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Balakar%20Khan\"&gt;Balakar&lt;/a&gt; arrived and killed Gemisath, throwing his lot in with the Primalists. You defeated his forces that launched an attack on Maruukai.\nOhn'ahra's Blessing.\nThe Khanam Matra shared that she must blow the ancient &lt;a href=\"Horn%20of%20Drusahl\"&gt;Horn of Drusahl&lt;/a&gt; to answer the dragons' call for an alliance, but she needs Ohn'ahra's blessing. She sent you to &lt;a href=\"Teerakai\"&gt;her clan's home&lt;/a&gt; to ready her forces for war and connect with the mystics.\nYou spread the news of war and met &lt;a href=\"Boku\"&gt;Boku&lt;/a&gt;, an anxious mystic who cannot hear Ohn'ahra. You accompanied him to find the other mystics at &lt;a href=\"Ridgewater%20Retreat\"&gt;Ridgewater Retreat&lt;/a&gt; and find that Clan Nokhud has attacked. After saving some of the initiates, the Ohn'ir leader &lt;a href=\"Tigari%20Khan\"&gt;Tigari Khan&lt;/a&gt; sent you and Boku to find Ohn'ahra.\nYou discovered the Primalists and Nokhud attacking &lt;a href=\"Windsong%20Rise\"&gt;Windsong Rise&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"Koroleth\"&gt;Koroleth&lt;/a&gt; tried to capture Ohn'ahra. Though you attempted to stop her, Koroleth knocked the two of you off the cliff and out of her way.\nThe Azure Span.\nInto the Archives.\nYou arrived at the Azure Span to help the Kirin Tor and Kalecgos, the aspect of the blue dragons, track down the Azure Oathstone.\nYou fought off a primalist attack in Camp Antonidas before traveling to the Azure Archives. There, you discovered the Azure Oathstone and the simulacrum of Sindragosa, former prime consort of the blue dragonflight.\nSindragosa informed you and Kalecgos that the Azure Oathstone could not be empowered until the ley lines within the Azure Span were repaired.\nYou set off to find the tuskarr within Azure Span for better guidance regarding the location of the ley lines.\nTuskarr Troubles.\nYou found a group of tuskarr willing to help investigate the ley lines and tracked down a caravan traveling with the tuskarr chieftain, Brena.\nThe caravan had been set upon by a group of gnolls, and several members of the caravan were captured. Brena asked you to help defeat the gnolls and rescue her friends.\nAlthough you successfully rescued the missing tuskarr, you also discovered something disturbing in the process. The gnolls appeared to be utilizing decay magic to taint and rot the land around them. Dismayed, Brena set out to investigate the apparent source of the decay--Brackenhide Hollow.\nDecayed Roots.\nYou travelled with Brena and Norukk to Brackenhide Hollow, where you met up with one of Kalecgos's mirror images. One of the ley lines he sought to repair was in the thick of Brackenhide Hollow. Kalecgos and Brena decided to help each other by hunting down the source of the decay and getting rid of it.\nWorking with Brena and Kalecgos, you put the spirits of fallen tuskarr to rest and worked to bring down an Ancient that the gnolls were withering away with decay. After successfully defeating the Ancient, Kalecgos was able to repair the ley line.\nWith matters in hand, Kalecgos was ready to depart, but Brena asked both of you to travel with her to her home, Iskaara. There, Brena gave Kalecgos more information about ley lines in the area, and you participated in the funeral for Ponoliak, the former chieftain of Iskaara. Kalecgos, having learned much from the Iskaara tuskarr, asked you to meet him at the Azure Archives.\nVakthros.\nAt the Azure Archives, you watched as Kalecgos attempted to summon the scattered blue dragonflight. Suddenly Khadgar arrived with dire news--Razsageth herself had arrived to take down an ancient tower called Vakthros, an act that Sindragosa said would destroy not only the tower, but the Azure Span along with it.\nAfter travelling to Vakthros, you met up with Khadgar and Kalecgos and worked to fight back the Primalist forces and get to the tower to confront Raszageth.\nTogether with Kalecgos and Khadgar, you stopped Raszageth's plans. She turned her fury on Kalecgos, but a group of blue dragons arrived just in time to protect him. Furious, Raszageth flew off, leaving Kalecgos and the others to return to the Azure Archives.\nThaldraszus.\nValdrakken, City of Dragons.\nYou traveled to meet Kalecgos in the dragon capitol of Valdrakken. Atop the Seat of the Aspects, he warned the others of Raszageth's activities and the rise of Primalist agression. After uncovering insurgency within the city, you raced to the South Hold Garrison.\nUpon reaching South Hold, you we met with Primalists actively attacking the garrison. You fought off the invaders and sought out the garrison commander, Eranog.\nHowever, Eranog proved to be a traitor and had sided with the Primalists in exchange for firey power. He disappeared, leaving the garrison in the claws of Magmatalon, who you then defeated.\nTime Management.\nAt Nozdormu's request, you traveled to the Shifting Sands to speak with Chromie. She informed you that an attack by the Infinite Flight had disabilized time in the region, and asked you to assist the Timewalkers in restoring order.\nAfter rescuing novice timewalker Siaszerathel, you were trained in the use of Timewalker tools by the more senior Andantenormu. Results were mixed, but mostly positive. With the Shifting Sands under control, you all turned your attention to the Temporal Conflux.\nAt the Temporal Conflux you finally saw the source of all the distortion. The infinite dragon Eternus who was trying to effect the bronze Oathstone. Her presence had triggerd a lockdown which was now holding most of the Timewalkers.\nAfter freeing the Timewalkers, you fought and defeated a massive time elemental. With all your allied forces freed, Chromie led the attack on Eternus. However the Bronze and Infinite magics collided, sending the two dragons tumbling through time.\nBig Time Adventurer.\nNozdormu arrived just after Chromie and Eternus were lost. He informed you they were falling through time, creating ripples. He asked you to go to a possible future to try to recover them.\nYou stepped through a portal and discovered a Primalist Tomorrow. A potential future where the Primalists are winning against a small group of holdouts. While you were able to help the rebels, and met their leader, you! You could not stabilize Chromie.\nYou next tried to stabilize Chromie in a strange, alternate past. Azmerloth.\nYou made further progress in stabilize Chromie, but she was pulled away before you could finish. While in this strange, murloc ruled world, you met yourself. Or a version of yourself at least. Together you fought against the Deathlings and took down the finned aspect of death before returning to Nozdormu.\nIn a last attempt to save Chromie, you raced through time itself, following her deeper into Azeroth's past. Your headlong rush ended in a time before the Titans, when the Old Gods fought the Elementals lords at the height of their power. You reached the Black Empire.\nFinally able to stabilize Chromie, you recieved some unexpected assistance from Eternus in returning to the present. For her help, Eternus was allowed to fly free. The future remained very clouded for Nozdormu.\nYour actions restored the Bonze Oathstone and you were sent to inform Alexstrasza in Valdrakken.\nDragonflight.\nThe Mother Oathstone.\nAfter hearing a brief update on Tyrhold, you and Alexstrasza travelled to Tyrhold. Alexstrasza was unable to reactivate the Mother Oathstone, a failure which greatly pleased the lurking Raszageth.\nWhile Alexstrasza and Raszageth fought, you faced off against the empowered protodrake Ezrigeth. After emerging victorious, Nozdormu arrived and advised we would need to act quickly to stop Raszageth from freeing the other Incarnates.\nThe Chieftain's Duty.\nYou were informed that Murik in Iskaara wanted to speak to you regarding a tuskarr tribe in The Waking Shores.\nAfter speaking to Murik, you learned that the Uktulut tribe mysteriously fell out of contact with Iskaara in recent weeks. You were tasked with attempting to make contact with them.\nThe standoffish Uktulut tribe rebuffed you and refused to let you speak to their chieftain. To prove yourself worthy of their time, you slayed a powerful Qalashi leader at Scalecracker Keep and brought back proof.\nYou learned that Tutaqan--the chieftain and huntmaster of the Uktulut tribe--has been purposefully withdrawing his guards and refusing to let his hunters venture far. Tutaqan dismissed your victory over the Qalashi and retreated to the ottuk holt, leaving you to help the villagers yourself.\nYou salvaged lost trading goods from the shallow river and brought them back to Crafter Kuliqa. She began making weapons for Uktulut's hunters and let you test one of the prototypes.\nYou also helped gather fish from the river for Elder Unujaak. You learned that the nearby Qalashi presence has been steadily heating the river, threatening the Uktulut tribe's main food source.\nAfter noticing your good deeds, Tutaqan revealed that he had been neglecting his duties because his hunting companion, an ottuk named Ipko, had recently gone missing along with several others.\nYou helped the chieftain search for Ipko near the Qalashi's territory and found her slain. You returned her body to the Tutaqan.\nYou assisted Tutaqan and Elder Unujaak in performing a ritual to safeguard Ipko's passage to the ancestors. Distraught with grief, Tutaqan left shortly after.\nEncouraged by Elder Unujaak, you found Tutaqan at the overlook above the village and offered to help him. He confided in you that knows he must find a new hunting ottuk and take his place as a leader again but that his grief is preventing him from doing it alone.\nYou brought several of Uktulut's trained ottuks to Tutaqan to help him find a new hunting companion. After meeting one taht displayed a sense of duty that Tutaqan found inspiring, he accepted the ottuk as his companion and named it Qipi.\nSomeone in the village sounded Tutaqan's hunting horn. You ventured down from the overlook to investigate and learned that the Qalashi, incensed by your earlier victory, had advanced west to boil the river upstream and finish off the tribe more quickly.\nFighting alongside Tutaqan and Qipi, you slayed Zhurtan the Riverboiler, the Qalashi leader responsible for Uktulut's troubles. You returned to the village victorious.\nTutaqan pledged to protect the village once more, promising that trade would resume with Iskaara and Uktulut would never endure these troubles again.\nThe Sealed Titan Door.\nNaleidea Rivergleam of the Dragonscale Expedition has a new expedition for you to embark on.\nThe Dragonscale Expedition discovered a mysterious sealed titan door in Thaldraszus. After traveling there with Naleidea and Toddy and exploring the area, you were no closer to figuring out how to open it. Naleidea advised you to travel to Valdrakken and speak with Watcher Koranos, to see if he has any information on the sealed facility.\nKoranos advised you to seek out watcher logs in Valrdakken. The logs revealed the potential location of three stones that could, when combined, unlock the sealed titan door.\nWhile you were discovering this information Sarkareth, leader of the Sundered Flame, attacked you and stole the logs.\nUpon returning to Naleidea and Toddy, you were tasked with hunting down and retrieving the three stones before Sarkareth and the Sundered Flame could claim them.\nWith the three stones of Tyr collected, unsealing the Titan Facility was within reach. Naleidea and Toddy asked you to meet them back at the Dragonscale Basecamp to discuss the next steps.\nBack at the Basecamp, Toddy came up with a plan to set up the facility entrance and open the door. However, she said she'd need some time to complete it. Continue working with the Dragonscale Expedition and Toddy will call for you when she's prepared.\nGarden of Secrets.\nA drakonid emissary named Rymek arrived at the Emerald Gardens and earned the trust of the green dragonflight. Through an act of betrayal, he revealed himself as a Primalist, invading the Emerald Dream to search for the nascent World Tree.\nThe Dreamer.\nNow that Malfurion Stormrage has taken Ysera's place in Ardenweald, the former green Aspect has returned to the Emerald Dream. We have reunited the green dragonflight and defeated Rymek. Growing in power, Merithra now leads as the new Dreamer.\nThe Silver Purpose.\nAlexstrasza and the other dragons leaders shared an ancient artifact with you that Keeper Tyr gave them long ago. Though it was long dormant it now pulsed with magical energy. You took the artifact to Tyrhold where you unlocked the mystery behind why it emanated such power.\nOpening the Door.\nCataloger Jakes at the Dragonscale Basecamp has a message for you.\nThe titan facility was successfully unsealed, but the main hall was locked behind an energy barrier. According to Toddy, passing through the ancient titan teleporters in the facility would give you access to override consoles that would bring the barrier down.\nAfter clearing out the Hall of Samples and the Hall of the Aspects, you were able to unseal the Hall of Records. However, there were more trials to face. Once you navigated the Hall of Records, you were finally able to retrieve titan discs full of valuable information.\nUpon making a hasty escape from the facility, you returned to the Dragonscale Basecamp with Naleidea and Toddy.\nEmbers of Neltharion.\nExtend Our Reach.\nThe dracthyr have returned to the Forbidden Reach. You were summoned there to speak with Viridia of the Healing Wings. Her dracthyr needed help rebuilding a tuskarr village, fending off raiders, and creating a refuge for all who would live here.\nBreaking Ground.\nThe Incarnates have made their move, leading Alexstrasza to call upon you and the black dragonflight for aid.\nThe Incarnates have blasted a hole and opened the way into caves far beneath the Dragon Isles. Fyrakk has entered the cave without the other Incarnates. Ebyssian, Sabellian, Wrathion, and you have been asked to pursue him.\nSundered Legacy.\nEbyssian and Emberthal arrived in Loamm, pursuing the Sundered Flame to discover their purpose in the caves. Sabellian and Wrathion are caught up in their own plans, but Ebyssian and you are ready to aid her.\nThe Sundered Flame are looking for Aberrus, Neltharion's secret laboratory from ages past. They have already found clues in a titan vault. The race is on to stop Sarkareth before he unlocks its secrets.\nYou have reached the vault, but Sarkareth and the Sundered Flame are already inside.\nThe Ancient Bargain.\nSabellian has determined the most likely place to find Fyrakk and has asked you to join the hunt in the Zaqali Caldera.\nInvestigating the caldera has revealed the djaradin are trying to awaken their elders from ancient slumber, and the primalists are aiding them.\nFyrakk has been bathing in the shadowflame, absorbing its power. Sabellian was struck by the shadowflame, but Ebyssian believes he can cure the injury with your help.\nUrged on by his losses against Fyrakk, Sabellian used a djaradin weapon to attack the Incarnate. The attack failed. The djaradin struck down Ebyssian and Fyrakk attacked the town of Loamm. Now both Ebyssian and Loamm need your help.\nThe fires in Loamm have been extinguished, but the time has come to inform Alexstrasza of what happened.\nInherited Sin.\nDespite Alexstrasza's worries about the risk of exposure to the shadowflame, Ebyssian insists the black dragons must contain any other threats that may reside in Aberrus.\nAt the Obsidian Rest, you have been asked to aid them against the djaradin encroaching on the lab.\nThe djaradin seek to free an ancient and powerful elder from Aberrus. This could be a threat to all dragons.\nWhile battling the djaradin, the black dragons discovered slitherdrakes who escaped from Aberrus. Now they must be protected from the djaradin and their jailers.\nInevitable Confrontation.\nAlthough Wrathion and Sabellian have gone their separate ways, Emberthal is still pursuing Sarkareth alone. Ebyssian has urged you to find her.\nSarkareth is making his way into Aberrus, which is guarded by both the Sundered Flame, and the servants of the long gone master of the lab, Neltharion. You will need all of the dragons to face this.\nEbyssian and you have rallied Sabellian and Wrathion to aid Emberthal and breach Aberrus.\nThe black dragons have a foothold in Aberrus. Now is the time to join Emberthal in stopping Sarkareth's mad plan.\nA Flame, Extinguished.\nWhile you have defeated many of the threats within Aberrus, some still linger. Sabellian and Wrathion must pick up the pieces, and forge a new future for the black dragonflight."}

Only Mograine and a handful of Ebon Blade &lt;a href=\"Death%20knight\"&gt;Death Knights&lt;/a&gt; remained as you began your search.\nYou discovered &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina&lt;/a&gt; defending an injured &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; against Mawsworn forces.\nForlorn Respite.\nYou retreated to a nearby cave, where Jaina and Thrall recounted their time in the Maw. It appears that they were being tested by a mysterious figure known as &lt;a href=\"the%20Jailer\"&gt;the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, with whom Sylvanas has allied. Jaina knew the whereabouts of the others, but was unsure how to escape the Maw.\nWith the aid of Mograine, you captured &lt;a href=\"Tormented%20Amalgamation\"&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; of the more ancient, hostile souls in hopes of it knowing a way to escape the Maw.\nThe Tremaculum.\nJaina and Thrall accompanied you to the &lt;a href=\"Tremaculum\"&gt;Tremaculum&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin&lt;/a&gt; was last seen. After evading a confrontation with Sylvanas and defeating the &lt;a href=\"Phael%20the%20Afflictor\"&gt;warden&lt;/a&gt; holding Anduin captive, you and your allies returned to &lt;a href=\"Forlorn%20Respite\"&gt;Forlorn Respite&lt;/a&gt; to check on Mograine's progress interrogating the ancient soul.\nA Possible Path.\nMograine's interrogation proved fruitful, and the soul revealed a possible exit via an &lt;a href=\"Eroded%20Waystone\"&gt;ancient waystone&lt;/a&gt; located near a place called &lt;a href=\"Zovaal%27s%20Cauldron\"&gt;Zovaal's Cauldron&lt;/a&gt;.

You and Thrall sought out the &lt;a href=\"%3AWither%20Blade\"&gt;:Wither Blade&lt;/a&gt; used to poison the High Chieftain and destroyed it, restoring Baine's health.\nZovaal's Cauldron.\nWith the aid of Jaina's invisibility spell, you and your allies sneaked past Zovaal's Cauldron, witnessing mighty armies being rallied by the Jailer for an unknown purpose.\nThe Waystone.\nYou found the &lt;a href=\"Eroded%20Waystone\"&gt;dormant waystone&lt;/a&gt;, which immediately responded to your presence. Sensing this, the Jailer sent the entirety of his forces to prevent your escape. While your allies fought to buy time, the waystone activated and freed you from the Maw.\nThough you were narrowly able to escape, your allies were taken by the Jailer. You arrived alone in the mysterious city of &lt;a href=\"Oribos\"&gt;Oribos&lt;/a&gt;.\nBastion.\nYou have been sent to investigate the mysterious Mawsworn kyrian you encountered within the Maw. Only the Archon who oversees Bastion will know their true nature.\nEternity's Call.\nAs you arrived in &lt;a href=\"Bastion\"&gt;Bastion&lt;/a&gt; you met &lt;a href=\"Kleia\"&gt;Kleia&lt;/a&gt;, who helped you make contact with the &lt;a href=\"ascended\"&gt;ascended&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kalisthene\"&gt;Kalisthene&lt;/a&gt;. In order to gain an audience with the &lt;a href=\"Kyrestia%20the%20Firstborne\"&gt;Archon&lt;/a&gt;, you were instructed to follow the path of the &lt;a href=\"kyrian\"&gt;kyrian&lt;/a&gt; as if you were an aspirant. After saving Kleia's soulbind, &lt;a href=\"Pelagos\"&gt;Pelagos&lt;/a&gt;, from a mediation gone awry, you made your way to &lt;a href=\"Aspirant%27s%20Crucible\"&gt;Aspirant's Crucible&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Aspirant's Crucible.\nIn the Crucible you viewed your deeds in life and trained alongside kyrian aspirants, helping fight against the &lt;a href=\"anima\"&gt;anima&lt;/a&gt; drought in the process. After confronting your own burdens from life, you successfully earned the favor of Kalisthene--and access to a portion of Bastion's power.\nThe Temple of Purity.\nPelagos joined you in the nearby &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Purity\"&gt;Temple of Purity&lt;/a&gt;, where the number of kyrian falling into a darkened state has increased dramatically during the anima drought. Although you tried to save all you could, the fallen have organized into a group known as the &lt;a href=\"Forsworn\"&gt;Forsworn&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Forsworn launched a surprise attack on the Temple of Purity, and you helped push it back. In your confrontation with &lt;a href=\"Lysonia\"&gt;Lysonia&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the assault, you were able to obtain a &lt;a href=\"Fragment%20of%20Lysonia\"&gt;fragment of her essence&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Vesiphone\"&gt;Paragon of Purity's&lt;/a&gt; aid.\nChasing a Memory.\nYou took Lysonia's fragment to the &lt;a href=\"Mnemonic%20Locus\"&gt;Mnemonic Locus&lt;/a&gt;, where you learned more about the origins of the Forsworn. Forgelite Prime &lt;a href=\"Mikanikos\"&gt;Mikanikos&lt;/a&gt; helped you uncover an incoming second Forsworn attack somewhere in Bastion.\nBy the Archon's Will.\nIn order to warn the Archon of the imminent attack you traveled to &lt;a href=\"Hero%27s%20Rest\"&gt;Hero's Rest&lt;/a&gt;. You were granted a &lt;a href=\"steward\"&gt;steward&lt;/a&gt; companion of your choosing, who then helped you activate the beacon to summon &lt;a href=\"Polemarch%20Adrestes\"&gt;Polemarch Adrestes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"herald\"&gt;herald&lt;/a&gt; of the Archon.\nYou entered &lt;a href=\"Elysian%20Hold\"&gt;Elysian Hold&lt;/a&gt;, home of the &lt;a href=\"ascended\"&gt;ascended&lt;/a&gt;, and finally met with the Archon. She asked you to inspect the wards protecting Bastion's five temples. While inspecting the wards, you came upon a Forsworn &lt;a href=\"Uther\"&gt;Uther&lt;/a&gt; the Lightbringer. Uther disabled the ward for the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Courage\"&gt;Temple of Courage&lt;/a&gt;, leaving it vulnerable to attack.\nThe Temple of Courage.\nAs you, Kleia, and Pelagos flew to meet Mikanikos at the Temple of Courage, you saw a &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxus\"&gt;Maldraxxian&lt;/a&gt; Necropolis enter the sky above and begin sieging the area. You helped push back the Maldraxxus assault, but at the loss of the Hand of Courage, &lt;a href=\"Thanikos\"&gt;Thanikos&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Xandria\"&gt;Xandria&lt;/a&gt;, the Paragon of Courage, chased after the necromancer Amarth the Harvester and his allies deeper within the Necrotic Wake. You were tasked both with aiding her, and informing Oribos of Maldraxxus's betrayal.\nBlade of the Primus.\nThe armies of Maldraxxus have assaulted Bastion. You have been sent into this wartorn realm to discover the reason why.\nChampion of Pain.\nUpon entering &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxus\"&gt;Maldraxxus&lt;/a&gt;, you were immediately thrust into a grand melee. Left with no other options, you were forced to prove yourself in combat against myriad foes.\nYour victory in the arena drew the attention of the margraves, leaders of the three remaining Maldraxxi houses. As they argued with one another, you learned that the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Rituals\"&gt;House of Rituals&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Constructs\"&gt;House of Constructs&lt;/a&gt; orchestrated the attack on Bastion. Shortly after, the &lt;a href=\"Theater%20of%20Pain\"&gt;Theater of Pain&lt;/a&gt; erupted into all-out war.\nBaroness &lt;a href=\"Draka\"&gt;Draka&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20the%20Chosen\"&gt;House of the Chosen&lt;/a&gt; pulled you from the chaos of the arena. The two of you were shot out of the sky en route to the House of the Chosen.\nHouse of the Chosen.\nAs Draka led you to the House of the Chosen, she told you of how the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Plagues\"&gt;House of Plagues&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Eyes\"&gt;House of Eyes&lt;/a&gt; have fallen in the absence of the &lt;a href=\"Primus\"&gt;Primus&lt;/a&gt;, the missing leader of all Maldraxxus. Upon arriving at the Chosen's stronghold, you met &lt;a href=\"Margrave%20Krexus\"&gt;Margrave Krexus&lt;/a&gt; and learned that the remaining houses are embroiled in civil war. Order must be restored for the sake of the Shadowlands.\nAfter assisting with the Chosen's preparations for war, you underwent a rite of initiation wherein you crossed a pool of molten slag to reach an ancient stone. It shattered upon your touch and revealed an unfinished blade forged by the Primus. You also heard his voice speak to you of a key for the worthy.\nYou brought the blade to &lt;a href=\"Bonesmith%20Heirmir\"&gt;Bonesmith Heirmir&lt;/a&gt;, a former apprentice to the Primus. She finished forging the weapon and one of the runes etched upon it began to glow. Krexus suggested that the five runes on the blade represent the qualities favored by the Primus in all his soldiers: ambition, guile, might, insight, and the relentless pursuit of victory. He also noted that the runes match those on the door to the Seat of the Primus, a sealed fortress said to contain the Primus's greatest armaments.\nOn Krexus's orders, you brought the runeblade to the Seat of the Primus and witnessed the Rune of Ambition transfer its power to the door. Though Draka was eager to empower the other runes, &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Vyraz\"&gt;Baron Vyraz&lt;/a&gt; insisted that opening the door would do little good if the Chosen did not win the war. Outnumbered two to one, it was clear that the House of the Chosen would need new allies to even the battlefield.\nMatron of Spies.\nDraka tasked you with securing support from the remnants of the House of Eyes, to which she once belonged. You sought out Baroness &lt;a href=\"Vashj\"&gt;Vashj&lt;/a&gt;, Draka's former colleague and rival. Though she was loathe to ally with Draka, Vashj agreed to join your cause if you would assist her in claiming revenge against &lt;a href=\"Mor%27Bitan\"&gt;Mor'Bitan&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"lich\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt; responsible for the fall of her house.\nYou captured Mor'Bitan's &lt;a href=\"lieutenant\"&gt;lieutenant&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mephiles%20the%20Loyal\"&gt;Mephiles&lt;/a&gt;, and delivered him to Vashj. She extracted his memories and learned of a secret ritual being prepared nearby--one that Mor'Bitan himself would emerge to complete.\nHaving successfully sabotaged the ritual, you and Vashj lured Mor'Bitan into the open and slayed him. Your use of deception and subterfuge to achieve your goal resonated with the runeblade, empowering the Rune of Guile.\nHouse of Constructs.\nYou reported to &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Vyraz\"&gt;Baron Vyraz&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Spearhead%20%28Maldraxxus%29\"&gt;Spearhead&lt;/a&gt;, where a fierce battle raged between the House of Constructs and the House of the Chosen.\nWith the assistance of &lt;a href=\"Secutor%20Mevix\"&gt;Secutor Mevix&lt;/a&gt;, you pushed back the Constructs' forces and secured a forward position. Vyraz ordered you to continue the momentum and launch a direct assault on the House of Constructs, despite Mevix's protest that more reinforcements were required.\nThe outcome of the attempted siege was disastrous, leaving you and Mevix as the only two survivors. You were both captured by &lt;a href=\"Margrave%20Gharmal\"&gt;Margrave Gharmal&lt;/a&gt;, who left you to rot with the other bodies collected from the battlefield. As you emerged from a pile of corpses, you met a wounded kyrian aspirant who had survived the earlier assault on Bastion.\nBy taking control of an experimental construct made of kyrian flesh, you wreaked havoc upon the House of Constructs and slew &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Halis\"&gt;Baron Halis&lt;/a&gt;. After you escaped with Mevix, &lt;a href=\"Aspirant%20Thales\"&gt;Thales&lt;/a&gt;, and the others you had rescued, your overwhelming display of power awakened the &lt;a href=\"Rune%20of%20Might\"&gt;Rune of Might&lt;/a&gt; upon your blade.\nHouse of Plagues.\nAs you searched for survivors from the House of Plagues, you met Plague Deviser Marileth. Driven mad by the fallout of the house's destruction, he mistook you for his apprentice and enlisted your aid with conducting his experiments.\nOnce you helped Marileth create another slime for his collection, he mentioned finishing a potion for Margrave Stradama. As the rest of Maldraxxus thought she had been lost in the explosion, you were unsure if she truly survived the fall of her house or if Marileth was sharing one of his many delusions.\nMarileth spoke true about Margrave Stradama. She survived the destruction of her house, but was transformed into a being of slime and bone. Though her mind was twisted and ravaged just as Marileth's, the potion you helped concoct for her granted both of them a brief moment of lucidity. As a result of helping to clear their minds, the Rune of Insight ignited upon your blade.\nRitual for the Damned.\nIn your absence, the House of the Chosen suffered a fierce counterattack from the House of Constructs. Though your allies were able to hold their ground, Vyraz was wounded and Krexus was slain. Without the margrave, the Chosen stand little chance of victory. Vyraz sent you to Oribos on a desperate gambit to rescue the house's missing baron from the Maw.\nHighlord Bolvar gave you an amulet used by the Four Horsemen to help you track down Darion Mograine, who may know how to find the missing Maldraxxi baron. After freeing the death knight, you were saved from an ambush by a broker named Ve'nari.\nVe'nari knew of whom you sought and was willing to trade the knowledge of his location for your amulet. She then led you to Perdition Hold and the captive baron--who was revealed to be Alexandros Mograine, the Ashbringer. After breaking his bonds, you brought both him and Darion back to Oribos.\nThe Empty Throne.\nAlexandros Mograine revealed that Vyraz is a traitor, and that it was he who cast Mograine into the Maw, and he who must have slain Krexus. As Draka returned to the Seat of the Primus, you accompanied Mograine to the House of the Chosen in order to expose and confront Vyraz.\nReturning from the Maw with Mograine to face Vyraz in battle earned you the Rune of the Relentless, completing the key to unlock the Seat of the Primus. Though your fight with Vyraz was interrupted, the allies you gathered at the Seat held the line against the traitorous Maldraxxi forces until you could open the door. The power of the Primus cut a swath of destruction through your foes, forcing them to retreat.\nWithin the Seat, you discovered a dire warning from the Primus. The Jailer has called upon ancient allies in his bid to escape the Maw, and the Eternal Ones must unite against him. You returned to Oribos with the message in hand, ready to deliver it to the other realms.\nThe Groves of Ardenweald.\nYou bear an important message for the Winter Queen. Seek her out in the celestial groves of Ardenweald.\nWelcome to Ardenweald.\nThough you journeyed to Ardenweald to deliver an important message from the Primus of Maldraxxus to the Winter Queen, you learned that her unwavering focus on combatting the anima drought would make it difficult for you to gain a royal audience.\nUpon learning that the Queen would soon visit the grove of Tirna Vaal, Lady Moonberry tasked you with assisting the fae with preparing for her arrival in the hope of speaking with her.\nAiding Tirna Vaal.\nYou assisted Choofa, a soul in the form of a squirrel, by rescuing his captured friends in the Spirit Glen and restoring their animal forms. You discovered the chaotic spriggans who were terrorizing them had been emboldened a dark \"Ancient One.\"\nIn the Tranquil Pools, you helped Dreamweaver, a faerie who watches over slumbering nature spirits, tend to the grove's wildseeds and track down their missing caretakers. You also formed a bond with one special wildseed after soothing its spirit's nightmares. It almost seemed as if the spirit knew you...\nWaning Grove.\nHeartwood Grove, recently chosen to sacrifice its anima to sustain the other groves, fell victim to a sudden, malicious attack. Night fae who once called the grove home donned strange masks and turned on their former friends.\nYou helped rescue Niya, a young sylvar, and attempted to recover the anima from the stolen heart of the grove... but it was destroyed before your very eyes.\nGlitterfall Heights.\nUnable to meet with the Winter Queen during her brief visit to Tirna Vaal, you resolved to aid the forest in order to lesser her mounting burdens and secure her attention.\nTo that end, you lent your strength to the Wild Hunt at Glitterfall Basin. You rescued Ara'lon, a sylvar huntsman, and fought alongside Korayn, a fierce vorkai hunt-captain, to destroy the strange creatures known as the Blighted--night fae transformed by the dark magic of the masks.\nWhen you returned to Tirna Vaal, you found that your bonded wildseed's nightmares had grown worse. It needed to be moved somewhere better equipped to care for it.\nThis is the Way.\nYou and Niya escorted the dreaming wildseed toward Hibernal Hollow, but the road was blocked due to a massive Drust attack. You fought alongside Ara'lon and the Wild Hunt to drive them back.\nDreamweaver attempted a ritual to sooth the wildseed upon your arrival in Hibernal Hollow, but its nightmares were still too powerful. You realized that you needed more anima for the ritual to work.\nThe Fallen Tree.\nNiya and Ara'lon accompanied you to Tirna Noch, Ara'lon's former grove, now withered after its anima was reclaimed. You found that the Drust had seized control of the area and had stockpiled their stolen anima in the desiccated heart of the grove. Though you were able to take back the anima and escape the grove, the Drust began mustering for a counterattack.\nVisions of the Dreamer.\nBy infusing the anima from Tirna Noch into the dreamshrines surrounding Hibernal Hollow, you experienced the memories of the spirit inside the wildseed. At the climax of the ritual, you relived the moment of her death. The spirit was none other than Ysera, the slain Dragon Aspect of Dreams.\nThe Master of Revendreth.\nSire Denathrius may know the secrets to ending the anima drought. Venture into his realm of Revendreth to learn more.\nWelcome to Revendreth.\nUpon arriving in Revendreth you were greeted by the Lord Chamberlain with a request for you to accompany him directly to Sire Denathrius.\nWhile riding in a carriage you and the Lord Chamberlain were ambushed by rebel stoneborn led by General Draven.\nYou proceeded to rescue the Lord Chamberlain from the clutches of devourers, monsters from beyond the Shadowlands who seek to consume all anima. Their presence is a sign of the end times, according to local dredgers. You also met an enigmatic venthyr duelist named Nadjia the Mistblade, who was quite taken with your battle prowess and lively attitude.\nAfter escaping the clutches of the Endmire, you and the Lord Chamberlain made your way to the hamlet of Darkhaven.\nThe Master.\nThe anima drought has crippled the local venthyr of Darkhaven, leaving them vulnerable to attacks by rebels and devourers. They asked for you to convey their plight to the Master.\nSire Denathrius has dispatched you and the Lord Chamberlain to secure the Halls of Atonement from the defiant forces of the Accuser.\nThe Accuser.\nEmpowered by a Harvester's Medallion, the Accuser is undefeatable by conventional means. The Lord Chamberlain has asked for you to seek out the sinstone of the Accuser so that he might use it to bypass her defenses.\nBroken by the weight of her past, the Accuser falls to the combined forces of you and the Lord Chamberlain. The Master has asked for you to bring her to the Forest Ward where she can be properly condemned.\nThe Penitent Hunt.\nBy edict of Sire Denathrius, the Accuser stands condemned to a hunt by you and the Fearstalker. This ancient practice is used to torment souls who must confront their past sins through fear.\nWhile hunting, you and your fellow hunters were ambushed by the Accuser. After incapacitating your escort, the Accuser gifted you the ability to move through shadows so that you might see the truth of the rebellion.\nThe Accuser revealed to you a secret passage that leads deep into the bowels of Castle Nathria, where you discovered that Sire Denathrius has been the one behind the anima drought plaguing the Shadowlands.\nThe Fearstalker was defeated by your hand, her Medallion of Dread now in the hands of the Accuser. The rebels worry it will not be enough, and they have asked you to infiltrate the Ember Ward in search of the last person to see their former leader, Prince Renathal.\nThe Mad Duke.\nAfter forging your way into the Ember Ward, a deranged ash ghoul named Lost Sybille led you to the venthyr you were told to find: Theotar, the Mad Duke.\nTheotar was captured along with Prince Renethal during a failed revolt prior to your arrival in Revendreth. The last Theotar saw of the Prince, he was being taken to the ruined tower of Sinfall. The two of you made your way across the Light scorched wasteland to secure this ancient tower.\nPrince Renathal.\nWhile searching Sinfall you discovered a talking sword named Vorpalia, who informed you that Prince Renathal was tossed into the Maw. You, being a Maw Walker, represent her only opportunity to save her beloved Prince.\nWorking your way through the labyrinth of cells and horrors within Torghast, you were able to find and rescue the Curator and her allies. Through the use of an ancient spell, the Curator was able to teleport all of you back to Sinfall--but with the caveat that once the spell was used, it would never work again.\nThe Master of Lies.\nUpon returning to Sinfall, you were met by the combined forces of the Accuser, General Draven, and the many allies you gathered in your travels through Revendreth. With this newfound force, Prince Renathal has proposed a daring plan: an assault on the anima stores of the Master.\nThe Looming Dark.\nWith Denathrius's scheme exposed, you must decide how to respond.\nThreads of Fate.\nAiding the Shadowlands.\nFatescribe Roh-Tahl helped you weave the threads of fate to pull your destiny forward.\nYou aligned yourself with a covenant, then set off to aiding the realms of the Shadowlands.\nBolstering Bastion.\nYou aided the Kyrian against the Forsworn threat, both directly and by strengthening their position across their realm.\nRallying Maldraxxus.\nWith the great houses of Maldraxxus in turmoil, you helped the House of the Chosen regain its footing and stand strong against its former brethren.\nAiding Ardenweald.\nYou helped protect the remaining groves from assault, giving the Winter Queen and her court a chance to stabilize the eternal forest.\nReinforcing Revendreth.\nDenathrius's betrayal left Prince Renathal and his rebellion in a precarious position. Your efforts gave them a fighting chance against their former master.\nKyrian Campaign.\nThe noble kyrian of Bastion face dire circumstances with the impending Forsworn forces threatening to unravel their realm. They will need your aid if they are to reclaim Bastion and save the Shadowlands.\nAmong the Kyrian.\nAfter choosing to align yourself with the Kyrian Covenant you returned to Bastion to a grand reception, where you were welcomed into the covenant by the Archon herself. You learned the functions of your new base of operations in Elysian Hold and became soulbinds with the aspirant Pelagos.\nTorghast.\nHighlord Bolvar Fordragon sent you into Torghast, Tower of the Damned to rescue Baine Bloodhoof from the clutches of Warden Arkoban.\nWith Baine safe in Oribos, you returned to Torghast with one of the Warden's keys to plunge further into the tower's depths. Your search brought you to a mysterious prisoner known as the Runecarver.\nYou recovered one of the Runecarver's memories from the Maw, then worked with Ve'nari to free one of his bonds. In exchange, the Runecarver has offered to help you craft powerful armor.\nTrial of Ascension.\nYou aided Kleia in her final trial on the path to ascencion, helping perform the Rite of Guidance to open the way through the veil. Upon cross over, you witnessed the last moments of a life before escorting them to the Shadowlands. In Oribos, Kleia learned the truth about the drought: souls are being cast directly into the Maw.\nWith your help Kleia became an Ascended, but a Forsworn attack on Elysian Hold led by Uther interrupted the ceremony and damaged the Crest of Ascension. After repelling the attack, Kleia asks to become your second soulbind.\nIn the Spires of Ascension, you helped halt the final Forsworn assault and defeat their leader--Devos, the Paragon of Loyalty--once and for all.\nPhaestus, Genesis of Aeons.\nWithout the Crest of Ascension, no new Kyrian can ascend. You traveled to the Eternal Forge and meet with Mikanikos, Forgelite Prime of Bastion in order to recover the legendary hammer Phaestus and build the Crest anew.\nHowever, the great forge was under Forsworn control. While repelling the threat you helped Mikanikos finish Bron, a modified goliath that proved instrumental in pushing the enemy back to the Temple of Loyalty. With Phaestus finally in hand, you successfully rebuilt the Crest of Ascension even stronger than before.\nRighteous Retribution.\nAlexandros Mograine of Maldraxxus visited Elysian Hold with an offer to join forces. Together, he hoped to take out the depraved Margrave Gharmal, who led the surprise attack on the Temple of Courage.\nYou and Xandria met Draka and Alexandros aboard the Zerekriss necropolois, then staged a large-scale assault on the Margrave's forces in the House of Constructs to draw him out.\nAfter defeating Gharmal, Xandria carved out the fleshshaper's heart at Alexandros' suggestion. The heart was then taken to Elysian Hold and placed in the Crest of Ascension, greatly increasing its power.\nThe Seal of Contrition.\nSpurred on by your success in Maldraxxus, you, Kleia and Pelagos traveled to Revendreth to seek further empowerments for the Crest of Ascension. \nThe Curator knew of a potential target in the Seal of Contrition but its location was lost to her. However, the Countess knew of its whereabouts. After locating the Countess' sinstone, you were able to persuade her to tell you how to find it.\nYour search sent you to the Ember Ward, where Alwin, the former holder, led you to the Seal's current holder, Duke Vielle. You killed the Duke and recovered the Seal, returning to Bastion. There, Kalisthene reported that Lysonia was now leading the Forsworn. The Seal was placed in the Crest, further empowering it. \nVessel of Ardenweald.\nTo further empower the Crest, you and Pelagos traveled to Ardenweald to seek some of its magic from the Winter Queen. Although the Winer Queen was willing to aid you, she said the power required containment. The faerie Willowblossom volunteered to aid you in prepairing a suitable vessel for Ardenweald's magic.\nAfter saving the worm Grubby from spriggan tricksters and playing a few tricks, you obtained the necessary ingredients for the ritual. It was then you learned that Willowblossom would become the vessel, giving her life in the process.\nHer sacrifice was not in vain, as the vessel completed the Crest of Ascension. Once it was sealed, the Crest was fully empowered and protected from future attack.\nClosing In.\nKyrian scouts tracked Lysonia, the new leader of the Forsworn, to the Temple of Humility. You and Kleia intervened, saving Kyrian from being overtaken by pride and using the Paragon of Humility's legendary blade, Compassion, to push back the Forsworn occupation.\nAs you arrived to Lysonia and Chyrus' location, Helya opened a portal allowing Lysonia and Uther to escape into the Maw. You and Kleia pursued her, ultimately facing a powerful manifestation of Lysonia's pride after she betrayed Uther in a dark ritual. You escorted Uther out of the Maw and then parted ways to prepare for the final assault on Lysonia.\nThe Bell Tolls.\nWith the final assault on the Forsworn citadel in the Temple of Loyalty at hand, you called the Paragons to form a plan and rallied the Kyrian to action. The combined might of the Archon's forces assaulted the Temple from all sides, until Lysonia revealed that she had drawn the Kyrian away from Elysian Hold, leaving the Archon vulnerable.\nYou rushed back to the hold to defend the Archon, where Lysonia unleashed the full extent of her Maw power. Uther arrived to aid in defeating his former master, turning the tide of the battle until the Archon could deal the final blow.\nUther was granted clemency for his efforts, and traveled to the Temple of Wisdom with Thenios to delve further into his unique ailment.\nThe Art of War.\nThe ambitious Necrolords face a threat of extinction at their own hand. Your presence will forge disparate fragments into an army capable of challenging fate itself.\nWar Never Changes.\nUpon your return to Maldraxxus, you learned that the Seat of the Primus remains under siege. In binding your service to the Necrolords, you have sworn to turn the tide of battle.\nYou have repelled the enemy forces who were assailing the Seat of the Primus... for now.\nTorghast.\nHighlord Bolvar Fordragon sent you into Torghast, Tower of the Damned to rescue Baine Bloodhoof from the clutches of Warden Arkoban.\nWith Baine safe in Oribos, you returned to Torghast with one of the Warden's keys to plunge further into the tower's depths. Your search brought you to a mysterious prisoner known as the Runecarver.\nYou recovered one of the Runecarver's memories from the Maw, then worked with Ve'nari to free one of his bonds. In exchange, the Runecarver has offered to help you craft powerful armor.\nThe House of Eyes.\nIn order to cement the Necrolords' defenses, Baroness Vashj plans to seize control of an enemy necropolis. You are to rendezvous with her near the House of Eyes.\nHaving assembled a crew of surviving Eyes and renegades from other houses, you returned to the Seat of the Primus while Vashj began preparing for the next phase of the mission.\nGrand Theft Necropolis.\nUpon receiving word from Vashj, you reunited with the Eyes and reviewed the plan to hijack the necropolis.\nDespite unforeseen complications, you successfully stormed the Ossein Foundry and took possession of the necropolis Zerekriss. Within its halls, you discovered the lost Bracers of the Primus.\nDo Not Forget.\nThe Necrolords have received word that the House of Constructs continues its assault on Bastion. Always a man of honor, Alexandros Mograine volunteered to join the kyrian defenders with your help.\nAfter defeating the Construct forces at the Temple of Courage and forging an alliance with the kyrian, you accompanied Mograine on a journey to help him accept that Maldraxxus is where his soul beings.\nA Golden Dawn.\nWith the battle plans drawn, the Necrolord and Kyrian covenants joined forces to besiege the House of Constructs. You reported for duty, ready to join the assault.\nYour attack on the House of Constructs was successful, resulting in the demise of Margrave Gharmal. You discovered the Mantle of the Primus among the margrave's belonings... along with canisters of anima sourced from Revendreth.\nThe Wages of Sin.\nYou have journeyed to Revendreth with Draka in order to investigate reports of Maldraxxi conspirators plotting against the realm.\nHaving exposed and ended the collusion between the house of Rituals and Revendreth, you collected the Primus's pauldrons and discovered the mastermind behind the house's machinations: the lich Kel'Thuzad.\nThe House of Rituals.\nThe Necrolords have committed their resources to infiltrating the House of Rituals. A lich named Balmedar has offered to aid your efforts to infiltrate the house.\nBoth you and Balmedar were discovered and imprisoned as you attempted to spy on Kel'Thuzad. You escaped your cell just in time to witness Kel'Tuzad and Baroness Ninadar overthrow Margrave Sin'dane.\nAssault on the House of Rituals.\nFollowing his trecherous coup, Kel'Thuzad seized command of the House of Rituals. Alongside your allies from Revendreth, the Necrolords laid siege to the liches' fortress.\nThough you triumphed over the House of Rituals and restored Margrave Sin'dane to power, the Jailer's minions helped Kel'Thuzad escape before you could detain him. With the Staff of the Primus in your possession and the traitors expunged from the realm, Maldraxxus is on the path to reunification.\nNight Fae Campaign.\nThe groves of Ardenweald are dying. As each great celestial tree falls, the Winter Queen's desperation grows. The Queen and her Court of Night need your help to restore balance to the forest. \nThe Heart of the Forest.\nAfter choosing to align yourself with the Night Fae Covenant, you returned to Ardenweald. There you were allowed entry into the Heart of the Forest. With many of Ardenweald's souls in attendance, you received the boon of Soulshape, the first of many gifts granted to those who join the covenant. You then learned that you had an important tradition to uphold: your grand introduction!\nFor Queen and Grove!\nWith the assistance of some friends, and a little bit of magic, you starred in a stage production recreating the dramatic events on Azeroth which led up to your arrival in the Shadowlands. Your performance impressed not only the Court of Night, but the Winter Queen as well. \nYsera, who was in the audience, learned that what she had thought were dreams and nightmares were visions of events on Azeroth. As she bore you to the Heart of the Forest, Ysera confided that she had also dreamed of Tyrande Whisperwind becoming the Night Warrior, and that she was concerned for the futures of both Tyrande and Ardenweald.\nNow properly introduced to the Night Fae, you were formally bound to their covenant in a ceremony presided by the Winter Queen.\nTorghast.\nHighlord Bolvar Fordragon sent you into Torghast, Tower of the Damned to rescue Baine Bloodhoof from the clutches of Warden Arkoban.\nWith Baine safe in Oribos, you returned to Torghast with one of the Warden's keys to plunge further into the tower's depths. Your search brought you to a mysterious prisoner known as the Runecarver.\nYou recovered one of the Runecarver's memories from the Maw, then worked with Ve'nari to free one of his bonds. In exchange, the Runecarver has offered to help you craft powerful armor.\nThe Maw.\nYou returned to the Maw, where you reunited with the broker Ve'nari. By accepting the terms of her agreement, you procured a Soulkeeper crystal that allowed you to bring several lost souls out of the Maw. You also discovered that Baine Bloodhoof is being held prisoner in Torghast, the Tower of the Damned, but that you will need a plan of action before you can attempt to rescue him.\nRegrowth.\nAfter you brought the rescued souls back to Ardenweald, you learned more about the Heart of the Forest and the powers that lie dormant within its roots. You were also granted the boon of Soulbinding and bound yourself to Niya.\nDaughter of the Night Warrior.\nYsera asked you to meet Shandris Feathermoon in Oribos and help her recover Tyrande Whisperwind from the Maw. You aided Shandris in tracking down Tyrande, whose Night Warrior powers had allowed her to carve a path of destruction through the Jailer's forces but also threatened to tear her apart. \nThe two of you followed Tyrande into Torghast. There, you witnessed the awesome power of the Night Warrior and rescued many captive kaldorei souls. Tyrande refused to return with you and Shandris, saying she would not stop until she had slain Sylvanas.\nYou returned to Ardenweald, where the souls you had freed would find peace. Ysera and Shandris vowed to find a way to save Tyrande from the all-consuming power of the Night Warrior.\nDa Boss.\nYou joined forces with Bwonsamdi to investigate the strange disappearances of several powerful nature spirits within Ardenweald. During your search, you uncovered a secret plot by the death loa Mueh'zala to awaken the evil loa Dambala and Hakkar into his service.\nRealizing that he had no choice but to stand against his master, Bwonsamdi asked you to beseech the Winter Queen for her aid. Upon hearing of Mueh'zala's treachery, the Queen dispatched the Wild Hunt to rid the forest of Mueh'zala's minions. Fighting alongside your fellow huntsmen and huntresses, you defeated Dambala and drove Mueh'zala's followers out of Ardenweald.\nNight Warrior's Curse.\nYsera told you of Thiernax, a mortal soul in Ardenweald who had been his world's Night Warrior in life. You met Thiernax and learned that the tremendous power of the Night Warrior had killed both him and his husband, Qadarin. While fighting malicious spriggan in the Garden of Night, Qadarin was afflicted with a terrible curse.\nMoonberry had you retrieve information on how to counter the curse while Qadarin could still be saved. Following the scroll's instructions, you acquired what was needed--including a token that symbolized the deep love between Ysera and her sister, Alexstrasza--and broke the curse on Qadarin. Grateful for your help, Thiernax pledged his support to help save Tyrande from the tragic fate of the Night Warrior.\nDrust to Drust.\nYou helped Ara'lon rescue Gweyir, a Possessed huntress, and were sent to Drustvar in search of a way to break the curse placed upon her. You returned with a powerful Drust fetish and instructions to seek out Kivarr, an ancient Thornspeaker.\nYour search for Kivarr led you to Eventide Grove, where the Drust had taken her captive. Following her rescue, Kivarr sent you and Ara'lon to find special reagents for a ritual to break the curse. Unfortunately, Ara'lon never returned and you were sent to fulfill the mission in his place.\nThough you and Kivarr performed the ritual, you were unable to break the curse. Gweyir perished, proving that there is no coming back for the fae who fall under the Drust's thrall.\nThe Horned Hunter.\nThiernax shared with you a possible way to save Tyrande from the fate of the Night Warrior: dispersing its power into other former Night Warriors whose souls now rested in the Shadowlands. To find them, Lord Herne of the Wild Hunt suggested you seek the famed Horned Hunter, Huln Highmountain.\nHuln agreed to help you search the Shadowlands for the other Night Warriors, but he first had to finish hunting his assigned quarry. You assisted Huln in tracking down a massive devourer, a worldeater named Voras. You and Huln set a trap for your prey and then vanquished it. True to his word, Huln began his search for others who had once borne the mantle of the Night Warrior.\nDeal for a Loa.\nAt his necropolis in Nazmir, Bwonsamdi revealed to both you and Vol'jin that Mueh'zala was the one who had tricked Vol'jin into naming Sylvanas warchief and that he had cast an ancient nature spirit into the Maw.\nWith Vol'jin's help, you rescued not just the spirit--the wild god Ashamane--but the loa Hir'eek and Shadra as well. You also found Rezan, but were too late to save him. The loa of kings transferred the last of his essence into Vol'jin.\nUpon your return, the Winter Queen was intrigued that Vol'jin's mortal soul held the remnants of a loa. Though she could not guarantee what fate awaited him, the Queen allowed Vol'jin to slumber within a wildseed alongside the other spirits.\nDrust and Ashes.\nAlongside the Wild Hunt, you assaulted the last Drust stronghold in Ardenweald and faced off against their leader, Gorak Zhar. But when the final blow was struck, you learned that you had been fighting a possessed and glamoured Ara'lon. With his last breath, Ara'lon warned you that the stronghold was a diversion and that the Drust's true target was the Grove of Awakening.\nYsera bore you back to the Heart of the Forest as she inflicted everlasting sleep on as much of the Drust army as she could. Moved by the loss of yet another loyal servant, the Winter Queen brought her precious power to bear. Bolstered by the Queen's blessing, you reclaimed the Grove of Awakening and defeated Gorak Zhar, ending her attempts to conquer Ardenweald.\nVenthyr Campaign.\nThe road to redemption for Revendreth is a long one, and the Dark Prince of Sinfall is ready to walk it. He will need your help if he is to wrest control of Revendreth from the clutches of the Master and his loyalists.\nSinfall.\nThe threat to the Shadowlands and all of reality will require the aid and loyalty of the denizens of Revendreth. To that end, you have bound your service to Prince Renathal and his new Court of Harvesters to help turn the tide of this conflict and restore the anima that was stolen to the realms it belongs to.\nWith your help, Prince Renathal has reclaimed the ancient ruin of Sinfall for you to use as the base of your operations. After acquainting yourself with Sinfall, you are sent to the Maw to speak with Ve'nari.\nVe'nari gives you an item called the Soulkeeper, which allows you to rescue souls from the Maw. While setting up a beacon for Ve'nari, you find Baine Bloodhoof being dragged into Torghast. After recovering his mace, you return to Oribos and report to Bolvar about what you've seen.\nBolvar tells you he will come up with a plan for rescuing Baine. In the meantime, you report back to Sinfall with the souls you've saved, and soulbind with Nadjia the Mistblade.\nTorghast.\nHighlord Bolvar Fordragon sent you into Torghast, Tower of the Damned to rescue Baine Bloodhoof from the clutches of Warden Arkoban.\nWith Baine safe in Oribos, you returned to Torghast with one of the Warden's keys to plunge further into the tower's depths. Your search brought you to a mysterious prisoner known as the Runecarver.\nYou recovered one of the Runecarver's memories from the Maw, then worked with Ve'nari to free one of his bonds. In exchange, the Runecarver has offered to help you craft powerful armor.\nThe Court of Harvesters.\nPrince Renathal has a plan to seize control of Revendreth, whether Sire Denathrius still rules or not. To do so, he has employed your help to convene a meeting of the Court of Harvesters at Darkwall Tower.\nUsing various contacts and infiltration techniques, you were able to extend an invitation to the three Harvesters who might be willing to talk. With the Prince, the Accuser, and the Curator already on your side, the Court is able to convene with six of its seven members.\nThe Court convened, and the Prince laid out his plan--to combine the Harvester's medallions in order to seize control of Revendreth. But the venthyr were not swayed by Prince Renathal's words, and were unwilling to give up their medallions. Renathal had lost too many times for them to trust him.\nPride.\nWith the help of other Azerothian allies you were able to recover the Medallion of Pride from the clutches of the vile Lord Chamberlain. While the Halls of Atonement are still under the rule of those loyal to Denathrius, the power within is greatly weakened.\nDesire.\nThe Countess holds the Medallion of Desire and rules over the Castle Ward and its nobles. Theotar, the Mad Duke, has a plan that may be able to wrest the medallion from the Countess without incurring an open enemy.\nTheotar dispatched you to the Old Gate to find his old butler and house staff. The plan is to find THeotar's old estate where a secret entrance to the Countess's private chambers lays in wait. From there, you can steal the medallion.\nUpon securing Theotar's previous estate you were able to use the mirror there to enter into the chambers of the Countess. However, she was waiting for you... with her guards.\nYou were not invited, but you were also not unexpected. The Countess proposed an alternative to stealing her medallion. if you helped her with her plan to undermine her opposition, she would gladly hand the medallion over.\nTo that end, the Countess sent you into the noble district of Redelav where you gathered poisonous mushrooms, invited the elite to a party, and murdered Lord Andrei, one of her political rivals.\nWhile attending a party thrown by the Countess you had the chance to question the various guests. You discovered which house was in league with Lord Andrei in his plot to try and eliminate the Countess.\nAfter accusing the House of conspiracy against the Countess, you dispatched their leader swiftly and publicly. Pleased with your actions, the Countess provided her medallion, having proven her power comes from... other skills.\nAvarice.\nThe Medallion of Avarice was hidden by its Harvester, the Curator, before she was exiled to the Maw. Now that she is back, her mind is not stable enough to retrieve the hidden medallion on her own. She requires your help in the Catacombs Ward.\nThe Curator hid her medallion on the other side of a very special mirror. Before her capture she broke the mirror and entrusted the two halves to her underlings.\nAfter some searching of the Catacombs you were able to rescue Watcher Emil, the Curator's most trusted aid, along with his half of the mirror.\nThe second half of the mirror was in the hands of the traitorous Sinkeeper Mateo, the Curator's old protege who had more ambition than sense. Storming the Curator's old mansion of Archivam, you were able to retrieve the other half of the mirror.\nWith the mirror repaired you were able to venture into the secret crypt and recover the Medallion of Avarice from its hiding place.\nThe Crowned Prince.\nPrince Renathal's plan to harness the power of the medallions requires a conduit to channel the power. Revendreth lacks the craftsmen to create such an artifact.\nTo commission the construction of the artifact, Prince Renathal is dispatching you to Bastion. The plan is to restore an ancient mirror there. Though once used by the forces of Revendreth for nefarious purposes, it will now allow passage for General Draven and Theotar to join you.\nAfter a tense parley with the denizens of Bastion, General Draven was able to request the aid of Mikanikos, the Forgelite Prime. Draven offered to make amends, and repairs, for past sabotages performed by Revendreth.\nWith your help, Theotar and Draven were able to undo the damage inflicted upon the fores of Bastion and drive out the Forsworn occupying the area long enough to forge the artifact.\nAnd in the fires of battle, the Crown of the Harvesters was forged.\nThe unbridled power of the crown proved too potent for a mere mortal to wield, and too flooded with the echoes of Denathrius. It required purification at the Temple of Loyalty, fighting your way through legions of Forsworn Kyrian.\nCleansed of the Master's will, you were able to bring the new crown to Prince Renathal.\nConfronting Sin.\nDuring a raid on Castle Nathria, a corrupted and powerful soul was liberated from the Master's dark experiments. The Accuser has asked for your help in bringing this Kael'thas Sunstrider, once a prince and mage of great power, to atonement.\nTogether, you and the Accuser were able to untwine Kael'thas Sunstrider's soul from the corrupted anima he was infused with by the Master.\nWhile helping Kael'thas atone for his past deeds the two of you uncovered a conspiracy within the Chalice District of Revendreth. Venthyr who had openly opposed Prince Renathal were being outfitted with Maldraxxi weapons and working with a mysterious Lich.\nKael'thas was convinced that the way to learn more of the conspiracy was to spy upon the Tithelord, Harvester of Envy and current caretaker of the Village Ward.\nFollowing the Tithelord, you and Kael'thas discovered an entire encampment of Maldraxxus forces embedded within the Village Ward, working directly with the Tithelord. After defeating the lich in charge, you reported your findings to Prince Renathal.\nEnvy.\nWith the discovery of the Titheord's ties to Maldraxxus, Price Renathal has requested the presence of the Baroness Draka to assist in the apprehension of the Maldraxxi forces. The time had come for the Harvester of Envy to lose his medallion.\nWith Renathal and Draka by your side you took the fight to the Village Ward. There, the venthyr languishing under the yoke of the Tithelord's demands were liberated and convinced to join forces with Sinfall.\nWith the Tithelord's supply lines halted, his people in revolt against him, and his best stoneborn crushed, the time had come to take the fight to the harvester's home.\nUsing the Tithelord's own anima against him, you were able to defeat the Harvester of Envy and claim the medallion for Sinfall. However, in the battle, you discovered his contact in Maldraxxus was none other than the Arch-Lich Kel'Thuzad who now wields the Medallion of Dominion.\nWrath.\nThe Court of Harvesters used the combined powers of all seven medallions to secure Revendreth from Denathrius forever. In doing so, a new sigil was created.\nChains of Domination.\nBattle of Ardenweald.\nA terrible attack on Bastion has left the Archon wounded, and Ardenweald is the Jailer's next target. Highlord Bolvar has tasked you to keep the Winter Queen's sigil safe.\nAfter a bitter battle to protect Ardenweald, Sylvanas and Tyrande finally crossed blades. But the power of the Night Warrior was too great.\nIn the chaos, Anduin, dominated by the Jailer, sneaked behind Covenant lines and stole the Winter Queen's sigil.\nMaw Walkers.\nWorking with Ve'nari, you were able to open an ancient waygate in the new landscape of Korthia. Once activated, the waygate provided a portal to Oribos, establishing a foothold for your allies to pass to and from the Maw.\nFocusing the Eye.\nWhile assisting Ve'nari, you used a Korthian device and were transported to Desmotaeron where you discovered Baron Vyraz's forces.\nYou discovered a val'kyr, Danica, and freed her. After seeking out the aid of Odyn, you forced the Eye of the Jailer to retreat within the walls of Torghast.\nThe Last Sigil.\nYou raced against the forces of the Jailer to find a way to open the Vault of Korthia.\nOnce inside, you wrested control of a sigil from within the vault and brought it to the Runecarver in Torghast.\nGiving the Runecarver the sigil caused his memories to recover, and revealed the prisoner of Torghast to be none other than the Primus of Maldraxxus.\nThe Jailer appeared to retrieve the sigil. Just when it seemed victory was within reach, he seized the sigil through his weapon: Anduin Wrynn.\nThe Jailer departed, leaving you and the Primus alive. Before leaving Torghast, the Primus recreated an illusion of the Runecarver to help those souls still strapped within Torghast.\nOnce free of the tower, you and the Primus ventured to Korthia to prepare for the next steps against the Jailer.\nAn Army of Bone and Steel.\nWith the return of the Primus, the forces of Maldraxxus positioned themselves for a full assault in the Maw. They marched on Desmotaeron, a fortification at the foot of the Sanctum of Domination held by Helya and Vyraz.\nThe assault against Desmotaeron proved successful. Helya was banished back to Helheim by the Primus, and Vyraz slain. With the most immediate threats dealt with, the forces of the Covenants could now focus on issues closer to home -- and Maldraxxus was free to craft a new sigil.\nThe Unseen Guests.\nIn response to incursions from dreadlord infiltrators, the Primus dispatched you to Revendreth in search of a potential ally: the Stonewright.\nThere it was discovered that the dreadlords re-infiltrated their old home to rescue Sire Denathrius from his prison. Though the dreadlords succeeded, the Stonewright pledged her Stone Legion to Korthia's efforts. Revendreth was now free to craft a new sigil.\nThe Power of Night.\nYou were summoned to Ardenweald, where you were tasked to hunt down two more former Night Warriors. You met with Huln Highmountain in Maldraxxus and found Khaliiq, and then headed to Revendreth where you found the Stonewright.\nAfter returning to Ardenweald, you participated in a ritual to save Tyrande. The ritual went awry, but higher powers intervened, and Tyrande's power was stabilized. Heart healed, the Winter Queen was able to restore Ardenweald's lost sigil.\nA New Path.\nAfter retrieving a piece of Uther's soul, you helped him come to terms with his memories. Polemarch Adrestes realized restoring the lost Temple of Loyalty was not the correct path for the kyrian.\nAdrestes brought his concerns to the Archon, who agreed that a new path was needed. A new temple, the Temple of Devotion, would take the place of Loyalty. Once dedicated, Adrestes would become its paragon.\nYou traveled to the Temple of Loyalty, where the abandoned Forsworn had collected. After persuading the Forsworn to follow a new path of unity, the temple was re-dedicated. With the power of all five paragons, a new sigil of the kyrian covenant was forged.\nWhat Lies Ahead.\nThe Jailer expanded the Maw to envelop Oribos, merging with the Arbiter and claiming the final sigil. He opened a gateway to the mysterious Sepulcher and escaped. Back in Korthia, the Primus revealed that Zovaal was once the Arbiter, but was stripped of his power and cast into the Maw.\nAt the climax of the battle within Torghast, Sylvanas Windrunner defied the Jailer when he threatened to dominate all of reality. In response, he infused her with a soul crystal that left her incapacitated. Bolvar Fordragon ordered her imprisonment and intends to learn all she knows about the Jailer's schemes.\nAnduin Wrynn remained dominated by the Jailer's will, but was able to leave behind a final farewell to his friends and allies. Jaina Proudmoore vowed to free the young king from his captivity before it's too late.\nAlthough the Primus now possesses reforged sigils from the covenants, he must find a way to replace the Arbiter's sigil before he can open another gateway to pursue the Jailer. In the meantime, he has tasked you with continuing to defend the Shadowlands against the Mawsworn.\nSecrets of the First Ones.\nWith the help of &lt;a href=\"Tal-Inara\"&gt;Tal-Inara&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Overseer%20Kah-Delen\"&gt;Kah-Delen&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Overseer%20Kah-Sher\"&gt;Kah-Sher&lt;/a&gt;, the new Arbiter's sigil is formed. Used together with the sigils collected from the other covenants, a gateway to Zereth Mortis is opened.\nA One-Way Trip.\nYou have been tasked to go through the gateway--but &lt;a href=\"Pelagos\"&gt;Pelagos&lt;/a&gt; unexpectedly offers to go with you. As you prepare to leave, a &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; reveals themselves and orders a Mawsworn ambush.\nYou manage to make your way through the portal just before it is destroyed, leaving you and Pelagos to explore this strange new land with no way to return home. While exploring, you encounter &lt;a href=\"Firim\"&gt;Firim&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"broker\"&gt;broker&lt;/a&gt; who is willing to help you in return for aid. He leads you to the village of &lt;a href=\"Haven\"&gt;Haven&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn Haven, you assist the Enlightened in defending the small village from the Mawsworn. After you have earned their trust, the Enlightened open an &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Waystone\"&gt;ancient gateway&lt;/a&gt; back to Oribos, allowing you to return and bring back Bolvar's expeditionary forces.\nIn Search of Answers.\nThe Mawsworn have concentrated their efforts on the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Afterlives\"&gt;Forge of Afterlives&lt;/a&gt;. Bolvar tasks you to investigate with &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt;.\nYou discover that the Jailer is dominating &lt;a href=\"automa\"&gt;automa&lt;/a&gt; to open the way to the &lt;a href=\"Sepulcher%20of%20the%20First%20Ones\"&gt;Sepulcher of the First Ones&lt;/a&gt;. Armed with this knowledge, you attempt to halt his progress, and uncover the dreadlord infiltrators among your forces--including their leader, &lt;a href=\"Mal%27Ganis\"&gt;Mal'ganis&lt;/a&gt;.\nMal'ganis reveals that Anduin is about to open the way to the Sepulcher. You rush to stop him with the help of Jaina and Baine. However, you are unable to stop the Jailer from entering the Sepulcher and taking Anduin with him.\nCryptic Warnings.\nPelagos has discovered that &lt;a href=\"devourer\"&gt;devourer&lt;/a&gt;s have entered Zereth Mortis and threaten Haven. When the two of you go to assess the danger, you discover &lt;a href=\"Saezurah\"&gt;an oracle&lt;/a&gt; who delivers a cryptic warning before falling comatose.\nYou decide to take the oracle to Firim and ask for his assistance. An automa core that Firim obtained has an unusual reaction to the oracle. Firim tasks you with using the core, called &lt;a href=\"Pocopoc\"&gt;Pocopoc&lt;/a&gt;, to unravel the secrets of the &lt;a href=\"Cypher%20of%20the%20First%20Ones\"&gt;Cyphers of the First Ones&lt;/a&gt;.\nEntering the Sepulcher.\n&lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther&lt;/a&gt; has come to you with important news that will grant insight into the Jailer's methods: Sylvanas has awakened.\nBolvar wishes to concentrate efforts on finding a way into the Sepulcher of the First Ones, in order to pursue and defeat the Jailer once and for all.\nWhen the way to the Sepulcher of the First Ones is at last opened, Uther convinces the others to accept Sylvanas's help in freeing Anduin from the Jailer's clutches.\nThe Primus concludes that his theory was correct. However, mortals are not automa--more is required to forge some kind of assistance. The Primus suggests that the answer may lie in the memories of those who have previously been dominated. You help Bolvar, Darion, Anduin, and Sylvanas delve into their memories, and retrieve essences of Defiance before returning to the Primus.\nThe Primus combines the essences of Defiance, the cyphers, and the remains of the Helm of Domination, forging a new creation: the &lt;a href=\"Crown%20of%20Wills\"&gt;Crown of Wills&lt;/a&gt;. He presents the Crown to Bolvar, and you are tasked with entering the Sepulcher of the First Ones once more--this time, to defeat the Jailer.\nThe Oracle's Plan.\nYou receive word that something unexpected is happening with Firim. When you arrive, you discover that the oracle you rescued has awakened. The oracle--&lt;a href=\"Saezurah\"&gt;Saezurah&lt;/a&gt;--speaks through Pocopoc, and asks you to follow Pocopoc to the &lt;a href=\"Resonant%20Peaks\"&gt;Resonant Peaks&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Resonant Peaks have been overrun by devourers that are consuming whatever magic they can find. Saezurah tasks you with gathering magic from the devourers and traversing the peaks to reach a vault at the summit. The vault contains the dormant &lt;a href=\"vessel\"&gt;vessel&lt;/a&gt; of an &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20One\"&gt;Eternal One&lt;/a&gt;. Together with Pocopoc, you fend off a swarm of devourers until you return to &lt;a href=\"Exile%27s%20Hollow\"&gt;Exile's Hollow&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpon your return, the progenitor magic you gathered is passed from Pocopoc to Saezurah, who then becomes fully active. Saezurah thanks you, and explains that the vessel you've recovered isn't just a vessel. It will serve as the body for a newly created &lt;a href=\"Arbiter%20%28title%29\"&gt;Arbiter&lt;/a&gt; for the Shadowlands. Saezurah will reach out to you once it is done preparing the vessel for the ritual.\nThe Purpose.\nSaezurah contacts you, having completed preparing the vessel for the ritual. You are tasked with gathering reinforcements from the covenant forces in order to make your way to the &lt;a href=\"Crypts%20of%20the%20Eternal\"&gt;Crypts of the Eternal&lt;/a&gt;, where the ritual will take place.\nAlthough heavily guarded by Mawsworn, you and your covenant reinforcements are able to battle your way through and enter the Crypts of the Eternal. Although all seems to be going according to plan, dreadlord interference causes the ritual to go awry. The vessel is left empty, and your efforts appear to be in vain.\nIn the absence of a soul to inhabit the vessel, Pelagos offers his own in service of the Shadowlands. Kleia attempts to protest, but he is resolute--this is the path he was destined to walk. Saezurah places his soul within the dormant vessel and Pelagos is reborn--not as a &lt;a href=\"kyrian\"&gt;kyrian&lt;/a&gt;, but as the new Arbiter. After exchanging goodbyes, Pelagos takes his place in Oribos."}

Tyrande at first did not approve of the mission, but after she received a vision in which she saw a light that needed to be defended, she appointed &lt;a href=\"Lyalia\"&gt;Lyalia&lt;/a&gt; to lead &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt; and accompany Vaeldrin into the new-found continent.

She is one of the very few female soldiers and has worked very hard to gain what she has attained. She is one of Lady &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;'s most trusted soldiers and Proudmoore frequently makes good use of Lorena's military leadership abilities. She is utterly loyal to Jaina.\nBiography.\nLorena originally came from &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; where she grew up with her father and nine brothers. All of them were soldiers, and despite being a girl Lorena wanted nothing more than to be one too. She was so skilled that her father sponsored her application to join the &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20City%20Guard\"&gt;Kul Tiras City Guard&lt;/a&gt;. At Kul Tiras, she guarded a keep. After the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, Lorena was promoted to colonel by Jaina herself.\nLorena was sent by Jaina to &lt;a href=\"Northwatch\"&gt;Northwatch&lt;/a&gt; in order to find out why an &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; ship did not help an orcish ship when it was attacked by pirates. As she and her army (&lt;a href=\"Strov\"&gt;Strov&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Clai\"&gt;Clai&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jalod\"&gt;Jalod&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Paolo\"&gt;Paolo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mal%20%28Cycle%20of%20Hatred%29\"&gt;Mal&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ian%20%28human%29\"&gt;Ian&lt;/a&gt;) were returning to Theramore, they were attacked by orcish members of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Blade%20clan\"&gt;Burning Blade clan&lt;/a&gt;. Though Ian was killed and Mal injured, they returned to Jaina and reported what had happened.\nLorena sent Strov to find a Burning Blade &lt;a href=\"Margoz%20%28human%29\"&gt;recruiter&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Demonsbane%20Inn\"&gt;Demonsbane Inn&lt;/a&gt;, but when he did not report back Lorena asked &lt;a href=\"Kristoff%20%28human%29\"&gt;Kristoff&lt;/a&gt;, who was acting Chamberlain in Jaina's absence, to search for him. Instead, Kristoff sent an army to reinforce &lt;a href=\"Northwatch\"&gt;Northwatch&lt;/a&gt;, an act that would seem aggressive to the Horde, and insisted Lorena depart immediately by airship to lead them. She named &lt;a href=\"Bek\"&gt;Bek&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Harcort\"&gt;Harcort&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mirra\"&gt;Mirra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Noroj\"&gt;Noroj&lt;/a&gt; and the magic-sensitive &lt;a href=\"Booraven\"&gt;Booraven&lt;/a&gt; as her senior officers and instead used Booraven to track Jaina to &lt;a href=\"Bladescar\"&gt;Bladescar&lt;/a&gt;. They found Jaina and &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt; trapped by the demon &lt;a href=\"Zmodlor\"&gt;Zmodlor&lt;/a&gt;'s wards but was able to act as a conduit for Jaina to magical pierce them. Jaina then teleported Aegwynn and Lorena to Theramore, where Jaina revealed Kristoff as a pawn of Zmodlor and killed him.\nOnce Jaina had found Zmodlor's hideout on &lt;a href=\"Dreadmist%20Peak\"&gt;Dreadmist Peak&lt;/a&gt;, Lorena accompanied her and Aegwynn there where they were beset by a horde of &lt;a href=\"grellkin\"&gt;grellkin&lt;/a&gt;. While Lorena fought them off, Aegwynn and Jaina banished &lt;a href=\"Zmodlor\"&gt;Zmodlor&lt;/a&gt; back to the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;. Lorena returned to Theramore, and continued in military matters. She died at some point.\nYears later, Jaina returned to Kul Tiras and met with &lt;a href=\"Tiran%20Blackwood\"&gt;Tiran Blackwood&lt;/a&gt; nearby the &lt;a href=\"flight%20master\"&gt;flight master&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Tradewinds%20Market\"&gt;Tradewinds Market&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Boralus\"&gt;Boralus&lt;/a&gt; to inform him about Lorena's death and pass on a keepsake of hers."}

His kindly demeanor, boundless curiosity and saint-like patience has made him something of an informal ambassador of pandaren culture to the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. While not a fighter, Cho accompanies the players on numerous adventures throughout &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, usually providing lore and background to current situations. He can be found at various locations in &lt;a href=\"Jade%20Forest\"&gt;Jade Forest&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kun-Lai%20Summit\"&gt;Kun-Lai Summit&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href=\"Mogu%27shan%20Vaults\"&gt;Mogu'shan Vaults&lt;/a&gt;. Cho can also be seen during The &lt;a href=\"Wanderer%27s%20Festival\"&gt;Wanderer's Festival&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Turtle%20Beach\"&gt;Turtle Beach&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Krasarang%20Wilds\"&gt;Krasarang Wilds&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile Lorewalker Cho can be long-winded at times, the wisdom he can impart upon those with the patience to listen is valuable. His ever-trusting personality serves as a foil to the wary &lt;a href=\"Taran%20Zhu\"&gt;Taran Zhu&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nMists of Pandaria.\nAs &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, you arrive at a pandaren hut and drink a seemingly alcoholic beverage, and upon doing so you see visions of &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Goldrinn\"&gt;Goldrinn&lt;/a&gt; a.k.a Lo'Gosh, &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin&lt;/a&gt; and surprisingly &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh&lt;/a&gt;. A few moments later, Lorewalker Cho approaches and douses you with water to wake up from his dream brew. He wanted to know why that particular person (Anduin) is here. On hearing this, the Alliance adventurer shows Cho one of three pictures the adventurer hastily draws. The adventurer can show him Prince Anduin Wrynn, something abstract, or something heroic. Cho follows the story of your people closely and states that you all may have more in common than one would think. Lastly, the adventurer feeds Cho's birds, and upon doing so Cho welcomes you with open arms, requesting your aid for many services. Letting him know of Anduin Wrynn, the adventurer must meditate to find where he is. After a successful meditation, it shows the White Pawn being chased by Hozen. Then, you depart to go help Anduin Wrynn and will see Lorewalker Cho later.\nAs &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, you arrive at the &lt;a href=\"hozen\"&gt;hozen&lt;/a&gt; villages and take out Dook Ookem. Shortly afterward, the Hozen flee in fear of the Horde adventurer and Cho jumps down and greets them. Cho says that he saw them in a &lt;a href=\"Hellscream%27s%20Fist\"&gt;Skyship&lt;/a&gt; and has many questions for them. The Horde adventurer then meets Lorewalker Cho again in the &lt;a href=\"Cave%20of%20Words\"&gt;Cave of Words&lt;/a&gt; to speak with him further. First, he tells the Horde adventurers about the &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt;, then you ride with him to talk about who the Lorewalkers are. Cho explains that the Lorewalkers are very similar to historians. Cho and the other Lorewalkers work tirelessly to discover more of the hidden mysteries and lore of Pandaria and its past. In order to do so, he needs information from tablets and scrolls from a place called the &lt;a href=\"Circle%20of%20Bone%20%28Jade%20Forest%29\"&gt;Circle of Bone&lt;/a&gt; in order to enhance his knowledge. The first tablet tells of a Hozen warlord many years ago. The second tablet is researched until a bloodthirsty monster called a &lt;a href=\"Saurok\"&gt;Saurok&lt;/a&gt; appears. Pandaren have been attempting to communicate with these beasts for quite some time, and show no signs of stopping any time soon. At last, Cho wants to know about your people. Heading towards the &lt;a href=\"Circle%20of%20Stone\"&gt;Circle of Stone&lt;/a&gt;, where his Great Grandfather showed Cho of his ancestors, Cho now asks the Horde adventurer to tell their tale. Upon hearing it, Lorewalker Cho is pleased. After all that information is digested, he sends you back with the local hozen at a Hozen Camp for welcoming them to the Horde and will see him later.\nWhen both the Alliance and Horde adventurers reach &lt;a href=\"Dawn%27s%20Blossom\"&gt;Dawn's Blossom&lt;/a&gt;, you find him with Pandaren children. Cho explains that these children are the true heart of the Jade Forest. Cho asks that the adventurer help the people here, and earn a good reputation, become revered by the denizens of Pandaria.\nLater near &lt;a href=\"Emperor%27s%20Omen\"&gt;Emperor's Omen&lt;/a&gt;, you find him with &lt;a href=\"Foreman%20Mann\"&gt;Foreman Mann&lt;/a&gt; and she is worried about her &lt;a href=\"Hao%20Mann\"&gt;husband&lt;/a&gt;. Lorewalker Cho wants us to be introduced to her but is worried about many things. Rescue her husband and she will be most pleased to help in future events.\nBefore preparations for both the Alliance and Horde commence, Cho has found something and wants you to follow him as soon as possible. Leaving your faction behind would cost a lot, but you have little choice but to go anyway. The &lt;a href=\"Cho%20Family%20Heirloom\"&gt;Cho Family Heirloom&lt;/a&gt; is to be used to see the last piece of the puzzle. During the &lt;a href=\"Serpent%27s%20Heart\"&gt;Battle for Serpent's Heart&lt;/a&gt;, it is shown that &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Shaohao\"&gt;Emperor Shaohao&lt;/a&gt;, the last Pandaren Emperor, hid a negative emotion known as Doubt. The &lt;a href=\"Sha%20of%20Doubt\"&gt;Sha of Doubt&lt;/a&gt; then comes before Lorewalker Cho, and Cho becomes horrified of this creature. He said he thought it was just a myth, but it appearing before his very eyes had vanished all doubt he had. Now, the adventurers need to clear the manifestation by using &lt;a href=\"Mishi\"&gt;Mishi&lt;/a&gt; and close the Sha spikes so it can stop creating more Sha. The adventurer then lands near Serpent's Heart and rescues his/her faction companions. Shortly afterward, Cho and &lt;a href=\"Fei\"&gt;Fei&lt;/a&gt; (Yu'lon the Jade Serpent), stand aside from each other, shunned. Talk to the Jade Serpent in regards to going to the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20the%20Four%20Winds\"&gt;Valley of the Four Winds&lt;/a&gt; to find what the adventurer's quest holds.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Kun-Lai%20Summit\"&gt;Kun-Lai Summit&lt;/a&gt;, you get a note from &lt;a href=\"Mishka\"&gt;Mishka&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Shademaster%20Kiryn\"&gt;Shademaster Kiryn&lt;/a&gt; that Cho had seen something in the mountains. You then see him at a &lt;a href=\"Grummle\"&gt;Grummle&lt;/a&gt; camp called &lt;a href=\"One%20Keg\"&gt;One Keg&lt;/a&gt;. He travels to &lt;a href=\"Seeker%27s%20Point\"&gt;Seeker's Point&lt;/a&gt; to obtain &lt;a href=\"The%20Tongue%20of%20Ba-Shon\"&gt;The Tongue of Ba-Shon&lt;/a&gt;, and you stay connected with him via a device and go into every tomb within Kun-Lai to look for clues of where the &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen\"&gt;Thunder King&lt;/a&gt; slept. After hours of searching the tombs, the adventurer did battle with &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari troll&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt;. Later, the adventurer finally discovers the rest of the Thunder King. The tablet reads thus read by Lorewalker Cho:\nCho is surprised at what happens next. A troll named &lt;a href=\"Prophet%20Khar%27zul\"&gt;Prophet Khar'zul&lt;/a&gt; leads a team of Zandalari trolls to take the corpse of Lei Shen out of the tomb, and is planning to resurrect him from the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Reckoning\"&gt;Isle of Reckoning&lt;/a&gt;. Cho sends word to &lt;a href=\"Lin%20Whispercloud\"&gt;Lin Whispercloud&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shin%20Whispercloud\"&gt;Shin Whispercloud&lt;/a&gt; of what's happening near the seas of Kun-Lai and explains that they must be prepared for the incoming massive waves of Mogu and Trolls. It was too late when the adventurers arrive that &lt;a href=\"Zouchin%20Province\"&gt;Zouchin Province&lt;/a&gt;, as it was already reduced to smoke and ash. The assault had begun. The adventurers and Lorewalker Cho were aware of the situation at hand, but not Lin Whispercloud, Shin Whispercloud and others in the town. Continuous waves of Trolls poured in, keeping the adventurers busy and distracted while the ritual resurrecting Lei Shen was in progress. Hours after the assault, Cho captured a &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Prisoner\"&gt;Zandalari Prisoner&lt;/a&gt;. They persuaded him for hours until Lorewalker Cho informed the adventurers of the devolving situation. They returned upstairs and persuaded the prisoner together. Unfortunately, Ii was too late, and the prisoner told them that the Thunder King was successfully resurrected by the troll prophets. The adventurers were left with no choice, they must engage the Isle of Reckoning regardless, and slay them all so that nothing more foul is brought back into the world. The aftermath of Lei Shen was another problem to be dealt with for another time.\nAt last, Lorewalker Cho returns to his home/library, and this is where he can permanently be found at the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt;, known as the &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20Knowledge\"&gt;Seat of Knowledge&lt;/a&gt;. Speak with him of anything particular like knowing more of &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;. Though he yet wonders why &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; is present.\nHe may oftentimes be seen at &lt;a href=\"Halfhill%20Market\"&gt;Halfhill Market&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20the%20Four%20Winds\"&gt;Valley of the Four Winds&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Thunder King.\nHe shares stories of &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen\"&gt;Lei Shen&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari troll&lt;/a&gt;s and the &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; origins. He is also seen in the faction-specific scenarios explaining the adventurers why they are there.\nEscalation.\nThe lorewalker wants to know what's happening and understand what's going on. He invites the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; to look into a &lt;a href=\"Blood%20in%20the%20Snow\"&gt;recent activity in Dun Morogh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Heart%20of%20Pandaria\"&gt;what's happening in the Vale&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Rebellion\"&gt;what's to come&lt;/a&gt;. He wishes he could see everything to the end, but said he's a \"storyteller\".\nSiege of Orgrimmar.\nCho traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Timeless%20Isle\"&gt;Timeless Isle&lt;/a&gt; meeting with &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kairoz\"&gt;Kairoz&lt;/a&gt;. After Wrathion is ready to grant the adventurer his final reward, Cho and Wrathion traveled back to the Seat where they narrated the final story about the adventurer. Cho was uneasy about what way Wrathion's part of the story is was heading. Cho is also part of the &lt;a href=\"Celestial%20Tournament\"&gt;Celestial Tournament&lt;/a&gt; with his companions - &lt;a href=\"Knowledge\"&gt;Knowledge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Patience\"&gt;Patience&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wisdom%20%28NPC%29\"&gt;Wisdom&lt;/a&gt;.\nCho is also present in the Vale of Eternal Sorrow's part of the Siege of Orgrimmar, commenting on &lt;a href=\"Immerseus\"&gt;Immerseus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Fallen%20Protectors\"&gt;The Fallen Protectors&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Norushen\"&gt;Norushen&lt;/a&gt;. He then found wounded Taran Zhu and brought him to safety for recuperation. After the fall of Sha of Pride, Cho returned with &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;. He ultimately witnessed the aftermath of the Siege, where Taran Zhu takes Garrosh to Pandaria for a trial. Cho commented that the adventurers freed Pandaria from the grasp of Sha, something that even titans and mogu could not do.\nAfter this, he witnessed the ghost of &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Shaohao\"&gt;Emperor Shaohao&lt;/a&gt; plant a new tree beginning with the healing of the Vale.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nCho traveled to &lt;a href=\"Lunarfall%20Inn\"&gt;Lunarfall Inn&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=\"Frostwall%20Tavern\"&gt;Frostwall Tavern&lt;/a&gt; on because he thinks the titans had visited this world too. He starts &lt;a href=\"Titanic%20Evolution\"&gt;Titanic Evolution&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lessons%20of%20the%20Past\"&gt;Lessons of the Past&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nCho serves as the &lt;a href=\"artifact\"&gt;artifact&lt;/a&gt; researcher for monks of the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Broken%20Temple\"&gt;Order of the Broken Temple&lt;/a&gt;, providing increased Artifact Power gain and background lore on the weapons in exchange for order hall resources.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nDuring his journey to craft &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Mental%20Clarity\"&gt;a potion&lt;/a&gt; that could cleanse someone of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s' corruption, &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt; made acquaintance with the Lorewalkers. In his journal, he mentioned that the sheer volume of knowledge to be found within their scrolls was marvelous to behold. Lorewalker Cho notably taught him much about the legends of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Empire\"&gt;Black Empire&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpon discovering that a friendly group of mogu existed, &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; and the adventurer traveled to Cho at the Seat of Knowledge and sought his help to identify the clan. Cho figured out that they were the &lt;a href=\"Rajani\"&gt;Rajani&lt;/a&gt;, servants of &lt;a href=\"Ra\"&gt;Highkeeper Ra&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt; freed, the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Empire\"&gt;Black Empire&lt;/a&gt; began to assault the Vale of Eternal Blossoms. Cho asked adventurers to defend the Vale.\nQuests.\nKun-Lai Summit.\nLorewalker Cho (or the &lt;a href=\"Image%20of%20Lorewalker%20Cho\"&gt;Image of Lorewalker Cho&lt;/a&gt;) is involved in the Raising the Thunder King storyline.\nLetters.\nCho sends a letter entitled \"A Well-Deserved Accomplishment\" to all players who reach level 90.

Aware of the invaders' presence, Shuchun was determined to stop their aggressive actions. She encountered them on the northern coast of Pandaria and stated her intention in order to \"peacefully\" resolve the problem. She later revealed the &lt;a href=\"lorevault\"&gt;lorevault&lt;/a&gt; nearby to Gallywix's two subjects, &lt;a href=\"Ziya\"&gt;Ziya&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Druz\"&gt;Druz&lt;/a&gt;. The goblins wanted to enter the vault and claim the artifacts stored within, yet Shuchun would not allow them to do so. But as she understood that the two goblins would be lost to the defense mechanism of the Lorevault, she decided to take them inside and endeavor to convince them that whatever they were doing, was a mistake.\nAs they faced various challenges based on &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; legends within the vault, Druz and Ziya argued over the purpose of the war against the Alliance, the true nature of Trade Prince Gallywix, and the danger of seeking simple answers to complex problems, eventually realizing that their arguments were actually creating the traps. The source of these creations turned out to be a dangerous pandaren artifact: &lt;a href=\"The%20Blank%20Scroll%20%28item%29\"&gt;the Blank Scroll&lt;/a&gt;. Druz and Ziya attempted to claim the artifact, but after realizing her own warning was going unheeded, Lorewalker Shuchun activated the scroll and had the goblins live a vision of a terrible future:\n\"Recognizing that the scroll could be used as a horribly dangerous weapon if people knew about it, Gallywix quietly hid it away from the world in the lower vault of &lt;a href=\"Gallywix%20Pleasure%20Palace\"&gt;his pleasure palace&lt;/a&gt;, but word eventually got out, as it always does, with the assumption that he had kept a powerful weapon for himself. The Bilgewater Cartel are declared traitors by Warchief &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; for hiding it from him as he assumes they mean to rebel, and leads the Horde to destroy &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Harbor\"&gt;Bilgewater Harbor&lt;/a&gt; before assaulting the palace vaults and claiming the scroll for himself. With the power of the scroll giving him an unkillable legion of orcs that could be summoned at any time, the &lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt; are wiped off the map; appalled, the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear tribe&lt;/a&gt; fled to the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;, where they, the surviving Bilgewater goblins and the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; join forces with the Alliance. Druz and Ziya, acknowledging that it was their actions and their fault that things had come to this, survive long enough to be part of a hopeless last stand at &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; which is destroyed by Garrosh's orcs, but they only rule the world until Azeroth itself was devastated after the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; reclaim the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; and horrors rise from the sea with no one to oppose them. The planet is burned to a lifeless hunk of rock.\"\nStunned by what they had seen, Druz decided to leave the Blank Scroll in Shuchun's paws to hide it somewhere safe elsewhere and assigned Ziya as her escort (officially, taking time off with pay). She promised Druz that the Blank Scroll would be hidden in a safe place before bidding him farewell and starting off with Ziya on their long journey."}

He must find a balance between the two to set his soul free.\"\nThe Champion of the Five Suns.\n\"In the days of old, five suns burned brightly in the sky. Great fires would sweep through the lands of Pandaria until the day that Zao Sunseeker shot a defiant arrow into the sky, bringing down 4 of the 5 suns.\"\nStage One: Extinguishing the Suns.\nPlayers must extinguish the suns from the sky. Defeating each Sun causes Haunting Sha to appear and attack Zao Sunseeker and the players.\nStage Two: The Sunseeker's Corruption!\nThe Haunting Sha have now possessed Zao Sunseeker. You must now defeat him to cleanse his corruption.\nStrategy.\nThe Trial of the Yaungol.\nThis encounter involves two bosses at once.\nThe tank needs to keep aggro on both Strife and Peril. Since they do not move, this involves running between the bosses and using AoE abilities such as &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Clap\"&gt;Thunder Clap&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hammer%20of%20the%20Righteous\"&gt;Hammer of the Righteous&lt;/a&gt;. They hit hard by 5-player boss standards, so be prepared to blow cooldowns on mitigation abilities such as &lt;a href=\"Shield%20Wall\"&gt;Shield Wall&lt;/a&gt;.\nFor damage dealers, the official intent for the encounter seems to be watching for the stacks of Intensity and periodically switching between the bosses when the stacks get too high (for example, above 6). Switch immediately if your target gets the Intensity debuff. However, it is sometimes easier (especially in overgeared groups) to just focus on one boss and ignore the other until the first one is dead, simply waiting out the 15-second immunity to damage.\nThe Champion of the Five Suns.\nZao Sunseeker is a figure from a Pandaren tale who sought to destroy the Five Suns that were causing drought and havoc for the people. The story is brought to life by the Sha and players fight alongside Zao to defeat four of the suns. Upon defeating each sun, it shows its true form - &lt;a href=\"sha\"&gt;sha&lt;/a&gt;. After you defeat four of the sha, they infest Zao with the negative emotion they embody. Players are then forced to kill Zao."}

During the Second War, Remka disguised herself as a male to join the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; army so she could avenge the killing of her family and the sacking of her &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt;. Her deception was discovered, and her commander placed her at the front lines hoping she would be killed (to spare himself the trouble of reporting her). She survived, however, and took great pleasure in killing orcs in combat \u2014 even going so far as to cover her face with their blood to mark her victory.\nRemka apparently enjoyed as much luxury as she was able while in command of her internment camp \u2014 even using a female orc slave named &lt;a href=\"Greekik\"&gt;Greekik&lt;/a&gt; as one of her servants. When &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; was captured and held there, word reached &lt;a href=\"Aedelas%20Blackmoore\"&gt;Aedelas Blackmoore&lt;/a&gt;, master of the internment camps, at his fortress of &lt;a href=\"Durnholde%20Keep\"&gt;Durnholde Keep&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 and he immediately traveled to the encampment to retrieve his \"pet orc\". However, Remka's orc servant warned Thrall of Blackmoore's arrival and the future &lt;a href=\"warchief\"&gt;warchief&lt;/a&gt; took the opportunity to escape from Remka's camp.\nUpon realizing that Thrall had been there, but had managed to escape, Blackmoore demoted Remka and placed one of her lieutenants, &lt;a href=\"Waryk\"&gt;Waryk&lt;/a&gt;, in command of the camp.\nHer status is unknown."}

After the retaking of &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20City\"&gt;Gilneas City&lt;/a&gt;, she joined her father as commander of the &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20Liberation%20Front\"&gt;Gilneas Liberation Front&lt;/a&gt;. When the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; returned to assault Azeroth, Lorna and Darius joined Genn Greymane on the \"&lt;a href=\"Skyfire\"&gt;Skyfire&lt;/a&gt;\" as part of his army forces.\nBackground.\nFall of Gilneas.\nThe day of the &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; attack on Gilneas City, Lorna saved a worgen adventurer by shooting &lt;a href=\"Josiah%20Avery\"&gt;Josiah Avery&lt;/a&gt;. The two of them worked together to get the &lt;a href=\"Northgate%20rebels\"&gt;Northgate rebels&lt;/a&gt;' hidden arsenal for Greymane's army.\nShortly after, she met with &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;King Genn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Liam%20Greymane\"&gt;Prince Liam&lt;/a&gt; after her father chose to stay behind in the &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Dawn%20Cathedral\"&gt;Light's Dawn Cathedral&lt;/a&gt; and make a &lt;a href=\"Last%20Stand%20%28quest%29\"&gt;last stand&lt;/a&gt; against the worgen. She had received word her father was free, but Liam told her about the choice Darius made. Lorna pulled out her gun and took aim at Genn, cursing at him and believing this was his idea of revenge after the &lt;a href=\"Northgate%20Rebellion\"&gt;Northgate Rebellion&lt;/a&gt;. Liam restrained her, and a hysterical Lorna demanded she be let go to die with her father before she began to cry in Liam's arms. Afterward she returned to the &lt;a href=\"Crowley%20Orchard\"&gt;Crowley Orchard&lt;/a&gt; and lived as a hermit. Before being evacuated, she and the worgen adventurer worked together to rescue some horses. She then moved to the &lt;a href=\"Greymane%20Manor\"&gt;Greymane Manor&lt;/a&gt; and from there she took a carriage with &lt;a href=\"Gwen%20Armstead\"&gt;Gwen Armstead&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Stormglen\"&gt;Stormglen&lt;/a&gt; where she found a diary of &lt;a href=\"Bradshaw\"&gt;Bradshaw&lt;/a&gt; and learned that the man ventured into &lt;a href=\"Blackwald\"&gt;Blackwald&lt;/a&gt;. She sent him there only to find the night elf &lt;a href=\"Belysra%20Starbreeze\"&gt;Belysra Starbreeze&lt;/a&gt; along with other worgen. Darius was revealed to have had survived and become a worgen. He was worried how Lorna would respond to his curse, but she was fine with it.\nShe was then sent to &lt;a href=\"Livery%20Outpost\"&gt;Livery Outpost&lt;/a&gt; to rescue the villagers from northern Gilneas and free &lt;a href=\"Emberstone%20Village\"&gt;Emberstone Village&lt;/a&gt;. Lorna then aided the &lt;a href=\"Worgen%20%28playable%29\"&gt;Worgen adventurers&lt;/a&gt; in retaking Gilneas City after the first assault of the Forsaken. After the death of Liam, she learned that the Forsaken were going to use the plague on the city. She was present at Liam's funeral in &lt;a href=\"Aderic%27s%20Repose\"&gt;Aderic's Repose&lt;/a&gt;. After that she moved to &lt;a href=\"Keel%20Harbor\"&gt;Keel Harbor&lt;/a&gt; and loaded explosives onto an &lt;a href=\"Gunship\"&gt;Orc Gunship&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Endgame%20%28quest%29\"&gt;used it as a ram&lt;/a&gt; to destroy the Forsaken forward camp next to the &lt;a href=\"Greymane%20Wall\"&gt;Greymane Wall&lt;/a&gt;.\nGilneas Liberation Front.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Gilneas\"&gt;invasion of Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;, Lorna joined her father as commander of the &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20Liberation%20Front\"&gt;Gilneas Liberation Front&lt;/a&gt; and fought with the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; to retake the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Gilneas\"&gt;Ruins of Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; from the Forsaken. She attacked the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken%20Forward%20Command\"&gt;Forsaken Forward Command&lt;/a&gt; as she used &lt;a href=\"Forsaken%20Communication%20Device\"&gt;Forsaken Communication Device&lt;/a&gt; to declare that the Alliance once again controlled Gilneas and their forces would soon arrive to kill those that would not surrender. However, while stationed in &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt; she was captured by the now-&lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Vincent%20Godfrey\"&gt;Lord Godfrey&lt;/a&gt;. Lorna served as the bargaining chip in the surrender of the Gilneas Liberation Front as &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas&lt;/a&gt; gave Darius two choices; surrender or have Lorna turned into a member of the Forsaken. Darius, unwilling to allow such a fate to befall his daughter, agreed to the surrender, and Sylvanas allowed them to retreat towards the still contested territory of Gilneas.\nLegion.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for the Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, Lorna and her father Darius joined &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; on the \"&lt;a href=\"Skyfire\"&gt;Skyfire&lt;/a&gt;\". Lorna and &lt;a href=\"Tess%20Greymane\"&gt;Princess Tess&lt;/a&gt; escorted the adventurer to the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt;, conversing on the way. When flying to Stormwind Keep, Princess Tess Greymane confided to Lorna her concern about the lust for vengeance consuming her father. Lorna states that all Gilneans suffer from that rage, her father more than most. Though Tess concurs with Lorna, she fears more deaths are sure to come. Lorna grimly replies that such is the cost of vengeance and that Gilneas has waited for it long enough. When arriving at Stormwind Keep, Tess tells the adventurer to give King &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin&lt;/a&gt; their condolences for the death of his father &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;. The two quickly return to the gunship once the player lands, as they are needed back at the ship.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20Brigade\"&gt;Gilneas Brigade&lt;/a&gt; led by Lorna and her father Darius established &lt;a href=\"Greywatch\"&gt;Greywatch&lt;/a&gt; to secure &lt;a href=\"Stormheim\"&gt;Stormheim&lt;/a&gt; from threats.\nDuring the Skyfire's assault on Sylvanas Windrunner's fleet, Lorna led the Alliance boarding party in scouring Windrunner's ships in their search for the Banshee Queen. After discovering that Sylvanas traveled to &lt;a href=\"Stormheim\"&gt;Stormheim&lt;/a&gt; ahead of the fleet and that the Horde was planning on infiltrating the Skyfire, Lorna and her soldiers went back to the Skyfire to defend the ship. Unfortunately, the Horde succeded in setting fire to the Skyfire's ammunition and its explosions caused the Skyfire to crash and burn on Stormheim. Though the crew of the Skyfire was able to evacuate before the crash, the gunship was utterly destroyed.\nLorna regrouped with her Gilneas Brigade compatriots and acted as leader of Greymane's scouts in &lt;a href=\"Lorna%27s%20Watch\"&gt;Lorna's Watch&lt;/a&gt;. Lorna and her Gilneas Brigade scouts would aid Greymane's mercenaries in undergoing the various ancient trials necessary to obtain the &lt;a href=\"Aegis%20of%20Aggramar\"&gt;Aegis of Aggramar&lt;/a&gt;. Following a lead on Sylvanas, Lorna would scout &lt;a href=\"Skold-Ashil\"&gt;Skold-Ashil&lt;/a&gt; on Greymane's orders to uncover what Sylvanas seeks there. Lorna discovers that Sylvanas means to undergo the rituals of ascension to be granted an audience with &lt;a href=\"Eyir\"&gt;Eyir&lt;/a&gt; so that she could subjugate her and create more &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt;. Lorna sends news of her findings to Genn so that he could confront Sylvanas personally and undermine her plot. Greymane succeeded in freeing Eyir and Lorna recovers a poisoned Genn and treats him back at Greywatch.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nLorna was present at the war council in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt;. She later participated in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Darkshore\"&gt;Battle for Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;.\nLorna followed her king when they were tasked into assaulting &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Talon%20Gate\"&gt;western gate&lt;/a&gt; while &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;'s forces assaulted the &lt;a href=\"Gates%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;main gates&lt;/a&gt;.

The forces of &lt;a href=\"Neferset\"&gt;Neferset&lt;/a&gt; here are led by the mighty &lt;a href=\"djinn\"&gt;djinn&lt;/a&gt; - .\nThe instance line is at the lost city's northernmost point of in the &lt;a href=\"Vir%27naal%20River%20Delta\"&gt;Vir'naal River Delta&lt;/a&gt; of south-central Uldum.\nBackground.\nAfter regaining their ancient forms in a dark bargain with &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; and his forces, the stone-skinned &lt;a href=\"tol%27vir\"&gt;tol'vir&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Neferset\"&gt;Neferset&lt;/a&gt; have retreated to their former seat of power - the \"Lost City\" of the &lt;a href=\"Vir%27naal%20River%20Delta\"&gt;Vir'naal River Delta&lt;/a&gt;, where they menace all of &lt;a href=\"Uldum\"&gt;Uldum&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe lost city is eminently defensible - bordered by &lt;a href=\"crocolisk\"&gt;crocolisk&lt;/a&gt;-infested marshes and surrounded by mountain peaks, it would prove difficult to invade even without the defending army. Worse, the Neferset are led by the being responsible for their newfound power - &lt;a href=\"Siamat\"&gt;Siamat&lt;/a&gt;, the Lord of the South Wind and one of the mightiest servants of &lt;a href=\"Al%27Akir\"&gt;Al'Akir&lt;/a&gt; and Deathwing. Though he is a mighty foe and unshakable general, Siamat's presence is also an opportunity. After invoking immense forces to strengthen and corrupt the Neferset tol'vir, his full powers are beyond him for the moment. A small group of truly powerful heroes might be able to infiltrate the city, and attack the Lord of the South Wind, striking a blow from which even the elemental cannot recover.\nAfter the defeat of the Neferset, the Lost City became inhabited by the &lt;a href=\"Ramkahen%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Ramkahen&lt;/a&gt; tribe. During the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Empire\"&gt;Black Empire&lt;/a&gt;'s assault on Udlum, the &lt;a href=\"Ramkahen%20Citizen\"&gt;Ramkahen Citizen&lt;/a&gt;s in the city were taken captive.\nDungeon Jornal.\n\"The Lost City of the Tol'vir is the stronghold of the Neferset, a faction of the cat-like tol'vir who swore fealty to Deathwing in exchange for a cure to the curse of flesh which had turned their rocky hides to soft skin. With the affliction expunged the tol'vir have rebelled against their benefactor, although they remain irrevocably twisted and hostile due to the dark pact that they made\"\nGeography.\nThe Lost City of the Tol'vir is located west of both &lt;a href=\"Vortex%20Pinnacle\"&gt;Vortex Pinnacle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Origination\"&gt;Halls of Origination&lt;/a&gt; in the south portion of the river that bisects the zone. The entrance to the Lost City is at the far northern part of the subzone.\nQuests.\nThe following quests are offered by just inside the instance:\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

The undead sent by the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; to take the red crystal are now wandering aimlessly."}

They have devolved further than the &lt;a href=\"Broken\"&gt;Broken&lt;/a&gt; and many have been reduced to savage and primitive beasts.\nIt is hinted that the name was given to them by the draenei in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, long before they came to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, because it was believed that their minds had become \"lost\". Despite having devolved and being nicknamed \"lost ones\" they may still be referred to as draenei.\nHistory.\nFall of Draenor.\nThe &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; that originated on the world of &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt; moved to the world they called &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; and began living among the races of that world. The draenei lived alongside the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s for several generations. However, when the &lt;a href=\"Clan%23Orcish%20clan%20system\"&gt;orc clans&lt;/a&gt; of Draenor became the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; at the behest of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, their blades were first whetted on the peaceful draenei. Nearly the entire race was eradicated by the massacre.\nSoon after, the &lt;a href=\"red%20mist\"&gt;demonic energies&lt;/a&gt; that now seethed through Draenor began to corrupt and twist many of the surviving draenei, turning them into &lt;a href=\"Broken\"&gt;Broken&lt;/a&gt; and for some of them eventually into a more primitive stage known as the Lost Ones.\nBefore Draenor exploded and crumbled into what is now known as &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, several Broken and Lost Ones managed to cross the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; toward &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the Portal closed down, regret and fear seized many of the Broken who had left their homeworld and were left weakened by the rigors of their journey. In their despair, they cursed the name of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; and sank into violence and hatred, becoming little more than &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Ones%20%28organization%29\"&gt;mindless monsters&lt;/a&gt;.\nThird War.\nSeveral groups of draenei, Broken and Lost Ones managed to survive the destruction of Draenor. While the draenei of &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt; managed to hide at the monastery of &lt;a href=\"Telredor\"&gt;Telredor&lt;/a&gt;, the Broken and Lost Ones were hunted down to the brink of extinction by &lt;a href=\"Magtheridon%27s%20Forces\"&gt;the armies of Magtheridon&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; overlord in Outland. &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; promised to rid the mutated draenei of their ancient enemies in exchange for their loyalty.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Broken%20exiles\"&gt;Broken exiles&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Magtoor\"&gt;Magtoor&lt;/a&gt; who had founded the &lt;a href=\"Harborage\"&gt;Harborage&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20of%20Sorrows\"&gt;Swamp of Sorrows&lt;/a&gt; were now in open conflict with the &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Ones%20%28organization%29\"&gt;Lost Ones&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Fallow%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Fallow Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Noboru\"&gt;Noboru&lt;/a&gt; and his gang were a terror to the Broken, wandering the swamps and killing any who crossed their path.\nOther Lost Ones like &lt;a href=\"Kum%27isha%20the%20Collector\"&gt;Kum'isha the Collector&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Draenei%20Refugee\"&gt;refugees&lt;/a&gt; had decided to stay in the &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt; instead.

The precious &lt;a href=\"draenethyst\"&gt;draenethyst&lt;/a&gt; shards were rumored to be able to open a rift, a feat that Kum'isha eventually &lt;a href=\"To%20Serve%20Kum%27isha%20%28quest%29\"&gt;managed&lt;/a&gt; with the help of &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s when brought a &lt;a href=\"Flawless%20Draenethyst%20Sphere\"&gt;Flawless Draenethyst Sphere&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; reopened, the armies of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; traveled to &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; and saw that several Broken and Lost One tribes were now serving among the &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt;. Some Lost One tribes remain independent but became savage and hostile.\nThe &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; of the Alliance attempted to reconnect with the &lt;a href=\"Feralfen%20tribe\"&gt;Feralfen&lt;/a&gt; Lost Ones in the &lt;a href=\"Boha%27mu%20Ruins\"&gt;Boha'mu Ruins&lt;/a&gt;, but the Feralfen refused to re-assimilate with draenei society and seem to resent the draenei for neglecting them and patronizing them with offers of redemption.\nNevertheless, not all lost ones are hostile, in &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt; there are several friendly &lt;a href=\"Lost%20One%20Refugee\"&gt;Lost One Refugee&lt;/a&gt; living in the &lt;a href=\"Lower%20City\"&gt;Lower City&lt;/a&gt;\nThe remaining &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Ones%20%28organization%29\"&gt;Lost Ones&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Fallow%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Fallow Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; grow more corrupt by the day, and as they die off, they have begun to kidnap from the &lt;a href=\"Harborage\"&gt;Harborage&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Cersei%20Dusksinger\"&gt;Cersei Dusksinger&lt;/a&gt; had also been working on a weapon to one day use against the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;. Part of her research included experimenting on the Lost Ones in the &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20of%20Sorrows\"&gt;Swamp of Sorrows&lt;/a&gt; and tricking them into eating cursed livestock tainted by &lt;a href=\"%3AFel-Tainted%20Morsels\"&gt;:Fel-Tainted Morsels&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the Draenei &lt;a href=\"heritage%20armor\"&gt;heritage armor&lt;/a&gt; quest we can see &lt;a href=\"Kum%27isha%20the%20Collector\"&gt;Kum'isha the Collector&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Kuruti\"&gt;Elder Kuruti&lt;/a&gt; (no longer hostile) speaking with other characters throughout the tishamaat celebration in the Exodar, like &lt;a href=\"Iorioa\"&gt;Iorioa&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Hamanar\"&gt;Hamanar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Corki\"&gt;Corki&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Anchorite%20Avuun\"&gt;Anchorite Avuun&lt;/a&gt; respectively. This could indicate the end of hostilities with the &lt;a href=\"Feralfen%20Village\"&gt;Feralfen Village&lt;/a&gt; and the possibility of an alliance between the draenei and certain &lt;a href=\"lost%20ones\"&gt;lost ones&lt;/a&gt;.\nCulture.\nThe Lost Ones have become violent and unpredictable, even toward their own kind. However, some like &lt;a href=\"Kum%27isha%20the%20Collector\"&gt;Kum'isha the Collector&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Kuruti\"&gt;Elder Kuruti&lt;/a&gt; display a clear intelligence but still refuse to rejoin the draenei, due to bitterness to having been abandoned by them as Broken or their wish to maintain their own independence.\nLike the Broken, the Lost Ones have forsaken the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt; practices they once had, and have instead started to use &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;ism and even dark magic. As such, they are usually shunned by the rest of the draenei.\n&lt;a href=\"Draenethyst\"&gt;Draenethyst&lt;/a&gt; seems to be valued by them, as it seems that some of their larger leather huts in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; are decorated with shards of it, and the &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Ones%20%28organization%29\"&gt;Lost Ones&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20of%20Sorrows\"&gt;Swamp of Sorrows&lt;/a&gt; were stealing some from the &lt;a href=\"Harborage\"&gt;Harborage&lt;/a&gt;.\nTribes.\nThe Lost Ones formed several groups, both on Azeroth and Outland:\nIn Warcraft III.\n&lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"creep\"&gt;creep&lt;/a&gt;s:\n&lt;a href=\"Ashtongue%20tribe\"&gt;Akama's tribe&lt;/a&gt;: \"(may all be &lt;a href=\"Broken\"&gt;Broken&lt;/a&gt; instead)\"\nIn ', &lt;a href=\"Akama\"&gt;Akama&lt;/a&gt; and his followers looked like the former draenei model which is now used for the Lost Ones. However, around the release of ', they were retconned into having been &lt;a href=\"Broken\"&gt;Broken&lt;/a&gt; all along. The only remainders of this change were Akama's mouth and the fact that several Lost Ones were still serving Illidan.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20III%20Reforged\"&gt;Warcraft III Reforged&lt;/a&gt;\", Akama has the appearance of a broken draenei but his followers still look like lost ones."}

In their despair, they cursed the name of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; and sank into violence and hatred, becoming little more than mindless monsters.\nThese maddened Broken devolved into &lt;a href=\"Lost%20One\"&gt;Lost One&lt;/a&gt;s and split from &lt;a href=\"Magtoor\"&gt;Magtoor&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Broken%20exiles\"&gt;Broken exiles&lt;/a&gt;. Now they attack every race that approaches, even their former Broken brethren, under the command of &lt;a href=\"Noboru%20the%20Cudgel\"&gt;Noboru the Cudgel&lt;/a&gt;, a vicious Lost One wandering the swamps with his gang. The Lost Ones notably attacked a &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; caravan and only left only one survivor, &lt;a href=\"Watcher%20Biggs\"&gt;Watcher Biggs&lt;/a&gt;, while stealing most the supplies. \nAnother subject of dissension with the Broken are the &lt;a href=\"draenethyst\"&gt;draenethyst&lt;/a&gt; crystals, a sacred item to the Exiles of the &lt;a href=\"Harborage\"&gt;Harborage&lt;/a&gt;. The Lost Ones stole several of them, with &lt;a href=\"Ongeku\"&gt;Ongeku&lt;/a&gt; holding a &lt;a href=\"Draenethyst%20Shard\"&gt;shard&lt;/a&gt; himself. Draenethyst was rumored to be able to open a portal back to their homeworld, and &lt;a href=\"Lost%20One%20Riftseeker\"&gt;several&lt;/a&gt; of the Lost Ones were in search of a similar rift.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nWith the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal%20Opens\"&gt;reopening&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; and the arrival of the uncorrupted &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Anchorite%20Avuun\"&gt;Anchorite Avuun&lt;/a&gt; came to the Broken exiles to aid them. He also wanted to learn all that he could from the Lost Ones. &lt;a href=\"Cersei%20Dusksinger\"&gt;Cersei Dusksinger&lt;/a&gt;, on her side, established herself in &lt;a href=\"Stonard\"&gt;Stonard&lt;/a&gt;, trying to perfect a horrible disease for use against the draenei. Seeing the Lost Ones as their backward cousins, she experimented on them by giving their caged animals &lt;a href=\"Fel-Tainted%20Morsels\"&gt;Fel-Tainted Morsels&lt;/a&gt;, furthermore &lt;a href=\"Cursed%20Lost%20One\"&gt;cursing&lt;/a&gt; some of the fallen draenei. Anchorite Avuun, horrified, sent &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; adventurers to put them out of their misery.\nCataclysm.\nThe remaining Lost Ones of the &lt;a href=\"Fallow%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Fallow Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; grow more corrupt by the day, and as they die off, they have begun to kidnap from the &lt;a href=\"Harborage\"&gt;Harborage&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Noboru%20the%20Cudgel\"&gt;Noboru the Cudgel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ongeku\"&gt;Ongeku&lt;/a&gt; are missing or dead, presumably leaving the control of the tribe into the hands of an unnamed &lt;a href=\"Lost%20One%20Chieftain\"&gt;chieftain&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe disappearance of any &lt;a href=\"Lost%20One%20Rift%20Traveler\"&gt;rift traveler&lt;/a&gt; among their ranks also indicates that, despite the reopening of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, they have lost sight of their original goal to find a way back home.\nSociety.\nThe Lost Ones feed themselves with meat from the area's monsters (&lt;a href=\"crocolisk\"&gt;crocolisk&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"jaguar\"&gt;jaguar&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"tarantula\"&gt;tarantula&lt;/a&gt;s). Apparently they also eat humans. They have &lt;a href=\"seer\"&gt;seer&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s in their ranks.\nIn the RPG.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; exploded and became what is known as &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, most of the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; died. A few survivors managed to cross to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; through the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, when it was reopened by unknown cause after the events of the &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Invasion of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;. These draenei called themselves the Lost Ones in mourning of their former world, and established themselves in the &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20of%20Sorrows\"&gt;Swamp of Sorrows&lt;/a&gt;. Some have begun since to travel beyond the swamp's borders.\nThey have managed to make a life for themselves in the Swamp of Sorrows, and struggle to reclaim their former lives. The Lost Ones have managed to plant water-loving crops in the drier areas of the swamp and can feed themselves with those and with meat from the area's monsters.\nThere are about 750 of them. They were a peaceful race but would kill an &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; whenever the opportunity arises, to the point that they made plans to wipe out the orcs of &lt;a href=\"Stonard\"&gt;Stonard&lt;/a&gt;. When a &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; in Stonard used a spell that went wrong and attracted the swamp's monsters, as well as some of the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s wandering north of the &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt;, the Lost Ones tried to take advantage of the situation.\nSpeculation.\nAll of the Lost Ones living in the Blasted Lands (including &lt;a href=\"Kum%27isha%20the%20Collector\"&gt;Kum'isha the Collector&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Akubar%20the%20Seer\"&gt;Akubar the Seer&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Portal%20Seeker\"&gt;Portal Seeker&lt;/a&gt;s, the &lt;a href=\"Draenei%20Refugee\"&gt;Draenei Refugee&lt;/a&gt;s and the &lt;a href=\"Wretched%20Lost%20One\"&gt;Wretched Lost One&lt;/a&gt;s) could have originally been a part of the group.\nBy the time of the start of the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; has encountered some lost ones on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.

He also oversaw the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Death%20Knight\"&gt;Death Knight&lt;/a&gt; starting area in \"&lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;Wrath of the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;\".\nFollowing \"Wrath of the Lich King\", Afrasiabi transferred to the team. \"Titan\" was ultimately canceled and Afrasiabi rejoined the \"World of Warcraft\" team until he was terminated from Blizzard in June 2020 for sexual harassment.\nIn-game references.\nThere were many references to Afrasiabi, and his characters Furor Planedefiler and Kariel in \"Warcraft\", usually referencing \"Foror\". \"Tigule\" is a reference to &lt;a href=\"Jeffrey%20Kaplan\"&gt;Jeffrey Kaplan&lt;/a&gt;, whose alias is Tigole. Afrasiabi and Kaplan were both members of high-end \"\" guilds, explaining the many references to \"Tigule and Foror\". These references were either changed or outright removed following Afrasiabi's allegations of misconduct becoming public.\nVirtually all of these references (except most of the testing items) were renamed in July 2021, after it was revealed that he had a history of sexually harassing coworkers during his time at Blizzard. This has also sparked a policy for \"Overwatch\" to stop naming characters after Blizzard employees, though it's not hard to imagine that this will likely apply to all Blizzard franchises."}

He also makes an appearance in &lt;a href=\"Old%20Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Old Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt; as his past self in '. In \"\", he appears as a quest giver in the &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxus%20storyline\"&gt;Maldraxxus storyline&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"%3ANecrolords%20Campaign\"&gt;:Necrolords Campaign&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nThe Ashbringer.\nIn his youth, Alexandros Mograine spent months training and praying in the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Monastery\"&gt;Monastery&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt some point, he met and married his wife &lt;a href=\"Elena%20Mograine\"&gt;Elena&lt;/a&gt;, with whom they had two children: &lt;a href=\"Renault%20Mograine\"&gt;Renault&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Darion%20Mograine\"&gt;Darion&lt;/a&gt;. On the day of Darion's birth, Alexandros rushed in a hurry the stillborn baby to a nearby stream, as he wasn't breathing, and from the freezing water Darion Mograine entered the world. However, the joy his father felt quickly turned to grief as his wife died due to complications from the birth.\nYears later, at the end of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, Highlord Mograine and &lt;a href=\"High%20General%20Abbendis\"&gt;General Abbendis&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; led an army of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Steppes\"&gt;Burning Steppes&lt;/a&gt;. Upon their arrival during the &lt;a href=\"siege%20of%20Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;siege of Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;, they were warned that the orc armies of &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; have attacked and overrun the troops of the Supreme Commander &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt;, and that &lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther the Lightbringer&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s were fighting them. Consequently, Alexandros shouted a rallying cry and ordered his troops to come and lend a hand to their allies on the battlefield. During the battle, they attacked the western flank of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt;, and the Highlord was narrowly saved from an ogre by &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt;. He later witnessed a &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; channeling dark magic through a mysterious orb, and after witnessing the loss of many of his men to the orc, he ordered his ballistas to eliminate him. Impressed by the power of the orb, he tried to seize it in order to make it an artifact commanded by the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;, but when he touched it, his hand was badly mangled and a dwarf priest told him that he could do nothing to reverse it. Still curious as to what power it might hold, he kept it in an iron chest.\nDeath is Contagious.\nSince the end of the war, Alexandros kept the orb a secret in his house, and after the death of his wife, he took care of his children alone. In order to protect them, he forbade them from going near the iron chest, and angrily scolded them when they tried to get their hands on it by curiosity. At some point, his advisor &lt;a href=\"High%20Inquisitor%20Fairbanks\"&gt;Fairbanks&lt;/a&gt; came to his house to bring him the latest information regarding the remaining &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, and about a mysterious &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;plague&lt;/a&gt; under the investigation of Uther, &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; in the northern lands of the kingdom. Days later, after learning that the plague was bringing back the dead as undead in the service of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, Alexandros summoned his comrades and leaders of the Silver Hand \u2014 &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Inquisitor%20Isillien\"&gt;Isillien&lt;/a&gt;, Abbendis, &lt;a href=\"Arcanist%20Doan\"&gt;Doan&lt;/a&gt;, and Fairbanks \u2014 in the inn of &lt;a href=\"Southshore\"&gt;Southshore&lt;/a&gt; where he &lt;a href=\"Old%20Hillsbrad%20Ashbringer%20event\"&gt;revealed&lt;/a&gt; the dark orb, suggesting that they should search for the orb's polar opposite - a manifestation of the Holy Light itself - to be used against the impending undead holocaust. While they did not share the same opinion, Isillien tried to destroy in vain the artifact with his sacred powers, and at the request of Alexandros and Doan, together they managed to purify the artifact. Impressed by their success, the Highlord took the holy orb which restored life to his mangled hand, and they decided that the artifact would be used to create a weapon that would bring them victory against the undead.\nHowever, they were interrupted by Lord commander &lt;a href=\"Saidan%20Dathrohan\"&gt;Saidan Dathrohan&lt;/a&gt; who informed them about the &lt;a href=\"Culling%20of%20Stratholme\"&gt;Culling of Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;, and Arthas' suspension of the Silver Hand after Uther tried to stop him. In their situation, the assembly had no choice but to continue the fight in secret, and Alexandros decided to travel to &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; with Fairbanks and the orb. After several days of travel, Fairbanks mentioned to Alexandros that among their ranks, some including Abbendis, had an apprehension of dwarves and generally of all non-human races. The Highlord rejected all these ideas which he considered unworthy of a paladin, and that he had faith and confidence in the dwarves who would help them to create the weapon he needed. When they arrived, they presented themselves to the guards to obtain an audience with &lt;a href=\"King%20Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;King Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, and when they meet him, they learned that he had just lost his brother &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, originally there for an expedition of the &lt;a href=\"Explorers%27%20League\"&gt;Explorers' League&lt;/a&gt; but that he lost his life accompanying Arthas in his quest for revenge. Despite Alexandros' condolences, the king rejected them and immediately agreed to forge the weapon that would serve to avenge his brother, and to express all the rage and sadness he had inside. When he finished forging the weapon, Magni described it as the greatest creation wrought by his hand, then he announced that &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;Terenas Menethil II&lt;/a&gt; have been murdered by Arthas who returned as a &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;, and that he had started the &lt;a href=\"Scourging%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Scourging of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; during their absence. Filled with rage at the thought of losing his children, Alexandros and Fairbanks rode day and night to reach his house, where he found that Renault and Darion where under the protection of &lt;a href=\"Taelan%20Fordring\"&gt;Taelan Fordring&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Hearthglen\"&gt;Hearthglen&lt;/a&gt;. When the Scourge attacked, he used the sword that would smite the undead with such power that only a cloud of ash would remain in its wake, he named it: \"&lt;a href=\"Ashbringer\"&gt;The Ashbringer&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nAt Hearthglen, Alexandros was happily reunited with his children, and thanked Taelan for taking care of them. He then discussed with Saidan Dathrohan who told him that their order was in ruins, Uther was murdered by Arthas and Lordaeron had fallen under the control of the Scourge. It was with anger that the Highlord announced that all was not lost, and that with the Ashbringer, it was time for them to strike back. During the next years after the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, Alexandros was appointed as the new leader of the Silver Hand, and led the remaining paladins in their war against the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands\"&gt;Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;. As the paladins wagged battle, word of Alexandros' deeds spread and he became a legend who shared the name of the order's greatest weapon, the Ashbringer.\nDuring one of their excursion, Alexandros was accompanied by his companions and by his children, now members of the order, and all of them entered the burning ruins of &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;. Having been warned by Abbendis that the city had become a dangerous place, the Highlord confirmed the information with his own eyes and ordered Renault to protect his little brother. As they advanced through the city, the group was separated by a building that collapsed and they had to fight the undead to find each other. During the battle, Darion was injured by a &lt;a href=\"skeletal%20mage\"&gt;skeletal mage&lt;/a&gt; and Saidan was eliminated by the &lt;a href=\"Nathrezim\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt; who took possession of his body to infiltrate the paladin order, until Alexandros managed to find a way out for all of them to escape. That night, they set up a camp and Alexandros remained at his son's bedside until his healing powers could no longer do anything for him, and in a fit of rage, he accused Renault of failing to protect Darion until he was interrupted by &lt;a href=\"Brigitte%20Abbendis\"&gt;Brigitte Abbendis&lt;/a&gt; and the possessed Dathrohan. Once calm, the Highlord told Taelan Fordragon about what happened to Darion when he was a baby, that he saw his late wife in his son's eyes, and that he couldn't afford to lose him or he would lose her again. The next day, he saw Darion come out of his tent unscathed and hugged him with joy, declaring that everything would be fine and that he loved him.\nDays later, during a hectic meeting where &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Maxwell%20Tyrosus\"&gt;Lord Maxwell Tyrosus&lt;/a&gt; offered to recruit &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gnome\"&gt;gnomes&lt;/a&gt; to reclaim Lordaeron, only to face to the general opposition, it took the intervention of Alexandros to calm the situation. He then announced that with their actual troop they could not refuse help from other races, but that for the moment they had to take care of their own problems. After being informed of the possibility of contacting the troops of &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Hand\"&gt;Tyr's Hand&lt;/a&gt;, and of the presence of the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Ruins of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, he ordered to make contact with the human city and to prepare their troop to defeat the free-willed undead before they could become a threat. This decision enraged Balnazzar who decided to eliminate Alexandros by manipulating his eldest son Renault, before the Highlord managed to ruin the plans of his brother &lt;a href=\"Varimathras\"&gt;Varimathras&lt;/a&gt;, the traitorous majordomo of Sylvanas infiltrated among the Forsaken.\nAshes to Ashes.\nWeeks later, Alexandros was accompanied by &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Maxwell%20Tyrosus\"&gt;Lord Maxwell Tyrosus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Brigitte%20Abbendis\"&gt;Brigitte Abbendis&lt;/a&gt; and his advisor &lt;a href=\"High%20Inquisitor%20Fairbanks\"&gt;Fairbanks&lt;/a&gt; to spy on the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;, while they were taking possession of the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Ruins of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. The Highlord took note that they were not like the undead of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, that they had free will and would be much better organized, so he announced that he would require reinforcements from &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Hand\"&gt;Tyr's Hand&lt;/a&gt; to amass an army capable of reclaiming the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt;. In order to prepare for the future conflict, Alexandros took his party to the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Monastery\"&gt;Old Monastery&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt;, to make it a forward base. When they arrived, they discovered that the monastery was not deserted and that someone was living there, Alexandros ordered to search for the residents and they eventually caught the &lt;a href=\"jungle%20troll\"&gt;jungle troll&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Zabra%20Hexx\"&gt;Zabra Hexx&lt;/a&gt;. The Highlord interrupted the argument between Maxwell and Brigitte about the fate of the troll, and ordered the latter to reveal the reasons for his presence in these sacred places. After listening to the troll's story, and his revelation that he knew how to use the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;, Alexandros used his powers to determine the truth and discovered that the troll hadn't lied, so he allowed Zabra to leave.\nOnce the monastery was secured, Alexandros rode with Fairbanks to &lt;a href=\"Hearthglen\"&gt;Hearthglen&lt;/a&gt;, in order to plan their future operations with the leaders of the Silver Hand. On the way, they were interrupted by his son &lt;a href=\"Renault%20Mograine\"&gt;Renault&lt;/a&gt; who told them that his brother &lt;a href=\"Darion%20Mograine\"&gt;Darion&lt;/a&gt; was in danger at &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;, and that the troops of &lt;a href=\"High%20General%20Abbendis\"&gt;General Abbendis&lt;/a&gt; failed to defeat the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. After hearing this report, Alexandros ordered his son to meet Brigitte Abbendis at the Old Monastery to request reinforcements, while he and Fairbanks rushed to Stratholme. However, all this was only a trap of his son, corrupted by his anger and the blood of the &lt;a href=\"Nathrezim\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt;. Upon arriving in Stratholme, they saw only armies of undead surrounding them, and they had no choice but to fight them to the last or to die. During the fight, Fairbanks fell first to the Scourge's attacks, and the Highlord had no choice but to rely on his holy powers and the Ashbringer to survive. After an interminable battle, Alexandros managed to massacre the entire army of undead and collapsed from fatigue, however, he did not see that the legendary weapon was recovered by his son Renault, which pierced him with it. In his final moments, Alexandros recognized his son and confessed that he had been wrong about him, and that they had nothing in common, before finally collapsing to the ground.\nLater in Hearthglen, news of Alexandros' death reached the leaders of the Silver Hand, and they reacted to his death with horror. During a meeting, Fairbanks was brought in and accused the possessed &lt;a href=\"Saidan%20Dathrohan\"&gt;Saidan Dathrohan&lt;/a&gt; and Renault of being responsible for this ambush, and to have the blood of Alexandros on their hand. However, he was not listened to and was taken away for execution after being accused of being infected. The death of the Highlord led to the division of the Order of the Silver Hand, Saidan Dathrohan organized the birth of the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Maxwell%20Tyrosus\"&gt;Lord Maxwell Tyrosus&lt;/a&gt; and his men left to join the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the same time, &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; brought Alexandros back to life as an undead, having retrieved his body and the &lt;a href=\"Ashbringer\"&gt;Corrupted Ashbringer&lt;/a&gt; in front of the gates of Stratholme, after he was murdered by his son who could not take the corrupted blade. During the process, Alexandros was tortured by memories and nightmares of his past, including the corpse of his wife &lt;a href=\"Elena%20Mograine\"&gt;Elena&lt;/a&gt; who blamed him for her death, the loss of his son Darion, and the hatred of his son Renault. Once he finally accepted that he loved no one, and no one loved him, Kel'Thuzad announced that Alexandros would now be a &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt; under his control. He met &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Zeliek\"&gt;Sir Zeliek&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thane%20Korth%27azz\"&gt;Thane Korth'azz&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Blaumeux\"&gt;Lady Blaumeux&lt;/a&gt;, before receiving the Corrupted Ashbringer. Now a slave of the Scourge, the Archlich announced that Alexandros was from now on a champion of the Lich King, and the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Horsemen\"&gt;Four Horsemen&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile he was killing undead to express his anger, Darion meet Zabra Hexx who told him that he was indebted to Alexandros, and that the bond that united them through the Light had darkened. Eventually, he explained that the Highlord was still \"alive\" in a &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas\"&gt;fortress floating above a burning city&lt;/a&gt;, before disappearing when the Argent Dawn arrived to meet the young paladin at &lt;a href=\"Brill\"&gt;Brill&lt;/a&gt;.\nNaxxramas.\nIn order to save his father, &lt;a href=\"Darion%20Mograine\"&gt;Darion Mograine&lt;/a&gt; called for volunteers of the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Chillwind%20Camp\"&gt;Chillwind Camp&lt;/a&gt;. When he finally formed a team, they traveled to &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt; and managed to infiltrate &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt;. At the same time, &lt;a href=\"Renault%20Mograine\"&gt;Renault Mograine&lt;/a&gt; decided to burn down his father's house and destroy his mother's grave, in order to escape the torment and remorse of his actions. Inside the &lt;a href=\"necropolis\"&gt;necropolis&lt;/a&gt;, Darion and his companions fought their way through the abominations and horrific experiences of &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;, losing some of their own in battle, until they came to face Alexandros and his &lt;a href=\"Four%20Horsemen\"&gt;Four Horsemen&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the battle, Alexandros arrived riding his &lt;a href=\"Skeletal%20Horse\"&gt;skeletal horse&lt;/a&gt; and killed the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Grunn%27Holde\"&gt;Grunn'Holde&lt;/a&gt;, he then faced Darion in single combat, the latter tried to bring him to his senses, but Kel'Thuzad's grip was too strong. As Alexandros was about to kill his son, he was interrupted and frozen by a spell from the mysterious &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Castillian\"&gt;Castillian&lt;/a&gt;. When he managed to free himself from his prison, the former Highlord was killed with an accidental sword blow to the head by Darion. However, as his body was caught in his son's arms, Alexandros' soul was imprisoned in the &lt;a href=\"Ashbringer\"&gt;Corrupted Ashbringer&lt;/a&gt; and he ordered his son to take the sword and to flee through one of the doors to the room, then through one of the portals of the Scourge.\nOnce outside, the voice of Alexandros in the corrupted sword led Darion to the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Monastery\"&gt;Scarlet Monastery&lt;/a&gt;, in order to meet Renault. When Darion approached, Renault recognized the sword and violently attacked his brother, only to be interrupted by Alexandros' soul manifesting out of the Ashbringer. Hearing his son speak of treason, he replied with cruel irony that the latter knew what he was talking about, and when his eldest son begged his father to let him live and to forgive him, Alexandros beheaded him, announcing that he forgave him. Under Darion's horrified gaze, the spirit of the Highlord asked him not to look at the monster he had become, before finally disappearing back into the corrupted sword.\nDust to Dust.\nDuring a dream, &lt;a href=\"Darion%20Mograine\"&gt;Darion&lt;/a&gt; met the ghost of &lt;a href=\"High%20Inquisitor%20Fairbanks\"&gt;Fairbanks&lt;/a&gt; who brought him comfort, and who asked him to meet &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to free his father from the corrupted blade. When he met the legendary paladin, now an exiled hermit, Tirion discovered that Alexandros' soul was damned and locked in the legendary weapon. Although he told Darion there was no way to free his father's soul, the old paladin announced after consideration that the only way to free Alexandros' soul would be through an act of love stronger than the act of treachery that murdered his father and defiled the weapon, but warned him that such an act would be the ultimate test of faith.\nBefore the first battle for &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt;, Darion had nightmares of his father slowly fading into oblivion. When the day of battle arrived, Darion fought the Scourge armies of &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Ashbringer\"&gt;Corrupted Ashbringer&lt;/a&gt;. When the tide of battle turned against the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt;, Darion finally understood Tirion Fordring's words, in an act of pure love he committed suicide with the sword, freeing his father's soul as well as the wrath of hundreds of souls under the holy grounds. Although his sacrifice brought victory against the Scourge, Darion's body was recovered by Kel'Thuzad who used him to replace his father as the champion of the Lich King and wielder of the Corrupted Ashbringer. Although Darion could no longer hear him, Alexandros joined the souls of the heroes under Light's Hope Chapel, and announced that he would never forget his son's sacrifice and that he would love him forever.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Second Battle for Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt;, Darion - now a death knight himself and wielding the Corrupted Ashbringer - led an attack against &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt; with the Scourge and his &lt;a href=\"Death%20Knights%20of%20Acherus\"&gt;Death Knights of Acherus&lt;/a&gt;, but he was defeated by &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt; who came to support the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt; with his &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;. During the dialogue between Darion and Tirion, Alexandros's spirit appeared, and a dialogue between father and son - evidently a flashback of some kind - took place, where Alexandros mentioned that Darion would one day wield the &lt;a href=\"Ashbringer\"&gt;Ashbringer&lt;/a&gt;. However, their reunion was cut short by the arrival of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, who claimed Alexandros's soul with &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt;.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Eligor%20Dawnbringer\"&gt;Eligor Dawnbringer&lt;/a&gt;'s lecture in &lt;a href=\"Wintergarde%20Keep\"&gt;Wintergarde Keep&lt;/a&gt;, Alexandros \"was the finest warrior that the Death Knights had ever seen\". He then explained that after the in &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, the Highlord vanished without a trace, and &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; had to name &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Rivendare\"&gt;Baron Rivendare&lt;/a&gt; in his place of the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Horsemen\"&gt;Four Horsemen&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel%20%28instance%29\"&gt;fall&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt;, one of the champions of Azeroth wielding &lt;a href=\"%3AShadowmourne\"&gt;:Shadowmourne&lt;/a&gt; found &lt;a href=\"%3AAlexandros%27%20Soul%20Shard\"&gt;:Alexandros' Soul Shard&lt;/a&gt; in an &lt;a href=\"%3AUnsealed%20Chest\"&gt;:Unsealed Chest&lt;/a&gt; taken from Arthas' corpse. When they returned it to Darion Mograine, Alexandros's spirit appeared for the final time, thanking his son for saving him from damnation, and explained that the memory of his sacrifice had been the only thing that allowed him to resist &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt;'s torments, before finally disappearing.\nShadowlands.\nAfter being freed from Frostmourne, Alexandros' &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt; was sent to the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt; realm of &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxus\"&gt;Maldraxxus&lt;/a&gt;, home to the &lt;a href=\"Necrolord%20Covenant\"&gt;Necrolord Covenant&lt;/a&gt;. He felt only horror and rage when he first awoke in the realm, for he perceived the necrolords as being no different from the Scourge. However, &lt;a href=\"Margrave%20Krexus\"&gt;Margrave Krexus&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20the%20Chosen\"&gt;House of the Chosen&lt;/a&gt; eventually showed him that the Maldraxxi were a force of honor and acclaim. Mograine would choose to keep the title of Ashbringer in this new existence. He rose through the ranks to become one of the two barons of the Chosen, the other being &lt;a href=\"Vyraz\"&gt;Vyraz&lt;/a&gt;. After he was named baron, he had &lt;a href=\"Bonesmith%20Heirmir\"&gt;Bonesmith Heirmir&lt;/a&gt; craft him a new sword called &lt;a href=\"Fatebringer\"&gt;Fatebringer&lt;/a&gt;, modeled after the Ashbringer. Alexandros fought hard to come by some of the materials used in its crafting, including a skull of unknown origin. At some point, Vyraz\u2014who was secretly working with the traitorous &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Constructs\"&gt;House of Constructs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Rituals\"&gt;House of Rituals&lt;/a&gt;\u2014betrayed Mograine and trapped him within the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt;, the realm of eternal torment. &lt;a href=\"Draka\"&gt;Draka&lt;/a&gt; later took Mograine's place as baron.\nBlade of the Primus.\nA &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Walker\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt; later arrived to Maldraxxus and began working with Draka, but while the two were away from the House of the Chosen, Vyraz worked with the Constructs to murder Krexus. When Draka and the outsider returned, Vyraz blamed the deed on the Constructs and sent the Maw Walker to rescue Mograine from the Maw. In truth, Vyraz did not expect the hero to return. The hero traveled into the Maw and first rescued Darion Mograine, who had been captured during an &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands%20intro%20experience\"&gt;earlier assault&lt;/a&gt; on the realm. The &lt;a href=\"broker\"&gt;broker&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ve%27nari\"&gt;Ve'nari&lt;/a&gt; guided the two outsiders to &lt;a href=\"Perdition%20Hold\"&gt;Perdition Hold&lt;/a&gt;, where they found Alexandros being held captive. Darion was shocked by the revelation of the baron's identity, having been so focused on why they had travelled to the Shadowlands it hadn't occurred to him that he could possibly run into the souls of his family. With Ve'nari's help, Darion and the Maw Walker freed Alexandros and brought him to &lt;a href=\"Oribos\"&gt;Oribos&lt;/a&gt;, where he informed Draka and the hero of Vyraz's betrayal. Before the Maw Walker and the two barons returned to Maldraxxus, Darion told his father that he would stand by his side once more when he could, and Alexandros promised his son that they would have time to speak again later.\nWhile Draka warned the Chosen's allies at the &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20the%20Primus\"&gt;Seat of the Primus&lt;/a&gt;, Alexandros and the Maw Walker confronted Vyraz at the House of the Chosen to punish him for his betrayal. However, the treacherous baron and his guards proved to be too powerful. Draka interrupted the battle to bring Alexandros and the Maw Walker to the Seat and defend it from Vyraz's allies. The Maw Walker subsequently used the &lt;a href=\"Blade%20of%20the%20Primus\"&gt;Blade of the Primus&lt;/a&gt; to open the way into the Seat, unleashing the &lt;a href=\"Primus\"&gt;Primus&lt;/a&gt;' power and forcing Vyraz's forces to retreat, as well as revealing a message from the Primus.\nArt of War.\nAlexandros remained stationed at the Seat. The necrolords later received word from &lt;a href=\"Xandria\"&gt;Xandria&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"kyrian\"&gt;kyrian&lt;/a&gt; Paragon of Courage, that the House of Constructs had sent reinforcements to &lt;a href=\"Bastion\"&gt;Bastion&lt;/a&gt; to continue their earlier assault on the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Courage\"&gt;Temple of Courage&lt;/a&gt;. Alexandros volunteered to spearhead the defense of the temple alongside necrolord Maw Walkers in order to restore Maldraxxus' honor. Xandria was highly distrustful of the necrolords and stated that she would only tolerate their presence if they helped defeat their treacherous kin. The Ashbringer and Maw Walkers disabled the Constructs' shields in the outer area of the temple, then flew with Xandria to the edge of the &lt;a href=\"Necrotic%20Wake\"&gt;Necrotic Wake&lt;/a&gt;\u2014the ruined inner sanctum\u2014where the Construct &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxi%20necromancer\"&gt;necromancers&lt;/a&gt; had created a toxic cloud preventing the kyrian from flying in en masse. As Alexandros and the heroes went to work killing the necromancers, they heard the mocking voice of the Construct commander, &lt;a href=\"Baroness%20Antolyte\"&gt;Baroness Antolyte&lt;/a&gt;, an old rival of Mograine who was never able to defeat him in the arena. Once the skies were cleared, Xandria and necrolords wiped out the Construct forces on the ground and headed to the &lt;a href=\"necropolis\"&gt;necropolis&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Zolramus\"&gt;Zolramus&lt;/a&gt;, where they killed Antolyte. As they returned to the temple's entrance, Xandria stated that her kin desired vengeance against the Constructs, and Alexandros replied that the necrolords would need time to prepare for such an assault.\nBefore they returned to Maldraxxus, Alexandros asked Xandria why the &lt;a href=\"Arbiter\"&gt;Arbiter&lt;/a&gt; had not chosen for him to spend his afterlife in Bastion when he had spent his life in service to the Light. He wondered if it was because his faith hadn't been strong enough or if his soul had been tainted when he was raised as undead. Xandria replied that forces like the Light had no purchase in the Shadowlands and brought Alexandros to &lt;a href=\"Agthia%27s%20Repose\"&gt;Agthia's Repose&lt;/a&gt; to discern the source of his courage. By meditating on the repose's scrolls, Alexandros realized that it was the memory of his loved ones\u2014not his devotion to the Light\u2014that was the true source of his strength. If he had been chosen for Bastion, his memories of &lt;a href=\"Elena%20Mograine\"&gt;Elena&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Renault%20Mograine\"&gt;Renault&lt;/a&gt;, and Darion would've been deemed a burden and stripped from him, and thus the Arbiter decided that he belonged in Maldraxxus instead. The Maw Walkers subsequently returned to Draka with news of their victory over the Constructs, but Alexandros chose to stay a moment in Bastion to reflect before accompanying Xandria to &lt;a href=\"Archon%27s%20Rise\"&gt;Archon's Rise&lt;/a&gt; to plan the attack on the Constructs. He suggested to Xandria that the Construct ruler &lt;a href=\"Margrave%20Gharmal\"&gt;Margrave Gharmal&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Fleshshaper%27s%20Heart\"&gt;heart&lt;/a&gt; could be used to empower the kyrian's &lt;a href=\"Crest%20of%20Ascension\"&gt;Crest of Ascension&lt;/a&gt;. During the conversation, Xandria also told the Ashbringer about a &lt;a href=\"Forsworn\"&gt;Forsworn&lt;/a&gt; named \"&lt;a href=\"Uther\"&gt;Uther&lt;/a&gt;\".\nWhen the kyrian and necrolords attacked the House of Constructs with the necropolis &lt;a href=\"Zerekriss\"&gt;Zerekriss&lt;/a&gt;, Alexandros and &lt;a href=\"Emeni\"&gt;Emeni&lt;/a&gt; led the assault on the western gate while the Maw Walkers helped Xandria and the kyrian advance from the east. Alexandros and Emeni's forces\u2014including Bonesmith Heirmir and &lt;a href=\"Plague%20Deviser%20Marileth\"&gt;Plague Deviser Marileth&lt;/a&gt;\u2014came under heavy bombardment from Gharmal's &lt;a href=\"Bilebloat%20Juggernaut\"&gt;juggernauts of kyrian flesh&lt;/a&gt;, preventing them from advancing into the &lt;a href=\"Stitchyard\"&gt;Stitchyard&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Kynthia\"&gt;Kynthia&lt;/a&gt; brought the Maw Walkers to the Ashbringer's position to assist him. The juggernauts' hides were impervious to normal weapons, but Alexandros devised a plan to deal with them. First, he told the Maw Walkers to absorb the essences of Gharmal's minions into the &lt;a href=\"Blade%20of%20the%20Primus\"&gt;Blade of the Primus&lt;/a&gt;. Then, he and the heroes mounted his pet &lt;a href=\"deathroc\"&gt;deathroc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Marrow%20%28roc%29\"&gt;Marrow&lt;/a&gt;, headed into the sky above the Stitchyard, and unleashed the runeblade's power on the juggernauts to destroy them, thereby forcing Gharmal into the open. With the attackers having gained control of the stronghold, Alexandros and the heroes joined Xandria at the central ripening pond and engaged in combat with Gharmal in order to buy enough time for Draka to focus the Zerekriss' weaponry. While Xandria dueled the margrave directly, Alexandros and the heroes focused on holding off Gharmal's minions. The battle ended with Draka using the Zerekriss to fire a massive bolt of energy at the margrave, killing them. Afterward, Alexandros convinced Xandria to take Gharmal's heart as he had suggested earlier. Draka appeared shortly after to show the Ashbringer and necrolord Maw Walkers a troubling discovery she had made in Gharmal's &lt;a href=\"Gharmal%27s%20Tower\"&gt;private tower&lt;/a&gt;: canisters of &lt;a href=\"anima\"&gt;anima&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Revendreth\"&gt;Revendreth&lt;/a&gt;. Before leaving, she told the Ashbringer and heroes to search the rest of the tower for anything of value. At the top of the structure, they discovered the Primus' &lt;a href=\"%3AMantle%20of%20Eternal%20Victory\"&gt;:Mantle of Eternal Victory&lt;/a&gt;, which they took with them back to the Seat.\nLater, Alexandros accompanied the necrolords as they assaulted &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Rituals%20%28subzone%29\"&gt;the stronghold&lt;/a&gt; of the House of Rituals in order to remove the influence of the traitor &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;. After breaking down the barriers blocking a side entrance into the stronghold, the necrolords pushed into the &lt;a href=\"Grimoirium\"&gt;Grimoirium&lt;/a&gt; and confronted Kel'Thuzad's servant, &lt;a href=\"Baroness%20Ninadar\"&gt;Baroness Ninadar&lt;/a&gt;. After empowering herself with anima, Ninadar began battling Alexandros, Draka, and the Maw Walkers until they nearly defeated her, at which point she started draining even more anima and inadvertently destroyed herself in the process. The attackers continued to the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Arcanum\"&gt;Prime Arcanum&lt;/a&gt;, where they were unable to stop Kel'Thuzad from summoning a &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Infernous\"&gt;Maw Infernous&lt;/a&gt; but received sudden reinforcements from the &lt;a href=\"Venthyr%20Covenant\"&gt;Venthyr Covenant&lt;/a&gt; that allowed them to defeat the creature. The attackers pressed on to &lt;a href=\"Exoramas\"&gt;Exoramas&lt;/a&gt;, where Kel'Thuzad was waiting with the captive &lt;a href=\"Margrave%20Sin%27dane\"&gt;Margrave Sin'dane&lt;/a&gt;. Alexandros and the others spread out to hold off Kel'Thuzad's &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20Bulwark\"&gt;skeletal minions&lt;/a&gt; while the Maw Walkers dealt with the lich himself. After Kel'Thuzad escaped in defeat and the necrolords gained the allegiance of Sin'dane, Alexandros pointed out that there was still much to be done, such as making Vyraz answer for his treachery and dealing with Kel'Thuzad more permanently. Draka agreed but stated that for the time being, they should return to the Seat and savor their victory.\nAlexandros can be invited to participate in the &lt;a href=\"Ember%20Court\"&gt;Ember Court&lt;/a&gt;.\nChains of Domination.\nThe Ashbringer accompanied the covenant forces who invaded the realm of &lt;a href=\"Korthia\"&gt;Korthia&lt;/a&gt; and can be found at &lt;a href=\"Keeper%27s%20Respite\"&gt;Keeper's Respite&lt;/a&gt;. He led the necrolords in the united covenant attack on &lt;a href=\"Desmotaeron\"&gt;Desmotaeron&lt;/a&gt;, during which Draka, &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, and a Maw Walker rescued a number of &lt;a href=\"Forsworn\"&gt;Forsworn&lt;/a&gt; and killed Vyraz. Mograine then returned to the Seat with the Forsworn and some of the necrolords' old allies from Bastion to witness the &lt;a href=\"Primus\"&gt;Primus&lt;/a&gt; naming Draka the new Margrave of the Chosen. He told Maw Walkers that with Vyraz's death, his quest to purge the corruption from Maldraxxus was complete. However, honor demanded that the necrolords help other lands in need of assistance before they could start rebuilding.\nAfter the attack on the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Sanctum of Domination&lt;/a&gt;, Darion joined his father at Keeper's Respite. The Mograines discussed &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt;, who had been the one to take up the Ashbringer and defeat the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; in battle. Alexandros commented that he could think of few people who were more worthy and that he disapproved of how Darion and the rest of the Ebon Blade had tried to raise Tirion as a &lt;a href=\"Four%20Horsemen\"&gt;Horseman&lt;/a&gt;, saying that it was not the legacy he had meant to leave for his son. Darion replied that Alexandros had taught him to defend what he held most dear, a legacy he was proud to uphold, and his father responded that he was proud of Darion in turn.\nWith the Corrupted Ashbringer.\nPlayers who obtained the from the original version of Naxxramas could take it to the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Monastery\"&gt;Scarlet Monastery&lt;/a&gt; and see a special &lt;a href=\"Corrupted%20Ashbringer/Scarlet%20Monastery%20Event\"&gt;event&lt;/a&gt; in which Alexandros Mograine returned, killed his son, and frees Fairbanks' spirit from his undead form. With the updated lore in the comics and the expansion, however, this event and the information given by Fairbanks regarding the Ashbringer have mostly been retconned out.\nAbilities.\nIn addition to the two listed above, he also has:"}

He was previously a quest giver located inside &lt;a href=\"Scholomance%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Scholomance&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nBefore the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the wealthy &lt;a href=\"Barov\"&gt;Barov&lt;/a&gt; family made a deal with &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;. In return for a promise of immortality, the Barovs turned their home into a school of &lt;a href=\"necromancy\"&gt;necromancy&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href=\"Scholomance\"&gt;Scholomance&lt;/a&gt;. The Barovs were turned into servants of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, yet Alexi Barov, one of two Barov sons, broke free of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; and became a &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;. Some time after his brother &lt;a href=\"Weldon%20Barov\"&gt;Weldon&lt;/a&gt; escaped &lt;a href=\"Caer%20Darrow\"&gt;Caer Darrow&lt;/a&gt;, he encountered the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; Alexi but spared his life. As such, they were both heirs to the Barov family fortune.\nInheritance.\nAlthough it was unknown how exactly they intended to deal with obtaining that fortune - since most of it was probably still buried somewhere within the treasuries of &lt;a href=\"Caer%20Darrow\"&gt;Caer Darrow&lt;/a&gt; - the brothers nonetheless sought the four deeds that could be found somewhere in &lt;a href=\"Scholomance\"&gt;Scholomance&lt;/a&gt;. This inheritance had made them enemies, and Alexi would stop at nothing to become the only surviving heir to the Barov fortune.\nAlexi was affiliated with the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and was located at the &lt;a href=\"Bulwark\"&gt;Bulwark&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; area of &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt;. He tasked Horde &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s with collecting the family deed as well as with slaying his brother in Western Plaguelands. &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; adventurers sent by Weldon also attacked him and attempted to seize his &lt;a href=\"Head%20of%20Alexi%20Barov\"&gt;head&lt;/a&gt;.\nSince the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, however, Alexi seemed to have given up his former goal, as he could be found inside Scholomance, right next to Weldon himself, attempting to rid their former home of the Scourge. Alexi instructed adventurers within Scholomance to kill &lt;a href=\"Vectus\"&gt;Vectus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Marduk%20Blackpool\"&gt;Marduk Blackpool&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ras%20Frostwhisper\"&gt;Ras Frostwhisper&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlexi came to with his brother, Weldon, having made up and become partners in &lt;a href=\"Barov%20Industries\"&gt;Barov Industries&lt;/a&gt;. They had united to plunder the world's riches, but their greed got the better of them and they betrayed each other. Alexi is found under a tree and rescued by the adventurer. After joining the adventurer at &lt;a href=\"Frostwall\"&gt;Frostwall&lt;/a&gt;, he asks them once again to kill his brother.

She was one of five great dragons chosen by the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s to be empowered with a portion of the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;'s power and rule over her flight while they watched over Azeroth and its inhabitants. The titans also appointed her queen of all dragons.\nToday, Alexstrasza resides at the top of the &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt;, a place considered a holy ground for the &lt;a href=\"dragonflight\"&gt;dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;s. No longer content to simply watch over the mortal races, the Dragonqueen took action in bringing the dragonflights together to battle the then-hostile &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; and its &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Aspect&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the looming threat of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith the rise of &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; during \"\", Alexstrasza took a very active role in defending Azeroth against the Aspect of Death, eventually ordering her entire dragonflight to war against the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;. Alexstrasza, along with her fellow Aspects, gave their all to stop Deathwing &lt;a href=\"Madness%20of%20Deathwing\"&gt;once and for all,&lt;/a&gt; but lost much of their power in the process.\nShe has now passed on her legacy to the mortals of the world. Her humanoid form is that of a &lt;a href=\"high%20elf\"&gt;high elf&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\n&lt;a href=\"Dawn%20of%20the%20Aspects\"&gt;Dawn of the Aspects&lt;/a&gt; (past).\nIn &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s ancient past, the Dragon Aspects were &lt;a href=\"proto-dragon\"&gt;proto-dragon&lt;/a&gt;s who stood united against a foe who threatened their entire species: the bloodthirsty Father of Dragons, &lt;a href=\"Galakrond\"&gt;Galakrond&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlexstrasza, her brother &lt;a href=\"Dralad\"&gt;Dralad&lt;/a&gt;, and her younger sister &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt; were the only three survivors of their clutch. Ysera was sick and smaller than average, and Alexstrasza watched out for her.\nAlexstrasza was one of the more intelligent of proto-dragons, capable of broken speech unlike most of the other, more animal-like of her kind. When one of her clutch brothers went missing, Alexstrasza searched to find him and met with &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt;. The two were attacked by a savage gray proto-dragon, and though they fought it off Alexstrasza noted that it was frightened of something. Alexstrasza and Malygos would later find her brother, though he was a shriveled husk of flesh and bone.\nSome time later, dozens of proto-dragons hunted caribou, Alexstrasza and Ysera included. While Alexstrasza would offer Ysera her kills, Ysera declined. Ysera approached Malygos to ask him about her brother's corpse, which Malygos had found alongside Alexstrasza. She said that there was another corpse she and Alexstrasza had found, though Alexstrasza reprimanded her, saying they had agreed not to speak of that. The two argued, but they were interrupted by the sudden appearance of Galakrond. After the gigantic terror had flown away, a confident grey proto-dragon named &lt;a href=\"Neltharion\"&gt;Neltharion&lt;/a&gt; taunted them all for being afraid.\nYsera and Alexstrasza would later come across the shriveled up corpses of two proto-dragons, including Malygos's old companion &lt;a href=\"Tarys\"&gt;Tarys&lt;/a&gt;. A small and terrified purple proto-dragon insisted that Galakrond had devoured the dead dragons, which matched theories Malygos had expressed to the two sisters. They went to fetch Malygos so he could meet the purple dragon. After his arrival, the corpses stirred and attacked as undead. Alexstrasza, Malygos, and Ysera tore them apart.\nLike the other proto-dragons Alexstrasza would gather under the command of &lt;a href=\"Talonixa\"&gt;Talonixa&lt;/a&gt;. While her sister believed that peace could made with Galakrond and the &lt;a href=\"not-living\"&gt;not-living&lt;/a&gt;. Alexstrasza knew that fighting was the only option, however, she vowed to not fight like Talonixa. When Ysera was given a chance to speak her idea of peace, Alexstrasza was worried about Talonixa's reaction. Alexstrasza became outraged that &lt;a href=\"Coros\"&gt;Coros&lt;/a&gt;, who encouraged Ysera, did not stand with her. While seemingly supporting her, Malygos later learned that Coros used the meeting as a distraction so that he could join up Galakrond unnoticed following its conclusion in which Talonixa swayed the other proto-dragons to her side on fighting Galakrond.\nWitnessing Coros's betrayal and subsequent devouring by Galakrond, Malygos would return to the others only to find Ysera and Talonixa in conflict over the fate of the bitten proto-dragons who had begun to act like Galakrond. Alexstrasza found herself agreeing with Talonixa over the issue. Seeming to agree with Ysera's desire for them to still live, Talonixa decreed that the bitten would have to be quarantined for the safety of everyone else. Alexstrasza watched the bitten dragons be herded into a canyon. She was shocked to see Talonixa collapse it and killing all those trapped inside.\nAlexstrasza would then later save her sister from Galakrond, after Ysera tried to plead peace even as the proto-dragon army fought the not-living. As Galakrond began to fight the proto-dragon army, the Watcher &lt;a href=\"Tyr\"&gt;Tyr&lt;/a&gt; used one of the not-living to catch the sister's attention.\nSome time after, Malygos found his way to the three of them, and Ysera attacked him when he tried to kill the bound undead proto-dragon. As Tyr spoke with Malygos, Ysera freed the undead proto-dragon in order to make it see reason, an action which could have killed her if not for Malygos's timely intervention. After destroying the undead Malygos briefly succumbed to the hunger for flesh, but Ysera was able to recall him to his senses and Malygos was then cured by Tyr. Tyr then proposed hunting Galakrond and decided to stand by the proto-dragons this time, revealing a war hammer from beneath his cloak. Lastly, he pulled out an octagonal artifact, moving it to the three proto-dragons as it glowed, with the promise that he was \"trying to ensure some future.\"\nAlexstrasza would witness Galakrond returning outside the cavern, chasing Neltharion and &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt;. Malygos and Tyr moved to the entrance to witness their battle, and Tyr was overjoyed at the proto-dragons' coordination. Alexstrasza, Malygos and a now full-sized Tyr joined in the battle. Temporarily stunning Galakrond with his hammer, Tyr ordered the proto-dragons to flee as he stayed to battle the monster.\nAn unknown time later, Tyr met with the five proto-dragons, informing them that Galakrond was sleeping in a mountain range to the north and that it was the perfect time to attack. He told them to eat before doing so, and just before they left Tyr held the octagonal artifact before Nozdormu and Neltharion as he had to the others before. After doing so, Tyr vanished in the blink of an eye.\nTyr and the proto-dragons met up near Galakrond's slumbering place, which &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; would later note in his visions was nowhere near &lt;a href=\"Galakrond%27s%20Rest\"&gt;Galakrond's Rest&lt;/a&gt;. Save for Ysera, they all began the battle against Galakrond, who had grown larger and even more mutated than before. Throughout the battle, the octagonal object on Tyr's belt glowed ever brighter. When Galakrond suddenly expanded in size without warning, Tyr's hammer could no longer harm him. With a flap of wings, Galakrond called up a massive wind that scattered the fighters. Ysera suddenly appeared and Galakrond attempted to devour her, but Tyr silenced his laughter with a mighty blow from his hammer. Tyr pulled Galakrond to the ground and began to mercilessly beat him even as Galakrond began mutating further - as he began to resemble a true dragon.\nIn the battle, Tyr's hammer and the strange artifact were knocked free from his person. Tyr reached to grab the artifact, just as Galakrond's massive maw came within range and the monster clamped down on Tyr's hand. Malygos moved to save Tyr, examining the bloody stump as Galakrond roared in triumph and grew ever larger. An unconscious Tyr was brought to a frozen lake by the proto-dragons, only to vanish from the shore. After being attacked by two not-living Alexstrasza and the others found they could not find Tyr where they left him, concluding that some beast must have taken him for food.\nAfter recuperating Alexstrasza and the others decide to hunt down Galakrond in order to kill him once and for all or die trying. It was during this time that Malygos feeling burdened by leadership role cast upon him gave it to Alexstrasza, after she took charge in response to his unvoiced question. Alexstrasza, along with the others would be stunned to learn that Galakrond had begun to devour the not-living in order to feed his hunger and shortly after would engage in battle with the behemoth. During the battle, Galakrond would ultimately be killed after Malygos and Neltharion forced a boulder down his throat.\nAfter killing Galakrond Alexstrasza and the others were approached by two other watchers, who revealed that they had taken Tyr to help him. Agreeing to protect Azeroth with her friends the two watchers were joined by two others and the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s acted through the &lt;a href=\"keeper\"&gt;keeper&lt;/a&gt;s to transform Alexstrasza and the others into the Dragon Aspects. &lt;a href=\"Freya\"&gt;Freya&lt;/a&gt; channeled the powers of &lt;a href=\"Eonar\"&gt;Eonar&lt;/a&gt; into Alexstrasza, making her the warden of life. Since she had led the proto-dragons in the last assault against Galakrond, Alexstrasza was made the Dragonqueen. One of the Aspects first actions was to encourage the rumor that they had been formed from Galakrond. This was done to prevent the truth about Galakrond from leaking to ensure no one would follow in the behemoth's footsteps.\nThe Winterskorn War.\nWhen fallen &lt;a href=\"Keeper\"&gt;Keeper&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Loken\"&gt;Loken&lt;/a&gt; instigated the &lt;a href=\"Winterskorn%20War\"&gt;Winterskorn War&lt;/a&gt;, fought between the &lt;a href=\"Winterskorn\"&gt;Winterskorn&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"earthen\"&gt;earthen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tyr\"&gt;Tyr&lt;/a&gt; and his allies fought on the earthen's side. However, when Tyr realized that they could not win against the &lt;a href=\"Winterskorn%20clan\"&gt;Winterskorn clan&lt;/a&gt; alone he called upon the Dragon Aspects for aid. The noble Aspects grew enraged upon seeing so many dead &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt;. Their fury only deepened when they learned that proto-dragons had been enslaved. Without hesitation, the Aspects took wing and unleashed their powers on the Winterskorn's iron ranks.\nMuch as they had done in the fight against &lt;a href=\"Galakrond\"&gt;Galakrond&lt;/a&gt;, the aspects worked in unison to overwhelm and the vrykul army. Alexstrasza held the Winterskorn at bay with towering walls of enchanted fire. &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt; drained the magical essence that fueled the constructs and golems, rendering them useless. He also shattered the enchanted snares that bound the proto-dragons and set the beasts free. &lt;a href=\"Neltharion\"&gt;Neltharion&lt;/a&gt; raised mountains from the earth to corral and contain the vrykul and their giant masters. Lastly, &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt; combined their powers to create a spell that would bring a decisive end to the conflict.\nYsera and Nozdormu enveloped the Winterskorn in a cloying mist that caused them the titan-forged to fall asleep. These incapacitated creatures were then locked away in tombs cities across northern &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. They would not know the peaceful slumber of the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;. Rather, they would languish in a timeless, unconscious slumber for thousands upon thousands of years.\nWar of the Ancients.\nAlexstrasza was one of the three dragon aspects that fought the demons of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;. It was also in that war that the black dragon &lt;a href=\"Neltharion\"&gt;Neltharion&lt;/a&gt; deceived his fellow Aspects, using the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt; (also now known as the Demon Soul) to steal a portion of their power. After the War of the Ancients ended, when &lt;a href=\"Illidan\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt;, brother of &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, emptied three vials of water from the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity%20%28Hyjal%29\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; over the river of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, Alexstrasza, along with &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt;, decided to use the Well as a tool to heal the war-ravaged land by placing a magical acorn from &lt;a href=\"G%27Hanir\"&gt;G'Hanir&lt;/a&gt;, the Mother Tree, into the new Well of Hyjal. The tree that grew from this acorn was proclaimed the original &lt;a href=\"World%20Tree\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt; of Azeroth, and is named &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt;.\nLater activity.\nFor some time after, she and her fellow red dragons were at peace, but over time they began to argue about how best to shelter and protect the world. The rise to power of &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s and other races left many believing that these new people were dangerous and should be destroyed, while others of Alexstrasza's ilk felt they should be educated to teach them right from wrong.\nAt some point, the blade &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Delar\"&gt;Quel'Delar&lt;/a&gt; was handed to the &lt;a href=\"high%20elven\"&gt;high elven&lt;/a&gt; king &lt;a href=\"Anasterian%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Anasterian Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; personally by Alexstrasza the Life-Binder.\nAlexstrasza officiated the &lt;a href=\"Visage%20Day\"&gt;Visage Day&lt;/a&gt;\u2014the ceremony in which a dragon decides what their mortal form will be\u2014for the &lt;a href=\"Bronze%20dragonflight\"&gt;bronze dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Chronormu\"&gt;Chronormu&lt;/a&gt;. Chronormu almost fainted on the spot when he heard that the queen would be attending. When she arrived to the ceremony atop &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt;, she kindly told him in private that she could postpone the ceremony if he liked since she'd heard that he'd had doubts about his choice of form, but he replied that he was ready. After it was revealed that Chronormu had chosen the form of the female &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt; Chromie, Alexstrasza warmly smiled at her and said that it was good to meet her.\n&lt;a href=\"Dahlia%20Suntouch\"&gt;Dahlia Suntouch&lt;/a&gt; offered herself to Alexstrasza and became a keeper of the &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Dragonshrine\"&gt;Ruby Dragonshrine&lt;/a&gt;.\n823 &lt;a href=\"BDP\"&gt;BDP&lt;/a&gt;, Alexstrasza was approached by &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt; to join forces against a group of &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. Led by Alexstrasza, the dragons and the Guardian fought against the Legion in &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt;.\nTides of Darkness.\nTen thousand years later during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nekros%20Skullcrusher\"&gt;Nekros Skullcrusher&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt;, was given the Dragon Soul by his Warchief &lt;a href=\"Zuluhed\"&gt;Zuluhed&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; led them to its resting place in the &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. Far from the mountains, Alexstrasza sensed the wards around the artifact breaking and grew concerned when she heard no word from its guardian &lt;a href=\"Orastrasz\"&gt;Orastrasz&lt;/a&gt;. She and several of her red dragons hurried south, though she believed that some mortal had found the disc and Orastrasz was currently hunting for it and that it would be easy to help him retrieve. In truth, they were heading right into Deathwing's trap.\nUsing the awesome power of this ancient artifact, Nekros and the Dragonmaw orcs captured Alexstrasza and her consorts, including her eldest consort &lt;a href=\"Tyranastrasz\"&gt;Tyranastrasz&lt;/a&gt;. Nekros was but one orc and so could only focus on Alexstrasza, but the other dragons were kept in line by him lashing out at the Life-Binder with the Dragon Soul's power whenever they tried to save her. Alexstrasza was brought to &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;, where she began laying new clutches of eggs. Nekros was quick to see this as a golden opportunity and the Dragonqueen was therefore forced to lay more eggs. The adult dragons were used as powerful war mounts, while the eggs would be raised as loyal &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20whelp\"&gt;whelps&lt;/a&gt;. As she was magically kept in a constant state of weakness and pain and bound by mighty chains of &lt;a href=\"adamantine\"&gt;adamantine&lt;/a&gt; steel, Alexstrasza had no choice but to succumb to this terrible slavery, lest her unborn clutches be slain at the hand of her cruel captor. As the aspect of life, this caused Alexstrasza pain as it could no one else, and she cried for the deaths of her children and the deaths they caused.\nFrom afar, Deathwing rejoiced in Alexstrasza's imprisonment. He continued to subtly advise Nekros on how best to use the Demon Soul to control the red dragons. Not only would making the Horde stronger help his plan to restore the black dragonflight, but he also knew that seeing her children be used as tools for war would make Alexstrasza's heart suffer. And Deathwing would relish every moment of Alexstrasza's torment.\nBattle of Grim Batol.\nAfter the Second War ended, Alexstrasza became more valuable to the Horde than ever, as a consummation of Horde military power. Thus she was to be protected at all costs. However, &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, ancient traitor to Alexstrasza and her most hated enemy, who had partly arranged for her continued subjugation during the Second War, arranged an elaborate plot to draw her into the open and steal her children in the hopes of generating his own progeny. His plan, however, unwittingly facilitated her escape.\nAs the orcs began moving their captive dragons away from the fortress of &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to safeguard their slaves from the reach of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, the caravan was attacked by Deathwing. During the battle that followed, Tyranastrasz was slain by the black wyrm, but the ancient Dragonqueen was set free and the first thing she did was to swallow her evil captor Nekros whole and to reclaim her children from the grip of the Horde. With the help of her former mate &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Korialstrasz&lt;/a&gt;, Alexstrasza then rejoined the remaining Aspects &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt;. The human mage, &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt;, destroyed the Demon Soul, releasing their powers and enabling them to drive Deathwing into hiding. Though Neltharion ultimately escaped the wrath of the other Aspects, the ravaged orc caravan still remains in the &lt;a href=\"Wetlands\"&gt;Wetlands&lt;/a&gt; swamps. Her fire-breathing children returned to their posts as protectors of all life and worked to rebuild their devastated race.\nForgotten oaths.\nFor ten thousand years, Deathwing's fellow Dragon Aspects had lived without the full measure of their power, and the sudden return of their strength was physically and mentally exhausting. Needing to recover from this and her traumatic ordeal under the Dragonmaw, Alexstrasza and her flight sequestered themselves away to heal, both physically and emotionally. As such, even as her consorts and children continued to have their impact on Azeroth, Alexstrasza's whereabouts were unknown to most, though &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; seemed to know where she resided at the time. The Dragon Aspects had no real involvement in the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, but in its aftermath, the new &lt;a href=\"Archdruid\"&gt;Archdruid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt; asked her to bless the new &lt;a href=\"World%20Tree\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;. The Dragonqueen refused.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nThe Dragonqueen traveled to &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, where appeared on the top tier of the temple in &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt; in her &lt;a href=\"Dragon%23Shapeshifting\"&gt;visage form&lt;/a&gt;, resembling an unnaturally tall female &lt;a href=\"high%20elf\"&gt;high elf&lt;/a&gt; with pink skin, amber eyes, and horns. Alexstrasza also appeared in her draconic form at &lt;a href=\"Angrathar%20the%20Wrathgate\"&gt;Angrathar the Wrathgate&lt;/a&gt; after the completion of &lt;a href=\"Return%20To%20Angrathar\"&gt;Return To Angrathar&lt;/a&gt; (where she will replay the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Angrathar%20the%20Wrathgate\"&gt;cutscene depicting the battle there&lt;/a&gt; at the players' request) and in the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Eye of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; raid in the &lt;a href=\"Nexus\"&gt;Nexus&lt;/a&gt;, where she and her children will aid players in slaying the Spell-Weaver.\nDuring the battle against &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ulduar%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt;, Alexstrasza appears in her elf form, along with the other &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Aspects&lt;/a&gt;, during a flashback of the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt;, ten thousand years earlier.\nAlexstrasza was also visited by &lt;a href=\"Kekek\"&gt;Kekek&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Roo\"&gt;Roo&lt;/a&gt; during the Children's Week. They wanted to see her in her dragon form, but she told them that there would be no space.\nThe Nexus War.\nAt some point, she called upon the members of the &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Accord\"&gt;Wyrmrest Accord&lt;/a&gt; to play their part against the blue dragons in the &lt;a href=\"Nexus%20War\"&gt;Nexus War&lt;/a&gt;. Malygos has declared war on all mortal spellcasters, especially the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, he also decided to realign the flow of magic to point toward &lt;a href=\"Coldarra\"&gt;Coldarra&lt;/a&gt;, where the &lt;a href=\"Nexus\"&gt;Nexus&lt;/a&gt; gathered all this &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; energy. As everyone had an interest in not allowing the world to be torn apart, the red dragonflight allied with the mortals against the Blue Aspect's crusade, partly because of a promise made by Alexstrasza to &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt; after being freed from the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Battle of Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;, that neither she nor her flight would harm the races of the rescuers. Alexstrasza is the head of the &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Accord\"&gt;Wyrmrest Accord&lt;/a&gt;, the united effort of the dragonflights against Malygos' crusade.\nAt the end of the conflict, Malygos was defeated by Alexstrasza with a lot of help on the ground. In his last breath, Malygos was questioning the reasoning of Alexstrasza's actions, imploring her to see that mortals would destroy everything. Shortly after Malygos's death, Alexstrasza arrived and declared that the Nexus War had officially concluded.\nStormrage.\nWhen Azeroth was attacked by the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;, Alexstrasza ventured into &lt;a href=\"Bough%20Shadow\"&gt;Bough Shadow&lt;/a&gt;, where she rescued &lt;a href=\"Broll%20Bearmantle\"&gt;Broll Bearmantle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Eranikus\"&gt;Eranikus&lt;/a&gt; from being attacked by &lt;a href=\"Lethon\"&gt;Lethon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Emeriss\"&gt;Emeriss&lt;/a&gt;. Alexstrasza then convinced Eranikus to join the mortals in the Emerald Dream to search for &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion&lt;/a&gt; by saying that Ysera understood him and his motive for seeking isolation. When the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; purged &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt; of its corruption, she sensed its purity and blessed the World Tree so it may become the haven for nature it was meant to be. She then accompanied Malfurion to &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;, where he found Fandral's secret portal to the Emerald Dream. During the &lt;a href=\"War%20Against%20the%20Nightmare\"&gt;War Against the Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;, Alexstrasza stayed there defending the portal while druids were battling in the Emerald Dream.\nAround that time, Tyrande, &lt;a href=\"Lucan%20Foxblood\"&gt;Lucan&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Thura\"&gt;Thura&lt;/a&gt; became prisoners of the &lt;a href=\"Xavius\"&gt;Nightmare Lord&lt;/a&gt;, who created a false vision of a captured Alexstrasza in order to break their hope.\nFollowing the conflict's conclusion, she, along with her sister Ysera, blessed the new World Tree &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt; and presided over the marriage ceremony of the Archdruid &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm era.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Highlands\"&gt;Twilight Highlands&lt;/a&gt;, Alexstrasza confronted Deathwing. After several minutes of battle, Deathwing and Alexstrasza fell towards the ground, clutched in each other's claws. Alexstrasza, exhausted and gravely injured, was found laying on the ground in her humanoid form, while Deathwing fell out of sight beyond the crest of the mountain. &lt;a href=\"Calen\"&gt;Calen&lt;/a&gt; (who likewise took elven form), an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; and the adventurer's &lt;a href=\"drake\"&gt;drake&lt;/a&gt; raced to the dragon queen's side. Her voice wavered as she explained that the Earth Warder was dead. Like a phantom, the gigantic form of Deathwing rose up behind them. Calen exclaimed \"he lives!\" and the wounded Alexstrasza forced herself to sit up, stating that it was \"impossible\" for Deathwing to have survived the wounds she dealt him. Deathwing set the ground at his feet aflame and glowered over the group. Calen moved to put himself between his queen and Deathwing, while the adventurer threw Alexstrasza's body over their mount's back and took her to safety, despite her protests. Calen took his true form again, but he was completely dwarfed by the Black Aspect. Realizing he stood no chance of defeating Deathwing, Calen darted back and forth, shooting fireballs, in an effort to distract him while Alexstrasza escaped. He later stated that this was a partial victory, as Deathwing was gravely wounded and would need to go into hiding to recuperate. Alexstrasza was moved to Wyrmrest to recuperate.\nThrall: Twilight of the Aspects.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;the cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the dragons convened upon Wyrmrest Temple to have their first meeting with the blue dragonflight since the death of Malygos. Korialstrasz, not particularly liked by many of the blues, specifically &lt;a href=\"Arygos\"&gt;Arygos&lt;/a&gt;, chose to stay behind and watch his newest clutch of eggs in the Ruby Sanctum. As Alexstrasza traveled to the meeting above, Korialstrasz discovered the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight Hammer&lt;/a&gt; within the sanctum, casting dark spells on the eggs. Confronting them, he discovered that their spells had mutated the hatchlings, transforming them into deformed &lt;a href=\"Chromatic%20dragonflight\"&gt;chromatic dragons&lt;/a&gt;. When he touched a mutated egg, the infection passed on to him. It was then revealed to him that not only was the entire clutch of eggs infected, but every flight's eggs, in each of their sanctums. Half-mutated into a Chromatic dragon but thinking of his beloved Queen one last time, Korialstrasz summoned every ounce of his power and exploded the sanctum outward, destroying a good chunk of Wyrmrest Temple, and utterly obliterating himself and the sanctums. Along with the sanctums fell the thousands of corrupted eggs. While his death and apparent betrayal was a shock to the other dragonflights, Alexstrasza suffered the most. In sadness bordering on madness, she shattered the &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Accord\"&gt;Wyrmrest Accord&lt;/a&gt; and fled to the center of &lt;a href=\"Desolace\"&gt;Desolace&lt;/a&gt;, where she sat waiting for death. &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; attempted to rouse her from her depression but could not.\nLater, during a battle above Wyrmrest Temple, Thrall had a near-death experience after falling from extraordinary heights. In his vision, among other things he saw the truth behind Korialstrasz's actions. When the battle had ended, Thrall brought the news to Alexstrasza, who rejoined the fight with renewed purpose to not let her love's sacrifice be in vain.\nRage of the Firelands.\nIn &lt;a href=\"patch%204.2.0\"&gt;patch 4.2.0&lt;/a&gt;, Alexstrasza, who has made a full recovery, is present in Nordrasil to cleanse the World Tree. However, the fearsome &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Flame\"&gt;Druids of the Flame&lt;/a&gt; interrupt the ceremony and *kill*&lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, much to &lt;a href=\"Aggra\"&gt;Aggra&lt;/a&gt;'s horror. Although Alexstrasza, &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt; conclude Thrall is lost in the elements, Aggra - determined as always - believes Thrall may be saved and wants adventurers to assist her in her rescue mission.\nCharge of the Aspects.\nWhile meditating, Ysera had a flashback to the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt; and realized that it might be the only weapon powerful enough to defeat &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;. Alexstrasza agreed that Deathwing had to be slain: \"to protect life, there are times when we must destroy that which seeks to end it\". She stated that he would need to be completely \"unmade\", for he had been twisted by the dark energies of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt; and could not be destroyed by any physical assault.\n&lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; suggested that the artifact could be modified to harm Deathwing, while &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt; proposed a plan to retrieve it from the past when it was in its purest form - during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;.\nHour of Twilight.\nAlexstrasza's past self appears in the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Well of Eternity instance&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlexstrasza also appears in the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul raid&lt;/a&gt;. Like the other Aspects, she bestows her power upon the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt; so &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; can use it to vanquish &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; once and for all.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Madness%20of%20Deathwing\"&gt;battle for Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; ended when a final attack from the Dragon Soul, infused with the essence of each Aspect, completely obliterated Deathwing. Alexstrasza revealed that Aggra is pregnant and stated that by averting the &lt;a href=\"Hour%20of%20Twilight\"&gt;Hour of Twilight&lt;/a&gt;, the Aspects had fulfilled their great purpose. With their ancient powers expended, Alexstrasza and the other remaining Aspects became mortal.\nDawn of the Aspects (present).\nAdhering to their tradition to meet when the two moons of Azeroth were at particular cycle Alexstrasza and the other former aspects gathered together. At the end of the brief meeting Alexstrasza, along with Ysera and Nozdormu, decided that they would officially end the Accord one month from now, to the shock of Kalecgos. Later, Alexstrasza traveled to a human village in a forested land and watched children playing. Kalecgos sought her out there, and wanted to ask her for advice about an artifact he had found, but he understood Alexstrasza's pain and her reluctance.\nLater on, Alexstrasza and the others responded Kalecgos's request for a meeting, where using the &lt;a href=\"Spark%20of%20Tyr\"&gt;artifact&lt;/a&gt; from Watcher Tyr reminded them about their past battle against Galakrond and that they didn't need to be aspects to help safeguard the world. Agreeing with him, the other three decided to continue their affairs in protecting Azeroth and that the Accord would continue. They also swore Kalecgos to secrecy about the nature of Galakrond, as they did not want anyone to follow in his dark path. As Alexstrasza was leaving, she took the spark with her and asked Kalec to thank &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; in her part of the events.\nWar Crimes.\nAlexstrasza and Ysera were present at the trial of &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;. She was the seventh witness, retelling the event of her torture in &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt;. Yet, when questioned on what she would do if she could confront those who had inflicted such pain on her and her brood, she simply stated that she loved every creature on Azeroth \u2014 orcs included. She would pardon her torturers if they came from the past and genuinely asked her forgiveness, indicating that Thrall was an example of the possibility for redemption among all life when allowed to flourish.\nDeaths of Chromie.\nSeeking leads on who wants her dead Chromie asks Alexstrasza if she's noticed anything suspicious and she mentions that the undead have been acting up at the &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Dragonshrine\"&gt;Ruby Dragonshrine&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, Alexstrasza dispatched the &lt;a href=\"red%20drake\"&gt;red drake&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Zallestrasza\"&gt;Zallestrasza&lt;/a&gt; to the region of &lt;a href=\"Drustvar\"&gt;Drustvar&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;. Her mission was to locate the recently-revealed remains of the ancient dragon &lt;a href=\"Vadekius\"&gt;Vadekius&lt;/a&gt;, and perform a ritual to prevent them from ever being reanimated. Zallestrasza was successful in the task and traveled on to deal with other business assigned to her by Alexstrasza.\nIn time, Alexstrasza and the red dragonflight would come under attack by forces of the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20dragonflight\"&gt;Twilight dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Vexiona\"&gt;Vexiona&lt;/a&gt;. As the red and &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20dragonflight\"&gt;twilight&lt;/a&gt; dragons clashed, Kalecgos tried to send word to Alexstrasza about empowering the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Azeroth\"&gt;Heart of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; with the powers of the dragonflights. Finding it odd that Alexstrasza remained silent in the face of &lt;a href=\"Ebyssian\"&gt;Ebyssian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Merithra%20of%20the%20Dream\"&gt;Merithra of the Dream&lt;/a&gt; empowering the artifact with powers of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"green%20dragonflight\"&gt;green dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; respectively, Kalecgos became convinced that she was in trouble. Thus to that end, he recruited &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt; to come with him to the &lt;a href=\"Vermillion%20Redoubt\"&gt;Vermillion Redoubt&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Highlands\"&gt;Twilight Highlands&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter discovering the conflict, the pair aided the red dragonflight, with Alexstrasza personally considering their aid well-timed. As the twilight dragons were beaten back, Vexiona sough to flee but was ultimately confronted outside of &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt; by Alexstrasza, Kalecgos, and the champion. During the fight, Vexiona implored Alexstrasza and Kalecgos to join her and, in the face of their rejection, Vexiona trapped them in stasis. However, the champion was able to free the former aspects and subsequently forced Vexiona to flee from the battlefield. With her children now an eternally grateful, Alexstrasza vowed to empower the Heart of Azeroth and directed &lt;a href=\"Corastrasza\"&gt;Corastrasza&lt;/a&gt; to carry the champion back to . Within the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20Heart\"&gt;Chamber of Heart&lt;/a&gt;, Alexstrasza declared that her flight shall continue to protect Azeroth as long as they drew breath and as she channeled her power into the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20Forge\"&gt;Heart Forge&lt;/a&gt;, she implored champions to accept this gift so that it may light a flame within them, to burn bright through the darkest times.\nAlexstrasza later journeyed to the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20Heart\"&gt;Chamber of Heart&lt;/a&gt; where she joined with &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chromie\"&gt;Chromie&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Merithra\"&gt;Merithra&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ebyssian\"&gt;Ebyssian&lt;/a&gt; in empowering the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Azeroth\"&gt;Heart of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. She spoke of Ysera to Merithra and upon learning of her doubts, Alexstrasza encouraged her to be strong.\nShadowlands.\nFollowing the fall of Ny'alotha and Azeroth beginning to heal at last from Sargeras' wounds, Alexstrasza returned to the &lt;a href=\"Vermillion%20Redoubt\"&gt;Vermillion Redoubt&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile investigating the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Warrior\"&gt;Night Warrior&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Walker\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt; who joined the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Fae%20Covenant\"&gt;Night Fae&lt;/a&gt; would meet the spirits of a former &lt;a href=\"Night%20Warrior\"&gt;Night Warrior&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thiernax\"&gt;Thiernax&lt;/a&gt;, and his husband &lt;a href=\"Qadarin\"&gt;Qadarin&lt;/a&gt;. While speaking with them, they were attacked by &lt;a href=\"spriggan\"&gt;spriggan&lt;/a&gt;s, and the leader of the band cursed Qadarin with its dying breath. Part of the counter-curse required a token of lost love, which Ysera, now residing in the &lt;a href=\"Ardenweald\"&gt;Ardenweald&lt;/a&gt;, believed could be found with Alexstrasza as something she had been given by her last prime consort; &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Korialstrasz&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the Maw Walker found Alexstrasza, the dragon queen explained that, while she had indeed loved Korialstrasz, she had never loved anyone more than &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt;, her sister. Happy to hear that she had found a new purpose and life in the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;, Alexstrasza gave the Maw Walker &lt;a href=\"A%20Small%20Carving%20of%20Ysera\"&gt;a small carving&lt;/a&gt; Ysera had made and gifted to her shortly after they'd been empowered by the Titans.This would ultimately prove a sufficient 'token of lost love' to help break the curse on Qadarin.\nIf the Maw Walker is a &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;, Alexstrasza will be hostile in her interactions due to the events of the \"Legion\" class hall quest, &lt;a href=\"Draconic%20Secrets\"&gt;Draconic Secrets&lt;/a&gt;, \"especially\" if they approach her while riding the &lt;a href=\"Deathlord%27s%20Vilebrood%20Vanquisher\"&gt;Deathlord's Vilebrood Vanquisher&lt;/a&gt; they obtained from the questline. After being given the small carving, Alexstrasza advises the death knight to leave as not all of her brood are as tolerant of them as she is.\nThe Vow Eternal.\nIn his quest for the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt; had swallowed his pride and turned to Alexstrasza who sadly told him \"It is a place that is lost to us.\" After the isles had awakened, she warmly welcomed every dragon who had arrived at the &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt; and informed the confused Wrathion and everyone else that they were feeling the call to home.\nDragonflight.\nAlexstrasza returned to the dragons' homeland, the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;, arriving just in time to save &lt;a href=\"Watcher%20Koranos\"&gt;Watcher Koranos&lt;/a&gt; from falling to his death. As all the dragons had felt the call to home, she put aside her past disagreements with &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt; and offered him guidance. She also instructed &lt;a href=\"Ebyssian\"&gt;Ebyssian&lt;/a&gt; and Wrathion to extend a formal invitation to the Dragon Isles to the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, while having them warned that she would not abide their conflict on isles. The factions promised to honor their truce and instead sent the &lt;a href=\"Reliquary\"&gt;Reliquary&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Explorers%27%20League\"&gt;Explorers' League&lt;/a&gt; to work together as an &lt;a href=\"Dragonscale%20Expedition\"&gt;expedition of discovery&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the liberation of &lt;a href=\"Raszageth\"&gt;Raszageth&lt;/a&gt;, Alexstrasza convened with &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt;, Koranos, and &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt; to discuss the matter. Alexstrasza revealed to the confused Kalecgos and Wrathion, their history with Raszageth and the early war with the &lt;a href=\"Primal%20Incarnates\"&gt;Primal Incarnates&lt;/a&gt;, of how it took everything to beat them back and seal them. When the outraged Wrathion demanded to know, she didn't execute them, she revealed that she didn't have the heart to do so, as they were once as close as clutch mates. However in the face of Raszageth's awakening and the possibility of the other incarnates being unleashed, Alexstrasza declared that they must reclaim their Aspect of their dragonflights must be made anew. To that end she sought a &lt;a href=\"Discs%20of%20Tyr\"&gt;disc&lt;/a&gt; within , only to learn from Ebyssian and Wrathion that the &lt;a href=\"Infinite%20dragonflight\"&gt;Infinite dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Chrono-Lord%20Deios\"&gt;Chrono-Lord Deios&lt;/a&gt; had attacked and sent the disc to be lost through time.\nAlexstrasza also sent &lt;a href=\"Majordomo%20Selistra\"&gt;Majordomo Selistra&lt;/a&gt; to serve as her emissary to the arriving Horde and Alliance &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;adventurers&lt;/a&gt; to the isles, with instructions to escort them to her at the &lt;a href=\"Life%20Pools\"&gt;Life Pools&lt;/a&gt;. After adventures brought the &lt;a href=\"Infused%20Dragon%20Egg.\"&gt;Infused Dragon Egg&lt;/a&gt; to the majordomo, they believed that Alexstrasza would know what to do to save the whelp inside from the &lt;a href=\"Primalists\"&gt;Primalists&lt;/a&gt; machinations. After the egg was brought to her, she declared that the situation was dire, and that the eggs' only hope of salvation was within the Life Pools.\nWhen the Life Pools came under attack by Raszageth and her &lt;a href=\"Primalists\"&gt;Primalists&lt;/a&gt;, she ordered her flight to protect the eggs, and then flew off to personally confront Raszageth. As they clashed, she pleaded with Raszageth to see reason, to stop the fighting so they could have peace. However, Raszageth refused, pushed the blame for the war solely on the Aspects' shoulders, and wounded Alexstrasza, who found herself saved by Wrathion. An amused Raszageth decided to leave the pair, as she wanted Alexstrasza to watch as everything she cared for was destroyed before killing her.\nAfter being informed of the safety of the eggs by Selistra, she offered her gratitude to Wrathion, who was quick to try and recruit her and &lt;a href=\"Red%20dragonflight\"&gt;her flight&lt;/a&gt;'s aid in claiming the &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Citadel\"&gt;Obsidian Citadel&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"djaradin\"&gt;djaradin&lt;/a&gt;. Alexstrasza to do, after they had seen to the safety of the eggs, a declaration that confused Wrathion now that Raszageth had left. However, Alexstrasza was quick to point out that Wrathion didn't know her as she did, that she was an unpredictable foe, and that for now the red dragonflight must remain at the Life Pools to safeguard their future. Wrathion was quick to question if it was the dragon's future or her flights that she sought to safeguard, as the Obsidian Citadel was built to defend all the Dragon Isles, and implored that she couldn't abandon the legacy of &lt;a href=\"Black%20dragonflight\"&gt;his flight&lt;/a&gt; to the hands of their enemies. In response, she remarked that she would have expected him to care more for the protection of helpless eggs. Wrathion subsequently departed, determined to claim the citadel with the aid of his &lt;a href=\"Blacktalon\"&gt;Blacktalon&lt;/a&gt;. Having nothing but concern for Wrathion, she enlisted adventurers to go and aid him in her stead, while she helped focus on protecting the new generation of &lt;a href=\"Dragonkin\"&gt;dragonkind&lt;/a&gt;.\nSometime later, Alexstrasza was approached by Wrathion and informed that the last black dragon eggs were destroyed because of &lt;a href=\"Sabellian\"&gt;Sabellian&lt;/a&gt;. However when she demanded answers, Sabellian revealed that the eggs were perfect, that he in fact had used himself and Wrathion as bait to attract their enemies' attention, while his clutch of black dragons safely traveled by air to deliver the eggs. He then pledged his loyalty and that of his flight as &lt;a href=\"Neltharion\"&gt;Neltharion&lt;/a&gt;'s heir to her. However Alexstrasza was unmoved, recalling how Sabellian had played a part in &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;'s twisted legacy, to which he had defended as being a matter of duty. Though she took the eggs under her care, she remarked that she would not get involved in their bickering and the matter of Aspectship between them was a matter for the &lt;a href=\"Black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black&lt;/a&gt;, not the &lt;a href=\"Red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red&lt;/a&gt;, to decide.\nFollowing this, she privately spoke with &lt;a href=\"dracthyr\"&gt;dracthyr&lt;/a&gt; adventures, admitting that she hadn't known of their existence until they reawakening on the &lt;a href=\"Forbidden%20Reach\"&gt;Forbidden Reach&lt;/a&gt; and unclear as to what their arrival meant for the dragonflights, whether they would be a boon or bane to the defense of life. She then requested that they speak with the red dragonflight, to see what the oathstone meant to them, and to hopefully allow the dracthyr to understand more of where the dragonflights began and where they strive to reach. She further declared that there would be a home with them for the dracthyr.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Mother%20Elion\"&gt;Mother Elion&lt;/a&gt; successfully tended to eggs, the Dragon Queen declared that the future of all the flights was secured. She then revealed that &lt;a href=\"Merithra\"&gt;Merithra&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"green%20dragonflight\"&gt;green dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; had entered the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to empower &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Oathstone\"&gt;their own oathstone&lt;/a&gt;, but had heard nothing since their slumber began. She thus suggested that they seek out the &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt; that rule over the &lt;a href=\"Ohn%27ahran%20Plains\"&gt;Ohn'ahran Plains&lt;/a&gt;, feeling that they would need their connection to the land and its spirits in order to rouse the greens.\nSometime later, she traveled to &lt;a href=\"Valdrakken\"&gt;Valdrakken&lt;/a&gt; within &lt;a href=\"Thaldraszus\"&gt;Thaldraszus&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; would inform her and &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt; of his battle against &lt;a href=\"Raszageth\"&gt;Raszageth&lt;/a&gt;. In the subsequent meeting, Kalecgos revealed that while &lt;a href=\"Raszageth\"&gt;Raszageth&lt;/a&gt; was fended off her storms still persisted around the &lt;a href=\"Vakthros\"&gt;Vakthros&lt;/a&gt;' tower. In return, Alexstrasza voiced her confusion on the matter as the other &lt;a href=\"Primal%20Incarnates\"&gt;Primal Incarnates&lt;/a&gt; were not imprisoned within the &lt;a href=\"Azure%20Span\"&gt;Azure Span&lt;/a&gt; and wondered what else she could be after, turning to &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt; for insight. However, he revealed that his vision was still clouded and remarked that for all he knew, the &lt;a href=\"Primalists\"&gt;Primalists&lt;/a&gt; could be within &lt;a href=\"Valdrakken\"&gt;Valdrakken&lt;/a&gt;. Thus the aspects decided that they had to protect their home and search out any Primalists within the city. A wise precaution as &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Drine\"&gt;Captain Drine&lt;/a&gt; and the adventurer discovered that Primalists had infiltrated into the city and were seeking to create discontent against the Aspects.\nAfter the Bronze Oathstone was restored, Nozdormu sent the adventurer to inform Alexstrasza that all the oathstones were now active. She subsequently thanked them for all they have done for the flights and expressed her belief that with the oathstones active, they would be able to use the Mother Oathstone in order to regain their Aspect powers. Sometime later she decided to show her mortal allies &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Scale\"&gt;Silver Scale&lt;/a&gt;. that &lt;a href=\"Tyr\"&gt;Tyr&lt;/a&gt; had left in their possession long ago, which served as a symbol of unity and friendship to the dragonflights. However as she revealed to it, Kalecgos noted that it pulsed with magic, which was a surprise to her and Nozdormu, who thought it was an example of the scale simply changing in their absence. However, Alexstrasza believed that their return to the Dragon Isles had awakened the scale, that Tyr had left them on the last enigma for them to investigate. Thus she directed &lt;a href=\"Watcher%20Koranos\"&gt;Watcher Koranos&lt;/a&gt; and adventurers with venturing to &lt;a href=\"Tyrhold\"&gt;Tyrhold&lt;/a&gt; for answers.\nAs the pair investigated, they ultimately awaken the magic within Tyrhold by placing the scale within and subsequently used the scale to draw out the secrets about the place. They ultimately created a spark, whose creation was felt by Kalecgos, who shared it with his fellow aspects, and the trio departed from Valdrakken to join the pair at Tyrhold. After witnessing a memory of Tyr's departure from the original five aspects, Alexstrasza reflected that while it was a sad memory, she was grateful for the chance to hear his voice again. She was expressed her hope that Tyr would be proud of their accomplishments and despite the hardships dragonkind thrives, only the aspects to then be stunned when the spark reacted to the \"dragonkind thrives\" and revealed a message from Tyr directing them to reactivate the forge within Tyrhold, while revealing that the Silver Scale was the key. Following this task being taken care of, the forge was activated, where to the shock of all present, the silver scale had forged a new lifeless body of Tyr, himself. Though noting that the body didn't have the spark of life, Alexstrasza couldn't help but be overcome with gratitude that a long-lost friend had been returned to them, and expressed that they must do what they could to restore his true self, reflecting that the answers might be within the &lt;a href=\"Discs%20of%20Tyr\"&gt;disc of Tyr&lt;/a&gt; \nFollowing the return of Tyr's body and &lt;a href=\"Merithra\"&gt;Merithra&lt;/a&gt;'s ascension as the new Dreamer, but with the position of Earth-Warder still in dispute between Sabellian and Wrathion, Alexstrasza returned to Tyrhold in order to activate the Mother Oathstone to restore the aspectral powers to flights. However to her shock, and the hidden Raszageth's glee, the ritual failed. After Raszageth revealed herself they blamed one another for the ritual failing, with Alexstrasza believing that the Storm-Eater had done something to prevent it from succeeding and Raszageth believing that Alexstrasza had proven unworthy on her own. Regardless of the reason, Raszageth quickly departed to liberate her fellow &lt;a href=\"Primal%20Incarnates\"&gt;Primal Incarnates&lt;/a&gt; from their prisoner, causing Alexstrasza to give chase. However the Dragon Queen was unable to stop Raszageth from breaking into the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20the%20Incarnates\"&gt;Vault of the Incarnates&lt;/a&gt; and sent Kalecgos, &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;, and adventurers into the vault to stop her, while she and Nozdormu to plan for whatever is to come.\nIn time she was informed that while Raszageth was slain, she had successfully freed her siblings. Upon hearing this news Nozdormu found that his vision was still clouded but sensed a dark future was coming, which causes her to reflect that Raszageth's reckless haste had caused her death and that the other Incarnates would not make the same mistake. Khadgar noticed that she and Nozdormu were particularly concerned with &lt;a href=\"Iridikron\"&gt;Iridikron&lt;/a&gt;'s release over the others, causing the pair to reveal that while &lt;a href=\"Fyrakk\"&gt;Fyrakk&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vyranoth\"&gt;Vyranoth&lt;/a&gt; were loyal to the Primalists ideals, it was Iridikron who had truly devoted himself to the war, striking dark bargains to do so. However, Kalecgos rallied them together by reminding them that only together do they have a chance at victory. Thus the group vowed to move forward together as one against the Incarnates and were determined to protect Azeroth.\nEmbers of Neltharion.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Incarnates\"&gt;Incarnates&lt;/a&gt; opened the way into the &lt;a href=\"Zaralek%20Cavern\"&gt;Zaralek Cavern&lt;/a&gt;, Alexstrasza called upon &lt;a href=\"Ebyssian\"&gt;Ebyssian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sabellian\"&gt;Sabellian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt;, and the adventurer to enter and deal with &lt;a href=\"Fyrakk\"&gt;Fyrakk&lt;/a&gt;. After the group returned, she learned that Fyrakk had consumed &lt;a href=\"Shadowflame\"&gt;Shadowflame&lt;/a&gt; and initially barred the &lt;a href=\"Black%20dragonflight\"&gt;Black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; from returning, unwillingly to risk losing them, before Ebyssian convinced her that they had the strength to resist what lies below. In the aftermath of Ebyssian being selected as the new Aspect of the black dragonflight, Alexstrasza declared that the threat of Aberrus had been quailed and had made them grow stronger, while declaring that soon Azeroth would welcome a &lt;a href=\"The%20Sisters%27%20Tear\"&gt;s symbol hope&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; and that they would protect it. Alexstrasza then reflected on how long ago Neltharion was a dear friend and was filled with regret that she was never able to reach him, to help him break free of the corruption that blighted the entire black dragonflight. Acknowledging that she shouldn't linger on the past, Alexstrasza expressed hope that there were others she could reach.\nDuring this time, she and Kalecgos had decided the time had to put the essences of &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sindragosa\"&gt;Sindragosa&lt;/a&gt; to rest at the &lt;a href=\"Veiled%20Ossuary\"&gt;Veiled Ossuary&lt;/a&gt;. After they arrived, she gave Kalec the honor of putting them to rest, only to then witness their memories reanimate. After the memories manifested, Alexstrasza found going to the &lt;a href=\"Memory%20of%20a%20Traitorous%20Sister\"&gt;Memory of a Traitorous Sister&lt;/a&gt; (Malygos' last memory of her) before she and Kalec walked towards the &lt;a href=\"Memory%20of%20a%20Betrayer\"&gt;memory of Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;. Upon seeing them, she reflected that despite being killed, they were unable to truly leave the world and recalled how it pained her to learn that Sindragosa had been risen into &lt;a href=\"undeath\"&gt;undeath&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;. She and Kalecgos then departed as &lt;a href=\"Senegos\"&gt;Senegos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stellagosa\"&gt;Stellagosa&lt;/a&gt; investigated the manner.\nIn time, &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt; felt the energy that transcends time in the Silver Scale and believed that this would enable them to collect memories that Tyr did not implement on the scale. Thus Alexstrasza accompanied him to &lt;a href=\"Tyrhold\"&gt;Tyrhold&lt;/a&gt;, where they would send adventurers and &lt;a href=\"Watcher%20Koranos\"&gt;Watcher Koranos&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Tyr\"&gt;Tomb of Tyr&lt;/a&gt; to acquire whatever memories were present. There, the pair obtained memories and witnessed Tyr's final moments, in which &lt;a href=\"Zakajz%20the%20Corruptor\"&gt;Zakajz the Corruptor&lt;/a&gt; made Tyr fight against corrupt each version of the Aspects. They eerily foreshadowed the future from &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt;' reasoning for enacting the &lt;a href=\"Nexus%20War\"&gt;Nexus War&lt;/a&gt;, the corruption of Neltharion into &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, Nozdormu becoming Murozond, and Ysera corrupted by the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;, before it ended with Tyr fighting a corrupted version of Alexstrasza herself. This disturbed Koranos who made the decision that they wouldn't share this news with the Aspects. After the pair returned, they uploaded the memories, however, a copy of Tyr only briefly moved before shutting down once more. Despite this setback, Alexstrasza declared that what may come, with or without Tyr, they would face the &lt;a href=\"Infinite%20dragonflight\"&gt;Infinite dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; together, that they were dragons and will rise.\nSometime later Alexstrasza sought to end the &lt;a href=\"dragonkin\"&gt;dragonkin&lt;/a&gt; rebellion, thus she spoke with &lt;a href=\"Maldra%20Flametongue\"&gt;Maldra Flametongue&lt;/a&gt; a former rebel to understand why the dragonkin were rebelling. As they conversed they were interrupted by &lt;a href=\"Investigator%20Erima\"&gt;Investigator Erima&lt;/a&gt;, who revealed that the rebels were discovered to have stockpiled explosives beneath &lt;a href=\"Valdrakken\"&gt;Valdrakken&lt;/a&gt; with the intention of collapsing the aqueduct. She thus sent Maldra, Erima, and adventurers with stopping the rebels and taking prisoners to be questioned. Thus after the threat was extinguished, Alexstrasza questioned the prisoners at the &lt;a href=\"Steelcliff%20Rampart\"&gt;Steelcliff Rampart&lt;/a&gt; to learn why they rebelled and learned that many of the dragonkin felt used, treated poorly, and taken for granted., with some believing that the dragons taken over their home in Valdrakken. She acknowledged that they had taken the dragonkin's allegiance for granted, that they must remember that what was home to the dragons was home to the dragonkin. The one point in which she disagreed was the notion that the dragonkin were made to fight and die in their wars, as she viewed the fighting as both dragons and dragonkin fighting together and not sending the dragonkin as troops to be used in war.\nAfter learning that the leader of the rebellion was &lt;a href=\"Instigator%20Belaphon\"&gt;Instigator Belaphon&lt;/a&gt;, Alexstrasza sent her allies to where the investigator was located and spread the word amongst the rebels that if the dragons vowed to treat them as equals, wanting them to solve the rebellion in the most peaceful way possible. While some of the dragonkin fought to the bitter end, others laid down their arms and returned to the fold. Meanwhile, Belaphon submitted and attended a meeting with Alexstrasza and Maldra to discuss formally ending the dragonkin rebellion. However, the Dragon Queen made it clear that this was done in spite of the violence of the rebellion, instead of giving into it while she acknowledged that the dragons had at times been disrespectful, inconsiderate, and unfair in their treatment of the dragonkin, many of the dragonkin killed in the fighting had been innocent. Thus she vowed from this day forward, the dragons would invite the dragonkin to join them in their work over demanding and requiring it, with them being respected as part of the flights over being mere servants of them. With this, the dragonkin rebellion was formally ended, as Belaphon rejoined the fold.\nFractures in Time.\nWhen Alexstrasza inquired if the clouds still accosted his mind, &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt; revealed that something worse had happened, a moment of clarity in which he had seen that the &lt;a href=\"infinite%20dragonflight\"&gt;infinite dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Iridikron\"&gt;Iridikron&lt;/a&gt; had struck a bargain, involving his descent into &lt;a href=\"Murozond\"&gt;Murozond&lt;/a&gt;. While he was pessimistic about his fate, Alexstrasza declared that she and their allies wouldn't give up on him.\nSometime later, feeling increasingly upset over the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Primalists\"&gt;war against the Primalists&lt;/a&gt; Alexstrasza traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Waking%20Shores\"&gt;Waking Shores&lt;/a&gt;, where she met with her old friend and &lt;a href=\"Vyranoth\"&gt;Vyranoth&lt;/a&gt;, one of the &lt;a href=\"Primal%20Incarnates\"&gt;Primal Incarnates&lt;/a&gt;. During this Vyranoth reflected on how Alexstrasza spoke to her after her imprisonment, recalling how the Dragon Queen had said that it \"didn't feel like a victory without her.\" However, Vyranoth was enraged recalling how Alexstrasza promised how to not force the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;'s will upon them and then did nothing when they warped the children, still in the shell of their eggs. In response, Alexstrasza declared that it was an abhorrent act that never should have occurred and that she regretted her part in it every day. She then mentioned that while Vyranoth had always fought for the good of dragonkind, Iridikron did not and simply craved vengeance. However, Vyranoth was unmoved, called her na\u00efve, and declared that all that remained was vengeance. Despite this, Alexstrasza still had hope that Vyranoth and her would one day fight side by side again.\nAt some point, &lt;a href=\"Alulgultasza%20de%20Urgl-Blalul\"&gt;Alulgultasza de Urgl-Blalul&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Murloc\"&gt;Murloc&lt;/a&gt; version of Alexstrasza from &lt;a href=\"Azmerloth\"&gt;Azmerloth&lt;/a&gt; arrived to speak with &lt;a href=\"Soridormi\"&gt;Soridormi&lt;/a&gt; and Alexstrasza. At this meeting, Alexstrasza learned that the timelines being pulled into Azeroth through the &lt;a href=\"Time%20Rifts\"&gt;Time Rifts&lt;/a&gt; were attacking one another, and that echoes from the main timeline were attacking them as well. She accepted the offer of peace from her murloc counterpart and left the handling of the time rifts to Soridormi settle as she was more experienced in these matters.\nIn the aftermath of &lt;a href=\"Chromie\"&gt;Chromie&lt;/a&gt; and adventures stopping the &lt;a href=\"infinite%20dragonflight\"&gt;infinite dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; from turning Nozdormu into Murozond, she formally thanked them. She was subsequently informed that while Nozdormu could not see where Iridikron had gone after he escaped through a void gate, he did behold burning embers encroaching upon &lt;a href=\"Amirdrassil\"&gt;Amirdrassil&lt;/a&gt;. In response, Alexstrasza stated that &lt;a href=\"Merithra\"&gt;Merithra&lt;/a&gt; must be warned and that as dangerous as he was they had to leave Iridikron to his schemes and steel themselves for whatever &lt;a href=\"Fyrakk\"&gt;Fyrakk&lt;/a&gt; and Vyranoth were preparing to unleash.\nFury Incarnate.\nAlexstrasza was made aware of &lt;a href=\"Vyranoth\"&gt;Vyranoth&lt;/a&gt;'s arrival to &lt;a href=\"Valdrakken\"&gt;Valdrakken&lt;/a&gt; and learned that instead of destroying &lt;a href=\"Amirdrassil\"&gt;Amirdrassil&lt;/a&gt; as the Aspects thought, &lt;a href=\"Fyrakk\"&gt;Fyrakk&lt;/a&gt; intended to claim its power as his own which as a reflection of his heart which Vyranoth declared had become cruel, blazing with insatiable malice, and wreathed in shadow. After denouncing him as her brother, Vyranoth prepared to depart when Alexstrasza implored her to stand by their side. Astonished by such a request, she demanded to know why she should, to which Alexstrasza pointed out that she was a protector of his world while acknowledging her own past failings and asked that she stand with them for all of &lt;a href=\"dragonkin\"&gt;dragonkin&lt;/a&gt;d. After a moment, Vyranoth wordlessly followed Alexstrasza silently agreeing to her old friend's request.\nPersonality.\nCompassionate and wise, Alexstrasza treasures life in all its forms. She firmly believes that few beings are truly evil and that even they are not necessarily beyond redemption, for change and growth is inherent in life. It can seek the light or the darkness, and it is only when it chooses the darkness so completely that life itself is endangered that there is no hope (as was the case with &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;). The Life-Binder has always behaved with dignity, courage, grace, and compassion, even in the face of inconceivable horrors and deep personal loss. She is known to be a kind and patient mentor. Under her tutelage, only the most dedicated pupils acquire the title of \"&lt;a href=\"%3ALife-Binder%27s%20Handmaiden\"&gt;:Life-Binder's Handmaiden&lt;/a&gt;\".\nShe prefers peace and solitude, although she will defend her lands with all her power against any who threaten them without due cause. She often uses her shapechange power to appear as a creature of nature, in order to see what encroaching mortals will do before revealing her presence. Alexstrasza is devoted to all forests, and to a lesser extent all other types of green and fertile growing things. She considers all natural woodlands her home, and she needs fear no beast within such lands. Although many of Azeroth\u2019s natural creatures revere the Great Red Leviathan, she is not a goddess and does not pretend to be otherwise. Alexstrasza is rarely venerated by any particular group, although some elven communities pay her homage. Druids of the wild, in particular, appreciate her serene presence, considering her second in importance only to Ysera.\nIn her humanoid guise, Alexstrasza appears as a &lt;a href=\"high%20elf\"&gt;high elf&lt;/a&gt; with brownish red skin, intricate horns, and a mane of fiery hair that has licks of flame constantly escaping from it. Only her eyes remain unchanged from her dragon form. Her face appears rounder than any &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt;'s, almost as if mixed with &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; traits. In this guise, the Life-Binder doesn't usually display much modesty in her choice of clothing, most often being dressed as a warrior maiden with intricate, colorful armor and a cloak resembling a membranous wing. However, during the trial of &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, she instead wore a red-gold gown that covered her from neck to toe, leaving only her throat and arms bare.\nPowers and abilities.\nThe dragon-queen possess magics over all life. In the past, she has used great fire used to incinerate undead and rebirth fresh new life in their place. Cleansing the body in favor life anew is well within Alexstrasza's grasp; however, removing the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;Plague of Undeath&lt;/a&gt; without affecting the body is beyond the scope of the powers that she controls. Among Alexstrasza's abilities, she can regrow forests and heal the land. She can animate the dead and resurrect as evidenced with &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Blackwing%20Lair\"&gt;Blackwing Lair&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vaelastrasz\"&gt;Vaelastrasz&lt;/a&gt; calls upon the power of Alexstrasza to aid the raid group in defeating his corrupted form. The raid is then given a buff called \"Essence of the Red\", which essentially grants infinite &lt;a href=\"mana\"&gt;mana&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"rage\"&gt;rage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rune%20system\"&gt;runic power&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"energy\"&gt;energy&lt;/a&gt; for 3 minutes.\nHer &lt;a href=\"The%20Breath%20of%20Alexstrasza\"&gt;breath&lt;/a&gt; causes flowers to grow, seen at &lt;a href=\"Angrathar%20the%20Wrathgate\"&gt;Angrathar the Wrathgate&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href=\"Hope%20Yet%20Remains\"&gt;Hope Yet Remains&lt;/a&gt;. Other powers in \"&lt;a href=\"Heroes%20of%20the%20Storm\"&gt;Heroes of the Storm&lt;/a&gt;\" include turning an archer's arrows into a blossoming tree branch. The intense thickness of her scales causes ordinary arrows to bounce off, and she is rather agile in humanoid form, able to do an impressive backflip with ease.\nQuests.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nShe is involved in the following quests:\n&lt;a href=\"Azure%20Dragonshrine\"&gt;Azure Dragonshrine&lt;/a&gt; quest chain:\n&lt;a href=\"Angrathar%20the%20Wrathgate\"&gt;Angrathar the Wrathgate&lt;/a&gt; quest chain:\nSaving &lt;a href=\"Crusader%20Bridenbrad\"&gt;Crusader Bridenbrad&lt;/a&gt; quest chain:\nShe finishes the quest from a &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt; item drop:\nAchievement.\nUpon completing the meta Achievement &lt;a href=\"What%20a%20Long%2C%20Strange%20Trip%20It%27s%20Been\"&gt;What a Long, Strange Trip It's Been&lt;/a&gt;, players will receive a letter from Alexstrasza congratulating players. This letter also contains the &lt;a href=\"Reins%20of%20the%20Violet%20Proto-Drake\"&gt;Reins of the Violet Proto-Drake&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuotes.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nGreetings, my &lt;race&gt; friend. You honor me with your presence. How may I help you?\nBattle for Azeroth.\nThe Aspects have watched over this world for eons. While there may only be a few of us left, I will do everything in my power to protect Life on Azeroth.\nDragonflight.\nGossip.\nThe Ruby Lifeshrine was once the center of our flight. We must restore its former glory.\nThe waters of this place empowered generations of dragonkind.\nIt is time they do so once more.\nLife's blessings be with you.\nI must charge you as the guardian of Azeroth once again, &lt;name&gt;.\nThere are none that I trust more than you to see this through.\nHowever we resolve this rebel situation, I believe we'll need to treat the dragonkin differently than we have.\nAlternate timeline.\nIn an &lt;a href=\"alternate%20timeline\"&gt;alternate timeline&lt;/a&gt; where died as an infant, according to , Alexstrasza understood that his work among the Kirin Tor would aid the red dragonflight and Azeroth.\nIn Heroes of the Storm.\nAlexstrasza is a playable character in \"&lt;a href=\"Heroes%20of%20the%20Storm\"&gt;Heroes of the Storm&lt;/a&gt;\".\nAn artifact titled was temporarily available in the game's alpha.\nIn the RPG.\nFor someone of her power, the Dragonqueen is surprisingly compassionate. While Ysera has always favored the dreaming races and the &lt;a href=\"Druid\"&gt;students of Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;, Alexstrasza and her flight are known for avoiding killing if at all possible (as they are the defenders of life). Alexstrasza loves all living creatures and protects them, and only those who menace the dragonflights or the world face her wrath. Alexstrasza is supremely confident in her strength and righteousness. She does not seek out combat, but destroys only to punish or renew. In battle, she observes her foes carefully before striking at those she believes are the most deserving of her wrath. Enemies who flee when their leaders are defeated are generally allowed to escape, having learned a lesson they will not soon forget.\nAlexstrasza believed she knew a way to rejuvenate the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;, but was too busy with affairs in &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;.\nWarcraft Adventures: Lord of the Clans.\nIn the canceled \"\", she was a huge &lt;a href=\"Red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red dragon&lt;/a&gt; depicted as far less kind and life-loving than her \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" incarnation.\nIn order to storm &lt;a href=\"Durnholde%20Keep\"&gt;Durnholde&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; had to secure the aid of Alexstrasza and her dragons. He headed to her cave, hidden at &lt;a href=\"Crestfall\"&gt;Crestfall&lt;/a&gt;. During the encounter, she let loose on Thrall with fiery blasts, which he blocked with a special &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarven&lt;/a&gt; shield fortified with Alexstrasza's own scales. Alexstrasza was understandably unwilling to help Thrall, since she still hated the orcs for enslaving her during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;. She told Thrall that she would only agree to help him and his orcs if he managed to kill &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, a feat that the young orc eventually managed.\nSpeculation.\nConsorts.\nTyranastrasz was Alexstrasza's prime consort during the War of the Ancients. Tyran was described as her eldest of three consorts captured by the Dragonmaw clan of orcs. Korialstrasz was her most recent prime consort, and youngest of all consorts. That made him her fourth known consort. Korialstrasz sacrificed himself, to save the dragonflights from the corruption of the clutches of eggs in each sanctum below Wyrmrest temple by the Twilight Cult, during the events of the book \"Thrall: Twilight of the aspects.\". It is not mentioned who the second and third consorts were by name but it is stated that one perished trying to escape over the sea and the other had died of injuries inflicted by Deathwing.\nAspectship restoration.\nIt is currently unknown why Alexstrasza thought the Mother Oathstone ritual to restore the Aspectship to the flights would work with the Earth-Warder title and leadership of the black dragonflight in dispute. It is possible that she thought the oathstone itself would make the choice or had faith that blacks had already settled the matter themselves.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

Algalon could be found in the ancient &lt;a href=\"Titan-forged\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; complex of &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt;, in the far north of the continent of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. Its primary function is to monitor Azeroth for any signs of corruption and, in the event of the death of the appointed &lt;a href=\"Loken\"&gt;Prime Designate&lt;/a&gt;, proceed to conduct an analysis of the planet for the presence of systemic corruption in which he would re-originate the planet, bringing about the end of all life on Azeroth. Algalon is extremely capable in combat, utilizing cosmic powers and magic to assail his foes.\nAlgalon is encountered on &lt;a href=\"elite%20mode\"&gt;elite mode&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Ulduar%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Ulduar instance&lt;/a&gt; as the final boss, which was released in &lt;a href=\"Secrets%20of%20Ulduar\"&gt;Secrets of Ulduar&lt;/a&gt;, patch 3.1.\nHistory.\nThe departure of the titans.\nFollowing the Ordering of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; prepared to depart and continue their search for new &lt;a href=\"world-soul\"&gt;world-soul&lt;/a&gt;s. Before leaving, the Pantheon appointed the &lt;a href=\"constellar\"&gt;constellar&lt;/a&gt; Algalon the Observer to serve as the world's celestial guardian and watcher. \n&lt;a href=\"Aman%27Thul\"&gt;Aman'Thul&lt;/a&gt; was aware that one day the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt; would cause a catastrophe with the potential to wipe out all life on Azeroth, and thus put in place measures to prevent it. Should corruption begin to spread through the planet, Algalon would be summoned to run an analysis of the planet's condition. Depending on the result of the analysis, Algalon would either transmit reply-code Alpha (if systemic corruption is not present) or Omega (if it is). Omega would activate the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Origination\"&gt;Forge of Origination&lt;/a&gt;, purging Azeroth of all life and any corruption present. Though the planet would be devastated and rendered lifeless, the world-soul would be preserved.\nAlgalon would be called to Azeroth's surface if one of two scenarios occurred: Algalon was contacted directly using the titan machinery in Ulduar or elsewhere and summoned, or the Prime Designate - the Pantheon's appointed champion in charge of the protection of the planet, as well as maintaining &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt;'s prison and the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Wills\"&gt;Forge of Wills&lt;/a&gt; - was slain. \nLoken's betrayal.\nDriven nearly insane by the Pantheon's silence as well as by the whispers of Yogg-Saron and his unintentional killing of his lover, &lt;a href=\"Sif\"&gt;Sif&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt; Keeper &lt;a href=\"Loken\"&gt;Loken&lt;/a&gt; began overthrowing his fellow keepers in Ulduar. Eventually, having overcome his perceived enemies, Loken used the facility's machinery to anoint himself Prime Designate, stealing the title from Keeper &lt;a href=\"Odyn\"&gt;Odyn&lt;/a&gt;. Nearly overcome with fear that one of the other keepers might contact Algalon or even the titans and inform them of his betrayal, Loken damaged the communication devices in Ulduar, preventing anyone from ever contacting the Pantheon or Azeroth's &lt;a href=\"constellar\"&gt;constellar&lt;/a&gt; ever again.\nThe secrets of Ulduar.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, Loken and his armies were perceived as a threat to the world's stability. Loken was slain in the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Lightning\"&gt;Halls of Lightning&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Being the Prime Designate, Loken's death sent an immediate signal to Algalon. In response, the Observer returned to Azeroth to analyze the planet's corruption levels. \nAfter defeating the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s led by &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, pushed farther into the facility, reached the &lt;a href=\"Celestial%20Planetarium\"&gt;Celestial Planetarium&lt;/a&gt;. There, they witnessed the arrival of Algalon, who immediately began his planetary analysis of Azeroth. The constellar warned the expedition members that, should his analysis reveal systemic corruption within the planet, he would be forced to activate the re-origination process, stating that it would be in the universe's best interest. \nWhile Brann Bronzebeard attempted to jam the Observer's signal, his allies engaged Algalon to prevent him from sending the signal that would commence the purge. Despite having calculated every possible outcome for the fight and claiming that the mortals would lose, Algalon was defeated after a heated battle. Algalon found himself at a loss, re-examining his opinions on the nature of the mortals' imperfections. \nAlgalon concluded that his calculations were not reliable, having been proven flawed through his defeat. The constellar changed the reply code to cancel re-origination and gave the code to Brann and his allies, warning them that if no reply is received from the Observer, re-origination will commence regardless. He advised Brann to transmit the signal somewhere close to the sky. Algalon then disappeared, but he did not go far. He would watch over Azeroth from a distance in the years to come.\nBrann believed that &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; was the perfect spot to transmit the signal. Rushing to issue the code in time, the party departed from Ulduar and made haste to the &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; city and gave the code to the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt;. Hurrying to the &lt;a href=\"Eventide\"&gt;Eventide&lt;/a&gt; area of the city, Rhonin gave a passionate speech as he transmitted the message, creating a dazzling display of colors and light and, more importantly, saving Azeroth from being purged of life.\nMonitoring the mortals of Azeroth.\nAfter his defeat, Algalon remained in Ulduar to monitor the activities of the mortal races on Azeroth. His outlook on life and the titans' plans had been called into question and sought to determine what makes them so different from the countless worlds he had observed before.\u00a0\nLegion.\nShortly before the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"echo%20of%20Algalon\"&gt;echo of Algalon&lt;/a&gt; appeared in front of &lt;a href=\"Magni\"&gt;Magni&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Brann\"&gt;Brann&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; as they entered the &lt;a href=\"Celestial%20Planetarium\"&gt;Celestial Planetarium&lt;/a&gt;. The echo repeated a &lt;a href=\"Algalon%20the%20Observer%20%28tactics%29%23Quotes\"&gt;line&lt;/a&gt; from Algalon's defeat: \"Perhaps it is your imperfection... that which grants you free will... that allows you to persevere against all cosmically calculated odds. You prevail where the Titan's own perfect creations have failed.\"\nAlgalon himself has since become a pet tamer, having grown bored by the inactivity in Ulduar.\nWorld of Warcraft Anniversary.\nAnother echo of Algalon appeared, this time in the main area of the &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%27s%20Anniversary\"&gt;WoW's anniversary&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuotes.\nOther.\n\"The Alliance consists of powerful cultures and groups bound not by desperation or necessity, but by their deep commitments to abstract concepts like nobility and honor.\""}

Algalon the Observer has been sent to examine the situation and, if necessary, transmit a reply-code that will restructure the entire world, wiping out all of its current inhabitants.\"\nAbilities.\n25-man.\nAlgalon dual wields and his swing speed is extremely fast, with ~27,000 main hand and ~15,000 offhand swings coming every second or less. \nThe Collapsing Stars have 1,764,000 life in 25-man.\n10-man.\nAlgalon dual wields and his swing speed is extremely fast, with ~18,000 main hand and ~10,000 offhand swings coming every second or less.\nStrategy.\nPhase 1.\nAlgalon transforms the arena into space and immediately begins attacking the player with the highest threat. Algalon hits very hard and fast; he casts Quantum Strike on the tank with high frequency, so healers must ensure that the tank remains at full health at all times. All DPS merely attack the boss the best they can. Algalon can be positioned anywhere, as he has no frontal cleave or cone attacks.\nAfter 15 seconds, Algalon begins casting Phase Punch on the current tank every 15 seconds and also summons four &lt;a href=\"Collapsing%20Star\"&gt;Collapsing Star&lt;/a&gt;s. Once the tank gets 5 stacks of the Phase Punch debuff, that tank is ported out for 10 seconds as if he stepped into a Black Hole, whereupon the debuff is completely removed. Algalon then switches to the second highest on his threat table. Your off-tank should be ready to taunt, with healers ready to change targets, as the off-tank begins taking substantial damage very quickly. Algalon will be Phase Punching the tanks throughout the fight; tanks must keep switching after.\nAssign one or two ranged DPS to kill the Collapsing Stars one at a time. Since they slowly lose health on their own (1% health per second), if left alone, they will all explode at the same time and wipe the raid. Alert the healers so they are ready before a Collapsing Star is killed, as the entire raid takes roughly 16,000 shadow damage regardless of positioning (a tank who is too low on health when a star explodes can die and likely cause a wipe). When a star dies, it leaves behind a Black Hole, which is both a void zone and a portal to another realm. Collapsing Stars keep spawning throughout the fight until Phase 2 and should always be killed.\nEvery 25 seconds, Algalon casts Cosmic Smash on a random player, including a tank. This appears as a red fissure, which explodes after a few seconds. Everyone\u2014not just the targeted player\u2014should move away from the red fissure, as it causes splash Fire damage, based on player distance with the impact point.\nNote: On 25-man, Algalon casts three separate Cosmic Smashes on three random players.\nFifty seconds after the initial pull, Algalon summons three &lt;a href=\"Living%20Constellation\"&gt;Living Constellation&lt;/a&gt;s that cast Arcane Barrage on random players and have normal threat tables. It is unnecessary to DPS a Living Constellation. Instead, a single player can aggro these and run behind any available Black Hole, as any Living Constellation that passes through a Black Hole dies instantly, causing that Black Hole to disappear. The player assigned to do this should be careful to run \"around\" a Black Hole instead of through it to avoid being portaled. Death Knights are an ideal choice for this, as they can stand behind Black Holes and use Death Grip to pull the Constellations into the hole. \nEvery 90 seconds from the initial pull, Algalon begins casting an 8-second lethal spell called Big Bang. To avoid getting hit by Big Bang, everyone must enter a Black Hole created by a killed Collapsing Star \"except for one person\". For this reason, all players should be aware of the location of remaining Black Holes after Living Constellations are killed. Players need not enter the same Black Hole as everyone else; all Black Holes lead to the same dark realm. Once inside the Black Hole, players take roughly 1,500 Shadow damage per second and must avoid elite adds called &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Matter%20%28Ulduar%29\"&gt;Dark Matter&lt;/a&gt; scattered throughout the realm until Algalon finishes casting Big Bang, and automatically portals everyone back to the normal realm.\nIf \"everyone\" enters the Black Holes and Algalon has no player in the normal realm to target, he kills the raid with Ascend to the Heavens, then resets. For this reason, one player must remain in the normal realm to eat the Big Bang. A player protected with a Holy Priest's &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20Spirit\"&gt;Guardian Spirit&lt;/a&gt;, a Shadow Priest casting &lt;a href=\"Dispersion\"&gt;Dispersion&lt;/a&gt;, a Fire Mage with &lt;a href=\"Cauterize\"&gt;Cauterize&lt;/a&gt;, or a tank blowing \"all\" cooldowns are all capable of eating the Big Bang. Note: Big Bang ignores immunity effects such as Hand of Protection, Ice Block, and Divine Shield.\nEntering a Black Hole also resets all threat of the player. If the currently Phase Punched tank stays outside to eat the Big Bang, the off-tank can taunt to gain all the threat he had upon return to the normal realm, ensuring that the rest of the raid doesn't pull aggro.\nThis phase continues until Algalon reaches 20%.\nPhase 2.\nWhen Algalon reaches 20%, Collapsing Stars and Living Constellations despawn and stop respawning, and all open Black Holes disappear. Algalon continues to cast Quantum Strike, Phase Punch, Cosmic Smash, and Big Bang.\nAlgalon then summons four new Black Holes in a square pattern. Every 30 seconds, four Unleashed Dark Matters will spawn, one from each Black Hole. The off-tank needs to pick these up and tank them to the side for the rest of the fight, and DPS must burn down Algalon before these adds pile up and become too much to handle.\nWhen this phase begins, consider swapping tanks, as the current tank will very likely have the Phase Punch debuff and the off-tank will have a hard time surviving if he has to tank the adds and Algalon together. If you swap once the Black Holes spawn, you'll be given about 45 seconds to defeat Algalon before a forced tank-swap which should be long enough. Players also need to keep alert about Cosmic Smashes as Algalon will still be using this.\nOnce Algalon reaches 1-2%, he is defeated, all adds and Black Holes despawn.\nQuotes.\nSound Files.\nSee \"&lt;a href=\"PlaySoundFile%20macros%20-%20Ulduar%23.C2.A0Algalon%20the%20Observer\"&gt;Sound Files of Ulduar: Algalon the Observer&lt;/a&gt;\"\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

The site is owned by &lt;a href=\"Maynard%20Algerson\"&gt;Maynard Algerson&lt;/a&gt;, and is regarded as the largest of its kind on &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;. It has traditionally supplied timber for the construction of vessels for the &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiran%20fleet\"&gt;Kul Tiran fleet&lt;/a&gt;, notably those of &lt;a href=\"Dorian%20Atwater\"&gt;Dorian Atwater&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the lumber yard was overrun by &lt;a href=\"wicker%20construct\"&gt;wicker construct&lt;/a&gt;s sent by the &lt;a href=\"Witch%20of%20the%20Woods\"&gt;Witch of the Woods&lt;/a&gt;, while also attracting the attention of Kul Tiras's &lt;a href=\"Thornspeakers\"&gt;Thornspeakers&lt;/a&gt;. Throughout these woes, Maynard Algerson himself has remained bizarrely ignorant of the problems threatening the site, by his own choice.\nProducts of the Algerson Lumber Yard are marketed in nearby Boralus, through &lt;a href=\"Algersons%20%26amp%3B%20Sons%20Lumber%20Co.\"&gt;Algersons &amp; Sons Lumber Co.&lt;/a&gt;\nHistory.\nAs the &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiran%20civil%20war\"&gt;Kul Tiran civil war&lt;/a&gt; began to erupt across the continent, the Algerson Lumber Yard came under attack from a very different direction. &lt;a href=\"Wicker%20construct\"&gt;Wicker construct&lt;/a&gt;s, formed from the trees themselves, descended upon the site and began assaulting the &lt;a href=\"Algerson%20Lumberjack\"&gt;lumberjacks&lt;/a&gt;. This was coupled with the threat of giant &lt;a href=\"Enthralled%20Mossfang\"&gt;spiders&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Enthralled%20Ashclaw\"&gt;bears&lt;/a&gt; encroaching from the nearby &lt;a href=\"Fernwood%20Ridge\"&gt;Fernwood Ridge&lt;/a&gt;. As a result, work in the lumber yard ground to a halt, though &lt;a href=\"Maynard%20Algerson\"&gt;Maynard Algerson&lt;/a&gt; himself refused to believe reports of the situation. Instead, Algerson remained within his office, disparaging his employees for their apparent laziness.\nIt was only with the aid of a &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champion&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, recruited by Maynard's son &lt;a href=\"Benjamin%20Algerson\"&gt;Benjamin&lt;/a&gt;, that the issues began to be tackled. Only after the thinning of the wicker beasts' numbers and protecting of the yard's workers was Maynard finally convinced of the threat, though Benjamin would be the one to investigate further by venturing into Fernwood Ridge alone.\nAt the same time, a member of the &lt;a href=\"Thornspeakers\"&gt;Thornspeakers&lt;/a&gt; known as &lt;a href=\"Lyssa%20Treewarden\"&gt;Lyssa Treewarden&lt;/a&gt; made her presence in the nearby woods known, also recruiting the Alliance hero to aid her in restoring the nearby woods. Though she was not responsible for the attacks on the lumber yard, Lyssa became determined to work against the rampant destruction causes by Algerson's operations.\nFreeing workers trapped in Fernwood Ridge and killing many of the enthralled beasts there finally revealed the source of the chaos gripping the area: a mysterious &lt;a href=\"witch\"&gt;witch&lt;/a&gt;, referred to as the \"Witch of the Woods\". Having been told this information by Benjamin, Maynard himself ventured out to confront the threat alongside the Alliance hero. At &lt;a href=\"Evergreen%20Grove\"&gt;Evergreen Grove&lt;/a&gt;, they confronted the spellcaster, who revealed herself to be Maynard's wife, &lt;a href=\"Petula%20Algerson\"&gt;Petula&lt;/a&gt;. She sought to end her husband's exploitation of his workers and, refusing to surrender, was cut down. With Petula's death, the immediate threat to the lumber yard was dealt with, though the haunting of the nearby woods would continue.\nLater, the Algerson Lumber Yard would be chosen once again by &lt;a href=\"Dorian%20Atwater\"&gt;Dorian Atwater&lt;/a&gt; as a source of lumber for her ships, when she was commissioned to construct a new flagship for the High King of the Alliance, &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;. Atwater would journey there along with an Alliance champion and several workers to gather a suitable shipment of timber, battling the lingering wicker beasts as they did so. They would soon discover, however, that the Algerson timber itself was still haunted, and would require purifying before it could be put to use.\nInhabitants.\nNamed.\n\"During &lt;a href=\"Frame%20Work\"&gt;Frame Work&lt;/a&gt;:\""}

Though it fell dormant with the rest of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;, it has recently reopened and is back under the guidance of &lt;a href=\"Headteacher%20Doragosa\"&gt;Headteacher Doragosa&lt;/a&gt;. In a series of exciting, new changes, the &lt;a href=\"Academy\"&gt;Academy&lt;/a&gt; is currently seeking new students from all walks of life, not just dragons, as well as volunteers, to help get it back to the bustling halls of education it once was. Those who walk the Academy grounds are sure to learn something new.\nHistory.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;s had to leave the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Headteacher%20Doragosa\"&gt;Headteacher Doragosa&lt;/a&gt; thought of everything and created a complex simulacrum of herself to take care of any day to day tasks and upkeep while the isles laid dormant.\nAt some point, &lt;a href=\"Professor%20Gastrinax\"&gt;Professor Gastrinax&lt;/a&gt; was an emeritus of the Algeth'ar Academy until he was expelled by Headteacher Doragosa and the professors for his dangerous experiments.\nDragonflight.\nAfter the return of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;, the Algeth'ar Academy was open to the world once more. Long ago, its sacred halls were only open to dragons, but in the years that have passed &lt;a href=\"Headteacher%20Doragosa\"&gt;Headteacher Doragosa&lt;/a&gt; saw the wisdom of welcoming any who wish to learn, and asked for &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt;'s recommendation on any promising new students. As great allies to dragonkind, the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s received the honor to attend the school. Other visitors also received this honor, including &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Vargoth\"&gt;Archmage Vargoth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chief%20Telemancer%20Oculeth\"&gt;Chief Telemancer Oculeth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Scrollsage%20Nola\"&gt;Scrollsage Nola&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Naralex\"&gt;Naralex&lt;/a&gt; who could be seen chatting with a few professors.\nDuring their visit, the adventurers had to help solve some problems within the academy. In an effort to clear the botany labs, &lt;a href=\"Professor%20Mystakria\"&gt;Professor Mystakria&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Professor%20Ichistrasz\"&gt;Professor Ichistrasz&lt;/a&gt; used too much &lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;life magic&lt;/a&gt;, creating an &lt;a href=\"Overgrown%20Ancient\"&gt;Overgrown Ancient&lt;/a&gt; that threatened to undo all their hard work in the &lt;a href=\"Botanica%20%28Algeth%27ar%20Academy%29\"&gt;Botanica&lt;/a&gt;. Without maintenance, the Lish Llrath arena was invaded by birds, notably &lt;a href=\"Crawth\"&gt;Crawth&lt;/a&gt; who took up residence in the center of the &lt;a href=\"Pitch%20%28Algeth%27ar%20Academy%29\"&gt;Pitch&lt;/a&gt; and had no intention of moving. When the academy staff later tried to use Doragosa's simulacrum to help keep track of all the new students, they dicovered that the spell was degraded after all these years, causing it to become violent and unstable. The academy regained its calm after they were done with the threats.\nFollowing the official reopening, the academy's staff made several orders to artisans in &lt;a href=\"Valdrakken\"&gt;Valdrakken&lt;/a&gt; for supplies, including alchemic solutions for the future exams, and enchanting rods for the enchantment formations. Some students also ordered several to play with. Headteacher Doragosa later asked the adventurers to assist some apprentices in their exams, especially to test their potions, which could have proved fatal for less accomplished people.\nWhen a time-displaced version of young &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; appeared in the &lt;a href=\"Everywhen%20Inn\"&gt;Everywhen Inn&lt;/a&gt;, his &lt;a href=\"Anduin%27s%20Lucky%20Hearthstone%20Card\"&gt;lucky card&lt;/a&gt; was stolen by &lt;a href=\"dragon%20whelp\"&gt;dragon whelp&lt;/a&gt;s who added it to their \"card tornado\" at the academy. The adventurer was sent to recover it, and once in his possession, the young prince took a portal home to his time.\nEducation.\nAs the dragonflights share their knowledge with one another at the Algeth'ar Academy, its entrance is marked by the banners of all five primary flights and the &lt;a href=\"Valdrakken%20Accord\"&gt;Valdrakken Accord&lt;/a&gt;. The dragon, &lt;a href=\"drakonid\"&gt;drakonid&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"dragonspawn\"&gt;dragonspawn&lt;/a&gt; students learn here to use their powers, but also study the history and magic of the other flights. At the same time, the &lt;a href=\"scholar\"&gt;scholar&lt;/a&gt;s continue to deepen their knowledge and to experiment in their own fields of study. The arrival of the &lt;a href=\"dracthyr\"&gt;dracthyr&lt;/a&gt; in the academy is appreciated, as even they are young, what they lack in experience they make up for with a boundless thirst for knowledge.\nRegistration.\nOnly those who are registered as a student can access the academy, which can be done at the official registrar or by being recommended as a promising student. When a student matriculates for their first year at the academy, they must join one of the five groups (named after the primary &lt;a href=\"dragonflight\"&gt;dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;s) present at their respective camp at the &lt;a href=\"Quad\"&gt;Quad&lt;/a&gt;. Depending on their choice, they will receive a pin surging with energy of the said flight in order to enhance their abilities, and to show their allegiance. Each flight has a common score of study points their members earn during the year, and the Blue Dragonflight is known for having maintained the highest grade point average of all the flights.\nSince the reopening, registrations are open to more than just dragons as well.\nFormation.\nA principle of the school is to teach by example, while the rating and performance system is based on letters with the mentions + or - (like the American academic grading). A year of study at the academy is divided into semesters. In case of bad behavior, points can be deducted. Most of the students can be seen studying for their future assignments, and some are even enclosed in personalized fields created by &lt;a href=\"Echonormu\"&gt;Echonormu&lt;/a&gt;, accelerating time inside in order to study more.\nAs one of the most tenured professors in the academy, &lt;a href=\"Professor%20Maxdormu\"&gt;Professor Maxdormu&lt;/a&gt; uses his powers as a &lt;a href=\"bronze%20dragon\"&gt;bronze dragon&lt;/a&gt; to help bring his history lessons to life. While this proves to be quite an educational and fun experience, it can occasionally go awry. &lt;a href=\"Vexamus\"&gt;Vexamus&lt;/a&gt; is one of his favorite lessons, but if any historical detail is inaccurate he will be quick to scold any rowdy students. He also teaches lessons on conflicts like the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Shifting%20Sands\"&gt;War of the Shifting Sands&lt;/a&gt;, using magical projections during his classes.\nAcross the school, a few professors can be seen teaching groups of students, such as &lt;a href=\"Professor%20Bilmorus\"&gt;Professor Bilmorus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Professor%20Dromokdormi\"&gt;Professor Dromokdormi&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Ochresera\"&gt;Ochresera&lt;/a&gt; notably serves as an oneiromancy instructor, while &lt;a href=\"Professor%20Intinosa\"&gt;Professor Intinosa&lt;/a&gt; is known as the Master of Illusions. &lt;a href=\"Professor%20Oxigos\"&gt;Professor Oxigos&lt;/a&gt; can be seen organizing dueling classes between students, especially in the use of defensive and &lt;a href=\"polymorph\"&gt;polymorph&lt;/a&gt;ism spells in combat tactics. &lt;a href=\"Talcorvius\"&gt;Talcorvius&lt;/a&gt; is in charge of the alchemy classes and exams. &lt;a href=\"Professor%20Saphigozi\"&gt;Professor Saphigozi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Professor%20Vatlinteth\"&gt;Professor Vatlinteth&lt;/a&gt; are academy artists who organize painting lessons with their students, calling on &lt;a href=\"Model%20%28Thaldraszus%29\"&gt;voluntary models&lt;/a&gt; to work with. &lt;a href=\"Professor%20Mystakria\"&gt;Professor Mystakria&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Professor%20Ichistrasz\"&gt;Professor Ichistrasz&lt;/a&gt; seem to specialize in the field of botany and &lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;life magic&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf for a long time the magic of the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragon\"&gt;black dragon&lt;/a&gt;s was feared due to the corruption of their flight by the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s, after the reopening of the academy, &lt;a href=\"Archivist%20Edress\"&gt;Archivist Edress&lt;/a&gt; received the opportunity to become a teacher. She is now able to pass her knowledge to a full class of students, with homework that requires grading, and is delighted that their ways will not be lost to the ravages of time.\nWhile cleaning the academy, a few &lt;a href=\"Unruly%20Textbook\"&gt;Unruly Textbook&lt;/a&gt;s attacked the adventurers and named some of their lesson chapters, including: \"The Founding Principles of Hornswog Evolution\", \"Ecological Impact of Djaradin Hunting Behaviors\", \"Idealism as Portrayed in the Dracthyr Renaissance\", and \"Chemical Structure and Properties of Decay Magic\".\nGestion.\nThe academy staff includes agents in charge of ensuring that the school functions as well as possible. The &lt;a href=\"Acadamy%20Attendant\"&gt;academy attendants&lt;/a&gt; are the most numerous agents, they can be seen protecting the academy, assisting the teachers in their classes, and cleaning the school alongside enchanted brooms. The &lt;a href=\"Academy%20Chef\"&gt;Academy Chef&lt;/a&gt; and his assistant &lt;a href=\"Stubert%20Sealgager\"&gt;Stubert Sealgager&lt;/a&gt; are in charge of preparing all the meals.\nBefore it was corrupted after centuries of operation, the &lt;a href=\"Echo%20of%20Doragosa\"&gt;Echo of Doragosa&lt;/a&gt; was created to take care of any day to day tasks and upkeep, notably to keep track of all the new students, while the isles laid dormant. In the event of an attack or intrusion into the academy, the simulacrum had the mission of protecting the premises and could summon &lt;a href=\"Algeth%27ar%20Security\"&gt;security&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Algeth%27ar%20Echoknight\"&gt;agents&lt;/a&gt; to help in its task.\nThe &lt;a href=\"red%20dragon\"&gt;red dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Cauteristrasz\"&gt;Cauteristrasz&lt;/a&gt; serves as the school's caretaker and treats injured students with the help of the &lt;a href=\"Academy%20Assistant\"&gt;academy assistants&lt;/a&gt;.\nManaged by &lt;a href=\"Zuligosa\"&gt;Zuligosa&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Late%20Night%20Lab\"&gt;Late Night Lab&lt;/a&gt; is an &lt;a href=\"inn\"&gt;inn&lt;/a&gt; and meeting place between students located at the &lt;a href=\"Algeth%27era%20Court\"&gt;Algeth'era Court&lt;/a&gt;. Inside, the &lt;a href=\"green%20dragon\"&gt;green dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bromithus\"&gt;Bromithus&lt;/a&gt; is a skilled botanist and an accomplished oneiromancer, who is as skilled at keeping people awake as in helping them to sleep. His coffee is not meant for mortal consumption, unless they want to remain sleepless for an entire moon. Conversely in the academy, &lt;a href=\"Dreamkeeper%20Y%27sani\"&gt;Dreamkeeper Y'sani&lt;/a&gt; specialize in tinctures and tonics to ease the burdens of the dragons, allowing them to sleep, as some of them have lived for a long time with a mind that refuses to forget the horrors that have beset &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; for ages upon ages.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Kemora\"&gt;Kemora&lt;/a&gt;, the academy's library is spectacular, as there are books there that even the &lt;a href=\"Azure%20Archives%20Annex\"&gt;Azure Archives Annex&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Valdrakken\"&gt;Valdrakken&lt;/a&gt; do not possess. Under the care of the librarian &lt;a href=\"Hopistella\"&gt;Hopistella&lt;/a&gt;, it is necessary for the academy's members to obtain a library card in order to borrow the books.\nActivities.\nEach flight has a team of players for the &lt;a href=\"Talon%20Toss\"&gt;Talon Toss&lt;/a&gt; Championships (or \"Lish Llrath\" in &lt;a href=\"Draconic\"&gt;Draconic&lt;/a&gt;), a sport played by &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"dragonkin\"&gt;dragonkin&lt;/a&gt; in the arena provided. Among the teams, the Black Dragonflight is represented by the Darkwings in the academy. According to &lt;a href=\"Headteacher%20Doragosa\"&gt;Headteacher Doragosa&lt;/a&gt;, if the students continue to hone their skills they will bring back the tournaments once more.\nThe students can also host parties, and the Red Dragonflight is known for making the best of them.\nThe academy also saw the opening of the &lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20club\"&gt;Hearthstone club&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href=\"Yumadormu\"&gt;Yumadormu&lt;/a&gt;'s efforts, who recruited among the &lt;a href=\"dracthyr\"&gt;dracthyr&lt;/a&gt;, dragons and mortals students to learn and play \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\". They have their own club room in the &lt;a href=\"Algeth%27ar%20Tower\"&gt;Algeth'ar Tower&lt;/a&gt;, with the necessary equipment and furniture for their activities."}

While Aliden was the rightful heir, the king of &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt; disagreed on making him the new king. &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil\"&gt;Terenas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; believed him to be an unfitting leader with no real experience.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; along with &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; came for the &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Medivh\"&gt;Book of Medivh&lt;/a&gt;, Aliden's father, &lt;a href=\"Aiden%20Perenolde\"&gt;Aiden&lt;/a&gt;, stole and traded it to the Horde for the independence of his lands (thus driving out the Alliance). Aliden was able to recognize the Horde's &lt;a href=\"Death%20knight%23Creations%20of%20Gul%27dan\"&gt;death knights&lt;/a&gt;, indicating some sort of military familiarity. When Aliden saw what his father had done, he confronted him and punched him in the face. He claimed that his father had ruined everything, for Aliden wanted to redeem their surname's reputation from his father's betrayal. Prince Aliden's fears proved right, as no one supported his claim to the throne during the later &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20crisis\"&gt;Alterac crisis&lt;/a&gt;.\nAliden later rose through the ranks of the &lt;a href=\"Durnholde%20military\"&gt;Durnholde military&lt;/a&gt; under his mentor &lt;a href=\"Aedelas%20Blackmoore\"&gt;Aedelas Blackmoore&lt;/a&gt;, being friends with &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Skarloc\"&gt;Captain Skarloc&lt;/a&gt;. Aliden then decided to take up operations in the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac Mountains&lt;/a&gt; before the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nHaving become the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Syndicate\"&gt;Syndicate&lt;/a&gt;, Aliden was in charge of operations in the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. He strongly believed in slavery and sought to place the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; race back into chains \u2014 to return, in fact, to the days of Alliance &lt;a href=\"internment%20camp\"&gt;internment camp&lt;/a&gt;s. Also, like Aedelas Blackmoore, Lord Aliden had close ties with an orc named &lt;a href=\"Nagaz\"&gt;Nagaz&lt;/a&gt; (a member of the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20Wake\"&gt;Argus Wake&lt;/a&gt;), reminiscent of Blackmoore and his pet orc gladiator &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Gol%27dir\"&gt;Gol'dir&lt;/a&gt; learned Aliden's plans, he saw that Perenolde's mistress, &lt;a href=\"Elysa\"&gt;Elysa&lt;/a&gt;, was wearing the pendant &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; Thrall had been looking for. With this information, the orc &lt;a href=\"Krusk\"&gt;Krusk&lt;/a&gt; tasked &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to recover the necklace that had belonged to &lt;a href=\"Taretha%20Foxton\"&gt;Taretha Foxton&lt;/a&gt; and kill Aliden. The Horde champions traveled to &lt;a href=\"Dandred%27s%20Fold\"&gt;Dandred's Fold&lt;/a&gt;, killed Aliden Perenolde, and retrieved Taretha's necklace from the frightened mistress.\nIn the RPG.\nAliden Perenolde is the son of &lt;a href=\"Aiden%20Perenolde\"&gt;Aiden Perenolde&lt;/a&gt; and the heir to the throne of &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Alterac&lt;/a&gt;. He is in his 40s; though his body is strong, his grey hair shows his age. His clothing and armor often feature the &lt;a href=\"Perenolde%20family\"&gt;Perenolde&lt;/a&gt; crest. Aliden currently leads the &lt;a href=\"Syndicate\"&gt;Syndicate&lt;/a&gt;, a bandit group that includes Alterac's &lt;a href=\"Nobles%20of%20Alterac\"&gt;fallen nobles&lt;/a&gt; who seek to reclaim their kingdom.\nBiography.\nAliden Perenolde was told from an early age that he would succeed his father as lord of Alterac. He was just beginning to make a name for himself in court when the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; sacked their capital city for his father's misdeeds. &lt;a href=\"Aiden%20Perenolde\"&gt;Aiden Perenolde&lt;/a&gt; was ultimately imprisoned, and any other collaborators were stripped of their titles and property, then imprisoned or exiled. Aliden's status as heir apparent was forgotten yet, the young Lord Perenolde dreamed of reclaiming his ancestral lands. Years later, he got his chance.\nWhile his father was rotting in prison, Aliden attempted to assume command of the exiled Alteraci, and eventually, from these exiled the &lt;a href=\"Syndicate\"&gt;Syndicate&lt;/a&gt; would be born.\nThird War.\nAliden was not content to be a lowly highwayman. He had since grown into a man as charismatic and ambitious as his father. He realized he had to do something drastic to reclaim his ancestral lands. Thus, when the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; assaulted &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, he did not repeat his father's mistake by allying himself with the enemy. With the &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; kingdom crippled in the aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, he knew this was the time to strike. He convinced (or browbeat) the other nobles that this was the time for the Syndicate to attack openly and reclaim what was rightfully theirs. Simply taking advantage of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;'s distraction, Aliden and his forces moved on his lands in the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. The harried and panicked citizens, the people the nobles once ruled, were frightened and confused and put up little \ufb01ght, more concerned with the hellish creatures that rampaged over the land.\nIn the mind of Aliden Perenolde and his peers, it was the Alliance that betrayed them, and not the other way around.\nThe Syndicate.\nWhen Aliden came up with the idea to take advantage of the Alliance's crippled state and attack neighboring lands, the Syndicate came under his rule, grudgingly. Little organization seems to exist beyond that, although &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Falconcrest\"&gt;Lord Falconcrest&lt;/a&gt; (who does not trust Aliden) has taken command in the &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands\"&gt;Arathi Highlands&lt;/a&gt;. The Syndicate suffers from pride and jealousy, each noble wishing to be in Perenolde's position. There is a lot of in\ufb01ghting.\nEven though the Syndicate regained much of its lands and more, Perenolde will not be satisfied until he takes &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20City\"&gt;Alterac City&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Crushridge\"&gt;Crushridge&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s, thus he has offered a great bounty to anyone who can reclaim his ancestral lands for him, though it is dubious he would honor such a bargain. One of the smarter decisions Perenolde made for the Syndicate was to break up the bandit gangs that joined them among the noble families, giving the bandits new allegiances so the gangs could not stay together to work against the nobles. This trick worked perfectly, and most bandits went along with it for the greater reward.\nThe noble households (gangs of criminals, really) hold only nominal loyalty to Perenolde or each other, and thus greater forces are rare. Lord Perenolde knows he is a target for the nobles who chafe under his rule (including his children) and protects himself accordingly."}

Despite arcane wards restricting her powers, the demon's malicious influence alone caused her guards to murder one another in sudden fits of rage. Her transfer to Baradin Hold prior to the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; has only aggravated the ruined prison's increasingly dire conditions.\"\nStrategy.\nAs always, the main tank should run in and get aggro on the boss. The off-tank should stand directly beside or even on top of the main tank. The raid, including all healers, should stack at the boss\u2019s rear directly on top of one another. The reason for this positioning will become clear in Step 3.\nThe boss will periodically cast her Skewer ability on her current target, which will always be one of your raid\u2019s two tanks. When this happens, it is critical for the unaffected tank to taunt the boss. Failure to taunt the boss will likely result in a wipe as the boss will either kill the tanks or run wild in the raid. Either way, the outcome will be a wipe, so make sure that your tanks know when they are supposed to taunt and can do so quickly.\nEveryone, including the affected player, should remain stacked when the boss casts Seething Hate. This strategy will effectively mitigate the otherwise unsurvivable damage from this ability by distributing it between 8/23 players. Please note that even stepping a few yards away from the group can have devastating consequences as the damage is only distributed between players within 6 yards of the affected player.\nWhen the boss prepares to cast her Blade Dance ability, run away! Even the tanks should attempt to outrange this attack. Once the Blade Dance has ended, return to the positions described in Step 1.\nBurn the boss down, and collect the spoils of War(craft)!\nLoot.\nAlizabal drops &lt;a href=\"Season%2011\"&gt;Season 11&lt;/a&gt; PvP gear and &lt;a href=\"Tier%2013\"&gt;Tier 13&lt;/a&gt; hands and legs."}

The Crew has changed greatly since the show first launched. \nWhen \"All Things Azeroth\" started Medros and Lelia hosted the show with Medros doing all the editing as well. As time passed this limited staff resulted in the slow release of content, so other people were added. The crew now includes &lt;a href=\"http%3A//twitter.com/Medros\"&gt;Medros&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https%3A//twitter.com/rhowow\"&gt;Rho&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"https%3A//twitter.com/NananeaWoW\"&gt;Nananea&lt;/a&gt; hosting, &lt;a href=\"http%3A//twitter.com/shawno\"&gt;Shawn&lt;/a&gt; editing and &lt;a href=\"http%3A//twitter.com/queenofhaiku\"&gt;Jen&lt;/a&gt; moderating the chat of the live shows.

Unlike other demon hunters, she doesn't wield a pair of &lt;a href=\"warglaives\"&gt;warglaives&lt;/a&gt; but instead a weapon called the &lt;a href=\"Scythe%20of%20Souls\"&gt;Scythe of Souls&lt;/a&gt;. She is first seen in the &lt;a href=\"demon%20hunter%20starting%20experience\"&gt;demon hunter starting experience&lt;/a&gt;, on &lt;a href=\"Mardum%2C%20the%20Shattered%20Abyss\"&gt;Mardum, the Shattered Abyss&lt;/a&gt; and in the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20the%20Wardens\"&gt;Vault of the Wardens&lt;/a&gt;. All classes eventually encounter her at the &lt;a href=\"Illidari%20Stand\"&gt;Illidari Stand&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Azsuna\"&gt;Azsuna&lt;/a&gt;. For demon hunters, she is present aboard the \"&lt;a href=\"Fel%20Hammer\"&gt;Fel Hammer&lt;/a&gt;\".\nBiography.\nBefore embracing the fel and becoming a demon hunter, Allari practiced the arcane and presumably came to &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; with all the other blood elves who joined &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; on his quest. However, her fel magic prevents her from doing much of it and can only sometimes glimpse into faraway places. She would eventually recover an artifact known as the &lt;a href=\"Scythe%20of%20Souls\"&gt;Scythe of Souls&lt;/a&gt;. \nAllari was one of the demon hunters chosen by Illidan to retrieve the &lt;a href=\"Sargerite%20Keystone\"&gt;Sargerite Keystone&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Mardum%2C%20the%20Shattered%20Abyss\"&gt;Mardum&lt;/a&gt;. She is first encountered with &lt;a href=\"Questioner%20Arev%27naal\"&gt;Questioner Arev'naal&lt;/a&gt;, interrogating him. He tells her of the new demons known as &lt;a href=\"Jailer%20%28demon%29\"&gt;Jailer&lt;/a&gt;s and of captured demon hunters. After gaining enough information, she grabs &lt;a href=\"Questioner%20Arev%27naal\"&gt;Questioner Arev'naal&lt;/a&gt; and imprisoned him in her scythe. From one of the demons she investigated, she learns of a tome being held by an &lt;a href=\"imp%20mother\"&gt;imp mother&lt;/a&gt;. After stealing the tome, she reads from it and learns the ways of Havoc. \nAfter recovering the Sargerite Keystone, she travels back to the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt; where she find Illidan defeated. She is then imprisoned by &lt;a href=\"The%20Wardens\"&gt;the wardens&lt;/a&gt; along with her comrades. They where transported to the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20the%20Wardens\"&gt;Vault of the Wardens&lt;/a&gt;.\nYears later, she is freed from her crystallised prison and makes her way to the exit. Along the way, she helped re-imprison and take out some of the prisoners. \nAfter the blood elf demon hunters arrive in Orgrimmar to overhear the aftermath of the Broken Shore and witness the death of &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt;, she arrived to his funeral ceremony in the &lt;a href=\"Dranosh%27ar%20Blockade\"&gt;Dranosh'ar Blockade&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt; as the leader of the Illidari delegation. She helped to repulse the attack from the Burning Legion infiltrators. \nAllari was later sent to retrieve the &lt;a href=\"Aldrachi%20Warblades\"&gt;Aldrachi Warblades&lt;/a&gt; on the Broken Shore. Unfortunately she was overpowered by &lt;a href=\"Caria%20Felsoul\"&gt;Caria Felsoul&lt;/a&gt; and was left to die hanging on a column. She was rescued by a demon hunter and after a quick pause, both of them moved forward. They took out the demons &lt;a href=\"Gorgonnash\"&gt;Gorgonnash&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Doomherald%20Ak%27vesh\"&gt;Doomherald Ak'vesh&lt;/a&gt;. When the blades were recovered, Allari provided escort on &lt;a href=\"felbat\"&gt;felbat&lt;/a&gt;s and left the island before the demonic reinforcements arrived. \nIf Kayn Sunfury is the second in command of the demon hunters, Allari will use her powers to rip the Shade of Akama out from Akama.\nAllari is later seen in &lt;a href=\"Azsuna\"&gt;Azsuna&lt;/a&gt;, she is interrogating demons at the &lt;a href=\"Illidari%20Stand\"&gt;Illidari Stand&lt;/a&gt;. She had been capturing demon souls to try and gain information about the Burning Legion, but to no avail. The reason for this is thanks to the efforts of Questioner Arev'naal, who had been helping the demons resist. She decides to fight him inside her &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Gem%20%28Legion%29\"&gt;soul gem&lt;/a&gt; to get the whereabouts of Illidan's body. Unfortunately, the demon was slain before revealing it. The only thing he mentions it that the illidari are &lt;a href=\"Cyana%20Nightglaive\"&gt;betrayed from within&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Professor%20Pallin\"&gt;Professor Pallin&lt;/a&gt; wishes to create glyphs for demon hunters, but doesn't know much about them. He sends one of his students to meet with Allari to explain what it means to be a &lt;a href=\"demon%20hunter\"&gt;demon hunter&lt;/a&gt;. After proving their worth by observing and helping them kill the invading demons, she sends the scribe to &lt;a href=\"Baric%20Stormrunner\"&gt;Baric Stormrunner&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zaria%20Shadowheart\"&gt;Zaria Shadowheart&lt;/a&gt; to understand their class fully.\nOn the Fel Hammer, Allari helps restore the ship by capturing some souls to power it and helped locate the traitors &lt;a href=\"Caria%20Felsoul\"&gt;Caria Felsoul&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Varedis%20Felsoul\"&gt;Varedis Felsoul&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Niskara\"&gt;Niskara&lt;/a&gt;. She also had a discussion with &lt;a href=\"Loramus\"&gt;Loramus&lt;/a&gt; about making warglaives with &lt;a href=\"Obliterum\"&gt;Obliterum&lt;/a&gt;. She eventually becomes a champion of the Illidari.\nAllari is also the one who helps adventurers recover Illidan's soul by creating a &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Prism%20of%20the%20Illidari\"&gt;Soul Prism of the Illidari&lt;/a&gt;."}

One problem in particular was that if he found himself silenced, he couldn't cast spells with verbal components \u2013 that is to say most of his spells. To deal with this eventuality, he developed the &lt;a href=\"Voice%20Amplification%20Modulator\"&gt;voice amplification modulator&lt;/a&gt;, a technical device that replicated sounds as a series of vibrations.

After leaving the company in 2004, Adham returned to Blizzard in 2016. In 2018, he was made part of the company's \"executive leadership team.\"\nHistory.\nAdham states that he played videogames from \"a very early age,\" the first being \"Pong\". At fourteen he started writing code and making his own games, which he continued through high school and college.\nAfter enrolling in the computer science program at UCLA, and spending his summers in coding jobs on a number of successful games, Adham hit upon the idea of starting a gaming company of his own. Proposing \"something fun and different\", he convinced fellow students &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Morhaime\"&gt;Michael Morhaime&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Frank%20Pearce\"&gt;Frank Pearce&lt;/a&gt; to join him in creating Silicon &amp; Synapse, which would later change its name to Blizzard Entertainment.\nAdham served as the young company's \"executive producer\" or game director, leading top-level design decisions as well as programming for the company's early titles including \"\", and was the original lead designer for \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\", \"[setting] the course\" for the game's subsequent development. At the time, he was running both Blizzard and acting as the game's lead designer, working seven day, 14-16 hour weeks. In 2004 he left Blizzard, moving into the financial sector, which he described as \"another big form of video game\". Despite his career, Adham still found time to play \"every game Blizzard released\", including \"a lot of \"World of Warcraft\"\". Adham came to regret his decision in 2006, and has stated that in hindsight, he should have just taken a year off.\nAfter more than a decade away from the company, it was announced at &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon%202016\"&gt;BlizzCon 2016&lt;/a&gt; that Adham would be rejoining Blizzard. Adham states, \"I\u2019m free to say it now ... In hindsight, leaving Blizzard was probably the biggest mistake I made in my life. What I should have done was just take a sabbatical. I\u2019ve been eager to come back for a decade now.\" As of late 2016 Adham is working on new projects, or as he describes it, \"cool new stuff\". Some of these projects are new IPs."}

After absorbing the power of the dark naaru &lt;a href=\"L%27ura\"&gt;L'ura&lt;/a&gt; in the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Eredath\"&gt;Eredath&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;, Alleria became the first &lt;a href=\"void%20elf\"&gt;void elf&lt;/a&gt;, and now leads others like her in the Alliance following the defeat of the Legion.\nAlleria was one of the main protagonists in \"&lt;a href=\"Tides%20of%20Darkness\"&gt;Tides of Darkness&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Beyond%20the%20Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Beyond the Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"\".\nBiography.\nBackground.\nAlleria Windrunner was born the eldest child of &lt;a href=\"Lireesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Lireesa Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ranger-General%20of%20Silvermoon\"&gt;Ranger-General of Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Verath%20Windrunner\"&gt;Verath Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, Chief Adviser to &lt;a href=\"Anasterian%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Anasterian Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;. She was named after her &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner%20%28mother%20of%20Lireesa%29\"&gt;maternal grandmother&lt;/a&gt;. As well as her younger sister &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas&lt;/a&gt; and youngest sister &lt;a href=\"Vereesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Vereesa&lt;/a&gt;, she also had a younger brother named &lt;a href=\"Lirath%20Windrunner\"&gt;Lirath&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs the Windrunners' eldest scion, Alleria was raised to succeed her mother as ranger-general. But Alleria, who had little use for the traditions and expectations of the high elves, resented the fate Lireesa intended for her and challenged it with increasing resolve. Alleria chafed at the stagnation of Quel'Thalas and wished to see the world beyond; to meet other races and experience other cultures, and reconnect with the humans who had aided their people during the &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Wars\"&gt;Troll Wars&lt;/a&gt;. Lireesa held to the high elves' isolationism, believed all that mattered lay in Quel'Thalas, and considered any ancient quel'dorei debt to the humans well repaid.\nTo mark her training as Lireesa's heir, Alleria was summoned to take part in a grueling hunt for a mighty &lt;a href=\"Springpaw%20Lynx\"&gt;Springpaw Lynx&lt;/a&gt; known as &lt;a href=\"Mauler%20%28lynx%29\"&gt;Mauler&lt;/a&gt;. Her fellow &lt;a href=\"Farstriders\"&gt;Farstriders&lt;/a&gt; gathered to witness Alleria name her prey and depart deep into the wilds of Eversong in pursuit. Disaster followed: the huntress became the hunted as Alleria was overpowered by the beast, and her younger sister Sylvanas killed it to save her life. The act rendered the battle void, and robbed Alleria of the honor of avenging herself.\nAlleria's private war with her mother intensified in the years to come, and the Farstriders suffered for it. Alleria stole more time with her friends and confidants, and a rift formed between those rangers who shared Alleria's beliefs and Lireesa's loyalists. The tension came to a head when Alleria abdicated her claim to the title of ranger-general entirely, and revealed plans to leave the kingdom with her ranger company. She bluntly told her mother that she did not belong, and put forward Sylvanas as her replacement: a Windrunner surpassing even her own skill, with the support of &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar\"&gt;Lor'themar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Halduron\"&gt;Halduron&lt;/a&gt; and other key Farstriders. Lireesa bitterly acquiesced to Alleria's demands, finding in Sylvanas a Windrunner who would embrace the destiny Alleria had rejected. The ranger-general publicly released Alleria from her duties as ranger-general-in-training, bestowed them upon Sylvanas, and tasked her eldest daughter with ranging far beyond the kingdom's borders in order to establish a presence.\nBefore departing, Alleria reconciled with her mother and enjoyed one last tranquil night with her family. Lireesa gifted her eldest daughter a necklace - an exquisite piece containing an emerald, a ruby, and a sapphire. Alleria would wear this treasured necklace constantly. Alleria left Quel'Thalas with her ranger company \u2013 &lt;a href=\"Verana\"&gt;Verana&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rellian\"&gt;Rellian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Auric%20Sunchaser\"&gt;Auric&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Talthressar\"&gt;Talthressar&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 and struck out to see the world beyond.\nIn her absence, tragedy struck the Windrunner family: Lireesa and Verath were slain by agents of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;orcish Horde&lt;/a&gt; while on a diplomatic assignment in &lt;a href=\"Eastweald\"&gt;Eastweald&lt;/a&gt;. The Farstriders moved to formally recognize Sylvanas as their incumbent leader, but &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Helios\"&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; among them still favored Alleria, and claimed only the eldest Windrunner should inherit the title. &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Others&lt;/a&gt; declared that Alleria had chosen the wider world over Quel'Thalas, while Sylvanas fought only for the Farstriders, which reflected each of their loyalties. Others still would have gladly followed Alleria, but respected her decision to disinherit herself. Alleria returned in time to give her full support to Sylvanas, which silenced her sister's critics and ensured her unanimous election.\nReunited with her sisters, Alleria learned of &lt;a href=\"Anasterian%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Anasterian Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;'s forbearing policy concerning the emerging threat of the Horde, and was disappointed. She argued in favor of Lirath being trained to fight, as the fallen were as much his parents as theirs, but the teacher could not be her \u2013 Alleria's stay would be a brief one, as she was expected in Lordaeron. Alleria's friends in the Alliance would find few allies in Quel'Thalas, but Alleria was not shackled to the high elves' politics as Sylvanas was, and would return to face the threat growing in Lordaeron with or without a kingdom committed to war.\nTides of Darkness.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; invaded &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;Terenas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;, in the name of &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt; called upon the ancient debt the &lt;a href=\"Sunstrider\"&gt;Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;s owed the &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20tribe\"&gt;Arathi&lt;/a&gt; bloodline. The ruling council of Quel'Thalas, seeing the Horde as more of an excuse to fulfill that debt than an actual threat, sent a small force of elves to assist the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. Alleria was one of the few in Quel'Thalas who believed that the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; might pose a threat to the elves, and consequently chose to lead her rangers to &lt;a href=\"Southshore\"&gt;Southshore&lt;/a&gt; to join the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, despite not being ordered to do so.\nAlleria worked closely with &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; in the campaign to expel the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s from Lordaeron. Upon learning that the Horde burned the borderlands of Quel'Thalas, Alleria led the Alliance army to the defense of &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt;, briefly reuniting her with her sister &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas&lt;/a&gt; and comrades &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Halduron%20Brightwing\"&gt;Halduron Brightwing&lt;/a&gt;. Although Sylvanas had become ranger-general in Alleria's place, she granted Lireesa's bow, &lt;a href=\"Thas%27dorah%2C%20Legacy%20of%20the%20Windrunners\"&gt;Thas'dorah&lt;/a&gt;, to Alleria, trusting that her older sister would have better opportunities to exact vengeance on the front lines.\nWith Lor'themar, Alleria accompanied Turalyon to &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt; which was already under siege. However, the Horde later gave up and began to run away to the south. Alleria and Lor'themar returned home. Though they were successful in repelling the Horde invasion, it came at a terrible cost: eighteen of her kin, including her younger brother, &lt;a href=\"Lirath%20Windrunner\"&gt;Lirath&lt;/a&gt;, were killed. Devastated, Alleria sought comfort in the arms of Turalyon (eventually becoming pregnant with &lt;a href=\"Arator%20the%20Redeemer\"&gt;Arator&lt;/a&gt;), but ultimately, she chose to dedicate herself to revenge.\nBeyond the Dark Portal.\nTo the horror of her friends, Alleria came to see the orcs as little more than vermin to be exterminated. Driven by grief and hatred, Alleria vowed that she would have vengeance. Her pursuit of revenge took her into human lands, where she led an elite cadre of rangers in hunting down renegade orcs of the &lt;a href=\"Bleeding%20Hollow%20clan\"&gt;Bleeding Hollow clan&lt;/a&gt;, who had been trapped on Azeroth after the end of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;. Two years after the end of the war, Alleria was present in Nethergarde where she learned from Khadgar that the portal's rift is widening and that the Alliance army is needed again. The archmage sent her to Stormwind to warn Turalyon, which she reluctantly agreed to. By that time, Alleria had already given birth to Arator. She once watched her little child playing in the courtyard of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt; with a wooden sword, aiming at a &lt;a href=\"frog\"&gt;frog&lt;/a&gt; but hitting a pillar instead, during a frosty winter day. While another mother might have been proud, Alleria was saddened by the sight and told Arator that war was not glory.\nWhen the orcs rallied behind &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; and the death knights, Alleria agreed to lead her rangers beyond the Dark Portal into Draenor to exact vengeance for Quel'Thalas and stop the Horde once and for all. Before she left, she had her necklace melted down into three pieces. She kept the emerald for herself and sent the ruby to Vereesa and &lt;a href=\"The%20Lady%27s%20Necklace\"&gt;the sapphire&lt;/a&gt; to Sylvanas, using &lt;a href=\"Verana\"&gt;Verana&lt;/a&gt;, her lieutenant, as the emissary.\nThe Alliance reacted quickly to the renewed threat and sent an expedition through the portal to Draenor. Having achieved the rank of captain, Alleria was part of the expedition.\nOn Draenor, Alleria realized that there was more to the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Expedition\"&gt;Alliance Expedition&lt;/a&gt;'s struggle than her quest for vengeance. The final event that caused her to let go her hate and mourn for her loved ones was when Turaylon ordered her to stay back. Alleria found that she could not let go of the young human to his death and rekindled her relationship with &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt;, much to the relief of their friends. Following the fall of Hellfire Citadel, Alleria sent most of her forces with &lt;a href=\"Danath%20Trollbane\"&gt;Danath Trollbane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Talthressar\"&gt;Talthressar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kurdran%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Kurdran Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt; to pursue Ner'zhul, but herself accompanied Khadgar and Turalyon to retrieve the &lt;a href=\"Skull%20of%20Gul%27dan\"&gt;Skull of Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;. She later aided in defending Khadgar when he finally closed the last Dark Portal to Azeroth, after which Draenor itself was sundered in a fiery cataclysm, sacrificing her way home. Alleria, along with her surviving allies, entered a rift to the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;.\nGiven the low likelihood of their survival, Alleria and her comrades were presumed dead, killed in the line of duty. They are honored to this day for their sacrifice. A statue of Alleria has a prominent place in the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Heroes\"&gt;Valley of Heroes&lt;/a&gt;, just inside the gates of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;.\nA Thousand Years of War.\nAlleria and Turalyon ended up elsewhere on Draenor, in an area of the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; that was beginning to merge with the self-destructing world. They were found by &lt;a href=\"Lothraxion\"&gt;Lothraxion&lt;/a&gt;, a former member of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; who had joined the &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Army of the Light&lt;/a&gt;. Lothraxion told them that they were fated to do battle against the Legion, and he had been sent to find them. However, the Legion had also dispatched an &lt;a href=\"Eradication%20%28eredar%29\"&gt;assassin&lt;/a&gt; to kill them. After Alleria made short work of the assassin, the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Xe%27ra\"&gt;Xe'ra&lt;/a&gt; appeared before the two and told them that, though the Burning Legion had failed to enter Azeroth during the Second War, they would soon succeed in doing so. Alleria, wishing to see their son &lt;a href=\"Arator%20the%20Redeemer\"&gt;Arator&lt;/a&gt; once more, pushed Xe'ra to send them to Azeroth to rally the disparate nations to stand against the Legion. Xe'ra told them their aid would not be enough, but that they would be needed to do battle against the Legion elsewhere and were fated to discover the \"Emerald Star,\" which held the means to end the Legion forever. The two then agreed with the necessity of Xe'ra's request and stepped through a portal to join the Army of Light.\nTuralyon and Alleria trained aboard the Army's &lt;a href=\"dimensional%20ship\"&gt;dimensional ship&lt;/a&gt;, the \"&lt;a href=\"Xenedar\"&gt;Xenedar&lt;/a&gt;\". While Turalyon was being infused with the Light by Xe'ra, granting him immortality, Alleria was able to catch a glimpse of a ceremony within the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Heroes\"&gt;Valley of Heroes&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;, where she saw Sylvanas and her son Arator. Using the Light, Alleria sent her feelings to her son and when he received her emotions the young Arator looked around, smiled, and then reached out to her statue.\nSometime later the Army of the Light raided a small Legion prison world only to discover all the demons permanently dead due to the &lt;a href=\"void\"&gt;void&lt;/a&gt;. While looking for survivors Alleria was attacked and infected with the void, which granted her visions. Alleria soon became fascinated with the void and asked Lothraxion to reveal to her all that he knew of it. It was during this time that Alleria learned about the &lt;a href=\"Locus-Walker\"&gt;Locus-Walker&lt;/a&gt;, a mysterious being who was a powerful master of the void and yet fear its grasp. Convinced that the void would be useful to the fight against the Legion, Alleria revealed to Xe'ra that she wanted to find the Locus-Walker and others like him. While she expected resistance to her plan, Alleria was shocked to be delivered an ultimatum and while she did agree to Xe'ra's wishes, she never forgot her visions or beliefs.\nEventually, the Burning Legion invaded the remains of Draenor, now known as &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. As time flowed differently within the Twisting Nether, the 20 years that had passed on Azeroth translated into more than 500 years for Alleria. Convinced that this is the moment she had been waiting for, Alleria told Xe'ra of a vision she had seen of herself walking on the Legion stronghold world of &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;, and that in this vision she had seen the Emerald Star. With Argus's defenses diminished by their invasion, Xe'ra recognized that there would be no better chance and sent Alleria and Turalyon to discover the truth of the Emerald Star. En route, Alleria privately told Turalyon that her visions were sent not by the Light, but by &lt;a href=\"void\"&gt;another force&lt;/a&gt; that Xe'ra would object to. Turalyon told her that while he respected Xe'ra's wisdom, he trusted Alleria's instincts more and welcomed any help against the Burning Legion. As they explored Argus, Alleria was struck by a vision sent by the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20%28titan%29\"&gt;titan world soul&lt;/a&gt; at the heart of Argus: \"it\" was the Emerald Star that was reviving slain demons of the Burning Legion. Though Turalyon did not see the vision, he spoke aloud a pledge to return and free the world soul from the Legion's imprisonment. When they returned to their transport, though, they found it surrounded by demons intent on capturing them. Though they struck down many demons with the Light, their defeat appeared certain until Alleria called instead upon the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;, striking down the demons and opening a shadowy rift. Turalyon, who had become one with the Light, felt agonizing pain as she dragged him through it to a floating rock far away in the Twisting Nether. Dismayed at what she had done, he reached out to her only for their hands to burn at each others' touch. Alleria told him that she was not his enemy and to return to the \"Xenedar,\" and Turalyon watched in tears as she departed through another shadowy portal.\nShe would be captured by the Legion and held on &lt;a href=\"Niskara\"&gt;Niskara&lt;/a&gt; with the Locus-Walker as her fellow prisoner. When Locus-Walker was captured by the Legion, the wrappings containing his energy body had been destroyed. After Alleria used his teachings to kill the &lt;a href=\"inquisitor\"&gt;inquisitor&lt;/a&gt; torturing them, Locus-Walker opened a Void rift for them to escape. On the other side was utter nothingness, the Void itself. Their first lesson was about maintaining Alleria's sanity while using the Void's power. Throughout her training Locus-Walker delved into her memories. He explained to her the duality of Light and Shadow, how the Light cannot see the whole of destiny because it alone is not responsible for it; likewise, the shadow cannot see all of destiny either. He explained how the shadow sees the Light as nothing but horrors, just as the Light sees the shadow, and how neither is true nor wrong. How the Light seeks one path and shuns all others as lies, while the Void seeks every possible path and sees them all as truth. Through Locus-Walker's training, Alleria was able to see destiny that both the Light and Shadow could not see.\nBut Alleria also realized she was delving into the Void too soon before her destiny demanded it. Seeing a vision of Turalyon presently being attacked by an &lt;a href=\"eredar\"&gt;eredar&lt;/a&gt; attempting to steal his soul as a prize, she tried to have Locus-Walker let her go. When he refused as they were not done, she attacked him to force the lesson to be cut short. Furious, Locus-Walker declared her a coward and he should have expected no less. Though he began to gather power to strike back at her, he stopped when he heard what Alleria's vision was and, laughing, said she had made a very determined enemy; Alleria wasn't sure if that meant Locus-Walker or the eredar. Deciding she may have a unique destiny Locus-Walker acquiesced, allowing Alleria to go save her husband. But he believed they would meet again.\nAfter she arrived Alleria drove off the assassin, but could not stop the soulstone from draining Turalyon's soul. She instead used the Void to rip the assassin's poison out of Lothraxion, who saved Turalyon's soul and cleansed the poison from him in turn. After killing &lt;a href=\"Eradication%20%28eredar%29\"&gt;the assassin&lt;/a&gt; with the void Turalyon warned her to leave, as Xe'ra would not accept her use of the Void. However, Alleria refused to leave and when the naaru arrived Turalyon and Lothraxion pled for mercy for Alleria. While their pleas were successful, when Alleria refused to renounce the Void, Xe'ra imprisoned her.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nA &lt;a href=\"Cowled%20Ranger\"&gt;Cowled Ranger&lt;/a&gt; sometimes visits the inn in players' &lt;a href=\"garrison\"&gt;garrison&lt;/a&gt;s and tasks them with finding high elf weaponry, which takes the form of &lt;a href=\"Silver-Lined%20Arrow\"&gt;Silver-Lined Arrow&lt;/a&gt; in the Void-infested &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Burial%20Grounds\"&gt;Shadowmoon Burial Grounds&lt;/a&gt;. Subsequently, the ranger will reveal that she is looking for Alleria and states that she had faintly hoped that the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; would have somehow brought Alleria to the &lt;a href=\"Draenor%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;alternate Draenor&lt;/a&gt;. While it's never made clear whether or not the Silver-Lined Arrows actually belonged to Alleria, their presence in the Shadowmoon Burial Grounds appears to have served as the first hint at both Alleria's return, and a connection between Alleria and the Void.\nLegion.\nAfter years of fruitless research into Alleria's whereabouts, the first lead is presented in the form of a demon who, under torture from the &lt;a href=\"Farstriders\"&gt;Farstriders&lt;/a&gt;, claimed that Alleria was held captive by the &lt;a href=\"inquisitor\"&gt;inquisitor&lt;/a&gt; demons on the Legion portal world of &lt;a href=\"Niskara\"&gt;Niskara&lt;/a&gt;. Vereesa, joining forces with the Farstriders, forms a team to track the elder Windrunner down and prevent the Legion from gaining her fabled weapon. Although her bow &lt;a href=\"Thas%27dorah%2C%20Legacy%20of%20the%20Windrunners\"&gt;Thas'dorah, Legacy of the Windrunners&lt;/a&gt; is recovered and Vereesa gives her blessing for the new soon-to-be leader of the &lt;a href=\"Unseen%20Path\"&gt;Unseen Path&lt;/a&gt; to use it, Alleria herself is nowhere to be found. Vereesa concludes that she must have escaped, and resolves to continue the search in the future. Thas'dorah's recovery renews hope that Alleria had survived the destruction of Draenor, and Vereesa believes that her eldest sister has continued her war against evil by hunting the Burning Legion itself, pursuing it into the deepest recesses of the Twisting Nether.\n&lt;a href=\"Lothraxion\"&gt;Lothraxion&lt;/a&gt; says that he serves Turalyon and Alleria in the &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Grand Army of the Light&lt;/a&gt;.\nArgus.\nJust before the \"Xenedar\" was shot down on &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;, Alleria was last known to still be imprisoned and under guard, but Turalyon was certain she would be one of the survivors, and she soon appeared to aid her husband and an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; from Azeroth in defeating &lt;a href=\"Aggonar\"&gt;Aggonar&lt;/a&gt;. In a reunion with her son &lt;a href=\"Arator%20the%20Redeemer\"&gt;Arator&lt;/a&gt; aboard the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; dimensional ship the \"&lt;a href=\"Vindicaar\"&gt;Vindicaar&lt;/a&gt;\", Alleria stated that every choice she and Turalyon made was to keep him safe and that it broke their hearts to be apart from him. With their family reunited, Alleria vowed that she would not let them separate again. When Vereesa later informed Alleria that Sylvanas was now &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; of the Horde, Alleria refused to believe it after everything the Horde did to &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;their people&lt;/a&gt;. Vereesa was unsure of how to tell her that Sylvanas was also undead, or if it was even the right time or place to do so. When Alleria pressed her for answers, Vereesa decided the matter would be best discussed in private.\nVereesa would also inform her of the valiant efforts that the Huntmaster of the Unseen Path undertook during the mission to rescue her on Niskara. Speaking with the Huntmaster later herself, she gave her thanks for their risking themselves in the attempt. While she may need Thas'dorah back one day, she proclaimed the Huntmaster's skill with it brought honor to the weapon and the memory of its previous owners. With her own path going in a different direction, she gave her blessing to wield it with pride as they had proven worthy of it.\nAlleria states reservations about rescuing the rest of Xe'ra's body from the \"Xenedar\"'s central chamber, concerned about being locked up again (or worse) but she nonetheless assists Turalyon in doing so. She is present aboard the \"&lt;a href=\"Vindicaar\"&gt;Vindicaar&lt;/a&gt;\" when &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; rejects and kills Xe'ra. Turalyon, enraged, attempts to strike the Betrayer down, while Alleria seems to be shocked by the fact that Illidan possessed enough power to destroy the prime naaru.\nIn a reunion with &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;, he informed Alleria and Turalyon that &lt;a href=\"Danath%20Trollbane\"&gt;Danath&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kurdran%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Kurdran&lt;/a&gt; were both still alive though he did not get to see them as often as he would like. The three agreed that when the fight was behind them the &lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Lothar\"&gt;Sons of Lothar&lt;/a&gt; would hold a reunion feast and that, at Alleria's insistence, it was Khadgar's turn to buy the drinks.\nWhen Velen and Turalyon discovered that the &lt;a href=\"Crest%20of%20Knowledge\"&gt;Crest of Knowledge&lt;/a&gt;, a piece of the &lt;a href=\"Crown%20of%20the%20Triumvirate\"&gt;Crown of the Triumvirate&lt;/a&gt;, was inside the &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20the%20Triumvirate\"&gt;Seat of the Triumvirate&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Eredath\"&gt;Eredath&lt;/a&gt;, Alleria told them that she had scouted the area and realized the darkened naaru &lt;a href=\"L%27ura\"&gt;L'ura&lt;/a&gt; had become a beacon calling the &lt;a href=\"Shadowguard\"&gt;Shadowguard&lt;/a&gt; ethereals to use her Void energies for their own ends. Alleria and an adventurer traveled to the ruins of Eredath, where they encountered &lt;a href=\"Broken\"&gt;Krokul&lt;/a&gt; being forcefully infused with the Void by the ethereals, despite the best efforts of &lt;a href=\"Arkhaan\"&gt;Arkhaan&lt;/a&gt; to prevent that. They ultimately ran into Alleria's teacher Locus-Walker. He explained that he had come to Argus to investigate what the Shadowguard, a group of ethereals who had tragically succumbed to the Void, were doing there. The Shadowguard, in turn, wanted to capture Locus-Walker before he could disrupt their efforts of making &lt;a href=\"Argus%20%28titan%29\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt; fall to darkness. After showing Alleria and the adventurer what the Shadowguard was up to, Locus-Walker confronted Alleria about Turalyon and what he thought of her use of shadow magic, asking how she could use it when the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; shone so brightly beside her. Alleria countered that without the Light, there is no Shadow.\nAfter taking care of the ethereals at the &lt;a href=\"Shadowguard%20Incursion\"&gt;Shadowguard Incursion&lt;/a&gt;, Locus-Walker decided to allow Alleria another opportunity to pursue her destiny. After slaying the &lt;a href=\"void%20revenant\"&gt;void revenant&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Nhal%27athoth\"&gt;Nhal'athoth&lt;/a&gt;, Locus-Walker retrieved its heart and gave it to Alleria, who consumed it. After telling Alleria that as long as her mind remained her own she could control the Void's power and that perhaps someday he would tell Alleria how he came to control it by himself, Locus-Walker took his leave.\nWithin the Seat of the Triumvirate, Alleria met up with Locus-Walker again. During the battle with &lt;a href=\"L%27ura\"&gt;L'ura&lt;/a&gt; he prompted Alleria to use the power of the Void rifts the dark naaru was opening, culminating in her absorbing L'ura's essence and transforming into a &lt;a href=\"Void%20elf\"&gt;Void state&lt;/a&gt;. After saying they needed to test the limits of her newfound power, Alleria and Locus-Walker left the Seat. When spoken to on the \"Vindicaar\" after the Crown of the Triumvirate is completed, Alleria states that she is in control of her new form, capable of turning it off and on of her own will.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; is imprisoned by the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20the%20Pantheon\"&gt;Seat of the Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;, Alleria speaks of how her heart soars to return to Azeroth with her family and see the forests of her homeland once more. However, she dreads the meeting with Sylvanas, but must see with her own eyes what her sister has become; Alleria wonders if she is even her sister any more, or some Light-forsaken monster. But Alleria acknowledges that she has also changed, and the powers she commands may cause some to question her loyalties. There is much for her to ponder, and she has to remain calm and focused.\nReturn to Azeroth.\nAt the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Heroes\"&gt;Valley of Heroes&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;, Alleria and Turalyon stood beneath the memorial statues that had been made for them after the destruction of Draenor, feeling unsettled. Alleria said that sometimes she felt as though she had already died twice, first at Draenor and then with L'ura. She wondered if death was the true legacy of the Windrunners. Turalyon knew she was anxious to meet Sylvanas no matter how she hid it, and while he told her she did not have to go, Alleria insisted that she did. She had to see her homeland with her own eyes and ask Sylvanas how she could ever wear the mantle of Warchief. Turalyon wanted Alleria to tell King &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; about her meeting with her sisters since it took place in Horde territory and involved the Horde's warchief, but Alleria argued that it was not a political meeting but a family affair taking place in their ancestral home.\nAlleria is present at the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Embassy\"&gt;Stormwind Embassy&lt;/a&gt; as part of the Alliance.\nThree Sisters.\nWhile touring &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Heroes\"&gt;Valley of Heroes&lt;/a&gt; with her lover &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt;, Alleria revealed her plans to attend a family reunion with her two other sisters in order to determine if she can still see them as her family after all that has transpired and also to see her place of birth, so she can liberate it from the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; that still prowls there. Turalyon couldn't help but notice that she was wearing her &lt;a href=\"The%20Lady%27s%20Necklace\"&gt;Emerald Windrunner locket&lt;/a&gt;, one of three nearly identical necklaces she had crafted in Stormwind and had gifted to her other sisters. Alleria created a &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; portal and bade Turalyon a fond farewell, telling him should she not return from this meeting alive, to give &lt;a href=\"Arator%20Windrunner\"&gt;Arator&lt;/a&gt; her love, all while ignoring the dark voices in her head tempting her to give up on her love for Turalyon and slay him.\nAlleria first met with &lt;a href=\"Vereesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Vereesa&lt;/a&gt; in Eversong, who she affectionately called her \"Little Moon\". With such golden hair, Vereesa said that it was only fitting that Alleria's nickname was \"Lady Sun\", although since her transformation with the Void, Alleria feels she can no longer bear that name. Alleria assured Vereesa she was not influenced by the Void's dark power and her love for her loved ones has kept her anchored, yet the dark whispers told Alleria that &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;'s throne is hers by right and to use the Void to corrupt Vereesa. Vereesa and Alleria catch up on what has transpired since Alleria was away, including the &lt;a href=\"Alliance-Horde%20war\"&gt;Alliance-Horde war&lt;/a&gt; escalated by &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; and the death of Vereesa's lover &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"Theramore%27s%20Fall\"&gt;Theramore's Fall&lt;/a&gt;. Vereesa mentioned that she had a brief reconnection with &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas&lt;/a&gt; when they plotted revenge against Garrosh during his trial in &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, but she had abandoned the plot and warned &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; who subsequently saved Garrosh from being poisoned. Although concerned about Sylvanas' darkness, returning to their homeland has given Alleria hope of them starting anew as she reminisces about happier times with her sisters and their fallen brother &lt;a href=\"Lirath%20Windrunner\"&gt;Lirath Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;. Sylvanas interrupted Alleria's nostalgia by locking hands with her as they did when they used to dance together. Alleria is startled by the undead creature Sylvanas has become and the Void's fanatic warnings of the danger Sylvanas poses and urgings to murder her. Alleria greets Sylvanas by her nickname, \"Lady Moon\".\nThey made their way to the undead portions of the &lt;a href=\"Ghostlands\"&gt;Ghostlands&lt;/a&gt; and Sylvanas told Alleria the tale of how &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; led the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; to desecrate the &lt;a href=\"kingdom%20of%20Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;kingdom of Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;. Sylvanas provided the Windrunner sisters &lt;a href=\"skeletal%20horse\"&gt;skeletal horse&lt;/a&gt;s as they proceeded to purging the undead they met in their path to their ancestral home of &lt;a href=\"Windrunner%20Spire\"&gt;Windrunner Spire&lt;/a&gt;. During their journey, the sisters played the game \"One is a lie\" in which they each made three statements with one being a lie. They eventually encountered &lt;a href=\"Goldenmist%20Village\"&gt;Goldenmist Village&lt;/a&gt; which was inhabited by &lt;a href=\"shade\"&gt;shade&lt;/a&gt;s of people they once knew. As the Windrunner sisters defended themselves against the attacking shades, Alleria accused Sylvanas of manipulating Vereesa into murdering Garrosh Hellscream. Sylvanas defended her character and revealed it was Vereesa's plan from the beginning and held Vereesa's lack of nerve responsible for the fallout of Garrosh's actions thereafter, including the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Sylvanas' rage culminated in her unleashing her banshee powers on one shade and brutally eviscerated it. Disgusted by Sylvanas' savage brutality, Alleria transformed into her &lt;a href=\"Entropic%20Embrace\"&gt;Void form&lt;/a&gt; to declare that the sister she once knew was gone, while the Void continued to give Alleria their fanatical urgings to murder Sylvanas. Sylvanas retorted she had no choice in becoming undead while Alleria abandoned them and chose to become a Void abomination. As the two sisters argued, Vereesa tried to dissipate the hostilities by refocusing their efforts in clearing their home of the undead and revealing the verdicts of their game. Alleria revealed her truths: she did miss her sisters and did not regret being away from Azeroth for so long. Her lie was she considered the Void a gift, in truth she sees it as a relentless struggle that she intends to conquer. When it was Sylvanas' turn to reveal her truths, she refused to continue the game. Alleria told Sylvanas to keep her secrets. Alleria stated that she came here to see if she still had a family because Lirath would have wanted her to try but it is clear to her that her family is broken, both with her sisters and the one in Stormwind. Alleria created a Void portal to return Vereesa and her home. Alleria then returned to her son and Turalyon.\nBefore the Storm.\nFollowing the death of King &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;'s manservant &lt;a href=\"Wyll%20Benton\"&gt;Wyll Benton&lt;/a&gt;, King Anduin would later summon his advisers along with Alleria and Turalyon to the &lt;a href=\"map%20room\"&gt;map room&lt;/a&gt; to unveil his plan for a &lt;a href=\"Gathering\"&gt;Gathering&lt;/a&gt; between the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; and their human loved ones. Alleria shared the story of her reunion with her sisters during the meeting and made it an example of reunions not going well. Alleria also stated she does not trust the rot riddled brains of the Forsaken to differentiate between friend or foe when facing their human counterparts. Furthermore, she advised Anduin to not put his faith in her sister &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas&lt;/a&gt;, as she has been in the darkness for far too long, and she believes it has eaten away all that was good in her. Due to these reasons, Alleria advised against going through with King Anduin's idea.\nVoid elves.\nWhen King &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; proclaimed that the Alliance needed allies in the face of war with the Horde, Alleria was determined to bring her people, the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;, back into the Alliance, believing that most would shrug off the Horde if given the chance. Alleria traveled to her homeland and had an audience with her old Farstrider comrade, &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;, now her much-changed homeland's regent lord. She arrived at roughly the same time as &lt;a href=\"First%20Arcanist%20Thalyssra\"&gt;First Arcanist Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt;, who had also come to Silvermoon to pursue an alliance. Lor'themar introduced Alleria as a hero of Silvermoon's past, and after exchanging pleasant courtesies with Thalyssra and &lt;a href=\"Liadrin\"&gt;Liadrin&lt;/a&gt;, Alleria presented her offer to the regent. Lor'themar reacted curtly to Alleria's words, saying that he'd hoped her visit was motivated by love for Silvermoon rather than an errand for the \"boy-king.\" Their parley quickly turned hostile, Alleria suggesting his words were Sylvanas', and Lor'themar raised the issue of her link to the &lt;a href=\"void\"&gt;void&lt;/a&gt; and its dangers. Alleria, accepting that her offer had been \"anticipated and spurned,\" then prepared to leave, but asked to see the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt; once more, as it had been a thousand years from her perspective. &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Rommath\"&gt;Rommath&lt;/a&gt; counseled against it, but Lor'themar overruled him, claiming that whatever else she'd become, Alleria was a daughter of Quel'Thalas and he would not deny her a pilgrimage to their people's most sacred site.\nAlleria was in awe of the restored Sunwell, acknowledging that while the same as she recalled, its energies were also different; Liadrin confirmed the presence of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; as well as the arcane sustains their people through the well now. As Alleria moved closer, the plateau erupted with void corruption, calling forth void beasts, and all those gathered rushed to do battle before the Sunwell was lost. Alleria fought off the creatures, including a mighty void horror named &lt;a href=\"Aruun%20the%20Darkener\"&gt;Aruun the Darkener&lt;/a&gt;, and moved to close a massive rift portal conjured by the unseen perpetrator of the attack. Combining her powers with Rommath and Thalyssra, Alleria successfully closed the rift, but Rommath, blaming her for the attack, furiously ordered her taken prisoner as a saboteur. Lor'themar intervened, instead banishing her, as her very presence posed a danger to Quel'Thalas. Yet before leaving, Alleria gleaned an important piece of information from Rommath: the existence of void-practicing blood elves who, like her, had been exiled for the danger the void poses to the Sunwell.\nReturning to Stormwind, Alleria revealed the outcome of her negotiations to Anduin and revealed what she'd learned of the exiles; she and the Alliance champion then returned to Quel'Thalas to track them down, both out of empathy for her brothers and sisters who may be in grave danger of the void's whispers, and to add their strength to the Alliance.\nAlleria arrived in the &lt;a href=\"Ghostlands\"&gt;Ghostlands&lt;/a&gt; and reflected on what had befallen her homeland in her many years absent. Following a trail of information left by &lt;a href=\"Magister%20Umbric\"&gt;Magister Umbric&lt;/a&gt;, a scholar with a deep interest in the void and the leader of the exiles, Alleria discovered a number of echoes detailing the disgraced magister's past and motivations, from his clash with Rommath to his discovery of a void world containing an item of great power over the shadows. Arriving at &lt;a href=\"Dawnstar%20Spire\"&gt;Dawnstar Spire&lt;/a&gt;, Alleria found the final piece of Umbric's story and opened a portal to the world she believed he sought, named the &lt;a href=\"Telogrus%20Rift\"&gt;Telogrus Rift&lt;/a&gt;. There, she came face-to-face with Umbric, who had learned of her own consumption of the void and was happy to welcome her. Alleria felt kinship with him, a fellow exile from Silvermoon.\nUmbric led Alleria to the item he and his people had uncovered and began a spell to unlock its powers, but the \"ritual\" was interrupted by &lt;a href=\"Nether-Prince%20Durzaan\"&gt;Nether-Prince Durzaan&lt;/a&gt;, the void-corrupted ethereal who had attacked Alleria at the Sunwell. Durzaan, desiring to corrupt the blood elves to the void, began a ritual to strip their mortality away and tempt them to succumb. Alleria, outraged, and wanting to protect her kin, fought a vicious battle against Durzaan while encouraging her people to fight the whispers; she also dismissed his attempts to compel Alleria to embrace the abyss herself. She and the champion slew Durzaan and freed her people, who had been transformed by the void. Umbric, altered by the shadow, stepped forward and thanked his Alleria for saving him from the void's full madness. Alleria offered to teach him and his fellow elves all she could to control the Void, and in return, he and their people - the &lt;a href=\"Void%20elf\"&gt;void elves&lt;/a&gt; - would fight for the Alliance. Umbric accepted Alleria's offer, stating that Silvermoon had turned its back on him long ago, and pledged his loyalty to Alleria, who became their new leader. and Umbric their main representative to the Alliance.\nTriumphant, Alleria returned to report her success, and the addition of the void elves to the Alliance's ranks. Telogrus Rift then became the elves' base of operations, and Alleria's teacher, Locus-Walker, traveled there to help her teach and train the void elves.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Battle for Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, void elf and &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt; forces led respectively by Alleria and &lt;a href=\"Gelbin%20Mekkatorque\"&gt;Gelbin Mekkatorque&lt;/a&gt; warped in through Void portals at a decisive moment, saving the Alliance from a larger undead army. She personally confronted &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller\"&gt;Nathanos Blightcaller&lt;/a&gt;, and when she cornered Sylvanas alongside Anduin, Alleria regretted not to have killed her sister the last time they met.\nAlleria can be found aboard the \"&lt;a href=\"Wind%27s%20Redemption\"&gt;Wind's Redemption&lt;/a&gt;\" docked at Boralus, where she comments that she is very impressed by &lt;a href=\"Halford%20Wyrmbane\"&gt;Halford Wyrmbane&lt;/a&gt; and his adaptability. When Wyrmbane and &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt; disagreed on whether to pursue &lt;a href=\"Jastor%20Gallywix\"&gt;Jastor Gallywix&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Prince%20Dreven\"&gt;Blood Prince Dreven&lt;/a&gt; in the Alliance's war effort against the Horde, Alleria came in to tell them that both could be done: Alleria's void elf forces led by &lt;a href=\"Magister%20Umbric\"&gt;Magister Umbric&lt;/a&gt; could focus on Gallywix while Shandris focused on Dreven.\nAlleria, along with Turalyon and other Alliance leaders, was present on the &lt;a href=\"Anduin%27s%20vessel\"&gt;Kul Tiran vessel&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Harbor\"&gt;Stormwind Harbor&lt;/a&gt;, when Anduin officially declared the &lt;a href=\"Admiralty%20of%20Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Admiralty of Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; member of the Alliance.\nSeeking to protect Azeroth and defeat Sylvanas once and for all, Horde revolutionaries led by &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; and the Alliance planned to strike at &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, setting up camp in &lt;a href=\"Razor%20Hill\"&gt;Razor Hill&lt;/a&gt;. However, before combined Horde-Alliance forces could strike against &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20loyalists\"&gt;Sylvanas's forces&lt;/a&gt;, Varok and Anduin were approached by Alleria and Vereesa. Sensing that &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt; had been freed, Alleria revealed her belief that Sylvanas commanded what may be the only army capable of defeating the old god, and thus she suggested that the Alliance and Horde revolutionaries stand aside and let her. In response, Anduin was quick to point out that Sylvanas wouldn't fight for them, and that she had lured both fleets into &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt;'s hands to meet death when the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;war&lt;/a&gt; seemed to be on the cusp of ending. Remarking that they couldn't fight two wars at once, Anduin told her that Sylvanas must fall here and now, before all is lost. Swayed by Anduin's argument, Alleria declared that she and Vereesa would scout Sylvanas's lines for weaknesses.\nThough Alleria was prepared to face against Sylvanas's forces, Varok Saurfang, recognizing Sylvanas's loyalists as his brothers and sisters in the Horde and unwilling to spill more Horde blood, challenged Sylvanas to &lt;a href=\"Mak%27gora\"&gt;Mak'gora&lt;/a&gt;. During the duel, Saurfang was able to get Sylvanas to admit that she considered the Horde nothing, which caused the Warchief to swiftly kill him and abandoned the Horde altogether. With Sylvanas's defection, the Horde united once more with Sylvanas's former loyalists defecting to Saurfang's revolution. With Saurfang dead and Sylvanas no longer in command of the Horde, the Alliance forces (Alleria among them) departed from &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;.\nVisions of N'Zoth.\nA &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;-corrupted version of &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner%20%28Vision%20of%20Stormwind%29\"&gt;Alleria&lt;/a&gt; appears in the &lt;a href=\"Vision%20of%20Stormwind\"&gt;Vision of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the downfall of &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;, Turalyon found Alleria in the Valley of Heroes reflecting about a \"&lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;simpler time&lt;/a&gt;\". They both discussed recent events, with Alleria expressing her sorrow at failing to have both her sisters at her side when fighting the war, revealing that new voices have joined the chorus of the old whispers after N'Zoth's defeat, and vowing that they will make Sylvanas pay for what she has done.\nShadows Rising.\nKing Anduin entrusted Alleria and Turalyon with uncovering Sylvanas's whereabouts, although he was frustrated by Alleria's initial lack of success. Alleria had a vision of Sylvanas defeating and nearly suffocating her with her &lt;a href=\"Death\"&gt;Death&lt;/a&gt; powers, upon which Alleria again expressed her regret at not having killed her at &lt;a href=\"Windrunner%20Spire\"&gt;Windrunner Spire&lt;/a&gt;, and then slaying Turalyon and Arator, before abruptly awakening from her disturbing dream. She later mentioned to Turalyon how she has seen \"a thousand futures\", each more monstrous than the last, and vowed to become more than her worst self to stop her younger sister's schemes. During their hunt, &lt;a href=\"Danath%20Trollbane\"&gt;Danath Trollbane&lt;/a&gt; informed his friends that a &lt;a href=\"dark%20ranger\"&gt;dark ranger&lt;/a&gt; had been seen among a group of &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"refugee\"&gt;refugee&lt;/a&gt;s within the &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands\"&gt;Arathi Highlands&lt;/a&gt;. Upon securing the refugees, they were attacked by &lt;a href=\"Zun\"&gt;Zun&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"child\"&gt;child&lt;/a&gt;. Turalyon humorously subdued him, and the pair fully agreed to spare him when &lt;a href=\"Gowzis\"&gt;Gowzis&lt;/a&gt; begged for her son's life. Alleria, remembering her time with &lt;a href=\"Arator%20the%20Redeemer\"&gt;Arator&lt;/a&gt; when he played in the courtyard of Stormwind Keep, told Zun that, regardless of what his elders taught him, war was not glory, but rather seeing people at their very worst - and choosing to protect them anyway.\nAs they looked over the refugees, they discovered that their target wasn't among them, however, with the powers of the Void, Alleria sensed that Gowzis had the information they sought. Initially, Turalyon tried softly interrogating the orc for nearly an hour, but when that failed to yield results, the pair reluctantly decided that they needed the information whatever the cost, with Alleria admitting she felt no pleasure at torturing civilians, but failing to see any realistic alternative and no longer willing to entertain the risk of Sylvanas or her loyalists running free after the atrocities they committed during the Fourth War. After Gowzis spat at her and continued to resist interrogation, Alleria tormented her with the Void, sifting through her memories and thoughts, causing an outraged &lt;a href=\"apothecary\"&gt;apothecary&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Cotley\"&gt;Cotley&lt;/a&gt; to demand her to stop, and the latter revealed that &lt;a href=\"Visrynn\"&gt;Visrynn&lt;/a&gt; had demanded a vow of silence from them and had let slip that she intended to go to the &lt;a href=\"Faldir%27s%20Cove\"&gt;Faldir's Cove&lt;/a&gt; in order to acquire a boat. In response, Alleria ceased her attack and ordered &lt;a href=\"Captain%20%28rank%29\"&gt;Captain&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Celosel%20Nightgiver\"&gt;Celosel Nightgiver&lt;/a&gt; to give the refugees food, blankets, and what they could spare. She then ordered for Nightgiver to send Cotley to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, under the belief that he may know more and how they couldn't afford to miss a single detail in their hunt for, although she privately felt great regret at the apparent necessity of her actions as she departed.\nWith their new knowledge, Alleria and Turalyon headed towards Faldir's Cove, where they discovered a man with a dagger that would be more fitting in a &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; scabbard. When the smuggler refused to answer their questions, Turalyon shackled him with the Light, while Alleria invaded his mind. During this interrogation, &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; arrived, having been sent by Anduin to check on the pair for an update. Jaina was horrified by their tactics and when Turalyon justified their actions by mentioned that the man had sheltered &lt;a href=\"Visrynn\"&gt;an agent&lt;/a&gt; of Sylvanas, Jaina demanded to know how he had known, to which the paladin revealed the Forsaken dagger, and Alleria explained that her interrogation revealed that the &lt;a href=\"dark%20ranger\"&gt;dark ranger&lt;/a&gt; was heading towards &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;. Jaina then left to inform Anduin of everything, which Alleria partly saw as tattling. Anduin dismissed Jaina's concerns, however, arguing that the Horde's atrocities such as the Burning of Teldrassil were what justified their actions, pointed out that she herself had a similar attitude until very recently, and that he continued to trust Alleria and Turalyon not to cross the moral lines.\nSometime later, Turalyon and Alleria were hosted by Jaina in &lt;a href=\"Boralus\"&gt;Boralus&lt;/a&gt;, as they had come at Anduin's request should &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; discover nothing on the Zandalari coast. They were soon interrupted by &lt;a href=\"Flynn%20Fairwind\"&gt;Flynn Fairwind&lt;/a&gt;, who reported that Shaw had been taken prisoner by the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Empire\"&gt;Zandalari Empire&lt;/a&gt;. Whereas Alleria immediately jumped to the conclusion that Sylvanas was working with the Zandalari, leading to yet another tense confrontation with Jaina, who called on her to not add fuel on an already kindling fire and risk the treaty. Jaina then stated she would use the treaty itself before resorting to aggressive means against the Horde.\nShadowlands.\nFollowing &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Anduin&lt;/a&gt;'s abduction by the &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt;'s appointment as regent and protector of the realm, Alleria relocated to the &lt;a href=\"War%20Room\"&gt;War Room&lt;/a&gt; inside &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt; in order to help rebuild strength of the Alliance.\nLater Alleria was among the Alliance leaders to convene with the leaders of the Horde and &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt; within &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the events in the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;, Sylvanas was reunited with a portion of her soul that she'd long been missing. Following the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Zovaal\"&gt;the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, Alleria and Vereesa traveled to &lt;a href=\"Oribos\"&gt;Oribos&lt;/a&gt; to attend Sylvanas' trial, during which the latter submitted to the judgment of her archenemy &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;. The three sisters only had time to exchange a brief farewell before Tyrande sentenced Sylvanas to her fate: to scour the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt; and free all the souls trapped therein. Sylvanas accepted this and exchanged a last look with Alleria and Vereesa before jumping into the Maw. Afterward, Alleria and Vereesa stayed in the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Transference\"&gt;Ring of Transference&lt;/a&gt; for a time and discussed how, having lost so much of their family already, they had to hope that Sylvanas could one day complete her penance so they could be reunited with her.\nThe Vow Eternal.\nA few years later, Alleria and her family were among those who attended the wedding of &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thalyssra\"&gt;Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt;. During the reception, &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt; observed that she spent time with &lt;a href=\"Mia%20Greymane\"&gt;Mia Greymane&lt;/a&gt; and bursted into laughter at something the queen whispered to her.\nPersonality.\nAlleria is a superb forest fighter who prefers solitude and travels with others only when forced to do so. She speaks infrequently and only in short sentences. She shows passion only where orcs are concerned, hunting them ruthlessly and without mercy. However, much of this personality dissolved when she rekindled her relationship with Turalyon. \nIn battle Alleria travels in forests whenever possible and prefers to strike from hiding \u2014 especially when attacking orcs, who she believes have no honor and therefore can be killed in any way she sees fit. In battle, she uses her great speed and mobility to weave in and out of the fight, taking point blank shots with maximum efficiency. If forced into melee in a situation where she absolutely cannot fire her bow, she swings it as a quarterstaff. She wields no other weapons \u2014 Alleria's special composite bow was her father's, and she employs it exclusively.\nApperance.\nAlleria is a High Elf with great beauty and elegance with white skin, bright blue eyes and bright golden blonde hair, this being the main reason for her nickname Sun Lady by her sisters, in addition to having blue tattoos on the right side of herface and arms. She primarily wears a light green ranger uniform with dark magenta torn cape.\nIn her Void form, her skin turns a dark neon indigo, her hair turns a purplish white, and her tattoos and eyes glow an ethereal blue. her ranger uniform turns a dark neon blue.\nQuotes.\nLegion.\nGossip.\n&lt;You catch Alleria out of the corner of your eye. She's looking at your bow.&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;Alleria's eyes drift from the statue's cold stone visage down to the plague engraved with her epitaph.&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nOne day Silvermoon will stand again on the side of the Alliance. I know it.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nGossip.\nThus far, I have been very impressed by &lt;a href=\"Halford%20Wyrmbane\"&gt;High Commander Wyrmbane&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe employs a wide range of tactics and is quick to adapt to changing circumstances with appropriate, necessary strategies.\nThe Alliance's war efforts are in capable hands. Like you, I am proud to play my part in them.\nIt is good to see you again, &lt;name&gt;. I admire how quickly you have risen through the ranks of the Alliance.\nBut I am even more pleased that you continue to resist the whispers.\nWar is chaotic and savage. No matter what you witness--what you experience--you must never lose control. Do not let the shadows overtake your will.\nThe Alliance is counting on you.\nI am counting on you.\nValley of Heroes.\n&lt;Alleria's eyes drift from the statue's cold stone visage down to the plague engraved with her epitaph.&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nNotes and trivia.\nDisappearance retcon.\nSee &lt;a href=\"Turalyon%23Disappearance%20retcon\"&gt;Turalyon#Disappearance retcon&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpeculation.\nAlleria's brief entry in the &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20Encyclopedia\"&gt;Warcraft Encyclopedia&lt;/a&gt; mentions that she fought during the &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Wars\"&gt;Troll Wars&lt;/a&gt;. This seems to be an inconsistency as it would make her over 2,800 years old, yet the Council of Silvermoon members were noted to be far older than Alleria and even then, only some of them had participated in the Troll Wars. Other elves active during that period, such as the 3,000-year-old &lt;a href=\"Anasterian%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Anasterian&lt;/a&gt;, were also described as the most elderly among their kind, with fittingly frail, wizened, and withered appearances, yet Alleria was described as looking young, fit, and beautiful, though she is still older than the humans she has interacted with. Alleria's inclusion in the Troll Wars may thus have been an oversight, it's possible that it was not meant to refer to the actual Troll Wars of 2,800 years ago, but more recent conflicts with the trolls. In fact, Alleria and the elven archers embroiled in &lt;a href=\"Zul%27jin\"&gt;Zul'jin&lt;/a&gt;'s bloody conflict were described as \"descendants of their elder race\".\nHowever, in the quest &lt;a href=\"Old%20Allies\"&gt;Old Allies&lt;/a&gt; Lor'themar states that he respected Sylvanas for millennia which would make Sylvanas thousands of years old and since Alleria is the eldest Windrunner she would be even older.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}
