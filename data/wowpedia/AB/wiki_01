The preparations for this caper would be difficult and expensive, and such an insult would not go unnoticed."}

It formerly required a lengthy level 60 questline, detailed below.\nThe questline began with the former &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Trainer\"&gt;Demon Trainer&lt;/a&gt;s found in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, or the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;. \nThey had a quest directing you to speak with a &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; warlock named &lt;a href=\"Mor%27zul%20Bloodbringer\"&gt;Mor'zul Bloodbringer&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Steppes\"&gt;Burning Steppes&lt;/a&gt;. Mor'zul is on a hill across the road from the &lt;a href=\"Altar%20of%20Storms%20%28Burning%20Steppes%29\"&gt;Altar of Storms&lt;/a&gt;, which is in extreme northwestern Burning Steppes, west of &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt;. He would send you on a long and expensive sequence of adventures culminating in your learning the &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Dreadsteed\"&gt;Summon Dreadsteed&lt;/a&gt; spell.\nQuest overview.\nMor'zul's servant, a &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; warlock named &lt;a href=\"Gorzeeki%20Wildeyes\"&gt;Gorzeeki Wildeyes&lt;/a&gt;, will have to craft several items to allow you to summon and capture a Dreadsteed of Xoroth \u2014 a bell, a wheel, a candle, a scroll, and a stone. To that end, he sends you on a number of quests to obtain the arcane raw materials for these items. To create the scroll, you must complete the following two quest chains:\nOnce the first questline is completed, the following materials quests become available:\nIn addition, once both of the introductory quest lines are done, the following will be available (note: the materials quests are not required for this):\nFinally, once all the above quests have been completed, the summoning quest becomes available:\nDetailed walk-throughs for each chain are given below.\nInk for the Scroll.\nCompleting this sequence allows Wildeyes to make the ink for the scroll, but not the paper \u2014 it has to be infused with Xorothian Stardust from the second quest line. Also, Mor'zul has three quests for you, which can be completed in any order, about gathering materials for the bell, wheel, and candle.\nBell, Wheel, and Candle (materials branch).\nThese three quests and the one that follow them seem designed to provide income for high-level crafters. The first three, as mentioned, can be done in any order, and once they're turned in, the fourth one becomes available. Since there may be considerable expense involved here, it's good that you can work on the other branch of the overall quest (the Xorothian Glyphs branch) at the same time, although there's some expense involved there as well. But in this branch, you may well have a profession that will help you here, or you may be able to call on the help of friends or guildmates for the materials.\nMor'zul tells you that to create the Bell of Dethmoora, you must bring Wildeyes 2 &lt;a href=\"Elixir%20of%20Shadow%20Power\"&gt;Elixir of Shadow Power&lt;/a&gt;. This is a fairly high-level &lt;a href=\"Alchemy\"&gt;Alchemy&lt;/a&gt; recipe, but even if you're not an Alchemist, they are usually available at an &lt;a href=\"Auction%20House\"&gt;Auction House&lt;/a&gt;. You don't get an item called the Bell of Dethmoora, per se, at any point, but it does appear in the summoning ritual.\nIn order to create the Wheel, Wildeyes will need 6 &lt;a href=\"Large%20Brilliant%20Shard\"&gt;Large Brilliant Shard&lt;/a&gt; and 25 &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20Ore\"&gt;Dark Iron Ore&lt;/a&gt;. Here we have an item that requires a fairly high level in a crafting profession and another that requires a fairly high level in a gathering profession. Like the Bell, there's no actual Wheel item to tote around after turning this in.\nWildeyes needs 3 &lt;a href=\"Black%20Dragonscale\"&gt;Black Dragonscale&lt;/a&gt; to make the Candle. More about the Bell, Wheel, and Candle later. Once you have completed these three quests, in any order, Wildeyes gives you a fourth one:\nFinally Wildeyes will have to make you a Black Lodestone, which requires 1 &lt;a href=\"Arcanite%20Bar\"&gt;Arcanite Bar&lt;/a&gt;. Once you turn this in, you're done with the materials sequence!\nXorothian Stardust.\nAs mentioned above, there's another sequence that can be done concurrently while collecting the ink for the scroll. Wildeyes informs you that the scroll's paper needs to be infused with Xorothian Stardust before the proper glyphs can be inscribed upon it. This sequence of quests is about acquiring this rare material:\n&lt;a href=\"Lord%20Banehollow\"&gt;Lord Banehollow&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;a href=\"Dreadlord\"&gt;Dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; currently dwelling among the remnants of the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Jaedenar\"&gt;Jaedenar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Felwood\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt;. He is also the only being on Azeroth known to possess Xorothian Stardust. Unfortunately, the denizens of Jaedenar are hostile to anyone who is not their ally. However, Wildeyes has &lt;a href=\"Shadowy%20Potions\"&gt;Shadowy Potions&lt;/a&gt; that can fool them into thinking you're one of them, and he'll gladly sell 3 of them to you for 6 gold. You will probably only have to use 1 of them, though.\nBuy the potions, then take with you to Felwood. Once you get to Jaedenar, drink one of the potions and head down into Shadow Hold. Everyone you meet will be Friendly to you for the next 20 minutes, which should be plenty of time. The only things that won't be Friendly to you are the mindless oozes (and a succubus named Rakaiah in the room after them), which you can probably avoid for the most part as you descend to the very bottom of Shadow Hold and speak to Lord Banehollow, who has a quest for you ...\nBanehollow won't sell you any Stardust until you do something for him: his rival back on Xoroth, Lord Hel'nurath, is plotting against him and has a spy in Shadow Hold, an &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Ulathek\"&gt;Ulathek&lt;/a&gt;. Banehollow knows you want to steal one of Hel'nurath's dreadsteeds, and he's perfectly willing to help you humiliate Hel'nurath as long as you do something in exchange \u2014 you have to find Ulathek, kill him, and bring back his heart. Finding him isn't too difficult; he's in one of the side rooms you passed by getting down to Banehollow. When you speak to him, he will turn hostile and attack, as will his four guards (you might want to do something to keep them off you long enough to kill Ulathek and loot his still-beating heart). Kill Ulathek and take his heart back to Banehollow, who will be happy with you, as happy as a Dreadlord snacking on the freshly-ripped-out heart of his enemy. Mmm mmm.\nIt would be prudent to summon your voidwalker to tank the 4 other mobs while you burn Ulathek down. After you have slain him, loot him quickly and jump down to the right when you get out of his cave and keep running back to Lord Banehollow. A smart thing to do is to sacrifice your voidwalker.\nIf you're a Demonology warlock, your felguard should be able to tank the mobs nicely, and a sacrifice shouldn't be required. The other mobs in Jaedenar will still be friendly to you. (Apparently they don't care much for Ulathek either).\nAlternatively, instead of talking to Ulathek, right-click your Taint of Shadow buff to dismiss the effect. Ulathek and his guards will attack you. Now, kill Ulathek quickly and drink another Shadowy Potion once he's dead. The guards will instantly stop attacking you, allowing you to casually loot the corpse and go complete your quest. Note: you \"must\" manually remove the buff in order for this to work. \nBanehollow will finally allow you to purchase some &lt;a href=\"Xorothian%20Stardust\"&gt;Xorothian Stardust&lt;/a&gt; from his lackey &lt;a href=\"Ur%27dan\"&gt;Ur'dan&lt;/a&gt; who is standing next to him for 150 gold. You're done in Jaedenar; take the Stardust back to Wildeyes in the Burning Steppes.\nScholomance.\nOnce you have obtained both the ink for the scroll and the Xorothian Stardust, the following quest becomes available:\nWildeyes now tells you that the parchment (which he doesn't make you pay for, incredibly) must be infused with the Stardust and the glyphs must be inscribed upon it. He can't do it here - the only place with the equipment is in Ras Frostwhisper's lab in the &lt;a href=\"Scholomance\"&gt;Scholomance&lt;/a&gt;. And he isn't going with you - instead, he has a highly-trained imp named J'eevee who knows the procedure, and he won't even charge you rent to borrow an &lt;a href=\"Imp%20in%20a%20Jar%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Imp in a Jar (Classic)&lt;/a&gt;. Take the jar, form a party of 5, and go to Scholomance to fight your way into Ras's lab, where you can use the jar at one of the tables to the right; and J'eevee will come out and do his thing, completing your quest. You don't actually have to kill Ras to do this; the tables are far enough away from him that he can't see you doing this. This is the same &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20Lab%20%28object%29\"&gt;Alchemy Lab&lt;/a&gt; that Alchemists had to go to in order to make &lt;a href=\"Flask\"&gt;Flask&lt;/a&gt;s before the ones in &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt; were available. \nThe Imp in a Jar tooltip specifically says \"Scholomance Alchemy Lab\". While you \"can\" open the jar at the &lt;a href=\"Blackwing%20Lair\"&gt;Blackwing Lair&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shattrath\"&gt;Shattrath&lt;/a&gt; City Alchemy Labs, they will not give you quest completion. It must be in Scholomance.\nOnce you're done in Scholomance, return to Wildeyes.\nEntering Dire Maul West.\nThe last step to obtain the dreadsteed is to enter Dire Maul West and complete the ritual. Someone in your party will need the &lt;a href=\"Crescent%20Key\"&gt;Crescent Key&lt;/a&gt; to unlock the external door to the instance as well as to unlock a door once inside the instance. A rogue with 300 lockpicking is also able to open the door. A warlock may also use Hellfire to commit suicide, resurrect on inside of door, and open the door from within.\nThe Ritual.\nMor'zul hands you a book, &lt;a href=\"Mor%27zul%27s%20Instructions\"&gt;Mor'zul's Instructions&lt;/a&gt;, that describes all of this. Here is the gist of it. First, you must purchase &lt;a href=\"J%27eevee%27s%20Jar\"&gt;J'eevee's Jar&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=\"Black%20Lodestone\"&gt;Black Lodestone&lt;/a&gt; , and &lt;a href=\"Xorothian%20Glyphs\"&gt;Xorothian Glyphs&lt;/a&gt; from Wildeyes \u2014 he may be a goblin warlock, but he's still a goblin, so he's not giving you anything for free.\nIt will be difficult to find a full party for &lt;a href=\"Dire%20Maul\"&gt;Dire Maul&lt;/a&gt; West these days, so it will probably be necessary to bring one or two high-level characters with you instead. You will have to kill the boss &lt;a href=\"Immol%27thar\"&gt;Immol'thar&lt;/a&gt;, because you're going to use the circular dais he was imprisoned in as your summoning circle. You must first lower the energy shield encasing him by locating the 5 power crystals throughout the instance (two are located in the room boss is in) and killing the elementals powering it. It is recommended to have at least 10-15 &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Shard\"&gt;Soul Shard&lt;/a&gt;s before you fight Immol'thar.\nOnce your party has defeated Immol'thar and rested/rebuffed, activate J'eevee's Jar. The imp has your three ritual nodes (the Bell, Wheel, and Candle) and sets them up; he also starts the process of forming the Circle of Greater Summoning. This process will attract waves of demons; groups of &lt;a href=\"Xorothian%20Imp%20%28Dire%20Maul%29\"&gt;Xorothian Imp&lt;/a&gt;s and occasional &lt;a href=\"Dread%20Guard\"&gt;Dread Guard&lt;/a&gt;s (felguards) will come to attack.\nFortunately the three artifacts will help. The Bell of Dethmoora restores health and mana to any Warlocks in the party. (&lt;a href=\"Ritual%20Bell%20Aura\"&gt;Ritual Bell Aura&lt;/a&gt; restores 150 health and 150 mana, though it's uncertain often it procs.) The Wheel of the Black March protects all party members (&lt;a href=\"Black%20March%20Blessing\"&gt;Black March Blessing&lt;/a&gt; absorbs 100 points of damage from every hit on anyone in the party). The Doomsday Candle burns anyone not in the party with fire damage (&lt;a href=\"Ritual%20Candle%20Aura\"&gt;Ritual Candle Aura&lt;/a&gt;, 250 damage per second); and because of the Candle, you can ignore the imps. The damage they do is minimal when the Wheel is active, and they die fairly quickly when the Candle is active. The party should therefore focus on the Dread Guards; there will be up to of 10 or 11 of them, and sometimes they spawn more than one at a time. It can be beneficial to enslave the felguards as they come. \nYou, however, should focus on the Bell, Wheel, and Candle, which need recharging from time to time (they sag, tilt, and make a noise to let you know when they need attention); this requires the Black Lodestone, but recharging an item with it costs a Soul Shard. The most difficult part is recharging the artifacts (Fix Ritual Node) because it requires a 3-second casting time and is interrupted by any damage, even the damage the imps do, so you either need party members who are good at pulling aggro off you, or you need to have voidwalker to taunt them off, or some similar solution. In addition, they spawn in greater numbers than before; around 10 or 11 over the course of the ritual. Just keep everything going until the circle is complete. If all three of the ritual nodes are allowed to fail completely, the ritual will end and will have to be restarted. Any warlock in the party who has a Black Lodestone and a Soul Shard to spend can recharge a failing node; however, it doesn't have to be the one who started the ritual. It takes around 10-15 Soul Shards to keep them all going until the circle is complete.\nThe circle consists of 9 glowing symbols on the floor, which will slowly appear one at a time. It takes about 6 minutes for all 9 to appear, and as soon as they're all visible, there will be a swirling, red vortex around the circle, and no more demons will come. At that point, if you don't want to kill the rest of the demons, run out of the circle - the demons will chase you, but will disappear when they reach the edge of the circle.\nIf you wipe, don't worry - as long as at least one of the nodes is still up, the symbols will keep appearing, and when the 9th one appears the circle becomes complete as usual. Just release and run back. If there are demons in the completed circle (it's obvious from the pink vortex that exists there now), just run up and lure them out - they will disappear, and you have your circle ready.\nYou now have an opportunity to rest, heal, and rebuff. The next step doesn't start until you activate your Xorothian Glyphs.\nWhen you're ready, use the Glyphs. A portal opens, and a &lt;a href=\"Xorothian%20Dreadsteed\"&gt;Xorothian Dreadsteed&lt;/a&gt; appears which the party must fight and kill. When the dreadsteed is at about 50% health, &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Hel%27nurath\"&gt;Lord Hel'nurath&lt;/a&gt; himself appears. He hates people who steal his horses, which is basically what you're doing, so you and your friends have to kill him too. He is, however, the only add in this fight.\nOnce both targets have been taken down, you can do the last step: talk to the spirit of the dreadsteed. It will teach you the &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Dreadsteed\"&gt;Summon Dreadsteed&lt;/a&gt; spell. (In fact, until the spirit despawns you can have warlocks join the group, get summoned to the circle, talk to the spirit, and complete the quest, as long as they're done with every quest in the series but \"Dreadsteed of Xoroth.\" They'd miss out on the ritual, though, which is fun.) Lord Hel'nurath drops some interesting loot, too.\nYou are now done! Two notes: First, J'eevee's Jar, the Black Lodestone, and the Xorothian Glyphs aren't used up in the process. You can help other warlocks get the dreadsteeds by going to Dire Maul with them (once they've finished all the steps up to that point) and using your three items, thus saving them . Second, more than one warlock can complete the quest at the same time. It may be a good idea to have a couple along anyway to keep the ritual nodes up; it's nice to know that both can complete the quest. However, remember that any warlock who plans to help maintain the bell/wheel/candle must have a Black Lodestone in order to be able to recharge them.\nTotal materials list.\nThe final materials list is as follows:"}

It is illustrated by &lt;a href=\"Zoltan%20Boros\"&gt;Zoltan Boros&lt;/a&gt;. The story tells of a &lt;a href=\"Keda%20Bloomblade\"&gt;night elf Sentinel's&lt;/a&gt; efforts to win the attention of &lt;a href=\"Toreth%20Bluestar\"&gt;her love&lt;/a&gt; with the help of an &lt;a href=\"Elyrion%20Fogsong\"&gt;old hermit&lt;/a&gt;.\nSummary.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Keda%20Bloomblade\"&gt;Keda Bloomblade&lt;/a&gt; visits the alchemist &lt;a href=\"Elyrion%20Fogsong\"&gt;Elyrion Fogsong&lt;/a&gt; in his bog to buy a potion. She laments that she isn't bold enough to confess her romantic feelings for the Loreekeper &lt;a href=\"Toreth%20Bluestar\"&gt;Toreth Bluestar&lt;/a&gt;, and Elyrion tries to offer encouragement. Before leaving, Keda invites Elyrion to join her at a Sentinel ceremony where she will be honored for her accomplishments, but he refuses. After the ceremony, Toreth approaches Keda to ask her questions about her deeds so he can record them. She gets the idea to impress him and work up the courage to confess her feelings by performing feats of heroism, since she believes that being a soldier is her only good quality. When she says the latter to Elyrion, he disagrees and reminds her that it took boldness for her to become who she is, since her family saw her as a boy when she was born. He asks if they never taught her that she deserves love simply because of who she is, and Keda explains that her family estranged her when she broke the tradition dictating that every male Bloomblade should become a &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlthough she repeatedly throws herself into danger and frequently gets to speak with Toreth (who repeatedly invites her for tea), Keda continues to feel embarrassed whenever she's near him. Elyrion offers to brew her a potion that will let her see herself as worthy of Toreth's attention, if she retrieves the last few ingredients for him: three crescent stones, two moss bunches, and a &lt;a href=\"nightsaber\"&gt;nightsaber&lt;/a&gt;'s tear. When she returns with the ingredients, he warns her that pursuing what she wants also means that she has more to lose. He reveals that the reason he lives alone in the bog is that he once lost a life of happiness and doesn't want to try to find one again, instead finding purpose in helping others with his potions. Keda responds by returning the advice Elyrion gave her earlier: that he has value beyond his usefulness.\nElyrion's potion causes Keda to feel more confident, to the point where she finally agrees to have tea with Toreth. They start meeting regularly and, one night when watching a &lt;a href=\"glowmoth\"&gt;glowmoth&lt;/a&gt; migration, share a kiss. Weeks later, Keda reveals what it was that caused to her start courting Toreth. However, Toreth in turn reveals that all the ingredients she collected for Elyrion are useless and adds that he's familiar with the alchemist's history: his &lt;a href=\"Ellaene\"&gt;wife&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arietta\"&gt;daughter&lt;/a&gt; were killed in battle. Keda and Toreth visit Elyrion, who explains that he's kept his tragic past secret because \"Secrecy bandages the pain\". Keda invites him to join her and Toreth in the village. He is initially reluctant, but she offers him a bundle of three crescent stones, two moss bunches, and a nightsaber's tear, saying that the mixture will help him see himself as worthy of having a family again, and adds that \"I have love enough in my heart for a father of my choosing. If he will have me.\" After a moment, Elyrion smiles and accepts the bundle."}

The eels and their alchemic products are used in high-level &lt;a href=\"potions\"&gt;potions&lt;/a&gt; used by &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt;ers, &lt;a href=\"Craftsman%27s%20Writs\"&gt;Craftsman's Writ&lt;/a&gt; quests for &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt; reputation, and a &lt;a href=\"Tier%200.5\"&gt;Tier 0.5&lt;/a&gt; armor set quest. As a result, stonescale eel is one of the most lucrative fish one can catch.\nSources.\nStonescale Eels are nocturnal so the best time to catch them is between the hours of 12 am and 6 am. They require a minimum skill in fishing of around 180 + lures. The best place to catch eels is any deep water location in &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt;, the most popular being Scalebeard's Cave and by Duke Hydraxis. Expect around 10% drop rate when fishing. A higher rate can be obtained from around the cave in the bay, but this requires a minimum fishing skill of 235 just to be allowed to fish there. At this skill level, though, most of the fish will \"get away\". Schools of stonescale eels appear off the main coast of Azshara during the night hours (during the day the spawn points are usually filled with firefin snappers and oily blackmouth).\nNotes.\nAs of &lt;a href=\"Patch%201.11\"&gt;Patch 1.11&lt;/a&gt; there are Swarms of Stonescale Eels that function much like schools of other valuable fish. They can be found along coastlines in &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20of%20Sorrows\"&gt;Swamp of Sorrows&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tanaris\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thousand%20Needles\"&gt;Thousand Needles&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt; is also gaining several quests for the eels, both directly and crafted into items, so demand should stay steady or even increase."}

For example, one may refer to a weapon known for being fancy by saying something like \"it's gray and fancier than your average weapon\".\nIt has since then been acknowledged by &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard&lt;/a&gt;, and since &lt;a href=\"Patch%202.4.3\"&gt;Patch 2.4.3&lt;/a&gt; the cape has the flavor text \"It's white and looks longer than your average cloak or cape.\" Another cape, the &lt;a href=\"Saronite%20Gargoyle%20Cloak\"&gt;Saronite Gargoyle Cloak&lt;/a&gt; added in &lt;a href=\"Patch%203.3.0\"&gt;Patch 3.3.0&lt;/a&gt;, further humorously refers to the \"original\" Stoneskin Gargoyle Cape with the flavor text \"Even longer than your average cloak or cape.\""}

It was a holy land to them, but they were driven out by numerous foes, including the &lt;a href=\"quilboar\"&gt;quilboar&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Razorfen%20Kraul\"&gt;Razorfen Kraul&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Auld%20Stonespire\"&gt;Auld Stonespire&lt;/a&gt; sent champions to end &lt;a href=\"Charlga%20Razorflank\"&gt;Charlga Razorflank&lt;/a&gt; and bring back her heart.\n&lt;a href=\"Bael%20Modan\"&gt;Bael Modan&lt;/a&gt; was once a part of the lands that served as home and provider to the Stonespire tribe. It was the ancestral birthplace of many of them. Then the &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Bael%27dun\"&gt;Bael'dun&lt;/a&gt; came and began their disruptive excavation operations, forcing the tauren out and killing many innocent tauren in the process. The tauren tried to approach the dwarves to reach a diplomatic resolution, but it failed. Tired of waiting and angry about his tribe's persecution and destruction, &lt;a href=\"Gann%20Stonespire\"&gt;Gann Stonespire&lt;/a&gt; sent a &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; champion to reclaim the journal of &lt;a href=\"Prospector%20Khazgorm\"&gt;Prospector Khazgorm&lt;/a&gt; and retaliate against the dwarves, killing Khazgorm in the process. After gathering supplies to make explosives, the champion was tasked do use them to destroy a &lt;a href=\"flying%20machine\"&gt;flying machine&lt;/a&gt; to show the dwarves a lesson.\nCataclysm.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; offensive against the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; settlements in the Barrens, &lt;a href=\"Camp%20Taurajo\"&gt;Camp Taurajo&lt;/a&gt; was destroyed and other areas occupied by the Alliance military. Gann Stonespire was one of the mortally wounded. During their last raid to Bael'Dun Keep, Gann and his party managed to smuggle a &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; saboteur inside: &lt;a href=\"Weezil%20Slipshadow\"&gt;Weezil Slipshadow&lt;/a&gt;. A Horde champion was sent to assist him. The two sabotaged the artillery shells and the keep was destroyed in the explosion. Although the adventurer survived, Weezil did not. Either way, Gann was relived that Camp Taurajo and the tauren people had been avenged. &lt;a href=\"Nato%20Raintree\"&gt;Nato Raintree&lt;/a&gt; removed the bullet that killed Gann from his chest and gave it to the Horde champion. He sent the champion to where Gann's family was in order to tell them about what became of him. Once in &lt;a href=\"Brackenwall%20%20Village\"&gt;Brackenwall Village&lt;/a&gt;, the champion gave the bullet to &lt;a href=\"Alto%20Stonespire\"&gt;Alto Stonespire&lt;/a&gt;. He knew Gann would die someday if he continued like that, but was thankful that the champion had gifted Gann with vengeance.\nSpeculation.\nWhile Gann Stonespire is a member of a tribe, technically there is no reference that it is called the Stonespire tribe. However, most other tauren last names refer to a tribe, &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Stonespire\"&gt;Elder Stonespire&lt;/a&gt; is seen with the other tribal leaders such as &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Elder Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; and the NPCs with the Stonespire name tend to have specific skin tones, specifically grey and brown fur."}

The mountains are traditionally the ancestral home of the &lt;a href=\"Harpy\"&gt;harpies&lt;/a&gt;, but their numbers have dwindled with the turmoil in the region. &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Peak\"&gt;Stonetalon Peak&lt;/a&gt;, the largest mountain in the range, has long been a sacred place for both the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt;. The night elves once maintained a barrow and a glade at the top, but the area has since come under attack by a sinister force. The mountains further south are less forested, although some sparse evergreens grow in certain spots, particularly the &lt;a href=\"Greatwood%20Vale\"&gt;Greatwood Vale&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Windshear%20Crag\"&gt;Windshear Crag&lt;/a&gt; has been decimated by years of logging by various factions, leaving the air is filled with soot and spoiling the area's water with oil and waste. The night elves have several holds, while the tauren have a settlement in the centrally located &lt;a href=\"Sun%20Rock%20Retreat\"&gt;Sun Rock Retreat&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear\"&gt;Darkspear&lt;/a&gt; trolls have a village further south at &lt;a href=\"Malaka%27jin\"&gt;Malaka'jin&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; also have posts at various battlefronts throughout the mountains. The mountains are home to creatures such as kobolds, spiders, and eagles, while &lt;a href=\"Charred%20Vale\"&gt;Charred Vale&lt;/a&gt; stretches out to the sea and holds several especially dangerous &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragon&lt;/a&gt;s and elementals.\nHistory.\nIn ancient times, &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt; blessed a &lt;a href=\"Fountain%20of%20Health\"&gt;Fountain of Health&lt;/a&gt; in Stonetalon Mountains.\nThe Third War.\nStonetalon Mountains have traditionally been the area of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; where night elves and tauren coexist and forms a border between the two peoples. Stonetalon Peak has long been a sacred place for the two races and was historically the home of the immortal &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Oracle&lt;/a&gt;, the being who saw the strands of fate as they were woven by the &lt;a href=\"Earth%20Mother\"&gt;Earth Mother&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the mountains hosted &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"orcish\"&gt;orcish&lt;/a&gt; camps, and it was at Stonetalon Peak that the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; temporarily united in order to fight the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe area south Stonetalon Peak housed &lt;a href=\"Razormane%20tribe\"&gt;Razormane&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"quilboar\"&gt;quilboar&lt;/a&gt;, a group of &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt;, and a group of &lt;a href=\"harpy\"&gt;harpies&lt;/a&gt; who captured local &lt;a href=\"wyvern\"&gt;wyvern&lt;/a&gt;s and corrupted the fountain blessed by Elune.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Mor%27rogal\"&gt;Mor'rogal&lt;/a&gt; there is something evil under the mountains. The trolls of &lt;a href=\"Malaka%27jin\"&gt;Malaka'jin&lt;/a&gt; sent &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to strike at the keepers and dryads within the at the Stonetalon Peaks, the tauren of &lt;a href=\"Sun%20Rock%20Retreat\"&gt;Sun Rock Retreat&lt;/a&gt; and the night elves of &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Peak\"&gt;Stonetalon Peak&lt;/a&gt; sent &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to deal with the various threats within the region. Meanwhile &lt;a href=\"Ziz%20Fizziks\"&gt;Ziz Fizziks&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Windshear%20Crag\"&gt;Windshear Crag&lt;/a&gt;, aims to strike directly at the heart of Venture Company's local team \u2014 the leprous gnome Gerenzo Wrenchwhistle. And in a small camp nearby, Kaela Shadowspear and Gaxim Rustfizzle organize the Alliance's opposition in the rugged crags, with particular aims at the nearby goblin invaders and the monsters of the Charred Vale.\nCataclysm.\nAfter the coming of &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; wracked the whole of Azeroth, the Stonetalon Mountains were altered in several locations. The Charred Vale, while mostly restored by druidic efforts, received a large spire of lava jutting out its southern end. Stonetalon Peak came under attack by the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods%27%20forces\"&gt;Old Gods' forces&lt;/a&gt;, destroying the land, killing the wildlife and corrupting the &lt;a href=\"Son%20of%20Cenarius\"&gt;Sons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Daughter%20of%20Cenarius\"&gt;Daughters of Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, Stonetalon also became a major theater of war in the &lt;a href=\"Alliance-Horde%20war\"&gt;Alliance-Horde war&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Overlord%20Krom%27gar\"&gt;Overlord Krom'gar&lt;/a&gt; showed the sheer brutality of &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;'s Horde, destroying a glade of innocent druids and students unaffiliated with the Alliance for suspicion of being allied with the Alliance. These events would foreshadow Garrosh's barbarous &lt;a href=\"Theramore%27s%20Fall\"&gt;attack&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore Isle&lt;/a&gt;.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Sareth%27na\"&gt;Elder Sareth'na&lt;/a&gt; there is an ancient evil in Stonetalon.\nTraveler.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Charred%20Vale\"&gt;Charred Vale&lt;/a&gt; in the Stonetalon Mountains became a place for a &lt;a href=\"Mechanical%20Engineers%27%20Guild%20of%20Azeroth\"&gt;MEGA&lt;/a&gt; event.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Hidden\"&gt;Hidden&lt;/a&gt; lured and ambushed &lt;a href=\"Aramar%20Thorne\"&gt;Aramar Thorne&lt;/a&gt; and his friends in the &lt;a href=\"Northwatch%20Expedition%20Base%20Camp\"&gt;Northwatch Expedition Base Camp&lt;/a&gt;, leading to Aram's capture and the death of the &lt;a href=\"dryad\"&gt;dryad&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Taryndrella\"&gt;Taryndrella&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Makasa%20Flintwill\"&gt;Makasa Flintwill&lt;/a&gt; and the others buried her in the valley beneath the base camp. It grew into a big tree named &lt;a href=\"Forever%20Tree\"&gt;Forever Tree&lt;/a&gt;. Almost a year later after the base camp ambush, Aram and his friends reunited at the tree, promising they would meet again annually. Makasa brought her friends to the Charred Vale's shore where her ship, the \"&lt;a href=\"Dryad%20%28ship%29\"&gt;Dryad&lt;/a&gt;\" was docked and waiting for them to take on their next adventure.\nExploring Azeroth.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; reports stated that the &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stardust%20Spire\"&gt;Stardust Spire&lt;/a&gt; destroyed every siege weapon the Horde brought down from the Stonetalon Mountains.\nGetting there.\nThe normal questing experience for both factions guides them into Stonetalon through &lt;a href=\"Talondeep%20Pass\"&gt;Talondeep Pass&lt;/a&gt; in the mountains in southwestern &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeography.\nThe Stonetalon Mountains lie between the forests of &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt; to the north and the bleak &lt;a href=\"Desolace\"&gt;Desolace&lt;/a&gt; to the southwest. The highest peaks of the mountains are thickly forested with evergreens, though the forest thins with lower altitude.

The Horde adventurer delivered fresh supplies to &lt;a href=\"The%20Fold\"&gt;The Fold&lt;/a&gt; and then began assassinating Night Elf scouts in the area while looking for a missing engineer. While doing this, the adventurer uncovered an Alliance plan to attack &lt;a href=\"Krom%27gar%20Fortress\"&gt;Krom'gar Fortress&lt;/a&gt; directly and was ordered to take these plans to Krom'gar himself. Krom'gar thanked the adventurer and gave them a field promotion to sergeant.\nChapter 2: Krom'gar Fortress.\nOverlord Krom'gar ordered the adventurer to attack the nearby &lt;a href=\"Northwatch\"&gt;Northwatch&lt;/a&gt; camp and assassinate their leader &lt;a href=\"Marshal%20Paltrow\"&gt;Marshal Paltrow&lt;/a&gt; to weaken the Alliance forces. The adventurer scavenged parts from the camp and was able to use them to reactivate a shredder which decimated the Alliance ground forces. However, as thin as the Alliance infantry was becoming, the Alliance forces had an air force of &lt;a href=\"Gnomish%20Flying%20Machine%20%28Stonetalon%29\"&gt;gnomish flying machines&lt;/a&gt; ready to decimate the fortress from the air. Krom'gar ordered the adventurer to assist the goblins with preparing anti-air defenses for the impending bombardment. The mine below the fortress had inadvertently awoken some earth elementals, which the adventurer subdued before returning with the necessary parts. The attack had already begun, but the adventurer was able to use a now-functional anti-air battery to shoot down the gnomish air forces, causing the Alliance to fall back. For their service, Krom'gar promoted the adventurer to legionnaire. With Krom'gar Fortress secure for now, Krom'gar ordered the adventurer to assist &lt;a href=\"Malaka%27jin\"&gt;Malaka'jin&lt;/a&gt; to the South, besieged due to the Alliance's recent sacking of &lt;a href=\"Honor%27s%20Stand\"&gt;Honor's Stand&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Barrens\"&gt;Southern Barrens&lt;/a&gt;.\nChapter 3: Malaka'jin.\nUpon arriving at Malaka'jin, the Horde adventurer learned that the Alliance had entered into an alliance of convenience with the &lt;a href=\"Grimtotem%20tribe\"&gt;Grimtotem&lt;/a&gt; and that their combined forces were overwhelming the Horde's line. &lt;a href=\"Witch%20Doctor%20Jin%27Zil\"&gt;Witch Doctor Jin'Zil&lt;/a&gt; proposed a radical solution--voodoo--to turn the tide of battle. The adventurer collected the necessary reagents for the ritual while enslaving a nearby kobold tribe to use as cannon fodder. With the materials gathered, the adventurer set about using the voodoo to empower the Horde's troops while ordering the kobolds to attack the Alliance flank. These maneuvers broke the siege and the adventurer returned to Overlord Krom'gar with the good news. Krom'gar promoted the adventurer to champion for their dedicated service.\nChapter 4: Cliffwalker Post.\nWith the siege at Malaka'jin broken and the attacks on Krom'gar Fortress thwarted, Overlord Krom'gar ordered the Horde adventurer to bring the balloon carrying &lt;a href=\"The%20Bomb\"&gt;The Bomb&lt;/a&gt; to the nearby goblin facility &lt;a href=\"The%20Sludgewerks\"&gt;The Sludgewerks&lt;/a&gt; to be refueled on its way to its final destination at &lt;a href=\"Cliffwalker%20Post\"&gt;Cliffwalker Post&lt;/a&gt;. While waiting on the refueling efforts, the adventurer wiped out the night elf spies in the area and eliminated a wyvern colony that was posing a threat to the operation. When the refueling was finished, the adventurer brought The Bomb to its final destination.\nUpon arriving at Cliffwalker Post, the adventurer found Krom'gar's subordinate &lt;a href=\"General%20Grebo\"&gt;General Grebo&lt;/a&gt; in a heated argument with the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; chieftain of the village, &lt;a href=\"High%20Chieftain%20Cliffwalker\"&gt;High Chieftain Cliffwalker&lt;/a&gt;. Grebo claimed that the Horde had intelligence that the night elves were hiding a weapon of mass destruction at &lt;a href=\"Thal%27darah%20Grove\"&gt;Thal'darah Grove&lt;/a&gt; and that, because of this, the Horde needed to use The Bomb to take out the grove before the Alliance could use the weapon against them. Cliffwalker, however, claimed that there was no such weapon and that the grove was simply a training facility for druids, further insisting that the grove wasn't even affiliated with the Alliance and that, if the General would delay the planned attack for just a short while, he could prove it. Grebo hesitated in deploying The Bomb, but nonetheless ordered the adventurer to assist in the siege of the nearby &lt;a href=\"Thal%27darah%20Overlook\"&gt;Thal'darah Overlook&lt;/a&gt; already underway. Cliffwalker asked the adventurer to visit his son at the grove to find out the truth. The adventurer found the druids of the grove in a state of panic and upon venturing to the top of the ancient tree in the center found Cliffwalker's son dead with the insignia of General Grebo clutched tightly in his dead hand.\nWhen the champion returned to Cliffwalker with evidence of Grebo's duplicity, he and his wife cried out in anguish for their murdered son and confronted Grebo with the adventurer. Though Grebo was outnumbered and fell to the three of them, &lt;a href=\"Masha%20Cliffwalker\"&gt;Masha Cliffwalker&lt;/a&gt; worried that now they would be executed for treason and pleaded with the adventurer to bring the truth of the matter to Krom'gar. Krom'gar reacted angrily to the news and ordered the adventurer to meet him at Cliffwalker Post, where he proceeded to burn the village to the ground. The adventurer was promoted to general for their actions. \nKrom'gar forced Cliffwalker and the adventurer to watch as he sent The Bomb off and obliterated Thal'darah Grove before their eyes. Just as the bomb fell, a portal from &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; appeared and the Warchief &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; himself stepped through the portal and confronted Krom'gar about what he had done. Krom'gar told Garrosh that he was simply following orders. Garrosh asked him if he had ordered Krom'gar to murder innocents and destroy the very lands he was ordered to conquer for the Horde's benefit. Krom'gar, fearing the wrath of the Warchief, cowered in fear while Garrosh lectured him on the meaning of honor he had learned in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;. Garrosh told Krom'gar that his actions had brought great shame to the Horde and to the orcs as a people. Garrosh then proceeded to relieve Krom'gar of command and throw him off the mountain, killing him in the fall.\nGarrosh then turned to the adventurer, believing the adventurer complicit in Krom'gar's actions. However, right before Garrosh was to execute the adventurer as well, Chieftain Cliffwalker spoke up in the adventurer's favor, explaining that they tried to stop Krom'gar and pleading that Garrosh show mercy. Garrosh was taken aback by the Chieftain's actions and released the adventurer. Visibly moved, Garrosh suggested that the adventurer's strength would be most needed now in &lt;a href=\"Desolace\"&gt;Desolace&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Barrens\"&gt;Southern Barrens&lt;/a&gt; and departed back to Orgrimmar.\nWild creatures.\nThe races of the &lt;a href=\"Heretics\"&gt;fallen priests&lt;/a&gt; encountered within Stonetalon Peak during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; are unknown.\nIn the RPG.\nIn Lands of Mystery.\nStonetalon's peak remains verdant and lush, but much of the remainder of the region has been deforested or otherwise destroyed. Certain parts of the land are now the homes of &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Harpy\"&gt;harpies&lt;/a&gt; and other deadly creatures. The greatest danger to the peak, however, is from &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s \u2014 the &lt;a href=\"Venture%20Company\"&gt;Venture Company&lt;/a&gt; gradually destroys the remaining trees and takes the remaining resources from the earth. If this process continues, Stonetalon could soon become as much a wasteland as &lt;a href=\"Desolace\"&gt;Desolace&lt;/a&gt; in the south or the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt; in the east. &lt;a href=\"Druid\"&gt;Druid&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;s take a firm stand here, doing what they can to stop the destruction of nature, but the difficulties between the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; prevent the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; from working together effectively to halt the goblin operations. Many of the tauren still hold the unrealistic hope that the Venture Company can be reasoned with, and this belief prevents progress.\nThe primary source of activity here revolves around the goblins destroying the forest, but other opportunities for adventure exist in the mountains as well.\nHistory.\nThe Stonetalon Mountains survived the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, although the cataclysmic events forever altered the landscape, creating great canyons and valleys within the mountain ranges. The indigenous tauren created a camp south of &lt;a href=\"Mirkfallon%20Lake\"&gt;Mirkfallon Lake&lt;/a&gt;, built upon ancient &lt;a href=\"ley%20line\"&gt;ley line&lt;/a&gt;s. It is perhaps due to these ley lines that the elementals are drawn to the area around &lt;a href=\"Charred%20Vale\"&gt;Charred Vale&lt;/a&gt;. The arrival of the other races is a recent development. The goblins found the region an excellent place to harvest lumber and ore, and the majority of the modern night elf presence in the mountains exists simply to stop the continuing deforestation. While the night elves had settlements in the mountains in ancient times, only the druids remained there continuously over the years, resting safely in their &lt;a href=\"barrow%20den\"&gt;barrow den&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe goblins of Stonetalon are among the finest &lt;a href=\"engineer\"&gt;engineer&lt;/a&gt;s of their race, and their inventions have allowed them to remove massive chunks of the forest in a few short months. This endeavor draws ire from the night elves and tauren alike, who find the deforestation barbaric and dangerous. The night elves take shelter on &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Peak\"&gt;Stonetalon Peak&lt;/a&gt;, maintaining that refuge with the help of &lt;a href=\"dryad\"&gt;dryad&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Keeper%20of%20the%20grove\"&gt;keepers of the grove&lt;/a&gt;. While the majority of the tauren take a similar, defensive role, the &lt;a href=\"Grimtotem%20tribe\"&gt;Grimtotem tribe&lt;/a&gt; strikes back against the goblins. Rumors persist that the Grimtotems prepare to take extreme measures to rid the goblins from their land, including the use of &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;-made toxins. Clearly, if these toxins are misused, they could cause as much damage as the goblins.\nFor all the intelligence the goblins possess, they have yet to understand politics, and this is true on an internal level as well as with the outside world. The &lt;a href=\"trade%20prince\"&gt;trade prince&lt;/a&gt;s have recently caused problems for the Venture Company, and it is looking increasingly likely that the goblins will turn on each other soon.\nRecently, rumors have arisen about a massive series of tunnels beneath the peak, which served as the home for some kind of oracle or sage. The name &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt; has been mentioned, but the chances of him staying in the caverns here seem to be minimal \u2014 but still a possibility.\nA mysterious prophet emerged from the caverns beneath Stonetalon, claiming that the world must prepare itself for a new threat. The sage called for the extermination of the Forsaken, on the grounds that they will be the ones to usher in the next coming of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 and perhaps &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; himself. He sent heroes on a number of anti-Forsaken missions, but the heroes investigated the issue thoroughly, discovering that this \"sage\" was actually an agent of &lt;a href=\"Balzannar\"&gt;Balzannar&lt;/a&gt;, the brother of the &lt;a href=\"Dreadlord\"&gt;Dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Varimathras\"&gt;Varimathras&lt;/a&gt;. Balzannar survived his \"death\" at his brother's hands, and has plotted his revenge against &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas\"&gt;Sylvanas&lt;/a&gt; ever since \u2014 this sage was apparently just one small part of his plan.\nGeography.\nThe Stonetalon Mountains lie along the western coast of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, south of &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt; and north of Desolace and &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt;. The most frequently used entrance to the mountains, however, is a path from the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt; in the east. The mountains were at one time filled with lush forests, but the Venture Company's expeditions and mining operations changed much of the landscape to dusty, barren canyons and desolate cliffs. The only region of the mountains that retains its former splendor is the peak itself, which is protected by the night elves. There is a large river, the &lt;a href=\"Bloodfury%20River\"&gt;Bloodfury&lt;/a&gt;, as well as two large lakes, Mirkfallon and &lt;a href=\"Cragpool%20Lake\"&gt;Cragpool&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe goblin-dominated mountains have few major settlements, but the night elves, tauren, trolls and harpies each claim a small share of the land.\nIn Warcraft: The Roleplaying Game.\nThe Stonetalon Mountains were once a low set of hills giving a gentle view to the ocean waves in the west. The Sundering that tore apart the world drove great sandstone cliffs and mountain peaks high in the air. Water from the eastern coast poured into the newly created chasms and gorges. With the aid of erosion from the &lt;a href=\"Blackwolf%20River\"&gt;Blackwolf River&lt;/a&gt;, the Stonetalon Mountains have expanded into a vast network of canyons and cliff openings that invites adventurers and beasts alike to explore the virgin lands. The Stonetalons rise in central Kalimdor, south of Ashenvale Forest and north of Desolace. The mountain range feeds into the bleak expanse of the Barrens to the east. The atmosphere of the Stonetalon Mountains can best be described as extreme. At the lower elevations it is windy, hot, and dry. It is a harsh place where food cannot grow and flash floods are commonplace in the early summer months. Moisture from the ocean builds up into huge rain clouds, but the towering peaks are too high for the clouds to pass inland. They crash against the mountains\u2019 western side and pour massive sheets of water upon the slopes to run through narrow canyons and back into the ocean or into a valley to dry up in a marshy sink. When the weather turns to rain, the ground grows slick and gray. Walking on a slope or a cliff in the rain is treacherous \u2014 water seeps through the sandstone and threatens to send even careful travelers plummeting to their deaths. Oftentimes, when the clouds expel all their moisture, hot winds push them farther up the slope, surrounding the Stonetalon Peak in a shroud of thundering mist. An immediate feature any visitor notices \u2014 aside from the sheer cliffs and deep crevasses - is the constantly blowing wind. Sometimes a gentle breeze carries fresh air in from the ocean and other times a violent gale stirs up vicious dust devils or brings a storm in from the western mountains. The rugged mountains are home to many wild beasts and only a few civilized habitations. Hippogryphs roost near Mirkfallon Lake in cave complexes high on the slopes. Their nests are defended by large bramble hedgerows, making access nearly impossible without flying. Other creatures found throughout the mountains are striders, hyenas, kobolds, swoops, crag panthers, and even rock elementals and the rare sabertooth cat.\nFurther up the Stonetalon Peak, on its eastern side, are the chaotic lands of the wyverns and drakes. These ancient \u201cflying lizards\u201d have long been rivals for supremacy of the skies. Every once in a while, when other races threaten to interfere, the two will set aside their differences long enough to deal with the interlopers. Agents of the goblin-run Venture Company have also been sighted in the area, searching for potential tracts to deforest and streams of precious ore to plunder with their mining machines. The mountains are known for their Ill Winds. The winds whip through the Stonetalon Mountains with great force, slowing travelers' progress and throwing up clouds of grit and dust that can confuse the best sense of direction. Small and lightly built individuals have even been flung off a mountainside by a particularly forceful gust. The wind in Stonetalons seldom drops below moderate even on a calm day and can change from a steady breeze to a brutal windstorm without warning.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

Stonetalon Peak has long been a sacred place for the two races, and was historically the home of the immortal &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Oracle&lt;/a&gt;, the being who saw the strands of fate as they were woven by the &lt;a href=\"Earth%20Mother\"&gt;Earth Mother&lt;/a&gt;.

The highest peaks of the mountains are thickly forested with evergreens, though the forest thins with lower altitude. The logging of the &lt;a href=\"Venture%20Company\"&gt;Venture Company&lt;/a&gt; has also further thinned the forest, with clear cutting in and around &lt;a href=\"Windshear%20Crag\"&gt;Windshear Crag&lt;/a&gt;. The mountains boast a lake known as &lt;a href=\"Mirkfallon%20Lake\"&gt;Mirkfallon Lake&lt;/a&gt;, around which &lt;a href=\"wyvern\"&gt;wyvern&lt;/a&gt;s make their nests. &lt;a href=\"Charred%20Vale\"&gt;Charred Vale&lt;/a&gt;, once a lush and beautiful area, is now a desolate ruin full of fire elementals.\nThere are no instanced dungeons nor PvP battlegrounds in the Stonetalon Mountains.

At Sun Rock Retreat, &lt;a href=\"Braelyn%20Firehand\"&gt;Braelyn Firehand&lt;/a&gt; seeks to employ Horde adventurers in her quest to staunch the chokehold the dryads and night elven druids have put upon the area. Other NPCs in Sun Rock send Horde players to battle against the &lt;a href=\"harpies\"&gt;harpies&lt;/a&gt; in the Charred Vale. The &lt;a href=\"Grimtotem%20tribe\"&gt;Grimtotem tribe&lt;/a&gt; of renegade tauren have seized a village near the border of the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt; and taken a few hostages. At Windshear Crag, &lt;a href=\"Ziz%20Fizziks\"&gt;Ziz Fizziks&lt;/a&gt; aims to strike directly at the heart of Venture Company's local team \u2014 the &lt;a href=\"leper%20gnome\"&gt;leprous gnome&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Gerenzo%20Wrenchwhistle\"&gt;Gerenzo Wrenchwhistle&lt;/a&gt;. And in a small camp nearby, &lt;a href=\"Kaela%20Shadowspear\"&gt;Kaela Shadowspear&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gaxim%20Rustfizzle\"&gt;Gaxim Rustfizzle&lt;/a&gt; organize the Alliance's opposition in the rugged crags, with particular aims at the nearby goblin invaders and the monsters of the Charred Vale. At the very border of Stonetalon and the Barrens, two Horde NPCs send you into Windshear Crag with similar intentions as Kaela and Gaxim.\nQuests.\nBoth Horde and Alliance quests in the Stonetalon Mountains revolve around driving out the &lt;a href=\"Venture%20Company\"&gt;Venture Company&lt;/a&gt; presence and restoring the area, including the &lt;a href=\"Charred%20Vale\"&gt;Charred Vale&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, each faction has a few quests to interfere with the other. Quests in the area range from level 25 to level 30."}

However, a bridge of energy also required to continue further was not functioning. Thrall hoped that Cairne would find the gemstone required to activate the Spectral Bridge.\nThe section of the caverns that Cairne journeyed through was seemingly natural, albeit with some artificial mechanisms, such as hellish spiked pits. After fighting through the caves and retrieving the &lt;a href=\"Enchanted%20Gemstone\"&gt;Enchanted Gemstone&lt;/a&gt;, known as the spirit stone of Stonetalon Chasm, Cairne fought through a hallway of animated suits of armor and found Thrall.

Thus, there is no way to determine ahead of time when a zone will be hit. It's not unheard of for some servers to see Deathwing scorch one zone countless times while other zones on the same server have yet to be touched.\nDeathwing will spawn at a random time and zone, and any zone in &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; outside of the starting zones and the capital cities is fair game. When he spawns, the sky and surroundings will become dark and blood red (not to be confused with some zone areas in which the sky can also become red, such as when Sentinel Hill in Westfall is being burned after a phase change; a player will be able to tell point blank when Deathwing has entered the zone because, if they are close enough, of a yell that will appear in the chat log when he spawns). \nHe appears to cut a swath across the zone in a mostly straight line with perhaps a turn to accommodate the zone, swinging his head side to side to spew &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Flame\"&gt;Molten Flame&lt;/a&gt; and kill anything in his path. Not everything in the zone will die, only those in his line of fire. Players killed will not lose &lt;a href=\"durability\"&gt;durability&lt;/a&gt;. If a player is on a flight path and has the misfortune (or fortune for those that are looking for the achievement) of flying into Deathwing's path they will receive the achievement, but rather than die, be reduced to 1 hit point. The taxi will continue along its regularly scheduled route.\nThere have been players that did not get the achievement because they were indoors during the event. Also, there is an understood bug in which players were killed, but did not receive the achievement. If the latter happens, players are being asked to open a ticket to have Blizzard correct the situation.\nFrom various player reports and posts, Deathwing's path is not randomized and is a set course in each zone. Therefore, there are places that players can wait at which, should Deathwing spawn, guarantees them the achievement. Sometimes a zone can be hit twice in one day.\nA &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;, once in close visual range of Deathwing, tried to keep up with him and could not, even with &lt;a href=\"Riding\"&gt;Master Riding&lt;/a&gt; and full &lt;a href=\"Pathfinding%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Pathfinding (Classic)&lt;/a&gt; talent. That is a flying speed of 351%, or 451% total movement speed.\nTrivia.\nThe name of the achievement is a reference to \"&lt;a href=\"Stay%20out%20of%20the%20fire\"&gt;standing in the fire&lt;/a&gt;\", a popular phrase describing the act of not moving out of the way of negative debuffs in &lt;a href=\"boss\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt; encounters that is a obvious clue that a detrimental act is in effect."}

There's a huge door on Harrison's side of the ridge leading into the Chamber of the Moon. Fly in, then down the hole to the lower level.\nSchnottz Elite Troopers are still active, but weakened. They are down to 76715 of their 232,000 health. They're also occupied fighting off neutral &lt;a href=\"Ancestral%20Guardian\"&gt;Ancestral Guardian&lt;/a&gt;s, but the guardians will not assist the player.\nThe elites can shoot for upwards of 3,500 damage on cloth and will melee in the 4,500 range. So, not as hard as they hit on the surface, but still, not hitting like a limp noodle.\nKill 10 and another cutscene triggers. Harrison can be seen jumping down from the upper level and running toward the center of the room. The player comes out of the cutscene there to meet him."}

Scholomance received a &lt;a href=\"heroic%20mode\"&gt;heroic mode&lt;/a&gt; along with a content redesign in a manner similar to Deadmines or Shadowfang Keep in the expansion, \"&lt;a href=\"Mists%20of%20Pandaria\"&gt;Mists of Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;\". The layout of the dungeon changed to be less confusing, similar to how the Sunken Temple was done. Five bosses await adventurers there.\nBackground.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, the fortress at Caer Darrow was restored. The manor was the &lt;a href=\"Barov\"&gt;Barov&lt;/a&gt;'s primary residence amidst their far-reaching empire which comprised Caer Darrow, &lt;a href=\"Brill\"&gt;Brill&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Southshore\"&gt;Southshore&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Tarren%20Mill\"&gt;Tarren Mill&lt;/a&gt;, but as the years closed to the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the aristocrats became depressed, greedy, and rageful. After decades of rule, in order to preserve their fortune and hold of the land well past their lifespan, the Barovs made a deal with &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Cult of the Damned&lt;/a&gt;. The once opulent keep of Caer Darrow secretly became the horrific Scholomance, a school of necromancy.\nSix months passed and the keep became decrepit and inhabited by dark undead beings. &lt;a href=\"Acolyte\"&gt;Acolyte&lt;/a&gt;s of the Cult learned their craft, while the family servants were used as experiments for the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;Plague of Undeath&lt;/a&gt;. Finally, while the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; did not even yet fully exist in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, a devastating disease, which was not the Plague that the Scourge would employ later but an experience of Scholomance, was unleashed and ravaged Caer Darrow before a visit from Uther the Lightbringer was scheduled. None survived, while the plague variant compelled its victims to wander as ghosts. The first &lt;a href=\"abomination\"&gt;abomination&lt;/a&gt;s were also created in the catacombs of Scholomance from unearthed corpses that were hacked apart and pieced together. &lt;a href=\"Salramm%20the%20Fleshcrafter\"&gt;Salramm the Fleshcrafter&lt;/a&gt; was one of the first necromancers trained in the halls beneath Scholomance.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the Barovs remained as undead monsters. One of Kel'Thuzad's mightiest agents, the &lt;a href=\"Ravenian\"&gt;Ravenian&lt;/a&gt;, also lived within the recesses of the school \u2014 ever ready to devour those students who showed any sign of weakness. The &lt;a href=\"lich\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt; ruled over the site guarding it for the Scourge, until he was destroyed. The mortal necromancer, , serves as headmaster of the school, succeeding who was headmaster after Kel'Thuzad. Constructs, spirits, and demons are allowed to roam the halls untended, which is unexpected for such practiced necromancers.\nCataclysm.\nWith the death of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; and many of its leaders, including those once found in Scholomance, the Scourge became weakened. With no leadership, Darkmaster Gandling used his ability to control the undead and began to unofficially take control of the Scourge forces using them to keep control of Scholomance, the last holdout west of &lt;a href=\"Thondroril\"&gt;Thondroril&lt;/a&gt;, and attempt to take control of &lt;a href=\"Andorhal\"&gt;Andorhal&lt;/a&gt;. When Gandling failed to take Andorhal, he retreated back into Scholomance to bide his time.\n&lt;a href=\"Alexi%20Barov\"&gt;Alexi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Weldon%20Barov\"&gt;Weldon Barov&lt;/a&gt;s reunited and both turned their attention to Scholomance, attempting to rid their former home of the Scourge.\nDungeon Journal.\n\"Individuals seeking to master the powers of undeath know well of Scholomance, the infamous school of necromancy located in the dark and foreboding crypts beneath Caer Darrow. In recent years, several of the instructors have changed, but the institution remains under the control of Darkmaster Gandling, a particularly sadistic and insidious practitioner of necromantic magic.\"\nMists of Pandaria.\n&lt;a href=\"Lilian%20Voss\"&gt;Lilian Voss&lt;/a&gt; entered Scholomance, hoping to put an end to the necromancers. However, Darkmaster Gandling managed to take and subdue her, in order to turn the undead against her allies.\nAfter being defeated and left for dead by the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s, she managed to escape, leaving behind some gear, among them a &lt;a href=\"Necklace%20of%20the%20Dark%20Blaze\"&gt;necklace&lt;/a&gt; with a dark luster.\nAdventurers also attacked Gandling with the help of &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Alexei%20Barov\"&gt;Lord Alexei Barov&lt;/a&gt; who hoped that his death would lift the curse upon Caer Darrow and would allow Alexei's spirit to finally rest in peace.\nLegion.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt; made a camp in &lt;a href=\"Caer%20Darrow\"&gt;Caer Darrow&lt;/a&gt; and spoke with the Cult of the Damned in Scholomance to get the &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Medivh\"&gt;Book of Medivh&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Kharmeera\"&gt;Kharmeera&lt;/a&gt; sent an adventurer to Scholomance to retrieve &lt;a href=\"%3AAncient%20Arkhana\"&gt;:Ancient Arkhana&lt;/a&gt; from a &lt;a href=\"Pile%20of%20Ancient%20Arkhana\"&gt;Pile of Ancient Arkhana&lt;/a&gt;.\nExploring Azeroth.\n&lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; reported that as of the end of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, Scholomance was still in operation as a school of necromancy, and is under the investigation by the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt;. The Crusade's reports mention that some of the Barovs are still there and &lt;a href=\"Darkmaster%20Gandling\"&gt;Darkmaster Gandling&lt;/a&gt;, still active, has many puppets to play with. This includes &lt;a href=\"Jandice%20Barov\"&gt;Jandice Barov&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rattlegore\"&gt;Rattlegore&lt;/a&gt;. Mathias also reported that one of the ritual hoods used by the Cult. He advised it to be locked in the manor, but the &lt;a href=\"Barovian%20Ritual%20Hood\"&gt;hood&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Barovian%20Family%20Sword\"&gt;Barovian family sword&lt;/a&gt; eventually ended up displayed in &lt;a href=\"Mardenholde%20Keep\"&gt;Mardenholde Keep&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Hearthglen\"&gt;Hearthglen&lt;/a&gt;.\nDungeon - Scholomance.\nThe key to lifting the curse of this place rests in the final death of Darkmaster Gandling.\nIn the RPG.\nThe School of Necromancy is housed in an underground complex beneath the city of &lt;a href=\"Andorhal\"&gt;Andorhal&lt;/a&gt;. The School of Necromancy is a sprawling subterranean labyrinth akin to &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt; on a much smaller scale. &lt;a href=\"Undead\"&gt;Undead&lt;/a&gt; horrors, &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Damned&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"cultist\"&gt;cultist&lt;/a&gt;s haunt the tunnels. &lt;a href=\"Darkmaster%20Gandling\"&gt;Darkmaster Gandling&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"mummy\"&gt;mummified&lt;/a&gt; wretch, teaches students how to raise the dead in the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;'s name.

The enemy level range is 57-62.\nHistory.\nThe Scholomance was founded by the rogue wizard &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; nearly ten years ago. His &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Cult of the Damned&lt;/a&gt; renovated the ancient crypts beneath Caer Darrow (an old Arathorian fortress) and turned them into a school for necromancy. The Cult used this place to train its mortal agents and prepare to unleash the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;Plague of Undeath&lt;/a&gt; upon &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. It has been brewing with young talented wizards and adepts all this time. No one in Lordaeron knew. Originally, the Barov family owned the land and gave it to the Cult in exchange for the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;'s blessing of immortality. Now the Barovs remain as undead monsters. One of Kel'Thuzad's mightiest agents, the &lt;a href=\"Ravenian\"&gt;Ravenian&lt;/a&gt;, also lives within the recesses of the school \u2014 ever ready to devour those students who show any sign of weakness. The &lt;a href=\"lich\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ras%20Frostwhisper\"&gt;Ras Frostwhisper&lt;/a&gt; rules over the site and guards it for the Scourge, but the mortal necromancer, &lt;a href=\"Darkmaster%20Gandling\"&gt;Darkmaster Gandling&lt;/a&gt;, serves as headmaster of the school, succeeding &lt;a href=\"Araj%20the%20Summoner\"&gt;Araj the Summoner&lt;/a&gt; who was headmaster after Kel'Thuzad.\nRegaining access and fast path.\nThe original Scholomance was removed with the revamp and was only available to players on Classic realms. &lt;a href=\"Patch%2010.1.5\"&gt;Patch 10.1.5&lt;/a&gt; added a &lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft%20secrets\"&gt;secret&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Memory%20of%20Scholomance\"&gt;Memory of Scholomance&lt;/a&gt;, which unlocks the original dungeon.\nInside the dungeon, immediately jump off the platform (don't kill the Risen Guards!) down to what would be the &lt;a href=\"Lilian%20Voss%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Lilian Voss&lt;/a&gt; encounter in the modern instance.\nThe Viewing Room Door is locked, so exit west to the \"unnamed central room\" and enter the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Ossuary\"&gt;Great Ossuary&lt;/a&gt; room to the south. Immediately turn left and jump down the hole to face &lt;a href=\"Rattlegore%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Rattlegore&lt;/a&gt; downstairs and loot the &lt;a href=\"Viewing%20Room%20Key\"&gt;Viewing Room Key&lt;/a&gt; from it's corpse. If necessary, the &lt;a href=\"Cracked%20Argent%20Dawn%20Commission\"&gt;Cracked Argent Dawn Commission&lt;/a&gt; is on the southwesternmost bone pile in Rattlegore's room. Run back upstairs, run through the unnamed central room, then Voss's room to the east. Use the Viewing Room Key to open the Viewing Room Door.\nInside the &lt;a href=\"Viewing%20Room\"&gt;Viewing Room&lt;/a&gt;, take an immediate left heading east and open the gate to head downstairs to the north to the &lt;a href=\"Headmaster%27s%20Study\"&gt;Headmaster's Study&lt;/a&gt;. Enter each of the three rooms on both levels and kill all six minibosses and \"all their trash mobs\" to summon &lt;a href=\"Darkmaster%20Gandling%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Darkmaster Gandling&lt;/a&gt;. Note that &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Theolen%20Krastinov%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Doctor Theolen Krastinov&lt;/a&gt; has a good chance of dropping the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20of%20Innocents\"&gt;Blood of Innocents&lt;/a&gt;, which will be necessary for later. Once all six rooms are clear, take Gandling out for one half of the &lt;a href=\"Leaders%20of%20Scholomance\"&gt;Leaders of Scholomance&lt;/a&gt; achievement (and loot the &lt;a href=\"Darkmaster%27s%20Scourgestone\"&gt;Darkmaster's Scourgestone&lt;/a&gt; from his corpse if wearing an &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn%20Commission\"&gt;Argent Dawn Commission&lt;/a&gt;!), then return to the Viewing Room.\nCheck for the Blood of Innocents, and if none of the bosses have dropped it, take the southern exit down to the &lt;a href=\"Laboratory\"&gt;Laboratory&lt;/a&gt; where &lt;a href=\"Ras%20Frostwhisper\"&gt;Ras Frostwhisper&lt;/a&gt; awaits. Also defeat &lt;a href=\"Vectus\"&gt;Vectus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Marduk%20Blackpool\"&gt;Marduk Blackpool&lt;/a&gt; in the Viewing Room on the way back.\nReturn through the Viewing Room, Voss's room, and the unnamed central room, then exit that room to the northeast to enter the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20Summoning\"&gt;Chamber of Summoning&lt;/a&gt; to the north. Interact with the Brazier of the Herald to summon &lt;a href=\"Kirtonos%20the%20Herald%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Kirtonos the Herald&lt;/a&gt;. Stay put in the brazier room until Kirtonos flies in, as the gate to the Chamber of Summoning will close just before Kirtonos becomes attackable. Defeat him for the other half of the Leaders of Scholomance achievement, then go east out of the Chamber of Summoning to the &lt;a href=\"Reliquary%20%28Scholomance%29\"&gt;Reliquary&lt;/a&gt;, and take the steps up on the right side to return to the instance line, defeating the two initial Risen Guards on the way.\nDifficulty.\nAt release, Scholomance was an extremely challenging dungeon. Though ostensibly tuned for 5-players, it was typically raided in 10-man parties, with a difficulty similar to &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Upper Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;. Subsequent patches in the summer of 2006 changed Scholomance drastically. Mobs were weakened slightly, and a great many were removed. However, Scholomance could no longer be run with more than 5 party members. At the time, this \"Scholo &lt;a href=\"Nerf\"&gt;Nerf&lt;/a&gt;\" was a common topic for party chat among long-time players. Loot in Scholomance has changed gradually over time. Originally, each boss dropped some relatively weak loot. The dungeon waned in popularity as players saw little point in running it after they had completed their quests and acquired their &lt;a href=\"Dungeon%20Set%201\"&gt;Dungeon Set 1&lt;/a&gt; hat. Blizzard again patched the dungeon. At this point, Scholomance drops a moderate amount of fairly useful items, including a very small chance at the epic and . The rewards available from the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt; have also broadened through patches. Scholomance is a staple source of Argent Dawn reputation and &lt;a href=\"Scourgestone\"&gt;Scourgestone&lt;/a&gt;s. Players seeking &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt; tradeskill recipes, resistance enchantments or &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn%23Armaments%20of%20the%20Dawn\"&gt;Armaments of the Dawn&lt;/a&gt; often spend a great deal of time in Scholomance or &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;."}

In WoW, these are cylindrical regions in the water with individual fish swimming in circles. Some Schools of Fish are fishable &lt;a href=\"fishing%20pool\"&gt;fishing pool&lt;/a&gt;s while other Schools of Fish are ambiance &lt;a href=\"critter\"&gt;critter&lt;/a&gt;s and are not fishable.\nFishing pools.\nSchools of Fish are &lt;a href=\"fishing%20pool\"&gt;fishing pool&lt;/a&gt;s that contain (primarily) fish. They are location objects found in bodies of water in WoW that have a higher portion of more desirable items that can be fished. Some fish can only be obtained from fishing pools. Schools of Fish can be found in both Azeroth and Outland, so presumably will also be found in new areas in future releases.\nSchools of fish are shallow cylindrical regions within fishable water, just under the surface. They designate small regions within fishable water that give different (often better) kinds of catches than the surrounding water. The graphical representation is more than just the surface definition significant to fishing. You can swim through a School of Fish and see individual fishes swimming around at different depths within the pool.\nMost Schools of Fish (including the ambiance schools below) use the same plain fish model. The &lt;a href=\"Red%20Snapper\"&gt;Red Snapper&lt;/a&gt;s in a &lt;a href=\"School%20of%20Red%20Snapper\"&gt;School of Red Snapper&lt;/a&gt; use a red skin on the fish model.\nSee &lt;a href=\"Fishing%20pool\"&gt;Fishing pool&lt;/a&gt;s for fishing particulars and varieties. \nAmbiance schools of fish.\nSchools of Fish can also be &lt;a href=\"critter\"&gt;critter&lt;/a&gt;s which are for ambiance only and have nothing to do with fishing. Two flavors exist, one that can be targeted that has a yellow (&lt;a href=\"neutral\"&gt;neutral&lt;/a&gt;) label, \"School of Fish\", and one that cannot be targeted and has no label. They can both be found swimming near each other in the same body of water; there does not appear to be a particular reason some are targetable and some are not. The fishes from these schools swim deeper than the &lt;a href=\"fishing%20pool\"&gt;fishing pool&lt;/a&gt; ones and have no surface effect.\nEven though these are made up of individual fish graphic models, they act as a single object. If you kill the targetable school of fish, each individual fish dies and rolls over on its back in unison.\nFish critters of any sort seem to appear only in fishable waters. Absence does not mean the water is not fishable, but presence is a good indication that the water is fishable."}

The four used in the achievements will have very short waiting times, but the other seven battlegrounds will just waste your time - you only have a week!\nBeing reasonable.\nWhile some PvP guilds take Children's Week as a time to get free honor from lots of people who have no idea how to play the battlegrounds, sometimes the opposite faction will permit your faction to achieve the goals. If the opposite faction is being nice and allowing people to achieve these objectives, try to pay that back in letting them do so, too.\nNone of the below requirements require your team to \"win\" the battleground. You should be content to allow the other team to win if they are letting you get the achievement credit. You can play for keeps the other 51 weeks of the year.\nStrategy.\nWarsong Gulch.\nAllow the other faction to assault the flag, then move as a group to assault the flag carrier. This is probably easiest to accomplish midfield where visibility is good. It's likely that the other team will also have members attempting to complete the achievement, so the flag carrier may even be undefended. \nAs a courtesy, you could capture the other faction's flag, then let yourself die in the flag room.\nArathi Basin.\nYou only need to only assault bases for credit, not to capture or defend. Once a base has been assaulted move out quickly. With any luck, the other faction will move in to capture it, and you assault again for another quick achievement. Remember, you only get credit for the assaults, not the defense or the capture. If the other team is moving around as a single pack, split up into two groups. Similarly, if the enemy is spread out, you may have better luck moving as a single pack to easily overtake smaller groups of defenders, if there are any at all.\nIf you want to get this out of the way fast, rush (or ask politely) to be the first on your team to capture stables (Alliance) or the farm (Horde).\nEye of the Storm.\nThis is a hard one because there is only on flag on the map, in the center. Many players on both sides will be vying for that flag. Stand in the middle and keep clicking the flag until you get the \"loading bar\". You will get interrupted many times, but if you get the flag head for one of your active bases as fast as possible.\nYour team only needs to maintain one base for flag captures. Pay attention to which bases you have active so you don't run to the wrong one.\nAlterac Valley.\nYou only get credit for this achievement if you capture one of the four towers or bunkers. You must actually be the capturing person to get credit. Best strategy to to run for the farthest towers from the starting point, as the people running with you will drop off to cap the closer towers.\nBugs.\nDuring the 2009 event, players who had two &lt;a href=\"Orcish%20Orphan%20Whistle\"&gt;Orcish Orphan Whistle&lt;/a&gt; at the same time were not be able to complete this achievement with either whistle. This bug may have been subsequently created because of the &lt;a href=\"Children%27s%20Week%23Patch_changes\"&gt;hotfix&lt;/a&gt; to whistles which allowed players to have more than one. If you experience problems completing the achievement while you have two whistles, try using your original whistle versus the additional whistle you obtained from the matron."}

Schwick comes from the Netherlands and does maintain various guides on the forums.\nAbout Warcraft Weekly EU.\nJust like Warcraft Weekly in the USA, the EU do something similar. Unlike the USA, the EU contributes more than just links to Blizzard posts. It also provides:\nWarcraft Weekly EU is managed by Schwick.\nHistory of Warcraft Weekly EU.\nUnlike &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20Weekly\"&gt;Warcraft Weekly&lt;/a&gt; in the US, Warcraft Weekly EU provides more then just links to the Blizzard posts. &lt;a href=\"Anvilbeard\"&gt;Anvilbeard&lt;/a&gt; who was well known at the time, started to write a similar weekly post. He decided it would be more community content mixed with official news. It was a success, resulting in the EU CMs to support the post by weekly sticky'ing it and posting it on the front-page. &lt;a href=\"Anvilbeard\"&gt;Anvilbeard&lt;/a&gt; lasted 41 issues (+couple of special editions) before he quit writing it.\nSchwick soon toke over and started writing issue 42 (July the 10th) in the honor of &lt;a href=\"Anvilbeard\"&gt;Anvilbeard&lt;/a&gt; and his hard work. Schwick at the time, was known for his work with the topic \"Information about expansion &amp; 1.9/1.10/..\". So he decided to start doing the same &lt;a href=\"Anvilbeard\"&gt;Anvilbeard&lt;/a&gt; did. And he's still doing the newest issues these days.\nWarcraft Weekly became 1 year old between issue 49 and 50. Of course, 50 being a big milestone. A short Blizzard EU Community Manager Q&amp;A followed, revealing that they indeed enjoy the effort that's being done for Warcraft Weekly.\nSince issue 69, Warcraft Weekly EU is translated in Spanish and support by &lt;a href=\"Sherinda\"&gt;Sherinda&lt;/a&gt;. Soon more translations followed. French and German Warcraft Weekly were made around issue 70. The French is done by &lt;a href=\"Cortazar\"&gt;Cortazar&lt;/a&gt; and the German by &lt;a href=\"Ananya\"&gt;Ananya&lt;/a&gt;\nThe translations soon stopped. However, this was followed by a new concept for the Spanish forums. Sherinda made \"It happened on Azeroth\", which is in many ways, Warcraft Weekly. Germany and France still have to follow.\nVarious written guides.\nSchwick does write and maintain various guides and weekly posts on the &lt;a href=\"http%3A//forums-en.wow-europe.com/\"&gt;English WoW forums&lt;/a&gt;.\nGuides\nWeekly posts\nOld guides"}

Keeping the herd safe from the likes of &lt;a href=\"hyena\"&gt;hyena&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Vol%27duni%20Dunecrawler\"&gt;Vol'duni Dunecrawler&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"saurolisk\"&gt;saurolisk&lt;/a&gt;s can be trying at best, but the alpacas' meat and milk are essential to the tribe's survival and surviving off the land has hardened these people. They don't trust outsiders, and marauders holing up in the Scorched Sands Arena regularly plague this fragile settlement, stealing what little supplies they have. The exiles used to frequently trade with the &lt;a href=\"Tortaka%20tribe\"&gt;Tortaka&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"tortollan\"&gt;tortollan&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s aid &lt;a href=\"Julwaba\"&gt;Julwaba&lt;/a&gt; in Zul'Ahjin, she travels to the Scorched Sands Outpost and invites the heroes to join here there. After adventurers arrive, they discover that the outpost is threatened by &lt;a href=\"Mojambo\"&gt;Mojambo&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of a rival gang of exiles of which Razgaji was once a member. While the adventurers help Razgaji convince Mojambo to leave, the marauder leader promises to return and kill Razgaji. Adventurers subsequently help the exiles around the outpost gather supplies and prepare for Mojambo's attack, but soon hear from &lt;a href=\"Zauljin\"&gt;Zauljin&lt;/a&gt; that Mojambo has hired &lt;a href=\"Tongo\"&gt;Tongo&lt;/a&gt;'s gang to assist in the assault. Just as heroes finish killing Tongo and arming the Scorched Sands outcasts with weapons from Tongo's crew, Mojambo's gang attacks the arena. The adventurer uses Tongo's head to challenge Mojambo to a duel that ends in the hostile gang leader's death, thus saving the Scorched Sands Outpost."}

A petOwner of \"0\" refers to the states controlled by the Game. For example, to check the weather state, you want to use a petOwner of \"0\" and a petIndex of \"0\" (which is the only valid petIndex for a petOwner of \"0\"). When petOwner is 1 (player) or 2 (enemy), setting the petIndex to \"0\" also works, but does something different - it refers to any objects (walls, barrels, bombs, mines, missile launchers, etc) or field effects currently in play for that team. For example, the DoT from &lt;a href=\"Flamethrower\"&gt;Flamethrower&lt;/a&gt; is a field effect (\"Turns the battlefield\") that persists through pet swaps. To check the associated states, you need to set petOwner to 1 or 2 and petIndex to \"0\".\nNote that some values corresponding to stateIDs do NOT update correctly. For example, stateID 78 \"STATE_Stat_Gender\" is always 0, regardless of petOwner, petIndex, or the pets in question. This suggests that Blizzard updates stateIDs on an individual basis and probably will not update any stateIDs that they do not actively use in Pet Battles at this time, such as those associated with Poison or Cloning.\nExample.\nHere is an example of a possible use for stateIDs and state values. The following code is reverse engineered from Blizzard's own Battle Pet Ability tooltip parser.\n local AccuracyModifier\n if (C_PetBattles.GetPetType(petOwner, petIndex) == 7) then -- Elementals aren't affected by weathers.\n AccuracyModifier = C_PetBattles.GetStateValue(petOwner, petIndex, 41) + C_PetBattles.GetStateValue(petOwner, 0, 41)\n else\n AccuracyModifier = C_PetBattles.GetStateValue(petOwner, petIndex, 41) + C_PetBattles.GetStateValue(petOwner, 0, 41) + C_PetBattles.GetStateValue(0, 0, 41)\n end\nThe stateID 41 is \"STATE_Stat_Accuracy\". STATE_Stat_Accuracy updates constantly throughout the battle and sums up all of the accuracy effects on specified petOwner/petIndex combination. The first function call gets the accuracy modifier for the current pet and owner. This sum includes all accuracy buffs/debuffs affecting the target.

The key thing here is that Stagger by itself does not mitigate damage, but instead smooths it out. Also, Stagger by itself will not kill a Brewmaster monk. You can be at 1 health with only stagger ticking and not die, but in a raid there are a lot of things that can take that last point.\nThe amount of damage that is staggered is determined by the stagger percentage. Since BfA, the percentage is now determined by agility but is roughly around the 35% proportion in earlier expansions. This is doubled by keeping up &lt;a href=\"Shuffle\"&gt;Shuffle&lt;/a&gt;, and 15% Stagger can be temporarily added with the talent .\nThe Stagger &lt;a href=\"DoT\"&gt;DoT&lt;/a&gt; has three \"Phases\": Light Stagger, Moderate Stagger, and Heavy Stagger. Light Stagger is when the total stagger amount is less than 30% of max health. Moderate Stagger is when the total stagger amount is more than 30% of max health, but less than 60%. Finally, Heavy Stagger is when the total stagger amount is greater than 60% of max health. Stagger can still continue accumulating at this point. While the bar appears to be full at 1m HP of Stagger damage, there is no technical upper limit to the amount of Stagger, as long as the monk is able to stay alive.\nAs was mentioned previously, Stagger does not by itself mitigate damage. For this the monk needs to use &lt;a href=\"Purifying%20Brew\"&gt;Purifying Brew&lt;/a&gt;, which will remove half of the current staggered damage."}

Before the destruction of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, this location was a convergence of &lt;a href=\"ley%20line\"&gt;ley line&lt;/a&gt;s. Like &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt;, the Stair is a &lt;a href=\"sanctuary\"&gt;sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, where PvP combat is disabled.\nSee &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; for information about the Portal's other side.\nHistory.\nInvasion of Draenor.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Expedition\"&gt;Alliance Expedition&lt;/a&gt; launched their counterstrike against the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Horde of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, they destroyed the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;ish forces around the area and fortified it.\nThe Alliance soldiers eventually defended the entrance of the Portal to the bitter end, managing to destroy it to protect &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; from the backlash of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;'s destruction.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nThe Portal in Outland is much larger and more elaborately decorated than the Portal on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, and like the Azeroth side is heavily entrenched by both the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. The Stair's defenses are constantly attacked by &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s, led by a gigantic . The demons include &lt;a href=\"felguard\"&gt;felguard&lt;/a&gt; foot soldiers, &lt;a href=\"infernal\"&gt;infernal&lt;/a&gt;s that rain from the sky, and heavier armored &lt;a href=\"wrathguard\"&gt;wrathguard&lt;/a&gt;. The forces of Azeroth have made portals to both &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; (which players can use), apparently calling in reinforcements to the front. Upon receiving their first quest here, flight paths to &lt;a href=\"Honor%20Hold\"&gt;Honor Hold&lt;/a&gt; (Alliance) and &lt;a href=\"Thrallmar\"&gt;Thrallmar&lt;/a&gt; (Horde) are automatically given to players, allowing them to access Outland while avoiding the legions of demons that surround the Portal. Leading from the Stair of Destiny is the &lt;a href=\"Path%20of%20Glory\"&gt;Path of Glory&lt;/a&gt;, which runs from the base of the Stair to &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Citadel\"&gt;Hellfire Citadel&lt;/a&gt;.\nFor both Alliance and Horde, this will be the place where players receive their first Outland quest.\nSoon after the Alliance, Horde, and the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Order of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; took control of the area, &lt;a href=\"Ragnok%20Bloodreaver\"&gt;Ragnok Bloodreaver&lt;/a&gt; attempted to assault it, but his efforts were thwarted by &lt;a href=\"Jorad%20Mace\"&gt;Jorad Mace&lt;/a&gt; and his allies he had gathered.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nWhen the Dark Portal on Azeroth was redirected to an &lt;a href=\"Draenor%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;alternate Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, the original in Outland was cut off from the &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt;. To work around this, all city portals that were going to the Blasted Lands were rerouted directly to Hellfire Peninsula via the Stair of Destiny.\nLegion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Legion's third invasion of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, demons invaded the Stair of Destiny, killing the Alliance and Horde defenders stationed there. &lt;a href=\"Kor%27vas%20Bloodthorn\"&gt;Kor'vas Bloodthorn&lt;/a&gt; also returned here in order to open a way to Kruul's lair."}

Originally from &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt;, he spent some time in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; but later became an instructor at the &lt;a href=\"Moonbrook\"&gt;Moonbrook&lt;/a&gt; schoolhouse, and also worked as a personal tutor. He eventually developed an indecent attraction to one of his students, a young woman named &lt;a href=\"Tilloa\"&gt;Tilloa&lt;/a&gt;. Stalvan imagined a future with this girl, but her future groom was already arranged by her parents. Tilloa gave Stalvan a begonia, and Stalvan interpreted the gesture as a romantic overture. However, Tilloa clearly only saw Stalvan as her tutor; she compared him to an old uncle, which infuriated Stalvan and drove him to murder. It is unclear exactly what happened, but it was called 'a massacre' by some of the people during the investigation of the legend of Stalvan.\nStalvan seems to have butchered Tilloa and her young groom-to-be with an axe, and quite possibly her entire family as well. In his notes, he claims that the blood he'd spilled paled in comparison to the tears he had shed. He then carefully hid the bodies and retreated back to his home north-east of &lt;a href=\"Darkshire\"&gt;Darkshire&lt;/a&gt;, and remained there until the darkness crept into him and consumed him. He now resides in Manor Mistmantle, lonely and mad, hungering for more revenge on any person who dares come near. Through unknown means, perhaps explained by sheer will to live and kill, Stalvan has become an undead revenant.\n&lt;a href=\"Madame%20Eva\"&gt;Madame Eva&lt;/a&gt; sensed that her granddaughter was in great danger, and sent &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s on &lt;a href=\"The%20Legend%20of%20Stalvan%20quest%20chain\"&gt;the track&lt;/a&gt; of Stalvan, who seemed to be about to murder &lt;a href=\"Alyssa%20Eva\"&gt;Alyssa&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nIn \"Cataclysm\", the legend of Stalvan continues. Stalvan was &lt;a href=\"The%20Legend%20of%20Stalvan%20%2813%29\"&gt;slain by agents of Darkshire&lt;/a&gt; and buried on the grounds of Manor Mistmantle.\nStalvan is revealed to have a brother, &lt;a href=\"Tobias%20Mistmantle\"&gt;Tobias&lt;/a&gt;, who resided in &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20peninsula\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Northgate%20Rebellion\"&gt;civil war&lt;/a&gt; and was afflicted by the &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; curse. After fleeing Gilneas following its plaguing by the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;, Tobias arrives in Darkshire seeking news of his brother, but finding the townspeople afraid to talk about it, telling him only that he was dead. After Clerk Daltry - who aided in the original investigation of Stalvan's whereabouts - directs players to the portions of Stalvan's journal, which had taken and shredded by feral worgen during an attack on Darkshire's town hall, Tobias seeks to find out the truth of what happened, and turns to Madame Eva, who had begun the hunt for Stalvan years before. Using the &lt;a href=\"Mistmantle%20Family%20Ring\"&gt;Mistmantle Family Ring&lt;/a&gt; carried by Tobias (Stalvan had dropped a similar ring as proof of decease in the original quest), Madame Eva directs players back to Manor Mistmantle, where Stalvan will rise from his grave seeking revenge, and must be destroyed again (in &lt;a href=\"Mistmantle%27s%20Revenge\"&gt;Mistmantle's Revenge&lt;/a&gt;).\nQuests.\nStalvan was the object of a thirteen-part quest thread in which you must decipher his identity and uncover his past through the clues he has left behind. The quests culminated with killing Stalvan and bringing the &lt;a href=\"Mistmantle%20Family%20Ring\"&gt;Mistmantle Family Ring&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Madame%20Eva\"&gt;Madame Eva&lt;/a&gt;.\nExternal links.\n "}

Once, when the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; attacked, Gruff realized that although he was a prisoner, he had to help keep the ship afloat in order to survive. So he climbed to the top of the mast with a rifle he got off a dead body and shot Alliance sailors who were attempting to set fire to the ship. It broke his heart a little bit each time he shot one down, and now he lives a life of self-loathing, missing his mountains, but forced to aid the pirates when they come under fire. His time with weapons and ammunition is closely monitored, but he is developing a plan, and may someday turn against his captors, whether he goes down with the ship or not. He knows that he has done too much damage to the Alliance to ever rejoin it, but he has learned enough of the sea to dream of touring in his own ship, gathering exiles and vagabonds like himself.

(First charge goes for 1600/2000 on 14k armor.) As the enrage wears off he still keeps the growth charge which makes the next growth even more damaging.\nWhen he enrages, he also gets a 70% movement speed debuff, so just have the tank &lt;a href=\"kite\"&gt;kite&lt;/a&gt; him till it wears off, making him an incredible easy fight.\nQuests.\nGrulloc's bag of goodies is used by to repay for creating him a poison put in an ogre clan called &lt;a href=\"Bloodmaul\"&gt;Bloodmaul&lt;/a&gt;'s alcohol kegs. In order to get this bag of unknown contents, you have Rexxar's pet named &lt;a href=\"Huffer\"&gt;Huffer&lt;/a&gt; (a &lt;a href=\"boar\"&gt;boar&lt;/a&gt;) distract him. The Alliance version of this quest instead has Baron Sablemane give the player a sleeping potion to use on Grulloc.\nGrulloc is also an objective of the quest &lt;a href=\"Grulloc%20Has%20Two%20Skulls\"&gt;Grulloc Has Two Skulls&lt;/a&gt; where it has the player kill Grulloc in order to loot his skull."}

They make good guides and can carry many times their own weight. They have a trade route that stretches across the zone called the &lt;a href=\"Burlap%20Trail\"&gt;Burlap Trail&lt;/a&gt;, which they will need &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s' help with as this is a very dangerous area. The grummles regularly trade with the &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt;, bringing essential supplies to the &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan\"&gt;Shado-Pan&lt;/a&gt; forces guarding the great &lt;a href=\"Serpent%27s%20Spine\"&gt;Serpent's Spine&lt;/a&gt; wall, and for a happy-go-lucky people they take this task quite seriously. Such trade endeavors were established long ago, and have forged one of the strongest ties possible between two sapient species on &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nThe grummle were created during the reign of the &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Tian\"&gt;Emperor Tian&lt;/a&gt;. They were &lt;a href=\"trogg\"&gt;trogg&lt;/a&gt;s changed using the powers of the waters of the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt;. Their arms were made stronger, their sense of direction and better, and their sense of smell more acute. They have strong cognitive skills: they know every mountain trail and never forget one. Grummles are intelligent, and are considered shrewd negotiators.\nAfter their creation, the grummles were put into use as a servant species of the &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt;. They were settled in the mountainous region of the &lt;a href=\"Kun-Lai%20Summit\"&gt;Kun-Lai Summit&lt;/a&gt;. Kun-Lai, originally populated by &lt;a href=\"mountain%20hozen\"&gt;mountain hozen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"jinyu\"&gt;jinyu&lt;/a&gt;, had been captured by Emperor &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen\"&gt;Lei Shen&lt;/a&gt; after a legendary duel with &lt;a href=\"Xuen\"&gt;Xuen&lt;/a&gt;, the White Tiger. Lei Shen and his successors invested in the region heavily, including building the great wall, the &lt;a href=\"Serpent%27s%20Spine\"&gt;Serpent's Spine&lt;/a&gt; at its western reaches, as well as creating the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Emperors\"&gt;Valley of Emperors&lt;/a&gt;, the burial place of the mogu dignitaries.\nSince northern Kun-Lai is mountainous, featuring the highest peaks of the whole continent (&lt;a href=\"Mount%20Neverest\"&gt;Mount Neverest&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kota%20Peak\"&gt;Kota Peak&lt;/a&gt;), and the trails through the mountains are twisty, windy, cold, dangerous and unforgiving, the mogu were eager to use the grummles to navigate these roads, transporting supplies from the farmlands in the east and south of the region to the wall. The main passageway established by the grummles, the so-called &lt;a href=\"Burlap%20Trail\"&gt;Burlap Trail&lt;/a&gt;, has been in use since the mogu times. Beyond this, grummles were also used as messengers and deliverymen throughout the expansive &lt;a href=\"Mogu%20empire\"&gt;empire&lt;/a&gt;. Surpassing these official functions, the ingenious grummles also started acting as merchants and traders, roles that they have kept all the way until today.\nWhen some twelve thousand years ago, during the rule of Emperor &lt;a href=\"Lao-Fe\"&gt;Lao-Fe&lt;/a&gt; the pandaren slaves of the Mogu Empire erupted into open rebellion against their masters, the other enslaved races of Pandaria soon joined them in their revolution, and the grummles were no exception. Legends imply that already before the revolution the grummles had deliberately sabotaged mogu efforts at gathering intelligence about the brewing storm. The grummles' stand by the other slave species had key importance on the outcome of the war. Not only did they provide their services to the rebels, they also stopped doing the same for the mogu. This meant that mogu messages and supplies were undelivered, and thus their armies in the field starved while full garrisons of troops sat idly, oblivious to the events. After the final overthrow of the mogu regime at the end of the bloody civil war, the grummles joined the newly founded &lt;a href=\"Pandaren%20Empire\"&gt;Pandaren Empire&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Burlap Trail.\nThe grummles had to find their role in this new world order. Considering themselves to be packers and explorers but not fighters, and clearly understanding that being brave is not one of their strong sides, they looked for protection. As a solution to this situation, a longstanding agreement was worked out with the &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan\"&gt;Shado-Pan&lt;/a&gt;, in which the &lt;a href=\"monk\"&gt;monk&lt;/a&gt;s would guard the trade routes of the grummles and the grummles would keep &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan%20Monastery\"&gt;their monastery&lt;/a&gt; and the wall supplied. The Burlap Trail became the lifeline of the Shado-Pan, and their guards were stationed in the major grummle settlements alongside the trail. The grummles would move perishable goods from the farmlands to the Shado-Pan strongholds, and also find opportunities to trade with the denizens of Kun-Lai. This arrangement proved to be stable and the source of much prosperity to both sides.\nAt the eastern terminus of the Burlap Trail, north of the &lt;a href=\"Kun-Lai%20Pass\"&gt;Kun-Lai Pass&lt;/a&gt;, one finds the largest known grummle settlement, the &lt;a href=\"Grummle%20Bazaar\"&gt;Grummle Bazaar&lt;/a&gt;. This marketplace is the primary meeting point of the pandaren farmers of the southern plains and the grummle packers traversing the mountains. Pandaren merchants travel here to trade with the grummles, and even though the roads are not easy and the grummles are known to be good negotiators, enterprising traders can expect to make a reasonable profit for their efforts. Whatever is not sold at the market is organized into caravans to ferry them towards the west through the mountains. Caravans are usually led by &lt;a href=\"Grummle%20Trail%20Guide\"&gt;trail guides&lt;/a&gt;, who act as armed guides and are also relatively capable warriors. They also contain dedicated &lt;a href=\"Trail%20Yakker\"&gt;trail yakkers&lt;/a&gt;, handling the yaks of the caravan and also providing limited healing services. Apart from these specialists, the rest of the caravans are made up of &lt;a href=\"Trail%20Packer\"&gt;packers&lt;/a&gt;, carrying the heavy payloads of goods. Before leaving, the caravans are blessed by the organizers, who also try to lift spirits by lighting incenses alongside the road.\nThe first leg of the Burlap Trail leads northwest from the Grummle Bazaar through the foothills of the large mountains of Kun-Lai. The first major stop is the Pandaren-ran inn, &lt;a href=\"One%20Keg\"&gt;One Keg&lt;/a&gt;, nested at the base of Mount Neverest. The inn is a departure point for expeditions up the mountain. Although the grummles marked the most viable path up the mountain with flags, it is still considered to be extremely unlucky to try and ascend on the peak without grummle guides. Grummles from One Keg can transport people and supplies to the &lt;a href=\"Neverest%20Basecamp\"&gt;Neverest Basecamp&lt;/a&gt; in carts, however the &lt;a href=\"Seeker%27s%20Folly\"&gt;Seeker's Folly&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 with its continuous snow calamities \u2013 can only be accessed on foot.\nThe most dangerous section of the Burlap Trail is the area around the &lt;a href=\"Burlap%20Waystation\"&gt;Burlap Waystation&lt;/a&gt;. The station itself is an unexceptional outpost set up by the grummles on a small hill roughly halfway between One Keg and the &lt;a href=\"Kota%20Basecamp\"&gt;Kota Basecamp&lt;/a&gt; to the west. It used to be protected by the Shado-Pan, and offered basic amenities to the travelers. However with the war in Pandaria, the station's area is now under constant attack by the &lt;a href=\"mountain%20hozen\"&gt;mountain hozen&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe last grummle outpost on the Burlap Trail is the &lt;a href=\"Kota%20Basecamp\"&gt;Kota Basecamp&lt;/a&gt;, found at the northeast foothills of the second highest mountain in Pandaria, &lt;a href=\"Kota%20Peak\"&gt;Kota Peak&lt;/a&gt;. The camp is almost exclusively populated by grummles. This place is most known for the &lt;a href=\"Kota%20Blend\"&gt;Kafa'kota blend&lt;/a&gt;, a pleasant, refreshing and sobering drink. It is made of &lt;a href=\"Kafa%27kota%20Berry\"&gt;berries&lt;/a&gt; harvested on Kota Peak.\nThe last leg of the Burlap Trail, yet again in relatively safe terrain, is the route between Kota Peak and the Shado-Pan Monastery. Grummles are allowed to enter the monastery to trade with the Shado-Pan, who are usually friendly to them. The Shado-Pan of the monastery sometimes also utilize the grummles as mountain guides and pack carriers to conserve the energy of travelers.\nMists of Pandaria.\nBecause of the &lt;a href=\"mantid\"&gt;mantid&lt;/a&gt; swarm, the hard pressed Shado-Pan had withdrawn its protectors from the Burlap Trail to the Serpent's Spine, leaving the trail undefended and forcing the grummles to hire mercenary &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20the%20Peak\"&gt;Guardians of the Peak&lt;/a&gt; to protect them. The closedown of the Shado-Pan Monastery meant that the grummles delivering supplies to the monastery were denied access to the building and the Shado-Pan even refused to trade with them.\n&lt;a href=\"Yaungol\"&gt;Yaungol&lt;/a&gt; warriors from the &lt;a href=\"Ruqin%20tribe\"&gt;Ruqin tribe&lt;/a&gt; started attacking caravans returning from the Burlap Trail, robbing them of their &lt;a href=\"luckydo\"&gt;luckydo&lt;/a&gt;s. Later the trail came under a full yaungol blockade. Meanwhile the mountain hozen leader &lt;a href=\"The%20Ook%20of%20Dook\"&gt;Ook of Dook&lt;/a&gt; declared a &lt;a href=\"The%20Hozen%20Ravage\"&gt;ravage&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Broketooth%20tribe\"&gt;Broketooth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Knucklethump%20tribe\"&gt;Knucklethump tribe&lt;/a&gt;s descended on the poorly defended Burlap Waystation, and razed it to the ground. Hozen also began preying on grummle caravans, killing or capturing grummles and looting their supplies and luckydos.\nThe grummles hired &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to take care of these threats. Adventurers entered the Ruqin tribe's fire camp, retook the luckydos stolen from the grummle caravans, and significantly thinned the ranks of the yaungol. The adventurers also proved to be very effective against the hozen. Instructed by the &lt;a href=\"Brother%20Rabbitsfoot\"&gt;Brothers Rabbitsfoot&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Brother%20Yakshoe\"&gt;Yakshoe&lt;/a&gt;, they were able to inflict serious damage to both the Broketooth and Knuckethump hozen and free many of the captured grummles before finally eliminating the hozen chief, Ook of Dook himself. These victories secured the Burlap Trail and brought an end to the ravage. Moreover, the grummles at Kota Base Camp were able to find a way to tame a yeti and used it to wreak havoc among the &lt;a href=\"Ookin%20tribe\"&gt;Ookin tribe&lt;/a&gt; of mountain hozen.\nSociety.\nGrummles interacting with outsiders are exclusively males. However, we do know that grummle females exist, even if they are scarce. Kinship seems to be a strong organizing influence for the grummles. Many grummles encountered along the Burlap Trail and beyond have a first name relating to male kinship \u2013 brother, cousin, uncle and nephew.\nThe grummles do not have a central government, but many of them are integrated into various business networks. Caravan masters organize trade and handle business alongside long trade routes. The only known caravan master is &lt;a href=\"Lucky%20Eightcoins\"&gt;Lucky Eightcoins&lt;/a&gt;. Enterprising grummles also form ventures, such as the &lt;a href=\"Keenbean%20Kafa%20Co.\"&gt;Keenbean Kafa Co.&lt;/a&gt; ran by &lt;a href=\"Uncle%20Keenbean\"&gt;Uncle Keenbean&lt;/a&gt;. Grummles seem to have a credit system running at the &lt;a href=\"Grummle%20Bazaar\"&gt;Grummle Bazaar&lt;/a&gt;, paying later to ranchers for &lt;a href=\"yak\"&gt;yak&lt;/a&gt;s delivered by intermediaries. The most important occupation for grummles is still that of packers. Their key equipment is the &lt;a href=\"grummlepack\"&gt;grummlepack&lt;/a&gt;, the large backpack used to ferry around goods. Grummles also provide services for a number of locations throughout the Kun-Lai Summit, including the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20White%20Tiger\"&gt;Temple of the White Tiger&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan%20Fallback\"&gt;Shado-Pan Fallback&lt;/a&gt;.\nGrummles are highly superstitious, and rely heavily on luck and fortune to succeed in their ventures. Central to their culture is the concept of &lt;a href=\"luckydo\"&gt;luckydo&lt;/a&gt;, which is an object, person or place of good luck and fortune. It is said that a luckydos are their most prized personal possession. Most grummles carry several lucky charms with them, and many of them consider these important enough to name themselves after their favorite luckydo, the one that brings most fortune to them (perhaps by being the most pungent smelling one). These objects are usually small, and always smelly \u2013 grummles believe that they can distinguish between good luck and bad luck through their uncanny smelling ability. It is said that a grummle always trusts his nose above everything else. They are highly suspicious of luck they can't smell, since they believe that can easily turn out to be someone else's luck. The opposite of a luckydo is a luckydont (sometimes spelled luckydon't).\nIn many ways, yaks are in the center of grummle culture. They either buy their yaks from ranchers, or capture wild yak themselves using lassos. They accompany the grummles on their treks through the mountain as beasts of burden. They carry carts, and they can even be trained to independently carry messages over longer distances. Their wool is used to create clothes and &lt;a href=\"Yak%20Incense\"&gt;incense&lt;/a&gt;. Their various body parts and accessories are sources of luckydos and amulets.\nYaks also form the staple of grummle cuisine. A specific grummle way to prepare a yak is to make a &lt;a href=\"Lukewarm%20Yak%20Roast%20Broth\"&gt;lukewarm yak roast broth&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Yak%20Milk\"&gt;Yak milk&lt;/a&gt; is praised for its nutrients and can be used to help the recuperation of injured persons. Goat meat and milk are also used frequently by grummle cooks. &lt;a href=\"Steaming%20Goat%20Noodles\"&gt;Steaming goat noodles&lt;/a&gt; is a grummle specialty dish prepared from mutton and goat milk. Grummles also have a sweet tooth \u2013 they love their \"crunchies and munchies\", as they call them. The most famous grummle dessert is the &lt;a href=\"grummlecake\"&gt;grummlecake&lt;/a&gt;, which is also supposed to help travelers with the acclimation to the mountain air. According to &lt;a href=\"Li%20Goldendraft\"&gt;Li Goldendraft&lt;/a&gt;, grummles hold their brew quite well; the trick to outdrink one is to not stop, and with luck they will pass out before you do. This affinity for alcohol is a trait shared with &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt;, who also happen to be a different offshoot of the &lt;a href=\"earthen\"&gt;earthen&lt;/a&gt;."}

They are typically equipped with mighty axes and battle-worn armor.\nGrunts appeared as units on the orc or Horde side in ', ' and \"\". They are the classic counterpart to human &lt;a href=\"Footman\"&gt;footmen&lt;/a&gt; but are stronger than them in \"Warcraft III\". They do, however, cost much more. In all the strategy games they are voiced by &lt;a href=\"Bill%20Roper\"&gt;Bill Roper&lt;/a&gt;.\nFirst War.\nGrunts were the first level of warrior in the service of the orc's armies. Trained for close combat, these soldiers made excellent fodder for wading through &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; forces. Use of the &lt;a href=\"axe\"&gt;axe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"shield\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt; was their specialty, and they were hearty fighters with a taste for blood.\nSecond War.\nThose &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s who distinguished themselves enough in the arts of war to be trained as grunts epitomized the merciless spirit of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Equipped with mighty &lt;a href=\"axe\"&gt;axe&lt;/a&gt;s and battle-worn armor, they were prepared to fight to the death. Devoted to the Horde and to their &lt;a href=\"Clan%23Orcish%20clan%20system\"&gt;clans&lt;/a&gt;, the grunt lusted for battle - wanting nothing more than to wade into the field of carnage and die a bloody death surrounded by the bodies of his fallen enemies.\nVeteran grunts were sometimes put at work in &lt;a href=\"Blacksmith%20%28building%29%23Orc%20blacksmith%202\"&gt;blacksmith&lt;/a&gt; shops due to their understanding of the value of strong steel. Some grunts were also former &lt;a href=\"raider\"&gt;raider&lt;/a&gt;s, degraded to being footsoldiers after their ranks were disbanded by &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt;.\nThird War.\nGrunts are the first and last line of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s defense. These powerful fighters arm themselves with mighty battle-axes and display all of the savagery and cunning of their race. In past generations, grunts were characterized by their depravity and brutality. But now, under the visionary leadership of &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, the grunts more closely resemble their savage, yet noble ancestors.\n&lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Grunt\"&gt;Chaos Grunt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fel%20Orc%20Grunt\"&gt;Fel Orc Grunt&lt;/a&gt; are red skinned orc grunts that are campaign only units."}

These are combined into packages which are in turn hierarchically combined with other pledge packages for &lt;a href=\"buff\"&gt;buff&lt;/a&gt;s and rewards. \nAll of the Love is in the Air pledge gifts are non-functional as regards their name and picture. You cannot read a Grunt's Card.\nSource.\nGrunt's Card is one of two pledge items (the other is ) that can be found inside a or a , given by Orgrimmar Grunts as part of the Love is in the Air event. There is always one and only one of these two pledge items in each of these containers. (The Pledge of Friendship contains only the pledge item; the Pledge of Adoration contains functional gifts as well.) The odds of getting either pledge item appear to be about even, but in the short run you are likely to get a stack of one while trying for the other. \nYou will need one free inventory slot or a current stack of less than 20 Grunt's Cards in order to remove a Grunt's Card from its container. To remove the Grunt's Card from its container, right click the Pledge of Adoration or Pledge of Friendship to open it. \nIngredient.\nIf you have five or more Grunt's Cards in your inventory, right clicking on any of them will consume five and create a &lt;a href=\"Package%20of%20Cards\"&gt;Package of Cards&lt;/a&gt;.\nNotes.\nInventory space.\nThe Pledge of Adoration: Orgrimmar and Pledge of Friendship: Orgrimmar container items do not stack. Opening your Pledges of Friendship: Orgrimmar should save inventory space, since both pledge items stack 20 high. It is generally useful to NOT &lt;a href=\"autoloot\"&gt;autoloot&lt;/a&gt; a Pledge of Adoration container - the Love is in the Air event items quickly consume any available inventory space. If you have autoloot turned on, you can hold down the shift key while right clicking the Pledge of Adoration to not autoloot it. You can then remove only the items that you need at the moment. \nBe careful when combining these into packages, the Grunt's Card pledge item stacks 20 high, but the Package of Cards package item does not stack at all.\nOrgrimmar Grunts.\nThere are both male and female s, so your character can use either a &lt;a href=\"Cologne%20Bottle\"&gt;Cologne Bottle&lt;/a&gt; for the female grunts or a &lt;a href=\"Perfume%20Bottle\"&gt;Perfume Bottle&lt;/a&gt; for the male grunts to get the \"give a \" dialog, if you want to gather these pledge items. \nAll of the Orgrimmar Grunts are &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s. For the Love is in the Air gift items given by non-guard NPCs, the race of the NPC, not the location, determines which city's gift item you get. Since all of a city's guard NPCs are the same race, the distinction does not come into play for the pledge items. \nTransferability.\nThis is a &lt;a href=\"conjured\"&gt;conjured&lt;/a&gt; item. It cannot be sold at the &lt;a href=\"Auction%20House\"&gt;Auction House&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mail\"&gt;mail&lt;/a&gt;ed nor put in a &lt;a href=\"guild%20bank\"&gt;guild bank&lt;/a&gt; tab, but it can be given, sold, or traded with other &lt;a href=\"player%20character\"&gt;player character&lt;/a&gt;s using the &lt;a href=\"trade\"&gt;trade&lt;/a&gt; window. Unfortunately, that means you cannot pass these directly to an &lt;a href=\"alt\"&gt;alt&lt;/a&gt; on the same account.\nDuration.\nThis item is &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar_Gift_Collection%23Notes\"&gt;primarily&lt;/a&gt; useful during Love is in the Air and the seven day duration of the item is longer than the event, so is not a handicap. It does prevent you from saving these for the following year.\nSee also.\nThere is a plethora of individual items that are combined in this seasonal event to form successively larger collections. For details, see the main &lt;a href=\"Love%20is%20in%20the%20Air\"&gt;Love is in the Air&lt;/a&gt; article."}

After the fall of &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt; sought to scour the rest of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;'s races. The &lt;a href=\"Thunderlord%20clan\"&gt;Thunderlord clan&lt;/a&gt; reveled in the slaughter of their ancient enemies: the gronn, &lt;a href=\"ogron\"&gt;ogron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"magnaron\"&gt;magnaron&lt;/a&gt;, and ogres. Yet Gruul was one of the few gronn to escape the Horde's onslaught. From his lair in the mountains, he fended off numerous Thunderlord assaults. Casualties grew so great that the clan's chieftain &lt;a href=\"Fenris%20Wolfbrother\"&gt;Fenris Wolfbrother&lt;/a&gt; backed off.\nThe Dragonkiller.\nOn &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, the black dragonflight has long been hated and hunted by both mortals and other &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;s. This is not so on Draenor. Indeed, dragons are not a species native to Draenor. When the infamous &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspect\"&gt;Dragon Aspect&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, discovered the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; and Draenor, he felt sure that few of Draenor's denizens would dare challenge the dragons. Thus, it was during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; that he traveled to Draenor and hid clutches of his eggs all over the world. Returning to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, he left behind only a small number of &lt;a href=\"drake\"&gt;drake&lt;/a&gt;s to guard the eggs.\nHowever, Deathwing had made a serious miscalculation by leaving some of his eggs in Gorgrond and &lt;a href=\"Frostfire%20Ridge\"&gt;Frostfire Ridge&lt;/a&gt;. The gronn living in the area were not pleased by this potential challenge to their sovereignty. Tension soon erupted into conflict. Led by the mighty Gruul, the gronn and their ogre servants proved too much for the outnumbered black dragon guardians to handle. Nearly every dragon was torn from the sky by the diabolic incantations of the &lt;a href=\"Bladespire%20clan\"&gt;Bladespire clan&lt;/a&gt; and then impaled by Gruul on the stone spires of the mountains. The bones still scattered about &lt;a href=\"Dragons%27%20End\"&gt;Dragons' End&lt;/a&gt; serve as a stark reminder of the black dragons' defeat.\nBeyond the Dark Portal.\nGruul is the father of the seven gronn lords of the ogres, and the most powerful of them. Although he seems to be nothing but a cruel brute, he possesses intelligence. In the events unfolded during the &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Invasion of Draenor&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 shortly after &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; invaded his home \u2014 Gruul was met by the lost heroes of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;. They were after the &lt;a href=\"Skull%20of%20Gul%27dan\"&gt;Skull of Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; which Deathwing possessed. After that, Gruul and his ogre minions, along with the heroes, challenged Deathwing from his perch in &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Blade's Edge Mountains&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 killing his eggs and impaling his lesser black drakes on the mountain spikes. Infuriated by this act, Deathwing landed on top of them and attacked Gruul. Although clearly no match for the mad &lt;a href=\"Aspect\"&gt;Aspect&lt;/a&gt;'s power, Gruul was saved by &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;'s miraculous spell when he disassembled some of the adamantium plates that were holding Deathwing's unstable body together resulting in Deathwing's retreat. This led to a clear devastation for the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; in Outland. The results can still be seen as impaled black dragon corpses all over Blade's Edge Mountains. This earned him the title the Dragonkiller.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nBy this time, Gruul's \"small amount\" of ogres he ruled during the Horde's rise seems to have expanded, now including clans that were once among the Gorian Empire such as the &lt;a href=\"Bladespire%20clan\"&gt;Bladespire clan&lt;/a&gt;. Gruul is the final boss of &lt;a href=\"Gruul%27s%20Lair\"&gt;Gruul's Lair&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Blade's Edge Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. He drops &lt;a href=\"Tier%204\"&gt;Tier 4&lt;/a&gt; Legs tokens. He is the father of seven Gronn: &lt;a href=\"Goc\"&gt;Goc&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gorgrom%20the%20Dragon-Eater\"&gt;Gorgrom the Dragon-Eater&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Grulloc\"&gt;Grulloc&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maggoc\"&gt;Maggoc&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Slaag\"&gt;Slaag&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Skulloc%20Soulgrinder\"&gt;Skulloc Soulgrinder&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Durn%20the%20Hungerer\"&gt;Durn the Hungerer&lt;/a&gt;. \nThis boss is also part of (what used to be) the &lt;a href=\"Serpentshrine%20Cavern\"&gt;Serpentshrine Cavern&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"attunement\"&gt;attunement&lt;/a&gt; quest &lt;a href=\"The%20Cudgel%20of%20Kar%27desh\"&gt;The Cudgel of Kar'desh&lt;/a&gt;. This quest requires two signets. One of which, the &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Signet\"&gt;Earthen Signet&lt;/a&gt;, drops directly from Gruul. The other, the &lt;a href=\"Blazing%20Signet\"&gt;Blazing Signet&lt;/a&gt;, drops from &lt;a href=\"Nightbane%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Nightbane&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt;. Serpentshrine Cavern no longer requires attunement as of June 20, 2007.\n&lt;a href=\"Lady%20Malande\"&gt;Lady Malande&lt;/a&gt; reported Gruul's death to &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; one day before the siege of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt;."}
{"id": "513697", "revid": "22514", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=513697", "title": "Gruul the Dragonkiller (tactics)", "text": "Gruul the Dragonkiller is the final boss in &lt;a href=\"Gruul%27s%20Lair\"&gt;his lair&lt;/a&gt;.\nTactics.\nOverall.\nPlayers will have ~10 minutes to defeat Gruul (he has roughly 3.4 million hp), otherwise the buff stacks will annihilate the tank. At 16+ grows, Hurtful Strike can theoretically one shot your OT, making it vital to keep them topped off after every strike. The fight is basically a dps race, with an emphasis on raid survival. \nA high-stamina/high-DPS raid is favored for this encounter. Melee DPS is at a disadvantage, as Cave-ins often spawn on top of Gruul, and they may have to run out repeatedly in preparation for his Ground Stomp.\nThe focus is primarily on the healers keeping several \"tanks\" alive, or in the case of dps, simply staying alive. Cave Ins, while becoming increasingly deadly, only tick after 3 seconds, allowing the quick-footed to exit without damage. Shatter positioning is very important, as too many deaths quickly lead to lethally low DPS.\nThis is one of the few fights where &lt;a href=\"Main%20Tank\"&gt;Main Tank&lt;/a&gt; death is not an automatic wipe. Tanking duties simply shift down the ladder of offtanks, with the previous Hurtful Strike soaker becoming the MT.\nThe main priority for the healers should be to keep track of the silence and have 4/5 healers hit HoTs on the tank to stay alive through the silence. This takes some timing and practice.\nPreparation.\nIf a Paladin in your raid has Improved Concentration Aura, it may help to place that person in a group composed of healers; the &lt;a href=\"silence%20effect\"&gt;silence&lt;/a&gt; duration mechanic can save your raid on Reverberation at a high Growth stacks, by reducing the amount of time they are silenced. It's also helpful for resto shaman to have the silence duration reduction talent, as there will be a lot of moving during the fight and Gruul's room is very large.\nAvoiding Shatter.\nRogues can use &lt;a href=\"Cloak%20of%20Shadows\"&gt;Cloak of Shadows&lt;/a&gt; to remove the \"Gronn Lords Grasp\" movement debuff. Likewise, Paladins can also use &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Shield\"&gt;Divine Shield&lt;/a&gt; to remove the movement debuff, and mages ability Ice Block remove the debuff as well, but note this does NOT prevent any damage being done because of Gronn Lords Grasp. Druids can shapeshift, but the debuff will reappear 1\u20132 seconds after.\nThe Ground Slam knockback does not properly function if the player is on the rocks around the outer ledges of the room. Players there will be pushed only a short distance, if at all.\nShatter will affect targets beyond line of sight, however players can wedge themselves into niches along the outside to avoid being launched inward toward Gruul.\nIf you land quite some distance from Gruul, you are advised to run straight toward the outer wall, or toward the wall at an angle away from someone if you land near them. If you land between closer to Gruul than you are to the wall, and you can see other characters between you and the wall, move a bit toward the wall but be sure you keep your distance from those who are closer, and watch for tanks who will be moving toward Gruul. The key to a raid surviving Shatter is to trust those behind you to not come too close and kill you, and for those behind others to maintain their distance from those ahead of them. However, because the result of Ground Slam is completely dependent on chance, sometimes even a well-prepared raid will get an unlucky Ground Slam/Shatter combo that leads to a wipe.\nMain Tank Death at 1/4 HP.\nIt is common for many guilds attempting to defeat Gruul to lose their MT around 1/4 health on Gruul. This is usually because the designated healers for the group are running low on mana and/or are not properly getting HoT rotations in before the silence. This fight is important for healers to have high mp5 to last a full 8 minutes. Healers should not be asking for &lt;a href=\"Innervate\"&gt;Innervate&lt;/a&gt; any sooner than 5\u20136 minutes into the fight.\nIf your tank dies a lot during the AoE silence....\nIf your group consists of 3 tanks (which it should because of High King), you designate a main tank (tanking Gruul of course), a Hurtful Strike tank, and a third tank that is also building up aggro (just in case one of the other tanks die). This third tank should &lt;a href=\"Intervene\"&gt;Intervene&lt;/a&gt; the main tank to take a hit once during the AoE silence so the healers don't have to worry about the main tank dying due to lack of heals. All healers must have HoTs ticking at all times during silence. Priests should have high Mp5 stacked and not require Innervates (however, non-resto druids should still innervate healers at low mana and/or when they call out for it) until the very end, if at all.\nDPS Needed.\nRaid-wise you will need an average of 6666.67 DPS to kill Gruul before he reaches 17 Grows (at which point the tank is risking getting killed in one hit), or an average of 266.67 DPS per raid member (assuming a full group of 25).\nAssuming your raid has 3 tanks doing about 150 DPS each and 5 healers doing 0 dps, the remaining 17 DPS classes in the raid will need to average about 365 DPS on Gruul.\n--Practical Suggestion\u2014Note: From practical experience, 17 grows is unrealistic unless you are lucky, or your tanks are overgeared. A group should try to DPS him down by grow 13. A typical group will go with 6 to 7 healers as well.\nCalculation: Gruul has 3.8 million hit points. End of grow 13 equates to 14 *30 seconds = 420 seconds. Assuming 6 healers, 3 tanks doing 150 DPS, and no deaths due to Ground Slam and Cave-in, the average raid DPS for the DPS group (16) is 8,598 DPS, or 537 dps per DPS player. A reasonable portion of the raid is spent moving and recovering from Ground slam so this is a minimum."}

He is a paladin of the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Order of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; and the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Westfall%20Brigade\"&gt;Westfall Brigade&lt;/a&gt;, formerly the People's Militia.\nAs a &lt;a href=\"Marshal%20%28rank%29\"&gt;marshal&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Stormwind\"&gt;Kingdom of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, he is the ruler and law enforcer of Westfall, leading the Brigade's efforts to restore the region to its former glory. He is notably the one who organized the resistance against the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;, putting an end to their actions and crimes by calling on &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;Alliance heroes&lt;/a&gt; to eliminate their leader &lt;a href=\"Edwin%20VanCleef\"&gt;Edwin VanCleef&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;Scourgewar&lt;/a&gt;, he led the Westfall Brigade as their &lt;a href=\"Captain%20%28rank%29\"&gt;captain&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Grizzly%20Hills\"&gt;Grizzly Hills&lt;/a&gt;, where they supported the Alliance advance in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. Following the fall of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, Gryan was promoted to Marshal with orders to secure and rebuild Westfall, with the full support of &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;. At the time of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, he faced the resurgence of the Defias Brotherhood led by &lt;a href=\"Vanessa%20VanCleef\"&gt;Vanessa VanCleef&lt;/a&gt;, and once again managed to drive them out of Westfall with the help of heroes of the Alliance.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, Gryan Stoutmantle joined the ranks of the reformer &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Order of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20Light\"&gt;Sanctum of Light&lt;/a&gt; and led the defense of Westfall during the &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Invasion\"&gt;demonic invasions&lt;/a&gt;. Following the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, he continued to ensure the reconstruction of &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20Hill\"&gt;Sentinel Hill&lt;/a&gt;, and work alongside the to protect the region and its inhabitants.\nBiography.\nGryan Stoutmantle was present when &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Prince Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Culling%20of%20Stratholme\"&gt;purged&lt;/a&gt; the city of &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;, killing almost all of its citizens to prevent them from becoming part of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. What role Gryan played in those events is unknown, but he manages to survive the purge and escape the undead.\nWhile he performed his duty on the battlefields of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, he learned that the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; had emerged in &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt; and left the battlefield to tend to the troubles back home in order to save and protect the honest farms which were overrun and made into hide-outs by thugs and murderers.\nGryan once did a significant favor for &lt;a href=\"Wiley%20the%20Black\"&gt;Wiley&lt;/a&gt;; in the latter's own words, the paladin saved his life.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nDue to the corruption of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Nobles\"&gt;House of Nobles&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Lady Katrana Prestor&lt;/a&gt;, Westfall did not get the military support it would have needed to defeat the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;. Considering that Stormwind had abandoned their cause, Stoutmantle founded and became the leader of the &lt;a href=\"People%27s%20Militia\"&gt;People's Militia&lt;/a&gt; in order to keep the land free from corruption. In his efforts to defend the people of &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt; from the Defias, he recruited the young heroes of the Alliance sent by some of his friends in the kingdom. As their goal was to return peace to Westfall, he sent &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to eliminate large numbers of Defias spotted by his scouts across the region.\nWhen Gryan received a plea from &lt;a href=\"Magistrate%20Solomon\"&gt;Magistrate Solomon&lt;/a&gt;, asking him to lend some support at &lt;a href=\"Lakeshire\"&gt;Lakeshire&lt;/a&gt; until the young &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; could send reserves to protect the &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, he had no choice but to refuse, realizing that the Magistrate knew nothing about the war raging in Westfall. In response, he sent back a letter where he apologized for not being able to help them, and that he needed to keep the Militia by his side, otherwise Westfall would fall.\nTo discover the position of the Defias headquarters and the identity of their leader, Stoutmantle sent an adventurer to meet &lt;a href=\"Wiley%20the%20Black\"&gt;Wiley the Black&lt;/a&gt; at the inn of Lakeshire. The rogue sent a letter to the paladin, explaining that he was risking his life by telling them that the Defias were up to something big, and that they were working in conjunction with various &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"kobold\"&gt;kobold&lt;/a&gt;s and even &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s. Gryan mentioned that he should have let him rot when he had the chance but was pleased with the crucial information. Learning that the Defias were certainly related to the Stonemasons, Gryan sent a letter to &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; of the for more information. Thanks to the Spymaster, he learned that the leader of the Brotherhood was &lt;a href=\"Edwin%20VanCleef\"&gt;Edwin VanCleef&lt;/a&gt; himself, once the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Stonemasons%27%20Guild\"&gt;Stonemasons' Guild&lt;/a&gt; and the man responsible for rebuilding &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s razed it during the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;. To make sure it was him, the paladin sent an adventurer to intercept a messenger who confirmed the identity of the Kingpin.\nWhile the adventurer intercepted the messenger, Gryan and the People's Militia captured a thief trying to steal &lt;a href=\"Farmer%20Saldean\"&gt;Saldean&lt;/a&gt;'s wagon. They forced the thief, who became known as &lt;a href=\"the%20Defias%20Traitor\"&gt;the Defias Traitor&lt;/a&gt;, to show them the location of the Defias secret hideout. Thanks to this, Stoutmantle found out that the leaders of the Defias Brotherhood were hiding in the &lt;a href=\"Deadmines\"&gt;Deadmines&lt;/a&gt;, hidden in the town of &lt;a href=\"Moonbrook\"&gt;Moonbrook&lt;/a&gt;. Once again, he called upon the heroes of the Alliance and sent them in the Deadmines on a mission to kill Edwin VanCleef. With support from Stoutmantle's soldiers, the heroes succeeded and Westfall was safe once again.\nAt some point after these events, Gryan traveled to &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt; and saw the grave of &lt;a href=\"Arugal\"&gt;Arugal&lt;/a&gt;.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nWith &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt; safe once more since the death of Edwin VanCleef, the &lt;a href=\"People%27s%20Militia\"&gt;People's Militia&lt;/a&gt; was renamed the &lt;a href=\"Westfall%20Brigade\"&gt;Westfall Brigade&lt;/a&gt; and was established as an official army of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;. Gryan Stoutmantle was promoted to Captain and Commander of the Westfall Brigade, he also had his own squire by the name of &lt;a href=\"Squire%20Walter\"&gt;Walter&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, the Westfall Brigade was sent to the east of the &lt;a href=\"Grizzly%20Hills\"&gt;Grizzly Hills&lt;/a&gt; to look for a path into the northern territories of the &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. Their secondary objective was to secure strategic resource points for the Alliance. At their head, Stoutmantle established the &lt;a href=\"Westfall%20Brigade%20Encampment\"&gt;Westfall Brigade Encampment&lt;/a&gt; as their headquarters in the region.\nAs he had left half of his soldiers in western Grizzly Hills, in order to fight the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; for the control of &lt;a href=\"Venture%20Bay\"&gt;Venture Bay&lt;/a&gt; and its vast amounts of lumber, Gryan could not send his men to check out the &lt;a href=\"Hollowstone%20Mine\"&gt;Hollowstone Mine&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, he sent an adventurer to help &lt;a href=\"Petrov\"&gt;Petrov&lt;/a&gt; to see if the operations could be salvaged, in order to use the additional resources until the mine of &lt;a href=\"Farshire\"&gt;Farshire&lt;/a&gt; was operational again. He was subsequently frustrated when he learned that the only functioning mine on their side of the hills was full of &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;, and expressed his doubts about the presence of &lt;a href=\"Arugal\"&gt;Arugal&lt;/a&gt; in the region, claiming that the latter had been dead for years.\nLater, Stoutmantle received orders to halt &lt;a href=\"Brugar%20Stoneshear\"&gt;Brugar Stoneshear&lt;/a&gt;'s and the &lt;a href=\"Explorer%27s%20League\"&gt;Explorer's League&lt;/a&gt;'s research of &lt;a href=\"Thor%20Modan\"&gt;Thor Modan&lt;/a&gt;, in order to make use of the tunnels for military purposes. The paladin understood that the dwarves would not be happy with this situation, but justified it by the fact that the network of tunnels beneath the ancient &lt;a href=\"iron%20dwarf\"&gt;iron dwarf&lt;/a&gt; city was the quickest way to move their forces to &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Glacier\"&gt;Icecrown Glacier&lt;/a&gt;. To avoid a conflict, he asked an adventurer to bring a cask of moonshine to calm the dwarves, which proved to be effective. When he had no more missions to give to the heroes of the Alliance, he ordered them to report to &lt;a href=\"Sergeant%20Riannah\"&gt;Sergeant Riannah&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Breach\"&gt;Light's Breach&lt;/a&gt;, as the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; concentrated its efforts in &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Drak\"&gt;Zul'Drak&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome time during Gryan's deployment in Northrend, he stayed in &lt;a href=\"Valgarde\"&gt;Valgarde&lt;/a&gt; and befriended &lt;a href=\"Thoralius%20the%20Wise\"&gt;Thoralius the Wise&lt;/a&gt;.\nA younger version of Gryan Stoutmantle could also be found in the unnamed inn of the &lt;a href=\"Road%20to%20Stratholme\"&gt;Road to Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"Culling%20of%20Stratholme%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Culling of Stratholme&lt;/a&gt; instance of the &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nFollowing the fall of &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, Gryan was promoted to Marshal with orders to secure and rebuild Westfall. When he returned from the &lt;a href=\"Grizzly%20Hills\"&gt;Grizzly Hills&lt;/a&gt;, he only found the land in worse condition than when he left, and that the war left thousands of homeless citizens who have since migrated to the deserted farmhouses and towns of the region. He turned &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20Hill\"&gt;Sentinel Hill&lt;/a&gt; into a stronghold, while &lt;a href=\"King%20Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; sent supplies, troops, and siege engines in hopes of rebuilding the former breadbasket of the kingdom and to house the citizens of Stormwind whose homes were destroyed during the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe later asked &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to help his men fend off the &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Riverpaw%20pack\"&gt;Riverpaw pack&lt;/a&gt; who kept attacking their positions, and to find their leader. After reading the gnolls' attack orders, he learned of the existence of &lt;a href=\"Helix%20Gearbreaker\"&gt;Helix Gearbreaker&lt;/a&gt; and an unknown admiral. He tried to interrogate an imprisoned &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Admiral%20Ripsnarl\"&gt;Ripsnarl&lt;/a&gt; about it, however, the latter only announced the end for them, which Stoutmantle did not take seriously.\nAfter receiving a letter from &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; who explained that the has been tracking Helix Gearbreaker since he entered Alliance territory two weeks ago, and that he sent &lt;a href=\"Agent%20Kearnen\"&gt;Agent Kearnen&lt;/a&gt; to Westfall, Stoutmantle sent an adventurer to inform her that the goblin is responsible for the gnoll attacks. He later received a report of what happened in &lt;a href=\"Mortwake%27s%20Tower\"&gt;Mortwake's Tower&lt;/a&gt;, about the discussion between Helix and the Shadowy Figure, and that the latter would make a final speech before the dawning in &lt;a href=\"Moonbrook\"&gt;Moonbrook&lt;/a&gt;. Consequently, the paladin sent an adventurer to meet &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Alpert\"&gt;Captain Alpert&lt;/a&gt;, one of his best men guarding the city with a company of Sentinel Hill troopers, in order to learn more about what's going on in Moonbrook. He also advised them to talk with &lt;a href=\"Thoralius%20the%20Wise\"&gt;Thoralius&lt;/a&gt;, a wise and powerful &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; that he met in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;.\nThrough a report, Gryan learned of the revolution among the refugees in the region against the kingdom and the Alliance, but above all, that Edwin VanCleef had a daughter who witnessed the death of her father at the hands of the adventurers he had sent a few years ago. Still reeling from these revelations, Stoutmantle lamented this tragedy, before realizing that something was wrong. At the same time, Sentinel Hill was attacked, and like the rest of the forces of Stormwind present, Gryan was incapacitated. He then discovered that Hope Saldean was behind the attack, and that she was &lt;a href=\"Vanessa%20VanCleef\"&gt;Vanessa VanCleef&lt;/a&gt;, daughter of Edwin VanCleef and the current Kingpin of the Defias Brotherhood. After freeing Ripsnarl who was the mysterious admiral, Vanessa and her minions forced Gryan to watch as they burned Sentinel Hill to the ground before they left.\nOnce free, Stoutmantle ordered the adventurer to make an emergency report of the situation to Stormwind, while the Westfall Brigade was busy putting out the fires and eliminating the Defias still present. Once the situation under control, the paladin received a report from &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Admiral%20Jes-Tereth\"&gt;Grand Admiral Jes-Tereth&lt;/a&gt; who informed him that she had sent troops from the capital to help them against the Defias Brotherhood. He later explained that even if the Defias posed a great threat, they certainly couldn't just enter their hideout, and asked the adventurers to give him time to prepare their assault, before sending them to help &lt;a href=\"Magistrate%20Solomon\"&gt;Magistrate Solomon&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Lakeshire\"&gt;Lakeshire&lt;/a&gt;.\nLater, the Alliance heroes and Stormwind forces entered the &lt;a href=\"Deadmines\"&gt;Deadmines&lt;/a&gt;, where they wiped out all of the Defias and managed to \"kill\" Vanessa VanCleef, ending her plans and the activities of the Brotherhood in Westfall.\nLegion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, Gryan Stoutmantle led the defense of Westfall during the &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Invasion\"&gt;demonic invasions&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the death of &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, Gryan traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20Light\"&gt;Sanctum of Light&lt;/a&gt; and joined the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Order of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; to serve its new &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Highlord&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the victory of the Silver Hand against &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Netherlight%20Temple\"&gt;Netherlight Temple&lt;/a&gt;, Stoutmantle represented the order when he met &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Krasus%27%20Landing\"&gt;Krasus' Landing&lt;/a&gt; in Dalaran to discuss the &lt;a href=\"Pillars%20of%20Creation\"&gt;Pillars of Creation&lt;/a&gt;, and during the formation of the &lt;a href=\"Armies%20of%20Legionfall\"&gt;Armies of Legionfall&lt;/a&gt; with the other class orders.\nExploring Azeroth.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, according to &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt;, Gryan Stoutmantle is present at &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20Hill\"&gt;Sentinel Hill&lt;/a&gt; where he is responsible for ensuring the reconstruction and fortification of the stronghold following the severity of the attacks of the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; in the past. He also makes sure that the &lt;a href=\"Westfall%20Brigade\"&gt;Westfall Brigade&lt;/a&gt; works with the in order to deal with the troublemakers in the region and keep at bay the &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Riverpaw%20pack\"&gt;Riverpaw pack&lt;/a&gt;, who became less well-organized after &lt;a href=\"Hogger\"&gt;Hogger&lt;/a&gt;'s death.\nQuotes.\nLegion Invasions.\n\"Start of the first battle:\"\n\"During the battle:\"\n\"The Demon Commander appears:\"\n\"Start of the third battle:\"\n\"During the battle:\"\n\"Start of the final battle:\"\n\"Victory and end of the invasion:\"\nGrizzly Hills.\nStoutmantle's gossip text changes depending on how much questing you did in the pre-\"\" version of Westfall.\n\"If the player didn't do any quests in Westfall:\"\n\"If the player didn't complete &lt;a href=\"The%20Defias%20Brotherhood%20%287%29\"&gt;The Defias Brotherhood (7)&lt;/a&gt;:\"\n\"If the player killed VanCleef and delivered his head to Stoutmantle:\"\n\"In subsequent meetings:\""}

Native to the &lt;a href=\"Aerie%20Peak\"&gt;Aerie Peak&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt;, they have long shared an inseparable bond with the &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammer clan&lt;/a&gt;, who later introduced them to the rest of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Gryphon%20rider\"&gt;Gryphon rider&lt;/a&gt;s are mostly dwarves of the Wildhammer clan, but more recently Ironforge dwarves and humans alike have started deploying gryphon riders of their own. Trained gryphons can be called through a special whistle. &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;'s own whistle was a thin golden cylinder carved with &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20%28language%29\"&gt;dwarven&lt;/a&gt; runes.\nDomesticated gryphons are bred and raised at special &lt;a href=\"Gryphon%20aviary\"&gt;aviaries&lt;/a&gt;, but wild gryphons are also numerous.\nBackground.\nGryphons are majestic creatures of the skies, and are, much like &lt;a href=\"hippogryph\"&gt;hippogryph&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"wyvern\"&gt;wyvern&lt;/a&gt;s, more than just beasts; they're both intelligent and cunning. They share a common ancestry with wyverns, and were first befriended by the &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; when the Wildhammers settled in the &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt; in the years following the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;War of the Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt;, roughly 230 years before the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;. The creatures became emblematic of the clan and an inseparable part of their culture.\nEver since, the Wildhammers have revered the gryphon as a sacred animal. While some say that the dwarves keep them, it's more of a friendship, and to befriend the Wildhammers one must first befriend their gryphons. During the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gryphon%20Rider%20%28Warcraft%20II%29\"&gt;gryphon riders&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Northeron\"&gt;Northeron&lt;/a&gt; came to the aid of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; to fight back against the marauding &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, and during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; the wild dwarves responded to the call once more by bringing their proud, implacable beasts \u2014 noble symbols of the Alliance's fortitude \u2014 to keep the skies of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; free from enemy forces.\nThe dwarves have since introduced their noble steeds to the rest of the Alliance, with some hatchlings even being descendants from the same gryphons ridden by &lt;a href=\"Falstad%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Falstad Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt; and his entourage into &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt; after the Second War.\nGryphons' keen eyesight allows them to see over vast distances and warn their riders of any dangers that lie ahead. The breed known as the &lt;a href=\"Armored%20Snowy%20Gryphon\"&gt;armored snowy gryphon&lt;/a&gt; has proven capable of weathering the harsh winds of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, and according to &lt;a href=\"Mei%20Francis\"&gt;Mei Francis&lt;/a&gt;, when they attack, blood almost never stains their feathers.\nThe gryphons of &lt;a href=\"Aerie%20Peak\"&gt;Aerie Peak&lt;/a&gt; are trained by the Wildhammers to kill &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;forest troll&lt;/a&gt;s, their ancient enemy. The dwarves also train young gryphons by sending them out to hunt &lt;a href=\"rattlesnake\"&gt;rattlesnake&lt;/a&gt;s in the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Highlands\"&gt;Twilight Highlands&lt;/a&gt;. According to &lt;a href=\"Huntsman%20Markhor\"&gt;Huntsman Markhor&lt;/a&gt;, the elder gryphons known as &lt;a href=\"Razorbeak%20Skylord\"&gt;razorbeak skylords&lt;/a&gt; are a much rarer breed than the rest of their kin, and are responsible for mating and \"creating murderous offspring\".\nThe gryphons of the Northrend peaks are the most resilient of the species.\nAccording to the &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; gryphon master &lt;a href=\"Gryth%20Thurden\"&gt;Gryth Thurden&lt;/a&gt;, the steeds of the Wildhammer dwarves may be fast, but they cannot stand the heat of Ironforge's &lt;a href=\"Great%20Forge\"&gt;Great Forge&lt;/a&gt;, unlike Ironforge's own gryphons.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Mangy%20Silvermane\"&gt;mangy silvermane&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"wolf\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt; of the Hinterlands prowl the woods where Aerie Peak's gryphons range and have been known to kill gryphons that stray too low. The &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s of the Twilight Highlands use gryphon carcasses as bait when wrangling &lt;a href=\"black%20drake\"&gt;black drake&lt;/a&gt;s, but only carcasses from wild animals; drakes hate the stink of dwarf on their food.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Roughnecks\"&gt;Roughnecks&lt;/a&gt; provide all gryphon mounts for &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;. They are led by &lt;a href=\"Boss%20Tak\"&gt;Boss Tak&lt;/a&gt;, a Wildhammer dwarf from the Twilight Highlands who taught them how to tame and ride gryphons instead of hunting them for meat and pelts.\nWhen finding abandoned gryphon eggs, a female gryphon might choose to adopt them.\nAs a mount.\n&lt;a href=\"Gryphon%20mounts\"&gt;Gryphon mounts&lt;/a&gt; are the flying mounts for Alliance players. They come in a variety of colors and are capable of running on all fours like a cat for land travel, rendering it useful as a ground mount.\nAs a hunter pet.\nGryphons are tamable by &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s as part of the &lt;a href=\"Feathermane\"&gt;Feathermane&lt;/a&gt; family, added in &lt;a href=\"patch%207.2.0\"&gt;patch 7.2.0&lt;/a&gt;. In order to tame Feathermanes, hunters must purchase the &lt;a href=\"Tome%20of%20the%20Hybrid%20Beast\"&gt;Tome of the Hybrid Beast&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Pan%20the%20Kind%20Hand\"&gt;Pan the Kind Hand&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Trueshot%20Lodge\"&gt;Trueshot Lodge&lt;/a&gt; at a cost of .\nFilm universe.\nGryphons seem to be fairly rare; at the time of the arrival of orcs in Azeroth, possessed only a handful, and these were seldom ridden except for official business.\nGryphons are able to understand humanoid speech, or at least a few words - a person can verbally command a gryphon to fly to a certain location and it will do so, without further instruction, or need of a rider. Gryphons often express affection to familiar riders, and respond to subtler instructions such as the position of their rider on their back. Command of a gryphon does not require great experience, at least as long as the gryphon knows its destination.\nIn the RPG.\nThe gryphon is the symbol of resolve and fortitude among the wild dwarves of &lt;a href=\"Aerie%20Peak\"&gt;Aerie Peak&lt;/a&gt;. From the tip of its powerful beak to the back of its swishing tail, a gryphon can reach lengths of 9 feet. Its wings can span up to 30 feet, and are powerful enough to launch the beast into flight from a standing position.\nGryphons are intelligent and loyal, suppressing their natural aggression and territorial behavior to assist the wild dwarves who share their mountain homes. They are, however, partial to &lt;a href=\"horse\"&gt;horse&lt;/a&gt; flesh and unless closely watched indulge their taste to the detriment of nearby cavalry. In recent times, the &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Witherbark%20tribe\"&gt;Witherbark tribe&lt;/a&gt; in the southern &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt; have been capturing gryphons to attempt to train their own &lt;a href=\"windwarrior\"&gt;windwarrior&lt;/a&gt;s. They have thus far been unsuccessful, but it is conceivable that the trolls will eventually find a way to duplicate the success of the &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammer clan&lt;/a&gt; and produce &lt;a href=\"gryphon%20rider\"&gt;gryphon rider&lt;/a&gt;s of their own. In combat, a gryphon attempts to swoop down on its prey, attacking from above. Gryphons are intelligent enough to avoid fighting in situations in which they cannot make their attack at an advantage. The sale of gryphon eggs is considered a crime in most human and dwarf holdings, but black market eggs can be had for prices at around 2 to 3 times less than the amount of a fully trained gryphon."}

On &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, they were a result of isolation from the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; due to being quarantined in &lt;a href=\"Garadar\"&gt;Garadar&lt;/a&gt;. They have a noble &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;istic tradition cultivating a mighty tribal society that was centered around survival, regulating themselves through ritualized combat and personal honor. On the , the orcs did not take up the &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; because of the intervention of &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, causing them to remain uncorrupted.\nHistory.\nOutland Mag'har.\nYears prior to the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Curse\"&gt;Blood Pact&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt;, a virulent plague known as the \"&lt;a href=\"red%20pox\"&gt;red pox&lt;/a&gt;\" spread among the orcish &lt;a href=\"clan\"&gt;clan&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Greatmother%20Geyah\"&gt;Geyah&lt;/a&gt; established a quarantine &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt;, naming it &lt;a href=\"Garadar\"&gt;Garadar&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href=\"Garad\"&gt;Garad&lt;/a&gt;. Those that were quarantined managed to avoid the corruption that plagued even their parents and the rest of the world. The orcs, and Nagrand, came to be referred to as \"Mag'har\" \u2014 which in &lt;a href=\"Orcish%20%28language%29\"&gt;Orcish&lt;/a&gt; means \"uncorrupted\".\nThe Burning Crusade.\nThe current leader of the Mag'har, the venerable &lt;a href=\"Greatmother%20Geyah\"&gt;Greatmother Geyah&lt;/a&gt;, is an old and wise orc, yet she recently fell extremely ill. &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, the son of &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grommash Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, served as the Mag'har's military chief, aided by &lt;a href=\"Jorin%20Deadeye\"&gt;Jorin Deadeye&lt;/a&gt;, son of the venerable chieftain of the &lt;a href=\"Bleeding%20Hollow%20clan\"&gt;Bleeding Hollow clan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kilrogg%20Deadeye\"&gt;Kilrogg Deadeye&lt;/a&gt;. Garrosh was to succeed Geyah as chieftain of the Mag'har should she pass. Warchief &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; of the New Horde met with the Mag'har and reconnected with the old traditions. The Mag'har joined the Horde, and taught the orcs about their past and the old ways.\nSeveral Mag'har orcs also traveled to &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt;, allying with &lt;a href=\"Lower%20City\"&gt;Lower City&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Laughing%20Skull%20Ruins\"&gt;Laughing Skull Ruins&lt;/a&gt; were once inhabited by the Mag'har before the location was taken by the &lt;a href=\"Warmaul\"&gt;Warmaul&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Mag'har outpost of &lt;a href=\"Sunspring%20Post\"&gt;Sunspring Post&lt;/a&gt; was sacked by the &lt;a href=\"Murkblood%20tribe\"&gt;Murkblood tribe&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Broken\"&gt;Broken&lt;/a&gt;. They killed roughly a thousand Mag'har orcs and dumped their bodies in the lake. &lt;a href=\"Otonbu%20the%20Sage\"&gt;Otonbu the Sage&lt;/a&gt; worried that catastrophe would set back any chance of peace between the Mag'har and the &lt;a href=\"Kurenai\"&gt;Kurenai&lt;/a&gt;, another tribe of Broken, for years. \nWrath of the Lich King.\nGarrosh was the first Mag'har to set foot in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;. A number of Mag'har joined the Horde's war effort, notably during the campaign against the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; and in the &lt;a href=\"Pandaren%20Campaign\"&gt;Pandaren Campaign&lt;/a&gt;. Mag'har orcs in the Horde became a more common sight once Garrosh became its Warchief. \nAmong the Mag'har who joined Garrosh on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;a href=\"Dranosh%20Saurfang\"&gt;Dranosh Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"High%20Warlord%20Cromush\"&gt;Cromush&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"General%20Grebo\"&gt;Grebo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"General%20Glubgok\"&gt;Glubgok&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lucretia\"&gt;Lucretia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Saurboz\"&gt;Saurboz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gash%27nul\"&gt;Gash'nul&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Rok%27nah\"&gt;Rok'nah&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dalgan\"&gt;Dalgan&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ishi\"&gt;Ishi&lt;/a&gt;.

A powerful shaman and cunning leader, Magatha was the chief rival to High Chieftain &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; for the leadership of all &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt;. When she found she could not remove Cairne politically, Magatha turned to treachery. After engineering Cairne's death and briefly taking control of &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt;, Magatha and her Grimtotem were defeated by an army raised by Cairne's son &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine&lt;/a&gt;, and Magatha was exiled (along with any who chose to remain with her) by the new High Chieftain.\nBiography.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nBlessed with shamanic powers when she was just a young girl, Magatha has sought power and prestige nearly all her life. She became the matriarch of the Grimtotem clan through an arranged marriage that many suspect she arranged herself, but subsequently lost her mate to an unforeseen climbing accident. Since her mate's death, Magatha has commanded the stern Grimtotem warriors. The Grimtotems believe that Magatha will lead them in eradicating the lesser races from &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; and retaking the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; ancestral holdings abroad. Magatha constantly sparred with Cairne Bloodhoof over the direction of the tauren future and feels that only she is fit to rule her people.\nFor reasons known only to herself, Magatha gave more aid to the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; than to other high-ranking tauren such as Cairne Bloodhoof or &lt;a href=\"Hamuul%20Runetotem\"&gt;Hamuul Runetotem&lt;/a&gt;. This included arguing on their behalf when the idea of forming an alliance with them was first suggested. Ostensibly she's helped them and continues to work closely with them because she feels the tauren and their ways can help the Forsaken find a path back to being human. Skeptics believed her motives to be much less altruistic, skeptics which also did not trust the Forsaken.\nMagatha tried to negotiate with the &lt;a href=\"trogg\"&gt;trogg&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Ragefire%20Chasm\"&gt;Ragefire Chasm&lt;/a&gt;, but was met with hostility. She also sent &lt;a href=\"Ravak%20Grimtotem\"&gt;Ravak Grimtotem&lt;/a&gt; to observe other races, especially the gnomes.\nIt was implied in the quest &lt;a href=\"Arikara%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Arikara (quest)&lt;/a&gt; that the serpent of vengeance sought revenge on the tauren people and she claimed it was after Cairne Bloodhoof and tasked adventurers with destroying it.\nWorld of Warcraft: The Comic.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Rehgar%20Earthfury\"&gt;Rehgar Earthfury&lt;/a&gt; and his gladiatorial slaves, &lt;a href=\"Broll%20Bearmantle\"&gt;Broll Bearmantle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Lo'Gosh&lt;/a&gt;, arrived to &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt;, Rehgar was approached by Magatha, who said she knew several young tauren who would be strong candidates for his battle training - including her granddaughter and several grandnephews. While Rehgar considered this proposal, Broll and Lo'Gosh went to bathe in the &lt;a href=\"Pools%20of%20Vision\"&gt;Pools of Vision&lt;/a&gt;. They were attacked by a large &lt;a href=\"Earth%20elemental\"&gt;cave elemental&lt;/a&gt; Magatha had summoned, but Lo'Gosh defeated it and the pools helped him recall some of his lost memories. In an attempt to discredit Cairne (who had been hesitant to disturb the elemental without understanding what it wanted), Magatha cheered on \"Rehgar's champions\" for accomplishing \"what the great Cairne could not\".\nSome time later, Rehgar's gladiators escaped. Some Forsaken informed her that a human assassin will be arriving soon and he arrived right after the departure of the two. She told him to meet her later. For 100 gold, she showed the assassin through a vision of Lo'Gosh location, the Warsong Gulch, and how he there won a battle with the night elves.\nLegends - Miles to Go.\nMagatha sent a young &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Kova%20Broadhorn\"&gt;Kova Broadhorn&lt;/a&gt; to find a reclusive &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"seer\"&gt;seer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dhambeela\"&gt;Dhambeela&lt;/a&gt; who is a personal friend and ally of Magatha. Kova succeeded and Magatha reunited with Dhambeela during the &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Faire\"&gt;Darkmoon Faire&lt;/a&gt; at the base of Thunder Bluff. It seems that Dhambeela knew about Magatha's plan of removing &lt;a href=\"Cairne\"&gt;Cairne&lt;/a&gt;. Magatha then spoke to Kova who thanked her for realizing that there is nothing wrong with accepting a help.\nExile.\nMagatha, who became a matriarch of her tribe after her husband's accidental death, was present during a ceremony for Garrosh and his veterans from War against the Lich King.\nSeeing &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; as a potential means of disposing of Cairne, Magatha offers her support and that of the Grimtotem tribe to the new Warchief. When Cairne, displeased with Garrosh's leadership, challenges him to \"mak'gora\", Magatha offers to be the shaman who blesses Garrosh's weapon, thus showing her opposition to Cairne openly. But rather than the ritual oils, Magatha applies poison to the blade of &lt;a href=\"Gorehowl\"&gt;Gorehowl&lt;/a&gt;, merely applying drops of it to the axe head (not using her fingers to spread it around the blade, as was customary - a fact that Garrosh, largely ignorant of the dictates of \"mak'gora\", did not notice). A glancing blow to Cairne paralyzes him, allowing Garrosh to kill him.\nCairne's body was not even cold before Magatha ordered her tribe to attack Thunder Bluff and other tauren towns, and kill everyone in them - including Cairne's son and heir, &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine&lt;/a&gt;. However, a Grimtotem shaman, known as &lt;a href=\"Jevan%20Grimtotem\"&gt;Stormsong&lt;/a&gt;, warned Baine of his father's death and of the plan to assassinate him and aided him in rallying a force to take down Magatha and the Grimtotems. Magatha sent a request for assistance to Garrosh in Orgrimmar, believing that he would aid her as she had \"aided\" him; having discovered what had happened, Garrosh sent an insult-laden reply, condemning her treachery and refusing to aid her. The Grimtotem stood alone when Baine led his assault on Thunder Bluff, forcing Magatha to yield.\nCrushing Magatha's totems, a grievous insult to the elements that she would have to atone for, Baine banished Magatha from the tauren lands on pain of death, and allowed those who would not follow her to remain in Thunder Bluff if they swore allegiance to him, under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Jevan%20Grimtotem\"&gt;Jevan Grimtotem&lt;/a&gt;, as their chieftain. Magatha and her loyalists, about three-quarters of the original tribe, were then taken to their place of exile in the &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, Magatha's exile has not ended too well for the Elder Crone and her followers \u2014 &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; forces in the Stonetalon region have destroyed the &lt;a href=\"Camp%20Aparaje\"&gt;Grimtotem's main camp&lt;/a&gt;, and the surviving Grimtotem have been forced to enter into an uneasy (and temporary) truce with the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter making her way to the Grimtotem stronghold of &lt;a href=\"Darkcloud%20Pinnacle\"&gt;Darkcloud Pinnacle&lt;/a&gt;, Magatha disappeared. She was a prize to the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;, who took Magatha prisoner alongside many others in the region. Speaking through &lt;a href=\"Arikara\"&gt;Arikara&lt;/a&gt;, she's able to rid her clan of incompetent leaders and gain powerful artifacts with the help of adventurers. However, the Twilight Cultists may have miscalculated in taking her prisoner, as she seems to have gained a great deal of understanding of their operations in Thousand Needles and even manages to manipulate others into not only opposing the Hammer, but in giving her access to several powerful artifacts in the process, including the &lt;a href=\"Doomstone\"&gt;Doomstone&lt;/a&gt;, a magical device capable of absorbing and amplifying elemental power. While the Twilights intended to use the Elemental &lt;a href=\"Animus\"&gt;Animus&lt;/a&gt; powered by the Doomstone to destroy all of Thousand Needles, it is as yet unknown what Magatha intends to do with the device, but she promised the next time she meets the adventurers, it would be their last encounter.\nLegionfall.\nAfter the Legion invaded the &lt;a href=\"Darkcloud%20Pinnacle\"&gt;Darkcloud Pinnacle&lt;/a&gt; and claimed both Arikara and the Doomstone, Magatha was forced to concede that she would need help. To that end she journeyed to the Maelstrom in order to get help from the &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt; but, distrustful of her, the Earthen Ring barred her way in until the Farseer could decide her fate. In a conversation with the Farseer she claims to be the leader that the tauren need, refusing to sit idly by like &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; and the other tauren at Thunder Bluff \"waiting for the Alliance and Legion to effortlessly roll over them.\" Unwilling to allow the Doomstone to remain in Legion's hands the Farseer and Magatha depart to Thousand Needles, where they liberate her Grimtotem followers, rescue Arikara, and secure the Doomstone.\nRejecting to give the Doomstone back to Magatha, the Farseer returns to the Maelstrom with Magatha in tow, her unwilling to leave the Doomstone out of sight. Upon entering &lt;a href=\"Muln%20Earthfury\"&gt;Muln Earthfury&lt;/a&gt; pleads with the Farseer to kick her out for her role in Cairne's death, however &lt;a href=\"Nobundo\"&gt;Nobundo&lt;/a&gt; convinced him that it would be better for Magatha to be with them, where she could be watched rather than out in the world and out of sight. When the Farseer departed to aid &lt;a href=\"Therazane\"&gt;Therazane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Smolderon\"&gt;Smolderon&lt;/a&gt;, and members of the Earthen Ring on the Broken Shore Magatha accompanied them still, unwilling to leave the Doomstone out of sight. After using the power of the Doomstone, the Farseer was knocked out and Magatha, was among the many shaman to return to the Maelstrom.\nUpon awakening, the Farseer discovered that the Elemental Lords felt that the power of the Doomstone was too great to be used by mortal hands and yet felt that bringing into their own domain would upset the balance between the four realms. As such it was decided that the Doomstone would be safeguarded in the Maelstrom, a decision that Magatha rejected on the grounds of the power contained within the Doomstone. She then joined with the Farseer and became a champion of the &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt; and claimed that she and her Grimtotem will keep an eye on the Doomstone. \nBattle for Azeroth.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, Azeroth would suffer a grievous wound at the Maelstrom, causing &lt;a href=\"Azerite%20elemental\"&gt;Azerite elemental&lt;/a&gt;s to come forth in order to claim the newly formed &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt;. Oddly enough, despite her pledge to keep watch over the Doomstone, Magatha was nowhere to be found, and it was &lt;a href=\"Nobundo\"&gt;Nobundo&lt;/a&gt; who secured the Doomstone.\nQuests.\nCataclysm.\nMagatha Grimtotem is a level 113 (previously 88, 93 and 103) NPC in the Thousand Needles, where she offers the following quests:\nFinding her is also the objective of &lt;a href=\"The%20Elder%20Crone%20%28Thousand%20Needles%29\"&gt;The Elder Crone (Thousand Needles)&lt;/a&gt;.\nBefore the Cataclysm.\nOriginally, Magatha was a level 62 &lt;a href=\"quest%20giver\"&gt;quest giver&lt;/a&gt; located on &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Rise\"&gt;Elder Rise&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; city of &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt;. She was attended by her guards, &lt;a href=\"Cor%20Grimtotem\"&gt;Cor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gorm%20Grimtotem\"&gt;Gorm Grimtotem&lt;/a&gt;, and by her servant, &lt;a href=\"Rahauro\"&gt;Rahauro&lt;/a&gt;. She offered the following quests:\nIn the RPG.\nMagatha\u2019s the oldest living Grimtotem and the most powerful shaman of the tribe. She is an elderly tauren female with powerful shoulders and a white muzzle. She has not let age slow her down one bit, and she defends her position with every spark of magic at her command. She is forging ties with the Forsaken, and thinks they are the type to understand an unwavering hatred against all other races. It is rumored that she is planning on killing Bloodhoof, though she is not nearly strong enough to do so at this point.\nQuotes.\nCataclysm.\nPerhaps you did not hear me. I said, get me free of these chains!\nLegion.\nI am Magatha Grimtotem, of the Grimtotem tribe. I am the Elder Crone, the matriarch of my tribe.\nThough Baine may have exiled me from Thunder Bluff, I am the leader that the tauren need. They sit idly by in their tents, waiting for the Alliance and the Legion to effortlessly roll over them. My people and I refuse to let that happen to us. We do what we must to survive.\nThe Legion has attacked. The Grimtotem need me. Will you help, or will you get in the way?\nSpeculation.\nIt is speculated that she was the person named &lt;a href=\"Agasham\"&gt;Agasham&lt;/a&gt; due to its anagram, Magasha, being similar to her name.\nIt's probable that she initially intended to use &lt;a href=\"Arikara\"&gt;Arikara&lt;/a&gt; against Cairne Bloodhoof. When the Thousand Needles tauren discovered its whereabouts she had no other option than to play along and have it killed."}

Mages are well known for their formidable damage output, as well as their range of &lt;a href=\"crowd%20control\"&gt;crowd control&lt;/a&gt; abilities. Mages are also capable of performing a number of utility roles, from &lt;a href=\"Conjure%20Refreshment\"&gt;conjuring refreshments&lt;/a&gt; for their allies to &lt;a href=\"teleport\"&gt;teleport&lt;/a&gt;ing or opening &lt;a href=\"Portal\"&gt;Portal&lt;/a&gt;s to major cities.\nTheir greatest power has always been their creativity at finding new and explosive ways to use their &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;.\nMages wear only &lt;a href=\"cloth%20armor\"&gt;cloth armor&lt;/a&gt;, but compensate for this with a range of armor spells, wreathing themselves in &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Armor\"&gt;flame&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Armor\"&gt;frost&lt;/a&gt; or even &lt;a href=\"Mage%20Armor\"&gt;arcane energies&lt;/a&gt;. Nonetheless, when fighting melee opponents, mages stay alive by incapacitating attackers and always keeping one step ahead - and well out of reach. Mages are quick and can &lt;a href=\"Blink\"&gt;Blink&lt;/a&gt; away from attackers, deploy a &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Nova\"&gt;Frost Nova&lt;/a&gt; to freeze whole groups in their tracks or even use &lt;a href=\"Invisibility\"&gt;Invisibility&lt;/a&gt; to slip into the shadows. Mages are masters of &lt;a href=\"kiting\"&gt;kiting&lt;/a&gt;, and can use their enviable range of &lt;a href=\"snare\"&gt;snare&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"crowd%20control\"&gt;crowd control&lt;/a&gt; abilities to defeat whole groups of opponents without putting a hair out of place.\nMages' primary role in groups at lower levels is damage dealing and &lt;a href=\"crowd%20control\"&gt;crowd control&lt;/a&gt; through the use of &lt;a href=\"Polymorph\"&gt;Polymorph&lt;/a&gt;, temporarily changing &lt;a href=\"humanoid\"&gt;humanoid&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"beast\"&gt;beast&lt;/a&gt;s into harmless critters. At end-game levels, mages' impressive damage output is supplemented with useful abilities such as &lt;a href=\"Counterspell\"&gt;Counterspell&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Spellsteal\"&gt;Spellsteal&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt;, mages deal ranged damage while using snares, stuns and &lt;a href=\"Polymorph\"&gt;Polymorph&lt;/a&gt; to control enemy players. Mages are the archetypal \"glass cannons\", capable of dealing an immense amount of damage if left uninterrupted, but vulnerable to attack. Mages compensate for this with a range of &lt;a href=\"snare\"&gt;snare&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"stun\"&gt;stun&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"incapacitation\"&gt;incapacitation&lt;/a&gt; effects, and must keep on their toes if they are to survive.\nMages can be an extremely fun class to play, with enviable damage output, strong crowd control and some interesting utility spells. Whether blasting foes with &lt;a href=\"Dragon%27s%20Breath\"&gt;Dragon's Breath&lt;/a&gt; or freezing attackers in a &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Frost\"&gt;Ring of Frost&lt;/a&gt;, mages are a powerful presence on the battlefield. Masters of the arcane, mages can use their mental powers to alter the very fabric of reality, turning snarling attackers into harmless sheep or even &lt;a href=\"Alter%20Time\"&gt;altering time&lt;/a&gt; itself. Quick of mind and fleet of foot, mages stay one step ahead of their enemies, summoning frost and ice to entrap their assailants, and great fireballs and walls of flame to decimate their foes. Undisputed masters of the very fabric of reality, only the foolish do not fear the coming of a mage.\nIn , the mage class will be available to all &lt;a href=\"playable%20race\"&gt;playable race&lt;/a&gt;s besides &lt;a href=\"Dracthyr%20%28playable%29\"&gt;dracthyr&lt;/a&gt;. This means that mages will be newly available to &lt;a href=\"Tauren%20%28playable%29\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20tauren%20%28playable%29\"&gt;Highmountain tauren&lt;/a&gt;.\nClass overview.\n\"Students gifted with a keen intellect and unwavering discipline may walk the path of the mage. The arcane magic available to magi is both great and dangerous, and thus is revealed only to the most devoted practitioners. To avoid interference with their spellcasting, magi wear only cloth armor, but arcane shields and enchantments give them additional protection. To keep enemies at bay, magi can summon bursts of fire to incinerate distant targets and cause entire areas to erupt, setting groups of foes ablaze. Masters of ice can command blizzards that tear into flesh and limit movement. Should enemies manage to survive this assault, the mage can shrink them into harmless sheep in the blink of an eye.\"\n\"Powerful magi can even generate enhancements and portals, assisting allies by sharpening their minds and transporting them instantly across the world.\"\nCreation screen description.\n\"Magi are wizards of immense knowledge and skill. Their obvious physical frailty is deceptive, for they can call upon the cosmic energies of the Twisting Nether. Rarely do magi engage in melee combat. Instead, they prefer to attack from a distance, hurling powerful bolts of frost and flame at their unsuspecting enemies.\"\nClassic guide.\n\"Mages are spellcasting savants, flinging fire, frost, and arcane sorcery at their foes from afar.\"\nBackground.\nEarly &lt;a href=\"kaldorei\"&gt;kaldorei&lt;/a&gt; civilization was defined by direct manipulation of magic drawn from the Well of Eternity to create and sustain their society. Their constant use of the Well attracted attention from &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, who manipulated the &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; Queen Azshara into using the Well as a gateway, granting the Legion entry into Azeroth. The Legion's arrival sparked a massive conflict which would later be known as the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;. The war had grave consequences, for even though the combined might of Azeroth's mortal races were victorious, the continent of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; was shattered, and a swirling, raging miasma of sea storms flowed into the vacant area where the Well of Eternity used to reside. This &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt; caused the Well's energies to permeate the atmosphere and spread magic all over the world.\nThis event convinced the majority of night elves to reject arcane magic and embrace &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;'s call for &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;ism. Many of the surviving Highborne could not endure this lifestyle, suffering as they were from withdrawal now that they could no longer draw on the Well's arcane energies. Their leader, &lt;a href=\"Dath%27Remar%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Dath'Remar Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;, called the druids cowards for refusing to use the magic he considered their birthright. In spite of Malfurion's warning that any use of magic would be punishable by death, Dath'Remar led his fellow Highborne in revolt, conjuring a giant magical storm in Ashenvale in an attempt to convince the druids to suspend the law. Unwilling to execute so many of their fellow elves, Malfurion and the druids instead exiled the Highborne from their lands. Dath'Remar and his followers chose to set sail from Kalimdor, eventually landing in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; where they would ultimately found the kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; and call themselves &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt;. When their kingdom came under siege by the trolls of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt;, the high elves agreed to teach &lt;a href=\"One%20Hundred\"&gt;one hundred humans&lt;/a&gt; the arts of magic in exchange for military aid from the human nation of &lt;a href=\"Arathor\"&gt;Arathor&lt;/a&gt;. From these two races, the arcane arts have spread to various races all over Azeroth.\nIn Warcraft II.\nMages first appeared as a unit of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; in \"\". They were described as such:\n\"Once students of the &lt;a href=\"Conjurer\"&gt;Conjurer&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, this new order of Mages have been forced to discover untapped magical forces to command in their war against the ruthless &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;s. Although masters of their arts, the Conjurers who fell during the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt; were unprepared for the rigors of warfare. Determined to avoid a similar fate, the Mages have undertaken a regimen equally demanding on body and soul, thus dedicating themselves to the command of more aggressive and destructive &lt;a href=\"Magic\"&gt;magiks&lt;/a&gt;. Whether in their sanctum at the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Citadel\"&gt;Violet Citadel&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; or on the many battlefields of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, the Mages are resolute in their efforts to defend the people.\"\nPut together, the pre-\"Warcraft III\" games and novels painted a fairly specific picture of the place of mages in human society. \"Warcraft I\" showed that &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; had its own secretive conjurer order and that the kingdom had a special relationship with them, even promoting them to advisors of the &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Stormwind\"&gt;court&lt;/a&gt;. \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Last%20Guardian\"&gt;The Last Guardian&lt;/a&gt;\" confirmed that this southern mage group was officially separated from Dalaran to the point of being referred to as &lt;a href=\"Hedge%20wizard\"&gt;\"hedge wizards\"&lt;/a&gt;, though some of them still belonged to the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Council of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt;. Speaking of Dalaran, the \"Warcraft II\" manual hinted that most Lordaeron mages ultimately answered to the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Citadel\"&gt;Violet Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, with \"&lt;a href=\"Day%20of%20the%20Dragon\"&gt;Day of the Dragon&lt;/a&gt;\" showing that the different monarchies of Lordaeron seemed to be wary of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"wizard\"&gt;wizard&lt;/a&gt;s and their politics, and to have no mage advisors of their own, as none were there to protect the various kings during the events of the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20crisis\"&gt;Alterac crisis&lt;/a&gt;. How much of this remains canonical is unclear.\nOf note is that in the aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Alteraci&lt;/a&gt; mage stole the &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Medivh\"&gt;Book of Medivh&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; and exchanged it to &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; for military aid against &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt; forces, showing that some mages were eventually more loyal to their nation than to the Violet Citadel.\nRaces.\nThe mage class can be played by the following races:\nMage beneficial racial abilities:\nOverview.\nThe mage is a pure DPS class, with all mage &lt;a href=\"specialization\"&gt;specialization&lt;/a&gt;s focusing on dealing damage, and as such is capable of enviable damage output, whether launching an &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Lance\"&gt;Ice Lance&lt;/a&gt; against a &lt;a href=\"Shatter\"&gt;frozen&lt;/a&gt; target or invoking a &lt;a href=\"Blizzard\"&gt;Blizzard&lt;/a&gt; to decimate whole groups of opponents. However, mages also have an extremely diverse selection of &lt;a href=\"crowd%20control\"&gt;crowd control&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"utility\"&gt;utility&lt;/a&gt; abilities, making them far more than just damage-dealers. From &lt;a href=\"Spellsteal\"&gt;Spellsteal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Slow%20Fall%20%28ability%29\"&gt;Slow Fall (ability)&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Block\"&gt;Ice Block&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20Image\"&gt;Mirror Image&lt;/a&gt;, mages have some fun and interesting spells at their disposal.\nSpells.\nMages have a wide variety of spells which fall into three schools of magic: &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"frost\"&gt;frost&lt;/a&gt;. All spell schools include damage spells. Arcane includes some crowd control and utility, and most Frost spells provide a movement-slow effect supplementing their damage.\nMages' in-combat mana regeneration is provided by abilities such as &lt;a href=\"Nether%20Attunement\"&gt;Nether Attunement&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Evocation\"&gt;Evocation&lt;/a&gt; and the use of low-mana casting cycles (such as &lt;a href=\"Scorch\"&gt;Scorch&lt;/a&gt; for fire mages or heavy use of &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Missiles\"&gt;Arcane Missiles&lt;/a&gt; for arcane mages).\nGear.\nA mage can only wear &lt;a href=\"cloth%20armor\"&gt;cloth armor&lt;/a&gt;.\nA mage is able to wield &lt;a href=\"staff\"&gt;staves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"wand\"&gt;wand&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"dagger\"&gt;dagger&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"one-handed\"&gt;one-handed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt;s, and can use items with the slot \"&lt;a href=\"Held%20In%20Off-hand\"&gt;Held In Off-hand&lt;/a&gt;\" if using a dagger or one-handed sword in the &lt;a href=\"main%20hand\"&gt;main hand&lt;/a&gt;. Wands go in the main hand slot and will continue to shoot once manually started.\nAttributes.\nAs a spell-caster, a mage's primary stat is &lt;a href=\"intellect\"&gt;intellect&lt;/a&gt;, which directly increases the mage's &lt;a href=\"spell%20power\"&gt;spell power&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"spell%20critical%20strike\"&gt;spell critical strike&lt;/a&gt; chance. Secondary stats beneficial to mages are &lt;a href=\"spell%20hit\"&gt;hit rating&lt;/a&gt; (until reaching the hit cap), &lt;a href=\"Spell%20critical%20strike\"&gt;critical strike rating&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"haste%20rating\"&gt;haste rating&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"mastery\"&gt;mastery rating&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Stamina\"&gt;Stamina&lt;/a&gt; also benefits mages, but should not be focused on at the expense of other stats unless gearing for PvP. &lt;a href=\"Agility\"&gt;Agility&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"strength\"&gt;strength&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"spirit\"&gt;spirit&lt;/a&gt; and the other secondary stats should be ignored completely.\nSpecializations.\nMages can choose one of three &lt;a href=\"specialization\"&gt;specialization&lt;/a&gt;s, gaining access to unique abilities and bonuses. Mage specializations focus on enhancing individual schools of magic \u2013 quick, aggressive Fire spells, efficient, controlling Frost spells and punishing Arcane spells.\nArcane.\nManipulates the arcane, destroying enemies with overwhelming power.\nArcane mages' damage focuses on &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Blast\"&gt;Arcane Blast&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Missiles\"&gt;Arcane Missiles&lt;/a&gt;. The Arcane specialization includes &lt;a href=\"Slow\"&gt;Slow&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful instant single-target slowing effect, and &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Barrage\"&gt;Arcane Barrage&lt;/a&gt;, an instant-damage ranged attack. Arcane mages can provide substantial burst damage with &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Power%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Arcane Power (Classic)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Presence%20of%20Mind\"&gt;Presence of Mind&lt;/a&gt;. Leveling as an arcane mage was once very difficult, but with the signature arcane spells (&lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Barrage\"&gt;Arcane Barrage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Missiles\"&gt;Arcane Missiles&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Blast\"&gt;Arcane Blast&lt;/a&gt;) learned much earlier, it is now a far more feasible leveling build.\n\"Mages of the arcane are diviners of secrets, balancing the ebb and flow of incredible mystic energies. Unparalleled skill is required to manipulate the volatile forces of the universe. These practitioners push their magical knowledge to its very limits\u2014often to the brink of their own exhaustion, and at great risk to the world around them. Those who master this craft are capable of releasing a barrage of unrelenting power upon their enemies, drawing upon replenishing energies to maintain their assault for as long as the battle demands.\"\nFire.\nIgnites enemies with balls of fire and combustive flames.\nFire mages' damage output is oriented around &lt;a href=\"Pyroblast\"&gt;Pyroblast&lt;/a&gt; procs; whenever a Fire mage deals two critical strikes in a row, their next &lt;a href=\"Pyroblast\"&gt;Pyroblast&lt;/a&gt; spell is instant. Fire is very strong in AoE where &lt;a href=\"Combustion\"&gt;Combustion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pyroblast\"&gt;Pyroblast&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Living%20Bomb\"&gt;Living Bomb&lt;/a&gt; can be spread via &lt;a href=\"Inferno%20Blast\"&gt;Inferno Blast&lt;/a&gt;. Fights in which players are forced to move frequently can also benefit Fire mages, as &lt;a href=\"Scorch\"&gt;Scorch&lt;/a&gt; and instant Pyroblasts can fill the movement time which Arcane mages can only use &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Barrage\"&gt;Arcane Barrage&lt;/a&gt;. The Fire spec provides few survival tools. This has historically made Fire a good choice for high-end raiders who seek to maximize damage output, but poor in PvP due to &lt;a href=\"Arena\"&gt;Arena&lt;/a&gt;'s survival requirements.\n\"While any worthy mage is an unparalleled expert in the use of magic and heavily dedicated to their craft, those who master the forces of fire tend to be a little more audacious than their peers. If a threat stands before them, the answer is always to neutralize it in a glorious blaze. A lifetime dedicated to the study of fiery forces only fuels their pyromania, and these mages take pride\u2014even pleasure\u2014in igniting their enemies in wild bursts of flame. Mistake their affinity for watching things burn as a lack of self-control at your own peril.\"\nFrost.\nFreezes enemies in their tracks and shatters them with Frost magic.\nFrost mages specialize in crowd control and snaring foes with their various chills, allowing for powerful &lt;a href=\"kiting\"&gt;kiting&lt;/a&gt;, and providing good AoE capability. Frost mages also learn &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Water%20Elemental\"&gt;Summon Water Elemental&lt;/a&gt;, gaining a pet which has a Freeze ability similar to &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Nova\"&gt;Frost Nova&lt;/a&gt;. Frost's AoE makes it the spec best suited to five-player dungeons. \n\"Frost mages stand apart from their colleagues, in that their chosen school of magic focuses on maintaining supreme control over the capabilities of their enemies. Mages who command frost perform chilling displays on the battlefield, rendering foes immobile as they bombard them with ice. Often, the blade never reaches the caster before the bitter cold takes hold. The frost mage exudes frigid power as icicles form around them, foreshadowing the wintry demise of those who stand opposed on the field of battle.\"\nEndgame expectations.\nIn a group or raid environment, mages are usually tasked with ranged &lt;a href=\"DPS\"&gt;DPS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"AoE\"&gt;AoE&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Counterspell\"&gt;Counterspell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spellsteal\"&gt;Spellsteal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"crowd%20control\"&gt;crowd control&lt;/a&gt; and finally &lt;a href=\"Ritual%20of%20Refreshment\"&gt;providing food&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith the introduction of &lt;a href=\"patch%201.11\"&gt;patch 1.11&lt;/a&gt;, mages enjoyed a high degree of flexibility in the endgame. Previous to patch 1.11, it was expected that most mages would spend at least 11 talent points in the arcane tree for &lt;a href=\"Evocation\"&gt;Evocation&lt;/a&gt;, as it is a quite powerful mana-regenerative spell. It was given free without the use of talent points. New changes to all three trees also made investing points into both the fire and the frost trees much more viable. This still holds true with the release of &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;. It should be mentioned that a build predominantly using the fire tree will usually contribute greater DPS in multiple-target encounters; those using a predominantly arcane tree will usually contribute greater DPS in single-target encounters; and finally, those using a predominantly frost tree will contribute a fair amount of control.\nThe endgame mage also acts as a utility class, providing drink, food, buffs and portals. Originally, when it came to providing drink and food, mages were by some considered equal to \"vending machines\" due to their unique ability to create food and drink and provide them with no cost except mana and time. In &lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;Wrath of the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, Refreshment Tables may also be created at level 80 at the cost of five &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Powder\"&gt;Arcane Powder&lt;/a&gt;: the table lasts for three minutes or 50 charges of &lt;a href=\"Conjured%20Mana%20Strudel\"&gt;Conjured Mana Strudel&lt;/a&gt;, whichever comes first. It is expected that a mage provides his party or raid with food and drink for free. A second (or third) table can sometimes be called for while mustering players at the beginning of a raid if the first expires before everyone has received their strudel.\nPvP.\nPvP-wise, mages are considered \"glass cannons\" - a design philosophy which gives mages generous burst damage at the cost of generally low health and armor values. Aided by talents such as &lt;a href=\"Presence%20of%20Mind\"&gt;Presence of Mind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Power%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Arcane Power (Classic)&lt;/a&gt;, they are one of the classes with the potential for dealing out the greatest amount of damage in the shortest amount of time. In group PvP, mages will stay back and focus on crowd control with &lt;a href=\"Polymorph\"&gt;Polymorph&lt;/a&gt; and pick off targets from range. Depending on the Battleground and the situation, mages typically AoE to prevent node captures or nuke flag carriers as fast as possible. In solo PvP, a skilled frost mage is a formidable opponent. Fire mages are in PVP well known for their burst damage, and arcane mages are known as venerable supporters.\nIn the RPG.\nMages, the most common of &lt;a href=\"arcanist\"&gt;arcanist&lt;/a&gt;s, are found all over &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. They focus on magic that creates and changes things, most often with the purpose of damaging their enemies and boosting the power of their allies. Such beings can obtain a familiar, which is a normal animal that gains new powers and becomes a magical beast when summoned to service by a mage, while others choose to become &lt;a href=\"focused%20mage\"&gt;focused mage&lt;/a&gt;s. Mages also understand the workings of arcane energy so well that they can counter most magic with great effectiveness. An adept mage who has dedication to and natural predilection for one of the schools of specialization becomes more entrenched. At this point the mage chooses either evocation or transmutation as a preferred school, and casts &lt;a href=\"spells\"&gt;spells&lt;/a&gt; from his chosen school. The mages of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; first mastered the arts of casting spells using the elements of ice and fire. Mages are also known for being able to summon elementals, usually water elementals, but can also summon air, earth and fire elementals as well. The greatest mortal mage ever to live is the &lt;a href=\"Naga\"&gt;Naga&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt;, who still lives. In fact, she may no longer be mortal.\nThe first known mages on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; were &lt;a href=\"Elf\"&gt;elves&lt;/a&gt;, before the breaking of the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Exile%20of%20the%20High%20Elves\"&gt;Exile of the High Elves&lt;/a&gt;, who lived on the shores of the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; and wielded its powers.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;\nSee also.\nGame mechanics:\nLore:"}

He was one of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; who sided with &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt;. The first three times Urom is engaged, he summons minions and teleports to the next platform. On the third encounter, he teleports to the center ring where the final battle begins.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"Urom has abandoned the Kirin Tor and pledged his loyalty to Malygos, who was more than happy to receive him. The turncoat mage is an invaluable asset for the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragons&lt;/a&gt;. He knows the Kirin Tor's strengths and weaknesses. He knows how they think. And he will use that knowledge to destroy them.\"\nNormal Strategy.\nOn normal Urom is not that difficult, and if you have a competent healer can pretty much be treated as a tank 'and spank boss.\nLike any other difficulty Urom must be pulled around the ring. However, because there is no \"Frost Buffet\" debuff attached to his \"Frost Bomb\" you only need to move when he goes to cast \"Arcane Explosion\". If you can time his movements well enough you can use the cast time of his \"Arcane Explosion\"s to move to the next pillar in line that is devoid of his \"Frost Bomb\" effect. This time is also well used applying bandages and such.\nThe real killer on normal is his \"Time Bomb\" attack. The healer needs to know what to look for, and apply copious amounts of healing to the time bomb target. So long as the damage from \"Time Bomb\" is minimized Urom feels more like a phased tank and spank where you just heal through the \"Frost Bomb\" DoT (with 16k hp it's not that much damage really and only effects the melee).\nSo...\nTime Bombs:\nFrost Bomb:\nStrategy.\n- Urom must be pulled around the ring to a new area whenever he casts Frost Bomb. The ground becomes white where there is Frost Bomb so the tank must back up to a blue area. Since Frost Bomb can last several minutes on the ground after being cast, it is recommended that ranged DPS and the healer should keep ahead of Urom in whichever direction the tank pulls him. It is easy for the tank to pull Urom out of line of sight or out of range if casters/ranged DPS try to follow behind.\n- Players must be watchful for when they have the Time Bomb debuff in which case all they have to do is run away from any other group members before the debuff expires.\n- Like the &lt;a href=\"Talon%20King%20Ikiss\"&gt;Talon King Ikiss&lt;/a&gt; encounter, on occasion Urom will begin to cast an Arcane Explosion with some time to run behind an obstruction and avoid it through &lt;a href=\"line%20of%20sight\"&gt;line of sight&lt;/a&gt;. Urom will always be floating in the center of the ring when casting Empowered Arcane Explosion. \n- It is recommended that you establish 1 area for bombs, 1 area for ranged dps and an area to tank the boss, all within range. Tank and melee dps remain in the frost bomb, running out to the designated area when they have the time bomb. If you find your melee dps dying out, it might help to have them run out of the frost bomb at 50% health or so, bandage and return to the fight.\n- Don't stand in the frost bomb AoE, it stacks and starts doing a lot of damage*\n- Frost Bomb is targeted at the ground where the tank was standing at the beginning of the cast. By moving the moment he begins to cast it, the damage from Frost Bomb can be almost completely avoided. You also move faster because you don't have the movement debuff yet.\nAlternate Strategy.\n- I found the above strategy to be slightly confusing, so I came up with a simpler version.\nGroup:\n80 Warrior Tank\n80 Shaman Healer\n79 BM Hunter DPS\n79 Destruction Lock\n79 Ret Pally\n- I basically employed the strategy from the Half Blood Prince in Kara. (That extra boss added before WOTLK). We engaged him with dps and healer behind the tank. The tank kites him around the circle and the DPS tries to stay away from the frost bomb by staying ahead of the tank. There really is no kiting speed requirement. \n- If any of the dps get hung up in the frost bomb they just ran around the other way and got back to dpsing. \n- No matter when the boss decides to do his arcane explosion you are never more then half way from one of the pillars. The cast time is 8 secs and you have tons of time to move because you are not in the frost bomb (except tank). The arcane explosion hits for roughly 9k so if your tank has over 20k hp and the healer is on the ball there should be no issues. I (as the slowed tank) never had any issues getting away from the explosion each time. \n- He beams to the center when he does his explosion then beams back to one of the party members. It helps if you run to the same pillar.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;\nTrivia.\nMage-Lord Urom is voiced by &lt;a href=\"J.B.%20Blanc\"&gt;J.B. Blanc&lt;/a&gt;."}

Although masters of their arts, the Conjurers who fell during the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt; were unprepared for the rigors of warfare. Determined to avoid a similar fate, the Mages have undertaken a regimen equally demanding on body and soul, thus dedicating themselves to the command of more aggressive and destructive &lt;a href=\"Magic\"&gt;magiks&lt;/a&gt;. Whether in their sanctum at the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Citadel\"&gt;Violet Citadel&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; or on the many battlefields of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, the Mages are resolute in their efforts to defend the people.\nSpells.\nThe Mages of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; have the ability to discharge lightning from their hands when entering into a melee. These swift bolts of energy strike their victims regardless of any armor they may wear. Being the simplest of nature's forces to command, Lightning requires but a fraction of the caster's mana to employ.\n&lt;a href=\"Magic\"&gt;Magiks&lt;/a&gt; involving the cardinal elements of the universe are favorites of the Mages. The Fireball is launched from the palms of the Mage and streaks like a comet blazing across the battlefield - slamming its fiery bulk into whatever stands in its path.\nServing as both a weapon and a barrier, the Flame Shield is a binding of the chaotic force of fire to the aura of the chosen target. A twisting helix of fire that whirls about, the Flame Shield accompanies the one so enchanted wherever he may roam. Flame Shield will deliver damage to any grounded barrier that it comes into contact with.\nThe Mages of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; have been able to create a spell that hinders both movement and reflex. By warping the very patterns of time that surround his target, Slow enables the caster to bring an enemy's offensive to a crawl. Time cannot be held in check by even the mightiest of Mages, however, so the effects of this temporal shift cease as the power of the spell wanes.\nGleaned from sacred tomes rescued from the debris of &lt;a href=\"Northshire%20Abbey\"&gt;Northshire Abbey&lt;/a&gt;, this spell grants the ability to cloud the perceptions of others so that they cannot perceive the physical existence of the caster's target. The individual that is rendered Invisible may not perform any tasks such as attacking, harvesting or spellcasting. Should the individual interact with his environment in any fashion more aggressive than simple movement, the Invisibility will be dispelled and their personage shall be revealed.\nPerhaps the most fearsome of the Mage spells, Polymorph alters the physical form of its target. This metamorphosis changes man to &lt;a href=\"Critter%20%28Warcraft%20II%29\"&gt;beast&lt;/a&gt;, forever warping both mind and body. This sorcery wholly transforms the victim into a creature of the wilds, thus losing their reasoning - making commands for direction or battle impossible. Although there is no counter for this spell, possessing a greater stamina does decrease the possibility of this enchantment taking effect.\nSummoning torrential storms from the frozen Mountains of &lt;a href=\"Northeron\"&gt;Northeron&lt;/a&gt;, this potent spell calls down a fierce tempest of ice to assault the enemies of the Mage with a flurry of cold blades. Blizzard can be cast over large portions of the battlefield, making it an extremely powerful spell when facing legions of &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;ish troops."}

{"id": "13534", "revid": "3154973", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=13534", "title": "Mage races", "text": "This article lists the &lt;a href=\"race\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt;s that are able to become mages, along with the lore behind each. As of patch 10.0 (\"Dragonflight\"), every playable race, with the notable exception of the &lt;a href=\"Dracthyr%20%28playable%29\"&gt;dracthyr&lt;/a&gt;, may follow the path of the mage.\nAlliance.\nHumans.\nWhile &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s have not wielded &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; magic for as long as &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt;, they have a strong tradition of it. When high elf magi brought the secrets of arcane magic to humans, the younger race showed a natural predilection for it. Human mastery of arcane energy was instrumental in vanquishing the ancient &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; empire that threatened human and high elf civilization. Humans and high elves recognized the danger arcane magic posed, and so created the &lt;a href=\"Guardians%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardians of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 powerful arcane casters who guarded against demonic invasion. Since that time, human ability with the arcane has continued and evolved; humans established the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;, a council of archmagi who ruled &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, an arcane city. Even with the destruction wrought in the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, humans remain consummate magi, eager to use flame and ice to scour their enemies. Many human magi are creative, creating spectacular new &lt;a href=\"spell\"&gt;spell&lt;/a&gt;s or new ways to use existing spells. The iconic human mage, however, is a powerhouse of arcane energy. She summons creatures to her aid while pounding her foes with blasts of fire or rains of slashing ice.\nMost of the remaining mages are human. This is mostly because &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; was essentially a human nation, and naturally it culled a great majority of its members from humanity. Humans are also the most populous out of all races who study the arcane arts.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"quel%27dorei\"&gt;quel'dorei&lt;/a&gt; trained the first batch of one hundred humans in the most rudimentary of arcana, they were surprised to find the young race had great natural affinity. The sheer, raw power they could summon up even surpassed what high elven casters were capable of mustering, but they lacked control. This trait became what forever characterized the typical style and approach of human mages. Most human mages prefer using &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; and arcane spells, as they allow for the caster to dish out salvos of raging energy, which become bigger, powerful and more varied streams as the mage gains experience. However, humans still find it difficult to concentrate and focus their attacks for more precise and subtle effects. For example, while a human mage might find incinerating a cadre of &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt;s child's play, lighting the tip of a candle or precisely bombarding a target without harming those around the target may be difficult.\nJust like in real-life medieval wizards and witches, magi are treated with wariness because of their terrifying power. \"&lt;a href=\"Day%20of%20the%20Dragon\"&gt;Day of the Dragon&lt;/a&gt;\" shows this through opinions that magi are \"damned souls\", \"condemned to the same pit of darkness shared by the mythical &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s of old\", no matter how pure the magi's soul are. Even so, with the local magi training in remote cities or towers like Dalaran and the &lt;a href=\"Mage%20Quarter\"&gt;Mage Quarter&lt;/a&gt;, and with the &lt;a href=\"holy\"&gt;holy&lt;/a&gt; magics of the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Holy%20Light\"&gt;Church of the Holy Light&lt;/a&gt; or the magic debilitating spells of the secretive &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; community supplementing the local guard in the enforcement of law; licensed and regulated magic has been tolerated, if not lucrative for human society. Kingdoms such as &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; have long employed their own conjurers and court magi.\nKul Tiran humans.\nWhile &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tiran&lt;/a&gt; mages are relatively uncommon, there are a few prominent examples, such as &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Admiral\"&gt;Lord Admiral&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;. After the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, Dalaranian and Kul Tiran magi, controlled the prison-island of &lt;a href=\"Tol%20Barad\"&gt;Tol Barad&lt;/a&gt;.\nGnomes.\nIn a community as eccentric as mages, for other mages to regard &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnomish&lt;/a&gt; mages as outlandish is really a statement. Gnome mages are characterized by their bizarre and bold (some would say 'whimsically suicidal') probing into just how many things they can get their spells to do. The insatiable curiosity of gnomes is legendary, and all gnomes, of all walks of life, love to tinker. Gnomes as a race hold no general preference for any particular tree of magic or school of thought, but all are highly individualistic, and their idiosyncratic spells are evidence of this. Gnomes have the most creative spell repertoire of all the practicing races by far, and home-made gnomish spells either end up as fabulous successes or extremely dangerous failures.\nDraenei.\n&lt;a href=\"Draenei\"&gt;Draenei&lt;/a&gt; have always been natural magic users. When aboard the &lt;a href=\"Oshu%27gun\"&gt;Oshu'gun&lt;/a&gt; for long journeys the draenei had plenty of hours to study and practice magic. They are one of the oldest races in the &lt;a href=\"universe\"&gt;universe&lt;/a&gt; and therefore have had a lot of time to research and improve their knowledge of the arcane arts. Since they have had so much knowledge passed down and live such long lives to practice it, the draenei are among the most powerful mages in the known universe.\nDwarves.\nThe mages of &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; may have been influenced by their historical friendship with the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;s, as well as their new ties to the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt; and their &lt;a href=\"pyromancer\"&gt;pyromancer&lt;/a&gt;s. They may also have been influenced by the Dark Iron sorcerers of old, before the fragmentation of the dwarves.\n&lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20dwarf\"&gt;Ironforge dwarves&lt;/a&gt; could be mages in \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;s alpha, as well as in the roleplaying games, having a few named arcanists in the source books (&lt;a href=\"Ryona%20Blondbeard\"&gt;Ryona Blondbeard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tomli%20Magellas\"&gt;Tomli Magellas&lt;/a&gt; for example). In \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" the dwarf &lt;a href=\"Tymor\"&gt;Tymor&lt;/a&gt; describes himself as a student of arcane magic and other lost arts, and a dwarven mage (&lt;a href=\"Dorfus%20Alphamage\"&gt;Dorfus Alphamage&lt;/a&gt;) appears in Dalaran in '. With \"\" dwarven mages are once again playable. All told, it is likely that the dwarves have always had mages, though there may well have been a boom in interest in the arcane by the time of &lt;a href=\"the%20Shattering\"&gt;the Shattering&lt;/a&gt;.\nNight elves.\nOne of the new race-class combinations in \"Cataclysm\" is the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; magi. These are returning &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; attempting to make amends, as foreshadowed by &lt;a href=\"Mordent%20Evenshade\"&gt;Mordent Evenshade&lt;/a&gt;. They may also be night elves willing to learn the trade of the arcane once again under Highborne tutors, as witnessed at the &lt;a href=\"Tower%20of%20Estulan\"&gt;Tower of Estulan&lt;/a&gt;. An individual night elven mage, &lt;a href=\"Vestia%20Moonspear\"&gt;Vestia Moonspear&lt;/a&gt;, tells her story about being more interested in the arcane and scholarly research. Arcane magic has been forbidden in Night Elf society since &lt;a href=\"The%20Sundering\"&gt;The Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, yet the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; brought about a greater need to adapt to an ever-changing world.\nWorgen.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Worgen%20%28playable%29\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; that joined the Alliance in \"Cataclysm\" include mages that used to be human before becoming worgen. Most prominently, Archmage &lt;a href=\"Arugal\"&gt;Arugal&lt;/a&gt; was once a respected Gilnean archmage, serving under &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt;.\nHorde.\nTrolls.\nMany may wonder how the &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s, a race performing primitive rituals based around a spiritual &lt;a href=\"religion\"&gt;religion&lt;/a&gt;, could wield the arts of the arcane. Yet the recent alliance between the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear&lt;/a&gt; Tribe and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; showed that the trolls are quite a perceptive race, willing to learn new ways if it is for the best of the tribe, much like the humans back in their primitive days.\nThe arcane arts were once exclusively elven and human, governed by the mages of Quel'thalas and the Kirin Tor of Dalaran. However, the fall of these organizations during the Third War resulted in many scattered mages across Azeroth searching for a place to settle. It is not unlikely that the trolls might have adapted their arcane knowledge from these scavengers, as well as from their recent allies, the Forsaken, who still possess knowledge of the arcane arts in undeath.\nIt is also possible that the &lt;a href=\"Zandalar%20tribe\"&gt;Zandalar tribe&lt;/a&gt;, who had originally been taught arcane magic by the &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt;, are responsible for passing the knowledge on to the Darkspear trolls. \nUndead.\n&lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; mages are mostly fallen former human mages; they may also be affected by their proximity to Dalaran, ancient minions of &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; who could roam the ruins of the fallen city and understand the complex science of magic.\nAs all their un-life is affected by the cold of their bodies, many Forsaken mages are starting to share the virtues of high elves (because they, too, have a long lifespan), using the &lt;a href=\"frost\"&gt;frost&lt;/a&gt; school for the same reasons. A Forsaken mage has the willpower only a man that has abandoned all hope may have.\nBlood elves.\nBlood Elves present a significant force of Arcane mastery in the world of Azeroth. Even before their fall, the Elves were noted for their mastery over Arcane magic. Now, that mastery has been infused with the dark desire for vengeance. Most, if not all Blood Elves have rudimentary knowledge in the Arcane arts and many choose the path of the mage. The main difference between a blood elf mage and their high elven cousins is in their preference of spells. While most high elves choose the frost school, blood elves prefer to practice fire magic.\nOrcs.\nIt is unknown if orcs could become mages before \"Cataclysm.\" Two major orc mages in lore are &lt;a href=\"Acrypha\"&gt;Acrypha&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hagara%20the%20Stormbinder\"&gt;Hagara the Stormbinder&lt;/a&gt;. Acrypha is an eccentric old female orc who trains beginner mages in &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;. She stayed in the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt; libraries studying the arcane for years. Once the Shattering occurred, she decided to return to her people and teach others what she had learned. Hagara also learned the ways of the mage from the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;, though she later defected to the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;.\nA new generation of mages arose in the ranks of &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"True%20Horde\"&gt;True Horde&lt;/a&gt;, being called the &lt;a href=\"Arcweavers\"&gt;Arcweavers&lt;/a&gt;. The remaining Arcweavers joined with the loyalist side after their defeat at the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Mag%27har%20orc%20%28playable%29\"&gt;Mag'har orcs&lt;/a&gt; of the can become mages as well. They were taught how to wield the arcane by the &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Highmaul\"&gt;Highmaul&lt;/a&gt; upon joining the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt;. It is also possible that they were taught by the draenei, as they have taught some orcs how to read and write.\nGoblins.\nGoblins are intelligent creatures and prefer to fight from afar, whether by hiring others or firing off spells. This makes magi a good choice for goblins who prefer to study the arcane arts.\nNightborne.\nAs descendants of the original &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt; are very powerful mages. Every member of their race is able to use magic to some degree, with minor &lt;a href=\"cantrips\"&gt;cantrips&lt;/a&gt; being available to all characters. In addition to wielding the typical arcane arts with great skill, shal'dorei mages have also displayed mastery of chronomancy, &lt;a href=\"time\"&gt;time&lt;/a&gt; magic. This was due to the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Aman%27thul\"&gt;Eye of Aman'thul&lt;/a&gt;'s power being channeled through the &lt;a href=\"Nightwell\"&gt;Nightwell&lt;/a&gt; that sustained the nightborne over the millennia. Drinking the &lt;a href=\"arcwine\"&gt;arcwine&lt;/a&gt; created by the Nightwell allowed the nightborne to endure for 10,000 years after the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, increasing their magical potency as well. In addition to combat applications, they also used time magic for more mundane needs, like rapidly aging arcwine.\nTauren.\nAlthough the path of the arcane has long been shunned by the shu'halo, Horde &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt;, from Kalimdor and &lt;a href=\"Highmountain\"&gt;Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; alike, have recently been seen dabbling.\nNeutral.\nPandaren mage.\nWhile &lt;a href=\"Tushui\"&gt;Tushui&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Huojin\"&gt;Huojin&lt;/a&gt; pandaren mages from the &lt;a href=\"Wandering%20Isle\"&gt;Wandering Isle&lt;/a&gt; have joined forces respectively with the Alliance and the Horde, little is known about their kin's affinity for the arcane. The &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan\"&gt;Shado-Pan&lt;/a&gt;, however, do train fire and frost magic users as their respected &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan%23Omnia\"&gt;Omnia&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Omnia%20Mage\"&gt;mages&lt;/a&gt;. \nOther mage races.\nHigh elf mages.\nHigh elves traditionally were the most arcane-imbued race in the Alliance. Many credited them with discovering arcane magic before the draenei settled on Azeroth, and it is a matter of historical record that high elves taught arcane magic to humans many thousands of years ago. High elf magi are unparalleled masters of the craft. They usually focus their efforts on shaping and changing their spells and expanding their repertoires; they do not let the distractions of familiars, of summoning elementals, or of excessive focus on fire and ice distract them from their chosen path. The iconic high elf mage is a dark and haughty individual, claiming knowledge of arcane secrets that never fell into human hands.\nElven mages tend to have more control over magic than other races. Magic is not just a craft to them, it is a way of life. Having a long lifespan affords several advantages, including plenty of time to study, hone and discover all manner of spells and different ways of applying them. As a result elves are extremely flexible casters, and can handle themselves in all manner of situations. The long-lived casters are also famed for their concentration, precision and control. Because of this, many high elves prefer using frost spells, which reward accuracy and timing. Frost spells are also highly flexible, being equally useful defensively and offensively, manifesting in various forms such as attacks, armors and cages. Blood elves, since their self-proclaimed rebirth as a new race, have embraced fire as their main tree of study.\nBecause of their aforementioned ability to experiment and tweak their spells throughout their long lifetimes, high elf magi are much more knowledgeable about magic than mages of other races, and often possess exclusive knowledge on secret and obscure arcana, sometimes even forbidden and dangerous. They have no humility in constantly reminding other races of this fact.\nNaga mages.\nThe &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; are powerful arcane spellcasters. &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;Night elves&lt;/a&gt; invented the art, after all, and the naga have had 10,000 years to refine it. Indeed, one of the greatest mortal mages ever to live is the naga's queen, &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt;, who still lives. In fact, she may no longer be mortal.\nNaga women are their race\u2019s spellcasters, and over the millennia they have developed a number of talents and techniques related to their art. Through intense study they have learnt to expand their repertoires to include other, unrelated spells. Their spells strike with the fury of the sea, whipping and crushing their opponents. Naga magi receive some military training as well.\nThe iconic naga mage is called a siren, and she slithers forward with her brethren, glaives clutched in two of her arms. The other two weave arcane energy, and she protects her allies and decimates her opponents with her spells. She is assured and arrogant, and with good reason."}

These strange and mysterious workers of magic were a reclusive lot, and placed themselves above the law in many ways. They also demanded absolute secrecy and privacy for their studies, and so required their own domicile. &lt;a href=\"Conjurer%20%28Warcraft%20I%29\"&gt;Conjurers&lt;/a&gt; gathered at the Tower to practice and train in their arcane arts. When new magiks were learned, that knowledge was immediately sent by thought to other conjurers wherever they were in the realm. The recruiting of Conjurers was a common practice, but a price had to be paid in &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; for their services, as few held duty to anyone. The massive energies used in their spells required that the Tower was constructed with long shafts of metal placed within the stone walls to act as a mystic lightning rod, for without these, the building would explode into a thousand pieces. A &lt;a href=\"Blacksmith%20%28WC1%20Human%29\"&gt;blacksmith&lt;/a&gt; had to be made available to create these devices to the exact specifications provided by the Conjurers.\n&lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; noticed several great towers springing from the streets of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; while flying over it, though he couldn't know if they were universities or granaries.

Their sect demanded payment in precious metals for any services they offered, as it was then converted into the mystic symbols used in their castings. Metal cages in which to place the subjects of their experiments had to be constructed, as well as the ornate metal runes that needed to be built into the stone floors for their spells of summoning. Only the &lt;a href=\"Blacksmith%20%28WC1%20Orc%29\"&gt;blacksmith&lt;/a&gt; could provide the needed materials and skills required to meet these exacting specifications.\nSecond War.\nSerpentine spires of living rock formed the foundation of the mage towers where glowing spheres of mystic energy served to replenish and focus the awesome &lt;a href=\"Magic\"&gt;magiks&lt;/a&gt; wielded against the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Orcish Horde&lt;/a&gt;. These towers held ominous secrets that none but the &lt;a href=\"Mage%20%28Warcraft%20II%29\"&gt;mages&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; dared to explore. As extensions of the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Citadel\"&gt;Violet Citadel&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, these towers allowed the mages to research arcane spells, unfettered by the affairs of the temporal plane.\nThird War.\nTheir function was replaced by the &lt;a href=\"arcane%20sanctum\"&gt;arcane sanctum&lt;/a&gt;s.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nHuman mage towers can be found all throughout &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; and .
