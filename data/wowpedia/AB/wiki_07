The naval forces of both factions are destroyed in the ambush, and the survivors find themselves stranded in the ancient naga domain of &lt;a href=\"Nazjatar\"&gt;Nazjatar&lt;/a&gt;.\nSoon after they arrive in Nazjatar, Alliance heroes will come upon a new faction of deep-sea warriors, the &lt;a href=\"Waveblade%20Ankoan\"&gt;Waveblade Ankoan&lt;/a&gt;, while Horde heroes will meet the &lt;a href=\"Unshackled\"&gt;Unshackled&lt;/a&gt;, a group of races who have escaped the naga's clutches.

With enough time and effort, players can dedicate their hard-earned Manapearls to upgrade pieces to ilvl 425, just shy of Heroic-level raid gear (ilvl 430). Harnessing the power of the sea, each piece of Benthic gear boasts a thematic bonus that activates in Nazjatar and the upcoming Azshara's Eternal Palace raid. These bonuses might provide effects that boost your damage, slow down your foes, or even increase your mount speed while adventuring through this perilous region.

Punch Cards can be collected by questing, exploring the Mechagon zone, and advancing through the new Mythic-only dungeon Operation: Mechagon.

These powerful active and passive abilities allow you to customize your playstyle in a whole new way. Each Essence possesses a Major Power (usually a new active ability) and a Minor Power (which is always passive). The Heart of Azeroth has slots for one Major and two Minor Essences. Place an Essence in the Major slot to activate both its Major and Minor Powers, and place up to two in the Minor slots to activate their Minor Powers. Adapt to conquer any situation by applying or swapping them out within rest areas, cities, or when using items such as the Tome of Quiet Mind.\nGrow in power each time you unlock one of four ranks for your Essence. At Rank 1, an Essence's Major and Minor effects are available, while Rank 2 and Rank 3 enhance those Major and Minor effects. Rank 4 adds a flashier cosmetic effect to an Essence's Major Power, providing a distinctive appearance that will make its wielder stand out from the crowd. Earn Essences by completing specific activities, including PvP, raiding, or engaging in &lt;a href=\"World%20Quest\"&gt;World Quest&lt;/a&gt;s. Some Essences are specific to a &lt;a href=\"role\"&gt;role&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"damage%20dealer\"&gt;damage dealer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"tank\"&gt;tank&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"healer\"&gt;healer&lt;/a&gt;), and some are usable by any role. After acquiring an Essence, you'll be able to hover your mouse over the Essence in the user interface to see information about the next rank and how to acquire it.\nPlayers will need to complete a new quest line to unlock the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20Forge\"&gt;Heart Forge&lt;/a&gt; before infusing Essences into the Heart of Azeroth. This will unlock the Major slot, and will reward them with their first Essence. The two Minor slots will unlock at Heart of Azeroth levels 55 and 65 respectively. Players with a Heart of Azeroth below level 35 will have it raised to level 35 upon unlocking the Heart Forge.\nLevel 120 players who have established their new hub in Nazjatar will be invited to join &lt;a href=\"Magni\"&gt;Magni&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20Heart\"&gt;Chamber of Heart&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt; to start the new quest line to unlock the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20Forge\"&gt;Heart Forge&lt;/a&gt;, beginning with the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Essential%20Empowerment\"&gt;Essential Empowerment&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nMount Equipment.\nHave you ever wished that your favorite mount could carry you across the water without sinking?

When players activate Party Sync, everyone in the party becomes aligned to the same quest state and phase. By mousing over a quest in your tracker, you can see who's on a given quest, what their progress is, and who's ready to turn it in. You'll also have access to a \"replay quest\" feature that allows players who have already completed certain quests to replay those quests with their friends for rewards that are appropriate to their current level, regardless of the original level of the quest. Quests can be replayed for rewards once a day.\nRelaxing Level Restrictions.\nWe've also relaxed level restrictions, so lower-level players can queue for instanced content (such as Battlegrounds and dungeons) in their level range, and higher-level players can choose to join them by having their level scaled down.

This link will help you connect with each other, and you'll be able to see if they have purchased game time, which will lead to rewards for you! For each month your recruits have active game time, you'll earn a new reward, such as unique pets, mounts, game time, and more. These rewards unlock each month and scale with the amount of time your recruits have subscribed for. And, of course, with Party Sync you'll be able to journey with your friends on any of your characters.\nNew Mount: Honeyback Harvester.\nStormsong's Beekeepers have discovered a new hive in town. Alliance players can work with Barry to locate the hive and court the favor of the Hivemother in order to earn the Honeyback Harvester mount\u2014and both factions can earn several other bee-themed toys and items.\nNew Timewalking Raid: Firelands.\nWhile Cataclysm Timewalking is active, max-level players will be able to form a raid group and enter the Sulfuron Spire raid. As with previous Timewalking raids (Black Temple and Ulduar), your gear and power are scaled to the challenge, and all the bosses and rewards you expect lie in wait.\nHoliday Updates.\nLunar Festival.\nEmbark on an adventure around &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; to complete the Rite of the Moon and help an old druid bless her Staff of Moonflowers.

This will enable some interesting skips that don't involve the use of Rogues' &lt;a href=\"Shroud%20of%20Concealment\"&gt;Shroud of Concealment&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"invisibility\"&gt;invisibility&lt;/a&gt;.\nAssaults: The Servants of N'Zoth.\nLevel 120 players will witness the overwhelming might of the &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt; firsthand in new &lt;a href=\"Assaults\"&gt;Assaults&lt;/a&gt; on titan facilities in &lt;a href=\"Assault%20in%20Uldum\"&gt;Uldum&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Assault%20in%20the%20Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt;. Players must drive back N'Zoth's minions by completing objectives in the area, including defeating enemies and rare foes, looting treasures, and participating in events. After making some progress, you will face the lieutenant leading the enemy's forces and, once victorious, you will be rewarded with a powerful piece of equipment and a &lt;a href=\"Vessel%20of%20Horrific%20Visions\"&gt;Vessel of Horrific Visions&lt;/a&gt;, a key that gives you access to a new feature: &lt;a href=\"Horrific%20Vision\"&gt;Horrific Vision&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAssault locations will rotate within Uldum in Kalimdor and Vale of Eternal Blossoms in Pandaria, so be sure to check the bottom left of your map (hotkey: m) for the burning eye of N'Zoth to see what foes you face today.\nMantid Assault (Vale of Eternal Blossoms).\nThe peaceful lands of &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; are under siege from the &lt;a href=\"mantid\"&gt;mantid&lt;/a&gt; swarm once again. Squash &lt;a href=\"Shek%27zara\"&gt;Shek'zara&lt;/a&gt;'s insectoid servants to foil the hivemind's plans.\nMogu Assault (Vale of Eternal Blossoms).\nThe warring clans of the &lt;a href=\"Mogu\"&gt;Mogu&lt;/a&gt; over the Vale are surging to a breaking point, leaving devastation in their wake. Beat back their forces to put all sides this proud race on their knees.\nThe Black Empire Assault (Vale of Eternal Blossoms).\nThe restored &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt; is once again threatened by the Old Gods.

Purify the desert sands of his ancient corruption.\nWhile taking part in Assaults, you'll also be able to earn two new reputations: &lt;a href=\"Uldum%20Accord\"&gt;Uldum Accord&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rajani\"&gt;Rajanni&lt;/a&gt;. Each faction will provide new rewards that can be purchased. Players will also be able to enter &lt;a href=\"Lesser%20Visions%20of%20N%27Zoth\"&gt;Lesser Visions of N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt; while Assaults are active. These can be entered solo or with a group and provide a window into the future that will put your sanity and skills to the test as you progress through it. Make sure to watch your sanity bar and work with your team.\nNew Feature: Horrific Visions.\n&lt;a href=\"Horrific%20Vision\"&gt;Horrific Vision&lt;/a&gt;s are instanced challenges for 1 to 5 players that give you a glimpse at the twisted future N'Zoth has in store for &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;. While experiencing a Horrific Vision, your sanity will be under constant attack, increasing the instance's difficulty\u2014and forcing you to leave before you're consumed by insanity.\nEach time you're subjected to a Horrific Vision, you'll leave with more knowledge and fragments of N'Zoth's corruption. Take these to &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"MOTHER\"&gt;MOTHER&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt; to strengthen your defenses and earn new tools, which will allow you to delve deeper into N'Zoth's Horrific Visions and earn greater rewards.\nTo enter, bring a &lt;a href=\"Vessel%20of%20Horrific%20Visions\"&gt;Vessel of Horrific Visions&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20Heart\"&gt;Chamber of Heart&lt;/a&gt; and enter the &lt;a href=\"Vision%20of%20Stormwind\"&gt;Horrific Vision of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Vision%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Titanic%20Research%20Archive\"&gt;Titanic Research Archive&lt;/a&gt;.\nTurning in fragments of N'Zoth's corruption will reward you with abilities that allow you to delve deeper into future Horrific Visions, overcome greater threats, and weather the effects of N'Zoth's sanity-draining attacks. You'll be able to choose from a variety of passive abilities ranging from revealing treasures to mitigating the amount of sanity drained while in the instance.\nBring these fragments to Wrathion and MOTHER in the Chamber of Heart located in Silithus.\nFaceless Masks.\nPlayers seeking the next echelon of rewards and challenges can adventure into bonus areas of Horrific Visions to discover &lt;a href=\"Faceless%20Mask\"&gt;Faceless Mask&lt;/a&gt;s. Wearing these masks raises the difficulty level of Horrific Visions and unlocks improved rewards.\nNew Legendary Cloak: Ashjra'kamas, Shroud of Resolve.\nTo combat N'Zoth's corruption, Wrathion will return and work with players to craft a legendary cloak\u2014&lt;a href=\"Ashjra%27kamas%2C%20Shroud%20of%20Resolve\"&gt;Ashjra'kamas, Shroud of Resolve&lt;/a&gt;. This upgradeable legendary starts at Rank 1 at item level 470, with subsequent ranks increasing its power and adding other unique effects. Wearing this cloak will help players venture deeper into N'Zoth's Horrific Visions, earn greater rewards, and unlock more of the mysteries behind the Old God's power. This cloak may also come in handy when you face off against N'Zoth himself in the upcoming raid.\nWhen you equip the cloak, you'll immediately reduce Sanity loss while in Horrific Visions. At rank 6, the cloak will gain an on-use spell effect that dispels any effects of N'Zoth's Corruption, and provides the wearer with immunity to any further Corruption effects for six seconds (3 minute cooldown). At rank 12, the cloak will also gain a &lt;a href=\"Draconic%20Empowerment\"&gt;Draconic Empowerment&lt;/a&gt; passive, causing your spells and abilities to have a chance to massively increase your primary stat.\nOnce your Ashjra'kamas, Shroud of Resolve reaches rank 15, you can begin to acquire &lt;a href=\"Malefic%20Core\"&gt;Malefic Core&lt;/a&gt;s, which increase your Corruption Resistance by 3, to a maximum of 125. You can acquire one Malefic Core per week across all sources, including defeating N'Zoth in &lt;a href=\"Ny%27alotha%2C%20the%20Waking%20City\"&gt;Ny'alotha&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Normal\"&gt;Normal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Heroic\"&gt;Heroic&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Mythic\"&gt;Mythic&lt;/a&gt; difficulty or by completing all objectives within a Horrific Vision.\nMax-level players who have unlocked the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20Forge\"&gt;Heart Forge&lt;/a&gt; will be able to begin the quests to obtain this new legendary cloak.\nNew Corrupted Items and Rewards.\nIn Visions of N'Zoth, you'll find gear tainted with Corruption. Cursed by N'Zoth, &lt;a href=\"corrupted%20item\"&gt;corrupted item&lt;/a&gt;s offer truly exceptional power\u2014for a price. As you don more corrupted gear, you'll find your spells will do more damage, or your heals will be more potent\u2014but the Corruption will begin to affect you in increasingly perilous ways. At low Corruption levels, you may be slowed periodically when taking damage\u2014while at higher corruption levels, evil forces from the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; may come for you at any moment.\nDeciding how much Corruption to take on is a delicate balancing act, but Corruption can be mitigated with your new legendary cloak and all new &lt;a href=\"Azerite%20Essence\"&gt;essence&lt;/a&gt;s. By equipping these powerful boons, you can negate some of the corruption and reap the benefits of N'Zoth's might with fewer downsides.\nYou can choose to cleanse your items of Corruption through &lt;a href=\"Titanic%20Purification\"&gt;Titanic Purification&lt;/a&gt;, which will cost you some &lt;a href=\"Corrupted%20Mementos\"&gt;Corrupted Mementos&lt;/a&gt;\u2014however, doing so will cause your item to lose the positive equip effect as well.\nHere are a few Corrupted effects that can appear on player equipment.\nIneffable Truth.\nYour Spells and Abilities have a chance to show you the &lt;a href=\"Ineffable%20Truth\"&gt;Ineffable Truth&lt;/a&gt;, increasing the rate your cooldowns recover by 50% for 10 seconds.\nTwilight Devastation.\nYour attacks have a chance to trigger a beam of &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Devastation\"&gt;Twilight Devastation&lt;/a&gt;, dealing damage equal to 5% of your health to all enemies in front to you.\nDeepwind Gorge Redesign.\nVisions of N'Zoth also brings a visual update and redesign for &lt;a href=\"Deepwind%20Gorge\"&gt;Deepwind Gorge&lt;/a&gt;. Inspired by &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Basin\"&gt;Arathi Basin&lt;/a&gt;, the new Deepwind Gorge has five capture points for teams to battle over.

Maybe you're into &lt;a href=\"Mythic%2B\"&gt;Mythic+&lt;/a&gt; dungeons. One of these worlds is going to have a dungeon that can be completed a few seconds faster than all the other dungeons in the metaverse, and that's where everyone's going to want to be!\nNew raid: The Basilica of the Perdurable Vaingloriousness.\n\"Producer's note: Great name! I honestly didn't think we could top the last one! We'll get some details in this section soon.\"\nNew dungeon: The Recursive Perpetuity.\nIn the wake of the &lt;a href=\"Jailer\"&gt;Jailer&lt;/a&gt;'s defeat, all of the unexplored parts of Torghast have become open for plundering, and it's now a mega-mega-MEGA-dungeon with actually infinite floors. Only realm maintenance or a shaky internet connection can stop you from finally reaching the not-really-final boss in what turned out to be the penultimate room and taking all their sweet loot.\nNew Class: Tinker Leaker.\nThe most popular real-life class has finally come to the fantasy world of Azeroth! Available to all races, the Tinker Leaker provides an exciting connection to the history of the definite future of the game itself. Tinker Leakers are a pure support class that can choose between two ranged specializations: Near-Term Guarantee and Distant Assurance.\nAs a Tinker Leaker, you'll follow the other players in your group and buff their spirits with tales of a well-known and interesting activity that is almost certainly on the horizon. You'll heal your allies with promises, and when each encounter ends, your name and appearance will change so that the next round of authentic predictions you cast will increase in persuasiveness.\nNew Professions: Micro-professions.\nAt last, we're going to prove the old adage that less is more with this big new little slate of professions that focus on the small.\nGastronomy \u2013 It's like &lt;a href=\"cooking\"&gt;cooking&lt;/a&gt;, only you make miniscule portions and they're mostly foam.\nMicroscopy \u2013 Get a closer look at the tiniest denizens of whichever world you're on, and catalogue them all until you realize that no matter where you go, they basically all look like the same little circles and squiggles.\nDisc Jockeying \u2013 You don't get to move for the rest of the evening. This micro-profession has you standing in one spot all night, while everyone ignores you until you brutally tease them by not dropping the beat and then when you finally do LET'S GO!\nPersonal Water Sommelier \u2013 Analyze the aqueous provisions on every mage's table for surprisingly interesting facts about total dissolved solids and alkalinity while wearing goggles that would make anyone else look bad but somehow you pull it off.\nBeekeeping \u2013 Only available in that one small part of Stormsong Valley, this is really more of a daily chore than anything, but you didn't learn your lesson with the backyard chickens so \u2026\nMiniature Painting \u2013 Learn how it feels to be an artist by putting some tiny droplets of paint onto scaled-down versions of Azeroth's greatest heroes, then stand back and enjoy! Maybe stand a little farther away than you were just now. Yes, that's better.\nMicrobrewing \u2013 Why should &lt;a href=\"Monk\"&gt;Monk&lt;/a&gt;s have all the fun at home? Convert that one room in your Garrison into a yeasty-smelling funk closet, wait a few months, and then invite your friends over and watch them struggle to find the right words to say about your creation.\nClasses.\n&lt;a href=\"Priest\"&gt;Priest&lt;/a&gt;.\nNo changes needed.\nNew WoW Classic Season Coming Soon: Season of Intermittent Fasting.\nThe next version of WoW Classic sounds easier to you than how you used to play. In fact, there's only one #change to overcome: food buffs are now only available to you in the afternoon.\nAll trainers in the game have been removed.\nNow that you've tried everything else, you may as well give this a shot!"}

He is typically seen as a &lt;a href=\"gear%20check\"&gt;gear check&lt;/a&gt;, and is a prime example of a &lt;a href=\"tank%20and%20spank\"&gt;tank and spank&lt;/a&gt; fight.\nHistory.\nPatchwerk originally appeared as a boss in &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;classic Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt;, being one of &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;'s most powerful &lt;a href=\"abomination\"&gt;abomination&lt;/a&gt;s. His strength and speed came as a shock to those that faced him in combat. Far from a sluggish, mindless undead, Patchwerk used his immense power to pulverize any adversary with a flurry of potent, powerful attacks. When word of his existence first reached the ears of the &lt;a href=\"Brotherhood%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;, none believed the tales of an abomination with such immense speed and strength. Fewer still believed it when he fell the first time.\nPatchwerk was called to to put down the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt;'s insurrection after they broke free of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;'s control.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Death%20Rising\"&gt;Scourge resurgence&lt;/a&gt;, Patchwerk was one of the undead forces reanimated by &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"kyrian\"&gt;kyrian&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20Reanimation\"&gt;Sanctum of Reanimation&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt;. Later, &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s of both the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; were sent by the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; to kill him once again.\nStrategy.\nDefeating Patchwerk depends on sustaining heavy DPS and managing Hateful Strikes. Without sufficient damage, Patchwerk's enrage will eventually destroy the raid. Without dealing with Hatefuls, Patchwerk will rapidly kill the raid's melee; losing these members will likely put the rest of the raid in an impossible situation. However, dealing with these two concerns will make Patchwerk an easy fight.\nHateful Strikes.\nOff-tanks are the safest approach to Patchwerk's Hateful Strikes. These tanks will have enough health and generate enough threat to shield the less armored melee from Patchwerk's attack. Since Hateful Strikes are physical damage, the off-tanks' avoidance and armor will reduce the actual damage taken. This also simplifies the task of healers, as Hateful Strike targets will be very predictable. Note that in 25 player mode, two off-tanks will be needed to fully protect the melee members. The target of Hateful Strike is determined by three requirements:\nEach requirement is dependent on the ones before it, so a high-threat player isn't considered if she's out of range. Similarly, a high-health player isn't considered if he's low on threat.\nIf necessary or convenient, raids may substitute a DPS member in place of a dedicated off-tank. If low DPS is a problem, this compromise of security for damage may be prudent.\nAssuming you have 2 tanks, it is advised to let your \"best\" tank (the one with most health and armor \u2014 dodge is useful) be the Hateful tank, and have your lesser geared tank take Patchwerk's normal hits.\nPulling.\nPatchwerk is linked to the other enemies in his hallway, so these enemies will need to be cleared before Patchwerk is engaged. Once the room is clear, Patchwerk may be pulled.\nEngaging Patchwerk should be done deliberately to ensure that Hateful Strikes don't target unsuspecting raid members. The main tank and off-tanks should engage first, ahead of the melee DPS. Off-tanks should follow the main tank in as closely as possible to prevent the main tank from suffering Hateful Strikes. However, the off-tanks may stand behind Patchwerk; they do not need to stack on top of the main tank. Once these members are in place, all melee DPS may safely engage Patchwerk.\nHealers and tanks should be aware of the fickleness of this pull: until the tanks are in position, Hateful Strikes may hit unexpectedly. Healers should be prepared for this burst damage, and tanks should be prepared to use cooldowns to prevent their death.\nFrenzy.\nFrenzy is a brief, but significant, increase of Patchwerk's damage. A raid with the minimum DPS necessary to kill Patchwerk will endure Frenzy for about 18 seconds. Emergency cooldowns, such as &lt;a href=\"Shield%20Wall\"&gt;Shield Wall&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Survival%20Instincts\"&gt;Survival Instincts&lt;/a&gt;, should be used to offset this buff. These cooldowns should cover the almost all of Frenzy, but if the raid has dead or OOM members, healers must be ready to offset this damage for a longer period.\nEnrage timer.\nPatchwerk will enrage after six minutes of combat. This enrage is not survivable, so raid DPS must be sufficient to kill Patchwerk before six minutes is up.\nFor 10-player, the raid must put out at least 12,000 DPS to beat the enrage timer. For 25-player mode, the DPS requirement comes to 36,200. In both modes, this translates to roughly 2,000 DPS per damage-dealer to defeat Patchwerk. These requirements will be slightly lower in practice since tanks will contribute DPS as well.\nSolo strategy.\nAs in full-size raids, the entire room must be clear, starting from the central landing area all the way to Patchwerk itself. Lightly-armored players must be aware that, even at level 90, Patchwerk hits incredibly hard, so defensive cooldowns are imperative. Self-heals help, but the encounter can be won without it. Pull and use all offensive cooldowns immediately. Patchwerk uses the same abilities from full health to death, so there are no phase transitions to be aware of. All that matters is all-out DPS. Consider kiting at 5% health, as Patchwerk will Frenzy for more damage once he falls to that level.\nIf a &lt;a href=\"Healthstone\"&gt;Healthstone&lt;/a&gt; is available, use it as soon as Patchwerk does 20% damage. Bandages are a waste of time, as the channel will be interrupted as soon as Patch takes a swing. Any other form of damage mitigation, like &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Barrier\"&gt;Ice Barrier&lt;/a&gt;, , or anything similar is incredibly useful. Buff up before the pull, and engage a second or two before the cooldown/debuff expires so it is ready to use as soon as the shield breaks. Classes with HoTs should have them rolling on the pull and refreshed constantly.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;\nExternal links.\n "}

It is however possible in some cases as shown in this &lt;a href=\"http%3A//acdev.org/patchwerkagro.avi\"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;, and is probably just due to the extremely high generation of Rage on tanks due to the massive amount of damage taken. Regardless of the reason, the difficulty of pulling aggro makes it possible for the raid to all-out DPS. This is important, as Patchwerk has about 3,850,000 HP and a 7 minute enrage time limit (your raid needs ~9500 dps minimum to kill him in time).\nThe main part of the fight is to heal through his Hateful Strike ability; It works like this:\nThis fight will generally require your Hateful Strike tanks to be buffed using &lt;a href=\"Flask%20of%20the%20Titans\"&gt;Flasks of the Titans&lt;/a&gt; and Stoneshield Potions and possibly to be specced in Protection.\nSeveral guilds have successfully utilised feral druids as Hateful Strike tanks as they are able to attain very high damage mitigation and hitpoints, and are often able to survive Hateful Strikes without the use of Flasks and Stoneshield Potions. A druid's normal weakness, his lack of Defense to reduce crits and crushing blows, does not apply in this fight. The downside is, they are less able to avoid the Hateful Strikes due to their lack of the Parry ability. If a druid must be used for Hateful Strikes, they should have close to 75% damage mitigation or more, plenty of stamina gear, and an appropriate spec. \nUse the &lt;a href=\"http%3A//tangedyn.9tribes.net/patchwerk\"&gt;Hateful Strike Damage Calculator&lt;/a&gt; to determine if your tanks are geared with sufficient armor and hit points to survive Hateful Strikes.\nAs noted above, the belief that aggro remains locked to the main tank is questionable, since off tanks (and insanely over-dpsing mages &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DMV_hX25_8m0\"&gt;Mage Pulls Aggro with Insane Ignites&lt;/a&gt;) can become the main tank if they create too much threat. It is viable to either use one, or numerous offtanks in the fight. The best seems to be 3, it allows you plenty of time to heal up the OTs without spreading out healing too much. There is no gimmick otherwise, it's all about survival and DPS.\n\"Note: If off tanks use &lt;a href=\"Last%20Stand\"&gt;Last Stand&lt;/a&gt; or they might kick someone out of rotation, however the Main Tank can use it without any risk.\"\nExisting OT/OT healing allocations.\nProactive Healing / Pre-Heal / Cast-Interrupt\n3 OTs with even priority. Healers start casting only after their respective OT takes a Hateful Strike. Minimum 3.6 sec interval between Hateful Strikes assuming an OT is topped up every 3.6 sec. Due to interface lag/latency/human reaction time, it works well with low latency only. Use of addons can greatly improve the success rate of reactive healing.\nLoot.\nYou receive 100 reputation with the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt; at all reputation levels.\nNotes.\nHis name comes from \"patchwork\"; as an Abomination, he's a disgusting amalgamation of flesh, bones, meat, metal, and threads.\nThe Avatar of War refers to the Everquest boss of the same name. The boss had a similar ability to Hateful Strike, in that it would unleash massive damage to the tank, that would have to be healed through. It was widely believed at the time that no player could possibly tank that."}

Players would have been able to join cults dedicated to various &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt;s and, by following in the path of a titan, would be able to unlock a new type of glyph known as an &lt;a href=\"ancient%20glyph\"&gt;ancient glyph&lt;/a&gt;, which would have been completely unrelated to the &lt;a href=\"inscription\"&gt;inscription&lt;/a&gt; profession.\nPlayers could earn progress down any of these paths by doing things such as questing, raiding, PvP, trade skills, etc., with a possible weekly cap for maximum progress. Over time, characters would be able to unlock new ancient glyphs that will greatly benefit them. Each path consisted of 10 ranks, with ten slots numbered from I to X; at each rank players would be presented with a selection of two to three different ancient glyphs from which to fill the slot. This system was designed to provide a 20% character-power increase over the course of the expansion and would be compatible with dual specialization.\nPlayers earned these ancient glyphs by using the archaeology profession to recover and trade in titan artifacts. Respeccing would be possible should players decide to go down another path. Some possible paths were:\nSome examples for ancient glyphs available through the Path of Golganneth include:\nLore.\nWith &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;'s return triggering the Cataclysm and wracking the land with disaster, the denizens of Azeroth found themselves in a time of great upheaval. That, coupled with recent discoveries unearthed in &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt; regarding the &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt;s, has caused a number of cults to spring up, following in the paths of the Titans in order to obtain new powers."}

He is the mouthpiece of his demon-crazed master, &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;. He is the head of all the blood elves' devious schemes and has been connected thus far with the massive red crystal at &lt;a href=\"Fallen%20Sky%20Ridge\"&gt;Fallen Sky Ridge&lt;/a&gt; in the west of &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; and a mysterious scheme dubbed \"&lt;a href=\"Firewing%20Point%20Project\"&gt;Project at Firewing Point&lt;/a&gt;\". He is also Kael'thas' personal envoy between the &lt;a href=\"Manaforge\"&gt;Manaforge&lt;/a&gt;s in the &lt;a href=\"Netherstorm\"&gt;Netherstorm&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nHe is one of the many &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; that followed &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas\"&gt;Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; and joined &lt;a href=\"Illidan\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt;, until they defected from him for the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nKael'thas left a huge red crystal at &lt;a href=\"Fallen%20Sky%20Ridge\"&gt;Fallen Sky Ridge&lt;/a&gt; as an experiment, which caused the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Colossus\"&gt;colossi&lt;/a&gt; and threatened the security of the zone. Pathaleon oversaw that experiment, but the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Expedition\"&gt;Cenarion Expedition&lt;/a&gt; sent &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to destroy the colossi and then to heal the land. Pathaleon called to &lt;a href=\"Goliathon\"&gt;Goliathon&lt;/a&gt; to defeat the intruders but the king of the colossi was defeated.\nAlthough this experiment was a failure, he continued with the &lt;a href=\"project%20at%20Firewing%20Point\"&gt;project at Firewing Point&lt;/a&gt;, and as a vengeance to the druids he exploded a prototype of a &lt;a href=\"mana%20bomb\"&gt;mana bomb&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Thicket\"&gt;Cenarion Thicket&lt;/a&gt;. However, the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; sent adventurers that destroyed his plans and exploded the proper mana bomb within &lt;a href=\"Firewing%20Point\"&gt;Firewing Point&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the failure he continued overseeing the Manaforges. He gave orders to &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Dawnforge\"&gt;Commander Dawnforge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arcanist%20Ardonis\"&gt;Arcanist Ardonis&lt;/a&gt; and then kept attention to his matters in &lt;a href=\"Tempest%20Keep\"&gt;Tempest Keep&lt;/a&gt;. The Manaforges were then destroyed by the &lt;a href=\"Aldor\"&gt;Aldor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Scryers\"&gt;Scryers&lt;/a&gt;.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"Following the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;'s defilement, the vainglorious arcanist Pathaleon saw an opportunity to gain renown by aiding Kael'thas in finding a cure for his race's addiction to magic. This single-minded quest led him to join the blood elf prince on &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; and oversee his disastrous experiments. Most recently, Pathaleon has begun harnessing the Tempest Keep's otherworldly technologies in pursuit of fame and power.\"\nPrior to the fight.\nOn the way to Pathaleon, groups must first clear 6 waves of adds in a scripted event. The first 3 waves come one after another. The second set of 3 (reverse sequence to the first) comes only when the group moves further along the path towards Pathaleon. Once the last mob in the 6th wave is killed, Pathaleon will spawn and give the group a short time to rest before engaging.\nIt is a good idea to keep one of the guys with fire shield sheeped until everyone has regained full HP/mana, then kill that mob. If you have a mage, spellsteal the fire shield, and use it on the adds in the boss fight.\nPathaleon spawns 3 elemental adds every 30\u201345 seconds, which cast arcane missiles. Like most blood elves, he has a single target mana drain ability called mana tap, which puts a corresponding mana tap buff on him - it can be purged or spellstolen. Regardless of the number of mana taps on him, he will occasionally cast arcane torrent, an AoE silence effect - it has a short duration, and can largely be ignored. Pathaleon will also occasionally mind control a random player for 12 seconds.\nStrategy.\nWaves of Adds Before the Boss.\nThe first set of 3 waves consist of a wave of 4 blood elves, followed by a solo robot, followed by another wave of 3 blood elves. The first set will spawn once one person has stepped just beyond the boundary of the door from &lt;a href=\"Nethermancer%20Sepethrea\"&gt;Nethermancer Sepethrea&lt;/a&gt;'s room onto the bridge. The leader probably will not have enough time to mark when the groups of blood elves spawn, so it maybe easier just to randomly CC any two mobs and have the tank quickly pick up the remaining one or two. Alternately, the whole group can run down the elevator after the mobs spawn, so that they can be marked as usual when come back. You will be removed from combat for a brief moment after the last mob in a wave has been killed, so capitalize upon this to recover mana by drinking. If the healer is low on mana, or anyone is killed, the group can always run down the elevator to get out of combat.\nAfter the first 3 waves have been killed, rest to full health and mana, and have one person run down the bridge until the next set of mobs spawn. It's best to engage the second set of waves in Nethermancer Septhera's room, as this will increase the amount of time the group has to rest between waves. On the 6th wave, keep one mob crowd controlled (preferably a Sunseeker Astromage) and allow the group's mana to regenerate to full. If possible, spellsteal the Astromage's fire shield. Once you are confident you have enough mana, move down the bridge. Allow the last mob to come to your group, and kill it. Pathaleon will aggro upon its death.\nThe actual boss fight.\nThe best place to fight Pathaleon is in his room at the end of the walkway. The first thing to note is that he will spawn the 3 arcane elementals every 30\u201345 seconds. They have a decent amount of hit points and the arcane missiles hit for about 800. They will all despawn when the Pathaleon is down to 20% health. Another thing to watch for is that Pathaleon will mind control the second person in proximity to him frequently. This player will be mind controlled for about 8\u201310 seconds, during that time heal the boss or attack party members. A good way to handle this, is to crowd-control the mind-controlled player and dispel it afterward if possible. Other than that, he will melee the main tank and does not hit incredibly hard.\nThe Domination mind control can be broken with the PvP trinket (on Heroic as well).\nHandling the adds is probably the hardest part of this fight. Many strategies are possible. Make sure everyone understand what the plan is before starting the fight. The more commonly used ones are listed here:\nAfter downing the boss to 20% with either of the above strategy, continue dps him and he should be dead in no time.\nHeroic.\nThis fight is naturally more difficult than normal mode. In addition to his normal abilities, Pathaleon now has an arcane explosion with a two second cast time that hits for around 2000 damage. It is possible for all but the tank and melee to avoid it, and it appears to have a 10 second cooldown. (This AoE is interruptible. A rogue can Kick, or a warrior can Shield Bash it while in progress. Also, Pathaleon is susceptible to mind numbing poison, which will give you a touch more time to kick the arcane explosion.)\nIt's worth noting that the spawned elementals have more HP than in normal, and it is much more difficult to bring them down. Therefore, the two adds killing strategies are less practical in heroic.\nQuotes.\nTCG\nPathaleon the Calculator's Image"}

He betrayed both his people and his mentor &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"demon%20lord\"&gt;demon lord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; for personal gain and power, and was directly responsible for the orcs' fall to &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic &lt;a href=\"slavery\"&gt;enslavement&lt;/a&gt; and their &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;subsequent invasion&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Tutored by the leaders of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, he is considered one of the most powerful warlocks to have ever existed. He founded the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt; and created the first &lt;a href=\"Death%20knight%20%28Old%20Horde%29\"&gt;death knights&lt;/a&gt;. Gul'dan often referred to himself as \"Darkness Incarnate\" and \"The Destroyer of Dreams.\"\nGul'dan serves as the overarching antagonist in ', the main antagonist in ', and a posthumous antagonist for the rest of the &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20universe\"&gt;\"Warcraft\"&lt;/a&gt; franchise, though his &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;alternate version&lt;/a&gt; does appear as one of the main antagonists in of \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\".\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nGul'dan was born crippled, weak and deformed in a village in &lt;a href=\"Gorgrond\"&gt;Gorgrond&lt;/a&gt;. His condition made him a target for constant mockery and abuse, for which he hated his clan. When the others finally tried to beat him to death to be rid of him, the clan's &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; stopped them and told Gul'dan that he saw greatness in him, advising him to go to the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20the%20Elements\"&gt;Throne of the Elements&lt;/a&gt; to seek his destiny. Gul'dan angrily rejected the shaman, and the chieftain banished Gul'dan from the village.\nThe bitterness that had sustained him all his life ate at him until nothing was left. After months of starvation and wandering alone through the wastes, Gul'dan began to consider that the safety of a clan might be better than endless suffering. He finally heeded the old shaman's words and, dragging himself to the Throne of the Elements, offered himself in the service of whatever would end his anguish. The &lt;a href=\"furies\"&gt;spirits&lt;/a&gt; of fire, earth, water, and air approached him but, sensing the darkness and fury within the orc's heart, violently recoiled from him. However, in the absence of the furies, &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; began to whisper to him. The demon lord offered Gul'dan power in return for becoming the harbinger of his fury.\nKil'jaeden needed a public figure to unite the orcs against the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;, but Gul'dan could not inspire or lead his people by example. Kil'jaeden ordered him to ally with someone who could, but first he would need to eliminate everyone who knew of his past. Gul'dan returned to his village, draped in tattered robes. When the chieftain furiously reminded Gul'dan that he was never allowed to return to his people, Gul'dan roared that he \"had\" no people and obliterated the chieftain with &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; energy. Gul'dan then went on a rampage, killing all of his former brethren. As the village burned, Gul'dan spotted the village shaman - the only source of any relative kindness in his life. Gul'dan earnestly thanked the shaman, saying that he had found his destiny, then killed him as well. Claiming the shaman's staff and a &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20the%20Scoured%20Clan\"&gt;ring&lt;/a&gt;, Gul'dan left the burning ruins of his birthplace behind forever. Its name and existence would be lost to history - just as the vengeful Gul'dan preferred.\nRise of the Horde.\nCareful to hide his fel powers, Gul'dan approached the &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20clan\"&gt;Shadowmoon clan&lt;/a&gt;, whose shaman commanded respect from all orcs, perfect for Kil'jaeden's plan. He told them that his village had been destroyed by &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s and he was the only survivor. Orcs accepting newcomers into clans was uncommon, but the Shadowmoon took pity on Gul'dan and did just that. Gul'dan carefully observed the clan's shaman for one that would work, and eventually settled on the chieftain &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;. He was dedicated, forthright, and persistent, but also held turmoil and sorrow because of the death of his mate &lt;a href=\"Rulkan\"&gt;Rulkan&lt;/a&gt; and the recent trouble with elemental spirits. Gul'dan preyed on Ner'zhul's inner darkness. He told the chieftain of his own troubles, of the family and friends he had lost at his village, and in time befriended him, and convinced him to take him on as an, unbeknownst to him, pretend shaman apprentice. Through Gul'dan, Kil'jaeden now had access to a public figure. As the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; began to manipulate Ner'zhul, he tasked Gul'dan with making the orcs see the draenei as enemies. Gul'dan was present at the &lt;a href=\"Kosh%27harg%20celebration\"&gt;Kosh'harg celebration&lt;/a&gt; in Nagrand.\nAs Ner'zhul rallied the orcs for a war against the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; at the behest of a powerful ancestor referred to as \"The Beautiful One\" (in truth, Kil'jaeden in disguise), Gul'dan supported Ner'zhul fully. However, when Ner'zhul began to notice that they could no longer call upon the power of the elements or the ancestors, the shaman began to sense something was amiss. He discovered at &lt;a href=\"Oshu%27gun\"&gt;Oshu'gun&lt;/a&gt; that he had been duped by Kil'jaeden and attempted to back out. To Ner'zhul's horror, he discovered that Gul'dan had seen everything at Oshu'gun and told Kil'jaeden of it all before Ner'zhul returned.\nAs a necessity of his bid for power, Gul'dan trained a number of like-minded and powerful orcs, whom he named the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt;. The Council was soon using its power and influence to direct almost every aspect of orc society, so as to distract &lt;a href=\"Durotan\"&gt;those&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;few&lt;/a&gt; who opposed his dark ideals from their true masters, Gul'dan and Kil'jaeden. He opened schools of demonology and necromancy to teach shamans new power to replace their lost connections to the elements, transforming them into &lt;a href=\"necrolyte\"&gt;necrolyte&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s. To seal the bargain between him and Kil'jaeden, Gul'dan and the Shadow Council offered the clan chieftains the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20of%20Mannoroth\"&gt;Blood of Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt;. The first chieftain to accept his gift was &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grommash Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, with majority of the remaining following suit right after. The resulting Horde was bloodthirsty, barbaric, and evil, an extension of the demons whom they now worshiped.\nWhile creating the Shadow Council Gul'dan would encounter the ogre &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt;, who had been forced to flee from &lt;a href=\"Highmaul\"&gt;Highmaul&lt;/a&gt; after escaping assassination. Gul'dan became intrigued by Cho'gall's confidence and lust for power and made him his foremost apprentice, teaching him fel magic and of the existence of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nAnother individual Gul'dan encountered was &lt;a href=\"Garona\"&gt;Garona&lt;/a&gt;. As a half-&lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;, half-&lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; outcast, Garona had found survival to be brutally difficult. She had learned quickly how to avoid unwinnable fights, and how to quietly kill relentless pursuers. Gul'dan bound her mind to his will and began to secretly train her in the art of assassination. She did not fully understand his intentions, but she grew to resent his cruelty. Still, she obeyed. Survival demanded nothing less. Gul'dan had her magically aged and tortured. Having also traveled throughout &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, Garona was well-versed in the culture of the orcs. She quickly became the chief interpreter of the Shadow Council and Gul'dan's personal &lt;a href=\"spy\"&gt;spy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"assassin\"&gt;assassin&lt;/a&gt;. Per Kil'jaeden's instructions, he also had the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock&lt;/a&gt; orcs craft daggers &lt;a href=\"Anguish%20and%20Sorrow\"&gt;Anguish and Sorrow&lt;/a&gt; for Garona, which she used to carry out countless atrocities while under Gul'dan's control, including the eventual murder of &lt;a href=\"Llane%20Wrynn%20I\"&gt;King Llane&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs a test of the Horde's strength, Gul'dan and the Shadow Council guided the orcs into murdering every single draenei they could find on their homeworld. The near-extermination of the draenei, a race as old as his master Kil'jaeden, proved that the orcs were ready for the next slaughter. He also sent &lt;a href=\"Blackheart%20the%20Inciter\"&gt;Blackheart the Inciter&lt;/a&gt;, whom he recruited after taking control of the Horde, and &lt;a href=\"Vorpil\"&gt;Vorpil&lt;/a&gt; with a group of orcs to plunder &lt;a href=\"Auchindoun\"&gt;Auchindoun&lt;/a&gt;. Gul'dan also manipulated the election of &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; as the Horde's new warchief, as he was the perfect pawn for the Shadow Council. Though Blackhand was competent in battle and a relatively sound tactician, he had a lust for power \u2014 and thus was easy for Gul'dan to control.\nThe First War.\nEventually, Gul'dan was contacted by the mad sorcerer &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt; - possessed by the Dark Titan &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;. Medivh approached Gul'dan and the Shadow Council as a hooded stranger. Gul'dan tried attacking the figure with his fel powers, which Medivh merely threw back at the orc. Seeing no reason to be gentle to someone who sold his entire race to the Burning Legion, Medivh made Gul'dan kneel before him in front of the Shadow Council, an insult Gul'dan would never forget or forgive.\nMedivh offered him the promise of godhood, locked away within the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; if he would use the Horde to conquer Azeroth. Gul'dan agreed, and with the assistance of the Shadow Council, he helped Medivh open the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; between Azeroth and Draenor. Nearly every draenei prisoner who still lived was brought to the base of the Dark Portal. At the moment the ritual began, Gul'dan drained all of their life essences in an instant, giving the massive burst of power needed to cross such a large distance. Over the next few years, Gul'dan and his ogre-mage apprentice &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt; would secretly manipulate the Horde as it rampaged across Azeroth. Gul'dan convinced &lt;a href=\"Grom%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grom Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20clan\"&gt;Warsong clan&lt;/a&gt; to remain on Draenor during the conflict later known as the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;.\nGul'dan saw the Horde led to supremacy over most of the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;. During the Year 3, prior to the final siege of Stormwind, Gul'dan was aware of a raiding party against Medivh's tower of &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt;. Realizing that the Azerothians intended to slay the Guardian, Gul'dan hastily ransacked Medivh's mind for the Tomb's location. He was still deep within the Guardian's thoughts when &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Lothar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; killed him, ending Medivh's treachery and forcing Gul'dan into a coma. Garona, still under mind control of the Shadow Council, then assassinated &lt;a href=\"Llane%20Wrynn%20I\"&gt;King Llane&lt;/a&gt; in the name of Gul'dan, cutting his heart out.\nWithout the counsel of Gul'dan, Blackhand was easily slain by &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt;, who, with information acquired from an interrogated and tortured Garona, proceeded to slaughter Gul'dan's warlocks and the majority of the Shadow Council.\nThe Second War.\nGul'dan awoke from the coma with only Cho'gall, the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"necrolyte\"&gt;necrolyte&lt;/a&gt;s still loyal to him; Blackhand, the Shadow Council and the warlocks were dead, and Garona and the other clans had betrayed him. Garona's betrayal of course had been forced. Doomhammer was willing to spare Gul'dan's life, despite his gut feeling he would one day regret this, and even let him run &lt;a href=\"Balor\"&gt;Balor&lt;/a&gt; and the ruins of Stormwind Castle, in exchange for information in regards to Blackhand's followers. This was simple enough; &lt;a href=\"Rend%20Blackhand\"&gt;Rend&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Maim%20Blackhand\"&gt;Maim&lt;/a&gt; hadn't professed continued loyalty to Gul'dan, so the warlock had no qualms about betraying them. Gul'dan informed Doomhammer that the &lt;a href=\"raider\"&gt;raider&lt;/a&gt;s were preparing to join the sons of Blackhand and stage a coup against him, as Blackhand had once been a raider himself. Whether this information was true or not (not even Gul'dan was certain), it was possible, and Doomhammer disbanded the raiders and placed them among the many grunt regiments.\nAs a token of his \"loyalty\" to the new warchief, Gul'dan promised to create an army of undead riders loyal to him and him alone. Gul'dan and his necrolytes, led by &lt;a href=\"Rakmar%20Sharpfang\"&gt;Rakmar Sharpfang&lt;/a&gt;, tried to place the souls of the dead warlocks into the dead bodies of the Stormwind knights, and thus raising them as undead sorcerers. Their efforts were continuously met with failure, and a frustrated Gul'dan eventually found another way. He and Cho'gall joined his necrolytes in a powerful ritual, and at its height he slaughtered each and every one of them. He transformed their hearts into mystical gems containing all their necromantic power and their souls. He placed these gems into truncheons and gave these truncheons to the bodies of the orc-possessed knights, and was met with success as each one awakened the moment the truncheon was placed in its hand. They became the dread &lt;a href=\"Death%20knight%20%28Old%20Horde%29\"&gt;death knights&lt;/a&gt;, who Gul'dan believed would be loyal to him alone and not Doomhammer. However, neither Gul'dan nor Doomhammer realized that the death knights were loyal only to themselves.\nBefore the true start of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, Gul'dan founded and created his own clan, the &lt;a href=\"Stormreaver%20clan\"&gt;Stormreavers&lt;/a&gt;, to protect him from Orgrim. He also created during the ensuing conflict many &lt;a href=\"Ogre%20mage\"&gt;ogre magi&lt;/a&gt; out of a band of extremely loyal &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt; enforcers by warping and twisting the energy of the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elven&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"runestone\"&gt;runestone&lt;/a&gt;s. Secretly Gul'dan was also amassing a great navy for the next step of his plan.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"burning%20of%20Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;burning of Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, Gul'dan intended to use the power of the &lt;a href=\"Altar%20of%20Storms\"&gt;Altars of Storms&lt;/a&gt; to break through &lt;a href=\"Ban%27dinoriel\"&gt;Ban'dinoriel&lt;/a&gt;'s protection. As the Altars were crafted from the elves' own &lt;a href=\"runestone\"&gt;runestone&lt;/a&gt;s, which were originally powered by the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; thought to use that link in reverse, sending his own magic into their power source and either destroying it or wresting it away from them.\nBetrayal and death.\nUltimately, Gul'dan's thirst for power proved to be the Horde's undoing. On the eve of Doomhammer's attack on Lordaeron's capital, Gul'dan took the Stormreaver and Twilight's Hammer clans and set out to sea to locate the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;. With nearly half of his standing forces suddenly gone, Doomhammer was forced to retreat and hunt down the traitorous warlock. This reprieve would ultimately give the Alliance time to regroup and retaliate.\nGul'dan did indeed locate the Tomb and used his power to raise it from the ocean floor and creating the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;. Taking with him his most select followers, Gul'dan cast open the doors and entered and began searching for the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Eye of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;. He did not however find the godhood he was hoping for. Instead, he was torn to shreds by a swarm of insane demons that had long ago been drawn to the tomb through the dark magics that emanated from Sargeras's remains. The remainder of his clans were slaughtered by Doomhammer's retaliation. In those last moments, Gul'dan realized he had just been a pawn, that &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; had fooled him into doing his dirty work.\nLegacy.\nAfter Gul'dan died, his &lt;a href=\"Skull%20of%20Gul%27dan\"&gt;skull&lt;/a&gt; was turned into a channeling totem for demonic energy. A small shard of Gul'dan's soul remained within the bleached bone of the skull, where he whispered to whoever held it; the warlock proved to still be dangerous, even in death. The skull was used by Ner'zhul to open portals to other worlds on Draenor, and later by &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; to destroy the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;. After the destruction of the Dark Portal, Khadgar left the skull behind on &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; in his haste to escape through one of Ner'zhul's rifts. Years later it would appear again on Azeroth, this time used by the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; to corrupt the forests of &lt;a href=\"Felwood\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt;. After learning of its existence from &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; the death knight, &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; found and took the skull, absorbing its power, remaining only half &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; and becoming half-demon. Gul'dan's memories survived within the warlock magic of his skull and the runes he painted on the walls of the Tomb. Illidan found the Tomb using Gul'dan's memories from the Skull, and &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; found the runes. A magical artifact carried by Gul'dan, the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Orb\"&gt;Shadow Orb&lt;/a&gt;, was shattered and found by Maiev.\nHis loyalists in the Twilight's Hammer clan would turn from the Burning Legion and begin worship of &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;new masters&lt;/a&gt;.\nGul'dan's &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;alternate universe counterpart&lt;/a&gt; would later come to serve the Burning Legion as well. During the &lt;a href=\"war%20in%20Draenor\"&gt;war in Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, Gul'dan captured several &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; soldiers and tortured them for information about his counterpart from the original timeline. All he managed to learn from them was that his other self had accompanied the first Horde to war and had eventually been killed, but \"details were harder to come by\". When the alternate Gul'dan was later sent by the Legion to re-open the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; and allow the Legion to begin the largest demonic invasion Azeroth had ever seen, &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; revealed why the original Gul'dan had been killed by the demons he once served.\nGul'dan's skeleton (sans his &lt;a href=\"Skull%20of%20Gul%27dan\"&gt;skull&lt;/a&gt;) and the runes he left behind are found by &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s in the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;.\nVision of Gul'dan in Shadowmoon Valley.\nA vision of Gul'dan can be seen at the &lt;a href=\"Altar%20of%20Damnation\"&gt;Altar of Damnation&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Valley\"&gt;Shadowmoon Valley&lt;/a&gt; in what is now &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 the remnants of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;. The altar lies in front of a massive volcano known as the &lt;a href=\"Hand%20of%20Gul%27dan%20%28subzone%29\"&gt;Hand of Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;. The repeating vision appears to depict an event prior to the opening of the Dark Portal, where according to the &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt;, the volcano was raised from the valley floor by Gul'dan himself when he severed the orcish people's connection to the elemental spirits of Draenor.\nPowers and abilities.\n&lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt; acknowledged that Gul'dan was the single most powerful warlock among his people. This was likely correct; the &lt;a href=\"Skull%20of%20Gul%27dan\"&gt;Skull of Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; remained an incredibly powerful focus of &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; magic for decades after the orc's death, and was shown to have retained his knowledge, and personality, allowing Gul'dan to manipulate others, such as Ner'zhul, from beyond the grave. Its power was enough to fully transform &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; into a demon, and passed on all of Gul'dan's knowledge to him. He also was responsible for raising the gigantic fel volcano known as the &lt;a href=\"Hand%20of%20Gul%27dan%20%28subzone%29\"&gt;Hand of Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; after severing the orcs' ties to the elemental spirits of Draenor.\nHe was so powerful, he was able to raise the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt; from the bottom of the ocean during the Second War in a great display of power, though he was overcome by the sheer number of vile, mad demons found within &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;the Tomb&lt;/a&gt;.\nGul'dan was also able to &lt;a href=\"Asghar%27s%20Totem\"&gt;wipe out&lt;/a&gt; the Sketh'lon &lt;a href=\"arakkoa\"&gt;arakkoa&lt;/a&gt; with a single spell that not only destroyed their camps, but twisted their spirits too.\nMemorable quotes.\n&lt;a href=\"Tides%20of%20Darkness\"&gt;Tides of Darkness&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nIn the RPG.\nPersonality.\nGul'dan possesses an unquenchable thirst for power and a ruthless personality. Equally willing to manipulate friend and foe alike, he constantly tries to better his station in life through any means possible. Even though Gul'dan constantly tends to be embroiled in many different plots and schemes, his overarching goal is always to discover the location of the Tomb of Sargeras and to claim the dark titan's powers for himself. Nothing else matters in comparison to this quest, and Gul'dan is willing to betray his own people and sacrifice his closest friends to achieve it.\nGul'dan can only be trusted to do what is in his own best interests. He often freely offers wealth to people in exchange for clues or information that might be useful, and then has them killed and reclaims his payment. Gul'dan only truly trusts people who are like himself \u2014 those who are openly ambitious and who will do anything to improve their lot in life. He feels that those people can be most easily predicted and manipulated through offers of wealth or prestige. It is the people who serve higher moral or religious powers that he fears. They are often resistant to his lures, and in Gul'dan's eyes can never be completely trusted or relied upon. Because of this, he tends to associate most easily with mages, sorcerers, rogues and scouts and dislikes druids, priests and paladins. His allegiance is with the Horde, and he is openly hostile to members of the Alliance races unless they are key to something Gul'dan desires.\nCombat, powers and abilities.\nGul'dan summons monsters to distract and harass his foes before entering melee with his demon staff against foes that have been isolated by his divide-and-conquer tactics.\nGul'dan is widely agreed to be one of the most powerful beings ever encountered. &lt;a href=\"Brann\"&gt;Brann&lt;/a&gt; believes that \"Gul'dan became the most powerful mortal warlock in history\".\nIn Heroes of the Storm.\nGul'dan is a playable character in \"&lt;a href=\"Heroes%20of%20the%20Storm\"&gt;Heroes of the Storm&lt;/a&gt;\". Azmodan, a character from \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;\", has a skin called \"Azgul'dan Azmodan\".\nAlternate timelines.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; was traveling through alternate timelines, he witnessed Durotan telling Orgrim about Gul'dan's betrayal in one of the timeways.\nAn alternate appears in the alternate in the past during the &lt;a href=\"war%20in%20Draenor\"&gt;war in Draenor&lt;/a&gt; and escapes to the \"prime timeline\" Azeroth.\n&lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan%20%28film%20universe%29\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; from yet another universe appears in the &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20film%20universe\"&gt;Warcraft film universe&lt;/a&gt;.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

Trained in the arts arcane by the &lt;a href=\"Daemon\"&gt;Daemon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;, Gul'dan is perhaps the most powerful Warlock ever to walk the temporal plane. Obsessed with discovering the legendary &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, he hopes to obtain ultimate power by deciphering the secrets ascribed by the &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Daemonlord&lt;/a&gt; since times long forgotten. Gul'dan has used his &lt;a href=\"Magic\"&gt;magiks&lt;/a&gt; to bring into being a host of servants for the Horde. &lt;a href=\"Necrolyte\"&gt;Necrolyte&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Ogre%20mage\"&gt;Ogre-Magi&lt;/a&gt;, and the dread &lt;a href=\"Death%20knight%20%28Old%20Horde%29\"&gt;Death Knights&lt;/a&gt; are all results of his endless experiments with the forces of magic. Although his spawn of his work have strengthened the Horde, the true loyalties of Gul'dan lie only with himself and his quest to become omnipotent.\nSpells.\nBy enveloping their truncheons with the dark essence of Hel, the Death Knights are able to deplete vital energies from those they lash out against. Their ability to discharge this energy over short distances makes this a menacing attack. Although the effects of this spell are abhorrent to the living, the Touch of Darkness is a but a lesser enchantment within the arsenal of these vile horsemen.\nDeath Coil is a particularly potent variation of the Touch of Darkness spell. By channeling the necromantic powers of the underworld through his ghoulish form, the Death Knight creates a field of dark energy that drains the life-force from any who come in contact with it. This life-force is then consumed - thereby replenishing the strength of one so enchanted, be he friend or foe. The icy embrace of death can be beneficial...for those who know how to control it.\nBy magically increasing the speed at which a body generates vital energy, the caster may bestow great speed to any being. All actions taken by one so enchanted are swifter than a common adversary - an advantage that is evident on the battlefield. The effects of Haste can persist for but a short time.\nThis ancient &lt;a href=\"Necromancy\"&gt;Necromantic&lt;/a&gt; spell transforms a portion of the recipient's life force into an unearthly, phantasmal suit of armor. This spectral armor then absorbs the damage from any attack directed at its wearer for a limited amount of time. As the &lt;a href=\"Magic\"&gt;magiks&lt;/a&gt; that link this armor to its host cease, so will the invulnerability that it grants.\nThe aphotic, swirling clouds conjured by the Death Knights can cause anything within their path to rot and decompose. The vapor created by Decay can consume anything - flesh, bone, wood or even the strongest metal. Heavily laden with base substances, these clouds descend and quickly diffuse, leaving only suffering in their wake.\nThis focusing of the winds of the underworld causes any caught within to be cast about with great force and violence. Bones are easily shattered and mainsails are quickly snapped within the torrents of these fierce winds. The howl of these winds allow no commands to be issued to those trapped within the Whirlwind, rendering those unfortunates helpless until the &lt;a href=\"Magic\"&gt;magiks&lt;/a&gt; fade.\nThis dark &lt;a href=\"Magic\"&gt;magik&lt;/a&gt; is the final legacy of the Orc &lt;a href=\"Necrolyte\"&gt;Necrolyte&lt;/a&gt;s who were destroyed shortly after the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;. The Death Knight can animate corpses of the newly dead and then command these monstrosities to attack their enemies. This terrifying spell is the paramount power of the Death Knight as it serves to augment the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; forces with vast armies of &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20%28Warcraft%20II%29\"&gt;the Undead&lt;/a&gt;."}

However, the &lt;a href=\"nightfallen%20rebellion\"&gt;nightfallen rebellion&lt;/a&gt; and the order leaders who had fought on Draenor were able to stop him, and Khadgar returned Illidan's soul to his body. His plan in tatters, Gul'dan was destroyed by the reborn Illidan.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nNo one now living has heard of the village where Gul'dan was born. He was born crippled, weak, and deformed, which made him a target for constant mockery and abuse ever since his childhood. He knew that he was meant for more than his clan would ever allow of him, and he hated them for it. He used the hate and bitterness he felt as a way to keep going. One day, the other clan members grew so tired of the runt's refusal to accept his place in the clan that they beat him repeatedly in an attempt to rid themselves of him once and for all. As the chieftain was about to beat him again, the elderly &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; of the clan stopped him, saying that he had tried and failed to help Gul'dan find his place in the clan. Laying a hand on Gul'dan's shoulder, the elder said, not unkindly, that there was nothing more he could do for him, but that he had always believed there was greatness within him. He then advised the runt to seek out the , for perhaps there he would find his destiny. In response, Gul'dan angrily slapped his hand away. The chieftain then banished Gul'dan to the wastes outside the village, saying that there he would come to understand what it meant to have no people.\nAfter months of starvation and wandering alone through the wastes, Gul'dan began to consider that the safety of a clan might be better than endless suffering. The bitterness that had sustained him all his life ate at him until nothing was left. After barely fighting off a group of giant carrion birds, he collapsed onto the ground. When he awoke, he heeded the old shaman's words and, dragging his body, made his way to the Throne of the Elements, where he offered himself in the service of whatever would end his anguish. In response, the &lt;a href=\"furies\"&gt;spirits&lt;/a&gt; of fire, earth, water, and air erupted from the standing stones and began to swirl around him like rays of light. Just as he was about to touch them, they retreated slightly; Gul'dan, confused, reached further, his expression shifting from pleading to one of fury. As he made one last, violent lunge, the elements, sensing the darkness and fury within the orc's heart, violently recoiled from him, and the ray of light twisted into a tendril of shadow before vanishing. Gul'dan was alone once again as rain began to pour. He let out a furious, anguished cry that echoed throughout the Throne; the elements had abandoned him. A single drop fell from his forehead into the pool of water in which he was kneeling, and in the absence of the furies, &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;other voices&lt;/a&gt; began to whisper. They offered him a gift, and in return, he would become the harbinger of their fury.\nGul'dan eventually returned to his village, draped in tattered robes and his body no longer deformed. When the clan elder and the chieftain spotted him, the latter furiously approached him, saying that Gul'dan was never allowed to return to his people. In reply, Gul'dan roared that he \"had\" no people, before gripping the chieftain's head and causing him to painfully erupt with &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; energy, instantly killing him. Gul'dan then went on a rampage, burning down his village and killing all of his former brethren. As his village burned, Gul'dan spotted the village shaman - the only source of any kindness in his life. Gul'dan approached the horrified shaman and gripped his shoulder, the fel fire encompassing his hand flickering out. Gul'dan earnestly thanked the shaman, who stared at him in shock. Gul'dan simply said that he had found his destiny, then killed the shaman without hesitation. Claiming the shaman's staff and a &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20the%20Scoured%20Clan\"&gt;ring&lt;/a&gt;, Gul'dan left the burning ruins of his birthplace behind forever. Its name and existence would be lost to history - just as the vengeful Gul'dan preferred.\nGul'dan and the Stranger.\nGul'dan sent a message to the orcs promising them untold power. In reply, sent a messenger to Gul'dan wishing to know more about the cruel orc's intent. Gul'dan, undergoing his own transformation after having drunk Mannoroth's blood, replied that he had seen a vision, and &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;a Legion&lt;/a&gt; wanted the orcs as their vanguard. Much to Gul'dan's surprise, the stranger revealed that he knew serving this Legion meant drinking the blood of &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt; and enslaving the orcs to the demons. Angered at the messenger's accusations of slavery, and proclaiming himself to be a god, Gul'dan had his guards remove the messenger from the premises. In response, the messenger slew the guard. Gul'dan told the messenger that in three days the orcs would drink from Mannoroth's blood on a mountaintop and from there march to victory. Lowering his hood, the stranger revealed himself to be &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; and told Gul'dan that in three days Grommash will stand on the mountain as well and lead the orcs to embrace their &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;\"true\" fate&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe blood transformed his visage into something hideous, bent, and twisted by demonic energies. With his lieutenants and those who willingly agreed to join his nefarious cause, he has formed the nefarious .\nWarlords of Draenor.\nGul'dan summoned Mannoroth to , and proceeded to prepare a cauldron full of the pit lord's blood atop the highest peak in &lt;a href=\"Tanaan%20Jungle\"&gt;Tanaan Jungle&lt;/a&gt;, and there offered it to the assembled orcish clans while Mannoroth looked on. of the stepped up to take the first drink, but rejected the offering, refusing to become a slave. Gul'dan became angered by Grommash's disrespect and proceeded to back away as Mannoroth made his presence known. However, Grommash revealed his awareness of the truth of Gul'dan's plot, as his clan suddenly attacked Gul'dan and Mannoroth. In the battle that followed, Mannoroth was trapped by twin harpoons linked with chain and blasted by an &lt;a href=\"iron%20star\"&gt;iron star&lt;/a&gt;, before ultimately meeting his end when Grommash plunged &lt;a href=\"Gorehowl\"&gt;Gorehowl&lt;/a&gt; into his skull. With the Legion's plot foiled, Gul'dan was imprisoned, and the united Iron Horde was revealed. Grommash proclaimed a glorious future for their people, with Gul'dan's original plans to invade &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; repurposed to suit the new Iron Horde.\nAfter the Iron Horde's formation, , &lt;a href=\"Teron%27gor\"&gt;Teron'gor&lt;/a&gt;, and Gul'dan were captured and used to channel souls into the in &lt;a href=\"Tanaan%20Jungle\"&gt;Tanaan Jungle&lt;/a&gt; as ordered by Grommash. &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s freed them in order to destroy the portal and stop the Iron Horde's invasion of Azeroth. While not ideal, Khadgar considered it to be the lesser of two evils due to the urgency of the situation, and planned to make Gul'dan a focal point at a more appropriate time.\nLater, the escaped Gul'dan and members are located by &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cordana%20Felsong\"&gt;Cordana Felsong&lt;/a&gt;. Gul'dan sends Cho'gall to to subjugate , while Teron'gor is to go to and \"bleed them dry.\" Gul'dan flees before he can be captured, but sends to attack Khadgar. In Shadowmoon Valley he attempted to raise a &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; volcano in the center but was stopped.\nWhile Cho'gall is in the process of transforming K'ure into a &lt;a href=\"void%20god\"&gt;void god&lt;/a&gt;, Gul'dan arrives and demands an explanation for Cho'gall's delay in reporting back. Cho'gall claims K'ure's void power for himself and uses void magic to block a punitive attack from his former master. Gul'dan, considering the mad ogre more trouble than he's worth, retreats.\nLegendary quest.\nKhadgar soon returns to searching for Gul'dan via scrying and successfully communicates with him. During this brief period, Gul'dan mentions that he has inquired about his and Khadgar's history, but refuses to give up, revealing that Khadgar's scrying works both ways, allowing Garona to sneak up once again and stab the Archmage in the back, letting the orc to disappear back into the unknown all the while mocking that he wish he was there to enjoy Khadgar's excruciatingly slow death.\nGul'dan later approaches Grommash at Bladefury's Command in Talador, where he mocks the Iron Horde's failures, punctuating the point by revealing Garrosh's death to the Warchief and the fact that Garrosh was his son. The warlock renews his offer of demon blood, but Grommash still refuses and moves to strike Gul'dan down. The latter effortlessly incapacitates Grommash and opens the offer of demon blood to all orcs present, many of whom struggle with the decision of whether or not to accept. Ultimately it's who steps up to drink from the crude chalice, despite Grommash's urgent warnings. Once Kilrogg drinks the demon blood he quickly mutates into a &lt;a href=\"fel%20orc\"&gt;fel orc&lt;/a&gt; and Gul'dan takes control of the Iron Horde, posing an even greater threat to both Draenor and Azeroth than ever before.\nFury of Hellfire.\nGul'dan has Grommash brought to the , the site where Mannoroth had been felled. Gul'dan expresses disappointment in Grommash, disgusted that Grommash had taken the path of steel and powder over the power offered by the Burning Legion. Looking over the completed Hellfire Citadel, Gul'dan unleashes the &lt;a href=\"The%20Felblight\"&gt;Felblight&lt;/a&gt;, a river of &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; sludge twisting and corrupting all that it touches and warping the Citadel. Grommash growls that the Horde and Alliance will oppose Gul'dan and his demonic masters, and will emerge victorious, but Gul'dan chuckles and shrugs him off, confident that all shall serve the Legion.\nGul'dan offered the rest of the Iron Horde the demonic corruption. Few of them spoke against him and he had them arrested, &lt;a href=\"Solog%20Roark\"&gt;Solog Roark&lt;/a&gt; among them. He commanded the orcs to regroup to Tanaan. The orcs left the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Foundry\"&gt;Blackrock Foundry&lt;/a&gt; and from the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Docks\"&gt;Iron Docks&lt;/a&gt; traveled to the Jungle. He also summoned his old allies and gained new ones. He had the Sargerei locate Teron'gor in Auchindoun and enlisted the help of Kilrogg and his Bleeding Hollow orcs as well as the cursed and high arakkoa now led by &lt;a href=\"Shadow-Sage%20Iskar\"&gt;Iskar&lt;/a&gt;. Though Kilrogg was unsuccessful in his mission, Iskar managed to locate the Cipher of Damnation and thus the warlock rewarded Iskar and his followers with wings and allowed them to join his army. He also sent a few of his warlock to the site of the Dark Portal to clear its ruin. The orcs discovered that a small piece of portal's magic is still there. After the draenei, Frostwolf orcs with the Horde and Alliance began their counter-attack and throughout the Jungle they began thwarting Gul'dan's minions. At some point, Gul'dan sensed that he and Kilrogg were watched and he sent an Eye of Kilrogg against them.\nDuring the events of the &lt;a href=\"Garrison%20Campaign\"&gt;Garrison Campaign&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Tanaan%20Jungle\"&gt;Tanaan Jungle&lt;/a&gt;, Gul'dan finds the &lt;a href=\"Cipher%20of%20Damnation\"&gt;Cipher of Damnation&lt;/a&gt;, an item capable of severing the connection between and the &lt;a href=\"furies\"&gt;elements&lt;/a&gt; and which is kept hidden by the &lt;a href=\"Guardians%20of%20the%20Vault\"&gt;Guardians of the Vault&lt;/a&gt;. He sends his to massacre the Guardians and claims the Cipher for himself, later using it to drive the elemental lord &lt;a href=\"Cyrukh\"&gt;Cyrukh&lt;/a&gt; insane. Before Cyrukh can be unleashed to ravage Draenor, Gul'dan's plains are foiled by the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;commander&lt;/a&gt; and the former Shadow Council member .\nAs the new leader of the Iron Horde, he also gained control of the rest of the Iron Horde ships. The warlock sent his ships across Draenor's seas in order to map ley lines. His enemy, Archmage Khadgar discovered this and he had the warlock's ships destroyed and the ley lines map recovered. The Archmage also sent the adventurers to retrieve Gul'dan's tomes. Even though Gul'dan's plans were thwarted, he gained another ally: &lt;a href=\"Cordana%20Felsong\"&gt;Cordana Felsong&lt;/a&gt;. The Warden had intended to destroy the &lt;a href=\"Orb%20of%20Dominion\"&gt;Orb of Dominion&lt;/a&gt; that had been used to free Garona from the will of the Shadow Council, but through the Orb, Gul'dan fed on her doubts and misgivings with Khadgar to corrupt her from afar. She ultimately attempted to strike down the adventurers but fled upon defeat.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s' assault upon Hellfire Citadel, most of his allies are killed. Gul'dan resurrects and empowers &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt; but the pit lord is also killed. He then is able to successfully summon &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; the Defiler from the Black Gate. As the eredar battles his enemies, Gul'dan continues to summon demons. When Archimonde is defeated, the &lt;a href=\"eredar\"&gt;eredar&lt;/a&gt; yells with his final breath that Gul'dan \"made a pact\" and proceeds to shoot a beam of fel energy at the orc, sending him into the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Gate\"&gt;Black Gate&lt;/a&gt; and destroying it. His pact with the Legion was far from being fulfilled.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; walks up to the crashed remnants of the portal, he looks down on the ground and notices Gul'dan's staff, which evaporates before his eyes. Khadgar then states to &lt;a href=\"Yrel\"&gt;Yrel&lt;/a&gt; that Gul'dan, and the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;devils&lt;/a&gt; who command him, are not so easily banished and that he fears that \"this is only beginning\".\nThe Tomb of Sargeras.\nThough his plans failed, Gul'dan survived. Under the Legion's command, he was banished to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; to open a gateway for a monstrous invasion force unlike anything the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; have ever faced. After being flung through the Black Gate, Gul'dan heard the familiar voice of &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;, who gifted the warlock with the endless knowledge of the Legion and ordered him to travel to the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter arriving on Azeroth, Gul'dan stole a &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeronian&lt;/a&gt; merchant vessel and sailed across an unfamiliar ocean, all while being pursued by Khadgar. By the time the archmage had caught up with the ship, Gul'dan had killed every adult on board and stacked their shriveled corpses on deck while keeping the children lined up as a living shield against the archmage. Then, with a single spark of fel fire, Gul'dan burned the ship and everyone on it, causing Khadgar to lose track of him.\nThough the Legion had granted him much power, the warlock's mortal body was still twisted and weak, and the effort of swimming to shore nearly killed him and seemingly caused him to fall unconscious until a lone &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen\"&gt;Nightfallen&lt;/a&gt; attempted to drain his magical energies. In response, the orc killed the elf and several of its nearby brethren before taking a moment to rest. The voice of Kil'jaeden, which had filled his mind since the instant he entered Azeroth and had not given him even a moment's respite, reminded him that he had no time to spare and that he had to keep moving. When the eredar began to question the warlock's loyalty to the Legion, Gul'dan angrily responded that he had proved his loyalty a thousand times over, to which his master simply replied that he had failed again and again and had proved nothing.\nHiding his thoughts from his master, Gul'dan thought to himself that it was the Legion \u2014 not him \u2014 who had failed on Draenor, before quietly wondering why things should go differently this time. Nevertheless, he obeyed Kil'jaeden's command and began heading north, all the while asking questions about what he was searching for and about the fate of \"&lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;the other one&lt;/a&gt;\" \u2014 the Gul'dan who had journeyed to Azeroth during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, raised the island of &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Thal'dranath&lt;/a&gt; from the sea but had eventually died there. Kil'jaeden simply told him that Gul'dan was there to visit Thal'dranath again, not ask questions, but eventually let on the name of Gul'dan's destination: the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;. At that moment, Gul'dan noticed someone approaching and quickly concealed himself behind a shroud of fel power. A lone &lt;a href=\"Watchers\"&gt;Watcher&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 one of the elite jailers and marshals of &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; society \u2014 emerged from among the rocks and began searching for something while heading north. Gul'dan followed.\nSoon, Gul'dan had followed the Watcher to a plateau where several of her kind were already waiting under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;. The orc overheard parts of their conversation and began preparing for a deadly ambush, when Kil'jaeden's voice suddenly thundered through his mind: \"HIDE\", and Gul'dan soon saw why. In the form of a raven, Archmage Khadgar swooped down on the plateau and began talking to Maiev. Gul'dan argued that he should end the archmage when he had the chance, but Kil'jaeden replied that they were irrelevant and that the warlock had to move east and cross the bay \u2014 he no longer had time to walk around all of &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt;. Gul'dan thought to himself that he had agreed to be a servant, not a puppet, and considered treason for a moment before ultimately deciding on playing the part of the obedient pet and returned to the eastern shoreline to find a small &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; rowboat. Within an hour, using Kil'jaeden's directions and fel magic to move quickly across the water, Gul'dan had reached the island that his other self had raised from the ocean depths many years prior. With ease, he dismantled the &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; locks and barriers blocking the entrance into the Tomb of Sargeras before blasting the door open and swiftly plunging into the darkness.\nShortly thereafter, Khadgar entered the tomb as well after hearing the massive blast caused by the door's destruction. After evading several of the deadly magical traps laid by Gul'dan, the mage confronted the warlock in a towering chamber, and a furious battle erupted. Colossal waves of arcane and fel crashed together, threatening to ignite the air around the two combatants. Kil'jaeden's voice angrily told Gul'dan that neither of the two could die this day and that he had to withdraw. Realizing that if he did not obey, he would get cut off from the Legion immediately, the warlock shrouded himself in fel, causing Khadgar's arcane magic to unleash a blinding explosion. When he had opened his eyes again, Gul'dan was gone. A deadly cat-and-mouse game ensued, with Khadgar taunting Gul'dan in an attempt to bring him out of hiding while launching blasts of fire at random into the darkness.\nAfter a lucky shot almost reduced him to cinders, Gul'dan convinced Kil'jaeden to tell him about the power locked in the tomb and how to unleash it. Then, using this knowledge, he began deactivating the five arcane seals that had been created in the tomb by the &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; of Suramar during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; using the five &lt;a href=\"Pillars%20of%20Creation\"&gt;Pillars of Creation&lt;/a&gt;. Khadgar noticed this attempt and began sending out &lt;a href=\"arcane%20elemental\"&gt;arcane elemental&lt;/a&gt;s to find the warlock while also starting to ask if the orc had ever learned of the fate of his main universe counterpart. Gul'dan ignored him, continuing to break the seals until he reached the fifth and final one, which had begun growing more powerful with each passing moment, arcane energy surging into it \u2014 a mechanism created hundreds of years ago by &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;a female Guardian of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt;. Khadgar sensed this and created a massive arcane wedge and began slamming it into the floor of the chamber. Gul'dan threw his concealing illusion aside, and the battle between the mage and the warlock erupted once again. Realizing that he could not kill Khadgar \"and\" break the last seal at the same time, Gul'dan attempted to convince Kil'jaeden to infuse him with the tomb's power, while Khadgar finished his story and revealed the fate of the original timeline's Gul'dan: having been torn apart by the demons he had once served. Gul'dan suddenly realized that he was guaranteed to outlive his usefulness in the Legion's eyes, but in that moment, Kil'jaeden conceded and allowed the energies of the tomb to surge into the orc.\nGul'dan immediately ceased his attack upon Khadgar, instead crushing the final seal in a fist of fel fire. The energies necessary to tear open a rift between Azeroth and the Nether began surging towards the portal buried below Thal'dranath, but Gul'dan seized them for himself. After a moment of drowning in pain beneath an endless ocean of power, he regained his control and, by lifting only a finger, caused the chamber to erupt with overwhelming fury. Khadgar managed to seal himself in ice once more, but Gul'dan simply hurled the ice block through a doorway before collapsing tons of rock on top of it, blocking the entrance. Kil'jaeden instructed Gul'dan to allow the power to flow to the portal. Gul'dan, relishing this act of defiance, refused.\nGul'dan used his new power to reach through his demonic link and speak face to face with his master, sitting on a throne in some distant world within the Nether. Gul'dan accused him of planning to discard the orc from the beginning. Kil'jaeden denied this, having invested too much into Gul'dan. He explained that the original Gul'dan died because his betrayal is what sealed the defeat of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;first Horde&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 and by extension, Kil'jaeden and the Legion \u2014 on Azeroth during the Second War. When Gul'dan angrily replied that that was not him, Kil'jaeden told him that betrayal was in his nature. Seeing great potential within the orc, however, buried beneath a short-sighted selfishness, the eredar had dragged Gul'dan to Thal'dranath to lead him to even greater power. The eredar then went on to explain that while Gul'dan had always been destined for power, he would never be his own master; that every creature served a master, &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;even the Deceiver&lt;/a&gt;. Then, he gave the warlock a choice: prove himself loyal, return his power to the portal and open the way for the Legion, or betray his masters yet again to exact his petty vengeance on insignificant mortals before the Legion destroyed him. He left with a closing thought: Gul'dan may call him 'the Deceiver', but Kil'jaeden stated that he had never lied to him. \"Not once. Not in &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;this world&lt;/a&gt;, and not in .\"\nGul'dan was finally alone in the chamber. Though he felt certain in his decision, he also felt a speck of self-doubt growing inside him. Soon, he heard Khadgar, now joined by Maiev Shadowsong, trying to claw their way into the chamber. The warlock thought to himself that if they wanted to rush to their deaths, they were free to do so, but in that moment, Gul'dan realized where his insecurity was coming from. Khadgar had been utterly defeated, yet he was not giving up. Maiev could not stand the archmage, but was now risking her life to save him. Gul'dan remembered &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;the others&lt;/a&gt; who had rushed headlong into battle against the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt; and even &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; himself, and realized that he would have to face every single one of them alone, albeit without a master. Khadgar and Maiev breached the chamber and ran towards Gul'dan. With no effort, he brushed their attacks away again and again, yet they kept coming at him. The warlock thought to himself that their stubborn resistance was exactly what he would have to face over and over again; he had no measure of his new power, but he had a measure of theirs. Finally, reluctantly, he let his power slip away from him and down towards the portal, at last allowing the Burning Legion's third invasion of Azeroth to commence. As Khadgar and Maiev dropped to the floor, Kil'jaeden commended Gul'dan for his choice, and now Gul'dan had something he had never had from the Legion before: their trust.\nKhadgar and Maiev ran for their lives, with the Warden heading north to fortify the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20the%20Wardens\"&gt;Vault of the Wardens&lt;/a&gt; and Khadgar transforming into a raven to fly east. As the archmage glanced back towards the ever-darkening sky above the tomb, he saw Gul'dan levitating in the middle of the inferno, laughing and pointing towards the fleeing archmage to order several demons to pursue him.\nTwilight of Suramar.\nSome time after Gul'dan's arrival on Azeroth, the &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt; city of &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt; came under attack by the Legion. Gul'dan appeared before &lt;a href=\"Elisande\"&gt;Grand Magistrix Elisande&lt;/a&gt; and her advisors, giving them a simple choice: bring down the protective barrier around the city, grant him access to the Nightwell and live as honored allies of the Legion; or be destroyed like the rest of Azeroth, since the barrier was bound to fall regardless. After giving his offer, Gul'dan disappeared, saying that if the barrier was not down after three days, he would know the elves' answer. Elisande and her advisors eventually decided to accept the Legion's offer, bringing down the barrier and exposing their city to the demons they had once fought against. As &lt;a href=\"doomguard\"&gt;doomguard&lt;/a&gt; swarmed into the city, Gul'dan told Elisande that the end of the nightborne's long seclusion should not be a concern, for with every ending comes the opportunity for a new beginning.\nLegion.\n\"Gul'dan owes allegiance to no one save his &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; masters. On Draenor, the power-hungry orc warlock nearly had his entire race enslaved to demons. Though his plans failed, Gul'dan survived. Under the Legion\u2019s command, he was banished to Azeroth to open a gateway for a monstrous invasion force unlike anything the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; have ever faced.\"\nWith the help of the corrupted warden &lt;a href=\"Cordana%20Felsong\"&gt;Cordana Felsong&lt;/a&gt;, Gul'dan was able to breach the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20the%20Wardens\"&gt;Vault of the Wardens&lt;/a&gt;. Inside it, Gul'dan found the corpse of &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, who was brought there after his death at the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; so his soul would continue to serve his eternal sentence. Gul'dan took Illidan's body to &lt;a href=\"Black%20Rook%20Hold\"&gt;Black Rook Hold&lt;/a&gt; and conducted a ritual to separate his soul from his body. This energy brought the souls of the Ravencrest clan back to their ancestral home. Gul'dan then raised the dead night elves to protect the secrets within the tower. These undead cannot see the living for what they truly are and believe them to be demons as they eternally relive the horrors of the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;.\nSeeing that the portal opened by Gul'dan in the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; enabled the might of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; to cross through into &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, the heroes of Azeroth gathered their forces and rode to the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt; in a joint faction fleet to combat the threat. However, this was planned out according to falsified information: the Legion, having far more numbers than such an attack could handle, intercepted the reconnaissance team sent to survey the Broken Shore, and allowed the attack to happen in order to draw in the joint fleets as a trap. During the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for the Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, Gul'dan's vast army of demons were able to overwhelm the initial invasion of Azeroth's defenders and forced them to withdraw. Many heroes died in battle or from sustained mortal wounds, and Gul'dan himself executed King &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; in the aftermath of the failed assault with &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; fire. It is likely that the &lt;a href=\"Lionshead%20Lapel%20Clasp\"&gt;Lionshead Lapel Clasp&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Warchief%27s%20Shattered%20Tusk\"&gt;Warchief's Shattered Tusk&lt;/a&gt; are related to him and &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt;, collected as trophies by Gul'dan following the battle.\nGul'dan rallied the members of the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt; who have been in hiding across Azeroth and sends them to retrieve the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Dalaran\"&gt;Eye of Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Tol%20Barad\"&gt;Tol Barad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Medivh\"&gt;Book of Medivh&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Scholomance\"&gt;Scholomance&lt;/a&gt;, while he obtains the &lt;a href=\"Scepter%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Scepter of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;. With all three, Gul'dan intends to open various rifts to summon more demons in addition to the portal within the Tomb of Sargeras. At the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, Gul'dan travels to &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt; to stabilize the ritual on that end but a warlock adventurer, pretending to have defected to the Legion's side, steals the Scepter of Sargeras and disrupts the ritual.\n&lt;a href=\"Xe%27ra\"&gt;Xe'ra&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt; speculate that Gul'dan struck a deal with &lt;a href=\"Helya\"&gt;Helya&lt;/a&gt; for her to steal Illidan's soul out of the Twisting Nether when Illidan's soul is found by them in &lt;a href=\"Helheim\"&gt;Helheim&lt;/a&gt;. This is reinforced by the fact that Gul'dan's staff has a deep connection to the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt; and Helya's willingness to make deals with outsiders if they benefit her.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt;, Gul'dan works to put a portion of his master's soul, Sargeras, inside &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;'s body at the &lt;a href=\"Nightwell\"&gt;Nightwell&lt;/a&gt; under the eye of &lt;a href=\"Tichondrius\"&gt;Tichondrius&lt;/a&gt;. He is the final boss of the &lt;a href=\"Nighthold%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Nighthold&lt;/a&gt;. When the adventurers confront Gul'dan at the pinnacle of the palace, he summons a number of powerful demons to stall them while he works to begin channeling Sargeras' power into Illidan's body. Once the ritual begins, Gul'dan decides to indulge himself by crushing the adventurers personally, bolsters his weak frame with fel and directly assaults the adventurers. Despite his great newfound power, the heroes begin to overpower him; out of desperation, Gul'dan resorts to opening an immense rift to the Twisting Nether and further empowering himself. As &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; uses the Pillars of Creation and Light's Heart to put Illidan's soul back inside his body, Sargeras takes control of the body and &lt;a href=\"The%20Demon%20Within\"&gt;The Demon Within&lt;/a&gt; reveals itself.\nAfter the Demon Within's vanquished, Gul'dan's defeat causes him to lose his newfound powers and sends him sprawling to the ground, reverting to his original, frail form. \nThe portal begins fluctuating, a pulse of energy sending the suspended, crystalline prison of Illidan crashing into a nearby statue. Gul'dan roars in horror as the portal flickers and dies. In a mirror of his abandonment at the Throne of the Elements, Gul'dan is left kneeling, staring at his hands, alone.\nA pair of black wings unfurl behind him; Gul'dan slowly turns around only to have a black hand seize him by the throat. Illidan Stormrage raises Gul'dan up and begins flooding him with fel magic. Gul'dan screams in agony until, much like Varian Wrynn, he explodes in a flash of fel energy. All that remains of Darkness Incarnate is his &lt;a href=\"Skull%20of%20Gul%27dan\"&gt;skull&lt;/a&gt; in Illidan's hand, which Illidan stares at for a second before crushing.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nAn &lt;a href=\"Echo%20of%20Gul%27dan\"&gt;Echo of Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; is faced at the Dark Portal by &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s seeking to attune a shard of the &lt;a href=\"Vision%20of%20Time\"&gt;Vision of Time&lt;/a&gt; to as part of &lt;a href=\"Mag%27har%20orc%20%28playable%29\"&gt;Mag'har orcs&lt;/a&gt; unlock questline.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

By the time he sought out to recruit the &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20clan%20%28film%20universe%29\"&gt;Frostwolf clan&lt;/a&gt;, he already had the backing of the &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20clan%20%28film%20universe%29\"&gt;Warsong&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bleeding%20Hollow%20clan%20%28film%20universe%29\"&gt;Bleeding Hollow&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Laughing%20Skull%20clan%20%28film%20universe%29\"&gt;Laughing Skull&lt;/a&gt; clans and had been rejected by the &lt;a href=\"Redwalker%20clan%20%28film%20universe%29\"&gt;Redwalker clan&lt;/a&gt;.\nBy invoking the right of parlay Gul'dan was granted safe passage and an opportunity to speak the Frostwolves Chieftain &lt;a href=\"Garad%20%28film%20universe%29\"&gt;Garad&lt;/a&gt;. However Garad would be unmoved and refuse to join the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20%28film%20universe%29\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and ended the parlay. In accordance with parlay tradition Gul'dan would give him a ceremonial dagger as a gift, but unknown to all the blade was poisoned. Sometime after Gul'dan departure the Frostwolves and Redwalkers would clash in battle and in his final moments the weakened Garad would realize that Gul'dan was responsible.\nGul'dan, after two years, would try to once again to gain Frostwolf support for the Horde and &lt;a href=\"Durotan%20%28film%20universe%29\"&gt;Durotan&lt;/a&gt; would be greatly tempted to join. However he ultimately rejected convinced that doing so would make them the warlock's slaves. A surprised &lt;a href=\"Garona%20Halforcen%20%28film%20universe%29\"&gt;Garona&lt;/a&gt; would use the draenei tongue to warn them that Gul'dan was dangerous, and &lt;a href=\"Draka%20%28film%20universe%29\"&gt;Draka&lt;/a&gt; (who had learned the tongue in her exile) reformed her that they knew, though when Gul'dan demanded to know what was said Draka informed that warlock that Garona had called them fools. Accepting this Gul'dan then called Durotan stubborn but remarked that should he see wisdom and change his mind all he had to was head to Tanaan Jungle. The Frostwolves would march south where they were accepted into the Horde.\nWarcraft.\nGul'dan prepared for the opening of the to allow the Orcs into Azeroth. Joined by the Frostwolf clan; Gul'dan used the life energy of captured Draenei to open the Dark Portal and led the Horde into the Azeroth by way of the Black Morass. After the trip from Draenor sent Draka into labor, the warlock used his fel magic to save the stillborn child, the future warchief Thrall, and declared the child another warrior for the Horde. Gul'dan then set about preparing another portal, one that could bring the entire orcish army through to Azeroth, and gathered human peasants from the towns surrounding Stormwind as fuel. After Blackhand fled from a failed attack on Lothar, Medivh and Khadgar, Gul'dan rebuked him and told him that the price for cowardice and failure is death. As Backhand prepared to meet his fate, Durotan saved him, and Gul'dan became suspicious of the Frostwolves and their growing wariness of the Horde. \nAfter Orgim betrayed Durotan at the secret meeting with King Llane, Gul'dan promised that the leadership of the Frostwolves would pass to him. However, after Orgrim backed out of the deal, Gul'dan began a massacre of the remaining Frostwolves, and Durotan retaliated by challenging him to a \"mak'gora\", or honor duel. After Durotan gained the upper hand, Gul'dan began to cheat, and eventually killed the Frostwolf chieftain. Disgusted by the warlock's lack of honor, the other members of the Horde began to leave, but Gul'dan killed several of them and forced the fel magic onto Blackhand, turning him into a mindless, hulking beast. Gul'dan then turned his attention to the newly-built portal, and began to summon the remaining Horde forces to Azeroth. However, a timely defeat of Medivh by Lothar and Khadgar closed the draeneic portal, and allowed the Stormwind forces to usher the captured peasants back through another portal, summoned by a no-longer-possessed Medivh, using the very last of his life. After Garona murders King Llane, Gul'dan was there to welcome her, as an equal, into the Horde. \nLothar arrives to recover his king's body (noticing the dagger he'd given to Garona in Llane's neck) before he is knocked unconcious. Coming to, he is challenged to \"mak'gora\" by Blackhand. Gul'dan witnesses the death of Blackhand at Lothar's blade and bitterly commands the Horde to kill him. They refuse, honoring Lothar and allowing him to leave with his king's body, ignoring Gul'dans angry demands that Lother be killed. He initially ignores Garona's words that Lothar won fair and square and moves to kill the warrior himself. The Horde warriors bar his way, allowing Lothar to leave, to Gul'dan's fury until Garona convinces him that if he breaks the honor of \"mak'gora\" (especially after he cheated to defeat Durotan) he will lose his sway over the Horde. Angered but realizing Garona is right, he snorts and turns away as Lothar leaves astride his gryphon with Llane's body. \nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

For the first two phases, the players wield powers granted to them by the Eye of Aman'thul depending on their spec/role, similar to the &lt;a href=\"Ultraxion\"&gt;Ultraxion&lt;/a&gt; fight in &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt;. Gul'dan gets rid of these powers at 40%. \nOn mythic, Gul'dan will skip phase 1 and have an additional phase at 10%, with the players fighting &lt;a href=\"The%20Demon%20Within\"&gt;The Demon Within&lt;/a&gt;, Sargeras' demonic soul within Illidan's body. \nAdventure Guide.\n\"The chain of events set in motion when &lt;a href=\"Garrosh\"&gt;Garrosh&lt;/a&gt; escaped to has continued, unbroken for all its twists and turns, leading to this very moment. Thwarted in Draenor, Gul'dan now stands on the precipice of achieving ultimate victory on behalf of his Legion masters. Standing atop the Nighthold, as the vortex of fel energy swirls in the skies overhead, the outcast orc warlock awaits his destiny.\"\nOverview.\nGul'dan begins a ritual to bring his master into Azeroth, locking himself inside the active Eye of Aman'Thul and summoning his demonic lieutenants. However, proximity to the active Eye of Aman'Thul bestows equally powerful abilities to players, based on their role. After his lieutenants fall, Gul'dan leaps into the fray himself, harnessing the power of the Fel to bolster his frail frame. At 85%, 70%, and 55% health, Gul'dan again taps into the active Eye of Aman'Thul, empowering his abilities. As his health dwindles further, Gul'dan beseeches his Legion masters for additional power, unleashing his ultimate strength while disrupting the aid that players receive from the Eye.\nAbilities.\nStage One: The Council of Elders.\nGul'dan locks himself inside the active Eye of Aman'Thul, summoning his demonic lieutenants. However, proximity to the active Eye of Aman'thul bestows equally powerful abilities to players, based on their role.\nStage Two: The Ritual of Aman'Thul.\nGul'dan leaps into the fray himself, harnessing the power of the Fel to bolster his frail frame. At 85%, 70%, and 55% health, Gul'dan again taps into the active Eye of Aman'Thul, expanding the potency of his abilities.\nStage Three: The Master's Power.\nAt 40% health Gul'dan harnesses the Eye of Aman'Thul to gain new and empowered abilities, also disrupting the powers that players received from the Eye.\nStage One: The Ritual of Aman'Thul.\nGul'dan, taking no chances, leaps into the fray, harnessing the power of the Fel to bolster his frail frame, periodically summoning his demonic lieutenants and utilizing the active Eye of Aman'Thul, expanding the potency of his abilities.\nStage Two: The Master's Power.\nAt 50% health Gul'dan harnesses the Eye of Aman'Thul to gain new and empowered abilities, also disrupting the powers that players received from the Eye.\nStage Three: The Demon Within.\nWhen Gul'dan reaches 10% health remaining. Archmage Khadgar attempts to return Illidan's soul to his dormant body. Unbeknownst to Khadgar a dark, outworldly presence was filling Illidan's mortal shell, and the consequences of Khadgar's actions incite deadly consequences...\nStrategy.\nFor this fight, the group should have two tanks, a mixed DPS composition, and 3-4 healers. Due to the amount of damage going out during the last two phases, groups killing Gul'dan for their first time should consider taking 4 healers if damage from Empowered of Eye Gul'dan proves too much. &lt;a href=\"Bloodlust\"&gt;Bloodlust&lt;/a&gt; should also be saved for the last phase. In the first phase, the raid should be positioned on a single half of the arena, so as not to lose line of sight of healers, but spread out enough to dodge the boss's abilites. In the second half, the tanks and melee dps will be at the center of the room (on the Eye of Aman'thul) while the ranged players are 10-15 yards away in a group to allow the healers to shield them from Liquid Hellfire. In the last phase, Gul'dan will be tanked near the edge so that players can easily drop their lava near the edge instead of in the group. \nRole-specific.\nTanks: Gul'dan's energy bar will slowly build. When it hits 100%, he will one-shot the tank. Having the two tanks in-front of him will cause him to use Fel Scythe for lower damage and keep his energy low. However, if the tanks cause Fel Scythe to cast too often, Gul'dan will gain a stacking haste buff which will cause his energy to climb faster, eventually overwhelming the tanks. To counter this, a single tank should stand in-front of Gul'dan and the other tank should quickly move in next to their fellow tank to soak the Fel Scythe when he reaches 20-30% energy. This will keep the energy down and the deny the stacking buff. In a pinch, tanks can use their extra action button to activate the Eye of Aman'thul's shield, making them temporarily impervious to damage. \nHealers: The Eye grants the ability to create a 10-yard shield around the player that absorbs all damage for 6 seconds. This ability is vital to the group taking minimum damage from Gul'dan's deadly Liquid Hellfire attack. However, the cast is instant and lasts for 6 seconds while the healer is still, while Gul'dan's Liquid Hellfire has an 8 second cast. Timing is key to prevent the group from taking massive damage. \nDPS: Damage-dealing classes gain the ability to warp time, like a miniature, more powerful Bloodlust effect. Relative time increases by 30%, increasing casting, movement, and attack speed by 30% as well as decreasing cooldowns by 30% and periodic effects occur 30% faster. This unique effect benefits all DPS classes, even those who focus on damage-over-time effects. DPS must be careful as this effect can be taken off by several of Gul'dan's spells. Fel Efflux in phase 1, Empowered Eye of Gul'dan, and Liquid Hellfire in phases 2 and 3, as well as the lava it lays down. The healer's damage shield will not keep players from losing their buff, so they must be careful and gauge ability-timers in DBM to maximize the amount of time they keep their haste buff. \nPhase 1.\nDPS will only have about 10 seconds to hurt Gul'dan before he shuts himself within the Eye of Aman'thul and begins summoning 3 demonic lieutenants to battle the raid: a fel-lord, an inquisitor, and a trapper. While in the eye, he will cast Fel Efflux, a large beam of fel-fire that will rapidly kill players standing within it, just move away. Once they are summoned, all DPS should switch to the inquisitor. After a period of time, it will start summoning eyes that shoot spinning laser beams that both hurt and knock-back players. After too long, the eyes will fill up the arena and make it very hard to dodge Gul'dan's Fel Efflux attack, potentially even knocking players off the platform to their deaths. Kill the inquisitor, then the fel-lord, as their powerful attacks may force tanks to use cooldowns early on. The trapper is not as much of a threat. He will throw a cage down on the floor and hurt anyone caught inside the vortex pulling. Simply move away and kill the trapper. Movement speed increases like &lt;a href=\"Stampeding%20Roar\"&gt;Stampeding Roar&lt;/a&gt; trivialize this ability.\nPhase 2.\nGul'dan exits the Eye and confronts the party directly. This phase is split into 3 mini-phases, where he taps into the Eye to empower one of his abilities at 85%, 70%, and 55%. After the last of these, all his abilities will be empowered and do Fire-damage, cancelling the Eye's DPS affect if they are hit by any of them.\nHe will begin summoning Eyes of Gul'dan, small &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Kilrogg\"&gt;Eye of Kilrogg&lt;/a&gt; that fire beams at random players. He initially summons 3 at a time, but if not killed fast enough, they will duplicate and create more. These duplicated eyes have the exact same amount of health that the original had when it finished the cast. Hence, an eye that duplicates at 10% health will create a duplicate with 10% health. The eyes will also move around at high speed when not casting, so high-mobility DPS with good burst are great at taking down these eyes, such as demon hunters. The eyes must always be prioritized, as too many up at once may cause a wipe. After becoming empowered, he will instead summon one large eye that does a massive amount of channeled fire damage to multiple targets. The other abilities of the eye remain the same.\nBonds of Gul'dan binds 3-4 players to the floor and creates a small circle around them. After moving a certain distance from that spot, the chains will break and cause high damage to anyone within 5 yards of the freed player, split evenly. If no one shares the bonded player's space when the chain is broken and they are not a tank, they will most likely be one-shot. If one cannot immunity their way out of the bonds, ideally 2-3 players should be positioned on the player when they break their chains, making the damage relatively minor. When empowered, the bonds will force a player back away from Gul'dan. If stood near the edge, this has a very real chance of knocking the player off the edge with no way to recover. Thus, Gul'dan should be placed at the center of the arena and the ranged players standing about 10 feet away, so that they can be safe from empowered bonds and can quickly run inside of the healer's shield to protect from Liquid Hellfire. Empowered Liquid Hellfire will also leave lava on the ground, simply move away. \nPhase 3.\nAt 40%, Gul'dan will teleport back inside of the Eye and become invincible, giving the party a brief respite while Khadgar uses the &lt;a href=\"Pillars%20of%20Creation\"&gt;Pillars of Creation&lt;/a&gt; to return Illidan's soul to his body. All raid members should hug the Eye to prevent falling off because Gul'dan will knock everyone back a ways when he finishes empowering himself. As this last phase begins, all players will lose their Eye abilities. Keep to the center to keep the 5-second winds from knocking players off the edge and then move towards the edge of the arena once it is safe. Instead of Liquid Hellfire, Gul'dan will instead affect several players with Flames of Sargeras, causing them to take damage and leave large spots of lava along the ground. Try to drop them close to the edge and away from people. He will stop casting Bonds, but continue creating Empowered eyes which need to be focused down. \nHis next big ability is Well of Souls. He will conjure the well at the center of the arena, where white souls will begin swirhling around inside. If any souls are within the well when Gul'dan casts Black Harvest, the raid will be taking additional shadow damage. More than 1 soul within the well during Black Harvest will cause a wipe. Ranged players need to stand within the well for 3 seconds to absorb a soul, taking damage in the process, but denying Black Harvest bonus damage. Different players must absorb the souls each time until the previous players' debuff (Soul Corrosion) wears off. \nFinally, Gul'dan will use Storm of the Destroyer. This massive 1-hit-KO ability covers about 60% of the arena in shadow, killing anyone caught inside. Khadgar will give everyone a speed buff to get to the other side of the platform and avoid it. The first time Gul'dan casts this, he will teleport to the other side and immedietly attack the tanks. The second, he will run across the arena and cast Eye of Gul'dan in the center of the arena. If he is not dead by then, then he will cast a third Storm of the Destroyer, teleport to the tanks, and berserk soon after. \nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

Like all other weapons and armor, they can be:\nThere are also different ways to improve your gun:\nIn-game history.\nDifferent things related to guns have changed since World of Warcraft began:\nTraining.\nBefore &lt;a href=\"patch%204.0.1\"&gt;patch 4.0.1&lt;/a&gt;, only &lt;a href=\"Dwarf%20%28playable%29\"&gt;dwarf&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tauren%20%28playable%29\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s started with the gun skill. All other hunters, &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s had to learn the gun skill from trainers (see &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20master\"&gt;weapon trainers&lt;/a&gt; for details).\n&lt;a href=\"Dwarf%20%28playable%29\"&gt;Dwarves&lt;/a&gt; have a racial trait that improves their ability to use guns - Gun Specialization: \"Increase Gun Critical Hit chance by 1%\"\nAmmo.\nPrior to patch 4.0.1, players also required &lt;a href=\"bullet\"&gt;bullet&lt;/a&gt;s (an item type) to fire their guns. The patch removed the need for ammunition, which also removed arrows from bows and crossbows. Now, guns will endlessly fire and only stop firing when they break.\nAmmo Pouches.\nAn &lt;a href=\"Ammo%20Pouch\"&gt;Ammo Pouch&lt;/a&gt; was previously a type of &lt;a href=\"bag\"&gt;bag&lt;/a&gt;-item which held only bullets. Bullets could be stored both in ammo pouches or in regular bags, but the pouches usually had more inventory slots than regular bags. With the removal of ammunition in patch 4.0.1, ammo pouches were also removed from the game (they were no longer craftable, and any existing ones were converted into normal bags).\nIn the RPG.\nFirearms are a relatively new dwarven invention. Despite the dangers of dealing with volatile explosives, dwarves are fascinated by the possibilities. Dwarven gunmakers constantly tinker with the guns they craft, trying out new designs and upgrades, naming and decorating their weapons.\nGun Types.\nThis basic firearm deals damage to anyone in a 5-foot wide path beyond that distance, out to maximum range. It holds a single shot and thereafter it is required to reload for another shot.\nA flintlock pistol is powerful but inaccurate, not so much a small version of the long rifle as it is like firing a bomb though a short tube. It holds a single shot and thereafter it is required to reload for another shot.\nThe king of small arms, a long rifle is nearly as long as a dwarf is tall. Thanks to the innovative barrel design, a skilled sharpshooter can use the long rifle to knock an apple of an orc\u2019s head from nearly half a mile away \u2013 assuming the &lt;a href=\"rifleman\"&gt;rifleman&lt;/a&gt; can resist the urge to shoot the orc instead.

The wild deities are now considered a source of untapped power, their potent blood providing the means to repel the Lich King's minions, who have overtaken parts of the troll nation. Heroes have recently journeyed to the beleaguered region to strike at the savage Drakkari and their maddened prophets.\"\nWrath of the Lich King.\nEven so, the greatest threat to the region is rumored to lie undisturbed within the capital of the ice trolls' empire, Gundrak. In the depths of the city, the most sacred shrines are said to be steeped in the mojo of slain gods.

If left undisturbed, the trolls of Gundrak may soon unleash their burgeoning might, plunging the entire region into chaos.\nThe great mosaic circle before the steps of Gundrak is where the twisted Drakkari prophets held the last of their loa: &lt;a href=\"Akali\"&gt;Akali&lt;/a&gt;, the rhino god.

The high prophets &lt;a href=\"Gal%27darah\"&gt;Gal'darah&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Moorabi\"&gt;Moorabi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Slad%27ran\"&gt;Slad'ran&lt;/a&gt; held Gundrak for a time, but they were felled by &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s.\nExploring Azeroth.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;war against the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, the brothers &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard\"&gt;Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; visited Gundrak and reported that the capital, once the beating heart of Zul'Drak, was now only ruins and that there was no one left but the dead and the undead.\nGeography.\nInside the Instance.\nAfter killing &lt;a href=\"Eck%20the%20Ferocious\"&gt;Eck the Ferocious&lt;/a&gt;, what most people don't know is that the body of water that he comes from is actually a passage. It requires swimming through the water to go to the next location (the final boss). Also, this path skips the few mobs back at around the outside of the secret entrance.\nIt is only recommended that you use this pathway if you're a Druid with Aquatic Form, as the swim will take no time at all and you'll be there very fast. It's not a vast maze, it's easy to find your way, because there's only one path: just walk into the water and swim straight.\nFlight point.\nThere is a neutral flight point at the base of the mountains to the west of the temple complex. It is a short ride from the flight master to the &lt;a href=\"Meeting%20Stone\"&gt;Meeting Stone&lt;/a&gt; for the Gundrak instance.\nWalkthrough.\nGundrak has two entrances, one to the north and one to the south. The northern entrance has the summoning stone outside. The first boss encountered when entering through the north entrance is Slad'ran the serpent boss; if entering through the southern entrance, the first encounter is with Moorabi, the mammoth boss. Each entrance will take you down to the main circle. Around the circle are three bosses, each representing one aspect. There are roughly 2-4 pulls between bosses. Once all three bosses are killed and their altars activated, a bridge will swing into place in the middle of the circle (just behind Drakkari the Colossus), allowing the group to pass over the central altar. Several pulls later, you meet Gal'darah, a rhino aspect, and the presumed leader of Gundrak. You can get to the center circle by jumping into the water behind any of the three bosses and swimming to the staircase or using the stairs behind Drakkari. The fish in the water will not follow you onto the land. One note of interest is that some mobs will do an AoE knockback, so players should be cautious when fighting mobs around ledges. A full run should take about 45 minutes.\nQuests.\nGundrak quests are offered by either &lt;a href=\"Tol%27mar\"&gt;Tol'mar&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Chronicler%20Bah%27Kini\"&gt;Chronicler Bah'Kini&lt;/a&gt;, depending on which entrance you use.\nIn the RPG.\nGundrak is the &lt;a href=\"Ice%20troll\"&gt;Drakkari&lt;/a&gt; capital, the only large &lt;a href=\"city\"&gt;city&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Drak\"&gt;Zul'Drak&lt;/a&gt; and the home to the Drakkari &lt;a href=\"Frost%20King%20Malakk\"&gt;Frost King Malakk&lt;/a&gt;. It is easy to forget that trolls are even remotely intelligent until you see a place like Gundrak. When the Drakkari nation was beginning to take shape thousands of years ago, the central tribe's home became the capital city of Gundrak.\nDescription.\nGundrak is a massive place, with thick walls, tall guard towers and heavy gates. Inside, the buildings are tiered and covered in steps, and wind about one another like a nest of small animals, each fitting into the next. The architecture here is almost identical to that of &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"South%20Seas\"&gt;South Seas&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe Drakkari are crude and violent, but there is a modicum of organization in the city. Women and whelps handle most of the cleaning, food preparation and clothing needs. Those unfit for battle do manual labor or simple crafts. Many of the buildings have rough carvings along their walls, and war trophies are interspersed with furs. Chores are handled quickly and efficiently to make time for drinking, eating and combat. &lt;a href=\"Warrior\"&gt;Warrior&lt;/a&gt;s fight frequently, from mere wrestling matches to armed death duels, and brawls occur at every meal. Rather than stop this, the Frost King uses these conflicts to gauge the strength of his warriors, selecting the victors for favored missions.\nOf course, the Drakkari do not welcome visitors \u2014 at least, not as guests. Sometimes a warrior who has demonstrated his strength may be invited to dine with the Drakkari and his safety is then guaranteed until the end of the meal. After that, however, he may find himself a target of the assembled tribes. Trolls are unpredictable, though, so an adventurer attempting this tactic may find himself part of the meal.\nThe best way to enter Gundrak is by slipping in unnoticed. Sometimes the Drakkari are too busy fighting and drinking to look down.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

{"id": "69482", "revid": "39299307", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=69482", "title": "Gunman", "text": "The gunman is a &lt;a href=\"knight\"&gt;knight&lt;/a&gt; on the cutting edge of weapons development. He takes the newest &lt;a href=\"technological\"&gt;technological&lt;/a&gt; inventions, and through a combination of innate skill and careful study, pushes them beyond the limits their creators imagined. While some &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s favor the sword or the axe or the bow, the gunman favors guns - pistols, rifles, blunderbusses, he is adept at them all. He is capable of performing amazing stunts with his firearms that leave others staring with wide eyes.\nA typical gunman carries several weapons \u2014 almost all of them firearms. A long rifle and blunderbuss are slung across his back. Pistols rest in holsters on his hips, at his back, on his shins, and beneath his arms (and in several other secret places). Bandoliers hold ammunition and gunpowder. Say the word and pistols leap into his hands, blazing fusillade of death.\nGunmen claim that their abilities are purely the result of their skill, training and natural ability. Their accuracy and quickness are impressive, but not based on &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;al enhancement or any sort of &lt;a href=\"divine\"&gt;divine&lt;/a&gt; inspiration. However, gunmen are hard-pressed to say how their training makes the power of magic weapons cling to their hands, or how they are able to draw and fire over a dozen pistols in the space of a few seconds.\nMany gunmen are show-offs, prone to taking shots that are excessively difficult for no other reason than to display their skills. A stunt shot is such a shot. A stunt shot can take a variety of forms: behind the back, between the legs, while looking at the target in a mirror, while reading a book, tossing a pistol from hand to hand before the shot, spinning a rifle before the shot, dropping the firearm then kicking it back into one's hand, tossing a coin spinning before it strikes the target, firing from the hip, and similar displays of amazing marksmanship. A gunman can elect to make any attack with a firearm a stunt shot.\nGunmen have the peculiar trait of creating deep, personal connections with their weapons. Some joke (or complain) that the gunmen love their weapons more than their spouses or children - and this claim is not far from the truth. Declaring a specific firearm to be a special gun involves an unofficial, hour-long ceremony in which the gunman cleans the gun and creates an attachment to it. The gunmen can only have one special gun at a time.\nGunmen gain a supernatural ability, which they call \"pistol swap\", allowing them to draw, fire and reholster any number of pistols over and over. In addition, the magic of an enchanted pistol clings to the gunman's hands and empowers the other pistols he fires. Some claim this feat occurs because the gunman's hands move so fast that the enchantments do not have time to leave them, and indeed some gunman's hands glow with colored light as they trade pistols, the light increasing in intensity as the gunman draws more and more pistols. When the gunman performs a pistol swap, the first pistol he fires transfers its magic properties to his hand. All subsequent pistols he draws and fires with the same hand bear the magical properties identical to the first pistol. The magic clings to only the hand that fired the pistol. If the gunman fights with a pistol in each hand, each hand retains different magic.\nGunmen in the world.\nGunmen are most common among the &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20dwarf\"&gt;Ironforge dwarves&lt;/a&gt;, as the dwarves have a reputation as snipers and &lt;a href=\"Rifleman\"&gt;riflemen&lt;/a&gt;. Some credit the dwarves with the invention of the firearm, and Ironforge is proud of its gun-toting &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s. Many &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;s also take on the mantle of the gunman, using Ironforge or homemade weapons to annihilate their foes. &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;Night elves&lt;/a&gt; prefer the bow, citing its faster reload time and reliability \u2014 but those who have seen gunmen in action have cause to doubt claims of the bows' superiority. &lt;a href=\"Furbolg\"&gt;Furbolg&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20dwarf\"&gt;Wildhammer dwarves&lt;/a&gt; avoid firearms, some seeing them as an affront to nature.\nGunmen are rare in the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, but not unheard of. Most members of the Horde prefer melee combat to ranged, and those individuals who focus on ranged attacks favor thrown weapons or mighty bows \u2014 something to which they can apply some strength. Still, the power of the gun and the skill of the gunman cannot be denied, and a few members of the Horde \u2014 most among the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 are notable gunmen.\nIn World of Warcraft.\nSeveral gunmen were aboard \"&lt;a href=\"Mannoroth%27s%20Bones\"&gt;Mannoroth's Bones&lt;/a&gt;\". As the ship was leaving the &lt;a href=\"Borean%20Tundra\"&gt;Borean Tundra&lt;/a&gt;, they fired at the enemy vessel of the &lt;a href=\"Kvaldir\"&gt;Kvaldir&lt;/a&gt;."}

{"id": "188352", "revid": "3154973", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=188352", "title": "Gunship", "text": "Gunships are massive heavily armed and armored aircraft (or &lt;a href=\"airship\"&gt;airship&lt;/a&gt;s) which can be found in the arsenal of both the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, although the gunships of each differ significantly. Gunships are the result of many hours of labor and painstaking amounts of advanced engineering, generally &lt;a href=\"gnomish\"&gt;gnomish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"dwarven\"&gt;dwarven&lt;/a&gt; for the Alliance, and &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; for the Horde. They may serve several roles, from transport to attack aircraft, but regardless of their function, all serve as versatile and maneuverable platforms from which attacks may be launched or operations conducted. \nGunships tend to be vulnerable to ground- or sea-based artillery and, due to their nature, do not survive for very long if they become seriously damaged. As such, they usually deploy shock tactics. Utilizing heavy firepower and quick movement to pacify resistance, or deploying other ground attack aircraft, like &lt;a href=\"gyrocopter\"&gt;gyrocopter&lt;/a&gt;s, or ground personnel like marines, gunships can succeed with light casualties where other forces simply could not. \nAlliance.\nBorn of tenacious gnomish and dwarven engineering, Alliance gunships tend to be more compact and incorporate a larger amount technology and machinery into their structures. Unlike Horde gunships, they are propelled through a series of specifically placed powerful propellers.\nThere are two versions of these gunships: the first version has two main propellers placed amidships between the middle and lower hull. The second version has four main propellers extruding from the four corners (two fore and two aft) of the lower hull, as well as a deck with a runway and landing pads. The main propellers keep it aloft, while four smaller propellers located at the four corners between the upper and middle hull are used to change direction and propel the airship forward.\nThese gunships contains numerous heavy cannons: four smaller ones on each side of its fuselage, with several large turrets mounted on the main deck which can also serve an anti-aircraft function. There are ten hatches (five on each side) located just above the four smaller cannons, and from which artillery can be fired. Additional guns and turrets have been known to be mounted on the main deck as the situation requires. The main deck is also the location of emergency escape craft, which resemble lifeboats. At the very front of a gunship is its figurehead, a very large, gold-colored eagle with small, spread wings protruding from the neck, representing the Alliance. The Alliance gunship tends to more resemble an actual ship, with its captain's quarters constructed in a similar fashion and its cannons lined up along the hull.\nThere are also numerous layers and decks to these gunships; an upper observations deck accessed by stairs, a main deck where the captain's and navigation's center is also located, and two lower decks where the majority of the other functions on the ship are carried out. The main deck of the ship additionally serves a platform from which &lt;a href=\"gyrocopter\"&gt;gyrocopter&lt;/a&gt;s may take off and land from, and each gunship will often possess its own compliment of these smaller aircraft. The lowest level of the ship also contains a large hatch which appears to function both to drop explosives from, and as a means of facilitating troops to parachute out for boarding or airdrop actions. The lower levels of the vessel also appear to host the mess and crew quarters. At the very lower stern of the gunship is the open rear deck balcony, which is used by troops to parachute from and an alternate disembarkation point for one or two flying mounts; it could also possibly be used as another platform from which to survey/fire on the ship's environment.\nIn terms of armor, a gunship is usually well-protected. There are large strips of metal running the length of the airship's hull and the only areas which appear to be entirely unarmored are certain parts of the lower fuselage, as well as the open-air decks. The gunship's main turbines are also protected by a thick layer of metal. Despite this, these propellers appear to remain the ship's greatest weakness; it has been observed that even in the four main propeller version, if only one of these engines fail or become damaged, the entire gunship can go down.\nIn the Alliance military, gunships fall under the authority of the navy and are generally treated as a sea vessel.\nThe two propeller version was first used at &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt;, and some time later, the four propeller version at the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Conquest\"&gt;Isle of Conquest&lt;/a&gt;. The first type has been used in &lt;a href=\"Deepholm\"&gt;Deepholm&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, but the majority are of the second type.\nHorde.\nMainly engineered by the &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s and usually larger and more jagged-looking, Horde gunships are no less intimidating in their fearsome array of weapons and armor. These airships maintain altitude using two vast air balloons suspended above the ship, which are nearly as large as the fuselage itself. The airship accelerates through the use of a large and powerful engine located at the very back of the vessel. It is possible that this type of gunship is unable to reverse, as there appears to be no mechanism in place for this anywhere on board. \nThese gunships are very heavily armed, possessing six large cannons (four in the front section of the ship and two in the back), as well as six gun platforms (three on each side) protruding from the fuselage, on which smaller turrets or personnel may be positioned. Additionally, a particularly large double-cannon is located just under the ship's figurehead and serves as one of the vessel's most powerful offensive weapons, likely used in engagement. Just above the main cannon at the front of the ship is its figurehead, a grey &lt;a href=\"wolf\"&gt;wolf&lt;/a&gt;'s head, from whose mouth one of the cannon barrels protrudes. As a result of the somewhat dispersed placement of its guns, the ship is able to fire in almost any direction at any given time (except directly upwards). \nThere are three levels to this type airship: a platform and rampart connected to the ship's air bladders high above the decks, the main deck which holds the majority of the vessel's munitions and its command center, and the lower level on which all the cannons (save the main frontal one) are located as well as the furnace room for the ship's engine. If needed, smaller artillery such as cannons or catapults can be, and are known to be, placed on the main deck of the gunship to provide additional firepower.\nWhile slightly less armored than its Alliance counterpart, the Horde gunship is still protected by strips of metal girding the body of the ship and even the air blimps suspended above it. The airship also has a number of spikes protruding from seemingly-arbitrary points in its structure, such as the balloons, or the frontal and back fuselage; this is likely an aesthetic feature rather than a practical one. One of the gunship's flaws appears to include the dangerous placement of cannon shells and other munitions for its main cannon in the open on deck. Should this stockpile get hit, it could trigger an explosion or fire on board.\nUsage.\nGunships have played, and continue to play, a pivotal role in conflicts throughout &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and beyond. Though generally small in number, they have taken part in some of the most decisive engagements in recent history. Such engagements include the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, where gunships featured prominently in Alliance-Horde skirmishes in &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt; as well as in the final assault on &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt; itself. Alliance and Horde gunships also took part in the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20Deathwing\"&gt;war against Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, where they were used to fight and pursue &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;the Destroyer&lt;/a&gt;, ensuring his final defeat. During the &lt;a href=\"Alliance-Horde%20war%23Invasion%20of%20Pandaria\"&gt;Invasion of Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, gunships were relied on heavily in discovering and securing the continent, both for the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. In the final days of the &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"True%20Horde\"&gt;True Horde&lt;/a&gt;, the \"&lt;a href=\"Skyfire\"&gt;Skyfire&lt;/a&gt;\" took part in &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, serving as a launching point for assaults on the city itself. \nIn addition to these major events, gunships tend to feature in a large portion of conflicts in the &lt;a href=\"Alliance-Horde%20war\"&gt;Alliance-Horde war&lt;/a&gt;, where they are used as mobile bases from which to launch attacks on the other faction. Due to their heavy firepower and tough exterior, the gunships are ideal for spearheading attacks against fortified or heavily defended positions. Such bloody campaigns where they have been deployed include the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Conquest\"&gt;Isle of Conquest&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Gilneas\"&gt;invasion of Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;.\nMounts.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Skychaser\"&gt;Stormwind Skychaser&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar%20Interceptor\"&gt;Orgrimmar Interceptor&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon%202017\"&gt;BlizzCon 2017&lt;/a&gt; promotional mounts."}

The three of them wove their apprentice wands together into a single wand as a symbol of their friendship. Gunther was a skilled &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt; (even though necromancy is illegal among the Kirin Tor).\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, Gunther and Bethor were killed and raised by the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;Plague of Undeath&lt;/a&gt; while Thule willingly sided with the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. Gunther later broke free of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Domination\"&gt;Domination&lt;/a&gt; on his own. He believed that he was the only undead with free will and that all others were Scourge slaves, and therefore isolated himself at &lt;a href=\"Gunther%27s%20Retreat\"&gt;Gunther's Retreat&lt;/a&gt; and had his &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt; minions attack anyone who approached him.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;, unaware of Gunther's identity, wished to recruit the lich for his skill in necromancy. Bethor, now a Forsaken, sent an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; to steal the lich's &lt;a href=\"The%20Lich%27s%20Spellbook\"&gt;spellbook&lt;/a&gt; in order to discern who he was. Realizing that the lich was none other than his old friend from Dalaran, Bethor put an enchantment on the book to show that he, too, was a free-willed undead, then sent the adventurer to give the book back to Gunther. Gunther asked the adventurer to defeat the Scourge agent &lt;a href=\"Lillith%20Nefara\"&gt;Lillith Nefara&lt;/a&gt; to prove that they were also an enemy of the Lich King. After they did so, he agreed to join the Forsaken and asked the adventurer to deliver a &lt;a href=\"%3ANether%20Gem\"&gt;:Nether Gem&lt;/a&gt; to Bethor so that he could communicate with his old friend."}

An advantage of these recipes is they do not require an ingredient purchased using &lt;a href=\"Ironpaw%20Token\"&gt;Ironpaw Token&lt;/a&gt;.\nYou can get these recipes as a drop without actually having 600 in the required cooking school. You must have 600 in the listed school to learn the receipe. Preliminary reports say you can \"not\" get the recipes as a drop unless your regular cooking skill is 525 or higher.\nAn unusual feature of these recipes is that they include ingredients with a 2-hour time limit.\nRecipes in this family.\nThe first ingredient in each recipe is a drop from the Guo-Lai Mogu. The rice appears as an item inside Guo-Lai Halls. The eggs, petals, pomfruit, and lushrooms are found in different areas of the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt;. The strawberries and mangos are sold by &lt;a href=\"Merchant%20Tantan\"&gt;Merchant Tantan&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Setting%20Sun%20Garrison\"&gt;Setting Sun Garrison&lt;/a&gt; in the southwest section of the Vale of Eternal Blossoms."}

The fight is a &lt;a href=\"battle%20for%20survival\"&gt;battle for survival&lt;/a&gt; combined with a tough healer &lt;a href=\"gear%20check\"&gt;gear check&lt;/a&gt;. Depending on the relative gear levels between healers and damage dealers, Bloodboil is usually killed fifth or sixth, and is a prerequisite for gaining access to &lt;a href=\"Mother%20Shahraz\"&gt;Mother Shahraz&lt;/a&gt;.\nOverview.\nAs the fight progresses, the Gurtogg swaps between two modes that determine which abilities he uses. In one mode, he afflicts distant targets with deadly maladies, while in the other he fixates on a random player with his full might.\nPreparation.\nThe fight has two alternating phases in a 90 seconds cycle. During the 60 seconds of Phase 1 the bloodboil debuff is dealt out and the tanks take a stacking debuff. Right after the fifth set of bloodboil debuffs, Gurtogg and one random raid member receive Fel Rage, which starts Phase 2. After 30 seconds Fel Rage wears off and Phase 1 starts again.\nThe encounter can be reset by running up the ramp, through the next room and up the stairs on the back of that room.\nRaid composition.\nBecause the enrage timer is rather long trading DPS for extra healing is feasible.\nBuffs and gear.\nThe fight is extremely healing intensive, even more so than &lt;a href=\"High%20Warlord%20Naj%27entus\"&gt;High Warlord Naj'entus&lt;/a&gt; - healers should wear their best endurance gear. Each raid member should have a &lt;a href=\"Healthstone\"&gt;Healthstone&lt;/a&gt;, all raid members should have a few health or rejuvenation potions. No special resistance gear is required.\nPositioning.\nMost raids fight him on the ramp leading down to his place. The melee group stands on the right wall (when facing the boss), tanks with their backs to the wall, everybody else sets up on the ramp near the line drawn on the floor at the left wall. Three groups of five people each need to be pre-designated as Bloodboil (BB) soakers. The first of these groups sets up beyond the line with their backs to the left wall.\nPhase 1.\nAfter a standard &lt;a href=\"Misdirection\"&gt;Misdirection&lt;/a&gt; pull, the first tank takes him. The other tanks should do their best to build as much threat as possible, all other raid members must be extra careful to stay below all three tanks on the aggro list.\nBloodboil.\nEvery time Gurtogg deals BB, the five BB soakers who just got it must move forward over the line, and the next group of five must move back to the wall, in order to take the next BB. The three groups need to keep up this rotation until five sets of BBs have been dealt. For new raids it's a good idea to practise this rotation prior to the pull. No raid member should ever take a double BB, because that's very hard to heal through.\nOne method to organize the rotation is to designate three groups, and give one member of each group a raid mark. After each BB, the raid leader calls out the icon which is due next. Two of the groups have to take two sets of BB each, one group takes only one. Raid members with low total health, usually Mages or Priests, should be in that third group.\nHealing.\nThree healers should concentrate on healing through the BB damage. 1-2 healers should be on the off-tanks, and the rest on the current MT. As usual in situations with lots of distributed damage, &lt;a href=\"Chain%20Heal\"&gt;Chain Heal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Circle%20of%20Healing\"&gt;Circle of Healing&lt;/a&gt; are the spells of choice.\nTanking.\nThe Acidic Wound stack can grow to dangerous levels, at 20 debuffs for example, the tank takes 5k damage per &lt;a href=\"tick\"&gt;tick&lt;/a&gt; and has 10k less armor. If it gets too much, the tank must drop aggro (&lt;a href=\"Misdirection\"&gt;Misdirection&lt;/a&gt; to one of the OTs is helpful here) and move to Gurtoggs back, avoiding Arcing Smash for 60 seconds until the debuff stack wears off. During that time, the tank must continue building as much hate as possible. Paladins can bubble out of the debuff stack (which temporarily removes him from the threat list).\nAll three tanks must be clearly aware of each others threat levels and current Acidic Wound stack. In the ideal case, the three tanks are closely together on the hate list and can easily take aggro from each other. In order to build rage the OTs can take an Arcing Smash now and then on purpose. A small stack of Acidic Wounds helps rage generation.\nThe third tank is needed for Disorient. If one tank is on Acidic Wound cooldown and the current MT gets Disoriented, the third tank must take over.\nStacking avoidance gear can be feasible, because all of Gurtogg's abilities can be avoided. The problem in that case is that the aggro-reducing abilities are avoided too, this can lead to the MT running far ahead on the hate list. The MT may have to stop his attacks entirely, or &lt;a href=\"Hand%20of%20Protection\"&gt;Hand of Protection&lt;/a&gt; can be used.\nTransition to Fel Rage.\nThe transition to Fel Rage (FR) after the fifth BB is the most healing intensive moment in the fight. 15 raid members have BB, and one person gets FR, needing a lot of attention from the healers, while the tanks still have the DoT stacks from Acidic Wounds. All main tank healers must immediately switch to the FR target, while the raid healers must do their best keeping the BB targets up. At the same time, the raid must spread out to avoid too much damage from the Acid Geyser. It's a good idea to start repositioning after the fourth BB, but be careful that the designated BB soakers remain the raid members furthest away from Gurtogg. The melee damage dealers should also move away from him, to avoid taking damage from Arcing Smash when he turns around to face the FR target.\nPhase 2.\nAt the start of Phase 2, Gurtogg casts Acid Geyser together with FR on a random raid member and quickly runs to that person. The FR target should not move, and the raid should regroup so that nobody is hit by Gurtoggs frontal cone attacks.\nThe toughest job during these 30 seconds is to keep the FR target up. Cloth classes take normal attacks for ~13k (up to 20k crushing), and nothing prevents two (or more) crushing blows in a row. If the FR target can heal, he should do a lot of self-healing (since FR increases healing done by 100%). All non-healing capable classes should use at least a &lt;a href=\"Super%20Healing%20Potion\"&gt;Super Healing Potion&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Healthstone\"&gt;Healthstone&lt;/a&gt;, and try to reduce their damage taken as much as possible.\nIf the FR target dies, Gurtogg returns to the normal aggro list (usually to a tank). Since during Phase 2 Gurtoggs damage output is substantially higher than during Phase 1, the tank should use all means available to increase his survivability (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Shield%20Wall\"&gt;Shield Wall&lt;/a&gt;). It is in the raid's best interest not to let the FR target die, as with the extra HP and armor, even mages are better suited to take Gurtogg's attacks than the tanks are.\nDamage dealers should make sure they have the Insignificance buff, and then go all-out during this phase, using all trinkets and cooldowns (like &lt;a href=\"Bloodlust\"&gt;Bloodlust&lt;/a&gt;).\nClass instructions for Fel Rage.\nGenerally, FR targets must immediately use all damage-reducing or health enhancing abilities they have. Damage dealers and tanks should switch to their most defensive setup. Classes able to use a shield should equip one. Pure healing builds should exclusively spam heal themselves (this allows the other healers to regain some mana). DPS hybrids able to heal should start out spam healing themselves. If the raid healers have covered up and the situation feels comfortable, hybrids may start do DPS, but must be ready to immediately resume self healing if their health drops below 50%.\nAlternate strategy.\nPositioning.\nSome raids fight Gurtogg at the waterfalls right in front of his initial position. The tanks line up at the right waterfall, the raid stands near the trough of the left waterfall, with the BB soakers in the trough.\nAnother alternative is to tank him on the wall behind his initial position. This gives the raid a lot of space to spread out to minimize the damage from Acit Geyser, but has the disadvantage that wipe recovery is much more difficult.\nTwo tanks.\nIt's possible to manage this fight with only two tanks. This requires them both to have very good avoidance gear.\nSoloing.\nGurtogg is a DPS race with a twist when soloing; since the player is the only possible target for Bloodboil, it will progressively stack on him/her to the point of doing several thousand damage per second after a couple of minutes. This is potentially fatal even to a well-geared level 90, so it is important to blow all cooldowns and maximize DPS to kill Gurtogg before this happens. "}

{"id": "16856", "revid": "49740203", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=16856", "title": "Gurubashi Arena", "text": "The Gurubashi Arena (or The Great Arena) is an &lt;a href=\"arena\"&gt;arena&lt;/a&gt; located on the northwestern section of the &lt;a href=\"Cape%20of%20Stranglethorn\"&gt;Cape of Stranglethorn&lt;/a&gt;, just north of &lt;a href=\"Booty%20Bay\"&gt;Booty Bay&lt;/a&gt;. The Arena is an old relic of the mighty &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20Empire\"&gt;Gurubashi Empire&lt;/a&gt;, which once controlled vast tracts of land in the southern regions of the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Gurubashi Arena provides ruffians a shot at competition, fame, and treasure. It is said that in ancient times, fights were to the death, and the sand of the area was muddy with troll blood. &lt;a href=\"Short%20John%20Mithril\"&gt;Short John Mithril&lt;/a&gt; is the overseer of the less-lethal matches. Old stories say that if one finds a blood-red amulet at midnight, a &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; will devour their soul by daybreak. Once a generation, the greatest &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s from all over &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; come to this arena to challenge one another in combat. This is an ancient rite long presided over by the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari troll&lt;/a&gt; king, &lt;a href=\"Rastakhan\"&gt;Rastakhan&lt;/a&gt;. They fight for the glory of the &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt;. To win is one of the greatest honors to which a troll can aspire. With Rastakhan's death, it is unknown if the rite will continue.\nIn World of Warcraft.\nThe sub-region \"Gurubashi Arena\" covers a wide area around the arena itself. Within the actual arena, the stands and that area is a contested area not technically part of Cape of Stranglethorn called The Great Arena, but in the actual ring &lt;a href=\"Player%20vs%20All\"&gt;PvA&lt;/a&gt; is enabled; players may attack or be attacked by any players from either faction, except those within your party.\nThe arena is still in use for the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20Arena%23Gurubashi%20Arena%20Booty%20Run\"&gt;Gurubashi Arena Booty Run&lt;/a&gt;. This arena was built by &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20Empire\"&gt;Gurubashi Empire&lt;/a&gt;, but endured the long ages from its fall. In these times, it is often used by pirates for entertainment: Every 3 hours starting from midnight, the pirate captain places a chest with some precious booty into the middle of the arena, and the crew is then entertained by the bloody battle that occurs. Any adventurer can join the battle! A universal &lt;a href=\"Player%20vs%20Player\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt; flag is enabled when you enter the floor of the arena.\nGurubashi Arena Booty Run.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Bloodsail%20Pirates\"&gt;Bloodsail Pirates&lt;/a&gt; have a penchant for illicit after-hours activities, especially those involving mass combat and treasure. To see that his crew has its nightly fill of extracurricular entertainment, a lone pirate captain will drop a chest in the center of the Arena starting at midnight, and again every three hours at 3 a.m. 6 a.m. 9 a.m. 12 p.m. 3 p.m. 6 p.m. 9 p.m. and back to midnight the chest drops. Be the first to get to the chest and loot it - while fighting off everyone else trying to do the same - and you'll reap the reward it holds. Of course, the arena is a &lt;a href=\"Player%20vs%20All\"&gt;PvA&lt;/a&gt; area, so there might be other players who are trying to open it first.\nRewards.\nWithin Arena Treasure Chest adventurers can frequently find &lt;a href=\"Superior%20Healing%20Potion\"&gt;Superior Healing Potion&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Healing%20Potion\"&gt;Greater Healing Potion&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Mana%20Potion\"&gt;Greater Mana Potion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mana%20Potion\"&gt;Mana Potion&lt;/a&gt;s. Rare as well as uncommon equipment can also be found inside the chest. Some notable equipment exclusive to the treasure chest are:\nIn addition, through the quests &lt;a href=\"Arena%20Master%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Arena Master (quest)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arena%20Grandmaster\"&gt;Arena Grandmaster&lt;/a&gt;, the rare trinket &lt;a href=\"Arena%20Grand%20Master\"&gt;Arena Grand Master&lt;/a&gt; can be obtained. Adventurers must hand in 12 &lt;a href=\"Arena%20Master\"&gt;Arena Master&lt;/a&gt;s to &lt;a href=\"Short%20John%20Mithril\"&gt;Short John Mithril&lt;/a&gt; inside the arena to obtain the rare trinket.\nBoth the &lt;a href=\"Arena%20Grand%20Master\"&gt;Arena Grand Master&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Arena%20Master\"&gt;Arena Master&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;a href=\"Bind%20on%20Pickup\"&gt;Bind on Pickup&lt;/a&gt;, and the Arena Master requires level 35 to use.\nYou can get the achievements &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20Arena%20Master\"&gt;Gurubashi Arena Master&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20Arena%20Grand%20Master\"&gt;Gurubashi Arena Grand Master&lt;/a&gt; when looting Arena Master and completing the quest for Arena Grand Master.\nGurubashi Arena digsite.\nThe area surrounding the Gurubashi Arena is a troll &lt;a href=\"archaeology\"&gt;archaeology&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"dig%20site\"&gt;dig site&lt;/a&gt;. Note that to date, no artifact fragments have been found within the arena itself. It seems likely that arena spectators over the centuries have made off with what the janitors left behind.\nIn the RPG.\nThe Arena is one of the few places you can visit in &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt; and not expect to be immediately captured and killed. The ancient &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20Empire\"&gt;Gurubashi&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jungle%20troll\"&gt;trolls&lt;/a&gt; built a huge gladiatorial &lt;a href=\"arena\"&gt;arena&lt;/a&gt; many years ago, and it stands in ruins now \u2014 though the remaining Gurubashi still hold games within the building. Some of the participants are volunteers, and some are captured travelers or adventurers who were sold to the Arena by other &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"tribe\"&gt;tribe&lt;/a&gt;s. The more well-known &lt;a href=\"gladiator\"&gt;gladiator&lt;/a&gt;s are very popular, and much can be won and lost (including your life) in gambling over these games.\nWhile the Arena is relatively safe compared to the other areas of Stranglethorn Vale (uncommon races such as &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; will not be immediately snared and eaten), it is not a friendly place. Desperate people will cut your throat or your purse to pay a gambling debt, and thugs working for the Arena will snatch people if the competition needs some variety. Still, it is a good place to stock up on weapons and supplies from the several &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"merchant\"&gt;merchant&lt;/a&gt;s in the area. The Arena has the region's most diversified population. Most of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; races make their home here; &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s like the competition of the Arena, and the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear trolls&lt;/a&gt; will stay where the orcs do.\nThe disperse troll tribes in Stranglethorn Vale keep close to their tribes, rarely mixing unless they meet in the Arena. After a pirate raid, the &lt;a href=\"Blackwater%20Raiders\"&gt;Blackwater Raiders&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Booty%20Bay\"&gt;Booty Bay&lt;/a&gt; send their loot up the road to the Arena to sell, or even further into &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28continent%29\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nArena Games.\nThe &lt;a href=\"jungle%20troll\"&gt;jungle troll&lt;/a&gt;s of the ancient &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20tribe\"&gt;Gurubashi tribe&lt;/a&gt; run the gladiatorial games at the Arena. The gladiators are chosen from prisoners of war, kidnapped travelers of any affiliation, those in debt to the Gurubashi, and even some hapless fools who think it would be an easy way to make some quick cash. Something few people know, even those who live in the settlement surrounding the Arena, is that children are born and raised within the Arena to add to the stables. They are trained in many skills beyond the gladiatorial so that the games will be varied from time to time, and also so that the stables will always have &lt;a href=\"healer\"&gt;healer&lt;/a&gt;s. If a gladiator gets pregnant, she is taken off the roster until she delivers and the baby is taken from her to be raised in the stables.\nThe head of the Arena stables, a jungle troll named &lt;a href=\"Bloodstone%20%28troll%29\"&gt;Bloodstone&lt;/a&gt;, has recently become greedy. Although his stables are full of mature teens and young adults ready to fight as well as several captured unwilling fighters, attendance at the fights has been down in the past months. He decided to send a party of his best trolls over the mountains to the &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt; to capture a &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; for the Arena. Eventually, a messenger returned and alerted Bloodstone that a &lt;a href=\"felguard\"&gt;felguard&lt;/a&gt; had been captured and the triumphant &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s were on their way back to the Arena. This development looked to be certain death for those chosen to fight the demon, and those in the stables only had a couple of days to attempt an escape before the trolls returned.\nSlaves captured for the Arena are left with only their the clothes on, as troll guards confiscate any equipment they may have. They are brought to the Arena and are forced to participate in various games. The Arena slavers take in anyone no matter if they are prisoners of war or as unlucky travelers, or they even residents of the settlements around the Arena who owe the trolls money. They can also be of any affiliation, as the trolls capture &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and independent races without prejudice. Even some jungle trolls live in the stables.\n&lt;a href=\"Marcus%20%28gladiator%29\"&gt;Marcus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kilrim\"&gt;Kilrim&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Jai%27nor\"&gt;Jai'nor&lt;/a&gt; were forced to participate in the gladiatorial games.\nIn Hearthstone.\nThe \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\" expansion is based around the Gurubashi Arena. The context is a once per generation event in which the troll tribes of Azeroth make a pilgrimage to the Arena at &lt;a href=\"Rastakhan\"&gt;King Rastakhan's&lt;/a&gt; behest to participate in gladiatorial combat under the watch of the &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt;. This lore would eventually be made canon with the release of \"\"."}

They hit fairly hard and do an AoE fear (Aggro reset), an AoE knockback, enrage at 50% and an AoE thunderclap. Watch to make sure your back is not facing another group or a cliff edge. After the AoE fear, most melee will lose aggro and the berserker will go for the ranged damage or a healer, so keep an eye open.\nThese things take a tremendous amount of space to fight, do not risk fighting them near other groups. The main problem with these is that they A) do a ton of damage, around 500dps to plate and B) wipe aggro on everyone near them. This means that there is a very high risk of the zerker wiping threat, jaunting off to kill a mage, and then being taunted. Eliminating deaths on these things is tough.\nBasically, this involves treating the Berserker like the spider boss. Have the MT grab the Berserker, and have the 'Catcher' stand with the ranged dps. When the Berserker sheds aggro, and he will, the catcher taunts him and moves him away from the group as well as possible. The former MT then runs to stand with the ranged dps and become the new Catcher. This strategy is somewhat time limited, because if the tank gets the movement debuff that the thunder clap does, moving him out of the ranged dps will become difficult. With good dps though, you will only need to make one or two transitions."}

This is shadow damage and can be absorbed or resisted by the appropriate abilities.\nThey also have an ability that drains 1k life per second from any friendly target and heals them for 5k life a second. This ability will also break sheep, so you need to tank the Drinkers away from other CCd adds.\nStrategies.\nBlood Drinkers can be sheeped and rooted, and often are CC'd and saved for last when pulled with other mobs. Blood Drinkers should be tanked away from the raid and from each other by one tank per Blood Drinker, and attacked from range by everyone else. This minimizes the amount of healing they can do from their tank and from the other Blood Drinker(s).\nAn alternate way of dealing with them (assuming two priests are in group) is to mind control them, and use the ability that drains life from a friendly target and heals them. Mind control two of them on the pull, AOE with both of them, and then use one of them to drain the other's life down to 0\u00a0hp. MC the next mob, and do the same. You can wipe out entire groups (minus the remaining Blood Drinker). Also, for a fun joke, MC one and take out your teammates one by one(healers first). Then proceed to kill yourself (or you'll get a durability loss)."}

It was canceled during &lt;a href=\"beta\"&gt;beta&lt;/a&gt; testing due to gameplay issues. The Gurubashi Catacombs was designed as a 5v5 match, similar to the later implemented &lt;a href=\"arena\"&gt;arena&lt;/a&gt; style, and went on to lead to the development of modern arenas and greatly influence how they are laid out. The battleground was going to be located in the catacombs beneath &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20Arena\"&gt;Gurubashi Arena&lt;/a&gt;, where dangerous animals were once kept.\nThe Catacombs were modeled after FPS deathmatch maps; 5v5, single elimination. It was originally very, very large and multi-leveled; but players spent too much time searching for their opponents.\nDevelopment.\nEarly into beta testing, the Gurubashi Catacombs battleground was canceled because it was too big, preventing players from finding each other easily, and it didn't appeal to them.

But at the same time, we've found that during that process you have to make sure that everything in a battleground goes toward that final objective. We actually tried building a battleground internally once, called the Gurubashi Catacombs (we spoke a little bit about it at &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon\"&gt;BlizzCon&lt;/a&gt;), and that battleground didn't actually have any objectives outside of killing the opponents.\""}

It took its name from the strongest tribe of &lt;a href=\"jungle%20trolls\"&gt;jungle trolls&lt;/a&gt; at the time, the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20tribe\"&gt;Gurubashi&lt;/a&gt;. Their former capital of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Gurub\"&gt;Zul'Gurub&lt;/a&gt; is located in &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, this great nation splintered into separate &lt;a href=\"tribe\"&gt;tribe&lt;/a&gt;s such as the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear tribe&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the height of the Gurubashi Empire, the jungle trolls ruled over lands from Stranglethorn Vale to the &lt;a href=\"Echo%20Isles\"&gt;Echo Isles&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nThe Gurubashi were one the troll tribes that arose to challenge the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; for territory and power.\nWhen a group of trolls awakened &lt;a href=\"Kith%27ix\"&gt;Kith'ix&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"C%27Thrax\"&gt;C'Thrax&lt;/a&gt; viewed the troll nations with contempt and thus sought to destroy them with the &lt;a href=\"aqir\"&gt;aqir&lt;/a&gt;. At the onset of the &lt;a href=\"Aqir%20and%20Troll%20War\"&gt;Aqir and Troll War&lt;/a&gt; numerous smaller tribes fell before the aqir. The Gurubashi were one of the many troll tribes to join the &lt;a href=\"Empire%20of%20Zul\"&gt;Empire of Zul&lt;/a&gt;, in which the Zandalari took on the role of commanding the troll armies. The Empire of Zul forced the aqir to retreat and Kith'ix would be gravely wounded by the trolls and their loa allies.\nSeeking to permanently end the aqir threat, the Zandalari knew that no corner of the continent could be left unguarded, and so the Zandalari convinced the most power-hungry of the troll factions to establish new and permanent strongholds across Kalimdor. At the forefront of these groups were the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20tribe\"&gt;Gurubashi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Drakkari%20tribe\"&gt;Drakkari tribe&lt;/a&gt;s. After they had fully vanquished the aqir in their new regions, they could lay uncontested claim to the untouched fertile lands that they now lived in. The ambitious tribes listened to the Zandalari and readily agreed.\nThe Gurubashi tribe would then venture to the southwest, where they encountered corrupted titan forged. The trolls soon discovered that the aqir had overrun the ancient city of &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt;, originally built as a prison complex for the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"C%27Thun\"&gt;C'Thun&lt;/a&gt;. When they seized the fortress, the aqir enslaved the resident guardians, the &lt;a href=\"anubisath\"&gt;anubisath&lt;/a&gt; giants who guarded the prison. Early engagements between the two forces proved disastrous for the Gurubashi. The &lt;a href=\"insectoid\"&gt;insectoid&lt;/a&gt;s, along with their constructs, marched on and massacred several large troll forces and razed numerous encampments. Observing the situation, the Zandalari instructed the Gurubashi leaders to separate their tribe into smaller, more maneuverable raiding parties instead of large and easily-targeted armies. This new tactic allowed the Gurubashi to constantly bleed the aqiri forces over the years, whittling down their numbers while remaining impossible to effectively be attacked themselves. This worked extremely well and, although not quite able to wipe out the aqir completely, the Gurubashi were successful in securing uncontested control of the entire region. And so the Gurubashi Empire was born.\nIn troll legends, it is said that the &lt;a href=\"Stone%20of%20the%20Tides\"&gt;Stone of the Tides&lt;/a&gt; first made its appearance on the coast of Stranglethorn. It was found and picked up by a wandering troll warrior. Intrigued by the blue stone he found, he took it with him on his journey. As time passed, the troll discovered that the stone gave him control over water. He could summon &lt;a href=\"water%20elemental\"&gt;water elemental&lt;/a&gt;s, manipulate the tides, and accomplish feats that only the powerful mages of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; were able to manifest. The warrior traveled back to Zul'Gurub to show his newfound abilities to the Emperor. He gained the court's audience easily with his powers and gained the title \"Tidebearer\", leaving his old name behind. The troll also received a place of honor in the Court of Gurubashi. Tidebearer served the Gurubashi Empire for years, but as time wore on, he became more reclusive. The Stone of Tides carried a curse as well. The Bearer of the stone would start to fade over time until he would disappear from the physical world forever. Keeping this secret from the Empire, the Tidebearer went to the beach where he found the stone and walked into the water, where he disappeared. Many generations later the stone would wash upon the Vale and be picked up by a new Tidebearer. This process would continue, and Tidebearers would come and go just as the last before them.\nCivil war.\n1,500 years before the opening of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, the powerful Gurubashi Empire was torn apart by a massive &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20Civil%20War\"&gt;civil war&lt;/a&gt;. An influential group of Gurubashi priests called forth the avatar of an ancient and terrible blood god named &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20the%20Soulflayer\"&gt;Hakkar the Soulflayer&lt;/a&gt; and named themselves the &lt;a href=\"Hakkari\"&gt;Hakkari&lt;/a&gt;, soon a large amount of Gurubashi joined and became devout followers of Hakkar. With their newfound power, the Gurubashi Empire began to soundly defeat nearby &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt; clans, &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt; tribes as well as trolls who opposed Hakkar. Under Hakkar, the Gurubashi and Hakkari began conquering large swaths of land as well as outlying islands around the &lt;a href=\"South%20Seas\"&gt;South Seas&lt;/a&gt;, achieving all that they had hoped for.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Zandalari\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; began to observe the events from afar, at first pleased with how the Gurubashi had began to return to conquest and traditional worship. Though it soon became clear that Hakkar's bloodlust would \"never\" be sated, the fiendish god would drive not only the troll race to destruction but the entire world as well.\nIt did not take long before the Zandalari rallied their forces and set sail towards the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; where they met with Gurubashi trolls who had hidden their dissent from the Hakkari. The Zandalari and their new Gurubashi allies quickly learnt that a faction of Hakkar's most zealous priests, the &lt;a href=\"Atal%27ai\"&gt;Atal'ai&lt;/a&gt;, were attempting to summon the loa's spirit into a living form. This would awaken terrible new dimensions of his power and spell certain doom for the troll race.\nHorrified by the plans, the Zandalari hosts stormed the Gurubashi capital of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Gurub\"&gt;Zul'Gurub&lt;/a&gt;. Battles raged among the vine-covered ziggurats of the temple city day and night. Though finally, atop of Hakkar's bloodstained shrine, the Zandalari defeated Hakkar and most of his crazed followers.\nA number of his fanatical Atal'ai priests had though escaped into the jungles surrounding Zul'Gurub, in time these trolls finally settled in the &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20of%20Sorrows\"&gt;Swamp of Sorrows&lt;/a&gt; north of the Gurubashi capital. In the heart of the wild marshland, they secretly constructed a great temple to their bloodthirsty loa: the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Atal%27Hakkar\"&gt;Temple of Atal'Hakkar&lt;/a&gt;.\nDeep within the temple, the Atal'ai continued their worship of Hakkar, practicing grisly rituals and ceremonies hoping to once again summon the loa into the physical world. Dark magics twisted the flora and fauna surrounding the temple. Which in turn drew the attention of the &lt;a href=\"Green%20dragonflight\"&gt;green&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspect\"&gt;Dragon Aspect&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt;. Upon learning of the Atal'ai's plans to summon Hakkar, Ysera unleashed her powers on the temple and its inhabitants. The Dragon Aspect's attack buckled the temple's walls and blasted its foundations apart. The immense ziggurat began to sink beneath the land, the swampy mire engulfing the temple with terrified Atal'ai abandoning their rituals and scattered into the marshlands.\nThough Ysera thwarted Hakkar's return, she knew that the Atal'ai might someday attempt to summon the loa again, thus the commanded a number of her loyal green dragons to watch over the ruined temple and ensure it would never again be used to bring such evil into the world.\nVar'gazul, Min'loth and the Fall of Gurubashi.\n&lt;a href=\"Var%27gazul\"&gt;Var'gazul&lt;/a&gt;, chief of the Gurubashi, prepared plans of war, an invasion on an unknown enemy. However his plans were thwarted by the appearance of &lt;a href=\"Neptulon\"&gt;Neptulon&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"kraken\"&gt;kraken&lt;/a&gt;, who destroyed the land west of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Gurub\"&gt;Zul'Gurub&lt;/a&gt; and sunk the city of &lt;a href=\"I%27lalai\"&gt;I'lalai&lt;/a&gt;.\nTribes.\nAll known jungle troll tribes were once part of the Gurubashi Empire. In addition, the &lt;a href=\"Sandfury%20tribe\"&gt;Sandfury tribe&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"sand%20troll\"&gt;sand troll&lt;/a&gt;s was also part of the Gurubashi Empire.\nSettlements.\nMajority if not all of the Gurubashi Empire is located in &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28continent%29\"&gt;Azeroth subcontinent&lt;/a&gt; of Eastern Kingdoms. The following is a list of ruins that are currently associated with tribes descended from the Gurubashi Empire and given their antiquity are also likely to be part of the Gurubashi Empire during its reign."}

The people of Stormwind then settled near Southshore, pledging their loyalty to the recently formed &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. Southshore was transformed into a busy seaport during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;. Its maritime area was rich with &lt;a href=\"oil\"&gt;oil&lt;/a&gt;, which was also coveted by the Horde.\nDespite its new status as a military port, Southshore was eventually attacked and taken by the rampaging Horde. &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; let the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20navy\"&gt;Horde navy&lt;/a&gt; anchored in the port, up until &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Stormreaver%20clan\"&gt;Stormreaver clan&lt;/a&gt; came back from &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; and took a portion of it to the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Black%20Tooth%20Grin%20clan\"&gt;Black Tooth Grin clan&lt;/a&gt; later came back to Southshore as well in order to take the remaining ships and pursue the traitors.\nSometime after the war, Southshore was rebuilt by the Alliance.\nThird War.\nOn the onset of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; gave the order to assemble the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;ish clans in order for the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;new Horde&lt;/a&gt; to leave the continent and travel to &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. They skirmished with &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Forces\"&gt;Alliance Forces&lt;/a&gt; and freed &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grommash Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20clan\"&gt;Warsong clan&lt;/a&gt;, later secretly infiltrating the town during the night to steal its ships so they could sail to &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, Southshore was a lively place. &lt;a href=\"Bartolo%20Ginsetti\"&gt;Bartolo Ginsetti&lt;/a&gt; talked about the \"world-famous\" cloaks he would be making and &lt;a href=\"Nat%20Pagle\"&gt;Nat Pagle&lt;/a&gt; idly fished off the dock. &lt;a href=\"Sally%20Whitemane\"&gt;Sally Whitemane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Renault%20Mograine\"&gt;Renault Mograine&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"James%20Vishas\"&gt;Little Jimmy Vishas&lt;/a&gt; were children running around the town, and &lt;a href=\"Herod\"&gt;Herod&lt;/a&gt; the Bully was wandering around somewhere. Inside the inn, there's was a hushed conversation between &lt;a href=\"Alexandros%20Mograine\"&gt;Alexandros Mograine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Isillien\"&gt;Isillien&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fairbanks\"&gt;Fairbanks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"High%20General%20Abbendis\"&gt;High General Abbendis&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Arcanist%20Doan\"&gt;Arcanist Doan&lt;/a&gt; about the rumors of &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; far to the north. At this precise moment was when the &lt;a href=\"Ashbringer\"&gt;Ashbringer&lt;/a&gt;'s dark crystal was &lt;a href=\"Old%20Hillsbrad%20Ashbringer%20event\"&gt;purified&lt;/a&gt;. In the upper rooms, &lt;a href=\"Stalvan%20Mistmantle\"&gt;Stalvan Mistmantle&lt;/a&gt; was snoring away, while a young &lt;a href=\"Taelan%20Fordring\"&gt;Taelan Fordring&lt;/a&gt; carried his father's hammer proudly. &lt;a href=\"Phin%20Odelic\"&gt;Phin Odelic&lt;/a&gt; studied with a cabal of &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s, and every so often a pair of mages would walk through the town: &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href=\"Helcular\"&gt;Helcular&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; merchant &lt;a href=\"Zixil\"&gt;Zixil&lt;/a&gt; was working on completing his &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20Mark%200\"&gt;Overwatch Mark 0&lt;/a&gt; prototype. In the town hall there were also &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller\"&gt;Nathanos Marris&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Raleigh%20the%20Devout\"&gt;Raleigh the True&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome time after the fall of &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Calia%20Menethil\"&gt;Calia Menethil&lt;/a&gt; took refuge in Southshore where her husband, a Lordaeronian &lt;a href=\"footman\"&gt;footman&lt;/a&gt;, and their daughter had already been living. With everyone assuming she had died to the Scourge, she lived in secret with her family until the town was attacked by the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nSouthshore was a quiet port town and one of the few pockets of human civilization that existed in Lordaeron, maintaining their allegiance to the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. A few survivors of the Third War and adventurers called this town home. In fact, some of its residents used to be members of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Merideth%20Carlson\"&gt;Merideth Carlson&lt;/a&gt; raved on about her new invention: a special horse feed that could nourish spiritual horses. &lt;a href=\"Chef%20Jessen\"&gt;Chef Jessen&lt;/a&gt; was renowned for his &lt;a href=\"%3ASoothing%20Turtle%20Bisque\"&gt;:Soothing Turtle Bisque&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bartolo%20Ginsetti\"&gt;Bartolo Ginsetti&lt;/a&gt; sold his famous &lt;a href=\"Yeti%20Fur%20Cloak\"&gt;Yeti Fur Cloak&lt;/a&gt;s. In terms of threats, &lt;a href=\"Marshal%20Redpath\"&gt;Marshal Redpath&lt;/a&gt; tasked one of his &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20Farren%20Orinelle\"&gt;men&lt;/a&gt; to take care of the local &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; in the area. Redpath himself would employ Alliance adventurers to hunt the &lt;a href=\"Crushridge\"&gt;Crushridge&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s settling in the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac Mountains&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey also had problems with the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Tarren%20Mill\"&gt;Tarren Mill&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Syndicate\"&gt;Syndicate&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Durnholde%20Keep\"&gt;Durnholde Keep&lt;/a&gt; stealing their horses and shipments of crystals. &lt;a href=\"Sergeant%20Hartman\"&gt;Sergeant Hartman&lt;/a&gt; could attest that Southshore's animosity with the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; could get pretty heated during the &lt;a href=\"Hallow%27s%20End\"&gt;Hallow's End&lt;/a&gt; festival as the Forsaken would antagonize the residents with stink bombs. &lt;a href=\"Magistrate%20Henry%20Maleb\"&gt;Magistrate Henry Maleb&lt;/a&gt; seemed convinced that the Syndicate were scheming Southshore's destruction and had previously assassinated the former magistrate. Maleb requested aid from any adventurer to help in Southshore's retaliation. &lt;a href=\"Phin%20Odelic\"&gt;Phin Odelic&lt;/a&gt; sent adventurers to aid his companions in investigating hints of the &lt;a href=\"New%20Plague\"&gt;Forsaken Plague&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands\"&gt;Arathi Highlands&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Loremaster%20Dibbs\"&gt;Loremaster Dibbs&lt;/a&gt; tried to preserve lost knowledge for the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Library\"&gt;Royal Library&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Hillsbrad\"&gt;Battle for Hillsbrad&lt;/a&gt; eventually escalated into a battleground between the towns of Southshore and &lt;a href=\"Tarren%20Mill\"&gt;Tarren Mill&lt;/a&gt;. Alliance &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s from Southshore and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; adventurers from Tarren Mill frequently clashed in full-blown skirmishes in this notorious conflict. This can be seen with &lt;a href=\"Novice%20Thaivand\"&gt;Novice Thaivand&lt;/a&gt; who directs adventurers to resurrect &lt;a href=\"Helcular\"&gt;Helcular&lt;/a&gt;, who proceeds to battle the inhabitants of Southshore before either being driven off or fleeing from the town.\nThe goblin &lt;a href=\"Zixil\"&gt;Zixil&lt;/a&gt; and his robotic guardian &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20Mark%20I\"&gt;Overwatch Mark I&lt;/a&gt; were trading with Southshore and Tarren Mill during this time.\nBlood Runs Thicker.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Faire\"&gt;Darkmoon Faire&lt;/a&gt; arrived in town, the Fallrook brothers started causing troubles when they started to tease &lt;a href=\"Kerri%20Hicks\"&gt;Kerri Hicks&lt;/a&gt;. When Kerri embarrassed the two, &lt;a href=\"Cedrick%20Fallrook\"&gt;Cedrick Fallrook&lt;/a&gt; sought revenge by falsifying evidence to convict her of his brother's murder and had &lt;a href=\"Marcus%20Redpath\"&gt;Marcus Redpath&lt;/a&gt; arrest her.\nAlways taking care of his family, &lt;a href=\"Silas%20Darkmoon\"&gt;Silas Darkmoon&lt;/a&gt; went on his own investigation to find the truth. Being unable to prove her innocence, they broke her out of Southshore's jail and would have had a confrontation with Marcus and his men if it wasn't for &lt;a href=\"Yebb%20Neblegear\"&gt;Yebb Neblegear&lt;/a&gt; finding the witness &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Hamelspot\"&gt;Peter Hamelspot&lt;/a&gt;. Peter explained that Cedrick was the true killer of his brother.\nWith nothing but a bad reputation, Cedrick's father gave his son money to get out of town. Unfortunately, he was caught up by the Darkmoon Faire and they buried him alive in his brother's coffin.\nOld Southshore.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt;, adventurers were transported to an &lt;a href=\"Old%20Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;old Hillsbrad&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 seven years in the past, and were tasked to help preserve the timeline by aiding a young &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; escape from his cruel masters at &lt;a href=\"Durnholde%20Keep\"&gt;Durnholde Keep&lt;/a&gt;. The area featured many characters in their youth, including the future &lt;a href=\"Ashbringer/Old%20Hillsbrad%20Ashbringer%20event\"&gt;founders of the Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt;.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nShortly before the &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20Invasion%20%28Stormwind%29\"&gt;Scourge Invasion&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; launched simultaneous attacks on &lt;a href=\"Goldshire\"&gt;Goldshire&lt;/a&gt; and Southshore.\nCataclysm.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, Southshore remained a part of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; until it was destroyed by the Forsaken on the orders of &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, who used their &lt;a href=\"New%20Plague\"&gt;Forsaken Blight&lt;/a&gt; on the town, leaving it &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Southshore\"&gt;blighted and in ruins&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Refugee\"&gt;surviving residents&lt;/a&gt; and their &lt;a href=\"Refugee%20Leadership\"&gt;leadership&lt;/a&gt; eventually fled to &lt;a href=\"Fenris%20Isle\"&gt;Fenris Isle&lt;/a&gt; in neighboring &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt;, but they were pursued and hunted down by &lt;a href=\"Agatha\"&gt;Agatha&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s on the orders of &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, who raised some of them into &lt;a href=\"undeath\"&gt;undeath&lt;/a&gt;. At &lt;a href=\"Fenris%20Keep\"&gt;Fenris Keep&lt;/a&gt;, most of the Southshore leaders became &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Worgen\"&gt;Hillsbrad Worgen&lt;/a&gt; after drinking the blood of &lt;a href=\"Ivar%20Bloodfang\"&gt;Ivar Bloodfang&lt;/a&gt; and the other worgen leaders, rendering themselves immune to &lt;a href=\"undeath\"&gt;undeath&lt;/a&gt; and joining forces with the &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20Liberation%20Front\"&gt;Gilneas Liberation Front&lt;/a&gt; to retake &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gilneas\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; for the Alliance. The worgen continued to make their blood offering to every surviving human in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, resulting in hundreds of new recruits to bolster their ranks, and they openly fought with the Forsaken forces afterwards.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Raleigh%20the%20Devout\"&gt;Raleigh the Devout&lt;/a&gt;, who survived the destruction of Southshore, returned to clear it of the blight with a cadre of &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s. The &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; tried to enrage the blight creatures to disrupt their efforts. The Alliance troops blew up the Horde &lt;a href=\"apothecary\"&gt;apothecary&lt;/a&gt; experiments about weaponizing the &lt;a href=\"New%20Plague\"&gt;blight&lt;/a&gt; infecting the ruins and encountered &lt;a href=\"Master%20Apothecary%20Faranell\"&gt;Master Apothecary Faranell&lt;/a&gt;.\nExploring Azeroth.\nFollowing the armistice, several years after its destruction, Southshore has been reclaimed from the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; by the Alliance who are undergoing the process of cleaning up the remaining threats.\nSignificance.\nFor the lower-level Alliance players (those not seasoned enough to dare entering the Western and Eastern Plaguelands), Southshore was one of two of the northernmost Alliance havens \u2014 the other being &lt;a href=\"Aerie%20Peak\"&gt;Aerie Peak&lt;/a&gt;. For utilitarian purposes, Southshore far outstripped Aerie Peak considering the array of its services and its location as well as being the drop-off point for players beginning the long trek on foot to the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Monastery\"&gt;Scarlet Monastery&lt;/a&gt;. But it was far less safe, sometimes being the location of raids going between the town and its Horde counterpart, Tarren Mill, to the north.\nAn NPC &lt;a href=\"quest%20giver\"&gt;quest giver&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Marshal%20Redpath\"&gt;Marshal Redpath&lt;/a&gt; stood outside the &lt;a href=\"Southshore%20Town%20Hall\"&gt;Southshore Town Hall&lt;/a&gt;. It is unknown if he was related to the Redpaths whose history is so interlaced with the Eastern Plaguelands. Inside the inn, &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20Farren%20Orinelle\"&gt;Lieutenant Farren Orinelle&lt;/a&gt; mocked Redpath for telling him to take care of the local &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt;s.\nQuests.\nA number of quests involving the &lt;a href=\"Syndicate\"&gt;Syndicate&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac Mountains&lt;/a&gt; started in Southshore. Also, a few quests that could be found at the inn involved killing the nearby &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn The Burning Crusade.\nIn \"\" expansion, adventurers are transported to the past to help preserve the timeline by aiding a young &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;. Instead of heading straight to Durnholde, however, players may explore a portion of Hillsbrad, including both Tarren Mill and Southshore.\nWith the town's destruction in \"\", this is now the only way to see the town as it was in pre-\"Cataclysm\".\nWarcraft II demo.\nIn the \"\" demo, the second Alliance level called &lt;a href=\"Southshore%20%28WC2%20demo%29\"&gt;Southshore&lt;/a&gt; is an early version of the retail's &lt;a href=\"Southshore%20%28WC2%20Human%29\"&gt;Southshore mission&lt;/a&gt;. The retail version reused some of the text from the earlier version of the mission briefing but was modified. For example, the reason for the construction of the Southshore naval facilities is a bit different in the two versions of the mission. The retail versions of the missions also have redesigned maps. Note that the \"Tides of Darkness\" demo represents missions from an early version of the game (perhaps the beta version) left out of the released game and later released lore. Some of the ideas evolved into the different maps seen in the released version of the game.\nIn the demo map, you start on one small island and take over a much smaller island. In the Alliance level called Southshore, you attack from Southshore to that much smaller island. The islands described in the demo version of the mission appear south of the Southshore region. While the islands in the demo are not given names, these may have developed into the idea of the &lt;a href=\"Channel%20Islands\"&gt;Channel Islands&lt;/a&gt; or the region near &lt;a href=\"Tol%20Barad\"&gt;Tol Barad&lt;/a&gt;, which is southeast of Southshore (Tol Barad is shown to have at least two islands according to manual map). The demo mission maps for Southshore show the islands as being to the southwest and very near Southshore's shore. However, the \"Warcraft II\" battle maps, like most maps in \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" games, are not necessarily to actual scale. The &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; map only shows a single island east of the Southshore dot (the dot may represent the general area of the region or the township). It may be possible that this island may correspond to these \"islands\".\nWhile not directly related, the \"Tides of Darkness\" mission map of the third &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; level, called \"&lt;a href=\"Southshore%20%28WC2%20Orc%29\"&gt;Southshore&lt;/a&gt;\", shows at least two islands located in a similar configuration. The orcs were gathering oil from a hidden location on these islands, in order to fuel ships participating in the final attack on &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Fields\"&gt;Hillsbrad&lt;/a&gt;. See for more information.\nIn the RPG.\nSouthshore is a port that serves as the chief &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; base on the southern &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt; coast. It is known for its sea turtles, which are a delicacy. Though only a small town, Southshore is the largest settlement in the whole Hillsbrad region. A small Alliance garrison berthed within and does its best to drive the &lt;a href=\"Syndicate\"&gt;Syndicate&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; forces from their land while protecting &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;'s southern regions from the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; in the north. They do a good job with their few forces, and the nearby farms thrive. Southshore's town council takes an active role in all things, and &lt;a href=\"Magistrate%20Henry%20Maleb\"&gt;Magistrate Henry Maleb&lt;/a&gt; is a particularly driven and wise man. Maleb and &lt;a href=\"Marshal%20Redpath\"&gt;Marshal Redpath&lt;/a&gt;, the Alliance commander, are consumed with fights against &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt;s.\nIn addition to its role as an Alliance military base, Southshore is Hillsbrad's mercantile center. The town's small privateer fleet keeps the waterways clear, allowing ships to dock at the town's harbor and keep the economy strong.\nThe relations between &lt;a href=\"Aretain%20Naris\"&gt;Aretain Naris&lt;/a&gt; and Southshore are similar to those between him and &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Fields\"&gt;Hillsbrad&lt;/a&gt;, except that the hatred is reduced by distance. Aretain's men view the people of Southshore as arrogant city-folk \"from that smelly fishport.\"\nSouthshore is also one of the few existing relics of the once-great human nation of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. With the remains of the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; and the kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt;, Southshore is one of the few Alliance-controlled towns left in Lordaeron. The people there celebrate &lt;a href=\"Hordefall\"&gt;Hordefall&lt;/a&gt; in memory of the defeat of the Horde in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Jack%20%28human%29\"&gt;Jack&lt;/a&gt; lived in a &lt;a href=\"Farm\"&gt;farm&lt;/a&gt; near Southshore.\nSpeculation.\nWith &lt;a href=\"Weldon%20Barov\"&gt;Weldon Barov&lt;/a&gt; still alive and affiliated with the Alliance as of the events of &lt;a href=\"alternate%20Draenor\"&gt;alternate Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, and further described as true heir to the House of Barov, he presumably helps strengthen the Alliance's current sovereign claim over Southshore with &lt;a href=\"The%20Deed%20to%20Southshore\"&gt;The Deed to Southshore&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Magistrate%20Henry%20Maleb\"&gt;Magistrate Henry Maleb&lt;/a&gt; was last seen in &lt;a href=\"Shadowfang%20Keep\"&gt;Shadowfang Keep&lt;/a&gt; as a worgen, still affiliated with the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Stormwind\"&gt;Kingdom of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; and the Alliance, but his current status and whereabouts after the &lt;a href=\"Bloodfang%20Pack\"&gt;Bloodfang Pack&lt;/a&gt; managed to reclaim it from the Forsaken, is unknown."}

As a show of their support, a mighty fleet of &lt;a href=\"Destroyer%23Elven%20destroyer\"&gt;Elven Destroyers&lt;/a&gt; have been sent to help safeguard the &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; mainland. In preparation for the arrival of these ships, &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Daelin Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; - Lord of &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Admiral\"&gt;Grand Admiral&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20navy\"&gt;Lordaeron Fleet&lt;/a&gt; - has ordered that you begin the construction of naval facilities near the township of &lt;a href=\"Southshore\"&gt;Southshore&lt;/a&gt;. There is some suspicion that the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; has constructed a secret base near the mainland, so it is imperative that you begin building your defense with haste.\"\nBackground.\nThe troops and &lt;a href=\"Milan\"&gt;Milan&lt;/a&gt;'s first task on arrival was to build another &lt;a href=\"Farm\"&gt;farm&lt;/a&gt; to feed the larger number of workers and sailors that would soon arrive. Next, they set the workers to collecting materials from the &lt;a href=\"gold%20mine\"&gt;gold mine&lt;/a&gt; nearby and continued training new &lt;a href=\"peasant\"&gt;peasant&lt;/a&gt;s as fast as their resources permitted. The &lt;a href=\"Destroyer%23Elven%20destroyer\"&gt;destroyer&lt;/a&gt; on which they had arrived remained in place to guard the shoreline; the soldiers stayed near camp, since &lt;a href=\"Spy\"&gt;spies&lt;/a&gt; had confirmed reports of an enemy base offshore. Rather than risk an encounter, they decided to build up as quickly and quietly as possible. Once they had five workers in the mine and a small amount of gold saved up, they constructed a &lt;a href=\"Lumber%20mill%23Elven%20lumber%20mill\"&gt;lumber mill&lt;/a&gt; from the wood on hand and still had enough for another farm. The troops were unhappy not to have a &lt;a href=\"barracks\"&gt;barracks&lt;/a&gt;, but they were planning a naval assault and, therefore, trained still more workers to gather wood for processing in the new mill. No enemies had been spotted yet, but they knew they were about.\nAfter several days of gathering &lt;a href=\"lumber\"&gt;lumber&lt;/a&gt;, they began construction of the shipyard on the shore to the east of their camp. On the night before it was completed, a small boat carrying shipwrights and sailors emerged from the mist above the waves. They were lucky to have come through alive. The troops gladly provided with whatever building materials they needed, and soon they had christened their first &lt;a href=\"oil%20tanker\"&gt;oil tanker&lt;/a&gt;. It was a shoddy contraption, held together with pine tar and luck, but it managed to ferry enough supplies to build an oil platform nearby to the east. They built a second tanker soon after, and a steady flow of &lt;a href=\"Oil\"&gt;black gold&lt;/a&gt; was soon filling their oak barrels as fast as they could make them. At the same time, more farms were being built to feed the growing population of workers, who easily outnumbered the troops stationed there. They were all much relieved when construction of new destroyers began, because they still had not enough time or resources to build a barracks. With the surplus of workers gathering materials, they built five warships in a matter of weeks. With this powerful fleet, they first moved along the coastline northeast and nicely exploded a troll spy. Keeping this in mind, they then swept westward and secured the coast in that direction. At the western edge of the coast, they steered directly south toward the horizon and quickly spotted two enemy &lt;a href=\"Destroyer%23Troll%20destroyer\"&gt;destroyers&lt;/a&gt; guarding one of their own platforms. These they sank effortlessly; then they gave their platform the same treatment. From there they sailed east and spotted more destroyers around a small island. Those they sank below the waves first; then they opened fire on the structures and enemies on the island. When the smoke from their &lt;a href=\"cannon\"&gt;cannon&lt;/a&gt;s cleared, all that remained was scattered debris.\nThe column of smoke on the horizon prompted the remaining orcs on the mainland to attempt a raid, but even the few troops guarding the camp were able to stop them. From there it was only a matter of time before they built three more platforms \u2014 just in time for the approaching flotilla of warships that would soon transform their camp into a busy seaport. Milan's troops were not present to see it, however, since new orders took them elsewhere as usual.\nVideo.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

The Horde needed this to process boards and masts for new &lt;a href=\"Boat\"&gt;ships&lt;/a&gt;, and to supply the materials needed for a shipyard. The soldiers practiced beating each other to relieve boredom, for the humans had yet to show themselves.\nOnce construction of the shipyard had commenced, they sent the &lt;a href=\"Destroyer%23Troll%20destroyer\"&gt;destroyer&lt;/a&gt; that had brought them to the island, to survey the rest of the area. It found several human &lt;a href=\"Spy\"&gt;spies&lt;/a&gt; hiding in the tree line east of the camp, and easily blew them into tiny bits before returning to the shipyard. The Horde spotted several enemy ships and structures around a smaller island to the northeast, and with a growing number of workers and farm to feed their sailors, they soon launched their first &lt;a href=\"oil%20tanker\"&gt;oil tanker&lt;/a&gt; to build a platform over a convenient patch of &lt;a href=\"Oil\"&gt;dark sludge&lt;/a&gt; nearby to the southwest. With this, they could also begin building more destroyers to clear the way for more platforms. Four tankers quickly provided the oil required to launch four more destroyers; they sent these northward in a tight flotilla. The humans were completely unprepared, having no spies left to report to them, and the Horde laid waste to their work step-by-step. With five warships against no more than two enemy ships at a time, the task of clearing the seas was easy. Horde tankers then moved in to replace the human platforms they had obliterated. Plans were made to conduct a final amphibious raid on Hillsbrad.\nAlternate text.\nThe adds another paragraph to the mission briefing, which never appeared in the actual game:\n\"The seas are rich with this substance; your Oil Tankers will need to build Platforms where it is thick.

It is only available for a limited time, although it may return again at a later point. The battleground is available in two brackets: level 100, and levels 90-99.\nAs well as the usual currencies, winning the battleground will reward a faction-specific &lt;a href=\"title\"&gt;title&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Tarren%20Mill%20Terror\"&gt;Tarren Mill Terror&lt;/a&gt; for Alliance players and &lt;a href=\"Southshore%20Slayer\"&gt;Southshore Slayer&lt;/a&gt; for Horde players.\nWhile \"World of Warcraft\" has already seen two 40v40 battlegrounds - &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Valley\"&gt;Alterac Valley&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Conquest\"&gt;Isle of Conquest&lt;/a&gt; - Southshore vs Tarren Mill is the first purely PvP-oriented battleground larger than 15v15.\nAvailability.\nThe battleground will be available for a limited time. The exact length of the availability window has not been stated, but it will be more than a week. Depending on the battleground's success, it may return again as an anniversary event or similar.\nThe battleground's limited availability is due to the developers' belief that if left permanently available it would actually become a negative experience, with players becoming tired of the relatively simple nature of the battleground. This is due to its gameplay being \"just like the old days...a long slow deathmatch grind\", with the developers stating that they \"aren't trying to fix any of the problems of the old experience\", acknowledging that the battleground may present a flawed experience. The developers hope that by making the battleground a seasonal option, it will provide a fresh and different battleground experience for a limited period.\nRanks.\nAs players earn &lt;a href=\"honorable%20kill\"&gt;honorable kill&lt;/a&gt;s, they increase in rank. The higher rank the player, the more points they are worth to kill, with each increase in rank increasing the points gained from killing that player by the same amount. For example, a Rank 10 player will be worth 10 points, while a Rank 1 player will only be worth 1. However, Rank 0 players are also worth 1 point. The system has been announced to go up to Rank 14. Players start at Rank 0 - Recruit.\nRank also provides an X% increase to healing and damage done, and player health. The bonus appears to be equal to the number of the rank, eg Rank 1 - Scout increases damage, healing and health by 1%.\nEach player has a buff indicating their current rank, and the amount of points gained from killing targets is displayed in floating combat text when they are killed. Players lose rank each time they die.\nMaximum rank is intended to be \"pretty easy\" to reach. By requiring &lt;a href=\"honorable%20kill\"&gt;honorable kill&lt;/a&gt;s and not &lt;a href=\"killing%20blow\"&gt;killing blow&lt;/a&gt;s, players are able to gain rank through participation such as healing.\nRank comes in the form of a buff, and will be lost at the end of the battleground. \nThe battleground uses similar ranks to the game's &lt;a href=\"Honor_system_%28pre-2.0%29%23Ranks_and_rewards\"&gt;original honor system&lt;/a&gt;. However, the battleground's ranks will not replace actual character ranks from the original system, and there are no plans for participation to unlock titles or gear from that system. The developers have stated that there are no plans for a return of the honor system.\nRank list.\nThe following table lists the available ranks for each faction. Earning each rank takes a further 10 honorable kills. Honorable kills listed below are the total number required to reach that rank.\nNote that the total number of honorable kills required, and the % bonuses to damage, healing and health are estimated, based on the numbers for the lower ranks.\nFor information on the original ranking system on which these ranks are based, see &lt;a href=\"Honor%20system%20%28pre-2.0%29%23Ranks%20and%20rewards\"&gt;Honor system (pre-2.0)#Ranks and rewards&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nThe battleground is based on \"&lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Hillsbrad\"&gt;the timeless struggle&lt;/a&gt;\" between &lt;a href=\"Tarren%20Mill\"&gt;Tarren Mill&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Southshore\"&gt;Southshore&lt;/a&gt;.\nTrivia.\nOriginally announced as \"Tarren Mill vs Southshore\", by the time the battleground was added to the game, the title had been rearranged as \"Southshore vs Tarren Mill\". The latter ordering is used in-game when queuing for the event. However, the original title can still be seen in the battleground map available during matches.\nWhen the battleground was first released, it required 10,000 points to win, and had a maximum duration of 60 minutes. Around 12 hours after the battleground first went live, the points requirement was lowered to 300, and the duration halved to 30 minutes. This appears to have been in response to player feedback, reflecting difficulties with the arbitrary score objective and excessively long matches, which were easily aborted at the last moment by players on the losing team leaving in advance, forcing the battleground to close and denying the victors their rewards.\nA team deathmatch-style battleground was an idea first experimented with in the cancelled &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20Catacombs\"&gt;Gurubashi Catacombs&lt;/a&gt;. The idea was eventually reformulated in the advent of the &lt;a href=\"Arena\"&gt;Arena&lt;/a&gt; system. At the time, several reasons were given for the cancellation of the battleground, including \"Deathmatch doesn't work as well in WoW PvP\".\nThe developers looked into transforming players' appearance within the battleground to display appropriate vanilla PvP gear corresponding to their rank, but the idea was found to be too great an undertaking.\nWhen creating the zone for the battleground, the developers were unable to reuse the old data from the actual world zone of &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Matt%20Sanders\"&gt;Matt Sanders&lt;/a&gt;, the level designer who created the original zone, and subsequently recreated it for the &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt; instance, was therefore enlisted to create the zone for a third time. The Caverns of Time version was used as a base, with buildings and NPCs replaced with those of the original zone.\nThe battleground was originally planned to be a 100v100 encounter. Senior PvP Designer Brian Holinka even stated at one point that the developers would \"cram as many people in there as we can\". However, in September 2014 it was announced that the battleground would in fact be limited to 80 players in total, with Holinka stating \"Our battlegrounds are not setup to support more than 40 per side.\""}

The exact form of such messages may vary from server to server. Often, one person may post a single message in a channel and others will reply with variations. They may be viewed as harmless or entertaining community building activities, or as \"trolling\" that is irritating or outright harmful to gameplay due to the distraction from intended use of the chat. Three of the most common memes are:\nE-mail spam.\nThe existence of e-mail spam, messages sent to many recipients at once by advertisers or hackers, is well known outside of \"World of Warcraft\", and many e-mail services offer filters to remove such messages. Some spam e-mails specifically target \"World of Warcraft\" users, so customers are well advised to be aware of possible spam e-mails.\n&lt;a href=\"Phishing\"&gt;Phishing&lt;/a&gt; attempts can occur via e-mail, and Blizzard has &lt;a href=\"https%3A//us.battle.net/support/en/article/phishing\"&gt;a web page&lt;/a&gt; devoted to avoiding these attacks. Never share account information over e-mail, and be careful following links from e-mails. It is best to always verify that the message is from battle.net or blizzard.com by checking the message header, or simply go to the website by another route, either following a known bookmark or typing in the URL manually.\nGold sellers and other illegal services may send advertisements via e-mail. As with such requests received via in-game chat, use of these services can not only result in account suspension, but open up an account to hacking attempts.\nAbility spam.\nSometimes, repeatedly using the same spell or ability in combat is called \"spam\". A fire Mage might be accused of \"spamming Scorch\", a Shaman of \"spamming Frost Shock\" or a Druid of \"spamming Moonfire\". Spammed spells are usually instant cast or have a low cast time.\nThe term can also be used to describe \"correct\" use of a \"filler\" ability or to emphasize a tactical point, depending on class design; for instance \"spam &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Fire\"&gt;Soul Fire&lt;/a&gt; once the boss is below 25%\" or \"spam &lt;a href=\"Heroic%20Strike\"&gt;Heroic Strike&lt;/a&gt; for six seconds\" would mean to increase the priority of those abilities at those times, but \"not\" at the exclusion of everything else (which is usually what is meant when the term is used negatively).\nThe use of this term for combat actions may stem from situations where the &lt;a href=\"combat%20log\"&gt;combat log&lt;/a&gt; records the use of repeated abilities, resulting in a chat window full of identical messages, much the same as would result from intense social spamming.\nHistory and origin.\nThe term \"spam\" comes from a sketch where patrons order from a menu where nearly every course rattled off contains , a type of processed meat. At several points, they are interrupted by vikings singing the praise of SPAM. This joke itself is a reference to the exclusion of SPAM from World War II rationing regulations, implying many British citizens likely became sick of eating SPAM.\nSpam has been used as the butt of jokes for many years. Comedian described Spam (the food) as, \"Stuff Posing As Meat.\"\nNote that \"SPAM\" is a registered trademark of a type of processed meat. Lowercase \"spam\", or \"Spam\" with the first letter capitalized, is what we use when talking about pointless and/or unwanted text."}

The Sparks of Tyr can record events and replay them within the minds of others.\nHistory.\nDawn of the Aspects.\nDuring the era just after the Ordering of Azeroth, as &lt;a href=\"Tyr\"&gt;Tyr&lt;/a&gt; rallied a force to battle the massive &lt;a href=\"Galakrond\"&gt;Galakrond&lt;/a&gt;, he held the Spark of Tyr up to five &lt;a href=\"proto-dragon\"&gt;proto-dragon&lt;/a&gt;s named &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Neltharion\"&gt;Neltharion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt; with the promise that he was \"trying to ensure some future.\" During a battle with Galakrond, the Spark of Tyr was knocked free from Tyr's person and, desperate to grab it, he left himself open for Galakrond to devour his hand, swallowing both it and the Spark.\nA &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; mage named &lt;a href=\"Rulfo\"&gt;Rulfo&lt;/a&gt; would later find a Spark of Tyr and receive visions of the earliest era of Azeroth. The visions eventually drove Rulfo mad, and his mangled body was found dead one day. The reports say he fell off a mountain.\nMany thousands of years later, &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; found the same Spark of Tyr that Galakrond devoured clutched in Tyr's severed hand at &lt;a href=\"Galakrond%27s%20Rest\"&gt;Galakrond's Rest&lt;/a&gt;. The Spark granted Kalec visions from Malygos's point of view of the events surrounding Galakrond and the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt; but risked driving him insane in doing so. Eventually, after overcoming the Spark with the help of &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, Kalec used it to show Alexstrasza, Nozdormu, and Ysera - who had become depressed following their becoming mortal with Deathwing's defeat - the moment of their first glory. Afterward, Alexstrasza took the spark with her.\nLegion.\nSparks of Tyr are needed to release the magical wards holding Tyr's hammer, &lt;a href=\"The%20Silver%20Hand%20%28artifact%29\"&gt;The Silver Hand (artifact)&lt;/a&gt;, within the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Tyr\"&gt;Tomb of Tyr&lt;/a&gt; beneath &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Travard\"&gt;Travard&lt;/a&gt; sent a &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; to Dragonblight to locate &lt;a href=\"Galford\"&gt;Galford&lt;/a&gt;, who had another Spark and had gone north to learn more about Tyr. Galford was killed by &lt;a href=\"Jotun\"&gt;Jotun&lt;/a&gt;, Tyr's old friend who had been cursed by &lt;a href=\"Loken\"&gt;Loken&lt;/a&gt;, but not before he had succeeded in using the Spark to see memories of Jotun aiding Tyr.

Despite their recklessness, goblins are among the foremost and greatest alchemists on the planet. While explosives and gunpowder are common alchemical staples, goblins also experiment in other fields. Perhaps the most shocking of their experiments is their rare mutagenic work. &lt;a href=\"Kezan\"&gt;Kezan&lt;/a&gt; has its small handful of strange and mutated creatures, the rejects of failed goblin experiments. They\u2019ve even experimented on their own kind, creating the stupid but strong hobgoblins. Almost all members of the subrace are kept in &lt;a href=\"Undermine\"&gt;Undermine&lt;/a&gt;'s halls. As large as an orc and resembling a bulky purple goblin, &lt;a href=\"hobgoblin\"&gt;hobgoblin&lt;/a&gt;s are alchemically created for strength and simplicity, despite their physical and emotional instability.\nThese goblin alchemists sometimes grant their explosive and chemical warfare to the highest bidder. \nGoblins have been practicing alchemy for centuries (if not longer), and it is an art that appeals to their off-kilter minds. They are the most likely to become &lt;a href=\"arcane%20alchemist\"&gt;arcane alchemist&lt;/a&gt;s.

Yet the innovations that goblins have brought to the design of shoes for adventuring are undeniable. Goblin army boots take the design ethos of the &lt;a href=\"goblin%20army%20knife\"&gt;goblin army knife&lt;/a&gt; and apply it to military footwear.\nGoblin army boots are sturdy leather boots that strap up to the knee. The heels are very thick, lending another 6 inches to the height of anyone wearing a pair. Contained within the heels of the boots are a number of devices that aid in jumping and traversing difficult terrain. The wearer can direct the boots to perform several tasks by manipulating a series of toe triggers.\nThe soles of the boots contain several options for negotiating obstacles and terrain. Tightly coiled springs released from the soles grant the wearer a better jump as well as increasing his speed when running with the springs extended. \nAccordion-like stilts extend from the heels, allowing for an additional 7 feet of height, although balance is required to stay upright on the stilts. Using a bellows in the heel, air bladders in each boot inflate to allow a wearer to cross a body of water without getting wet, balance is required to stabilize and stay upright when walking across water.\nFor combat situations, a dagger blade extends from the toe of each boot to provide stopgap weapons in combat.\nThe boots are quite heavy, each weighing approximately 10 pounds. However, this multipurpose footwear is watertight, and custom-fitted to the wearer's feet with a series of adjustable straps and laces (which in dire situations connect to provide 50 feet of strong spider silk line). Sadly, these versatile boots are so heavy that they reduce the speed of the wearer."}

After defeating Trade Prince Gallywix in &lt;a href=\"Final%20Confrontation\"&gt;Final Confrontation&lt;/a&gt;, Thrall forces Gallywix to ally the Bilgewater Cartel with the Horde and sends players to Orgrimmar to meet with the warchief.\nFrom that point on, goblin players are pointed to the &lt;a href=\"Azshara%20storyline\"&gt;Azshara storyline&lt;/a&gt;."}

{"id": "127127", "revid": "39299307", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=127127", "title": "Goblins versus gnomes", "text": "&lt;a href=\"Goblin\"&gt;Goblin&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;s have long had an intense rivalry. This competition has fostered a number of inventions designed specifically to show up the opposition. Nowhere is this better seen than at the racetrack in the &lt;a href=\"Shimmering%20Flats\"&gt;Shimmering Flats&lt;/a&gt;, where the two sides rush endlessly to develop new racing vehicles \u2014 ones with little practical use anywhere else in the world. Gnomes and goblins have always been rivals \u2014 though whether this rivalry is friendly or brutal depends on the individuals involved.\nGoblins.\nGoblins don't have a tremendous number of truly skilled engineers, primarily because they tend to blow themselves up. It\u2019s said that there are old goblins and there are goblin tinkers, but there are no old goblin tinkers. While not one hundred percent accurate, there is truth to this adage. Many goblin inventions are bizarre, or have no apparent use. A goblin often creates things just to see what happens, then discards his creation when he can't think of a way to make money with it. Some of the most well-known devices in the world came from the trash heaps of goblin inventors who didn\u2019t know they had something anybody would have wanted.\nGoblins were once brilliant inventors, but no longer. They once were the definitive name in technology long ago, but now their machines barely run. This doesn't stop the race from playing with technology, however, and goblins run the market in destructive weaponry. They try desperately to maintain their amazing devices, but they\u2019re no longer clever enough to carry out the maintenance properly. They now rely on improvisations and jury-rigs that work only haphazardly. Thus, when a goblin creates, the process might appear to be one part ingenuity and five parts desperate improvisation. Most goblin items look suicidal to use, and rarely work correctly.\nGoblin &lt;a href=\"technology\"&gt;technology&lt;/a&gt; tends to be radical and dangerous, always pushing the ragged edge of feasibility. Goblins have short attention spans as a rule, so if they can\u2019t get something to work right away, they either give up or move on to something else that attracts their attention. Goblin &lt;a href=\"workshop\"&gt;workshop&lt;/a&gt;s are littered with half-finished projects and the scavenged remnants of inventions that didn\u2019t pan out. While this attitude gives them more time to work on new and promising creations, who knows how many potentially valuable projects have been left gathering dust in some back corner?\nGoblins share the gift of technology with gnomes, yet they have a much more sinister and devious method of putting technology to use. Goblins revel in the destructive power of their devices, and their lack of discipline often manifests in unreliability in the field. A goblin inventor is more likely to die using one of his own devices than he is to be killed on the field of war. Notorious for malfunctioning in catastrophic displays of explosive power, goblin technology is better left to those who need a big payoff with substantial risk. The goblin race\u2019s independence makes them a reckless force, with little restraint as to what they are willing to build or create. Luckily goblins have little discipline for research and development unless it produces wealth, and most if not all of the grander experiments they begin are aborted due to sudden interest in another branch of technological development.\nGnomes.\nIn contrast, gnomes overplan new projects, producing blueprints and schematics that can take longer to make than the device itself. While this cautious attitude results in higher quality products and a greater success rate, it often takes so long that cost overruns creep in. While a goblin would scream and flee at the mere thought of a cost overrun, a gnome simply shrugs and presses on. If a project fails to work correctly the first time, a gnome will continue to &lt;a href=\"tinker\"&gt;tinker&lt;/a&gt; with it, while a goblin would usually give up and move to something else. Thus, gnomish items have very low failure rates compared to goblin items.\nGnomes tend to design fairly complicated devices that are relatively safe. Gnomes are in many ways commensurate organizers: a gnome can spend as much time (or more) organizing and planning a project as he/she does actually working on it. If the design fails, he/she tries to learn why, and fixes it if he/she can. If he/she meets with success, he/she as often as not continues to tinker with and improve the design, often for years afterward. Thus, many gnomish designs feature a high degree of complexity and a low chance of failure, the exceptions being those that dabble with &lt;a href=\"chaos%20energy\"&gt;chaos energy&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 but even then, they take steps to ensure the worst that could happen is a brief, non-fatal failure.\nGnomes are innovative thinkers and are responsible for a vast variety of inventions, including more than a few that are commonly attributed to dwarves. Although a diminutive people, gnomes think big, often producing designs far too complex to ever be realized. To gnomes, &lt;a href=\"technology\"&gt;technology&lt;/a&gt; is a way of life. Even gnomes who take on other trades often tinker in their spare time. Because of their innate curiosity, they produce a wide variety of devices that are interesting or amusing but otherwise useless or impractical. While others might shake their heads at such folly, the gnomes value all invention, no matter how unimportant it might seem. Among the well-known gnomish devices are the world enlarger, net-o-matic projector and harm prevention belt.\nRivalry.\nBoth sides scoff at the other as taking the \u201cwrong\u201d attitude towards &lt;a href=\"engineering\"&gt;engineering&lt;/a&gt;. Goblins laugh at the way gnomes spend far more time and money on a project than they\u2019ll ever hope to recoup, while the gnomes shake their heads at the way goblins are always blowing themselves and their laboratories to pieces. Still, both sides have their advantages and disadvantages, so neither can be said to be the right way to do things. Some &lt;a href=\"tinker\"&gt;tinker&lt;/a&gt;s choose to study the ways of gnomish or goblin engineering in more detail, becoming specialists in that race\u2019s way of thinking and designing technological items.\nSomeone may not need to be a goblin or gnome to specialize in that race\u2019s engineering methodology. In fact, it\u2019s not unheard of for a goblin to give up on his dangerous ways and embrace gnomish engineering, or vice versa. So far, the goblin/gnome rivalry has yet to erupt into fighting, but the possibility exists, especially given the resurging presence of goblins within the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Such a technology war would have consequences undreamt of.\nNotable gnome technology.\nThe &lt;a href=\"gnomish%20inventor\"&gt;gnomish inventor&lt;/a&gt;s are highly adept at creating outlandishly clever contraptions for military use. Among the many bizarre inventions created by the &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;s are the &lt;a href=\"flying%20machine\"&gt;flying machine&lt;/a&gt;s that hover high above both land and sea, as well as the implausible &lt;a href=\"Gnomish%20submarine\"&gt;submarine&lt;/a&gt; that can move under the seas. The gnomes are also responsible for perfecting the technique of extracting various chemical compounds out of &lt;a href=\"oil\"&gt;oil&lt;/a&gt; to make gunpowder and explosives. Although the gnomes are a bit odd and eccentric, none can deny their value to the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;."}

Gods can exert influence over several locations simultaneously, but the power of a god is limited.

Nonetheless, an imprisoned, sleeping, or otherwise enfeebled god may still have an effect\u2014conscious or not\u2014on the god's surroundings. Certain gods have even been killed.\nCreation myths.\nSome &lt;a href=\"flavor%20lore\"&gt;believe&lt;/a&gt; that the universe was created as a whole by \"a singular, all-powerful entity\".\nGod was said to have been revered by the &lt;a href=\"Brotherhood%20of%20Northshire\"&gt;Clerics of Northshire&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Abbot%20of%20Northshire%20Abbey\"&gt;Abbot of Northshire Abbey&lt;/a&gt; believed that the archangels took up swords of light to defend the heavens and that God is able to see in an all-encompassing fashion. He sees the world with extreme clarity, and only a fraction of the power would blind a human. During the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, churches sang \"Deo Gratias\" (), Latin for \"Thanks [be] to God\". Even after the Second War a &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knight of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href=\"Duncan%20Senturus\"&gt;Duncan Senturus&lt;/a&gt; believed in a higher power that could choose paths for people, and believed evil actions were ungodly.\nIn contrast, the high elf &lt;a href=\"Milan\"&gt;Milan&lt;/a&gt; spoke during the Second War not of the belief in the creator \"God\", but of an entire pantheon called \"the gods\". He mentions believing in these gods, praying to the gods, and receiving help from them. He speaks of his allies praying to the gods, and the gods answering their prayers.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Moon\"&gt;Temple of the Moon&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt; had frescoes and murals depicting &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt; and many other gods (actual gods, not &lt;a href=\"demigod\"&gt;demigod&lt;/a&gt;s) shaping the world.\nDescribed as god or goddess.\nImportant notes: \nDemigods.\nDemigods are part god, part other. The demigods of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; wield great power and have occasionally played pivotal roles in the planet's history, one example of this being &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;. Nevertheless, unlike gods, most demigods have never been the objects of worship. Few demigods have temples built in their honor. Priesthoods based on the worship of a demigod are extremely rare.\nLike gods, demigods are immortal and are neither omniscient nor omnipotent."}

As a rare substance that is always in short supply, &lt;a href=\"Gold\"&gt;Gold&lt;/a&gt; must be dug out from the rock and soil within the established Gold Mines. Many of these Mines were abandoned when the &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt; raids began and the workers fled for their lives. Since the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;War&lt;/a&gt;, these sites have frequently been operated while under the protection of military forces.\nGold is mined in different ways depending on the various races of the game. &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Humans&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Orcs&lt;/a&gt; respectively send &lt;a href=\"peasant\"&gt;peasant&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"peon\"&gt;peon&lt;/a&gt;s to carry Gold from the Mine to their &lt;a href=\"town%20hall\"&gt;town hall&lt;/a&gt;s. The &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Night Elves&lt;/a&gt;' &lt;a href=\"Tree%20of%20Life%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Tree of Life&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Entangled%20Gold%20Mine%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;entangles&lt;/a&gt; the Gold Mine and drains the Gold out of it with the use of &lt;a href=\"wisp\"&gt;wisp&lt;/a&gt; workers. The &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Undead&lt;/a&gt; uses &lt;a href=\"acolyte\"&gt;acolyte&lt;/a&gt;s to mine Gold from Mines once they are &lt;a href=\"Haunted%20Gold%20Mine%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;haunted&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere is a \"Gold tax\" in place, known as &lt;a href=\"Upkeep\"&gt;Upkeep&lt;/a&gt; which is activated as players create more units. As the Upkeep increases, less Gold is recovered from the Gold Mine. A way to gain additional Gold is to take over additional Gold Mines to help balance this tax out.\nIn \"Warcraft\" maps, all players start with a gold mine near their starting point, and any &lt;a href=\"creep\"&gt;creep&lt;/a&gt;s that would be there are removed in a set radius around the starting position to prevent them from immediately attacking upon spawning. Other gold mines are found across the map guarded by a various assortment of creeps, usually a single high-leveled monster with numerous lower-leveled monsters accompanying them. \nThe default amount of gold a gold mine starts with is 12,500. Depending on map type, the mine may also have more gold, which is usually dependent on the strength of the creeps protecting the mine. The value can be edited on the &lt;a href=\"World%20Editor\"&gt;World Editor&lt;/a&gt;. When a mine has 1,500 gold left, the game will notify the player of the mine(s) running low. Once the mine hits 0, the mine automatically collapses, stopping all workers that were collecting gold there. In the case of haunted gold mines, an acolyte will immediately unsummon it."}

The description \"Chinese gold farmer\" is often used, as many of these players are Chinese (though recent magazine articles have placed the majority blame on Indonesia). This was strongly suggested when gold selling websites ran out of gold during the , their employees presumably having gone on vacation.\nGold farmers then take this money and attempt to sell it to other people through several websites and auctions in exchange for real-world money. This is against the &lt;a href=\"Terms%20of%20Service\"&gt;Terms of Service&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"Blizzard\"&gt;Blizzard&lt;/a&gt; considers all gold and items in game to be its property. Such gold farmers are frequently banned from the game. However, completely getting rid of them is nearly impossible, because they can just buy a new copy of the game and create a new &lt;a href=\"account\"&gt;account&lt;/a&gt;. The recent addition of the \"report spam\" feature helps player to report farmers who advertise in-game. Some players have also taken on a policy of &lt;a href=\"griefing\"&gt;griefing&lt;/a&gt; gold farmers. \nGold farmers are commonly considered \"greedy\", and will frequently be labeled as a &lt;a href=\"loot%20ninja\"&gt;loot ninja&lt;/a&gt;, or act plain antisocial. Often they do not speak the native server language, or have only memorized a select few sentences, thus making it harder to effectively communicate with them in game.\nThe problem has become so great that some sites which hold user-made interface enhancements have begun listing add-ons specifically designed to catch such whispers, filter them out from being displayed to the player, make a GM ticket and send it automatically.\nGold farming in America.\nRecent attempts at cost-effective gold farming have begun in America. A number of US-based gold suppliers for \"World of Warcraft\" have formed a vast network of college and professional gamers, such as Forsaken Farmers. In their spare time, these gamers farm gold and &lt;a href=\"power%20level\"&gt;power level&lt;/a&gt; customer accounts. In turn, they receive such benefits as free time cards, accounts, gold, power leveling services and even cash. These gamers are instructed to follow all in-game rules and refrain from using gold farming techniques such as bots, macros and hacks which are frowned upon in the gaming world. American-based gold farmers are far less common than ones located in Asia, simply because of the abundance of cheap labor in Asia.\nGold farming in China.\nAccording to estimates, around 100,000 people in China are employed as gold farmers, as of December 2005. This represents about 0.4% of all online gamers in China. Chinese gold farmers typically work twelve hour shifts, and sometimes up to eighteen hour shifts. Wages depend heavily on location and the size of the gold farming company. One gold farming operation in Chongqing in central China with 23 gold farmers was reported to pay its employees the equivalent of about 120 U.S. dollars per month, while workers at a larger gold farm in Fuzhou earn the equivalent of about 250 U.S. dollars per month. The rising prevalence of gold farming has led to the creation of gold farm brokerages.\nBecause of reports indicating many gold farmers are located in China they are sometimes referred to as \"Chinese farmers\" or \"China farmers\".\nThere are \"gold farmers\" (sometimes known as Tyrexs) or \"gold farms\" in other countries as well such as the Philippines, Indonesia and Mexico. However, they do not approach the scope and scale of the Chinese farm industry. China's abundant labor, availability of high-speed Internet connections and cheap computers have made it a powerhouse in collecting virtual assets for online games, fueling the market among the 30 million or so online gamers worldwide.\nEconomic effects.\nAn issue unrelated to the legal and social issues of the gold farmer is their effect on game economies. Blizzard Entertainment and some players suggest that by introducing new gold into the system, farmers are causing inflation. However, a WoW server is not a closed system, gold farming is not a monopoly industry and farmers make a good deal of their gold off the sale of items. As such, they are competing against players and each other within the economy of a given gameserver, driving prices down and thus inflation is actually staved off -- the Wal-Mart effect, if you will.\nEven non-gold buying players quickly come to rely on the prices set by the commoditization of items farming helps to create. And gold farmers themselves invest heavily in a game's economy -- buying gear that helps them farm better, such as bags and potions. Recent crackdowns on gold farming accounts have resulted in a 2 to 4x increase in the prices of enchanting materials, boosted the prevalence of premium-priced epics, and stalled the market for other high level trade goods and services, leaving the profitability of tried-and-true schemes in question. This leads some to the conclusion that while gold farming is indeed disreputable, it also has a positive effect -- a stable, competitive in-game market.\nAn alternative view.\nThe other view is that in fact, gold farming does cause inflation. It has been seen throughout history, that the decrease in value of a currency, naturally drives up the prices of the goods it is used to purchase. It can be said that gold farming is a self-sustaining industry that fuels its own corruption. By inflating the economy and driving up the prices of items, more in-game gold is required to purchase them. Rather than farm this gold for themselves, players are as such more likely to purchase it and simply save themselves the trouble. This is a circular problem and does nothing more than feed itself. The perceived 'lower price' of items can be viewed as nothing more than a myth, not backed up by any sound evidence, with basic economics stating that inflation is a real problem in any economy, including that of \"World of Warcraft\".\nGold farming can be viewed as particularly harmful to new players, who, unlike those who began to play on day one, have to deal with the fact that items are far more expensive, sometimes obscenely so, whereas the money received from quests and the vendoring of rewards is a lot lower. The sale of lower level items such as linen cloth and basic ore which are often the basis of a low-level character's economic growth, have bottomed out because most players are now Level 60 and have no use for these items, or are playing twink-alts with an artificially high sum of gold which new players do not possess.\nMerging both economic arguments.\nBoth of the arguments seen above can actually be merged together. Gold farming increases both the volume of gold in the game (which increases demand for higher items, and is inflationary) and the volume of items in the game (increases supply of higher items, is deflationary.) As such, the impact of gold farming could theoretically go one way or the other. One facet that has not been considered properly is that gold farmers make a significant amount (if not most) of the money to be sold by selling the items they find. This will result in increased supply for some items, and therefore the deflation that has been argued above. On the other hand, markets where there is no excess supply will result in inflation.\nThe key point that is being missed is that non-competitive deflation (which occurs due to market domination) is not necessarily a good thing. All sellers must devalue their items in order to sell them, placing sellers who are not gold-farmers at a disadvantage, decreasing their income/wealth. Economic theory also dictates that the total amount of money involved is lower than it should be, decreasing the efficacy of the auction house cut system that helps fight money supply inflation (that can potentially impact on other sections of the game).\nThis comes to the most significant economic problem with gold farming; non-gold purchasers are artificially poor not only because they do not buy gold, but because their sales are undervalued. The distribution of income between players is altered, such that theoretically there is a potential decrease in the wealth of the \"middle\" and \"upper-middle class\" players in the game. While it could be argued that because all of the major items are deflated the issue is trivial, people typically wish to buy items of higher value than what they are selling, and more items are therefore required for the same purchase. In other words, the sellers and buyers in the markets the gold-farmer are involved in are the most susceptible of losing financially.\nIn the end gold farming results in benefiting and disadvantaging different player groups. Players who do not play much (and are hardly involved the market discussed), or gold buyers, or those who are already very wealthy will suffer no negative impact from item deflation, and can only gain from gold-farming. Players who sell items directly competing with the gold farmers (which would also consist of a significant portion of the buyer market) are worse off. Note: These statements are true with the presumption that the market is not perfectly competitive; the gold sellers effectively control the price of the market because they dominate the number of sellers present.\nBut perhaps most importantly for most players, the changed wealth distribution between players of similar caliber and similar game-time result in them having very different equipment, which many would consider an unfair advantage.\nBlizzard on RMT Microtransactions.\nSome gold farmers have feared that someday you could use real money to buy gold in-game with a method sanctioned by &lt;a href=\"Blizz\"&gt;Blizz&lt;/a&gt;ard, some times called \"micro-transactions.\" At a 2008, &lt;a href=\"Rob%20Pardo\"&gt;Rob Pardo&lt;/a&gt; gave a strong indication, &lt;a href=\"Blizz\"&gt;Blizz&lt;/a&gt;ard would not ever go this route with \"World of Warcraft\".\nResearch on gold farming.\nGe Jin.\nChina is in fact dominant in this industry and Jin Ge, a 30-year-old Shanghai native has done a documentary on \"gold farms\" in China as part of his doctoral research at the University of California, San Diego. \nHe is one of the many researchers who has invested his time in investigating how farm owners manage their production and distribution of virtual commodities across the border between the virtual and the real as well as the border between nations. His main aim in his research was also to delve into the background and lives of these workers \"I also tried to find out what this job, combining work and play, means to Chinese gold farmers and how it feels like to live at this peculiar intersection of the virtual and the real.\"\nGe Jin's research is also documented in his periodical online news articles which can be found at Consumer Studies Research Network.\nCory Doctorow.\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//craphound.com/bio.php\"&gt;Cory Doctorow&lt;/a&gt; has done research on gold farming in the process of writing a novel (&lt;a href=\"http%3A//craphound.com/ftw/\"&gt;For The Win&lt;/a&gt;). Discussion of his research appeared on WoW Insider\nControversies.\nForums, 2009.\nOn January 22nd, 2009, a gold seller banner-ad appeared on the official \"World of Warcraft\" forums, which offered gold \"As Low As $3/1000 WoW Gold &lt;5 Minutes Delivery US/EU On Sale\" [sic] . The advertisement was quickly removed, followed by the swift deletion of most forum threads discussing the subject. &lt;a href=\"Bornakk\"&gt;Bornakk&lt;/a&gt;, a community manager for World of Warcraft, made an official statement regarding the advertisement shortly after, and reinforced Blizzard's long-held stance against the practice of buying and selling gold.\nLaunch of Battle.net Security, 2010.\nOn January 2010, \"&lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard Entertainment&lt;/a&gt;\", publisher of the game, stepped up its offensive on account security scams with the launch of a new website. The new &lt;a href=\"http%3A//us.battle.net/security/\"&gt;Battle.net&lt;/a&gt; account security website expects to highlight the importance of vigilance and common sense when it comes to subscribers' accounts. \n \"These pages are part of a larger effort to provide you with the knowledge and tools necessary to identify and report threats to your account\u2019s safety, to spotlight ways in which we work to fulfill our security commitment, and to act as a helpful resource in case someone manages to steal account information from you.\n Gold sellers and leveling services are responsible for the vast majority of all account thefts, and they are the number-one source of World of Warcraft-related phishing attempts, spyware, and even credit card theft. Players who buy gold actively support spam, hacks, and keyloggers, and by doing so diminish the gameplay experience for everyone else.\""}

The entire city is built on bluffs several hundred feet above the surrounding landscape and is accessible by elevators on the southwestern and northeastern sides. Established by the wise chieftain &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; and his stalwart tribe, Thunder Bluff overlooks the verdant land of &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt; from atop a series of windswept mesas. Prior to the construction of the capital, the tauren had lived as nomads for countless generations, often under attack by marauding bands of &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt;. With Thunder Bluff\u2019s founding, however, the proud and good-spirited race was finally granted a permanent home.\nThe city of many tribes is a hub for tauren, welcoming tradesfolk and artisans of every kind.\nHistory.\nThe Third War and after.\nWith the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s' help, &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Bloodhoof%20tribe\"&gt;Bloodhoof tribe&lt;/a&gt; were able to drive back the &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt; and claim the grasslands of &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt; for their own. For the first time in hundreds of years, the tauren had a land to call their own. Upon the windswept mesa of Thunder Bluff, Cairne built a refuge for his people, where tauren of every tribe is welcome. Over time, the scattered tauren tribes united under Cairne's rule. There are a few tribes who disagree about the direction their new nation should take, but all agree that Cairne is the wisest and best suited to lead them towards the future.\n&lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt; and his companions were tasked by &lt;a href=\"Tagar%20%28tauren%29\"&gt;Tagar&lt;/a&gt; with driving the &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Harpy\"&gt;harpies&lt;/a&gt; away from the tauren's &lt;a href=\"kodo\"&gt;kodo&lt;/a&gt; herds, for the foul creatures were slaughtering them and leaving their bodies to rot. Mulgore was also home to a large group of &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt;, who had captured Baine and thrown Cairne into despair. With the help of &lt;a href=\"Bovan%20Windtotem\"&gt;Bovan Windtotem&lt;/a&gt;, Rexxar rescued Baine and brought the tauren back into the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nThe city of Thunder Bluff lies atop a series of mesas that overlook the verdant grasslands of Mulgore. Once a nomadic people, the tauren recently established the city as a center for trade caravans, traveling artisans, and inventors of every kind. The proud city also stands as a refuge for the many hunters who stalk their dangerous prey through the Barrens and its surrounding areas. Long bridges of wood and rope span the chasms between the mesas, and each mesa is topped with tents, longhouses, colorfully painted totems, and spirit lodges. The mighty chief, Cairne Bloodhoof, presides over the bustling city, ensuring that the united tauren tribes live in peace and security.\nThunder Bluff is the first city of its kind; for centuries, the tauren wandered the plains as nomads, unable to claim a permanent home. All &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; visitors are welcome here, and the expertise of the tauren in professions ranging from &lt;a href=\"leatherworking\"&gt;leatherworking&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"shamanism\"&gt;shamanism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"druidism\"&gt;druidism&lt;/a&gt; to hunting are all practiced and taught here. Unfortunately, the central location of the Thunder Bluff also makes it easily accessible to members of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. Thus, it is often one of the easier Horde capitals for Alliance players to &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt;, with Baine being killed long before Horde reinforcements even become an issue.\nIn order to gain access to Thunder Bluff, visitors must either ride &lt;a href=\"wyvern\"&gt;wyvern&lt;/a&gt;s to the top one of the four towering mesas, use the zeppelin from &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; or be lifted via rope and wood elevators from the foot of the bluffs, an invention unique to the tauren.\nWorld of Warcraft: The Comic.\nSome time prior to the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;'s awakening, Thunder Bluff's &lt;a href=\"Pools%20of%20Vision\"&gt;Pools of Vision&lt;/a&gt; became haunted by an element rumored to be summoned by Magatha. The city was visited by &lt;a href=\"Rehgar%20Earthfury\"&gt;Rehgar Earthfury&lt;/a&gt; and his two gladiators - &lt;a href=\"Broll\"&gt;Broll&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lo%27Gosh\"&gt;Lo'Gosh&lt;/a&gt; who destroyed the element and eventually escaped from slavery. A human assassin from the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Assassin%27s%20Guild\"&gt;Stormwind Assassin's Guild&lt;/a&gt; also visited Magatha in order to learn the location of Lo'Gosh.\nStormrage.\nThunder Bluff was enveloped by the mists of the Nightmare, but &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; was able to find Baine in the city, and recruit him into the &lt;a href=\"dreamform%20army\"&gt;dreamform army&lt;/a&gt;.\nElemental Unrest.\nThe city was attacked by furious elements but the attack was repelled.\nThe Shattering: Prelude to Cataclysm.\nFollowing Cairne\u2019s death in a duel with Warchief &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, Thunder Bluff was briefly seized in a coup by &lt;a href=\"Magatha%20Grimtotem\"&gt;Magatha Grimtotem&lt;/a&gt; and elements of her tribe. Thunder Bluff became sabotaged by the Grimtotem Clan assassins. Their targets were experts in weapons, powerful druids, or shamans. They headed to the Spirit Rise, where The Skychaser clan's members were all murdered. The Forsaken below were supporting the Grimtotem, thus they needn't be worried. The hunters of the Hunter Rise were also killed and some others who could lift a weapon were also killed to strike fear to remaining tauren. The reign of Grimtotems was short-lived, however. Thanks to the effort of &lt;a href=\"Jevan%20Grimtotem\"&gt;Jevan Grimtotem&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, Baine was able to rally an army and buy weapons needed to defeat the Grimtotem in Thunder Bluff. In retaliation, Cairne's son, Baine, launched a brilliant counterattack using a fleet of zeppelins. After he strategically divided Magatha's forces, Baine recaptured Thunder Bluff and assumed his role as the high chieftain of the tauren. Having recovered from the recent unrest, the capital is once again a bastion of peace and security for Kalimdor's tauren. Magatha and her loyalists were sent to exile. Jevan became the leader of the Grimtotem who remained with the Horde and he remained in Thunder Bluff.\nCataclysm.\nBaine now rules the tauren from the High Rise. New shamanistic tribe, the Cloudsong replaced the murdered Skychaser tribe.\nLegion.\nThunder Bluff was under attack by &lt;a href=\"infernal\"&gt;infernal&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThunder Bluff appears in the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; with the rises being shattered and the city floating on its side.\nBefore the Storm.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20Campaign\"&gt;Argus Campaign&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; parade, Thunder Bluff hosted the Warchief &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; and several representatives of other Horde races to speak about the tragedy in &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt; on the behest of &lt;a href=\"Archdruid%20Hamuul%20Runetotem\"&gt;Archdruid Hamuul Runetotem&lt;/a&gt;. Soon after, they were joined by &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; who warned the Horde about the injuries of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28titan%29\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nHighmountain tauren.\nThunder Bluff held a feast for the &lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20tauren\"&gt;Highmountain tauren&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Highmountain\"&gt;Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;. The whole city was celebrating with fireworks until it was attacked by the minions of the Old Gods who sensed &lt;a href=\"Spiritwalker%20Ebonhorn\"&gt;Spiritwalker Ebonhorn&lt;/a&gt;. They trapped the city civilians with the void power turning them unresponsive. The city was defended by Horde adventurers, Baine Bloodhoof, his personal guards, as well as the city guards who killed the void minions and their leader, &lt;a href=\"Qy%27telek\"&gt;Qy'telek&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nTauren &lt;a href=\"warbrave\"&gt;warbrave&lt;/a&gt;s were sent from the city into the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter Baine was rescued from the &lt;a href=\"Underhold\"&gt;Underhold&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, they feared &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; would burn Thunder Bluff like she did &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;. It was also attacked by malevolent spirits from the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt; but successfully defended by Baine and the tauren hero.\nThe citizens of Thunder Bluff would support &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; in his revolution against Sylvanas, though Baine's wounds would force him to remain within the city rather than march to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; by Saurfang's side. &lt;a href=\"Ji%20Firepaw\"&gt;Ji Firepaw&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Aysa%20Cloudsinger\"&gt;Aysa Cloudsinger&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mayla%20Highmountain\"&gt;Mayla Highmountain&lt;/a&gt;, and their forces would reinforce the city's defenses in case Sylvanas launched a counterattack. During the conflict, Saurfang challenged Sylvanas to a &lt;a href=\"Mak%27gora\"&gt;Mak'gora&lt;/a&gt;, which ended in his death and Sylvanas's abandonment of the Horde. A stunned &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar&lt;/a&gt; ordered for &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt; to report what had transpired to Baine. With Thunder Bluff no longer under the threat of an attack by Sylvanas, the reinforcements left the city as Baine, Ji, and Mayla traveled to Orgrimmar to attend the funeral of Varok Saurfang.\nDeath Rising.\nBaine Bloodhoof and Mayla Highmountain were in the city when the &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt; attacked and captured Baine.\nGeography.\nThunder Bluff is located in the far north of Mulgore, among the sprawling flatlands of the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Plains\"&gt;Golden Plains&lt;/a&gt;. The city is composed of four towering mesas or rises. The only entrances from the plains below are elevators leading to the central platform. The central rise is connected to the others through large wooden bridges.\nRises.\nThe various rises in Thunder Bluff act a bit like neighborhoods or quarters in a human city, or the valleys and keeps of the orcish city &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;.\nThunder Bluff has a central mesa divided into three rises, surrounded by three additional mesas with distinct names:\nNotable characters.\nThe new Chief of the Bloodhoof clan, &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; has become the High Chieftain of the tauren race in wake of his father's death. He watches over Thunder Bluff, and over his people in an ever-darkening world. Baine can be found in the chieftain's tent in the eastern main city and is accompanied by his Honor Guards. \n&lt;a href=\"Hamuul%20Runetotem\"&gt;Hamuul Runetotem&lt;/a&gt; is the elder druid of Thunder Bluff, and a childhood friend of Cairne. Although he at one point left to fight on &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, he can always be found on &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Rise\"&gt;Elder Rise&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nHistory.\nThe &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt; were driving the tauren out of their homeland around the time of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;. When &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and his Horde arrived on the &lt;a href=\"continent\"&gt;continent&lt;/a&gt;, an alliance was forged between the Horde and the tauren. Following the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; and the end of the war, Thrall helped the tauren rout the centaur and reclaim their land. Shortly thereafter the tauren founded the city of Thunder Bluff and began the process of settling into their old surroundings and repairing the ecological damage the centaur had wrought. Thunder Bluff grows and expands at a tremendous rate.\nThe city was described as being built atop a near-impenetrable mesa deep in the south of Mulgore. The weather is almost always warm and sunny, with intermittent breezes carried in from The Barrens.\nPeople and culture.\nAlthough some of the historically nomadic tauren probably miss their itinerant lifestyle, they are intensely proud of their permanent home and spend much of their time trying to make it better. They gladly accept the help of the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s that help them, but are somewhat less enthusiastic at the presence of the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;, whom they only grudgingly tolerate because of their membership in the Horde. Tauren place a strong emphasis on the value of life, and the unlife of the Forsaken stands as an affront to their beliefs, not to mention the less than honorable activities the Forsaken carry out."}

By combining each hierarchical layer of gifts and pledges near its expiration, it should be possible to extend the overall duration to around 21 days for the city gift collections; so anywhere within that timeframe, a city gift could be created. It is unknown whether or not the buff will proc based on the item creation or if a separate check requires the event to be in progress, but the response time for the buff to proc during the event suggests that no separate check is used. \nSee also.\nThere is a plethora of individual items that are combined in this seasonal event to form successively larger collections. For details, see the main &lt;a href=\"Love%20is%20in%20the%20Air\"&gt;Love is in the Air&lt;/a&gt; article. "}

{"id": "22998", "revid": "3154973", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=22998", "title": "Thunder Ridge", "text": "Thunder Ridge is a flooded gorge in northwestern &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;, just southwest of &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;. Previously an ancient forest home to many herds of &lt;a href=\"thunder%20lizard\"&gt;thunder lizard&lt;/a&gt;s, the ridge was deforested by the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; and the machinations of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Blade%20clan\"&gt;Burning Blade&lt;/a&gt;, before being flooded by the &lt;a href=\"Southfury%20River\"&gt;Southfury River&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nAfter the Third War.\nWatched over by the spirit &lt;a href=\"Owa%27nohe\"&gt;Owa'nohe&lt;/a&gt;, Thunder Ridge was once home to a forest of ancient trees that grew in harmony with the &lt;a href=\"thunder%20lizard\"&gt;thunder lizard&lt;/a&gt;s.\nShortly after the &lt;a href=\"founding%20of%20Durotar\"&gt;founding of Durotar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt; and his companions journeyed to Thunder Ridge to obtain &lt;a href=\"%3Ashimmerweed\"&gt;:shimmerweed&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Drek%27Thar\"&gt;Drek'Thar&lt;/a&gt;, Thrall's &lt;a href=\"farseer\"&gt;farseer&lt;/a&gt;. Rexxar noticed a change in the lizards' behavior and informed Drek'Thar upon his return to Orgrimmar. Drek'Thar and Rexxar later discovered a human lumber operation that was deforesting the ridge and driving the lizards mad. They were forced to put down the lizards to prevent disaster. Their eggs were collected by Rexxar for Drek'Thar to study.\nCycle of Hatred.\nAfter already being damaged years prior, Thunder Ridge's dense forest was razed down, leaving the way open for its hundreds of thunder lizards to roam to &lt;a href=\"Drygulch%20Ravine\"&gt;Drygulch Ravine&lt;/a&gt; and beyond. &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, told by &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, went to investigate and discovered that the trees had been cut by &lt;a href=\"Warlock\"&gt;demonic magic&lt;/a&gt; as a result of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Blade%20clan\"&gt;Burning Blade&lt;/a&gt;'s efforts to destabilize the region.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nA small group of Burning Blade cultists led by &lt;a href=\"Fizzle%20Darkclaw\"&gt;Fizzle Darkclaw&lt;/a&gt; set up camp in Thunder Ridge to spread chaos. &lt;a href=\"Orgnil%20Soulscar\"&gt;Orgnil Soulscar&lt;/a&gt; ordered Horde agents to kill Fizzle and claim his claw as proof. Meanwhile, &lt;a href=\"Uzzek\"&gt;Uzzek&lt;/a&gt; instructed Horde warriors to thin the local &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Lizard%20%28mob%29\"&gt;thunder lizard&lt;/a&gt; population in order to prove their strength.\nCataclysm.\nIn the wake of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, Thunder Ridge was flooded by the &lt;a href=\"Southfury%20River\"&gt;Southfury River&lt;/a&gt;, drowning both the &lt;a href=\"Drowned%20Thunder%20Lizard\"&gt;thunder lizards&lt;/a&gt; and the Burning Blade within the valley. Horde agents were sent into the ridge in order to obtain &lt;a href=\"Fizzle%27s%20Orb\"&gt;Fizzle's Orb&lt;/a&gt; from his corpse and remove the corpses of the thunder lizards in order to make the new water source drinkable.\nWithin the flooded ridge are &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Stonefish%20%28mob%29\"&gt;golden stonefish&lt;/a&gt;. This fish can't be caught by normal means due to its jaws that snap through any lures and hooks. Besides, their scale prevents them from any damage but massive electrical discharge nearby that can be caused by &lt;a href=\"Drowned%20Thunder%20Lizard%20Tail\"&gt;Drowned Thunder Lizard Tail&lt;/a&gt;. Thus &lt;a href=\"Razgar\"&gt;Razgar&lt;/a&gt; sent Horde &lt;a href=\"fishing\"&gt;fishermen&lt;/a&gt; to acquire the tails and bring him three of the golden stonefish.\nDragonflight.\nTo earn the Blessing of the Land for their &lt;a href=\"om%27gora\"&gt;om'gora&lt;/a&gt;, orc adventurers sought out &lt;a href=\"Owa%27nohe\"&gt;Owa'nohe&lt;/a&gt;, the Spirit of Thunder Ridge. She agreed to give them her blessing if they helped her heal the area. The adventurers braved restless elementals to collect ancient seeds from the flooded valley and then planted them in &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Skeleton\"&gt;Owa'nohe's skeleton&lt;/a&gt;, allowing her to create new trees as a first step toward restoring the area's former verdancy. In time, Thunder Ridge will flourish into a new oasis, benefiting the orcs and the thunder lizards alike.\nIn the RPG.\nThunder Ridge is a breathtaking gorge which until recently was untamed by any civilization. &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20lizard\"&gt;Thunder lizard&lt;/a&gt;s give this place its name, and it dominates the landscape for some distance. &lt;a href=\"Tallstrider\"&gt;Tallstrider&lt;/a&gt;s also hang out on the fringes with an eye out for an easy lunch. Being the home to behemoth lightning lizards, it helps obscure the presence of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Blade\"&gt;Burning Blade&lt;/a&gt; there, led by the &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Fizzle%20Darkstorm\"&gt;Fizzle Darkstorm&lt;/a&gt;."}
