It clears negative &lt;a href=\"debuff\"&gt;debuff&lt;/a&gt;s upon use. It does not weaken or prevent any combat actions such as spellcasting or damage dealing. However, certain environment mechanics such as flag-carrying or chest-looting may be restricted to prevent exploitation, as they are with other immunity effects.\nThe item is consumed when used.\nLegacy.\nLight of Elune is infamous as one of the rewards in the &lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;classic game&lt;/a&gt; that is potentially exploitable by players, but was included early in the development process before designers were as experienced in foreseeing consequences of new abilities and effects. While the effect lasts only briefly, the potion's ability to provide total immunity with almost no restrictions on actions makes it an incredible asset if used at a key moment. A raid of players equipped with Lights of Elune, for instance, could bypass a critical survival moment in a fight and dramatically increase their chances of success beyond what was intended. It could easily tip the scales in a Player vs. Player fight.\nThe potion as originally implemented did not become &lt;a href=\"soulbound\"&gt;soulbound&lt;/a&gt; upon receiving it, allowing it to be bought and sold. Some players would even create &lt;a href=\"alt\"&gt;alt&lt;/a&gt;s specifically to level them up to 25, obtain the Light of Elune, and send the potion to a &lt;a href=\"main\"&gt;main&lt;/a&gt; character. The potions commanded great value on the &lt;a href=\"auction%20house\"&gt;auction house&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, the potion was changed to &lt;a href=\"bind%20on%20pickup\"&gt;bind on pickup&lt;/a&gt;, limiting its impact to one use in the entire lifespan of a character. As of \"\", neither it or any similar item can be obtained anymore.\nGiven the low level of the quest granting it, the developers likely imagined the Light of Elune would be used in a more casual way during the leveling experience. Other items with seemingly small but surprisingly desirable effects even at higher levels include the &lt;a href=\"Bag%20of%20Marbles\"&gt;Bag of Marbles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Glowing%20Wax%20Stick\"&gt;Glowing Wax Stick&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Slumber%20Sand\"&gt;Slumber Sand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Really%20Sticky%20Glue\"&gt;Really Sticky Glue&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Large%20Rope%20Net\"&gt;Large Rope Net&lt;/a&gt;. All were eventually changed to bind on pickup, and most were ultimately removed.\nIn addition to its place in development history, the Light of Elune is regarded by many as being emblematic of different players' styles. As the ultimate high-impact, single-use item, its use is representative of any item or event with a unique effect but a limited supply. Some players use the potion almost immediately, possibly wasting its potential. Others may save it for a more well-considered moment, and hopefully get a nice small victory from it, as Blizzard likely intended. Others may put a great deal of thought into how best to exploit it in unexpected ways, although with the one-time-only limitation the payoff for this is unlikely to be too great. Finally, a certain type of player will try to save it for \"the perfect moment\". For many of these, that moment will never come and it will remain in their bags (or bank) forever. The pressure of accidentally wasting it after so much time may simply be too much. But a few have reported using the Light of Elune, years and years later, in a key fight when their group and the enemy are both a breath away from defeat, for one last push for victory, finally rewarding them for all their patience with the accolades of friends and teammates at how well the potion was ultimately used.\nTrivia.\nThe Light of Elune has been compared to Pokemon's Master Ball."}

The two peoples then lived in peace alongside each other for years. During this time, more &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; arrived on Draenor and, without &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s to fight, the draenei became fixated upon the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;. At some point, Draenor began to deteriorate for unknown reasons. The Lightbound believed that the orcs were choking the life from Draenor and dooming the land to desiccation, and blamed the Mag'har for the once-fertile land becoming lifeless dust, while believed that it was the Light that had doomed the planet. Having received visions from the Light Mother, the High Exarch knew that the Army of the Light would bring order to countless worlds in the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;Great Dark Beyond&lt;/a&gt;. But first, the Mag'har needed to be taught to trust the naaru as well, for they brought peace and order. The naaru compelled the draenei to spread their influence among the orcs.\nThe Lightbound sent sermons, explaining they wished for all the people of Draenor to be unified in purpose. Those resisting the Light were seen as an infection that prevented \"Draenor's heart from being whole\". Many orcs converted to the Light willingly, but others had the Light forced upon them. Some orcs even sided with the draenei against their own kin, including Grommash's &lt;a href=\"Exarch%20Hellscream\"&gt;own son&lt;/a&gt;. War followed, until the two sides found themselves in a stalemate in &lt;a href=\"Gorgrond\"&gt;Gorgrond&lt;/a&gt;, where the Lightbound refused to attack &lt;a href=\"Hellsreach%20Citadel\"&gt;Hellsreach Citadel&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nConvinced that the Mag'har had no hope of winning against the Lightbound, &lt;a href=\"Kor%27gall%2C%20Greatson%20of%20Kor%27gall\"&gt;Kor'gall, Greatson of Kor'gall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kor%27gall%20clan\"&gt;his followers&lt;/a&gt; secretly joined them. While the Mag'har were dealing with the ogres, Lightbound forces led by captured &lt;a href=\"Evermorn%20Hold\"&gt;Evermorn Hold&lt;/a&gt; and used it as a staging ground for an attack against &lt;a href=\"Beastwatch\"&gt;Beastwatch&lt;/a&gt;. However, the Mag'har repelled the assault and retaliated. In their assault on Evermorn, Overlord Geya'rah, &lt;a href=\"Eitrigg\"&gt;Eitrigg&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champion&lt;/a&gt; killed Orelis. As the Mag'har celebrated their victory, High Exarch Yrel and her entire army arrived on the field. With her vastly superior numbers, the High Exarch offered Hellscream and the Mag'har one last chance to embrace the Light by joining the Lightbound. However, Grommash refused her offer, and stayed behind with to push back the Lightbound while the Mag'har led by Geya'rah fled to Azeroth with Eitrigg and the champion."}

Always aggressive, he once led a raiding party to investigate a cave filled with dark magic, and discovered a pack of creatures that had been corrupted by the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"C%27Thun\"&gt;C'Thun&lt;/a&gt;. The vrykul were greatly outnumbered, but stayed and fought instead of running. Most of them fell in minutes, but Ingvar remained standing. Though badly wounded, he fought his way through the cave and destroyed every enemy inside. After he died, the &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Helya\"&gt;Helya&lt;/a&gt; sent Ingvar's spirit to the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Halls of Valor&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"Odyn\"&gt;Keeper Odyn&lt;/a&gt; welcomed him with open arms. Odyn declared Ingvar a paragon among the &lt;a href=\"Valarjar\"&gt;Valarjar&lt;/a&gt; for his noble sacrifice and granted him the &lt;a href=\"Warswords%20of%20the%20Valarjar\"&gt;Warswords of the Valarjar&lt;/a&gt;, weapons which Odyn had previously declared would be granted only to the greatest among the order. In times of peril, Ingvar was always the first to lead the Valarjar into battle.\nHowever, not long thereafter, Helya rebelled against Odyn and magically trapped him and nearly all of the Valarjar inside the Halls of Valor. Ingvar was one of the few Valarjar who happened to be outside the Halls at the time. He took his warswords and immediately retaliated in the hopes of defeating Helya and freeing Odyn. He realized that he was unlikely to win against the powerful Val'kyr, but there was no one else to make the attempt. He found his adversary and almost managed to kill her with the warswords, but in the end she overpowered and destroyed him. His swords fell to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, among the few Valarjar artifacts to not be trapped in the Halls. Helya kept the blades as a memento of her victory over Odyn and later granted them to her own champion, the &lt;a href=\"Kvaldir\"&gt;Kvaldir&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Vigfus%20Bladewind\"&gt;Vigfus Bladewind&lt;/a&gt;."}

Back on the ranch, the &lt;a href=\"Work%20Orders\"&gt;Work Orders&lt;/a&gt; board has popped up at Yoon's old spot.

Many players that have already completed many of the other rep gains of the other factions will not gain much from completing work orders. Other players have stated that planting eight plots as opposed to just one plot for Yoon's regular quest is not as economical a trade off to be worth doing."}

{"id": "153745", "revid": "39299307", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=153745", "title": "Inigo Montoy", "text": "Father Inigo Montoy was a &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt; previously located at &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Eastern Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;. He was affiliated with the &lt;a href=\"Brotherhood%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Brotherhood of the Light&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt;, though secretly was an agent of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nInigo Montoy was once a revered cleric of the Argent Dawn. Having seen what the Scourge had done to Lordaeron, the Lich King having taken everything from him, he dedicated his whole life to fighting the undead. A bastion of virtue for the Argent Dawn, he was a member of the &lt;a href=\"Brotherhood%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Brotherhood of the Light&lt;/a&gt; and was present at &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt; during the first Scourge invasion and the assault on the Dread Citadel &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt;, during which he provided &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s with the &lt;a href=\"Vestments%20of%20Faith\"&gt;Vestments of Faith&lt;/a&gt;, restored from the desecrated vestments of the fallen heroes in Naxxramas.\nUpon the fall of &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;, Father Montoy was delivered &lt;a href=\"%3Athe%20Phylactery%20of%20Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;:the Phylactery of Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; for payment.\nHowever, the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt; reported later that they never received the phylactery. As it turned out, Montoy's true master was not the Brotherhood of the Light or the Argent Dawn at all. The Lich King himself had corrupted the virtuous priest, promising to rend the weakness from his soul.\nInigo returned the phylactery to Arthas, and was transformed into a lich, now known as &lt;a href=\"Thel%27zan%20the%20Duskbringer\"&gt;Thel'zan the Duskbringer&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks to his treachery, &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; was restored and &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt; returned to Northrend. Being referred to by the name he held in life, an existence he despised, particularly enrages Thel'zan \u2014 when &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; does so, Thel'zan promises to kill him on the spot.\nQuotes.\nThe Lich King is attempting to make his presence known in our world. This must not be allowed to occur.\nInspiration.\nHis name is very likely a tribute to the character Inigo Montoya from the book \" by William Goldman, and . He was a master swordsman who spoke those famous words, \"Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die,\"\" which is now one of the most memorable quotes in fantasy. \nFurthermore the inspiration for the name of Inigo Montoya might have been , the founder and the first General of . This supposed origin of the name might fit the WoW character, as Jesuits are often a part of various conspiracy theories (and the in-game Inigo seems to be a malevolent, plotting figure). \nInterestingly, according to , Loyola's Jesuit Constitutions stressed absolute self-abnegation and obedience to Pope and superiors, as he put it: \"perinde ac cadaver\"; \"well-disciplined like a corpse\", which could be a very becoming motto for a servant of the Lich King and a member of the Scourge Inigo Montoy has become.\nSome speculate that the name is more than just a tribute, and that it might have a deeper meaning. The fact that he obviously takes the phylactery of Kel'Thuzad for himself (or unknown masters) may be a hint to show that Kel'Thuzad might be Montoy's father (as the quote mentioned above would suggest), or some other close relative. Alternatively, Montoy's father could have been killed by Kel'Thuzad.\n&lt;a href=\"Inigo%27s%20Copper%20Coin\"&gt;Inigo's Copper Coin&lt;/a&gt;, fished from the fountain in the &lt;a href=\"Eventide\"&gt;Eventide&lt;/a&gt;, at least states that Inigo wishes he had his father back in some context... or could just be a reference to Inigo Montoya's famous line.\nRelatives.\nJudging by the surname, he could be related to &lt;a href=\"Daniel%20Montoy\"&gt;Daniel Montoy&lt;/a&gt;."}

His mentor &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Yuvari\"&gt;Elder Yuvari&lt;/a&gt; sent him to investigate the &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Nokhud\"&gt;Nokhud&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Ukhel\"&gt;Ukhel&lt;/a&gt;'s efforts in the kurgans. Yuvari asks &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to go and help Zorig, stating that he is capable but lacking in confidence. Zorig sends the adventurers to investigate what the Ukhel are up to and discover that they are exhuming the ancestors' weapons and using them to enslave their spirits, including that of Zorig's mother &lt;a href=\"Cathan%20the%20Determined\"&gt;Cathan the Determined&lt;/a&gt;, who died after Zorig was unable to heal her from an illness.\nWith &lt;a href=\"Exhumed%20Hunter%27s%20Spear\"&gt;his mother's spear&lt;/a&gt; in hand, Zorig relocates to the western side of the Eternal Kurgans and asks the heroes to retrieve the ancestors' weapons and some ritual reagents, as well as kill the Nokhud's overseer &lt;a href=\"Overseer%20Zambul\"&gt;Zambul&lt;/a&gt;. He then accompanies the heroes in combat and helps them use a &lt;a href=\"%3ATotem%20of%20Respite\"&gt;:Totem of Respite&lt;/a&gt; he's crafted to release the spirits of Cathan, &lt;a href=\"Ganmat%20the%20Wise\"&gt;Ganmat the Wise&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zaphil%20the%20Defiant\"&gt;Zaphil the Defiant&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Dihar%20the%20Unyielding\"&gt;Dihar the Unyielding&lt;/a&gt;. After Cathan's spirit is released, she briefly reappears to tell Zorig that she is proud of him. Zorig and the heroes then defeat &lt;a href=\"Tombcaller%20Arban\"&gt;Tombcaller Arban&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Teera\"&gt;Teera&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Maruuk\"&gt;Maruuk&lt;/a&gt;'s kurgan, only to discover that Arban has already removed the ancestors' weapons.\nZorig asks the heroes to defeat Teera and Maruuk in the &lt;a href=\"Nokhud%20Offensive\"&gt;Nokhud Offensive&lt;/a&gt; and lay their weapons to rest in the &lt;a href=\"Teerakai\"&gt;Teerakai&lt;/a&gt; kurgan. Meanwhile, he returns to Teerakai with his mother's spear to stand next to Elder Yuvari. After the adventurers complete their task, Yuvari states that Zorig is ready to undergo the trials to become a windsage. Zorig then asks the adventurers to accompany him as he places Cathan's spear in the kurgan to lay her to rest as well, in a place close to home where he can watch over her. When he places the spear, Cathan reappears again and he begins to apologize for being unable to save her in life and for never telling her what a good mother she was. Cathan replies that he has nothing to apologize for, expresses her pride in him again, and tells him that he'll do great things for Clan Ohn'ir. She then fades away again, and Zorig returns to his spot next to Yuvari."}

{"id": "15131", "revid": "25639871", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=15131", "title": "First War", "text": "The First War (also referred to as the First Great War) was a conflict fought between the orcish clans of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; and the humans of the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;.\nPrelude.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;kingdom of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; was a prosperous one. The humans who dwelled there turned the land into a paradise. The &lt;a href=\"Brotherhood%20of%20the%20Horse\"&gt;Knights of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Cleric\"&gt;Cleric&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Northshire%20Abbey\"&gt;Northshire Abbey&lt;/a&gt;, roamed far and wide, serving the king's people with honor and justice. The well-trained armies of the king were maintaining a lasting peace since the days of the &lt;a href=\"Gnoll%20War\"&gt;Gnoll War&lt;/a&gt;. The people of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28continent%29\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; were unaware that the powerful human &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; Medivh was seeking a way to destroy this kingdom and wreak havoc on the lands. With the help of an other-worldy being named Gul'dan, the two managed to open a portal between their two worlds, a portal which would later became known as the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;.\nThrough the portal came the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Orcish Horde&lt;/a&gt;. The humans did not know from whence these foul creatures came, and none were prepared for the terror that they spawned. When reports of mysterious creatures lurking around the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Morass\"&gt;Black Morass&lt;/a&gt; reached Stormwind, rumors spread through the streets that they were either vengeful spirits, &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s armed with some new breed of power, or a strange race from across the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt;. Their warriors wielded &lt;a href=\"Grunt\"&gt;axe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Spearman\"&gt;spear&lt;/a&gt; with deadly proficiency, while others &lt;a href=\"Raider\"&gt;rode&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Darkwolf\"&gt;dark wolves&lt;/a&gt; as black as the moonless night. Unimagined were the destructive powers of their &lt;a href=\"evil\"&gt;evil&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;, derived from the fires of the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;. Filled with the demonic blood of &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt;, these creatures lusted for war and would destroy anything that prevented them from reaching their goal; to conquer &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith an ingenious arsenal of weaponry and powerful magic, these two forces collided in a contest of cunning, intellect, and brute strength, with the victor claiming dominance over the whole of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28continent%29\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe First War.\nEarly stages.\n&lt;a href=\"Llane%20Wrynn%20I\"&gt;King Llane&lt;/a&gt; dispatched Sir &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt; to uncover what these new creatures were. Lothar led a small force of knights to scout the Black Morass, resulting in the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20Stormwind\"&gt;Knights of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; clashing with orcs for the first time in a series of bloody skirmishes. Lothar and his men scored a number of small victories, yet for every orcs killed two more seemed to take its place. The humans were more outnumbered in each subsequent battle, and Lothar was eventually forced to pull back without venturing deep enough into the heavily guarded Black Morass to find the Dark Portal. Lothar informed King Llane the invaders were bringing in reinforcements from somewhere, and the kingdom readied itself for a full-scale war. Elsewhere, the orcs reported to Warchief Blackhand that the region's humans were now aware of their presence. Preparations and scouting ceased, and the First War had began in earnest.\nLothar and his soldiers soon crossed paths with the &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt; and his apprentice &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; on a scouting mission to the Black Morass. He had encouraged his friend to rejoin Stormwind's defense, though understood that Medivh struggled with the power he unleashed on the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20tribe\"&gt;Gurubashi&lt;/a&gt; years ago. The Guardian played along and feigned a fear of tapping into unwieldy magical powers, though his true intention was to buy time for the Horde to gain power. Lothar also spoke with Khadgar, telling him about Medivh's troubled past and asking him to act as a caretaker in addition to an apprentice. Medivh became more erratic afterward, disappearing for days at a time and being exhausted when he finally returned.\nWarchief Blackhand ordered raiding parties to cut deep into Stormwind's lands to drive panic into the human populace. Entire villages in &lt;a href=\"Brightwood\"&gt;Brightwood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt;, and the southern &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt; fell, their inhabitants either killed or forced to flee. By the time Stormwind's patrols rode to defend the villages, the Horde was already gone. They were an enemy unlike any the humans had ever faced.\nKing Llane had named Lothar the \"King's Champion\", the highest military rank in the kingdom. Deciding to use the orcs' mobility against them, Lothar studied the pattern of targets the Horde would strike and set up ambushes along their paths of retreat. A loyal knight named &lt;a href=\"Gavinrad%20the%20Dire\"&gt;Gavinrad the Dire&lt;/a&gt; was given command of large numbers of troops by Lothar. In some cases, small units of human knights were able to bring down entire orc raiding parties without any casualties. The orcs soon realized the humans were unlike any enemy they had ever faced as well.\nMessengers were dispatched by King Llane to the other human kingdoms, warning of mysterious, fearsome green-skinned invaders. However, no help was received as the reports were not believed. Lordaeron was considered the most likely nation to help. However, &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; disguised as a visiting Stormwind noble openly mocked King Llane and claimed the threat was actually a rebellion of disgruntled citizens, causing Lordaeron to only politely wish Llane luck with his troubles. In the past, Stormwind had prided itself on standing alone and developed a policy of isolationism in recent decades, which many other nations saw as arrogant and likely influenced their passiveness.\nOther forces.\nWhile most of the Horde attacks were focused on Stormwind forces, Chieftain &lt;a href=\"Kilrogg%20Deadeye\"&gt;Kilrogg Deadeye&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Bleeding%20Hollow%20clan\"&gt;Bleeding Hollow clan&lt;/a&gt; led a few raiding parties into the western jungles of &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt;, as the region reminded them of their ancestral home and they had aims of claiming it for themselves. However, the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20tribe\"&gt;Gurubashi&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"jungle%20troll\"&gt;jungle troll&lt;/a&gt;s who dwelled in the jungles united to fight back against this new threat and began a guerrilla campaign against the orcs. The fighting between the two groups was unspeakably vicious. While the Bleeding Hollow seemed to outnumber the Gurubashi in every skirmish, they were still at a severe disadvantage against the trolls' knowledge of the region. The Gurubashi were willing to give up vast swathes of jungle to draw the orcs deeper into their territory, only to then launch bloody ambushes from all directions, resulting in horrific losses for the Bleeding Hollow. When Blackhand learned how many orcs were dying in Stranglethorn for no apparent gain, he ordered the Bleeding Hollow to retreat and join the fight against the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s. The Horde would deal with the trolls later.\nThe clerics from the &lt;a href=\"Brotherhood%20of%20Northshire\"&gt;Brotherhood of Northshire&lt;/a&gt; risked their lives to heal soldiers wounded in combat. In the past the clerics were known to heal &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt;s and trolls, which had granted them safety on the battlefield in some cases. This was not the case with the orcs, who ruthlessly targetted every cleric they found after learning of their abilities. Many clerics died without armor or weapons, but they never hesitated from joining battle, making their bravery legendary among Stormwind's forces.\nAs the war unfolded, the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; clan became a source of irritation for Warchief Blackhand. The clan's members were known to disobey orders, and too many wandered off never to be seen again. Blackhand considered destroying the clan to make an example of them, but the ogre mage &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt;, who had been acting as the Twilight's Hammer's \"de facto\" leader, offered to become the clan's official leader and keep it in line, which Blackhand allowed. The clan's disciplinary problems ended almost overnight and they became obedient and effective soldiers, to the pleasant surprise of Blackhand. Cho'gall had understood the clan and their beliefs. A clan attuned to the dark energies, they had been hearing the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt; whispers louder and clearer after arriving in Azeroth. Cho'gall told the clan the &lt;a href=\"Hour%20of%20Twilight\"&gt;Hour of Twilight&lt;/a&gt; was near and depended on the Horde's success. Until then, the clan had to keep up appearances with Warchief Blackhand while obeying their true masters in secret.\nThe first siege of Stormwind Keep.\nThree years after the Dark Portal had been opened, the orcish raids on the countryside had razed farms, towns, villages, forges, and trade houses, causing ruin to Stormwind's economy. Even more dire, many sources of food supply had been destroyed or fallen into the Horde's control, threatening &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; with running out of supplies in a few months. With this knowledge in mind, Warchief &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; decided to bring the Horde north to conquer &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt; and from there launch an attack on Stormwind City. The Horde marched on the foothills of Redridge with little resistance and believed the humans would not attack before they reached Stormwind City, which was exactly what Commander &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt; wanted them to think.\nAn orc raiding party led by Blackhand went into the mountains hoping to claim &lt;a href=\"Lakeshire\"&gt;Lakeshire&lt;/a&gt;. However, Lothar and his &lt;a href=\"knight\"&gt;knight&lt;/a&gt;s suddenly charged down the slopes without warning and surrounded the orcs in a spectacular ambush. The Horde &lt;a href=\"raider\"&gt;raider&lt;/a&gt;s fought hard but almost all of them were slain. Lothar himself had almost killed Blackhand, but the two &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s accompanying Blackhand had turned the tide of battle with their fel fire and forced Lothar to withdraw. Blackhand was humiliated by his brush with death and blamed the Shadow Council for not sensing the ambush. He personally executed the two warlocks that saved his life for incompetence, which angered &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; as they were his subordinates and limited in number. Weeks later, a larger force took Lakeshire and the surrounding land.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Brightwood\"&gt;Brightwood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt;, and the Redridge Mountains had fallen, the Horde marched onto Stormwind City, the capital of the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;. Thousands of Horde soldiers marched through &lt;a href=\"Elwynn%20Forest\"&gt;Elwynn Forest&lt;/a&gt; and encircled Stormwind, cutting off all access except for the sea. Blackhand had ordered &lt;a href=\"Kilrogg%20Deadeye\"&gt;Kilrogg Deadeye&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt; to lead their Bleeding Hollow and Twilight's Hammer clans in the assault on Stormwind. To weaken the city's defenses, siege engines bombarded the city walls through the night, and at dawn Kilrogg and Cho'gall launched their attack. While orcs charged the battlements, warlocks engulfed Stormwind's soldiers in fel fire, resulting in staggering losses. As it seemed Stormwind would fall that day, there were suddenly cries of an attack from the Horde's rear lines. Lothar and the majority of Stormwind's knights had moved around the Horde by sea. The King's Commander was now leading a charge through Elwynn Forest, catching the orcs in the rearguard completely by surprise as the knights cut through their lines. As the Bleeding Hollow and Twilight's Hammer tried to push back the knights, Stormwind's large gates opened and soldiers poured out of the city to flank the orcs in a counterattack. Outflanked on both sides and suffering many casualties, the orcs were left with no choice but to flee. This was the greatest disaster to ever happen to the Horde. Blackhand was infuriated and barely stopped himself from executing Kilrogg and Cho'gall because their clan members might revolt. The Horde withdrew to Redridge to devise a new plan. Lothar and &lt;a href=\"Llane%20Wrynn%20I\"&gt;King Llane&lt;/a&gt; had received information about the Horde's battle plans from &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;, who had learned them from &lt;a href=\"Garona\"&gt;Garona&lt;/a&gt;, which helped prepare for the attack on Stormwind.\nThe Orcish Horde marches north.\nAfter their initial assault on &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt;, the Orcish Horde now knew what to expect from the human troops. &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; assigned &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; to oversee the construction of an outpost in the &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20of%20Sorrows\"&gt;Swamp of Sorrows&lt;/a&gt;. The task was simple enough, the orcs had to build at least six &lt;a href=\"Farm\"&gt;farms&lt;/a&gt;, so that they could keep their troops well fed and ready to do battle, and a &lt;a href=\"barracks\"&gt;barracks&lt;/a&gt;; to protect the farms and to create a strategic outpost, &lt;a href=\"Kyross\"&gt;Kyross&lt;/a&gt;. From the Swamp of Sorrows, Orgrim led his troops onward, while crushing any opposition that they encountered. His troops' first real opposition was &lt;a href=\"Darkshire\"&gt;Grand Hamlet&lt;/a&gt;. With orders from Blackhand, Orgrim built a simple outpost nearby and prepared his troops for battle. Orgrim's troops razed Grand Hamlet to the ground and left no survivors standing.\nOne night a runner sent by Warchief Blackhand reported that &lt;a href=\"Griselda%20Blackhand\"&gt;Griselda&lt;/a&gt;, the Warchief's own daughter, had run off with the outlaw &lt;a href=\"Turok\"&gt;Turok&lt;/a&gt; and his band of ogres. Wolfriders were assigned to track them down; they were discovered to be hiding out in the dungeons below the &lt;a href=\"Deadmines\"&gt;Deadmines&lt;/a&gt;. By order of his Warchief, Orgrim led a small group of warriors into the dungeons and eliminated Turok, his forces and even Griselda. On their return from the dungeon, Orgrim received word from advanced scouts that the recently established outpost near the &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt; was under siege. A group of raiders were dispatched to assist Orgrim's troops in taking back the outpost and crushing the human opposition. After saving the outpost from destruction, Orgrim's troops were ordered to search the area and seek out from whence the human troops came from. Once the location was found Orgrim ordered the remainder of his troops to dispose of it. The encampment was completely destroyed and the threat was put to an end for good.\nWanting for his troops to learn how the humans' magic was created, Blackhand ordered Orgrim to lead an army into the town known as &lt;a href=\"Sunnyglade\"&gt;Sunnyglade&lt;/a&gt; and ravage it, leaving intact the &lt;a href=\"mage%20tower\"&gt;mage tower&lt;/a&gt; to study its knowledge. The humans of the town were fat and lazy with their prosperity and their weak human armies were easily smashed into pieces.\nThe Kingdom retaliates.\nThe kingdom of Stormwind sent emissaries to the orcs hoping to negotiate with them but if any returned, they did so in pieces. The mages of Stormwind also asked &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; for help but they thought the orcs little more than a local nuisance.\nAs a test for his abilities, &lt;a href=\"Llane%20Wrynn%20I\"&gt;King Llane&lt;/a&gt; appointed the &lt;a href=\"Defender%20of%20the%20Crown\"&gt;Defender of the Crown&lt;/a&gt; as Regent over a small parcel of land; the Defender of the Crown changed the town into a farming center with six farms in order to feed Stormwind's troops. A barracks was also constructed in the farming center, as spies reported that there were orc patrols in the area. The few orc patrols in the vicinity were wiped out. Some time later, spies reported that the orcs around &lt;a href=\"Darkshire\"&gt;Grand Hamlet&lt;/a&gt; were amassing a large army to march against the town. The King sent the Defender of the Crown along with a small detachment of troops to rally the townspeople of &lt;a href=\"Darkshire\"&gt;Grand Hamlet&lt;/a&gt; and defend the town from any attack. The Defender of the Crown was successful in rallying the townspeople and managed to save Grand Hamlet from being overrun.\nWith Grand Hamlet saved and Blackhand's raiding parties routed, the time to secure a lasting peace in the area around Grand Hamlet arose. The Defender of the Crown sought out the outpost known as &lt;a href=\"Kyross\"&gt;Kyross&lt;/a&gt;, from whence the army against Grand Hamlet amassed. After building a small encampment in the vicinity of the outpost to gather his troops, the Defender of the Crown led them into battle against the outpost, managing to destroy it.\nBy that time it had been some twenty months since &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Sir Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt; had led an expedition into the &lt;a href=\"Deadmines\"&gt;Deadmines&lt;/a&gt; to search for the lost &lt;a href=\"%3ATome%20of%20Divinity\"&gt;:Tome of Divinity&lt;/a&gt;. They were never heard from again. However, the King's Champion had recently appeared to the &lt;a href=\"Abbot%20of%20Northshire%20Abbey\"&gt;Abbot of Northshire Abbey&lt;/a&gt; in a vision - battered and pleading for assistance. The King, having heard of the news, sent the Defender of the Crown along with a detachment of warriors and healers into the mines in an attempt to find Sir Lothar and his expedition crew, heal them and bring them back alive. Even though the mines were littered with ogres, the Defender of the Crown along with his soldiers still managed to cut through the ogre's ranks and finally managed to find the gravely wounded Sir Anduin Lothar along with some other injured members of his expedition. The healers at the scene immediately healed Sir Lothar and soon after he resumed his job as the King's Champion.\nAfter a period of time, the King assigned some of his knights to aid the Defender of the Crown so that the latter's task of ridding &lt;a href=\"Elwynn%20Forest\"&gt;Elwynn Forest&lt;/a&gt; from Blackhand's dark minions could be more readily completed. They set up in an outpost near the south-east edge of the forest. It wasn't long before an orc encampment filled with orc warriors was found and destroyed, thus earning the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; a strategic key to securing the &lt;a href=\"Borderlands\"&gt;Borderlands&lt;/a&gt;. Later on, the King ordered the Defender of the Crown to go defend &lt;a href=\"Northshire%20Abbey\"&gt;Northshire Abbey&lt;/a&gt;; the monks living in the town were under siege by a band of human warriors that had been convinced by enemy agents to fight against the crown. A platoon of knights was once again put under the Defender of the Crown's army, whom with them managed to successfully defend Northshire Abbey in time. With the Abbey secured, the Defender of the Crown marched his army to the source of the attackers and laid waste to them. \nWith &lt;a href=\"Sunnyglade\"&gt;Sunnyglade&lt;/a&gt; completely overrun by the Orcish Horde, a group of scouts were sent into the remnants of the city to scout out the place; they reported back that the survivors had been taken to a hidden orcish compound to serve as slaves. Intelligence had also confirmed that all the slaves were grouped together in a offsite location and that an enclosure had to be destroyed in order to make a path for the prisoners from which they could escape from. The Defender of the Crown took a detachment of warriors to the town and managed to crush all opposition, destroying the orcish encampment in the process. With the peasants of Sunnyglade set free, the rebuilding of Sunnyglade was commenced.\nThe final march towards Stormwind Keep.\nAfter the destruction of &lt;a href=\"Sunnyglade\"&gt;Sunnyglade&lt;/a&gt;, the orcs mastered the newfound magic. With this power in their hands, the time was ripe to burn the human occupation from the nearby lands. The &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; held two outposts to the south of &lt;a href=\"Orgrim\"&gt;Orgrim&lt;/a&gt;'s encampment. After a reconnaissance of the area, orc scouts reported that the key to a victory for them in this confrontation would be to hold back the human forces at their bridges while strengthening the orc's attack force to prepare for a massive all-out attack. After all the troops were prepared, the attack commenced; the outposts were laid to waste and all the human troops were slain.\nAfter tasting victory at the battle in northern &lt;a href=\"Elwynn%20Forest\"&gt;Elwynn Forest&lt;/a&gt;, it was clear to Orgrim that one decisive blow to the Kingdom of Stormwind would make the total and complete domination of the humans a simple matter. His spies had gathered intelligence that pointed to an encampment near the center of the Kingdom, a place where their knights and soldiers were sent to be trained. Since the humans were not expecting an attack, it was a simple task. Orgrim's troops destroyed the entire place and left no survivors, in the process greatly weakening the Kingdom's forces.\nThe final march towards &lt;a href=\"Llane%20Wrynn%20I\"&gt;King Llane&lt;/a&gt;'s home, &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt;, was at hand. Only two settlements stood in the Orcish Horde's way. The hour of doom had arrived for the humans; Orgrim had ordered the complete and utter destruction of the twin cities, &lt;a href=\"Goldshire\"&gt;Goldshire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Moonbrook\"&gt;Moonbrook&lt;/a&gt;, in order to sever the lifeline between the King and his people. The orc troops, under the command of Orgrim, marched onto the twin cities, and after a lengthy battle, razed them both to the ground. With this decisive battle, the only stronghold that the Kingdom of Stormwind had left was the capital itself, Stormwind City.\nThe death of Medivh.\n&lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Garona%20Halforcen\"&gt;Garona&lt;/a&gt; were the first to discover that &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt; aided in the bringing of the Orcish Horde into &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. To attempt to try and find out how the orcs entered Azeroth and from where the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; came from, Garona requested that Khadgar summon a vision of the past concerning &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; and the Dark Portal; in the vision the two observed Gul'dan being given instructions by someone who referred to himself as the Guardian, whom Khadgar and Garona knew to be Medivh.\nAfter the horrifying discovery, Khadgar and Garona escaped from &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt; to bring the disturbing news to the King of Stormwind, &lt;a href=\"Llane%20Wrynn%20I\"&gt;King Llane&lt;/a&gt;, and to his Knight Champion, &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt;. While Lothar was quick to accept the news, the King had to take the matter into consideration. In the wee hours of the morning, without alerting the King, Lothar awoke Garona and Khadgar and led them to the top of one of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt;'s towers. There, waiting for the trio were a pack of gryphons (sent by the dwarves) and a couple of other footmen under Lothar's command. As soon as the group readied themselves, they took off to the tower of Karazhan. Lothar charged &lt;a href=\"Gavinrad%20the%20Dire\"&gt;Gavinrad&lt;/a&gt; with commanding Stormwind City's defenses in his absence. After arriving in the tower, the group couldn't find any trace of the Magus and declared that he had escaped. However, before leaving the tower, Garona managed to locate a hidden secret door leading into what seemed like an inverse version of Karazhan. As the company started their descent into the &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Karazhan\"&gt;inverse of Karazhan&lt;/a&gt;, a magic trap, set by Medivh, was triggered and unleashed a group of demonic beasts onto the company. While Lothar and his men held the beasts off, Khadgar and Garona continued their descent to find Medivh. Finally reaching the inverse observatory, the duo found Medivh.\nWhile the brace were confronting the Magus, Medivh confirmed to them that he truly was &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; and that he had been planning this war for hundreds of years; to free his physical form from his &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;tomb&lt;/a&gt; so that he could destroy Azeroth and all of its inhabitants. While Medivh was still talking, Garona attempted to stab him in the back but Medivh noticed her and cast a spell on her, causing her to stagger backwards. With this move, the brace started their attempts in disposing the Magus, but he proved to them that he was far too powerful for them to handle. Not long after their brawl, the duo was on their knees, dazed and wounded, and the Magus was preparing to kill Khadgar, but by a stroke of luck, the King's Champion, Lothar, appeared at the scene at this exact moment and forced his old friend to do battle with him in order to buy the others some time. While Lothar was keeping the Magus preoccupied, Khadgar managed to sneak around the room without being noticed. Lothar, in the end, too proved to be no match for the Master Mage and before long he too was wounded and dazed. With that being done the Magus returned to where Khadgar had been kneeling to finish him off, but to Medivh's surprise he was not there; Khadgar was standing behind Medivh with his sword pressed against Medivh's breast. At the first flinch from Medivh, Khadgar lunged forward and drove his rune sword into Medivh's heart, mortally wounding him in the process; with Medivh about to die, the Demon Lord Sargeras attempted to emerge from within the Magus to avoid being 'destroyed' along with Medivh, but before he could release himself, Sir Lothar decapitated Medivh's head, causing the titan to dissipate away and Medivh to die. Medivh was the first Guardian to be killed in combat in centuries.\nWith Medivh's death, Gul'dan was comatosed due to entering Medivh's mind to search for information at his time of death. Orgrim saw this as an opportunity to take down Blackhand, and so he marched to him and challenged him for supremacy of the Horde, a challenge which he won.\nThe second siege of Stormwind Keep and the fall of the kingdom.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Orcish Horde&lt;/a&gt; was gathered like buzzards to carrion, as the moment of destiny was close at hand. A low growl filled the air as the wolfriders whipped their savage mounts into a frenzy. The earth shook as catapults were loaded and moved into position. Under the mantle of Orgrim Doomhammer, the various orcish clans began their siege on &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt;. The catapults let loose their fiery rocks as the bulk of the main Horde marched towards the main gate, with the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock clan&lt;/a&gt; charging from the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Wall\"&gt;Eastern Wall&lt;/a&gt;. Within moments, Stormwind Keep was ablaze with shadows dancing on the walls. While the militia were busy trying to put out the fires, &lt;a href=\"Garona\"&gt;Garona&lt;/a&gt;, under the command of the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt;, assassinated &lt;a href=\"Llane%20Wrynn%20I\"&gt;King Llane&lt;/a&gt; while delivering her report, which stated that as long as a strong heart was on the throne, the mens' morale would not falter. With the assassination of the king, the men lost their morale and &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep%20%28WC1%20Orc%29\"&gt;Stormwind Keep fell&lt;/a&gt; under the might of the Orcish Horde.\nAftermath.\nThe aftermath of the war for the Orcish Horde.\nOrgrim, wanting to turn the Horde into an honorable force, tortured Garona into revealing whatever secrets lied beneath the Horde. Her non-orc blood made her too weak to withstand much pain, and she quickly revealed the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt; and its location. Orgrim burst into their meeting and slaughtered them on the spot, leaving only a couple of the warlocks, &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; alive. Soon after, Orgrim formed an alliance with Gul'dan and preparations for the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; began.\nThe aftermath of the war for the Kingdom of Stormwind.\n&lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt; had no other choice than to declare the war lost and save what remained by gathering the tattered remnants of the army and as many civilians as he could to lead them in a desperate &lt;a href=\"Refugee%23Exodus%20of%20Stormwind\"&gt;retreat&lt;/a&gt; across the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt;, toward the northern kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; to beseech aid from King &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;Terenas Menethil II&lt;/a&gt;. Not all survivors could flee on time and the orcish hunter &lt;a href=\"Quartermaster%20Zigris\"&gt;Zigris&lt;/a&gt; became infamous for tracking down Stormwind refugees and slaughtering them for sport.\nFollowing Lothar's impassioned speech in Lordaeron, Terenas called for an emergency council of war to discuss the Orcish threat. Terenas, through skilled political maneuvering, petitioned the support of the human kingdoms of &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Alterac&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; and also the city of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;. While most of the human nations banded together and pledged their support for this new alliance, &lt;a href=\"Aiden%20Perenolde\"&gt;King Perenolde&lt;/a&gt; of Alterac and &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;King Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; of Gilneas withheld their allegiance; Perenolde because he feared the humans would be defeated by the orcs, and Greymane because he felt that Gilneas was strong enough to stand on its own. With this, preparations for the Second War began.\nSome time after the end of the war, the &lt;a href=\"Stone%20of%20Remembrance\"&gt;Stone of Remembrance&lt;/a&gt;, a monument located in &lt;a href=\"Heroes%27%20Vigil\"&gt;Heroes' Vigil&lt;/a&gt; in the center of &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Cairn%20Lake\"&gt;Stone Cairn Lake&lt;/a&gt;, was erected to commemorate the humans who lost their lives during the war.\nSpeculation.\n&lt;a href=\"Jalod\"&gt;Jalod&lt;/a&gt; may have participated in the war.\nVideos.\n&lt;evlplayer&gt;\n&lt;/evlplayer&gt;"}

{"id": "14927", "revid": "39299307", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=14927", "title": "Fish", "text": "This page details fish, one of the six main types of &lt;a href=\"food\"&gt;food&lt;/a&gt; in WoW. Fish is the edible flesh of a fish or other aquatic animals, not necessarily in a biological sense. Most of these are represented as a single fish inventory item that stacks in twenties, as does most other food. Some aquatic or semi-aquatic animals, such as &lt;a href=\"crocolisk\"&gt;crocolisk&lt;/a&gt;s drop &lt;a href=\"meat\"&gt;meat&lt;/a&gt;, representing their flesh, not fish. Also, aquatic means dwells in water, but in WoW, some fish can be fished from other liquid environments, lava in particular.\nNot all fish are edible. Some fish are not of the item type fish (food), but may be a quest item, a non-edible alchemic ingredient, or other. Some fish with the food item type are only edible in certain cases (for example, as pet food). This article is about food item fish, and will briefly mention non-food fish only in the interests of disambiguation.\nRaw fish, cooked fish, and fish food buffs.\nMany fish can be &lt;a href=\"fishing%20items%23Normal_fish\"&gt;eaten raw&lt;/a&gt; (restore hit points when eaten). If you have the &lt;a href=\"cooking\"&gt;cooking&lt;/a&gt; secondary skill, you can cook many fish to increase their &lt;a href=\"fishing%20items%23Normal_fish\"&gt;food value&lt;/a&gt; (restore more hit points when eaten). Certain fish grant various &lt;a href=\"fishing%20items%23Buffing_fish\"&gt;temporary buffs&lt;/a&gt; when cooked and eaten.\nCooking fish is an excellent way to &lt;a href=\"Profession%23Companion%20professions\"&gt;raise your cooking skill&lt;/a&gt;. \nPet food.\n&lt;a href=\"Hunter\"&gt;Hunter&lt;/a&gt;s can feed fish to some &lt;a href=\"Hunter_pets%23Tamable_Beasts\"&gt;pet&lt;/a&gt;s, such as &lt;a href=\"cat\"&gt;cat&lt;/a&gt;s. Note that pets can eat fish that are not otherwise edible (such as &lt;a href=\"fishing%20items%23Trophy_fish\"&gt;trophy fish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Felblood%20Snapper\"&gt;Felblood Snapper&lt;/a&gt;), and the &lt;a href=\"item%20level\"&gt;item level&lt;/a&gt; of the fish is significant in how the pet reacts to the offer of the fish.\nVended Fish.\n\"See &lt;a href=\"fish%20vendors\"&gt;fish vendors&lt;/a&gt; for a list of fish vendors listed by main &lt;a href=\"faction\"&gt;faction&lt;/a&gt; affiliation.\" \n1 This is the base price before any discounts.\nNote that this is one representative fish for each food level increment - the vended foods generally follow this basic format, one representative item per food level universally repeated across all vendors of that food type. \nThe low to mid level fish on this table can be caught while fishing; the vendors sell the cooked version. The upper level fish on this table cannot (at this time) be caught while fishing; the equivalent level cooked caught fish are fish-based dishes, not an individual fish, so the vended version allows each vended fish to be an actual fish inventory item, and it is clearly a fish and can be fed to a fish eating pet.\nNorthrend.\n\"See the main article &lt;a href=\"Northrend%20Fish\"&gt;Northrend Fish&lt;/a&gt; for the list of fish introduced in the expansion.\"\nCataclysm.\n\"See the main article &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20Fish\"&gt;Cataclysm Fish&lt;/a&gt; for a list of fish introduced in the\" \"expansion.\"\nPandaria.\n\"See the main article &lt;a href=\"Pandaria%20fish\"&gt;Pandaria fish&lt;/a&gt; for a list of fish introduced in the\" \"expansion.\"\nDraenor.\n\"See the main article &lt;a href=\"Draenor%20fish\"&gt;Draenor fish&lt;/a&gt; for the list of fish introduced in the\" \"expansion.\"\nBroken Isles.\n\"See the main article &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles%20fish\"&gt;Broken Isles fish&lt;/a&gt; for the list of fish introduced in the\" \"expansion.\"\nKul Tiras and Zandalar.\n\"See the main articles &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiran%20fish\"&gt;Kul Tiran fish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20fish\"&gt;Zandalari fish&lt;/a&gt; for the list of fish introduced in the\" \"expansion.\"\nFish mobs.\n\"\" introduced several new fish mobs.

It allows adventurers to fish various objects, primarily fish and other waterbound creatures, from water, &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; and even liquid mercury. Many of these fish can be consumed immediately for a quantity of health restored, and can also be fed to &lt;a href=\"Hunter%20pet\"&gt;hunter pets&lt;/a&gt;. However, the true value of this scaly bounty comes when combined with the profession of Cooking; fish can be prepared and combined into innumerable different recipes, providing far greater restorative benefits, as well as a menagerie of potential stat buffs. Other, rarer fish are used in &lt;a href=\"Alchemy\"&gt;Alchemy&lt;/a&gt; recipes or provide stranger benefits, such as &lt;a href=\"Deviate%20Fish\"&gt;transformation into different appearances&lt;/a&gt; and even &lt;a href=\"Lunarfall%20Carp\"&gt;the summoning&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Frostdeep%20Minnow\"&gt;of rare mobs&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, those who choose to fish may find unfortunate sea creatures who &lt;a href=\"Bloated%20Barbed%20Gill%20Trout\"&gt;swallowed gems&lt;/a&gt;, as well as items (including wieldable fish such as &lt;a href=\"Old%20Crafty\"&gt;Old Crafty&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Old%20Ironjaw\"&gt;Old Ironjaw&lt;/a&gt;, and even the previously powerful ) and mounts (&lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea%20Ray%20%28mount%29\"&gt;Great Sea Ray (mount)&lt;/a&gt;). Many of these can be sold on the &lt;a href=\"Auction%20House\"&gt;Auction House&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis profession is one of the most underappreciated, in part due to the time commitment required; however, those who choose to explore the potential bounties of the seas and rivers of Azeroth and beyond will find many benefits. There is a small army of &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20fishing%20daily%20quests\"&gt;questgivers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fisherfriend%20of%20the%20Isles\"&gt;vendors&lt;/a&gt; linked to fishing, allowing access to &lt;a href=\"Darkwater%20Skate\"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Reins%20of%20the%20Azure%20Water%20Strider\"&gt;variety&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Reins%20of%20the%20Crimson%20Water%20Strider\"&gt;of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Brinedeep%20Bottom-Feeder\"&gt;mounts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hyper-Compressed%20Ocean\"&gt;toys&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bipsi%27s%20Bobbing%20Berg\"&gt;other perks&lt;/a&gt;-- there is even an entire faction in &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; dedicated to fishing, led by the most famous angler of all, &lt;a href=\"Nat%20Pagle\"&gt;Nat Pagle&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlthough fishing previously required an aspiring angler to equip one of the many types of &lt;a href=\"Fishing%20pole\"&gt;fishing poles&lt;/a&gt; found throughout the worlds, recent developments have allowed them to fish by simply receiving the appropriate training (which varies on an expansion-by-expansion basis) and clicking the button. Many choose to put the ability on their hotbar for easier recasting.\nHow to fish.\nIn its simplest form, fishing only requires the Fishing skill, taught by &lt;a href=\"fishing%20trainers\"&gt;fishing trainers&lt;/a&gt;. If one is just starting fishing, a &lt;a href=\"fishing%20pole\"&gt;fishing pole&lt;/a&gt; can be optional, sold by a general trade goods or fishing supplies &lt;a href=\"vendor\"&gt;vendor&lt;/a&gt;s. Fishing trainers and fishing supply vendors are often in the vicinity of fishable waters. When fishing without a pole, your character will make do with a reasonably straight branch with the end whittled smooth and a string tied to it. Once your fishing skill or level is high enough to benefit from fishing poles that increase your fishing skill, that would be a good time to acquire one. When fishing with a pole, &lt;a href=\"Fishing%20skill%20requirements%20by%20zone\"&gt;consider&lt;/a&gt; using a &lt;a href=\"fishing%20lure\"&gt;fishing lure&lt;/a&gt;, available from vendors that sell fishing supplies.\nAfter procuring the fishing skill, and if you like, a fishing pole, find a body of water; a pond, a lake, a river, a section of coast, a dock or pier, a moat, or something similar. To be fishable, a body of water has to be sufficiently deep - if it is not, you will get a warning that the water is not sufficiently deep and will be unable to fish at that location. Most bodies of water in &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; are deep enough, but some minor pools are not. The small ponds in the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Trials\"&gt;Valley of Trials&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt; do not support fishing, for example. If a fishing trainer is standing nearby, you can be sure the water is deep enough. If you are in a river and get the message, try moving up or downstream. If in a lake, try moving a bit into the lake.\nAlso, you can stand, sit, or even lie down while fishing. The &lt;a href=\"Fishing%20Chair\"&gt;Fishing Chair&lt;/a&gt; is unnecessary, but a nice touch. You can be on land or in the water and fish, but you can not be swimming. This will, of course, vary with the character's race, as shorter races cannot stand in deeper water as a taller race. A class with an ability to travel on water will also have an advantage.\nWhile facing the water, equip the fishing pole, and/or use your Fishing skill (found in the professions tab of your spellbook) to cast the fishing line. Your character will cast the fishing line in the direction he is facing, with minor random deviations in length and angle of the cast. If you miss the body of water (\"Your cast did not land in fishable water\"), you may wish to adjust the direction your character is facing and/or simply cast Fishing again.\nFishing is like channeling a spell, counting down from 21 seconds to 0 seconds. A fishing bobber will appear somewhere in the water in front of you, and you'll notice that your character will start channeling the Fishing spell. Move your cursor over the bobber and it will turn into the standard interaction cursor. Wait for your bobber to splash, then click it (within 3\u20134 seconds) to draw the fishing line in. Depending on the area you're fishing and your fishing skill, you may either catch something useful, or you will catch a junk item like Driftwood. You can then repeat the whole process by using the Fishing skill again.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Fishing%20items\"&gt;items you can fish up&lt;/a&gt; depend on the &lt;a href=\"region\"&gt;region&lt;/a&gt; you are in; the different sub-zones within any given region will usually yield the same fish. There are a few exceptions to this: for example bodies of fresh water (lakes or streams) will yield different fish from seawater. Schools of fish also have their own distinct contents. Some locations have distinctive items that you might occasionally fish up. In addition, if your skill level is too low for an area you will receive junk items rather than fish (see &lt;a href=\"%23Fishing%20level%20requirements\"&gt;Fishing level requirements&lt;/a&gt; below). These junk items are the same for different regions; you will catch the same junk in &lt;a href=\"Feralas\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt; that you caught behind &lt;a href=\"Lion%27s%20Pride%20Inn\"&gt;Lion's Pride Inn&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Goldshire\"&gt;Goldshire&lt;/a&gt; when your skill is too low.\nTechnical information.\nYou can move your character so that they are mostly submerged in the water (but not swimming) and angled so that no casts will go onto land or shallow water. If you are having trouble seeing the bobber bob when a fish is on your line, you may want to zoom in so you are looking in 1st person. If you are fishing alone, you can hear your bobber splash; in a group, all of the bobbers sound the same.\nFishing pools.\nFishing pools are objects found in bodies of water and other liquids (lava, most notably) throughout the many zones of Azeroth and beyond. These pools can be roughly divided into two subcategories:\nBoth of these can be located on the map with the &lt;a href=\"Find%20Fish\"&gt;Find Fish&lt;/a&gt; ability, which is learned from the &lt;a href=\"Weather-Beaten%20Journal\"&gt;Weather-Beaten Journal&lt;/a&gt;. Similarly, both will also respawn as appropriate to the circumstance, similar to mining nodes.\nSchools of fish may not respawn if the event associated to them, such as the Pandaren Fish of the Day or the &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Fishing%20Extravaganza\"&gt;Stranglethorn Fishing Extravaganza&lt;/a&gt;, ends before they can do so. Existing pools will also despawn at this time.\nTime of day / seasons.\nSome fish may only be caught during specific times of day or season. Nocturnal fish can be caught from 6 PM to 12 AM (18:00 - 0:00), diurnal fish from 6 AM to 12 PM (6:00 - 12:00), which is based on the &lt;a href=\"server\"&gt;server&lt;/a&gt;'s time.\nOther fish such as &lt;a href=\"Stonescale%20Eel\"&gt;Stonescale Eel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Plated%20Armorfish\"&gt;Plated Armorfish&lt;/a&gt; have been rumored to only appear during certain times of the day - however, all of these can be caught 24 hours a day.\nIt is known that &lt;a href=\"Winter%20Squid\"&gt;Winter Squid&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Raw%20Summer%20Bass\"&gt;Raw Summer Bass&lt;/a&gt; appear during their respective seasons. During Autumn and Spring, they can both apparently be caught, although the frequency of each might scale throughout the season.\nThe servertime is cut up into several cycles, not just Day/Night:\nFishing level requirements.\nThe mechanics of fishing skill levels were changed significantly in &lt;a href=\"patch%203.1\"&gt;patch 3.1&lt;/a&gt;. Prior to 3.1, each zone had a minimum skill requirement to be able to cast in that zone and a cap where you achieved a 100% catch rate in that zone. In between there was a chance your fish could \"get away\"; you would catch nothing and receive no skill-up for that cast. As of 3.1, there is no longer a minimum skill requirement to fish in any zone, and all casts will catch something and award a chance for a skill-up. However, if your skill level is too low for a zone, you will catch mostly &lt;a href=\"vendor%20trash\"&gt;vendor trash&lt;/a&gt; items. The skill level required to guarantee \"no junk\" catches is equivalent to the old \"no getaway\" level. The easiest areas have very low skill level caps, allowing you higher success initially. You will need to have one point of fishing skill (apprentice level fishing training) to fish these.\n\"For information on fishing locations and fishing skill requirements, see &lt;a href=\"Fishing%20skill%20requirements%20by%20zone\"&gt;Fishing skill requirements by zone&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nTraining.\nFishing previously involved a single large skill number that was increased on an expansion by expansion basis. It has since been reworked alongside other professions, however, to be regionalized; fishing in the Outland, for example, will level the skill for that region only. Before this change there were also books that had to be obtained to learn Expert and Master level fishing (for Outland and Northrend, respectively) and a quest offered by &lt;a href=\"Nat%20Pagle\"&gt;Nat Pagle&lt;/a&gt; for the Artisan level. These have been removed, and those who completed the latter requirement before Patch 3.1 can return to Nat Pagle to receive &lt;a href=\"Nat%27s%20Lucky%20Fishing%20Pole\"&gt;Nat's Lucky Fishing Pole&lt;/a&gt;, the reward for the current and minimized edition of that quest.\nTo learn how to fish, one must speak to a trainer for the appropriate region. These vary based on faction as well as location.\nIncreasing fishing skill.\nTo increase their fishing skill, an angler need only fish in a region for which they have unlocked the appropriate skill. This may at first lead to them catching more grey trash items than fish, but as their skill increases, this will change. Using temporary skill increases (through one or more of the items seen in the section below) will help remedy this earlier and lead to earlier positive results. In addition, fishing daily and world quests may grant permanent skill increases.\nItems that increase fishing skill.\nThere are many items that increase fishing skill beyond the innate skill a character has acquired:\nFishing poles.\n&lt;a href=\"Fishing%20pole\"&gt;Fishing pole&lt;/a&gt;s replace the basic Fishing Pole (or the random stick used if no fishing pole is available) and provide a fishing skill bonus when wielded.\nFishing line.\n&lt;a href=\"Fishing%20pole%23Fishing%20line\"&gt;Fishing line&lt;/a&gt;s are consumables that create a permanent enchantment on a fishing pole. These can only be applied to a fishing pole in your own inventory. You cannot put a line on someone else's soulbound fishing pole.\nSkill lures.\n&lt;a href=\"Fishing%20lure\"&gt;Fishing lure&lt;/a&gt;s are consumables that create a temporary enchantment on a fishing pole. \n\"Legion\" lures.\nThis is a list of rare bait that can be caught in the Broken Isles; the chance to catch a given zone's bait is increased by the Arcane Lure. The bait items can be purchased from vendors in their respective zones for tokens fished up near the location of the vendor or (not including those with limited durations) bought from the &lt;a href=\"Auction%20House\"&gt;Auction House&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, this bait may also be caught from a &lt;a href=\"Hyper-Compressed%20Ocean\"&gt;Hyper-Compressed Ocean&lt;/a&gt;. \nFishing apparel.\nFishing apparel items provide a fishing skill bonus when worn.\nEnchantments for apparel items.\nEnchantments for apparel items create a permanent fishing skill bonus on an item, which is then worn to apply the fishing skill bonus.\nConsumables.\nConsumable items provide a temporary fishing skill bonus when consumed by the character.\nOther Items.\nThese items, which are reusable, also provide buffs to fishing skill.\nItems you can fish up.\nThe following general classes of &lt;a href=\"Fishing%20items\"&gt;items can be obtained through Fishing&lt;/a&gt;:\nBest class for fishing.\nCharacters of any class and any level can successfully fish, but there may be some minor differences between classes, for those considering this choice\nThere are three factors taken in consideration, though whatever weight they have is pretty personal and/or dependent on location:\nAlthough it is unlikely that one will necessarily choose their class or race based on their ability to fish, stranger things have certainly happened on Azeroth:\nIt should also be noted that taller races will have an easier time wading out farther than gnomes or goblins to fish in pools farther from shore.

There are many kinds of items that can be caught using the fishing skill, going far beyond the denizens of the deep. Containers holding long-lost loot, legendary monsters and even weapons and armor can be retrieved from the waters with enough patience, skill and time. \nFish.\nIn WoW, some fished water (or lava) creatures are not in a biological sense, although most are fish. There are many kinds of &lt;a href=\"fish\"&gt;fish&lt;/a&gt; that can be caught. Most fit a specific game function category; some fish overlap more than one category. \nFish listed on this page are caught by fishing, but some &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s, such as &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt;s will drop some these same fish, and some vendors sell some of these same fish. \nSome fish are only sold by vendors and cannot be caught by fishing. These are just like any other vended food, but have the food type 'fish' which matters mainly to &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s for their &lt;a href=\"hunter%20pet\"&gt;hunter pet&lt;/a&gt;s. \nSome fish, such as the &lt;a href=\"Threshadon\"&gt;Threshadon&lt;/a&gt;s, are water mobs and are killed in combat, not fished. Mobs have a graphic model that can be interacted with. Fished items generally have no specific graphic representation until they are caught, then appear as an inventory icon. \nNote that, in terms of the \"Cooking Skill Required\" as it appears in the tables below, each of these reflects the individualized cooking skill of the expansion that these fish were introduced in.\nEastern Kingdoms and Kalimdor.\nThese fish can be caught in various areas around the Eastern Kingdoms and Kalimdor. Slitherskin Mackerel can also be caught on the Lost Isles. The fish in the below table can be consumed raw or cooked with recipes in order to increase their benefits.\n\u2020 \"These are seasonal fish; the Winter Squid can only be caught from Sep. 23 to March 20. The Summer Bass can only be caught from March 20 to Sep. 23.\" \nThe fish below can mostly be consumed for food, giving similar benefits to those in the above table. Many of them are also part of Alchemy recipes or give unique, non-health effects.\nOutlands.\nA number of interesting grey-quality items can also be fished up in the Outlands, most of them in Zangarmarsh:\nMr. Pinchy.\nA unique fishing experience awaits adventurers in the Terokkar Forest. &lt;a href=\"Highland%20Mixed%20School\"&gt;Highland Mixed Schools&lt;/a&gt; have a small chance of providing the rare &lt;a href=\"Mr.%20Pinchy\"&gt;Mr. Pinchy&lt;/a&gt; item. Much like the uncertainty of every cast that may have led to the new owner of this item finding it, Pinchy will provide a different effect upon use; each one of these items have three charges. The possible results are:\nDalaran.\nMargoss' Retreat.\nThe above-mentioned Emblem of Margoss will teleport the user to a small floating island near Dalaran. There players can find the eccentric &lt;a href=\"Conjurer%20Margoss\"&gt;Conjurer Margoss&lt;/a&gt; and his despondent familiar &lt;a href=\"Blythe%20%28elemental%29\"&gt;Blythe&lt;/a&gt;. The former has forsaken his commitment to the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; in favor of focusing his favorite hobby: fishing! Should they choose to do so, players can join him, fishing from the small pond he lords over: \nAlchemic fish.\nSome fish are used in &lt;a href=\"Alchemy\"&gt;Alchemy&lt;/a&gt; to create potions and oils. Alchemic fish have the item type and subtype Trade Goods, Other, except Deviate Fish is a Consumable, Food &amp; Drink.\nQuest fish.\nSome fish are the object of a quest. They may or may not have other uses, and may appear in other sections of this page detailing that use.\nThe quest fish that are only used in a quest are typically a quest item type, and can only be caught while you are doing the quest. These will also typically have no vend value. Red Snapper, a typical quest item type quest fish, cannot be fed to a cat hunter pet that eats fish. \nSome of these quests are repeatable. The quest fish for repeatable quests are typically not a quest type item and can be caught, traded, and vended normally.\n&lt;a href=\"Speckled%20Tastyfish\"&gt;Speckled Tastyfish&lt;/a&gt; are the object of the &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Fishing%20Extravaganza\"&gt;Stranglethorn Fishing Extravaganza&lt;/a&gt; fishing competition, and disappear from all players' inventory four hours after the competition, so that each week's competition starts with zero fish already caught. The secondary 'quest' for these fish is a special turn-in to redeem these fish for cash before they disappear.\nSpecial Notes: \nTrophy fish.\n\"See &lt;a href=\"Trophy%20fish\"&gt;main article&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nCertain uncommon fish can be caught which can be wielded in the &lt;a href=\"off%20hand\"&gt;off hand&lt;/a&gt;, with the exception of the trophy groupers and trophy lobsters which can not. Equipping the trophy fish in the off-hand will not show the fish on the character, but if the trophy fish is equipped, typing 'z' to show the wielded weapons will show the trophy fish. \nTrophy fish are wieldable objects, they do not stack in your inventory. Each takes a slot, except see the wieldable cooking ingredient fish, which do stack.\nThese fish include the following: \nThese &lt;a href=\"bind%20on%20pickup\"&gt;bind on pickup&lt;/a&gt; and cannot be traded, and are very rare (estimated roughly 0.1% of catches in their respective locations.)\nThe &lt;a href=\"%23Quest%20fish\"&gt;quest fish&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Feralas%20Ahi\"&gt;Feralas Ahi&lt;/a&gt; can be wielded in the off-hand as a trophy fish, but the Feralas Ahi can only be caught when you are on the quest, the fish has the &lt;a href=\"unique\"&gt;unique&lt;/a&gt; property, so you can only have one, and the fish must be turned in to complete the &lt;a href=\"Nat%20Pagle%2C%20Angler%20Extreme\"&gt;Nat Pagle, Angler Extreme&lt;/a&gt; quest which grants &lt;a href=\"artisan\"&gt;artisan&lt;/a&gt; level fishing skill, raising the fishing skill cap from 225 to 300, so most people who catch it will prefer to turn it in than to display it. It can be used as a trophy fish while you are on the quest.\nMr. Pinchy.\nThis very rare fish has a few magic effects. He binds on pickup. You'll need flight capability to even try to obtain him. &lt;a href=\"Mr.%20Pinchy\"&gt;Mr. Pinchy&lt;/a&gt; has three wish charges with one of five possibilities.\nContainers.\nSeveral kinds of containers can be fished. \nContainers must be opened in order to loot the contents. After the container is fully looted, the container disappears. Except Clams (since &lt;a href=\"patch%203.0.2\"&gt;patch 3.0.2&lt;/a&gt;) containers do not stack in your inventory, each takes a slot. Looting them can often save space since the loot will often stack.\nIf a container looks empty, but does not disappear, it still contains an item that you cannot see. Often the item is a , which is not visible to you once you have learned the skill it grants. These containers can be sold to other players who need the Weather-Beaten Journal.\nContainer fish.\nThe Bloated variety of container fish are exceptionally rare fish caught in the same waters of their non-bloated counterparts (with the exception of the Giant Sunfish and the Barbed Gill Trout; the trout being a quest fish). They all can be caught in the same area as the non-bloated variety, but are only containers; they can't be used as food and disappear after they are opened. A few of these fish are part of fishing quests and require catching and opening to obtain the quest objectives. \nClams.\nVarious &lt;a href=\"Clam\"&gt;Clam&lt;/a&gt;s can be fished and should be opened for clam meats and occasional &lt;a href=\"pearl\"&gt;pearl&lt;/a&gt;s. With the release of patch 3.0, clams are now stackable save for the &lt;a href=\"Brooding%20Darkwater%20Clam\"&gt;Brooding Darkwater Clam&lt;/a&gt;; this is a rarer catch and was inserted into the game as a result of this post: http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=9957005708&amp;pageNo=2&amp;sid=1#32\nVenture Company crates.\nThese infrequently-found non-locked &lt;a href=\"Venture%20Company\"&gt;Venture Company&lt;/a&gt; crates are labeled \"Venture Company Supplies\" and always contain a small quantity of engineering supplies such as &lt;a href=\"Rough%20Blasting%20Powder\"&gt;Rough Blasting Powder&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Strut\"&gt;Iron Strut&lt;/a&gt;, etc.\nTrunks &amp; Crates.\nThese boxes may also contain the &lt;a href=\"Weather-Beaten%20Journal\"&gt;Weather-Beaten Journal&lt;/a&gt; which is used to learn &lt;a href=\"Find%20Fish\"&gt;Find Fish&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocked chests.\nThese infrequently-found chests are locked and can be opened by a rogue or blacksmith and/or engineer. These chests have rather disappointing contents compared to the Trunks routinely fished from &lt;a href=\"Floating%20Wreckage\"&gt;Floating Wreckage&lt;/a&gt;.\nOther.\n&lt;a href=\"Message%20in%20a%20Bottle\"&gt;Message in a Bottle&lt;/a&gt; are infrequently found from ocean fishing in zones of level 20-40. \nContents may include:\n&lt;a href=\"Inscribed%20Scrollcase\"&gt;Inscribed Scrollcase&lt;/a&gt;, found in Outland, contains scrolls.\nOther objects.\nPotions.\nVarious common potions are occasionally caught while fishing.\nRumsey Rums.\nSeveral varieties of &lt;a href=\"Rumsey%20Rum%20%28brand%29\"&gt;Rumsey Rum brand&lt;/a&gt; alcoholic beverage are occasionally caught while fishing from &lt;a href=\"Floating%20Wreckage\"&gt;Floating Wreckage&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to getting you drunk, these provide a stamina buff.\nCrafting ingredients.\nSeveral items generally obtained through other means can also occasionally turn up while fishing.\nElemental goods.\nThese drop from various elementals, but can also be fished. &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt; sometimes has &lt;a href=\"Patch%20of%20Elemental%20Water\"&gt;Patch of Elemental Water&lt;/a&gt; Pools that will spawn, and &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt; will sometimes have &lt;a href=\"Pure%20Water\"&gt;Pure Water&lt;/a&gt; Pools. These pools have an increased rate of elemental water catches.\nWeapons and armor.\nVarious weapon items or armor items are occasionally caught while fishing. This list is not intended to be an all-inclusive list, but only a list of those items that you can ONLY obtain via fishing. The Crushfish, Strongfish and Herring have the added benefit of looking like fish as you wield them.\nWeapons and armor unique to fishing:\nVendor Quality Items.\nVarious &lt;a href=\"Vendor%20trash\"&gt;Vendor trash&lt;/a&gt; items can be caught while fishing. \nThe mechanics of fishing skill level were changed significantly in &lt;a href=\"patch%203.1\"&gt;patch 3.1&lt;/a&gt;. Prior to 3.1, each zone had a minimum skill requirement to be able to cast in that zone, and a cap where you achieved a 100% catch rate in that zone. In between there was a chance your fish could \"get away\"; you would catch nothing and receive no skill-up for that cast.\nAs of 3.1, there is no longer a minimum skill requirement to fish in any zone, and all casts will catch something and award a chance for a skill-up. However, if your skill level is too low for a zone, you will catch mostly junk items. The skill level required to guarantee \"no junk\" catches is equivalent to the old \"no get away\" level. \nThe following list of \"junk\" items are specific to fishing: \n\u2020 The Old Teamster's Skull is a reference to real-life Teamster Jimmy Hoffa, who famously went missing.\nQuest items.\nSome fished items are the object of a quest. These are typically a quest item type, are only used in that quest, and can only be caught while you are doing the quest. These will typically have no vend value, but note that 'Strange Engine Part' can be caught outside the quest (since it starts the quest) and vends for . The quest is repeatable, although you can only have one active quest at a time."}

The 100% catch skill level is the skill level at which every catch in open water is likely to result in a fish catch and the likelihood of catching vendor trash is nearly nil.

{"id": "32598", "revid": "39299307", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=32598", "title": "Fishing lure", "text": "Fishing lures are items that allow you to increase your &lt;a href=\"fishing\"&gt;fishing&lt;/a&gt; skill for a short amount of time.\nThere are various types of fishing lures and they may be bought from &lt;a href=\"vendor\"&gt;vendor&lt;/a&gt;s or crafted by an &lt;a href=\"engineer\"&gt;engineer&lt;/a&gt;.\nFishing lures create a temporary buff to fishing skill as an enchantment on your &lt;a href=\"fishing%20pole\"&gt;fishing pole&lt;/a&gt;.\nFishing lures provide much greater enhancement to fishing skill than is available through other &lt;a href=\"Fishing%20equipment\"&gt;fishing gear&lt;/a&gt;.\nMost fishing lures are used by right-clicking on the lure while you have a fishing pole equipped. This consumes the lure and creates a temporary fishing skill buff on the fishing pole. The Weather-Beaten Fishing Hat is not a lure, but right-clicking on the hat to use it allows you to \"pull a lure from the hat\" and apply it - with a ten-minute cool down, you can apply these continually and keep a +75 buff on your fishing rod. Only one fishing lure can be used at a time.\nMost fishing lures have a fishing skill requirement. The Weather-Beaten Fishing Hat has no explicit requirements, but it is Bind on Pickup, you must be level 10 to do the daily fishing quests that award it.\nFishing lures can increase your fishing skill &lt;a href=\"Fishing%20skill%20requirements%20by%20zone\"&gt;to be able to fish in a more difficult location or to be able to fish there reliably.&lt;/a&gt; Fishing reliably means less fish 'get away' - making your gaming time more productive. Fishing skill above the skill required for 100% catch rate is wasted, so you do not always need to equip a lure. For example, the +25 fishing skill &lt;a href=\"Shiny%20Bauble\"&gt;Shiny Bauble&lt;/a&gt; lure would be helpful when you are first starting out (or you can endure a few missed fish), but once you've caught around 30 fish, it would be superfluous to use a lure in your starting area.\nEven with maximized skill and many other skill enhancements, it is possible to fish up junk in the highest-level areas, such as &lt;a href=\"Uldum\"&gt;Uldum&lt;/a&gt;. Thus, fishing lures are always useful."}
{"id": "17101", "revid": "49848256", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=17101", "title": "Fishing pole", "text": "A fishing pole is a physical tool that can be used to practice the &lt;a href=\"fishing\"&gt;fishing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"profession\"&gt;profession&lt;/a&gt;. \nFishing pole.\nA fishing pole is in the &lt;a href=\"two-handed\"&gt;two-handed&lt;/a&gt; weapon item class, and can be wielded as a melee weapon, but is primarily intended for use while fishing. As a two-handed item, only one can be equipped at a time, and no item can be held in the off-hand.\nIf one is just starting fishing, a fishing pole can be optional, sold by a general trade goods or fishing supplies &lt;a href=\"vendor\"&gt;vendor&lt;/a&gt;s. Fishing trainers and fishing supply vendors are often in the vicinity of fishable waters. When fishing without a pole, your character will make do with a reasonably straight branch with the end whittled smooth and a string tied to it. Once your fishing skill or level is high enough to benefit from fishing poles that increase your fishing skill, that would be a good time to acquire one. When fishing with a pole, &lt;a href=\"Fishing%20skill%20requirements%20by%20zone\"&gt;consider&lt;/a&gt; using a &lt;a href=\"fishing%20lure\"&gt;fishing lure&lt;/a&gt;, available from vendors that sell fishing supplies. \nRequired levels in parentheses are implicit requirements imposed by the game that are higher than the explicit requirement property of the object: \nThe basic Fishing Pole has no level requirement (but all characters are at least level 1) and no fishing skill requirement. You can purchase it, wield it, and use it as a melee weapon with no fishing training, but you cannot fish with it until you are a train in Apprentice Fishing, giving you fishing skill level 1. Again, this is optional, and if a pole is the only fishing equipment you can use, you may consider saving your copper and doing without.\nStaats' Fishing Pole has an explicit fishing skill level requirement of 1, but the quest requires you to catch and turn in four &lt;a href=\"Darkshore%20Grouper\"&gt;Darkshore Grouper&lt;/a&gt;s before it awards you the pole. If your fishing skill level is low, you will level your fishing skill while completing this quest; the exact amount will vary, depending on what portion of your catches are Darkshore Grouper, but brand new fishers will skill up at least 6 times, taking them to at least skill level 7, before they acquire the Staats' pole.\nOther fishing poles with no explicit level requirements have an implicit level requirement in the quest to obtain them. \nThe Arcanite Fishing Pole has no explicit level requirement, however must be level 35 to train in Artisan level fishing in order to reach fishing skill level 300 and equip the Arcanite Fishing Rod. You can acquire it earlier, but not equip it. Competing in the Stranglethorn Fishing Extravaganza requires 130 fishing skill in order to fish, 225 fishing skill to fish with none getting away (it is a competition) (this can be done with Journeyman training, 150 fishing skill level, and &lt;a href=\"Fishing%20lure\"&gt;lures&lt;/a&gt;), has level 31-40 mobs, and PvP if you are on a PvP server (turn off your flag for this event if you are not) (these hazards can be handled at a low level with a group of higher level friends as guards). \nAlso note that only one Stranglethorn Fishing Extravaganza prize is given out each week - this is effectively a seven day cool down per attempt to obtain one.\nThe Big Iron Fishing Pole can be wielded at level 25. Mobs in Desolace, where the Big Iron Fishing Pole can be found, are in the 31-40 level range. The &lt;a href=\"Shellfish%20Trap\"&gt;Shellfish Trap&lt;/a&gt;s from which the Big Iron Fishing Poles are randomly looted also randomly spawn a hostile level 35 or 36 &lt;a href=\"makrura\"&gt;makrura&lt;/a&gt;. Strategies for obtaining a Big Iron Fishing Pole are: &lt;a href=\"Auction%20House\"&gt;Auction House&lt;/a&gt;, high level assistance, perhaps twink gear, but then why not just buy the pole, hand-me-down from someone (&lt;a href=\"alt\"&gt;alt&lt;/a&gt;?) who got a better pole, willingness to randomly loot a Shellfish Trap and accept your fortune (then swim back and try again until you get one), or wait until a higher level. By level 40ish, this should not be difficult, and you probably do not need it before then. Remember that temporary shortfalls in fishing skill can be made up using lures.\nFishing line.\nThe Fishing line items produce a permanent fishing skill enchantment on a fishing pole:\nThe fishing skill requirement to use the fishing line is the fishing skill required to expend the enchantment charge and apply it to a fishing pole. The requirements of the fishing pole are not changed, nor does an unbound pole become bound. \nYou must be level 70 to participate in the daily fishing quests, so the Spun Truesilver Fishing Line has an implicit level requirement.\nThe High Test Eternium Fishing Line has no explicit level requirement, and the turn-in to obtain it is not competitive (not in the sense that only one is awarded). A low level character fishing in Stranglethorn Vale's coastal waters will require assistance.\nBoth of these items can be obtained multiple times. You will only have a use for a couple at most for your self as you progress through pole upgrades. The vend price is a pittance relative their value, and they cannot be traded, since they are BoP items, but they can be applied to tradable fishing poles, which can still be traded after line is applied.\nFishing pole with fishing line.\nBecause the Fishing Line items produce a permanent fishing skill enchantment on a fishing pole (consuming the fishing line), they can be viewed as an investment in your fishing pole. As a rule, since the fishing lines have limited availability, you won't want to outright waste them. Here's the poles with the lines applied:\nThe four best poles are good candidates for application; discounting the Arcanite Fishing Pole as an obvious candidate, but with severely limited availability, the next three are close in fishing skill bonus, and each has a niche - Big Iron can be traded to alts, Seth's has the best combat stats, and Nat Pagle's has the best fishing skill bonus. \nAlso, the Darkwood Fishing Pole is so rare that, well, first off it's a non-issue, but if you happen to have one, it should probably be worth a fortune - even with mediocre stats. It fills a niche, and it's totally a seller's market. So don't feel too bad about buffing it, if you want to.\nThe table shows that it would be a waste to apply a fishing line to a basic Fishing Pole when the Strong Fishing Pole is readily available cheaply and gives the same fishing bonus. Same for the Blump pole, when a Strong pole provides a cheap +2 more fishing skill. Catch nine fish to skill up your fishing skill to 10 and invest in at least a Strong pole if you are going to apply a fishing line to a low bonus pole.\nThat leaves only the Strong pole as a questionable investment of a fishing line - you may use it for many levels if you fish, but you will outgrow it, and you don't really need the small bonus to fishing skill that it provides while you are leveling your character and your fishing skill. Fishing lures provide much more skill bonus and are cheap. If you fished Stranglethorn at a low level an have a small stack of fishing lines, well, \"maybe\" wasting one isn't such a bad thing. (I don't even recommend the Strong fishing pole, period. The small bonuses are unnecessary, and the cheap basic Fishing Pole can be thrown away when your bags get too full and is easily replaced near any auction house.)\nUsing a fishing pole as a weapon.\nA fishing pole is in the &lt;a href=\"Two-handed\"&gt;Two-handed&lt;/a&gt; weapon item class, and can be wielded as a melee weapon, but is not a weapon type associated with a weapon skill. When you wield a fishing pole as a weapon, your fishing skill is your weapon skill. You can observe this in your crit probability with a fishing pole wielded; your crit will go up 0.04% for each fishing skill point. Furthermore, all fishing skill buffs directly add to this. A +100 fishing skill lure adds 4% crit probability, and a Big Iron Fishing Pole has an 0.8% crit bonus over a basic Fishing Pole. Since you can achieve 225 fishing skill at character level 10, a fishing pole is not an insignificant weapon.\nFishing poles will not accept weapon enchantments; they will only accept fishing enchantments, such as fishing lines and lures, but these help the melee use of the pole. \nFishing poles will not work with special abilities that require a melee weapon. Many special abilities do not require a melee weapon and will work anyway. \nWielding a fishing pole in combat will not raise your fishing skill nor your other combat skills. \nFishing poles have a durability stat and accumulate damage when used as a weapon, just like any other weapon.\nAs a two-handed item, only one can be equipped at a time, and no item can be held in the off-hand.\nAs you can see from the tooltips, the swing rate is slow. All are speed 3.0.\nAnd, of course, there are no suitable combat stat bonuses on the fishing pole, except Seth's has +52 Stamina. \n you are using your fishing pole in combat, upgrading your basic Fishing Pole to at least the Staats' or Strong fishing poles is recommended. Their fishing bonus is not significant, but they have significantly better damage stats than the basic fishing pole. \nThe awe factor of beating someone in &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt; with a fishing implement is phenomenal.\nSee El's forum for more discussion about using a fishing pole as a weapon, linked provided below. \nAs a figure of merit for combat purposes, DPS seems more significant than Skill Bonus for these fishing poles. Skill Bonus is an add onto an already big number (discounting the exception that when you are starting out, your base skill is miniscule), whereas DPS is the whole deal for fishing pole DPS. \nAnother approach to a rough figure of merit would be to calculate your effective skill for each pole with the buffs you intend to use and multiply that times the DPS, then rank the results. That would weigh both factors equally. Column FM-1 is that figure of merit for a character with fishing skill of 225 and a +75 fishing lure. Column FM-2 is that figure of merit for a character with maxed fishing skill of 375 and a +100 fishing lure. (Can't equip the Arcanite Fishing Pole with 225 fishing skill; shown in gray for comparison.) For these two examples, the results track closely with just considering DPS alone. Lower total skill will weigh the fishing pole's bonuses more heavily, but very low skill won't be a factor. Anyone serious about trying this would want to max their fishing skill.\nNone of these factor in the benefit of +52 stamina in combat. A better figure of merit would weigh your total effective stamina or total effective hit point as a factor. You could estimate how much difference that would make by multiplying the Seth's pole figures of merit times (your stamina +52) divided by (your stamina).\nIf you want to use a fishing pole in combat, hang on to your Seth's pole even when you get a 'better' pole."}

Typically, a higher portion of more desirable items can be fished within a fishing pool. Fishing pool is a more general term; &lt;a href=\"School%20of%20Fish\"&gt;School of Fish&lt;/a&gt; is a fishing pool that contains (primarily) fish. School of Fish can also mean a kind of &lt;a href=\"critter\"&gt;critter&lt;/a&gt; object in WoW that is not directly fishable (but appears only in fishable waters), and so fishing pool is more specific as regards the fishing profession; School of Fish critter objects are not fishing pools.\nFishing.\nFishing pools are shallow cylindrical regions within fishable water. They designate small regions within fishable water that give better kinds of catches than the surrounding water. Some fish can only be obtained from Fishing pools.\nIn order to fish a Fishing pool, your bobber must be within the circular area on the surface of the water that defines the boundaries of the fishing pool. Only the top surface has significance for fishing.\nTo do this, face the pool, pole in hand. Cast, then if you want to only fish the pool, recast each time you miss. An &lt;a href=\"AddOn\"&gt;AddOn&lt;/a&gt; such as Fishing Buddy can make this easier to do.\nIf your bobber lands close to the boundary of the pool, it may be unclear if it is within the pool or not. You can often tell from what you catch, but if you are in a hurry you may not want to wait.\nSome of the uncertainty is from the 3-D nature of the pool. Depending on the type of pool, it may be partly outlined by fish &lt;a href=\"critter\"&gt;critter&lt;/a&gt;s swimming within the pool boundaries. These will be under the surface of the pool and from your point of view will appear to be offset toward you on the surface. Also, some of the defining graphics fade in and out, simulating the effects of light on water.\nAnother visual challenge is that the barrels and crates in a Floating Wreckage pool can somewhat obscure your bobber. Also, they are slightly bobbing, and can make your bobber seem to be bobbing prematurely relative to themselves. (Enabling sound effects can avoid this problem, if you're not near other fishers; just listen for the splash.)\nFishing pools never yield junk, even at a skill level of 1, and they give skillups just as fast as the surrounding water.\nFishing pools are not permanent, but appear and remain until fished out (like &lt;a href=\"Vein\"&gt;mineral nodes&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;a href=\"mining\"&gt;mined out&lt;/a&gt;) then respawn at a different location. The respawn rules vary, some types have a delay, some do not.\nTypes.\nEastern Kingdoms and Kalimdor schools.\n\u2020Muddy Churning Waters and Speckled Tastyfish Pools were removed in Patches 4.0.3 and 5.1.0 respectively.\nDraenor schools.\nThe continent of is available to players with the &lt;a href=\"Warlords%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Warlords of Draenor&lt;/a&gt; expansion.\nBroken Isles schools.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt; is available to players with the &lt;a href=\"Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt; expansion.\nKul Tiran and Zandalarian schools.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt; schools are available to players within the expansion.\nSeveral rare schools of fish related to the &lt;a href=\"Underlight%20Angler\"&gt;Underlight Angler&lt;/a&gt;, both in obtaining it and leveling it up:\nIn addition, a handful of other fishing pools were added to newer zones later in the expansion:\nShadowlands Pools.\nThese schools are available to players within the expansion:\nSpecial Pools.\nThere are some pools that, while visible at the water surface, are not used as a fishing resource. These may be used as quest objectives or to summon a boss. These have a slightly different appearance than normal fishing schools. A normal Fishing school will look like a circular outlined darker patch of water. A quest objective pool will look like a speckled surface area.\nAchievements.\nThe following achievements require fishing from Pools:\nAdditionally some element of pool fishing is needed to complete these Achievements:"}

When they were reenabled in &lt;a href=\"Patch%205.1.0\"&gt;Patch 5.1.0&lt;/a&gt; however, the &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Fishing%20Extravaganza\"&gt;Stranglethorn Fishing Extravaganza&lt;/a&gt; had been redesigned to allow three winners, and included the rewards from winning the fishing derby. Thus the Kalu'ak Fishing Derby became redundant, and was removed altogether."}
{"id": "173698", "revid": "40372170", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=173698", "title": "Fishing skill requirements by zone", "text": "Required fishing skill.\nEach zone has an associated level of fishing that defines the difficulty of catching a fish. The higher your fishing skill is in relation to the level that a zone requires, the easier it will be to catch fish. If your skill is below the zone's requirement, you will catch junk items rather than fish. As of &lt;a href=\"Patch%203.1\"&gt;Patch 3.1&lt;/a&gt;, there is no longer a minimum skill level required to fish in a zone, and the former 100% catch rate (no get-aways) level is now the 100% fish (no junk) level.\nThe skill required to guarantee catching fish in a zone is usually about 5 times &lt;a href=\"Regions%20by%20Continent\"&gt;the average level of monsters in the zone&lt;/a&gt;, although some zones vary considerably from this rule of thumb.\nBased upon data collected by &lt;a href=\"El%27s%20Extreme%20Anglin%27\"&gt;El's Extreme Anglin'&lt;/a&gt;, these are the approximate fishing skill levels required: \nSilmyr Lake was raised in to the highest fishing tier in patch 2.4. With the addition of the Wrath of the Lich King expansion, Northrend now has many zones which exceed this tier.\nThe lowest fishing skill, trained as an apprentice with no experience, is 1. Training is required in order to use a fishing pole to fish, so the lowest skill required is 1.\nNote that the highest unaided fishing skill that a character can have is 450. Ensuring a catch in the upper tiers (up to 575) requires &lt;a href=\"Fishing%20equipment\"&gt;gear with bonuses to fishing skill&lt;/a&gt;. The bonuses to fishing skill from equipped items stack.\nFishing skill above the skill required for 100% catch rate is wasted, so you do not always need to equip a &lt;a href=\"Fishing%20lure\"&gt;lure&lt;/a&gt;. For example, fishing in tier 1, the +25 fishing skill &lt;a href=\"Shiny%20Bauble\"&gt;Shiny Bauble&lt;/a&gt; lure would be helpful when you are first starting out, but once you've caught around 30 fish, it would be superfluous to use a lure in the starting area."}

The weaponsmith was skilled in creating magical instruments of war for the &lt;a href=\"Titans\"&gt;Titans&lt;/a&gt;' creations in &lt;a href=\"Uldum\"&gt;Uldum&lt;/a&gt;, believing his hands to be extensions of the titans' will. Despite his great skill, he was prideful and sought to create the ultimate and most unstoppable weapon of all using &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Air\"&gt;Elemental Air&lt;/a&gt;. He bound the four &lt;a href=\"djinn\"&gt;djinn&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Conclave%20of%20Wind\"&gt;Conclave of Wind&lt;/a&gt; into four scimitars of great power, yet he was unsatisfied. Convinced that he could bind &lt;a href=\"Al%27Akir\"&gt;Al'Akir&lt;/a&gt; the Windlord himself in a pair of &lt;a href=\"fist%20weapon\"&gt;fist weapon&lt;/a&gt;s, he used a ritual to steal the elemental lord's power from his home in &lt;a href=\"Skywall\"&gt;Skywall&lt;/a&gt;. Iramaat believed he had done the impossible and named the two fist weapons &lt;a href=\"Al%27burq\"&gt;Al'burq&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alra%27ed\"&gt;Alra'ed&lt;/a&gt;, the Fists of the Heavens.\nBut Al'akir was cunning, and anticipated Iramaat's prideful attempt to steal what he could not control, having learned from the imprisonment of the Conclave. The Windlord indeed gave Iramaat's weapon his power, but filled them with such chaotic energy that when Iramaat attempted to wield them, he and the surrounding city were annihilated in a storm of raw elemental fury. Any other tol'vir who attempted to take up Irmaat's weapons suffered the same fate, and so the Fists of the Heavens were buried away deep within the desert.\nCenturies later, after the great &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, Al'akir fell during the &lt;a href=\"War%20against%20Deathwing\"&gt;War against Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;. His death created a power vacuum that caused a civil war among the remaining air elementals, squabbling over who was strong and clever enough to take his place. One amongst them, &lt;a href=\"Typhinius\"&gt;Typhinius&lt;/a&gt;, sensed Al'akir's lingering essence within the weapons and uncovered them, using to end the civil war by cowing those who respected Al'akir's legacy and overpowering those who did not. While the Fists of the Heavens had calmed somewhat with Al'akir's death, they were still unstable; it took all of Typhinius's efforts to keep their chaotic energies from tearing him apart. Drunk with power, he attempted to launch yet another invasion of Uldum while most of Azeroth's champions were preoccupied with the &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Invasions\"&gt;Legion Invasions&lt;/a&gt;. Wishing to finish what Al'akir started, he led his forces against the &lt;a href=\"Ramkahen%20tribe\"&gt;Ramkahen&lt;/a&gt; tol'vir but was swiftly defeated, the power of the Fists alone proving insufficient to win his war.\nTyphinius retreated to Skywall, where the &lt;a href=\"Monk\"&gt;Monk&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Grandmaster\"&gt;Grandmaster&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Li%20Li%20Stormstout\"&gt;Li Li Stormstout&lt;/a&gt; tracked him down and finally killed the mad djinn. The Grandmaster held the Fists of the Heavens and, using the monks's teachings of balance and harmony of spirit, they were able to wield the Fists as Typhinius and Iramaat could not, using them in battle against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the Legion's defeat, the Grandmaster sacrificed much of the weapons' power to remove the corruption from the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Sword of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;.\nArtifact traits.\nBase.\nHidden trait: &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Burst\"&gt;Lightning Burst&lt;/a&gt;\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

It prevented a character's mana from regenerating 5 seconds after casting a spell. This was an important concern for mana-using classes, especially &lt;a href=\"healer\"&gt;healer&lt;/a&gt;s. Prior to &lt;a href=\"patch%201.4.0\"&gt;patch 1.4.0&lt;/a&gt;, mana regeneration also stopped while casting a spell; hence many in-game references to the five second rule would be use the phrase \"during casting\" instead of \"after casting.\"\nBecause the activation of the five second rule was dependent on mana expenditure, mana regeneration would continue if a character cast a \"free\" spell by the means of &lt;a href=\"clearcasting\"&gt;clearcasting&lt;/a&gt;. The same applied to any spell (i.e. &lt;a href=\"Nature%27s%20Swiftness\"&gt;Nature's Swiftness&lt;/a&gt;) which cost 0 mana.

The person with the highest DKP score who wants the item gets it, and pays a fixed DKP price.\nItem Price.\nOne central problem of this type of loot system are the item prices. Some guilds maintain large item lists with prices on their web site, others use special UI mods which calculate an item value for each object. Both methods can easily become the subject of heated debates. These debates and the disenchanting issue below both have the same reason: The central dictum of a fixed price system is that each item has a well-defined and unchangeable value. The subjective item values though can differ greatly from player to player and over time. There is no possible solution for this conflict inside the system.\nSince a fixed item price is nearly always wrong anyways, the easiest solution is to use just one single price for all items.\nDisenchanting.\nIf all raid members feel that the fixed price is too high for the item, it must be disenchanted. If it's not, but instead offered at a discount or free roll, all the problems (primarily collusion) are introduced back into the system (usually along with heated debate on what's an upgrade or not).\nUnfortunately, disenchanting is no good solution, because the guild as a whole profits if the item is taken by somebody as a minor upgrade. It's also generally bad for player morale to see a \"I might use it for farming/my off-spec/for PvP\" item getting disenchanted under their noses. It's equally unsatisfying to pay full price, particularly for hybrid classes who may have to collect gear for more than one role, or for tanks who have to acquire several sets of resist gear. Enchanting mats are nice to have, but usually are available in large enough quantities from class items which really nobody had any use for."}

I confess: I've been working on a secret project behind your back. Behold: the Stonehide Leather Harness! Now, we simply need to find a mount worthy of such a piece of art.\nThe &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; sing songs of a snow-white &lt;a href=\"Moose\"&gt;elderhorn&lt;/a&gt; with endless stamina. Find it, place the harness on it, and tame it.\nProgress.\nGood luck, &lt;name&gt;.\nCompletion.\nNow that's a beast worth riding. Here's the pattern for that harness, if you want one for yourself.\nNotes.\nThe quest requires the player, while on their mount, to 'lasso' the Great Northern Elderhorn and follow it closely enough to prevent the rope from breaking. It will run wild across most of the zone in an attempt to get away. The path it takes is static. This is very similar to the taming quests from the WoD &lt;a href=\"garrison\"&gt;garrison&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Stables%20%28garrison%29\"&gt;Stables&lt;/a&gt;, but much, much longer.\nThis quest is considered very difficult and usually quite frustrating for someone who does not look up how to do it first, at least a video showing how the moose moves and how to keep within range. There are many false leads that it will perform; once you think you know how it will move in a certain situation, it will then start to act completely contrary to that. It would be extremely unusual, if not impossible, to have to try again only two or three times.\nThere are at least three 'checkpoints' that the moose will pass through. These are not markers to note your progress, but rather \"save points\" for when you invariably screw up. If you reach the first checkpoint at the edge of the waterfall, you will not have to return to the original spot to grab the moose. Just go towards the quest marker on your map, and once you get close enough the moose will phase in for you.\nThere are at least two universal recommendations:\nOne other thing you can do is to have at least a Level 2 &lt;a href=\"The%20Forge\"&gt;Forge&lt;/a&gt; in your garrison for the &lt;a href=\"Song%20of%20the%20Anvil\"&gt;Song of the Anvil&lt;/a&gt; buff, as there are many long drops that must be performed. This is also why you will need Fighter Chow."}

The Cap'n put me in charge of capturing some of 'em.\nWill you help? I've got a stick and some string, and there are loads of wild carrots growing near the camp.

These sure are good horses! I think the Cap'n will be real pleased with our work. \nNotes.\nFor each horse you lure to you, you will need one &lt;a href=\"Wild%20Carrot\"&gt;Wild Carrot&lt;/a&gt;. Wild carrots are found generally to the southwest of the encampment.\nOnce you've gathered your carrots, equip the &lt;a href=\"Stick\"&gt;Stick&lt;/a&gt;. Then, target a horse, and 'use' the (now equipped) stick. The carrot will fly towards the horse, and the horse will come to you. You automatically &lt;a href=\"Vehicles%20%28mechanic%29\"&gt;mount the horse&lt;/a&gt;.\nYou are then able to move the horse back to Squire Percy. At this point, target Percy and use the \"Hand Over Reins\" power. Warning: if you use the 'dismount' button, you will not get credit for turning in the horse.\nThe second ability, 'hoof strike' can reportedly be used to have all nearby horses follow you. If you have a herd follow you, you can much more easily lure and turn in the others that you need."}

{"id": "371798", "revid": "22514", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=371798", "title": "Mounts by source", "text": "Available mounts.\nThe tables below are separated based on mount source, such as purchase requirements, killing specific creatures, participating in world events, completing achievements or more. \nRacial mounts.\nRacial ground mounts are typically the first mounts players will acquire. To purchase a racial ground mount, players must either purchase their race's mount (such as horses for humans, or wolves for orcs), or gain &lt;a href=\"exalted\"&gt;exalted&lt;/a&gt; standing with that race's representative faction (such as exalted with &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; to purchase sabers). Flying mounts do not require any reputation rating.\n&lt;a href=\"Worgen%20%28playable%29\"&gt;Worgen&lt;/a&gt; are not required to purchase their own racial mounts or that of other races, but instead learn &lt;a href=\"Running%20Wild\"&gt;Running Wild&lt;/a&gt; at level 20. Running Wild functions exactly like a mount as far as the game is concerned, but using the player's model (dropping down to all fours in worgen form) instead of a mount. Running Wild confers the standard 60% speed bonus from level 20 to 39, then unlock 100% speed at level 40.\nClass-specific mounts.\nThere are four classes in the game that can acquire special mounts and abilities linked to their own class through lore: &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s. The original quests to gain the paladin charger, warlock dreadsteed, and druid's swift flight form were removed in &lt;a href=\"Patch%204.0.1\"&gt;Patch 4.0.1&lt;/a&gt;; those that completed them were given feats of strength. Instead of going to a class trainer, they are now automatically learned by players of the appropriate level, like any other class ability.\nDruid and paladin abilities are slightly different based on race and faction. For example, the Alliance charger is blue and golden, while the Horde version is red and bronze. Similarly, night elf druids are black in flight form, while tauren are tan. With \"\", &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; paladins receive &lt;a href=\"Sunwalker%20Kodo\"&gt;Sunwalker Kodo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Exarch%27s%20Elekk\"&gt;Exarch's Elekk&lt;/a&gt;, respectively, in place of chargers.\nPvP mounts.\nPvP mounts can be obtained by exchanging &lt;a href=\"Honor%20Points\"&gt;Honor Points&lt;/a&gt; or other world PvP currency. For &lt;a href=\"Arena%20PvP%20system\"&gt;Arena&lt;/a&gt; rewards, see the &lt;a href=\"%23Arena%20System%20reward%20mounts\"&gt;Arena&lt;/a&gt; section.\nQuest reward mounts.\nSome laborious or involved quest chains reward mounts.\nFaction reward mounts.\nAs a reward for gaining high reputation standing with various factions, players can purchase mounts. Such high reputation is a function of large quantities of time.\nNotes:\nRare drop mounts.\nRarely, specific creatures will drop a mount as a reward. If the mount drops, only \"one\" mount will appear per kill, no matter the size of the party or raid killing the creature. Also, mounts may rarely be inside other containers rewarded for doing other objectives.\nGuaranteed drop mounts.\nA guaranteed drop mount will result in \"one\" mount being awarded upon killing the specified creature under the condition listed, regardless of the size of the party or raid. For mounts rewarded such that everyone who completes the achievement gets the mount, see the \"&lt;a href=\"%23Achievement%20system%20mounts\"&gt;Achievements&lt;/a&gt;\" section. There is no direct achievement for killing the &lt;a href=\"Time-Lost%20Proto-Drake\"&gt;Time-Lost Proto-Drake&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Aeonaxx\"&gt;Aeonaxx&lt;/a&gt;; the hard part is actually finding either drake alive. There is likewise no achievement for killing &lt;a href=\"Dormus%20the%20Camel-Hoarder\"&gt;Dormus the Camel-Hoarder&lt;/a&gt;; the hard part is finding a working &lt;a href=\"Mysterious%20Camel%20Figurine\"&gt;Mysterious Camel Figurine&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Uldum\"&gt;Uldum&lt;/a&gt;.\nCrafted mounts.\nMounts can also be created by players. Typically such mounts are a perk of the profession and are not available to other players, but a few are.\nVendor mounts.\n in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; and at the &lt;a href=\"Grummle%20Bazaar\"&gt;Grummle Bazaar&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Kun-Lai%20Summit\"&gt;Kun-Lai Summit&lt;/a&gt; sell mounts to all comers, with no requirements outside of gold or &lt;a href=\"Justice%20Points\"&gt;Justice Points&lt;/a&gt;.\nArgent Tournament mounts.\nA major draw of the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Tournament\"&gt;Argent Tournament&lt;/a&gt; is the large quantity of mounts rewarded in exchange for &lt;a href=\"Champion%27s%20Seal\"&gt;Champion's Seal&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAquatic mounts.\nAquatic mounts confer a slight increase in swim speed, but when designed to be amphibious, move no faster than walking while on land. Aquatic mounts do not give their riders the ability to &lt;a href=\"breath\"&gt;breathe underwater&lt;/a&gt;, so plan accordingly with an appropriate item or abilities.\nAchievement system mounts.\nThese mounts are obtainable by completing certain &lt;a href=\"achievement\"&gt;achievement&lt;/a&gt;s. As part of completing the achievement, the mount will be mailed directly to the player, or for guild achievements, made available for purchase from the guild vendors.\nHoliday mounts.\nThere are several disguises and time-limited items that are available during holidays. Disguises simply turn the player's mount into something \"more festive\" like a kodo or a reindeer but do not otherwise affect mount mechanics. Time-limited items exist only during the duration of the holiday itself. Previously, time-limited items had a set time such as seven or 14 days, but were changed to be directly tied to the holiday.\nBack during &lt;a href=\"Brewfest\"&gt;Brewfest&lt;/a&gt; 2007, an &lt;a href=\"%22Honorary%20Brewer%22%20Hand%20Stamp\"&gt;\"Honorary Brewer\" Hand Stamp&lt;/a&gt; was available for purchase and granted access to the &lt;a href=\"Brewfest%20Ram\"&gt;Brewfest Ram&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Swift%20Brewfest%20Ram\"&gt;Swift Brewfest Ram&lt;/a&gt; vendors. (the holiday boss in the &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Guzzler\"&gt;Grim Guzzler&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Depths\"&gt;Blackrock Depths&lt;/a&gt;) had not yet been implemented, so completing the quest was the only way to get the mounts. The hand stamp was removed for the 2008 Brewfest and the Swift Brewfest Ram added to Coren Direbrew's loot table (along with the new &lt;a href=\"Great%20Brewfest%20Kodo\"&gt;Great Brewfest Kodo&lt;/a&gt;), but the 60%-speed Brewfest Ram can no longer be purchased except by players who completed the Hand Stamp quest.\nOutside of game mounts.\nThe mounts in previous sections are acquired using solely in-game means. The mounts that follow require some real-world interactions, such as getting a rare loot card in the TCG, going to BlizzCon, or purchasing mounts from the Blizzard Store.\nTrading Card Game mounts.\nAll the &lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft%20Trading%20Card%20Game\"&gt;TCG&lt;/a&gt; mounts must first be unlocked using a code found on a &lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft%20Trading%20Card%20Game%23Loot%20cards\"&gt;loot card&lt;/a&gt;, then they can be purchased from in &lt;a href=\"Booty%20Bay\"&gt;Booty Bay&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle.net Shop mounts.\nMounts are also available from &lt;a href=\"Battle.net%20Shop\"&gt;Battle.net Shop&lt;/a&gt;. They function exactly like &lt;a href=\"Pet%20Store\"&gt;Pet Store&lt;/a&gt;-purchased pets do: all characters on the account will get mail from &lt;a href=\"Breanni\"&gt;Breanni&lt;/a&gt; with the mount attached.\nBlizzCon mounts.\nThe first &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon\"&gt;BlizzCon&lt;/a&gt; mount was obtained from the &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon%202008\"&gt;BlizzCon 2008&lt;/a&gt; Welcome packages. Using a code found on the Blizzard Convention Card, the mount is then unlocked by redeeming the code to an NPC found in the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Honor\"&gt;Valley of Honor&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; for Horde, or in the &lt;a href=\"Forlorn%20Cavern\"&gt;Forlorn Cavern&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; for Alliance. Two additional mounts were available by purchasing a ticket or virtual ticket to &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon%202017\"&gt;BlizzCon 2017&lt;/a&gt;.\nRecruit-A-Friend mounts.\nThese mounts are obtainable by recruiting a friend with the &lt;a href=\"Recruit-A-Friend\"&gt;Recruit-A-Friend&lt;/a&gt; program.\nWoW Annual Pass.\nAnnounced at &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon%202011\"&gt;BlizzCon 2011&lt;/a&gt;, players that signed up for the &lt;a href=\"Annual%20Pass\"&gt;World of Warcraft Annual Pass&lt;/a&gt; would receive as one of the additional bonuses a winged horse called &lt;a href=\"Tyrael%27s%20Charger\"&gt;Tyrael's Charger&lt;/a&gt;.\nScroll of Resurrection.\nReintroduced to players on March 6, 2012 for a limited time, the &lt;a href=\"Scroll%20of%20Resurrection\"&gt;Scroll of Resurrection&lt;/a&gt; service, when accepted by an inactive player, will reward the inviting player one &lt;a href=\"Spectral%20Mount%20Crate\"&gt;Spectral Mount Crate&lt;/a&gt; to the character of their choice. The resulting mount is faction-specific.\nNo longer available mounts.\nArena System reward mounts.\nAt the end of each &lt;a href=\"Arena%20PvP%20system\"&gt;Arena season&lt;/a&gt;, the top 0.5% of teams in the 3v3 and 5v5 bracket each battlegroup are rewarded with a 310% speed flying mount.\nSuch mounts are inherently time-limited and are not currently available.\nRemoved from game mounts.\nThese mounts are no longer obtainable in the game."}

Mr. Smite was the first mate under &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Greenskin\"&gt;Captain Greenskin&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe enjoyed playing with his victims, making them believe they could win, while gradually wielding increasingly deadly weapons. The weapons used were &lt;a href=\"Thief%27s%20Blade\"&gt;Thief's Blade&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Smite%27s%20Reaver\"&gt;Smite's Reaver&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Smite%27s%20Mighty%20Hammer\"&gt;Smite's Mighty Hammer&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nIn a vision of the past accessed through &lt;a href=\"Thoralius%20the%20Wise\"&gt;Thoralius&lt;/a&gt;' &lt;a href=\"Incense%20Burner\"&gt;Incense Burner&lt;/a&gt;, Mr. Smite' body can be seen on the ramp leading to the boat.\nMists of Pandaria.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Yorik%20Sharpeye\"&gt;Yorik Sharpeye&lt;/a&gt; has a chance to drop &lt;a href=\"Mr.%20Smite%27s%20Brass%20Compass\"&gt;Mr. Smite's Brass Compass&lt;/a&gt;, which allows players to turn into their favorite first mate. How someone on a lost continent was able to obtain something from a dead member of the Defias Brotherhood is unknown, and it is speculated that Yorik is, in fact, a disguised Mr. Smite. Even their voices are the same and when aggroed he recognizes the player, presumably from the Deadmines. Next to Yorik is a small ship toy, likely a reference to the Deadmines vessel.\nCombat info.\nSmite was accompanied by two rather tough, stealthed bodyguards that should be &lt;a href=\"polymorph\"&gt;polymorph&lt;/a&gt;ed by a &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;, if possible. You generally had to deal with them first while occupying Smite with the tank. Once he was damaged enough, Smite would &lt;a href=\"War%20Stomp\"&gt;War Stomp&lt;/a&gt; your party and run back to a chest for a stronger weapon. The chest could not be opened, and was just background art for Smite to draw his weapons from. The War Stomp would last 7 seconds and would occur twice during the fight, at 66% and 33% health. After the first stomp, Smite switched to dual reavers, and after the second stomp he switched to his hammer. He still took damage from DoTs during the stuns, and it was possible to kill him during them in that manner.\nIt was recommended that the two &lt;a href=\"add\"&gt;add&lt;/a&gt;s be killed before trying to kill Smite, while main tank was focusing on Smite, otherwise they would keep beating on your party while your party was &lt;a href=\"stun\"&gt;stun&lt;/a&gt;ned by his stomp.\nIf you didn't want to be left helpless due to Smite's stomp, it was possible to stun him before 66% and 33% and bring his life down far enough to escape the stomp.\nOne handy trick against this boss was to have the fastest party member pull Smite back to the end of the dock, then have the main tank keep him busy while the rest of the group burned off his guards. When he used his stomp ability, he would have to run all the way back to the chest to retrieve his next weapon. If his guards were down, this would give the group time to heal up before he returned. If you had enough DoTs stacked on him during this time, it was possible for him to die during the trip, or he could even perform another warstomp on the return trip, refreshing the stun on the group as he ran back to grab his hammer.\nIn Hearthstone.\nMr. Smite appears as in the expansion of \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\". The flavor text reads: \"Please, Mr. Smite was my father. Call me Yorik.\"\nSpeculation.\nDue to his dark coloring and personality, it has been suggested that he may have been a &lt;a href=\"Grimtotem\"&gt;Grimtotem&lt;/a&gt; like &lt;a href=\"First%20Mate%20Hapana\"&gt;Hapana&lt;/a&gt;, another Grimtotem who turned to piracy."}

Yet when the curse fell over &lt;a href=\"Duskwood\"&gt;Duskwood&lt;/a&gt; and turned the once peaceful woodland into a realm of terror, the spiders began to mutate and grow to monstrous proportions. Now, the lurking venom spiders hunt their hapless prey in all of the shadowed corners of the land.

{"id": "652794", "revid": "44899549", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=652794", "title": "Venthyr", "text": "The venthyr of &lt;a href=\"Revendreth\"&gt;Revendreth&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;a href=\"vampire\"&gt;vampiric&lt;/a&gt; punishers of the unworthy, charged with rehabilitating the sinful &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;s sent to them by the &lt;a href=\"Arbiter\"&gt;Arbiter&lt;/a&gt;. Souls who are successfully rehabilitated can then choose to be sent to another realm to serve for eternity, or become a venthyr themselves and continue the cycle as an instrument of repentance.\nThe venthyr were created by &lt;a href=\"Sire%20Denathrius\"&gt;Sire Denathrius&lt;/a&gt; in his own likeness. The first of them, &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Renathal\"&gt;Prince Renathal&lt;/a&gt;, and other members of the original &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Harvesters\"&gt;Court of Harvesters&lt;/a&gt; such as the &lt;a href=\"The%20Curator%20%28venthyr%29\"&gt;Curator&lt;/a&gt; and the first &lt;a href=\"Original%20Harvester%20of%20Wrath\"&gt;Harvester of Wrath&lt;/a&gt; were willed into being by Denathrius. Later venthyr\u2014the first of which was &lt;a href=\"the%20Stonewright\"&gt;the Stonewright&lt;/a&gt;\u2014were (and are) created from redeemed souls who are given a new name and taught the ways of Revendreth by a venthyr, who endorse and sire them in turn. Their original names are still very important to them, for they could potentially let someone find their &lt;a href=\"sinstone\"&gt;sinstone&lt;/a&gt;s and compel the venthyr to their will. A venthyr is unable to act directly against someone with their sinstone.\nVenthyr find exposure to the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; extremely painful. If a venthyr is exposed to the Light for too long, they're driven mad and eventually becomes an &lt;a href=\"ash%20ghoul\"&gt;ash ghoul&lt;/a&gt;. The only preventative remedy after too much exposure is to quickly find a dark spot and to consume the &lt;a href=\"anima\"&gt;anima&lt;/a&gt; that venthyr extract, referred to as liquid shadows. It is noted to taste bad to the &lt;a href=\"dredger\"&gt;dredger&lt;/a&gt;s. The Light is not normally lethal to venthyr, but if focused through mirrors, depending on the amount of concentrated Light a venthyr can be trapped in one spot, torturously unable to move, all the way up to instantly bursting into a cloud of ash.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Venthyr%20Covenant\"&gt;Venthyr Covenant&lt;/a&gt; is one of the four &lt;a href=\"covenant\"&gt;covenant&lt;/a&gt;s ruling over the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\n\"The venthyr have a good thing going. They lord over Revendreth's castles and ceaseless twilight while arrogant souls are delivered to their tables. The harvesters' otherworldly punishments strip the pride from their thralls, sparing them an even worse fate: eternal torment in the Maw.\"\n\"But souls thus drained can't just leave Revendreth for a better place. They have years of penance to slog through while they reflect on the precarity of their afterlives. And, after eons of service, the venthyr are increasingly ruled by their decadence and pride. The very purpose of the plane may be flawed\u2026 and those who were once accusers have become gluttonous and corrupt.\"\n\"Revendreth must always have a master, and rumor suggests that Denathrius, foremost among the venthyr, may no longer be fit for the role. Crowning a new Sire could return the plane to its former glory\u2026 or leave Revendreth mired in the same decadence and sin it is charged with cleansing.\"\n\"The venthyr are aristocratic overseers of souls burdened with excessive pride and wickedness. They guide troubled souls upon the rigorous path to atonement, harvesting anima to keep their realm strong.\""}

Your search brought you to a mysterious prisoner known as the &lt;a href=\"Runecarver\"&gt;Runecarver&lt;/a&gt;.\nYou recovered one of the Runecarver's memories from the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt;, then worked with &lt;a href=\"Ve%27nari\"&gt;Ve'nari&lt;/a&gt; to free one of his bonds. In exchange, the Runecarver has offered to help you craft powerful armor.\nThe Court.\n&lt;a href=\"Prince%20Renathal\"&gt;Prince Renathal&lt;/a&gt; has a plan to seize control of &lt;a href=\"Revendreth\"&gt;Revendreth&lt;/a&gt;, whether Sire &lt;a href=\"Denathrius\"&gt;Denathrius&lt;/a&gt; still rules or not. To do so, he has employed your help to convene a meeting of the &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Harvesters\"&gt;Court of Harvesters&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Darkwall%20Tower\"&gt;Darkwall Tower&lt;/a&gt;.\nUsing various contacts and infiltration techniques, you were able to extend an invitation to the three Harvesters who might be willing to talk. With the Prince, &lt;a href=\"the%20Accuser\"&gt;the Accuser&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"The%20Curator%20%28venthyr%29\"&gt;the Curator&lt;/a&gt; already on your side, the Court is able to convene with six of its seven members.\nThe Court convened, and the Prince laid out his plan--to combine the Harvester's medallions in order to sieze control of Revendreth. But the &lt;a href=\"venthyr\"&gt;venthyr&lt;/a&gt; were not swayed by Prince Renathal's words, and were unwilling to give up their medallions. Renathal had lost too many times for them to trust him.\nPride.\nWith the help of other &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;ian allies you were able to recover the &lt;a href=\"%3AMedallion%20of%20Pride\"&gt;:Medallion of Pride&lt;/a&gt; from the clutches of the vile &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Chamberlain\"&gt;Lord Chamberlain&lt;/a&gt;. While the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Atonement\"&gt;Halls of Atonement&lt;/a&gt; are still under the rule of those loyal to &lt;a href=\"Denathrius\"&gt;Denathrius&lt;/a&gt;, the power within is greatly weakened.\nDesire.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Countess\"&gt;The Countess&lt;/a&gt; holds the &lt;a href=\"%3AMedallion%20of%20Desire\"&gt;:Medallion of Desire&lt;/a&gt; and rules over the &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Ward\"&gt;Castle Ward&lt;/a&gt; and its nobles. &lt;a href=\"Theotar\"&gt;Theotar&lt;/a&gt;, the Mad Duke, has a plan that may be able to wrest the medallion from the Countess without incurring an open enemy.\nTheotar dispatched you to the Old Gate to find his old butler and house staff. The plan is to find Theotar's old estate where a secret entrance to the Countess's private chambers lays in wait. From there, you can steal the Medallion.\nUpon securing Theotar's previous estate you were able to use the mirror there to enter the chambers of the Countess. However she was waiting for you... with her guards.\nYou were not invited, but you were also not unexpected. The Countess proposed an alternative to stealing her medallion. If you helped her with her plan to undermine her opposition, she would gladly hand the medallion over.\nTo that end, the Countess sent you into the noble district of Redelav where you gathered poisonous mushrooms, invited the elite to a party, and murdered &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Andrei\"&gt;Lord Andrei&lt;/a&gt;, one of her political rivals.\nWhile attending a party thrown by the Countess you had the chance to question the various guests. You discovered which house was in league with Lord Andrei in his plot to try and eliminate the Countess.\nAfter accusing the House of conspiracy against the Countess, you dispatched their leader swiftly and publicly. Pleased with your actions the Countess provided her medallion, having proven her power comes from... other skills.\nCompleting this chapter of the campaign also unlocks the &lt;a href=\"Kindred%20Spirits%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Kindred Spirits&lt;/a&gt; quest from Theotar that unlocks him as a soulbind.\nAvarice.\nThe &lt;a href=\"%3AMedallion%20of%20Avarice\"&gt;:Medallion of Avarice&lt;/a&gt; was hidden by its Harvester, &lt;a href=\"The%20Curator%20%28venthyr%29\"&gt;the Curator&lt;/a&gt;, before she was exiled to the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt;. Now that she is back, her mind is not stable enough to retrieve the hidden medallion on her own. She requires your help in the &lt;a href=\"Catacombs%20Ward\"&gt;Catacombs Ward&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Curator hid her medallion on the other side of a very special mirror. Before her capture she broke the mirror and entrusted the two halves to her underlings.\nAfter some searching you were able to rescue &lt;a href=\"Watcher%20Emil\"&gt;Watcher Emil&lt;/a&gt;, the Curator's most trusted aid, along with his half of the mirror.\nThe second half of the mirror was in the hands of the traitorous &lt;a href=\"Sinkeeper%20Mateo\"&gt;Sinkeeper Mateo&lt;/a&gt;, the Curator's old protege who had more ambition than sense. Storming the Curator's old mansion of &lt;a href=\"Archivam\"&gt;Archivam&lt;/a&gt;, you weree able to retrieve the other half of the mirror.\nWith the mirror repaired, you were able to venture into the secret crypt and recover the Medallion of Avarice from its hiding place.\nThe Crowned Prince.\n&lt;a href=\"Prince%20Renathal\"&gt;Prince Renathal&lt;/a&gt;'s plan to harness the power of the medallions requires a conduit to channel the power. &lt;a href=\"Revendreth\"&gt;Revendreth&lt;/a&gt; lacks the craftsmen to create such an artifact.\nTo commission the construction of the artifact, Prince Renathal is dispatching you to &lt;a href=\"Bastion\"&gt;Bastion&lt;/a&gt;. The plan is to restore an ancient mirror there. Though once used by the forces of Revendreth for nefarious purposes, it will now allow passage for &lt;a href=\"General%20Draven\"&gt;General Draven&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Theotar\"&gt;Theotar&lt;/a&gt; to join you.\nAfter a tense parley with the denizens of Bastions, General Draven was able to request the aid of &lt;a href=\"Mikanikos\"&gt;Mikanikos&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Kyrian%23Collectors\"&gt;Forgelite Prime&lt;/a&gt;. Draven offered to make amends, and repairs, for past sabotages performed by Revendreth.\nWith your help, Theotar and Draven were able to undo the damage inflicted upon the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Forge\"&gt;forges&lt;/a&gt; of Bastion and drive out the &lt;a href=\"Forsworn\"&gt;Forsworn&lt;/a&gt; occupying the area long enough to forge the artifact.\nAnd in the fires of battle, the &lt;a href=\"%3ACrown%20of%20the%20Harvesters\"&gt;:Crown of the Harvesters&lt;/a&gt; was forged.\nThe unbridled power of the crown proved too potent for a mere mortal to wield, and too flooded with the echoes of &lt;a href=\"Denathrius\"&gt;Denathrius&lt;/a&gt;. It required purification at the &lt;a href=\"Citadel%20of%20Loyalty\"&gt;Temple of Loyalty&lt;/a&gt;, fighting your way through legions of Forwsworn Kyrian.\nCleansed of the Master's will, you were able to bring the new crown to Prince Renathal.\nConfronting Sin.\nDuring a raid on &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Nathria\"&gt;Castle Nathria&lt;/a&gt;, a corrupted and powerful soul was liberated from the &lt;a href=\"Denathrius\"&gt;Master&lt;/a&gt;'s dark experiments. &lt;a href=\"The%20Accuser\"&gt;The Accuser&lt;/a&gt; has asked for your help in bringing this &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;, once a prince and &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; of great power, to atonement.\nTogether, you and the Accuser werea ble to untwine Kael'thas Sunstrider's soul from the corrupted anima he was infused with by the Master.\nWhile helping Kael'thas atone for his past deeds the two of you uncovered a conspiracy within the &lt;a href=\"Chalice%20District\"&gt;Chalice District&lt;/a&gt; of Revendreth. &lt;a href=\"Venthyr\"&gt;Venthyr&lt;/a&gt; who had openly opposed &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Renathal\"&gt;Prince Renathal&lt;/a&gt; were being outfitted with &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxi\"&gt;Maldraxxi&lt;/a&gt; weapons and working with a mysterious &lt;a href=\"Lich\"&gt;Lich&lt;/a&gt;.\nKael'thas was convinced that the way to learn more of the conspiracy was to spy on &lt;a href=\"the%20Tithelord\"&gt;the Tithelord&lt;/a&gt;, Harvester of Envy and current caretaker of the &lt;a href=\"Village%20Ward\"&gt;Village Ward&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the Tithelord, you and Kael'thas discovered an encampment of &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxus\"&gt;Maldraxxus&lt;/a&gt; forces embedded within the Village Ward, working directly with the Tithelord. After defeating the lich in charge, you reported your findings to Prince Renathal.\nEnvy.\nWith the discovery of &lt;a href=\"the%20Tithelord\"&gt;the Tithelord&lt;/a&gt;'s ties to &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxus\"&gt;Maldraxxus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Renathal\"&gt;Prince Renathal&lt;/a&gt; has requested the presence of the Baronness &lt;a href=\"Draka\"&gt;Draka&lt;/a&gt; to assist in the apprehension of the &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxi\"&gt;Maldraxxi&lt;/a&gt; forces. The time had come for the Harvester of Envy to lose his medallion.\nWith Renathal and Draka by your side you took the fight to the &lt;a href=\"Village%20Ward\"&gt;Village Ward&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Stonevigil%20Overlook\"&gt;There&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"venthyr\"&gt;venthyr&lt;/a&gt; languishing under the yoke of the Tithelord's demands were liberated and convinced to join forces with &lt;a href=\"Sinfall\"&gt;Sinfall&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith the Tithelord's supply lines halted, his people in revolt against him, and his best &lt;a href=\"stoneborn\"&gt;stoneborn&lt;/a&gt; crushed, the time had come to take the fight to the harvester's &lt;a href=\"Caretaker%27s%20Manor\"&gt;home&lt;/a&gt;.\nUsing the Tithelord's own anima against him, you were able to defeat the Harvester of Envy and claim his medallion for Sinfall. However, in the battle, you discovered his contact in &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxus\"&gt;Maldraxxus&lt;/a&gt; was none other than the Arch-Lich &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; who now wields the &lt;a href=\"%3AMedallion%20of%20Dominion\"&gt;:Medallion of Dominion&lt;/a&gt;.\nDominion.\nCompleting this chapter of the campaign also unlocks the &lt;a href=\"A%20Stalwart%20Ally\"&gt;A Stalwart Ally&lt;/a&gt; quest from General Draven that unlocks him as a soulbind.\nWrath.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Harvesters\"&gt;Court of Harvesters&lt;/a&gt; used the combined powers of all seven medallions to secure &lt;a href=\"Revendreth\"&gt;Revendreth&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Denathrius\"&gt;Denathrius&lt;/a&gt; forever. In doing so, a new sigil was created."}

{"id": "652876", "revid": "22514", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=652876", "title": "Venthyr Covenant", "text": "The cunning venthyr of &lt;a href=\"Revendreth\"&gt;Revendreth&lt;/a&gt; are one of the &lt;a href=\"Covenant\"&gt;Covenant&lt;/a&gt;s in the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;. They feast on the souls of the prideful and vain in a gothic realm of opulence and torment. Joining this covenant means accepting the gift of the &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Harvesters\"&gt;Court of Harvesters&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis is where flawed souls are sent who haven't been able to leave something behind, whether it's pride or some other failing. Souls sent here are not quite ready for service in one of the Shadowlands' other domains, and it is the duty of the vampiric &lt;a href=\"Venthyr\"&gt;Venthyr&lt;/a&gt; to prepare them\u2014through unimaginable torment. It is much like a purgatory for souls who need to atone for past misdeeds and shed the burdens of their life. The journey is not an easy one, however. The former sin'dorei prince &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; is one such soul who has found himself in Revendreth for his deeds in life.\nDescription.\n\"Eaters of sin who harvest anima from wicked souls.\"\n\"The venthyr have a good thing going. They lord over Revendreth\u2019s castles and ceaseless twilight while arrogant souls are delivered to their tables. The harvesters\u2019 otherworldly punishments strip the pride from their thralls, sparing them an even worse fate: eternal torment in the Maw.\"\n\"But souls thus drained can\u2019t just leave Revendreth for a better place. They have years of penance to slog through while they reflect on the precarity of their afterlives. And, after eons of service, the venthyr are increasingly ruled by their decadence and pride. The very purpose of the plane may be flawed\u2026 and those who were once accusers have become gluttonous and corrupt.\"\n\"Revendreth must always have a master, and rumor suggests that Denathrius, foremost among the venthyr, may no longer be fit for the role. Crowning a new Sire could return the plane to its former glory\u2026 or leave Revendreth mired in the same decadence and sin it is charged with cleansing.\"\n\"The venthyr are aristocratic overseers of souls burdened with excessive pride and wickedness. They guide troubled souls upon the rigorous path to atonement, harvesting anima to keep their realm strong.\"\nCovenant's abilities.\nIf you choose to join the Venthyr Covenant, you'll gain two abilities tailored to the theme of the Covenant. The first of these is the Covenant's signature ability, which is available to all Covenant members regardless of class, race, or specialization. The second of these abilities is specific to your class, and gives you a new spell or power to use in combat.\nSanctum Upgrades.\nAll Sanctum Upgrades are done through &lt;a href=\"Foreman%20Flatfinger\"&gt;Foreman Flatfinger&lt;/a&gt; in the Sinfall Reaches floor of &lt;a href=\"Sinfall\"&gt;Sinfall&lt;/a&gt;.\nTransportation Network.\n\"A transportation network that offers you more fast travel options across your covenant's home zone. Once active, you will have access to additional upgrades.\"\n\"Reactivate the mysterious network of mirrors that connect across Revendreth. Continue to restore the network to earn the ability to repair broken mirrors across Revendreth that can be used to access secret locations and unique rewards.\"\nThe Transportation Network for Revendreth is called the Mirror Network, made up of Blood Mirrors, also called translocation mirrors, and is unlocked through the questline starting with &lt;a href=\"A%20Master%20of%20Their%20Craft\"&gt;A Master of Their Craft&lt;/a&gt;. \nAdditional Blood Mirror pairs are:\nBroken Mirrors.\nAfter completing Rank 3 and the mirror quests, you are given &lt;a href=\"Repair%20and%20Restore\"&gt;Repair and Restore&lt;/a&gt;, which unlocks &lt;a href=\"Handcrafted%20Mirror%20Repair%20Kit\"&gt;Handcrafted Mirror Repair Kit&lt;/a&gt;s for 10 &lt;a href=\"Infused%20Ruby\"&gt;Infused Ruby&lt;/a&gt;, allowing to fix one time use &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Mirror\"&gt;Broken Mirror&lt;/a&gt;s in Revendreth, which lead to &lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20Chest%20%28Revendreth%29\"&gt;Forgotten Chests&lt;/a&gt; containing items such as &lt;a href=\"Silessa%27s%20Battle%20Harness\"&gt;Silessa's Battle Harness&lt;/a&gt;. Sometimes entering a mirror transports you to the &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary%20of%20the%20Mad\"&gt;Sanctuary of the Mad&lt;/a&gt; by mistake; when this occurs, simply walk back to the mirror's location and it will still be active and walking through it will take you to the correct room.\nThe locations of these mirrors change daily. Additionally, the mirrors have thus far been server-region wide (as in, US Oceanic or US Eastern, not \"US\", see: &lt;a href=\"realm%20list\"&gt;realm list&lt;/a&gt;), and come within the same group.\nAn easy way to check which group is active each week is to go to one mirror per group. The Halls of Atonement Sinfall mirror to check Group 1 and 3, the Dominance Keep Sinfall mirror to check Group 2 and 4. \nAnima Conductor.\n\"An ancient device that allows you to spend &lt;a href=\"Anima\"&gt;Anima&lt;/a&gt; in order to activate bonus content in different areas of your covenant's home zone. Once active, you will have access to additional upgrades.\"\n\"Restore anima to this powerful and ancient device. Once operational, it allows you to siphon anima to different parts of Revendreth in order to activate new challenges and adventures.\"\nThe Anima Conductor for the venthyr is located in the Sinfall Depths (bottom) floor of &lt;a href=\"Sinfall\"&gt;Sinfall&lt;/a&gt;, next to &lt;a href=\"Devahia\"&gt;Devahia&lt;/a&gt;. Once a location is unlocked, every day anima can be diverted to grant the benefit of the location for 25 &lt;a href=\"Reservoir%20Anima\"&gt;Reservoir Anima&lt;/a&gt;. You can channel anima once per daily reset, but the benefit stays active for a full 24-hour timer. Every 10 channels you can reinforce a location to gain that benefit permanently. Given there are 6 possible locations, it will take a minimum of 60 days and 1500 &lt;a href=\"Reservoir%20Anima\"&gt;Reservoir Anima&lt;/a&gt; to permanently reinforce all locations once unlocked.\nWhen you click on the &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Greedstone\"&gt;Greater Greedstone&lt;/a&gt; in the Crypt of the Forgotten, a path of sinstones will appear right next to the object leading to a &lt;a href=\"Greed%27s%20Reward\"&gt;Greed's Reward&lt;/a&gt; chest. Sometimes &lt;a href=\"Greedstone\"&gt;Greedstone&lt;/a&gt; appears in the &lt;a href=\"Endmire\"&gt;Endmire&lt;/a&gt; inside a tower that also creates a path of sinstones leading to another &lt;a href=\"Greed%27s%20Reward\"&gt;Greed's Reward&lt;/a&gt; chest. Given the Greedstones create both paths for one minute, in theory one could loot both within the same minute. Activating the Greater Greedstone can also trigger a &lt;a href=\"Bleakwood%20Chest\"&gt;Bleakwood Chest&lt;/a&gt; to appear somewhere in the zone, visible in the minimap. Looting the Greedstone will sometimes cause you to get a cursed item, giving you &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Renagal%27s%20Pact\"&gt;Curse of Renagal's Pact&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Teramanik%27s%20Legacy\"&gt;Curse of Teramanik's Legacy&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Demoltrov%27s%20Rites\"&gt;Curse of Demoltrov's Rites&lt;/a&gt;. These curses can be removed at the &lt;a href=\"Absolution%20Crypt\"&gt;Absolution Crypt&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Cursebreaker%20Arnon\"&gt;Cursebreaker Arnon&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo be able to fight Wanecrypt Hill's &lt;a href=\"Harika%20the%20Horrid\"&gt;Harika the Horrid&lt;/a&gt;, you must obtain 1 &lt;a href=\"Dredhollow%20Bolt\"&gt;Dredhollow Bolt&lt;/a&gt; (found in the same spots in Dredhollow every day) and bring it to &lt;a href=\"Wingsmash\"&gt;Wingsmash&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Court of Harvesters world quest is &lt;a href=\"Darkwing%20Drills\"&gt;Darkwing Drills&lt;/a&gt;, where the more you do the quest, the more abilities your two &lt;a href=\"Darkwing%20%28stoneborn%29\"&gt;Darkwing&lt;/a&gt; trainees gain.\nThe possible daily quests with varying rewards for Pridefall Hamlet are,:\nThe Venthyr enhancements of the Shrouded Asylum granted by NPCs near a statue of Denathrius are:\nDominance Keep's &lt;a href=\"Forgemaster%20Madalav\"&gt;Forgemaster Madalav&lt;/a&gt; is summoned by clicking on &lt;a href=\"Madalav%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Madalav's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;.\nCommand Table.\n\"Recruit heroes and troops to send them out on a series of adventures across the Shadowlands Once active, you will have access to additional upgrades.\"\n\"Restore pride in Revendreth among our forces as we continue to fight for all Venthyr.

In the &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, they conducted lumber and mining operations, leaving every cliff barren in their wake.

In the &lt;a href=\"Sholazar%20Basin\"&gt;Sholazar Basin&lt;/a&gt;, they also set up a strip mine, known as &lt;a href=\"Swindlegrin%27s%20Dig\"&gt;Swindlegrin's Dig&lt;/a&gt;, around the &lt;a href=\"Suntouched%20Pillar\"&gt;Suntouched Pillar&lt;/a&gt;, trying to remove all its crystals.\nCataclysm.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, Venture Co. has lost control of the wells in &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Grimtotem%20tribe\"&gt;Grimtotem tribe&lt;/a&gt; but is still in control of the &lt;a href=\"Venture%20Co.%20Mine\"&gt;Venture Co.

It is not known how they got there, but it is likely they entered Draenor during the brief time when the &lt;a href=\"Ironmarch\"&gt;Ironmarch&lt;/a&gt; force took control of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt;.

Despite their victory &lt;a href=\"Toki\"&gt;Toki&lt;/a&gt; remarked that the Venture Company was a resilient foe and was sure that they would meet again. They can show up on &lt;a href=\"island%20expedition\"&gt;island expedition&lt;/a&gt;s looking for Azerite.\nThe company made a deal with the &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Cartel\"&gt;Bilgewater Cartel&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; to refine &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt; for the Horde's war with the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, but Venture's leader &lt;a href=\"Mogul%20Razdunk\"&gt;Mogul Razdunk&lt;/a&gt; backed out of the deal and Bilgewater's &lt;a href=\"Trade%20Prince\"&gt;Trade Prince&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jastor%20Gallywix\"&gt;Jastor Gallywix&lt;/a&gt; sought revenge to get what they were owed. The Company also attacked &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Depths\"&gt;Blackrock Depths&lt;/a&gt; and stole &lt;a href=\"Ironfoe\"&gt;Ironfoe&lt;/a&gt;, earning the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt;' and Alliance's ire. On &lt;a href=\"Kezan\"&gt;Kezan&lt;/a&gt;, Razdunk started great dig sites in search of Azerite. Having never been able to ascend to Trade Prince, Razdunk was certain that becoming the world's foremost Azerite baron would bring him fame and fortune beyond his station. However, his actions in betraying the Horde and stealing from the Alliance caused adventurers to turn their ire upon him and they ventured to the &lt;a href=\"MOTHERLODE%21%21\"&gt;MOTHERLODE!!&lt;/a&gt; to put an end to the leader of the Venture Company, successfully killing Razdunk.\nThe Venture Company later traveled to &lt;a href=\"Tanaris\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt; to scavenge materials for their own use, however, the company came into conflict with the Horde and Alliance who sought to repair &lt;a href=\"Feathers\"&gt;Feathers&lt;/a&gt; by using the machinery the Venture Company had acquired.\nThey had a presence in &lt;a href=\"Vol%27dun\"&gt;Vol'dun&lt;/a&gt; and killed the goblin &lt;a href=\"Dataguru%20Gryzix\"&gt;Dataguru Gryzix&lt;/a&gt;.\nA group of &lt;a href=\"thief\"&gt;thieves&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Verd%20Twiceswindle%E2%80%8E\"&gt;Verd Twiceswindle\u200e&lt;/a&gt; stole &lt;a href=\"Rare%20Hides\"&gt;leather&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Sheza%20Wildmane\"&gt;Sheza Wildmane&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt; and camped in a hut in eastern Mulgore.\nSoon after &lt;a href=\"Mechagon%20Island\"&gt;Mechagon Island&lt;/a&gt; was discovered by the Horde and Alliance, the Venture Company would arrive in order to exploit the land for every ounce of profit they could make. In return, &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s were tasked with driving them off the island.\nExploring Azeroth.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Zekhan\"&gt;Zekhan&lt;/a&gt;'s report after the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the tauren in Mulgore were still facing the Venture Company mining operations. The Darkspear ambassador also mentioned that there were still goblins running the company, and they must have similar dreams as &lt;a href=\"Mogul%20Razdunk\"&gt;Mogul Razdunk&lt;/a&gt; had.\nThe Venture Company's mining and clear-cutting operations in the &lt;a href=\"Grizzly%20Hills\"&gt;Grizzly Hills&lt;/a&gt; have resumed by the time of &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;'s expedition following the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;war against the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;. The company once again had full control over &lt;a href=\"Venture%20Bay\"&gt;Venture Bay&lt;/a&gt; as the conflict over the region ceased. In &lt;a href=\"Sholazar%20Basin\"&gt;Sholazar Basin&lt;/a&gt;, they also reported that the Venture Company still continued their operations at the &lt;a href=\"Suntouched%20Pillar\"&gt;Suntouched Pillar&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni&lt;/a&gt; feared that eventually they would do as much harm as the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Cult of the Damned&lt;/a&gt; to the region, however unintentionally.\nDragonflight.\nAfter the discovery of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;, the Venture Co. higher-ups sent &lt;a href=\"Grimla%20Fizzlecrank\"&gt;Grimla Fizzlecrank&lt;/a&gt; to see what the company's prospects could be on the islands, but upon seeing the beautiful landscape Grimla decided \"not this time\".\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;, the Venture Company continued to maintain the oil rigs at &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Shore\"&gt;Crystal Shore&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Cape%20of%20Stranglethorn\"&gt;Cape of Stranglethorn&lt;/a&gt;, routinely under the inspection of &lt;a href=\"Prospector%20Arty\"&gt;Prospector Arty&lt;/a&gt;.\nMembers.\nUnnamed.\nThese members of the Venture Co. are found in the northeast part of the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Sludge%20Fen\"&gt;Sludge Fen&lt;/a&gt;:\nIn the RPG.\nBackground.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Trade%20Coalition\"&gt;Trade Coalition&lt;/a&gt; is huge, far-reaching and massively complicated. In addition, numerous other, smaller goblin companies, created and run by entrepreneurs called &lt;a href=\"mogul\"&gt;mogul&lt;/a&gt;s (the hands of the &lt;a href=\"trade%20prince\"&gt;trade prince&lt;/a&gt;s) operate throughout Azeroth. Perhaps the most famous of these smaller businesses is the Venture Company, founded and ruled by &lt;a href=\"Mogul%20Razdunk\"&gt;Mogul Razdunk&lt;/a&gt;. The corporate group is a collection of greedy entrepreneurs who keep both eyes on the bottom line at all times. &lt;a href=\"Mogul%20Razdunk\"&gt;Mogul Razdunk&lt;/a&gt; owns and runs the Venture Company.\nThe headquarters of the Venture Company is located in &lt;a href=\"Undermine\"&gt;Undermine&lt;/a&gt;. Ratchet also serves as a base of operations for many members of the company. Though the city is governed from Undermine by the trade princes, Ratchet is (or was) run by members of the Venture Company. The Venture Company is in competition with &lt;a href=\"Gazlowe\"&gt;Gazlowe&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Steamwheedle%20Cartel\"&gt;Steamwheedle Cartel&lt;/a&gt; who is the ruler and Overseer of the city. While the city operates under the watchful eyes of the trade princes, Gazlowe has considerable free rein. The Venture Company employs a complex device known as a &lt;a href=\"Truth%20detector\"&gt;Truth detector&lt;/a&gt; in the City of Ratchet when they were making an important deal with a new supplier and wanted to ascertain whether or not the supplier is trustworthy.\nThe Venture Company is known for spearheading the efforts to reestablish trade routes across eastern &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, to connect isolated goblin trading posts. A growing number of shops in Azeroth have signs declaring that they are owned and operated by the \"Venture Company,\" which the proprietors claim is headquartered in a faraway city ruled by goblins. The Venture Company sometimes hires heroes to build new trading posts in the wilderness \u2014 a job that could take them anywhere in the world. The Venture Company is infamous for its massive numbers of goblin shredders.\nThe trade princes have recently caused problems for the Venture Company, and it is looking increasingly likely that the goblins will turn on each other soon. &lt;a href=\"Ziz%20Fizziks\"&gt;Ziz Fizziks&lt;/a&gt;, a goblin who works with the trade princes, works to retrieve plans that a disloyal goblin stole and sold to the Venture Company.\nProjects in Central Kalimdor.\nThe goblins of the Venture Company threaten to reduce the entire &lt;a href=\"Central%20Kalimdor\"&gt;Central Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; section into an uninhabitable wasteland.\nMulgore is rich with iron and tin, which has attracted the attention of the Venture Company. With the centaur gone, the Venture Company has taken advantage of the tauren's peaceful nature and have set up mining operations throughout the region. The Venture Company's presence here is for profit, plain and simple. Driven by profit, the Venture Company mines for the iron and tin in eastern Mulgore, depleting the land's natural resources, and hoarding the region's water supplies. They are disturbing the balance of nature in the region, and drawing the anger of the tauren. Although the tauren have tried to share their land, the continuous encroachment and lack of respect shown by the Venture Company has resulted in escalating conflict in the region. The Venture Company buys poached hides from Palemane gnolls near Palemane Rock. The goblins intended to capitalize on the peaceful nature of the tauren and steal the resources of their home, and that plan has begun to fall apart only recently. It is believed if the goblins are pressed hard enough, they will eventually get the picture and withdraw. Baine Bloodhoof, the son of Cairne, leads an investigation into Venture Company operations to the east of the village.\nAgents of the goblin-run Venture Company have also been sighted in the Stonetalon Peak area, searching for potential tracts to deforest and streams of precious ore to plunder with their mining machines. They have a significant presence in the Stonetalon Mountains, chopping down trees and burning huge stretches of forest in the &lt;a href=\"Windshear%20Crag\"&gt;Windshear Crag&lt;/a&gt; basin. The goblins of Stonetalon are among the finest engineers of their race, and their inventions have allowed them to remove massive chunks of the forest in a few short months. The Venture Company is gradually destroying the remaining trees and taking the remaining resources from the earth There has been a near-complete annihilation of sections of the Stonetalon Mountains (the &lt;a href=\"Charred%20Vale\"&gt;Charred Vale&lt;/a&gt; in particular) with lumber-cutting machine by the Venture Company. The Venture Company's expeditions and mining operations changed much of the landscape to dusty, barren canyons and desolate cliffs. If this process continues, Stonetalon could soon become as much a wasteland as &lt;a href=\"Desolace\"&gt;Desolace&lt;/a&gt; in the south or the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt; in the east. This endeavor draws ire from the night elves and tauren alike, who find the deforestation barbaric and dangerous. Many of the tauren still hold the unrealistic hope that the Venture Company can be reasoned with, and this belief prevents progress. While the majority of the night elves and tauren take defensive roles, the Grimtotem tribe strikes back against the goblins.\nThe Venture Company has an operation in the &lt;a href=\"Sludge%20Fen\"&gt;Sludge Fen&lt;/a&gt;, in the Barrens' northern hills. They also can be seen in Boulder Lode Mine, close to the shores of the Southfury River (and the oft-overlooked western entrance to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;).\nRelationship to Steamwheedle Cartel.\nMembers of the Venture Company are said to \"run Ratchet\", and that one of their major operations is in the city. It is also said that the trade princes govern the city, and allow &lt;a href=\"Gazlowe\"&gt;Gazlowe&lt;/a&gt; free reign to rule under their watchful eye. Thus Gazlowe is affiliated with the Steamwheedle Cartel, and the trade princes. It is also said that the trade princes have recently caused problems for the Venture Company, and that it looked increasingly likely that the goblins would turn on other. Thus it appears that the Venture Company is a powerful competitor in the city, but how they \"run\" the city is unclear, perhaps they have some control over the city as a mafia, manipulating the elected officials and &lt;a href=\"Lawkeepers\"&gt;Lawkeepers&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn addition as noted above the Venture Company is run by a mogul, the hand of a trade prince. This would imply that Razdunk and the Venture Company has either betrayed its trade prince or one of the princes has betrayed the others.\nSpeculation.\nSince the Company had acquired a way to raise &lt;a href=\"Mutated%20Venture%20Co.%20Drone\"&gt;voodoo drones&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Zanzil%20%28group%29\"&gt;Zanzil trolls&lt;/a&gt;, it is possible the various &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; members of the group in the &lt;a href=\"Grizzly%20Hills\"&gt;Grizzly Hills&lt;/a&gt; are not former &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; but zombies as well."}

If the battle turns against them nightcrawlers flee and fetch reinforcements. &lt;a href=\"Yshmeel\"&gt;Yshmeel&lt;/a&gt; is the chief nightcrawler of the &lt;a href=\"Ripfang%20tribe\"&gt;Ripfang tribe&lt;/a&gt;."}

According to &lt;a href=\"the%20Codex%20of%20Blood\"&gt;the Codex of Blood&lt;/a&gt;, Murmur was born long ago in a dimension of the cosmos unfathomable to mortal minds. It was so powerful that its entrance into existence shattered all reality around it. Mindless and existing only for chaos, its barest whisper was enough to destroy entire worlds.\nSome mortals tried to worship Murmur as a &lt;a href=\"god\"&gt;god&lt;/a&gt;, with some even attempting to control it, but the elemental didn't care and likely didn't even notice their presence. When it yawned, they were destroyed. However, one sorcerous mortal somehow managed to survive and devised a ritual through which he and his conspirators could bring Murmur into their world using vast amounts of captured &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;s. Whole civilizations were brought to extinction through his soul devices, and eventually he and his allies managed to summon the creature. They used powerful containment and silencing magics\u2014fueled by a constant supply of souls\u2014to keep Murmur contained, but they were unable to bend it to their will and so began devising different strategies. One after another, they failed, and in the process, they weakened the rituals and accidentally gave Murmur the slightest modicum of freedom. The Codex of Blood is the only thing that survived the subsequent cataclysm that destroyed their world.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Teron%20Gorefiend\"&gt;Teron'gor&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;ish &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt; faced heavy resistance from the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; entrenched in &lt;a href=\"Auchindoun\"&gt;Auchindoun&lt;/a&gt;, they reached beyond the veil of reality in the hopes of summoning a powerful &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; to aid them. Instead, they accidentally summoned Murmur, who materialized within Auchindoun. The shockwave of its arrival blasted the tomb city apart, killed many of the draenei, and leveled the surrounding forests, turning them into a charred wasteland later called the &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Wastes\"&gt;Bone Wastes&lt;/a&gt;. After overwhelming the surviving draenei, the Shadow Council contained Murmur within the city and left behind a few warlocks to keep the creature from getting loose and wreaking havoc on the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"\"In the beginning\"... \"So far away\"... such phrases cannot begin to describe this elemental's origin. Its existence heralds pure destruction. Worlds shatter and the pieces scatter at its whim. Only the truly mad would think to summon it. Perhaps there is yet time to banish Murmur before it fully enters Outland.\"\nStrategy.\nThe fight versus Murmur is relatively easy when everyone understands their role in the fight. No resistance gear is required.\nMurmur starts with 40% health, which is a total of around 169k. Murmur is stuck to the place just like &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; and he has an aggro range of 10-15 yards. Additionally, he uses a powerful ranged attack if there are no possible melee targets.\nThe main tank will run in and get aggro while the rest of the group spreads out at maximum spell/attack range to avoid extra damage from the AoE explosion from the Touch of Murmur effect. \nSonic Boom.\nPeriodically, Murmur will pulse and emote. At this point, he will stop attacking, and the tank and any melee will need to run out of the circle around him, or they will be hit by his Sonic Boom. Warriors should Intervene to someone standing outside the ring. This will almost guarantee no damage from Sonic Boom. The tank will then need to get back in range immediately.\nAlternatively, the tank can stay in and take the hit from the Sonic Boom. A large heal will need to be timed right after the hit, in order to restore his health before Murmur resumes attacking. Rogues can &lt;a href=\"Cloak%20of%20Shadows\"&gt;Cloak of Shadows&lt;/a&gt; through a Sonic Boom if timed correctly.\n Macro - Using the following macro can be useful for warrior tanks: \n /rw Sonic Boom Incoming. Get out of range NOW!\n /target \"Name of Healer/DPS\"\n /cast Intervene\nMurmur's Touch.\nThe ranged classes will be primarily concerned with Murmur's Touch. Everyone needs to watch for this debuff and run away from his teammates to avoid damaging and silencing them. Spells such as Divine Shield will prevent damage from occurring to the person with the debuff, but the AoE effect still occurs. A common tactic to avoid the fall damage that results from being launched in the air is for the player with this debuff to run into the tent situated in the area.\nIf a healer receives Murmur's Touch, he should watch the countdown timer carefully and make sure the tank is healed to near-full before Murmur's Touch goes off. The explosion will interrupt the healer's spellcasting, and since he's considered to be \"moving\" while he's in the air, the healer won't be able to cast any healing spells other than instant-cast spells until he lands.\nHeroic mode.\nEveryone must position themselves completely within Murmur's raised inner circle to avoid his Thundering Storm\u2014if you're on the raised ledge or outside you will be hit by Thundering Storm. \nHave all players close, on the flat ground immediately next to Murmur. When Touch of Murmur occurs, there is a large, very visible green beam and all players are drawn to the target. The person with the debuff should run through Murmur to the back, where he can detonate without hitting party members. He can then run forward and resume the fight. Alternatively, use fighting positions such that no party member is within 10 yards of any other, and everyone can simply run back to their positions when drawn to the target of the touch.\nMurmur is surrounded by a raised ring. Stay completely inside the ring\u2014not on the inner slope, but on the flat part of the floor\u2014to avoid Thundering Storm. When Murmur starts casting Sonic Boom, run across the raised ring to get completely outside of it. When he finishes casting it, run back inside of the ring. The raised ring itself, including both slopes, is a death zone\u2014characters standing on it get hit by \"both\" Sonic Boom and Thundering Storm. The Sonic Boom has a snare component, so victims take a long time to get back inside of the dark ring, take multiple Thundering Storm hits, and die. Run out and in quickly!\nMurmur is very unforgiving about not being tanked in heroic mode; he will start using Resonance almost immediately. Even a tank charging back may not prevent a single application of it. He will also fire off a Thundering Storm immediately after Sonic Boom.\nA priest healer is capable of healing through the sonic boom with little trouble. When you see Murmur casting Sonic Boom, immediately place a and &lt;a href=\"Prayer%20of%20Mending\"&gt;Prayer of Mending&lt;/a&gt; on the tank. Time a &lt;a href=\"Prayer%20of%20Healing\"&gt;Prayer of Healing&lt;/a&gt; to land immediately after the Sonic Boom. Follow through with a second &lt;a href=\"Prayer%20of%20Healing\"&gt;Prayer of Healing&lt;/a&gt; and 2 &lt;a href=\"Circle%20of%20Healing\"&gt;Circle of Healing&lt;/a&gt; if you have it. If &lt;a href=\"Circle%20of%20Healing\"&gt;Circle of Healing&lt;/a&gt; is not available any other healing spell can be used. This allows the entire group to stay put through the Sonic Boom."}

He is the lord of the &lt;a href=\"infinite%20dragonflight\"&gt;infinite dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, and can be encountered within the &lt;a href=\"End%20Time\"&gt;End Time&lt;/a&gt; dungeon and briefly during &lt;a href=\"Dawn%20of%20the%20Infinite\"&gt;Dawn of the Infinite&lt;/a&gt;. His goals appear to be the opposite of Nozdormu; rather than preserve the timeways, he wishes to twist them into an 'idealized' version of the timeline, where his dragons reign supreme.\nBackground.\nMurozond is the leader of the &lt;a href=\"infinite%20dragonflight\"&gt;infinite dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, and a future counterpart of the Aspect of Time, &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt;. In some future, Nozdormu is corrupted by the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s and creates the infinite dragonflight. Murozond is described as existing out of time, living alone among time-twisted echoes of the past. He made his lair in one of an infinite number of potential futures, called the &lt;a href=\"End%20Time\"&gt;End Time&lt;/a&gt;. He notably wanted to prevent &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, by intervening at various points in time during his life, from stopping the &lt;a href=\"Hour%20of%20Twilight\"&gt;Hour of Twilight&lt;/a&gt;. Murozond believed that the End Time, a potential future where the Hour of Twilight successfully happens, would still make for a much better future than the \"true End Time\" that he had witnessed.\nWar of the Ancients.\nWhen Nozdormu spoke to &lt;a href=\"Krasus\"&gt;Krasus&lt;/a&gt; who had been thrown back in time, he apologized and asked forgiveness for what he will do in the future. Nozdormu said that it is his curse and fate to know what will happen but be unable to prevent it, for he must be what he is destined to be.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nThe master of the infinite dragonflight tasked &lt;a href=\"Aeonus\"&gt;Aeonus&lt;/a&gt; to oversee the disruption of key moments in the true timeway.\nWrath of the Lich King.\n&lt;a href=\"Chromie\"&gt;Chromie&lt;/a&gt; sought to discover who the leader of the infinite dragons was. Once her spell was finished she saw an image of Nozdormu, but dismissed that answer as wrong because it didn't make sense to her.\nCharge of the Aspects.\nAfter Nozdormu sent twelve bronze dragons through the timeways, they discovered that no matter where they attempted to journey in history, they always emerged at the same point in the future, the Hour of Twilight. The twelve came under attack by the infinite dragonflight, with Murozond personally almost killing &lt;a href=\"Zirion\"&gt;Zirion&lt;/a&gt;, who would later die from his injuries.\nCataclysm.\nMurozond used the &lt;a href=\"Hourglass%20of%20Time\"&gt;Hourglass of Time&lt;/a&gt; to interfere with his past counterpart's efforts to send heroes to the past, which would result in a change of the bleak future, in which the maddened wyrm made his lair.\nMurozond was ultimately confronted and killed by Azeroth's heroes, with his dying words calling out to &lt;a href=\"Aman%27Thul\"&gt;Aman'Thul&lt;/a&gt;. Even with his death, Nozdormu knew that he would some day fall in the future, and the cycle would repeat.\nDragonflight.\nAfter the discovery of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chrono-Lord%20Deios\"&gt;Chrono-Lord Deios&lt;/a&gt; intended to usher in the coming of the one true aspect, whose dominion shall be infinite.\n&lt;a href=\"Eternus\"&gt;Eternus&lt;/a&gt; later attacked Nozdormu at the &lt;a href=\"Temporal%20Conflux\"&gt;Temporal Conflux&lt;/a&gt; with the intention of corrupting him into Murozond, and though she failed in this attempt, she left she told Nozdormu that she would try again. Nozdormu, resigned to his fate, sadly admitted that he thought he had more time. He asked Chromie to do what must be done when the time comes, and Chromie promised that instead she'd find another way, and search for answers in every timeline to save him.\nAt some point, the infinite dragonflight made a bargain with &lt;a href=\"Iridikron\"&gt;Iridikron&lt;/a&gt;, in exchange for taking him to the time of &lt;a href=\"Galakrond\"&gt;Galakrond&lt;/a&gt;'s demise, he would act as a distraction to any allies of the bronze dragonflight that sought to stop them. Their plan finally came to pass, as while Chromie and adventures were focused on stopping Iridikron from acquiring Galakrond's essence, Chrono-Lord Deios did battle with the Proto-Aspects and seemingly corrupted the proto-dragon version of Nozdormu into Murozond. With this single time alteration, the infinite dragonflight changed the history of Azeroth and created a new timeline - where Tyr never died and became a &lt;a href=\"Tyr%2C%20the%20Infinite%20Keeper\"&gt;infinite-corrupt version of himself&lt;/a&gt; that guarded the &lt;a href=\"Infinite%20Citadel\"&gt;Infinite Citadel&lt;/a&gt;. In order to restore Azeroth's timeline, Chromie and her allies made their way back into the past and aided the Proto-Aspects in stopping Deios, while Iridikron was able to successfully claim Galakrond's essence.\nIn the aftermath, Nozdormu thanked adventures for saving him from the fate that he thought was all but inevitable, showing his belief that his transformation into Murozond is no longer an inevitability. Though it is unclear if the rise of Murozond has been completely averted, as surviving members of the infinite dragonflight like Eternus would presumably still be seeking to transform Nozdormu into Murozond.\nInevitable?\nNozdormu's fate as Murozond is a point of contention within and outside of the game itself. The infinite dragonflight believes Murozond to be inevitable; indeed some form of him has existed as Murozond is ultimately faced in the End Times as a boss. &lt;a href=\"Chronikar\"&gt;Chronikar&lt;/a&gt; is said to have spent multiple lifetimes in service to the flight; showing that Murozond's corruption and ultimate escape from the concept of the timeways is non-linear.\nWhether Nozdormu's fate was inevitable seems to have been unclear. Nozdormu stated that the End Time was not an \"inevitable\" future, &lt;a href=\"Alurmi\"&gt;Alurmi&lt;/a&gt; adds afterwards that the End Time was overwritten as a timestrand, and &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; in her post-\"Cataclysm\" meeting with Nozdormu and others confirms that they \"had altered that future forever\", thereby erasing his responsibility for Murozond.\nFrom the titanic perspective in , it was stated that Nozdormu's fate was \"inescapable\". Yet Murozond is ultimately prevented by the intervention of heroes and Chronormu in &lt;a href=\"Dawn%20of%20the%20Infinite\"&gt;Dawn of the Infinite&lt;/a&gt;, leaving Nozdormu to believe that Murozond is not an inevitability for him; just one of many possibilities. On the other hand, Murozond's rise was said to be a result of the Old Gods tricking him into trying to subvert his fixed death, which is not what occurs in Dawn of the Infinite. He was also merely said to be using End Time as a base, not that he is from that timeline. All this together means Murozond could still occur.\nIn Hearthstone.\nMurozond was available as an Arena-exclusive during the limited-time event in \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThe Lord of the Infinite reappears in the \"\" expansion as the legendary priest card , whose Battlecry effect replays all of the cards the player's opponent played the previous turn.

After the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s showed him his own death, the tormented Nozdormu was tricked by the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s into trying to subvert his mortality.

The Hourglass casts Rewind Time when a player interacts with it, but the Hourglass can only be used up to five times during the encounter.\nAfter Murozond is killed, the corpse gains the Fading buff.\nStrategy.\nMurozond is a DPS race with a unique hourglass mechanic. The overall strategy is to kill the boss before the hourglass runs out of charges and damage becomes unhealable. Timely use of the hourglass can trivialize this boss greatly.\nOne key detail for all players to remember is that ability cooldowns are reset each time the hourglass is used and it is highly recommended players use all their cooldowns every time they are up. Abilities like &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20Image\"&gt;Mirror Image&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Avenging%20Wrath\"&gt;Avenging Wrath&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Rapid%20Fire%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Rapid Fire (Classic)&lt;/a&gt; are all good examples, but also major defensive cooldowns like &lt;a href=\"Shield%20Wall\"&gt;Shield Wall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Devotion%20Aura\"&gt;Devotion Aura&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Dead\"&gt;Army of the Dead&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tranquility\"&gt;Tranquility&lt;/a&gt; are reset with each use of the hourglass as well. All debuffs are also wiped from players allowing reuse of &lt;a href=\"Bloodlust\"&gt;Bloodlust&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Heroism\"&gt;Heroism&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Time%20Warp\"&gt;Time Warp&lt;/a&gt; as well (Note, it does not reset a Core Hound's &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Hysteria\"&gt;Ancient Hysteria&lt;/a&gt;), it is recommended to wait for the Blessing of the Bronze Dragonflight to fade before use to maximize the longevity of the haste. A final benefit of the hourglass is all dead players are brought back to life with each use.\nMurozond needs to be faced away from the group, but positioning can quickly become compromised from Distortion Bombs. Healers need to ensure they can stay in range of tanks as best as possible while keeping DPS alive. Hourglass use should be assigned to the ranged DPS, Mages, and Warlocks are a great choice for this because of &lt;a href=\"Blink\"&gt;Blink&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Demonic%20Circle\"&gt;Demonic Circle&lt;/a&gt;. Players should stay away from the hourglass until they are about to use it to avoid getting Distortion Bombs placed near it. If done well, Murozond will die on the fourth or final use of the hourglass, depending on your group's overall DPS.\nThe player assigned to activate the hourglass should wait until one of the following conditions occurs:\nFallen players should not release when dying before all hourglasses are consumed, since the hourglass will return the player to their living state. Battle resurrections reset their cooldowns as well, but rarely have much utility in this fight.\nQuotes.\n1. \n2. \n3. \n4. \nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

Bodily injury or serious permament damage may occur from a bad jump.\nRewards.\nYou will receive .\nProgress.\nDid I mention my love for eggs?\nRequired items:\nCompletion.\nWell, it's no egg\u2026 Hey! I love chicken too! I'll just chomp right through this ginourmous talon! Thanks!\nGains.\nUpon completion of this quest you will gain:\nNotes.\nWazat wants you to use the &lt;a href=\"Jump-a-tron%204000\"&gt;Jump-a-tron 4000&lt;/a&gt; to get him a Mysterious Egg from the large nest just west of his camp (the nest is in a tree). There are three ways to get into the nest: Use the Jump-a-tron 4000, run and jump off the cliff, or use a flying mount.\nUsing your mount is self explanatory. Simply flying to the nest and trying to grab an egg may not spawn the Matriarch, as actually using the Jump-a-Tron seems to be an important part of the quest. This quest was created before the requirement for flying mounts was lowered to 60.\nUsing the Jump-a-tron 4000.\nIf you stand on or next to the Jump-a-tron 4000, click on it to use it. An action bar \"Using Jump-a-tron 4000\" appears and counts down 5 seconds. You are thrown high into the air in a long trajectory and receive the &lt;a href=\"Jump-a-tron\"&gt;Jump-a-tron&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"buff\"&gt;buff&lt;/a&gt; (3 minute duration). This will slow your fall so you can land safely without damage. You cannot control your direction or distance while your are in-flight. However, you can dispel your &lt;a href=\"Jump-a-tron\"&gt;Jump-a-tron&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"buff\"&gt;buff&lt;/a&gt; which will cause you to fall directly down to the ground.\nWARNING - The Jump-a-tron 4000 will launch you high into the air, and dispelling the Jump-a-tron buff causing you to fall can mean a fall to the death. You are launched very high up, you may not survive the fall damage received if you miss the nest. Soon after you loot the egg you will have to battle &lt;a href=\"Windroc%20Matriarch\"&gt;Windroc Matriarch&lt;/a&gt;! Since damage received from falling is a percentage of your total health, if you remove this buff from too high you will die no matter how much health you have. It's a good idea to do a few practice jumps to make sure you are lined up correctly and will fly over the nest.\nFighting the Windroc Matriarch.\nOnce you are in the nest, click on the Mysterious Egg. This will complete the first part of the quest objectives - Attempt to Steal Egg.\nOnce a member of the party attempts to steal the Mysterious Egg (only one member of the party has to attempt to steal the egg for all party members to get credit), you have about 45 seconds until the &lt;a href=\"Windroc%20Matriarch\"&gt;Windroc Matriarch&lt;/a&gt; appears and attacks. So if you are the party member who jumped in the nest, heal yourself and re-equip your gear (if you took any off to avoid durability damage) before she spawns. Then kill her, loot her &lt;a href=\"Severed%20Talon%20of%20the%20Matriarch\"&gt;severed talon&lt;/a&gt; and speak with &lt;a href=\"Wazat\"&gt;Wazat&lt;/a&gt; to complete the quest."}
