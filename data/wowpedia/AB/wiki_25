When Korthek betrayed his duty as a Keeper, declared himself emperor, and sought to unleash Mythrax to conquer &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;, Vorrik and his followers \u2014 known as the &lt;a href=\"Devoted\"&gt;Devoted&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 remained loyal to their &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sethraliss\"&gt;Sethraliss&lt;/a&gt; and have been fighting Korthek's &lt;a href=\"Faithless\"&gt;Faithless&lt;/a&gt; ever since.\nBiography.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Mythrax\"&gt;Mythrax&lt;/a&gt; was defeated and buried beneath &lt;a href=\"Atul%27Aman\"&gt;Atul'Aman&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sethraliss\"&gt;Sethraliss&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"sethrak\"&gt;sethrak&lt;/a&gt; knew that something had to be done to prevent anyone from raising the Unraveler again. &lt;a href=\"Sulthis\"&gt;Sulthis&lt;/a&gt; called upon Vorrik and &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Korthek\"&gt;Korthek&lt;/a&gt; to aid him in creating a barrier around Atul'Aman, and they agreed. Thus, the &lt;a href=\"Keepers%20%28sethrak%29\"&gt;Keepers&lt;/a&gt; were formed, and together they cast a barrier to seal away Atul'Aman. Each Keeper created a keystone imbued with their power, to ensure that the tomb would remain undisturbed.\nVorrik was regarded for being just, faithful, and firm, known for his profound and unwavering service to Sethraliss as well as his wisdom and clarity of vision. In those days, Vorrik, Korthek, and Sulthis led all sethrak in their worship of Sethraliss. Vorrik had a &lt;a href=\"Vorrik%27s%20Sanctum\"&gt;personal sanctum&lt;/a&gt; hidden away in the hills, where he could meditate.\nEventually, Keeper Korthek grew hungry for war and plotted to unearth Mythrax and use him as a weapon to conquer &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;. He soon raised an army of like-minded sethrak known as the &lt;a href=\"Faithless\"&gt;Faithless&lt;/a&gt; that began slaughtering those who opposed them, including Sulthis, and forced Vorrik and other &lt;a href=\"Devoted\"&gt;Devoted&lt;/a&gt; still loyal to Sethraliss out of their home and into hiding. The Devoted have been fighting the Faithless ever since, with the Faithless hunting for Vorrik and his key.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nAround the time that &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; forces arrive in &lt;a href=\"Vol%27dun\"&gt;Vol'dun&lt;/a&gt; and take control of &lt;a href=\"Shatterstone%20Harbor\"&gt;Shatterstone Harbor&lt;/a&gt;, Vorrik is captured by the Faithless and held captive alongside the Alliance soldier &lt;a href=\"Private%20James\"&gt;Private James&lt;/a&gt;. He sneaks his keystone into James' pocket, ensuring that the Faithless don't find it when they search Vorrik himself. Vorrik is subsequently beaten and poisoned by &lt;a href=\"krolusk\"&gt;krolusk&lt;/a&gt; venom before being cast aside and left for dead in &lt;a href=\"Bonetrail%20Gulch\"&gt;Bonetrail Gulch&lt;/a&gt;.\nShortly after, an Alliance adventurer and &lt;a href=\"Sergeant%20Ermey\"&gt;Sergeant Ermey&lt;/a&gt; come across Vorrik in their search for James and create an antivenom that restores the sethrak's health. Thankful for the rescue, Vorrik tells the two Alliance members that his people will aid in searching for James. The trio subsequently ride to the &lt;a href=\"Terrace%20of%20the%20Devoted\"&gt;Terrace of the Devoted&lt;/a&gt; on the back of Vorrik's &lt;a href=\"Tamed%20Pterrordax\"&gt;pterrordax&lt;/a&gt;, with Vorrik explaining the history of the sethrak along the way, but upon arrval they find that the terrace is under attack from the Faithless. Vorrik asks the adventurer to break the Faithless' ranks and destroy their siege equipment, while Ermey sends the hero to rescue James from Faithless captivity. Afterward, James returns the keystone to Vorrik, who explains the story of Sethraliss and Mythrax, the formation of the Keepers, and Korthek's betrayal. Shaken by the information, Ermey, James, and the Alliance hero leave to report back to &lt;a href=\"Halford%20Wyrmbane\"&gt;High Commander Wyrmbane&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome time later, Vorrik is taken captive by the Faithless who are still attacking the Terrace of the Devoted, but he is quickly rescued by a &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; adventurer who arrives at the sanctuary with &lt;a href=\"Serrik\"&gt;Serrik&lt;/a&gt; and the two &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari troll&lt;/a&gt;s &lt;a href=\"Warguard%20Rakera\"&gt;Warguard Rakera&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bladeguard%20Kaja\"&gt;Bladeguard Kaja&lt;/a&gt;. The adventurer reveals to Vorrik that they had earlier obtained &lt;a href=\"Sulthis%27%20Keystone\"&gt;Sulthis' Keystone&lt;/a&gt; from the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Ahjin\"&gt;Zul'Ahjin&lt;/a&gt;. Vorrik tells the adventurer, Rakera, and Kaja the history of the sethrak before placing Sulthis' keystone next to his own recently-returned key.\nThough Vorrik has long held out hope of being able to convince Korthek peacefully to abandon his heresy, he resolves that all of Zandalar remains at risk as long as Korthek and his allies hold even one key to Mythrax's prison. After asking Kaja and Rakera to stay at the Sanctuary and guard the keystones, Vorrik and the adventurer travel north to sneak into Korthek's fortress and confront the \"emperor\" together. However, upon reaching Vorrik's &lt;a href=\"Vorrik%27s%20Sanctum\"&gt;old sanctum&lt;/a&gt;, they discover that it has been claimed by the adventurer's old friends, the &lt;a href=\"vulpera\"&gt;vulpera&lt;/a&gt;, who are in the process of fighting the Faithless and rescuing vulpera slaves. Vorrik asks to take a few moments to meditate and gather his thoughts, and in the meantime sends the hero to aid the vulpera &lt;a href=\"Nisha\"&gt;Nisha&lt;/a&gt; in sowing chaos among the Faithless at the &lt;a href=\"Crater%20of%20Conquerors\"&gt;Crater of Conquerors&lt;/a&gt; in order to distract Korthek's minions. When the adventurer returns, Vorrik sends them to the &lt;a href=\"Crackling%20Ridge\"&gt;Crackling Ridge&lt;/a&gt; above, where the Faithless are subjugating the native &lt;a href=\"pterrordax\"&gt;pterrordax&lt;/a&gt;. Vorrik asks the hero to empower his &lt;a href=\"Vorrik%27s%20Staff\"&gt;staff&lt;/a&gt; by draining power from the Faithless' suppression spires as well as gather lightning bombs from the Faithless &lt;a href=\"skycaller\"&gt;skycaller&lt;/a&gt;s, all while he recruits the aid of the pterrordax leader &lt;a href=\"Rakjan%20the%20Unbroken\"&gt;Rakjan the Unbroken&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn order to lure Korthek out from his &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Sethraliss\"&gt;stolen temple&lt;/a&gt;, Vorrik and the champion ride Rakjan through the skies and create chaos among the Faithless army, with the adventurer throwing lightning bombs while Vorrik uses his charged staff to blast the Faithless armies. After Vorrik destroys a barrier blocking the way to the temple, Rakjan drops his two passengers off at the &lt;a href=\"Skycallers%27%20Spire\"&gt;Skycallers' Spire&lt;/a&gt; to join up with the vulpera. Despite this, however, Korthek remains in hiding. While Vorrik drains power from the immense crystals around the terrace, he sends the adventurer to thin the Faithless' numbers as well as rescue a number of ancient relics from the Faithless so that they can be preserved in the Sanctuary of the Devoted. Shortly after, Korthek finally emerges, allowing Vorrik, the adventurer, and Nisha to engage him in battle. However, during the fight, the emperor reveals that his ally &lt;a href=\"General%20Jakra%27zet\"&gt;General Jakra'zet&lt;/a&gt; already has Korthek's keystone and has by now likely retrieved Sulthis and Vorrik's stones as well. Eventually, Korthek is defeated and tells Vorrik that he never forced any of the sethrak to follow him and that their people are conquerors. Vorrik replies that \"Our people are dead, because of you\", then kills the emperor.\nVorrik and the adventurer hurry back to the Sanctuary of the Devoted to find that Korthek was speaking the truth and that Jakra'zet and his troops stole the keystones while Vorrik was away. Vorrik and the hero continue to Atul'Aman to catch up with Kaja and Rakera, who have chased after the general. After rescuing the two trolls from strange tentacles in the crypts below Atul'Aman, the group confronts Jakra'zet deeper in the crypt. After a battle, the general is mortally wounded, but before Kaja has a chance to kill him, the general leaps into the nearby pit, sacrificing himself to enable Mythrax's resurrection. The group barely escapes Atul'Aman with their lives after the &lt;a href=\"C%27Thrax\"&gt;C'Thrax&lt;/a&gt; rises from the pit. Back at the Sanctuary of the Devoted, Vorrik states that they cannot let Mythrax unleash his destruction upon the world once more and that they need Sethraliss' aid more than ever. However, the loa has yet to be reborn, and so Vorrik sends adventurers into the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Sethraliss\"&gt;Temple of Sethraliss&lt;/a&gt; to investigate. The heroes eventually restore Sethraliss' &lt;a href=\"Avatar%20of%20Sethraliss\"&gt;avatar&lt;/a&gt;, who then joins Vorrik, Kaja, and Rakera at the Sanctuary."}

Years ago, the &lt;a href=\"sethrak\"&gt;sethrak&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Vorrik\"&gt;Vorrik&lt;/a&gt; used the cave as his personal sanctum and as a shrine to &lt;a href=\"Sethraliss\"&gt;Sethraliss&lt;/a&gt; where he could meditate, until he was forced to abandon it due to &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Korthek\"&gt;Korthek&lt;/a&gt;'s betrayal.

They are descended from &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"iron%20vrykul\"&gt;iron vrykul&lt;/a&gt; that were afflicted with the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Flesh\"&gt;Curse of Flesh&lt;/a&gt; and are in turn the progenitors of the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; race, who were originally vrykul children that were born weak and deformed as a result of the curse.\nBefore the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, the vrykul of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; were led by &lt;a href=\"King%20Ymiron\"&gt;King Ymiron&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Utgarde%20Keep\"&gt;Utgarde Keep&lt;/a&gt;, and in an effort to stave off the curse of flesh, he ordered his people to put themselves into hibernation for the thousands of years that would follow. However, this was not the case for other vrykul around the world, as thousands of years ago, another group of vrykul migrated to the sacred region of &lt;a href=\"Stormheim\"&gt;Stormheim&lt;/a&gt; in search of their true gods. Being a seafaring race, some also took to the seas, with one such group settling on &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;, inhabiting the region of &lt;a href=\"Drustvar\"&gt;Drustvar&lt;/a&gt; as the &lt;a href=\"Drust\"&gt;Drust&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; began the &lt;a href=\"War%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war in the frozen wastes&lt;/a&gt;, the vrykul of Northrend awoke and saw him as a God of Death to serve. Led once again by King Ymiron, the vrykul pledged themselves to his cause and many were absorbed into the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; armies. Following the victory of the living, the vrykul kept to themselves with no death god to serve, returning to their former way of life.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nThe &lt;a href=\"iron%20vrykul\"&gt;iron vrykul&lt;/a&gt; were created as part of the &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt; during the ordering of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the other Keepers decided to ask the Pantheon to empower the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt; for their heroism against &lt;a href=\"Galakrond\"&gt;Galakrond&lt;/a&gt;, Odyn was vehemently against it, stating that only titan-forged could be trusted to defend Azeroth, as did not trust the proto-dragons. He sought to create his own elite army, one of steadfast and valiant stature, and saw the &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; to be the most desirable candidate for his army. The Aspects were empowered despite his objections, and so Odyn with the help of his adopted daughter &lt;a href=\"Helya\"&gt;Helya&lt;/a&gt; took a section of &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt; and raised it into the sky, creating the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Halls of Valor&lt;/a&gt;, and in doing so relinquished his position of Prime Designate. He later told the vrykul that those who died a worthy death in battle would have their spirits brought to the Halls and given new immortal bodies infused with the power of the storm to fight as his &lt;a href=\"Valarjar\"&gt;Valarjar&lt;/a&gt;, which Odyn thought would be better defenders than the dragons. In order to retrieve the spirits of the deceased, Odyn would need vrykul to volunteer to become &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt; - inspired by the &lt;a href=\"Kyrian\"&gt;Kyrian&lt;/a&gt; he had seen when he sacrificed his eye to &lt;a href=\"Mueh%27zala\"&gt;Mueh'zala&lt;/a&gt; - and take those heroic vrykul spirits from the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;. The vrykul objected, and Helya tried to talk him out of it. Instead, Odyn transformed Helya into the first Val'kyr and ordered her to do the job for him.\nAfter Keeper &lt;a href=\"Loken\"&gt;Loken&lt;/a&gt; had fallen under the Old God &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt;'s sway, he established sole dominance of &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt; and Ulduar's servant &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt;. He also banished a great number of his servants to the &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Peaks\"&gt;Storm Peaks&lt;/a&gt; and sealed the fortress of Ulduar. As Helya nursed resentment against Odyn for thousands of years, Loken convinced her to turn against him. Helya used the same magic that had been used to lock the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Plane\"&gt;Elemental Plane&lt;/a&gt; to seal Odyn and his Valarjar army inside the Halls of Valor, and then decided to take vrykul souls in her new realm &lt;a href=\"Helheim\"&gt;Helheim&lt;/a&gt;. Helya would be replaced by &lt;a href=\"Eyir\"&gt;Eyir&lt;/a&gt; as the leader of the Val'kyr, and Loken would go on to steal Odyn's title of Prime Designate.\nFor many ages after Loken's betrayal, the titan-forged who were exiled from Ulduar spread across northern Kalimdor, many of the vrykul remained aboveground congregating into small clans. Some of these factions wandered the harsh northern wastes as nomads. Others established dwellings across the forested tundra of the region. A tenuous peace existed between these groups of titan-forged, but in time Loken's own creations the &lt;a href=\"fire%20giant\"&gt;fire giant&lt;/a&gt;s &lt;a href=\"Volkhan\"&gt;Volkhan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ignis%20the%20Furnace%20Master\"&gt;Ignis&lt;/a&gt; saw the &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Peaks\"&gt;Storm Peaks&lt;/a&gt; around Ulduar ripe for conquest. They armed the fierce &lt;a href=\"Winterskorn%20clan\"&gt;Winterskorn clan&lt;/a&gt; of vrykul to attack other titan-forged across the Storm Peaks, thus beginning the &lt;a href=\"Winterskorn%20War\"&gt;Winterskorn War&lt;/a&gt;. However, as they began their conquest, anomalies began to appear in the Winterskorn. The vrykul's metallic skin became brittle and weak, and they began showing the first symptoms of the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Flesh\"&gt;Curse of Flesh&lt;/a&gt;. They caught the attention of &lt;a href=\"Tyr\"&gt;Tyr&lt;/a&gt; when they attacked the &lt;a href=\"earthen\"&gt;earthen&lt;/a&gt;. Tyr asked the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspect\"&gt;Dragon Aspect&lt;/a&gt;s for aid, and the war ended with &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt; putting the Winterskorn into a timeless sleep beneath &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;northern Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. And so their campaign to seek and conquer the world was cut short and the world was spared from their barbaric ways.\nWith the Winterskorn defeated in the war, the titan-forged were still divided. Tyr and his allies, Archaedas and Ironaya, stole the &lt;a href=\"Discs%20of%20Norgannon\"&gt;Discs of Norgannon&lt;/a&gt; from Loken and gathered great numbers of titan-forged who dwelled around Ulduar and whom they saw as innocent victims of Loken's treachery. A large group of peaceful vrykul afflicted by the curse of flesh, most of the surviving earthen, and many of the mechagnomes agreed to flee with them southward in preparation for their next move. They traveled for weeks until they reached what would one day become known as the &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt;. It is here that Tyr sacrificed himself fighting a &lt;a href=\"C%27Thrax\"&gt;C'Thrax&lt;/a&gt; monstrosity in order to allow the rest of the titan-forged to flee further south. The vrykul were so moved by the keeper's deeds that they decided to settle at the battle site and stand vigil over his grave until the end of their days.\nWith the Winterskorn clan asleep in their deep vaults, and many of the earthen being sealed within &lt;a href=\"Uldaman\"&gt;Uldaman&lt;/a&gt;, the remaining iron vrykul clans continued to dominate the north of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. Over the eons, their disparate cultures flourished in unique ways across the unforgiving north. One of the mightiest clans, the &lt;a href=\"Dragonflayer%20clan\"&gt;Dragonflayer clan&lt;/a&gt; much like the Winterskorn found their iron hides were gradually turning to flesh over time. They tried to balance their diminishing strength by enslaving proto-dragons much like the Winterskorn did in previous centuries. Unlike the &lt;a href=\"Winterskorn%20clan\"&gt;Winterskorn clan&lt;/a&gt;, they didn't see them as mere beasts of war. They used the dragons as hunting companions and rode them during the battle. &lt;a href=\"Oktel%20Dragonblood\"&gt;Oktel Dragonblood&lt;/a&gt; was among one of the first to ride these dragons. The proto-dragons proved instrumental against the Dragonflayer's mortal enemy the &lt;a href=\"jalgar\"&gt;jalgar&lt;/a&gt;, and under &lt;a href=\"King%20Ymiron\"&gt;King Ymiron&lt;/a&gt; the vrykul defeated their foes driving them south.\nOne clan, in particular, struggled against the &lt;a href=\"curse%20of%20flesh\"&gt;curse of flesh&lt;/a&gt;. After exhausting all natural attempts, the tribe sought the aid of its priestesses. These women plumbed the world of spirits for answers, but they found the malevolent &lt;a href=\"Helya\"&gt;Helya&lt;/a&gt;, lying in wait. Their ritual went horribly wrong, as Helya further corrupted those that sought freedom from their curse. These eternally vengeful beings would swell the ranks of Helya's &lt;a href=\"Kvaldir\"&gt;Kvaldir&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe birth of humanity.\nUnder &lt;a href=\"King%20Ymiron\"&gt;King Ymiron&lt;/a&gt;'s reign, 15,000 years ago, on the heels of the Dragonflayer's victory over the jalgar, the curse of flesh took another turn vrykul's children started to be born smaller, which was considered \"weak and ugly\" by vrykul standards. These infants were dubbed \"aberrations\" and \"runts\", and vrykul society was deeply divided on how to deal with them. Some vrykul were disgusted by these \"aberrations\" and beseeched their ruler, Ymiron, to have them all killed, citing a need to keep the vrykul race pure; others pleaded with him to show them mercy, protesting that despite their weakness, these infants were still their children. Ymiron meditated on the issue for some time before reaching a dangerous conclusion: that because the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s had not come to aid them in their hour of need, and because the vrykul knew of no other beings with power on the same level as their gods, the curse must have been created by the titans. Although this was not the case, the vrykul believed it, and at Ymiron's bidding they forsook their gods and titan worship was outlawed. Ymiron then took the side of those calling for the death of their malformed infants, and decreed that all parents with so-afflicted children must kill their young or be taken to &lt;a href=\"Gjalerbron\"&gt;Gjalerbron&lt;/a&gt; for execution.\nHowever, not all vrykul could bear to kill their own flesh and blood. Despite their king's harsh decree, they sheltered their children and took them away to a land far away from Northrend, the modern &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt;. They had heard stories of the vrykul clan that had followed Tyr and had settled in that area and decided it was a safe haven for their children. There they nursed and raised their children in secret, and taught them the stories and values of ancient vrykul society as well as the ways of foraging, masonry, smithing, and warfare. Finally, with heavy hearts, they left them in the care of the vrykul that inhabited Tirisfal, before returning to Northrend. These outcast vrykul \"runts\" would later form their own cultures and kingdoms, and became known as &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s.\nIt is unclear what happened to all of those parents who did not kill their children, but many if not most of them would come to no good end; a vicious vrykul warrior, Skadi, relentlessly hunted them down and killed any of them he came across. For this he was judged to have committed a true act of depravity, and was thereafter known as &lt;a href=\"Skadi%20the%20Ruthless\"&gt;Skadi the Ruthless&lt;/a&gt;.\nMost of the vrykul that had settled in Tirisfal Glades eventually died off or succumbed to the curse of flesh. One group lasted longer than the others and formed a secretive order known as &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Guard\"&gt;Tyr's Guard&lt;/a&gt; to protect Tyr's tomb. These vrykul knew that they would not live forever and decided to induct some of the new humans into their ranks to ensure the future of the group. They taught these new members the history of Tyr and the truth about the tomb. By the time that &lt;a href=\"Thoradin\"&gt;Thoradin&lt;/a&gt; united the humans into the &lt;a href=\"Arathor\"&gt;Arathorian Empire&lt;/a&gt;, the last vrykul of the human lands had long since gone extinct. However, tales persisted of a race of giants who had once walked among the humans and watched over them, like parents watching over their children. Weapons left behind by the vrykul were treated by the early humans as sacred heirlooms and tribal symbols.\nEventually, in an effort to stave off the curse of flesh, the Dragonflayers put themselves into hibernation in facilities such as &lt;a href=\"Gjalerbron\"&gt;Gjalerbron&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20of%20Ages\"&gt;Tribunal of Ages&lt;/a&gt;, a record of false history created by Loken, erroneously claims that he ordered this hibernation. The vrykul left their homes, villages, and keeps vacant as they slept. There they would remain undisturbed for thousands of years, even by the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt; of the world.\nOther vrykul in ancient times.\nAmong the &lt;a href=\"djaradin\"&gt;djaradin&lt;/a&gt;, there is a legend that long ago a warband of vrykul landed on the shores of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;. Led by their king, they carved their way through the land and destroyed several tribes, until they eventually fell against the &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt; half-giants. Only their king survived and stood alone on the battlefield, where he fought without rest for eight days and nights. In the end, he earned his place among the Qalashi djaradin as a dragonhunter, and fought alongside them for years, slaying countless dragons as he proved his worth a hundredfold. One day, he finally fell in battle with a powerful dragon a hundred times his size.\nAn ancestral homeland of the vrykul, &lt;a href=\"Stormheim\"&gt;Stormheim&lt;/a&gt; was at one point occupied by &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;elves&lt;/a&gt;. Vrykul forces led by the heroic king &lt;a href=\"Magnar%20Icebreaker\"&gt;Magnar Icebreaker&lt;/a&gt; launched a massive attack on Stormheim, surprising the Highborne with their ferocity. For weeks the elves and vrykul skirmished, with the latter scoring immediate victories and gaining enough momentum to push the Highborne out of the city. The elves' last chance to reclaim Stormheim happened at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Suramar%20Pass\"&gt;Battle of Suramar Pass&lt;/a&gt;, but in the end the vrykul stood victorious. The Highborne were forced to flee and never made a claim upon Stormheim again. Moments after the vrykul victory, traitors loyal to &lt;a href=\"Helya\"&gt;Helya&lt;/a&gt; and her &lt;a href=\"Helarjar\"&gt;Helarjar&lt;/a&gt; arose within Magnar's ranks and managed to kill both the king and his son &lt;a href=\"Hruthnir\"&gt;Hruthnir&lt;/a&gt;, but Magnar's people were able to rally and prevented the Helarjar from claiming Stormheim.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Halls of Valor&lt;/a&gt;, serving as a makeshift prison for &lt;a href=\"Odyn\"&gt;Odyn&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Valarjar\"&gt;Valarjar&lt;/a&gt;, would come to occupy the clouds high above Stormheim, and this would grant the region a special significance for the vrykul people. They worshiped Odyn as a deity and yearned to join the ranks of his formidable Valarjar. Though native to &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, many vrykul would make the voyage to the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt; over the years and gravitated towards Stormheim.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Sundering\"&gt;Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, many vrykul groups took the seas. Some of them settled on &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; and became known as the &lt;a href=\"Drust\"&gt;Drust&lt;/a&gt;.\nArrival of the Lich King.\nAs the Lich King initially tested his power in Northrend, lost vrykul tribes were slain by the Lich King's servants in their unending sleep that they were put under millennia ago by the Dragon Aspects, and they were raised into undeath as powerful new warriors.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nShortly before the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"War%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;War against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; stirred from his &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt; and sent his &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; minions to swarm across the land, destroying all in their path. The slumbering vrykul awakened soon after, beginning with those of &lt;a href=\"Jotunheim\"&gt;Jotunheim&lt;/a&gt;, the largest vrykul village in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. Many of them would come to believe that the Lich King was a god of death, and pledged themselves to him and the Scourge. The Winterskorn clan was made subservient to the Dragonflayer.\nWhile Arthas woke the vrykul, it was the simple greed of the &lt;a href=\"Northsea%20Freebooters\"&gt;Northsea Freebooters&lt;/a&gt;' &lt;a href=\"pirate\"&gt;pirate&lt;/a&gt;s that brought the &lt;a href=\"kvaldir\"&gt;kvaldir&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;'s shores, as they stole artifacts from a vrykul burial ground in &lt;a href=\"Howling%20Fjord\"&gt;Howling Fjord&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href=\"Shield%20Hill\"&gt;Shield Hill&lt;/a&gt;, and disturbed the spirits of the dead; later, the &lt;a href=\"tuskarr\"&gt;tuskarr&lt;/a&gt; tried to lay the spirits to rest by returning the stolen items, but it was too late. These cursed souls were called in from the sea to raid the coasts and take souls to their mistress &lt;a href=\"Helya\"&gt;Helya&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen they arrived in Northrend, the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; built two ports on the shores of the Howling Fjord, &lt;a href=\"Valgarde\"&gt;Valgarde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vengeance%20Landing\"&gt;Vengeance Landing&lt;/a&gt;. A month later, the vrykul of the &lt;a href=\"Dragonflayer%20clan\"&gt;Dragonflayer clan&lt;/a&gt; were awake, setting their worgs on his soldiers and blasting the half-built walls with fire from their proto-drakes. They turned against Valgarde, launching an ongoing series of attacks which were coordinated by &lt;a href=\"Ingvar%20the%20Plunderer\"&gt;Ingvar the Plunderer&lt;/a&gt; from the fortress of &lt;a href=\"Utgarde%20Keep\"&gt;Utgarde Keep&lt;/a&gt;. In turn, the &lt;a href=\"Winterskorn%20clan\"&gt;Winterskorn clan&lt;/a&gt; turned against Vengeance Landing.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarven&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Explorer%27s%20League\"&gt;Explorer's League&lt;/a&gt; set to work excavating Dragonflayer ruins near Valgarde, speculating that the vrykul were related to humans and that they were connected by evolution, via a \"missing link\" of some kind. It was then that a &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thoralius%20the%20Wise\"&gt;Thoralius the Wise&lt;/a&gt;, sent an Alliance adventurer into the spirit world to uncover the vrykul's past, where they found two visions of the past that revealed the events described above, thus revealing that there was no \"missing link\"; rather, the vrykul themselves were the missing link \u2013 they were the progenitors of humanity.\nOther vrykul were seen around Northrend, often aiding the Scourge in their endeavors. They held competitions where many elite warriors competed for the chance to become powerful undead servants of the Lich King. In &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt;, vrykul fought each other in the pit of &lt;a href=\"Valhalas\"&gt;Valhalas&lt;/a&gt;; the winners of these combats became one of their &lt;a href=\"Ymirjar\"&gt;Ymirjar&lt;/a&gt;, the elite warrior caste created by &lt;a href=\"King%20Ymiron\"&gt;King Ymiron&lt;/a&gt; in service of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, and the loser became a &lt;a href=\"vargul\"&gt;vargul&lt;/a&gt;, an undead creature. The responsibility for raising the dead in this fashion fell to a new type of &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt;, winged spirits of vrykul women with vast necromantic powers under the control of the Lich King. The inhabitants of &lt;a href=\"Valkyrion\"&gt;Valkyrion&lt;/a&gt; aspired towards this state, and many obtained it. However, even the vrykul loyal to the Scourge were fighting each other. Had &lt;a href=\"King%20Ymiron\"&gt;King Ymiron&lt;/a&gt; blown the horns and called for all of the leaders of the &lt;a href=\"ymirjar\"&gt;ymirjar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"mjordin\"&gt;mjordin&lt;/a&gt; to unite, the vrykul would've become a force more powerful than any other within the Scourge. This action would've organized the vrykul nation, but Ymiron fell before he could return triumphantly to Icecrown.\nOther vrykul refused the call of the Lich King, such as the &lt;a href=\"Hyldnir\"&gt;Hyldnir&lt;/a&gt;, the main vrykul tribe in &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Peaks\"&gt;Storm Peaks&lt;/a&gt;, whose stronghold is situated at &lt;a href=\"Brunnhildar%20Village\"&gt;Brunnhildar Village&lt;/a&gt;, and who reasserted their loyalty to the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s, or at least to the &lt;a href=\"Keeper\"&gt;Keeper&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thorim\"&gt;Thorim&lt;/a&gt;. They have a strict matriarchal society with the males, both Hyldnir and other races, as they think men are good for naught but slave labor. Because of that disdain, most weren't interested in allying with the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Yulda%20the%20Stormspeaker\"&gt;Yulda the Stormspeaker&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Valkyrion\"&gt;Valkyrion&lt;/a&gt;, who delivered her village to the Lich King in exchange for him making her &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt;. One of their number, &lt;a href=\"Sif\"&gt;Sif&lt;/a&gt;, had been Thorim's wife a long time ago, and they held a contest, the &lt;a href=\"Hyldsmeet\"&gt;Hyldsmeet&lt;/a&gt;, to see which among them would prove worthy to rule alongside Thor in her place.\nFinally, within the halls of &lt;a href=\"Ulduar%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt;, a number of vrykul could be found as members of the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;. The mad &lt;a href=\"keeper\"&gt;keeper&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Loken\"&gt;Loken&lt;/a&gt; also used the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Wills\"&gt;Forge of Wills&lt;/a&gt; inside the complex to create new titan-forged vrykul, &lt;a href=\"iron%20vrykul\"&gt;iron vrykul&lt;/a&gt; uncorrupted by the &lt;a href=\"curse%20of%20flesh\"&gt;curse of flesh&lt;/a&gt;, to serve in his &lt;a href=\"Iron%20army\"&gt;Iron army&lt;/a&gt;.\nFall of the Lich King.\nBy the time the &lt;a href=\"Ashen%20Verdict\"&gt;Ashen Verdict&lt;/a&gt; lay siege to &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, most of the vrykul loyal to the Scourge had been either killed or wiped out entirely in Icecrown. With the Lich King's defeat atop the Frozen Throne, some of the last remaining Val'kyr pledged themselves to &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; afterward, becoming part of the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, a group of vrykul became elite &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20dragonflight\"&gt;twilight drake&lt;/a&gt; riders who served as &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;'s personal guard, under the command of the tauren &lt;a href=\"Warmaster%20Blackhorn\"&gt;Warmaster Blackhorn&lt;/a&gt;. They fought against the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; forces during the aerial battle in the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt;.\nMists of Pandaria.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lorewalker%20Cho\"&gt;Lorewalker Cho&lt;/a&gt; showed an &lt;a href=\"Undead%20%28playable%29\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; their ancestors, and two vrykul appeared as the character's furthest ancestors, confirming humanity's evolutionary lineage.\n&lt;a href=\"Ruben%20Holen%20%28NPC%29\"&gt;Ruben Holen&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Two%20Moons\"&gt;Shrine of Two Moons&lt;/a&gt; mentioned the &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; having books about the vrykul, but he didn't know how they could possibly have encountered them.\nLegion.\nThe vrykul of &lt;a href=\"Stormheim\"&gt;Stormheim&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt; were ruled by a king until recently, when the day his son, &lt;a href=\"God-King%20Skovald\"&gt;Jarl Skovald&lt;/a&gt;, murdered him with the assistance of his brothers &lt;a href=\"Voldgar\"&gt;Voldgar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Agnol\"&gt;Agnol&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Uldgar\"&gt;Uldgar&lt;/a&gt;. The brothers then turned on each other, with Skovald's blade proving to be the fastest. He then fought his mother at &lt;a href=\"Kingsfall%20Pass\"&gt;Kingsfall Pass&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Bretta\"&gt;Queen Bretta&lt;/a&gt;, and proclaimed himself king.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, approached &lt;a href=\"God-King%20Skovald\"&gt;God-King Skovald&lt;/a&gt; with a simple proposition, join the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; and receive ultimate power, or be destroyed. Dreaming of conquest and glory, Skovald and his &lt;a href=\"Tideskorn\"&gt;Tideskorn&lt;/a&gt; vrykul allied themselves with the Burning Legion and sought to claim one of the &lt;a href=\"Pillars%20of%20Creation\"&gt;Pillars of Creation&lt;/a&gt; for their demonic masters. In his quest to gain access to the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Halls of Valor&lt;/a&gt;, Skovald perverted the ancient trials that open the &lt;a href=\"Gates%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Gates of Valor&lt;/a&gt;. During the Trial of Might, he shattered &lt;a href=\"Yotnar\"&gt;Yotnar&lt;/a&gt; instead of besting him and attempted to destroy &lt;a href=\"Aggramar%27s%20Vault\"&gt;Aggramar's Vault&lt;/a&gt; so that no one else could know the criteria for the other trials from the titan databases. In the Trial of Will, he opted to enslave the &lt;a href=\"Thorignir\"&gt;Thorignir&lt;/a&gt;. During the Trial of Valor, he used the &lt;a href=\"Bonespeakers\"&gt;Bonespeakers&lt;/a&gt; to attempt to enslave the souls of the ancient rulers of Stormheim, forcing them to give their blessing.\nMeanwhile, &lt;a href=\"Odyn\"&gt;Odyn&lt;/a&gt;, under the guise of Havi, guided an &lt;a href=\"class%20order\"&gt;order&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;champion&lt;/a&gt; in their quest to beat the trials and retrieve the Aegis before Skovald. While the &lt;a href=\"Felskorn\"&gt;Felskorn&lt;/a&gt; assaulted the Gates of Valor, both challengers met, but Skovald left the fight before there could be a victor. The order champions proceeded to beat Odyn's own challenges within the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Halls of Valor&lt;/a&gt; and earned the right to wield the Aegis of Aggramar. Skovald suddenly appeared, however, demanding that Odyn acknowledge his claim to the Aegis, a protest that Odyn said came too late. Skovald thus attempted to claim the Aegis by force but was killed, declaring in his final breath that all his plans had been brought to ruin.\nOther vrykul did not follow Skovald in his alliance with the Legion, instead, they remained loyal to &lt;a href=\"Odyn\"&gt;Odyn&lt;/a&gt;. These &lt;a href=\"Valarjar\"&gt;Valarjar&lt;/a&gt; vrykul mainly stood in &lt;a href=\"Valdisdall\"&gt;Valdisdall&lt;/a&gt;. An &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; who fought valiantly a &lt;a href=\"pit%20lord\"&gt;pit lord&lt;/a&gt; by Odyn alongside other vrykul who took up arms against the demons was uplifted by &lt;a href=\"Odyn\"&gt;Odyn&lt;/a&gt; and made Battlelord of the Valarjar armies.\nThe forgotten &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20the%20Old%20Kings\"&gt;Tomb of the Old Kings&lt;/a&gt; contained the remains of several great vrykul Kings. &lt;a href=\"Odyn\"&gt;Odyn&lt;/a&gt; sent his &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Battlelord&lt;/a&gt;, with the help of &lt;a href=\"Hruthnir\"&gt;Hruthnir&lt;/a&gt;, son of Magnar, to the tomb to reclaim the armament of the &lt;a href=\"Neltharion\"&gt;Black Wyrm&lt;/a&gt; from the hand of the King &lt;a href=\"Magnar%20Icebreaker\"&gt;Magnar Icebreaker&lt;/a&gt;. However, the tomb was deconsecrated by the &lt;a href=\"Pillik\"&gt;unholy magic&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, and the guardian didn't recognize Odyn's envoys. The Battlelord and Hruthnir fought the tortured spirits of Magnar and his &lt;a href=\"Icebreaker%20Tombguard\"&gt;soldiers&lt;/a&gt;. Vanquished, Magnar recognized his son and gave the &lt;a href=\"Scale%20of%20the%20Earth-Warder\"&gt;Scale of the Earth-Warder&lt;/a&gt; to the Battlelord to avenge his death in fighting &lt;a href=\"Helya\"&gt;Helya&lt;/a&gt;. Finally, the spirits of Magnar and his soldiers were sent to the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Halls of Valor&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Shield%20Hill\"&gt;Shield Hill&lt;/a&gt;, the spirit of &lt;a href=\"Gorvold%20Ironbrow\"&gt;Gorvold Ironbrow&lt;/a&gt; was called by the &lt;a href=\"Tahu%20Sagewind\"&gt;Tahu Sagewind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Orik%20Trueheart\"&gt;Orik Trueheart&lt;/a&gt; in order to find the place of a powerful artifact of the Light against the demons. The Gorvold's Story led the &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s group to the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20the%20Old%20Kings\"&gt;Tomb of the Old Kings&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Inna%20the%20Cryptstalker\"&gt;Inna the Cryptstalker&lt;/a&gt; tried to stop the despoilers to enter the tomb but she was killed by the paladins. In the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20the%20Truthguard\"&gt;Shrine of the Truthguard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Yrgrim%20the%20Truthseeker\"&gt;Yrgrim the Truthseeker&lt;/a&gt;, champion of &lt;a href=\"Tyr\"&gt;Tyr&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Runeshaper%20Griselda\"&gt;Runeshaper Griselda&lt;/a&gt; challenged the paladin's group and lost the battle. He accepted his defeat and gave &lt;a href=\"Truthguard\"&gt;Truthguard&lt;/a&gt; in order for the future &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;Highlord&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; to become the new champion of Tyr.\nLater, &lt;a href=\"Prustaga\"&gt;Prustaga&lt;/a&gt; helped the &lt;a href=\"Unseen%20Path\"&gt;Unseen Path&lt;/a&gt; to penetrate the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20the%20Old%20Kings\"&gt;Tomb of the Old Kings&lt;/a&gt; in order to find a &lt;a href=\"Titanstrike\"&gt;powerful artifact&lt;/a&gt; against the Legion. When they entered the tomb of &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Volund\"&gt;Warlord Volund&lt;/a&gt;, his spirit was awakened. Taking the intruders for thieves, he decided to defend his tomb. When his spirit had been vanished, &lt;a href=\"Prustaga\"&gt;Prustaga&lt;/a&gt; betrayed the &lt;a href=\"Unseen%20Path\"&gt;Unseen Path&lt;/a&gt; and took the &lt;a href=\"Titanstrike\"&gt;Titanstrike&lt;/a&gt;. Her next and last move was to lead her vrykul followers to the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Storms\"&gt;Temple of Storms&lt;/a&gt; in order to absorb the powers of the storm and the makers. Finally, she has been killed with several of her followers by an alliance between &lt;a href=\"Thorim\"&gt;Thorim&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Unseen%20Path\"&gt;Unseen Path&lt;/a&gt;.\nNext, several vrykul from &lt;a href=\"Valarjar\"&gt;Valarjar&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Thorim\"&gt;Thorim&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hymdall\"&gt;Hymdall&lt;/a&gt; and the Battlelord helped to the free &lt;a href=\"Hodir\"&gt;Hodir&lt;/a&gt;, who was trapped in &lt;a href=\"Felblaze%20Ingress\"&gt;Felblaze Ingress&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Ran%27zara\"&gt;Lady Ran'zara&lt;/a&gt; and her &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s.\n&lt;a href=\"Sigryn\"&gt;Sigryn&lt;/a&gt;, the heir of &lt;a href=\"God-King%20Skovald\"&gt;God-King Skovald&lt;/a&gt;, was prophesized by &lt;a href=\"Eyir\"&gt;Eyir&lt;/a&gt; long ago to unite the &lt;a href=\"Tideskorn\"&gt;Tideskorn&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Seeking to make right the damage done by her father, Sigryn decided to fulfill her destiny. Queen She defeated the leaders of the &lt;a href=\"Bonespeakers\"&gt;Bonespeakers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Drekirjar\"&gt;Drekirjar&lt;/a&gt; in single combat and forced them to acknowledge her claim. But when her brother &lt;a href=\"Torvald\"&gt;Torvald&lt;/a&gt;, whom she believed was long dead, revealed that the assassination of their family was orchestrated by &lt;a href=\"Odyn\"&gt;Odyn&lt;/a&gt; himself, which Eyir confirmed, Sigryn was consumed by anger. She let the &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; power in her blood consume her and headed to the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Halls of Valor&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to confront Odyn. Fortunately, an &lt;a href=\"class%20order\"&gt;order&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;champion&lt;/a&gt; was able to dissuade her before she faced Odyn, who would not have been kind to her. She apologized to Eyir for her rampage and sought her judgment. Despite her misgivings, Sigryn showed that she possessed the strength and willpower to overcome the fel, something no vrykul had done before. Eyir thus decided that, instead of being punished, she was to assume the burden of the crown and rule the Tideskorn as their God-Queen.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, after &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt; opened its port to non-&lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s for the first time in centuries, a group of vrykul traders arrived to sell their wares. &lt;a href=\"Enges\"&gt;Enges&lt;/a&gt;, a vrykul &lt;a href=\"%3AFjarnskaggl\"&gt;:Fjarnskaggl&lt;/a&gt; trader could also be found in &lt;a href=\"Boralus%20Harbor\"&gt;Boralus Harbor&lt;/a&gt;, though because of the herb's popularity among the nobles her stocks have run out.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Bloodwake\"&gt;Bloodwake&lt;/a&gt; clan vrykul from &lt;a href=\"Jorundall\"&gt;Jorundall&lt;/a&gt; island with their fleet in the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt; were after &lt;a href=\"%3Aazerite\"&gt;:azerite&lt;/a&gt; found on islands. They were led by the greatest raider to ever live &lt;a href=\"Jorun\"&gt;Jorun&lt;/a&gt;, the Bloodwake, who long ago left Stormheim to seek a life at sea living only to raid, but never in one place for long.\nExploring Azeroth.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;war against the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, the brothers &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard\"&gt;Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; visited &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; after many years and notably reported the activities of the vrykul on the frozen continent.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Howling%20Fjord\"&gt;Howling Fjord&lt;/a&gt;, the vrykul clans are keeping to themselves, the &lt;a href=\"Winterskorn%20clan\"&gt;Winterskorn&lt;/a&gt; vrykul mostly rebuilt &lt;a href=\"Skorn\"&gt;Skorn&lt;/a&gt;, while those of the &lt;a href=\"Dragonflayer%20clan\"&gt;Dragonflayer clan&lt;/a&gt; continue to regularly attack the walls of &lt;a href=\"Valgarde\"&gt;Valgarde&lt;/a&gt; due to its proximity to &lt;a href=\"Wyrmskull%20Village\"&gt;Wyrmskull Village&lt;/a&gt;. They also reported that the fortress &lt;a href=\"Gjalerhorn\"&gt;Gjalerhorn&lt;/a&gt; is still half-filled with slumbering vrykul, slowly being coaxed back to waking life by the vrykul &lt;a href=\"necrolord\"&gt;necrolord&lt;/a&gt;s.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Grizzly%20Hills\"&gt;Grizzly Hills&lt;/a&gt;, the vrykul of &lt;a href=\"Voldrune\"&gt;Voldrune&lt;/a&gt; have been fair quiet in recent days, &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; assumed it is due to the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; troops in &lt;a href=\"Conquest%20Hold\"&gt;Conquest Hold&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Sholazar%20Basin\"&gt;Sholazar Basin&lt;/a&gt;, they are still coming to the &lt;a href=\"Savage%20Thicket\"&gt;Savage Thicket&lt;/a&gt;, in order to capture wild &lt;a href=\"Proto-dragon\"&gt;Proto-dragon&lt;/a&gt;s to ride or when they need fresh blood amongst the ones they keep in their villages.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt;, the vrykul of &lt;a href=\"Jotunheim\"&gt;Jotunheim&lt;/a&gt; are still challenging each other in the pit of &lt;a href=\"Valhalas\"&gt;Valhalas&lt;/a&gt;, but they have no death god to serve, at least.\nCulture.\nThe vrykul use &lt;a href=\"proto-dragon\"&gt;proto-dragon&lt;/a&gt;s as mounts. It is said that they were the first to recognize their potential. Or maybe the second, &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;depending on how you look at it&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, the vrykul come to the &lt;a href=\"Savage%20Thicket\"&gt;Savage Thicket&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Sholazar%20Basin\"&gt;Sholazar Basin&lt;/a&gt;, in order to capture wild proto-drakes to ride or when they need fresh blood amongst the ones they keep in their villages.\nContrary to popular belief, vrykul drinking horns were not common drinking vessels. While most drank mead or ale from bowls or cups, only those of great prestige quaffed wine from elaborate horns. Indeed, even the passing of such a vessel to the vrykul in question was a matter of ceremony, usually performed by the highest-ranking female present along with formal declarations of rank and deed.\nIn vrykul culture, it is the woman of the household who keeps all the keys, often displaying them prominently to show her status.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Howling%20Fjord\"&gt;Howling Fjord&lt;/a&gt;, the height of &lt;a href=\"Utgarde%20Keep\"&gt;Utgarde Keep&lt;/a&gt; is like the social ladder for the vrykul: the higher on the food chain they are, the higher up in the keep they live.\nThe &lt;a href=\"frost%20vrykul\"&gt;frost vrykul&lt;/a&gt; believe that wearing a necklace of &lt;a href=\"polar%20bear\"&gt;polar bear&lt;/a&gt; claws will grant them otherworldly strength.\nThe vrykul assign nicknames based on accomplishments. Cleansing a &lt;a href=\"Drakkari\"&gt;Drakkari&lt;/a&gt; bloodline or decapitating &lt;a href=\"taunka\"&gt;taunka&lt;/a&gt; might garner the appellation of \"dutiful\" but it takes a true act of depravity to be called \"&lt;a href=\"Skadi%20the%20Ruthless\"&gt;ruthless&lt;/a&gt;\".\nIt's a vrykul tradition to make unlikely partners work together. Some say it's to allow divergent abilities to complement each other; others say it's for the amusement of &lt;a href=\"King%20Ymiron\"&gt;King Ymiron&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere's an old vrykul saying that goes, \"Let sleeping &lt;a href=\"worg\"&gt;worg&lt;/a&gt;s lie, unless you don't want your face anymore.\"\nThe &lt;a href=\"Jotunheim%20vrykul\"&gt;Jotunheim vrykul&lt;/a&gt; were the first to be reawakened, and as such &lt;a href=\"Jotunheim\"&gt;Jotunheim&lt;/a&gt; is of significant importance to the vrykul race, second only to &lt;a href=\"Ymirheim\"&gt;Ymirheim&lt;/a&gt;.\nVrykul see manual labor as beneath them, and as such they use mindless undead to dig a tunnel from &lt;a href=\"Utgarde%20Keep\"&gt;Utgarde Keep&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Gjalerbron\"&gt;Gjalerbron&lt;/a&gt;. They also use slaves in the &lt;a href=\"Saronite%20Mines\"&gt;Saronite Mines&lt;/a&gt;, but forging seems to be seen as a worthy pursuit, as there are many vrykul blacksmiths in Utgarde. &lt;a href=\"Vargul\"&gt;Vargul&lt;/a&gt; possess enough of their minds to be used for labor, but are not pleased to do it.\nDeath.\nMuch of Stormheim vrykul society is shaped by their devotion to &lt;a href=\"Odyn\"&gt;Odyn&lt;/a&gt;, and their relationship to death is no different. Vrykuls are raised not to fear death and to live the life of a warrior so as to join the ranks of his formidable &lt;a href=\"Valarjar\"&gt;Valarjar&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Halls of Valor&lt;/a&gt; in the afterlife. The bodies of the honored dead are then taken care of by the &lt;a href=\"Bonespeakers\"&gt;Bonespeakers&lt;/a&gt;, a group of vrykul mystics. They are responsible for &lt;a href=\"Funerary%20practices\"&gt;burying&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20the%20Old%20Kings\"&gt;kings&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"thane\"&gt;thane&lt;/a&gt;s and many others so they can be judged, although it is unknown if they kept their functions following their &lt;a href=\"heresy\"&gt;heretical&lt;/a&gt; actions during the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nVrykul who want to be judged by their ancestors can organize a ritual of wakening to conjure up their spirit. To complete this ritual it is required to bring an aromatic to burn and an offering to present. As it is believed that the afterlife leaves the dead hungry for the delicacies of their former lives, a feast such as a &lt;a href=\"Bjornharta\"&gt;Bjornharta&lt;/a&gt; makes for a suitable offering.\n&lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; vrykul use burial mounds.\nTechnology and armaments.\nThe vrykul craft their homes and armaments from wood, stone, metal and whatever else they can gather from their surroundings. Animal motifs are known to be used on vrykul tools, weapons and armor, such as a &lt;a href=\"Flint%20Striker\"&gt;flint striker&lt;/a&gt; with a rod carved like a dragon's head, with the flat blade of metal fashioned to look like a stylized fish. They also use proto-dragon fangs for tools, such as &lt;a href=\"Fanged%20Cloak%20Pin\"&gt;cloak pins&lt;/a&gt;. Vrykul technology, however, is slightly behind that of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. They use &lt;a href=\"harpoon%20gun\"&gt;harpoon gun&lt;/a&gt;s.\nMany of the axes forged by the vrykul display an unusual style: the bottom edge of the axe blade extends down below the width of the butt. This style increases cutting area while minimizing weight; it can be used on both weapon and tools. Some &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarven&lt;/a&gt; axes show a similar construction.\n&lt;a href=\"%3AScramseax\"&gt;:Scramseax&lt;/a&gt; are large, straight knives with a single edge and a simple hilt worn by many vrykul warriors as a sidearm. One common fighting style among warriors involves an axe in the main hand and the scramseax in the offhand.\nVrykul appear to use &lt;a href=\"shoveltusk\"&gt;shoveltusk&lt;/a&gt; bones for weapons and armor, as can be seen in the &lt;a href=\"Shaman\"&gt;Shaman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tier%2010\"&gt;Tier 10&lt;/a&gt; armor set (&lt;a href=\"Frost%20Witch%27s%20Garb\"&gt;Frost Witch's Garb&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"Twin%27s%20Pact\"&gt;Twin's Pact&lt;/a&gt;. This can also be seen in concept art for a female vrykul warrior.\nMagic.\nWhile Northrend's vrykul naturally know little magic, some have been trained in &lt;a href=\"necromancy\"&gt;necromancy&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;. A few of &lt;a href=\"Ingvar%20the%20Plunderer\"&gt;Ingvar's&lt;/a&gt; raiders also learned to master the arcane arts. Most vrykul magic seems to draw from mysterious runes that even the most experienced &lt;a href=\"magi\"&gt;magi&lt;/a&gt; find unfamiliar. These rune-casters are among the deadliest of all the vrykul, possessing the power to freeze their foes in solid ice and shatter them into a thousand jagged shards. The &lt;a href=\"mystic%20vrykul\"&gt;mystic vrykul&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Stormheim\"&gt;Stormheim&lt;/a&gt; are masters of this &lt;a href=\"rune%20magic\"&gt;rune magic&lt;/a&gt;. Many are known to infuse their tattoos with ancient magic and, culturally, hold their inkbinders in very high regard.\nAppearance.\nVrykul appear as very large and muscular humans. Their infants, unlike human infants, apparently are able to stand on their own not long after birth. The males are usually, but not always, bearded; indeed, some vrykul skeletons retain their facial hair long after their flesh has rotted away, as evidenced by the &lt;a href=\"Risen%20Vrykul%20Ancestor\"&gt;Risen Vrykul Ancestor&lt;/a&gt;s at the ancient burial ground known as &lt;a href=\"Shield%20Hill\"&gt;Shield Hill&lt;/a&gt;. Many males also have intricate tattoos on their arms and torso.\n&lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; (who had never seen one in person) described them in the following way: \"They looked like humans\u2014if humans were larger than &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; and sometimes had skin that was &lt;a href=\"frost%20vrykul\"&gt;covered in ice&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"iron%20vrykul\"&gt;made of metal&lt;/a&gt; or stone.\"\nNote that this is the only known official mention of \"stone vrykul\" that some players assume to have existed at some point. Interestingly, Cairne implies that they have already been seen. He may mean that iron vrykul have some stone parts, though it is possible that this was meant to be confirmation that there were stone vrykul. reveals that the original vrykul were iron, not stone like the other titan races.\nBoth men and women have deep voices."}

Tobias remained with Darius at &lt;a href=\"Tal%27doren\"&gt;Tal'doren&lt;/a&gt; for a time. When the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; stole the &lt;a href=\"Scythe%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Scythe of Elune&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Woods%27%20End%20Cabin\"&gt;Woods' End Cabin&lt;/a&gt;, he helped to recover it by leading an attack against the Dark Rangers as a diversion.\nTobias later participated in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Gilneas\"&gt;Battle for Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;. After &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; killed &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Liam%20Greymane\"&gt;Prince Liam Greymane&lt;/a&gt;, he tracked down Sylvanas to Light's Dawn Cathedral, where he witnessed the conversation between Sylvanas, &lt;a href=\"General%20Warhowl\"&gt;General Warhowl&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"High%20Executor%20Crenshaw\"&gt;High Executor Crenshaw&lt;/a&gt;, learning that they planned to deploy the plague on &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20City\"&gt;Gilneas City&lt;/a&gt;.

The breakthrough appeared when &lt;a href=\"Clerk%20Daltry\"&gt;Clerk Daltry&lt;/a&gt; - who had aided in the original investigation of Stalvan's whereabouts - directed adventurers to the portions of Stalvan's journal, which had been taken and shredded by feral worgen during an attack on Darkshire's town hall. Tobias sought to find out the truth of what happened, and turned to &lt;a href=\"Madame%20Eva\"&gt;Madame Eva&lt;/a&gt;, who had begun the hunt for Stalvan years before. Using the &lt;a href=\"Mistmantle%20Family%20Ring\"&gt;Mistmantle Family Ring&lt;/a&gt; carried by Tobias (Stalvan had dropped a similar ring as proof of death in the original quest), Madame Eva directed adventurers back to &lt;a href=\"Manor%20Mistmantle\"&gt;Manor Mistmantle&lt;/a&gt;, where Stalvan rose from his grave seeking revenge, and had to be destroyed again.\nDragonflight.\nTobias can be seen fishing in his worgen form, right beside the main building in Belanaar, &lt;a href=\"Amirdrassil\"&gt;Amirdrassil&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuests.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20City%20%28starting%20zone%29\"&gt;Gilneas City&lt;/a&gt;:\nIn &lt;a href=\"Duskwood\"&gt;Duskwood&lt;/a&gt;:\nQuotes.\nNot a bad place here, if you aren't into the whole \"sunshine\" thing.\nSpeculation.\nIt is known from a letter that his brother &lt;a href=\"Stalvan%20Mistmantle\"&gt;Stalvan Mistmantle&lt;/a&gt; spent time in &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt;.

Toki represents the \"Time-Tinker\" class in the single-player experience.\nBackground.\nTwo conflicting reports about Toki have recently come to light. One describes a powerful young mage who posses an uncanny talent for time magic, who, unusually, often channels her power through arcane devices of her own invention rather than casting spells. Her unflappable determination and willingness to take inconceivable risks makes her a dangerously effective hunter who is somehow always exactly where she needs to be at the exact right moment, and chance events tend to go her way far more often than they should. Unfortunately, Toki's extreme talent is paired with a blithe disregard for the consequences her magics might cause to the fabric of time. She displays a similar cheerful apathy toward &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20peninsula\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; and the curse of the Witchwood, appearing solely interested in stopping &lt;a href=\"Hagatha%20the%20Witch\"&gt;Hagatha the Witch&lt;/a&gt; from affecting an event in her own future.\nThe other report describes a fiendishly powerful, scarred, and grizzled &lt;a href=\"archmage\"&gt;archmage&lt;/a&gt; with an incredible innate control over time magic. There have been frequent sightings of in Gilneas of late, though only for moments at a time. Witnesses have noted that her form flickers in and out of existence, as if she can't maintain her presence in this timeline for long, and they describe her as seemingly being haunted, crazed, or obsessed. Bizarrely, she has been showing citizens pictures of herself and asking them if they have \"seen this gnome\". She displays a grim disregard for Gilneas and the curse of the Witchwood, appearing solely interested in someone in this city from affecting an event in her own future.\nBoth of these reports arrived at exactly the same time, and the agent who delivered them disavowed any knowledge of writing either report."}

They possess feline lower bodies and heads, as well as human torsos, and are divided into three distinct &lt;a href=\"tribe\"&gt;tribe&lt;/a&gt;s: the &lt;a href=\"Ramkahen%20tribe\"&gt;Ramkahen&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Neferset%20tribe\"&gt;Neferset&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Orsis%20tribe\"&gt;Orsis&lt;/a&gt;. Like many other &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt;, the tol'vir succumbed to the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Flesh\"&gt;Curse of Flesh&lt;/a&gt;, though the Neferset later regained their stone forms due to a pact with &lt;a href=\"Siamat\"&gt;Siamat&lt;/a&gt;. There was once another society of tol'vir in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, but they were overthrown by the &lt;a href=\"Nerubian\"&gt;Nerubian&lt;/a&gt;s and transformed into &lt;a href=\"obsidian%20destroyer\"&gt;obsidian destroyer&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe tol'vir made their first named appearance with \"\", when &lt;a href=\"Uldum\"&gt;Uldum&lt;/a&gt; was expanded into a zone of its own. However, they appeared years earlier as the obsidian destroyers, though the connection between them was not made clear until \"Cataclysm\".\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nLike most other &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt;, the tol'vir were created using the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Wills\"&gt;Forge of Wills&lt;/a&gt; during the ordering of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Like the &lt;a href=\"anubisath\"&gt;anubisath&lt;/a&gt;s and the &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt;, many tol'vir accompanied &lt;a href=\"Ra\"&gt;Highkeeper Ra&lt;/a&gt; when he traveled south from &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt; to install the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Origination\"&gt;Forge of Origination&lt;/a&gt; in the jungles of &lt;a href=\"Uldum\"&gt;Uldum&lt;/a&gt;, far to the south. After the Forge had been embedded in the land, Ra assigned the tol'vir and anubisaths to watch over the area as he and the rest of his followers continued west to establish the fortress of &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt;. When Ra vanished many years later, most of the tol'vir congregated around Uldum and began developing their own culture, completely separate from that of their northern brethren. When the agents of the treacherous &lt;a href=\"Loken\"&gt;Loken&lt;/a&gt; traveled south in search of Ra, they unwittingly afflicted the tol'vir with the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Flesh\"&gt;Curse of Flesh&lt;/a&gt;.\nObsidian destroyers.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Drakkari%20tribe\"&gt;Drakkari tribe&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s moved north to hunt down northern &lt;a href=\"aqir\"&gt;aqir&lt;/a&gt;i colonies during the war between the trolls and the aqir, they encountered something unexpected: enslaved tol'vir. These \"&lt;a href=\"obsidian%20destroyer\"&gt;obsidian destroyer&lt;/a&gt;s\", as they were called, had been dwelling outside of &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt; until the aqir arrived and enslaved them. Despite their ferocious strength, the Drakkari were able to topple the destroyers and their aqiri masters. The northern aqir who survived the war would later evolve into a new race, known as the &lt;a href=\"nerubian\"&gt;nerubian&lt;/a&gt;s, and began adapting the tol'vir's architecture for their own purposes. Although the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; would eventually consume the &lt;a href=\"nerubian%20empire\"&gt;nerubian empire&lt;/a&gt; and throw its few remaining tol'vir slaves into the front lines, it's possible that more tol'vir still exist in the hidden titan city of Uldum or deep within the remnants of &lt;a href=\"Azjol-Nerub\"&gt;Azjol-Nerub&lt;/a&gt;.\nLei Shen and the scouring of Uldum.\nMillennia later, the tol'vir of Uldum continued trying to endure the ravages of the Curse of Flesh, patiently waiting for instructions from Ra or his &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; followers in the east. Eventually, they received word from a mogu leader known as &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen\"&gt;Lei Shen&lt;/a&gt;, the \"Thunder King\", and in response, they dispatched ambassadors to the east. Lei Shen showed the tol'vir the wonders of his &lt;a href=\"mogu%20empire\"&gt;new empire&lt;/a&gt;, the rise of which had gone unbeknownst to the western titan-forged. When the mogu announced that he had defeated Ra in battle and that he intended to claim the Forge of Origination for himself, the tol'vir became furious. Refusing the Thunder King's offer of a place of honor in his empire in return for their service, the tol'vir returned to Uldum. Confident that his armies would be able to claim the stronghold with ease, Lei Shen marched west, even inviting many of his &lt;a href=\"Zandalar%20tribe\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; allies to join him in his impending victory. However, the tol'vir, knowing that they would not be able to face the mogu head-on, prepared a daring plan: to use the Forge of Origination against the Thunder King. When the mogu reached Uldum, the tol'vir activated the weapon, having configured it to only scour the surrounding region. The energies of the Forge instantly killed all life in the region \u2014 including a small number of tol'vir defenders who had remained outside the stronghold to act as a distraction \u2014 and turned the lush jungle into a barren desert. The tol'vir thereafter used magic to seal off the mountain passes leading into the region in order to ensure that no one would ever attempt to follow in the Thunder King's footsteps.\nKings and emperors.\nThe tol'vir appear to have a long and storied history of various pharaohs, kings, and emperors ruling over the tribes. \"Sun King\" or \"sun-king\" is a title mentioned at various places throughout Uldum (for example, &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20the%20Sun%20King\"&gt;Tomb of the Sun King&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Seal%20of%20the%20Sun%20King\"&gt;Seal of the Sun King&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thieving%20Little%20Pluckers\"&gt;Thieving Little Pluckers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Relics%20of%20the%20Sun%20King\"&gt;Relics of the Sun King&lt;/a&gt;). It is unknown what meaning this title carries or carried. The \"Tahret dynasty\" is so far the only known tol'vir dynasty.\nIn the reign of &lt;a href=\"Pharaoh%20Tebhotep\"&gt;Pharaoh Tebhotep&lt;/a&gt;, a plague of &lt;a href=\"serpent\"&gt;serpent&lt;/a&gt;s struck the &lt;a href=\"Vir%27naal%20River\"&gt;Vir'naal River&lt;/a&gt;. Nothing could drive away the reptiles. Then, a second plague appeared, this one of desert &lt;a href=\"scarab\"&gt;scarab&lt;/a&gt;s. The scarabs fought the serpents until not a one of either creature was left and peace returned to the land.\n&lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Ninjter\"&gt;Emperor Ninjter&lt;/a&gt; was foretold to have a long and prosperous rule. The &lt;a href=\"Ramkahen%20tribe\"&gt;Ramkahen&lt;/a&gt; expected greatness from his reign and hoped that he would be able to end a famine that had apparently been plaguing the tribe, but ultimately Ninjter died young and accomplished little during his reign.\nUnearthed recently in an ancient tomb, the &lt;a href=\"Winged%20Guardian\"&gt;Winged Guardian&lt;/a&gt; may have once served one of the ancient tol'vir princes.\nThe weaponsmith &lt;a href=\"Irmaat\"&gt;Irmaat&lt;/a&gt;, who worked tirelessly to arm his fellow tol'vir with fine instruments, is known to all tol'vir as one of the greatest minds to ever live in Uldum. Once, he bound four powerful &lt;a href=\"djinn\"&gt;djinn&lt;/a&gt; lords from &lt;a href=\"Skywall\"&gt;Skywall&lt;/a&gt; within a set of scimitars. The weapons became highly coveted among tol'vir warriors, and messengers came from other tol'vir outposts to beg Irmaat for more wonders. Next, the weaponsmith crafted &lt;a href=\"Fists%20of%20the%20Heavens\"&gt;a pair of fist weapons&lt;/a&gt; and intended them to hold the power of the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Lord\"&gt;Elemental Lord&lt;/a&gt; of air, &lt;a href=\"Al%27Akir\"&gt;Al'Akir&lt;/a&gt; himself. However, Al'Akir set a trap for the weaponsmith: when Irmaat tried to heft his new weapons, they unleashed a great hurricane which destroyed both Irmaat and the city of &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Ahmtul\"&gt;Ahmtul&lt;/a&gt; and hurled the weapons miles away. Those who tried to recover the fists were similarly destroyed by their immense power, and the tol'vir decided to bury the weapons in the desert to prevent anyone from repeating the weaponsmith's folly.\nA legend among the tol'vir tells of a wicked djinn whom the Ramkahen sought to destroy. In an attempt to prevent his own death, the djinn tried to transfer his spirit into the body of a monkey. He was slain right in the middle of the transference, and only a fraction of his essence had moved over - only enough to possess the monkey's &lt;a href=\"Crawling%20Claw\"&gt;paw&lt;/a&gt;.\nCivil war.\nWhen the tol'vir were afflicted by the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Flesh\"&gt;Curse of Flesh&lt;/a&gt;, they grieved for their weakened bodies, but there seemed to be nothing they could do to reverse it, so they accepted it and went on with their lives. Even so, many never stopped mourning the loss. As during the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; returned to the world, he aligned himself with Al'Akir as well as the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s, who were the source of the curse. When Deathwing came to Uldum, he offered the tol'vir a deal: join him, and he would return their original stone forms to them - the curse would be reversed. The &lt;a href=\"Neferset\"&gt;Neferset&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Pharaoh%20Tekahn\"&gt;Dark Pharaoh Tekahn&lt;/a&gt;, overwhelmingly agreed to the bargain. &lt;a href=\"Menrim\"&gt;Menrim&lt;/a&gt;, one of the Neferset, felt differently and tried to convince other Neferset that it was a poor idea they would forever be indebted to Al'Akir and Deathwing. Neferset, however, were arrogant, believing they could overthrow them and regain their independence once their old forms had been restored. When the tol'vir of &lt;a href=\"Orsis\"&gt;Orsis&lt;/a&gt; refused, Al'Akir buried the city beneath the sands in a great windstorm. The Ramkahen were also given the same choice but refused; they, however, have taken steps to ensure their safety after seeing the aftermath of the attack on Orsis.\nWar aftermath.\nWith the help of valiant adventurers from both Horde and the Alliance, the Ramkahen has managed to take &lt;a href=\"Neferset%20City\"&gt;Neferset City&lt;/a&gt; and push the Neferset tribe back. The Ramkahen now control most of the tol'vir settlements in Uldum, while the Neferset still hold the southern part of the delta and their stronghold in the &lt;a href=\"Lost%20City%20of%20the%20Tol%27vir\"&gt;Lost City&lt;/a&gt;. More Neferset can be seen in the &lt;a href=\"Vortex%20Pinnacle\"&gt;Vortex Pinnacle&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\n&lt;a href=\"Li%20Li%20Stormstout\"&gt;Li Li Stormstout&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"monk\"&gt;monk&lt;/a&gt; adventurer visit Ramkahen while searching for the &lt;a href=\"Fists%20of%20the%20Heavens\"&gt;Fists of the Heavens&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Gharset%20the%20Aimtrue\"&gt;Gharset the Aimtrue&lt;/a&gt; is present at the &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"class%20hall\"&gt;class hall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Trueshot%20Lodge\"&gt;Trueshot Lodge&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt; opened its port to non-&lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s for the first time in centuries, a group of tol'vir traders arrived to sell their wares. By this time the &lt;a href=\"Lost%20City%20of%20the%20Tol%27vir\"&gt;Lost City of the Tol'vir&lt;/a&gt; had also been occupied by the Ramkahen.\n&lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; striking &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; with his sword unearthed new tombs, and from one the &lt;a href=\"Amathet\"&gt;Amathet&lt;/a&gt; emerged. They speak little to other tol'vir, believing them to be betrayers of their sacred duties. They believe that they, stewards of the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s, should alone control the &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt;. When they realized that &lt;a href=\"Rajh\"&gt;Rajh&lt;/a&gt; and his kin were slain, they constructed their own &lt;a href=\"Uldum%20watcher\"&gt;new keepers&lt;/a&gt;, which means they must have an active forge like the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Wills\"&gt;Forge of Wills&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Origination\"&gt;Forge of Origination&lt;/a&gt;. It was later revealed that the Forge they had was in fact the Forge of Origination - the Amathet began to assault the Halls of Origination and surrounding areas of Uldum in order to reoriginate the planet and free it from the Old Gods, bringing them in conflict with the Ramkahen as reorigination would also kill everyone else. The Ramkahen formed the &lt;a href=\"Uldum%20Accord\"&gt;Uldum Accord&lt;/a&gt; by allying with the &lt;a href=\"Explorers%27%20League\"&gt;Explorers' League&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wastewander\"&gt;Wastewander&lt;/a&gt; bandits. They defended Uldum and the Halls of Origination from both &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;'s forces and the Amathet.\nN'Zoth's forces also constructed new &lt;a href=\"obsidian%20destroyer\"&gt;obsidian destroyer&lt;/a&gt;s, and awakened and corrupted dormant ones. They also reanimated the dead Neferset with the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiology.\nThe tol'vir have humanoid upper torsos with a more leonine bottom half. Their faces are also very leonine, with sleek features and sharp fangs. Thick fur of various shading covers their body, with some tol'vir resembling &lt;a href=\"tiger\"&gt;tiger&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"jaguar\"&gt;jaguar&lt;/a&gt;s, others having an appearance closer to that of &lt;a href=\"lion\"&gt;lion&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"panther\"&gt;panther&lt;/a&gt;s.\nTol'vir children are referred to as cubs.\nBefore being afflicted with the Curse of Flesh, the tol'vir had stone bodies and gems encrusted in certain areas. Some Neferset tol'vir were gifted with stone wings.\nCulture.\nSociety.\nIn ancient times, the tol'vir were charged with guarding and keeping the structures and artifacts of the benevolent &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s. All the combat protocols that the titans programmed into the tol'vir ancestors are still there, though some are part of their instincts, some get passed on as traditions. To this day, the tol'vir keep this charge, but have also established their own cultures and cities in the process. Tol'vir buildings are made of stone and mud, shaped into bricks and placed into cube-like structures. While simple, they are effective at blocking out the harsh sun on the Uldum desert, or cutting out the unforgiving winds.\nAlthough the systems keeping Uldum hidden from the rest of the world worked flawlessly from the ordering of Azeroth up until the Cataclysm, the tol'vir inside did have some knowledge of what was going on outside their home: many of the titans' security devices in Uldum were in communication with the other titanic cities (Ulduar, Uldaman, etc.). The Halls of Origination were actually the system that &lt;a href=\"Algalon%20the%20Observer\"&gt;Algalon the Observer&lt;/a&gt; intended to activate upon his arrival in Ulduar.\nThe tol'vir tribes are led by kings and live in what appears to be a monarch system of government. When the king passes on, the oldest living heir will take its place, and so on. Higher ranking members of tol'vir society, such as generals, kings, and high priests, wear headpieces that are shaped like rams or birds. It is known that the tol'vir revere the Titans and their guardians, so these may be shaped in honor of the titan guardians.\nThe tol'vir have many sacred areas around Uldum. While the prime religion and beliefs of these creatures are not known at this time (see speculation), it is clear that it is of importance to the Tol'vir, as High priests of the tribes are held in high standing. The Sun Priests, wielders of solar magic, are an ancient order who have walked among all tol'vir tribes. The tol'vir do have gods, which would presumably be either the titans or the watchers inside the Halls of Origination (&lt;a href=\"Rajh\"&gt;Rajh&lt;/a&gt; and company). Statues of the watchers are a common sight across Uldum.\nTol'vir &lt;a href=\"mummy\"&gt;mummify&lt;/a&gt; their dead.\nLanguage.\nThe tol'vir appear to have &lt;a href=\"Tol%27vir%20%28language%29\"&gt;their own language&lt;/a&gt;, but they can also interact with both Horde and Alliance adventurers, perhaps through &lt;a href=\"Common%20%28language%29\"&gt;Common&lt;/a&gt;. It is also not outside the realm of possibility that they speak &lt;a href=\"Titan%20%28language%29\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt;, the language of their creators.\nTribes.\nThree tribes exist in the present day named after the cities they live in: &lt;a href=\"Ramkahen%20tribe\"&gt;Ramkahen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Orsis%20tribe\"&gt;Orsis&lt;/a&gt; (nearly wiped out by &lt;a href=\"Al%27Akir\"&gt;Al'Akir&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"Neferset%20tribe\"&gt;Neferset&lt;/a&gt;. The latter tribe has allied with &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; in order to regain the tol'vir's stone form. After &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; struck the planet, a fourth tribe known as the &lt;a href=\"Amathet\"&gt;Amathet&lt;/a&gt; emerged, having been sleeping in underground tombs for thousands of years. The Amathet are comprised entirely of stone tol'vir, presumably having slept through the effects of the Curse of Flesh.\nIn Hearthstone.\nTol'vir first appeared in \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\" with the \" adventure, which features a tol'vir boss by the name of and the Warrior card .\nThe \" expansion features a group of stone-skinned tol'vir who wandered from Uldum into the nearby region of &lt;a href=\"Un%27Goro%20Crater\"&gt;Un'Goro Crater&lt;/a&gt; and made a home for themselves there, including the legendary &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt; card . Blizzard also originally planned to introduce a new race of crocodile-like reptilian humanoids, with the reasoning that while the &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; created the &lt;a href=\"saurok\"&gt;saurok&lt;/a&gt; to combat humanoids such as the &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt;, the tol'vir would have had to create a bulkier version to combat the &lt;a href=\"dinosaur\"&gt;dinosaur&lt;/a&gt;s of Un'Goro. However, Blizzard eventually decided to simply use the pre-existing saurok instead. Notably, the &lt;a href=\"Un%27Goro%20Madness\"&gt;Un'Goro Madness&lt;/a&gt; micro-holiday in \"World of Warcraft\" features a lone stone-skinned tol'vir by the name of &lt;a href=\"Sunkeeper%20Croesus\"&gt;Sunkeeper Croesus&lt;/a&gt;, who shares his title with the aforementioned Tarim.\nA large number of tol'vir are featured in the \"\" expansion.\nSpeculation.\nPossible religions.\nThe Light.\nSome of the tol'vir use Light-based abilities, and call forth the powers of Light: &lt;a href=\"High%20Prophet%20Barim\"&gt;High Prophet Barim&lt;/a&gt; summons forth the powers of Heaven's Fury and Repentance, while &lt;a href=\"Temple%20Guardian%20Anhuur\"&gt;Temple Guardian Anhuur&lt;/a&gt; varies from Searing Light to Divine Reckoning. The &lt;a href=\"Dungeon%20Journal\"&gt;Dungeon Journal&lt;/a&gt; clarifies that these two do utilize the powers of the light, but the description of the latter makes it clear the creature had to be specifically empowered to utilize these powers, making it unlikely to be available to the majority of the tol'vir.\nThe sun.\nTol'vir priests are referred to as sun priests, which could indicate some sort of connection with the sun. Indeed, the sun is often referred in locations throughout Uldum (&lt;a href=\"Seal%20of%20the%20Sun%20King\"&gt;Seal of the Sun King&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Obelisk%20of%20the%20Sun\"&gt;Obelisk of the Sun&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20the%20Sun%20King\"&gt;Tomb of the Sun King&lt;/a&gt;) and there is &lt;a href=\"Nahom\"&gt;a temple&lt;/a&gt; that is explicitly powered by the sun. In addition, statues of Rahj, the &lt;a href=\"Watcher%20%28titanic%29\"&gt;Watcher&lt;/a&gt; of the sun, are a common sight throughout &lt;a href=\"Uldum\"&gt;Uldum&lt;/a&gt;. However, many of these locations were constructed (and presumably named) by the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s, so it might not be indicative of the tol'vir religion. The Sun Priests, which according to &lt;a href=\"Blind%20Leading%20the%20Blind\"&gt;Blind Leading the Blind&lt;/a&gt; are found in all tol'vir tribes, wield solar magic. One of &lt;a href=\"High%20Priest%20Amet\"&gt;High Priest Amet&lt;/a&gt;'s goodbye quotes is \"Have faith in the sun.\" The &lt;a href=\"Amathet\"&gt;Amathet&lt;/a&gt; also make heavy use of solar magic.\nImmortality.\nAs revealed in the Dungeon Journal, &lt;a href=\"General%20Husam\"&gt;General Husam&lt;/a&gt; was assigned his duties personally from the titans. Despite being exposed to the curse of flesh, he remained relatively ageless and even lived to see the curse lifted. It could be that, despite being cursed, the tol'vir maintained their immortality. On the other hand, many quests refer to tol'vir ancestors and legends of the past, such as &lt;a href=\"The%20Secret%20of%20Nahom\"&gt;The Secret of Nahom&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Element%20of%20Supplies\"&gt;The Element of Supplies&lt;/a&gt;."}

Prior to the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, Tol Barad was considered a territory of &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, the island was a strategic staging area for &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; forces, from which they struck on the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;-controlled city of &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Modr\"&gt;Dun Modr&lt;/a&gt; and took it back from the hands of their enemies. The &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s, viewing Tol Barad as an obstacle in their path to the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;, mounted a ferocious counterstrike on the island. Unprepared for such aggression, the Stromgarde soldiers were expelled from Tol Barad, and the citadel was razed, a charred symbol of the Horde's brutal victory. Most of the island's inhabitants were slaughtered, their home ravaged, and their remaining spirits crying out for vengeance. Despite this horrific happening, some of the original Stromic population still survived, but possibly as exiles since when &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"gryphon%20rider\"&gt;gryphon rider&lt;/a&gt; escort passed above the island they saw no life more complex than a few hardy weeds and insects.\nAftermath.\nFollowing the Second War, what remained of the blackened, derelict battlements was left to languish until the wizards of &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; claimed the isle for a new purpose. Towering walls were again stacked high from the war-scarred stones, but in their cleverness, the arcanists turned the citadel\u2019s defenses inward, designing a mystical prison to hold the most powerful criminals. A Stromic and Tirasian population of men formed the &lt;a href=\"Baradin%27s%20Wardens\"&gt;Baradin's Wardens&lt;/a&gt;: charged with ensuring that the deadly prisoners locked away in the mystic &lt;a href=\"Baradin%20Hold\"&gt;Baradin Hold&lt;/a&gt; never again walk free on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Even the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; imprisoned &lt;a href=\"Argaloth\"&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Occu%27thar\"&gt;powerful&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Alizabal\"&gt;demons&lt;/a&gt; in the repurposed stronghold.\nWhen Stromgarde started to suffer a series of catastrophes, the town of &lt;a href=\"Rustberg\"&gt;Rustberg&lt;/a&gt; was abandoned as its population was recalled home. This settlement later became the base of a group of pirates that struck the towns along the shores of &lt;a href=\"Baradin%20Bay\"&gt;Baradin Bay&lt;/a&gt;.\nBetween the events of the Second War and these pirates, endless naval battles happened surrounding Tol Barad.\nCataclysm.\nWith the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; shattering the world, Tol Barad once again became a battleground between the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. Warchief &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; sent the elite warriors known as the &lt;a href=\"Hellscream%27s%20Reach\"&gt;Hellscream's Reach&lt;/a&gt; to the island, &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Tol%20Barad\"&gt;charged with taking it from the humans&lt;/a&gt;. Defending it against them were the &lt;a href=\"Baradin%27s%20Wardens\"&gt;Baradin's Wardens&lt;/a&gt;, the army that originally guarded the prison. However, as the two forces fought for supremacy over the island, something sinister was taking over the prison fortress of &lt;a href=\"Baradin%20Hold\"&gt;Baradin Hold&lt;/a&gt; and the whole island in turn. With prison guards murdering each other or letting their charges free, insanity amongst Alliance soldiers, undead corpses rising from their graves, and spirits reliving their final battles.\nMists of Pandaria.\nBy the time of the discovery of &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, the Horde managed to score crucial victories off the coast of Tol Barad.\nLegion.\nDespite the Horde's victories off the coast, the Baradin's Wardens managed to eventually claim Baradin Hold and begin its restoration after adventurers cleared out the demons within the hold, but somehow, the demons took over it and it became lost to the inmates, with all its forces in retreat from the prison. &lt;a href=\"Warlock\"&gt;Warlock&lt;/a&gt;s under the employ of and the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt; arrived to wade through the ruins in order to find the whereabouts of the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Dalaran\"&gt;Eye of Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, which had been lost to the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; in years prior. Having resurfaced here by way of a &lt;a href=\"void%20terror\"&gt;void terror&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Occul%27tharon\"&gt;Occul'tharon&lt;/a&gt;, the warlocks defeated the demon and claimed the Eye; only to later be betrayed as one of the warlocks was in truth a member of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20the%20Black%20Harvest\"&gt;Council of the Black Harvest&lt;/a&gt; in disguise as &lt;a href=\"Jergosh%20the%20Invoker\"&gt;Jergosh the Invoker&lt;/a&gt;. It was noted by &lt;a href=\"Allaris%20Narassin\"&gt;Allaris Narassin&lt;/a&gt; that the Horde and Alliance had ceased fighting over the ruined prison by this time.\nPvP zone.\nAdded in \"\", Tol Barad is an outdoor &lt;a href=\"PvP%20zone\"&gt;PvP zone&lt;/a&gt;, very similar to &lt;a href=\"Wintergrasp\"&gt;Wintergrasp&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. However, the island is also similar to the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Isle of Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt; in that it is a major daily quest hub. Battling for control of the island are the &lt;a href=\"Baradin%27s%20Wardens\"&gt;Baradin's Wardens&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Hellscream%27s%20Reach\"&gt;Hellscream's Reach&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Whichever side controls the prison on Tol Barad gains access to more dailies and the dungeon instance of &lt;a href=\"Baradin%20Hold\"&gt;Baradin Hold&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn \"World of Warcraft\", Tol Barad consists of two zones:\nPlayers can enter Tol Barad by portals from &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; once they reach level 85 or by means of a mage portal, &lt;a href=\"Portal%20%28spell%29\"&gt;Portal: Tol Barad&lt;/a&gt;.\nPvP battle.\nAt the beginning of the battle, the faction that won the last one is set as \"defending\" while the other is \"attacking\". Defending players start on top of Baradin Hold (players can float down the central chains or off the edges), and attacking players start on the Blackstone Span. To win, the attacking force must capture all three buildings at the same time: &lt;a href=\"Ironclad%20Garrison\"&gt;Ironclad Garrison&lt;/a&gt; to the north, &lt;a href=\"Slagworks\"&gt;Slagworks&lt;/a&gt; to the southeast, and &lt;a href=\"Warden%27s%20Vigil\"&gt;Warden's Vigil&lt;/a&gt; to the southwest. The battle lasts for 15 minutes, but can be extended by 5 minutes for each of the towers the attacking force can destroy using the &lt;a href=\"Abandoned%20Siege%20Engine\"&gt;Abandoned Siege Engine&lt;/a&gt; which can be piloted by any attacker who has earned an honorable kill in the current battle. The defender's goal is primarily to prevent the attackers from capturing all 3 buildings, and secondarily to prevent the extension of the battle time by destroying the active Siege Engines.\nBuildings are captured by a simple presence mechanic - the faction with the higher number of players near a flag will move the capture meter in their favor over time, very much like &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20the%20Storm\"&gt;Eye of the Storm&lt;/a&gt;. The rate of capture based on presence is steady but is affected by two new mechanics. Each time a member of one faction is killed in the immediate vicinity of the flag, the capture meter is \"nudged\" in favor of the opposing faction.

One set of quests is always there, the other focuses on one of three cellblocks around the island.\nIn the RPG.\nTol Barad, the site of many historic battles in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, is an island part of the nation of &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; and is now home to a magic prison. &lt;a href=\"Wizard\"&gt;Wizard&lt;/a&gt;s from both &lt;a href=\"Dalaran%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; oversee the complex, and prisoners include enemy &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s, lesser and greater &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; war criminals. The wizards do not allow anyone near the island and keep the prison\u2019s existence a secret.\nAt some point, the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; attacked the prison and even though the wizards fought them off, &lt;a href=\"Zae%27Rathis%20the%20Mad\"&gt;Zae'Rathis the Mad&lt;/a&gt;, a dangerous blood elf evoker prisoner, escaped amid the confusion. Zae'Rathis is now at large and &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;' citizens are afraid. The wizards suspect that the naga attack was intended to free the blood elf and he may have joined them. Together they would make a powerful force so the wizards are in need of someone to track down Zae'Rathis and destroy him.\nThe &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Port\"&gt;Bilgewater Port&lt;/a&gt; sent the \"&lt;a href=\"Fearsome%20Yacht\"&gt;Fearsome Yacht&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"prison%20ship\"&gt;prison ship&lt;/a&gt; to Tol Barad in order to imprison there an &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href=\"Dak%27mal\"&gt;Dak'mal&lt;/a&gt; who had been causing trouble on &lt;a href=\"Kezan\"&gt;Kezan&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpeculation.\nThe strange, dark magic that has raised many of the inhabitants of the island's north, both recently killed and long dead, as various forms of undead is almost surely the same cause behind the insanity within the prison complex. It is possibly the result of the powerful demons held within Baradin Hold, but many of these creatures appear to have been let out by their own jailers, the deranged Wardens seen across Tol Barad, in league with at least some of their former prisoners. As such it could be feared that whatever &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;ancient horrors&lt;/a&gt; lurk beneath the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt; are behind the madness of all Tol Barad. Alternately, &lt;a href=\"Alizabal\"&gt;Alizabal&lt;/a&gt; and the other demons did do it.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

It is clear that the war will cost the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; dearly... Impressed with your victories against the Horde and the destruction of the &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Dare\"&gt;Zul'dare&lt;/a&gt; base, the &lt;a href=\"High%20Command\"&gt;High Command&lt;/a&gt; has decided to dispatch you and your troops to the main battleground. The forces of &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; are stationed along the northern border of &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;, fighting to keep the &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;s from advancing into southern &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. An Orcish outpost, nestled near the ruins of the ancient &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;Dwarven&lt;/a&gt; city of &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Modr\"&gt;Dun Modr&lt;/a&gt;, has repeatedly beaten back Alliance troops and ravaged the surrounding farmlands. You must reclaim the nearby island &lt;a href=\"Keep\"&gt;Keep&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Tol%20Barad\"&gt;Tol Barad&lt;/a&gt; and then launch an attack upon the outpost.\"\nBattle.\nBackground.\nAs &lt;a href=\"Milan\"&gt;Milan&lt;/a&gt;'s unit rushed to board the waiting &lt;a href=\"transport%20ship\"&gt;transport ship&lt;/a&gt;s, they could already see smoke rising from the nearby island. They sailed toward it, on the northeast side, and landed just in time to interrupt the demolition of a &lt;a href=\"barracks\"&gt;barracks&lt;/a&gt; there. Several of their number died in the attack, but they were able to slaughter the orcs and trolls before they could finish their foul deed. Once they were safely inside the camp, the grateful inhabitants were eager to follow their orders, and soon the barracks was repaired while they raised &lt;a href=\"cannon%20tower\"&gt;cannon tower&lt;/a&gt;s behind it to prevent further destruction. With all the structures intact, they then built more &lt;a href=\"Farm\"&gt;farms&lt;/a&gt; and trained workers to speed their efforts. On the western shore of the island they began a &lt;a href=\"shipyard\"&gt;shipyard&lt;/a&gt;, while the &lt;a href=\"oil%20tanker\"&gt;oil tanker&lt;/a&gt; that accompanied them found an &lt;a href=\"Oil%20Patch\"&gt;oil patch&lt;/a&gt; a short distance further west and proceeded to build a &lt;a href=\"Oil%20platform\"&gt;platform&lt;/a&gt; over it. They were soon ready to begin building ballistae for their lightning strike on the orc-infested island to the northeast.\nWithin days, they had assembled their amphibious force near the shipyard and had loaded the transports with six ballistae, five archers, and one peasant. Escorted by &lt;a href=\"Destroyer%23Elven%20destroyer\"&gt;destroyers&lt;/a&gt;, they launched and sailed for the west side of the enemy base. They sunk a single enemy &lt;a href=\"Destroyer%23Troll%20destroyer\"&gt;destroyer&lt;/a&gt; on the way, while the rest of their fleet was busy guarding the other side. After landing, the worker they had brought quickly began a tower on the closest patch of flat ground. With a line of trees obscuring the orcs view of their operation, they were able to construct two cannon towers and a makeshift barracks unmolested. This temporary base was a testament to inherent aggressiveness of orcs, for they were very cooperative when Milan's force sent a single archer to greet them and lead the howling monsters back within range of their waiting forces. Shortly thereafter, Milan's forces began the assault within range of their base by land, a stratagem for which they were obviously unprepared. \nAfter leveling most of their structures, they lined up their ballistae along the shoreline and sank the majority of their ships. Those that remained were removed by a second group of their destroyers, they finished the operation by hunting down and slaughtering all of the panicked orcs that were left. It was a complete success; news of their victory quickly spread to the mainland.\nAftermath.\nThrilled with the success in Dun Modr, Milan's commander was ordered to chase after the Horde troops and defeat them in &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Algaz\"&gt;Dun Algaz&lt;/a&gt;.\nHowever, the praise was to be short lived, for the Horde ultimately had the final victory. The Horde forces counter attacked and retook Dun Modr, bringing forces to bear against Tol Barad itself, leaving the fortress in ruins. No life more complex than a few hardy weeds and insects survived the Horde's bloody victory. The Alliance held the ruins after the war, using it to state attacks on orcs in the region.\nYears later, the island nation of &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; claimed the former stronghold of Tol Barad and established a prison over the ruins of the old fortress.\nVideo.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

Troubles have arisen in the &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;Dwarven&lt;/a&gt; lands of &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;. A taskforce of &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt; warriors have laid siege to &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Modr\"&gt;Dun Modr&lt;/a&gt; - a vital staging area for &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; troops. You are to retake Dun Modr and then bring your forces to bear against Stromgarde's nearby island citadel of &lt;a href=\"Tol%20Barad\"&gt;Tol Barad&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nBattle.\nBackground.\nAfter unloading the Horde forces, the &lt;a href=\"Destroyer%23Troll%20destroyer\"&gt;destroyers&lt;/a&gt; immediately sailed south to look for enemy &lt;a href=\"oil%20platform\"&gt;oil platform&lt;/a&gt;s to seriously reduce the Alliance naval power while they established a base south of the landing point. All of Utok's troops swept into the village of Dun Modr and slaughtered the inhabitants before the Horde brought in the catapult to work on their structures. Once the village was secured, they summoned the workers and had them build two &lt;a href=\"pig%20farm\"&gt;pig farm&lt;/a&gt;s north of the &lt;a href=\"gold%20mine\"&gt;gold mine&lt;/a&gt; in the clearing, which served to block enemies from entering from that direction. While &lt;a href=\"lumber\"&gt;lumber&lt;/a&gt; was gathered to the east, a &lt;a href=\"great%20hall\"&gt;great hall&lt;/a&gt; was constructed in a defensive east-west line just south of the mine. During this time, they trained as many slaves as possible to work, for they would need to build up quickly.\nThe Horde's amphibious force needed many structures to produce the necessary warships and troops, so a &lt;a href=\"Lumber%20mill%23Troll%20lumber%20mill\"&gt;lumber mill&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Blacksmith%20%28building%29\"&gt;blacksmith&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"barracks\"&gt;barracks&lt;/a&gt; headed the list. With those completed, a &lt;a href=\"shipyard\"&gt;shipyard&lt;/a&gt; was built on the east shore near an &lt;a href=\"Oil%20Patch\"&gt;oil patch&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Oil%20tanker\"&gt;tankers&lt;/a&gt; were launched to exploit it. Their starting destroyers had managed to prevent enemy tankers from installing another platform by resting on the oil, which prevented them from producing more ships, so the Horde had little to worry about. Soon, they had a flotilla of six destroyers and two &lt;a href=\"transport%20ship\"&gt;transport ship&lt;/a&gt;s with which to make the assault.\nThey loaded eight grunts and four catapults onto the transports and set for the west side of the enemy city, behind the mine there. It was only a matter of time before the town was in ruins. The destroyers went out to clear the seas of any remaining enemy ships. Utok believed the &lt;a href=\"God\"&gt;God&lt;/a&gt;s were pleased that day; and that their ascension to power was well under way.\nAftermath.\nThe Horde had successfully left Tol Barad in ruins. No life more complex than a few hardy weeds and insects survived the Horde's bloody victory. While the Horde might have initially retaken Dun Modr, they lost it soon after. The Alliance held the ruins after the war, attacking the remaining orcs in the region.\nYears later, the island nation of &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; claimed the former stronghold of Tol Barad and established a prison over the ruins of the old fortress.\nVideo.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

It was under the protection of an elite guard known as the &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;s and their army of &lt;a href=\"water%20elemental\"&gt;water elemental&lt;/a&gt;s. It was a major outpost in Ashenvale along with Astranaar, which once lived up to its name\u2014a welcoming place with a comparatively luxurious inn.\nCataclysm.\nThe night elves thought Silverwind to be impenetrable, with its heavy defenses and their army of water elementals. However, during the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; attack, by the time of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, one of their &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s was able to summon a twisted elemental designed to send the night elven water elementals into a chaotic rage. With the enraged elementals attacking all they saw before them, victory was assured for the Horde.\nThe surviving night elves fled to the nearby &lt;a href=\"Stardust%20Spire\"&gt;Stardust Spire&lt;/a&gt; and vowed revenge for the loss of the outpost. The orcs had slaughtered Sentinels and civilians alike, and they hunted down those who tried to flee, letting their bodies rot in the road as a brutal warning to anyone who would try to retake Silverwind Refuge. The orcs proceed to use the outpost as a starting point for their push into the surrounding regions. Not long after, the Horde set up logging operations in the surrounding area and begun to clear the forest.\nAt some point after the events of the Cataclysm, a small army of Sentinels led by &lt;a href=\"Anaris%20Windwood\"&gt;Anaris Windwood&lt;/a&gt; reclaimed Silverwind from the Horde.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nBy the time of the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Thorns\"&gt;War of the Thorns&lt;/a&gt;, Silverwind Refuge was considered a night elven outpost and a center of Sentinel's presence. It would later fall to the Horde while they marched through Ashenvale.\nSome time later after the Burning of Teldrassil, Sentinels from &lt;a href=\"Stardust%20Spire\"&gt;Stardust Spire&lt;/a&gt; launched an assault to retake Silverwind Refuge from the Horde. There, they faced off &lt;a href=\"Valusha\"&gt;Valusha&lt;/a&gt;."}

She was previously involved in an epic quest for &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s. \nOriginal appearance.\nShe was originally at the &lt;a href=\"Golakka%20Hot%20Springs\"&gt;Golakka Hot Springs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Terror%20Run\"&gt;Terror Run&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Un%27Goro%20Crater\"&gt;Un'Goro Crater&lt;/a&gt;. She was in a female &lt;a href=\"jungle%20troll\"&gt;jungle troll&lt;/a&gt;-form called Simone the Inconspicuous unless you came to bother her with the quest. She was accompanied by her pet &lt;a href=\"wolf\"&gt;wolf&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Precious%20%28wolf%29\"&gt;Precious&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Cleaner.\nIf someone interferes while a hunter is killing Simone (whether pet or player) Simone despawns with the words \"Only a fool would now remain in this battle. So long, coward\". Meanwhile, a huge, black demon called &lt;a href=\"The%20Cleaner\"&gt;The Cleaner&lt;/a&gt; spawns, says \"You dare interfere with this being's testing? The battle must be fought alone! You shall all pay for this interference!\" and starts attacking anything in range. The Cleaner hits for around 4000-4500 damage on a level 70 clothie and appears to be immune to mostly anything you can throw at him.\nStrategy.\nThis can be a semi-difficult fight or a really easy one, depending on how prepared you are and your spec. Bring a nature protection potion and some &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Dust\"&gt;Magic Dust&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20Rocket%20Helmet\"&gt;Goblin Rocket Helmet&lt;/a&gt; for an easy kill. Being survival spec also helps immensely if you choose the Tank-It Method. \nTank-it.\nI recommend having another hunter in your group with Aspect of the Wild on, and that you would use Aspect of the Monkey. It's not necessary for the other hunter to feign death. If you don't have a hunter helper, make sure you use Aspect of the Wild yourself to stretch out your nature protection potion (alternatively, you can use a greater nature protection potion if you can get one). The fight is still not difficult even if you can't use Monkey.\nStart by laying a Freezing Trap, Hunter's Mark, Aimed shot on Simone, then immediately concussive shot. Have the pet get trapped, shoot a viper sting to silence her temporarily, and immediately run in and go all out melee (Spam wingclip, raptor, mongoose, and counterattack). Optionally, once the pet is out of the trap, use Goblin Rocket Helmet or &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Dust\"&gt;Magic Dust&lt;/a&gt; on it to knock it out for another 20\u201330 seconds. Once it is out of the disorient, pop deterrence to dodge or scatter shot to knock it out a little longer.\nScatter shot her whenever you see her start to cast the lightning bolt and continue to melee her, she will go down really fast. It may be a good idea to set up macros here, like the Solenor fight, to keep Precious stunned when needed. I used the following two macros to allow for quick switching:\n /target Simone\n /cast Attack\n /target Precious\n /cast Scatter Shot\nIf you don't have a Goblin Rocket Helmet, be stocked on tubers, night dragon's breath, and healing potions and use them once the timers are up (be aware that tubers and night dragon's breath share the same cooldown as of Patch 1.11, however; use the night dragon's breath only if you need mana). You should only need one (greater) nature protection potion the whole melee fight.\nAfter Simone is dead, you can either feign death to get rid of Precious or kill it. If you choose to kill it, you can have your pet and/or other party members assist you in this with no penalty. "}

During the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Neltharion&lt;/a&gt; the Earth Warder, Aspect of the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black flight&lt;/a&gt;, convinced his dragon brethren to empower a powerful artifact called the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt;, claiming that it would thwart the impending invasion of the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. However, Neltharion betrayed his dragon allies during the Legion's assault, provoking an apocalyptic battle in the skies over the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;. Malygos and Sindragosa joined the blue dragons in surrounding the Earth Warder and charged the black dragon. However, Neltharion used the might of the Dragon Soul to strike out, decimating nearly all of the blue dragonflight. He confronted Sindragosa, and the blast mortally wounded her and hurled her far across the land, deep into the &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Glacier\"&gt;icy north&lt;/a&gt;.\nBlinded and near death, Sindragosa sought desperately to reach the &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 the place where dragons instinctively travel to die. Weakened and no longer able to fly, Sindragosa plummeted to the cold earth in the peaks of &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt;. The blue dragon gathered what remained of her energy and called out to Malygos for aid. Her only answer was the howling arctic wind as she struggled on, but the distance was far too great; agonizingly, she realized that her spirit would not find rest within the Dragonblight. Her life continued to fade away as her sanity deteriorated. In the midst of her delirium, Sindragosa's final thoughts turned to bitterness and hatred: hatred against the Legion, hatred against Neltharion, hatred even against Malygos. But most of all, hatred against the world of mortals. And in her dying moments, Sindragosa vowed revenge.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nThousands of years later, &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, awoke from his long dormancy and journeyed to &lt;a href=\"Sindragosa%27s%20Fall\"&gt;Sindragosa's Fall&lt;/a&gt;, where he raised Sindragosa into undeath as a mighty skeletal &lt;a href=\"frost%20wyrm\"&gt;frost wyrm&lt;/a&gt; and ordered her to lead the &lt;a href=\"Frostbrood\"&gt;Frostbrood&lt;/a&gt; into war. The Lich King's final desecration of her was to tear the spirits of Sindragosa's lost &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20whelp\"&gt;whelps&lt;/a&gt; into undeath in front of her skeletal form, as a final affront to the great dragon. Arthas was known to use Sindragosa as a mount.\nSindragosa briefly appeared in the &lt;a href=\"Pit%20of%20Saron\"&gt;Pit of Saron&lt;/a&gt; after the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Scourgelord%20Tyrannus\"&gt;Scourgelord Tyrannus&lt;/a&gt;. While the leader of the army of liberated slaves (&lt;a href=\"Martin%20Victus\"&gt;Martin Victus&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gorkun%20Ironskull\"&gt;Gorkun Ironskull&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;) commended the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s for their bravery, Sindragosa rose up from the pit behind them and unleashed her fury, killing the leader and their army. The adventurers were pulled back to the entrance tunnel by &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; at the last second, saving them from a grisly death.\nSindragosa later retreated to her lair in the &lt;a href=\"Frostwing%20Halls\"&gt;Frostwing Halls&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, where she continued to strengthen her brood with the help of &lt;a href=\"Ymirheim\"&gt;Ymirheim&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt;. After &lt;a href=\"Valithria%20Dreamwalker\"&gt;Valithria Dreamwalker&lt;/a&gt; was rescued by &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s, she gave the heroes verdant &lt;a href=\"Pulsing%20Life%20Crystal\"&gt;life crystals&lt;/a&gt; to use during their battle with Sindragosa. Valithria instructed the champions to battle the Frost Queen until she was weakened, and then use the crystals to coax out the essence that was dormant within her. Similarly, &lt;a href=\"Darion%20Mograine\"&gt;Darion Mograine&lt;/a&gt; instructed would-be wielders of &lt;a href=\"%3AShadowmourne\"&gt;:Shadowmourne&lt;/a&gt; to grant &lt;a href=\"%3AShadow%27s%20Edge\"&gt;:Shadow's Edge&lt;/a&gt; its final infusion of power by subjecting themselves to four of Sindragosa's frozen breath attacks before ultimately destroying her. \nSindragosa defended the Lich King in Icecrown Citadel until the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s who went on to slay him destroyed her as well, leaving only her skull behind. But rather than leave her to suffer again in some form, the adventurers took her &lt;a href=\"Crystalline%20Essence%20of%20Sindragosa\"&gt;crystalline essence&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt;, where she could truly be laid to rest. Upon receiving the essence, Kalec stated \"So much suffering, so much needless destruction. These have not been kind times for my brothers and sisters. But thanks to your efforts, brave adventurers, this darkened yet still noble soul may find peace at last. Rest now, Sindragosa. You are home...\"\nDragonflight.\nYears later, &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt;, Malygos' replacement as Dragon Aspect of the blue flight, sought out Sindragosa's library in the &lt;a href=\"Azure%20Span\"&gt;Azure Span&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;. Though Sindragosa was long since dead, an arcane construct - referred to as a 'Simulacrum' - of herself that she left behind on the isles long ago appeared.\nAfter meeting Kalecgos, she guided him with her wisdom so that together they could restore the Azure Oathstone and send out a call to unite once more the blue dragonflight that was separated for too long. Soon after Kalec restored the &lt;a href=\"Azure%20Oathstone\"&gt;Azure Oathstone&lt;/a&gt;, he declared the blue dragonflight - his family - renewed.\nShortly thereafter, Kalecgos and Sindragosa's simulacrum worked together to find more members of the blue dragonflight scattered across &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, so that they could free the souls of &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt; and Sindragosa to finally rest in peace. The Simulacrum of Sindragosa revealed that her strength to traverse Azeroth is tied to the Oathstone, with its reactivation and growing strength she was allowed to traverse Azeroth and provide aid to adventurers aiding in uniting the blue dragons. After accomplishing their mission, they released the souls of Malygos and Sindragosa. Sindragosa asked what was going on, and her Simulacrum connected to her, making her see and feel everything that she went through alongside Kalecgos in recent times. Malygos apologized to Kalec for the burden he left him with, but in the end, both realized that Kalec was a good leader for the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, and that they were finally able to rest. After that, the simulacrum said that her work was done for now, she then thanked him before disappearing. In the end, Kalecgos thanked his lady for everything.\nQuotes.\nGossip.\nShall we begin?\nYou've opened arcane pathways within the vault. Where would you like to go?\nI remember this place.

The encounter with the undead &lt;a href=\"frost%20wyrm\"&gt;frost wyrm&lt;/a&gt; queen is similar to &lt;a href=\"Sapphiron\"&gt;Sapphiron&lt;/a&gt;. She spawns after the defeat of the frost wyrms &lt;a href=\"Rimefang\"&gt;Rimefang&lt;/a&gt; (who escaped the &lt;a href=\"Pit%20of%20Saron\"&gt;Pit of Saron&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href=\"Scourgelord%20Tyrannus\"&gt;Tyrannus&lt;/a&gt;' death) and &lt;a href=\"Spinestalker\"&gt;Spinestalker&lt;/a&gt;. It is a &lt;a href=\"battle%20for%20survival\"&gt;battle for survival&lt;/a&gt;, where players have to manage various debuff stacks.\nThis boss is available since February 2, 2010 on US servers and February 3 on EU servers.\nAbilities.\nSindragosa has a 10-minute enrage timer.\n10 player mode.\nPhase Two (Air Phase).\nAlthough Sindragosa takes to the air on a recurrent timer, her abilities are distinctively different from phase 1 and therefore is considered its own phase.\nPhase Three.\nAll Phase One abilities, plus:\n25 player mode.\nPhase Two (Air Phase).\nAlthough Sindragosa takes to the air on a recurrent timer, her abilities are distinctively different from phase 1 and therefore is considered its own phase.\nPhase Three.\nAll Phase One abilities, plus:\nPreparation.\nSindragosa immediately aggros when both Rimefang and Spinestalker are dead. While learning the encounter, it's a good idea to initially reset her, which can (sometimes) accomplished by running back to the teleporter pad or the last room right after the second frost wyrm dies.\nThis encounter requires one tank, a second one is a good idea (for Phase 3). Tanks should have a decent amount of frost resistance, the paladin aura or shaman totem should also be used. Low stamina raid members can also consider wearing a few pieces of FR gear.\nLike most dragons Sindragosa deals a rear tail swipe and a frontal cleave, thus only the tank stands in front of her. The raid should stand at her side, between tail swipe and cleave. Melee should set up at the outer edge of her (rather large) hitbox, ranged a little further out, but not at maximum range. Players who stand too close may miss an Icy Grip (because they don't fly through the air), those too far out loose too much time airborne and thus may not be fast enough in running away. In preparation of Phase 3, it's a good idea if the raid generally keeps close together, either near her front or hind legs.\nPhase One.\nDuring the whole fight she deals stacking debuffs to the whole raid. When melee attacks her, there's a 20% chance per hit on the boss to gain the Permeating Chill stacking debuff which inflicts 1,000 Frost damage every 2 seconds for 8 seconds, per stack. For casters, she periodically debuffs mana users with Unchained Magic, which for 15 seconds causes its victims to gain a stack of Instability every time they cast a spell (including things like Healthstones or Trinkets). Instability expires after 5 sec (unless refreshed by casting another spell). Expiration is unavoidable after Unchained Magic fades. Upon expiration, Instability deals 2k damage per stack.\nDuring Phase 1 these debuff stacks don't hurt a lot (it's safe to take up to 8 stacks), but in Phase 2 they become dangerous (players should try to stay below 4 stacks). For this reason it's a good idea to practise keeping them low even in Phase 1. Managing these debuffs (and the additional one in Phase 2) is the heart of the fight. Players may get used to stopping their attacks/casts when their stacks get high.\nIn regular intervals, she pulls the whole raid on top of herself (Icy Grip) and then starts a 5 sec cast of Blistering Cold, which deals 35k Frost damage to everyone within 25 yards of her (with enough HP or resistance this is survivable). This means that the raid has 5 seconds to get 25 yards away from her. Players should mouse-turn while flying through the air and immediately run away on touchdown. Hunters can use &lt;a href=\"Aspect%20of%20the%20Pack\"&gt;Aspect of the Pack&lt;/a&gt;, the frost aura does not cause the daze effect. After everyone is out of range, it must be switched off immediately. It is possible to slow her cast time with (&lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Tongues\"&gt;Curse of Tongues&lt;/a&gt; or maybe &lt;a href=\"Numbing%20Poison\"&gt;Numbing Poison&lt;/a&gt;), but this may decrease Melee's DPS output because they have to wait longer before running back.\nPhase Two (Air Phase).\nEvery 1:50 minutes, Sindragosa takes off, freezes 2/5 (10/25 player) raid members with Ice Tomb and drops four Frost Bombs (one after the other, on random spots). Players who are in line of sight of one of the bomb explosions take ~24k damage, therefore the raid should hide behind the Ice Tombs. After the fourth Bomb she lands and continues with another Phase 1.\nSindragosa puts a Frost Beacon on the Ice Tomb targets about 5 seconds before they get entombed. Since Ice Tombs not only damage their targets, but also everyone else in a 10 yard radius, it's important for the ice tomb targets to move away from all non-targets and from each other. After 20 seconds, she's dropped all her bombs, lands and resumes Phase 1. At this point, the entombed players start to take damage from asphyxiation. Players are freed from the Ice Tombs by destroying them (~450k HP). They should be damaged to about 10% while she drops the bombs, and quickly destroyed after the fourth bomb has exploded.\n10 player.\nIn 10 player, the raid can stay on the stairs at all times, tanking her right in front of the stairs. The raid initially groups on her hind legs. The players with Frost Beacon run to where her front legs were (one higher up the other lower down the stairs). When she Frost Beacons the next set of players, they again run to the other side (where her hind legs were), after the Tombs have materialized the raid follows. This movement pattern closely resembles the one used in Phase 2.\n25 player.\nThe 10 player technique cannot be used with 25, because it requires very high precision in positioning with 5 frost tombs (6 on heroic) plus the raid on the stairs. It's simpler to tank her some distance (about 20\") away from the stairs. All players should be prepared for Frost Beacons, and run up to the top of the stairs. As players get beaconed, they can then step down towards the bottom of the steps, in two rows (three in the front, on the main floor, and two behind, up three or four steps), with the untargeted players running to the beaconed players as soon as they are tombed. By first walking to the top of the stairs then walking down toward the tombs, all players should be able to easily see the location of the first Frost Bomb and position themselves to block line of sight. In 25 player, the rear tombs (furthest up the stairs) can be destroyed even before she lands (but be careful not to destroy a tomb just before a bomb lands). On 25-player heroic, avoid destroying any tombs until after the fourth Frost Bomb, so that those who are freed (and may be disoriented) are not instantly killed by a Frost Bomb. DPS should avoid DoTs, and use direct damage so as to leave the tombs with enough health to keep everyone alive, but low enough that they can be quickly destroyed after the fourth Frost Bomb.\nPhase Three.\nPhase 3 starts when Sindragosa is at 35% health. She becomes permanently grounded, and continues all of her abilities from phase 1. Although she stops casting Frost Bombs, Sindragosa continues to cast Frost Beacons and Ice Tombs, which players must use to control her new ability, Mystic Buffet. One stack of this debuff is gained by all players in her line of sight every 4 seconds. Each stack increases magical damage taken by 10%/15% (10/25 player). \nHer time between Ice Tomb casts in phase 3 seems to be 20 seconds.\nPhase 3 is not a DPS race, but focuses on the players' ability to manage Mystic Buffet and the other debuffs. Mystic Buffet expires after 8 seconds, she refreshes it after 6 (that is with 4 seconds left on the debuff). In effect it's enough to hide behind the Ice Block for just the crucial few seconds when she refreshes it.\nThe 10 player Ice Block routine can be used for both raid sizes in this phase - Frost Beaconed players run to the other side, raid follows, hides and destroys the Ice Blocks after they have materialized. With two tanks, it's a good idea to switch tanks at this moment too.\nHeroic Difficulty.\nThe most important change is that Instability (Unchained Magic's backlash) not only hits the affected player, but also everyone else within 20 yards.\nPhase 2 (air phase) Frost Bomb damage is increased to 200,000 and is no longer survivable, and in 25m (10m stays at 2 players) six players are Frost Beaconed instead of five.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;\nKnown Bugs.\nIt has been reported (and subsequently confirmed multiple times) on the &lt;a href=\"forums\"&gt;World of Warcraft US and EU forums&lt;/a&gt; that many raids are experiencing unusual behavior when a &lt;a href=\"Death%20Knight\"&gt;Death Knight&lt;/a&gt; applies &lt;a href=\"Mark%20of%20Blood\"&gt;Mark of Blood&lt;/a&gt; to Sindragosa. The reports suggest that when Sindragosa has the Mark of Blood debuff, she will randomly turn away from the tank that is keeping aggro on her and face the rest of the raid for between 0.5 to 1 seconds. While not significantly detrimental in itself, some of the reports suggest that these turns coincided with casts of Frost Breath, subsequently wiping the raid. It is currently not known whether Blizzard have begun work to correct this."}

His light armor makes him more maneuverable than most opponents, and he darts in to attack then retreats into the shadows. &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Hunter%20%28Warcraft%20III%29%23Immolation\"&gt;Immolation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Hunter%20%28Warcraft%20III%29%23Mana%20Burn\"&gt;mana burn&lt;/a&gt; not only deal damage but distract foes from their own battle plans, making it easier for him to divide and conquer.\nSpeculation.\nHe might be &lt;a href=\"Feronas%20Sindweller\"&gt;Feronas Sindweller&lt;/a&gt; or related to him."}

She is only accessible after &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt; is defeated. \nBackground.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"Originally Deathwing's prime consort, Sinestra created the first twilight dragons, but was later obliterated by one of her terrifying creations. Now a ravaged husk reanimated by insidious magic, Sinestra oversees the creation of new twilight clutches.\"\nAbilities.\nStage One: I Will Deal With You Myself!\nAt the outset of the battle, Sinestra is weakened from past battles and from nurturing the Twilight brood. She begins with only 60% of her maximum health, and her damage dealt is reduced by by 40%.\nStage Two: I Tire of This!\nWhen Sinestra is brought to 30% health, she draws upon ambient energy to restore her power and erects a shield to protect herself.\nStage Three: Now Die!\nOnce the players destroy the &lt;a href=\"Pulsing%20Twilight%20Egg\"&gt;Pulsing Twilight Egg&lt;/a&gt;s, Sinestra brings her magical duel with Calen to an end and attacks the players with her full fury. Empowered by the twilight eggs from which she reclaims her siphoned energy, Sinestra no longer deals reduced damage.\nStrategy.\nPhase 1.\nThe entire fight is a severe dps check, but phase 1 may be the most important. The boss has a somewhat significant aggro radius and you\u2019ll want to have your whole raid within about 10 or 15 yards of the boss. Have your tank give a 5 second countdown while the raid times their most powerful spells and abilities to hit the boss simultaneously. You\u2019ll need to do all you can to maximize your raid\u2019s dps in this phase. Use raid wide movement increase buffs like Stampeding Roar to help DPSers move in close to the boss faster after the pull. The raid should maintain an even spread in front of the boss without being too stacked up. Do not stand too close to the boss, but try to stay within 10 or 15 yards. You\u2019ll want to assign your healing as follows:\n1 healer for the main tank as well as a beacon if available.\n1 healer for the offtank as well as a second beacon if available.\n3 healers with Wrack &gt; Raid &gt; Tanks priority. This means that these healers make sure to top of players with the Wrack debuff first, then other non-tanks, then tanks. \nYou\u2019ll need to train a primary and secondary dispeller for wrack as well. The primary dispeller should be a dps class like a shadow priest. The secondary or backup dispeller can be a healer. The general rule of thumb for wrack is that it should be dispelled after being on its target for 10 seconds. If wrack is on a player for longer than 10 seconds, the player risks being killed by the damage. If it is dispelled long before 10 seconds, the raid may end up with too many wracks out at one time and being overwhelmed. The easiest and best way to gain an advantage on wrack, is to extend the duration or time of the first application of wrack each time it goes out. This means if Sinestra casts wrack on a warrior, at around 10 seconds that warrior should use shield wall to keep the debuff longer. This will result in a much easier time dispelling the wrack when it has split multiple times. This goes for any class with abilities that will lower the damage for wrack. It is additionally helpful to have holy priests guardian spirit the first wrack victim so that they can hold the debuff for even one more tick. Raid healers should make sure to keep players with Wrack topped off as much as possible. The number one ability players need to keep their eyes open for are the Twilight Orbs. When these spawn, it is important that players don\u2019t immediately panic and scatter away from them. A small purple beam will form between the orb and player it is fixated on. Recognizing which player is fixated is key to reacting properly to these orbs. Players who are not targeted by the orb must not only get away from the orb, but also make sure they are not between the two orbs. There is around a 3 second grace period between when the beam forms and when the Orbs begin to pulse and slicer between them forms. The players who are fixated should run away from the raid and kite the orbs to the back of the room. In order to increase dps these players should kite around each other halfway through their path and begin returning to the raid. When done properly the orbs will despawn before coming back into the raid and the players can start dpsing again quickly. The whelps that spawn in this phase should be picked up by the offtank and held in the raid. It is ok to dps these, but do not kill them yet. Healers should stand closer to the offtank so that the whelps are easier to pick up and keep off of the healers. The goal of phase 1 is to bring Sinestra to 30% health and start phase 2 before a third set of whelps and before a second Wrack debuff go out. This may require a bit of practice to achieve, but will soon become easily repeatable. \nPhase 2.\nPhase 2 is an add phase. Start it off by having the raid move to the back of the room. This is where Calen will spawn his Fiery Barrier and the raid must be underneath it to survive Twilight Extinction. The offtank should bring the whelps to the very back of the shield.\nOnce under the bubble, ranged DPS should begin to attack Sinestra. She will be invulnerable to damage, but attacking her is necessary to bring down the Twilight Carapace buff on the Pulsing Twilight Eggs. While ranged are doing this, Melee should be AoEing down the Twilight Whelps in one pile. Each time a Twilight Whelp dies, it will turn into a pool of Twilight Essence. If a whelp dies in another whelp\u2019s Twilight Essence, both will respawn. Because of this, all of the whelps that you AoE here will respawn later, but that will not be an issue. The raid will need to split up during this phase and it\u2019s important for each player to know where they need to be.\nOnce twilight extinction has gone out and the whelps are mostly AoE\u2019d down, the tank should move to the middle of the room and prepare to pick up Twilight Drakes. Melee will stay in the back of the room and prepare to dps and stun Twilight Spitecallers. Ranged will split into two groups and move to the walkways to DPS the Pulsing Twilight Eggs. Make sure the split is even so that ranged can hopefully kill each egg in one add wave. Place a healer with each ranged group in case Unleash Essence is cast on the raid. The rest of the healers should be in the back of the room healing melee, the tank, and Calen. If Calen is being healed and Sinestra is being DPSed, the eggs will lose their Twilight Carapace buff for 30 seconds. With very good DPS, the ranged groups can kill both eggs in this time. If successful, phase 3 will begin and the raid can move into positions. If unsuccessful in killing both eggs, ranged should begin DPSing Sinestra again while the raid contends with more adds and waits for the Twilight Carapace buff to fall again.\nDuring this phase the Twilight Drakes can simply be tanked, but the Spitecallers in the back have an extremely harmful ability called Unleash Essence that must not be allowed to cast. Melee will need to set up a stun rotation to keep these mobs from using this ability. However, normal stuns will cause the Spitecallers to regain control by unleashing a very painful ability called Indomitable. Rogues take note: Kick and Stun should absolutely not be used; however, Gouge (with the &lt;a href=\"Glyph%20of%20Gouge\"&gt;Glyph of Gouge&lt;/a&gt; active) works excellently. Death Grip, Hibernate, Ring of Frost, Typhoon, and Scatter Shot also work. If Indomitable does go off, rogues can shiv it or hunters can use tranquilizing shot to remove it. Additionally, paladins tanking the Spitecallers should make sure not to have &lt;a href=\"Glyph%20of%20Holy%20Wrath\"&gt;Glyph of Holy Wrath&lt;/a&gt; active, as it will also trigger Indomitable. If a Spitecaller's cast is about to go off and it is almost dead, a stun or kick can be used without wiping the raid. Be warned, Spitecallers can spawn quite fast, making it difficult to keep up with killing them if DPS is low.\nOnce both Twilight Eggs have been killed, there will be a 30 second grace period to finish killing any adds left alive before phase 3 starts. Use this time to quickly kill off the remaining Spitecallers and Twilight Drakes. Remember that the whelps will respawn and must be picked up by the offtank again.\nPhase 3.\nPhase 3 is identical to phase 1, but much longer. The raid will begin this phase by being granted with the Essence of the Red buff, which is important because Sinestra will heal back to 100% health at the start of the phase. This will increase all haste by 100% and give casters infinite mana. The buff is necessary to heal through the damage in this phase and to meet the soft enrage timer. At the start of phase 3, have the raid move back into their phase 1 positions. Wrack, Orbs, and Flame Breath should all be handled just as they were in phase 1. The whelps however, will be treated differently. The offtank will pick these up and tank them in the back of the room. In order to keep the whelps from being killed on top of each other and resurrecting in this phase, they will be pulled off the tank by pre-assigned dpsers and killed off solo in their own areas. Ideally, the whelps should be killed in as compact an area as possible. This is because the void zones that the whelps create upon death will grow indefinitely throughout the fight. Eventually, this can severely limit the safe size of the room and make it quite difficult to move with Twilight Orbs. After three minutes, the Essence of the Red buff will fade and your raid will want to have the boss as low as possible when this happens. The last few percent of the fight without the buff will be extremely brutal. Make sure to use raid cooldowns such as Aura Mastery or Barrier for Flame Breath as healing after it will be difficult. Set up a Tranquility and Hymn rotation to top the raid off after each Flame Breath. It is a good idea to offtank the last two set of whelps in order to maximize dps on the boss. Unless the offtank is a pally, and can bubble off debuffs, they will likely have very high Twilight Spit stacks. Between the third and fourth wave of whelps, the Offtank should taunt Sinestra off of the maintank and allow the maintank to pick up the rest of the Twilight Whelps. Simply hold these in melee range while the raid focuses on burning down the boss.\nThis fight will not be easy. The damage is high, the coordination is rigid, and the mechanics are very unforgiving. It\u2019s no wonder Sinestra was tough enough to survive Deathwing. It may take your raid quite some time to down this boss, but don\u2019t let frustration get the better of you. It is overall a fun fight that will really test your skills.\nSolo strategy.\nStart the encounter normally and make sure to stay within melee range of her, but save cooldowns for later. Once she gets to 30% health, she'll pop her Mana Shield and recover her health and mana. Ignore the adds, but if they're annoying, kill the whelps one-at-a-time, but spread out so the pools that spawn when they die don't overlap and revive them.\nContinuously do damage to her regardless of her health/mana bar until Calen yells After a few seconds, the raid warning appears. Quickly break off and destroy both eggs. Use any movement speed buffs to get from one to the other so they both die in the 30-second window.\nOnce she runs out of mana, she will take damage normally. Finish her off.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

There is also a side entrance to Sinfall accessible from &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary%20of%20the%20Mad\"&gt;Sanctuary of the Mad&lt;/a&gt; that also leads to an area called &lt;a href=\"Dawnkeep\"&gt;Dawnkeep&lt;/a&gt;.

However, if you miss any of the platforms and end up going down into the chasm, your character dies. Additionally, while you can control your fall direction if you simply jump into the grate, if you fall into the grate while mounted you will fall straight down.\nHistory.\nSinfall was originally where &lt;a href=\"Denathrius\"&gt;Denathrius&lt;/a&gt; sired his first &lt;a href=\"venthyr\"&gt;venthyr&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Harvesters\"&gt;Court of Harvesters&lt;/a&gt; ages ago. It is where he forged the medallions so that each Harvester may share a piece of his power and carry out his will.\nThe &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt; were created after the venthyr, and were assumed banished and exiled by Denathrius for their actions and treachery that led to the invasion of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=\"Ember%20Ward\"&gt;Ember Ward&lt;/a&gt;. The current &lt;a href=\"Stonewright\"&gt;Stonewright&lt;/a&gt; created the &lt;a href=\"stoneborn\"&gt;stoneborn&lt;/a&gt; and formed the &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Legion\"&gt;Stone Legion&lt;/a&gt; due to the fact the &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxi\"&gt;Maldraxxi&lt;/a&gt; did not come to the defense of Revendreth in this instance, and blames the dreadlords for the near destruction of the &lt;a href=\"Ember%20Ward\"&gt;Ember Ward&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt remained forbidden place filled with secrets where &lt;a href=\"Sire%20Denathrius\"&gt;Sire Denathrius&lt;/a&gt; would perform dark magic and experiments.\nMuch later this place was used to fling &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Renathal\"&gt;Prince Renathal&lt;/a&gt; into the &lt;a href=\"Tremaculum\"&gt;Tremaculum&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt; with the help of an old device powered through the Containers of Dark Will only usable by &lt;a href=\"Denathrius\"&gt;Denathrius&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Walker\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt;. This device drops you into . After the Prince was rescued, he turned Sinfall into his stage ground against Denathrius himself. Sinfall Reaches, the dais on this level, is where Prince Renathal intends to place all 7 Medallions of Revendreth and the Crown of the Harvesters in order to become the new ruler of Revendreth.\nAfter the defeat of the Sire, his blade &lt;a href=\"Remornia\"&gt;Remornia&lt;/a&gt; consumed his essence, and the weapon was brought to Sinfall. He was later rescued by the dreadlords led by &lt;a href=\"Nal%27ragas\"&gt;Nal'ragas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mal%27Ganis\"&gt;Mal'Ganis&lt;/a&gt;, having their forces hidden among us the entire time we were there."}

{"id": "12971", "revid": "38896978", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=12971", "title": "Voidwalker", "text": "Voidwalkers (or void walkers) are a type of &lt;a href=\"void\"&gt;void&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Void-spawn\"&gt;creature&lt;/a&gt;. Large shapeless things in hues of blue and purple, they hover ominously. Despite being fleshless, they do have &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;s. Enigmatic and emanating intense shadow, a voidwalker is sometimes the last thing someone encounters before crossing over into the realm of &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;.\nTouching them has been compared to the burning feeling of frostbite, and their grips strong enough to crush bone into powder.\nAlthough they aren't demons, they are sometimes referred to as such and classified for gameplay reasons.\nWarcraft III.\nVoidwalkers first appeared in as a type of Outland &lt;a href=\"creep\"&gt;creep&lt;/a&gt;. Lorewise, they served little purpose other than being random monsters fought by &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Vashj\"&gt;Lady Vashj&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; when Illidan fled to Outland in order to hide from &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; (after &lt;a href=\"The%20Ruins%20of%20Dalaran\"&gt;failing&lt;/a&gt; his task of destroying the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt; - he later failed it &lt;a href=\"A%20Symphony%20of%20Frost%20and%20Flame\"&gt;once more&lt;/a&gt;) and Kael'thas, accompanied by Lady Vashj, later went to &lt;a href=\"The%20Dusts%20of%20Outland\"&gt;look for him&lt;/a&gt;. The voidwalkers they encountered were however guarding &lt;a href=\"Magtheridon\"&gt;Magtheridon&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Dimensional%20Gateway\"&gt;Dimensional Gateway&lt;/a&gt;s and his &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt;, which implies that they were either his slaves or soldiers. It was also possible to hire voidwalkers (and other Outland-creeps - even &lt;a href=\"eredar\"&gt;eredar&lt;/a&gt;) from a &lt;a href=\"Mercenary%20Camp\"&gt;Mercenary Camp&lt;/a&gt; they found. Voidwalkers are even more trivial in custom maps where they only guard random treasures and/or points of interest such as &lt;a href=\"gold%20mine\"&gt;gold mine&lt;/a&gt;s. \nAs seen from the picture, voidwalkers in Warcraft III look a bit different from the WoW ones. They are thinner, to such a degree that it's possible to see their ribs (although voidwalkers shouldn't have skeletons, as they're made of shadow), and are more similar to &lt;a href=\"voidwraith\"&gt;voidwraith&lt;/a&gt;s. Their heads are larger, and have large gaping mouths. Their bodies are also \"pointier\", having what seems to be spikes on the shoulders. They come in different colors depending on type; pink-purple (\"Lesser Voidwalker\"), blue (\"Voidwalker\"), purple (\"Greater Voidwalker\") and red (\"Elder Voidwalker\"). Voidwalkers in Warcraft III use frost and lightning spells, the Elder also being able to consume mana. The sounds they make resemble the growls of a lion, slightly \"ethereal\".\nOutland.\nThe rogue voidwalkers seen in places like the &lt;a href=\"Warp%20Fields\"&gt;Warp Fields&lt;/a&gt; notably wear what appear to be pauldrons, and sometimes breast plates, as opposed to bracers. The reason for this, and any difference it may make on their abilities, is unknown. Perhaps the voidwalkers on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; are \"shackled\" from their original plane, like &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt;s (this is confirmed in the non-canon RPG). It would explain the lack of bracers on the Outland-voidwalkers as &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; technically is in the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;, and so they would not need them.\nIn the RPG.\nVoidwalkers are &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s created from the chaos of the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;. Their touch is misery, and it can momentarily blind a creature's awareness to other threats.\nThese hulking blue creatures look vaguely humanoid. It seems to appear from within a black cloud as dark as the void.\nA voidwalker's sole purpose is to unconditionally serve a master. Thus, travelers rarely encounter them alone. The voidwalker is often a warlock's choice fel companion for its ability to intercept a single foe and keep him or her occupied. Many warlocks also prefer to do without the mischievousness of an imp or the jealousy of a succubus, preferring instead the unwavering, silent loyalty of a voidwalker.\nVoidwalkers understand but do not speak Eredun.\nA voidwalker does not hesitate to follow even the most suicidal commands its master gives. A voidwalker's master often sends it to block a threat, leaving the master free to cast spells or use other abilities without interference. A voidwalker takes its orders literally; when out of communication with its master, it continues to obey its last command, even if that command is tactically unsound.\nThe touch of a voidwalker brings a victim's most painful memories rushing to the surface; for a brief moment, she can think of nothing but destroying the source of this mental anguish.\nLike elementals, voidwalkers, whether summoned to Azeroth or arriving of their own free will, wear a set of magic bracers. These bracers form automatically when the voidwalker leaves the Twisting Nether, tying the voidwalker to Azeroth and allowing it to exist outside of the Twisting Nether. A voidwalker that loses its bracers also loses much of its power and might inadvertently return to the Twisting Nether.\nA voidwalker can absorb the darkness surrounding it, thereby healing itself of wounds; A voidwalker in total darkness can spend time concentrating drawing the darkness in and producing a faint indigo light around its body. A voidwalker may consume shadows in shadowy illumination but heals only half as much as it would in total darkness. If the voidwalker takes damage while using consume shadows, it may lose concentration and fail in the attempt.\nSpeculation.\nOther types.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Warlords%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Warlords of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;\" a new type of voidwalker appeared. These new variations appear rather different than the standard voidwalkers because of their lighter and more varied color. They are often categorized and known as &lt;a href=\"elementals\"&gt;elementals&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"aberrations\"&gt;aberrations&lt;/a&gt;. It is currently unknown whether these are simply new models for the common voidwalkers or an entirely new subspecies."}

{"id": "94115", "revid": "22514", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=94115", "title": "Voidwalker (warlock minion)", "text": "The Voidwalker is the second &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic &lt;a href=\"warlock%20minion\"&gt;minion&lt;/a&gt; available to the &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;, summoned through the &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Voidwalker\"&gt;Summon Voidwalker&lt;/a&gt; ability, available at level 8. \nVoidwalkers are good &lt;a href=\"tank\"&gt;tank&lt;/a&gt;s against non-&lt;a href=\"elite\"&gt;elite&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s at or near the warlock's level; therefore, they are excellent for solo play. Although they can be used in at least low level instances as a substitute for a proper tank, due to their comparative fragility this is generally not advised.\nAmong the four regular warlock pets, the Voidwalker has the most &lt;a href=\"health\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt;.\nTips.\nThe Voidwalker is a great tank pet; he takes massive amounts of damage, has great armor and holds massive amounts of enemy aggression (which is nice because it's not on you!). If you intend to fight multiple enemies simultaneously, the Voidwalker is your best choice. Using him with &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Pact\"&gt;Dark Pact&lt;/a&gt; is a powerful strategy when being ambushed by another player or mob, giving you a shield that can absorb thousands of points of damage at a moment's notice.\nSadly, the Voidwalker does the least melee damage of any of the four regular warlock pets. Don't rely on it to kill the target with melee damage. Instead, put your &lt;a href=\"DoT\"&gt;DoT&lt;/a&gt;s on the &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;, and maybe use some direct-damage spells as well, such as &lt;a href=\"Immolate\"&gt;Immolate&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Bolt\"&gt;Shadow Bolt&lt;/a&gt;, but be sparing so you don't draw the aggro to yourself. The whole point of a Voidwalker is to absorb the mob's attention and damage so you're free to let your spells work, watch for adds, use &lt;a href=\"Life%20Tap\"&gt;Life Tap&lt;/a&gt;, bandage yourself, etc. See the strategy section of &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Agony\"&gt;Curse of Agony&lt;/a&gt; for tips on how to effectively combine usage of &lt;a href=\"DOT\"&gt;DOT&lt;/a&gt;s with the Voidwalker.\nSuffering provides plenty of threat, but sometimes if you start casting your DoTs/Direct Damage spells too early while soloing, the mobs will eventually ignore the Voidwalker and attack you, even if he has the aforementioned mode turned on. The key to avoiding this is to let the Voidwalker build up threat by ordering him to attack the mob and take off a bit of its health \"before\" you start casting your spells. If you let the Voidwalker smack the mob around until it gets to about 90-93 percent health and \"then\" start casting your DoT/DD spells, he'll generally be able to hold &lt;a href=\"aggro\"&gt;aggro&lt;/a&gt; for the rest of the fight. If you're &lt;a href=\"destruction\"&gt;destruction&lt;/a&gt; specced, you might want to wait a bit longer as destruction spells generate more threat than &lt;a href=\"affliction\"&gt;affliction&lt;/a&gt; spells. The Voidwalker will take more damage than usual if you use this tactic, but with ample use of &lt;a href=\"Health%20Funnel\"&gt;Health Funnel&lt;/a&gt; or perhaps commanding him to use Shadow Bulwark this shouldn't be a problem.\nThe threat generated has very limited use in PvP combat, but a Voidwalker isn't entirely useless. Suffering can be used to distract a &lt;a href=\"pet\"&gt;pet&lt;/a&gt; belonging to another warlock or hunter while you focus on more important targets such as the warlock or hunter itself. \nBecause of its high health defensive abilities, the Voidwalker is likely to have a lot of health at any given time, making it the best pet to have around if you're going to use &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Link\"&gt;Soul Link&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\n\"The Voidwalker is summoned via &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Voidwalker\"&gt;Summon Voidwalker&lt;/a&gt;, which can be learned from any warlock trainer at level 8. Previously, the player was required to undertake a quest in order to acquire the Voidwalker. The below information describes this process, and is kept for historical purposes. \"\nPer usual, the quest line begins with an &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt; warlock near the &lt;a href=\"trainer\"&gt;trainer&lt;/a&gt;s in one of each faction's major cities. When you reach level 10 as a warlock, go to any warlock training area for your faction (other than the level 1-6 starting areas) and there will be a quest for you, either starting you on the quest or directing you to the right person to talk to.\nFor the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, Ophek in &lt;a href=\"Razor%20Hill\"&gt;Razor Hill&lt;/a&gt; will send you to Gan'rul Bloodeye in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ageron%20Kargal\"&gt;Ageron Kargal&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Brill\"&gt;Brill&lt;/a&gt; will send you to &lt;a href=\"Carendin%20Halgar\"&gt;Carendin Halgar&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"The%20Undercity\"&gt;The Undercity&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; warlocks will be directed to Gakin the Darkbinder in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, either by Remen Marcot of &lt;a href=\"Goldshire\"&gt;Goldshire&lt;/a&gt; or Lago Blackwrench of &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; (to whom you may be directed by the &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt; warlock trainers of &lt;a href=\"Kharanos\"&gt;Kharanos&lt;/a&gt;).\nIn either case, the quest giver will send you to retrieve a quest item from someone nearby, who will not part with it willingly, and when you return with it, the ritual begins. A trainer will then tell you to summon a Voidwalker somewhere nearby. You must defeat it to earn the power to summon one yourself again in the future. Others can assist, of course.\nThe &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elf&lt;/a&gt; quest requires you to fight your way into a village in the Ghostlands guarded by &lt;a href=\"Quel%27dorei%20Ghost\"&gt;Quel'dorei Ghost&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Quel%27dorei%20Wraith\"&gt;Wraiths&lt;/a&gt; because there isn't a summoning circle in Silvermoon City. All in all, this quest is far more difficult than the other Horde versions."}

Previously a vibrant and lush jungle, Vol'dun is now a virtually uninhabitable, vast sea of dunes dreaded by all &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt;, for to be exiled to its endless wastes is a sure sentence of death. And yet somehow, the wily nomads known as the &lt;a href=\"vulpera\"&gt;vulpera&lt;/a&gt; have managed to eke out an existence here, despite facing a constant threat from the &lt;a href=\"sethrak\"&gt;sethrak&lt;/a&gt;, a brutal snakelike race determined to reign over this arid wasteland.\nHistory.\nThousands of years ago, this vast desert with rolling sand dunes was once a dense, vibrant jungle, described by &lt;a href=\"Meerah\"&gt;Meerah&lt;/a&gt; as the jewel of the &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; empire. The &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari troll&lt;/a&gt;s and the snake-like &lt;a href=\"sethrak\"&gt;sethrak&lt;/a&gt; lived in harmony in this region, and together they worshiped the snake &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sethraliss\"&gt;Sethraliss&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Aqir%20and%20Troll%20War\"&gt;war&lt;/a&gt; between the trolls and the &lt;a href=\"aqir\"&gt;aqir&lt;/a&gt; roughly 16,000 years ago, the &lt;a href=\"C%27Thrax\"&gt;C'Thrax&lt;/a&gt;xi warbringer &lt;a href=\"Mythrax\"&gt;Mythrax the Unraveler&lt;/a&gt; was tasked with invading Vol'dun and descended upon the region, slaughtering troll and sethrak alike. Sethraliss sacrificed herself to defeat Mythrax, but not before the C'Thrax was able to destroy the disc at the heart of &lt;a href=\"Atul%27Aman\"&gt;Atul'Aman&lt;/a&gt;. Due to Sethraliss' death and the various cataclysms that occurred in the region as the years progressed, the jungles of Vol'dun were transformed into a vast desert. As a result, most of the trolls abandoned the region. This left only the sethrak, who continued to survive and thrive in Vol'dun, which they considered the holiest of holy grounds.\nAfter witnessing the destruction wrought by Mythrax firsthand, the sethrak knew that something had to be done to prevent anyone from raising the C'Thrax again. &lt;a href=\"Sulthis\"&gt;Sulthis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vorrik\"&gt;Vorrik&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Korthek\"&gt;Korthek&lt;/a&gt; worked together to seal Mythrax within the great pyramid. Years later, Korthek grew power hungry and sought to free Mythrax to conquer &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt;. He gathered like-minded sethrak and declared himself emperor of the &lt;a href=\"Faithless\"&gt;Faithless&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the present day, Zandalar sends its criminals here to die, and most of them end up perishing. The area is mostly inhabited by Zandalari vagabonds, sethrak, and &lt;a href=\"vulpera\"&gt;vulpera&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Ashvane%20Trading%20Company\"&gt;Ashvane Trading Company&lt;/a&gt; has a presence in the southern edge of Vol'dun, mining for &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeography.\nLocated in the north west of &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;, Vol'dun is a vast and unforgiving land. Dunes of sand, salt flats, and bone breaking rocky terrain stretch from coast to coast, meeting up with &lt;a href=\"Nazmir\"&gt;Nazmir&lt;/a&gt; to the east and &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt; to the south. Danger here comes as much from the arid and unrelenting landscape as it does from the creatures who eke out a living here. The sand-bleached bones of giant beasts litter the land, long since picked clean and polished to a gleaming smooth by the shifting sands. Brief moments of reprieve from the heat can be found to the north in the small stretch of marsh and in the caverns and oasis tucked away from the unrelenting sun.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

For years Vol'jin resided in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, offering strategic advice to then-Warchief Thrall and assisting with critical operations such as retaking the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; bastion had been usurped by &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Apothecary%20Putress\"&gt;Grand Apothecary Putress&lt;/a&gt; and the dreadlord &lt;a href=\"Varimathras\"&gt;Varimathras&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, however, Vol'jin came into conflict with the Horde's new warchief, &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;. Alienated by the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;'s extremism and lust for war, the troll leader departed Orgrimmar and took up residence on Darkspear Isle. Despite his conflict with the new warchief, Vol'jin remained loyal to the Horde and opposed the efforts of the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; to create a new troll empire in the wake of the Cataclysm.\nBy the time the war between the Alliance and Horde came to the shores of &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, Vol'jin had become a bitter enemy of Garrosh. After surviving an assassination attempt by one of Hellscream's &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron\"&gt;Kor'kron&lt;/a&gt;, Vol'jin went into hiding, while &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Rebellion\"&gt;rallying support&lt;/a&gt; within the Horde itself to end Garrosh's reign. With &lt;a href=\"Garrosh\"&gt;Garrosh&lt;/a&gt;'s defeat and capture, Vol'jin was led to assume the mantle of Warchief of the Horde, with the personal encouragement of &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; as well as the rest of the Horde's leadership, becoming the first non-orc to earn the title. He ruled the Horde until he was mortally wounded during the battle for the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;; though he was evacuated back to Orgrimmar, he succumbed to fel poisoning from his wound. Following the guidance of an unknown force posing as &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt;, with his dying breath he named &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, the queen of the Forsaken, as the new Warchief of the Horde.\nHowever, death would not be the end of Vol'jin's story. Rather than passing peacefully into the care of &lt;a href=\"Bwonsamdi\"&gt;Bwonsamdi&lt;/a&gt;, the loa of death, he was spirited away by a different force. His spirit was reforged and made even more powerful, an act beyond the power of even the &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt;. While his memories of what happened are hidden, he continues to serve and advise the Horde from beyond the grave with all his power. Vol'jin's counsel was valuable during the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, where he helped guide Princess &lt;a href=\"Talanji\"&gt;Talanji&lt;/a&gt; and warned the Horde of the threat that &lt;a href=\"G%27huun\"&gt;G'huun&lt;/a&gt; presented to both Azeroth and the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;.\nHis spirit is eventually called upon to aid the adventurers in &lt;a href=\"Ardenweald\"&gt;Ardenweald&lt;/a&gt;, when &lt;a href=\"Mueh%27zala\"&gt;Mueh'zala&lt;/a&gt; has revealed his schemes for Azeroth. Alongside &lt;a href=\"Bwonsamdi\"&gt;Bwonsamdi&lt;/a&gt;, Vol'jin faces the perils of the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt; before merging his essence with &lt;a href=\"Rezan\"&gt;Rezan&lt;/a&gt;; after the mighty loa is mortally wounded in the Jailer's domain. Returning to Ardenweald, Rezan's power allows for the &lt;a href=\"Winter%20Queen\"&gt;Winter Queen&lt;/a&gt; to offer the former chieftain a chance at resurrection. Accepting, Vol'jin is placed into an anima seed and begins the process of reincarnation in &lt;a href=\"Tirna%20Vaal\"&gt;Tirna Vaal&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nEarly years.\nVol'jin was the son and former apprentice of the &lt;a href=\"jungle%20troll\"&gt;jungle troll&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"witch%20doctor\"&gt;witch doctor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sen%27jin\"&gt;Sen'jin&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the exiled &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear tribe&lt;/a&gt; that lived on the remote &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Islands\"&gt;Darkspear Islands&lt;/a&gt;. He grew up alongside his best friend &lt;a href=\"Zalazane\"&gt;Zalazane&lt;/a&gt;. Because Vol'jin was the son of the Darkspear chieftain, others always considered Vol'jin to be first between them, but he disagreed. He and Zalazane often spoke of it, laughing at the ignorance of those who thought of one as hero and the other as companion. Throughout their entire childhood, Vol'jin and Zalazane ran, fished, wrestled, and built mud forts together. Their first kill was the same beast. Vol'jin once owned a pet as a small child and cried upon its death, while on another occasion he beat an older bully senselessly. Zalazane was present for all of it.\nAt one point, Sen'jin, having had a vision of what was to come, sent Vol'jin into &lt;a href=\"First%20Home\"&gt;First Home&lt;/a&gt; to be tested by the loa and become a &lt;a href=\"shadow%20hunter\"&gt;shadow hunter&lt;/a&gt;. Normally such a young troll would never had been sent here, for many dangers exist even for stronger and more skilled trolls, but time was running short. Vol'jin was unsure of himself and thought with &lt;a href=\"Zalazane\"&gt;Zalazane&lt;/a&gt;, his best friend since birth, that they would be strong together to pass the judgment. During these tests, both trolls were each granted separate visions of a possible future for their people. In those visions, they learned many things, like that they would end up fighting each other to the death. Both the young trolls, having passed the tests and now able to see and commune with the &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt; were now what they sought to become. However, with each step they took, after leaving First Home, memories of what they learned faded and only keeping just a vague sense of what was needed. Returning to their main village, &lt;a href=\"Master%20Gadrin\"&gt;Master Gadrin&lt;/a&gt; revealed that they were out for three months and confirmed what Vol'jin saw in visions \u2014 the coming of the orcs and the death of his father. He then took over the evacuation and prepared to leave.\nJoining the Horde.\nWhile they were in the First Home, for what they thought a week, ended up being three months, the Darkspear tribe was nearly wiped out by a human invasion of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, as well as constant &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt; raids. Only through the timely intervention of Thrall and the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s did any trolls survive. However, eventually the murlocs succeeded in capturing the trolls, orcs, and humans to their underground home. Thrall was able to break free and save many of the imprisoned orcs and trolls and made their way out. As they approached the exit, Sen'jin died bravely in order to save his people and new allies. With Sen'jin's death, Vol'jin became chief shadow hunter for the tribe. In order to repay Thrall for saving his people, Vol'jin pledged his loyalty and service to the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nShortly after the orcs left, a large group of trolls also sailed for Kalimdor, but Vol'jin was not among them. Instead, Vol'jin chose to weather the &lt;a href=\"Zar%27jira\"&gt;Sea Witch&lt;/a&gt;'s wrath with the rest of the tribe until the time came when they could leave. Finally, a year later, they gathered up all the supplies they could and left for the new orc nation of Durotar.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, those of the Darkspear Tribe who were present fought alongside the orcs against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; without their chief, who was still on the Darkspear Isles at the time. After the war, Vol'jin settled the tribe upon the &lt;a href=\"Echo%20Isles\"&gt;Echo Isles&lt;/a&gt;, just off the shores of &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;. It wasn't long before a new threat appeared however, in the form of Grand Admiral &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Daelin Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;'s expeditionary fleet. Vol'jin aided &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rokhan\"&gt;Rokhan&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Chen%20Stormstout\"&gt;Chen Stormstout&lt;/a&gt; in evacuating the Darkspear tribe, turning the three into spirit &lt;a href=\"wyvern\"&gt;wyvern&lt;/a&gt;s allowing them to attack the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; fleet from above, and supplying them with a squadron of troll &lt;a href=\"bat%20rider\"&gt;bat rider&lt;/a&gt;s. Forced to retreat through sheer force of numbers, Vol'jin continued to aid Rexxar and Rokhan through his wise counsel, instructing Rexxar to recruit the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s in the fight against the humans.\nFounding of Sen'jin Village.\nAfter helping the Horde stop the human invasion, Vol'jin led his tribe back to the Echo Isles. It was not to last, however, as a witch doctor named &lt;a href=\"Zalazane\"&gt;Zalazane&lt;/a&gt; used dark magic to enslave many of his Darkspear brethren, forcing Vol'jin to order the retreat to the mainland for fear his whole tribe would fall victim to the mad witch doctor. Vol'jin then founded &lt;a href=\"Sen%27jin%20Village\"&gt;Sen'jin Village&lt;/a&gt; along the southern coast of Durotar as a base with which to strike back at Zalazane. However, he was called to Orgrimmar to aid Thrall, leaving the recapture of his people's home to &lt;a href=\"Master%20Gadrin\"&gt;Master Gadrin&lt;/a&gt;. Though raids by the Kul Tiras marines persist in the Barrens and Durotar, these invasions are lesser threats and not directly aimed at Sen'jin Village.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nVol'jin resided at Thrall's fortress in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, assisting the Warchief with sound advice, helping to expand the Horde's security and influence over Kalimdor and witty stratagems such as the capture of &lt;a href=\"Trol%27kalar\"&gt;Trol'kalar&lt;/a&gt; for use against the trolls of Stranglethorn, all the while he was guiding his people to a better future.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"Brewfest\"&gt;Brewfest&lt;/a&gt;, Vol'jin used to ride out of the city to the festival grounds at 6 a.m and 6 p.m each day for the ceremonial &lt;a href=\"Brewfest%23Tapping%20of%20the%20Keg\"&gt;tapping of the keg&lt;/a&gt;. Players present when he did this would receive a 2 hours \"Brewfest Enthusiast\" &lt;a href=\"buff\"&gt;buff&lt;/a&gt; that increases &lt;a href=\"Experience%20point\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; gained by 10%.\nBattle for the Undercity.\nVol'jin was called upon to serve during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Undercity\"&gt;Battle for the Undercity&lt;/a&gt;. He maintained his position outside the gates of the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Ruins of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; atop his &lt;a href=\"raptor\"&gt;raptor&lt;/a&gt; with the artillery and several &lt;a href=\"grunt\"&gt;grunt&lt;/a&gt;s until &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; arrived. There he remained to send any &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s that followed after the Warchief to help reclaim the Undercity.\nThe Glory of the Darkspears.\nAfter many attempts by &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to reclaim the &lt;a href=\"Echo%20Isles\"&gt;Echo Isles&lt;/a&gt;, Vol'jin came up with a plan to defeat &lt;a href=\"Zalazane\"&gt;Zalazane&lt;/a&gt; and reclaim the isles for the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear trolls&lt;/a&gt;. After sounding the call to arms Vol'jin was joined by &lt;a href=\"Witch%20Doctor%20Hez%27tok\"&gt;Witch Doctor Hez'tok&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vanira\"&gt;Vanira&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Champion%20Uru%27zin\"&gt;Champion Uru'zin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zild%27jian\"&gt;Zild'jian&lt;/a&gt; and other members of the Horde who used Sen'jin Village as the staging ground for the &lt;a href=\"Zalazane%27s%20Fall\"&gt;Liberation of the Echo Isles&lt;/a&gt;. Vol'jin's forces, gathered to combat Zalazane, were reinforced after Vanira's frog spies and Horde adventurers were able to find and recruit &lt;a href=\"Zen%27tabra\"&gt;Zen'tabra&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, Champion Uru'zin and Horde adventurers were able to convince more &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Citizen\"&gt;Darkspear citizens&lt;/a&gt; to aid in the liberation of the Echo Isles.\nAfter having Witch Doctor Hez'tok talk to the spirits, Vol'jin was told to make amends with the Darkspear Loa &lt;a href=\"Bwonsamdi\"&gt;Bwonsamdi&lt;/a&gt;. Seeing the wisdom in the spirit's plan and seeing his forces prepared Vol'jin called for the assault on the Echo Isles to begin. Vol'jin first led his forces in calling forth and subsequently proving their worth to Bwonsamdi. Vol'jin then moved his forces to the other isles and killed &lt;a href=\"Jun%27do%20the%20Traitor\"&gt;Jun'do the Traitor&lt;/a&gt;, while Bwonsamdi told the spirits of the Darkspear to rise and take up the ancient masks and bloody spears and that they will serve and aid Vol'jin. With only one isle left remaining to conquer Vol'jin warns his forces that Zalazane is a tricky foe who is cunning and strong with the voodoo. Vol'jin then leads the charge against his former friend.\nAfter a fierce battle, Zalazane flees and Zen'tabra discovers his location after turning into a bat, then quickly informs Vol'jin and warns him that Zalazane was working some black magic. Vol'jin, perhaps in an act of mercy for his former friend, offers Zalazane the chance to surrender only for Zalazane to reveal that he has lured Vol'jin's strike force into a trap and quickly gains control of the Darkspear warriors and forces them to fight Vol'jin and the rest of the Horde strike force. After seeing his trap fail Zalazane says that it doesn't matter as no living thing can make its way through his barrier and as such the Echo Isles will be his rule forever. Vol'jin then witnesses Bwonsamdi appearing who tells Zalazane that the dead Darkspear are his domain. Vol'jin then bears witness to Bwonsamdi raising the dead to kill Zalazane.\nVol'jin remarks that it is a fitting end for a troll so foul and thanks Bwonsamdi for his aid who tells him to care and mentions that he wait for him on the &lt;a href=\"Other%20Side\"&gt;Other Side&lt;/a&gt;. Zen'tabra then mentions that her fate is now entwined with Vol'jin's. Vol'jin then prepares for the reconstruction of the Echo Isles.\nElemental Unrest.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Unrest\"&gt;Elemental Unrest&lt;/a&gt; he was present at the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Unrest%20meetings\"&gt;Elemental Unrest meeting&lt;/a&gt;, which involved a harsh conversation between Garrosh and Vol'jin concerning his presence in the &lt;a href=\"War%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;War against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;. Garrosh claimed that during the war Vol'jin merely &lt;a href=\"Zalazane%27s%20Fall\"&gt;took back&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href=\"Echo%20Isles\"&gt;few scattered islands&lt;/a&gt;. Vol'jin also defended the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Spirits\"&gt;Valley of Spirits&lt;/a&gt; from invading elementals.\nThe Shattering: Prelude to Cataclysm.\nVol'jin was one of the countless witnesses for the &lt;a href=\"mak%27gora\"&gt;mak'gora&lt;/a&gt; duel between Warchief &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; and High Chieftain &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;. Following Garrosh's victory, Vol'jin had concerns that something was amiss due to how easily Cairne died and shared his concerns with &lt;a href=\"Eitrigg\"&gt;Eitrigg&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nVol\u2019jin has come into conflict with the Horde\u2019s new warchief, &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;. Alienated by the orc\u2019s extremism and lust for war, the troll leader and his tribe has departed Orgrimmar and taken up residence on &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Isle\"&gt;Darkspear Isle&lt;/a&gt;. He is involved with many of the troll starting area quests, one of which shows a vision of the spat between himself and Garrosh Hellscream in &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hold\"&gt;Grommash Hold&lt;/a&gt;, using some sort of incense over a brazier: Garrosh came into conflict with Vol'jin, Garrosh's relationship with him breaking down in a similar manner to that of &lt;a href=\"Cairne\"&gt;Cairne&lt;/a&gt; - culminating with Vol'jin threatening to kill him for his thirst for war. Dissatisfied with Garrosh's leadership, Vol'jin led his tribe in a mass exodus to &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Isle\"&gt;Darkspear Isle&lt;/a&gt;. \nThere they came under assault from their Ancient Enemy &lt;a href=\"Zar%27jira\"&gt;Zar'jira&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Naga%20sea%20witch\"&gt;Naga sea witch&lt;/a&gt; responsible for &lt;a href=\"Sen%27jin\"&gt;Sen'jin&lt;/a&gt;'s death, and her &lt;a href=\"Spitescale\"&gt;Spitescale&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Naga\"&gt;Naga&lt;/a&gt;. Rather than flee as the Darkspear did before Vol'jin decided to take the Naga head on and called for an attack on the Naga that had taken over the northern isle before confronting &lt;a href=\"Zar%27jira\"&gt;Zar'jira&lt;/a&gt; to avenge his father's death by slaying her. Utilizing the immense power that burst from her when she died Vol'jin contacted Thrall to seek his council. Though Vol'jin considered leading his people away, following Thrall's council, Vol'jin agreed to stay for the sake of the Horde; relenting that Garrosh's intentions are at the very least, noble.\nThe Rise of the Zandalari.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Zul\"&gt;Zul&lt;/a&gt; called for a meeting of all troll tribes, Vol'jin attended along with &lt;a href=\"Jin%27do\"&gt;Jin'do&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20tribe\"&gt;Gurubashi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Daakara\"&gt;Daakara&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt; and an unknown ice troll leader. There the tribe leaders were informed that &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Farrak\"&gt;Zul'Farrak&lt;/a&gt; is now a barren wastelands and that &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Drak\"&gt;Zul'Drak&lt;/a&gt; has fallen to the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. Zul then said that the troll tribes must unite to form a new troll empire. He enticed both Jin'do and Daakara with promises of restoring &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Gurub\"&gt;Zul'Gurub&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt; to their former glory. As the other trolls agreed to join the Zandalari, Vol'jin began to walk away and only stopped when asked if he would betray his people. Vol'jin retorted that the Horde is his people and promised to &lt;a href=\"War%20against%20the%20Zandalari\"&gt;stop&lt;/a&gt; the Zandalari should they bring war to the land.\nFollowing this Vol'jin sent Darkspear emissaries to both Orgrimmar and &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, knowing that the Horde alone could not stop the Zandalari. Vol'jin later met with the &lt;a href=\"Ranger-general%20of%20Silvermoon\"&gt;Ranger-general of Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Halduron%20Brightwing\"&gt;Halduron Brightwing&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Vereesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Vereesa Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; to deal with the Amani in Zul'Aman. Vol'jin told them that the Zandalari were seeking to create a new troll empire, reaching out to all of the troll tribes, including the Amani and his own Darkspear tribe \u2014 the likes of which would be a grave threat if not immediately dealt with. Knowing that the Amani could become a great threat to all of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, Halduron and Vereesa resolved to join forces, which has allowed Halduron's Farstriders and Vereesa's rangers and Vol'jin's &lt;a href=\"Atal-Mhuto\"&gt;Atal-Mhuto&lt;/a&gt; to keep the Amani contained within Zul'Aman.\nVol'jin then traveled to &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt; and gave the Horde and Alliance forces there a heads up about the Gurubashi in the region. Vol'jin later traveled to &lt;a href=\"Booty%20Bay\"&gt;Booty Bay&lt;/a&gt; and informed &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Revilgaz\"&gt;Baron Revilgaz&lt;/a&gt; of the Gurubashi threat.\nWith the Gurubashi pushed back into Gurubashi, Vol'jin has ordered the Atal-Mhuto to keep them contained within Zul'Gurub, while he personally led the assault against the Amani in Zul'Aman, where with the aid of adventurers, put an end to Daakara and the Zandalari's efforts within Zul'Aman.\nJaina Proudmoore: Tides of War.\nWhen Warchief Hellscream called for a meeting of the Horde leaders, Vol'jin answered the call. When he learned of the planned attack on &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore Isle&lt;/a&gt; Vol'jin remained silent but when Garrosh mentioned that the attack on Theramore would lead to pushing the Night Elves out of Kalimdor the Darkspear spoke. Vol'jin pointed out that the Night Elves were present on Kalimdor long before the Horde and that trying to force them out would give the Alliance the excuse they needed to be over them like bees over honey. After the meeting ended Vol'jin and &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; conversed quietly where the tauren was informed of &lt;a href=\"Malkorok\"&gt;Malkorok&lt;/a&gt;'s, Garrosh's new bodyguard, past. When Baine showed his displeasure of Garrosh letting a &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock clan&lt;/a&gt; orc and a former servant of &lt;a href=\"Rend%20Blackhand\"&gt;Rend Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; into the Horde, Vol'jin pointed out that he let members of the &lt;a href=\"Grimtotem%20tribe\"&gt;Grimtotem tribe&lt;/a&gt; into the Horde. When Baine responded that he thought better of tauren over orcs, Vol'jin mentions that in these days he did too.\nVol'jin then personally led his Darkspear in the attack on &lt;a href=\"Northwatch%20Hold\"&gt;Northwatch Hold&lt;/a&gt;. He met with Tauren forces, under Baine's command, at the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Gate\"&gt;Great Gate&lt;/a&gt; and co-led Troll and Tauren forces across the Barrens to Northwatch. After a fierce battle, Northwatch fell to the might of the Horde. Following the victory, members of the Horde (most notably Vol'jin, Baine, &lt;a href=\"Kelantir%20Bloodblade\"&gt;Kelantir Bloodblade&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Frandis%20Farley\"&gt;Frandis Farley&lt;/a&gt;) grew frustrated and confused with Garrosh's decision to remain at Northwatch instead of pressing the attack; as Theramore was having enough time to gather reinforcements that would make the conquest of Theramore even harder. With Garrosh refusing to see anyone, Vol'jin and the others had a secret meeting to discuss exactly what the Warchief was thinking. However, &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Zixx%20Grindergear\"&gt;treachery from within&lt;/a&gt; tipped Garrosh of the meeting. It wasn't until Vol'jin voiced the concern that the enslaved elements could lead to the elements themselves taking arms against the Horde, that it was discovered they were being watched. While Malkorok clearly wanted to harm them, Garrosh took no action against them (besides hitting Bloodblade, for personally questioning him), and emphasizing that their loyalty belongs to the Horde. Vol'jin was among those who bowed when Garrosh left, after being told to return to their encampments.\nLater on, Vol'jin and Baine were granted a meeting with Garrosh and both noticed that Malkorok was also present. The three leaders of the Horde had a polite conversation before Baine began to address his concerns and questioning Garrosh why it seems that he only listens to the Blackrock orc. After witnessing Malkorok being told to stand down, Garrosh mentions he had orders for the fleet while turning to Baine and Vol'jin. Feeling hopeful that Garrosh was either beginning the attack on Theramore or letting them in on his plan, both the troll and tauren were stunned when Garrosh's order was for the fleet to withdraw. As they left to carry out his orders, Baine told Garrosh he hoped a Horde would be left over this debacle. As they were leaving, the Darkspear and Tauren leaders heard loud laughter from both their Warchief and his bodyguard.\nWhen Garrosh finally began the attack on Theramore, Vol'jin not only led his trolls into battle but was chosen along with Baine to be a part of Garrosh's personal attack force on Theramore's North Gate. During the attack, Vol'jin realized that not only was there a dragon, &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt;, aiding in the defense of Theramore but he was also trying to trap the Horde forces in order to prevent any possible retreat. After making his way to Baine and Garrosh, who were battling fairly close to one another, Vol'jin informed them exactly what the dragon was doing. When Garrosh recalled a retreat, Vol'jin quickly repeated his order which was carried out by all nearby Horde forces. Though Vol'jin himself noticed that the blood lust of his Darkspear warriors made them reluctant to stop attacking. With the battle for Theramore seemingly lost, Vol'jin was among those who came before Garrosh as he gazed at Theramore from the bridge of &lt;a href=\"Dustwallow%20Bay\"&gt;Dustwallow Bay&lt;/a&gt;. It was there that the truth about the attack on Theramore was revealed to them. The attack was never meant to destroy the stronghold; it was meant to weaken and gather high ranking leaders of the Alliance, such as &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"General%20Marcus%20Jonathan\"&gt;General Marcus Jonathan&lt;/a&gt;, together for one reason: so a mana bomb could not only destroy the city but kill all those who came to its defense. A move that Garrosh claimed would weaken the Alliance. Shortly afterward, the gathered Horde forces bore witness to the mana bomb destroying Theramore, much to the cheers of many and the disgust and outrage of others: Vol'jin being among the later.\nAs Garrosh and many of the Horde celebrated in Orgrimmar, Vol'jin and others such as Baine, Kelantir Bloodblade, and Frandis Farley gathered in Razor Hill and grumbled about the Warchief and discussed their true thoughts on the destruction of Theramore. Soon afterward, Malkorok and members of the &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron\"&gt;Kor'kron&lt;/a&gt; blew up the Razor Hill Inn, killing those inside like Bloodbade and Farley, who had questioned the Warchief and dubbed it an accident. When Vol'jin heard of the \"accident\", he had enough and decided to head back to his home on the &lt;a href=\"Echo%20Isles\"&gt;Echo Isles&lt;/a&gt;. However, as he was heading home he was met by a Darkspear runner who informed him that the Alliance fleet was heading to Orgrimmar.\nVol'jin was next seen after the battle. After the Alliance fleet was pushed back and the Horde-controlled &lt;a href=\"kraken\"&gt;kraken&lt;/a&gt; were killed, Vol'jin received news that not only was Northwatch retaken, but the Alliance fleet was en route to destroy the Horde blockade. He then bore witness to Garrosh ordering the coastal blockade of Kalimdor to fall back. Baine was pleased with this decision, viewing it as Garrosh giving up on his plans for conquest. To his horror, however, Garrosh stated that his plan has changed: instead of expelling the Alliance from Kalimdor, Garrosh now aimed to wage a war of total genocide. After bearing witness, Baine declared that Garrosh would lose his support if another Theramore should happen. The tauren and troll locked eyes. While disagreeing with Garrosh but needing to protect his people, Vol'jin glanced sadly at Baine and gave him a nearly imperceptible shake of his head. In turn, Baine nodded his head showing his understanding of Vol'jin's plight.\nWith a world war on the horizon, Vol'jin then journeyed back to the Echo Isles to plan his next move.\nLandfall.\nRoughly two months after the initial foray into Pandaria, Garrosh himself arrives with the bulk of the Horde fleet and quickly goes about removing the local Alliance presence along the shores of Krasarang. Garrosh and Vol'jin have yet another clash of opinions about his warmongering at the newly-constructed &lt;a href=\"Domination%20Point\"&gt;Domination Point&lt;/a&gt;, resulting in Garrosh, long-tested by the Darkspear chieftain's criticism, ordering his rival's outright murder (under the guise of Vol'jin being sent on a &lt;a href=\"Dagger%20in%20the%20Dark\"&gt;mission&lt;/a&gt; with the Kor'kron). Vol'jin survives the attempt on his life and instructs heroes to report his death to Garrosh and remain close to the warchief \u2013 biding their time and finding other like-minded members of the Horde to save their coalition before Garrosh's rule destroys it. Vol'jin has also entrusted this task to &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome time afterward, he ends up caught in a river and is rescued by &lt;a href=\"Chen%20Stormstout\"&gt;Chen Stormstout&lt;/a&gt;, who is troubled by his state. After Chen and the Horde champions help Vol'jin gain strength he sends them to find Thrall, handing over his own &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin%27s%20Hearthstone\"&gt;hearthstone&lt;/a&gt; (which is tied to &lt;a href=\"The%20Den\"&gt;The Den&lt;/a&gt; in Durotar). While Vol'jin recovers his allies free the Darkspear trolls on the Echo Isles from the Kor'kron, who under Garrosh's orders have declared martial law, with Thrall deciding to stand in and work with them until Vol'jin returns. Soon afterward, Chen takes Vol'jin to Shado-pan Monastery to recuperate. Vol'jin receives word from Baine about how Garrosh is capturing &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; and using the &lt;a href=\"Sha\"&gt;Sha&lt;/a&gt;. In a secret letter sent to Horde champions Vol'jin reveals that he is worried that Garrosh doesn't trust Baine and instructs them to keep Baine out of trouble while reminding them that Garrosh trusts them.\nVol'jin later learns about how both the Horde and Alliance are trying to obtain the &lt;a href=\"%3ADivine%20Bell\"&gt;:Divine Bell&lt;/a&gt;. While he doesn't want Hellscream to have the artifact Vol'jin concludes that he would be more comfortable with the bell in Horde hands. After learning about &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina&lt;/a&gt; purging the Horde out of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, in a message to his allies Vol'jin remarks that Garrosh has changed the Jaina he knew. Vol'jin also learns about the breakdown of relations between &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar\"&gt;Lor'themar&lt;/a&gt; and Garrosh and plans to approach the regent lord for a \"talk\" when he is able to.\nShadows of the Horde.\nTeetering on the brink of death from the attempt on his life, Vol'jin fought his way out of the &lt;a href=\"saurok\"&gt;saurok&lt;/a&gt; cave, only to come to the grim realization that his wounds would not mend. Garrosh had planned his assassination well: Vol'jin's &lt;a href=\"Regeneration%20%28racial%29\"&gt;natural healing&lt;/a&gt; was disabled by Rak'gor's poison, and the Darkspear chieftain narrowly survived local saurok ambushes while fleeing the scene. Succumbing to his wounds, Vol'jin was granted an audience on the other side with &lt;a href=\"Bwonsamdi\"&gt;Bwonsamdi&lt;/a&gt; and his father, &lt;a href=\"Sen%27jin\"&gt;Sen'jin&lt;/a&gt;, each eager to see whether Vol'jin would cross over. The great &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt; suggested that Vol'jin's drive to live for his people's safety was a flaw -- that Vol'jin would do well to embrace his nature as a troll and embark on bloody conquest rather than merely securing his borders. Though tempted by the prospect, having witnessed the horrors of fleshshaping within the saurok cave (and the corruption that any mortal with this dread power would likely suffer), he denies himself the power. Amused by his reaction, and ultimately pleased that Vol'jin had not given in to death's embrace so easily, Bwonsamdi sends him back to the realm of the living with a vision of the trolls' great past, when the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Empire\"&gt;Zandalari Empire&lt;/a&gt; stood at its zenith.\nUnconscious and drifting down the outside river, Vol'jin was found by a group of &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; cubs, who hastily informed &lt;a href=\"Chen%20Stormstout\"&gt;Chen Stormstout&lt;/a&gt; that a \"monster\" was nearby. Aghast at his good friend's state, Chen rushed him to the safety of &lt;a href=\"Binan%20Village\"&gt;Binan Village&lt;/a&gt;, and then to the nearby &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan%20Monastery\"&gt;Shado-Pan Monastery&lt;/a&gt;. Vol'jin awoke under the Shado-Pan's care, but he was not alone \u2013 a &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; hunter named &lt;a href=\"Tyrathan%20Khort\"&gt;Tyrathan Khort&lt;/a&gt; had also been found by Chen some time before, and the two were slated to \"heal\" together so that the pandaren could better understand the conflict between them and what resolution they could manage. Under the watchful eye of &lt;a href=\"Taran%20Zhu\"&gt;Taran Zhu&lt;/a&gt;, the man and troll aided one another with tasks both menial and essential, including games of &lt;a href=\"Jihui\"&gt;Jihui&lt;/a&gt;, a native board game where the objective was not necessarily to win, but for both players to arrive at a satisfactory conclusion. As Vol'jin began the healing process, he and Tyrathan came to the mutual understanding that the only way forward was to work in tandem, grudgingly or otherwise.\nVol'jin was continually mocked with visions from Bwonsamdi, quizzing the Darkspear chieftain with questions about himself and his place in Azeroth.\nVol'jin began training with the pandaren monks, regaining his strength one step at a time. They took to calling him \"Vol'jian\" -- a nickname of multiple meanings that slid off their tongues more easily -- and watched as he engaged in Taran Zhu's trials, such as slicing through stone slabs with his bare hands, devoid of doubt.\nSoon after, a vicious snowstorm engulfed the north, while Tyrathan was away on his frequent journeys up the mountainside. Vol'jin attempted to go after him, though Zhu refused this demand; still recovering as he was, Vol'jin would likely be walking into an icy deathtrap. Instead, Zhu instructed him to keep up with his \"chores,\" and to ponder a question: whether Vol'jin's concern was for the human's well-being or the image he would gain by rescuing him. Tyrathan was soon after found by the monks, albeit near death and battered by the blizzard. Here, Vol'jin had his first encounter with the insidious &lt;a href=\"sha\"&gt;sha&lt;/a&gt;: the true demons halting him from recovery. In this instance, sha of doubt were gripping the human's soul, and Vol'jin undertook a &lt;a href=\"Memory%20Wine\"&gt;Memory Wine&lt;/a&gt; ritual to free him from it. Stepping into the man's shoes, Vol'jin witnessed Tyrathan's comrades and fellow hunters undertake a mission to the &lt;a href=\"Serpent%27s%20Heart\"&gt;Serpent's Heart&lt;/a&gt;. There, Tyrathan's company was overrun and butchered by the sha, including a woman whom Vol'jin suspected the human had been close to. Tyrathan's intense guilt and doubt over her death gave Vol'jin his opening, and the shadow hunter assailed the sha threading all around his human companion. Vol'jin was successful in freeing him from this doubt, banishing enough of the sha to save the man's life.\nTyrathan and Vol'jin conversed after their shared memory, and the human was more forthcoming with questions he had avoided before. He revealed that he had indeed \"died\" at Serpent's Heart -- he was no longer the same man after he had crawled from its wreckage, just as Vol'jin was no longer the man he was after escaping the saurok cave and awakening at the monastery. However, the question of who both of them were now unsettled the pair. Vol'jin promised that if he found a way to conquer this particular fear, he would share the knowledge.\nThe loa had been distant since Vol'jin stepped into the human's mind. Vol'jin surmised that it was linked to either his faith or his experience in the human's body, though he knew deep down that he still revered his gods, if not as brutally as some other followers of the loa. He was eventually treated to visions from both &lt;a href=\"Hir%27eek\"&gt;Hir'eek&lt;/a&gt;, the loa of bats, and &lt;a href=\"Shadra\"&gt;Elortha no Shadra&lt;/a&gt;, the Venom Queen, proving he was not forgotten. As it happens, he was &lt;a href=\"Zandalari\"&gt;not the only force&lt;/a&gt; attempting to appease the loa on Pandaria.\nOver time, Tyrathan and Vol'jin came to understand one another a little better. As it happens, this was not the first time the two had been in close proximity: Tyrathan was dispatched to serve &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Daelin Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;'s forces against Thrall's burgeoning Horde, and several of his comrades had intended to slay Vol'jin then and there, to no avail. The two discussed what it means to have left their past selves behind. During a conversation between the two, Vol'jin was granted yet another vision, this time of a &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;hidden northern island&lt;/a&gt; and a Zandalari fleet both docking into it and incoming southwards, towards &lt;a href=\"Zouchin%20Village\"&gt;Zouchin Village&lt;/a&gt;. Taran Zhu, Chen, Vol'jin, and Tyrathan strategized their next move, and the latter three were assigned to a group of eighteen to halt the Zandalari advance and rescue Zouchin. Garbed in ill-fitting pandaren armor, Vol'jin and his human companion left for the town.\nVol'jin spearheaded the defense of Zouchin along with Tyrathan, breaking the siege on the village and pulling back before taking needless casualties. Several of the trolls were aghast that one of their own kind would be fighting against them, and Vol'jin used this shock to his advantage. Though he cut through a great deal, he was caught off-guard and cornered by a Zandalari warrior, taking several wounds; however, Tyrathan saved his life, impaling the Zandalari from afar. The groups retreated back and planned their next move, reading the Zandalari advance to get a better idea of where they would strike next, while the surrounding villages began to evacuate.\nIn a conversation with Taran Zhu, Vol'jin began to question just who he is and who he's become once more -- Chieftain Vol'jin of the Darkspear, leader of the Horde, or simply a troll. That night, he was approached once more by Bwonsamdi, though this time Vol'jin's answers to his questions pleased the great loa. Bwonsamdi revealed that the visions Vol'jin had received from the other loa were to remind of what it means to be a troll and that his vision from Shadra (typically a matron loa of the Zandalari) was to pit him against her followers for reasons unclear, perhaps to spur them to better please her. Bwonsamdi thanked Vol'jin for sending him so many new trolls to place under his \"care\" in the afterlife and bestowed upon him something Vol'jin had lost: his innate ability to regenerate, the gift given to all trolls. With parting words, Vol'jin promised to send him far more Zandalari before this conflict is done, and began to heal to his full potential.\nMost of Vol'jin's severe wounds began to heal over with his troll regeneration back, though he chose to leave a slight portion of his throat slit to deepen and slightly change his voice, so as to make it different to the troll he had been -- the troll who had fallen for Garrosh's ploy.\nFor their services in the defense of Zouchin, Taran Zhu commissioned the stone likenesses of Vol'jin and Tyrathan to be engraved into a mountain of Pandaria, the same honor given to distinguished monks of the &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan\"&gt;Shado-Pan&lt;/a&gt;. Rumors of Vol'jin's demise started to spread throughout the wider world: some members of the Horde believed that the Darkspear chieftain fell heroically against native enemies in service of the Warchief; others believed that he was targeted personally and assassinated. Some clung to the hope that he still lived, though these were few. In honor of his memory, several Horde members tattooed themselves with dark spears.\nTo halt the Zandalari advance, Vol'jin, Chen, and Tyrathan were tasked with venturing to the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt;, to stop the Zandalari from reviving their slumbering &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; allies. Though practically a suicide mission (seven of them against unknown phalanxes of Zandalari), Vol'jin and Tyrathan admitted that they are dead men anyway. The man and troll reflected on their past and futures during the journey; Vol'jin was amused that the two of them could grow so close, despite the long years of hatred standing between their races. According to Tyrathan, no one in the world would believe that the two had formed a bond of friendship and now fought alongside one another in defense of a land they had no true attachment to, and that he would be tried for treason and executed if his friendship with Vol'jin was ever discovered.\nVol'jin was granted another vision by the Venom Queen, this time of the ancient alliance between the Zandalari and the mogu, a vision of an age long before any he had seen before. Vol'jin came to realize what it was that drove these two forces apart: the mutual arrogance that they were stronger than their counterpart. Both empires fell for different reasons; the Zandalari empire grew weak with its fracturing tribes and infighting, while the mogu were toppled and overthrown by the servants they had grown to rely upon. He awoke with a single spider web nestled atop his face.\nTyrathan and Vol'jin spotted a Zandalari camp nearby, complete with a group of captured Alliance scouts being tortured. Tyrathan insisted that he remain behind and help them from the shadows, and after some convincing, Vol'jin decided to help. After freeing the group from their captivity, the group's leader demanded to know where Tyrathan Knort was hiding, recognizing the fighting style of their hidden savior. Vol'jin, protecting his friend's identity, denied keeping the company of such, and says that he, Vol'jin of the Darkspear tribe, a leader of the Horde, had personally killed the man. The scouts are stunned to learn that Vol'jin himself still lived, aware of the rumors spreading of his apparent death. Vol'jin let them flee back to safety.\nThe group was ambushed by a Zandalari raid headed by &lt;a href=\"Khal%27ak\"&gt;Khal'ak&lt;/a&gt;, having lured Vol'jin into the open. Khal'ak had captured, subdued, and bound Tyrathan, though offered to let him live in return for Vol'jin's surrender and compliance. He warily agreed.\nTo Vol'jin's immense surprise, his ruthless host meant him no ill will. The two took raptors to a hidden house near &lt;a href=\"Mogu%27shan%20Palace\"&gt;Mogu'shan Palace&lt;/a&gt;, where Vol'jin was groomed and honored (albeit grudgingly) as an esteemed shadow hunter and leader of the Darkspear tribe. Khal'ak ordered him to be bathed and dressed in fine clothing, and the two discussed his predicament over wine and food. Khal'ak had recognized him from &lt;a href=\"King%20Rastakhan\"&gt;King Rastakhan&lt;/a&gt;'s troll gathering after the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, and had witnessed Vol'jin decline the offer of a great troll alliance. She did not fault him for this choice -- the Darkspear tribe had thrived under his leadership, and had suffered none of the downfalls of the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20tribe\"&gt;Gurubashi&lt;/a&gt;. Khal'ak once more offered him the choice he had turned away from, though this time sweetened the notion: in return for his allegiance, the Darkspear tribe would be propelled to the first tribe of the Zandalari, above all others. Vol'jin considered this offer, and with the reason he had declined Rastakhan's offer in the first place no longer applicable in the wake of Garrosh's treachery, he admitted his interest in it.\nIn return for his cooperation, Khal'ak ensured the safety of Vol'jin's companions. After witnessing the resurrection of &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Kao\"&gt;Warlord Kao&lt;/a&gt;, the gathered trolls traveled back to the palace and left for the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Isle of Thunder&lt;/a&gt;. Here, Vol'jin met with Khal'ak's superior, &lt;a href=\"Vilnak%27dor\"&gt;Vilnak'dor&lt;/a&gt;, and convinced him of his use to the cause. Vol'jin later admitted to Khal'ak that they would need to dispose of him to smoothly transition the Darkspear into this new alliance.\nIn truth, Vol'jin's experiences thus far had compelled him to make quite the opposite decision: he was a shadow hunter, the leader of the Darkspear tribe, and a Horde leader; Garrosh's treachery had not been to further the Horde's goals, but only his own. Vol'jin reflected that the Horde is a family and that it falls to him to protect that family from Hellscream's ambitions. While he \"had\" considered Khal'ak's offer, the fact remained that the Darkspear had thrived not by struggling in vain to recreate an empire whose romanticized zeniths they had never truly known, but by working with the reality of the world and carving out a place in it.\nVol'jin returned to his companions and helped them break out of their captivity. Under the cover of nightfall, they escaped the Zandalari encampment and procured an escape back to Pandaria's mainland via a fishing boat. After returning to the monastery, Vol'jin informed Taran Zhu of what had transpired, and that the Zandalari would next target the monastery. He insisted that the Shado-Pan needed to evacuate, though Zhu opted to stand and fight their ground instead. Vol'jin, Tyrathan, and Chen swore themselves to this task too, and the monastery's thirty-three defenders were aptly named &lt;a href=\"The%20Thirty-three\"&gt;The Thirty-three&lt;/a&gt;. Vol'jin prepared a number of traps to halt the Zandalari advance, and spoke with Tyrathan before the battle. While both were certain that they would meet death in this battle, they chose not to cement their grisly fates with goodbyes. Instead, Tyrathan offered to fletch the arrow that Vol'jin would use to kill Garrosh, and Vol'jin promised to hold him to it. The monks also forged a personal glaive for Vol'jin, to replace the one he had lost during his ordeal in the saurok cave.\nWhile the Zandalari army had been fettered by Vol'jin and Tyrathan's traps and further hampered by a snowstorm swirling near the monastery, they pressed their numerical advantage and fast closed in on the temple. Vol'jin himself strode out to meet them, alone and offered a &lt;a href=\"Duel\"&gt;challenge by honorable combat&lt;/a&gt; to any who desired to pass him. His opponent was a towering mogu named &lt;a href=\"Deng-Tai\"&gt;Deng-Tai&lt;/a&gt;, wielding a ferocious longspear. Vol'jin held his own against his bulkier opponent, though mid-battle the Zandalari commander ordered the army to overwhelm Vol'jin and charge forward. As the tide turned against him, Chen and several monks arrived to help relieve the battle, though the group was heavily outmatched and forced to flee inwards. Regrouping inside, Vol'jin could see no sign of Tyrathan, and the survivors -- now fourteen from thirty-three -- were set upon by the Zandalari invaders once more.\nVol'jin fought and killed Khal'ak's captain in the ensuing chaos, though was immediately attacked by another mogu, preparing to impale Vol'jin with his spear. Tyrathan hurled him out of the way and took the heavy blow meant for him. Taran Zhu fought off and defeated the mogu, while Vol'jin identified and did battle with a vengeful Khal'ak. His enemy was agile and vicious and fought with the belief that she could read Vol'jin's moves and act accordingly. To counter her, Vol'jin eschewed his usual fighting style and instead made use of his &lt;a href=\"monk\"&gt;monk&lt;/a&gt; training with the Shado-Pan. He surged forward and caught Khal'ak off-guard, and shattered her from the neck-up with a powerful fist blow.\nLeaderless and stunned by the resistance, the surviving Zandalari began to flee the scene. Vol'jin swore to save Tyrathan despite the man's desire to die and invoked healing to mend his wound. Vol'jin contacted Bwonsamdi to bargain for his friend's life; with some convincing, the great loa agreed, and Tyrathan was set on a road to recovery not dissimilar to the one Vol'jin had endured. Vol'jin watched over Tyrathan during the healing process, and the two spoke once more when the time was right. Vol'jin reminded Tyrathan of his earlier offer, and the human promised to be there to fletch that arrow for Vol'jin to dispose of Garrosh with. The two parted as friends; with the life Vol'jin had helped preserve, Tyrathan aimed to try and reconcile with his family, while Vol'jin prepared to do the same with &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;his own&lt;/a&gt;.\nEscalation.\nVol'jin came into contact with the regent lord of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;, and earned his support to strike against and overthrow Garrosh. Returning to Durotar, Vol'jin learned that his people had been put under martial law by the &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron\"&gt;Kor'kron&lt;/a&gt;; with Lor'themar finishing up on the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Isle of Thunder&lt;/a&gt; (and across the ocean besides), Vol'jin was forced to declare &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Rebellion\"&gt;open rebellion&lt;/a&gt; against Garrosh preemptively, and based himself in &lt;a href=\"Sen%27jin%20Village\"&gt;Sen'jin Village&lt;/a&gt;. After speaking with both &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chen%20Stormstout\"&gt;Chen&lt;/a&gt;, Vol'jin sent &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to gather supplies from Garrosh's &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron\"&gt;Kor'kron forces&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Barrens\"&gt;Northern Barrens&lt;/a&gt;. Upon receiving the supplies, Vol'jin discovered that the Kor'kron had begun their attack on the village and after a fierce battle Vol'jin and his forces beat the invaders back. With Sen'jin Village secure, Vol'jin went to begin the march on &lt;a href=\"Razor%20Hill\"&gt;Razor Hill&lt;/a&gt; before it was fortified, when Thrall stopped him and announced his plan to go to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;. While Vol'jin protested that they needed him, Thrall was adamant about finding orcs who were against Hellscream such as &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Eitrigg\"&gt;Eitrigg&lt;/a&gt;. In a last attempt to stop Thrall, Vol'jin bluntly told him that Garrosh's forces would kill him. However, Thrall pointed out that that was a chance that he was willing to take to see that not all of his people were behind Hellscream. Thrall then asked Vol'jin to look after &lt;a href=\"Aggra\"&gt;Aggra&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Durak\"&gt;son&lt;/a&gt; if he didn't make it, a promise that the shadow hunter agreed to.\nAfter watching Thrall leave, Vol'jin rallied his forces at Sen'jin Village and personally lead the attack on Razor Hill. After the Kor'kron presence was eliminated, the people of Razor Hill willingly joined the Darkspear rebellion and Vol'jin was met by &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;. After agreeing to help the rebellion, while ensuring his people's safety first as many were in Orgrimmar, Baine pointed out that Orgrimmar was a fortress and that Vol'jin would need to seek out allies beyond the Horde. Soon after, Vol'jin was approached by members of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, and both the shadow hunter and an adventurer within the group agreed to a tentative alliance in order to dispose of Garrosh by launching a two-pronged assault on the city: the Horde attacking by land and the Alliance by sea.\nSiege of Orgrimmar.\nVol'jin and Baine moved inside of Razor Hill as the Thunder Bluff Warriors and Darkspear Headhunters were arriving. The two leaders discussed the situation of their army approaching by the sea and about Garrosh.\nVol'jin's rebellion had secured the lion's share of &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, its forces now at the gates of the city itself. Vol'jin faced off with &lt;a href=\"General%20Nazgrim\"&gt;General Nazgrim&lt;/a&gt;, who unleashed the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Juggernaut\"&gt;Iron Juggernaut&lt;/a&gt; against the Darkspear chieftain and Baine Bloodhoof. After its defeat, &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; secured the entrance to Orgrimmar, and told Vol'jin to go ahead while she held the line.\nVol'jin and Baine assisted Horde agents in the battles against the Kor'kron orcs in the &lt;a href=\"Underhold\"&gt;Underhold&lt;/a&gt;. He told Baine and his warriors to hold the area while adventurers went after Thrall and Garrosh. Vol'jin wanted to stop the bloodshed happening above.\nVol'jin arrived at &lt;a href=\"Inner%20Sanctum%20%28Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar%29\"&gt;The Inner Sanctum&lt;/a&gt; following Garrosh's defeat, along with the other Horde leaders. Vol'jin told &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; that the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; needed its true &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; back. After pointing out that it was Vol'jin who held the Horde together and preserved its honor, Thrall knelt before Vol'jin and pledged to follow his leadership. Vol'jin did not feel worthy of the title, but the other leaders of the Horde supported him, and he swore to give his all. He was then approached by &lt;a href=\"Varian\"&gt;Varian&lt;/a&gt;, who was briefly shocked at Vol'jin being the Warchief, before acknowledging that he desired peace between the Alliance and the Horde. However he warned that should Vol'jin's Horde fail to uphold honor as Garrosh did, the Alliance would end them.\nWar Crimes.\nOne of the Vol'jin's first acts of Warchief was to offer a reward for &lt;a href=\"Zaela\"&gt;Zaela&lt;/a&gt;'s head and to that end, he sent a group of agents into the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Highlands\"&gt;Twilight Highlands&lt;/a&gt;, though the Horde party was unable to locate Zaela. Sometime after, the new Warchief received an invitation for hearing the decision about Garrosh's punishment. Vol'jin and the other leaders of the Horde subsequently traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20White%20Tiger\"&gt;Temple of the White Tiger&lt;/a&gt;.\nVol'jin &lt;a href=\"More%20Than%20Expected\"&gt;knew this day would come&lt;/a&gt;. Still agreeing with &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian&lt;/a&gt; during the aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Siege&lt;/a&gt;, he thought that the rest of the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s should not be following &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh&lt;/a&gt;'s path. After &lt;a href=\"Taran%20Zhu\"&gt;Taran Zhu&lt;/a&gt; revealed that there was going to be a trial, the Horde leaders met to discuss who should defend the frail former &lt;a href=\"Warchief%20of%20the%20Horde\"&gt;Warchief of the Horde&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas&lt;/a&gt; offered to serve as his defender. However, Vol'jin declined her offer, remarking that they were looking for a defender and she would better serve as an accuser. With that in mind, Vol'jin offered the position to &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine&lt;/a&gt;, which the others endorsed and Baine reluctantly accepted. After revealing their chosen defender, Vol'jin learned that the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; had chosen Varian Wrynn to serve as the accuser. However, Vol'jin decided to veto this decision and the Alliance then declared &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; would then be the accuser.\nAfter witnessing Anduin's testimony, Vol'jin told Baine that he was doing great. However, Sylvanas didn't share Vol'jin's opinion and quarreled with Baine causing the Warchief to break apart the argument and encouraged Sylvanas to be patient. During the next day, he was called as Tyrande's next witness. He spoke about the situation of trolls during Garrosh's reign as well as about the Pandaria campaign. He witnessed the vision when Garrosh commanded &lt;a href=\"Rak%27gor%20Bloodrazor\"&gt;Rak'gor Bloodrazor&lt;/a&gt; to assassinate Vol'jin if he wouldn't cooperate. When Baine was asking questions, he made Vol'jin recall his threats to Garrosh.\nNear the end of the trial, Vol'jin sent a letter to Jaina Proudmoore, revealing his understanding of her recent actions and informed her that he didn't hate her. After Garrosh escaped and the subsequent chaos ended, he joined Thrall in vowing that they would find Garrosh, no matter where or when Kairoz took him.\nThe Iron Tide.\nOfficially inaugurated as Warchief of the Horde, Vol'jin is now located in Grommash Hold bearing his new title. \nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt; began its &lt;a href=\"Ironmarch\"&gt;preliminary invasion&lt;/a&gt; of Azeroth, Vol'jin sent Horde champions to join the forces there and fight off the attackers. Horde champions, along with &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, later inform him of this new threat and what it may mean for Azeroth.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nHe sent &lt;a href=\"Warmaster%20Zog\"&gt;Warmaster Zog&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Frostwall\"&gt;Frostwall&lt;/a&gt; to assist the commander, and has dispensed a notable number of &lt;a href=\"shadow%20hunter\"&gt;shadow hunter&lt;/a&gt;s to assist the Horde forces all across Draenor, among them &lt;a href=\"Rokhan\"&gt;Rokhan&lt;/a&gt;. Vol'jin has also been kept informed of the Horde's status on Draenor by &lt;a href=\"Knight-Lord%20Dranarus\"&gt;Knight-Lord Dranarus&lt;/a&gt;. When the &lt;a href=\"Garrison\"&gt;Garrison&lt;/a&gt; reaches its third stage, Vol'jin promotes the commander to General of the Horde's forces on Draenor.\nAfter took over the Iron Horde, Vol'jin arrived to &lt;a href=\"Frostwall\"&gt;Frostwall&lt;/a&gt; to plan the invasion of &lt;a href=\"Tanaan%20Jungle\"&gt;Tanaan Jungle&lt;/a&gt;. He suggested building a shipyard and sent the commander to the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Docks\"&gt;Iron Docks&lt;/a&gt;. After the shipyard was built, he wished the adventurer to bring glory to the Horde. He also established an elite group of trolls, &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin%27s%20Headhunters\"&gt;Vol'jin's Headhunters&lt;/a&gt;, and sent them to assist in Tanaan. The warchief was also interested in how Grommash managed to weaponize gronns.\nLegion.\nVol'jin opened the &lt;a href=\"Underhold\"&gt;Underhold&lt;/a&gt; to provide shelter when the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; started.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for the Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, Thrall and Vol'jin assaulted the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;island&lt;/a&gt; and cleared the shoreline by killing &lt;a href=\"Azgalor\"&gt;Azgalor&lt;/a&gt; and his forces. They subsequently made their way to Sylvanas and Baine, who were holding off the demons. Along with the Alliance, they chased Gul'dan whilst they took care of &lt;a href=\"Krosus\"&gt;Krosus&lt;/a&gt;. The Horde set off to cover a high ridge, while the Alliance confronted Gul'dan. During the fighting, unknown force aided the Legion by ensuring that Vol'jin was dealt a mortal blow by a felguard's spear. Despite this, however, he was able to break the spear with one strike and killed the felguard in turn. Vol'jin then collapsed from his fatal wound, even losing &lt;a href=\"Warchief%27s%20Shattered%20Tusk\"&gt;a tusk&lt;/a&gt; in the process, which was noticed by Sylvanas who rode forth to save him. As she neared him, the Warchief told her to not let the Horde die and realizing the battle was lost, Sylvanas summoned her Val'kyr to carry the wounded and led the retreat, carrying Vol'jin back to the ships and leaving the Alliance forces to be overrun.\nUpon returning to Orgrimmar, Vol'jin - suffering from &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; poisoning from the broken spear tip still in his body - called the Horde leadership together with Sylvanas being the last to arrive. With all present the &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mueh%27zala\"&gt;Mueh'zala&lt;/a&gt;, told Vol'jin that death would claim him soon. He then admitted that he had never trusted Sylvanas nor believed that in the Horde's darkest hour, she would be the save it. Manipulated by the guidance of Mueh'zala, Vol'jin followed his decision to name Sylvanas the new Warchief of the Horde. Knowing that others would not understand, Vol'jin urged Sylvanas to step out of the shadows and led.\nVol'jin's spirit then passed into the afterlife, while his body was taken outside the gates of Orgrimmar and cremated on a ritual pyre. Sylvanas asked the assembled Horde who would help her avenge him - a call to arms that was answered by all present. &lt;a href=\"Tyrathan%20Khort\"&gt;Tyrathan Khort&lt;/a&gt;, Vol'jin's human friend from Pandaria, attended the funeral from a safe distance and swore to fulfill his promise of killing Vol'jin's killer.\nFollowing Vol'jin's death, the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear tribe&lt;/a&gt; became leaderless.\nBattle for Azeroth.\n&lt;a href=\"Master%20Gadrin\"&gt;Master Gadrin&lt;/a&gt; says that he often has felt Vol'jin's spirit whispering to him. His strength was the lifeblood of the Darkspear, and some would even say he was the spirit of the true Horde.\nThe Echo Isles came under attack once again by Zalazane, who broke free of Bwonsamdi and came back as a &lt;a href=\"Troll%20lich\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt; with an army of undead. He was able to break away because Bwonsamdi did not also have Vol'jin's spirit. Vol'jin's &lt;a href=\"Nekana\"&gt;glaive&lt;/a&gt; was used to combat Zalazane because it was necessary to use a magical weapon to harm someone who escaped the grasp of Bwonsamdi, and the bond between Vol'jin and Zalazane was great. Upon his death Zalazane proclaimed \"What? Vol'jin... you could not have grown so strong without becoming... a...\" Vol'jin's glaive then began to glow.\nAfterward, the Zandalari Princess &lt;a href=\"Talanji\"&gt;Talanji&lt;/a&gt; offered to bring the ashes of Vol'jin to &lt;a href=\"Atal%27Dazar\"&gt;Atal'Dazar&lt;/a&gt;, the burial temple of Zandalari kings. Along the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Road\"&gt;Golden Road&lt;/a&gt; up &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Mugamba\"&gt;Mount Mugamba&lt;/a&gt; Master Gadrin told of Vol'jin's past deeds to honor him, even as the Sandfury, Gurubashi, and Amani tribes fought to keep the ashes of a \"Horde-loving traitor\" out of Atal'Dazar. Upon reaching the temple Bwonsamdi appeared and said to instead bring them to his temple, the &lt;a href=\"Necropolis%20%28Nazmir%29\"&gt;Necropolis&lt;/a&gt;. But upon arrival there, they learned Vol'jin's spirit was not in his urn and Bwonsamdi grew very worried about having lost a soul that was supposed to be in his care.\nSeeking to learn where Vol'jin's spirit had gone missing, Bwonsamdi tasked the adventurer and Talanji with performing a seance with the aid of some of Vol'jin's friends from life, Gadrin and &lt;a href=\"Rokhan\"&gt;Rokhan&lt;/a&gt;. They reached far into the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt; with Vol'jin's bond with Rokhan and Gadrin serving as a guide, and upon encountering him he tasked them with slaying &lt;a href=\"G%27huun\"&gt;G'huun&lt;/a&gt; as justice for the sons and daughters of lost loa and sons and the heart of Zandalar, culminating with stabbing his glaive into G'huun's corpse. With his glaive soaked in G'huun's blood, it was paraded before the Zandalari in Zuldazar as Vol'jin told Talanji that she set in motion the events leading to G'huun's death by leading the Horde to Zandalar. However, the question of why Vol'jin's spirit had gone missing remained unanswered.\nTides of Vengeance.\nWhen Baine wished to speak to Vol'jin once more, Talanji performed the seance again to call on his spirit. With all that Sylvanas had done to strain the Horde's unity, Baine had to know who the voice that spoke to Vol'jin telling him to make her warchief really was. But Vol'jin's memory had been muddled by death, denied for him by shadows that he knew were coming for his friends. Spirits of the dead attacked the seance, and Vol'jin realized Baine's question was a good one if someone was trying to have him killed for asking it. At Vol'jin's request they traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt; and called on his spirit there to shed some light on the mystery. As they searched more spirits attacked them, and Vol'jin realized that that day on the Shore, something wasn't right with the way the demons' blades slipped past his guard as if the &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt; had forsaken him. Even now he still could not hear their voices, and no matter how much he called to Bwonsamdi the loa of death was not answering. He realized that something had been helping the Legion that day to ensure that Vol'jin died.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;, Vol'jin and the adventurer delved into the &lt;a href=\"Veil\"&gt;Veil&lt;/a&gt; and fought off more spirits as they moved toward &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hold\"&gt;Grommash Hold&lt;/a&gt;. That day he died, Vol'jin had gotten glimpses of the Other Side and expected to see Bwonsamdi, &lt;a href=\"Hir%27eek\"&gt;Hir'eek&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shadra\"&gt;Shadra&lt;/a&gt;, or any of the other loa but none appeared. But he had felt a powerful presence in the shadows that had taken him somewhere, but now the memory of where was hidden from Vol'jin to prevent him from sharing the truth: that it may not have been the loa that wanted Sylvanas warchief, but something else. Vol'jin didn't believe this was Bwonsamdi's style, but that didn't mean the loa of death couldn't have been behind it.\nVol'jin, Talanji, and Baine traveled to the Necropolis, where Bwonsamdi revealed that he had not been ignoring Vol'jin's previous cries for aid; rather, he had not heard them at all. They confronted Bwonsamdi to ask him if he was the one who had told the shadow hunter to make Sylvanas the warchief, which Bwonsamdi denied. Even as much as Bwonsamdi was all for war and death, Sylvanas took things too far, and besides that Sylvanas kept the souls of what she killed as undead instead of releasing them for Bwonsamdi to claim. Troubled by their words, Bwonsamdi agreed to help them find out who had really told Vol'jin to put Sylvanas in charge.\nBwonsamdi opened a &lt;a href=\"%3ADeath%20Gate\"&gt;:Death Gate&lt;/a&gt; to one of his rivals in the ownership of souls: the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;. Like Bwonsamdi, the Lich King told Vol'jin that he was not responsible and that Sylvanas was upsetting the balance of life and death. Furthermore, the Lich King informed Vol'jin that he had been altered more than he realized and as neither undead nor damned he did not belong in the Frozen Throne. The Lich King sent &lt;a href=\"ghoul\"&gt;ghoul&lt;/a&gt;s after them, forcing them to flee through Bwonsamdi's gate. Realizing that Vol'jin's spirit was getting help from some other power, Bwonsamdi also sent them to speak to the &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Eyir\"&gt;Eyir&lt;/a&gt;. Eyir informed the group that Vol'jin had been \"touched by the hand of valor\" and become something beyond even her power to forge, but whoever it was that had aided him was was not the same person who had told him to make Sylvanas warchief. Back at the Necropolis, Bwonsamdi mused that while Eyir and the Lich King were not his only rivals they were the ones he thought most likely to be behind it. He urged Vol'jin to search not the living world but the Shadowlands for his answers.\nVol'jin agreed to return to the &lt;a href=\"Other%20Side\"&gt;Other Side&lt;/a&gt;, with the promise that if he found anything he would send word. He told the adventurer to mind theirself, as he felt the Horde would be needing them soon. Vol'jin was concerned that none of the three death beings he had spoken knew what was going on and none of them liked Sylvanas being warchief, but Talanji believed that no matter the circumstances she was still the leader of the Horde and promised to ensure it was a just rule. Before he left, Vol'jin spoke highly of Talanji's forward-thinking ways and asked her to call on him if she ever needed advice.\nIn Talanji's coronation day as new queen of Zandalar, Vol'jin watched her during Bwonsamdi's trial and bowed to her on her way to speak with her people. He also witnessed her meeting with Sylvanas that same day from afar and vanished afterwards without saying a word.\nShadowlands.\nIt is revealed that &lt;a href=\"Mueh%27zala\"&gt;Mueh'zala&lt;/a&gt;, who was the loa of death before Bwonsamdi and is an ally of &lt;a href=\"the%20Jailer\"&gt;the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, was the one who told Vol'jin to make Sylvanas warchief.\nBwonsamdi, after in &lt;a href=\"De%20Other%20Side\"&gt;De Other Side&lt;/a&gt;, brings Vol'jin to the &lt;a href=\"Necropolis%20%28Nazmir%29\"&gt;Necropolis&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Nazmir\"&gt;Nazmir&lt;/a&gt; to learn the truth. Mueh'zala boasted that he had sent another ancient spirit to the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt; for refusing to join with him, and would have done so for Vol'jin had his ties to Azeroth not prevented it. Bwonsamdi offers Vol'jin a chance for payback, and to rescue the spirit from the Maw. Vol'jin is reluctant, given that he had heard nothing escaped the Maw, but Bwonsamdi's latest ally, a &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt; belonging to the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Fae%20Covenant\"&gt;Night Fae Covenant&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Ardenweald\"&gt;Ardenweald&lt;/a&gt;, has the ability to come and go from the Maw at will, as their soul is tied to Azeroth, just like Vol'jin's; however, he warns that Vol'jin should \"hold tight ta dem threads and don't be fully manifestin' ya spirit in dat dark place\", or his spirit would be cursed to oblivion. Vol'jin finally agrees, unwilling to let Mueh'zala have the last laugh.\nOnce inside the Maw, Vol'jin only uses enough of his soul to track their target, as anything more would sever the bonds tying him to Azeroth and trap him there. The spirit they find is the &lt;a href=\"Wild%20God\"&gt;Wild God&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ashamane\"&gt;Ashamane&lt;/a&gt;, killed during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; ten thousand years before. After securing Ashamane's spirit to be returned to Ardenweald, Vol'jin detects three more spirits, belonging to Loa killed in Zandalar: &lt;a href=\"Hir%27eek\"&gt;Hir'eek&lt;/a&gt;, corrupted by &lt;a href=\"G%27huun\"&gt;G'huun&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Shadra\"&gt;Shadra&lt;/a&gt;, sacrificed by her own priestess, &lt;a href=\"Yazma\"&gt;Yazma&lt;/a&gt;; and finally, &lt;a href=\"Rezan\"&gt;Rezan&lt;/a&gt;, the Loa of the Zandalari kings. While Hir'eek and Shadra are secured within the Maw Walker's &lt;a href=\"Soulkeeper%20Crystal\"&gt;Soulkeeper Crystal&lt;/a&gt; along with Ashamane, Rezan has been tortured nearly beyond help by the Mawsworn. Rezan recognizes Vol'jin as a fierce spirit who seeks justice, and so grants the last of his essence to him, so that all that Rezan had been could be reborn within him. Vol'jin protested, saying that his people needed him; Rezan, however, felt that Vol'jin was the one they needed. Vol'jin promises not to waste Rezan's gift, and that his name would not be forgotten. The Maw Walker brings the rescued spirits, along with Vol'jin, to the &lt;a href=\"Winter%20Queen\"&gt;Winter Queen&lt;/a&gt;, ruler of Ardenweald, who takes them under her care; though she could not say what fate held, she offered Vol'jin a chance to one day be reborn anew. Vol'jin accepted, saying that it would be time for him to begin a new hunt - after getting some rest. Vol'jin's wildseed can be seen in &lt;a href=\"Tirna%20Vaal\"&gt;Tirna Vaal&lt;/a&gt; after these events, with Bwonsamdi paying him a visit.\nDragonflight.\nA time-displaced Vol'jin from his time as an apprentice shadow hunter appeared in &lt;a href=\"Everywhen%20Inn\"&gt;Everywhen Inn&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Thaldraszus\"&gt;Thaldraszus&lt;/a&gt;, asking adventurers to retrieve his &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin%27s%20Mojo%20%28item%29\"&gt;missing mojo&lt;/a&gt;.\nTactics.\nThe battle with Vol'jin is arguably the most difficult of all the &lt;a href=\"faction%20leader\"&gt;faction leader&lt;/a&gt;s, a major factor being his strategic position. At face value, the several entrances to Orgrimmar can seem appealing to a would-be raid, though Grommash Hold itself has been moved to the most populated area of Orgrimmar - leaving Vol'jin flanked by a large amount of Horde players at almost all times. Vol'jin's lack of elite guards is compensated by the &lt;a href=\"Warchief%27s%20Herald\"&gt;Warchief's Herald&lt;/a&gt; that pulls with him, and the small amount of space allocated for the fight- leaving most of the raid susceptible to &lt;a href=\"AOE\"&gt;AOE&lt;/a&gt; and easy &lt;a href=\"crowd%20control\"&gt;crowd control&lt;/a&gt; from Horde players, most deadly being chain fears on healers or tanks. It is also important to note that &lt;a href=\"stealth%20%28mechanic%29\"&gt;stealth&lt;/a&gt;ing into the room is almost impossible, as the pair of &lt;a href=\"Forsaken%20Delegation%20Deathguard\"&gt;Forsaken Delegation Deathguard&lt;/a&gt;s in the Hold can see through stealth effects.\nQuotes.\nZalazane's Fall.\nZalazane's time be runnin' out. De Echo Isles will belong to de Darkspear Tribe again!\nPersonality and traits.\nVol'jin is a wise, pragmatic leader, who feels that his own personal happiness and wishes always take backseat to keeping his people prosperous, even at his own suffering. \nPersonally, Vol'jin values freedom, even at the cost of misery and pain, above all else, and would never tie himself down to a life of leisure and security if it meant losing his freedom. Aside from that, Vol'jin highly values personal relationships, seeing Thrall and Cairne as his \"brothers\", his emotional attachment to his \"Papa\", Sen'jin, and was very close to Zalazane from birth until he went mad from his own power. While not warmongering, as indicated by his disgust at the idea of the Zandalari trying to regain their glory through war, as well as Garrosh's aggressive stance against the Alliance, he will do whatever it takes to keep his people safe, and to honor his commitment to Thrall and the Horde, as they are his \"people\" as much as the Darkspear tribe. \nAs seen by his heated conversation with Garrosh though, violence is not beneath him to solve a problem, but he is a well-spoken diplomat who knows how to pick and choose his words carefully to garner the results he wants. He seems to hold no real grudge against the Alliance, as he has no issue with sending envoys to Stormwind Harbor to ask for their help in defeating the Zandalari in Zul'Gurub, and seems to easily work alongside anyone who he feels works within the scope of his strategies. When he's not focused on the task at hand, Vol'jin wisely guides his people and cares for those he is close to and is ready to kill and die for those who would bring harm to them.\nIt also seems that Vol'jin is a very powerful Shadow Hunter, using voodoo to transform Rexxar, Rokhan and Chen Stormstout into invisible &lt;a href=\"wyvern\"&gt;wyvern&lt;/a&gt;s, a feat which has never been seen before.\nAccording to information gleaned from the quest The Admiral's Orders, he once had a distrust of humans. However, the dialogue was simply copied and pasted from &lt;a href=\"Nazgrel\"&gt;Nazgrel&lt;/a&gt; who used to end the quest. That quest is no longer available. Despite that, he indeed have some degree of disgust and distrust towards them. In Vol'jin: Shadow of the Horde, he was alarmed and struggled to protest when Chen told him a human, Tyrathan Khort will tend to him. When Tyrathan touched him in order to stop him from drawing another jihui cube, he was revolted and was about to wrestled Tyrathan's hand from him, as he felt that humans have no right to touch a shadow hunter like himself. As time progressed, this soon faded as he befriended Tyrathan and even tried to negotiate with Bwonsamdi to spare him when he is mortally wounded. After the defeat of Garrosh, he replied Varian's request to speak with him with courtesy. He even sent Jaina Proudmoore a letter offering his understanding of Jaina's ordeal. After the escape of Garrosh and Kairozdormu, he was willing to work alongside the Alliance to hunt Garrosh down.\nIn the RPG.\nHe is the acting chieftain of the Darkspear tribe.\nAfter Thrall saved the Darkspear tribe from certain annihilation, the tribe's shaman leader pledged their loyalty to the Horde forever. It isn't, however, stated, if this relates to Sen'jin or Vol'jin.\nIn the TCG.\nVol'jin appeared on a card twice in the . Once in the &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin%20%28Blood%20of%20Gladiators%29\"&gt;Blood of Gladiators&lt;/a&gt; set, and once in the &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin%2C%20Darkspear%20Chieftain\"&gt;Throne of the Tides&lt;/a&gt; set.\nHis title is worded as Darkspear Chieftain.\nAlternate timeline.\nDuring the final day of the trial of Hellscream, the bronze dragon &lt;a href=\"Kairozdormu\"&gt;Kairozdormu&lt;/a&gt; helped Garrosh escape by summoning &lt;a href=\"alternate%20timeline\"&gt;alternate timeline&lt;/a&gt; counterparts of those present. Vol'jin's counterpart hailing from an unknown timeline was notably more primitive, savage and sadistic than him. According to &lt;a href=\"Christie%20Golden\"&gt;Christie Golden&lt;/a&gt;, not much is known about the alternate timeline Vol'jin seen in \"&lt;a href=\"War%20Crimes\"&gt;War Crimes&lt;/a&gt;\", other than that things went \"very bad\" in the timeline he came from. He was a shadow hunter and wore a necklace made of human and elven ears and seemed less reasonable than his main universe counterpart. According to Baine, Kairoz selected the most broken and the darkest versions those present. To send them back to their own realities, one was to accept the other self. He took a sick joy in attacking the weakened &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and even attempted to take his ear as a trophy before Chromie grabbed and threw him away. It is unknown how Vol'jin accepted his alternate self (which Baine revealed as the only way to truly send them back to their original timeline) or his reaction.\nIt is possible that enmity between human, trolls, and elves is extremely heated at the other timeline. In Vol'jin: Shadow of the Horde, Vol'jin attempted to tell Chen Stormstout about the human-troll enmity and how it is pulsed with hatred. It was mentioned that Vol'jin has killed countless humans before.\nSpeculation.\nIt has been theorized that Vol'jin has become a loa, though his own questline in \"Battle for Azeroth\" shows that it's not clear on what he is yet. He visits &lt;a href=\"Bwonsamdi\"&gt;multiple&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Eyir\"&gt;powerful&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;entities&lt;/a&gt; to question what he has become, and no one can give him the answers he needs. Bwonsamdi does not know what happened to Vol'jin after he died, Eyir says he was \"blessed by valor\", something beyond her capabilities, and the Lich King says he is neither undead nor damned.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

He was then raised into &lt;a href=\"Undead\"&gt;undeath&lt;/a&gt; and relocated to &lt;a href=\"Atal%27Dazar%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Atal'Dazar&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nAmong the military of &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Empire\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt; are the elite &lt;a href=\"dire%20troll\"&gt;dire troll&lt;/a&gt;s. These &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s are warriors who have perfected their arts, traded portions of their lives for the dark gift of brutal strength, and serve Zandalar as her greatest weapons of war. Long ago it was decided that the dire trolls should always have a seat on the &lt;a href=\"Zanchuli%20Council\"&gt;Zanchuli Council&lt;/a&gt;, to ensure that those specials needs of the elite warriors were met by the government, and to provide the wisdom of war to those councilors who may seldom see a battlefront. Of these elite, Vol'kaal was chosen for his strength, his power and a strongly worded recommendation from &lt;a href=\"Yazma\"&gt;Yazma&lt;/a&gt;. This would be the third dire troll appointed by Yazma, for they are short-lived, and their minds are easily bent.\nVol'kaal accompanied Yazma when she traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Port%20of%20Zandalar\"&gt;Port of Zandalar&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Zul\"&gt;Zul&lt;/a&gt;'s command. When Zul began his coup against King &lt;a href=\"Rastakhan\"&gt;Rastakhan&lt;/a&gt;, Vol'kaal sided with the prophet. Seeking to siphon the power of the &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt;, Yazma and Vol'kaal pulled their forces to the &lt;a href=\"Garden%20of%20the%20Loa\"&gt;Garden of the Loa&lt;/a&gt;. Vol'kaal engaged the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Speaker of the Horde&lt;/a&gt; in battle, as Yazma siphoned &lt;a href=\"Shadra\"&gt;Shadra&lt;/a&gt; of her power. While Yazma would be successful in claiming the loa's power as her own, Vol'kaal would be killed.\nYazma later used her newfound powers to reanimate his corpse with the intention of him serving her for all eternity. Adventurers seeking to stop Yazma entered &lt;a href=\"Atal%27Dazar\"&gt;Atal'Dazar&lt;/a&gt; and clashed with Vol'kaal. As he died, Vol'kaal expressed his belief that his mistress would reanimate him once more."}

Volazj's mind flay can be Spell Reflected for considerable damage.\nIt is possible to complete the achievement just by nuking the boss and killing the illusions made from the two insanities as quickly as possible. Other tactics include heavy nuke on the boss when he casts the first insanity, bringing him from 66% to 33% before he finishes the cast, he will then start to cast the second insanity and needs to be killed before he finishes the cast or the party will be faced with 10 copies per person (instead of 5). Another viable tactic is to have the healer suicide (preferably just after the first insanity). This will make the second insanity much easier due to having 9 copies less to deal with, however this tactic does require a good geared warrior tank and probably the use of health pots.\nNow that dual specs is out, having the healer switch to DPS makes this achievement quick and painless. If no one in the group is specced for healing the shadows will go down quickly. Be careful not to get Volazj below 33% before he finishes the first Insanity cast. As soon as that first set of shadows is dead, blow all your cooldowns and with 4 DPSers he should be dead before he can finish casting the second Insanity."}

{"id": "189160", "revid": "39299307", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=189160", "title": "Volkhan", "text": "Volkhan was a &lt;a href=\"fire%20giant\"&gt;fire giant&lt;/a&gt; created by &lt;a href=\"Loken\"&gt;Loken&lt;/a&gt; and the second boss in the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Lightning\"&gt;Halls of Lightning&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe Winterskorn War.\nAlong with &lt;a href=\"Ignis%20the%20Furnace%20Master\"&gt;Ignis&lt;/a&gt;, Volkhan saw the &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Peaks\"&gt;Storm Peaks&lt;/a&gt; surrounding &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt; as a land ripe for conquest, however they were aware that they needed to army and to this end the fire giants turned towards the fierce &lt;a href=\"Winterskorn%20clan\"&gt;Winterskorn clan&lt;/a&gt; of vrykul. After taking control of the clan by force the fire giants were quick to strike the fires of their battle lust, while forging armor and weapons for the army designed to work against the other &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt;.\nHowever just as the new army was to embark on its &lt;a href=\"Winterskorn%20War\"&gt;great conquest&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Flesh\"&gt;Curse of Flesh&lt;/a&gt; struck. Seeing their forces succumb to it did not deter Volkhan and Ignis from their goal, but both were aware that they could no longer rely on the Winterskorn alone to achieve victory. To strengthen their army Volkhan and Ignis molded powerful molten golems and iron constructs of their own design. This massive Winterskorn army marched first against the good-natured &lt;a href=\"earthen\"&gt;earthen&lt;/a&gt;, storming their underground lairs. The earthen were utterly unprepared to face such an overwhelming and organized force. Entire caverns were massacred to the last living creature.\nA small group of survivors escaped the onslaught and sought the help of &lt;a href=\"Tyr\"&gt;Tyr&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Archaedas\"&gt;Archaedas&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ironaya\"&gt;Ironaya&lt;/a&gt;, who had thus far eluded &lt;a href=\"Loken\"&gt;Loken&lt;/a&gt;'s wrath. Incensed by what they learned, Tyr and his companions immediately journeyed to the earthen's cavernous home to aid the beleaguered titan-forged. Tyr himself led the bravest of the earthen in skirmishes with the Winterskorn, while Archaedas and Ironaya constructed defenses to ward off future attacks. In time, the earthen and their allies drove back the Winterskorn.\nAlthough their attempts to conquer the Storm Peaks failed, Volkhan and Ignis did not concede defeat. They returned to their blistering forges and created a new army - one even greater than before. Not satisfied with golems and constructs alone, Volkhan and Ignis crafted enchanted snares with which to enslave entire flights of &lt;a href=\"proto-dragon\"&gt;proto-dragon&lt;/a&gt;s. These creatures would serve not as mounts, but as beasts of war. The giants outfitted their winged servants with fiery weapons to strike terror into the hearts of the earthen. The Winterskorn's next brutal assault shattered the earthen's defenses and drove them from their refuge. The earthen scattered across the icy mountain passes, but they could not escape their foes. Vrykul and golems hunted the earthen on the ground, while proto-dragons assailed them from skies. Even Tyr, Archaedas, and Ironaya were forced to flee from the Winterskorn's fury.\nHowever Try was able to recruit the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt; to his cause and they helped bring an end to the conflict by shattering the golems and constructs forged by Ignis and Volkhan, liberating the enslaved proto-dragons, and forcing the Winterskorn into a deep slumber. \nWrath of the Lich King.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, Volkhan at Loken's command resided within the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Lightning\"&gt;Halls of Lightning&lt;/a&gt;, located in the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Crucible\"&gt;Iron Crucible&lt;/a&gt;. He worked many days and nights to create &lt;a href=\"golem\"&gt;golem&lt;/a&gt;s to further the numbers of Loken's armies, and was considered a threat to the existence of the &lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Hodir\"&gt;Sons of Hodir&lt;/a&gt;, who ordered his death.\nExploring Azeroth.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;war against the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, the brothers &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard\"&gt;Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; visited the Iron Crucible, among them &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; got in a long conversation here with an unnamed female &lt;a href=\"iron%20dwarf\"&gt;iron dwarf&lt;/a&gt;, now the new overseer in charge of the area since the demise of Volkhan. She was noted by Brann to be far more informative and talkative than the hostile fire giant had been.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"Loken's powerful legions are a testament to the craftsmanship of his blacksmith, Volkhan. His work is never ending, ceaselessly creating soldiers to fight for the fallen keeper. Only when the blacksmith's creations stand atop the crumpled bodies of their enemies will his work be done.\"\nTactics.\nThis is a fairly simple fight.\nHe hits the tank for medium damage. At every 20% of his health, he runs to his anvil and casts \"Temper\", which produces several molten golem adds. The adds do not hit hard but do cast &lt;a href=\"Immolation\"&gt;Immolation&lt;/a&gt;. Instead of dying, they become \"frozen.\"\nOnce he has cast Temper several times he will cast &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wowhead.com/%3Fspell%3D59529\"&gt;Shattering Stomp&lt;/a&gt; which causes the frozen golems to shatter for ~5k damage each. If the golems are stacked, the stomp can one-shot party members. However, Shattering Stomp has a cast time and is emoted, allowing players to move away from any frozen golems.\nA well-geared tank can off-tank the adds instead of killing them, avoiding the issue of shattering. This will also allow the group to obtain the heroic achievement."}

Hidden deep within its halls lies an ancient treasure that, if placed in the wrong hands, could endanger all life on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Should players survive the perils of &lt;a href=\"Uldum\"&gt;Uldum&lt;/a&gt;, they will be called to help &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; unlock the mysteries within these treacherous titan halls and protect the titans' ancient secrets.\nA non-linear dungeon, the Halls' entrance can be found at of eastern Uldum inside the large pyramid.\nOutside the pyramid are four massive statues, placed as if acting like sentries for the Halls of Origination and the grounds in front of it. They represent the four &lt;a href=\"titanic%20watchers\"&gt;titanic watchers&lt;/a&gt; inside the dungeon at The Four Seats: from the left to right, &lt;a href=\"Rajh\"&gt;Rajh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ammunae\"&gt;Ammunae&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Setesh\"&gt;Setesh&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Isiset\"&gt;Isiset&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nUntil recently, little has been known of Uldum's Halls of Origination - save that they were constructed by the ancient and godlike titans, the beings responsible for many of Azeroth's races. Recent findings from Alliance and Horde explorers, however, suggest that the halls are among the most important titan creations in the world. The sand-filled pyramid is an archaeologist's delight, filled with relics of an earlier age and the fearsome automated defenses that protect them. But a greater treasure is rumored to lie hidden deep within the halls - a secret that could endanger all life on Azeroth. The armies threatening Uldum know of this secret, and they hope to use it as a weapon. Finding, entering and protecting the Halls of Origination is no longer a matter of academic interest.\nThe Halls of Origination have been occupied by the &lt;a href=\"Amathet\"&gt;Amathet&lt;/a&gt;, a group of &lt;a href=\"tol%27vir\"&gt;tol'vir&lt;/a&gt; who believe only they can protect the titans' works and plan to use the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Origination\"&gt;Forge of Origination&lt;/a&gt; contained within to reoriginate the planet and free it from the Old Gods. &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; entered the Halls, dealt with the Amathet and reactivated Forge of Origination. Later, they discovered that it has also been attacked by the forces of &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;, who sought to use the Forge to overwrite reality with &lt;a href=\"Ny%27alotha\"&gt;Ny'alotha&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Ramkahen%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Ramkahen&lt;/a&gt; then took control of the Halls, only to be defeated by the Amathet again. This time, the adventurer was accompanied by &lt;a href=\"High%20Explorer%20Dellorah\"&gt;High Explorer Dellorah&lt;/a&gt; and defeated &lt;a href=\"Inimot%2C%20the%20Radiant%20Blade\"&gt;Inimot, the Radiant Blade&lt;/a&gt;, stopping their plan to reoriginate Azeroth.\nDungeon Journal.\n\"Constructed by the great titans, the Halls of Origination are filled with ancient relics and the fearsome guardians that protect them. Rumors abound that the complex also contains a devastating weapon capable of reordering all life on Azeroth. Deathwing has moved to obtain this terrifying device through his agent, Al'Akir the Windlord. Thus far the facility's communication systems have been fully corrupted, but the weapon inside continues to elude Deathwing's grasp.\"\nProgression.\nEntering the Halls.\nYou will immediately learn the gravity of your situation in the &lt;a href=\"Maker%27s%20Overlook\"&gt;Maker's Overlook&lt;/a&gt; when stumbling over the bodies of those who have entered the Halls of Origination before you, seeking power... and failing. Those who survive beyond the entrance of these ancient corridors will be greeted by &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; just outside the dungeon's transport system to the upper reaches. It will require more than the guidance of Brann to advance upward, however, as the secrets of these halls must first be unlocked.\nChamber of Prophecy.\nThe column-strewn &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20Prophecy\"&gt;Chamber of Prophecy&lt;/a&gt; is truly a testament of time. In a room adorned with the relics of an ancient culture, two arks await investigation, protected by ever-faithful servants. Those who meddle with the titan relics must answer to &lt;a href=\"Temple%20Guardian%20Anhuur\"&gt;Temple Guardian Anhuur&lt;/a&gt;, the overseer of this chamber and a master of holy magic and devastating hymns.\nTomb of the Earthrager.\nAcross from the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20Prophecy\"&gt;Chamber of Prophecy&lt;/a&gt; and just outside the dungeon's walls lies the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20the%20Earthrager\"&gt;Tomb of the Earthrager&lt;/a&gt;, entrenched within a pyramid sun-scorched and bombarded with sandstorms. Littered with the bones of the long deceased, the tomb waits to collect more unprepared victims. It is, after all, the resting place of &lt;a href=\"Earthrager%20Ptah\"&gt;Earthrager Ptah&lt;/a&gt;. Those who disturb his tomb disrupt an eerily quiet place before Ptah shakes the ground beneath you in a Tumultuous Earthstorm, bringing to life the weathered bones of the deceased and unearthing vile Scarabs.\nThe Vault of Lights.\nWith walls weighted by priceless titan artifacts, the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20Lights%20%28Uldum%29\"&gt;Vault of Lights&lt;/a&gt; will serve as a chamber of punishment for your intrusion. &lt;a href=\"Anraphet\"&gt;Anraphet&lt;/a&gt;, a haunting statue of titan composition, awakens to serve his fellow keepers and eradicate all mortals who enter. Make no mistake: his long slumber will not prevent him from showing absolute wrath.\nSeats of the Keepers.\nSurvivors of the halls' depths will gain access to the upper reaches. With help from &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, you must uncover the mysteries of Uldum. Your journey will lead you to areas of ultimate consequence: the Seats of Magic, Life, Chaos, and Radiance. Here you will be confronted by the construct of magic &lt;a href=\"Isiset\"&gt;Isiset&lt;/a&gt;, construct of life &lt;a href=\"Ammunae\"&gt;Ammunae&lt;/a&gt;, construct of chaos &lt;a href=\"Setesh\"&gt;Setesh&lt;/a&gt;, and construct of radiance &lt;a href=\"Rajh\"&gt;Rajh&lt;/a&gt;. You will be tested by these constructs of &lt;a href=\"Uldum\"&gt;Uldum&lt;/a&gt;, who will not easily give up their thrones or the secrets of the titans.\nOnly by exploring &lt;a href=\"Uldum\"&gt;Uldum&lt;/a&gt;'s Halls of Origination in \"\" will you have a chance to uncover their dangerous powers, and perhaps even the mysteries behind the origins of life on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeography.\nThe Halls of Origination are located in Uldum, north of &lt;a href=\"Vortex%20Pinnacle\"&gt;Vortex Pinnacle&lt;/a&gt;. The entrance to the pyramid is on the eastern side. It's likely that you'll discover this dungeon on your map while questing since it's smack in the middle of early &lt;a href=\"Harrison%20Jones\"&gt;Harrison Jones&lt;/a&gt; quests. There is a third floor not on the map visited during &lt;a href=\"Doing%20it%20the%20Hard%20Way\"&gt;Doing it the Hard Way&lt;/a&gt;.\nTrivia.\nThe bosses are based off the Egyptian mythology pantheon: &lt;a href=\"Earthrager%20Ptah\"&gt;Earthrager Ptah&lt;/a&gt; (), &lt;a href=\"Isiset\"&gt;Isiset&lt;/a&gt; () (ironically, \"Isiset\" is a combination of Isis and Set, the latter was responsible for the murder of the former's husband, Osiris), &lt;a href=\"Setesh\"&gt;Setesh&lt;/a&gt; (), &lt;a href=\"Rajh\"&gt;Rajh&lt;/a&gt; (), &lt;a href=\"Anraphet\"&gt;Anraphet&lt;/a&gt; () and &lt;a href=\"Ammunae\"&gt;Ammunae&lt;/a&gt; ().\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

It was considered the hardest 5-man instance of the expansion, due to the difficulty and loot. The Halls of Reflection are the private chambers of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, the only place where he lets his guard down. Judging by the loading screen and map, it appears to be a dark, twisted replica of &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Lordaeron's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"imperial%20chamber\"&gt;imperial chamber&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo become attuned and unlock the doors to the Halls of Reflection, players are required to complete the quest &lt;a href=\"Deliverance%20from%20the%20Pit\"&gt;Deliverance from the Pit&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Pit%20of%20Saron\"&gt;Pit of Saron&lt;/a&gt; as part of the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Halls\"&gt;Frozen Halls&lt;/a&gt; story line quest chain. Pit of Saron has its own \"attunement\" prerequisite quest that must be completed in the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Souls\"&gt;Forge of Souls&lt;/a&gt;.\nQueuing for the Halls of Reflection in the &lt;a href=\"Dungeon%20Finder\"&gt;Dungeon Finder&lt;/a&gt; requires level 80 and that one's gear have an average &lt;a href=\"item%20level\"&gt;item level&lt;/a&gt; of 180. However, any level 80 player may enter directly through the portal.\nLore.\n\"With the Lich King's attention focused on the Ashen Verdict's attacks, covert agents have managed the near-impossible feat of infiltrating the citadel and providing invaluable intelligence on the frozen halls and their wings: the Forge of Souls, the Pit of Saron, and the Halls of Reflection. If the champions of justice are to have any hope of defeating the lord of the dead, they will have to rely on courage, fortitude, and an increasingly narrow window of opportunity to strike at Icecrown Citadel from within its own walls.\"\nWith &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas&lt;/a&gt; leading the way, adventurers who make it as far as these frigid halls will quickly recognize the weapon that lies ahead: &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt;, the corruptive, legendary device and weapon of the Lich King himself. The Lich King's private chambers are within reach, although they may be the death of anyone who ventures there. It is the only place where Arthas let his guard down.\nThe events of the dungeon play out in the following quests:\nDungeon Journal.\n\"For many years, champions among the races of Azeroth have stood against the Lich King only to be slaughtered mercilessly and forced to serve in his army of undead horrors. In his ongoing struggle to stop the Lich King, Tirion Fordring of the Argent Crusade has joined forces with Darion Mograine of the Knights of the Ebon Blade in order to assault Icecrown Citadel with a unified army called the Ashen Verdict.\"\nDungeon denizens.\nBosses.\nThe \"fight\" against him is more of a damage race, in which players must escape lest they be struck down by the wrath of the Lich King (\"literally\").\nStrategy.\nHalls of Reflection is the hardest heroic 5-man in the game. Most groups will find the most challenging part to be the waves of trash before the first two bosses. The mobs hit very, very hard, and several of them are ranged, making them difficult for tanks to corral. \nLoS Stategy.\nBefore each wave of trash before Falric and Marwyn, everyone except the tank hides in the corner of the left alcove, out of the line of site of all mobs. The four players (healer and 3 DPS) stand on top of each other. The tank stands in the middle of the alcove in plain view.\nWhen the mobs activate, the tank allows the melee mobs to reach him, and uses abilities (e.g., Thunder Clap) to aggro them. The ranged mobs may aggro on the tank immediately, or, having aggrod on a hidden party member, will have to run past the tank to reach their targets. In the latter case, the tank's close-range aggro abilities can be used to take aggro. In this way all of the mobs in the wave will be aggro'd onto the tank.\nThe tank then runs into the corner (where the other party members are hiding) to force the remaining ranged mobs to run to him. As soon as the tank reaches the corner (but not before), the other party members leave and spread out in the alcove. All mobs are within AoE range of the tank and the fight can proceed on the party's terms.\nA similar tactic can be used while fleeing from the Lich King. There is a recess in front of each of the four ice walls raised by the Lich King. These can be used to force attackers into close range, if all party members cluster there as the attack begins.\nCrowd Control Strategy.\nThe other approach fights in the open. Players must dust off long-neglected &lt;a href=\"crowd%20control\"&gt;crowd control&lt;/a&gt; abilities. &lt;a href=\"Shackle%20Undead\"&gt;Shackle Undead&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Entangling%20Roots\"&gt;Entangling Roots&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Repentance\"&gt;Repentance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Turn%20Evil\"&gt;Turn Evil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Trap\"&gt;Frost Trap&lt;/a&gt; are all very useful. Silencing casters and using &lt;a href=\"Misdirection\"&gt;Misdirection&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Tricks%20of%20the%20Trade\"&gt;Tricks of the Trade&lt;/a&gt; on melee mobs will help the tank hold aggro. Everyone who can interrupt spells should do so. Mindlessly maximizing DPS will lead to wipes - intelligently controlling the mobs will lead to victory.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

This is where the greatest warriors of the &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; are called to serve &lt;a href=\"Keeper\"&gt;Keeper&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Odyn\"&gt;Odyn&lt;/a&gt; as their eternal reward for being the worthiest.\nAs you are seeking out the &lt;a href=\"Pillars%20of%20Creation\"&gt;Pillar of Creation&lt;/a&gt; in Stormheim, you are contending with the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; cooperating leader of the vrykul in Stormheim, the &lt;a href=\"God-King%20Skovald\"&gt;God-King Skovald&lt;/a&gt;. As you race against him through the region, both of your paths lead you to this dungeon, which is the location of the Pillar. You must prove yourself worthy in battle so that you can claim it. We also learn more about the origin of the &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt; here. These aren't the undead Val'kyr from &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, but the pure warrior of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;. Its polar opposite is Helheim. The &lt;a href=\"Skyhold\"&gt;Skyhold&lt;/a&gt; is a section of the Halls, which are entered through the &lt;a href=\"Gates%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Gates of Valor&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nCreation.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Proto-dragon\"&gt;proto-dragons&lt;/a&gt; defeated &lt;a href=\"Galakrond\"&gt;Galakrond&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"keeper\"&gt;keeper&lt;/a&gt;s saw them worthy to be the protectors of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and wished to call upon the mighty &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s to bless them for that purpose. However, &lt;a href=\"Odyn\"&gt;Odyn&lt;/a&gt;, Prime Designate and ruler of the keepers, resented this idea. He did not trust the proto-dragons and so he sought to create his own elite army, one of steadfast and valiant stature. He saw the &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt;, children of the &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt;, to be the most desirable candidate for his army. However, the other keepers did not concur with Odyn's aspirations and attempted to dissuade him from his plan. Odyn was unyielding to their request and continued with his scheme.\nWithin the halls of &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt;, Odyn secured one of the sections to be the headquarters for his new army. He summoned the &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt; sorceress and friend &lt;a href=\"Helya\"&gt;Helya&lt;/a&gt; and with her power, she ripped the division of Ulduar and stationed it in the misty heavens above Azeroth. This would be known as the Halls of Valor, home of the mighty &lt;a href=\"Valarjar\"&gt;Valarjar&lt;/a&gt;, and headquarters for Odyn's army.\nImprisonment.\nAfter the corrupted &lt;a href=\"keeper\"&gt;keeper&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Loken\"&gt;Loken&lt;/a&gt; had restored &lt;a href=\"Helya\"&gt;Helya&lt;/a&gt;'s free will, she called upon the same powers she had used to secure the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Plane\"&gt;Elemental Plane&lt;/a&gt; and sealed off the Halls of Valor with an impregnable, magical barrier. She then proceeded to create &lt;a href=\"Helheim\"&gt;Helheim&lt;/a&gt; as an enchanted refuge for herself and the other Val'kyr far below the Halls.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"In the clouds high above Stormheim, the titanic keeper Odyn has called the greatest vrykul warriors on Azeroth to be his Valarjar. Amidst feasting halls and hunting grounds, these ascended vrykul test themselves and prepare for the great war that is to come. Adventurers must pass through these halls and prove their worth if they hope to stand before Odyn and claim the Aegis of Aggramar.\"\nSpeculation.\nThe Halls of Valor's exact location is unknown, but since &lt;a href=\"Helya\"&gt;Helya&lt;/a&gt; imprisoned the structure like the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Plane\"&gt;Elemental Plane&lt;/a&gt;, is thus inside a &lt;a href=\"pocket%20dimension\"&gt;pocket dimension&lt;/a&gt;. It is possible it is inside &lt;a href=\"Skywall\"&gt;Skywall&lt;/a&gt;, given Helya's involvement in the creation of the Elemental Plane."}

He lived as a poor farmer in his &lt;a href=\"Halsand%27s%20estate\"&gt;estate&lt;/a&gt; until one day, everything changed.\nBiography.\nHalsand was born as the son of a poor farmer himself. When he was a teenager he used to work in the grain silos in &lt;a href=\"Andorhal\"&gt;Andorhal&lt;/a&gt;, but he became a farmer before the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; invaded and managed to escape. He didn't have very much to leave to the Scourge, as after his father's 45 years of life and work had ended, all he had for his inheritance was his father's chipped, wooden pipe. He married &lt;a href=\"Myra\"&gt;Myra&lt;/a&gt;, but never told her about his life in Andorhal, and had three children with her.\nHe would work on his farm and play with his children until one day, a party led by &lt;a href=\"Maddox\"&gt;Maddox&lt;/a&gt; arrived and asked for a place to stay. Halsand invited them to sleep in his stable and to join them for dinner. During dinner the party told Halsand that they were going to retake Andorhal and they have hundreds of warriors awaiting their command. Although the &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thorn\"&gt;Thorn&lt;/a&gt; was against putting a family man in potential danger, Maddox convinced Halsand with the promise of much-needed money to guide them to &lt;a href=\"Chillwind%20Camp\"&gt;Chillwind Camp&lt;/a&gt; as he knew the land very well, and could avoid &lt;a href=\"Syndicate\"&gt;Syndicate&lt;/a&gt; camps on the way there. He left &lt;a href=\"Jake\"&gt;Jake&lt;/a&gt; to protect the family, accepted an early birthday present from Rose, and promised Myra that he would come back to her.\nWhen the Halsand arrived at &lt;a href=\"Chillwind%20Camp\"&gt;Chillwind Camp&lt;/a&gt;, there were just a hundred warriors and no more. The attack was going to be canceled but Maddox convinced Halsand to guide the raid against the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;-ridden &lt;a href=\"Andorhal\"&gt;Andorhal&lt;/a&gt; by tripling his pay, and the others for \"more gold than they can carry\". Halsand illustrates the west and east entrances of Andorhal, to which Maddox decides to split their 100 into two groups for a two-pronged attack, and crush the Scourge between them. During the attack he was bitten by a &lt;a href=\"ghoul\"&gt;ghoul&lt;/a&gt; that Thorn then killed. As things went downhill, Thorn got him on a horse (over Maddox's desperate insistence that he should be the one to escape) and got the animal moving, shouting to Halsand to flee and not look back just as the undead overwhelmed him. Just as Halsand was nearby the river, he was knocked into the infected waters of Andorhal by an &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt; and another ghoul. He got away from the ghoul by stabbing his father's pipe into it's right eye, but swallowed some of the water and knew that he had bcome infected with the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;Plague of Undeath&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe returned to his home just to see his family once more, thinking he wouldn't transform into an &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; until later. He almost attacked his wife against his will, as he began transforming into a ghoul. Fortunately his son fatally ran him through from behind with a pitchfork, thinking he was just another undead. As he lay dying, Halsand assured Jake that he had protected the family just as he was told to do, and that he was proud of him."}

They have an &lt;a href=\"Oxen\"&gt;ox&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nOne day, a noble by the name of &lt;a href=\"Maddox\"&gt;Maddox&lt;/a&gt; and a group of &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s reached the estate, looking for a place to stay the night. During supper, the group found out Halsand's problems in maintaining the farm and Maddox proposed him to guide them to &lt;a href=\"Andorhal\"&gt;Andorhal&lt;/a&gt; in return of a great sum of gold, though later the noble would propose him three times much more if Halsand helped them move through the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; controlled Andorhal so they could liberate it from the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;. Halsand accepted and next day he guided them through some mountains paths in order to bypass the &lt;a href=\"Syndicate\"&gt;Syndicate&lt;/a&gt; camps along the way.\nAfter the fatal battle, Halsand managed to return but due to accidentally drinking the infected water in the city's nearby river, when he reached the estate he was already an undead. He tried to warn his wife to kill him before the madness took him. In the last second, his son Jake stabbed Halsand from behind thinking he was a random monster. Upon realizing who he was, Jake regretted it, but his dying father praised him for protecting their family.\nSpeculation.\nThe exact location of Halsand's estate is not given but judging the fact the estate is surrounded by mountains, that Halsand mentions Syndicate camps on their way to Chillwind Camp, and that it only took several hours to get there, it is likely located in the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac Mountains&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt;."}

Deep within lower Blackrock Spire she is housed with her brood of pups in Halycon's Nest and is heavily guarded by orcs and worgs alike.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"Halycon comes from a long line of great worgs bred for their ferocity and loyalty. Over the years, the den mother has produced an astonishing number of savage offspring. Rumors have spread that she is a demonic hound gifted to &lt;a href=\"Rend%20Blackhand\"&gt;Rend Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; by a &lt;a href=\"pit%20lord\"&gt;pit lord&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nStrategies.\nGeneral strategy.\nHalycon is a fairly easy fight. If your group is unable to &lt;a href=\"pull\"&gt;pull&lt;/a&gt; the pups without having her tag along, have your &lt;a href=\"AoE\"&gt;AoE&lt;/a&gt; classes handle them. They're non-elites, making them easily cleaned up. Also be sure to fight inside of her lair because once she is dead Gizrul will come down the hallway afterwards. Be sure to have your &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; re-plant their &lt;a href=\"totem\"&gt;totem&lt;/a&gt;s inside as well to avoid unnecessary Gizrul &lt;a href=\"aggro\"&gt;aggro&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce Halycon herself has been aggroed, have your casters and healers run into her lair and onto the higher ground near the back to provide distance between them and Halycon in case the &lt;a href=\"tank\"&gt;tank&lt;/a&gt; loses aggro. Once her pups are down, simply &lt;a href=\"DPS\"&gt;DPS&lt;/a&gt; and keep the tank alive and you can defeat her no problem.\nTwo rogues and a druid.\nHalycon is also easily killable with a party of two &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt;s and a &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;. Since all three players can &lt;a href=\"stealth\"&gt;stealth&lt;/a&gt; through Blackrock Spire until you've reached Halycon's Nest, the fight is quite possible.\nThere are two ways to deal with the pups: you can &lt;a href=\"vanish\"&gt;vanish&lt;/a&gt; to kill three at a time until they are cleared or you can pull the whole group of pups out into the hallway and clean them up there before taking on Halycon herself. Keep in mind if you clear in the hallway there are a few other mobs that you'll need to take care of first.\nOnce the room is &lt;a href=\"add\"&gt;add&lt;/a&gt;-free, let the druid tank in &lt;a href=\"Bear%20Form\"&gt;Bear Form&lt;/a&gt; while the rogues deal DPS and manage aggro if necessary with &lt;a href=\"Feint\"&gt;Feint&lt;/a&gt;.

Gizrul will come in afterwards so if you don't want a messy fight, be sure to stealth as soon as you have looted Halycon's corpse. If possible it is recommended that those who use the \"two rogue/one druid\" strategy stick around after she has been slain due to Gizrul having the chance of dropping the &lt;a href=\"Wildheart%20Spaulders\"&gt;Wildheart Spaulders&lt;/a&gt; for the druid's first &lt;a href=\"Class%20set\"&gt;Class set&lt;/a&gt;."}

A tauren who requires a powerful weapon sometimes embarks on a complex quest to create a Hammer of Life.\nA Hammer of Life is a weapon that embodies a tauren\u2019s respect for nature. The tauren spends three days in the wild, meditating and communing with her ancestral spirits. At the end of this time, the tauren scouts the area and hunts the first animal she sees. Upon killing her quarry, the tauren brings its carcass back to her tribe. There, the tribe\u2019s shaman assists her in crafting a Hammer of Life.\nNo part of the tauren\u2019s prey goes to waste. The animal\u2019s bones form the hammer\u2019s haft; its organs, stitched into a skin bag, make the hammer head. Sinew and strips of animal hide bind the hammer together, and the animal\u2019s teeth and claws adorn the weapon. The shaman calls upon the Earth Mother to bless the hammer and its wielder, and at the end of the crafting, the hammer morphs into a more aesthetically pleasing form. Its haft appears carved of pale wood, and its head of white stone.\nAnyone gripping the hammer, however, always feels smooth, cold bone under his hand, and the hammer seems to pulse with life.

After his death just before the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;War of the Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt;, the hammer mysteriously disappeared. Centuries later, a scroll was found in the &lt;a href=\"Library%20%28Ironforge%29\"&gt;Ironforge library&lt;/a&gt; that stated that the hammer had been broken into three pieces. During the chaos of the war, each clan had, in one way or another, managed to obtain one of the fragments:\nUnder decree of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;Council of Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt;, the Hammer of the High King was to be reassembled as a symbol of the clans' newfound unity (although Kurdran was loathe to give up the scepter for personal reasons) and reforged by a Dark Iron smith. The day before the reforging, however, &lt;a href=\"Advisor%20Belgrum\"&gt;Advisor Belgrum&lt;/a&gt; discovered that the parchment was a well-made fake and had probably been planted in the Library. At best, the three pieces may have been found after the civil war, and at worst the head and crystal were likely also fakes. Despite this, &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Moira%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Moira Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt; agreed to continue with the reforging and keep secret the forgery. Kurdran disagreed with the lie, and later in the night he stole the Wildhammer scepter that was to be used as the hammer's handle. A confrontation with Moira revealed that she was ultimately responsible for the whole plan, and it was insinuated that the Dark Irons planted the scroll under her orders. When it was discovered that the scepter was missing Kurdran admitted he had stolen it, but instead of letting it be reforged and allowing the lie to continue) he smashed the scepter with his &lt;a href=\"stormhammer\"&gt;stormhammer&lt;/a&gt;. Kurdran declared that the union of the dwarven clans shouldn't start with reforging a hammer that could be fractured again. Instead, he proposed that the dwarven clans move forward from the past and unite with a fresh start. Muradin gladly joined him, and Moira had no choice but help in fracturing their fragments lest she lose face in the eyes of her people."}

Taught by &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; himself, he is the highest-ranked tauren in the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt;. As many of his people do, Hamuul believes very much in the balance between nature and the races of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Hamuul was a childhood friend and fierce supporter of High Chieftain &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;, and teaches the ways of druidism to his honored brethren. After Cairne was murdered by &lt;a href=\"Magatha%20Grimtotem\"&gt;Magatha Grimtotem&lt;/a&gt;, Hamuul continued his role as advisor to Cairne's son &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine&lt;/a&gt;, the new High Chieftain, as well as teaching young druids.\nAs one of Azeroth's most venerable druids, Hamuul has aided in the defense of the world on numerous occasions. He battled the forces of &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; the Firelord during the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20Deathwing\"&gt;war against Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, and helped lead the Cenarion Circle to war against &lt;a href=\"Xavius\"&gt;Xavius&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nDruidism.\nDuring the Battle of Mount Hyjal, Hamuul was stirred by the dedication of the druids and was inspired by them. After the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, Hamuul sought out the night elf Archdruid &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, befriending him and asking to be taught the druidic arts. Malfurion agreed, to strenuous and xenophobic objections of former student Archdruid &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt;. Hamuul joined the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt;, and his new \"&lt;a href=\"shan%27do\"&gt;shan'do&lt;/a&gt;\" taught Hamuul many secrets of the wild and blessed him with the &lt;a href=\"touch%20of%20nature\"&gt;touch of nature&lt;/a&gt;, thus soon mastering the druidic arts with such proficiency that he rightfully earned the title archdruid for himself. In the few years since that time, Hamuul has become an honored member of the (predominantly night elf) Cenarion Circle, and is recognized as the first tauren druid in nearly twenty generations. Hamuul has a daughter, , who is a Cenarion Circle member like her father.\nForsaken and the Horde.\n&lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; sent emissaries to various factions in search of allies. The kind-hearted tauren of Thunder Bluff proved to be the most promising contact. Specifically, Archdruid Hamuul Runetotem, striving for diplomacy, saw the potential for redemption in Sylvanas\u2019 people, even though he was fully aware of the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;'s sinister nature. Thus, the tauren convinced Warchief &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, despite his misgivings, to forge an alliance of convenience between the Forsaken and the Horde.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nHamuul resides in the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Rise\"&gt;Elder Rise&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt;. From there he mentors young druids. He used to send tauren adventurers to the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt; as the tauren druids felt some lurking power in the Barrens. Further investigation revealed that the source of the power came from the &lt;a href=\"Wailing%20Caverns\"&gt;Wailing Caverns&lt;/a&gt;. Hamuul entered to sleep and dreamt about a cult of druids in the cavern.\nHe was also interested in the studies of &lt;a href=\"Un%27Goro%20Soil\"&gt;Un'Goro Soil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Morrowgrain\"&gt;Morrowgrain&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorld of Warcraft: The Comic.\nHamuul appears briefly in the \"\", when &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Broll%20Bearmantle\"&gt;Broll&lt;/a&gt; are taken to &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt;. Following their victory over a rampaging earth elemental in the &lt;a href=\"Pools%20of%20Vision\"&gt;Pools of Vision&lt;/a&gt;, Hamuul invites them to his tent where he recounts the legend of &lt;a href=\"Lo%27Gosh\"&gt;Lo'Gosh&lt;/a&gt;. He then grants them the gift of a &lt;a href=\"hippogryph\"&gt;hippogryph&lt;/a&gt; feather. Although Varian is confused about the usefulness of the gift, Broll understands what the archdruid had really given them. They use it to summon a hippogryph to them and flee their slavery.\nMuch later, Hamuul becomes a part of the new &lt;a href=\"New%20Council%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Council of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt; as a representative of the druids. He aids them in their fight against &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt;, being one of the many to give &lt;a href=\"Med%27an\"&gt;Med'an&lt;/a&gt; some of his power. Although a difficult fight, they are eventually able to claim victory.\nStormrage.\nIn the time since his first meeting with Broll, the two have become close friends. In fact, Broll considers the tauren his closest friend barring Varian and &lt;a href=\"Valeera%20Sanguinar\"&gt;Valeera&lt;/a&gt;. Hamuul is frequently Broll's confidante, especially in matters where the latter is troubled by disturbing visions and dreams. When &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt; summoned the archdruids and Broll to &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;, Hamuul was surprisingly among them. He met Broll after he landed, and the two went together to the decided meeting spot. There, Fandral instructed the gathered that they would be aiding in the healing of the &lt;a href=\"World%20Tree\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt;, along with continuing to find a way to wake &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion&lt;/a&gt;. Broll, however, started to continually lose focus and lapse into vivid hallucinations. Hamuul covered him, pretending to speak with him in such episodes. He later suggested to Broll that the visions may have some meaning, as reluctant as his friend is to accept it.\nThen Broll suddenly decided to leave the congregation, pursuing an alternative means to save their teacher. Understanding that what his friend may be planning could have a greater effect than Fandral's own plans, the archdruid covered for his disappearance. However, Fandral was quick to discover the other's actions, and even finds that he had stolen the &lt;a href=\"Idol%20of%20Remulos\"&gt;Idol of Remulos&lt;/a&gt;. Fandral gave Hamuul a disapproving look, believing the tauren had aided Broll in this but does not say more. Nonetheless, it was enough for the other druids to shun the archdruid, save &lt;a href=\"Naralex\"&gt;Naralex&lt;/a&gt; and a handful of others. In order to not cause trouble for his friends, Hamuul avoided conversation with them anyway.\nFollowing a break between attempts to heal Teldrassil, Hamuul decided to lay a hand on the tree itself. Shockingly, he was able to hear whispers from the tree, and not like the usual way druids listen to nature speak. He then realized the World Tree was going mad, and attempts to tell the rest of the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Circle&lt;/a&gt; of this. Fandral, however, dismissed his claims, stating that it was only the old tauren's weariness as they all had been expending so much energy to heal the tree. Fandral then apologized to him for silently condemning him for Broll's actions, and instructed Hamuul to rest earlier than the others. The tauren, however, was unconvinced his tired mind was playing tricks on him.\nEventually, he and Naralex discovered Fandral's duplicity, having been driven mad by the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; and Teldrassil itself. &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt;, Naralex, and he were silenced before they could act against him, as Fandral easily overpowered them. Fortunately, Malfurion arrived thanks to Hamuul's warnings echoes not soon after, freeing the three as he fights Fandral. Though they were freed, Naralex was unconscious and Hamuul tried to heal him, but he needed to do more. Hamuul, Broll, Malfurion, and Shandris were then able to warn the other druids, who although not entirely believing them, are of reasonable enough mind to discover the truth themselves. Hamuul is, obviously, one of the first to immediately side with Malfurion, and later plays an important part in their final conflict against the Emerald Nightmare. While many of the others take their fight into the Dream, Hamuul stays awake to defend their bodies against the apparitions that appear in the waking world. After these events, Hamuul takes up the human &lt;a href=\"Lucan%20Foxblood\"&gt;Lucan Foxblood&lt;/a&gt; as his student to further assist him in utilizing his unique abilities.\nFollowing their hard-fought victory, Hamuul is among the many to bear witness to the marriage of Malfurion and Tyrande.\nElemental Unrest.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Unrest\"&gt;Elemental Unrest&lt;/a&gt;, Hamuul held guard and warned adventurers about the approaching danger.\nThe Shattering: Prelude to Cataclysm.\nHamuul was present with Cairne in Orgrimmar during a ceremony of welcoming Garrosh's return from Northrend, where it was decided that Hamuul will have a meeting with Cenarion Circle's members of supplies for the Horde. After Thrall left for Outland, Cairne met with Hamuul at &lt;a href=\"Red%20Rocks\"&gt;Red Rocks&lt;/a&gt; and discussed how Garrosh let Orgrimmar rebuilt. Chieftain did not like the old-ways Horde and now, Orgrimmar looked like as if it was their bastion. Hamuul explained Cairne that he was sending messages to the Circle. After all, it was set that the meeting is going to happen in Ashenvale as Remulos was not involved and did not bless the meeting.\nLater on, Hamuul and a group of Tauren druids set up a peace summit with Archdruid &lt;a href=\"Elerethe%20Renferal\"&gt;Elerethe Renferal&lt;/a&gt; and a group of Night Elf druids, in the hopes of reducing the rising tensions between the Horde and the Alliance, following the murder and skinning of a group of &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;. A group of &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; orcs disguised as members of the Horde interrupted the &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt; summit and killed all the Night Elves. When &lt;a href=\"Gorkrak\"&gt;Gorkrak&lt;/a&gt; identified himself as the leader of the orc band, Hamuul questioned if &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; had sent him to interrupt the summit. Gorkrak feigned ignorance of who Garrosh was and then signaled another orc behind Hamuul to shoot an arrow into his back. Satisfied that suspicion of the murders were being pinned on Garrosh after murdering the rest of the tauren druids, he ordered Hamuul to be buried with the corpses of the other dead druids and was left for dead. He crawled out the grave as the sole survivor of the summit and called out for an owl to inform &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; of what had transpired.\nHamuul was eventually retrieved and ended up at &lt;a href=\"Camp%20Taurajo\"&gt;Camp Taurajo&lt;/a&gt; to recover. It was here that he learned of the murder of his childhood friend and High Chieftain. Hamuul immediately set to work on advising Cairne's son and heir, &lt;a href=\"Baine\"&gt;Baine&lt;/a&gt;, as he had with his father. Hamuul's knowledge, wisdom, and druid contacts set in motion the retaking of Thunder Bluff from the traitorous &lt;a href=\"Grimtotem%20tribe\"&gt;Grimtotem tribe&lt;/a&gt;, restoring Cairne's son as the rightful leader of their people.\nHamuul would later bid farewell to his friend, by Cairne's funeral pyre at the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Rocks\"&gt;Red Rocks&lt;/a&gt; and accompanied Baine to a meeting with Garrosh Hellscream.\nAs Our Fathers Before Us.\n&lt;a href=\"Garrosh\"&gt;Garrosh&lt;/a&gt; had arrived in Thunder Bluff at the request of &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;. Hamuul had opened the negotiations for water supplies to be transported to Orgrimmar and things between the young orc and tauren weren't going very well. After much arguing, Baine had decided to give Garrosh the water he needed. As shipments of water were being sent out, &lt;a href=\"Quilboar\"&gt;Quilboar&lt;/a&gt; continuously attacked the caravans, killing everyone and stealing their possessions. Baine, worrying what to make of these attacks, sought out Hamuul to see if he had discovered anything. To his disappointment, the &lt;a href=\"Archdruid\"&gt;Archdruid&lt;/a&gt; had not discovered anything.\nAfter much research, Hamuul had finally discovered the reason for the sudden attacks was due to water becoming scarce and the quilboar desperately trying to obtain it. The two then went to tell Garrosh of their discovery, with Garrosh stating if more attacks come about, he would take matters into his own hands.\nWhen another huge attack had passed, Baine had doubts about his leadership and the tauren's place in the \"new &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;\" that Garrosh rules. Hamuul reassured the younger tauren, saying he is a great leader whether he believed it or not.\nGarrosh, fed up with the tauren's peaceful approach to the looming threat of the quilboar decided he, along with fifteen &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron\"&gt;Kor'kron&lt;/a&gt; would end the threat once and for all. They invaded the pigmen's home, where they would have met their ends, save for Baine, Hamuul, and a group of &lt;a href=\"Sunwalkers\"&gt;Sunwalkers&lt;/a&gt; coming to their aid after Baine had realized what Garrosh would likely do. After escaping the tunnels, the tauren, along with Garrosh and the quilboar who followed the invaders to the surface, all came to a halt. Hamuul took a step forward, and with a few words slammed his staff into the ground, causing water to pour from the gash in the earth. The water had swept many of the quilboar back down their tunnel, with the rest being knocked to the ground. Baine told those remaining that this new water source was a gift from the tauren for the quilboars' use, and to bother them no longer. With that, Baine sent Garrosh off and he and the other tauren returned home, the quilboar no longer a threat.\nCataclysm.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"Children%27s%20Week\"&gt;Children's Week&lt;/a&gt;, Hamuul can be seen alongside Baine and &lt;a href=\"Kador%20Cloudsong\"&gt;Kador Cloudsong&lt;/a&gt; honoring Cairne near the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Rocks\"&gt;Red Rocks&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn Cataclysm, Hamuul Runetotem, along with &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, assisted &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt; in protecting the recovering world tree &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt; from the resurgent &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt;.\nHamuul assists in the freeing of &lt;a href=\"Tortolla\"&gt;Tortolla&lt;/a&gt; and succeeds in bringing the powerful ancient onto the side of the &lt;a href=\"Guardians%20of%20Hyjal\"&gt;Guardians of Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;. He and Malfurion join with &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Sulfuron%20Spire\"&gt;Sulfuron Spire&lt;/a&gt;, and together push back Ragnaros into the &lt;a href=\"Firelands\"&gt;Firelands&lt;/a&gt;. With the immediate threat dealt with, though Ragnaros still at large, Hamuul suggests that they confer with the leaders of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; to best plan their next move. He appears to be wearing the druid &lt;a href=\"Tier%206\"&gt;Tier 6&lt;/a&gt; armor.\nHamuul is attacked by a powerful &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Flame\"&gt;Druid of the Flame&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Leyara\"&gt;Leyara&lt;/a&gt;, after her induction into their corrupted order by &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt;. Leyara is elated with having supposedly killed the powerful Archdruid of Thunder Bluff, and leaves. Hamuul's body is later found by the Cenarion Circle, who quickly transports the Arch-druid - clinging onto life - to the &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary%20of%20Malorne\"&gt;Sanctuary of Malorne&lt;/a&gt;. Subsequently the player has a chance to be offered a daily quest from &lt;a href=\"Dorda%27en%20Nightweaver\"&gt;Dorda'en Nightweaver&lt;/a&gt; at the Sanctuary of Malorne related to the ongoing treatment of Hamuul's injuries. Over time, Hamuul begins to recover his strength.\nLater, Leyara reappears and begins to chide Malfurion for his own weakness, noting that she will destroy him just as she did Hamuul. However, Malfurion only mentions that Hamuul is not dead at all, and a revitalized Hamuul himself disposes of her - wishing her to finally find peace in death. The two friends then retreat.\nDuring the battle into the &lt;a href=\"Firelands\"&gt;Firelands&lt;/a&gt;, Hamuul, along with &lt;a href=\"Malfurion\"&gt;Malfurion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;, assisted heroes in doing battle with &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; in his most powerful form, finally ending the Firelord's power.\nTides of War.\nHamuul was present during the meeting of the Horde leaders when Garrosh revealed his plan to attack &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt;, when Baine and Garrosh confronted one another about the plan Hamuul stepped forward to aid Baine as &lt;a href=\"Malkorok\"&gt;Malkorok&lt;/a&gt; did for Garrosh until both were ordered to stand down. Following the Razing of Northwatch, Hamuul joined his High Chieftain and other members of the Horde in a secret meeting in order to discuss Hellscream's actions (the use of molten giants to destroy Northwatch and giving the Alliance more than enough to send aid Theramore). However, thanks to treachery from within the group was discovered and Baine pointed out that the meeting only occurred because Garrosh would not see them. After Hellscream retorted that he did not answer them, a disgruntled Hamuul pointed out that Thrall would have seen them only for Garrosh to point at his brown skin and ask if he looked like Thrall. In response, Hamuul retorted that no one would mistake Garrosh for Thrall, an insult that went over Garrosh's head (who was mollified) and caused Malkorok to narrow his eye at the tauren.\nFollowing the seemingly failed attack on Theramore, Hamuul would then bear witness to Hellscream unleashing the &lt;a href=\"Focusing%20Iris\"&gt;Focusing Iris&lt;/a&gt; empowered mana bomb on the city.\nLegion.\nThe Cenarion Circle planned to move the bulk of its forces to the &lt;a href=\"Dreamgrove\"&gt;Dreamgrove&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Val%27sharah\"&gt;Val'sharah&lt;/a&gt;, the ancient forest where &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt; taught Malfurion, in order to combat the return of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Hamuul, Malfurion, &lt;a href=\"Naralex\"&gt;Naralex&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zen%27tabra\"&gt;Zen'tabra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Remulos\"&gt;Remulos&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;druid hero&lt;/a&gt; opened a portal to the Emerald Dream at the &lt;a href=\"Stormrage%20Barrow%20Dens\"&gt;Stormrage Barrow Dens&lt;/a&gt;, allowing their forces to move swiftly over vast distances.\nHamuul later led a small party consisting of himself, &lt;a href=\"Skylord%20Omnuron\"&gt;Skylord Omnuron&lt;/a&gt;, Zen'tabra, and &lt;a href=\"Celestine%20of%20the%20Harvest\"&gt;Celestine of the Harvest&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; to investigate reports of a demonic presence in the area. Overwhelmed, they were soundly defeated and the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity%20%28Hyjal%29\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; was almost completely destroyed. The arrival of the druid hero and &lt;a href=\"Lyessa%20Bloomwatcher\"&gt;Lyessa Bloomwatcher&lt;/a&gt;, who had come to cleanse &lt;a href=\"G%27Hanir%2C%20the%20Mother%20Tree\"&gt;G'Hanir, the Mother Tree&lt;/a&gt; was their salvation, and the three druids were healed just in time to battle &lt;a href=\"Destromath\"&gt;Destromath&lt;/a&gt;. Destromath was defeated when the newly cleansed G'Hanir was used to summon many &lt;a href=\"wisp\"&gt;wisp&lt;/a&gt;s to defeat him, and afterwards Hamuul stayed behind to ensure that Omnuron and &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Talon\"&gt;his forces&lt;/a&gt; could reestablish themselves on the mountain.\nHamuul and his daughter &lt;a href=\"Bashana%20Runetotem\"&gt;Bashana&lt;/a&gt; later help to cleanse the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dreamway\"&gt;Emerald Dreamway&lt;/a&gt; when it comes under attack by the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;. He was then part of the druids that communed with &lt;a href=\"Malorne\"&gt;Malorne&lt;/a&gt; beneath Nordrassil. Hamuul was also among the druids that entered &lt;a href=\"Malorne%27s%20Nightmare\"&gt;Malorne's Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;. Afterward, Hamuul pledged himself to the Archdruid of the Dreamgrove.\nHamuuul attended a dinner with the Horde leaders after the defeat of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nBefore the Storm.\nSome time after the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20Campaign\"&gt;Argus Campaign&lt;/a&gt;, Hamuul had a bad dream about Azeroth. Warchief &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, her escort, Baine Bloodhoof, and &lt;a href=\"Master%20Gadrin\"&gt;Master Gadrin&lt;/a&gt; gathered in &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Rise\"&gt;Spirit Rise&lt;/a&gt; to discuss the tragic event, the loss of druids in &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;, and even suggesting to build a new Cenarion Hold. After Sylvanas said that she would discuss what the &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Cartel\"&gt;Bilgewater&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s could find in Silithus with the rest of the Horde, Hamuul asked her if she would share it with the Alliance as well. Sylvanas was sure that King Anduin wouldn't share theirs with the Horde so she didn't see why she would do that. Hamuul responded that Azeroth belongs to all, to which Sylvans said that one day \"all\" will hopefully mean only the Horde, but in the meantime, she would choose the Horde over the Alliance that destroyed Taurajo. The archdruid wanted to oppose her again, but she cut him off stating that she would not take it well. She is the Warchief and she decides. Hamuul receded, his ears close to his skull. Although he previously opted to have the Forsaken in the Horde, Sylvanas now considered him a thorn in her side.\nHe later attended a feast for the &lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20tauren\"&gt;Highmountain tauren&lt;/a&gt; in Thunder Bluff.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nHamuul was part of the dual Cenarion Circle and &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt; forces aiding &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; to heal &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt; from the wound inflicted by &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile Sylvanas and Saurfang loyalists clashed in &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;, Hamuul remained in &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt; to help the injured Baine. After Saurfang's death and Sylvanas's abandonment of the Horde, &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Champions&lt;/a&gt; arrived to deliver the news to Hamuul, Baine, &lt;a href=\"Mayla%20Highmountain\"&gt;Mayla Highmountain&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ji%20Firepaw\"&gt;Ji Firepaw&lt;/a&gt;.
