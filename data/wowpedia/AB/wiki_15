She is deaf and communicates through sign language. She is always accompanied by her interpreter, &lt;a href=\"Okir\"&gt;Okir&lt;/a&gt;, and her hearing dog, &lt;a href=\"Basran\"&gt;Basran&lt;/a&gt;. Sansok is well-liked by Clan Shikaar, being their most skilled &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;, a trusted leader and mentor, and a fierce defender of the &lt;a href=\"Maruuk%20Centaur\"&gt;Maruuk&lt;/a&gt;. Her spiritual advisor is &lt;a href=\"Ohn%20Seshteng\"&gt;Ohn Seshteng&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nSince a very young age, Sansok has personally trained &lt;a href=\"bakar\"&gt;bakar&lt;/a&gt; to serve as her hearing dogs during hunts. Her first kill was a powerful icy &lt;a href=\"bear\"&gt;bear&lt;/a&gt; deep in the &lt;a href=\"Azure%20Span\"&gt;Azure Span&lt;/a&gt; tundra, which made her and her bakar the talk of the &lt;a href=\"Khural\"&gt;Khural&lt;/a&gt;. Sansok's current companion, &lt;a href=\"Basran\"&gt;Basran&lt;/a&gt;, is her third bakar and the son of her first. Most members of Clan Shikaar know sign language and can speak with Sansok on their own, but many others cannot and instead communicate with her through her interpreter, &lt;a href=\"Okir\"&gt;Okir&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"green%20dragonflight\"&gt;green dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; returned to the Ohn'ahran Plains, Sansok prepared the Shikaar at &lt;a href=\"Timberstep%20Outpost\"&gt;Timberstep Outpost&lt;/a&gt; to travel to &lt;a href=\"Maruukai\"&gt;Maruukai&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Khural\"&gt;Khural&lt;/a&gt; gathering. The other clans and the rest of the Shikaar had already traveled to the city, and Sansok's caravan was the last to set out. The &lt;a href=\"Primalists\"&gt;Primalist&lt;/a&gt; leader &lt;a href=\"Koroleth\"&gt;Koroleth&lt;/a&gt; approached Sansok and tried to convince her to ally with them, but the khan refused. At the same time, &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s came to the Ohn'ahran Plains to make contact with the green dragons. &lt;a href=\"Scout%20Tomul\"&gt;Scout Tomul&lt;/a&gt; introduced the outsiders to Sansok, who shared that the dragons would be sending an emissary to the Khural and agreed to bring the adventurers along on the journey if they lent their aid to the clan.\nDuring the Shikaar caravan's journey to Maruukai, &lt;a href=\"Ohn%20Seshteng\"&gt;Ohn Seshteng&lt;/a&gt; received a bad omen from &lt;a href=\"Ohn%27ahra\"&gt;Ohn'ahra&lt;/a&gt;, and Sansok stated that the Shikaar should be on their guard when they arrived in Maruukai. Once in the city, Sansok sent the outsiders to learn more about the Maruuk by acquainting themselves with the other major clans: &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Nokhud\"&gt;Nokhud&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Ohn%27ir\"&gt;Ohn'ir&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Teerai\"&gt;Teerai&lt;/a&gt;. Shortly after, the dragons' emissary &lt;a href=\"Gemisath\"&gt;Gemisath&lt;/a&gt; arrived, and Sansok went with Okir and Basran to speak to &lt;a href=\"Khanam%20Matra%20Sarest\"&gt;Khanam Matra Sarest&lt;/a&gt; atop the city's &lt;a href=\"krutal\"&gt;krutal&lt;/a&gt;. Sarest agreed to honor the ancient pact between the Maruuk and the green dragons, but the Nokhud's leader &lt;a href=\"Balakar%20Khan\"&gt;Balakar Khan&lt;/a&gt; interrupted the meeting by revealing his allegiance with the Primalists and killing Gemisath. After adventurers saved the city from Balakar's forces, Sarest told Sansok and &lt;a href=\"Tigari%20Khan\"&gt;Tigari Khan&lt;/a&gt; to prepare their clans for war.\nLater, Scout Tomul reported to the khans that the Nokhud had attacked the &lt;a href=\"Horn%20of%20Drusahl\"&gt;Horn of Drusahl&lt;/a&gt;. Sarest went with the adventurers to confront the Nokhud, and ordered Sansok and Tigari to prepare their clans to march on &lt;a href=\"Nokhudon%20Hold\"&gt;Nokhudon Hold&lt;/a&gt; once &lt;a href=\"Ohn%27ahra\"&gt;Ohn'ahra&lt;/a&gt; had been found and she had blown the Horn to summon the green dragons. Shortly after, Sarest told Tomul to inform the khans about a change of plans: instead of heading to Nokhudon Hold, they would march to the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Gardens\"&gt;Emerald Gardens&lt;/a&gt; and join the dragons against the Primalists. During the battle against the Primalists in the &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Scar\"&gt;Storm Scar&lt;/a&gt;, Sansok and Okir guarded the southern edge of the battlefield alongside &lt;a href=\"Guard-Captain%20Alowen\"&gt;Guard-Captain Alowen&lt;/a&gt;. After the Primalists were defeated, the green dragon &lt;a href=\"Merithra\"&gt;Merithra&lt;/a&gt; invited the khans to join her at the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Bough\"&gt;Ancient Bough&lt;/a&gt;, where they held a ceremony to empower the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Oathstone\"&gt;Emerald Oathstone&lt;/a&gt; and renew the ancient pact between dragons and centaur through an exchange of ceremonial gifts. Sansok's gift, representing Clan Shikaar, was the &lt;a href=\"Shikaar%20Spear\"&gt;ceremonial spear&lt;/a&gt; she'd earned from her first hunt."}

Originally sappers were mostly &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt;, but now many races are supporting their ground troops with these powerful &lt;a href=\"Technology\"&gt;technological&lt;/a&gt; devices. &lt;a href=\"Bombardier\"&gt;Bombardier&lt;/a&gt;s are another form of sappers, mixing their field experience with the skills of a &lt;a href=\"tinker\"&gt;tinker&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; casters will be called sappers due to their abilities to drain life and magical energy out of their enemies (examples being the &lt;a href=\"Hakkari%20Sapper\"&gt;Hakkari Sapper&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Faceless%20Sapper\"&gt;Faceless Sapper&lt;/a&gt;) but these will not be described here. Drivers of &lt;a href=\"demolisher\"&gt;demolisher&lt;/a&gt;s are also called demolitionists even though they are not handlers of explosive weapons.\nSecond War.\nGoblin Sappers.\nThe mischievous goblin sappers were known throughout the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; for their incredible aptitude for destruction. These diabolical &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s were invariably armed with extremely volatile explosives; which enabled them to level enemy structures and weapon emplacements. Although the sappers were highly unpredictable and insubordinate, they had became necessary to the plans of conquest maintained by the Horde.\nThese goblins were members of the &lt;a href=\"Steamwheedle%20Cartel\"&gt;Steamwheedle Cartel&lt;/a&gt;. They were well versed in sneaking up to a fortress and setting off their deadly charges.\nDemolition Squad.\nFrom the deep, subterranean halls of &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarven&lt;/a&gt; demolition squads came to aid the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; in their crusade for the liberation of Khaz Modan. As masters in the handling and arming of explosives, these squads were renowned for their ability to demolish any obstacle - from a mighty wall to a bulwark of solid stone. Reckless and bold, these dwarves were zealous in their loyalty to the Alliance and would not hesitate to detonate their explosive payload should the situation turn grim...\nThese teams later evolved into the dwarven &lt;a href=\"mortar%20team\"&gt;mortar team&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThird War.\nAfter the defeat of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, the goblins realized their mistake and left the Horde. They are now a neutral force, making money off every side. Explosive team of sappers could be hired at special &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20laboratory\"&gt;laboratories&lt;/a&gt; found all over &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the war &lt;a href=\"Monte%20Gazlowe\"&gt;Monte Gazlowe&lt;/a&gt; sent a team of sappers to the &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar%20Tunnels\"&gt;Orgrimmar Tunnels&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nAs time passes, more and more races are becoming tech-savy. This can be represented with the appearance of new sapper-style classes such as the grenadiers, soldiers specialized in the throwing of grenades and assault operations. The &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt; is particularly adept of such tactics and a huge amount of their troops are equipped with grenades or at least some sort of &lt;a href=\"explosive\"&gt;explosive&lt;/a&gt; device.\nSurprisingly, compared to their &lt;a href=\"Aqir\"&gt;Aqir&lt;/a&gt; brethren, the &lt;a href=\"mantid\"&gt;mantid&lt;/a&gt; are quite adept at using technology to turn the tide of battle, and several sappers, saboteurs and &lt;a href=\"bombardier\"&gt;bombardier&lt;/a&gt;s can be found among their ranks.\nIn the RPG.\nIf ever a sound was associated with a particular class, it's the sapper. Quite simply, sappers love to blow things up. However, unlike many goblin &lt;a href=\"tinker\"&gt;tinker&lt;/a&gt;s, they don't necessarily like the idea of killing themselves in the process. No, to a sapper, the fiery blast of a good explosion is a form of art unto itself. Some spend a great deal of their lives trying to find new and interesting ways to generate beautiful, classy explosions. Sappers are experts in all sorts of &lt;a href=\"explosive\"&gt;explosive&lt;/a&gt; devices, from small firecrackers to powerful &lt;a href=\"seaforium%20charge\"&gt;seaforium charge&lt;/a&gt;s capable of blowing holes in thick &lt;a href=\"castle\"&gt;castle&lt;/a&gt; walls. Even when they don't have a prepared explosive available, a good sapper can put one together out of whatever natural materials he can find lying around. \n&lt;a href=\"Goblin\"&gt;Goblin&lt;/a&gt;s are likely candidates for this class, since goblins like making things go boom! &lt;a href=\"Gnome\"&gt;Gnome&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; also make able sappers, with humans following close behind. The Horde made heavy use of goblin sappers in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;; indeed, goblin sappers were a key aspect of the Horde's strategy. Thus, the Horde knows how effective this class can be. In an adventuring party, a sapper often takes the role of a rogue or ranged combat support. He disdains typical rogue skills such as opening locks and disarming traps - he simply destroys such obstacles. When a battle erupts, he stays behind the lines, lobbing bombs into groups of enemies or employing fire-based &lt;a href=\"Technology\"&gt;technological&lt;/a&gt; devices to pick off more determined foes.\nA sapper generally takes great care to avoid harming himself; but still, he spends so much time around explosives that accidents are bound to happen. As a result, his body gradually becomes covered with a layer of tough scarring that protects against fire.\nThe sapper has learned new tricks to increase the yield of his explosives. Any grenade, bomb or other technological device he creates that deals explosive fire damage deals an additional damage per die.\nThe sapper is an expert in both the crafting and use of explosive devices. Any sort of bomb or grenade \u2014 basically anything that blows up \u2014 is his specialty.\nA sapper can attempt to build small explosive devices out of whatever materials are available. Even in the midst of an untamed wilderness, he can usually locate certain plants or minerals that, when mixed together, become something flammable.\nThe sapper is an expert on the delivery of explosive devices from a distance, whether employing any thrown or launched explosive device (such as a mortar).\nThe highly skilled sapper has transformed explosives into works of art. He can deploy a perfect blast \u2014 a thing of beauty (at least to himself and his allies). He can use this ability with any explosive device \u2014 as small as a grenade all the way up to massive wall-cracking charges \u2014 but he must prepare, set and activate the device himself. Doing so takes twice as long as normal for the device in question, but if it is successfully set off, the explosive deals the maximum possible.\nGoblin sapper.\nThe Goblin Sappers were known for their mischievous streak and aptitude for destruction and once the most lethal of demolitions groups known in the Horde. Even with the explosive reputation of &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20Engineering\"&gt;Goblin Engineers&lt;/a&gt;, the Sappers were some of the first to bring Goblin explosives into wartimes and to utilize their instability successfully.\nSapper groups were first enlisted into the Horde during the Second War, despite their reluctance to obey orders and adhere to authority. They were composed of a group of three Goblins adorning bandoliers of dynamite and armed with barrels of TNT, detonators, and a vast array of other volatile explosives. The tactic of these demolition squads was pure suicide: trigger the destructive equipment while charging head-on toward the target or obstacle. Despite the mortality rate of the Sapper\u2019s technique, their specialty in destroying enemies, buildings, and even sheer rock is barely matched by Dwarven Demolition.\nWith the end of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Neutral\"&gt;Neutral&lt;/a&gt;ity the Goblins have taken, the need for Sappers has come to virtually a halt. It is possible that the only remaining Goblin Sapper teams that operate are for excavation purposes and that the newer generations of Goblins have harnessed their destructive capabilities towards mastering and teaching the technique of explosives through &lt;a href=\"Engineering\"&gt;Engineering&lt;/a&gt;.\nA great number of sappers - primarily goblin sappers - perished during the last war, mostly as a result of their overzealous use of too many explosives at once. Those who survived have become much more focused in their art, preferring precision to risks. Generally, the older a sapper is, the more careful and cautious he is - and the more respect his associates give him.\nDwarven sappers.\n\"Cheerfully striding onto the battlefield is a team of odd &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt;, scarred and blackened faces, a mace in one hand, a pistol in the other, hauling kegs of powder strapped to their backs. They seem to ignore the rest of the field.\"\nSappers are engines of destruction; when the Alliance needs a structure removed from the battlefield, a dwarven demolition team is sent to blow it away. Sappers invite bloody death (and hearing loss) every time they go into action, but the sight of a &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; gatehouse collapsing into a pile of rubble is well worth such risks. The sapper's tactics focus on delivering large amounts of gunpowder to a target and using his skills to destroy it. They are aware of the surrounding battle only as it concerns their ability to reach their target and have enough time to set a charge and escape."}

This created a brief burst of technological innovation in clumsy armor suits and weird extended arms. The result was the sapper's shield. The sapper's shield is a specially reinforced tower shield with an alchemically treated glass window. This window has the same strength as steel and is of the variety used in &lt;a href=\"Gnomish%20submarine\"&gt;gnomish submersible&lt;/a&gt;s. The shield has two armored gauntlets on the front; from behind the shield, the sapper can set explosives without having to worry about premature detonation. A special set of extendable legs hold up the shield."}

Years later, Kel'Thuzad summoned him once more in the afterlife of &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxus\"&gt;Maldraxxus&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nSapphiron was one of the most ancient members of the blue dragonflight, and one of those entrusted with &lt;a href=\"Key%20to%20the%20Focusing%20Iris%20%28starter%29\"&gt;a key&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Focusing%20Iris\"&gt;Focusing Iris&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt; himself. Like many of the blue dragonflight, Sapphiron had immense magical power. The &lt;a href=\"blue%20wyrm\"&gt;wyrm&lt;/a&gt; lived with his brood of blue dragons near the entrance to &lt;a href=\"Azjol-Nerub\"&gt;Azjol-Nerub&lt;/a&gt; in the mountains of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, where he guarded a hoard of powerful artifacts he had collected over the centuries.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Anub%27arak\"&gt;Anub'arak&lt;/a&gt; were preparing to journey through Azjol-Nerub to reach &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt; and aid their master, the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, Anub'arak suggested that Sapphiron might hold artifacts that would protect them on their march. The dragon confronted the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; forces when they entered his lair, and found Arthas' honesty about their intention to kill him and steal his treasure to be \"refreshing\". The undead managed to kill the wyrm and his dragons, after which Arthas used some of his dwindling &lt;a href=\"necromancy\"&gt;necromantic&lt;/a&gt; power to raise Sapphiron as a &lt;a href=\"frost%20wyrm\"&gt;frost wyrm&lt;/a&gt; to serve the Scourge and help them destroy the forces blocking the passage to Azjol-Nerub. Sapphiron was called upon again to destroy the &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; guarding the gates to the Spider Kingdom, but was left behind outside when the Scourge ventured inside, since, as Arthas put it, \"the confines of the dark earth\" were no place for him.\nYears later, Sapphiron was stationed in the dread &lt;a href=\"necropolis\"&gt;necropolis&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt;, where he protected the &lt;a href=\"Frostwyrm%20Lair\"&gt;Frostwyrm Lair&lt;/a&gt; against intruders seeking to reach the chamber of the citadel's master &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;. With his magical powers having been amplified when he was resurrected by Arthas, Sapphiron used his frost magic to defend Kel'Thuzad at all costs. Even in undeath, he continued to hold onto his key to the Focusing Iris, which was retrieved by &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s when they defeated the frost wyrm on their way to Kel'Thuzad.\nAnother several years later in the afterlife of &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxus\"&gt;Maldraxxus&lt;/a&gt;, Kel'Thuzad and &lt;a href=\"Baroness%20Ninadar\"&gt;Baroness Ninadar&lt;/a&gt; betrayed &lt;a href=\"Margrave%20Sin%27dane\"&gt;Margrave Sin'dane&lt;/a&gt; to usurp control of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Rituals\"&gt;House of Rituals&lt;/a&gt;, an event which was witnessed by &lt;a href=\"Balmedar\"&gt;Balmedar&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Necrolord%20Covenant\"&gt;Necrolord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Walker\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt;s. Before departing to &lt;a href=\"Exoramas\"&gt;Exoramas&lt;/a&gt;, Kel'Thuzad summoned Sapphiron in the form of a fleshy undead dragon to deal with Balmedar and the heroes, but they managed to defeat the dragon.\nAs a victim of &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt;, Sapphiron's soul was sundered upon his death as a mortal, and he was resurrected with this piece not in its place. The missing fragment of the dragon's soul, crystallized as \"The Guardian of Naxxramas\", came into the &lt;a href=\"Jailer\"&gt;Jailer&lt;/a&gt;'s possession after Frostmourne's shattering.\nSpeculation.\nDespite not being a willing agent of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; and thus ally of Kel'Thuzad, Sapphiron doesn't hesitate to respond to his summons in Maldraxxus. While not directly stated, it is possible that Kel'Thuzad simply forcibly took control of Sapphiron at some point after they were both within the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;, or that Sapphiron was under the effect domination. Alternatively, the dragon may have developed a form of &lt;a href=\"Durnholde%20Syndrome\"&gt;Durnholde Syndrome&lt;/a&gt; during his time as a frost wyrm."}

Previously an agent of the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;Blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, Sapphiron was raised as a &lt;a href=\"frost%20wyrm\"&gt;frost wyrm&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; to serve as the guardian of &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad%27s%20Chamber\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad's Chamber&lt;/a&gt; deep within the black citadel. \nSapphiron is located within the &lt;a href=\"Frostwyrm%20Lair\"&gt;Frostwyrm Lair&lt;/a&gt;, which can only be accessed once players have defeated all 13 bosses within the four wings of the instance. Additionally, the encounter is designed to require sufficient frost &lt;a href=\"resistance\"&gt;resistance&lt;/a&gt; for all raid members, and should not be attempted otherwise. \nAbilities.\nSapphiron has 3,164,450 health and is immune to frost spells and taunt.\nAir phase.\nSapphiron takes to the air, knocking back all nearby players. This phase begins at 45 seconds and repeats every 67 seconds after Sapphiron lands, until he is reduced to 10% health and permanently grounded. Additionally, Chill and Frost Aura continue during this phase.\nStrategy.\nComposition.\nSapphiron is a single-tank encounter, any additional tanks in the raid should instead dps. At least 12 healers are recommended, as well as enough mages and druids to decurse Life Drain without delay. Paladins or shaman are required due to their frost resistance buffs and should be prioritized to groups with the lowest amount of unbuffed frost resistance.\nFrost Resistance.\nFrost Resistance is mandatory to survive Frost Aura. The recommended amount of frost resistance varies depending on the player's role and the raid's damage output, with a standard raid averaging ~150 frost resistance unbuffed. Healers should specifically avoid using too much frost resist gear as it will significantly reduce their bonus healing and mana regen and compromise their ability to keep the raid healed. &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Frost%20Protection%20Potion\"&gt;Greater Frost Protection Potion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Juju%20Chill\"&gt;Juju Chill&lt;/a&gt; are required consumables."}

As of patch &lt;a href=\"3.3.0\"&gt;3.3.0&lt;/a&gt;, players no longer need to clear the wings in order to fight Sapphiron. He guards the gateway to &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;'s inner sanctum.\n25-man abilities.\nPhase two.\nEvery 45 seconds Sapphiron will take to the air, everyone within his hitbox will be sent flying against the wall of Sapphiron's lair by his beating wings. \n10-man abilities.\nPhase two.\nEvery 45 seconds, Sapphiron will take to the air and everyone within his hitbox will be sent flying against the wall of Sapphiron's lair by his beating wings. \nNote that once Sapphiron goes below 10% health, he will not fly back up into the air. This is almost certainly to prevent any error with a corpse in the air that may be unlootable. However, he will life drain below 10% health, and if you have him at 10% health, its likely you'll kill him anyway.\n25-man strategy.\nThe first time you engage Sapphiron there will be a short entrance animation in which Sapphiron will come together from bones on the ground. In subsequent attempts he can be engaged without watching him form. This encounter is considerably easier with 300 Frost Resistance but by no means impossible without. You will want more healers to go the second route. You will need one tank.\nThe tank should engage Sapphiron and point him towards the door to Kel'Thuzad's chamber. Healers and DPS should spread out on one side of Sapphiron. Do not have people on both sides or they may be unable to reach the ice blocks in time during Frost Breath. Melee should stack up near Sapphiron's hind leg and be ready to move out should an ice storm drift towards them. Decursers and healers will need to be in a position to reach everyone in the raid. Missed curses not only may kill a player but will also heal Sapphiron a considerable amount. Be aware of the massive hitbox of Sapphiron's cleave. It is advisable to simply heal the tank through Chill should it be on him. Moving Sapphiron is very dangerous. Everyone else should take great care to avoid being hit by Chill as the slow effect may prevent you from escaping and Chill hits quite hard.\nAfter Sapphiron takes to the air, everyone (including the tank) should spread out around the first player to be Ice Bolted. It is important not to immediately stack on top of the Ice Block as the second Ice Bolt's AoE will then hit multiple players causing a lot of unnecessary damage. It is also quite possible a Chill will drift over the first block meaning the raid should run behind the second. As soon as Sapphiron casts his last (third) Ice Bolt the entire raid must get behind one of the Ice Blocks and ensure they are out of line of sight of Sapphiron for his deep breath. As soon as the ice blocks are shattered the tank must run and pick up and reposition Sapphiron as he will land immediately and phases one &amp; two repeat again until Sapphiron is dead. \nNOTE: As mentioned above, it is recommended to have at least 300 frost resist for the 25-man version of Sapphiron. Keep in mind that Sapphiron's frost aura is hitting for more damage and is hitting even more players, giving frost aura a huge boost to total damage done. A player's aura or totem only gives 130 frost resistance which equals roughly 23.5% frost damage reduction. This means, Sapphiron's frost aura will be hitting the raid for 30,604 damage every second. A player with 300 frost resist, which is easily obtainable at level 80 (All armor crafting professions make 3 bind on equip pieces of frost resist gear), reduces Sapphiron's frost aura damage by 54.2% which equals to 18,316 damage every second, making this fight \"considerably easier\" for the healers. It is also recommended that the tank should not use frost resist gear, unless he or she can do so while remaining at 540 defense.\nChill kiting.\nChill is possibly the most dangerous ability in the Sapphiron fight because it can easily wipe the raid in the event that one or both ice blocks are caught in it and it spawns with some deal of randomness. Chill Kiting can limit the damage caused by Chill, allowing healers to conserve their mana. \nUsing the tactics above, the ranged group will also be responsible for coordinating the Chill Kiting which can require some coordination between the tank, melee group, and ranged group. As Chill approaches the ranged group they should attempt to keep the Chill blizzard to their left shoulder while maintaining DPS and heals. They should start DPS from the back side of Sapphiron and slowly move towards the head as the Chill blizzard follows them. \nAs the ranged group approaches the head, the tank should slowly rotate Sapphiron a quarter of the way around, putting the ranged group back towards the back quarter of Sapphiron. \nWhen Sapphiron enters Phase 2, the ranged, melee and tank should converge and make their way around the room, counter clockwise (keeping their distance to avoid AoE from the Ice Bolt), until they are a sufficient distance from the Chill blizzard or until the first Raid member is Ice Blocked. At that point, they should wait for the second member to be Ice Blocked and run behind either one (whichever is the safest distance from the Chill blizzard). \nWhen Sapphiron lands, the Chill Kiting continues from the beginning and follows the same procedures until Sapphiron is downed.\nNote: Chill has a 10 second duration and may spawn at another random location in the raid, which could be on top of one of your ice blocks, but in most cases Chill Kiting will save all, if not a few seconds, of healing required due to Chill, which can mean a big difference in your end result.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

Before coming to Silithus, she was a consultant member at the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Explorers\"&gt;Hall of Explorers&lt;/a&gt;. She has fiery red hair.\nBiography.\nBefore the Storm.\nSapphronetta was previously married to &lt;a href=\"Grizzek%20Fizzwrench\"&gt;Grizzek Fizzwrench&lt;/a&gt; when she was young. They were lab partners that were stupid enough to fall in love with each other. After the first month, their relationship began to fall apart because everything one of them did seemed to irritate the other. After she divorced Grizzek, she joined the Explorer's League. She claimed that the robotic parrot &lt;a href=\"Feathers\"&gt;Feathers&lt;/a&gt; was hers, but in fact they made it together as a first (and last) anniversary gift to each other. Her friend &lt;a href=\"Kelsey%20Steelspark\"&gt;Kelsey Steelspark&lt;/a&gt; got to know Grizzek during the relationship and didn't like how he could get Saffy all wound up, but accepted them as a couple.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20Campaign\"&gt;Argus Campaign&lt;/a&gt;, Sapphronetta was sent by &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; on an expedition to Silithus led by &lt;a href=\"Gavvin%20Stoutarm\"&gt;Gavvin Stoutarm&lt;/a&gt;, alongside three &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; from Explorer's League and a small handful &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20Cordressa%20Briarbow\"&gt;Sentinel Cordressa Briarbow&lt;/a&gt;. While the &lt;a href=\"Archaeology\"&gt;archaeologists&lt;/a&gt; on the team to look for &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s, doomsday technology, and the \"usual sort of things\", Saffy\u2014a well-recognized geologist specializing in mineralogy\u2014was brought along specifically to study &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt;.\nShe befriended Cordressa the night they arrived in Silithus, talking about the moons, &lt;a href=\"Moon\"&gt;the Blue Child&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Moon\"&gt;the White Lady&lt;/a&gt;. After they ate dinner, two Sentinels, including Cordressa, left to scout out the Horde forces in the area, while the rest of the team went to sleep.\nIn the middle of the night, she awoke to the sound of &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; bellowing, the crack of rifles, and the clang of steel against steel. She saw two dead Sentinels and a third body she did not inspect for fear her panic would overcome her mind. She defended herself by grabbing the pistol she hid under her pillow and pointed at a shape blocking out the horizon stars. She shot her pistol twice, missing both times, and angered the goblin &lt;a href=\"Kezzig%20Klackwhistle\"&gt;Kezzig Klackwhistle&lt;/a&gt;. Kezzig's companion pointed out that the \"gnome lady\" fit a description given to all goblin forces by &lt;a href=\"Jastor%20Gallywix\"&gt;Trade Prince Gallywix&lt;/a&gt; and began grabbing her. Saffy fought back by biting Kezzig and was subsequently punched in the face and knocked out.\nWhen she awoke, she was on a &lt;a href=\"wyvern\"&gt;wyvern&lt;/a&gt; heading towards &lt;a href=\"Tanaris\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt;. She was reunited with her ex-husband Grizzek, whom she despised. She was against anything to do with him until Grizzek put a piece of Azerite into her palm and its effects opened her mind to the possibilities the two could do with it.\nAs the weeks went by, Saffy and Grizzek worked on making new Azerite inventions for Gallywix, such as armor and building material. As the two worked together, they began to rekindle their relationship. Eventually, they were notified that they were now ordered to create only weapons.\nThe couple was devastated by this news as they did not want to create things that caused harm to others. They created a plan where they would set up a bomb in their lab and secretly escape through a tunnel that opened up in a random part of Tanaris. They also programmed Feathers to fly to &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt; with a warning of what had happened and a plea for rescue, with the duo intending to offer their discoveries to the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; on the stipulation that they would only create things that could help, not harm. Prior to leaving, Grizzek proposed once more to Sapphronetta, offering her an Azerite ring, and she accepted. While traveling through the tunnel, they talked openly about their feelings for each other. When the duo exited the tunnel, however, they were captured and tied up back-to-back by &lt;a href=\"Druz\"&gt;Druz&lt;/a&gt;, Kezzig, and their goons, who had also taken their notes. Druz informed them that they knew of their plan ahead of time and had taken all their inventions, as well as disarmed Grizzek's bomb in the lab and shot Feathers out of the sky. Kezzig then placed a bomb between the gnome and goblin and left with Druz and the goons.\nThe newly engaged couple were able to get the bomb to fall to the ground between them, but when they attempted to flee, their short, tied up legs could only get them so far. As they continued to waddle their way to safety, Grizzek lamented that Gallywix would exploit their work to hurt others after all. Saffy, however, confessed that he wouldn't since she had already destroyed their notes, leaving Gallywix unable to recreate their experiments and with access to only a few prototypes and mixed potions. At that moment, Grizzek slipped on a stone and broke his ankle, forcing him and Saffy to crawl. However, the gnome then realized that she was still wearing the Azerite ring, which would possibly be enough to protect them from the explosion. As Grizzek was in the process of saying \"I love you\" to Sapphronetta, the bomb went off.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nThe two survived the explosion and made their way to &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;. During a Horde &lt;a href=\"Faction%20Assaults\"&gt;incursion&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"Tiragarde%20Sound\"&gt;Tiragarde Sound&lt;/a&gt; they could be found in hiding at &lt;a href=\"Greystone%20Keep\"&gt;Greystone Keep&lt;/a&gt;, and provided the &lt;a href=\"%3AGrizzek%27s%20Rocket%20Hop\"&gt;:Grizzek's Rocket Hop&lt;/a&gt; to aid an Alliance adventurer in fighting the Horde off.\nAn adventurer would later travel to Tanaris to investigate what happened to Sapphronetta and Grizzek. After repairing &lt;a href=\"Feathers\"&gt;Feathers&lt;/a&gt; and following him, the adventurer found Saffy and Grizzek just north of &lt;a href=\"Thistleshrub%20Valley\"&gt;Thistleshrub Valley&lt;/a&gt;. Knowing that if the adventurer found them that meant others could, Saffy and Grizzek promised to give the hero Feathers in exchange for not telling anyone they were still alive. The only exception she made was for Kelsey Steelspark, who was the only person Saffy felt safe about knowing. With that, the pair drove off on Grizzek's bike.\nLater, the adventurer enlists Sapphronetta's aid in the mission to &lt;a href=\"Mechagon%20Island\"&gt;Mechagon&lt;/a&gt;.

Their ultimate goal was to finally summon the dark titan himself, &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, to Azeroth.\nA massive army was sent by the forces of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; to combat the Burning Legion, including but not limited to the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for the Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt; culminated in the Legion overrunning Azeroth's defenders and forcing them to withdraw. Many of the greatest heroes in Azeroth, such as &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, fell in battle before the Legion or were mortally wounded. Some escaped, others went missing or were captured, but many more died upon the Broken Shore.\nA paladin &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;hero&lt;/a&gt; would return to the Broken Shore sometime after the disastrous battle to try and save &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt;, who was held captive by the Legion and had lost the &lt;a href=\"Ashbringer\"&gt;Ashbringer&lt;/a&gt;. The Ashbringer was reclaimed and used to battle &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt;, who escaped before he could be defeated. On his deathbed, Tirion proclaimed the hero as the new wielder of the Ashbringer, before passing away.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Order of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; also sent their troops here, as the Broken Shore was littered with debris from battle, to gather plenty of &lt;a href=\"Lumenstone\"&gt;Lumenstone&lt;/a&gt; despite the demons still patrolling the area. They also sent troops to help an order of &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s from the &lt;a href=\"Conclave\"&gt;Conclave&lt;/a&gt; who have been spotted combing the landing site of the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, searching for survivors amidst dangerous &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s, among them &lt;a href=\"Temptress%20Salacia\"&gt;Temptress Salacia&lt;/a&gt; engaged in a battle with the priests and taken down by the paladins who joined the fray.\nA &lt;a href=\"demon%20hunter\"&gt;demon hunter&lt;/a&gt; hero ventured to the Broken Shore to reclaim the &lt;a href=\"Aldrachi%20Warblades\"&gt;Aldrachi Warblades&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Caria%20Felsoul\"&gt;Caria Felsoul&lt;/a&gt;, a traitor to the &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt;.\nA &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt; hero fought alongside many &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; on the Broken Shore but was overwhelmed. They were saved from the brink of death by a &lt;a href=\"val%27kyr\"&gt;val'kyr&lt;/a&gt; sent by Keeper &lt;a href=\"Odyn\"&gt;Odyn&lt;/a&gt; and brought to the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Halls of Valor&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Vereesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Vereesa Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt; hero, seeking Vereesa's missing sister &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria&lt;/a&gt;, used the Broken Shore as a launch point onto the Legion world of &lt;a href=\"Niskara\"&gt;Niskara&lt;/a&gt; where Alleria was rumored to be held.\n&lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; launched a separate expedition to Niskara in order to locate &lt;a href=\"Gorelix%20the%20Fleshripper\"&gt;Gorelix the Fleshripper&lt;/a&gt; in order to recover another artifact that was held in his hands.\nLegionfall.\nThe demonic forces of the Burning Legion built massive structures on the Broken Shore as a base of operations for their assault on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. It\u2019s here that the Horde and the Alliance experienced a series of tragedies at the hands of the Legion. Where factions failed, order halls regrouped, acquired new weapons of power, and recruited new allies, to make a triumphant return.\nAll order halls gathered together to form the &lt;a href=\"Armies%20of%20Legionfall\"&gt;Armies of Legionfall&lt;/a&gt;. The Legionfall base, serving as the initial foothold on the island, is from where they would work their way through the Legion\u2019s defenses and eventually reach the stronghold. To do this, &lt;a href=\"Class%20Order\"&gt;class orders&lt;/a&gt; needed to work together to build up their forces by fortifying ancient elven buildings and upgrading them into Nether Disruptors, Command Centers, and Mage Towers.\nThe destruction of &lt;a href=\"Mephistroth\"&gt;Mephistroth&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Legion%20ship\"&gt;Legion ship&lt;/a&gt; and its resulting crash into the Broken Shore heavily changes the center of the island's geography, destroying the fel lava pit and causing rubble from the ship to scatter across the area.\nScenario.\nThe Broken Shore scenario was available since the \"\" launch event which lasted a few weeks. Those who had already accomplished it didn't do it again after \"Legion\" was launched.\nOnce players accept the relevant part of &lt;a href=\"The%20Battle%20for%20Broken%20Shore%20%28quest%29\"&gt;The Battle for Broken Shore (quest)&lt;/a&gt;, they are teleported into a &lt;a href=\"scenario\"&gt;scenario&lt;/a&gt; version of the Broken Shore together with other players.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

Independent from the &lt;a href=\"Covenant\"&gt;Covenant&lt;/a&gt;s and the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt;, they possess an innate affinity for &lt;a href=\"anima\"&gt;anima&lt;/a&gt; and act as &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Merchant\"&gt;traders&lt;/a&gt; that can move freely around the realms. They are savvy, adaptable, and keep their true intentions to themselves. In the wake of the current anima drought, the Brokers have taken the chance to capitalize on new opportunities for profit and perhaps more. Brokers value success, and are not afraid to display the results of their endeavors. Brokers do not only sell, they also collect and put their collections on display. Their methods of storage are bigger on the inside. They navigate through the &lt;a href=\"In-Between\"&gt;In-Between&lt;/a&gt;.\nSince embarking upon their expeditions to chart the afterlives of the realms of Death, the Brokers dreamed of setting foot in the Eternal City of &lt;a href=\"Oribos\"&gt;Oribos&lt;/a&gt;, which they finally accomplished due to a whim of a navigator belonging to the &lt;a href=\"Cartel%20Au\"&gt;Cartel Au&lt;/a&gt;. Following their discovery of the city, the Brokers were allowed to establish themselves within. After the arrival of mortal &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to Oribos, the brokers decide to provide a variety of exotic merchandise and &lt;a href=\"profession\"&gt;profession&lt;/a&gt; knowledge.\nBrokers value the accumulation of information and knowledge, and the application of such knowledge has the side effect of allowing them to accumulate much influence and wealth. The lure of information is appealing enough to brokers for them to even go to places as dangerous as the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt;.\nThough &lt;a href=\"Ve%27nari\"&gt;Ve'nari&lt;/a&gt; is the only Broker operating in the Maw, as she escapes assassins of &lt;a href=\"Cartel%20Ve\"&gt;Cartel Ve&lt;/a&gt; who are trapped with her, the Brokers in Oribos of &lt;a href=\"Cartel%20Ba\"&gt;Cartel Ba&lt;/a&gt; somehow managed to procure items from the Maw for &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;. Similarly, &lt;a href=\"Cartel%20Ku\"&gt;Cartel Ku&lt;/a&gt; is seen selling wares to the forces of &lt;a href=\"Vyraz\"&gt;Vyraz&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20the%20Chosen\"&gt;House of the Chosen&lt;/a&gt;. Cartel Ba and Cartel Ta are particularly interested in a variety of artifacts from across the Shadowlands, as well as the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Vault\"&gt;Great Vault&lt;/a&gt;, and maintain the portal network for all the Brokers together. &lt;a href=\"Cartel%20Ta\"&gt;Cartel Ta&lt;/a&gt; also runs the &lt;a href=\"Transfer%20Station%20Ta\"&gt;Transfer Station Ta&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Bastion\"&gt;Bastion&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Market\"&gt;Night Market&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Revendreth\"&gt;Revendreth&lt;/a&gt;, provide decorations for the &lt;a href=\"Ember%20Court\"&gt;Ember Court&lt;/a&gt;, and have collected the writings of the &lt;a href=\"Primus\"&gt;Primus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Necrolord%20Covenant\"&gt;Margraves&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Sepulcher%20of%20Knowledge\"&gt;Sepulcher of Knowledge&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Cartel%20Au\"&gt;Cartel Au&lt;/a&gt; maintains all the profession trainers in &lt;a href=\"Oribos\"&gt;Oribos&lt;/a&gt;, but also provides the challenges from other planes for the &lt;a href=\"Theater%20of%20Pain\"&gt;Theater of Pain&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Challenger%27s%20Promenade\"&gt;Challenger's Promenade&lt;/a&gt;, in collaboration with &lt;a href=\"Cartel%20So\"&gt;Cartel So&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cartel%20Zo\"&gt;Cartel Zo&lt;/a&gt;. Cartel Zo is primarily interested in &lt;a href=\"PVP\"&gt;warfare&lt;/a&gt; among the mortals. Cartel Xy has only ever been hostile, but &lt;a href=\"Dealer%20Xy%27exa\"&gt;Dealer Xy'exa&lt;/a&gt; (the only Broker seen in &lt;a href=\"Ardenweald\"&gt;Ardenweald&lt;/a&gt;) is hostile due to us needing &lt;a href=\"Bwonsamdi\"&gt;Bwonsamdi&lt;/a&gt;'s mojo back, and &lt;a href=\"Artificer%20Xy%27mox\"&gt;Artificer Xy'mox&lt;/a&gt; is hostile due to &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Renathal\"&gt;Prince Renathal&lt;/a&gt; asking us to stop them from stealing the artifacts of &lt;a href=\"Denathrius\"&gt;Denathrius&lt;/a&gt;, who had been a prior business partner of theirs. Though no broker is seen in Ardenweald other than Dealer Xy'exa and &lt;a href=\"Zo%27sorg\"&gt;Zo'sorg&lt;/a&gt; (in the &lt;a href=\"Furrowed%20Glen\"&gt;Furrowed Glen&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Finder%20Ta%27sul\"&gt;Finder Ta'sul&lt;/a&gt; expresses experience with the &lt;a href=\"gorm\"&gt;gorm&lt;/a&gt;, identifying as a gorm-breeder (but Ardenweald is too dangerous for them at this time) and &lt;a href=\"Au%27larrynar\"&gt;Au'larrynar&lt;/a&gt; has been making deals with the &lt;a href=\"night%20fae\"&gt;night fae&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Cartel%20Al\"&gt;Cartel Al&lt;/a&gt; has been researching the secrets of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Ones\"&gt;First Ones&lt;/a&gt;, particularly the location of the &lt;a href=\"Sepulcher%20%28Shadowlands%29\"&gt;Sepulcher&lt;/a&gt;, with one of their expedition teams led by &lt;a href=\"Al%27firim\"&gt;Al'firim&lt;/a&gt; abandoning the cartel after being labeled heretics. The former members of Cartel Al were able to arrive to &lt;a href=\"Zereth%20Mortis\"&gt;Zereth Mortis&lt;/a&gt; long ago and have named themselves the &lt;a href=\"Enlightened\"&gt;Enlightened&lt;/a&gt; having relinquished their material ways to instead focus on the pursuit of knowledge and renounced their cartel prefixes, with Al'firim from then on being known simply as \"Firim\".\nBroker society is divided into &lt;a href=\"cartel\"&gt;cartel&lt;/a&gt;s. Each Broker's name has the name of their cartel attached as a prefix; for example, &lt;a href=\"Opulence%20Ba%27hare\"&gt;Opulence Ba'hare&lt;/a&gt; is of &lt;a href=\"Cartel%20Ba\"&gt;Cartel Ba&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ta%27lan%20the%20Antiquary\"&gt;Ta'lan the Antiquary&lt;/a&gt; is of &lt;a href=\"Cartel%20Ta\"&gt;Cartel Ta&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Tazavesh%2C%20the%20Veiled%20Market\"&gt;Tazavesh, the Veiled Market&lt;/a&gt; is a giant floating city of the Brokers in the In-Between, and the In-Between hosts various broker cities, most of which are hidden and change location on a whim."}

Unlike others, whose antlers grew in response to their growing power, Broll was born with them. Malfurion personally respects Broll as an equal.\nBiography.\nTragic past.\nBroll Bearmantle was born with antlers, an extremely rare gift of nature and a sign that one day he would do great deeds. For years people watched as his antlers grew and waited for him to manifest greatness. Over the long centuries he developed into a fine druid \u2014 very powerful, an amazing shapeshifter with many forms \u2014 but beyond that he seemed nothing special. In time he was further gifted with an idol crafted by the immortal druid &lt;a href=\"Remulos\"&gt;Remulos&lt;/a&gt;, son of the demigod &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;. The idol was connected to a &lt;a href=\"green%20dragon\"&gt;green dragon&lt;/a&gt;, and through the dragon Broll was linked to the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;. The idol, however, could not help Broll in further developing his powers. He felt he had not fulfilled his promise. His \"failure\" began to eat at him.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; along with their &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; slaves, invaded Kalimdor during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, Broll found himself at &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; battling undead and demons. His daughter &lt;a href=\"Anessa\"&gt;Anessa&lt;/a&gt; fought beside him. Broll's command was cut off from the main resistance force. Drawn by his hidden core of druidic power, a group of powerful demons attacked. In his desperation, Broll, for the first time called to the deep earth to protect those who fought beside him. He stood his ground giving the others time to pull back toward the main army as the trees uprooted themselves and attacked undead and demons alike. He had been fighting all-out for hours. He was tiring and in the end the pit lord &lt;a href=\"Azgalor\"&gt;Azgalor&lt;/a&gt; overwhelmed him. Broll dropped the draconic &lt;a href=\"Idol%20of%20Remulos\"&gt;Idol of Remulos&lt;/a&gt; as he fell. Azgalor struck the idol with his two-bladed &lt;a href=\"sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spite\"&gt;Spite&lt;/a&gt;, infusing it with fel energy. The explosion of fel energy from the corrupted statue killed Anessa, who was trying to save her father. After the battle, Broll felt it was his fault that his daughter had died; his grief and fury caused the spirits of the wild to abandon him: the &lt;a href=\"stag\"&gt;stag&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"panther\"&gt;panther&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"seal\"&gt;seal&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"crow\"&gt;crow&lt;/a&gt;. But one spirit remained with him, the spirit of the &lt;a href=\"bear\"&gt;bear&lt;/a&gt;, the embodiment of his soul, which was despoiled by &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel energy&lt;/a&gt; and feeding Broll's rage. Despite this great personal loss, Broll saved many other lives that day and contributed greatly to the Alliance's victory.\nGladiator.\nHis grief eating away at him, Broll left night elf society and eventually allowed himself to be bought by and his ex-slave now-partner . Broll became a gladiator alongside Bloodeye and a young blood elf named . Bloodeye, however, was soon after assassinated and Rehgar found himself without a leader for his team before the &lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Ring\"&gt;Crimson Ring&lt;/a&gt; tournament. The answer to his problems came in the form of an incredibly skilled amnesiac human warrior later nicknamed , who was furthermore later on revealed to be none other than &lt;a href=\"King\"&gt;King&lt;/a&gt; . Broll, Valeera, and the amnesiac human trained in the ways of the gladiator in the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Ring of Valor&lt;/a&gt; and learned to look out for one another since rival gladiators would test their mettle against the novice team in fights to the death while their trainers would gamble on the outcomes. After working together as gladiators to win the Crimson Ring tournament, Broll aided and accompanied Lo'Gosh in his escape from servitude.\nThe Idol of Remulos.\nWith Lo'Gosh's strategies and Broll's power over nature, the two later aided the &lt;a href=\"Silverwing%20Sentinels\"&gt;Silverwing Sentinels&lt;/a&gt; in defending &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Gulch\"&gt;Warsong Gulch&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Outriders\"&gt;Warsong Outriders&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, Broll's rage had made his powers dangerous and chaotic; almost causing a natural disaster had Lo'Gosh not knocked him out with a stick. After the battle, Broll discovered that the corrupted &lt;a href=\"Idol%20of%20Remulos\"&gt;Idol of Remulos&lt;/a&gt; had been retrieved by the &lt;a href=\"Thistlefur%20tribe\"&gt;Thistlefur&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt;s, corrupting them. For this matter, Broll and flew to &lt;a href=\"Thistlefur%20Hold\"&gt;Thistlefur Hold&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt; to cleanse the corrupted idol of its fel energies. They eventually succeeded in cleansing the idol, but only after battling the green dragon that was linked to the idol and a horde of corrupted furbolgs. In cleansing the idol, Broll was able to once again commune with the other spirits of the wild and soothe his rage.\nBroll and Lo'Gosh brought the idol to , who wanted to make sure that it truly had been cleansed. After studying the idol, he decided that it would be best if Broll left the idol with him in &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;.\nFurther adventures.\nBroll Bearmantle, along with Valeera Sanguinar, continued to accompany the warrior king until they assisted him in bringing the broodmother &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Onyxia&lt;/a&gt; to justice, rescuing Anduin and returned Varian to his rightful throne; thus becoming a further trusted friend in the process. He also grows attached to Valeera, who's independent and sometimes reckless nature remind him of his deceased daughter. The two form a close, almost father-daughter like bond over the course of their journey. Broll however, is deeply concerned for Valeera and her addiction to magic. After the death of Onyxia, Varian offered both Broll and Valeera a permanent place in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, in which they could act as Varian's bodyguards and advisers.\nBroll was unable to attend the Theramore peace summit between King Varian and because he was being summoned by for some endeavor via visions in his dreams. He later joins the &lt;a href=\"New%20Council%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;New Council of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt; during 's battle with when he saved them from a &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer%20cult\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer cult&lt;/a&gt; attack.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nIn the pre-launch World Event at the Stormwind docks, Broll appeared to discuss the threat of the Scourge with and Varian.\n\"His appearance in Stormwind during the Scourge attack would later be contradicted by the events of the comic, where he was summoned by &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt; for some endeavor in &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;.\nAdditionally, he started the quest &lt;a href=\"The%20Battle%20For%20The%20Undercity%20%28Alliance%29\"&gt;The Battle For The Undercity&lt;/a&gt; and accompanied Varian to the demon-filled settlement.\nStormrage.\nAfter the death of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt; became increasingly ill. Broll was was one of many members of the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; (and the only one who was not an &lt;a href=\"archdruid\"&gt;archdruid&lt;/a&gt;) who were called upon by their leader, , to help heal the decaying &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;. The Cenarion Circle were to lend their power to the World Tree and use the &lt;a href=\"Idol%20of%20Remulos\"&gt;Idol of Remulos&lt;/a&gt;' power to make their efforts more potent. While fused with &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt; and channeling his druidic powers to help heal the tree, Broll began receiving visions of Teldrassil's corruption, which then caused him to faint and disrupt the collaborative operation. Though Broll recovered, these visions would again reoccur, this time prophesying the emergence of demonic like shadowy creatures and a familiar figure emanating the green light of the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;. He later recognized the green figure to be the Idol of Remulos. Broll couldn't help but feel that Azeroth, or something similar, was trying to warn him of an impending danger.\nThe warnings were getting worse for Broll. It has now infected his dreams, as Broll started receiving nightmares of his deceased daughter . Broll was later quietly informed by a &lt;a href=\"Sisterhood%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Sister of Elune&lt;/a&gt; that he had been summoned to a secret meeting by &lt;a href=\"High%20Priest\"&gt;High Priest&lt;/a&gt;ess . Only knew of this secret meeting and kept it secret from the other druids.\nAs a trusted friend of , Broll was asked by his \"&lt;a href=\"shan%27do\"&gt;shan'do&lt;/a&gt;'s\" beloved to help her free whatever was imprisoning Malfurion and return his dreamform to his body. Tyrande confided in Broll that had revealed to her that Malfurion was dying. had forbidden entrance into the Emerald Dream as the increasing danger of the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; plagued the dream realm. Instead, felt that the &lt;a href=\"archdruid\"&gt;archdruid&lt;/a&gt;s should be concentrating their efforts in healing the ailing Teldrassil, which he felt that only with its aid could they find Malfurion. Tyrande however, realized that Malfurion would die before any progress from the second &lt;a href=\"World%20Tree\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt; could be made. Tyrande confided in Broll because Malfurion trusted him, was a hero of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, and whose outside exploits would make him less prone to simply agree with Fandral's unwavering plans. Unknown to Broll, Tyrande had left her &lt;a href=\"moonglaive\"&gt;moonglaive&lt;/a&gt; out in full view as a subconscious reminder of his gladiator days. Stirred by his personal loyalty for Malfurion and by his recent nightmares and visions that implied some form of evil was at work, he agreed to aid Tyrande.\nTyrande had decided to enter the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; itself through the portal at &lt;a href=\"Bough%20Shadow\"&gt;Bough Shadow&lt;/a&gt;, but in order to do so Broll determined that they would need the &lt;a href=\"Idol%20of%20Remulos\"&gt;Idol of Remulos&lt;/a&gt;. Though Broll knew that the idol was integral to Fandral's plan to heal the World Tree, he nonetheless stole the artifact from Fandral's private sanctum.\nBroll and Tyrande eventually started their journey. They met in &lt;a href=\"Auberdine\"&gt;Auberdine&lt;/a&gt;, where its inhabitants were all asleep and having nightmares. There they found a human male who rescued them by using his special power to teleport in and out of the Emerald Dream. The trio shifted into an unknown place where they spotted a black dragon. They followed him into a cave and it was revealed that the dragon was in fact a green dragon disguised as a black dragon and 's consort, . It is also revealed that Eranikus is the dragon tied with the Idol of Remulos. The dragon revealed to the night elves the truth about their human companion, , his power and his family's history. Shortly afterward, Lucan separated from the group and was encountered by an orc female, , who was following them. She attacked Lucan and he was forced to use his power to teleport him and his attacker into the Emerald Dream but did not return back. Broll discovered what has happened and convinced Eranikus to transport the night elves to Bough Shadow so that they may follow in pursuit. There they found the Ancient, . Though the Ancient thought that Eranikus was still corrupted, Tyrande and Broll convinced him otherwise and allowed them to enter the Emerald Dream. Afterward, attacked them, Eranikus vanished, and though Gnarl tried to help the night elves, he was sucked into the Emerald Nightmare. When Eranikus reappeared, and attacked the green dragon in order to corrupt him. Suddenly, appeared and rescued him, forcing the two corrupted dragons to retreat. The Dragon Queen then convinced Eranikus to help them help Ysera in her fight against the Nightmare. The elves and the dragon then proceeded to enter the Nightmare infested Emerald Dream.\nThere the trio found and learned from Lucan about and her plan to kill Malfurion. Tyrande ran off to prevent that from happening and Broll followed after her, but lost her. As he was running, he received another a vision of being taken by roots. The vision was interrupted when Broll was found by the ancient who was ordered to follow him. Broll was taken to , who was leading a small group of nature's defenders. Broll left the group to continue his search for Tyrande but noticed green dragons led by Ysera flying. Ysera and her dragons offered to escort Broll on his mission to save Malfurion. One of them served as his flying mount and together they flew to the place where Malfurion was trapped. There they found Thura and Tyrande fighting each other. When Broll and Lucan appeared at the scene, Thura, was already able to cut the tree that was imprisoning Malfurion. At that moment, Malfurion was released. In the wake of Malfurion's liberation, something unexpected happened. Eranikus appeared and was shown to be trapped with in the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;. Ysera saw it and headed off to rescue her consort. As she did, the Nightmare caught her. The trapped Eranikus turned out to be in fact Lethon, who was using Eranikus' appearance to lure Ysera into a trap. Malfurion understood that the Nightmare always wanted Ysera, and after her capture, the Nightmare would be able to corrupt not only the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; but also all of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; in more powerful and effective ways. Later on Tyrande, Broll, Lucan, Thura, and Malfurion flew on a green dragon to escape the Emerald Dream. In that moment, Malfurion's dreamform connected with his body, awakening him in the &lt;a href=\"Moonglade\"&gt;Moonglade&lt;/a&gt;. The remaining four were attacked by and thus needed to be tossed into a portal leading to Azeroth. As they entered, they were attacked by a corrupted Gnarl, and all except Lucan fell into the nightmare. Lucan used his power and teleported them once more into the Emerald Nightmare next to Eranikus. The dragon, however, was saddened by Ysera's sacrifice, and thus tried to threaten the others in order to scare them away from him.\nThe threat worked and the four were teleported to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;. They proceeded to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt; where they encountered King . Varian was at first wary of Thura, but Broll vouched that she was an ally. Broll also asked Varian where Valeera is, but she was already gone and nobody knew where she went. Despite Varian's suspicions, Varian instructed to accompany the group into the &lt;a href=\"Trade%20District\"&gt;Trade District&lt;/a&gt;, where a Darnassian ambassador lived. As the group continued through the nightmare-enveloped city, Broll wondered why the ambassador lived in that place. Tyrande responded that it is because of policy and that it served to keep a close eye on her allies for the good of all. When they got to the inn, Lucan, Thura and the major remained guarding the door, while Broll and Tyrande went to the ambassador's room. There, they found what they were looking for - a hearthstone connected to &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;. However, Tyrande was attacked by the ambassador who was suffering from nightmares. Tyrande convinced Broll to take and use the hearthstone. He did so and teleported to Darnassus. There he was surrounded by his fellow druids, who believed that Broll was a traitor; though he tried to explain that the traitor is in fact Fandral. The druids took him to Fandral in the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Enclave\"&gt;Cenarion Enclave&lt;/a&gt;, where he was found battling Malfurion Stormrage, who came here in order to released Hamuul, Naralex, and Shandris and put an end to Fandral's mad schemes. Hamuul and Shandris were released and vouched for Broll by saying that Fandral is indeed the traitor. However, a crazed Fandral proclaimed that Malfurion, Hamuul, Broll, Naralex, and even Remulos are the true traitors. Fandral then cast a spell on the druids and Broll in order to kill them. Malfurion attacked a shadow, which Fandral thought to be his son Valstann, and the shock of seeing his fake son killed knocked Fandral to the ground. In that moment, Broll's druidic might enveloped him as he drew energy from Azeroth. His eyes were almost as gold Malfurion's. Stormrage went to find the source of Teldrassil's corruption and Broll with Hamuul stayed to heal the other druids. Malfurion returned and told the druids to heal the tree. Broll was among the first to agree. Thus, all the druids lent their power and redeemed Teldrassil. Then Broll, Hamuul, Shandris, and others watched as Malfurion found a secret portal to the Emerald Dream. Malfurion then ordered Broll and Hamuul to watch over the druids and him, while he communicated with Azeroth's survivors and formed an army. When Malfurion returned to his body, he met with Remulos, who told him that the Nightmare has both Tyrande and Broxigar's axe. Malfurion then ordered Broll to coordinate the &lt;a href=\"dreamform%20army\"&gt;dreamform army&lt;/a&gt;, but later on, he was tasked by Malfurion to accompany Thura on her mission to recover her uncle's axe and to chop down the Nightmare Lord's shadow tree in the Emerald Dream; thus his responsibilities were taken over by Hamuul.\nBroll helped Thura to get to her axe and to Xavius' shadowy tree and defeated him. After the trying events of the Emerald Nightmare, Broll was asked to be Malfurion's witness and was honored to be a part of Malfurion and Tyrande's wedding ceremony.\nThough Broll had long thought he was unworthy of the antlers that marked his greatness in druidism, Malfurion had assured him that he believed in him and respected him as an equal. His great druidic abilities finally manifested itself after Fandral and his corrupted Teldrassil was defeated. By showing great skill in channeling the energies of Azeroth, he was able to use its power to revive the comatose druids who were deprived of their energy due to Fandral Staghelm's treachery. After performing this feat, Broll's eyes, which were silver at birth, while not as resplendent as Malfurion's, now also gleamed gold. Broll had finally overcome the last self-imposed barrier to truly become a great druid, his deep uncertainty replaced with confidence that he was now the druid he was always meant to be. With Malfurion and Ysera rescued from the Emerald Nightmare, Broll fulfilled his great purpose for which he'd been destined since birth.\nThe Cataclysm era.\nAfter the Shattering, he has taken Malfurion's place of organizing the druid scouts.\nDuring the Alliance meeting in &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;, Broll was not in the city as he was sent on a mission by Malfurion. Varian regretted his absence.\nBroll later shows up, for Alliance adventurers, as one of many well-known characters &lt;a href=\"The%20Protectors%20of%20Hyjal\"&gt;aiding in the fight&lt;/a&gt; against Ragnaros' forces.\nJaina Proudmoore: Tides of War.\nFollowing the destruction of &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore Isle&lt;/a&gt;, the Horde put up a blockade along the entire coast of Kalimdor, preventing the Alliance navy from reaching the continent. Broll traveled from Teldrassil to Stormwind via magic and spoke to Varian while they watched a new fleet being built at &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Harbor\"&gt;Stormwind Harbor&lt;/a&gt;. Broll assured Varian that although the night elves' ships at Teldrassil could not pass the blockade, Malfurion and Tyrande were doing their best to get the rest of the kaldorei's ships around the world to help Stormwind attack &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;. He further assured &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; that Garrosh and the Horde would not win despite their using tactics such as bombing Theramore, so long as he had breath in his body.\nBroll was later among the other Alliance representatives in Stormwind Keep who came up with the plan of attack, but reminded Varian that his people suffered from the blockade when his friend wanted to attack &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; instead of Feralas or Darkshore.\nLegion.\nWith the reappearance of the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;, Broll was sent by to retrieve the &lt;a href=\"Idol%20of%20the%20Wild\"&gt;Idol of the Wild&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Malorne%27s%20Refuge\"&gt;Malorne's Refuge&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Val%27sharah\"&gt;Val'sharah&lt;/a&gt;. However, upon arrival, he found the refuge under attack by &lt;a href=\"satyr\"&gt;satyr&lt;/a&gt;s and the idol stolen. Broll, the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Archdruid of the Dreamgrove&lt;/a&gt;, and , leader of the &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Antler\"&gt;Druids of the Antler&lt;/a&gt;, worked together to retrieve the idol and bring it back to the &lt;a href=\"Dreamgrove\"&gt;Dreamgrove&lt;/a&gt; so that the druids could commune with .\nHe was later part of the druids that communed with &lt;a href=\"Malorne\"&gt;Malorne&lt;/a&gt; beneath Nordrassil. Afterward, he was among the druids that entered and fought in &lt;a href=\"Malorne%27s%20Nightmare\"&gt;Malorne's Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nBroll was part of the dual Cenarion Circle and &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt; forces aiding &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; to heal &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt; from the wound inflicted by &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, accompanied by &lt;a href=\"Hamuul%20Runetotem\"&gt;Hamuul Runetotem&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuotes.\nScourge Invasion.\nI haven't seen such a buildup of forces since the Third War! Varian is dead set on addressing the Scourge threat directly. That's just like him...\nAre you heading to Northrend? I have never been there, but I hear it is both a beautiful and treacherous land. Sadly, urgent matters at home require my attention, so I will not be able to join Highlord Fordragon and his army on their journey.\nLegion.\nGossip.\nThe Nightmare has no place here, and we must do everything we can to protect Malorne. Without him, the very balance of nature is vulnerable.\nI fear there is nothing more important than saving him... even if it means giving our own lives.\nRelatives.\nHe may be related to ."}

Bronjahm is the keeper of the souls in the Forge; players must kill him to power down the forges and face the &lt;a href=\"Devourer%20of%20Souls\"&gt;Devourer of Souls&lt;/a&gt;.\nHis death is the objective of &lt;a href=\"Echoes%20of%20Tortured%20Souls\"&gt;Echoes of Tortured Souls&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Death%20Rising\"&gt;Scourge resurgence&lt;/a&gt;, Bronjahm was one of the undead forces reanimated by &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"kyrian\"&gt;kyrian&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Sindragosa%27s%20Fall\"&gt;Sindragosa's Fall&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s of both the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; attacked him once again.\nBosstiary.\n\"Also known as the Godfather of Souls, Bronjahm serves Arthas as the foreman of his mighty &lt;a href=\"soul%20grinder\"&gt;soul grinder&lt;/a&gt; engines. Bronjahm patrols the Forge of Souls to ensure that no interruptions befall the engines' operation.\"\nAdventure Guide.\n\"Bronjahm has served the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Cult of the Damned&lt;/a&gt; from the early days. &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; himself taught Bronjahm the value of souls and how to grind them down to fuel the engines of the Scourge. He can corrupt the souls of his foes and tear them out piece by piece, making him the ideal guardian for the Lich King's Forge of Souls.\"\nStrategy.\nBronjahm casts Shadow Bolts at the party and also casts Corrupted Soul, a &lt;a href=\"Drain%20Soul\"&gt;Drain Soul&lt;/a&gt;-like spell that creates a &lt;a href=\"Corrupted%20Soul%20Fragment\"&gt;Corrupted Soul Fragment&lt;/a&gt; that heals Bronjahm as long as he is within range of it. He can be kited around the room to keep his distance from the fragment while the DPS destroys it. If a player begins getting Corrupted Soul cast on them, it is recommended that he or she run to the side of the platform opposite of the boss in order to maximize the distance the orb will have to travel. Ranged attackers should merely remain on the opposite side of the platform throughout this fight. The &lt;a href=\"Corrupted%20Soul%20Fragment\"&gt;Corrupted Soul Fragment&lt;/a&gt; can be affected by crowd control techniques like snares and roots.\nAt about 30%, Bronjahm teleports to the center of the room (where he will remain until defeated) and casts Soulstorm, a swirling magic AoE effect around the edge of the room. All party members are advised to stand in the middle when he teleports to avoid being caught in the Soulstorm. Hunters have to be especially careful as the five yard min range is in a very small ring in the eye itself. He will also fear members of the party into the Soulstorm, which will cause them to take excessive damage and slow their movement speed; healers should keep an eye on feared targets (in the event there is no shaman with a Tremor Totem) to make sure they live through the Soulstorm long enough to make their way back into the center. Switching one trinket before starting this fight with a &lt;a href=\"Medallion%20of%20the%20Alliance\"&gt;Medallion of the Alliance&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Medallion%20of%20the%20Horde\"&gt;Medallion of the Horde&lt;/a&gt; to instantly remove Fear if it is cast on you is a good way to minimize damage taken from the Soulstorm."}

Like other &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; schools, enchanting can be attained through several magical disciplines.\nThey acts as trainers and vendors. Several became &lt;a href=\"arcane%20reforger\"&gt;arcane reforger&lt;/a&gt;s.\nIn \"World of Warcraft\", an enchanter is a character who has learned the &lt;a href=\"enchanting\"&gt;enchanting&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"profession\"&gt;profession&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nEnchanters are those who &lt;a href=\"enchant\"&gt;enchant&lt;/a&gt; normal items to give the items magical abilities or enhance already magical items. They also &lt;a href=\"disenchant\"&gt;destroy&lt;/a&gt; magical items in order to get materials to enchant other items. \nThe creation of a magic item is a difficult and time-consuming procedure that is mentally and physically draining. The craftperson must put a little of himself into every magically empowered item he produces, leaving him ever so slightly diminished from his efforts.\nSome have sought an alternative to this method: the path of the enchanter. Enchanters learn secret ways to seize the arcane or divine power imbued within every magic item, drawing it into themselves as the item is destroyed. They then redirect this raw energy into an existing item through the use of mystical formulas only they can hope to understand. The refocused magic provides the object with new abilities, above and beyond what it may already possess.\nEnchanters are often tradespeople, working either alone or alongside those who craft standard magic items. The enchanter's skills overlap with those of the craftspeople, so that both working together can produce a thriving business. As enchantments enhance existing magic items, members of this prestige class are frequently in high demand among adventurers looking to squeeze a little bit more \"oomph\" out of their existing equipment without breaking the bank in the process.\n&lt;a href=\"Arcanist\"&gt;Arcanist&lt;/a&gt;s are the most likely to choose this prestige class, often as a way of making money when not in the field adventuring or doing research. Humans are by far the most numerous in the ranks of the enchanters, although gnomes and goblins also dabble in the art. Members of all races may learn this profession.\nDisenchanting.\nThrough experimentation with arcane energies, the enchanter learns to destroy magic items and seize the raw power within them, drawing that energy into into himself for use in performing enchantments. items destroyed must be a type other than scrolls or potions \u2014 the energies within those items are too random and ephemeral to be of much use in the enchanter's craft.\nBreaking an item to absorb its power is a process referred to as &lt;a href=\"disenchanting\"&gt;disenchanting&lt;/a&gt; the item. The act requires the item's sundering in a controlled manner while the enchanter recites arcane rituals and mentally prepares his body to contain the mystical energy. Even so, he can perform the act fairly quickly, even in remote environments. The enchanter requires a full minute of undisturbed activity, which concludes with the destruction of the item \u2014 usually with a blow from a heavy or sharp object. If the item cannot be broken (say if it is made of &lt;a href=\"adamantine\"&gt;adamantine&lt;/a&gt; or is an &lt;a href=\"artifact\"&gt;artifact&lt;/a&gt;) it cannot be disenchanted. Many enchanters carry adamantine hammers with them for use on particularly stubborn objects."}

With the right incantations and materials, an enchanter can add bonuses to their armor or weapons, making them stronger, faster, or more resilient (among a host of other mystic powers). Canny enchanters sell their unique services to other heroes, and command prices commensurate with the rarity of the work they produce.\n\"Enchanters need the residue of magic items to work - the more potent the item, the rarer the residue. They also require enchanting rods to channel their magic.\n\"Enchanting doesn't rely on a particular gathering profession, so Enchanters occasionally pursue Tailoring to allow them to quickly create magic items to disenchant.\"\nTraining as an Enchanter.\nEnchanting is taught by various enchanting trainers located throughout the world. Prospective enchanters must be at least level 5. Initial training costs , granting the Apprentice level with a potential skill of 75 and access to a few starting enchantments. More enchantments can be learned from trainers, bought from vendors, or found throughout the world as the enchanter raises their skill level. In order to do enchantments, enchanters will need a &lt;a href=\"Runed%20Copper%20Rod\"&gt;Runed Copper Rod&lt;/a&gt; in their inventory.\nThe following are the required levels and potential skill of each stage of the profession:\nAdvancing as an Enchanter.\nEnchanting items is the only way to progress through the stages. All enchantments have a requisite minimum enchanting skill needed to be able to be learned and used. Known enchantments will appear as one of four colors in the profession window, with a certain chance for a skill up (gaining a point).\nAs enchanting skill increases, enchantments will eventually change from orange to yellow, yellow to green and green to grey. Only by finding higher skill level enchantments can one continue to progress through the profession. Approximately every 5-10 points, new enchantments will become available to learn from enchantment trainers. Alternatively, enchantments can be looted from corpses or purchased either from vendors or the &lt;a href=\"auction%20house\"&gt;auction house&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, some enchantments cannot be gotten until you have a certain &lt;a href=\"reputation\"&gt;reputation&lt;/a&gt; level with a particular faction. These are listed at the &lt;a href=\"Faction%20recipes/Enchanting\"&gt;faction recipes&lt;/a&gt; entry.\nHow to be an Enchanter.\nLow-level enchants (below skill 250) require rather large amounts of expensive components, but can rarely be sold. Even attempts to give them away for free can fail. Thus enchanters frequently end up re-enchanting the same item dozens of times just to increase their skill. At very low levels, disenchanting an item can increase one's Enchanting skill. This should be taken advantage of while available, as the materials gained will be used later regardless.\nLeveling enchanting is possible just with the materials gained from disenchanting items you find yourself and items from quests, but due to the slow rate, buying materials from the AH or having alternative characters, or friends or members of your guild supply you with items or materials can be quite a boost. Buying and disenchanting underpriced items from AH can be a cheaper way to obtain materials. Items such as a plate armor with +12 to Spirit has little value if worn or sold, but may disenchant to materials far in excess of the item's vendor value.\nA common tip is to disenchant items created with one of the crafting professions, such as tailoring, blacksmithing, jewelcrafting, or leatherworking. By leveling the crafting profession at the same time as enchanting, you will generate many uncommon-quality items. This is an easy way to obtain dusts and essences. However, depending on the item crafted and your server, selling either the crafting materials or the crafted item and buying enchanting materials with the money gained can be more effective. In most cases, it's an excellent way to offset the costs of leveling a crating profession, since the vast majority of low level crafting products are utterly worthless, but need to be made in order to train the skill. For this reason, recommended primary professions to accompany enchanting are:\nIn order to sell enchantments on the auction house or transfer them via mail, you have the option of putting an enchantment onto a piece of &lt;a href=\"Enchanting%20Vellum\"&gt;Enchanting Vellum&lt;/a&gt;. This will give any skill points as though the enchantment was put onto a piece of gear, and will allow the enchantment to be treated and moved around as a physical item. Enchanting Vellum is created by &lt;a href=\"Inscription\"&gt;Inscription&lt;/a&gt;, and can also be bought from Reagent or Enchanting suppliers.\nAll characters benefit from an enchanter's abilities. Some particular reasons why are:\nEnchanting requires a fairly good understanding of the mechanics of the game. You need to be familiar with what stats are of interest to which players and why, so that you can determine which enchants will be of value, and be able to advise players who might be unsure. \nDisenchanting.\nMagical elements (&lt;a href=\"dust\"&gt;dust&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Essence%20%28enchanting%29\"&gt;essences&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"shard\"&gt;shard&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20%28enchanting%29\"&gt;crystal&lt;/a&gt;s) are needed as &lt;a href=\"enchanting%20ingredient\"&gt;enchanting ingredient&lt;/a&gt;s, all of which can be created with &lt;a href=\"disenchanting\"&gt;disenchanting&lt;/a&gt;. Some magical elements can be found as &lt;a href=\"loot\"&gt;loot&lt;/a&gt; or purchased from the &lt;a href=\"Auction%20House\"&gt;Auction House&lt;/a&gt;, or even certain &lt;a href=\"Vendor\"&gt;Vendor&lt;/a&gt;s in limited quantities.\nDisenchanting requires a certain amount of skill to perform, depending on the level of the item being disenchanted.\n items cannot be disenchanted.\nDisenchanting items can level your enchanting skill up to at least 60.\nEnchanter-Only Benefits.\nHigh level enchanters are able to enchant their rings with a powerful statistical boost. See &lt;a href=\"Enchantments_by_slot%23Finger\"&gt;Enchantments by slot&lt;/a&gt; for a list of the available enchants.\nRaids or dungeons greatly benefit from having an enchanter in the party. Having an enchanter in the group will enable the Disenchant option when items uncommon-quality or better are being rolled for. This allows everyone the ability to disenchant any BoP items that no one wants, thus making an enchanter a valuable addition to a group.\nFrequently asked questions.\nQ: Can I disenchant soulbound items?\nA: It is possible to disenchant one's own soulbound items, but impossible to do so with other players soulbound items, even in the no trade window of the Trade dialog. Also, some soulbound items that are reputation related such as the &lt;a href=\"Hardened%20Stone%20Shard\"&gt;Hardened Stone Shard&lt;/a&gt; cannot be disenchanted, so be wary (do some research, see &lt;a href=\"Disenchanting%23Non-disenchantable_Items\"&gt;Non-disenchantable Items&lt;/a&gt;, before trying to get some items with the intent to disenchant them).\nQ: Can I enchant a single item more than once? Can I stack enchantments?\nA: Yes, you can enchant a single item multiple times, overwriting previous enchantments; no, they do not stack. A confirmation dialog is displayed before the replacement is committed. Overwriting is done to either upgrade the enchantment or to skill up rapidly, wasting the enchantments. \nQ: Can ANY enchantment stack? \nA: Yes, WoW distinguishes two kinds of enchantments that will stack, permanent enchantments and temporary enchantments. One temporary enchantment can be stacked with one permanent enchantment on each item. Enchanter enchantments are permanent as are item &lt;a href=\"augment\"&gt;augment&lt;/a&gt;s like for example &lt;a href=\"armor%20kit\"&gt;armor kit&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"shield%20spike\"&gt;shield spike&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Oil\"&gt;Oil&lt;/a&gt;s such as those produced by enchanters and &lt;a href=\"Alchemy\"&gt;alchemists&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"poisons\"&gt;poisons&lt;/a&gt; used by &lt;a href=\"rogues\"&gt;rogues&lt;/a&gt; are temporary enchantments. For example, you could enchant your staff with an intelligence buff and use &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Mana%20Oil\"&gt;Minor Mana Oil&lt;/a&gt; on it.\nQ: If I get the same enchant on both my main-hand and off-hand weapon (e.g., +15 agility), do I get the total of both enchants (+30 agility total)?\nA: Yes, they stack.\nQ: Can off-hand objects like orbs be enchanted? How about Fishing Poles?\nA: Fishing Poles are not considered 'weapons' and attempting to enchant them by an enchanter will give a \"That item is not a valid target\" error. Fishing lures are a temporary enchantment that can only be placed on fishing poles. Wands are a class of ranged weapons and currently can not be enchanted. Cataclysm level off hand items can be enchanted with intellect. At lower levels, only off-hand weapons and shields can be enchanted."}

The amounts/quality of enchanting ingredients received are the same as any &lt;a href=\"loot\"&gt;loot&lt;/a&gt;ed or &lt;a href=\"vendor\"&gt;vendor&lt;/a&gt; purchased items. Note that leatherworking requires a source of leather, whereas anyone can acquire fabric from humanoid mobs.\nTake these tables as suggestions or guidelines. &lt;a href=\"Brown%20Linen%20Robe\"&gt;Brown Linen Robe&lt;/a&gt; is a very viable item to produce to disenchant, it is the cheapest disenchantable item a tailor can produce. However, you may find that producing a slightly more expensive item provides a skill-up for you after Brown Linen Robes have gone gray. &lt;a href=\"Soft-Soled%20Linen%20Boots\"&gt;Soft-Soled Linen Boots&lt;/a&gt; they have a 5% chance to produce a small glimmering shard when disenchanted (but require a source for leather.)\nLeatherworkers may prefer to make &lt;a href=\"Fine%20Leather%20Gloves\"&gt;Fine Leather Gloves&lt;/a&gt;. These require half the leather that &lt;a href=\"Embossed%20Leather%20Boots\"&gt;Embossed Leather Boots&lt;/a&gt; require, but they require a &lt;a href=\"Cured%20Light%20Hide\"&gt;Cured Light Hide&lt;/a&gt;. Cured light hide is generally available for a roughly similar price as light leather in the auction house, has lower supply, but also lower demand. You may find it is cheaper to make the gloves.\nTailors can produce disenchantable items starting at tailoring skill 30. All of these require fabric, farmable from humanoids.\nLeatherworkers can produce disenchantable items starting at leatherworking skill 35, or at skill 40 using trainer recipes. All of these require leather, harvested primarily by skinners.\n&lt;a href=\"Blacksmithing\"&gt;Blacksmiths&lt;/a&gt; can produce disenchantable items starting at blacksmithing skill 35. All of these require metal, and most require gems. Both ingredient types are harvested primarily by miners.\n&lt;a href=\"Jewelcrafting\"&gt;Jewelcrafters&lt;/a&gt; can produce disenchantable items starting at jewelcrafting skill 1. All of these require metal, and most require gems. Both ingredient types are harvested primarily by miners. Most jewelcrafting products (the rings and necklaces) are disenchantable.\n&lt;a href=\"Engineering\"&gt;Engineers&lt;/a&gt; can produce disenchantable items starting at engineering skill 50. Most of these require metal, many require gems, and may require other materials, such as leather or fabric.\n&lt;a href=\"Enchanting\"&gt;Enchanter&lt;/a&gt; produced items are not disenchantable, even when similar items are available (&lt;a href=\"wands\"&gt;wands&lt;/a&gt;) that are disenchantable.\nJourneyman Enchanting.\n&lt;a href=\"Journeyman\"&gt;Journeyman&lt;/a&gt; Enchanting proficiency can be &lt;a href=\"train\"&gt;train&lt;/a&gt;ed as early as &lt;a href=\"level\"&gt;level&lt;/a&gt; 10 and 50 &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt;, permits progression up to 150 &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt; and uses the following &lt;a href=\"ingredient\"&gt;ingredient&lt;/a&gt;s:\n&lt;a href=\"Profession\"&gt;Profession&lt;/a&gt;s\n&lt;a href=\"Loot\"&gt;Loot&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Vendor\"&gt;Vendor&lt;/a&gt;s\nExpert Enchanting.\n&lt;a href=\"Expert\"&gt;Expert&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Enchanting\"&gt;Enchanting&lt;/a&gt; proficiency can be &lt;a href=\"train\"&gt;train&lt;/a&gt;ed as early as &lt;a href=\"level\"&gt;level&lt;/a&gt; 20 and 125 &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt;, permits progression up to 225 &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt; and uses the following &lt;a href=\"ingredient\"&gt;ingredient&lt;/a&gt;s:\n&lt;a href=\"Profession\"&gt;Profession&lt;/a&gt;s\n&lt;a href=\"Loot\"&gt;Loot&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Vendor\"&gt;Vendor&lt;/a&gt;s\nArtisan Enchanting.\n&lt;a href=\"Artisan\"&gt;Artisan&lt;/a&gt; Enchanting proficiency can be &lt;a href=\"train\"&gt;train&lt;/a&gt;ed as early as &lt;a href=\"level\"&gt;level&lt;/a&gt; 35 and 200 &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt;, permits progression up to 300 &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt; and uses the following &lt;a href=\"ingredient\"&gt;ingredient&lt;/a&gt;s:\n&lt;a href=\"Profession\"&gt;Profession&lt;/a&gt;s\n&lt;a href=\"Loot\"&gt;Loot&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Loot\"&gt;Loot&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Alchemy\"&gt;Alchemy&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Vendor\"&gt;Vendor&lt;/a&gt;s\nMaster Enchanting.\n&lt;a href=\"Master\"&gt;Master&lt;/a&gt; Enchanting proficiency can be &lt;a href=\"train\"&gt;train&lt;/a&gt;ed as early as &lt;a href=\"level\"&gt;level&lt;/a&gt; 50 and 300 &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt;, permits progression up to 375 &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt; and uses the following &lt;a href=\"ingredient\"&gt;ingredient&lt;/a&gt;s:\n&lt;a href=\"Profession\"&gt;Profession&lt;/a&gt;s\n&lt;a href=\"Loot\"&gt;Loot&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Alchemy\"&gt;Alchemy&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Vendor\"&gt;Vendor&lt;/a&gt;s"}

The cumulative effects of wearing multiple enchanted equipments can potentially exceed that of any one equipment, i.e., it is like having an extra piece of &lt;a href=\"equipment\"&gt;equipment&lt;/a&gt; that does not occupy a &lt;a href=\"slot\"&gt;slot&lt;/a&gt;. \nThere are currently no enchantments available for &lt;a href=\"trinket\"&gt;trinket&lt;/a&gt;s. There were also never any enchantments available for items equipped in the &lt;a href=\"relic\"&gt;relic&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"ammo\"&gt;ammo&lt;/a&gt; equipment slots, which are now removed from the game entirely.\nEnchantments which come from the &lt;a href=\"enchanting\"&gt;enchanting&lt;/a&gt; profession require the services of an &lt;a href=\"enchanter\"&gt;enchanter&lt;/a&gt;. There are also a number of enchant-granting items, or &lt;a href=\"augment\"&gt;augment&lt;/a&gt;s, available from a number of sources. These augments may be crafted by other professions (&lt;a href=\"Blacksmithing\"&gt;Blacksmithing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Engineering\"&gt;Engineering&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Leatherworking\"&gt;Leatherworking&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Tailoring\"&gt;Tailoring&lt;/a&gt;) or obtained from quests or vendors. There are a number of augments that can be purchased from various quartermasters after gaining reputation with their respective factions.\nEnchantments.\nFor full listings of non-socket enchants available, refer to these pages:\nNote.\n\"Note that the word enchantments, as used to describe the abilities enchanters imbue in magic items, are distinct from spells of the &lt;a href=\"Magic%20schools%20%28RPG%29%23Schools\"&gt;enchantment school&lt;/a&gt;. The word\u2019s context should make its definition clear.\""}

Most &lt;a href=\"instances\"&gt;instances&lt;/a&gt; feature several major encounters throughout their course.\nThere are a number of different types of encounters that are generally recognized. Note that these types are not mutually exclusive; most modern encounters fall into more than one category. Examples of each are given on their main pages.\nTank and spank.\nThe simplest type of encounter, a tank and spank fight has few or no adds, very simple or no meaningful mechanics and is considered very easy. Encounters of this type may sometimes be derisively viewed as \"loot pinatas\" for their simplicity. As raid encounters become increasingly more complex, the frequency of these is decreasing.\nDPS Race.\nA DPS race is an encounter where delivering maximum damage output is crucial to completing the encounter. They frequently feature relatively simple mechanics but tight enrage timers or instant wipe mechanics that trigger when a timer is reached. Alternatively, a DPS race may feature a mechanic where the boss(es) gain an increasing damage effect that is unsurvivable if it takes too long to kill the boss.\nAdd fight.\nThe opposite of a Tank and spank fight where there is one primary target that must be focused, the add fight revolves around managing (generally) a variety of different kinds of adds while killing the boss when you have a spare moment to damage them.\nCouncil Encounter.\nA council encounter sits between the tank and spank fight and the add fight. Unlike the tank and spank fight, there are multiple primary targets, but unlike the add fight, those targets all have a substantial amount of health and will likely be active for most or all of the encounter. There are several sub-types of council encounters depending on what happens when councillors die. In some council fights, the bosses each have an independent health pool, while in others the bosses share a single health pool. In some cases where they have separate health pools, the other councillors will heal and or buff when one of their allies dies, in others they do not.\nBattle for Surival.\nBattles for Surival are generally long and grueling encounters with little DPS throughput requirement (in contrast to DPS races) but either fairly high healing needs or incessant avoidable damage that is constantly pounding on the players. They are characterized by the importance of each member of the party surviving the encounter, as a single death will have a deleterious effect on the party's ability to kill the boss. Recent examples include &lt;a href=\"Thok%20the%20Bloodthirsty\"&gt;Thok the Bloodthirsty&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;\nStay Out of the Fire.\nA Stay Out of the Fire encounter revolves around dodging avoidable damage, whether it be literal fire on the ground or other effects that can be mitigated/avoided by proper play. Recent examples include &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron%20Dark%20Shaman\"&gt;Kor'kron Dark Shaman&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Siegecrafter%20Blackfuse\"&gt;Siegecrafter Blackfuse&lt;/a&gt;.\nHealer Encounter.\nHealer encounters are notable for containing a specific mechanic that requires healers to engage in different behavior, such as healing a boss or an add, in addition to or instead of their normal healing responsibilities. Recent examples include &lt;a href=\"Tsulong\"&gt;Tsulong&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Immerseus\"&gt;Immerseus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Malkorok\"&gt;Malkorok&lt;/a&gt;.\nBossless encounter.\nIn some ways the total opposite of a traditional boss, the bossless encounter generally revolves around managing a variety of different kinds of adds and has no central target or boss character, or the boss is immune to damage and cannot be conventionally defeated. Bossless encounters are very rare in World of Warcraft; the most recent are &lt;a href=\"Spine%20of%20Deathwing\"&gt;Spine of Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spoils%20of%20Pandaria\"&gt;Spoils of Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Assault\"&gt;Hellfire Assault&lt;/a&gt;."}

Today we drive them from &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;, tomorrow, perhaps from all of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;.\nRewards.\nYou will receive:\n \nProgress.\nThough they do possess some intelligence and some organization, I find it constantly amazing that the quilboars were able to capture and hold so much territory in &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. Perhaps they are more crafty an enemy than I give them credit for... \nCompletion.\nI will pass along word that the quilboars have been removed from their lairs, and that their structures may be set to fire. The removal of the Razormane from Durotar brings us closer to fully securing the borders of our new homeland. \nNotes.\nTo find the Razormane, head west on the road out of &lt;a href=\"Razor%20Hill\"&gt;Razor Hill&lt;/a&gt;. The Scouts and Quilboars are located at (43,47) to (44,50) south of the road, and the Dustrunners and Battleguards are located (44,41) to (45,41) north of the road.\nYou may come across a rare spawn quilboar named &lt;a href=\"Geolord%20Mottle\"&gt;Geolord Mottle&lt;/a&gt; among the &lt;a href=\"Razormane\"&gt;Razormane&lt;/a&gt; Quilboars and Scouts. She should not be too difficult to defeat in single combat, but does tend to heal often."}

The garrisons guard the approach to two giant doors at the entrance to &lt;a href=\"Shadowforge%20City\"&gt;Shadowforge City&lt;/a&gt;. When closed, these doors would block an invading army coming up the highway and entering the city. Passages built inside the doors would allow defenders to cross the road between the two garrisons and fire down at the invaders from openings. When players first enter the instance, the eastern door is locked in the open position. That position allows players to reach the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Anvil\"&gt;Black Anvil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Incendius\"&gt;Lord Incendius&lt;/a&gt; via the highway, but prevents them reaching the &lt;a href=\"West%20Garrison\"&gt;West Garrison&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"the%20Manufactory\"&gt;the Manufactory&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Guzzler\"&gt;Grim Guzzler&lt;/a&gt; in the west side of Shadowforge City. To close the door and align the passageways, the &lt;a href=\"Shadowforge%20Lock\"&gt;Shadowforge Lock&lt;/a&gt; inside the East Garrison must be lowered. Lowering the lock allows a wheel to turn, a chain to move, and the door to close.\nA small door near either &lt;a href=\"Prospector%20Seymour\"&gt;Prospector Seymour&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;) or &lt;a href=\"Razal%27blade\"&gt;Razal'blade&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;) provides easy access into the garrison from a location close to instance entrance. Alternatively, the garrison can be accessed once players entered the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20the%20Law\"&gt;Ring of the Law&lt;/a&gt; and defeated the challengers there. Players can also reach the garrison from &lt;a href=\"The%20Domicile\"&gt;The Domicile&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Shrine of Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt; by passing by the spectators looking down at the Ring of Law."}

Often, an Easter egg will reveal an inside joke, though Easter eggs can also be placed into in-game props and scenery or only in areas visible to those that are actively using \"cheat codes\" (or otherwise circumventing the \"normal\" operation of the software).\nWhile Easter eggs were once included in virtually all computer software, software companies such as Microsoft have discontinued the practice, citing security concerns associated with undocumented (and often untested) code.\nFor more hidden in-jokes and references, see &lt;a href=\"in-jokes%20and%20references\"&gt;in-jokes and references&lt;/a&gt;.\nEaster eggs in-game.\nThese are mostly &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard&lt;/a&gt;-related Easter eggs.\nSee &lt;a href=\"In-jokes%20and%20references\"&gt;In-jokes and references&lt;/a&gt; for more.\nGuards.\nGuards of cities will respond to some emotes such as codice_1, codice_2, codice_3, or codice_4. This does not apply to all guards though, most notably &lt;a href=\"Darnassus%20Sentinel\"&gt;Darnassus Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;s do not reply to emotes and even the same guard will not always respond. However, if you ask a Darnassus Sentinel about the enchanting trainer, she may respond as if you said she was enchanting. Also, if a blood elf paladin codice_5 a &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City%20Guardian\"&gt;Silvermoon City Guardian&lt;/a&gt;, they will codice_6.\nGoblin Shredder display.\nIf you look into the cockpit of a goblin shredder, you can see a picture of from \"&lt;a href=\"Starcraft\"&gt;Starcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" on the control panel. The new shredder model first introduced via the &lt;a href=\"Sky%20Golem\"&gt;Sky Golem&lt;/a&gt; features an updated image of Kerrigan from \"Starcraft II\". &lt;a href=\"Siegecrafter%20Blackfuse\"&gt;Siegecrafter Blackfuse&lt;/a&gt;'s modified shredder features an image of &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;.\nMichel Koiter.\nAt the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20the%20Fallen%20Warrior\"&gt;Shrine of the Fallen Warrior&lt;/a&gt;, there is a memorial dedicated to an &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; with the initials \"M-K\". M K was &lt;a href=\"Michel%20Koiter\"&gt;Michel Koiter&lt;/a&gt;, one half of &lt;a href=\"Twincruiser\"&gt;Twincruiser&lt;/a&gt;, a Blizzard illustrator who passed away during the development of \"World of Warcraft\". If you visit the memorial, you will find a &lt;a href=\"spirit%20healer\"&gt;spirit healer&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Koiter%20%28NPC%29\"&gt;Koiter&lt;/a&gt;. Most likely named in dedication for the once beloved man.\nMountaineer Pebblebitty.\nPlayers who are fed up with the rude female dwarf who presides over the quest chain to obtain the key to &lt;a href=\"Searing%20Gorge\"&gt;Searing Gorge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mountaineer%20Pebblebitty\"&gt;Mountaineer Pebblebitty&lt;/a&gt; in extreme southern Loch Modan, may feel inclined to use codice_2 on her after all the trouble she puts them through. Blizzard has anticipated this and provided an appropriate response.\nDeeprun Tram sightings.\nWhen you are riding on the tram, when in the underwater area, you can sometimes see &lt;a href=\"Nessy\"&gt;Nessy&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"naga%20siren\"&gt;naga siren&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Deeprun%20Diver\"&gt;Deeprun Diver&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Basking%20Shark\"&gt;Basking Shark&lt;/a&gt;, or a &lt;a href=\"Deeprun%20Chest\"&gt;Deeprun Chest&lt;/a&gt;.\nVanity pets.\nIf you own a non-combat pet and stop moving for a while, it will begin to sleep or do other kinds of emotes.\nStratholme Spectral Citizens.\nIf you type codice_8 on the civilian ghosts in Stratholme, they will respond in kind and dance with you. Even if you attack them, subsequently dancing with them will make them dance with you instead of continuing to attack you.\nAlso, appropriately, they will respond to the codice_2 emote with a rude action of their own.\nHidden Mickey Mouse.\nAn exceptionally well hidden Mickey Mouse is located in the Valley of Honor within the Horde city of Orgrimmar, where the Hunter trainers are. It is so large, and so well sculpted into the surroundings, that most people will never know that it is there. The only way to see it is to manually increase the maximum zoom setting of the camera.\nPunch cards.\nThe punch cards you get in &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt;, and the machines that read them, all have hidden binary messages on them which can be translated easily from screenshots with an online translator. For a full list see &lt;a href=\"Matrix%20Punchograph%203005\"&gt;Matrix Punchograph 3005&lt;/a&gt;.\nBambi.\nBambina (Bambi), Mother of Bambina (Bambi's Unnamed Mother), Flora (Flower), and Thudder (Thumper) will all be walking in close proximity to the Westfall Brigade Encampment where the ground is yellow (You will know what I mean when you get there). Also, there is a mob named \"Westfall Brigade Hunter\" who will occasionally spawn and shoot Mother of Bambina and do a /cheer, causing Bambina to become enraged, get renamed to \"Vengeful Bambina\", and start attacking the Hunter.\nThe Lost Vikings.\nThe three dwarves &lt;a href=\"Olaf\"&gt;Olaf&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eric%20%22The%20Swift%22\"&gt;Eric \"The Swift\"&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Baelog\"&gt;Baelog&lt;/a&gt; (in &lt;a href=\"Uldaman\"&gt;Uldaman&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Badlands\"&gt;Badlands&lt;/a&gt;) are all from another &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard&lt;/a&gt; game named \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20Vikings%20franchise\"&gt;The Lost Vikings&lt;/a&gt;\". &lt;a href=\"The%20Shaft%20of%20Tsol\"&gt;The Shaft of Tsol&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Gni%27kiv%20Medallion\"&gt;Gni'kiv Medallion&lt;/a&gt; were also references; \"Tsol\" and \"Gni'kiv\" are \"Lost\" and \"Viking\" backwards.\nMr. Pac-Man.\nThe main platform of the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Earthshrine\"&gt;Eastern Earthshrine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Western%20Earthshrine\"&gt;Western Earthshrine&lt;/a&gt; when flown above and looked down on, takes the appearance of .\nFun graphics.\nAlong the &lt;a href=\"Webwinder%20Path\"&gt;Webwinder Path&lt;/a&gt;, there are some felled trees. One end has a large smilie face on it.\nThere is also a large smiley face underneath &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt;. You can see it if you log out near Karazhan. Once you log back in, before the doodads and NPCs load up, you can see the smiley face. Humans can get under Karazhan to the smilie face by jumping to a certain ditch in the corner of the rubble in the back side of Karazhan (facing the crypt/graveyard).\nIn &lt;a href=\"Searing%20Gorge\"&gt;Searing Gorge&lt;/a&gt;, if you head just a little north of &lt;a href=\"Blackchar%20Cave\"&gt;Blackchar Cave&lt;/a&gt; and zoom your mini-compass all the way out, you can see a smiley face in it.\nWhen floating underwater, one of the motes that float by will very occasionally be a tiny smiley face.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt;, the vines on trees look like orc faces, or possibly, the &lt;a href=\"w%3Ac%3Azelda%3AGreat%20Deku%20Tree\"&gt;Great Deku Tree&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"w%3Ac%3Azelda%3AThe%20Legend%20of%20Zelda%20series\"&gt;\"Legend of Zelda\" series&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf one zooms in to the top of a Restoration Druid in form, he can see a hidden smiley face on the bark.\nOn any &lt;a href=\"Destroyer%23Human%20destroyer\"&gt;icebreaker&lt;/a&gt; ship, there is a smiley face inside at the front.\nLost.\nThere is a small island in the &lt;a href=\"Bittertide%20Lake\"&gt;Bittertide Lake&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Sholazar%20Basin\"&gt;Sholazar Basin&lt;/a&gt; with a door and a handle, on which there is a plaque that reads \"5 9 16 17 24 43\". It's a reference to the sequence of numbers \"4 8 15 16 23 42\" from the show .\nHelp.\nNortheast of &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt; on top of a mountain is a line of text that reads \"HERB\", but at another look you will see that it says \"HELP\" backwards.\nLOL.\nJust Southeast of &lt;a href=\"Hammerfall\"&gt;Hammerfall&lt;/a&gt; at the right angle, you can clearly see \"LOL\" carved into the mountain-side.\nStatue of Liberty.\nLocated within &lt;a href=\"Ironband%27s%20Excavation%20Site\"&gt;Ironband's Excavation Site&lt;/a&gt; is a partially unearthed Statue of Liberty. This asset was on Stranglethorn Vale's beach in the WoW alpha, a reference to \"Planet of the Apes\", but it was removed and remained as such until Cataclysm.\nClam face.\nSlightly southwest of the &lt;a href=\"Wreck%20of%20the%20Mist-Hopper\"&gt;Wreck of the Mist-Hopper&lt;/a&gt; there is a face made out of clams smoking a pipe.\nChicken on guitar.\nIn the main building of &lt;a href=\"Mistfall%20Village\"&gt;Mistfall Village&lt;/a&gt;, a bush chicken is playing a troll guitar in hopes of spare change."}

The Eastern Kingdoms is made up from a group of smaller continents (&lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28continent%29\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;) formed from the original continent of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor%20%28landmass%29\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; following the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;.

They are located east of the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Western Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;, north of the &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt;, and south of the &lt;a href=\"Ghostlands\"&gt;Ghostlands&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis region remains the main bastion of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; in Lordaeron but is not as important as it was in the past. They still retain at least some control over the city of &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;. The ground is brown, ugly, and sick, the trees corrupted into giant mushrooms and the air is polluted with orange mist. The &lt;a href=\"Plaguewood\"&gt;Plaguewood&lt;/a&gt; is the most infested part of the region. Undead, necromancers, and &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Damned&lt;/a&gt; cultists still prowl the land. The &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; attempts to rid the land of the undead infestation one day and trains their faithful soldiers in the renovated &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt; and watch over the land from their towers scattered across it. The &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;forest troll&lt;/a&gt; hold of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Mashar\"&gt;Zul'Mashar&lt;/a&gt; in the north is in danger and could become a bastion for the undead as its inhabits are being transformed.\nThe former &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; has fallen into disarray and retreated shortly after the fall of &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Enclave\"&gt;Scarlet Enclave&lt;/a&gt; and departure of the leadership to Northrend. The remnants were slain and risen into undeath by &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt;, who returned from &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; after his defeat in Scarlet Bastion years ago.\nWhile the ravages of the plague linger, they are fading slowly. The Argent towers and other areas are oases for those who traverse the Eastern Plaguelands.\nHistory.\nLike the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Western Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;, the Eastern Plaguelands were once beautiful and brimming with &lt;a href=\"farm\"&gt;farm&lt;/a&gt;s and small villages known collectively as Eastweald. The regional government was centered around the city of &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;, the second largest city in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. Also nearby were the towns of &lt;a href=\"Darrowshire\"&gt;Darrowshire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Corin%27s%20Crossing\"&gt;Corin's Crossing&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Hand\"&gt;Tyr's Hand&lt;/a&gt;, and to the east of Stratholme was the &lt;a href=\"Thalassian%20Pass\"&gt;pass&lt;/a&gt; leading into the southern boundaries of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, the bordering area with Quel'Thalas saw fighting between the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt; that invaded Quel'Thalas. A small band of orcs broke off from the main invading force and &lt;a href=\"Razing%20of%20Blackwood\"&gt;burned&lt;/a&gt; the small town of &lt;a href=\"Blackwood\"&gt;Blackwood&lt;/a&gt; to the ground, killing all of its inhabitants in spite of the valorous defense marshaled by its lord.\nThird War and aftermath.\nIn the opening hours of the Third War, the investigations into the origins of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; led &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Prince Arthas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; through the &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt; and what is now the Western Plaguelands (more specifically, the towns of &lt;a href=\"Andorhal\"&gt;Andorhal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hearthglen\"&gt;Hearthglen&lt;/a&gt;), where they confronted the necromancer &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Cult of the Damned&lt;/a&gt;. Kel'Thuzad told Arthas to seek out the leader of the Scourge in Lordaeron, the &lt;a href=\"Nathrezim\"&gt;Dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mal%27Ganis\"&gt;Mal'Ganis&lt;/a&gt;, at Stratholme. While en route via Hearthglen, Arthas and Jaina were joined by &lt;a href=\"Uther%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Lord Uther&lt;/a&gt;, master of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;. When they arrived at Stratholme, Arthas realized that the villagers had been infected with the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;Plague of Undeath&lt;/a&gt;. When Uther refused to obey Arthas' command to purge the city, Arthas relieved Uther of command and disbanded the Silver Hand, then slaughtered the townsfolk himself. After hunting down Mal'Ganis in Northrend, Arthas returned as one of the Lich King's death knights and toppled the Kingdom of Lordaeron by murdering his own father, &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;King Terenas&lt;/a&gt;. After the fall of Lordaeron's capital, the plague spread throughout the northern regions of Lordaeron, turning them into the blighted lands they are today.\nThe resistance against the Scourge was particularly bloody at Darrowshire, where the ghoul &lt;a href=\"Horgus\"&gt;Horgus the Ravager&lt;/a&gt; and the death knight &lt;a href=\"Marduk%20Blackpool\"&gt;Marduk Blackpool&lt;/a&gt; (alias &lt;a href=\"Marduk%20the%20Black\"&gt;Marduk the Black&lt;/a&gt;) led an army of Scourge against the town. Only surviving paladins under &lt;a href=\"Davil%20Crokford\"&gt;Davil Crokford&lt;/a&gt; and the Darrowshire militia under Captain &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Redpath\"&gt;Joseph Redpath&lt;/a&gt; were able to stand in their way. Though they put up a valiant fight, the defenders of Darrowshire were not enough to stave off the endless legions of Scourge. Davil managed to defeat Horgus in combat, but he succumbed to the horrific wounds the ghoul had inflicted. Captain Redpath fell to Marduk's necromancy, his soul taken from his body and corrupted into the service of the Scourge, where he proceeded to turn on his fellows and tear Darrowshire apart, killing everyone who hid in their homes.\nAfter the fall of Lordaeron, &lt;a href=\"Alexandros%20Mograine\"&gt;Alexandros Mograine&lt;/a&gt; formed a Crusade from the remnants of Lordaeron's &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; and attempted to retake the shattered kingdom from both the Scourge and the undead renegades known as the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;. In the Eastern Plaguelands, they took control of both the town of &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Hand\"&gt;Tyr's Hand&lt;/a&gt; and the western districts of &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;, where they battle the forces of &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Rivendare\"&gt;Baron Rivendare&lt;/a&gt; to gain control of the destroyed city. After the death of Alexandros Mograine, the Crusade went through a schism; forming factions such as the &lt;a href=\"Brotherhood%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Brotherhood of the Light&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt; which established themselves in &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt;, and with those who remained in the original Crusade renaming themselves the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nMeanwhile, the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; continued to fight over the abandoned Lordaeron towers scattered around the Eastern Plaguelands. Eventually, the master of the Scourge in Lordaeron made his return to the blighted lands. From his citadel of &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt;, floating over the Plaguewood near Stratholme, he prepared to continue the work he began in the name of his master, the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe dread citadel &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt; stood in this region, and with it &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;'s reign was enforced and undisputed. With the help of the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Darion%20Mograine\"&gt;Darion Mograine&lt;/a&gt; infiltrated the floating &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; citadel and tried his luck at bringing it down. He ultimately failed, losing his life in the process. However, he managed to free his father, &lt;a href=\"Alexandros%20Mograine\"&gt;Alexandros Mograine&lt;/a&gt; (formerly the wielder of the &lt;a href=\"Ashbringer\"&gt;Ashbringer&lt;/a&gt;), from undeath, finally giving his spirit rest. Without him, the dark fortress was left severely weakened as he was one of the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Horsemen%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Four Horsemen&lt;/a&gt; who led the military forces in Naxxramas. And so, with this in mind, the Argent Dawn led an all-out assault on the fortress and defeated Kel'Thuzad, but failed to actually kill him. The Citadel ended up \"vanishing\" from the Plaguelands not too long after.\nSome other events happened such as the &lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Courier\"&gt;Crimson Courier&lt;/a&gt;, who could be seen roaming from &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Hand\"&gt;Tyr's Hand&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;. She was usually escorted by four &lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Bodyguard\"&gt;Crimson Bodyguard&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Demetria\"&gt;Demetria&lt;/a&gt;, the Scarlet Oracle, could also &lt;a href=\"The%20Scarlet%20Oracle%2C%20Demetria\"&gt;be made&lt;/a&gt; to leave Tyr's Hand alongside eight &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Trooper\"&gt;Scarlet Trooper&lt;/a&gt;s. By the time of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, she was gone.\nPrior to the start of the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt;, the Eastern Plaguelands were invaded by a group of &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s led by &lt;a href=\"Highlord%20Kruul\"&gt;Highlord Kruul&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe area was also &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20Invasion\"&gt;invaded&lt;/a&gt; twice by the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; in the years leading to the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;.\nRecently, Naxxramas floated away from the Plaguelands and reappeared over &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt; in Northrend, though it was replaced by over the far eastern portion of the zone. From there, Arthas sent his &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s to exterminate both the Scarlet Crusade and the Argent Dawn and leave his grip over the Plaguelands unchallenged. But, there is that old saying about the best-laid plans of mice and men (and Lich Kings)...\nWrath of the Lich King.\nThe Eastern Plaguelands have been expanded somewhat to include a small area for &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s, including their home base of , a massive Scourge necropolis floating above the hills behind Light's Hope Chapel. It is here that the death knight trainers, as well as their leader &lt;a href=\"Highlord%20Darion%20Mograine\"&gt;Highlord Darion Mograine&lt;/a&gt;, can be found.\nDeath knights start out in Scourge service in a special instanced area east of Tyr's Hand known as the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Enclave\"&gt;Scarlet Enclave&lt;/a&gt;. As they progress in their training, death knights are tasked with laying waste to the towns of &lt;a href=\"New%20Avalon\"&gt;New Avalon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Havenshire\"&gt;Havenshire&lt;/a&gt;, which lay below the fortress. The towns are left in ruins as the death knights sweep through them with the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; inhabiting them all but destroyed. After sacking both towns, death knight players participate in a final, epic &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Battle for Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt;. After the battle is concluded, the death knight is deposited into the \"main\" (non-instanced) Eastern Plaguelands, where they begin their service to the faction their race belongs to. In the \"main\" Eastern Plaguelands, the Scarlet Lands - consisting of Tyr's Hand, New Avalon, and Havenshire - are left completely in ruins, their once-green pastures devoured by the blight that permeates the rest of the region.\nThe ruins of the towns of &lt;a href=\"New%20Avalon\"&gt;New Avalon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Havenshire\"&gt;Havenshire&lt;/a&gt;, collectively referred to as the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20the%20Scarlet%20Enclave\"&gt;Ruins of the Scarlet Enclave&lt;/a&gt;, are reachable from two directions. First, players may travel through &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Hand\"&gt;Tyr's Hand&lt;/a&gt;, and take the final fork in the road to the north. Alternately, players may travel through &lt;a href=\"Browman%20Mill\"&gt;Browman Mill&lt;/a&gt; into the &lt;a href=\"Noxious%20Glade\"&gt;Noxious Glade&lt;/a&gt; and follow the south wall to a cave which leads to &lt;a href=\"Death%27s%20Breach\"&gt;Death's Breach&lt;/a&gt;, at the northern end of the Ruins.\nCataclysm.\nSince the Cataclysm, the Argent Crusade has strengthened its presence in the Plaguelands, claiming not only outposts formerly held by the now-defunct Argent Dawn, such as &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt;, but also the former &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; town of &lt;a href=\"Hearthglen\"&gt;Hearthglen&lt;/a&gt;, and the four towers through the Eastern Plaguelands; around which the plague has receded. They have also joined forces with the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; to help heal the Plaguelands from its plagued state.\nDespite Montoy's treachery, the &lt;a href=\"Brotherhood%20of%20Light\"&gt;Brotherhood of Light&lt;/a&gt; eventually triumphed over the Scourge in Northrend and have returned to the Eastern Plaguelands. They have begun their own campaign against the remaining &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Risen\"&gt;Risen&lt;/a&gt; forces in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;; attempting to reclaim the cities of &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Hand\"&gt;Tyr's Hand&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt;. Though the Brotherhood and the Crusade are still allied with one another, the Argent Crusade is concerned with the Brotherhood's recklessness, and their dislike to the Crusade's rigid code of ethics.\nTheir campaign concludes with the capture of Tyr's Hand from the undead, but also with the capture of the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Bastion\"&gt;Scarlet Bastion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alonsus%20Chapel\"&gt;Alonsus Chapel&lt;/a&gt; now under the control of the Argent Crusade after the death of &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Aurius%20Rivendare\"&gt;Lord Aurius Rivendare&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe amount of corruption in the land itself seems to have diminished somewhat, roughly to levels displayed by the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Western Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt; before the Cataclysm. The plague has been cleansed from Argent Crusade controlled territory, such as Light's Hope Chapel and the five towers, and water flows again in formerly drained riverbeds.\nGeography.\nThe Eastern Plaguelands contain a normal instanced dungeon (&lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;), and formerly contained the raid dungeon &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt;. The micro dungeon &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Hand\"&gt;Tyr's Hand&lt;/a&gt; can also be found here. &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt; serves as a travel hub for both the Horde and the Alliance. There are no battlegrounds in this zone, though it is a world PvP area.\nMaps and subregions.\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//wow.gamepressure.com/map.asp%3FID%3D25\"&gt;Topographic map of Eastern Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;\nNotable characters.\nThe Eastern Plaguelands are home to several characters of note. At Light's Hope Chapel, &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Maxwell%20Tyrosus\"&gt;Lord Maxwell Tyrosus&lt;/a&gt; leads the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt; in the fight against the Scourge. At the Marris Stead, &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller\"&gt;Nathanos Blightcaller&lt;/a&gt; sends bold heroes of the Horde against the Scarlet Crusade. At his home by the Thondroril River, &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt; seeks to eradicate the dark horrors that the Plaguelands offer. And in the halls of Acherus, high above Light's Hope Chapel, &lt;a href=\"Darion%20Mograine\"&gt;Highlord Darion Mograine&lt;/a&gt; commands the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuests.\nThe main plotline in Eastern Plaguelands deals with an adventure of a worgen merchant named &lt;a href=\"Fiona\"&gt;Fiona&lt;/a&gt; and her two paladin friends, &lt;a href=\"Gidwin%20Goldbraids\"&gt;Gidwin Goldbraids&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tarenar%20Sunstrike\"&gt;Tarenar Sunstrike&lt;/a&gt; that run a &lt;a href=\"Fiona%27s%20Caravan\"&gt;caravan&lt;/a&gt; riding across the zone, as the story progresses. Gidwin and Tarenar along with the adventurer later join the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; forces stationed in &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt; in order to rid the land of undead infestation.\nIn the RPG.\nThe Eastern Plaguelands are dominated by the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Lich\"&gt;archlich&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; commands the region from the ruined city of &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;, the Scourge capital in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Undead\"&gt;Undead&lt;/a&gt; roam the land freely, and one might run into a dozen of them upon entering the area. The entirety of the Plaguelands is polluted and wretched, &lt;a href=\"Blight%20%28plague%29\"&gt;blighted&lt;/a&gt; by the Scourge. The &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;undead plague&lt;/a&gt; has corrupted the people and nature itself. Noxious orange mists known as the &lt;a href=\"Poison%20Mist\"&gt;Poison Mist&lt;/a&gt;, float like living entities over the blackened, filthy soil. The Scourge's power here is absolute, and they undoubtedly hoard vast &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;al power and potent artifacts in its cities.\nDespite the undead's power, &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;ity and other forces gather in pockets of resistance. &lt;a href=\"Forest%20troll\"&gt;Forest troll&lt;/a&gt;s from &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt; in the north battle the Scourge to reclaim their ancient kingdom, and a crazed human group, the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt;, struggles courageously and vainly against the undead. The only safe place in this wretched land is the human city of &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Hand\"&gt;Tyr's Hand&lt;/a&gt;, the Crusade's base of operations in the region.\nDescription.\nThe Scourge controls the Plaguelands. The undead are intelligent and draw their power from the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; far to &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;the north&lt;/a&gt;. Now that the Lich King has regained his power, all the Scourge's members are utterly loyal, and it cannot be expected to see more defectors such as &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Lady Sylvanas&lt;/a&gt; and her &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Cultist\"&gt;Cultist&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"ghoul\"&gt;ghoul&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"skeletal%20warrior\"&gt;skeletal warrior&lt;/a&gt;s and worse roam the lands, slaughtering the few survivors when they find them. The undead need no rest and never complain.\nAgainst this indomitable force battles the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt;. As their name implies, these human &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s dress in bright reds \u2014 a stark contrast to the devastated gray landscape. The Crusaders are frenetic, desperate to destroy the Scourge, but well and truly crazy. The Crusaders are fearless zealots. Drawing strength and conviction from the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;, they are dedicated to eliminating undead and offering protection to human survivors. Unfortunately, the Crusaders tend to think that anyone unassociated with them carries the undead plague and simply kill refugees more often than not. They are well armed and armored, and keep their equipment highly polished. Though their hearts are in the right place, their minds are addled \u2014 the tiny group is a pathetic force against the Scourge's might. The Scarlet Crusade must be incorporated into a larger army to be successful. And someone has to kick the righteousness out of it.\nA large forest troll force has also moved into the region. Striking south from Zul'Aman, these trolls are led by &lt;a href=\"Thresh%27jin\"&gt;Thresh'jin&lt;/a&gt;, and they seek to regain their ancestral kingdom. Forest trolls are no friends to &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; or humans, but they are enemies of the Scourge. If promised their kingdom, they might join an alliance.\nGeography.\nThe Eastern Plaguelands are north of the &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt; and east of the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Western Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Darrowmere%20Lake\"&gt;Darrowmere Lake&lt;/a&gt; borders the region on the south, while &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; lie to the north. The land is blighted, the plants and animals soiled and corrupted. The &lt;a href=\"Blight%20%28plague%29\"&gt;blight&lt;/a&gt; has altered the trees, transforming them into stands of gigantic mushrooms, which are recommended not to eat. Darrowmere Lake provides reasonably fresh water, but the longer the Scourge remains the fouler the water grows. To the north, the elevation rises toward Quel'Thalas and Zul'Aman. Kel'Thuzad's minions are the only creatures that roam the land.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

They are located east of the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Plaguelands%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Western Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt; and north of the &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Scourge\u2019s rule here is supreme. Their southern capital of &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt; is here, under the command of the lich, Kel\u2019Thuzad. The ground is brown, ugly, and sick, the trees corrupted into giant mushrooms and the air polluted with orange mist. Undead, necromancers, and &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Damned&lt;/a&gt; cultists prowl the land. The Scarlet Crusade boasts a large army and battles fervently and vainly against the Scourge; outsiders are also unwelcome. &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt; forest trolls strike from the north, attempting to reclaim their ancestral empire.\nThe area is roamed by mutant creatures and soldiers of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, while members of the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; fight a constant battle to drive the Scourge out of &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt; from their Chapel and key base at &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Hand\"&gt;Tyr's Hand&lt;/a&gt;. Only a small camp maintained by the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt; remains friendly to all, welcoming adventurers that would lend a strong arm or spell. Located at &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt;, this staging area serves as a last bastion of Light in a land blanketed in darkness.\nWith &lt;a href=\"Patch%201.12\"&gt;Patch 1.12&lt;/a&gt;, objective-based &lt;a href=\"world%20PvP\"&gt;world PvP&lt;/a&gt; was added to the zone. Members of the Horde and the Alliance battle in &lt;a href=\"A%20Game%20of%20Towers\"&gt;A Game of Towers&lt;/a&gt; for four strategic ruined outposts spread throughout the land. Controlling these towers gives area-wide benefits and certain towers provide other, unique advantages.\nHistory.\nLike the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Plaguelands%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Western Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;, the Eastern Plaguelands were once beautiful and brimming with farms and small villages. The regional government was centered around the city of &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;, the largest city in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. Also nearby were the towns of &lt;a href=\"Darrowshire\"&gt;Darrowshire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Corin%27s%20Crossing\"&gt;Corin's Crossing&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Hand\"&gt;Tyr's Hand&lt;/a&gt;, and to the east of Stratholme was the &lt;a href=\"Thalassian%20Pass\"&gt;pass&lt;/a&gt; leading into the southern boundaries of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;. At this time, it was known as the Darrowmere Forest after the &lt;a href=\"Darrowmere%20Lake\"&gt;lake with the same name&lt;/a&gt; to the south.\nIn the opening hours of the Third War, the investigations into the origins of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; led &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Prince Arthas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; through the &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt; and what is now the Western Plaguelands (more specifically, the towns of &lt;a href=\"Andorhal\"&gt;Andorhal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hearthglen\"&gt;Hearthglen&lt;/a&gt;), where they confronted the necromancer &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Cult of the Damned&lt;/a&gt;. Kel'Thuzad told Arthas to seek out the leader of the Scourge in Lordaeron, the &lt;a href=\"Nathrezim\"&gt;Dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mal%27Ganis\"&gt;Mal'Ganis&lt;/a&gt;, at Stratholme. While en route via Hearthglen, Arthas and Jaina were joined by &lt;a href=\"Uther%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Lord Uther&lt;/a&gt;, master of the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;. When they arrived at Stratholme, Arthas realized that the villagers had been infected with the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;Plague of Undeath&lt;/a&gt;. When Uther refused to obey Arthas' command to purge the city, Arthas relieved Uther of command and disbanded the Silver Hand, then slaughtered the townsfolk himself. After hunting down Mal'ganis in Northrend, Arthas returned as one of the Lich King's death knights and toppled the Kingdom of Lordaeron by murdering his own father, &lt;a href=\"King%20Terenas\"&gt;King Terenas&lt;/a&gt;. After the fall of Lordaeron's capital, the plague spread throughout the northern regions of Lordaeron, turning them into the blighted lands they are today.\nThe resistance against the Scourge was particularly bloody at Darrowshire, where the ghoul &lt;a href=\"Horgus\"&gt;Horgus the Ravager&lt;/a&gt; and the death knight &lt;a href=\"Marduk%20Blackpool\"&gt;Marduk Blackpool&lt;/a&gt; (alias &lt;a href=\"Marduk%20the%20Black\"&gt;Marduk the Black&lt;/a&gt;) led an army of Scourge against the town. Only surviving paladins under &lt;a href=\"Davil%20Crokford\"&gt;Davil Crokford&lt;/a&gt; and the Darrowshire militia under Captain &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Redpath\"&gt;Joseph Redpath&lt;/a&gt; were able to stand in their way. Though they put up a valiant fight, the defenders of Darrowshire were not enough to stave off the endless legions of Scourge. Davil managed to defeat Horgus in combat, but he succumbed to the horrific wounds the ghoul had inflicted. Captain Redpath fell to Marduk's necromancy, his soul taken from his body and corrupted into the service of the Scourge, where he proceeded to turn on his fellows and tear Darrowshire apart, killing everyone who hid in their homes.\nAfter the fall of Lordaeron, the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; attempted to retake the shattered kingdom from both the Scourge and the undead renegades known as the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;. In the Eastern Plaguelands, they took control of both the town of Tyr's Hand and the western districts of Stratholme, where they battle the forces of &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Rivendare\"&gt;Baron Rivendare&lt;/a&gt; to gain control of the destroyed city. \nThe &lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Courier\"&gt;Crimson Courier&lt;/a&gt; could be seen roaming from &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Hand\"&gt;Tyr's Hand&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;. She was usually escorted by four &lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Bodyguard\"&gt;Crimson Bodyguard&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Demetria\"&gt;Demetria&lt;/a&gt;, the Scarlet Oracle, could also &lt;a href=\"The%20Scarlet%20Oracle%2C%20Demetria\"&gt;be made&lt;/a&gt; to leave Tyr's Hand alongside eight &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Trooper\"&gt;Scarlet Trooper&lt;/a&gt;s.\nGeography.\nThe Eastern Plaguelands contain a normal instanced dungeon (&lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;), and formerly contained the raid dungeon &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt;. The micro dungeon &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Hand\"&gt;Tyr's Hand&lt;/a&gt; can also be found here. &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt; serves as a travel hub for both the Horde and the Alliance. There are no battlegrounds in this zone, though it is a world PvP area.\nTravel hubs.\n&lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt; is the primary travel hub to and from the Eastern Plaguelands, and connects directly to the Alliance city of &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; and the Horde city of &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;..\n&lt;a href=\"Flight%20path\"&gt;Flight path&lt;/a&gt;s from &lt;a href=\"Plaguewood%20Tower\"&gt;Plaguewood Tower&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Note that you may only use the Plaguewood Tower Flight Path if your faction controls the tower (as it is part of the &lt;a href=\"A%20Game%20of%20Towers\"&gt;A Game of Towers&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"World%20PvP\"&gt;World PvP&lt;/a&gt; event).\"\n\"Plaguewood Tower's Flight Path is the only path in the game to use the &lt;a href=\"spectral%20gryphon\"&gt;spectral gryphon&lt;/a&gt; for all character classes, and it is used regardless of Faction.\"\nNotable characters.\nThe Eastern Plaguelands are home to several characters of note. At Light's Hope Chapel, &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Maxwell%20Tyrosus\"&gt;Lord Maxwell Tyrosus&lt;/a&gt; leads the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt; in the fight against the Scourge. At the Marris Stead, &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller\"&gt;Nathanos Blightcaller&lt;/a&gt; sends bold heroes of the Horde against the Scarlet Crusade. At his home by the Thondroril River, &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt; seeks to eradicate the dark horrors that the Plaguelands offer."}

After awakening from their confinement like the rest of the dracthyr, they felt betrayed by their former &lt;a href=\"Aspect\"&gt;Aspect&lt;/a&gt; and decided to cut off ties with the &lt;a href=\"dragonflight\"&gt;dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;s, departing and renaming themselves the Sundered Flame. Led by &lt;a href=\"Scalecommander%20Sarkareth\"&gt;Scalecommander Sarkareth&lt;/a&gt;, the Flame went on a quest to reclaim their legacy and obtain the secrets of Neltharion for themselves, entering into open conflict with the inhabitants of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt; or anyone who would stand in their way, including their former kin.\nFollowing Sarkareth's death in &lt;a href=\"Aberrus\"&gt;Aberrus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Scalecommander%20Emberthal\"&gt;Scalecommander Emberthal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Winglord%20Dezran\"&gt;Winglord Dezran&lt;/a&gt; embraced the lost, surviving members of the Sundered Flame and they re-took their original name, the Ebon Scales.\nHistory.\nThe Ebon Scales.\nFollowing the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Dracthyr\"&gt;Dracthyr&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Neltharion\"&gt;Neltharion&lt;/a&gt;, the Ebon Scales were created to serve by bringing destruction upon the enemies of the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;. Upon the destruction of the &lt;a href=\"Oathbinder\"&gt;Oathbinder&lt;/a&gt;, Neltharion ordered the dracthyr into their creches beneath the &lt;a href=\"Forbidden%20Reach\"&gt;Forbidden Reach&lt;/a&gt;, where they were sealed away by Malygos in magical stasis and watched over by his &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;. They remained there, abandoned and forgotten for nearly 20,000 years, awakened from their long slumber only when the &lt;a href=\"Primalists\"&gt;Primalists&lt;/a&gt; returned to break &lt;a href=\"Raszageth\"&gt;Raszageth&lt;/a&gt; free, as an ancient, magical surge rippled through the Forbidden Reach, the dracthyr awoke, but from their long stasis their memories became a blur.\nUpon their awakening the Ebon Scales seemingly destroyed the blue dragons imprisoning them, only to be confronted by &lt;a href=\"Ekrazathal\"&gt;Ekrazathal&lt;/a&gt;. However, with the timely arrival of a group of dracthyr led by &lt;a href=\"Scalecommander%20Azurathel\"&gt;Scalecommander Azurathel&lt;/a&gt;, the dracthyr were able to defeat their foe. However, in the aftermath, &lt;a href=\"Scalecommander%20Sarkareth\"&gt;Scalecommander Sarkareth&lt;/a&gt; stubbornly remarked that \"They will only take orders from Neltharion\", but did agree to work with their fellow dracthyr, &lt;a href=\"Ebyssian\"&gt;Ebyssian&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt; in combating the Primalists. During the conflict the dracthyr learned of Neltharion's death and a powerful storm unleashed by Raszageth forced them to evacuate the Forbidden Reach, the only home they ever knew. In the aftermath, Sarkareth declared that their vow to serve the dragons was sundered, just as Neltharion had broken their promises to them. He then subsequently renamed the Ebon Scales to the Sundered Flame and vowed that they would claim their destiny by rights.\nThe Sundered Flame.\nAs the Sundered Flame, the weyrn struck out against the denizens of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt; in their quest to uncover the secrets of Neltharion whilst also claiming their place in the world with the power they gather, find or steal. They also rebelled against the rule of dragons over lesser dragonkin and recruited lesser dragonkin into their cause.\nSome of them investigated the &lt;a href=\"Nelthazan%20Ruins\"&gt;Nelthazan Ruins&lt;/a&gt;, but went mad because of the whispers of &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"The%20Black%20Locus\"&gt;Black Locus&lt;/a&gt;. Others in the &lt;a href=\"Azure%20Span\"&gt;Azure Span&lt;/a&gt; were investigating the &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Ruins\"&gt;Lost Ruins&lt;/a&gt; to find the &lt;a href=\"Valthrux\"&gt;Valthrux&lt;/a&gt;, another powerful artifact, while more Sundered Flame agents were busy seeking the power of &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Karnthar\"&gt;Karnthar&lt;/a&gt; to unleash it on the &lt;a href=\"Dragonscale%20Expedition\"&gt;Dragonscale Expedition&lt;/a&gt;. A group of Sundered Flame also laid siege to the &lt;a href=\"Cobalt%20Assembly\"&gt;Cobalt Assembly&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"Venderthvan\"&gt;Venderthvan&lt;/a&gt; feeling that his clutch mates had gone too far in their quest for power asked adventures to stop them, while he took care of a group of blue dragon whelps. Another group led by &lt;a href=\"Telash%20Greywing\"&gt;Telash Greywing&lt;/a&gt; invaded the &lt;a href=\"Azure%20Vault\"&gt;Azure Vault&lt;/a&gt; under the false belief that their was a power hidden within, when in reality the simulacrum of &lt;a href=\"Sindragosa\"&gt;Sindragosa&lt;/a&gt; was hiding the existence of &lt;a href=\"Umbrelskul\"&gt;Umbrelskul&lt;/a&gt;.\nMeanwhile, Sarkareth himself caught wind of the Dragonscale Expedition investigating a titan vault and snuck into &lt;a href=\"Valdrakken\"&gt;Valdrakken&lt;/a&gt; and stole a &lt;a href=\"Watcher%20Log\"&gt;Watcher Log&lt;/a&gt; under the belief that the information inside would them power from the titans. With information from the log, he sent Sundered Flame agents to the &lt;a href=\"Zelthrak%20Outpost\"&gt;Zelthrak Outpost&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Azure%20Span\"&gt;Azure Span&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Szar%20Skeleth\"&gt;Szar Skeleth&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Ohn%27ahran%20Plains\"&gt;Ohn'ahran Plains&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Veiled%20Ossuary\"&gt;Veiled Ossuary&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Thaldraszus\"&gt;Thaldraszus&lt;/a&gt; in order the fragments needed to open the vault. However with their aid of the allies, the Dragonscale Expedition was able to secure the stone and the vault for themselves. However, the Sundered Flame used this to their advantage by simply stealing their research information on the vault itself.\nFollowing the death of &lt;a href=\"Raszageth\"&gt;Raszageth&lt;/a&gt;, the storms surrounding the Forbidden Reach vanished, opening the way for the Sundered Flame to return. During this time they clashed against the Dragonscale Expedition, their fellow dracthyr led by &lt;a href=\"Scalecommander%20Emberthal\"&gt;Scalecommander Emberthal&lt;/a&gt;, and their allies, as they acquired information about &lt;a href=\"Aberrus%2C%20the%20Shadowed%20Crucible\"&gt;Aberrus, the Shadowed Crucible&lt;/a&gt;. After the &lt;a href=\"Primal%20Incarnates\"&gt;Primal Incarnates&lt;/a&gt; opened the way into the &lt;a href=\"Zaralek%20Cavern\"&gt;Zaralek Cavern&lt;/a&gt;, the Sundered Flame was able to claim Aberrus and bolster the forces with the remnants of Neltharion's loyalists that remained within the crucible. However as the Sundered Flame carried out their invasion, Sarkareth found himself falling under the sway of the void, causing other members of the Sundered Flame like &lt;a href=\"Amythora\"&gt;Amythora&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Marithos\"&gt;Marithos&lt;/a&gt; to defect after he tried to enslave them with the &lt;a href=\"Oathbinder\"&gt;Oathbinder&lt;/a&gt; and abandoned them when it was destroyed.\nIn time the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; and their allies led by &lt;a href=\"Sabellian\"&gt;Sabellian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt; invaded Aberrus and killed a great number of Sundered Flame agents, including Sarkareth himself.\nThe Ebon Scales reborn.\nEmberthal and former Sundered Flame dracthyr discovered a group of Sundered Flame in the Azure Span who were still aligned with Sarkareth's ideals because, while they had learned news of Sarkareth's demise, they did not know the circumstances of his death. Before the dracthyr could make violence upon one another, &lt;a href=\"Winglord%20Dezran\"&gt;Winglord Dezran&lt;/a&gt; told them that Sarkareth's path had only led to ruin, and that it was time for the Sundered Flame to become the Ebon Scales again under the command of &lt;a href=\"Scalecommander%20Emberthal\"&gt;Scalecommander Emberthal&lt;/a&gt;. In the aftermath, the Ebon Scales made their way to &lt;a href=\"Valdrakken\"&gt;Valdrakken&lt;/a&gt; and reunited with their fellow dracthyr."}

Thus far the world's defenders have shattered the power base of the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; cult and defeated the raging &lt;a href=\"elemental%20lord\"&gt;elemental lord&lt;/a&gt;s &lt;a href=\"Al%27Akir\"&gt;Al'Akir&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt;. Yet despite these victories, as long as Deathwing is free to pursue his twisted goals, Azeroth will remain under threat.\nNo one is more aware of this fact than the great Dragon Aspects &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt;. Together with the wise &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, they have devised a plan to vanquish Deathwing with a weapon of his own design: the infamous &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn patch 4.3, Thrall and the noble Aspects will call upon the Horde and the Alliance to help them retrieve the artifact \u2014 no longer in existence \u2014 from the distant past. Those brave enough to face the challenge will embark on a perilous journey from Azeroth's apocalyptic &lt;a href=\"End%20Time\"&gt;End Time&lt;/a&gt; to the Dragon Soul's point of origin during the catastrophic &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf the heroes succeed, an even more harrowing battle awaits them in the present... \nPatch 4.2 Rage of the Firelands.\nIn the days immediately following the Cataclysm, the &lt;a href=\"Firelord\"&gt;Firelord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; and his minions attempted to ravage the world even further, pushing a damaged &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; over the brink of oblivion. Their invasion was turned away at &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, but the threat of their presence lingers. It is not enough to simply deflect the danger posed to Hyjal, &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt; and all of Azeroth \u2013 it must be ended.\nIn patch 4.2, it's up to you to push the conflict back from the peaks of Mount Hyjal into the endless blaze of the &lt;a href=\"Firelands\"&gt;Firelands&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 to lead a full-scale invasion of the elemental plane of Fire, and do battle with Ragnaros and his minions in their very lair.\nPrepare yourself for war. \nPatch 4.1 Rise of the Zandalari.\nThe days when great &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"empire\"&gt;empire&lt;/a&gt;s stretched across &lt;a href=\"ancient%20Kalimdor\"&gt;ancient Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; are long past. Millennia of war and internal strife have stripped these nations of their power, lands, and glory. As Azeroth recovers from the destruction of the Cataclysm, the world's divided troll populations face a bleak future. These dark times have spurred the trolls of the &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;, the historically wise and scholarly tribe from which all trolls originated, to take drastic action. They have embarked on a bold crusade to save their race by uniting trolls into a single mighty empire. With the Zandalari's aid, the fallen capitals of the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20Empire\"&gt;Gurubashi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Amani%20Empire\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt; nations\u2014&lt;a href=\"Zul%27Gurub\"&gt;Zul'Gurub&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt;\u2014are already rebuilding, replenishing their forces for a bloody campaign to expand their territories.\nYet Vol'jin and his &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jungle%20troll\"&gt;trolls&lt;/a&gt; are not aligned with the Zandalari. They have sworn to stand with their Horde comrades\u2014and even work with the Alliance\u2014should the trolls ignite a new war on Azeroth. Soon, Vol'jin might be forced to act on his promise, for if the Gurubashi and Amani are left to their own devices, the world will know the legendary strength and savagery of the ancient troll empires once again. \nPatch 4.0 Cataclysm.\nWithout warning, the corrupted Dragon Aspect, Deathwing, erupts from the stone heart of &lt;a href=\"Deepholm\"&gt;Deepholm&lt;/a&gt;, the domain of earth within the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Plane\"&gt;Elemental Plane&lt;/a&gt;. Jagged fissures are torn across the earth, and monstrous waves pummel coastal regions. From &lt;a href=\"Thousand%20Needles\"&gt;Thousand Needles&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt;, the surface of Azeroth is reforged through violent upheavals. Now, the Horde and the Alliance must defend their homes against Deathwing and his minions, burdened by the unsettling fact that the world as they know it has changed\u2026 forever.\nOriginal (2004-2010) Article content and Sub-Articles.\nThe World of Warcraft is constantly evolving.

You can find specific info, patch notes, and extensive details on all of the additions below.\nPatch 3.2 Call of the Crusade.\nSince the opening of the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Tournament\"&gt;Argent Tournament&lt;/a&gt; in northeastern &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt;, adventurers have journeyed from across Azeroth and beyond to prove their worth in the heart of the Lich King's domain. Under thundering skies the tournament's participants hone the arts of war and face off in bone-shattering jousting matches to earn the right to be called champions. Yet these heroes have yet to face the greatest challenge of all: the &lt;a href=\"Crusaders%27%20Coliseum\"&gt;Crusaders' Coliseum&lt;/a&gt;. Formidable Horde and Alliance champions, ferocious beasts, and Scourge lieutenants are just some of the opponents awaiting adventurers in this &lt;a href=\"gladiator\"&gt;gladiator&lt;/a&gt;ial arena. Few will survive the coliseum's perils, but the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; is confident that the worthy heroes who do emerge victorious will be ready to join the offensive against Icecrown Citadel and end the Lich King's reign of terror.\nPatch 3.1 Secrets of Ulduar.\nFor millennia, &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt; has remained undisturbed by mortals, far away from their concerns and their struggles. Yet since its recent discovery, many have wondered what the structure's original purpose may have been. Some thought it a city built to herald the glory of its makers; some thought it a vault containing innumerable treasures, perhaps even relics of the mighty &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt;s themselves. Such speculations were wrong...\nUlduar's gates have swung open, allowing heroes of the Horde and the Alliance to venture into the titan &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;'s ancient halls. In addition to an all-new raid dungeon, this content patch will introduce the dual-talent specialization system, new quest lines, and the epic tier-8 armor sets.\nEU version.\nFor millennia, Ulduar has remained undisturbed by mortals, far away from their concerns and their struggles. Yet since its recent discovery, many have wondered what the structure's original purpose may have been. Some thought it a city built to herald the glory of its makers; some thought it a vault containing innumerable treasures, perhaps even relics of the mighty titans themselves. Such speculations were wrong.\nBeyond Ulduar's gates lies no city, no treasure vault, no final answer to the titan's mysteries. All that awaits those who dare set foot in Ulduar is a horror even the titans could not, would not destroy -- an evil they merely... contained.\nBeneath ancient Ulduar, the Old God of death lies, whispering... Tread carefully, or its prison will become your tomb.\n3.0.2 Echoes of Doom.\nYou've mastered the challenges of &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, but are you ready for what's yet to come? From the frozen north come tidings of a dormant evil awakening, filling the hearts and minds of Azeroth's citizens with unease. Heroes across the land are preparing for the harsh journey ahead with a sense of anticipation and purpose.\n&lt;a href=\"Echoes%20of%20Doom\"&gt;Echoes of Doom&lt;/a&gt;, the last major content patch for World of Warcraft: &lt;a href=\"The%20Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;The Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;, lays the groundwork for the upcoming &lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;Wrath of the Lich King&lt;/a&gt; expansion. It adds a wealth of improvements and entirely new gameplay features to World of Warcraft\nPatch 2.4.0 Fury of the Sunwell.\nYou have traveled through the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; and braved the perils of Outland; you faced off against the might of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; itself, and you prevailed. Now the journey that began with the arrival of the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; on Azeroth and the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;' inclusion into the Horde is about to come full circle as a mighty army gathers to purge evil from one of Azeroth's most important loci of power: the ancient, magical &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;.\nPatch 2.3.0 The Gods of Zul'Aman.\nThe stronghold of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt; has stood for millennia as the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Forest%20troll\"&gt;trolls&lt;/a&gt;' seat of power and bastion of the fearless, cunning warlord &lt;a href=\"Zul%27jin\"&gt;Zul'jin&lt;/a&gt;.\nZul'jin has spent several years plotting behind Zul'Aman's walls. Furious at the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; for allowing his hated enemies, the blood elves, to join its ranks, he eagerly embraced a scheme that the &lt;a href=\"witch%20doctor\"&gt;witch doctor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Malacrass\"&gt;Malacrass&lt;/a&gt; recently proposed: to seal the power of the animal &lt;a href=\"God\"&gt;gods&lt;/a&gt; within the bodies of the Amani's strongest warriors.\nNow Zul'Aman's army grows more powerful by the day, hungry to exact vengeance in the name of its fearless leader, Zul'jin.\nPatch 2.2.2 Voice Chat!\nAzeroth is alive with the sound of voices. For the first time, players are able to talk to each other in game with the use of the new Voice Chat feature. Also in this patch, aspiring moviemakers can now use their Mac to capture all the in-game action and share it with their friends.\nPatch 2.1.0 The Black Temple.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Karabor\"&gt;Temple of Karabor&lt;/a&gt; was the center of &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; worship until its &lt;a href=\"Priest\"&gt;priests&lt;/a&gt; were slaughtered by &lt;a href=\"Demon\"&gt;demonically&lt;/a&gt; corrupted &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;orcs&lt;/a&gt;. In the massacre's aftermath the &lt;a href=\"Warlock\"&gt;warlocks&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt; seized the structure and gave it a new name: The &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; invaded &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; hastily opened several &lt;a href=\"Dimensional%20gateway\"&gt;dimensional portals&lt;/a&gt; in order to escape. The resulting magical backlash ripped the world apart. Drawn by these portals, the &lt;a href=\"pit%20lord\"&gt;pit lord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Magtheridon\"&gt;Magtheridon&lt;/a&gt; arrived in what had come to be known as &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; and took the temple as his seat of power.\nHis dominion over Outland remained unchallenged until the arrival of &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan the Betrayer&lt;/a&gt;. The pit lord proved no match for the wielder of the &lt;a href=\"Twin%20Blades%20of%20Azzinoth\"&gt;Twin Blades of Azzinoth&lt;/a&gt;. Today Illidan occupies the temple, awaiting any and all who would challenge his rule.\nPatch 2.0.1 Before the Storm.\nThe biggest storms are often preceded by a sudden calm, as if the whole world stands still for a moment while the winds gather all their strength. This patch includes many important changes and improvements leading up to the release of , including the new PvP Honor and Arena systems. Prove your worth on the Battlegrounds and earn new, powerful PvP Honor rewards, or take the ultimate test of your team PvP skills in the new Arena System. Also, you can already learn the new class talents that will help you brave the many challenges awaiting you in Outland and beyond.\nThere are many new, groundbreaking features to be found in this patch, but always remember - this is nothing but the calm... before the storm.\nPatch 1.12 Drums of War.\nFor the first time in the history of World of Warcraft, you can take on players from other realms in the battlegrounds. Replenish your mana, sharpen your blades, and get ready for some brand-new challengers! Also, this patch introduces world PvP objectives to Silithus and the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Eastern Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;. The stage is set for intense, objective-based land battles as Horde and Alliance vie for control over important strategic positions and resources around Azeroth.\nPatch 1.11 Shadow of the Necropolis.\nFloating above the &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands\"&gt;Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"necropolis\"&gt;necropolis&lt;/a&gt; known as &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt; serves as the seat of one of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;'s most powerful officers, the dreaded &lt;a href=\"lich\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;. Horrors of the past and new terrors yet to be unleashed are gathering inside the necropolis as the Lich King's servants prepare their assault. The &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; marches again... Naxxramas is the new 40-man raid dungeon that will present even the most experienced and powerful players with an epic challenge.\nOnce, Kel'Thuzad was not very different from the other &lt;a href=\"magi\"&gt;magi&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;. Ambitious, maybe, perhaps more radical in his convictions, but certainly not more powerful than his peers. Yet it was Kel'Thuzad the Lich King made into a key figure of the Scourge's remorseless assault on the lands of the living. Now, the man named Kel'Thuzad is gone, and all that remains is Kel'Thuzad the lich, right hand of the Lich King and ruler of the necropolis Naxxramas. What evil was it that led him down this path? Learn more about the events that darkened the fate of Kel'Thuzad, and ultimately of all Azeroth, in Road to Damnation, a short story preview of the upcoming content patch for World of Warcraft.\nPatch 1.10 Storms of Azeroth.\nWeather has at last arrived across the continents of the land. Priests' abilities have been further tuned, and many high-level raid instances have undergone significant changes, with adjustments to difficulty, rewards, and the number of players allowed to venture together into the depths of the darkest, most dangerous places of Azeroth. Prepare yourselves for the coming storm!\nPatch 1.9 The Gates of Ahn'Qiraj.\nThe Gates of Ahn'Qiraj will house two massive, unique dungeons - the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ruins of Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt;, a 20 -man raid dungeon, and the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Temple of Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt;, a 40-man raid dungeon. As players delve deeper into the mysteries of &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt;, they will discover revelations of the &lt;a href=\"Silithid\"&gt;Silithid&lt;/a&gt; infestation and their shadowy masters, the &lt;a href=\"Qiraji\"&gt;Qiraji&lt;/a&gt;, Players will have to complete a world event of massive proportions before they can open the Gates of Ahn'Qiraj on their realm.\nThe Gates of Ahn'Qiraj will house two massive, unique dungeons - the Ruins of Ahn'Qiraj, a 20-man raid dungeon, and the Temple of Ahn'Qiraj, a 40-man raid dungeon.

Four &lt;a href=\"Green%20dragon\"&gt;green dragons&lt;/a&gt;, once proud lieutenants of &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt; now corrupted by the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;, have appeared in Azeroth to destroy the life they once dearly protected. Adventurers must ride forth and defend the land from this new threat. . .\nMeanwhile in &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;. the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; gathers at its &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Hold\"&gt;Hold&lt;/a&gt; to research the strange goings-on both above and underneath the shifting sands. Something dangerous is stirring beyond the &lt;a href=\"Scarab%20Wall\"&gt;Scarab Wall&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; are extremely active in the area, working to uncover some unnamed evil. Can you uncover the mysteries therein?\nPatch 1.7 Rise of the Blood God.\nVenture into &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Gurub\"&gt;Zul'Gurub&lt;/a&gt;, ancient city of the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20tribe\"&gt;Gurubashi&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jungle%20troll\"&gt;trolls&lt;/a&gt;, and do battle against the minions of the &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20the%20Soulflayer\"&gt;Blood God Hakkar&lt;/a&gt;.

There, the &lt;a href=\"League%20of%20Arathor\"&gt;League of Arathor&lt;/a&gt; fights against the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Defilers\"&gt;Defilers&lt;/a&gt; to gather these vital supplies for their armies. Join the battle in the name of the Horde or Alliance and take control over the &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Basin\"&gt;Basin&lt;/a&gt;!\nPatch 1.6 Assault on Blackwing Lair.\nLord &lt;a href=\"Victor%20Nefarius\"&gt;Victor Nefarius&lt;/a&gt; has long taunted the defenders of the land during their adventures in &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt; - now, at last, &lt;a href=\"Blackwing%20Lair\"&gt;his lair&lt;/a&gt; lies open, awaiting those daring enough to set foot within.

In the formerly pristine &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Valley\"&gt;Alterac Valley&lt;/a&gt;. the &lt;a href=\"Stormpike%20Guard\"&gt;Stormpike&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"dwarves\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20clan\"&gt;Frostwolf clan&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;orcs&lt;/a&gt; fight over the rights to the strategic piece of land. Huge armies clash upon the slopes of the snowy vale. Over in &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Silverwing%20Sentinels\"&gt;Silverwing Sentinels&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20clan\"&gt;Warsong&lt;/a&gt; orcs battle for the forest - the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; to save their ancestral land. the orcs to chop it down for valuable war supplies. Both battles require the most stalwart of soldiers; it is time to fight for lord and land!\nPatch 1.4 The Call to War.\nThere was no help for it; the seasoned troops on both the Horde and Alliance were becoming beleaguered. The fierce light of battle was fading from their eyes. Leaders feared retaliation by their enemy, assured that they would strike any day. Something had to be done to rekindle that fire, to return vigor to their valiant soldiers. The cities of Azeroth now grant ranks to their fighters, and the craftsmen of both sides have been working feverishly to provide their armies with new items for use in the war effort. Fight on, brave and noble adventurers, and achieve glory!\nPatch 1.3 Ruins of Dire Maul.\nBuilt long ago by &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt;'s followers, the ancient, magical city of &lt;a href=\"Eldre%27Thalas\"&gt;Eldre'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; was the center for the &lt;a href=\"highborne\"&gt;highborne&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; research. Thousands of years have passed since the destruction of the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;. and the broken city's three wings have been overrun by &lt;a href=\"Ghost\"&gt;ghostly&lt;/a&gt; Highborne, &lt;a href=\"satyr\"&gt;satyr&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ogre\"&gt;ogres&lt;/a&gt;.

In the massacre's aftermath the &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt; seized the structure and bestowed upon it a new name: the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt;.\nFor years the Shadow Council bloodied the Black Temple with foul demonic rituals, but after the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; the dark spellcasters fell to the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;'s devastating invasion of Draenor. The &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; hastily opened several &lt;a href=\"Dimensional%20gateway\"&gt;dimensional portal&lt;/a&gt;s in order to stage a retreat, and the resulting magical backlash ripped the world apart. In what had become the fractured realm of &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, Ner'zhul's portals were a strategic advantage that appealed to the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; general , who quickly seized the Black Temple as his seat of power.\nMagtheridon commanded many of the orcs remaining in Outland and bolstered his army with &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt; forces streaming in through the portals.

And yet, despite Illidan's efforts to seal Ner'zhul's portals, Kil'jaeden's wrath will not be denied.

Intended to be the symbol of Dark Iron power, the fortress was held by the sinister dwarves for centuries. However, Nefarian - the cunning son of the dragon, Deathwing - had other plans for the great keep. He and his draconic minions took control of the upper Spire and made war on the dwarves' holdings in the mountain's volcanic depths, which serve as the seat of power for Ragnaros the Firelord. Ragnaros has uncovered the secret to creating life from stone and plans to build an army of unstoppable golems to aid him in conquering the whole of Blackrock Mountain.\nNefarian has vowed to crush Ragnaros. To this end, he has recently begun efforts to bolster his forces, much as his father Deathwing had attempted to do in ages past. However, where Deathwing failed, it now seems the scheming Nefarian may be succeeding. Nefarian's mad bid for dominance has even attracted the ire of the Red Dragon Flight, which has always been the Black Flight's greatest foe. Though Nefarian's intentions are known, the methods he is using to achieve them remain a mystery. It is believed, however that Nefarian has been experimenting with the blood of all of the various Dragon Flights to produce unstoppable warriors.\nNefarian's sanctum, Blackwing Lair, can be found at the very height of Blackrock Spire. It is there in the dark recesses of the mountain's peak that Nefarian has begun to unfold the final stages of his plan to destroy Ragnaros once and for all and lead his army to undisputed supremacy over all the races of Azeroth."}

The night elves expended a great deal of effort to preserve the knowledge within its walls, and greater energy still to keep it there.

It's about the &lt;a href=\"Echo%20Isles\"&gt;Echo Isles&lt;/a&gt; changes in the &lt;a href=\"expansion\"&gt;expansion&lt;/a&gt;. \nArchive.\nVol'jin: The Glory of the Darkspears.\nMost of Azeroth's savage trolls are infamous for their extreme hatred of other races, but the Darkspear tribe and its leader, Vol'jin, are an exception. Over the years, the Darkspears have proven to be invaluable members of the Horde. Vol'jin in particular is known to offer strategic advice to Warchief Thrall on a regular basis, and the cunning troll played a role in retaking the Undercity after it was overthrown by the rebel forces of Varimathras and Putress.\nYet for all of the tribe's accomplishments, the Darkspears are still plagued by a tragic history of exile. Long ago they were driven from Stranglethorn Vale's mainland by the more powerful trolls of the Gurubashi empire and then settled on a remote island. The Darkspears later sought refuge with the Horde when their isle was destroyed by a mysterious sea witch, and Thrall granted the trolls new lands on the Echo Isles off the coast of Durotar. Aside from a brief exodus when Daelin Proudmoore's fleet arrived to hunt down orcs, the Darkspears enjoyed relative stability until one of their own, Zalazane, drove his brethren from their latest home.\nThe witch doctor Zalazane had been one of the tribe's leading mystical instructors when he was inexplicably driven to insanity by the powers under his control. Utilizing dark magic, he enslaved many of his fellow tribespeople and amassed an army of mindless Darkspear trolls. Fearing that all of his tribe would come under Zalazane's sway, Vol'jin ordered the remaining free Darkspears to abandon the Echo Isles.\nVol'jin's Darkspears settled in nearby Sen'jin Village, which they have since used as a staging point to attack Zalazane. Over the years, members of the Horde looking to test their worth have braved the Echo Isles to confront Zalazane, and many of them even returned seemingly victorious with his severed head. These victories, however, proved to be nothing more than illusions created by the twisted witch doctor's dark magic. Days after these trophies were taken to Sen'jin Village, they reverted to their true forms: painted rocks and coconuts adorned with wooden tusks, or even the heads of Zalazane's enslaved trolls.\nDespite these setbacks and his preoccupation with advising Thrall on Horde-related matters, Vol'jin has spent considerable time formulating a strategy to recapture the Echo Isles. Now he believes that the time to strike at Zalazane has come. As the Darkspear leader and his close allies Vanira and Champion Uru'zin await approval of their plan from the ancestral spirits, they have begun rounding up new troll recruits and staging reconnaissance missions to learn about Zalazane's minions.\nYet Vol'jin's trolls are short on forces, and the enslaved Darkspears on the Echo Isles outnumber them. The Darkspears are well-known for being among Azeroth's bravest combatants, however, and fortunately many non-trolls have expressed interest in assisting Vol'jin, perhaps hoping that restoring the Echo Isles will eventually bolster the Horde's strength.\nVol'jin is also aware of the strategic importance that a Darkspear homeland offers his allies, but he is motivated by more personal reasons. Zalazane's betrayal was an affront against Vol'jin's dream of a better life for his tribe, a destiny that his late father, Sen'jin, envisioned years ago. Only by retaking the Echo Isles will Vol'jin be able to honor his father and at long last secure a permanent homeland for the long-exiled Darkspear tribe.\n\"Zalazane Must Fall!\" Cries Vol'jin.\nEmbedded on the coast of Durotar, the tiny troll Village of Sen'jin is bursting with recent activity. In what some claim is a retort to the overblown assertions of the vertically-challenged High Tinker Mekkatorque, Troll Chieftain Vol'jin has announced his intention to \"honor de ancestors n' take back da 'omeland, mon.\" The call has been given, and the scattered Darkspear tribe has begun to gather at the once-sleepy location. Now the primal rhythm of beating drums and strange clouds of acrid smoke drift aloft deep into the night, arguably a sign of celebration and preparation for an impending offensive.\nWith the full support of Thrall and his counterparts, Vol'jin is calling upon all factions of the Horde to prepare for an assault on Echo Isles and the twisted witch doctor Zalazane. He will pay for his crimes against the Darkspears and the land bestowed upon them by Thrall! As explained by Vol'jin in the demand for Zalazane's fall today, honorable members of the Horde passing through the village proper -- whether they've never slain a boar in their lives or are the subject of every dragon's nightmare -- will be given a chance to help their upstanding troll brothers in what will surely be the most brutal of attacks. But first there must be preparation. With the Echo Isles on the line, no detail is too small, no spoken word too trivial. And for that reason the noted troll shaman, Vanira, will get adventurers started on the monumental tasks ahead.\nUsing sacred totemic rituals, Vanira needs frogs for her agenda. It is unclear of her exact intentions with these amphibious lurkers of Sen'jin, but there appears to be a bat handler standing by. Could it be that frogs will soon rain down from the heavens upon the Echo Isles? When asked for further comment, Vanira only remarked that she's seeking \"da perfect spies.\" It seems war is sometimes won with even the most unlikely of arsenals. Spying on the enemy, however, is only the beginning. Vol'jin has spoken of a most-trusted trainer of reinforcements, Champion Uru'zin, who will guide new recruits of all ranges of experience into battle-hardened Darkspear warriors. \"Trollin' for volunteers,\" as Vol'jin remarked, will be a key component to building a strike force capable of overthrowing Zalazane's hexed Darkspears.\nVol'jin argues that the spirits are on the side of his Darkspear tribe. Can animistic beliefs truly manifest into proven battle leverage against Zalazane? Perhaps only Vanira and her beguiled spies can answer this. But it is rumored that, long ago, a tribe of troll druids once called the Echo Isles home. If ever there was a time for good omens such as this, it is now. Only if the spirits truly are on the side of the son of Sen'jin, reportedly only a phenomenon that Witch Doctor Hez'tok can decipher, then the assault will commence! Those who assist Hez'tok in his ceremony will be adorned with Darkspear Pride, allowing adventurers the ability to take on the form of an elite Darkspear Warrior during battle. Wearing such battle garb is an honor to the ancestors of a people long persecuted and plagued by war between tribes.\nShould the spirits give their blessing to Vol'jin, Champion Uru'zin will call for all seasoned veterans of the Horde levels 75-80 to aid in the attack. If \"at last, everythin' be ready,\" as Vol'jin put it, his plan is to launch a full assault from the shores of Sen'jin village. Vol'jin exclaimed in his call for such an assault today, \"come, now! Join in de liberation of de Echo Isles! Zalazane will fall!\" He's gone so far as to offer a particularly rare Darkspear Shroud to those who help bring Zalazane down. Even still, sources report that this foe possesses powerful voodoo and black magic.\nPreparations for Zalazane's fall are underway, but will it be enough to best this witch doctor? It's time, proud members of the Horde, to stand with your disaffected troll brethren and recognize the full might of the Darkspear tribe!"}

The call goes out to the strongest, most cunning, and bravest heroes to join the Shattered Sun Offensive in the battle to reclaim the Sunwell.\nRead more about the new features of the Fury of the Sunwell update below:\nSunwell Plateau.\nFor millennia the mystical pool of energy known as the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt; fueled the potent &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; of the exiled &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt;. The Sunwell's inexhaustible power permeated the elves and infused them with a constant supply of &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; energy. For generations the high elves protected and cherished the well, benefiting from its powers even when outside the borders of their homeland, &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlthough the elves sustained heavy losses in the &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Wars\"&gt;Troll Wars&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, the Sunwell remained secure... until the coming of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. Without warning the &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt;, a mighty servant of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, led his &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; armies in a merciless attack upon the &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;elven kingdom&lt;/a&gt;.\nUndeterred by the desperate struggles of the elven defenders, the Scourge marched on toward the Sunwell, slaughtering any who attempted to bar their path. The legendary king &lt;a href=\"Anasterian%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Anasterian Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; faced off against Arthas in an attempt to slow the undead advance, but even his unyielding will and extraordinary powers proved insufficient against the merciless death knight.\nWith the elven capital lying in ruin, Arthas marched triumphantly to the Sunwell and tossed the bones of the fallen &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; into the radiant beam of light. With this act the sacred well was instantly corrupted. Knowing he had sealed the fate of the high elves, Arthas departed with the newly resurrected Kel'Thuzad to carry on in service of the Lich King. Many of the Scourge, however, remained behind to prey upon the few elves who had not yet fallen.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Elven%20ranger\"&gt;ranger&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; organized the remaining survivors to fight the undead, but it was the return of Prince &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas\"&gt;Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt; that brought the elves a fragment of renewed hope.\nTragically Kael'thas soon learned that the greatest danger to his people was posed not by the Scourge, but by the Sunwell itself. The corrupted powers of the well still permeated not only the elves, but all that they had built. Given enough time, the vile necromantic energies would kill the elves and spread an incurable poison throughout the surrounding land.\nKael'thas painfully concluded that the Sunwell, the heart of their society, must be destroyed.\nAnd so he executed a plan that would irrevocably change the fate of his people. With the aid of the most powerful remaining magi, accompanied by Lor'themar and a party of volunteer defenders, Kael'thas succeeded in destroying the mystical Sunwell.\nOr so he thought.\nThe Sunwell's energies had been dispersed, and yet not all of its essence was lost. A mysterious individual named &lt;a href=\"Borel\"&gt;Borel&lt;/a&gt; gathered what remained of the energies and hid them away in the guise of a mortal girl, &lt;a href=\"Anveena\"&gt;Anveena&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the aftermath of the Sunwell's destruction, Kael'thas declared that his people would be forever known as the &lt;a href=\"sin%27dorei\"&gt;sin'dorei&lt;/a&gt;, or blood elves, so they would never forget those who had fallen in defense of their homeland.\nAlthough the Sunwell's threat was ended, Kael'thas could not have foreseen the effect its loss would have on his people. The elves suffered terribly from withdrawal, for many of them had been infused with the arcane energies of the well all their lives. Only in the absence of the Sunwell did the blood elves come to realize how addicted they had grown to its powers. Over time the elves grew ill, and the youngest and oldest among them died. Determined to find a cure for his people's crippling &lt;a href=\"Magical%20addiction\"&gt;addiction&lt;/a&gt;, Prince Kael'thas sought a renewed source of arcane power, and he soon fell into the service of the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith Illidan's aid, the blood elves found a temporary reprieve, learning to siphon the magical energies of others to ease their own suffering. As Kael'thas joined the fight against Illidan's many enemies, the prince came to rely more and more on &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; energy: the dark and corrupting essence wielded by the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; itself.\nNow, bristling with newfound power, Kael'thas has turned his back on his former master, Illidan, and has finally returned to Quel'Thalas, promising final deliverance to his people. To this end he has harnessed the mortal possessor of the Sunwell's energies, Anveena. Yet many believe that the prince's exposure to fel energies has made him unstable, and that he has sought out a new master, a &lt;a href=\"demon%20lord\"&gt;demon lord&lt;/a&gt; of the Burning Legion so terrible that even the mighty Illidan would tremble in fear at the sound of his name:\n&lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;.\nSunwell Isle.\nWith the next patch, the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell%20Isle\"&gt;Sunwell Isle&lt;/a&gt; will be available for play. This area includes a new quest hub and 5-player and 25-player instances. Join the &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Sun%20Offensive\"&gt;Shattered Sun Offensive&lt;/a&gt; in shutting down Kael'thas' nefarious operations. This new force is comprised by both the &lt;a href=\"Aldor\"&gt;Aldor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Scryers\"&gt;Scryers&lt;/a&gt; and is led by the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt;. Players will take part in claiming &lt;a href=\"Sun%27s%20Reach\"&gt;Sun's Reach&lt;/a&gt; and setting up a larger base of operations to stop Kael'thas and the Legion.\nNew Daily Quests.\nThe combined forces of &lt;a href=\"Shattrath\"&gt;Shattrath&lt;/a&gt; have launched an attack on the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Isle of Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt;, to confront Kael'thas and the Legion at the Sunwell and surrounding areas. Players will be able to gain reputation with the Shattered Sun Offensive and participate in a new set of daily quests, including new daily dungeon quests for both the heroic and non-heroic five-person Magisters' Terrace dungeon at the Sunwell. And last but not least, this update will increase the daily quest limit to 25."}

It's about the &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt; changes in the &lt;a href=\"expansion\"&gt;expansion&lt;/a&gt;. \nArchive.\nHigh Tinker Gelbin Mekkatorque: The Liberation of Gnomeregan.\nGelbin Mekkatorque is known as much for his technical brilliance as he is for his just leadership of the gnomes. In addition to being elected high tinker, the most prominent rank in gnomish society, Gelbin proved himself to be an inventor without equal by leading the construction of the Deeprun Tram, which links Stormwind and Ironforge. Yet all of the high tinker's achievements have been overshadowed by one catastrophic event that occurred under his rule: the fall of Gnomeregan.\nAround the time of the Third War, an ancient menace known as the troggs surfaced in Gnomeregan from the depths of Azeroth. This barbaric race, thought to have been unintentionally released during the Uldaman excavation, crushed the gnomes' defenses and became entrenched in the lower sections of the city. Gelbin, for all his genius, was at a loss for a way to eradicate the savage invaders until his chief advisor, Mekgineer Sicco Thermaplugg, proposed that they inundate Gnomeregan with toxic radiation.\nConfident in Thermaplugg's radical plan, Mekkatorque gave the order to irradiate the city. This bold move worked at first: toxic radiation spread throughout Gnomeregan and momentarily stopped the troggs' incursion. Soon, however, it was evident that the radiation was killing gnomes as well as troggs. In the end, nearly 80 percent of the gnomish race died, and many of those who survived were mutated into deranged leper gnomes. To add to the tragedy, the troggs then resumed their assault on the city.\nMekkatorque and the healthy survivors evacuated Gnomeregan and were taken in by the dwarves of neighboring Ironforge, but Thermaplugg disappeared. The high tinker later learned troubling news that his former advisor had seized control of the toxic gnomish city and instated himself as its twisted overlord. Much to Mekkatorque's shock, he also discovered that Thermaplugg had secretly desired the office of high tinker and might have been previously aware of or even complicit in the trogg invasion.\nThe immense loss of life at Gnomeregan weighed heavy on Mekkatorque's shoulders, and in his fury he ordered the death of Thermaplugg. A band of heroes took up the mission and returned with a tale of victory, but after analyzing the claim, Mekkatorque realized that the mechanized overlord defeated in the depths of the city was likely nothing more than a cleverly engineered facsimile of Thermaplugg.\nAware that defeating his nemesis would require a more robust approach, Mekkatorque labored over strategies to retake his city. His tireless brainstorming recently paid off with the formulation of Operation: Gnomeregan, a brilliant multi-phased assault plan devised to liberate the gnomish capital and bring the real Thermaplugg to justice. With the operation set to begin, resourceful gnomes such as \"Doc\" Cogspin, Captain Tread Sparknozzle, and Drill Sergeant Steamcrank have been overseeing preparations and fine-tuning new technology that will be vital to the offensive.\nMeanwhile, Mekkatorque has begun rounding up all able-bodied gnomes to join in the attack, and his call to arms has also been heard by other members of the Alliance. The gnomes' techno-savvy has been vital in past conflicts, and many Alliance heroes are likely to join the offensive to recapture the extraordinary inventions within the fallen city. For Mekkatorque, however, his plan goes beyond just reacquiring lost technology. The retaking of Gnomeregan will determine his place in history, either as the high tinker who lost the gnomes' beloved capital, or the one who reestablished it as the center of innovation on Azeroth.\nOperation: Gnomeregan is about to get underway.\n\"Operation: Gnomeregan Imminent,\" Says High Tinker Mekkatorque.\nAfter rumors spread throughout Kharanos and Ironforge about Mekgineer Thermaplugg preparing his irradiated soldiers to meet the growing gnomish clamoring for the reclamation of their once-great city, High Tinker Mekkatorque today exclaimed Operation: Gnomeregan to be imminent, describing his former ally Thermaplugg's irradiation of the beloved city as \"a date which will live in a proportionate rate of increase in impropriety!\" Speaking to a small conglomerate of various Alliance representatives, Mekkatorque pointed out that the time to strike is now. After all, Thermaplugg has eluded death for years to keep his reign over Gnomeregan; and with the fall of the Lich King, the last great threat to the citizens of Azeroth, the chance of any cataclysmic event taking place in the foreseeable future is \"less than 12.7%,\" Mekkatorque's leading combat medical advisor Doc Cogspin purported.\nWith confirmation of the impending attack upon Gnomeregan comes your chance to get involved. Victory begins in Tinker Town! As great citizens of Azeroth and proud members of the Alliance, High Tinker Mekkatorque shall call upon you to serve his gnomes in exile. After all, the best offense is a good... offense! Whether you're a hero of your people and slayer of the most dreadful Burning Legion and Scourge creatures, or an up-and-coming adventurer, you can start by motivating your gnome brethren to unite behind the Gnomeregan banner. All it takes is a bit of finesse with the Motivate-a-Tron to call gnomes to action. The device works flawlessly! After all, what good would it be if such a powerful invention ended up turning Tinker Town citizens into little critters? Almost no good!\nWith fresh new recruits at your side, Mekkatorque will send you to Steelgrill's Depot, the staging grounds for the Gnomeregan offensive, where you'll meet Captain Sparknozzle. Do as he commands by completing Drill Sergeant Steamcrank's training and testing the operative capabilities of the brand new Mechano-Tanks before they're shipped to the front lines. Seizing Gnomeregan is more important than your fear of heights, which will be put to the test as you're summoned by Pilot Muzzlesprock to neutralize the irradiation vents bruising the Gnomeregan horizon in a critical Radiageigatron bombing run.\nEvery man, woman, and child is called to serve! Even if you're just barely getting your bearings on the art of combat in places like Kharanos or Elwynn Forest, you can do your part by helping fuel the war effort. A few dead boars leads to a few more comfortable siege pilot seats, and surely you can handle such a crucial step in the preparation for facing Thermaplugg's poisoned followers. You can even help master wordsmith Toby Zeigear in writing High Tinker Mekkatorque's battle cry. The road to success will be paved by you, and you'll be rewarded as such with a commendation of Gnomeregan Pride, allowing you to temporarily don the uniform of the elite Gnomeregan Infantry.\nThermaplugg is no trifling gnome, though his arrogance will be his undoing! Even still, he is undoubtedly preparing never-before-seen forces to meet this assault. Only the most battle-hardened heroes of the Alliance (levels 75-80) will be called to serve during Operation: Gnomeregan. When Mekkatorque determines the operation is ready to get underway, you must speak with him on the front lines before following him on a full assault of the enemy air field, surface command post, and into the tunnels of lower Gnomeregan. It is said that Thermaplugg has employed the use of so-called \"Brag\"-bots to spread his propaganda and hubris. Be not afraid of his words, fellow members of the Alliance. Stick with Mekkatorque and Doc Cogspin to ensure your safety. After all, you wouldn't want to lose the grace of Cogspin's Surgeon General's Warding. Gnomeregan must be cleansed of irradiation and the troggs it was intended to repel. It is time to reclaim this modern marvel and earn your very own Gnomeregan Overcloak, a testament to your historic bravery in the face of madness!\nOperation: Gnomeregan is coming, and the Gnomeregan Exiles want YOU!"}

With the slightest touch of his heel, Arthas was able to convey his directions, and Invincible obeyed without question or hesitation.\nIt was Invincible's unfaltering faith in his master that inevitably led to the stallion's death and unholy rebirth. On a cold winter afternoon as snow was blanketing the ground, Arthas was desperate to get away from the city even if it meant riding through harsh and unforgiving weather. Once outside, Arthas guided Invincible over a familiar jump, but the stallion slipped on slick ice, and the fall shattered his forelegs. With no way to save his companion, Arthas was forced to give Invincible a merciful death, and the prince carried that guilt with him for a very long time.\nYears later, after the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; granted Arthas &lt;a href=\"necromantic\"&gt;necromantic&lt;/a&gt; powers, Arthas returned to the grave where he had buried Invincible and raised his loyal servant into &lt;a href=\"undeath\"&gt;undeath&lt;/a&gt;. It was in this dark act that Arthas felt a sense of purpose. He believed that Invincible's death was not an accident; rather, it was essential to Arthas's destiny.\nInvincible was not bred to be a &lt;a href=\"warhorse\"&gt;warhorse&lt;/a&gt;, but after he was brought back from the dead and made immune to hunger, pain, and exhaustion, he became the perfect steed for Arthas. Now the skeletal charger stalks &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, ever at the ready to serve his beloved master.\nArthas and Invincible were as one until parted by the stallion's untimely death. Now, they are rejoined in death through the power of the Lich King and pose a fearsome sight for all who gaze upon them. Only the power of the heroes of Azeroth can part them once more.\nIn order to attain such a steed, one must conquer Icecrown Citadel and face the Lich King on Heroic difficulty. Perhaps you will be the lucky individual to obtain the most coveted of mounts -- the &lt;a href=\"Invincible%20Charger\"&gt;Invincible Charger&lt;/a&gt;. This reward awaits those who are brave enough to tempt fate and face the full wrath of the Lich King!"}

A rock, hardly worth a second look. But as insignificant as it may seem, this is no ordinary place. A sound of thunder as waves crash endlessly against rocky cliffs; a sound of fury as swords clash on the blood-stained fields of this island on the edge of forever.\nWelcome to the Isle of Conquest.\nThe ongoing struggle between &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; has turned many once peaceful (and some not-so peaceful) places into theaters of constant war. The Isle of Conquest is the latest such place, set to be the location of a battle of epic proportions over the island's precious resources.\nAn Alliance and a Horde general are fighting for dominance, overseeing the action from the safety of their keeps. Whichever side manages to eliminate the enemy general first will triumph on the island; failure to protect your leader will bring shame, dishonor, and defeat. There is no peace accord here, and it's an all-out war between the factions.\nOnce More unto the breach....\nIsle of Conquest, a new battleground scheduled to make its debut in the upcoming content patch, Call of the Crusade, will pitch teams of up to 40 &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;s against each other in a massive battle over this small island off Northrend's northwestern coast. To win, your team will need to make use of the island's unique strategic locations including an oil derrick, a siege workshop, and a fully equipped airship hangar. You will deploy devastating siege weaponry on the field; &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; have mercy on anyone caught between you and your ultimate target, the general holed up in the enemy keep.\nThere are five points of interest on the Isle of Conquest for the factions to battle over. Each one offers its own benefits and strategic value. Which one will you claim for your side, and will it be enough to ensure victory?\nCapture Locations.\nConsider your options before storming out of your keep to confront the enemy head-on. Spread throughout the Isle of Conquest are several capturable locations, each granting a unique strategic advantage to your team.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Oil%20Derrick\"&gt;Oil Derrick&lt;/a&gt;: Located on the northwestern end of the island, this smudge in the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Sea\"&gt;Frozen Sea&lt;/a&gt; produces enough black gold to run a thousand &lt;a href=\"siege%20engine\"&gt;siege engine&lt;/a&gt;s. Taking this resource garners precious reinforcements and a continuous flow of honor to the side that controls it.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Cobalt%20Mine\"&gt;Cobalt Mine&lt;/a&gt;: This assembly, located on the southeastern end of the island, hides untapped supplies that must be harvested. Taking this resource grants reinforcements and a continuous flow of honor to the side that controls it.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Docks%20%28Isle%20of%20Conquest%29\"&gt;Docks&lt;/a&gt;: The western shore's docks will further expand your selection of siege weapons with the devastating new &lt;a href=\"Glaive%20Thrower%20%28Isle%20of%20Conquest%29\"&gt;Glaive Thrower&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Catapult%20%28Isle%20of%20Conquest%29\"&gt;Catapult&lt;/a&gt;. Unleash the destruction of the Glaive Thrower upon the walls of the keep, or launch your invading party over the walls to assault the keep from within.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Airship%20Hangar\"&gt;Airship Hangar&lt;/a&gt;: This sturdy steel structure stands on the peak of Mt. Conquest overlooking the eastern side of the island, allowing players to board the airship docked there. This devastating weapon of war is capable of raining death upon the heads of your enemies and destroying enemy defenses. Once onboard the airship, players will find it comes equipped with parachutes enabling a strike team to drop into the enemy keep from above.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Siege%20Workshop\"&gt;Siege Workshop&lt;/a&gt;: Situated right between the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; base and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; base, this siege workshop occupies a strategic hot spot. Seizing it grants the controlling party the ability to utilize an arsenal of siege vehicles perfectly suited to reducing the enemy keep's walls to dust and ashes.\nGraveyards: There are five graveyards in the Isle of Conquest that are attached to different points of interest on the map: the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Keep\"&gt;Horde base&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Keep\"&gt;Alliance base&lt;/a&gt;, an oil spill island in the center of the map (attached to the siege workshop), the northeast corner (attached to the airship hangar), and the southwest corner (attached to the docks).\nMain Objectives.\nThe Keeps: The Horde and Alliance keeps sit at opposite ends of the island. These citadels host four easily accessible defensive &lt;a href=\"cannon\"&gt;cannon&lt;/a&gt;s set on the ramparts, capable of unleashing hot fury onto oncoming attackers. Additional explosives sit safely stowed in the base of the keep along the back wall. At least, they're safe as long as they don't fall into enemy hands. If they do, though, they can be employed to bring the stone walls down from within.\nThe General: Holed up behind the keeps' massive walls, the generals command their forces from a position of relative safety. Should the keep fall and the general be slain, the Isle of Conquest will fall to the victor.\nReinforcements: Isle of Conquest uses a reinforcements system similar to that of &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Valley\"&gt;Alterac Valley&lt;/a&gt;. The clock is ticking and every individual counts. If too many of your comrades fall to the enemy the battle will end in defeat. Killing enemy players will reduce their reinforcements by one for each kill, Once your faction's reinforcements reach their limit, so too does your bid for control of the island and the wealth of resources you've fought so hard over.\nAn island somewhere off the shores of Northrend. A rock, hardly worth a second look. A test of strength. A chance to prove your might, to crush your enemies, to make a difference, a chance for endless glory and conquest.\nWill you seize it?"}

During the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt; Arthas &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20invasion%20of%20Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;led&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; army into Sylvanas' homeland, &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, in order to use the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;'s powerful &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; as a means to raise the fallen &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"undeath\"&gt;undeath&lt;/a&gt;. As the &lt;a href=\"Ranger-General\"&gt;ranger-general&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;, Sylvanas valiantly fought against the Scourge, but Arthas managed to defeat her in battle. Instead of allowing Sylvanas to die a quick death, however, Arthas ripped the ranger-general's &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt; from her body. He then converted her soul into a &lt;a href=\"banshee\"&gt;banshee&lt;/a&gt; and forced Sylvanas to assist the Scourge as they defiled Quel'Thalas and slaughtered many of the kingdom's inhabitants.\nSylvanas later regained her freedom following &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;'s assault on the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt;. Illidan's attack had widened an existing crack in the throne, thus weakening the Lich King's control over some of the Scourge. Sensing that she was no longer chained to the will of her dark master, Sylvanas reclaimed her body and plotted to avenge her death. She nearly achieved this goal when a group of banshees loyal to Sylvanas led Arthas into an ambush. During the attack Sylvanas paralyzed her nemesis with a poisoned arrow, but &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; intervened and saved Arthas. Following the assassination attempt, Arthas journeyed to &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; and merged with the Lich King. Meanwhile, Sylvanas gathered other renegade &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; \u2015 now known as the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; \u2015 and established the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt; beneath the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;ruins&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20City\"&gt;capital&lt;/a&gt;. With the Forsaken under her command, Sylvanas went to war against the Scourge and eventually joined the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. This partnership benefited both parties: the Forsaken's relatively small forces required assistance in their offensive against the Lich King, and the Horde desired a foothold in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;.\nSylvanas has faced many challenges since attaining freedom from the Lich King. Although they're enemies of the Scourge, the Dark Lady and her subjects are constantly hunted by those who wish to destroy all undead. Even some of the Forsaken have been thorns in her side. Recently Sylvanas dealt with an uprising by a group of &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s and rebel Forsaken led by the &lt;a href=\"dreadlord\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Varimathras\"&gt;Varimathras&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Apothecary%20Putress\"&gt;Grand Apothecary Putress&lt;/a&gt;: during a joint Horde and Alliance &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Angrathar%20the%20Wrathgate\"&gt;attack&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Angrathar%20the%20Wrathgate\"&gt;Wrath Gate&lt;/a&gt; in Northrend, Putress unleashed a &lt;a href=\"new%20plague\"&gt;new plague&lt;/a&gt; that killed friend and foe alike, and Varimathras and his loyalists seized the Undercity. Sylvanas defeated her enemies and retook the Undercity soon afterward, a victory that was possible only due to assistance from the Horde. Yet some of the Dark Lady's allies believe that she was complicit in the treacherous Wrath Gate incident.\nDespite these setbacks and distractions, Sylvanas remains focused on her end goal: revenge. Now that the Forsaken and the Horde have begun their assault on the Lich King's fortress, Sylvanas believes that her destiny is close at hand.\nAbilities.\nAlthough Sylvanas has reclaimed her undead &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elven&lt;/a&gt; body, she still retains the ability to shift in and out of her incorporeal banshee form at will. Sylvanas is also skilled at &lt;a href=\"archer\"&gt;archer&lt;/a&gt;y, an art she mastered as a high elf. To this day the bow remains Sylvanas' weapon of choice.\nLady Jaina Proudmoore.\nAs a young apprentice of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;, Jaina Proudmoore was heralded as a prodigy. Her mentor, the venerable &lt;a href=\"archmage\"&gt;archmage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Antonidas\"&gt;Antonidas&lt;/a&gt;, believed that the gifted &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer\"&gt;sorceress&lt;/a&gt; would one day assume his mantle as the Kirin Tor's leader. Although Jaina was devoted to her rigorous studies of the &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt;, she found herself in a romantic relationship with her childhood friend Prince Arthas Menethil, son of &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;King Terenas II&lt;/a&gt;. Jaina and Arthas had strong feelings for each other, but they eventually parted ways to pursue their separate callings. Arthas was busy with his duties both as a &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; and as the heir to Lordaeron's throne, while Jaina was well on her way to becoming one of Azeroth's most powerful &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;magi&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"plague%20of%20undeath\"&gt;plague of undeath&lt;/a&gt; began ravaging Lordaeron, Jaina and Arthas were side by side once again. The talented sorceress worked with the prince to uncover the sinister plague's origins, and in the process she witnessed Arthas' unsuccessful attempts to stop the spread of undeath. Jaina was with Arthas at the outskirts of &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt; when he made his terrible decision to &lt;a href=\"Culling%20of%20Stratholme\"&gt;cull&lt;/a&gt; the plague-infected city. Jaina, however, played no part in that murderous act. When the fall of Lordaeron to the Scourge seemed inevitable, Jaina led a &lt;a href=\"Human%20Expedition\"&gt;group of Alliance survivors&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; in order to combat the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. There Jaina's forces helped banish the Legion from Azeroth with the aid of the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s and the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;. This temporary alliance was made possible by &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;the Prophet&lt;/a&gt;, a mysterious being who worked to unite the humans and the orcs against the Legion. Following the Legion's defeat, Jaina founded the stalwart port city of &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt; on Kalimdor's rugged eastern coast. She also maintained peace between her forces and the orcs with the help of Thrall. Due to Jaina's tireless work, Theramore remains a bastion of the Alliance in Kalimdor to this day.\nCurrently the Horde and the Alliance are engaged in an &lt;a href=\"War%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;all-out war in Northrend against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, who had earlier merged with Arthas to become one being. The offensive is gaining momentum, and Jaina occasionally attempts to act as a mediator between the Horde and Alliance factions. Most recently she tried to quell a fiery encounter between King &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; when they were discussing the ominous discovery of an &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt; under the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; city of &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt;. Maintaining peace between the headstrong leaders of these two factions is not easy, but Jaina is dedicated to focusing their energies on defeating the Lich King. For Jaina this imperative is more than just her duty to defend her people: it is personal. Perhaps in her heart she believes that the Arthas she knew from her past still exists somewhere deep inside the Lich King, awaiting freedom.\nAbilities.\nAs one of Azeroth's most gifted magi, Jaina commands an array of potent spells. These spells grant her the ability to &lt;a href=\"Teleportation\"&gt;teleport&lt;/a&gt;, summon &lt;a href=\"water%20elemental\"&gt;water elemental&lt;/a&gt;s, and unleash frigid &lt;a href=\"blizzard\"&gt;blizzard&lt;/a&gt;s upon her enemies. The true extent of Jaina's powers, however, goes far beyond the examples listed here.\nReferences.\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//web.archive.org/web/20091107205920/http%3A//www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/underdev/3p3/characters.xml\"&gt;Archive Link&lt;/a&gt; (Broken XML)"}

One such exchange seemed to revolve around an unfamiliar Zandalari word, always surrounded by terms of conquest and power: Oondasta. Somewhere in &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Beast%20Ward\"&gt;Zandalari Beast Ward&lt;/a&gt; raises their mighty beasts as engines of war, and is putting the finishing touches on this &lt;a href=\"Loa\"&gt;Loa&lt;/a&gt;-infused monstrosity.

Ragnaros's lair--&lt;a href=\"Sulfuron%20Keep\"&gt;Sulfuron Keep&lt;/a&gt;--is closely guarded by his most loyal servants, including the traitorous &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Flame\"&gt;Druids of the Flame&lt;/a&gt; and their mysterious leader. Yet the brave heroes who have ventured into this ash-choked domain cannot afford to shy away from any danger. The outcome of the battles that lie ahead will determine the very survival of Azeroth.\n&lt;a href=\"WoW%20Blog/The%20Firelands\"&gt;Learn More&lt;/a&gt;\nDragonwrath, Tarecgosa's Rest.\nUncertainty looms over the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;'s domain, the &lt;a href=\"Nexus\"&gt;Nexus&lt;/a&gt;, as its members struggle to appoint a new leader. Split between the two likeliest successors--&lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arygos\"&gt;Arygos&lt;/a&gt;--the flight has agreed to meet during a rare celestial event known as the &lt;a href=\"Embrace\"&gt;Embrace&lt;/a&gt; in the hopes that a new Aspect will finally be chosen. The &lt;a href=\"bronze%20dragon\"&gt;bronze dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Anachronos\"&gt;Anachronos&lt;/a&gt;, however, has detected something sinister at work around the Nexus, threatening to compromise the ceremony. If a hero does not rise to investigate these dark forces and uncover their intentions, Anachronos believes that Azeroth's doom is imminent.\n&lt;a href=\"WoW%20Blog/Dragonwrath%2C%20Tarecgosa%27s%20Rest\"&gt;Learn More&lt;/a&gt;\nThe Regrowth and Molten Front.\nAlthough the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; and their allies repelled Ragnaros's initial invasion of Hyjal, their work on the sacred mount is far from over. &lt;a href=\"Archdruid\"&gt;Archdruid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; has gathered his comrades at the &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary%20of%20Malorne\"&gt;Sanctuary of Malorne&lt;/a&gt; within the newly healed &lt;a href=\"The%20Regrowth\"&gt;Regrowth&lt;/a&gt; to invade Ragnaros's domain: the Firelands. Once inside the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Plane\"&gt;Elemental Plane&lt;/a&gt;, Hyjal's defenders hope to establish a permanent stronghold. Yet these plans have come under threat by a ferocious new elemental assault that has swept through the Regrowth. Despite this setback, Hyjal's protectors remain steadfast in their mission, for they know that it is in the molten heart of the Firelands that the fate of Mount Hyjal will be decided.\n&lt;a href=\"WoW%20Blog/The%20Regrowth%20and%20Molten%20Front\"&gt;Learn More&lt;/a&gt;\nElemental Bonds.\nWhat was to be an auspicious event at the ancient World Tree Nordrassil has ended in tragedy. There, members of the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt;, including former &lt;a href=\"warchief\"&gt;warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, had gathered with the noble &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt; to unite their powers and restore &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt; for the good of Azeroth. Yet word has now spread that a shadowy &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; agent interrupted the ceremony and struck down Thrall with dark magics... casting his spirit into the four domains of the Elemental Plane. If these terrible rumors hold true, the Earthen Ring--indeed, all of Azeroth--has lost one of its greatest champions.\n&lt;a href=\"WoW%20Blog/Elemental%20Bonds\"&gt;Learn More&lt;/a&gt;"}

Finding and claiming the blade among the frozen wastes of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; was an odyssey unto itself, and the search cost the prince &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;his mentor&lt;/a&gt;, his relationship with his subjects, and his &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;ity. It cost the living of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; far more.\nWith a tight grip on the blade that he traded his life for, Arthas ravaged the kingdom of Lordaeron and broke free from the control of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. By the time the former prince ascended as the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, Frostmourne was already glutted with the &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;s of the numberless dead who dared to oppose him. \nNow, Arthas has become so inseparable from his weapon that the sword's likeness has even found its way into the architecture of his fortress, &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt;. Its hilt is never far from his hands; its &lt;a href=\"ghost\"&gt;ghost&lt;/a&gt;ly whispers constantly ring in his ears. Frostmourne, as much as the Lich King, is the ruler of Northrend.\nTo challenge that rule, mighty heroes will need to follow more closely in Arthas's path than ever before.\nIn a relentless quest to arm the forces of the living against the Scourge, &lt;a href=\"Darion%20Mograine\"&gt;Darion Mograine&lt;/a&gt; has formed the &lt;a href=\"Ashen%20Verdict\"&gt;Ashen Verdict&lt;/a&gt;, a union between the most skilled craftsmen of the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt;. Though the peerless &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s of the Crusade wield the power of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;, and their leader clutches &lt;a href=\"Ashbringer\"&gt;Ashbringer&lt;/a&gt;, a few of Mograine's dark warriors have begun to question their hopes for victory.\nThese &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s insist that the Ashbringer and the skills of the Argent Crusaders, though potent, aren't enough to best Frostmourne alone. They swear that Darion Mograine has long been quietly aware of another legendary blade - one that could be the key to defeating the Lich King and cleansing Northrend... But it doesn't exist yet.\nFor the moment, the weapon is a formless idea, with no more killing power than an angry thought. When it is spoken of, it is spoken of quietly, and the Highlord has a habit of silencing those who discuss it in public.\nBut the hope of an artifact to rival Frostmourne is strong within the minds of the Ebon Blade. Just its name inspires the furnaces to burn late into the night, the bellows to pump air, and the darker half of the Verdict's smiths to swing their hammers until their fingers fail. While other crafting experts lean over whetstones and gather pitted blades by the hundreds, these few dream of a single weapon to end the war for Northrend.\nShadowmourne... A great two-handed &lt;a href=\"axe\"&gt;axe&lt;/a&gt; fit for a &lt;a href=\"giant\"&gt;giant&lt;/a&gt;, born of sacred and corrupt powers, host of a thousand dead souls and able to be wielded only by the most stalwart armsmasters of Azeroth. Its creation seems nearly impossible; and yet, the rumors do not cease.\nSome &lt;a href=\"smith\"&gt;smith&lt;/a&gt;s claim that Shadowmourne must be nothing more than an ordinary axe, honed to unparalleled perfection, while others would shape it from a weapon of immense import in the world. Mograine, when he can be convinced to speak of it at all, is said to believe that only the hammer of Arthas himself will provide a worthy model - but such absurd ambition is just the beginning of Shadowmourne's creation.\nOnly with these mighty components, it's said, can Shadowmourne be finished. And, yet, even if the axe could be completed, questions and fears remain. Is forging the souls of the deceased into a weapon treated with blood and the essence of the Twisting Nether truly any different from the crafting of the Scourge's runeblades?\nWho is to say that the Lich King wouldn't simply annihilate - or control - the maker for their impudence in mimicking his most treasured possession? If Arthas, one of the most dedicated knights of his age, lost his humanity to the whispers of Frostmourne, might Shadowmourne bring the same doom and misery to the living as its sister blade?\nWithout knowing the answers to these questions, who would be bold enough to try and wield it?"}

With the power of a primordial world-twisting force at his command, Garrosh can rebuild the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; in his image: strong, obedient, and, most importantly, \u2018pure'.\n&lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt;'s attempts to lead Horde &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Rebellion\"&gt;rebels&lt;/a&gt; into the capital of &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; haven't gone unnoticed \u2013 and the mightiest heroes of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; have stepped in to siege one of their enemies' most prized cities. Will the Alliance be content with overthrowing a despot, or will they crush the Horde at one of the most vulnerable points in its history?\nWorld.\nNew Zone: The Timeless Isle.\nA true enigma, the &lt;a href=\"Timeless%20Isle\"&gt;Timeless Isle&lt;/a&gt; has drifted in and out of Pandaria's &lt;a href=\"Mists%20of%20Pandaria%20%28lore%29\"&gt;mists&lt;/a&gt; for thousands of years. Here, &lt;a href=\"time\"&gt;time&lt;/a&gt; has no meaning, and the sun neither rises nor sets. Its unique characteristics have brought the Isle under the scrutiny of the &lt;a href=\"bronze%20dragonflight\"&gt;bronze dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; explorers, and the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragon\"&gt;black dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Timeless Isle is a Max-level PvE zone located to the east of the &lt;a href=\"Jade%20Forest\"&gt;Jade Forest&lt;/a&gt;. Seek the Isle alone or in a group to collect &lt;a href=\"Timeless%20Coin\"&gt;Timeless Coin&lt;/a&gt;s (which will allow you to purchase unique gear from the locals) or to do battle with massive creatures and dangerous &lt;a href=\"world%20boss\"&gt;world boss&lt;/a&gt;es. Among the latter are &lt;a href=\"Ordos\"&gt;Ordos&lt;/a&gt;, the lost &lt;a href=\"Yaungol\"&gt;Yaungol&lt;/a&gt; fire god; and the four &lt;a href=\"August%20Celestials\"&gt;August Celestials&lt;/a&gt;, who stand ready to test the mettle of &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s taking part in Wrathion's legendary quest.\nThere are no traditional quest-givers advising you on the Timeless Isle; you can simply throw yourself into the experience, collecting coins and reacting to the dynamic events, bosses, and puzzles that emerge from the depths of the isle's unexplored interior...\nQuests and Lore.\nLegendary Quest: Judgment of the Black Prince.\nThe black dragon Wrathion is eager to explore the secrets of the Timeless Isle, and with good reason: the island holds the secret of imbuing celestial cloaks with his own formidable draconic power. Bearers of this new legendary-quality cloak will be able to do battle with the deadly world boss Ordos atop the Timeless Isle, but that isn't Wrathion's ultimate goal. Instead, the black prince hopes to send his empowered cloak-bearers into the bowels of Orgrimmar to overthrow the Warchief himself.\nPlayer vs. Environment.\nNew Raid: The Siege of Orgrimmar.\nThe tyrant must topple. The &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; is a 4-wing, 14-boss raid for max-level players, which will call you to take down Warchief Garrosh Hellscream at the head of a host of Azeroth's finest. You'll battle from the devastated Vale of Eternal Blossoms and through a full-blown siege of the mighty gates of Orgrimmar, ultimately raiding Garrosh's lair in the smoldering depths of Ragefire Chasm. \nNew Raid Mode: Flexible.\n&lt;a href=\"Flexible%20Raid\"&gt;Flexible raiding&lt;/a&gt; is a new raid option allowing you to be part of a massive, tactically challenging raid without having to worry about your party size. When you choose to do a flexible raid in a group sized anywhere from 10-25 people, the difficulty of your raid will automatically adjust to allow you an appropriately challenging experience regardless of how many people are in your group. In terms of overall difficulty, flexible raids are between raid finder and normal difficulty, and have no item level or role requirements.\nThe Proving Grounds.\nIn Patch 5.4, it's easier than ever to learn a new role or perfect your current playstyle. Speak to your class trainer (or &lt;a href=\"Trial%20Master%20Rotun\"&gt;Trial Master Rotun&lt;/a&gt; inside the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20White%20Tiger\"&gt;Temple of the White Tiger&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Kun-Lai%20Summit\"&gt;Kun-Lai Summit&lt;/a&gt;) to head to the proving grounds, where you can undertake solo trials to practice your class role (&lt;a href=\"Tank\"&gt;Tank&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Healer\"&gt;Healer&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Damage\"&gt;Damage&lt;/a&gt;). Each trial is available in multiple difficulties \u2013 Bronze through Gold and the challenging \u2018Endless' mode, an opportunity to hold out against enemies as long as you can. Your scores and times are recorded, so you can see how you stack up against your friends and guildmates.\nAnd More!\nThe Celestial Tournament.\nThe Celestials hold a &lt;a href=\"Celestial%20Tournament\"&gt;weekly tournament&lt;/a&gt; on the Timeless Isle to test the leadership skills of would-be pet-masters and their followers. To win the tournament, you must defeat three legendary tamers and the four children of the Celestials themselves, in succession, without healing or reviving your battle pets. Victory will allow you to befriend the Celestial progeny you best in battle, and they'll join you as pets!"}

It was a preview for the revamp of &lt;a href=\"Silithus%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"patch%201.8.0\"&gt;patch 1.8.0&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe original article, formerly located at http://www.wow-europe.com/en/info/underdev/1p8/silithus/silithus-intro.html and http://wow-europe.com/en/info/underdev/1p8/silithus/silithus-map.html, did not survive the overhaul of the World of Warcraft Official Website.\nArticle.\nIntroduction.\nI stood poised over the body of the prone &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"cultist\"&gt;cultist&lt;/a&gt;, straining for any sound of discovery. After weeks in the desert, the unceasing drone of insect wings from the various hives was almost shut out - it remained just noticeable enough to make my brain itch. I peered slowly around the corner of the crystal, making a quick check on the base camp just down the hill. There were no signs of pursuit. The patrols continued on their way, eyes scanning the dunes for the slightest sign of opposition as they guarded the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Stonecaller\"&gt;stonecallers&lt;/a&gt; while they chanted their incomprehensible incantations around those clusters of floating rock.\nAt least no one had heard the short scuffle. I leaned against the crystal that provided my only cover, feeling its warmth through my cloak, and breathed a soft sigh of relief. This entire expedition had been nothing but strange from the very beginning, and my latest task had my nerves on edge.\nI kneeled and busied my hands by checking the &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;'s coinpurse, dwelling on recent events. The &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; had requested my presence in &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt; weeks ago, and, as a dutiful &lt;a href=\"Druid\"&gt;Druid&lt;/a&gt;, I'd heeded the call, riding my trusty &lt;a href=\"kodo\"&gt;kodo&lt;/a&gt; down to the shifting sands in southeast &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. I was an experienced &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;, after all; surely I'd be able to handle whatever this sand pit could throw at me!\nIt was no secret that the Druids held concerns about the presence of the &lt;a href=\"Silithid\"&gt;Silithid&lt;/a&gt;, alien creatures slowly invading the continent, and I shared them. They were... unnatural, somehow, a blight upon &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. If I could do anything to get to the bottom of their existence here, I would, and that meant coming to this dusty, arid hole.\nOne thing led to another, as it always did, and now I found myself working against the Twilight's Hammer. My eyes drifted over the Orc's vestments - they held the familiar dark purple of similar cultists when I'd encountered them before in &lt;a href=\"Blackfathom%20Deeps\"&gt;Blackfathom&lt;/a&gt; and the prisons of &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Depths\"&gt;Blackrock Depths&lt;/a&gt;. The zealot's light had long left this particular fanatic's eyes, but his expression still held the fervor of one willing to die for his insane cause. I shuddered inwardly. If even half of what I'd heard about their goals was true, stopping them was more important now than ever before.\nI'd nearly left this all when I heard my current task. The plan was ludicrous, and I desperately wanted to be flying back to &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt;, leaving this insanity behind. But to do that would be turning my back on the order I swore to follow; I'd never forgive myself. Gritting my teeth, I started picking at the knot holding the Orc's cowl on his head with my thick fingers, gently working it loose. Though it was tied tightly, the cloth yielded to persistent pressure, and it came free. Making as little noise as possible, I removed his mantle and robe, and then began removing my own chestpiece. I squeezed into the robe, trying not to breathe - while the cultist was large for his race, he was still no match for a Mulgore-bred Druid like myself. I tied the mantle in place and put on the cowl, working the fabric around my horns.\n\"This is crazy,\" I muttered under my breath. \"I'm going to get killed.\" \nOnce again I peeked around the crystal discreetly. Despite my disguise, they would surely recognize a stranger, particularly a large, hulking, horned one. I'd need to avoid their patrols if at all possible. I closed my eyes. The image of a familiar form - sleek, horned, and furred - came into focus. My form melted, muscle and bone molding into a new shape, one that specialized in avoiding notice.\nI slunk around the crystal, waiting for my chance. The patrol passed; it was a simple matter to slip in step behind the hammer-wielding &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;. My careful paws worked through the maze of zealots - my goal was deep in the camp, and a single misstep would bring agonizing failure. Carefully I crept around the strange blue firelight they tended. At last, the pedestal - and the object I sought - lay before me. I only hoped I was far enough away that they would think me one of their own. As quickly as I could manage, I shifted back, my disguise thankfully still intact.\nThe stone lay before me, a miniature obelisk floating over its pedestal. There was nothing for it. To delay further would bring about discovery and death. I shut my eyes and placed my hands on the wind stone.\nSearing fire lanced through my brain...\nWelcome to Silithus.\nAncient forces stir in the heart of the Silithus desert - forces that have not been seen or felt for thousands of years. When the next content patch releases, adventurers will take note of a foulness that has seeped into the land of Silithus. This zone has been overhauled and is now major quest hub with episodic storylines that will send adventurers into its depths and past its borders. The redesign of this zone includes high-end outdoor quest areas for solo players, 5-man groups and mini-raids. Silithus is loaded with repeatable quests and bosses, providing a more casual alternative to dungeon raiding. Will you uncover the secrets of Silithus?\nInteractive map.\nSince the beginning of recorded history, &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; has seen the most terrible conflicts imaginable. The &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Sundering&lt;/a&gt; of the World. The coming of the Tides of Darkness. The return of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; and the rise of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;. Yet all this time, deep beneath the shifting sands of &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;, an unspeakable horror has been lying in wait, ever patient, ever enduring. Mortal hands are at work awakening an ancient menace that, once set lose, will shake the very foundations of this world. Evil is stirring where mortals were never meant to tread. The world is waiting for a champion to step forward and stop the coming darkness before it is too late.\nThe time has finally come for the hero to assume the role fate has bestowed upon him.\nValor's Rest.\nSome say that in the harsh wasteland of Silithus, an ancient war was waged between the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;Night Elves&lt;/a&gt; and a malign, alien power. Along the northern road leading to Silithus lies &lt;a href=\"Valor%27s%20Rest\"&gt;Valor's Rest&lt;/a&gt;, the final resting place for the fallen of the wastes.\nIt is there that many travelers will catch their first glimpse of the wastes... and Valor's Rest has seen many brave souls turn their mount around and retreat to the relative safety of &lt;a href=\"Un%27Goro%20Crater\"&gt;Un'Goro crater&lt;/a&gt;. Few are those who are strong enough to brave the wastes and unlock the secrets of the shifting sands.\nSilithid Hives.\nSilithus is the home of a species of &lt;a href=\"insectoid\"&gt;insectoid&lt;/a&gt;s named after the region, the voracious Silithid. These remarkable creatures build enormous hives where they hatch their offspring. These hives and the worker drones which constantly expand them are guarded aggressively by several kinds of fighting Silithid. There are airborne, wasplike Silithid that inject their victims with powerful toxins and gigantic hulking Silithid that command swarms of smaller bugs which can penetrate the armor of any intruder in seconds. \nSince the Silithid are not only fierce but also numerous, it is best not to go to their hellish hives alone. \nThe Crystal Vale.\nIn the northwest lies the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Vale\"&gt;Crystal Vale&lt;/a&gt;. Scattered throughout the vale are the remnants of what appears to have been a rather recent settlement, but the ultimate fate of those who set foot here is still unknown. Now, &lt;a href=\"unbound%20elemental\"&gt;unbound elemental&lt;/a&gt;s of air and earth roam the area and attack on sight any who seek to unravel the mystery of the Crystal Vale.\nTwilight's Hammer.\nNot long ago, several groups of cultists all belonging to the Twilight's Hammer established a number of bases in Silithus. Although it is unclear what the cult is doing in Silithus, the presence of so many of its followers is a clear sign that they are planning something big.\nThe cultists must be stopped before their evil scheme (whatever it may be) succeeds. Their camps are spread throughout the region; thinning their numbers should be one of the first items on the to-do list of all newly arrived adventurers. \nCenarion Hold.\nCenarion Hold is a location of utmost strategic importance in Silithus. The Cenarion Circle has taken over the duty of defending the ancient Night Elven settlement against the increasingly hostile and aggressive Silithid and other forces that have set foot in this troubled region recently.\nThe town can be reached either by &lt;a href=\"Gryphon\"&gt;Gryphon&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Wyvern\"&gt;Wyvern&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Gadgetzan\"&gt;Gadgetzan&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Vendor\"&gt;merchants&lt;/a&gt; of Cenarion Hold gladly sell their goods to any adventurer who passes through, since business is hard to come by in these trying times. \nSouthind Village.\n&lt;a href=\"Southwind%20Village\"&gt;Southwind Village&lt;/a&gt; was once a Night Elven base of operations in Silithus, but it has long since been overrun by the relentless Silithid that infest large parts of this region. The horror of the village's initial sundering still echoes through time - the tortured spirits of fallen &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"sentinels\"&gt;sentinels&lt;/a&gt; wander the ruins aimlessly.\nThe Cenarion Circle, whose members are defending the nearby Cenarion Hold, would surely be grateful to anyone who dared venture into the haunted village and free the souls of the fallen Night Elves.\nDwarven Expedition.\nThe famous explorer &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; has led a &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarven&lt;/a&gt; expedition all the way to the southernmost part of Silithus. The dwarves have established a base camp near the &lt;a href=\"Scarab%20Wall\"&gt;Scarab Wall&lt;/a&gt; in order to study the relics that can be found all over Silithus and to unlock the secrets of the past which still lie buried underneath the hot desert sands.\nAdventurers seeking to aid the dwarves in their undertaking just need to follow the road south from Cenarion Hold. The dwarves will surely appreciate any help they can get.\nThe Scarab Wall.\nBeyond Bronzebeard's encampment stands a structure of truly cyclopean proportions, called the Scarab Wall by those who have made Silithus their home. The origins and the purpose of this wall have been long forgotten in time; there are only a few left who saw the day when it was built, and those who do know of its use prefer not to speak of it.\nPerhaps it was a testament to the might of those who used to rule over the wastes, perhaps it was built to keep out those who wished to venture farther south and into the lands of ancient &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt;. Or perhaps its purpose is to keep whatever lingers beyond the Scarab Wall sealed beneath the cold of stone... forever. "}

It's about the &lt;a href=\"Crusaders%27%20Coliseum\"&gt;Crusaders' Coliseum&lt;/a&gt; dungeons implemented in the game.\nThe original article, formerly located at http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/underdev/3p2/coliseum.xml, did not survive the overhaul of the World of Warcraft Official Website.\nArticle.\nThe Crusaders' Coliseum.\nThe time to strike at the heart of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; is drawing close. Clouds blanket the skies of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and heroes gather beneath battle-worn &lt;a href=\"banner\"&gt;banner&lt;/a&gt;s in preparation for the coming storm. They say that even the darkest cloud has a silver lining. It is this hope that drives the men and women of the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt;: hope that the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; will see them through these trying times, hope that good will triumph over evil, hope that a hero blessed by the Light will come forth to put an end to the Lich King's dark reign.\nSo the Argent Crusade has sent out the call, a call to arms for all heroes far and wide, to meet at the very doorstep of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;'s domain and to prove their might in a tournament the likes of which Azeroth has never seen. Of course, a tournament such as this needs a fitting stage. A place where potential candidates are tested to the limits of exhaustion. A place where heroes... become champions. A place called the Crusaders' Coliseum.\nProve Your Might.\nThe Crusaders' Coliseum, a new raid set to open its doors once World of Warcraft's next content patch is released, will see you and your friends facing off against a series of increasingly challenging bosses, terrible monsters the Argent Crusade brought in from all over &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. Although the challenge is great, you will find that the prizes the Argent Crusade has to offer will make it all well worth your while.\nThe setup for the Crusaders' Coliseum is surprisingly straightforward. If you are familiar with the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Blood\"&gt;Ring of Blood&lt;/a&gt; quest line, you already have a vague idea of how the Crusaders' Coliseum plays out in principle. After you and your friends enter the coliseum, you will face the first of several bosses; once you've defeated a boss, you will move on to the next one. You must master the encounters one by one, until you finally face the raid's final challenge. Sound simple? That's because there is a twist.\nIn the \"Heroic\" version of the Crusaders' Coliseum, you and your raid only have a limited number of attempts for each raid lockout period, and each time your raid wipes, one of your attempts will be used up. To embark on the epic Trial of the Grand Crusader, you must first prove your worth by clearing either the 10 or 25 player version of the Crusaders' Coliseum's normal mode. After you have dealt the killing blow to the coliseum's final heroic mode boss will you be able to collect the Crusaders' Tribute, and the fewer attempts you needed to complete the Trial of the Grand Crusader, the better your reward will be. \nMeet (some of) the Bosses.\nBeasts: Your first challenge will pit you against a group of terrifying beasts the Argent Crusade captured in Northrend, including (but not limited to) a &lt;a href=\"magnataur\"&gt;magnataur&lt;/a&gt; and not one, but two &lt;a href=\"jormungar\"&gt;jormungar&lt;/a&gt; wyrms.\nScourge: Some call the &lt;a href=\"lieutenant\"&gt;lieutenant&lt;/a&gt;s of the Lich King fearsome creatures made of pure nightmare, which is doubtlessly a fitting description. How the Argent Crusade managed to capture these fiends remains a mystery; what's less mystifying is your fate should you fail to overcome this challenge. "}

It's about the &lt;a href=\"Patch%202.3.0\"&gt;The Gods of Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt; implemented in the game.\nThe original article, formerly located at http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/underdev/implemented/2p3.html, did not survive the overhaul of the World of Warcraft Official Website.\nArticle.\nThe latest major content patch for World of Warcraft, The Gods of Zul'Aman, adds an impressive array of new challenges, features, changes, and rewards to World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade.\n&lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt; is a 10-person raid dungeon located in the &lt;a href=\"Ghostlands\"&gt;Ghostlands&lt;/a&gt;, with enemies and spoils that pick up where &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt; leaves off. This outdoor raid dungeon is home to the vicious &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;forest troll&lt;/a&gt;s and their leader, the infamous &lt;a href=\"Zul%27jin\"&gt;Zul'jin&lt;/a&gt;. You and your band of heroes will battle the dungeon's six bosses, including four avatars of Zul'Aman, each bearing the aspect of a different ferocious creature. Zul'Aman also features a challenging bonus reward structure based on completing certain objectives within a time limit, which provides an extra level of challenge \u2013 and thrills \u2013 for seasoned raid groups.\nThe other defining characteristic of The Gods of Zul'Aman is the bounty of rewards, both material and intangible, that it offers many types of players. The powerful epic items found in Zul'Aman are just the beginning. There is a host of new purchasable rewards as well, from the gladiator rewards of Arena Season 3, to the dozens of new Badge of Justice rewards and the full set of new Honor rewards. There are also more useful and fun items such as the new Flying Machine flying mounts, which can be built and operated by skilled engineers. Among the more abstract benefits to players are faster leveling to 60, the revamping of &lt;a href=\"Dustwallow%20Marsh\"&gt;Dustwallow Marsh&lt;/a&gt; with new quests, new daily quests for dungeons and battlegrounds, and many class balance changes. This is just a sampling of the bounty that awaits in The Gods of Zul'Aman.\nVengeance for Zul'jin.\nBanished from &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; long ago for their use of &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;, the forebears of the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; sailed to the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; and made landfall on the shores of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. As the elves headed farther inland, they were drawn to the verdant woods of the north, which resembled the elves' former homeland. The native forest trolls of the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20empire\"&gt;Amani empire&lt;/a&gt; fought the elves' advance to no avail. Unable to overcome the elves' arcane magic, the Amani were driven south, and the triumphant elves founded their &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;kingdom of Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; on land that had belonged to the Amani for millennia.\nThe embittered trolls regrouped and assembled a massive army. Roughly four thousand years after their defeat in the &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Wars\"&gt;Troll Wars&lt;/a&gt;, they unleashed a furious assault on &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, determined to reclaim their ancestral lands. The high elves' magics were no match for such overwhelming numbers. In desperation, the elves allied with the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; nation of &lt;a href=\"Arathor\"&gt;Arathor&lt;/a&gt; and turned the tide of battle, decimating the troll warbands. Over two thousand years later, the trolls began to rise up again, their once-scattered &lt;a href=\"tribe\"&gt;tribe&lt;/a&gt;s uniting under the cunning warlord &lt;a href=\"Zul%27jin\"&gt;Zul'jin&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; offered the forest trolls a place in the Horde. At that time Zul'jin refused, for he felt that his people needed no assistance in battling the elves. He only agreed to join the Horde's ranks when the orcs proved their worth by rescuing a group of trolls shortly before the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; began. Yet Zul'jin grew furious when Warchief &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; not only failed to destroy Quel'Thalas, but also abandoned the siege against the high elves in favor of an attack on &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. The forest trolls stayed behind and kept fighting. Zul'jin slaughtered countless elves, but even so, he was captured. Chained to a crumbling pillar, he endured hours of torture that cost him his right eye. When his captors were attacked by a small troll warband, the resourceful Zul'jin capitalized on the opportunity, using a fallen spear to cut off his own arm and secure his freedom. Returning home, he began rebuilding his army, and even as he remained behind Zul'Aman's walls, his legend grew.\nYears later, as the trolls slowly recovered from their devastating defeat, Zul'jin learned that the high elves had nearly been annihilated by the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. He planned a final campaign to end the bloodline of the elves permanently, but soon thereafter many of his mortal enemies (now calling themselves &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;) joined the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Furious at the Horde's latest betrayal, Zul'jin was pleased when the &lt;a href=\"witch%20doctor\"&gt;witch doctor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Malacrass\"&gt;Malacrass&lt;/a&gt; approached him with a devious plan to crush the elves once and for all. Malacrass had studied the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"high%20priest\"&gt;high priest&lt;/a&gt;s and their ability to call upon the favor of the &lt;a href=\"Loa\"&gt;animal gods&lt;/a&gt;. He also knew that the elves had magically bound one of the mighty &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt;, using it to channel the power of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; into their own ranks. Malacrass had devised a similar plan: to seal the power of the animal gods within the bodies of the Amani's strongest warriors. Zul'jin quickly approved the plan and lent his full support. Malacrass experimented tirelessly and succeeded in imbuing four warriors with the essence of mighty animal gods: the lynx, dragonhawk, bear, and eagle. Some adventurers fear that Malacrass may have bound a fifth, even darker essence within his own soul...\nMany treasure hunters still seek out the legendary relics of the forest troll empire inside Zul'Aman, ignoring the danger of Zul'jin's return. As more would-be heroes disappear, the warlord's loyal army grows ever stronger from the sacrificial pyres burning within the walls of the city.\nSoon the time for Zul'jin's vengeance will come."}

How do you convey the significance of these places and the events that took place there in design?\nCory: History was a large factor in the design of Icecrown Citadel from the very beginning. When we first sat down to discuss the layout of the raid itself, we immediately went back to to think about how the spire from the ending cinematic could be translated into &lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;. We decided to actually build Icecrown Citadel around the original spire to pull players even more into the storyline. This kind of thinking carried on throughout the entire design process.\nGreg: We want Icecrown to be an epic experience from top to bottom, and that includes the &lt;a href=\"loot\"&gt;loot&lt;/a&gt; you get. We're not going to shower players in items -- well, more than we already do -- but we do want to make sure the items are sufficiently powerful so that they're upgrades for all of our players.\nIs there an existing model in World of Warcraft for Icecrown Citadel's itemization or style of play? What lessons that you'd learned from earlier projects wound up being applied to Icecrown Citadel?\nGreg: The nice thing about Icecrown Citadel from an itemization perspective is that we have lots of bosses. That's something of a relief coming from the &lt;a href=\"Crusaders%27%20Coliseum\"&gt;Crusaders' Coliseum&lt;/a&gt;, where we had only five &lt;a href=\"boss\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt;es. For Icecrown, we can afford to have multiple options for a particular slot -- say a healing leather bracer or a melee trinket -- and even itemize some of the more unusual pieces. We have a pretty effective system for figuring out who is going to drop what to make sure that an individual boss will be interesting to a variety of players in terms of loot. Most of our lessons learned are in the realm of what differences there should be between 10- and 25-player itemization, the role of tradeskill recipes, and what kinds of items to place with badge vendors.\nCory: I think we learn lessons from every raid that we do. We didn't model Icecrown specifically after any of our previous raids, but you can definitely see influences. For example, we have a winged structure in Icecrown that players will remember from &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt;. Another example of an influence would be the teleporters from &lt;a href=\"Ulduar%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt;. We know that players really loved that concept, so we brought it back in Icecrown.\nCan you talk a little about how artists and designers on the team collaborated on the creation of Icecrown Citadel?\nCory: The design and art teams worked extremely closely throughout the entire development process. The biggest single influence on the look and the layout of the dungeon comes from our &lt;a href=\"concept%20art\"&gt;concept art&lt;/a&gt;, and there was no shortage of that for Icecrown Citadel. Once we locked down the layout, we were able to get to work on the final art extremely quickly thanks to the existing style we'd developed for the Icecrown zone. We really wanted the players to feel connected to the environment, but we wanted to make sure it still had an amazing look. Oftentimes, these two things are hard to mix, but in this case, I think we've been able to pull off an amazing dungeon from both the art and design standpoint.\nWhat sorts of new loot and item abilities will we see in Icecrown?\nGreg: There are three main sources of loot for Icecrown: the bosses themselves, the &lt;a href=\"%3AEmblem%20of%20Frost\"&gt;:Emblem of Frost&lt;/a&gt; badge &lt;a href=\"vendor\"&gt;vendor&lt;/a&gt;s, and a new faction, the &lt;a href=\"Ashen%20Verdict\"&gt;Ashen Verdict&lt;/a&gt;, that will provide suitable rewards as well, particularly at the &lt;a href=\"Exalted\"&gt;Exalted&lt;/a&gt; level.\nAs far as the items themselves go, we want them to feel epic. In addition to having favorable optimization, we also want to try a lot of experiments to make the items feel cool and unique. We are going to try to do a lot of weapon procs, for instance, which is something we haven't done much since the original World of Warcraft.\nWhen you set out to itemize \"sister\" areas -- like the Icecrown Citadel dungeon and raid, or Halls of Stone, Halls of Lightning, and Ulduar -- do you take any steps to make loot from these places feel similar?\nGreg: Absolutely. We approach that on two fronts: the art and the names. When we did the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Stone\"&gt;Halls of Stone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Stone\"&gt;Lightning&lt;/a&gt;, we hadn't completed the Ulduar raid yet, so the items there didn't necessarily have &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt;-influenced art models for us to use. We are doing the Icecrown dungeon at the same time as the raid, and it's a style we already know pretty well, from Naxxramas and even the Warcraft RTS games.\nNaming is something we've had a lot of fun with. There's a ton of lore to draw from for Icecrown loot and it has a very strong \"kit.\" World of Warcraft players know to associate the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"bat\"&gt;bat&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;cultists&lt;/a&gt; along with more traditional forms of &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;, like &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"lich\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt;es.\nDo you itemize Icecrown's \"trash\" -- the enemies between bosses -- differently from elites elsewhere in the world elsewhere?\nGreg: We make sure there is epic trash loot -- specific items that only drop from trash. It helps keep players interested between bosses. However, we aren't doing Heroic trash, just Heroic bosses, so there won't be unique trash loot for Heroic versions of the 10- and 25-player versions of the raid. We try to construct the trash in such a way that it isn't trivial to go farm the first pull or whatever in hopes that an epic drops. We make our raids more accessible now in general, so I'm not sure the motivation is there to try stunts like that the way it once was. We want players who have raided so far in Wrath of the Lich King to be able to actually fight the Lich King, so chances are a lot of raiders will have plenty of opportunities to gear up. Now, the Heroics are another story -- those will be as challenging as they were in Ulduar and &lt;a href=\"Trial%20of%20the%20Crusader\"&gt;Trial of the Crusader&lt;/a&gt;, and the items will likewise be even better.\nWhat have you done to make the tier-10 sets feel like a meaningful advancement from tier 8 and tier 9? How do they visually represent Icecrown's lore and history?\nGreg: Not only do we want them to be a meaningful advancement, but we want them to feel really awesome. This is Arthas loot you're talking about. We started by spending a lot of time on the concept art to make sure it tied into the type of creatures you'll encounter and the whole Icecrown art \"kit\" in general. For example, the &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt; tier-10 set has a strong &lt;a href=\"geist\"&gt;geist&lt;/a&gt; look to it, while the &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt; set has strong &lt;a href=\"Nerubian\"&gt;Nerubian&lt;/a&gt; elements, and the &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; set looks a lot like the Blood Princes. You can see the Icecrown look and feel in a lot of pieces, which itself drew strongly from the Lich King's original helmet. Look for lots of blue, ice, skulls, and spikes.\nWe have also spent a lot longer on the set bonuses than we usually do. It's important that they feel awesome for every &lt;a href=\"class\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt; and spec. Going back to the Crusaders' Coliseum, part of the challenge we made for ourselves was to create an instance that didn't require as much time or resources as Ulduar to develop, yet was still cool. We had set bonuses for the tier-9 gear, but they were often simple -- more crit on a common ability was a typical one. For tier 10, we're really going for set bonuses that change your game up a little. At the very least, you should want to change your rotation a little, though this is easier with some classes than others.\nIf you had something like a mission statement or a slogan for itemizing Icecrown, what would it be?\nGreg: Epic. Cool things. Proc'y stuff.\nSeriously, that's our mission statement. One of the risks of itemization is making things feel too formulaic. We know that when we step outside the bounds too much, players can have a bad reaction to it, like, \"Why does my gear for this tier suck?\" It's easy to fall into the trap of making the new gear feel just like the last gear with 20 more stat points. That is the exact design approach we use for the PvP gear, and left unchecked, it would be easy to go the same direction with the PvE gear as well. We're trying not to do that. We think we owe it to Icecrown for the gear to be memorable, but that means we're going to take a few chances.\nCan you talk about any of the new mechanics we'll see in the raid?\nCory: One of the coolest new things we're doing in Icecrown is the &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Gunship%20Battle\"&gt;gunship air battle&lt;/a&gt;. Players will be able to board their respective faction's &lt;a href=\"gunship\"&gt;gunship&lt;/a&gt; and then take to the air for a battle to the top of the citadel. They'll be fighting on the decks as well as using vehicles' &lt;a href=\"cannon\"&gt;cannon&lt;/a&gt; emplacements. If you're really daring, you can put on a &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; rocket pack and propel yourself back and forth between the two battling gunships. Needless to say, this will be a type of encounter that our players have never experienced before.\nIcecrown Citadel's structure is extremely vertical -- what challenges does that present from a layout perspective?\nCory: Well, we knew from the start that the layout was going to be vertical, just due to the nature of the original spire. There are a number of things that we're doing to help players get around and not get lost. We're using elevators, teleporters, and even gunships to get players where they need to go in the dungeon. We are also going to have an in-game map with full support for all floors -- that should help too.\nIcecrown is the last major raid and dungeon before the release of Cataclysm -- how has that affected the design?\nGreg: The major challenge from an itemization perspective is that the items have to last basically until &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;. That means we can't afford to give them away too quickly, but they also need to feel powerful enough that players are motivated to keep trying for them. On the other hand, the really fun thing about doing a final raid tier is how it unties your hands. We can afford to make these items great because nothing needs to follow on their heels. It's cool to be able to optimize the items very well, because it's okay if players don't want to replace these items for a long time.\nCory: We are really pushing as hard as we can to deliver the most epic experience possible. We know that our players have been waiting for this for a long time, and we plan to deliver. Everyone should expect to see this sort of storytelling and attention to detail in Cataclysm as well. I think we are always striving to pull the people who play our game into the storyline and really give them an explanation for why they're there. It won't be too long before they'll get a chance to bring the pain to &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;!"}

Now awakened from his tomb by his &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;old allies&lt;/a&gt;, Lei Shen has returned, promising to reclaim &lt;a href=\"Mogu%20empire\"&gt;his ancient empire&lt;/a&gt;.\nBeside the heroes of the Shado-Pan and the champions of your faction, you'll assault Lei Shen's &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;island&lt;/a&gt; to prevent the returned Thunder King from using his destructive powers against Pandaria, and claim his forgotten engines of war \u2013 quickly \u2013 before the enemy's faction can turn them on you. \nNew Raid: Throne of Thunder.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Throne of Thunder&lt;/a&gt; is the remains of the mogu empire at the peak of its power and ostentation: towering chambers too vast to ever be used by \u2018normal-sized' &lt;a href=\"race\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt;s; hidden grottoes where the mogu once tried their hands at creation; vine-covered ruins now occupied by burgeoning armies, and the immense halls and audience chambers of Lei Shen himself. The raid includes 4 separate wings (with 13 total bosses), and supports 10 and 25-player groups and multiple difficulty levels.\nNew World Bosses.\nThe rise of the Thunder King is accompanied by the emergence of frightful new creatures too willful to dwell inside a dungeon. Successfully dominating Lei Shen's isle unearths &lt;a href=\"Nalak\"&gt;Nalak&lt;/a&gt;, the Storm Lord, near the Throne of Thunder. Meanwhile, the terrifying &lt;a href=\"Oondasta\"&gt;Oondasta&lt;/a&gt; stalks the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Giants\"&gt;Isle of Giants&lt;/a&gt; off of the northern coast of &lt;a href=\"Kun-Lai\"&gt;Kun-Lai&lt;/a&gt;. Only the strongest groups can survive on this primeval island.\nNew Zone: Isle of Thunder.\nThe Isle of Thunder is a gargantuan zone for player characters of maximum level, and its storm-fraught shores are rife with conflict and opportunity. In patch 5.2, you'll advance the war effort on your server through &lt;a href=\"quest\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt;s relating to the island assault; as your faction progresses, one-time events will open up, allowing you to unlock and explore more of the island. You'll help your faction leaders claim a beachhead, assault the city walls, and forge a path to the front door of the Thunder King's palace. Once you've established a forward base, you'll be able to pick from different types of quests \u2013 PvP or PvE \u2013 to continue advancing the story.\nLoot is plentiful \u2013 we've added tons of new daily quests to the zone, with reward satchels that include tokens to summon killable bosses, and keys for the &lt;a href=\"Troves%20of%20the%20Thunder%20King\"&gt;Treasure Room&lt;/a&gt;, a single-player loot-grabbing scenario. You'll also be able to unlock new reward areas throughout the island, including the &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Forge\"&gt;Lightning Forge&lt;/a&gt;: once used by the ancient mogu to craft weapons of titanic power, now co-opted by your side's blacksmiths.\nNew Factions.\nThe danger of Lei Shen's return has summoned paragons of many paths to the Isle. The &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan%20Assault\"&gt;Shado-Pan Assault&lt;/a&gt; strives to topple the Thunder King before he can reform his army and grind Pandaria beneath his heel. They'll recognize your progress in the Throne of Thunder raid (and trade you impressive gear for valor points).\nThe &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; have also deployed their most experienced relic-hunters and spellweavers to bend the Thunder King's powerful arsenal to their own purposes. Arriving on the island are the Horde's &lt;a href=\"Sunreaver%20Onslaught\"&gt;Sunreaver Onslaught&lt;/a&gt;, captained by &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;, and the Alliance's &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor%20Offensive\"&gt;Kirin-Tor Offensive&lt;/a&gt;, guided by &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;. Through these two groups, you'll be able to purchase uncovered mogu &lt;a href=\"technology\"&gt;technology&lt;/a&gt;, tamed &lt;a href=\"mount\"&gt;mount&lt;/a&gt;s and more.\nLegendary Questline, Continued.\n&lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt;, the Black Prince, wants to investigate the origins of the mogu's power and, with luck, emulate them. You'll work with the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragon\"&gt;black dragon&lt;/a&gt; prince to learn the secrets of the old empire, and then help create a new, legendary artifact of age-old mogu design.\nAnd More!\nThis is just the beginning \u2013 there's a smorgasbord of newness coming in 5.2, including new &lt;a href=\"Lorewalker\"&gt;Lorewalker&lt;/a&gt; artifacts, changes to &lt;a href=\"Farmer%20Yoon\"&gt;Farmer Yoon&lt;/a&gt;'s plot (hint: time to be your own boss), hidden treasure chests, and much, much more."}

The watcher Mimiron constructed the Flame Leviathan as part of his V0-L7R-0N weapons platform.\n&lt;a href=\"Razorscale\"&gt;Razorscale&lt;/a&gt;.\nPreviously known as Veranus, this creature was captured by Loken and twisted into a vicious weapon. Under Loken's orders, Ignis the Furnace Master fused iron plates onto Razorscale's scales to enhance her deadly strikes.\n&lt;a href=\"Ignis%20the%20Furnace%20Master%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Ignis the Furnace Master&lt;/a&gt;.\nLike the other titan creations in Ulduar, Ignis now serves the Old God Yogg-Saron.

These leaders are known as Stormcaller Brundir, Runemaster Molgeim, and Steelbreaker.\n&lt;a href=\"Algalon%20the%20Observer%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Algalon the Observer&lt;/a&gt;.\nLoken's death triggered a failsafe mechanism warning the titans that Azeroth had lost its foremost guardian. Algalon the Observer has been sent to examine the situation and, if necessary, transmit a reply-code that will restructure the entire world, wiping out all of its current inhabitants.\n&lt;a href=\"Kologarn\"&gt;Kologarn&lt;/a&gt;.\nLoken requisitioned Ignis the Furnace Master to create this towering giant as a guard for the Shattered Walkway. His oversized proportions, including a pair of massive arms, allow Kologarn to easily crush any intruders who attempt to reach the inner sanctum.\n&lt;a href=\"Auriaya\"&gt;Auriaya&lt;/a&gt;.\nUlduar's archivist patrols the Observation Ring accompanied by ferocious cats. Years of solitude have weighed heavily on Auriaya, and the Old God's growing power seems to have destroyed the last shreds of her sanity.\n&lt;a href=\"Hodir%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Hodir&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe giant Hodir once presided over the Temple of Winter, lending his guidance to the frost giants in the Storm Peaks. Now the watcher dwells in an ice cave in the Halls of Winter, forced to serve the will of Yogg-Saron.\n&lt;a href=\"Thorim%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Thorim&lt;/a&gt;.\nFor many years Thorim believed that the ice giants had murdered his beloved wife, Sif, not realizing that his brother, Loken, was truly responsible. When Thorim learned the truth, Loken ensnared him and brought him to Ulduar.\n&lt;a href=\"Freya%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Freya&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe watcher Freya was formerly a protector of all living things, aided by three stoic elders. Though her conservatory remains lush and verdant, she has also succumbed to the Old God's maddening presence.\n&lt;a href=\"Mimiron%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Mimiron&lt;/a&gt;.\nA brilliant inventor, Mimiron has been responsible for several of the most advanced mechanisms on Azeroth. But ever since he was subjected to Loken's disturbed influence, this watcher of Ulduar has only constructed war machines.\n&lt;a href=\"General%20Vezax\"&gt;General Vezax&lt;/a&gt;.\nStrange creatures known as faceless ones lurk in the depths of Ulduar. One of their mightiest commanders, General Vezax, guards the twisted passages leading to the Prison of Yogg-Saron.\n&lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt;.\nLong ago the titans imprisoned Yogg-Saron deep within Ulduar to save Azeroth from the Old God's destructive power. But after years of plotting, Yogg-Saron has succeeded in corrupting its guards, and now the monstrous creature is finally breaking free.\nSource.\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20090608033535/http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/underdev/3p1/bosstiary.html"}

An influential group of &lt;a href=\"Jungle%20troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s, known as the &lt;a href=\"Atal%27ai\"&gt;Atal'ai&lt;/a&gt;, called forth the &lt;a href=\"avatar\"&gt;avatar&lt;/a&gt; of an ancient and terrible blood god named &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20the%20Soulflayer\"&gt;Hakkar the Soulflayer&lt;/a&gt;. Though the priests were defeated and ultimately exiled, the great troll empire collapsed upon itself. The exiled priests fled far to the north, into the &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20of%20Sorrows\"&gt;Swamp of Sorrows&lt;/a&gt;, where they erected a great temple to Hakkar in order to prepare for his arrival into the physical world.\nIn time, the Atal'ai priests discovered that Hakkar's physical form could only be summoned within the ancient capital of the Gurubashi Empire, &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Gurub\"&gt;Zul'Gurub&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, the priests have met with recent success in their quest to call forth Hakkar -- reports confirm the presence of the dreaded Soulflayer in the heart of the Gurubashi ruins.\nIn order to quell the blood god, the trolls of the land banded together and sent a contingent of High Priests into the ancient city. Each priest was a powerful champion of the &lt;a href=\"Loa\"&gt;Primal Gods&lt;/a&gt; -- Bat, Panther, Tiger, Spider, and Snake -- but despite their best efforts, they fell under the sway of Hakkar. Now the champions and their Primal God aspects feed the awesome power of the Soulflayer. Any adventurers brave enough to venture into the foreboding ruins must overcome the High Priests if they are to have any hope of confronting the mighty blood god.\nZul' Gurub is a 20-man raid instance located in the northeastern portion of Stranglethorn Vale."}

Weaving through the heart of Kezan in a dizzying network of tunnels, vaults, and lava tubes, Undermine epitomizes the goblins' complex, unpredictable mindset. The city has many such as &lt;a href=\"Pyrix\"&gt;Pyrix&lt;/a&gt;, and its air is stale and oily. &lt;a href=\"Troll\"&gt;Troll&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"slave\"&gt;slave&lt;/a&gt;s work in the city. The city of &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Port\"&gt;Bilgewater Port&lt;/a&gt;, located on the surface of Kezan, linked to the underground metropolis.\nHistory.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari troll&lt;/a&gt;s originally enslaved the goblins and forced them to mine &lt;a href=\"kaja%27mite\"&gt;kaja'mite&lt;/a&gt; ore from the bowels of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Kajaro\"&gt;Mount Kajaro&lt;/a&gt;. After the goblins' intelligence was heightened by the magical mineral and they revolted against the trolls to claim Kezan for themselves, the mines that had been their prison, their slave camp, and the base of their rebellion now became the city of Undermine. It was there that they built the foundations of &lt;a href=\"Trade%20Coalition\"&gt;an empire&lt;/a&gt; in which their inventions would help them rule the world, but as the supply and effects of kaja'mite dwindled and the goblins' intelligence waned, they ultimately turned to mercantilism instead.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; caused Kajaro to erupt during the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the molten lava threatened to incinerate the island, and though the ultimate fate of Undermine remains unknown, the city was presumably heavily damaged, being as it was under Kajaro. Immediately after the disaster, some goblins believed all of Kezan to have been destroyed, though this &lt;a href=\"MOTHERLODE%21%21\"&gt;later proved&lt;/a&gt; to be incorrect.\nMentions of the Undermine.\nOther mentions.\nNew Year event.\nThe New Year 2005 content on the official community site, which states: \"The innovative and artistic engineers of Undermine have been slaving away since their display of pyrotechnics in July.\"\nMidsummer Fire Festival Event.\nThe Midsummer Fire Festival 2008 event on the official community site, which states: \"The lengthy Midsummer Fire Festival traditionally ends with the sky itself being set alight. The goblins of Undermine have lent their considerable skill (and copious amounts of gunpowder) to the task, resulting in a tremendous fireworks show! Take up a festival mug and raise a toast to the season as the multicolored explosions dance across the sky above you!\"\nIn the RPG.\nUndermine is the nefarious capital of the &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;'s trade empire, the &lt;a href=\"Trade%20Coalition\"&gt;Trade Coalition&lt;/a&gt;. Located beneath and within &lt;a href=\"Kezan\"&gt;Kezan&lt;/a&gt;, Undermine is the center of goblin civilization. It is connected to the island via a series of volcanic tunnels which were created by &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Kajaro\"&gt;Mount Kajaro&lt;/a&gt;'s volcanic and tectonic activities.\nThe &lt;a href=\"trade%20prince\"&gt;trade prince&lt;/a&gt;s each control their own private armies and &lt;a href=\"Trade%20Fleets\"&gt;trade fleets&lt;/a&gt;. As a result, Undermine is a busy place, as the goblin city goes about its business.\nThere are some &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; ambassadors present in the Undermine.\nDescription.\nThe main centers of population in Undermine are in volcanic caverns beneath Kezan. Secondary island caverns exist farther away, and the goblins have constructed tunnels of thick glass that lead to these smaller areas. Passing through these tubes means walking along the ocean's floor and looking out to see the colorful &lt;a href=\"fish\"&gt;fish&lt;/a&gt; and hungry &lt;a href=\"shark\"&gt;shark&lt;/a&gt;s nearby. &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Port\"&gt;Bilgewater Port&lt;/a&gt; is linked directly to Undermine.\nAs the capital of goblin culture, Undermine teems with chaotic activity. Goblin &lt;a href=\"alchemist\"&gt;alchemist&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"tinker\"&gt;tinker&lt;/a&gt;s practice their crafts and set off explosions. &lt;a href=\"Slavery\"&gt;Slave&lt;/a&gt; markets bustle in out-of-the-way places. Shops and businesses of all kinds are based here, and the headquarters of the &lt;a href=\"Trade%20Coalition\"&gt;Trade Coalition&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Venture%20Company\"&gt;Venture Company&lt;/a&gt; and myriad other enterprises are within this city. In Undermine, you can find the extremes on both ends: reeking slave pens in one area, the &lt;a href=\"trade%20prince\"&gt;trade prince&lt;/a&gt;s' lavish palaces in another. &lt;a href=\"Zovzik\"&gt;Zovzik&lt;/a&gt;'s shop is located in the city.\nOf particular interest is the fact that, wandering around Undermine, is a strange breed of a creature called &lt;a href=\"hobgoblin\"&gt;hobgoblin&lt;/a&gt;s. They resemble goblins, but are much taller and have purple skin."}

A &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; explained to Thrall that the murlocs were once peaceful, but had recently begun to capture the trolls for sacrifices. Apparently, if the sacrifices were not met, the Sea Witch would destroy the island. The murlocs' society was highly organized compared to other murlocs, including buildings that made fighting units, heroes, and attack tower buildings. They seemed to have a high tolerance for heat, as their hero wielded fire magic and their cave home was afire with great braziers and rivers of lava. The &lt;a href=\"Murloc%20Sorcerer\"&gt;Murloc Sorcerer&lt;/a&gt; appeared to be their leader next to the Sea Witch and, unlike most murlocs, he was capable of fluent speech.\nThey captured members of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear tribe&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20Marine\"&gt;Kul Tiras Marine&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; managed to break out and free the Horde and Darkspear prisoners, while the Kul Tiran prisoners' bid for freedom led only to their deaths at the hands of the underground denizens. Thrall was too late to help &lt;a href=\"Sen%27jin\"&gt;Sen'jin&lt;/a&gt;, who was killed by the Murloc Sorcerer. Enraged, Thrall and his troops destroyed both the sorcerer and his forces. The Underworld Minions later failed in preventing Thrall and his allies from escaping the island.\nIn \"\" the Sea Witch returns, now revealed as the naga Zar'jira. She leads the &lt;a href=\"Spitescale\"&gt;Spitescale&lt;/a&gt; naga in an invasion of the &lt;a href=\"Echo%20Isles\"&gt;Echo Isles&lt;/a&gt;, where she is ultimately slain by the trolls. Her Underworld Minions, however, are nowhere to be seen, leaving their fate a mystery.\nSpeculation.\nSince they do not appear alongside Zar'jira in , it is possible that the Underworld Minions have met their end in the Darkspear Isles after the eruption of the island's volcano. Alternatively, the Sea Witch could have left them behind to guard the subterranean halls of her domain, where they still await the deliverance of the dark promises she made years ago."}
