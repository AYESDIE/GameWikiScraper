She used to be the first mate to &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Rhenik\"&gt;Captain Rhenik&lt;/a&gt; but rebelled against him after learning that he sought to sell their freedom to the &lt;a href=\"Ashvane%20Trading%20Company\"&gt;Ashvane Trading Company&lt;/a&gt;. In this endeavor, she was aided by the Horde and thus allowed them the use of &lt;a href=\"Plunder%20Harbor\"&gt;Plunder Harbor&lt;/a&gt; as foothold within &lt;a href=\"Tiragarde%20Sound\"&gt;Tiragarde Sound&lt;/a&gt;, after which she became its captain.\nBiography.\nAt an unknown point in time, she joined the &lt;a href=\"Fogsail%20Freebooters\"&gt;Fogsail Freebooters&lt;/a&gt;, where she rose to the rank of First Mate. \nBy the time of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Rhenik\"&gt;Captain Rhenik&lt;/a&gt;, convinced that riches were in store, sought to sell the services of the Fogsail Freebooters to the &lt;a href=\"Ashvane%20Trading%20Company\"&gt;Ashvane Trading Company&lt;/a&gt;. This, in turn, created a schism within the Fogsail Freebooters with those &lt;a href=\"Rhenik%20Loyalist\"&gt;agreeing&lt;/a&gt; with their captain and those who sought their freedom above all else. During this time, Owings came into contact with &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Hunter%20Ty%27jin\"&gt;Shadow Hunter Ty'jin&lt;/a&gt; who sought to establish a &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; outpost within &lt;a href=\"Tiragarde%20Sound\"&gt;Tiragarde Sound&lt;/a&gt;. Though not caring about the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;faction wars&lt;/a&gt; between the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, Owings informed Ty'jin she would allow the Horde use of Plunder Harbor on the condition that they aided her in overthrowing Rhenik.\nDeclaring that the first step in creating a mutiny was making the leadership seem incompetent, Owings sought to have the beer spiked. To her disbelief the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Speaker of the Horde&lt;/a&gt; actually threw spikes in the beer kegs over sabotaging them, leaving her to remark \"That is not what I... You know what? Sure. That works.\" As her loyalists began their mutiny, they were aided by the &lt;a href=\"Honorbound\"&gt;Honorbound&lt;/a&gt;. While they clashed with the &lt;a href=\"Rhenik%20Loyalist\"&gt;Rhenik Loyalist&lt;/a&gt;s, Owings sought to recruit other authority figures within the pirate crew to her side. In this regard, &lt;a href=\"Quartermaster%20Killian\"&gt;Quartermaster Killian&lt;/a&gt; sided with her, &lt;a href=\"Boatswain%20Taryn\"&gt;Boatswain Taryn&lt;/a&gt; with Rhenik, and &lt;a href=\"Navigator%20Swink\"&gt;Navigator Swink&lt;/a&gt;'s sheer refusal to work with the Horde caused him to attack the Speaker. Upon learning of the deaths of Taryn and Swink, she expressed disappointment that Taryn remained loyal to Rhenik.\nWith Rhenik's authority weakened, Owings declared that it was time to take the mutiny to him. After his death, she claimed the position of captain of the Fogsail Freebooters and honoring her agreement opened Plunder Harbor up for Horde usage.\nAs part of a gambit to claim the &lt;a href=\"%3AAbyssal%20Scepter\"&gt;:Abyssal Scepter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller\"&gt;Nathanos Blightcaller&lt;/a&gt; sent &lt;a href=\"Marshal%20M.%20Valentine\"&gt;word&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Katherine%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Katherine Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; that the Horde was in possession of &lt;a href=\"Derek%20Proudmoore\"&gt;her son's corpse&lt;/a&gt; which was located at Plunder Harbor. The Kul Tirans subsequently attacked the harbor, which caused an outraged Owings to inform him that while the Horde could make a base in her harbor, she did not give them permission to lead the Proudmoore fleet to her very door. However, Nathanos was unmoved and simply promised to pay her plenty for her trouble.\nAfter the Abyssal Scepter was acquired by the Speaker of the Horde and &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Zelling\"&gt;Thomas Zelling&lt;/a&gt;, the Scepter was used against the Kul Tiran forces which ended the siege of Plunder Harbor. Though vexed by Nathanos's actions, Owings stuck to her agreement with Ty'jin, and her forces later aided the Horde in their &lt;a href=\"Faction%20Assault%20on%20Tiragarde%20Sound\"&gt;striking out against the Alliance forces within Tiragarde Sound&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuotes.\nGossip.\nI did not agree to drawing the Kul Tiran fleet to my harbor.\nYou better have a suitable plan. I refuse to lose my freedom.\nI thank you and your Horde for your aid in freeing my crew.\nFor as long as I am in charge, the Fogsail will be free to roam the seas!"}
