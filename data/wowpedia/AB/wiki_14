With the aid of Joseph's hunting blade and several other artifacts, the spirits of all who participated in the Battle of Darrowshire are brought together near the town's ruins and forced to relive its events.

This act heals and redeems his spirit, allowing him to return to Pamela at last.\nStrategy.\nRedpath always appears at the second battle area near the graveyard, no matter where Marduk corrupts him from. Redpath should be kept away from his lackeys, especially the &lt;a href=\"Bloodletter\"&gt;Bloodletter&lt;/a&gt;s.

The Thanes are constantly at war between them.\nThe exact relation between the &lt;a href=\"Mjordin\"&gt;Mjordin&lt;/a&gt; and the Jotunheim vrykul is unclear. They share the cliff city of &lt;a href=\"Jotunheim\"&gt;Jotunheim&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Balargarde%20Fortress\"&gt;Balargarde Fortress&lt;/a&gt; but there was no evidence to link them directly.\nHistory.\nThe vrykul here were the first to be reawakened, and as such Jotunheim is of significant importance to the vrykul race, second only to &lt;a href=\"Ymirheim\"&gt;Ymirheim&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, the clan was under the lead of &lt;a href=\"Overthane%20Balargarde\"&gt;Overthane Balargarde&lt;/a&gt;, until he was killed by the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s. In their village, vrykul fought each other in the pit of &lt;a href=\"Valhalas\"&gt;Valhalas&lt;/a&gt;; the winners of these combats became one of the &lt;a href=\"Ymirjar\"&gt;Ymirjar&lt;/a&gt;, the elite warrior caste created by &lt;a href=\"King%20Ymiron\"&gt;King Ymiron&lt;/a&gt; in service of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, and the loser became a &lt;a href=\"vargul\"&gt;vargul&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; creature.\nAt some point, &lt;a href=\"Bethod%20Feigr\"&gt;Bethod Feigr&lt;/a&gt; was sent by &lt;a href=\"Thane%20Ufrang%20the%20Mighty\"&gt;Thane Ufrang the Mighty&lt;/a&gt; in order to become Thane. However, Illskar used some kind of dark magic to cheat and win the fight. Bethod was damned and became a &lt;a href=\"vargul\"&gt;vargul&lt;/a&gt;. Later, Bethod sent some adventurers to avenge him in killing &lt;a href=\"Thane%20Illskar\"&gt;Thane Illskar&lt;/a&gt; and his champions. Justice was done and Illskar was damned and became a vargul too. The work accomplished, he asked to remain alone in his shame.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Vault\"&gt;Shadow Vault&lt;/a&gt; fell under the control of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Duke%20Lankral\"&gt;Duke Lankral&lt;/a&gt;, the destruction of Jotunheim was one of the projects.

Afterwards, the adventurers were sent there to weaken the vrykul resolve by burning their banners, to help &lt;a href=\"the%20Bone%20Witch\"&gt;the Bone Witch&lt;/a&gt; wreaking havoc from within, to burn down their buildings, to plant Ebon Blade banners in the bodies of their fallen warriors, and also to slay their &lt;a href=\"proto-dragon\"&gt;proto-dragon&lt;/a&gt;s. Finally, &lt;a href=\"Overthane%20Balargarde\"&gt;Overthane Balargarde&lt;/a&gt; has been challenged and killed under the eyes of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;war against the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, the brothers &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard\"&gt;Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; reported that the village is still active, and that the vrykul are still challenging each other in the pit of &lt;a href=\"Valhalas\"&gt;Valhalas&lt;/a&gt;, this time without no death god to serve, at least. They also noted that the &lt;a href=\"val%27kyr\"&gt;val'kyr&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Geirrvif\"&gt;Geirrvif&lt;/a&gt; was still alive, and still overseeing the arena."}

I will uphold the pledge that I took to represent the Explorers Guild and to survey the grandiose kingdoms of the world to the utmost of my abilities.\nIn my travels, I have already seen many wondrous sites and encountered a fair number of strange creatures. And, to my palate's delight, I have been privileged enough to sample a wide variety of exotic ales brewed by our human neighbors to the south!\nIndeed, the human lands are captivating. I ventured into the vast forest called ', and I must confess that in all my days within the stuffy bowels of Ironforge, I have never seen a land more verdant and peaceful. ' and ' roam the lush woods, and I caught sight of a few pesky ' skulking near the rocky cliffs they so love. And to think that we thought the vermin were a problem only in our kingdom! Still, despite the surrounding serenity, I sensed a certain danger lurking in the shadows... As if some thief or cutpurse would leap out at any moment and attack.\nNear the center of the forest, I came across a rustic tavern known as the , where for a few silver, I indulged in spiced venison and a frothy flagon of rich ale. Ah, comrades, to describe that sweet brew would require a whole separate entry! The hardy humans of Elwynn were gracious hosts. I think it is safe to assume that our two races will share good relations for many years to come.\nWell, I've taken enough time already. The road beckons, comrades! I'm off again!\nWestfall.\nGreetings, comrades! Be assured that my mission to survey the lands of Azeroth continues unabated. I have left the tranquil forests of Elwynn behind me and write to you now from the lonely land called . Like you, I was under the impression that this fallow realm had once been the verdant breadbasket of the human lands. Imagine my surprise at finding only abandoned farms and countless acres of cropland left for the crows!\nAs I inspected a few of the scattered, lonely farms, I found only a few discarded mementos of the humans who had once toiled ceaselessly over this land. I left the melancholy hovels behind and set off across the rolling fields of dust.\nAfter a while, I came across what looked to be an abandoned mining town named '. Once again, the hairs on the back of my neck stood up - as if I was being watched. With practiced ease, I unslung my trusted axe and braced myself for battle. Sure enough, three spry figures leaped down from the shadows. I quickly realized that they were nothing more than common '. All wore crimson scarves to conceal their faces - leading me to suspect that the scarves served as badges of their shadowy brotherhood.\nAlthough my foes were skillful, I dispatched them with relative ease. It was only then that I heard the strange whirring sound behind me. I spun around to see a clunky creature, which looked to be some kind of giant scarecrow. It had blazing orange eyes and large, razor-sharp metal claws. The creature, which I now call the , lunged at me again and again with an almost mechanical awkwardness.\nI landed a - which, much to my surprise, exposed whirling gears and servos right where its heart should have been! I realized then that it would take more than just my axe to defeat the monstrosity! Ducking another of the Golem's slashing blows, I grabbed the trusty musket rifle I keep slung upon my back. As the whirring menace rushed in for its final attack, I shoved my rifle into its open chest-wound and pulled the trigger. With a jarring blast of thunder, the mechanical beast dropped and fell silent.\nAs I left the strange town of ' behind me, I began to wonder if it was the ' and who had scared all the farmers away... With any luck, I'll be able to return here and solve this mystery once and for all.\nFor now, the road beckons! My journey is far from over...\nStranglethorn.\nGreetings, once again, comrades! My travels have led me south, past the amber fields of Westfall and into the lush jungle realm of . Though my previous encounters were hazardous to say the least, they were nothing compared to what I experienced this day!\nThe caws of tropical birds and the low rumblings of predatory cats seemed to come from every direction as I . To my relief, I found a stream of fresh water and knelt to refill my water skin. Yet, as I splashed the cool waters upon my sweaty brow, I noticed a strange shadow moving behind the foliage nearby.\nFrom the corner of my eye, I could see that the monster was some sort of predatory reptile - and that it was easily twice my size! But that didn't concern me as much as its terrible, glowing eyes that beamed brilliantly like twin stars on a moonless night. I froze in my tracks - realizing that the scaly beast was a ! These multi-legged predators, whose gaping jaws can crush plate armor, have a deadly gaze that turns anyone caught by it to stone!\nKeeping my eyes tightly closed, I slowly drew forth my double-barreled flintlock pistol. Having no time to consider my options, I pulled the trigger and gave the monster a taste of my Dwarven hand cannon! Recoiling from the blast, I quickly got to my feet and unslung my trusty battle-axe. Yet, as the smoke from my pistol cleared, I saw that the beast had fled, leaving me to ponder if my galvanized bullets had pierced its tough, crystal-hewn hide. I can assure you that only my experience in fighting such magical beasts saved me!\nUndaunted by my harrowing encounter, I traveled even deeper into the misty jungles of Stranglethorn. After a time, I stumbled upon what looked to be an . This was my first discovery that a civilization had existed within this vine-entangled wood! But were the beings that sculpted the strange totem still lurking within these lands?\nMy questions were answered soon enough, as I gazed down upon what looked to be an ! With battle-axe in hand, I descended cautiously into the vine-covered ruins. I'd barely taken my seventh step into them as I heard the low, guttural voices of trolls!\nThe dark, broken language reminded me of the mossy forest trolls that I'd battled during the Second War. But, my reverie was cut short as the huge, spear-wielding creatures emerged from the shadowy ruins all around me. The were nearly eight feet tall and had the distinctive tusks and leathery hides of their forest cousins. But, their skin had the blue hue of deep mountain pools. They were also adorned with intricate tribal tattoos that ran the length of their lithe bodies.\nImagine my luck at crossing paths with a ! Against such a group, I could do nothing but turn and hightail it back the way I'd come. With my stout legs pumping like steam pistons, I bolted for the safety of the underbrush as spears and crude axes soared past my head. After what seemed like an eternity of running, I finally lost the cursed trolls amidst the jungle's clamor.\nAs I stopped to catch my breath, I looked back towards the . I resolved to head east... and stay as far as I could from the trolls' ancient ruins.\nEpilogue.\nAttention:\nNoted Dwarven historian and veteran of the Second War Brann Bronzebeard has gone missing!\nHaving undertaken the noble charge of his Explorers Guild to survey the uncharted lands of Azeroth, the celebrated adventurer made his way through the regions of Elwynn Forest and Westfall before filing his last report from the misty jungles of Stranglethorn Vale. According to his most recent correspondence, Brann had just uncovered the ruins of an ancient city hidden deep within Stranglethorn when he was beset upon by a band of savage Jungle Troll headhunters. Presumably, Brann evaded capture, but the only real clue pertaining to his whereabouts comes in the form of a vague final sentence: \"I resolved to head east\u2026\" "}

Opinions range from hating it because of the difficulty, to loving it because it is a challenging event, and because gear and class do not make a difference; only skill makes a difference in jousting.\nJousting basics.\nAll jousting mounts share the requirement that the character have a &lt;a href=\"lance\"&gt;lance&lt;/a&gt; equipped. &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Lance\"&gt;Argent Lance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Lance\"&gt;Alliance Lance&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Lance\"&gt;Horde Lance&lt;/a&gt; all qualify. Additionally, the character must have accomplished particular goals to gain access to jousting mounts.\nThe jousting mounts introduced to day provide a specific set of abilities:\nAll known jousting mounts to date share the first five abilities, although the amount of damage caused can vary. Some jousting mounts do not have the Duel ability, having been provided for specific quests.\nCataclysm.\nSince the launch of &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, it seems as though jousting, like dragon combat in &lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;Wrath of the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, scales by level or &lt;a href=\"item%20level\"&gt;item level&lt;/a&gt;. At least, health of jousting mounts appears to increase. More information is needed.\nThe Argent Tournament.\n&lt;a href=\"Justicar%20Mariel%20Trueheart\"&gt;Justicar Mariel Trueheart&lt;/a&gt; directs players to the pavilion for their respective faction. Once there, they are entered into the Argent Tournament rolls as an Aspirant.\nAspirants.\nThe task of an aspirant is to practice the mechanics of jousting. These mechanics are introduced with the quests &lt;a href=\"Mastery%20Of%20Melee\"&gt;Mastery Of Melee&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mastery%20Of%20The%20Charge\"&gt;Mastery Of The Charge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mastery%20Of%20The%20Shield-Breaker\"&gt;Mastery Of The Shield-Breaker&lt;/a&gt;, and they are continued with &lt;a href=\"Learning%20The%20Reins\"&gt;Learning The Reins&lt;/a&gt;.\nOther tasks assigned aspirants include defeating a number of &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; forces in the field, and retrieving weapons suitable to knights.\nDuring this time, the aspirant is permitted to ride a &lt;a href=\"Quel%27dorei%20Steed\"&gt;Quel'dorei Steed&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Sunreaver%20Hawkstrider\"&gt;Sunreaver Hawkstrider&lt;/a&gt;. Upon completing a number of quests against inanimate targets, the character is then challenged to defeat an &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Valiant\"&gt;Argent Valiant&lt;/a&gt;.\nNote that the Quel'dorei Steed and Sunreaver Hawkstrider are only available to Aspirants.\nValiants.\nUpon defeating the valiant, the character is promoted to the ranks of the valiants, representing their racial city, and are eligible to complete quests for tokens to advance to the rank of champion. They are eligible to joust with their race's favored mount.\nWhere Aspirants are tasked to practice upon targets, Valiants face live foes. While valiants are still tasked to retrieve weapons and defeat Scourge, they also &lt;a href=\"The%20Grand%20Melee\"&gt;practice mounted combat&lt;/a&gt; amongst themselves, and face &lt;a href=\"At%20The%20Enemy%27s%20Gates\"&gt;mounted scourge forces&lt;/a&gt; in the field. \nAs a valiant completes quests, they earn &lt;a href=\"Valiant%27s%20Seal\"&gt;Valiant's Seal&lt;/a&gt;s, much like aspirants did. Upon completing enough (proving their ability), a valiant is challenged to defeat an &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Champion\"&gt;Argent Champion&lt;/a&gt;.\nChampions.\nUpon defeating the Argent Champion, the character is awarded the rank of Champion (of their city), and may thereafter continue to use their race's jousting mount at the Argent Tournament. (This is a 10 point &lt;a href=\"Achievement\"&gt;Achievement&lt;/a&gt;. If the character is with their race's faction, they earn the achievement \"Exalted Champion of (their city)\", and earn a corresponding title.\nOnce ranked as a champion, they are offered further quests for &lt;a href=\"Champion%27s%20Seal\"&gt;Champion's Seal&lt;/a&gt;s, which are turned in to vendors as currency for tabards, pets, mounts, and a variety of gear.\nChampions face most of the same foes as valiants, but more difficult. They continue to &lt;a href=\"Among%20the%20Champions\"&gt;train amongst themselves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Taking%20Battle%20To%20The%20Enemy\"&gt;battle scourge in general&lt;/a&gt;. At the &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Bones\"&gt;Court of Bones&lt;/a&gt;, they are expected to &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Before%20The%20Citadel\"&gt;challenge and defeat&lt;/a&gt; commanders of the &lt;a href=\"Boneguard\"&gt;Boneguard&lt;/a&gt; forces.\nAdditionally, champions may choose to qualify with other races of their faction, gaining the ability to ride their mounts, and eventually gaining the title of Champion to the other cities and access to the other race's tournament vendors.\nJousting Foes.\nThere are three varieties of foe to test one's mettle against: valiants, champions, Boneguard forces, and other players.\nValiants and champions.\nValiants and champions are NPC foes of the respective level. Each faction has a separate Valiant's Ring near their pavilion. There is a combined Ring of Champions to the southwest of the coliseum, where champion level foes may be found.\nIn each case, the character initiates combat with the NPC by selecting the dialog option. Valiants will start the fight with a single level of Defense. Champions start with three levels. It is recommended that the character stack their own Defense buff to the limit before starting a match with a valiant or champion, as no additional levels are added at the start of the match.\nAside from the levels of Defense, Champions are able to restore levels of defense faster than Valiants, and are generally quicker to respond.\nOnce a character has defeated valiant or champion, they are not permitted to challenge that race's representatives for an hour (real time).\nBoneguard.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Bones\"&gt;Court of Bones&lt;/a&gt; is home to the Boneguard legion, which an &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; force is countering. The character is sent there to face off against several varieties of forces. The character is given access to a &lt;a href=\"Campaign%20Warhorse\"&gt;Campaign Warhorse&lt;/a&gt;, with significantly greater HP, and much greater damage done, than the tournament mounts have.\nThe boneguard forces:\nOther players.\nThe Argent Tournament mounts offer the option to \"duel\" another player. This places the two characters in the same situation as if they were facing an NPC valiant or champion, but with an actual mind behind the opponent. An excellent way to try out new strategies, or just compare jousting abilities.\nJousting strategies.\nDefense is very important. At high levels, you take very little damage, at low levels, quite a bit. A primary objective is to keep your defense buffs stacked to the maximum possible, while lowering your foe's as much as possible.\nAgainst NPCs, the general pattern is that the NPC will alternately close with you and \"thrust\"', and retreat to range and both use \"shield breaker\" and \"charge\", returning to close range.\nAn elementary strategy to use against them is to wait for the NPC to open range between you, use Shield-Breaker and close range again before your foe has time to charge you. This works to keep your foe from building up stacks of Defense, or to provide a brief opening of lower defense before he is able to restore it.\nA more advanced strategy, once you see your foe opening range, is to do the same, and to \"charge\" the moment range is wide enough to permit it. Charge does the same \"remove a stack of Defense\" effect that Shield Breaker has, but also does more damage. Under the effects of charge, you will continue past your foe for a few seconds. While you cannot stop during this period, you CAN turn. Turning both keeps the range between you and your foe from increasing, and it causes your foe to take more time to orient on you. With practice, you can rein in your mount such that you are too close to your foe for him to charge you back, AND far enough that you can get in a \"Shield Breaker\" attack off as well.\nNPC valiants and champions will head in a random direction, when they are trying to gain range against you. During time when you are \"thrusting\" against each other, you can lead your foe back towards the center of the ring simply by backing up. An incidental advantage to this is that if your opponent decides to open up range again while you are backing up, you are already opening range for your next charge."}

Jubei'Thos commanded the &lt;a href=\"Slave%20Master\"&gt;Slave Master&lt;/a&gt; to capture many humans in the town of &lt;a href=\"Strahnbrad\"&gt;Strahnbrad&lt;/a&gt; and to the &lt;a href=\"Blademaster%20of%20the%20Blackrock%20Clan\"&gt;Blademaster of the Blackrock Clan&lt;/a&gt; to sacrifice them to appease their demon masters.

{"id": "338695", "revid": "39299307", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=338695", "title": "Jubeka Shadowbreaker", "text": "Jubeka Shadowbreaker is a powerful &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; master &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; trainer, member of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20the%20Black%20Harvest\"&gt;Council of the Black Harvest&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nAfter convening with her fellow warlocks on the Council, Jubeka was partnered with &lt;a href=\"Kanrethad%20Ebonlocke\"&gt;Kanrethad Ebonlocke&lt;/a&gt; to return to &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. \nImmediately afterwards, Kanrethad departed alone for the dusty wasteland of &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Valley\"&gt;Shadowmoon Valley&lt;/a&gt;. She didn't care very much about the Council executing her for returning alone, she believed that as long as her grimoires lasted, so would her legacy.\nFor two weeks, her research continued as drudgingly expected. She noted that the fel imps of\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Felspark%20Ravine\"&gt;Felspark Ravine&lt;/a&gt; in\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; were remarkably chatty, that they were just as easy to contract into service as their names were to learn, and that the ritual to summon one was trivial, at best. &lt;a href=\"Voidlord%20%28warlock%20minion%29\"&gt;Voidlords&lt;/a&gt; were rather difficult to stumble across, but it took very little persuading to convince one to divulge the name of a rival lord.\nTwenty-one days after their arrival on Outland, Kanrethad returned, looking incredibly grim. Jubeka was ready to attempt for the first time the binding of a higher order member of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, but she dared not attempt the ritual alone. With the aid of Kanrethad, they summoned a &lt;a href=\"Shivarra\"&gt;Shivarra&lt;/a&gt;, but she broke free almost instantly after the completion of the summoning ritual. In the instant that the Shivarra's razor-sharp blades sliced through the air, Kanrethad's form shifted and the blades bounced as if striking stone. Unlike the typical form of\u00a0metamorphosis, he had not yet completed his demonic transformation.\nWhile examining the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Farahlon\"&gt;Ruins of Farahlon&lt;/a&gt; in\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Netherstorm\"&gt;Netherstorm&lt;/a&gt;, she was ambushed by a race of floating eyeball squids calling themselves\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Observer\"&gt;observers&lt;/a&gt;. Unexpectedly intelligent, they expressed a deep desire to bear witness to all forms of magic and willingly offered their services in exchange for the opportunity to consume new forms of magic. After having spent weeks trying to understand how to summon one of these demons, she noted in her journal that the ritual to summon an observer was unexpectedly complex. While natives of the Great Dark Beyond, they were highly migratory and the summoning ritual needs to compensate for their travels: without their willing assistance, summoning an observer would be nearly impossible.\nJubeka noted in her journal that the key to binding a\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Wrathguard\"&gt;Wrathguard&lt;/a&gt; was ironically reducing the number of runic symbols used in the summoning circle, and that they were highly resistant to charms and compulsions, but readily responded to basic expressions of strength. Kanrethad was unexpectedly insightful into the conditioning that the Legion uses to compel the wrathguard into action. His ability to express his dominance over lesser demons was remarkable, if short-lived. With great pain, she had been able to inscribe the forms he used to summon multiple demonic servants at once. Unfortunately, while he could bind two lesser demons indefinitely, Jubeka could only do so for a short time.\nTraveling to &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Blade's Edge Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, they left a few ogre corpses in their wake. Studying the ritual circle of Vim'gol revealed additional ways of bolstering their power using demonic sacrifices. While the act greatly enraged their demonic servants, fusing their life energy to their own provided a dramatic increase in power. With a little experimentation, she discovered that the more closely linked you are with the demon you sacrifice, the greater the power of the ritual. She noticed that Kanrethad's ability to restrain his demonic transformation seemed to have reached a plateau. Once again, his lack of power disgusted her: things that would be trivial to most warlocks took him an eternity.\nThere, Kanrethad forcefully interrogated a &lt;a href=\"Doomguard\"&gt;Doomguard&lt;/a&gt;. He wanted to know why his kind was drawn to &lt;a href=\"Fel\"&gt;sacrificial magic&lt;/a&gt;. Using force, he learned that before Sargeras freed them, they were the Titan's hounds, forever enslaved to police the use of arcane magics.\u00a0Indeed, sacrificial magic\u00a0was considered the greatest violation of life and they were attuned to instantly punish those who delved into such sorcery.\nAt Kanrethad's insistence, they headed for the &lt;a href=\"Altar%20of%20Damnation\"&gt;Altar of Damnation&lt;/a&gt; in Shadowmoon Valley. He seemed to be convinced that there was more to the Hand of Gul'dan than just a show of power. Jubeka was not convinced, but at this point her Grimoires were complete. She did not understand Kanrethad's obsession with controlling the flow of demonic power granted by his transformation. While he played around with ancient altars, she intended to try her hand at opening a gateway to conjure many wild imps at once.\nFinally, she found out that Kanrethad was up to something, and that to say she was concerned about their next move was a dramatic understatement. She was convinced there was no chance that they would return from this next adventure alive. As a measure of prevention, she contracted the imps to leave four fragments of her soulstone at the locations listed in her journal. By bringing the four fragments together and finding her body, the reader of the journal would be able to resurrect her and bring her grimoires back to Azeroth.\nHer &lt;a href=\"Jubeka%27s%20Journal\"&gt;journal&lt;/a&gt; was thus returned to Azeroth by her imps and given to trustworthy souls, who then passed it on to a &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; who sought to unlock &lt;a href=\"the%20Codex%20of%20Xerrath\"&gt;the Codex of Xerrath&lt;/a&gt;. Her soulstone, shattered into four parts, was left in the lands she visited: &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Netherstorm\"&gt;Netherstorm&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Blade's Edge Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Valley\"&gt;Shadowmoon Valley&lt;/a&gt;.\nHer journal indicated her growing concern - and suspicion - of Kanrethad's intentions. At the &lt;a href=\"Altar%20of%20Damnation\"&gt;Altar of Damnation&lt;/a&gt; in Shadowmoon, she accused him of not only trying to control more powerful demons but to essentially become one himself. Kanrethad confirmed this and told her that the reason he had chosen her as his associate was so that if he failed, she was to banish him forever. She agreed, and accompanied him inside the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt; where they discovered how &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; had been able to steal demons from &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; and control them: he would let them drink from an untapped store of raw arcane energy with powers similar to the original &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; on Azeroth in exchange for their service.\nThe warlock who followed her trail found the four fragments of Jubeka's soulstone, and fused them together. However, no soul was stored within the stone. Instead, the stone seemed to be drawing power from somewhere in Shadowmoon Valley, beyond the mountains, from the very gates of the Black Temple. He then found a way inside and confronted Kanrethad, fully transformed into a demon, at the summit of the Temple. After Kanrethad's defeat, Jubeka fulfilled the promise she had made to banish Kanrethad, but she had to stand guard over him at the Altar of Damnation for eternity, or Kanrethad would break free.\nLegion.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for the Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, Jubeka and the rest of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20the%20Black%20Harvest\"&gt;Council of the Black Harvest&lt;/a&gt; sought out &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;a powerful warlock&lt;/a&gt; to take place as the Sixth member of the Council, having since lost Kanrethad. They met in the &lt;a href=\"Dalaran%20Sewers\"&gt;sewers&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; to open a portal into the deepest parts of the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; and bind a powerful demon to their will in order to grow stronger against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Things went wrong as the powerful demon they managed to summon, &lt;a href=\"Jagganoth\"&gt;Jagganoth&lt;/a&gt;, overwhelmed the Council, killed &lt;a href=\"Zelifrax%20Wobblepox\"&gt;Zelifrax Wobblepox&lt;/a&gt;, and took the others captive on his personal world, &lt;a href=\"Dreadscar%20Rift\"&gt;Dreadscar Rift&lt;/a&gt;.\nJubeka, chained to a pillar, was eventually freed by the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Sixth&lt;/a&gt; of the Black Harvest alongside the other members but &lt;a href=\"Ritssyn%20Flamescowl\"&gt;Ritssyn Flamescowl&lt;/a&gt;, who had succumbed from his wounds. Together, they infiltrated the archives of Jagganoth and stole the &lt;a href=\"Tome%20of%20Blighted%20Implements\"&gt;Tome of Blighted Implements&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, they were discovered; Jagganoth, burning with rage, attacked them and knocked all the members of the Council to the ground, except for the Sixth who had managed to flee and return to &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Calydus\"&gt;Calydus&lt;/a&gt;, a demon that joined their cause.\nJubeka and the others were thus sent to the dreadlord &lt;a href=\"Mephistroth\"&gt;Mephistroth&lt;/a&gt; on the world of &lt;a href=\"Niskara\"&gt;Niskara&lt;/a&gt;. The Sixth, having since been named First of the Council of the Black Harvest, came for them and saved them once more. They returned to &lt;a href=\"Dreadscar%20Rift\"&gt;Dreadscar Rift&lt;/a&gt;, their newly conquered world and base of operations against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nJubeka participated in the summoning and binding of the &lt;a href=\"Eredar%20Twins\"&gt;Eredar Twins&lt;/a&gt; to the Council's will.\nLegionfall.\nJubeka was steadfast in keeping Kanrethad banished until Jagganoth took her prisoner. Kanrethad's fate has since become unknown, which troubles Jubeka until one day when she feels his presence in &lt;a href=\"Azsuna\"&gt;Azsuna&lt;/a&gt;. Jubeka imprisons a member of the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Green%20Flame\"&gt;Cult of the Green Flame&lt;/a&gt;, a group of fanatics in &lt;a href=\"Faronaar\"&gt;Faronaar&lt;/a&gt; lured by Kanrethad's power and seeking to be near him at any cost to share in it, who reveals to her that the cult is harnessing energy to break Kanrethad out of his banishment. Jubeka asks the Netherlord to steal the crystals the cult is planning to use to empower the ritual. At the cult's portal Kanrethad calls out to Jubeka from the other side, telling her not to let the Legion take him for he could not endure such a fate. It is then that Jubeka realizes that some of her friend remains in the demon he has become.\nAt the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, Kanrethad's twisted followers begin their ritual and the Black Harvest moves to intervene. Using the stolen fel crystals from earlier, the fel energy consuming Kanrethad is siphoned and he turns back into a human. Jubeka thanks the Netherlord, for the burden of guilt has been lifted from her shoulders and she never thought Kanrethad would be returned to them. She gathers the crystals used to absorb Kanrethad's fel energies, for if any were to break then the energy would go right back into him, and returns to Dreadscar Rift with the council and recovering Kanrethad.\nQuotes.\nHello, &lt;name&gt;.\nKanrethad's power is too great to allow him to be free. I'll ensure he stays banished, for as long as I exist.\nStill, a taste of the fel energies he is saturated with should cause no ill. Feel free to drain some for your own use. Should you ever grow tired of its effects, I can purge the fel energy from you, for a price.\nRelatives.\nShe may be related to &lt;a href=\"Grayson%20Shadowbreaker\"&gt;Grayson Shadowbreaker&lt;/a&gt;."}

The Archbishop &lt;a href=\"Alonsus%20Faol\"&gt;Alonsus Faol&lt;/a&gt; perceived that the pious &lt;a href=\"Brotherhood%20of%20Northshire\"&gt;Clerics of Northshire&lt;/a&gt;, who suffered such terrible attrition in the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, were ill-suited for the dangers of combat. Along with many of the surviving Clerics of Northshire, he sought those of only the greatest virtue among the &lt;a href=\"Knight%20%28Warcraft%20II%29\"&gt;knighthood&lt;/a&gt; of Lordaeron and tutored them in the ways of magic. Led by the crusading &lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther Lightbringer&lt;/a&gt;, it now rests upon these Paladins - christened the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; - to heal the wounds sustained in combat and to restore faith in the promise of freedom from &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;ish tyranny.\nSpells.\nAs the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;spirit of mankind&lt;/a&gt; is everywhere, so the Holy Vision of the Paladin extends to all corners of the land. The area unveiled by this incantation grants the Paladin knowledge of the terrain and of all those who may dwell there. When this spell dims, the Paladin maintains knowledge of the lands he has seen, although he loses sight of the denizens in these lands.\nAiding our brethren in times of pain and illness remains the fundamental concern of any within the holy &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Order&lt;/a&gt;. By focusing his spiritual powers, the Paladin can heal those who have been wounded in battle. While only one being at a time may be healed in this fashion, it serves to replenish the strength and courage of all who strive for victory against the unfeeling &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;s.\nCalling upon the forces of &lt;a href=\"light\"&gt;light&lt;/a&gt; and purity, the Paladin is able to dispel the &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20%28Warcraft%20II%29\"&gt;walking dead&lt;/a&gt; that plague the lands of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.

These creatures of Hades seem to gain strength in numbers, thus the greater number of undead that are exorcised within a group, the less actual damage each undead will take. This act is extremely taxing upon the Paladin, making it necessary for him to observe a period of rest before once again invoking this great power."}
{"id": "227869", "revid": "31509480", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=227869", "title": "Paladin (Warcraft III)", "text": "Although the Paladins were once loved and revered throughout the lands of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, they have since fallen on hard times. The entire &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Order of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; was disbanded for refusing to kill innocent townsfolk who were believed to be contaminated by the dreaded &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;Undead plague&lt;/a&gt;. Disenfranchised and driven from their former homes, the Paladins still work selflessly to protect &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;ity from the gnawing jaws of evil. Empowered by the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;, these mighty warriors brandish both warhammer and holy fire in battle against all who would trample the meek and innocent.\nHero names.\nGranis Darkhammer, Jorn the Redeemer, &lt;a href=\"Sage%20Truthbearer\"&gt;Sage Truthbearer&lt;/a&gt;, Malak the Avenger, &lt;a href=\"Gavinrad\"&gt;Gavinrad the Dire&lt;/a&gt;, Morlune the Mighty, &lt;a href=\"Agamand%23Warcraft%20III\"&gt;Agamand the True&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ballador%20the%20Bright\"&gt;Ballador the Bright&lt;/a&gt;, Manadar the Healer, Zann the Defender, &lt;a href=\"Aurius%20Rivendare%23Trivia\"&gt;Arius the Seeker&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Aurius%20Rivendare%23Trivia\"&gt;Aurrius the Pure&lt;/a&gt;, Karnwield the Seeker, Buzan the Fearless.\nInformation.\nThe Paladin is a melee hero but is not quite as powerful as the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Hunter%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Demon Hunter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blademaster%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Blademaster&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Mountain%20King%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Mountain King&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, he serves as a powerful support Hero because his Holy Light can restore large amounts of health which punishes players trying to aim one of your Heroes with sufficient micro skills. His Devotion Aura is also another powerful addition, especially in team matches where the extra armor can certainly come in handy in a hectic fight. \nAs a result of being a support hero, its best to hotkey him and be familiar with the Holy Light hotkey so that he can quickly heal units in a pinch.\nA Paladin will need an &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Archmage&lt;/a&gt; for support because while his Intelligence is moderate, his Holy Light has a very fast cooldown and he will run out of mana very quickly if he needs to quickly heal numerous units. The Archmage's Brilliance Aura helps alleviate part of this problem.\nHoly Light and Devotion Aura should always take the highest priority when training a Paladin because they benefit you the most in the long term compared to Divine Shield. Divine Shield only protects the Paladin for a brief amount of time and doesn't help any of your other units.\nThe quickest way to deal with a Paladin is to take him down quickly when he is at a low level. Most human players are unlikely to spend points into Divine Shield due to its lack of versatility. If he does have Divine Shield, then it's recommended to target him quickly while casting Silence or Soul Burn beforehand to prevent him from casting spells.\nIf silencing is not an option, try to burn the Paladin's mana away. This prevents him from using his spells as much as possible.\nSpells and abilities.\nHoly Ligh.\nThe Paladin cannot cast Holy Light on himself; however, another friendly Paladin may do so.\nHoly Light is much easier to use with Sub Groups. Simply group select units and hit tab until the Paladin's Holy Light button shows up. Left-click on the Holy Light button to target the spell, then left click on a damaged unit's portrait in the Sub Group. This will cause the Paladin to heal the unit without having to click on the unit itself. With practice you can quickly heal damaged units in battle, making this a very effective spell.\nIf the enemy tries to target a specific unit, you can just keep casting Holy Light on them while the rest of your units easily destroy them as punishment for trying to go for one or two of your units. Holy Light has a very fast cooldown and heals wonders when fully leveled.\nHoly Light is very useful early on when trying to level up. Have your units tank incoming damage from Creeps and let the Paladin use Holy Light on them to recover health. This allows you to take on harder creep camps with a smaller force.\nUse Holy Light on allied Heroes in team games. Players may ask for you to heal them, but you should be healing them anyways since Heroes are the main core of any player's army, and getting them killed would prevent them from taking experience which could be vital for future battles.\nHoly Light is also great against Undead Heroes such as the &lt;a href=\"Death%20Knight%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Death Knight&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dreadlord%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Dreadlord&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lich%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Lich&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pit%20Lord%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Pit Lord&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Ranger%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Dark Ranger&lt;/a&gt;. Combine it with the Mountain King's Storm Bolt to create a powerful Undead finisher.\nHoly Light can be empowered quite a bit, both as healing for your own units and as damage against Undead, when combined with the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Mage%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Blood Mage&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Mage%20%28Warcraft%20III%29%23Banish\"&gt;Banish&lt;/a&gt;. This combo is very nifty for damaging and healing units with a lot of HP, such as Heroes.\nivine Shield.\nDivine Shield is an invincibility spell, similar to the Invulnerability potions found from creeps and shops on specific maps. It allows the Paladin to avoid being struck by any attacks while active and is an excellent focus breaker as enemies cannot attack an invulnerable unit (since the editor classifies them as another unit type), forcing them to target other units. If the enemy tries targeting your Paladin, simply have him use Divine Shield. You can also use Invulnerability potions to cover the cooldown, though they won't last as long. Both the duration and cooldown increases as the spell is leveled up.\nDivine Shield cannot be deactivated.\nRun away until the spell wears off, or if the Paladin doesn't have a teleportation item, surround him (your units will automatically do so when attempting to attack invulnerable units), wait for the spell to wear off and kill him.\nDeotion Aura.\nDevotion helps units take less damage. It is very useful for groups of Footmen and Knights and even more useful for large team games where the Aura helps lots of units in battle on the team. Devotion is typically a side skill since the increased armor is more beneficial than the Paladin's survival since you can keep him away from the front lines to support his allies. The effects of Devotion Aura also stack with Inner Fire and Frost Armor.\nesurrection (Ultimate).\nResurrection is an incredibly powerful spell because it can allow up to 6 units to come back to life which is essentially giving you up to 6 free units without cost. The spell is best used when there are at least 6 units to raise. Note that the spell won't work on air units since they don't leave behind a corpse. For solo games where an air army is used, then you should skip Resurrection and go for a level 3 Devotion Aura or level 1 Divine Shield. \nResurrection, like Reanimate Dead, prioritizes high-level units over lower ones; &lt;a href=\"Knight%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Knight&lt;/a&gt;s would take higher priority over something like a &lt;a href=\"Peasant%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Peasant&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Footman%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Footmen&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf the slain units were from your ally, then the ally uses them as normal. The player's food cap can rise over the player's current amount (including going over 100), so you should be careful as reviving units may bring you or your allies over their food cap and cause upkeep problems or prevent them from training a desired unit.\nUndead players can use &lt;a href=\"Meat%20Wagon%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Meat Wagon&lt;/a&gt;s to remove the corpses or cast &lt;a href=\"Necromancer%20%28Warcraft%20III%29%23Raise%20Dead%20%28Autocast%29\"&gt;Raise&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Death%20Knight%20%28Warcraft%20III%29%23Animate%20Dead%20%28Ultimate%29\"&gt;Animate Dead&lt;/a&gt; to prevent the enemy from Resurrecting.\nManual description.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Archbishop\"&gt;Archbishop&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alonsus%20Faol\"&gt;Alonsus Faol&lt;/a&gt;, prior to the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, founded the Order of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;. The holy knights, or paladins, as they are commonly called, led the battle against the evil &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s and helped to save the lands of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; from ruin. Though it has been nearly fifteen years since the end of the Second War, the paladins still work selflessly to protect &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;ity from the gnawing jaws of evil. Empowered by the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;, these mighty warriors brandish both their warhammers and holy fire in the battle against all who would trample the meek and innocent."}

Already you fancy yourself one of the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knight\"&gt;Blood Knight&lt;/a&gt;s.\nIn time, you will earn your place among us. But first you must learn to harness and master the powers of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;, hone your skills at arms, and prove your worthiness.\nYou must be prepared to endure the derision, fear, and revulsion of those you're sworn to defend. So it is among those who can't comprehend the price of the great power that safeguards them. Keep your head high and your blade at the ready, &lt;name&gt;."}

{"id": "14089", "revid": "22514", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=14089", "title": "Paladin attributes", "text": "The base attributes of each race are standard and increase at predictable rates with leveling. Obtaining equipment with bonuses to the various attributes is essential to the paladin's development. Choosing the best attribute bonuses is a challenging and ongoing process. This article is a guide on Paladin attributes.\nStrength.\nStrength affects the base damage a Paladin can do with melee attacks and affects the amount of damage that can be blocked with a shield. The natural leveling of a Paladin enhances strength faster than agility, intellect, or spirit. Equipment that adds to strength will increase the damage done with each attack slightly. Retribution Paladins specced with &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Strength\"&gt;Divine Strength&lt;/a&gt; usually stack a lot of strength.\nAgility.\nAgility increases the melee critical hit chance and dodge. Point for point, critical strike rating is better for damage and dodge rating is better for tanking, but agility is still useful.\nStamina.\nStamina adds to the characters hit points (or health). Stamina is the other attribute that increases rapidly as the Paladin levels. Being able to absorb more damage is always a good thing for a Paladin. It is the key stat for tanking, and many level 80 tanks will stack pure stamina once they've reached the defense cap.\nIntellect.\nIntellect adds to the characters available mana pool, and increases spell critical strike chance. It is by far the best stat for holy paladins, since it contributes to sustained healing ability in several ways: the size of the initial mana pool, the amount of mana returned through &lt;a href=\"Replenishment\"&gt;Replenishment&lt;/a&gt;, and the mana returned through &lt;a href=\"Illumination%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Illumination (Classic)&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpirit.\nSpirit increases the regeneration rate of health and mana when not in combat. Spirit helps shorten downtime between fights. Paladins rarely have much downtime between fights due to self healing and Blessing of Wisdom, which accelerates mana regeneration. Unlike other casters, paladins do not have an ability that allows a percentage of out-of-combat mana regeneration to continue while fighting, so spirit is of very little use.\nNevertheless, since TBC, secondary attributes (e.g. spell damage, defense, critical strike rating, etc.) on the gear has become more important than ever before. Please refer to specific guides for priority of importantce for those stats.\nAttribute values at different levels.\nStarting attribute values depend on the race.\nHowever, attribute gains on later levels don't depend on the race. The only exception is spirit, since the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; race has &lt;a href=\"The%20Human%20Spirit\"&gt;The Human Spirit&lt;/a&gt; racial trait which increases their spirit by 10%.\nAlso, the &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Strength\"&gt;Divine Strength&lt;/a&gt; talent modifies strength by up to 15%, the &lt;a href=\"Sacred%20Duty%20%28former%20paladin%20ability%29\"&gt;Sacred Duty (former paladin ability)&lt;/a&gt; talent modifies stamina by up to 6%, the &lt;a href=\"Combat%20Expertise\"&gt;Combat Expertise&lt;/a&gt; talent modifies stamina by up to 6%, and the &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Intellect\"&gt;Divine Intellect&lt;/a&gt; talent modifies intellect by up to 10%. Base attributes include those modifications too. If a Paladin has both Sacred Duty and Combat Expertise, the base stamina modifiers stack via multiplication (for example, at maximum ranks codice_1)."}

The auras are area of effect buffs; they affect all party and raid members within 40 yards of the paladin. A paladin may only have one aura active at one time. They are free to cast, with the only cost being the &lt;a href=\"global%20cooldown\"&gt;global cooldown&lt;/a&gt;. As such, it is wise to always have one aura or another running. Auras persist through death.\nUsage.\nAs with all &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt; buffs, usage of Auras is highly situational, and it is unwise to always rely on a single aura for all situations. Indeed, switching auras in combat is frequently beneficial. However, one thing that may not be immediately obvious is that most auras (in fact, all except Crusader) only benefit a player that is actively under attack (usually your tank). To clarify, the added armor from Devotion Aura is only useful to your combat classes, if your tank is doing their job, the casters will not be under attack and will have no need for it. The same is true for Concentration Aura; if your casters are never attacked, the question of spell interruption will never arise.\nIf you are soloing, you of course have free choice over your aura. Popular choices are Devotion or Retribution, mostly depending on the enemy at the time. Concentration Aura is also useful.\nAvailable auras.\nThere are many different auras available to paladins:"}

You received a quest from that trainer. For &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s, the quest-giver was &lt;a href=\"Duthorian%20Rall\"&gt;Duthorian Rall&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;; for &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tiza%20Battleforge\"&gt;Tiza Battleforge&lt;/a&gt; upstairs in the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Mysteries\"&gt;Hall of Mysteries&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;, and for &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jol\"&gt;Jol&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20Lights\"&gt;Vault of Lights&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt;.\nLevel 12 &lt;a href=\"The%20First%20Trial\"&gt;The First Trial&lt;/a&gt; (Redemption spell).\nThe reward for this quest series was the resurrection spell, &lt;a href=\"Redemption\"&gt;Redemption&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe quest giver for this, and other quests, was &lt;a href=\"Knight-Lord%20Bloodvalor\"&gt;Knight-Lord Bloodvalor&lt;/a&gt;. Although technically not a Paladin trainer, he is in their building, in the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Blood\"&gt;Hall of Blood&lt;/a&gt; section of &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt;, just to the north of the northernmost entrance into the building.\nLevel 20 &lt;a href=\"The%20Tome%20of%20Valor\"&gt;The Tome of Valor&lt;/a&gt; (Sense Undead, Bastion of Stormwind and Verigan's Fist).\nThe rewards for this quest series was the ability &lt;a href=\"Sense%20Undead\"&gt;Sense Undead&lt;/a&gt;, the shield &lt;a href=\"Bastion%20of%20Stormwind\"&gt;Bastion of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; and an incredibly nice two-handed mace, &lt;a href=\"Verigan%27s%20Fist\"&gt;Verigan's Fist&lt;/a&gt;.\nAn NPC near the trainer in your capital city provided you with a volume, the Tome of Valor. Using the tome to start the quest, you were redirected to talk to your trainer. The next quest would take you to &lt;a href=\"Westfall%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Longshore\"&gt;Longshore&lt;/a&gt;, on the far southwestern coast.\nYou had to speak with &lt;a href=\"Daphne%20Stilwell\"&gt;Daphne Stilwell&lt;/a&gt;, accept her &lt;a href=\"The%20Tome%20of%20Valor%20%283%29\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt;, and then defend her from several waves of attacking &lt;a href=\"Defias\"&gt;Defias&lt;/a&gt;. This quest could be soloed at level 20 with great care, but bringing a friend would make it considerably easier. Daphne could also be healed by your healing spells. You then had to return to &lt;a href=\"Duthorian%20Rall\"&gt;Duthorian Rall&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; to learn &lt;a href=\"Sense%20Undead\"&gt;Sense Undead&lt;/a&gt; and receive the &lt;a href=\"Bastion%20of%20Stormwind\"&gt;Bastion of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt this point, your trainer directed you to speak with &lt;a href=\"Jordan%20Stilwell\"&gt;Jordan Stilwell&lt;/a&gt; outside the gates of &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;. Jordan gave you the quest &lt;a href=\"The%20Test%20of%20Righteousness%20%281%29\"&gt;The Test of Righteousness (1)&lt;/a&gt; to gather the components to make the rare two-handed mace &lt;a href=\"Verigan%27s%20Fist\"&gt;Verigan's Fist&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Jordan%27s%20Weapon%20Notes\"&gt;note&lt;/a&gt; provided the details on where and how to get each of the four pieces.\nOnce you provided all four items to Jordan Stilwell, he crafted the mace for you.\nLevel 20 &lt;a href=\"The%20Second%20Trial\"&gt;The Second Trial&lt;/a&gt; (Sense Undead, Blood-Tempered Ranseur).\nFor this quest, &lt;a href=\"Knight-Lord%20Bloodvalor\"&gt;Knight-Lord Bloodvalor&lt;/a&gt; sent you to talk to another of the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knight\"&gt;Blood Knight&lt;/a&gt;s to the north of &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Master%20Kelerun%20Bloodmourn\"&gt;Master Kelerun Bloodmourn&lt;/a&gt;. The meeting point was to the north, through the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Silvermoon\"&gt;Ruins of Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt; and then east just before the bridge to &lt;a href=\"Sunstrider%20Isle\"&gt;Sunstrider Isle&lt;/a&gt;. Bloodmourn directed you to use a &lt;a href=\"Harbinger%20of%20the%20Second%20Trial\"&gt;crystal&lt;/a&gt; and to defeat four Blood Knight Champions one after the other. Each of these Knights fought with a different aspect of the paladin styles. For instance, one used &lt;a href=\"Paladin%23Retribution\"&gt;retribution&lt;/a&gt; spells with a two-handed weapon, while another used a shield and sword and used &lt;a href=\"Paladin%23Protection\"&gt;protection&lt;/a&gt; abilities. The fights were not particularly difficult despite their titles of champions and the fact that they could heal themselves. After defeating the champions you were sent back to Bloodvalor and received the &lt;a href=\"Sense%20Undead\"&gt;Sense Undead&lt;/a&gt; ability.\n&lt;a href=\"Knight-Lord%20Bloodvalor\"&gt;Knight-Lord Bloodvalor&lt;/a&gt; then gave you the quest &lt;a href=\"The%20Path%20of%20the%20Adept\"&gt;The Path of the Adept&lt;/a&gt; to gather the components required to make the rare two-handed polearm &lt;a href=\"Blood-Tempered%20Ranseur\"&gt;Blood-Tempered Ranseur&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Bloodvalor%27s%20Notes\"&gt;note&lt;/a&gt; provided the details on where and how to get each of the four pieces.\nOn your return to Bloodvalor with the materials, he then sent you to &lt;a href=\"Bemarrin\"&gt;Bemarrin&lt;/a&gt;, a blacksmithing trainer just outside across the street. He then forged the weapon for you.\nYou were rewarded with your paladin weapon, the &lt;a href=\"Blood-Tempered%20Ranseur\"&gt;Blood-Tempered Ranseur&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the rank of Adept in the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knight\"&gt;Blood Knight&lt;/a&gt;s order.\nLevel 40 &lt;a href=\"The%20Tome%20of%20Nobility%20%282%29\"&gt;The Tome of Nobility&lt;/a&gt; (Summon Warhorse).\nThis quest simply consisted in speaking with &lt;a href=\"Duthorian%20Rall\"&gt;Duthorian Rall&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt;. After that he would teach you the &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Warhorse\"&gt;Summon Warhorse&lt;/a&gt; spell. With &lt;a href=\"patch%202.4.3\"&gt;patch 2.4.3&lt;/a&gt; the quest was removed and the warhorse was instead added as a learnable &lt;a href=\"spell\"&gt;spell&lt;/a&gt; from any paladin trainer.\nIt is notable that until &lt;a href=\"patch%204.0.3a\"&gt;patch 4.0.3a&lt;/a&gt; draenei paladin were stuck riding &lt;a href=\"horse\"&gt;horse&lt;/a&gt;s instead of &lt;a href=\"elekk\"&gt;elekk&lt;/a&gt;s, until the &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Exarch%27s%20Elekk\"&gt;Summon Exarch's Elekk&lt;/a&gt; spell was added.\nLevel 40 &lt;a href=\"The%20Thalassian%20Warhorse\"&gt;The Thalassian Warhorse&lt;/a&gt; (Summon Warhorse).\nThis quest simply consisted in speaking with &lt;a href=\"Knight-Lord%20Bloodvalor\"&gt;Knight-Lord Bloodvalor&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Blood\"&gt;Hall of Blood&lt;/a&gt;.

With &lt;a href=\"patch%202.4.3\"&gt;patch 2.4.3&lt;/a&gt; the quest was made unncecesary and the warhorse was added as a learnable &lt;a href=\"spell\"&gt;spell&lt;/a&gt; from any paladin trainer.\nIt is notable that in &lt;a href=\"patch%205.0.4\"&gt;patch 5.0.4&lt;/a&gt; blood elf paladin got their own version of the spell: &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Thalassian%20Warhorse\"&gt;Summon Thalassian Warhorse&lt;/a&gt;.\nLevel 50 &lt;a href=\"Forging%20the%20Mightstone\"&gt;Forging the Mightstone&lt;/a&gt; (Holy Mightstone + Choice of Rare Reward).\nThis was a quest introduced in &lt;a href=\"Patch%201.8.0\"&gt;Patch 1.8.0&lt;/a&gt;. Most other classes had a similar quest which gave a rare reward out of three choices.\nIt started from &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Grayson%20Shadowbreaker\"&gt;Lord Grayson Shadowbreaker&lt;/a&gt;, sending you to &lt;a href=\"Chillwind%20Camp\"&gt;Chillwind Camp&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Plaguelands%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Western Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt; to assist &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Ashlam%20Valorfist\"&gt;Commander Ashlam Valorfist&lt;/a&gt;. The main objective was to collect 20 &lt;a href=\"Minion%27s%20Scourgestone\"&gt;Minion's Scourgestone&lt;/a&gt;s, simply by equipping an &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn%20Commission\"&gt;Argent Dawn Commission&lt;/a&gt; and killing undead at &lt;a href=\"Sorrow%20Hill\"&gt;Sorrow Hill&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"scourgestone\"&gt;scourgestone&lt;/a&gt;s then had to be &lt;a href=\"Dispelling%20Evil\"&gt;given&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"High%20Priest%20Thel%27danis\"&gt;High Priest Thel'danis&lt;/a&gt; who &lt;a href=\"Inert%20Scourgestone\"&gt;purged&lt;/a&gt; them.\nFrom there, Ashlam sent you to the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Atal%27Hakkar%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Sunken Temple&lt;/a&gt; to retrieve 6 voodoo feathers of different colors. These feathers were dropped by the 6 seal guardians (undead &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s) located in the Upper Balconies of the temple. The same feathers were required for similar &lt;a href=\"Warrior\"&gt;Warrior&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Warlock\"&gt;Warlock&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shaman\"&gt;Shaman&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Priest\"&gt;Priest&lt;/a&gt; quests, so finding a group to kill the trolls was not a problem.\nReturning the 6 feathers to Ashlam made it possible to use their magic and turn the evil of one stone against itself, thus creating an &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Mightstone%23Classic\"&gt;Holy Mightstone#Classic&lt;/a&gt;, which was given to you with one of the following:\nLevel 50 &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Evil\"&gt;Ancient Evil&lt;/a&gt; (Scourgebane).\nThe quest started at either &lt;a href=\"Champion%20Bachi\"&gt;Champion Bachi&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Champion%20Cyssa%20Dawnrose\"&gt;Champion Cyssa Dawnrose&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;, who sent you to the &lt;a href=\"Bulwark\"&gt;Bulwark&lt;/a&gt; to meet with &lt;a href=\"Mehlar%20Dawnblade\"&gt;Mehlar Dawnblade&lt;/a&gt;. Once there, you were directed to &lt;a href=\"Prove%20Your%20Hatred\"&gt;prove your hatred&lt;/a&gt; by taking vengeance on the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. Notably by having a chat with the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Officer%20Garush\"&gt;Argent Officer Garush&lt;/a&gt; and acquiring an &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn%20Commission\"&gt;Argent Dawn Commission&lt;/a&gt;, then returning to Mehlar with 20 &lt;a href=\"Minion%27s%20Scourgestone\"&gt;Minion's Scourgestone&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAfter returning the &lt;a href=\"scourgestone\"&gt;scourgestone&lt;/a&gt;s to Mehlar, he crushed them and &lt;a href=\"Wisdom%20of%20the%20Banshee%20Queen\"&gt;asked&lt;/a&gt; you to bring the remains to Lady &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, who had the knowledge of how to turn these &lt;a href=\"Scourgestone%20Fragments\"&gt;fragments&lt;/a&gt; into a weapon that could be used against the Scourge.\nSylvanas wasn't very happy to see you with those crushed stones, but knew that you were fuelled by the same vengeance as her. She sent you to the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Atal%27Hakkar\"&gt;Temple of Atal'Hakkar&lt;/a&gt;. In there you needed to kill &lt;a href=\"Atal%27alarion\"&gt;Atal'alarion&lt;/a&gt; who was carrying a &lt;a href=\"Putrid%20Vine\"&gt;Putrid Vine&lt;/a&gt;. By returning it to Mehlar, he was able to forge the vine and fragments into &lt;a href=\"Scourgebane\"&gt;Scourgebane&lt;/a&gt;.\nLevel 60 &lt;a href=\"The%20Light%20and%20How%20To%20Swing%20It\"&gt;The Light and How To Swing It&lt;/a&gt; (Royal Seal of Eldre'Thalas).\nAfter finding this &lt;a href=\"The%20Light%20and%20How%20to%20Swing%20It\"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; written by &lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther the Lightbringer&lt;/a&gt; himself, you were expected to return it to &lt;a href=\"Lorekeeper%20Mykos\"&gt;Lorekeeper Mykos&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Athenaeum%20%28Dire%20Maul%29\"&gt;Athenaeum&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Dire%20Maul\"&gt;Dire Maul&lt;/a&gt; and be rewarded with a &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Seal%20of%20Eldre%27Thalas%20%28Paladin%29\"&gt;Royal Seal of Eldre'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;.\nLevel 60 &lt;a href=\"Judgment%20and%20Redemption\"&gt;Summoning the Charger&lt;/a&gt; (Summon Charger).\n&lt;a href=\"Lord%20Grayson%20Shadowbreaker\"&gt;Lord Grayson Shadowbreaker&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; gave you two quest series: one to get an &lt;a href=\"Exorcism%20Censer\"&gt;Exorcism Censer&lt;/a&gt;, one to get sufficient &lt;a href=\"Blessed%20Arcanite%20Barding\"&gt;barding&lt;/a&gt;. Once you had both items, you received a short quest to obtain the &lt;a href=\"Divination%20Scryer\"&gt;Divination Scryer&lt;/a&gt;. You then had to use the scryer in &lt;a href=\"Scholomance%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Scholomance&lt;/a&gt; to summon monsters to fight, at the end of which you obtained your &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Charger\"&gt;Summon Charger&lt;/a&gt; spell. Competing the questline awards the &lt;a href=\"Charger%20%28achievement%29\"&gt;Charger (achievement)&lt;/a&gt; achievement.\nThe Fight.\nAll party members had to be in the room before placing the Scryer because the doors then closed. Waves of mobs spawned, each requiring a particular Seal to be used on them in order to defeat them. A &lt;a href=\"Judgment\"&gt;Judgment&lt;/a&gt; used with the appropriate Seal would release a strong AoE effect against the mobs and/or stun them:\nAfter the last wave of mobs, the &lt;a href=\"Death%20Knight%20Darkreaver\"&gt;Death Knight Darkreaver&lt;/a&gt; appeared. There was no break between the last mob of the final ghost-wave and Darkreaver. After slaying him &lt;a href=\"Darkreaver%27s%20Fallen%20Charger\"&gt;Darkreaver's Fallen Charger&lt;/a&gt; appeared. The Death Knight had the &lt;a href=\"Charger%27s%20Lost%20Soul\"&gt;Charger's Lost Soul&lt;/a&gt; on his body and bringing it back to the horse redeemed it and made it your mount, teaching you the &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Charger\"&gt;Summon Charger&lt;/a&gt; spell. Congratulations!\nBringing multiple paladins to the quest was a great idea, and caution had to be taken because wiping during this fight meant having to go back to Stormwind to get another Scryer and reset the instance, as the door to the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Ossuary\"&gt;Great Ossuary&lt;/a&gt; would remain closed. This was not a bug; Blizzard viewed this as a necessarily difficult challenge, with the reset an appropriate \"punishment\" for failure.\n&lt;a href=\"Patch%201.12.1\"&gt;Patch 1.12.1&lt;/a&gt; updated the quest so that the Charger also came with the &lt;a href=\"Journeyman\"&gt;Journeyman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Riding\"&gt;Riding&lt;/a&gt; skill. &lt;a href=\"Patch%203.2\"&gt;Patch 3.2&lt;/a&gt; removed the quest requirement completely and made the Charger mount learnable from a trainer at 40.\nLevel 60 &lt;a href=\"True%20Masters%20of%20the%20Light%20%283%29\"&gt;True Masters of the Light&lt;/a&gt; (Summon Charger, Blood Knight Tabard).\n&lt;a href=\"Knight-Lord%20Bloodvalor\"&gt;Knight-Lord Bloodvalor&lt;/a&gt; started this quest-chain with &lt;a href=\"A%20Summons%20from%20Lord%20Solanar\"&gt;a summons&lt;/a&gt;, and sent you to talk to &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Solanar%20Bloodwrath\"&gt;Lord Solanar Bloodwrath&lt;/a&gt; (prior to &lt;a href=\"patch%202.4\"&gt;patch 2.4&lt;/a&gt;, it was &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt; herself).

They originally started out as &lt;a href=\"cleric\"&gt;cleric&lt;/a&gt;s under the &lt;a href=\"Clerics%20of%20Northshire\"&gt;Holy Order of Northshire Clerics&lt;/a&gt;, carrying the mission of spreading the wisdom of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt; across Azeroth. When the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; invaded the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; through the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, the clerics rushed to the battlefield to fend off the beasts. Although wielding powerful magic, the clerics were unprepared for war and suffered heavy losses. At the end of the war, Archbishop &lt;a href=\"Alonsus%20Faol\"&gt;Alonsus Faol&lt;/a&gt; and his apprentice &lt;a href=\"Uther\"&gt;Uther&lt;/a&gt; founded the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;. This order trained clerics and &lt;a href=\"knight\"&gt;knight&lt;/a&gt;s in both the ways of war and divinity. They were crucial in the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;'s victory in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, both healing friends and crushing foes on the battlefield.\nThe Silver Hand suffered heavily during the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;Plague of Undeath&lt;/a&gt; and were nearly wiped out. Uther himself was killed by his own apprentice, &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;, who had become a &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;. In the order's destruction, the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt; were born. The Silver Hand slowly recovered, aiding the Alliance (and slightly the new Horde) against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, it joined forces with the Argent Dawn to form the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt;, led by the veteran &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt;, traveling to &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; to finish off the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; once and for all. The Argent Crusade further teamed up with the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; to form the &lt;a href=\"Ashen%20Verdict\"&gt;Ashen Verdict&lt;/a&gt; and were ultimately successful in their mission.\nNew human paladins originating from &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; serve the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. The class mounts for human paladins are &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Warhorse\"&gt;Summon Warhorse&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Charger\"&gt;Summon Charger&lt;/a&gt;.\nDwarves.\n&lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20dwarf\"&gt;Ironforge dwarves&lt;/a&gt;, closely allied with the Humans (who were the ones that introduced them to the Holy Light), have developed strong bonds, and some of them joined the Knights of the Silver Hand. Part of their introduction into the Silver Hand was also the order's need to replace paladins lost during the Third War (although they had previously accepted a few dwarven paladins as far back as the Second War, it was uncommon). It was also the dwarves' leader &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;King Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; who forged the &lt;a href=\"Ashbringer\"&gt;Ashbringer&lt;/a&gt;.\nNew dwarf paladins serve the Knights of the Silver Hand just like the human paladins. Dwarf Paladins share the human Paladin class mounts &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Warhorse\"&gt;Summon Warhorse&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Charger\"&gt;Summon Charger&lt;/a&gt;.\nDraenei.\nThe &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; were introduced to the Light by the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; while sailing across the cosmos on board &lt;a href=\"Oshu%27gun\"&gt;Oshu'gun&lt;/a&gt;. Fleeing from the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; that consumed their original home, &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;, they were blessed with Light-given knowledge and power by the naaru. Planning to join the draenei with other forces in the cosmos that would stand against the Burning Legion, the naaru planned to create a single unstoppable army of the Light. The draenei vowed to honor the Light and uphold the naaru's altruistic ideals. The power of the Light is embedded in the draenei so deeply that all of them can call upon it through &lt;a href=\"Gift%20of%20the%20Naaru\"&gt;Gift of the Naaru&lt;/a&gt;, regardless of class. Today, draenei paladins become &lt;a href=\"Vindicator\"&gt;Vindicator&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Hand%20of%20Argus\"&gt;Hand of Argus&lt;/a&gt;. Their class mounts are &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Exarch%27s%20Elekk\"&gt;Summon Exarch's Elekk&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Great%20Exarch%27s%20Elekk\"&gt;Summon Great Exarch's Elekk&lt;/a&gt;.\nBecause of their strong connection to the Burning Legion, in addition to having landed on Azeroth after the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;Plague of Undeath&lt;/a&gt; gushed across &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, draenei are likely more acquainted with &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s rather than &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;. This is probably slightly differing them from human and dwarf paladins, which are used to fight the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; instead.\nDraenei paladins are also using paladin hammers, but with a twist. While the hammers wielded by humans and dwarves are made of metal, draenei ones are made of crystals. In art, most draenei paladins are using a hammer similar to &lt;a href=\"Hammer%20of%20the%20Naaru\"&gt;Hammer of the Naaru&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Lightforged%20draenei\"&gt;Lightforged draenei&lt;/a&gt;, a race empowered by the Light, can naturally be paladins.\nHorde.\nBlood elves.\n&lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;Blood elves&lt;/a&gt; were once &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; allied with the humans like the dwarves. Like the two others, high elves also believed in the Holy Light. A few were members of the Silver Hand, such as &lt;a href=\"Mehlar%20Dawnblade\"&gt;Mehlar Dawnblade&lt;/a&gt;, while others belonged to the high elven &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Guard%20%28Quel%27Thalas%29\"&gt;Royal Guard&lt;/a&gt;. The high elves began to distance themselves from Light worship after the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, during which &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; came under the brutal attack of the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. The survivors, now calling themselves blood elves, came to view the Light (which many believed had abandoned their homeland in its hour of greatest need) with contempt.\nNo longer willing to obey the Holy Light's edicts, sin'dorei paladins bound it to their will instead by using the divine energies of &lt;a href=\"M%27uru\"&gt;M'uru&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt;. M'uru was the sole guardian of &lt;a href=\"Tempest%20Keep\"&gt;Tempest Keep&lt;/a&gt; after it landed in &lt;a href=\"Netherstorm\"&gt;Netherstorm&lt;/a&gt; and brought most of the naaru present in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; there. After &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;'s failed attempt at destroying the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; returned to Outland in order to create a new haven for his magic-addicted people. He and his forces assaulted Tempest Keep and seized M'uru, sending it back to &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt; for the elves to feed on its powers. This created the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knights\"&gt;Blood Knights&lt;/a&gt;, a military force of blood elf paladins similar to the Silver Hand. The class mounts for the Blood Knights are &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Thalassian%20Warhorse\"&gt;Summon Thalassian Warhorse&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Thalassian%20Charger\"&gt;Summon Thalassian Charger&lt;/a&gt;.\nLater, Kael'thas stole M'uru once more, spiriting him away to the defiled &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;. Bereft of a power source, the Blood Knight leader, &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt;, sought the forgiveness of the naaru's leader, &lt;a href=\"A%27dal\"&gt;A'dal&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt;. Pledging themselves to the defeat of the Legion and the restoration of Silvermoon, the Blood Knights fought alongside the &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Sun%20Offensive\"&gt;Shattered Sun Offensive&lt;/a&gt; to relieve the Sunwell. M'uru, now a darkened &lt;a href=\"void\"&gt;void&lt;/a&gt; entity, was killed during the battle, though his heart was used to revitalize the exhausted Sunwell, recreating it as a fount of both holy and &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; energies from which blood elf paladins now draw their power. This act wrought on a new and more harmonious perspective of the Light for some of the elves, including Liadrin herself.\nThe Blood Knight headquarters (the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Blood\"&gt;Hall of Blood&lt;/a&gt;) can be found within Silvermoon. New blood elf paladins become members of the order (initiation begins at level 12) during their class-specific questing, which awards them a &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knight%20Tabard\"&gt;Blood Knight Tabard&lt;/a&gt; and a weapon of choice.\nTauren.\nWith the Cataclysm expansion, &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; are also able to become paladins. Their order is known as the &lt;a href=\"Sunwalkers\"&gt;Sunwalkers&lt;/a&gt;, and is made up of tauren who worship &lt;a href=\"An%27she\"&gt;An'she&lt;/a&gt;, the sun. Apparently, their order came to be when some of them wondered if it was possible to drain the power of light from the sun, similar to how &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"priests\"&gt;priests&lt;/a&gt; get their power from the moon. &lt;a href=\"Aponi%20Brightmane\"&gt;Aponi Brightmane&lt;/a&gt; seems to be the first tauren paladin. Tauren Paladins have &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Sunwalker%20Kodo\"&gt;Summon Sunwalker Kodo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Great%20Sunwalker%20Kodo\"&gt;Summon Great Sunwalker Kodo&lt;/a&gt; as their class mounts.\nZandalari trolls.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Empire\"&gt;Zandalari Empire&lt;/a&gt; worship and draw power from the &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt; and their paladins are called &lt;a href=\"prelate\"&gt;prelate&lt;/a&gt;s. The &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20prelates\"&gt;Zandalari prelates&lt;/a&gt; specifically draw their power from &lt;a href=\"Rezan\"&gt;Rezan&lt;/a&gt;, holy &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt; of kings and queens. Only children who show great prowess in combat at an early age are taken into the holy order to train to become prelates. Following the death of Rezan at &lt;a href=\"Zul\"&gt;Zul&lt;/a&gt;'s hand, few of them remain and their power is diminished. Thanks to Queen &lt;a href=\"Talanji\"&gt;Talanji&lt;/a&gt;'s help, the prelates have regained their power and connection with the Light.\nOther races.\nHigh elf.\n&lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;High elf&lt;/a&gt; paladins are rare, but do exist. &lt;a href=\"Rulen%20Lightsreap\"&gt;Rulen Lightsreap&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Champion%20Isimode\"&gt;Champion Isimode&lt;/a&gt; are two such &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt; serving the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Covenant\"&gt;Silver Covenant&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Enclave\"&gt;Silver Enclave&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Tournament%20Grounds\"&gt;Argent Tournament Grounds&lt;/a&gt; respectively. Before the &lt;a href=\"Third%20war\"&gt;Third war&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mehlar%20Dawnblade\"&gt;Mehlar Dawnblade&lt;/a&gt; was a paladin pupil of the legendary &lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther the Lightbringer&lt;/a&gt;, and a veteran of many battles against the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;.\nHalf-elf.\nHalf-elves may become paladins, although the only well-known example is the &lt;a href=\"half-elf\"&gt;half-quel'dorei&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Arator\"&gt;Arator&lt;/a&gt;.\nNight elf.\n&lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;Night elf&lt;/a&gt; paladins are very rare, with only a few being seen in game. &lt;a href=\"Delas%20Moonfang\"&gt;Delas Moonfang&lt;/a&gt; is a priestess who is learning the ways of a paladin, where her uncle &lt;a href=\"Nerus%20Moonfang\"&gt;Nerus Moonfang&lt;/a&gt; is an ancient night elf ghost who has paladin abilities, though he's never directly stated to be a paladin. Likewise, &lt;a href=\"Alynblaze\"&gt;Alynblaze&lt;/a&gt; is also an old night elf ghost with paladin abilities, and &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Azshara's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;s used similar abilities as well. If these are in fact paladins rather than some similar but distinct group, it is unknown how the ancient elves became paladins, but it is believed by &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt; is a Naaru. However, despite the addition of these characters in \"\", night elf paladins are still unplayable.\nStarting attributes.\n&lt;a href=\"Racial%20traits\"&gt;Racial traits&lt;/a&gt; make a small difference in gameplay, but for most players, these are not significant enough to make one choice better than the rest. Each race has at least one trait that paladins will find beneficial. The important thing is to develop a character who you will enjoy playing.\nAlliance.\nDraenei get a 1% higher chance to hit with all attacks and spells, and have a mana-free heal in &lt;a href=\"Gift%20of%20the%20Naaru\"&gt;Gift of the Naaru&lt;/a&gt;. Dwarves enjoy a 1% increase to their Expertise when using a one- or two-handed Mace, which also makes it easier to hit enemies. The dwarves' &lt;a href=\"Stoneform\"&gt;Stoneform&lt;/a&gt; helps with survivability by reducing incoming damage. Humans get a 1% bonus to Expertise when using Maces or Swords, and &lt;a href=\"The%20Human%20Spirit\"&gt;The Human Spirit&lt;/a&gt; improves mana regeneration.\nHorde.\nThe tauren &lt;a href=\"War%20Stomp\"&gt;War Stomp&lt;/a&gt; stuns nearby enemies, which is useful for interrupting spellcasting and mitigating damage. Tauren also have great &lt;a href=\"Endurance\"&gt;Endurance&lt;/a&gt;, and benefit from a higher health pool. Blood elves can also interrupt enemies with &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Torrent\"&gt;Arcane Torrent&lt;/a&gt;. Though this is only useful against spellcasters, it can also be used to quickly restore a small amount of mana.\nIn the RPG.\n&lt;a href=\"Human\"&gt;Human&lt;/a&gt;s began the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;, and they remain the bulk of its membership. They are proud of the paladins' contribution to the Second and Third Wars, though they are shamed at Arthas' betrayal. After such an enormous breach of trust, the paladins have resolved anew to eliminate all traces of corruption in their ranks. Many see humans as the quintessential paladins. The iconic human paladin marches into combat, cloak flowing, hammer pounding, and faith unwavering.\nBows and guns are for cowards, and the human paladin disdains them. He is not proficient with any ranged weapons. However, paladins have a long history of hammer fighting, and they respect the dwarves' progress in this area. Human paladins are proficient with the dwarven battle hammer.\n&lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20Clan\"&gt;Wildhammer Clan&lt;/a&gt; paladins and priests of the Holy Light may exist, but are about as rare as Ironforge druids.\nThe few high elf paladins and priests proved invaluable in the Third War."}

They were once found on the main universe's &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt; recruited them into the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; to form the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;-worshipping &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer clan&lt;/a&gt;. Many Pale orcs still plague the &lt;a href=\"Draenor%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;alternate Draenor&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Pale are wretched creatures who hate the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; and despise all that is good and holy, hiding beneath the ground and plotting against the innocent and those who dwell on the surface. Dangerous and disturbing, the pale orcs are little more than husks of barely living flesh bent by dark magics. They are expert scavengers and are known to eat their victims alive. Many have a close kinship with spiders.\nBackground.\nOrigins.\nWhen young &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; from around the world come of age, they make a pilgrimage to the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20the%20Elements%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Throne of Elements&lt;/a&gt; to seek the blessings of the &lt;a href=\"elemental%20spirit\"&gt;elemental spirit&lt;/a&gt;s. The entire journey is filled with risk, but the ceremony itself is the most dangerous time of an orc's life. They enter trances to attune their minds to the elements. Some orcs are found worthy; others are not. In the act of reaching beyond the veil of the physical world, some would-be shamans even find themselves communing with dark forces. These poor souls accidentally glimpse a realm beyond Draenor, the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;, and what they see drives them insane. The survivors are exiled from their clans and forced to live in the caverns below &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt; in seclusion. White skulls are tattooed on their faces, marking them as \"dead\" to their people.\nOver the generations, the number of exiled shaman increased. When the \"&lt;a href=\"Genedar\"&gt;Genedar&lt;/a&gt;\" and &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; crashed on Draenor, the small society of underground orcs took notice. They expanded their tunnels beneath &lt;a href=\"Oshu%27gun\"&gt;Oshu'gun&lt;/a&gt;, the crashed ship's remains, to investigate the newcomers. In time, they tapped into the Void energies from the fallen &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"K%27ure\"&gt;K'ure&lt;/a&gt; within Oshu'gun that bled from its body and seeped into the ground. Through the study of this power, the outcasts began communing with the &lt;a href=\"void%20lord\"&gt;void lord&lt;/a&gt;s, bombarding them with visions of the apocalypse and revealing the secrets of using shadow magic. The influx of Void energies gradually turned the exiles' skin a sickly white.\nThe Twilight's Hammer.\nTwo hundred years after the draenei crashed, the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt; was rising on Draenor. As they did so, the Pale thrived in catacombs beneath Nagrand. Their dark power rivaled even &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; magic in potency, and rumors of the Pale and their otherworldly abilities eventually reached &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;. Though he paid little heed to the stories, his master, the &lt;a href=\"eredar\"&gt;eredar&lt;/a&gt; lord &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;, was intrigued. Because Kil'jaeden pressed Gul'dan to ensure victory over the draenei at any cost, that meant investigating the Pale to determine if their magic could strengthen the Horde. Gul'dan sent his apprentice &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt; to investigate the Pale, and if they proved as mighty as the rumors claimed, to bring them into the Horde.\nCho'gall stormed into the &lt;a href=\"Underpale\"&gt;Underpale&lt;/a&gt; expecting a fight, but found none. The Pale did not resist his intrusion for they were eager to share their prophecy of doom: the &lt;a href=\"Hour%20of%20Twilight\"&gt;Hour of Twilight&lt;/a&gt;, a time when the shadow would envelop the universe and snuff out all life in existence. Cho'gall had little interest in their prophecy but was very interested in their unfamiliar shadow magic. To win the Pale over, Cho'gall used their beliefs to his advantage and claimed that Horde was a weapon by which they could bring about the Hour of Twilight. The Pale reveled in the opportunity to serve as agents of the apocalypse. They committed themselves to the Horde and formed a new clan: the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer%20clan\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer clan&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs he too learned to master shadow magic, Cho'gall would see the truth in the Pale's prophecy. It would take him many years, but he would eventually devote himself to their quest.\nFirst War.\nEventually, the Horde traveled to another world called &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and entered &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;a war&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;. As the war raged, the Twilight's Hammer became a problem for &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt;. The Pale were prone to disobeying orders and too many wandered off, never to be seen again. Blackhand considered making an example of them and wiping the entire clan out, but Cho'gall intervened; so far, he had only been the Twilight's Hammer's de facto leader, and he offered to become their official chieftain to keep them in line. Blackhand let him try, and was pleasantly surprised when Cho'gall was able to make the Pale into obedient, effective soldiers almost overnight.\nCho'gall's success was in his understanding of the Pale and their beliefs. They worshiped the powers of the Void, and the moment they had arrived on Azeroth they felt the Void call out louder and clearer than they ever had before. The Twilight's Hammer had been hearing the whispers of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s, ancient evils imprisoned deep within the earth that served the void lords. Discovering them had overwhelmed the Pale, driving them into a state of pure ecstasy. It was seen by the clan as a sign of destiny, that they had found the place where they belonged: the place where they would bring about the Hour of Twilight. As for Cho'gall, while he had believed the Void was a force, he had cared little at first for his clan's mad ravings about dark gods. But now, he had proof they existed. He agreed to help the Pale and brought them under control with a simple notion: the Hour of Twilight was not far off, and the Horde's success was the best way to bring it to fruition. Until then, they had to keep up appearances to Blackhand and obey their true masters in secret. The Pale agreed, and the Old Gods seemed pleased with the Horde's lust for war and destruction, so it was no great sacrifice to proceed with the conquest of the world.\nAs the weeks passed and Cho'gall attuned himself to the Old Gods, he branded the Twilight's Hammer's prophecies onto the skin of the Pale orcs. He then cut off their flesh to form pages, making a book that codified the teachings of the Void: the \"&lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Canticle\"&gt;Twilight Canticle&lt;/a&gt;\". The book would become a source of power and motivation for the followers of the Old Gods for decades.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nIn the alternate universe, the pale orcs draw on the power of and says that they are the key to subjugating him. Cho'gall, referred to as \"the master\", has taught the Pale how to use the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; and through it enslave &lt;a href=\"furies\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt;s. After siphoning K'ure's power, Cho'gall led the pale orcs to attack the &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt; capital, &lt;a href=\"Highmaul\"&gt;Highmaul&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpeculation.\nMaraad seemed not to recognize pale orcs, suggesting they were not particularly involved in the draenei genocide. The pale orcs are also nowhere to be seen on Azeroth in modern times, meaning they were likely all exterminated during the First and Second Wars."}

Just as Thrall would return one day and become Drek'Thar's student, Palkar was also trained in the ways of the &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; by Drek'Thar and became a shaman in his own right.\nShaman.\nPrior to the &lt;a href=\"Shattering\"&gt;Shattering&lt;/a&gt;, Palkar escorted Drek'Thar to &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt; to meet with &lt;a href=\"Muln%20Earthfury\"&gt;Muln Earthfury&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt;.

As his master's memory failed, he largely dismissed Drek'Thar's visions as a sign of his increasing senility, and did not send word to Thrall of their import. Upon learning from &lt;a href=\"Perith%20Stormhoof\"&gt;Perith Stormhoof&lt;/a&gt; that the old shaman's vision that a peaceful gathering of &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; druids would be attacked had indeed come to pass, Palkar began to take his master's visions seriously again.\nDragonflight.\nPalkar was in &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20Village\"&gt;Frostwolf Village&lt;/a&gt; with his wolf, &lt;a href=\"Whiteclaw%20%28wolf%29\"&gt;Whiteclaw&lt;/a&gt;, when &lt;a href=\"Eitrigg\"&gt;Eitrigg&lt;/a&gt; and an orc &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; came to speak with Drek'Thar about bringing back the &lt;a href=\"Kosh%27harg\"&gt;Kosh'harg&lt;/a&gt;.

Hailing from &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Wandering%20Isle\"&gt;Wandering Isle&lt;/a&gt;, they are &lt;a href=\"humanoid\"&gt;humanoid&lt;/a&gt; s with a great love of nature and strong ales.\nLong ago, the pandaren were the slaves of a cruel race of powerful warlords known as the &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt;, until they successfully staged a &lt;a href=\"pandaren%20revolution\"&gt;revolution&lt;/a&gt; alongside several other slave races, establishing &lt;a href=\"Pandaren%20Empire\"&gt;their own empire&lt;/a&gt; in the process. During the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Shaohao\"&gt;last pandaren emperor&lt;/a&gt; sealed their homeland away behind a &lt;a href=\"Mists%20of%20Pandaria%20%28lore%29\"&gt;veil of mist&lt;/a&gt;, hiding Pandaria from the outside world and leaving their culture to flourish free of influences from the outside world.\nA second civilization of pandaren dwells on the back of the giant turtle known as &lt;a href=\"Shen-zin%20Su\"&gt;Shen-zin Su&lt;/a&gt;, who travels around Azeroth's seas. Millennia after the Sundering, a pandaren by the name of &lt;a href=\"Liu%20Lang\"&gt;Liu Lang&lt;/a&gt; set out to explore the world on Shen-zin Su, returning each year to Pandaria to pick up more adventurers to join him on the back of his ever-growing companion. Eventually, the turtle grew large enough for entire buildings and towns to be constructed upon his back, and the pandaren began referring to him as the \"Wandering Isle\".\nShortly after the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; ravaged Azeroth, the protective mists surrounding Pandaria dissipated, and before long, &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; warships arrived on the continent, causing the native pandaren to become involved in the conflict between the two factions. Around roughly the same time, an Alliance &lt;a href=\"The%20Skyseeker\"&gt;gunship&lt;/a&gt; carrying Horde prisoners crashed into the side of the Wandering Isle, and shortly thereafter pandaren followers of the &lt;a href=\"Tushui%20Pandaren\"&gt;Tushui&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Huojin%20Pandaren\"&gt;Huojin&lt;/a&gt; disciplines decided to leave their home to swear allegiance to the &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Alliance High King&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Horde warchief&lt;/a&gt;, respectively.\nWhile the race was first introduced with &lt;a href=\"Chen%20Stormstout\"&gt;Chen Stormstout&lt;/a&gt; in ', the pandaren made their first major appearance in \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" as a playable race with the fourth expansion, '.\nHistory.\nOrigins and early history.\nThe exact origins of the pandaren remain a mystery. &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Flavor%20lore\"&gt;speculates&lt;/a&gt; that they are descended from an unknown &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Guardian\"&gt;Ancient Guardian&lt;/a&gt;. If the pandaren's own tales are to be trusted, they were around before both the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;kaldorei&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt;s. Some &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s say pandaren and &lt;a href=\"raccoon\"&gt;raccoon&lt;/a&gt;s are distant cousins, but never when a pandaren can hear them.\nWhile the pandaren are predominantly a peace-loving race, their history is marked with turmoil and strife. The pandaren were among the races who settled in the lands surrounding the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt; roughly 15,000 years before the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks to their wise and peaceful nature, they forged a strong bond with four &lt;a href=\"Wild%20God\"&gt;Wild God&lt;/a&gt;s who dwelled in the area \u2014 &lt;a href=\"Chi-Ji\"&gt;Chi-Ji&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Niuzao\"&gt;Niuzao&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Xuen\"&gt;Xuen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Yu%27lon\"&gt;Yu'lon&lt;/a&gt;. Referring to the Wild Gods as the \"&lt;a href=\"August%20Celestial\"&gt;August Celestial&lt;/a&gt;s\", the pandaren formed a system of worship around the four, and in turn, the Celestials granted the pandaren knowledge and helped them hone their ties to philosophy and nature. Even in the ages before the &lt;a href=\"Mogu%20empire\"&gt;old empire&lt;/a&gt;, there is evidence that the pandaren love of learning had created epic poems, agriculture, and medicine.\nSlaves of the mogu.\nLong before the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; was scorched by the endless conflict of the &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt;, fighting amongst themselves. Powerful mogu warlords gathered up followers and made war on one another. Their battles waged across the land, terrifying the other mortal races. During this &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20a%20Hundred%20Kings\"&gt;Age of a Hundred Kings&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen\"&gt;Lei Shen&lt;/a&gt;, the Thunder King, gathered together his followers and rose to power \"the mogu way\", eliminating his rivals one by one. The mogu flocked around the Thunder King's banner and eagerly did his bidding as he enslaved the pandaren, believing - as Lei Shen did - that the \"lesser\" races should serve the mogu, just as the mogu had once served their masters. Emperor Lei Shen unified the language, established a single currency and standardized weight and measures. He also created the first set of written laws in all of Azeroth, written in the unified language. The brutal codes enshrined the mogu's place above all other creatures, and the first rule was that sedition, insurrection and rebellion be punished by public evisceration.\nThe Thunder King saw great potential in the pandaren, and for this reason he did not trust them. After he conquered the land, the pandaren were forbidden to learn to read or write. Their leaders and philosophers were executed and all pandaren art and literature was burned. Mogu taskmasters forbade their slaves to carry weapons. The pandaren were reduced to a race of slaves. The lucky ones clowned enough to entertain their mogu masters. Those pandaren lived in stone palaces, and their lives knew relative luxury. But that luxury ended when a joke offended and only the snapping of a spine or the popped removal of a head could inspire more mogu laughter. During these dark times, pandaren monks tried to lift the spirits of their beleaguered brothers and sisters. They were the storytellers, the brewmasters, and the healers who helped knit their oppressed society together in the midst of darkness.\nPandaren revolution.\nAs the mogu empire began to fray, the pandaren saw an opportunity for a revolution. Because they had no weapons, they trained common people to fight with their unarmed fists and feet. They mastered the use of positive energy \u2014 or &lt;a href=\"chi\"&gt;chi&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 to empower themselves. The revolution itself was a bloody affair that shattered an empire and left a terrible toll among combatant and civilian alike, but ultimately the mogu were overthrown and a new empire was founded. Although pandaren monks have since incorporated weapons into their attacks, they remain focused on chi as a source of power and are still devastating when fighting with open hands. 12,000 years ago the pandaren, through tenacity, diplomacy, and a unique form of unarmed combat, staged a successful revolution that deposed the mogu and established an &lt;a href=\"Pandaren%20Empire\"&gt;empire&lt;/a&gt; that would prosper for thousands of years. While the mogu were overthrown in a desperate revolution led by the pandaren, their legacy persists in thousand year-old ruins too immense to fall.\nZandalari Troll Wars.\nOne hundred years after the revolution, the allies of the mogu, the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari troll&lt;/a&gt;s, sought to aid their allies by attacking the embryonic pandaren empire. The Zandalari numbers were vast, and their &lt;a href=\"bat%20rider\"&gt;bat rider&lt;/a&gt;s fought in such a way the pandaren had no counter to until a girl named &lt;a href=\"Jiang\"&gt;Jiang&lt;/a&gt; used a &lt;a href=\"cloud%20serpent\"&gt;cloud serpent&lt;/a&gt; to strike them from the sky. The Zandalari's assault lasted several years, even bringing their dreaded &lt;a href=\"dinosaur\"&gt;dinosaur&lt;/a&gt;s into the fight. During the Zandalari invasion of the &lt;a href=\"Jade%20Forest\"&gt;Jade Forest&lt;/a&gt;, more cloud serpents were trained to bear riders, and the newly-formed &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Cloud%20Serpent\"&gt;Order of the Cloud Serpent&lt;/a&gt; turned the tide of the war.\nThe mist.\nBefore the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; were addicted to arcane magic and summoned the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, the pandaren were a close ally to the night elves. Some of them even lived with the night elves and witnessed the power of the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;. Yet after the night elves became obsessed with the well, the pandaren decided to sever their ties and enclose their border in &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;.\nBefore they left, the pandaren decided to offer the &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; a gift, a chest of pandaren design, said to contain all the arcane magic they would ever need. The gift was accepted and taken down into a royal vault in the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Zin-Malor\"&gt;Temple of Zin-Malor&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Eldarath\"&gt;Eldarath&lt;/a&gt;. However, when the chest was opened, it was found to contain absolutely nothing. The pandaren's gift was actually a message of advice and wisdom to the Highborne: all the arcane magic they needed was nothing, or in other words, that they did not need it at all. The chest and the message it represented continued to exist in the vault even 10,000 years later, but as history would record, the pandaren's wisdom fell on deaf ears.\nDuring the bleak days that preceded the sundering of the world, when &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s flooded onto &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and threw the entirety of the mortal realm into jeopardy, the last &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Shaohao\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; of the pandaren discovered a way to protect his land from the devastation. His deal with fate shrouded his land within an impenetrable mist for ten thousand years, but the nature of his transaction has left Pandaria haunted ever since. Previously, ships entering the mists have lost their bearings and spun about aimlessly before returning to the open ocean. As for the pandaren, they looked out toward the mist-veiled seas and many presumed that the rest of the world had perished in the Sundering.\nAfter Emperor Shaohao disappeared, the power in Pandaria shifted to the local level. With all threats walled off, there was no longer a need for an emperor anymore, making Shaohao the last Emperor of Pandaria.\nLiu Lang.\n800 years before the opening of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; a particularly bold pandaren named &lt;a href=\"Liu%20Lang\"&gt;Liu Lang&lt;/a&gt; set out to see what was beyond the mists by setting sail upon the back of a giant sea turtle: &lt;a href=\"Shen-zin%20Su\"&gt;Shen-zin Su&lt;/a&gt;. As the turtle grew, so did Liu Lang's desire to explore the world. Others joined him, until eventually a whole colony of pandaren explorers traveled the ocean, living atop the expansive \"&lt;a href=\"Wandering%20Isle\"&gt;Wandering Isle&lt;/a&gt;\". Although the Wandering Isle hasn't made landfall in many years, those who live there are still ignited by the spirit of adventure.\nThird War.\nPandaren wanderers are very rare, but the deeds of a few are recorded in recent times. One brave soul that spirited his way into the annals of Azerothian history was the brewmaster &lt;a href=\"Chen%20Stormstout\"&gt;Chen Stormstout&lt;/a&gt;. After a chance meeting with the &lt;a href=\"half-ogre\"&gt;half-ogre&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt;, Chen helped Rexxar, &lt;a href=\"Rokhan\"&gt;Rokhan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; found the new &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;ish homeland of &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;. Never one to stay put for long, Chen moved on, always seeking new ingredients for the perfect brew.\nThe Shattering.\nSometime in the wake of the Cataclysm, the mists abruptly vanished. Alliance and Horde naval fleets, engaged in skirmishes around the world thanks to the new Warchief's aggression, suddenly found a new continent where once charts showed open seas. With both factions escalating their feud into a global conflict, the war for Azeroth shifts in a new direction.\nWanderlust.\nPandaren afflicted with the wanderlust often stared out across the sea awaiting the return of &lt;a href=\"Liu%20Lang\"&gt;Liu Lang&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shen-zin%20Su\"&gt;Shen-zin Su&lt;/a&gt;. To this day, when someone is caught gazing off to the horizon for any reason, they are often asked if they are \"Waiting for the turtle.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Chen%20Stormstout\"&gt;Chen Stormstout&lt;/a&gt; is a native of the Wandering Isle, as are any players who choose to create pandaren characters. They are a rare breed, on the whole far more adventurous than their land-locked and long-lost relatives on mainland Pandaria. When the great turtle is threatened, and their whole wandering homeland is in jeopardy of being swallowed by the sea, young heroes had to accelerate their training and spring into action.\nMists of Pandaria.\nFollowing the events of the &lt;a href=\"Wandering%20Isle%20storyline\"&gt;Wandering Isle storyline&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Huojin\"&gt;Huojin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tushui\"&gt;Tushui&lt;/a&gt; pandaren of the Wandering Isle made their way to the Horde and Alliance capitals, respectively, to pledge their allegiance to their new 'Emperor'.\nHaving each joined one of the two major factions, the respective pandaren groups began to train their new allies in the ways of the &lt;a href=\"monk\"&gt;monk&lt;/a&gt;. As well as residing in the factions' capital cities, individual monk trainers traveled to areas such as the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Trials\"&gt;Valley of Trials&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Northshire%20Abbey\"&gt;Northshire Abbey&lt;/a&gt; to train young members of each of their faction's races. In addition, these pandaren served to exchange customs and knowledge with their new allies.\nThe pandaren's homeland, &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, becomes a battleground between the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Alliance-Horde%20war\"&gt;Alliance-Horde war&lt;/a&gt;. Many pandaren were caught in the conflict, and the &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan\"&gt;Shado-Pan&lt;/a&gt; leader &lt;a href=\"Taran%20Zhu\"&gt;Taran Zhu&lt;/a&gt; was angered that their violence was awakening the &lt;a href=\"sha\"&gt;sha&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, the Alliance and Horde earned the favor of the pandaren by aiding them in defending against their local enemies: the &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"mantid\"&gt;mantid&lt;/a&gt;, and other domestic threats.\nWhen Warchief &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; unearthed the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Y%27shaarj\"&gt;Heart of Y'shaarj&lt;/a&gt;, the Shado-Pan tried to stop him but proved unable to. The &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt; was corrupted by sha energy and both factions eventually &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;sieged&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; to end Hellscream's reign. Afterwards, the pandaren mainly focused on healing the vale again.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nGarrosh Hellscream was taken to the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20White%20Tiger\"&gt;Temple of the White Tiger&lt;/a&gt;, where he was to be trialed according to Pandaren law for his defilement of their homeland. The former warchief managed to escape with the aid of the &lt;a href=\"Infinite%20Dragonflight\"&gt;Infinite Dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; and the rogue &lt;a href=\"Bronze%20dragon\"&gt;Bronze dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kairozdormu\"&gt;Kairozdormu&lt;/a&gt;, who opened a portal into an &lt;a href=\"Alternate%20timeline\"&gt;alternate version&lt;/a&gt; of . \nTushui and Huojin pandaren followed their factions into this world, reinforcing the garrisons of &lt;a href=\"Lunarfall\"&gt;Lunarfall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Frostwall\"&gt;Frostwall&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, demons attacked &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; and destroyed the monastery at &lt;a href=\"Peak%20of%20Serenity\"&gt;Peak of Serenity&lt;/a&gt; killing many &lt;a href=\"monk\"&gt;monk&lt;/a&gt;s training there. The survivors relocated in the &lt;a href=\"Wandering%20Isle\"&gt;Wandering Isle&lt;/a&gt; reorganizing into the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Broken%20Temple\"&gt;Order of the Broken Temple&lt;/a&gt; to fight the Burning Legion. With the aid of a concoction called the Storm Brew, the monks managed to defeat a Legion attack on their new headquarters.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nThe islandic pandaren tribes sometimes visit Pandaria and purchase supplies. They live a very different life, always traveling from place to place and never settling down. When one group packs up to move on to a new island, it is not uncommon for another tribe to take their place.\nBiology and culture.\nIf a single trait could sum up the pandaren culture, it's that they live in the moment. They embrace life with gusto. A pandaren does everything with vigor, focus, and intensity. Every meal is an event. Every moment with the family is cherished. Every project or work of art demands their full attention. Every nap is treated as if it will be the last! The pandaren work hard, play hard, fight like animals, love with all their soul, tell impossibly tall tales, drink like they mean it, and sleep like the dead.\nOn the whole, pandaren are slow to anger and prefer measured solutions to problems. But underneath all of that practiced civility, there is a bear to contend with. When a pandaren focuses on combat, each blow rings with the weight of his or her entire body. Living \u201cin the moment\u201d also means getting lost in the fury of combat; a pandaren monk in the midst of battle has fists like wrecking balls and a roar that can be heard from horizon to horizon.\nHowever, it takes a great deal to get a pandaren wound up. On mainland Pandaria, negative emotions such as fear, anger, or despair can literally take on &lt;a href=\"Sha\"&gt;a physical form&lt;/a&gt; and stir up trouble. For this reason, pandaren emphasize and cultivate a quiet life of inner harmony and focus. Conflicts, no matter how bitter, are quickly forgotten over cold drinks once the matter is resolved. The pandaren sense of inner peace and love of life is infectious. Spend any significant time with a pandaren and you, too, can't help but get lost in the moment. Due to their laid-back nature, pandaren\u2014especially those on Pandaria\u2014are a bit looser about time and the passage of seasons than other races.\nHonorable and filled with a love of good company, good food -- and every now and then, a good friendly brawl -- the pandaren have been content to live in seclusion, allowing their culture to flourish and thrive away from the influence of the outside world. However, every now and then, a pandaren is born with a thirst for adventure that rivals his or her thirst for a strong drink, and he or she strikes out to explore beyond Pandaria's shores. One of the most famous such wanderers was the brewmaster &lt;a href=\"Chen%20Stormstout\"&gt;Chen Stormstout&lt;/a&gt;, who set out looking for exotic ingredients for his special ale and wound up an integral part of the founding of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the words of &lt;a href=\"Tyrathan%20Khort\"&gt;Tyrathan Khort&lt;/a&gt;, the pandaren are used to the mists. They see through them and are unseen within them. They would be a terrible force unleashed were they not so balanced and concerned with balance. In it, they find peace and, with reason, are reluctant to surrender that peace.\nAppearance.\nPandaren are humanoid bears with dark skin covered in fur from head to toe. The males stand at an average of 7'6\", while the females average around 7'. Their in-game height differs slightly from this, with females being 6'7\" tall and males being 7'1\" tall. Every pandaren has two colors of fur; one is always white but the other color ranges from black to brown to red. When pandaren grow old, their fur tends to run more to white. Some females artificially darken the area around their eyes. Despite being covered in fur, pandaren faces still visibly turn pink when they feel embarrassed. They have paws for hands and feet, with three fingers, a thumb and three toes. Each digit is tipped with a black claw. They refer to their hands directly as paws. While the species has a tail, there are two distinct forms. The common form is a round stub of fur, but the second form, which is long and thickens out by the end, is exclusive to red-and-white females.\nPandaren are usually very rotund, which tend to be a point of pride in their society (see &lt;a href=\"%23Cuisine\"&gt;cuisine section&lt;/a&gt;).\nCustoms.\nLast rites.\nNo pandaren approaches their death with joy, but neither should they feel fear, nor anger, nor doubt. They know that from their passing blossoms new life \u2014 this is the truth the pandaren hold most dear, and the truth for which they live, work, and die.\nA traditional pandaren &lt;a href=\"Funerary%20practices\"&gt;funeral ceremony&lt;/a&gt; involves the lighting of the \"Incense of Life\", which not only has a pleasant smell, but also has restorative properties and can even help plants grow. The incense is made from strongly aromatic spices, which gives it its unique scent, as well as blue crab shells.\nA &lt;a href=\"The%20Tan-Chao\"&gt;tan-chao&lt;/a&gt; is a ritual object used to form a \"bridge from this world to the heavens\", allowing restless spirits to &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;move on&lt;/a&gt;.\nCuisine.\nPandaren are known for their love of ale and good food, and mainland pandaren frequently show concern that the races of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; look too \"thin\".\n&lt;a href=\"Stuffed%20Lushrooms\"&gt;Stuffed Lushrooms&lt;/a&gt; was once a favored dish of the ancient &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt;, and has since become a staple in pandaren cuisine. &lt;a href=\"Spicy%20Vegetable%20Chips\"&gt;Spicy Vegetable Chips&lt;/a&gt; is a pandaren staple, while &lt;a href=\"Skewered%20Peanut%20Chicken\"&gt;Skewered Peanut Chicken&lt;/a&gt; is a pandaren specialty. A type of &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Pandaren%20Spices\"&gt;ancient spices&lt;/a&gt; have been a staple ingredient in pandaren recipes for millennia, since before the time of &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Shaohao\"&gt;Emperor Shaohao&lt;/a&gt;.\nSince the dark days of the &lt;a href=\"mogu%20empire\"&gt;old kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, the pandaren have turned to the mystical art of brewing to keep their spirits and strength high. The mighty &lt;a href=\"pandaren%20brewmaster\"&gt;brewmasters&lt;/a&gt; travel the world in search of exotic ales and the finest brewed spirits. These affable warriors rarely seek out danger or trouble, preferring instead to spend their time concocting new and tasty beverages for any brave enough to imbibe them. Wanderers by nature, brewmasters can be found roaming all over &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; searching for rare ingredients and concocting new brews. Nothing makes a pandaren happier than an untapped keg, and a pandaren worker without brew \"just won't be very productive\". Pandaren booze gets stronger with age.\nThe pandaren have a rich history of tea. While much care is given to its brewing, the secrets to properly enjoying tea have always been equally valued.\nThere are six different \"Ways\" of traditional pandaren cooking:\nLanguage.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen\"&gt;Lei Shen&lt;/a&gt; conquered Pandaria, the pandaren were forbidden from learning to read or write. All of their art and literature were burned and they were forbidden from speaking any language but the &lt;a href=\"Mogu%20%28language%29\"&gt;mogu tongue&lt;/a&gt;. Ages later, other great pandaren scholars would be born, but the language they spoke was not truly their own. Consequently, the original pandaren language is now known as the \"&lt;a href=\"Pandaren%20%28language%29%23The%20old%20tongue\"&gt;old tongue&lt;/a&gt;\", the \"language of emperors and scholars\", which most modern pandaren are unable to speak or understand.\nWhen a pandaren wants to intimidate another, they growl and bare their teeth. A measured growl can be used as a wordless way to warn cubs that they're becoming too rowdy, just the right mix of gentle warning and true menace.\nPandaren use a number of unique expressions:\nSong and poetry.\nThe harmony of light and dark bell flowers on the &lt;a href=\"Songbell%20Seed\"&gt;songbell&lt;/a&gt; plant has inspired pandaren song and poetry for millennia.\nThe &lt;a href=\"%3ASong%20of%20the%20Vale\"&gt;:Song of the Vale&lt;/a&gt; is a very old pandaren poem that describes the sacred &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt;.\nFaith.\nWhen they first settled in the land later known as &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, the pandaren formed a system of worship centered around four &lt;a href=\"Wild%20God\"&gt;Wild God&lt;/a&gt;s that they called the \"&lt;a href=\"August%20Celestial\"&gt;August Celestial&lt;/a&gt;s\", believing the powerful beings to be benevolent deities. After &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen\"&gt;Lei Shen&lt;/a&gt; defeated the Celestials during his conquest of Pandaria, worship of the animal spirits was outlawed on pain of death. Many of the pandaren's ties to the Wild Gods were lost, but a few brave individuals secretly continued preserving their teachings.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Anglers\"&gt;Anglers&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Soggy%27s%20Gamble\"&gt;Soggy's Gamble&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Dread%20Wastes\"&gt;Dread Wastes&lt;/a&gt; believe in a sea goddess named &lt;a href=\"Mazu\"&gt;Mazu&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe pandaren do not worship their ancestors, but they revere their memory and the wisdom that they have passed on to them.\nFolklore and beliefs.\nPandaren lore is filled with various stories and fables. The &lt;a href=\"Lorewalkers\"&gt;Lorewalkers&lt;/a&gt; is an organization dedicated to preserving pandaren stories and culture. According to &lt;a href=\"Lorewalker%20Stonestep\"&gt;Lorewalker Stonestep&lt;/a&gt;, the works of a thousand pandaren storytellers are stored within the &lt;a href=\"Scrollkeeper%27s%20Sanctum\"&gt;Scrollkeeper's Sanctum&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Jade%20Serpent\"&gt;Temple of the Jade Serpent&lt;/a&gt;.\nGames and celebrations.\nPandaren love games. One game, in particular, has been a favorite among the pandaren since the time of the first pandaren emperor. According to &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, pandaren board games such as &lt;a href=\"jihui\"&gt;jihui&lt;/a&gt; are designed for both players to win.\nWhile most pandaren in Pandaria aren't very adventurous, some still have the spirit of adventure. During the &lt;a href=\"Wanderer%27s%20Festival\"&gt;Wanderer's Festival&lt;/a&gt;, they gather at &lt;a href=\"Turtle%20Beach\"&gt;Turtle Beach&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Krasarang%20Wilds\"&gt;Krasarang Wilds&lt;/a&gt; to celebrate the first explorer, &lt;a href=\"Liu%20Lang\"&gt;Liu Lang&lt;/a&gt;, with contemplation and song. On the Wandering Isle, the &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Festival\"&gt;Spirit Festival&lt;/a&gt;\u2014which also honors Liu Lang\u2014is considered the most important celebration of the year.\nPandaren fighting tactics.\nDuring the dark days of the &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; dynasties, pandaren slaves were not permitted weapons of any kind. When training in secret, pandaren monks would often use farm tools or simple bamboo staves for practice. Emphasis was also placed on unarmed strikes.\nIn contrast, the favored weapons of the mogu were based on fear rather than practicality. They were large, cumbersome, and difficult to wield. Pandaren monks took advantage, developing fast strikes and the skill to quickly move around the battlefield. The larger, slower mogu were often completely disoriented by the speed of pandaren monks in open combat.\nOver the years, fighting styles have changed dramatically, incorporating any number of other abilities, weapons, styles, etc. But the core foundation of pandaren fighting techniques remains the same: Defeat an opponent of any size with your bare paws if you have to.\nThe first monks.\nIn the days of the &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; dynasties, slaves were the lifeblood of the empire. Pandaren, &lt;a href=\"hozen\"&gt;hozen&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"jinyu\"&gt;jinyu&lt;/a&gt; worked fields, dug mines, and built the mighty fortresses of their masters.\nTo help combat fatigue, maintain morale, and return the wounded to work, the mogu permitted a special caste of slaves that specialized in the brewing of remedies. Simple teas and poultices were their specialty at first. Over the years these specialists became healers, community leaders, and &lt;a href=\"brewmaster\"&gt;brewmaster&lt;/a&gt;s.\nA noble tradition was born, and these early \"&lt;a href=\"monk\"&gt;monk&lt;/a&gt;s\" became symbols of hope and pride amongst the pandaren.\nIt was these heroes who first learned how to fight without weapons, in secret. Monks taught the other slaves the secrets of martial arts. When the revolution came, the monks were the first into battle, inspiring the humble farmers, smiths, and masons to follow...\nPhilosophies.\n&lt;a href=\"Tushui\"&gt;Tushui&lt;/a&gt;.\nOne of the two primary philosophies followed by pandaren of the Wandering Isle is the way of Tushui. It encourages living a venerable life through meditation, rigorous training, and moral conviction. &lt;a href=\"Aysa%20Cloudsinger\"&gt;Aysa Cloudsinger&lt;/a&gt; is one of the pandaren that have mastered this way and can be recognized as somewhat of a leader of the Tushui monks. This philosophy is very close to the ways of the Alliance, and Aysa has decided to join this faction along with the pandaren who uphold this belief.\n&lt;a href=\"Huojin\"&gt;Huojin&lt;/a&gt;.\nAnother philosophy is the way of Huojin. It states that inaction is the greatest injustice and that there is no shame in defending one's homes and loved ones regardless of cost. &lt;a href=\"Ji%20Firepaw\"&gt;Ji Firepaw&lt;/a&gt; is a staunch follower of this way, and the first of them who recognized the similarities of this way in the races of the Horde, and all that find themselves closer to this belief have decided to follow Ji and stand united with all these Horde races, whose desire is to live free.\n&lt;a href=\"Wanderer%27s%20Way\"&gt;Wanderer's Way&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Wanderer's Way is a philosophy of the &lt;a href=\"Wandering%20Isle\"&gt;Wandering Isle&lt;/a&gt; pandaren, made famous by &lt;a href=\"Chen%20Stormstout\"&gt;Chen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Li%20Li%20Stormstout\"&gt;Li Li Stormstout&lt;/a&gt;. Basically, it means to take each journey one step at a time, observe everything around you, speak to everyone you meet, and soak in all the details. However, it also teaches the importance of knowing when to explore and when to stand your ground and fight.\nHistory of debuts, rumors, and controversy.\nThe pandaren started as a creation of lead artist &lt;a href=\"Samwise%20Didier\"&gt;Samwise Didier&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href=\"Pandaren%20April%20Fools\"&gt;April Fool's joke&lt;/a&gt;, but they got a massive response from \"Warcraft\" fans. When was announced, the &lt;a href=\"Pandaren%20Brewmaster%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;pandaren brewmaster&lt;/a&gt; was added as a neutral hero, available and playable on nearly every melee map. One brewmaster, &lt;a href=\"Chen%20Stormstout\"&gt;Chen Stormstout&lt;/a&gt; was included as an optional playable hero in the expansion's &lt;a href=\"The%20Founding%20of%20Durotar\"&gt;orc campaign&lt;/a&gt;. Due to this popularity, pandaren were initially planned to be the new playable Alliance race in ' expansion, but were scrapped during development in favor of the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;. Their possible appearance in \"World of Warcraft\" has been hinted at multiple times by Blizzard. On October 21, 2011, at &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon%202011\"&gt;BlizzCon 2011&lt;/a&gt;, Blizzard officially announced ' as the fourth &lt;a href=\"expansion\"&gt;expansion&lt;/a&gt;, and the pandaren became the first playable race available to both the Horde and the Alliance. However, the WoW community became somewhat divided over the expansion.\nIn the RPG.\nThe pandaren are originally from central Kalimdor where they established the Pandaren Empire. They were allies of the night elves until they saw their obsession with magic getting out of control. The clans severed ties and left Kalimdor behind eventually establishing a new home on an island they named Pandaria. After the Sundering, some pandaren returned to the \"new\" Kalimdor to explore it. \"Where once the pandaren were a mighty empire, standing proud beside their night elf allies, now they are a simple people who want only peace and a safe home.\" Since the Third War, more pandaren have come to visit Kalimdor.\nHailing from their own secret empire, the pandaren are a race of humanoids resembling panda bears. This appearance leads some to underestimate these noble creatures, thinking them harmless and \"cute\". They may be cute, but they are not harmless. Pandaren have a long tradition of mystic warfare and are exceedingly strong and agile. The traditional pandaren fighting style focuses upon mobility, speed and precision, as well as stunning acrobatic tricks. Many pandaren are skilled at fighting bare-handed.\nOnly the pandaren know the intricacies of their society, but alcohol is a central feature. All pandaren are connoisseurs of ale and stronger drink, leading to a unique kinship with &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20dwarf\"&gt;Ironforge dwarves&lt;/a&gt;. A caste of wandering pandaren warriors called &lt;a href=\"Brewmaster\"&gt;Brewmaster&lt;/a&gt;s is highly respected in their culture. A few Brewmasters have been spotted in &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, searching for new beverages to sample and ingredients to add to their own brews. Pandaren are affable and noble, trained in battle but always seeking peace. Pandaren philosophy centers on a harmony of opposites \u2014 male and female, calm and chaos, existence and non-existence. Pandaren feel a strong link to the natural world and seek to maintain a peace between all races and nature. Very few pandaren ever leave their hidden island homeland of &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, although there is a place called &lt;a href=\"Pandaren%20Settlement\"&gt;Pandaren Settlement&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, but those that do have proved themselves to be strong warriors specializing in &lt;a href=\"Drunken%20Brawling\"&gt;Drunken Brawling&lt;/a&gt; with great command of the elements. \nCulture.\nPandaren society.\nEach pandaren belongs to a &lt;a href=\"shao%27din\"&gt;shao'din&lt;/a&gt;, which is their word for \u201cclan\u201d. Pandaren society has changed from its origins. Where once the pandaren were a mighty &lt;a href=\"empire\"&gt;empire&lt;/a&gt;, standing proud beside their night elf allies, now they are a simple people who want only peace and a safe home. Yet the world is a dangerous place, and only through an acceptance of the violence that comes with life can the pandaren continue to prosper. Pandaren society is, in many ways, compartmentalized. At their core, the pandaren treasure peace and creativity. Most pandaren are poets and singers, and the craftsmen of their culture are truly revered. The danger of their lives, however, has necessitated the evolution of a class of warriors to defend those ideals \u2014 it is these warriors, from the simplest pikeman to the great &lt;a href=\"shodo-pan\"&gt;shodo-pan&lt;/a&gt;s, who ensure that pandaren culture survives.\nThey mainly speak &lt;a href=\"Pandaren%20%28language%29\"&gt;Pandaren&lt;/a&gt;. Many have also learned &lt;a href=\"Common%20%28language%29\"&gt;Common&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Darnassian\"&gt;Darnassian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20%28language%29\"&gt;Dwarven&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Taurahe\"&gt;Taurahe&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Thalassian\"&gt;Thalassian&lt;/a&gt; in their travels.\nPandaren are known for their art of acupressure. Acupressure points such as the one in the right arm, can quicken the heart rate and cause the muscles to contract. Other points on the left arm can calm a user down if needed.\nFaith.\nPandaren have a fierce and deep belief in the connection of the material and spiritual worlds. In many ways, their faith mirrors the ancient beliefs of the night elves, and the tribal beliefs of the tauren, troll, and orc races. However, pandaren veil their beliefs in the trappings of a mystical and ancient method called geomancy. Geomancy teaches that the land is a reflection of the spirits, but that spirits are also a reflection of the land. Like the &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20dwarf\"&gt;Wildhammer dwarves&lt;/a&gt;, the pandaren follow a shamanistic faith, worshiping the &lt;a href=\"Earth%20Mother\"&gt;Earth Mother&lt;/a&gt; and giving passage to their dead. They are true &lt;a href=\"geomancer\"&gt;geomancer&lt;/a&gt;s, drawing their holy power directly from the Earth Mother. They also follow a new philosophy (new to the other residents of Kalimdor, of course); they are a society that reacts, instead of acting first. They claim to be the water that flows around a rock: The water does not push the rock out of the way, it merely goes around it. They use this uncomplicated way of thinking in their everyday life. If they set their minds to a task, and they fail, then they believe they went about it the wrong way and try again. They do not mourn for failures, believing that they simply have mapped out improper ways to do things and they will know better next time. This philosophy seems simple, but the pandaren apply it to every aspect of their lives, from brewing beer to adventuring. They are calm, affable types who will extend the hand of friendship to a stranger on the road \u2014 but if the stranger is hostile, the hand of friendship can quickly turn into an excruciating joint lock.\nBrewing.\nWhat may surprise those who encounter the pandaren most, however, is their unabashed love for beer. Most religious and meditative people on Kalimdor consider alcohol a drink for the masses, a drink whose properties cloud the mind and block contemplation of the gods. The pandaren laugh at this notion. The ideal day for a pandaren begins with meditation and ends with a good drink with a better friend. They love encountering folk who live life to the fullest; they enjoy adventuring; and they are happiest in a tavern swapping stories and buying rounds for the house. Those lucky enough to meet a pandaren and share in his ale will undoubtedly find it to be the best beer they have ever tasted. The down side to this, of course, is that they will no longer enjoy Kalimdor-brewed beer as much. The pandaren are an old and refined culture with many traditions and arts important to their way of life, none of which have influenced the pandaren so thoroughly as the art of brewing. Drink is in every aspect of pandaren life; and because of the craft involved, a tradition of brewing potent fluids has become a cultural institution for the gentle people of Pandaria. The pandaren &lt;a href=\"brewmaster\"&gt;brewmaster&lt;/a&gt;s travel the world for new and exotic ingredients and recipes. These affable yet deadly warriors practice a unique combination of healing arts and martial skill. With their knowledge of alchemy, potion-making and brewery, the pandaren have created superb ales and liquors that have become a welcome drink at any adventurers table either before or after a battle. The brews hold magical properties, as plants, berries, and fungi that harbor powerful spirits are often included as ingredients in whiskeys, ales and other alcoholic beverages. Distilling these ingredients focuses potent magic.\nLittle is more revered in the pandaren culture than brewing. These refined soldiers consider brewing as important to their culture as art and traditional ritual. In fact, many of their society's arts and rituals would suffer if not for the brewing. Although various kinds of alcohol are in every part of life for the pandaren, they are far from a drunken society. Because of the love of drink, the tradition of brewing is considered one of the noblest pursuits, and they revere their brewmasters like other societies honor their &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s. The brews, for the most part, carry the hallowed names of the original brewmasters who created them. &lt;a href=\"Chou%20Ling%20Sing\"&gt;Chou Ling Sing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hong%20Liu\"&gt;Hong Liu&lt;/a&gt;, and the brewmaster known only as &lt;a href=\"Xiang\"&gt;Xiang&lt;/a&gt; are the three most revered brewmasters, and they had a frequent and friendly rivalry. Chou and Hong put their names on their brews, whilst Xiang preferred hers to go anonymous \u2014 if she named none of them, she could claim all that did not bear the other two's names. With these masters long dead, their present day prot\u00e9g\u00e9s carry on the traditions. Pandaren brewmasters go on long quests in order to find new and exotic ingredients for their drinks, looking for herbs and ingredients to create new recipes. The brewmasters are affable and kind, yet deadly soldiers if crossed. They are proficient in both healing arts and their own form of martial arts. With their knowledge of alchemy, potion-making, and brewing, pandaren have created superb ales and spirits that have become a welcome drink at any adventurer's table.\nRarely a pandaren overimbibes, and suffers the next day. Hangovers can happen, and a pandaren cannot afford to be knocked down with a pounding head and a queasy stomach. There is beer to brew and questing to do and martial arts to practice, none of which are easy when suffering. Pandaren parables say that if someone pulls you, instead of resisting, you should push. So in the same light, instead of fighting the hangovers, pandaren drink the Chou's Hair of the Dog Ale, a deep red amber ale that has a light taste and leaves the head feeling clear and sharp. While beer is treasured in pandaren culture, whiskey is revered. It represents health and good fortitude and even luck. Pandaren brewmaster philosophy says that the best whiskey can make a pandaren strong enough to face an army. The particular vintage named &lt;a href=\"Wounded%20Warrior%20Whiskey\"&gt;Wounded Warrior Whiskey&lt;/a&gt; has amazing healing properties, plus causes the wounded warrior to become as strong as a lion after drinking.\nMartial artists.\nThey take the same stance regarding their martial arts as they do every other part of their lives. They use what works, perfecting it with terrifying results, and they don't use what doesn't work. If an injured leg won't allow the pandaren to kick very high, he gives up that kind of kick and perfects another. If up against a massive opponent, the pandaren will not waste time trying to match strength with strength, as the opponent represents the rock in the river to them. They find a clever way to best their opponent while expending the least strength necessary. They are formidable monks, following their philosophies to the letter and perfecting their martial arts as they see fit. Even the lowliest pandaren is capable of defending himself, using the fangs and stubby but needle-like claws that are a natural part of his body. All pandaren can use these natural weapons to fight and hunt, as pandaren grow up playing rough and tumble games meant to hone their abilities while learning the admonishments of their elders that such things are a last resort. In general, pandaren prefer to use the weapons they craft, feeling that their natural weapons hearken back to a primal time. Pandaren are bipedal creatures, but their pseudo-ursine forms allow them to move at tremendous speed on four limbs. When a pandaren drops down to all fours, his speed increases greatly. He must have nothing in his hands to use quadrupedal movement.\nPandaren relations.\nAll of the races that reside on &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; view the pandaren with interest. Claiming to come from an island named &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, which no one has ever visited, these gentle beings bring their love for beer, their quiet contemplations and their formidable fighting techniques to Kalimdor to experience life on the continent. The pandaren are the smallest of the bestial races and seem positively tiny next to the hulking bulk of the furbolgs. However, they seem much less like beasts than their apparent cousins. They value honor, discipline, and friendship above all else. Gain the companionship and trust of a pandaren, they say, and you have a friend and protector for life. The pandaren are an independent race and any encountered outside the Barrens are wanderers and travelers, belonging to no affiliation. Their outlook meshes well with the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, and most pandaren in &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; are found in the company of Alliance races. Pandaren are eccentric, however, and some feel more at home around the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. In any case, they rarely stay in one place for long. Pandaren friendliness and combat prowess make them good allies and honorable enemies. Pandaren are on good terms with all non-evil races.\nAlthough they have been on Kalimdor a short time, the pandaren have already developed a special bond with the &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt;. The dwarves are a race that appreciates good ale and a good story, and they have many tell of their own. The pandaren have enjoyed their stops at &lt;a href=\"Bael%20Modan\"&gt;Bael Modan&lt;/a&gt; and the things they have learned of the Alliance, the Horde and the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; there. Being a race that honors their ancestors as well, they aid the dwarves in their search for titan artifacts when they can. They believe knowing where one comes from is an important aspect to living a full life. They have also made friends in the &lt;a href=\"Half-elf\"&gt;half-elves&lt;/a&gt; they have encountered, as the half-elves are beginning to adopt the same life-accepting philosophies as the pandaren, and they find them to be ideal traveling partners. Most pandaren have recently arrived on Kalimdor, but there are some that fought in the recent conflicts surrounding &lt;a href=\"Illidan\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt;. A number of pandaren were visiting the dwarves of Bael Modan when the call came to the Alliance to prevent the blood elf and naga army traveling to &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. To honor their hosts, the pandaren visitors joined the fight. It was during this battle that they formed most of their opinions regarding the other races.\nThe pandaren have liked most of the other independent races they have met. Deciding to remain neutral themselves, they appreciate the other races' reasons for standing safely in the middle. They, understandingly, identify more with the races that they have philosophies in common with. Some pandaren spent many months recently with the &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt;s, learning of their simple life in Ashenvale Forest. They sympathize with the &lt;a href=\"half-orc\"&gt;half-orc&lt;/a&gt;s they have met, and simply do not understand the &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s. They, like the other races of the continent, do not care for the blood elves and naga (there are exceptions as one was last seen fighting alongside the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;sin'dorei&lt;/a&gt;). The &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s are puzzling, as they practice divine magic, but for evil purposes, which doesn't coincide with the pandaren philosophy. Their fondness for the Ironforge dwarves doesn't put the pandaren in a likely position to join the Alliance any time soon. They feel the Alliance gives too much weight to politics, treaties, and arcane magic when, really, all one needs to do is step outside one's door, taste the air, feel the earth and take one's cues from there. Overall, the Alliance is unnecessarily complicated for the pandaren, and although they do enjoy visiting &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt; (especially for the taverns), they don't plan on setting up homes there any time soon.\nThey have much in common with the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; when it comes to spirituality, but they are unlikely to join their forces either. The Horde is formed of races in the midst of healing, the pandaren believe, and they need to find themselves before they can allow anyone else to join their fold. Besides, the pandaren are just visiting.\nNames.\nPandaren naming practices are similar to those of humans: each pandaren has a given name and a surname. The names themselves, of course, are different.\nMilitary tactics.\nPandaren rely on a well-regimented system of battle that uses infantry, archers, and cavalry, with elite units and spellcasters to bolster their forces. Pandaren are strict adherents to the practice of equipping each soldier with the best possible equipment and arms. Even the lowliest foot soldier has a jug of pandaren brew at his side to aid him in combat, and most units use the more powerful magic drinks before a battle. Pandaren are courageous and fearless, and thus their armies have amazing durability and cohesion. A unit of infantry serves under a wardancer, with a host of wardancers serving under a shodo-pan. Each shodo-pan from a shao'din has a host of warriors and wardancers at his command. Pandaren infantry are armed with pan-spears, round bamboo helms, thick lamellar-style armor made from woven bambus reed, and sometimes bear shields made of the same material. Using the spears to fight in regimented ranks, the pandaren infantry use a variety of tactics that involve engulfing, flanking, and leading enemies into a charge.\nPandaren archers often rest just beyond the infantry, using long supple bambus bows capable of taking the eye out of an orc at hundreds of yards. Pandaren archers are equipped with their bows and a variety of arrows with varying heads (broad, leaf-shaped heads for unarmored infantry, sharp, piercing heads for heavily armored opponents, and unusual \u201cU\u201d or \u201cV\u201d shaped arrowheads for dealing maximum damage at close range); they often carry short curved swords similar to shaktani warblades. Pandaren archers are skilled at long-range marksmanship and sniping, although the size of their bows prohibits their use from concealment, for they are almost as tall as a standing pandaren. Pandaren cavalry is almost entirely composed of wardancers riding combat-trained horses. The wardancers wear bambus armor reinforced with metal chain and buckling. Wielding shaktani warblades, the wardancers cut down anyone in their path.\nRecently introduced to the pandaren are firearms, which are beginning to take a more important role in the way the pandaren wage war. While only a few of the shao'dins have rifle regiments, pandaren have taken to the rifle like a dwarf to ale. Some pandaren riflemen even go so far as to travel abroad to learn the shooting techniques of other races, and bring best techniques back to Pandaria. These riflemen mark a new evolution in the way the pandaren wage war, a change to traditions that most likely have not altered in millennia.\nPandaren equipment.\nThe clever pandaren craftsmen have learned to make the most of the sparse building materials found in their environs. Steel is a rare commodity; in fact, most of what steel they have is left from bygone days in central Kalimdor, reforged and reshaped by craftsmen. The rest of what they have is usually taken from the weapons of enemies. As such, the pandaren have developed weapons and armors that rely on very little steel. In fact, only the shaktani warblades are made wholly of steel.\nNotable RPG pandaren.\nOthers; Mojo Dark-Ale, Sinjo Honeybrew, Kesha Wildbarley, Tatsa Sweetbarrow, Mushi Ale-Hearth, Jinto Reedwine, Masha Storm-Stout, and Polo Barrel-keg.\nSome are &lt;a href=\"pandaren%20brewmaster\"&gt;pandaren brewmaster&lt;/a&gt; names from \"Warcraft III\". Although, several of the names are referenced in \"Dark Factions\"."}

While much of this material was later adapted into lore in later sources (', \"&lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20RPG\"&gt;Warcraft RPG&lt;/a&gt;\", etc.), some of it differs from the later established lore.\nWhile the introduction of the pandaren as a race for \"Warcraft III\" was purely humorous, almost a decade later the race was added to \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;s fourth expansion, ', as a &lt;a href=\"Pandaren%20%28playable%29\"&gt;playable race&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt;, driven from their tranquil lands by the marauding &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt;s, fight ceaselessly to find a new homeland amongst the warring civilizations of southern &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory / Ecology.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Pandaren%20Empire\"&gt;Pandaren Empire&lt;/a&gt;, founded in ancient times, before the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt; of the world, shared resources and mystic knowledge with the haughty &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; of central &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. However, as the night elves' racial obsession with the forces of magic drove them to the brink of madness, the gentle pandaren decided to sever their ties and leave the night elves behind forever. Sensing that magic would be the doom of any race that trifled with it, the pandaren clans, or &lt;a href=\"shao%27din\"&gt;shao'din&lt;/a&gt;s, traveled far into the treacherous lands of the south. There the pandaren established crude, but beautiful cities of stone and sturdy &lt;a href=\"bambus\"&gt;bambus&lt;/a&gt; reed. They lived in peace for many generations before the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;burning shadow&lt;/a&gt; came to engulf the world...\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; and the subsequent Sundering of the world, the pandaren's surroundings became increasingly hostile. Forced to fight for food and precious land against both the early &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; and the bristling &lt;a href=\"quilboar\"&gt;quilboar&lt;/a&gt; tribes, they developed into amazingly proficient warriors. Wielding thin, delicately balanced blades, the pandaren &lt;a href=\"wardancer\"&gt;wardancer&lt;/a&gt;s quickly established themselves as some of the deadliest swordsmen of the ancient world. With the wardancers leading their armies, the pandaren carved out a small empire for themselves in the &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon region&lt;/a&gt; of Kalimdor's desolate &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt;. Though the fierce wardancers maintained peace throughout the pandaren lands, their relatively small population would ensure that their influence would never spread much farther than the Barrens' rocky borders.\nNow that war has engulfed Kalimdor &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;once again&lt;/a&gt;, the mighty pandaren have come forth to protect their sacred lands and ensure their ancient race's survival.\nHeroes.\n&lt;a href=\"Shodo-Pan\"&gt;Shodo-Pan&lt;/a&gt;.\nThese mighty &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; warriors oversee the armies of their &lt;a href=\"Pandaren%20Empire\"&gt;empire&lt;/a&gt; and serve as feudal lords to the general population. Shodo-Pans have the ability to wield &lt;a href=\"Geomancer\"&gt;geomantic&lt;/a&gt; powers as well as the &lt;a href=\"wardancer\"&gt;wardancer&lt;/a&gt;s' shaktani blades. The stoic Shodo-Pans' greatest enemies are the cruel &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"khan\"&gt;khan&lt;/a&gt;s of southern &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. The Pans ceaselessly work to hunt down the khans and their centaur marauders whenever they encroach upon the lands of the pandaren empire.\nUnits.\n&lt;a href=\"Wardancer\"&gt;Wardancer&lt;/a&gt;.\nDespite their girth and size, &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; wardancers are exceptionally agile. Carrying their sacred shaktani warblades, these mighty swordsmen inspire fear in all of the primitive denizens of the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt;. Though their light &lt;a href=\"bambus\"&gt;bambus&lt;/a&gt; armor gives them only moderate protection, the wardancers' skills make them formidable opponents.\n&lt;a href=\"Pikeman\"&gt;Pikeman&lt;/a&gt;.\nThese brave warriors wield heavy bambus pikes that they can use as both melee weapons and devastating projectiles. The pikes, known as pan-spears, can be thrown great distances with startling accuracy due to their hollow bambus shafts. The pikemen, usually found supporting wardancers on the front lines of combat, are adept at intimidating enemy forces by displaying their fierce proficiency with their versatile weapons.\n&lt;a href=\"Geomancer\"&gt;Geomancer&lt;/a&gt;.\nMuch like the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s, the pandaren &lt;a href=\"mystic\"&gt;mystic&lt;/a&gt;s developed an affinity for the spirits of the earth. These hearty mystics developed the practice of geomancy - and learned to wield the fury of the earth by appeasing the restless elemental spirits. Many geomancers have been known to summon various types of &lt;a href=\"Earth%20elemental\"&gt;rock and stone elementals&lt;/a&gt;, and great geomancers have even caused catastrophic earthquakes to swallow enemy armies."}

The latter is spoken by &lt;a href=\"Pandaren%20%28playable%29\"&gt;pandaren players&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\", while the former can be heard in some in-game quests.\nThe old tongue.\nThe \"old tongue\" is the term used for the original language of the &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt;, spoken before &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; enslavement. All writings in that language were burned after &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen\"&gt;Lei Shen&lt;/a&gt; established the &lt;a href=\"mogu%20empire\"&gt;mogu empire&lt;/a&gt;, an act fueled by his distrust of the pandaren and their peaceful philosophy. All pandaren leaders and philosophers were executed, with the pandaren forbidden to learn to read or write (a policy later relaxed under &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Tsao\"&gt;Emperor Tsao&lt;/a&gt;); anyone caught speaking anything but the mogu tongue was considered to be a conspirator, a charge often punished with slow, brutal death. All pandaren art was also burned along with their literature. As a result of this, the old tongue has practically disappeared, displaced by &lt;a href=\"Mogu%20%28language%29\"&gt;Mogu&lt;/a&gt;.\nHowever, despite this, the old tongue has survived to the modern age, although it is now considered a \"language of emperors and scholars\", with most common pandaren unable to speak or understand it. The &lt;a href=\"Song%20of%20Liu%20Lang\"&gt;Song of Liu Lang&lt;/a&gt;, an ancient pandaren song that tells the story of &lt;a href=\"Liu%20Lang\"&gt;Liu Lang&lt;/a&gt; and his adventures on the back of &lt;a href=\"Shen-zin%20Su\"&gt;Shen-zin Su&lt;/a&gt;, is sung by &lt;a href=\"Lorewalker%20Cho\"&gt;Lorewalker Cho&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Wanderer%27s%20Festival\"&gt;Wanderer's Festival&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Lorewalker%20Ruolin\"&gt;Lorewalker Ruolin&lt;/a&gt; also sung it to pandaren children, though they could not understand any of the words.\nThe modern language.\nAges later, other great pandaren scholars would be born, but the language they spoke was not truly their own: this modern pandaren language is in fact the language of the mogu (or at least descended from it). \nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt;, Pandaren seems to have a half dozen words for almost everything, with nuances an outsider would never understand and which the pandaren can use to mask their true intent.\n&lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Player character&lt;/a&gt;s speaking Pandaren in-game have their words translated into \"om\" (for &lt;2-letter words) and \"nom\" (for &gt;2-letter words) to non-pandaren, producing little more than &lt;a href=\"http%3A//knowyourmeme.com/memes/om-nom-nom-nom\"&gt;\"om nom nom\"&lt;/a&gt; joke speech. Since &lt;a href=\"patch%207.0.3\"&gt;patch 7.0.3&lt;/a&gt;, pandaren can now use their racial language to communicate with pandaren of the opposite faction. Before, only pandaren of the same faction understood the Pandaren language, so there were effectively two Pandaren languages in the game, one for each faction.\nWords.\nThere are several unique words and expressions used by pandaren, that may or may not represent Pandaren speech:\nIn the RPG.\nNames.\nPandaren naming practices are similar to those of humans: each pandaren has a given name and a surname.\nSpeculation.\nRelationship between Mogu and modern Pandaren.\nThe relationship between the languages of the pandaren and the mogu are unclear. Although it has been stated in \"\" as well as in-game that pandaren were forced to abandon their language in favour of that of the mogu, \"Mists of Pandaria\" generally treats Pandaren and Mogu as two separate languages, rather than one. Indeed, the pandaren &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; is unable to read ancient mogu texts in the &lt;a href=\"Kun-Lai%20Summit\"&gt;Kun-Lai Summit&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href=\"Lorewalker%20Cho\"&gt;Lorewalker Cho&lt;/a&gt; takes time to translate them. The mogu also do not appear to use the same Nushu-inspired glyphs as the pandaren.\nIt is possible that, although the pandaren did adopt Mogu during Lei Shen's rule, enough differences have appeared since then for their language to be considered separate. In real life, enslaved or otherwise subjugated populations would often adopt their rulers' language, but with the influence of their native speech, creating mixed languages known as &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creole_language\"&gt;creoles&lt;/a&gt;. It is possible that Pandaren at least originated as such a creole: the mogu language as spoken by pandaren, with the phonology and grammar of their \"old tongue\" \"creeping in\". The 12,000 years of separation would then presumably cement these differences, so that now pandaren can no longer understand mogu texts.\nOf course, it is also possible that \"Pandaren\" and \"Mogu\" are simply two names for the same language, and the only reason Lorewalker Cho was unable to read mogu texts right away was their age, with the modern pandaren and mogu still capable of understanding one another. The fact that the pandaren and the mogu still use the same naming customs (Mandarin-inspired first names and descriptive surnames) lends credence to that theory, especially since other Pandarian races, such as the &lt;a href=\"jinyu\"&gt;jinyu&lt;/a&gt;, have completely different names."}
{"id": "327546", "revid": "53765795", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=327546", "title": "Pandaren (playable)", "text": "The pandaren () of &lt;a href=\"Shen-zin%20Su\"&gt;Shen-zin Su&lt;/a&gt; are one of the playable races in \"World of Warcraft\", introduced in \"\". They are available to both the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, the first &lt;a href=\"race\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt; in \"World of Warcraft\" to have this option. Pandaren are ancient and secretive, having long remained hidden. Now that they have rejoined the world, the order of &lt;a href=\"Tushui%20Pandaren\"&gt;Tushui&lt;/a&gt; has pledged allegiance to the Alliance, and the order of &lt;a href=\"Huojin%20Pandaren\"&gt;Huojin&lt;/a&gt; has found companionship in the Horde.\nTheir starting zone is the &lt;a href=\"Wandering%20Isle\"&gt;Wandering Isle&lt;/a&gt;, a giant turtle that wanders Azeroth's oceans. At the end of the island's questline (around level 10), players will be able to choose which faction (&lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;) to join, and will not be able to change afterward using in-game means. Those who have joined either faction don't have any capital cities to share with their allies. As a result, most non-neutral pandaren consider &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; their base of operations respectively. Their racial mount is the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20turtle\"&gt;dragon turtle&lt;/a&gt;, and they speak &lt;a href=\"Pandaren%20%28language%29\"&gt;Pandaren&lt;/a&gt; as a main language. When one of them joins the Alliance or Horde, they learn &lt;a href=\"Common%20%28language%29\"&gt;Common&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Orcish%20%28language%29\"&gt;Orcish&lt;/a&gt; to communicate with their new allies.\nHistory.\nCouched in myth and legend, rarely seen and even more rarely understood, the enigmatic pandaren have long been a mystery to the other races of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. The noble history of the pandaren people stretches back thousands of years, well before the empires of &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;man&lt;/a&gt; and before even the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;sundering&lt;/a&gt; of the world.\nDenizens of a wondrous and fertile land, the pandaren once labored under the oppressive thumb of a monstrous race of ancient warlords known as the &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt;. Through tenacity, diplomacy, and &lt;a href=\"monk\"&gt;a unique form of unarmed combat&lt;/a&gt;, the pandaren staged a successful revolution that deposed the mogu and established a &lt;a href=\"Pandaren%20Empire\"&gt;pandaren empire&lt;/a&gt; that would prosper for thousands of years. During the bleak days that preceded the sundering of the world, when &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s flooded onto Azeroth and threw the entirety of the mortal realm into jeopardy, the last Emperor of the pandaren discovered a way to protect his land from the devastation. His deal with fate shrouded his land within an impenetrable mist for ten thousand years, but the nature of his transaction has left &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; haunted ever since...\nWanderlust.\nIt is the rare pandaren indeed who sought a way beyond the mist. Generations ago, pandaren explorers began to gather &lt;a href=\"The%20Wandering%20Isle\"&gt;on the back&lt;/a&gt; of a giant turtle: &lt;a href=\"Shen-zin%20Su\"&gt;Shen-zin Su&lt;/a&gt;. The great sea turtle roamed Azeroth's oceans, perhaps the only contact pandaren had with the outside world. Eventually, they too lost contact with their mist-shrouded homeland. Players who choose to create a pandaren character will start their journey on the back of Shen-zin Su. When the great turtle is threatened, and their whole wandering homeland is in jeopardy of being swallowed by the sea, players will have to accelerate their training and spring into action.\nDuring their time on the turtle, players will first encounter the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Before they are finished, they'll have to make the most important decision of their lives: Which of the two factions will they support as they venture out to heal a world broken by the Cataclysm and threatened by a global war?\nJoining the Alliance.\nThe pandaren who join the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Grand Alliance&lt;/a&gt; are practitioners of the path of &lt;a href=\"Tushui\"&gt;Tushui&lt;/a&gt;, living a venerable life through meditation, rigorous training, and moral conviction, and doing what is right above all else. &lt;a href=\"Aysa%20Cloudsinger\"&gt;Aysa Cloudsinger&lt;/a&gt; is their representative. This faction is called &lt;a href=\"Tushui%20Pandaren\"&gt;Tushui Pandaren&lt;/a&gt;.\nJoining the Horde.\nThe pandaren of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; are followers of the philosophy of &lt;a href=\"Huojin\"&gt;Huojin&lt;/a&gt;. More direct than the contemplative philosophy of Tushui, adherents of Huojin believe that inaction is the greatest injustice and that it is honorable to defend one's homes and families regardless of cost. Their emissary is &lt;a href=\"Ji%20Firepaw\"&gt;Ji Firepaw&lt;/a&gt;. This faction is called &lt;a href=\"Huojin%20Pandaren\"&gt;Huojin Pandaren&lt;/a&gt;.\nCharacter.\nWhen starting a pandaren character, everyone starts out in the same outfit and will have no weapons, however, depending on the class will start with a different type of food that for the first time has stats. Players start at the &lt;a href=\"Shang%20Xi%20Training%20Grounds\"&gt;Shang Xi Training Grounds&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Wandering%20Isle\"&gt;Wandering Isle&lt;/a&gt; where a quest will automatically appear for you to speak with &lt;a href=\"Master%20Shang%20Xi\"&gt;Master Shang Xi&lt;/a&gt;. Players gain their first weapon from the nearby weapon racks after Shang Xi tells them to.\nThe first twelve to thirteen levels are played on the Wandering Isle, where you experience the aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"Shattering\"&gt;Shattering&lt;/a&gt; and deal with the native creatures that have become agitated by changes on the land. Players are requested to speak with &lt;a href=\"Shen-zin%20Su\"&gt;Shen-zin Su&lt;/a&gt;, but to do so they must gather the elemental spirits that have recently gone missing. After proving yourself several times, not only to your master but also the spirits, players finally speak to Shen-zin Su and discover what pains him. This pain ends up a crashed gunship in an area pandaren do not venture. After aiding the Horde survivors and then the Alliance crew, soon after they are asked to choose a path. Once the choice is made they are sent via hot air balloon to the capital city of the faction they chose.\nMounts.\nThe Pandaren's mount of choice are Dragon Turtles as their primary ground mount.\nNotes.\nThe pandaren do not have racial leaders, instead they have representatives from the Horde and Alliance.\nBefore choosing their faction (Alliance or Horde), pandaren player characters are subject to many restrictions that, in effect, make them their own third neutral faction:\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

These affable warriors rarely seek out danger or trouble, preferring instead to spend their time concocting new and tasty beverages for any brave enough to imbibe them. However, if attacked, the laughing brewmasters bring all of their pandaren agility and ferocity to bear! They even bring their beer to war! They are peerless &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s and world class &lt;a href=\"drink\"&gt;drink&lt;/a&gt;ers all in one!\nA warrior Hero, the brewmasters of &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; have emerged from the bamboo forests of their ancestors to bring their unique fighting style (and robust ales) to the highest bidder.\nHero names.\nMojo Dark-Ale, Sinjo Honeybrew, Kesha Wildbarley, Tatsa Sweetbarrow, Mushi Ale-Hearth, Jinto Reedwine, Masha Storm-Stout, and Polo Barrel-keg.\nNote: These are \"random hero\" names from Warcraft III (Pandaren Brewmaster). Although, several of the names are partially referenced in \"Dark Factions\".\nInformation.\nA warrior Hero, exceptional at absorbing damage and melee combat. The Brewmasters of Pandaria have emerged from the bamboo forests of their ancestors to bring their unique fighting style (and robust ales) to the highest bidder. Attacks land units.\nThe Pandaren Brewmaster is an excellent melee hero hired from the Tavern, being a mix of the Orcish &lt;a href=\"Blademaster%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Blademaster&lt;/a&gt; and Night Elven &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Hunter%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Demon Hunter&lt;/a&gt;. His Drunken Brawler skill combines the Blademaster's Critical Strike and Demon Hunter's Evasion abilities, making him particularly powerful in combat.\nDrunken Haze and Breath of Fire is a mana-intense but powerful combo; Drunken Haze slows down enemy units, while Breath of Fire deals considerable damage which is further improved if the units caught in its cone are affected by Drunken Haze. Drunken Haze is a powerful spell that works well against clumped units of any type.\nHis Ultimate is unique among other heroes - he splits into the three elementals &lt;a href=\"Earth%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Earth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Storm%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Storm&lt;/a&gt;. Each element is strong in its own right, and when properly micro'ed they can be extremely dangerous to deal with.\nThe most common setup for the Pandaren Brewmaster often revolves around using Drunken Haze and Breath of Fire, since it greatly hampers the enemy thanks to Drunken Haze's massive accuracy lowering at level 3, along with Breath of Fire's increased damage from Drunken Haze. Drunken Brawler is seldom used despite not being a mana skill because of the lack of versatility it provides.\nFor the Pandaren Brewmaster himself, all-round stat items will help him greatly, but those primarily focusing on Agility, Intelligence and attack speed will allow the Pandaren Brewmaster to shine the best in combat. Agility and attack speed helps him increase the chances of Drunken Brawler, while more Intelligence allows him to use Drunken Haze and Breath of Fire more consistently.\nSpells and abilities.\nBreath of ire.\nBreath of Fire damage is capped to 8 targets. This does not affect the amount of damage dealt by burning damage from the Breath of Fire / Drunken Haze Combination.\nCast Drunken Haze on a powerful unit, then use Breath of Fire to ignite them.\nRemember that the burn-over-time damage on Drunken Hazed enemies effectively doubles the damage of the spell. Due to this and due to the two spells costing the same amount of mana, it is almost always advantageous to cast Drunken Haze on the enemy and then using Breath of Fire.\nrunken Haze.\nUse Drunken Haze on powerful units then use Breath of Fire!\nDrunken Haze combines well with other spells. Remember that there is a minimum speed which units move at so slow effects don\u2019t stack well with each other. However, accuracy debuffs do stack. Casting this on a group of enemies while being supported by a &lt;a href=\"Necromancer%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt;'s Cripple and &lt;a href=\"Pit%20Lord%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Pit Lord&lt;/a&gt;'s Howl of Terror results in the enemies struck by Drunken Haze to deal very little damage in the event that they somehow hit.\nDrunken rawler (Passive).\nThis ability is similar to a combination of the Night Elf Demon Hunter\u2019s Evasion ability and the Orc Blade Master\u2019s Critical Strike ability. It is approximately two-thirds as effective as each of them. That\u2019s like getting 33% extra skill for your points!\nDrunken Brawler can allow for some very high damage attacks as the Pandaren Brewmaster gets equipment and levels.\nUnlike Critical Strike, Drunken Brawler doesn't have an animation whenever the Pandaren Brewmaster manages to land such a hit. \nDrunken Brawler does not work on buildings.\nStorm, arth, And Fire (Ultimate).\nNote: When this spell is activated, the Pandaren Brewmaster is temporarily removed from the game, and this also includes the items in his inventory.\nThis splits the Pandaren into three separate units with their own special abilities: &lt;a href=\"Storm%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Storm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Earth%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Earth&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt;. Storm is the most useful of the three with good micro skills, as he has Cyclone, Wind Walk and Dispel Magic. Use Cyclone against dangerous ground units or Heroes, and Wind Walk to quickly move him out of harms way if he gets targeted.\nEarth and Fire are melee brawlers with impressive health and damage. Earth is a mix of a Mountain Giant and Tauren, combining massive health with the ability to deal AoE damage and forcing enemy units to attack him. Fire is simply an Infernal, dealing massive damage coupled with a passive Immolation aura.\nRegardless, all three elements come with Resistant Skin. Earth has Spell Immunity. This makes the elements nearly impossible to focus down because they can only be killed by raw damage, and the three elements have 1,200, 1,700 and 1,100 health respectively, giving the Pandaren Brewmaster an effective health of 4,000 while the spell is active. If all three are somehow killed before the timer expires, then the Pandaren Brewmaster will die and need to be revived again. However, this should be unlikely given the spell's short duration of 45 seconds and each element's massive health pool.\nAppearances in The Frozen Throne campaigns.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20the%20Betrayer%20%28WC3%20NightElf%29\"&gt;Wrath of the Betrayer&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles%20pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; was in the &lt;a href=\"brewmaster%20drinking%20area\"&gt;brewmaster drinking area&lt;/a&gt; in the southwest corner of the map. He gave &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Slippers%20of%20Agility%20%2B3\"&gt;Slippers of Agility +3&lt;/a&gt; before closing up his shop.\n&lt;a href=\"Chen%20Stormstout\"&gt;Chen Stormstout&lt;/a&gt; is the most prominently featured Brewmaster and is present throughout the &lt;a href=\"Founding%20of%20Durotar\"&gt;Founding of Durotar&lt;/a&gt; campaign, albeit only if you complete an optional quest to recruit him.\nTwo brewmasters appear in the blood elf campaign. In the secret mission &lt;a href=\"The%20Crossing%20%28WC3%20BloodElf%29\"&gt;The Crossing&lt;/a&gt;, one shows up in the final wave to try to stop the blood elves from escaping through the portal. The second one is a secret character. To get the brewmaster, however, the player must survive all the waves of attackers on The Crossing level, including defeating the aforementioned pandaren brewmaster. If successful, they'll control not only Kael and Vashj during the next mission &lt;a href=\"The%20Search%20for%20Illidan%20%28WC3%20BloodElf%29\"&gt;The Search for Illidan&lt;/a&gt;, but also a randomly-named brewmaster."}

{"id": "16947", "revid": "38791128", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=16947", "title": "Pandaren Empire", "text": "The Pandaren Empire was the central government of the &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; people in their homeland of &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;. It did not include lands west of the &lt;a href=\"Serpent%27s%20Spine\"&gt;Serpent's Spine&lt;/a&gt;. The last Emperor of Pandaria was &lt;a href=\"Shaohao\"&gt;Shaohao&lt;/a&gt;. After he disappeared, the power in Pandaria shifted to the local level instead.\nHistory.\nThe Pandaren Empire dates back 12,000 years, 2,000 years before the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;sundering of the world&lt;/a&gt;. Denizens of a wondrous and fertile land, the pandaren once labored under the oppressive thumb of a monstrous race of ancient warlords known as the &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt;. Through tenacity, diplomacy, and a unique form of unarmed combat, the pandaren staged a successful revolution that deposed the mogu and established a pandaren empire that would prosper for centuries.\nDuring the bleak days that preceded the sundering of the world, when &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;demons&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;flooded onto Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and threw the entirety of the mortal realm into jeopardy, the &lt;a href=\"Shaohao\"&gt;last Emperor of the pandaren&lt;/a&gt; discovered a way to protect his land from the devastation by traveling across his empire, to the temples of the August Celestials, and there allowing himself to be possessed by the &lt;a href=\"Sha\"&gt;Sha&lt;/a&gt; Primes, and then exorcised of them, and his corresponding negative emotions with them. Free of his negative emotions he began a ritual to sever Pandaria from the rest of Azeroth and move it out of harm's way. Though he eventually succeeded by becoming one with the land, he had failed to account for one final emotion; pride. Feeling Pandaria needed no help from outsiders, Shaohao had become possessed by the &lt;a href=\"Sha%20of%20Pride\"&gt;Sha of Pride&lt;/a&gt;, and when he became one with his land, the presence of this final Sha Prime within his soul caused Pandaria to become enveloped in an impenetrable barrier of &lt;a href=\"Mists%20of%20Pandaria%20%28lore%29\"&gt;mist&lt;/a&gt;; concealing it for ten thousand years from the outside world. After Emperor Shaohao disappeared, the power in Pandaria shifted to the local level. With all threats walled off there was no longer a need for an emperor anymore, making Shaohao the last Emperor of Pandaria.\nEmperors.\nThe Pandaren Empire has been ruled by &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"jinyu\"&gt;jinyu&lt;/a&gt; and even &lt;a href=\"hozen\"&gt;hozen&lt;/a&gt; emperors. The majority of known emperors appear to have been pandaren, but this may or may not reflect the empire's lengthy history.\nLegends say that an ancient &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; emperor crafted the first &lt;a href=\"Jeweled%20panther%20mounts\"&gt;jeweled panther&lt;/a&gt; for his son after the boy's twin brother died of an illness.\nIn the RPG.\nThe Pandaren Empire was founded before the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt; of the world. It shared resources and mystic knowledge with the haughty &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; of central &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. As the night elves' obsession with the forces of magic drove them to the brink of madness, the gentle pandaren severed ties and left the night elves behind forever. The pandaren clans, or &lt;a href=\"shao%27din\"&gt;shao'din&lt;/a&gt;s, traveled far across the seas and established crude but beautiful cities of stone and sturdy &lt;a href=\"bambus\"&gt;bambus&lt;/a&gt; reed on an island they named &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;. They lived in peace for many generations until the Sundering. Some, including pandaren &lt;a href=\"wardancer\"&gt;wardancer&lt;/a&gt;s, then ventured forth from Pandaria, wandering Kalimdor and other lands on journeys of discovery. Wielding thin, delicately balanced blades, the pandaren wardancers quickly established themselves as some of the deadliest swordsmen of the world. A splinter group of pandaren arrived on Kalimdor in the aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; and has &lt;a href=\"Pandaren%20settlement\"&gt;established itself&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon region&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Note: The Pandaren Empire was originally an April Fools joke back when \"\" was still in beta, with the Pandaren being announced as a fifth race. The text, originally posted on the &lt;a href=\"http%3A//classic.battle.net/war3/pandaren/\"&gt;Battle.net&lt;/a&gt; site, was eventually re-adapted for the RPG.

{"id": "355714", "revid": "3117428", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=355714", "title": "Pandaren Revolution", "text": "The Pandaren Revolution was an armed uprising, initially consisting of &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"monk\"&gt;monk&lt;/a&gt;s, which sought to overthrow the oppressive and decadent &lt;a href=\"mogu%20empire\"&gt;mogu empire&lt;/a&gt; who held them in a state of slavery, around 12,000 years before the opening of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;. Utilizing a new, unusual, but highly effective form of unarmed combat, the pandaren achieved stunning victories against seemingly superior mogu forces under &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Lao-Fe\"&gt;Emperor Lao-Fe&lt;/a&gt;. These victories gave heart to the many other races in mogu servitude, and the rebellion quickly began to grow to encompass a wide range of different races, such as the &lt;a href=\"jinyu\"&gt;jinyu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"hozen\"&gt;hozen&lt;/a&gt;, united by a common cause, and whose racial skills greatly contributed to the revolution's continued success. With its entire infrastructure based upon the work of slaves, any sense of order in the empire rapidly began to crumble as more slaves flocked to the uprising.\nIn response to this, as well as a number of major defeats, Lao-Fe retreated to the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt;, the seat of mogu power, with the majority of his forces. Now forced into a direct battle, the rebel forces launched an all-out assault on the vale, seeking to permanently defeat the mogu in one decisive blow. Although having sustained heavy casualties, including their leader, the revolutionaries succeeded in routing Lao-Fe's army and decisively shattering imperial mogu power, Lao-Fe himself also being killed.\nThe Pandaren Revolution marked the end of an era in &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, and the commencement of a new one where the many races of the region enjoyed full autonomy and, for the most part, flourished as a result. In the wake of the war, the &lt;a href=\"Pandaren%20Empire\"&gt;Pandaren Empire&lt;/a&gt; was founded. Based on the principles of justice, wisdom, and benevolence, this new empire worked to maintain peace between the region's disparate races who had achieved the impossible together.\nPeace for the pandaren's new nation was not to last, however. The mogu's greatest ally, the &lt;a href=\"Zandalar%20tribe\"&gt;Zandalar tribe&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;trolls&lt;/a&gt;, spent the next 100 years after the revolution organizing themselves and then launched an invasion of Pandaria, beginning the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Troll%20Wars\"&gt;Zandalari Troll Wars&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe cruelty of an empire.\nFollowing the death of the Thunder King, &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen\"&gt;Lei Shen&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Uldum\"&gt;Uldum&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"mogu%20empire\"&gt;mogu empire&lt;/a&gt; entered a period of eclipse, where it lost much of the power and lands it once held. Despite this, it still remained powerful enough to retain many areas and continued to rule over a vast helot class of slaves from various races across the region, which were used to perform a wide variety of functions. Lei Shen's successors, in tandem with this, began to become exponentially more cruel in their treatment of the vast amount of slaves under mogu rule. The final mogu emperor, &lt;a href=\"Lao-Fe\"&gt;Lao-Fe&lt;/a&gt;, was proficient enough in this regard to earn the title of 'Slavebinder' early in his reign.\nTo maintain obedience among the empire's slaves, he was known to tear families apart, even for mild or benign transgressions. One such common punishment was for the children of slaves who were perceived to be disobedient to be sent to the &lt;a href=\"Serpent%27s%20Spine\"&gt;Serpent's Spine&lt;/a&gt; wall to act as fodder in the ruthless &lt;a href=\"Mantid\"&gt;Mantid&lt;/a&gt; Swarm. One such fate befell the son of a &lt;a href=\"pandaren%20brewmaster\"&gt;pandaren brewmaster&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kang\"&gt;Kang&lt;/a&gt;, his wife also being slain attempting to stop the seizure. Dismayed and broken by these events, Kang wondered to him himself: how could the mogu intentionally cause such pain?\nAfter much meditation, Kang came to a radical conclusion. The extreme cruelty towards their slaves, he concluded, was not a sign of the mogu's strength; it was a symptom of their weakness. The mogu had become dependant on their servants; without them, they were nothing. Kang resigned to dedicate his life to exposing the vulnerability of the mogu, however long it would take, and at whatever personal cost to himself.\nThe way of the monk.\nThis was a great challenge, however, as, apart from those being sent to the Serpent's Spine, slaves were strictly forbidden from touching any weapon, under pain of death. Thus, Kang began to train to use his body itself as a weapon. To hide his doings from the ever-vigilant mogu, he disguised his movements as a simple artistic dance.\nAfter perfecting these techniques, Kang displayed what he had learned to some of his fellow slaves, challenging them to attempt to strike him. None could do so, his movements allowing him to evade completely evade harm every time he was attacked. So awed were the other slaves by this new form of fighting that they begged Kang to teach them to do the same. Kang eagerly obliged and, over time, this new style of fighting spread throughout many of the pandaren in the empire, and would become known thereafter as 'the way of the monk'.\nAs the way of the monk began to spread, so too did the fear that the mogu, who had become aware of the emerging combat style, would soon take swift and brutal action against it. In response to this, Kang and his apprentices relocated to the peaks of &lt;a href=\"Kun-Lai%20Summit\"&gt;Kun-Lai Summit&lt;/a&gt;, where they constructed a small &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20White%20Tiger\"&gt;monastery&lt;/a&gt; and continued their training in secret. At Kun-Lai, however, Kang discovered something entirely unexpected\u2014the prison of &lt;a href=\"Xuen\"&gt;Xuen&lt;/a&gt;, the White Tiger\u2014who had been imprisoned by the Thunder King generations ago. Kang communed with the &lt;a href=\"August%20Celestial\"&gt;August Celestial&lt;/a&gt; who taught him of the secrets of inner strength that lay within every heart. Kang immediately passed on Xuen's teachings to the other monks. Finally, they were ready to fight.\nRevolution.\nThe first objective of this new, small, but determined revolution was the ancient &lt;a href=\"Mogu%27shan%20Vaults\"&gt;Mogu'shan Vaults&lt;/a&gt; which housed the mighty &lt;a href=\"Engine%20of%20Nalak%27sha\"&gt;Engine of Nalak'sha&lt;/a&gt;. There, the pandaren succeeded in driving the mogu away from the source of their flesh-shaping power. This devastatingly successful surprise attack halted the creation of any more of the mogu's twisted constructs, a significant blow to their power. In addition to boosting the morale of the pandaren monks, the victory also attracted several other enslaved races to their cause. The &lt;a href=\"jinyu\"&gt;jinyu&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"grummle\"&gt;grummle&lt;/a&gt;s, the &lt;a href=\"hozen\"&gt;hozen&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"yaungol\"&gt;yaungol&lt;/a&gt; and possibly humans and defected Zandalari trolls all joined the rebellion in an effort to topple the mogu empire. \nKang carried &lt;a href=\"Sheilun%2C%20Staff%20of%20the%20Mists\"&gt;Sheilun&lt;/a&gt; for years, all throughout the Pandaren Revolution. The staff did not win the war. It was Kang's words that galvanized the mogu's slaves, and it was Kang's will that drove him onward when all seemed lost. To defend himself, he used Sheilun to keep the mogu's swords and axes from carving his heart from his chest.\nDespite desperate efforts by the mogu, the revolution began to steadily grow in size and scope, and Kang was proved correct: the mogu \"had\" become overly-reliant on their slaves. As more and more slaves rebelled, the empire fell into chaos. The sturdy Grummles, responsible for much of the empire's communications, disrupted these communications as well as mogu supply lines. The warlike Yaungol launched effective raids against imperial forces in the northwest of the empire. The crafty Hozen used their skill in digging to infiltrate even the mightiest mogu fortresses, rendering them ineffective. The wise jinyu used their abilities of communion with the water spirits to gain glimpses into the future and subsequently informed Kang where and when to attack and when to retreat.\nUnable to quash the revolt, Emperor Lao-Fe and his armies retreated inside the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt;, the royal seat of mogu power. Aware of the fact that the mogu would be able to sustain themselves in the vale indefinitely, Kang decided that the rebels would finally have to face the mogu in open battle. Thus, the multiracial alliance launched a massive assault on the vale, forcing the mogu into a decisive battle. Kang himself led the charge, even reaching the emperor himself and engaging him in hand-to-hand combat. After a brutal fight, Kang succeeded in slaying Lao-Fe, though he suffered mortal wounds himself. The remaining mogu forces soon either surrendered or fled the field.\nElated with victory, many of the now-freed slaves considered seeking revenge against the surviving mogu, slaughtering them as they had done to their slaves for generations.\nYet one of Kang's most promising students, &lt;a href=\"Song\"&gt;Song&lt;/a&gt;, a secretive keeper of pandaren history, calmed their blood lust. Having previously memorized many of Master Kang's philosophies and tales, Song now re-told them again and again to the liberated slaves, reminding them that justice, not revenge, would prove that they could rise above senseless cruelty, as the mogu could not. This, he claimed, would be a sign of their moral strength in the face of the degenerate weaknesses and cruelties of their previous rulers.\nAftermath.\nAfter the success of the revolution, an era of prosperity began in and around the Vale of Eternal Blossoms. All the races that had now gained their freedom, established their own autonomous nations and factions and flourished with their hard-won freedom. The pandaren went on to establish &lt;a href=\"Pandaren%20Empire\"&gt;their own empire&lt;/a&gt; but, unlike the mogu, theirs was built on the principles of justice, wisdom, and benevolence. The pandaren dedicated themselves to preserving peace among the freed races who had fought for each others' freedom. They succeeded in this regard for many years, with the races who took part in the revolution living in coexistence with each other.\nA century after their success over the mogu, however, the mogu's allies, the &lt;a href=\"Zandalar%20tribe\"&gt;Zandalari trolls&lt;/a&gt;, declared war on and attacked the embryonic pandaren civilization, thus sparking the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Troll%20Wars\"&gt;Zandalari Troll Wars&lt;/a&gt;, which once more threw the pandaren's future into doubt.\nLegacy.\nThe Pandaren Revolution changed the political and social landscape of southern &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor%20%28landmass%29\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. Many of the freed races went on to pursue their own paths. This led to such events as the Yaungol Migration, where many Yaungol began to venture far north, eventually becoming the ancestors of the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt;. The freedom of the numerous races under mogu control also led to an age where diverse culture flourished in the region, each race now having the freedom to practice their own individual traditions.\nThe Pandaren Empire, founded on the ruins of the mogu's, succeeded in maintaining peace and prosperity across the region for many years, allowing it to thrive. Its last emperor, &lt;a href=\"Shaohao\"&gt;Shaohao&lt;/a&gt;, was responsible for shielding Pandaria from the worst of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, preserving much of it where other lands were decimated. In addition to these advancements, the revolution also gave birth to a new type of warrior, the &lt;a href=\"monk\"&gt;monk&lt;/a&gt;. This new and different form of fighting was subsequently further developed and practiced throughout the coming millennia, and would still remain a major aspect of pandaren society when Pandaria was eventually &lt;a href=\"Mists%20of%20Pandaria\"&gt;rediscovered&lt;/a&gt;."}

Drink is in every aspect of pandaren life; and because of the craft involved, a tradition of brewing potent fluids has become a cultural institution for the gentle people of &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"pandaren%20brewmaster\"&gt;pandaren brewmaster&lt;/a&gt;s travel the world for new and exotic ingredients and recipes. These affable yet deadly warriors practice a unique combination of healing arts and martial skill. With their knowledge of alchemy, &lt;a href=\"potion\"&gt;potion&lt;/a&gt;-making and brewery, the pandaren have created superb ales and liquors that have become a welcome drink at any adventurer's table either before or after a battle. \nThe brews hold magical properties, as plants, berries, and fungi that harbor powerful spirits are often included as ingredients in whiskeys, ales and other alcoholic beverages. Distilling these ingredients focuses potent &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;.\nTypes of pandaren brews.\nBravery Brew.\nThis stout and powerful ale have remarkable qualities when it comes to establishing feelings of camaraderie and kinship, especially before a battle. With a thick, nearly molasses-like taste and bittersweet foam, this ale has become the favorite of many &lt;a href=\"Rifleman%23Dwarven%20rifleman\"&gt;dwarven riflemen&lt;/a&gt; companies. A keg of this brew holds 20 mugs' worth of ale. \nChou's Steadying Cider.\nMany have felt the chill of fear creep up when facing the minions of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. To watch &lt;a href=\"ghoul\"&gt;ghoul&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"abomination\"&gt;abomination&lt;/a&gt;s rush across the fields of war to savage foes with hooked chains, claws and teeth can shake a warrior to his core. &lt;a href=\"Chou%20Ling%20Sing\"&gt;Chou&lt;/a&gt; the brewmaster despises the Scourge for the terror and ugliness they spread. He brews this strong drink to aid those who fight against the tides of &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; that threaten the world. This drink is strong plum cider that grants the drinker the ability to detect undead.\nDrunken Master's Secret Tonic.\nThe pandaren brewmaster Chou Ling Sing introduced the magnificent brew to the acrobats of &lt;a href=\"Slink%20Strong%27s%20Goblin%20Circus\"&gt;Slink Strong's Goblin Circus&lt;/a&gt; as a gift for teaching him the tricks of &lt;a href=\"goblin%20tumbling\"&gt;goblin tumbling&lt;/a&gt;. Since then, many have copied the brew's recipe and it is enjoyed by many a stealthy, acrobatically inclined performer. The tonic is potent, and a single swig from a bottle can make the drinker appear as if she were inebriated.\nFiery Belly Ale.\nThis powerful, pepper-flavored ale often leaves the surprised drinker gasping for cool water to sooth the burning in his throat. Fiery Belly ale is a harsh, unforgiving drink that leaves a steady flame in the imbiber's gut. Many &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s have found this a pleasant sensation, and seeing a precious keg of this drink in their possession is almost becoming common. This ale is an inebriating beer that gives the drinker the ability to belch flames. A tell-tale churning and burning in the gut indicate that the special properties are active. Drinking more than 3 mugs is dangerous and may cause the drinker to vomit flame at an inappropriate moment.\nHong's Fighting Lager.\nCombat is a state of grace amongst the &lt;a href=\"shodo-pan\"&gt;shodo-pan&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Pandaren%20Empire\"&gt;pandaren empire&lt;/a&gt;; and as much as it is an art form, it is thirsty work. \"Hong's fighting lager\" revivifies fatigue and frightened soldiers and warrior after fighting a long and difficult battle. It is also highly valued for its crisp wheat taste and subtle honey and citron-like accents.\nWounded Warrior's Whiskey.\nTo the pandaren, whiskey is a drink of fortitude. A good whiskey can make a warrior strong enough to face 10.000, so the pandaren proverb goes. This brewmaster's whiskey has incredibly potent healing properties, and a wounded warrior can become as strong as a &lt;a href=\"lion\"&gt;lion&lt;/a&gt; after drinking this powerful liquid."}

However, if attacked, the laughing brewmasters bring all of their pandaren agility and ferocity to bear! They even bring their beer to war! They are peerless &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s and world class &lt;a href=\"drink\"&gt;drink&lt;/a&gt;ers all in one!\nA rare few pandaren walk outside of their culture's normal ways. Brewmasters are those pandaren given to a fondness for drink. Rather than them being relegated to some outcast place in society, however, pandaren highly regard those who show such a propensity. These pandaren, like all their kind, master a craft: theirs is the creation of ales, wines and other spirits. \nYet the term \"spirits\" is not used facetiously among these folk, for those who would become brewmasters learn which plants, berries, and fungi harbor the most powerful spirits. They harvest these spirits and awaken them, allowing the one fortunate enough to drink one of these Master Brews to actually see and commune with the spirit.\nA warrior Hero, the brewmasters of &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; have emerged from the bamboo forests of their ancestors to bring their unique fighting style (and robust ales) to the highest bidder.\nAppearance in The Frozen Throne campaigns.\nIn the fourth mission of the Sentinels campaign a &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles%20pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; was in the Pandaren Brewing area in southwest corner of the map.

In the secret mission, one shows up in the final wave to try to stop the blood elves from escaping through the portal. The second one is a secret character. To get the Brewmaster, however, the player must survive all the waves of attackers on the tower defense style secret level, including defeating the alliance allied Pandaren. If successful, they'll control not only Kael &amp; Vashj during the next mission, but also a random-named brewmaster.\nIn the RPG.\nThe brewmasters learn their strange, drunken wardance from these spirits.

If pandaren are not the new race, well, at least I get to display my ideas to all. :)\nA alternate to being a Alliance faction is to make them naturally neutral. Give them neutral status with every race but whenever you raise your rep with a dwarf (or any alliance race) all five of the Horde races lower in rep. It would be a fun system allowing for pandarens to keep their independent nature since each independent pandaren would choose who to join. Another race that could follow this would maybe be the Goblins since they just sell themselves to the highest bidder. -Akatski\nHistory.\nThe pandaren hail from Pandaria, and have always been living in peace there. It seemed like the perfect place, as all beings, whether they were beasts, sentient beings, or elementals, lived there in natural harmony. The pandaren, lovers of nature and peace, only hunted and fought when needed. They prospered, with the help their kobold allies, who lived in the mountain region of Pandaria.\nThe reason for no race ever finding Pandaria was a magical shrine that gave off an aura of safety and passiveness. Any being sentient to come near the island would dismiss it as too primitive or small to deal with, and would sail off. So even though they were close to Theramore, the pandarens did not fear being attacked by vicious races and beings. Although the pandarens know not of who or what created the shrine, they respected it greatly, naming it Safekeeper of Pandaria.\nStill, several pandaren decided to venture out and explore the world, after taken solemn vows to never reveal where Pandaria was. Upon visiting the Alliance and Horde territories, the pandaren were as fascinated with these new races as the two factions were fascinated with them. The pandarens liked most of the races, but were extremely fond of the Ironforge Dwarves. The titan-created race and the bear beings loved to share stories, have a good mug of ale, and discover secrets of the past together. Still, the pandarens were careful as to not say where Pandaria was, nor get drawn into joining the political Alliance.\nSuddenly, tragedy struck the pandaren. Blood elves, sensing the power of the Safekeeper of Pandaria, managed to locate the island by their incurable lust for magic and the arcane. Sneaking onto Pandaria, they approached the shrine and siphoned the magic from it until the shrine turned black as coal.\nSeveral of the pandaren witnessed this, unable to do anything before their beloved shrine was depleted of magic. What they experienced next was the sky turning red, and infernals raining down from the sky. The Burning Legion was attacking Pandaria.\nMany pandarens died that day, a day the pandarens now call \u2018The Shattering of Peace.\u2019 The Burning Legion swarmed across Pandaria like a plague, corrupting the wildlife, the animals, kobolds of the mountains, and even pandaren. Still the pandarens fought back with the strength and agility they were known for, and prevented the loss of Pandaria in total. A good deal of pandarens survived, several parts of the land remained uncorrupted, and a tribe of the mountain kobolds (who had helped the pandarens) were safe.\nThe Shattering of Peace is named not only because of the Burning Legion, but because of how they joined the war between the Alliance and the Horde. When the demonic armies fell from the skies, several of the traveling brewmasters implored the races of the outer world to help them. The Ironforge Dwarves came, and many fought in the name of friendship. The humans, night elves, and gnomes also came, because the friend of their friend was a friend, and the Burning Legion was their mortal enemy.\nBut when asking the Horde, they seemed unsympathetic. Thrall and Cairne, the main leaders of the Horde, did sent orc, troll and tauren troops to help Pandaria. But the Forsaken and the blood elf leaders of Silvermoon, refused to send any help, and even implored the other Horde leaders to not waste troops on such \"meaningless\" creatures.\nShocked and hurt by this, the pandaren informed Silvermoon that blood elves had destroyed the Safekeeper. The blood elves denied it, saying that they could not be found guilty for the actions of few. Although the pandarens did not make any demands for the magic-starved elves to help them, they were upset by the cold, uncaring answer they received.\nWhen Pandaria was stable again, the pandaren realized that the Burning Legion would probably come back, even though they did not know why they came in the first place. Did the blood elves summon them, unintentionally or purposefully? Were those blood elves from Silvermoon or from the Dark Portal? And why did the Burning Legion come with such a force after the Safekeeper was ruined?\nThe pandarens realized they couldn\u2019t do this alone, and now the other races knew where Pandaria was. So they knew a treaty with either faction was in order. They knew right then that the Horde was out of the question, so they went to the Alliance for help. Magni Bronzebeard, leader of the Ironforge dwarves, welcomed the pandaren and the other leaders agreed to allow Pandaria\u2019s beings into the Alliance.\nBut the treaty was a shaky one at best. Pandarens were used to non-political, peaceful manners of life, while the Alliance was full of the opposite. Cultures clashed, and the pandarens found themselves surrounded by beings who seemed to love to squabble amongst one another, to create weapons of death, and to fight against the Horde with fiery passion. Although the pandarens agreed to help the Alliance in the war, they did not enjoy such battles; they would keep an eye out on these beings, even their friends of Ironforge.\nIt wasn\u2019t like the Alliance was too friendly towards the pandarens either. The humans believed the pandarens to be drunken bears, and remembered how one of their brewmasters, a hero of Pandaria, helped defeat Admiral Proudmoore. The gnomes sympathized for the pandaren in almost losing their home, but the halfling race could not understand why the ursine race disliked using engineered weapons. The majority of night elves and dwarves were passive towards the pandarens, even though several pandarens joined the Silver Hand and the Cenarion Circle. The races basically wanted the pandarens to prove themselves as capable warriors and allies, not drunken bears.\nAs one of the survivors of the Burning Legion and a proud representative of Pandaria, the world of Azeroth and mysteries within Outland are yours to explore. Discover the cause for the attack on Pandaria, and bring justice and peace to the beings of the world.\nClasses.\nThe pandaren live their lives training to perfect a certain art, these arts are the most important part of their lives. They have slightly different ways of going about the practices of them.\nWarrior \u2013 Though the pandaren prefer a life of peace, the dangers of the world around them and their new involvement with the Alliance the brave pikemen and Wardancers of the pandaren are called out to defend their new allies. The warriors of the pandaren are the only ones to regret any chance to use their art. Preferring to react to violence instead of acting upon others, the pandaren warriors use their strength and agility to fight all enemies of Pandaria and their new allies. Warrior pandarens start with a one-handed sword and shield, and have training in one-handed maces, daggers, and staves.\nPaladin - When they met the paladins of the Silver Hand, the pandarens were excited to meet those that preferred to be defensive and help others as well. Also, they felt that they had found a kindred spirit in the paladins. Adapting the code of the paladin to their own culture they now practice a medium of balance, though they are slowly adapting to the full code of the paladin. So, learning of the Light and having faith in its justice, now there are now some pandaren paladins. Paladin pandarens start with a two-handed mace, and have training in one-handed maces, shields, and one-handed swords.\nHunter \u2013 Having always had a strong affinity with nature being a hunter has always come natural for the pandaren. They quickly befriend the natural life of Pandaria. Even when Pandaria were peaceful, there were many who patrolled the island to bring home food, and those that explored Kalimdor. Now they use their talents to track down and fire upon their enemies. Hunter Pandarens start with a one-handed sword and a bow, and have training in daggers.\nDruid - With an incredible love for nature and saving life, pandarens easily adapted to the druidic magics. The Cenarion Circle was happy to accept the pandarens, especially since the pandarens did not care for waging war upon the Horde as much. Druid pandarens start with a staff.\nMage \u2013 Although the pandaren have been depicted as leaving the Night Elves due to their use of magic it was their abuse of it that caused this. Contrary to common belief the pandaren continue to practice magic, and even have a strong resistance to the addiction it causes using it only for safe and practical manners. After all, life needs the heat of fire, the coolness of frost, and the force of the arcane. So pandarens can be strong magi. Mage pandarens start with a staff, and have training in daggers and wands.\nPriest - Most pandarens priests do not believe in gods or a strong presence (although some have adapted to the Light, Elune or the spirits), but all believe that saving others and helping oneself are two needed skills in life. Pandaren priests call upon their inner power for their healing magic though they stubbornly refuse to use it for offensive purposes. Priest pandarens start off with a one-handed mace, and have training in daggers, wands and staves. Pandarens priests get two new priest abilities as well. At level 10, pandaren priests get Swig of Faith, which is like Renew but regains mana and gives the target a Spirit lowering debuff for a little bit of time. At level 20, pandaren priests get Violence Retribution, a magic debuff placed on enemy targets that deals small holy damage to the enemy if it attacks physically or casts a spell.\nMale Pandaren Personalities.\nCharacter Creation Tips - Fur Color (different combos of white and black), Face (different facial looks), Hip Flasks (different kinds of small kegs, canteens and/or doodads on the pandaren\u2019s hips), Facial Features (hair-styled fur and/or battle scars on cheeks or ear), and Claws (length and color of claws, some are chipped).\n\"Ale is my bear necessity.\"\n\"It\u2019s against the law to kill me!\"\n\"Am I black with white fur or white with black fur?

I hope you like my suggestions. And if Blizzard sees this, don\u2019t mind taking some of my ideas; in fact, please do. I definitely won\u2019t sue. :)\nGaming Steve's Pandaren Debunk.\nExcerpted from &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.gamingsteve.com/archives/2005/10/rumor_control_w_1.php\"&gt;October 31, 2005 Rumor Control: World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;:\nUnknown at this time, but don't rule out any race (including the \"ugly\" Draenei). Well, any race except the &lt;a href=\"Pandaren\"&gt;Pandaren&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the editors of the gaming magazines were brought to Blizzard's offices to view The Burning Crusade for the first time, there were dozens of posters and artwork depicting the Pandaren as the new Alliance race. At the time Blizzard was 80% certain that the Pandaren were going to be the new Alliance race and it was presented as such. However, due to various complex reasons, there is now a zero percent chance of this happening. At best you might be seeing non-killable Pandaren NPCs in the game.\nConsidering the charged political reasons surrounding this issue I do not believe that Blizzard will change their mind on this decision.\"\nAlso from Gaming Steve (no source link)? \n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wowguru.com/gallery/imageview.php%3FscreenshotID%3D1073%26amp%3BtypeID%3D3\"&gt;Image&lt;/a&gt; showing Pandaren as race in character creation screen, but note the Blood Elf has no weapon.\"\nOf course, the above is all hearsay, whoever did post this information likely has no idea what they are talking about. Blizzards gauntlet of NDA's security and lawyers would quickly squash anyone trying to post real info except in the case that they wanted it so or were close enough to the actual release not to care. (re: the burning crusade leak)\nAs for China's so called \"law\" against the representation of killing a panda, this is easily debunked. First the very existence of Chen Stormstout who in any campaign played by anyone would die repeatedly should be sufficient. Take into account that the law in question is actually a conservation law against killing panda's and you can begin to see that it is no real obstacle. Before WoW, Warcraft III was the #1 Blizzard game in China.\nSee also.\n\"To add your idea to the list use the template\" ."}

This is one of the central philosophies of &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"geomancer\"&gt;geomancy&lt;/a&gt;, and no one is more intimate with these energies than the pandaren transcendent. Seeking to embody the sentient formative powers of the universe and bottle them within her form, the transcendent is an aesthete, a &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;, and most of all a mystic.\nFew pandaren &lt;a href=\"healer\"&gt;healer&lt;/a&gt;s and wise men seek out this path; even powerful geomancers rarely learn of the necessary hidden techniques to transform into beings composed of primal forces. Codified within ancient texts, and layered within the rituals of pandaren culture, are the keys to this hidden discipline. Yet only the wisest and most insightful pandaren discover it.\nPandaren revere transcendents as embodiments of wisdom: the spirit of the universe made flesh, residing in the shell of a pandaren host. These are the pandaren\u2019s ultimate heroes: Spiritual avatars capable of summoning vast storms of lighting, smashing mountains with their terrible fists, and breathing winds into existence. Yet the techniques do not come without sacrifice.\nPandaren transcendents are sworn to protect the pandaren people. Anyone seeking to bring war to the pandaren would soon find themselves at the mercy of the transcendents\u2019 wrath, amid a devastating whirl of blades and magic.\nPandaren transcendents in the World.\nThe pandaren who discover this path do so only after years of study and experience. Although only a handful of pandaren alive today travel the path of the transcendent, they all protect their people, and swear no loyalty other than to serve the pandaren and the spirits of their people.\nPandaren transcendents spend much of their time in seclusion in the &lt;a href=\"Pandaren%20Empire\"&gt;Pandaren Empire&lt;/a&gt;. Those who venture beyond its shores are dedicated to rooting out secrets, defending the nation, and building relations with those few who would prove to be useful allies. Those who remain in &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; are often secluded hermits who protect a given section of the empire, defending it from potential attack by angry elementals, divine spirits and other threats that most of Azeroth\u2019s people cannot understand. These transcendents often counsel geomancers and other pandaren of note, serving to temper all of the decisions of Pandaria\u2019s rulers with wisdom and spirituality."}

Pandaren are by all accounts graceful and skilled warriors. Their wardancers epitomize the pandaren art of warfare \u2014 and for the wardancers, battle is indeed an art. Their title does not come coincidentally. Their movements are precise and fluid; they appear to dance through a battlefield, their blades flashing silver, blood spraying into the air, and bodies toppling as they move. While wardancers are deadly, they, like all pandaren, are inherently peaceful. The greatest hope of the wardancer is to not have to use his skills. However, in &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth\u2019s&lt;/a&gt; current age, the wardancers\u2019 skills are needed more than ever. Wardancers move out to confront demons, undead and other horrid creatures, their hearts lightened by the thought that, through their battles, other creatures will live \u2014 perhaps, other creatures will never know battle.\nResplendent in their elaborate &lt;a href=\"bambus\"&gt;bambus&lt;/a&gt; armor and dangerous with their shaktani warblades to hand, the wardancers are the very epitome of the &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; outlook on the world. To the pandaren, each individual has an art, an art that he or she should spend his or her life perfecting. For the wardancers, this art is the art of violence and war. Wardancers are not warlike, however; they are perhaps the world's only artists who regret every opportunity they are given to practice their art. Nevertheless, they save their regret for purifications undertaken after combat. In the midst of battle, few sights can equal that of a pandaren wardancer, performing a lethal dance of steel and blood, moving to the sacred song that all wardancers are taught to hear within the din of violence.\nWardancers are at the forefront of any pandaren war effort, cutting a swathe through the enemy. Though they are trained to use effective group tactics during their careers as pikemen, wardancers do not operate together. Instead, each wardancer operates alone on the battlefield, supported by those pikemen over whom he is both captain and mentor. He dances the shaktani dance alone and with grim determination. Wardancers are backed up by pandaren who throw pan-spears at the enemy, while guarding the flanks of their champion &lt;a href=\"pikeman\"&gt;pikemen&lt;/a&gt;. Wielding thin, delicately balanced blades, the pandaren wardancers quickly established themselves as some of the deadliest swordsmen of the world.\nThe iconic pandaren wardancer wears a long, black tunic with gold buttons and gold trim. He wields a delicate shaktani sword in one hand, and his other hand is empty. He balances on the balls of his feet, eyes watching, and when the time is right, he is a spinning, leaping weapon of destruction.\nThey can speak &lt;a href=\"Common%20%28language%29\"&gt;Common&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20%28language%29\"&gt;Dwarven&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Pandaren%20%28language%29\"&gt;Pandaren&lt;/a&gt;."}

Only those pandaren who left their homeland on the back of the great turtle &lt;a href=\"Shen-zin%20Su\"&gt;Shen-zin Su&lt;/a&gt;, including the renowned &lt;a href=\"pandaren%20brewmaster\"&gt;pandaren brewmaster&lt;/a&gt;s, have been seen outside of their homeland since; some even came to the aid of the other races during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;.\nPandaria is featured in the \"World of Warcraft\" expansion \"\".\nHistory.\nOrdering of Azeroth.\nDuring the ordering of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Aman%27Thul\"&gt;Aman'Thul&lt;/a&gt; destroyed the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;Y'Shaarj&lt;/a&gt; by ripping it out from the crust of the planet. Its remains fell back on the southern portion of the original &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor%20%28landmass%29\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; supercontinent, which would one day become known as Pandaria. After the war, the &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt; servants led by &lt;a href=\"Ra\"&gt;Keeper Ra&lt;/a&gt; retrieved the remains of the Old God, and found the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;Heart of Y'Shaarj&lt;/a&gt; which they sealed within &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;a vault&lt;/a&gt;, guarded by the &lt;a href=\"titanic%20watcher\"&gt;titanic watcher&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Norushen\"&gt;Norushen&lt;/a&gt;.\nLong ago, as the titanic watcher Keeper &lt;a href=\"Freya\"&gt;Freya&lt;/a&gt; set out to populate the world with life, she placed one of the first seeds in Pandaria. From it grew &lt;a href=\"Fu%20Zan%20%28tree%29\"&gt;Fu Zan&lt;/a&gt;, the first, and all of Pandaria's forests descended from it. Before populating the rest of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, Freya fashioned a walking stick for her travels from one of Fu Zan's branches. Eventually Freya passed her staff to the Jade Serpent, &lt;a href=\"Yu%27lon\"&gt;Yu'lon&lt;/a&gt;, who later gave it to a uniquely clever &lt;a href=\"hozen\"&gt;hozen&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Monkey%20King\"&gt;Monkey King&lt;/a&gt;, as he was called, hung his most prized possessions from the staff, which he carries with him to this day.\nThe Thunder King's rise and the mogu empire.\nOver time, the mogu fell under the influence of the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Flesh\"&gt;Curse of Flesh&lt;/a&gt; and became obsessed with their mission of bringing peace and order, to the point where they came to believe that all other races must bow to their order. This led to the tumultuous &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20a%20Hundred%20Kings\"&gt;Age of a Hundred Kings&lt;/a&gt;. During this time, a warrior named &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen\"&gt;Lei Shen&lt;/a&gt; decided to take the future of Pandaria into his own hands. He traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Isle of Thunder&lt;/a&gt; and brutally defeated Ra, ripping out and eating his heart, gaining Ra's power over wind and storm. Crowned the Thunder King, none could stand against Lei Shen's mission to bring peace and order to Pandaria through tyranny. His construction of the &lt;a href=\"Serpent%27s%20Spine\"&gt;Serpent's Spine&lt;/a&gt; to separate the dreaded &lt;a href=\"mantid\"&gt;mantid&lt;/a&gt; from the rest of Pandaria's races is often cited as his greatest achievement. However, the mantid would adapt to this, swarming the Serpent's Spine every 100 years so that the weak would die and only the strong would return. Being a long-lived race, they would grow stronger with each generation. Lei Shen eventually died of old age, leaving weaker mogu emperors to rule in his stead.\nThe pandaren empire.\nThe races of Pandaria continued to struggle under the iron fist of the mogu. The pandaren slaves would eventually become inspired by the words and actions of &lt;a href=\"Kang\"&gt;Kang&lt;/a&gt;, The Fist of First Dawn. Rallying the &lt;a href=\"hozen\"&gt;hozen&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"jinyu\"&gt;jinyu&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"grummle\"&gt;grummle&lt;/a&gt;s and possibly &lt;a href=\"Human\"&gt;humans&lt;/a&gt; and defected &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari trolls&lt;/a&gt; to their side, the new pandaren &lt;a href=\"monk\"&gt;monk&lt;/a&gt;s led a &lt;a href=\"pandaren%20revolution\"&gt;revolution&lt;/a&gt;. The mogu were defeated and their empire crumbled. They counterattacked years later with their allies, the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt;, during the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Troll%20Wars\"&gt;Zandalari Troll Wars&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks to the newly formed &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Cloud%20Serpent\"&gt;Order of the Cloud Serpent&lt;/a&gt;, the Zandalari were repelled and the mogu clans were scattered, securing the future of the &lt;a href=\"pandaren%20empire\"&gt;pandaren empire&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe empire prospered until the time of &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Shaohao\"&gt;Emperor Shaohao&lt;/a&gt;, who later became known as the Last Emperor. Wishing to save his people from the forthcoming &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, he conquered his own vices by burying the six prime sha of &lt;a href=\"Sha%20of%20Doubt\"&gt;doubt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sha%20of%20Despair\"&gt;despair&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sha%20of%20Violence\"&gt;violence&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sha%20of%20Anger\"&gt;anger&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sha%20of%20Hatred\"&gt;hatred&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sha%20of%20Fear\"&gt;fear&lt;/a&gt; within the land. With the help of the &lt;a href=\"August%20Celestials\"&gt;August Celestials&lt;/a&gt;, he became one with the land and isolated it from the rest of the world to make it safe. However, what Shaohao did not realize was that this was actually the work of the &lt;a href=\"Sha%20of%20Pride\"&gt;Sha of Pride&lt;/a&gt; using Shaohao's power and arrogance to cloak the land in magic mists. Shaohao believed the pandaren were better than the rest of the world and that they could solve their own problems. While his actions saved Pandaria from the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, he doomed Pandaria to a future of stagnation.\nMists of Pandaria.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Mists%20of%20Pandaria%20%28lore%29\"&gt;mists&lt;/a&gt; parted because of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, when tensions between the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; were at their highest. In his lust for power, Warchief &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; led the Horde to Pandaria's shores to gain its spoils for himself, while High King &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; led the Alliance to protect it from Hellscream's mad quest for power. While the locals were initially wary of the outsiders whose presence allowed the sha to awaken in full force, they soon came to see the outisders as allies in the campaigns against the sha, mantid, and the newly revived &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20King\"&gt;Thunder King&lt;/a&gt;. \nGarrosh Hellscream continually attempted to abuse Pandaria's gifts for his own personal power, including the &lt;a href=\"%3ADivine%20Bell\"&gt;:Divine Bell&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;Heart of Y'Shaarj&lt;/a&gt;. Following his desecration of the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt;, he and his \"&lt;a href=\"True%20Horde\"&gt;True Horde&lt;/a&gt;\" were defeated during the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, temporarily putting an end to the devastating &lt;a href=\"Alliance-Horde%20war\"&gt;Alliance-Horde war&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe spirit of Emperor Shaohao then planted a magical tree in the center of the Vale, providing hope that the damage done to Pandaria will eventually heal. The August Celestials claimed that they will work with the mortals to heal the land. By the time of the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s invasion of Azeroth, the Vale has been cleansed.\nLegion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion\"&gt;Burning Legion's third invasion of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, many temples across Pandaria fell under siege from the Legion in what seemed targeted attacks. The &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Broken%20Temple\"&gt;Broken Temple&lt;/a&gt; sent aid where they could to help repel the invasion.\nWebsite's history.\nTaken from the section on the pandaren from the website for \"Mists of Pandaria\":\n\"Couched in myth and legend, rarely seen and even more rarely understood, the enigmatic &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; have long been a mystery to the other races of Azeroth. The noble history of the pandaren people stretches back thousands of years, well before the empires of man and before even &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;the sundering of the world&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n\"Denizens of a wondrous and fertile land, the pandaren once labored under the oppressive thumb of a monstrous race of ancient warlords known as the &lt;a href=\"Mogu\"&gt;Mogu&lt;/a&gt;. Through tenacity, diplomacy, and a unique form of unarmed combat, the pandaren staged a successful revolution that deposed the Mogu and established a &lt;a href=\"Pandaren%20Empire\"&gt;pandaren empire&lt;/a&gt; that would prosper for thousands of years.\"\n\"During the bleak days that preceded the sundering of the world, when demons flooded onto Azeroth and threw the entirety of the mortal realm into jeopardy, &lt;a href=\"Shao%20Hao\"&gt;the last emperor of the pandaren&lt;/a&gt; discovered a way to protect his land from the devastation. His deal with fate shrouded his land within an impenetrable mist for ten thousand years, but the nature of his transaction has left Pandaria haunted ever since...\"\n\"Shrouded in fog since the world was sundered more than ten thousand years ago, the ancient realm of Pandaria has remained unspoiled by war. Its lush forests and cloud-ringed mountains are home to a complex ecosystem of indigenous races and exotic creatures. It is the homeland of the enigmatic &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt;, a race that celebrates life to the fullest even while under siege by an ancient menace.\"\n\"The new continent reveals itself to a broken world just as the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; are spiraling ever closer to a war that will consume all of Azeroth. Will the mists of Pandaria part to reveal the world's salvation? Or will the battle to control this rich and breathtaking new land push the two mighty factions over the brink of war and into total annihilation?\"\nGetting to Pandaria.\nPlayers will get to Pandaria via new quests from &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;. The quests are short and sweet to make sure players can get into the new continent as fast as possible. Initially, adventurers venture beyond the mists via &lt;a href=\"gunship\"&gt;gunship&lt;/a&gt;s stationed in capital cities at level 85. There will be no conventional means of accessing Pandaria later such as &lt;a href=\"ship\"&gt;ship&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"zeppelin\"&gt;zeppelin&lt;/a&gt;s, and will be linked to the rest of the world by portals to the &lt;a href=\"Jade%20Forest\"&gt;Jade Forest&lt;/a&gt;.\nFor the Alliance, the portal to Pandaria is located at the &lt;a href=\"Tushui%20Pandaren\"&gt;Tushui Pandaren&lt;/a&gt; camp near the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Earthshrine\"&gt;Eastern Earthshrine&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;, and leads to &lt;a href=\"Paw%27don%20Village\"&gt;Paw'don Village&lt;/a&gt;. For the Horde, it is located at the &lt;a href=\"Huojin%20Pandaren\"&gt;Huojin Pandaren&lt;/a&gt; camp in the middle of the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Honor\"&gt;Valley of Honor&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, and leads to &lt;a href=\"Honeydew%20Village\"&gt;Honeydew Village&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorld of Warcraft: Mists of Pandaria.\nPandaria is the main setting of .\nSome of the zones are a bit larger than the zones introduced in &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, for example the Jade Forest is roughly half-again larger than &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Highlands\"&gt;Twilight Highlands&lt;/a&gt;. The regions vary in mood, for example some of the areas are lush and peaceful, while others are much darker and menacing in tone. The entire continent is influenced by various real life Eastern Asian cultures.\nIn the RPG.\nPandaria is a legendary place of bamboo forests and the mysterious &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"pandaren%20empire\"&gt;pandaren empire&lt;/a&gt;. The pandaren empire was founded before the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt; of the world, and is believed to be just as old as the kaldorei civilization. It shared and traded resources, goods, ideas and mystic knowledge with the haughty night elves of central Kalimdor in the years before the War of the Ancients. As the night elves' obsession with the forces of magic drove them to the brink of madness, the gentle pandaren severed ties, withdrew and closed their borders, and left the night elves behind forever. The pandaren clans, or shao'dins, traveled far across the seas and established crude but beautiful cities of stone and sturdy &lt;a href=\"bambus\"&gt;bambus&lt;/a&gt; reed on an island they named Pandaria. In time they built a new empire on the island. \nFor ten millennia, the world had forgotten pandaren. Shortly after the Third War, though, a few reappeared \u2014 perhaps roused from their isolation by the Burning Legion, whose catastrophic coming shook the world. A splinter group of pandaren arrived on Kalimdor in the aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; and has established a &lt;a href=\"Pandaren%20Settlement\"&gt;settlement&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, but the location remains as secret as that of their island homeland, even after the ability of adventurers to explore previously unknown areas since the Cataclysm.\nPandaria is apparently known for its gems (which are apparently magical).

Attackable by both Alliance and Horde players, champions provide a tougher challenge than most, and drop special loot. Defeating Pandarian champions is the objective of the achievements &lt;a href=\"A%20Worthy%20Opponent\"&gt;A Worthy Opponent&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Could%20We%20Find%20More%20Like%20That%3F\"&gt;Could We Find More Like That?&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Glorious%21\"&gt;Glorious!&lt;/a&gt;. There are 56 Pandarian champions in total.\nAlthough not &lt;a href=\"elite\"&gt;elite&lt;/a&gt;s, champions have far more health than normal mobs. They also have a number of special abilities, and defeating them requires players to use more strategy than is usually required with other mobs. Champions' special attacks are extremely powerful, and can often defeat adventurers with just a few blows. With their massive health pools, defeating a champion usually takes some time, if the player can survive that long.\nNotes.\nChampions' loot is fittingly exceptional. When defeated, each champion drops one of a number of pieces of &lt;a href=\"rare\"&gt;rare&lt;/a&gt; armor, as well as having a reasonable chance of dropping a &lt;a href=\"Small%20Bag%20of%20Goods\"&gt;Small Bag of Goods&lt;/a&gt; and/or a special item unique to that champion. These special items include &lt;a href=\"epic\"&gt;epic&lt;/a&gt; weapons and leg armor, as well as trinkets, bags of items, and a number of unique rare items and trinkets, offering on-use effects ranging from fun (&lt;a href=\"Panflute%20of%20Pandaria\"&gt;Panflute of Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pandaren%20Firework%20Launcher\"&gt;Pandaren Firework Launcher&lt;/a&gt;) to powerful (&lt;a href=\"Overgrown%20Lilypad\"&gt;Overgrown Lilypad&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dynasty%20of%20Steel\"&gt;Dynasty of Steel&lt;/a&gt;).\nThe champion's zone determines both its level and the type of special item it has a chance to drop. Each zone also has a selection of rare armor from which the standard loot for all champions in that zone is chosen, with each zone's champions offering armor for a different slot. \nOriginally, all champion drops were unique to champions, and could not be obtained from any other source. However, with &lt;a href=\"patch%205.2.0\"&gt;patch 5.2.0&lt;/a&gt;, certain mobs related to the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Isle of Thunder&lt;/a&gt; storyline were introduced, with a chance to drop &lt;a href=\"Big%20Bag%20of%20Zandalari%20Supplies\"&gt;Big Bag of Zandalari Supplies&lt;/a&gt;. These bags have a chance to drop the exact same items dropped from &lt;a href=\"Big%20Bag%20of%20Mysteries\"&gt;Big Bag of Mysteries&lt;/a&gt;, most notably including the epic weapon drops from the Jade Forest champions, and the epic leg armor drops from the Krasarang Wilds champions. While not unique to champions, &lt;a href=\"Small%20Bag%20of%20Zandalari%20Supplies\"&gt;Small Bag of Zandalari Supplies&lt;/a&gt; (available from the same mobs) also drops the exact same items as &lt;a href=\"Small%20Bag%20of%20Goods\"&gt;Small Bag of Goods&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Patch%205.4.0\"&gt;Patch 5.4.0&lt;/a&gt; will also allow several previously unique champion items to drop from mobs on the &lt;a href=\"Timeless%20Isle\"&gt;Timeless Isle&lt;/a&gt;, as part of the achievement &lt;a href=\"Going%20To%20Need%20A%20Bigger%20Bag\"&gt;Going To Need A Bigger Bag&lt;/a&gt;. Whether further expansions will make other champion drops available from other sources remains to be seen.\nThe level requirement of &lt;a href=\"epic\"&gt;epic&lt;/a&gt; gear drops matches that of the champion it dropped from - either 85 or 87 - while the level requirement for trinkets and items is either 1 or 85; all &lt;a href=\"rare\"&gt;rare&lt;/a&gt; gear drops from champions require level 85. Most champion drops are &lt;a href=\"bind%20on%20pickup\"&gt;bind on pickup&lt;/a&gt;, except for a few epic items which are &lt;a href=\"bind%20on%20equip\"&gt;bind on equip&lt;/a&gt;. There are a few exceptions: the &lt;a href=\"Elixir%20of%20Ancient%20Knowledge\"&gt;Elixir of Ancient Knowledge&lt;/a&gt;, which is &lt;a href=\"bind%20to%20account\"&gt;bind to account&lt;/a&gt;; the &lt;a href=\"Hozen%20Peace%20Pipe\"&gt;Hozen Peace Pipe&lt;/a&gt;, which can be traded freely but has a level 90 requirement; and &lt;a href=\"Lon%20the%20Bull\"&gt;Lon the Bull&lt;/a&gt;, who is a level lower than the other champions in his zone. &lt;a href=\"Ook-Breaker%20Mace\"&gt;Ook-Breaker Mace&lt;/a&gt; is also exceptional in that it is the special item dropped by both &lt;a href=\"Mister%20Ferocious\"&gt;Mister Ferocious&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ferdinand\"&gt;Ferdinand&lt;/a&gt; - the only one to be shared between two champions.\nEvery major race on Pandaria has its champions: the &lt;a href=\"hozen\"&gt;hozen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"jinyu\"&gt;jinyu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mantid\"&gt;mantid&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"saurok\"&gt;saurok&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"yaungol\"&gt;yaungol&lt;/a&gt; are all represented among them. Champions' health and levels vary, but their capabilities are determined by their race, with all champions of that race sharing the same set of abilities. The exception is the mogu, who have two types: warriors and sorcerers. Each zone has 8 champions - one of each type - meaning there are 7 examples of each type of champion.\nChampions vary in level between 85 and 91, with health pools as large as 4 million hit points. Some are neutral to players - until attacked - while most are hostile and will attack if players stray too close. Pandarian champions are immune to a number of &lt;a href=\"crowd%20control\"&gt;crowd control&lt;/a&gt; effects, including &lt;a href=\"fear%20effect\"&gt;fear effect&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"horror%20effect\"&gt;horror effect&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Cyclone\"&gt;Cyclone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mind%20Control\"&gt;Mind Control&lt;/a&gt;. However, they can be &lt;a href=\"stun\"&gt;stunned&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"interrupt%20effect\"&gt;interrupted&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"disorient\"&gt;disorient&lt;/a&gt;ed, &lt;a href=\"silence%20effect\"&gt;silenced&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"root\"&gt;root&lt;/a&gt;ed, &lt;a href=\"snare\"&gt;snare&lt;/a&gt;d and &lt;a href=\"knock%20back\"&gt;knocked back&lt;/a&gt;.\nFor a list of loot offered by each champion, or for information on each type of champion's abilities and behavior, see the individual champion pages.\nTips.\nThe difficulty of overcoming champions varies depending on the type and level of both the champion and the player. Some types of champion are far harder for certain classes to defeat, and many require the use of interrupts and evasive manoeuvres throughout the fight. Learn the abilities and behaviour of each type, and how best to use your abilities against them."}

It is rumored that &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;ish marauders have been raiding coastal towns in the area, but whether these attacks are part of a greater Horde offensive is, as yet, unknown. Your outpost is to provide food and information for &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; troops and, as such, should be a community consisting of at least four &lt;a href=\"Farm\"&gt;Farms&lt;/a&gt;. You must also construct a &lt;a href=\"Barracks\"&gt;Barracks&lt;/a&gt; in order to safeguard the Hillsbrad operation.\"\nBackground.\nThe regional commander's forces had converted a large stone mansion into a &lt;a href=\"town%20hall\"&gt;town hall&lt;/a&gt;; the owner had graciously provided his servants and his farm to assist them as well. Their first task was to plow more farmland for the arrival of more troops, while at the same time training more servants in the ways of construction and mining. An old &lt;a href=\"gold%20mine\"&gt;gold mine&lt;/a&gt;, nearby to the north, was reopened after the second farm was completed, and all available workers helped gather the necessary materials for building. The forest was strangely quiet that day. Their units of footmen stayed close to the hall.\nAs soon as the workers had extracted all they could from the mine, they immediately began construction of a barracks. They received word of coming reinforcements, so all the local &lt;a href=\"peasant\"&gt;peasant&lt;/a&gt;s helped build from the outside at the same time the interior was being completed in an effort to finish before their arrival. With that task completed all that remained was to cut enough &lt;a href=\"lumber\"&gt;lumber&lt;/a&gt; for two more farms. The workers were staying near the edge of the tree line; their troops continued to closely guard their efforts. The day of completion of the farms heralded the arrival of reinforcements, who brought grim news of battles to the south and the presence of several bands of orcs nearby. With their task completed and preparations for war begun, they decided to remain where they were and enjoy the quiet until they received new orders.\nVideo.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

Zul'jin's &lt;a href=\"axethrower\"&gt;axethrower&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Destroyer%23Troll%20destroyer\"&gt;destroyers&lt;/a&gt; were eager for revenge on the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s who imprisoned them and assisted in preparation for the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;assault on Hillsbrad&lt;/a&gt;.\nMeanwhile, &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"scout\"&gt;scout&lt;/a&gt;s had discovered an orcish secret base in the &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Dare\"&gt;Zul'Dare&lt;/a&gt; region of the &lt;a href=\"Channel%20Islands\"&gt;Channel Islands&lt;/a&gt;, south-east of Hillsbrad. Admiral &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Daelin Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; ordered for transports to land troops against the outpost. At the same time, Doomhammer ordered the assault on Hillsbrad, which was destroyed in a gruesome display in order to make an example. Hillsbrad was decimated, and the news spread throughout the human kingdoms.\nThe Alliance had succeeded in pushing the Horde out of southern Lordaeron and destroying the Horde base at Zul'Dare, but at the cost of both the townships of Hillsbrad and Southshore which were left in ruins. Hillsbrad and Southshore were both later rebuilt after the war.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nHillsbrad and Southshore were the only regions of former &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; that were not left completely devastated by the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; or joined the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt;. As such, guards from both communities were still wearing the tabard of their kingdom.\n&lt;a href=\"Magistrate%20Burnside\"&gt;Magistrate Burnside&lt;/a&gt; led the town of Hillsbrad from the local &lt;a href=\"town%20hall\"&gt;town hall&lt;/a&gt;, aided by the Council of Hillsbrad, as well as &lt;a href=\"Clerk%20Horrace%20Whitesteed\"&gt;Clerk Horrace Whitesteed&lt;/a&gt;. The Hillsbrad Fields laid in the western part of the Hillsbrad Foothills, east of &lt;a href=\"Darrow%20Hill\"&gt;Darrow Hill&lt;/a&gt;, north of &lt;a href=\"Azurelode%20Mine\"&gt;Azurelode Mine&lt;/a&gt;, and south of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Farm\"&gt;farms&lt;/a&gt;' economy appeared to be based around apple production, however the southernmost orchard produced something else. There were also pumpkins and cows to be found scattered around the fields. Azurelode Mine was also still being exploited by the people of the town.\nThe people of Hillsbrad were constantly threatened by the forces of &lt;a href=\"High%20Executor%20Darthalia\"&gt;High Executor Darthalia&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Tarren%20Mill\"&gt;Tarren Mill&lt;/a&gt;, being repeatedly attacked in the questline &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Hillsbrad%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Battle of Hillsbrad (quest)&lt;/a&gt; by the forces of the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;. Peasants, farmers, and other members of the human supply line and infrastructure were especially threatened. Many of the farmers were very capable of fighting back, and staged ambushes on the undead forces, according to the quest &lt;a href=\"Dangerous%21%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Dangerous! (quest)&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Blacksmith%20Verringtan\"&gt;Blacksmith Verringtan&lt;/a&gt; and his apprentices supplied weapons to the local militia.\nCataclysm.\nThe Hillsbrad Fields were seized by the Forsaken, complete with searchlight towers and plague tanks, and are now called the &lt;a href=\"Sludge%20Fields\"&gt;Sludge Fields&lt;/a&gt;. Before the town was taken, some of the former human residents of Hillsbrad fled to escape the fighting. Some attempted to venture east to the &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands\"&gt;Arathi Highlands&lt;/a&gt; but they never made it, slaughtered before they reached &lt;a href=\"Thoradin%27s%20Wall\"&gt;Thoradin's Wall&lt;/a&gt;. Some others traveled west into &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt;, to take refuge on &lt;a href=\"Fenris%20Isle\"&gt;Fenris Isle&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Magistrate%20Burnside\"&gt;Magistrate Burnside&lt;/a&gt; and a few dozen Hillsbrad residents stayed behind to defend the town but were ultimately defeated, imprisoned, and experimented on.\nServices.\nThree &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Apprentice%20Blacksmith\"&gt;Apprentice Blacksmiths&lt;/a&gt; sold assorted weaponry. They were directed by a man named &lt;a href=\"Blacksmith%20Verringtan\"&gt;Verringtan&lt;/a&gt;. Two &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Tailor\"&gt;Tailors&lt;/a&gt;, vending assorted clothing, inhabited a small house on the far side of the southernmost orchard.\nPvP Significance.\nIn the spirit of Hillsbrad Foothill's infamous PvP battles, Horde players needed be careful while completing the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Hillsbrad%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Battle of Hillsbrad (quest)&lt;/a&gt; quest. It was a known spot for high level Alliance &lt;a href=\"gank\"&gt;gank&lt;/a&gt;ing.\nIn the RPG.\nHillsbrad is a large farming community that is governed by &lt;a href=\"Magistrate%20Burnside\"&gt;Magistrate Burnside&lt;/a&gt;. This community wants to peacefully coexist with its neighbors, though it views the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; settlement at &lt;a href=\"Tarren%20Mill\"&gt;Tarren Mill&lt;/a&gt; as a constant threat. Hillsbrad was always a rival to the farm towns where &lt;a href=\"Aretain%20Naris\"&gt;Aretain Naris&lt;/a&gt; grew up, and that rivalry has turned into enmity. Aretain's open contempt for Hillsbrad is reciprocated. Some worry that Aretain may attempt to force out Magistrate Burnside, take control of the town, and establish it as his base.\nA mysterious sickness afflicts the people of Hillsbrad. The malady involves weakness and bouts of temporary blindness, and affects both humans and livestock. Burnside suspects the Horde is responsible, and offers a reward to anyone who discovers the source of the plague.\nSpeculation.\nThe farms: a family holding?\nMany of the Hillsbrad farmers, footmen and councilors were redheads. This gave rise to the possibility that the Hillsbrad Fields were privately owned and operated perhaps by a large farming family. It could also have been that the Hillsbrad humans had a dominant redhead gene, considering most if not all of the &lt;a href=\"Southshore%20Guard\"&gt;Southshore Guard&lt;/a&gt;s were auburns.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Hillsbrad%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Battle of Hillsbrad (quest)&lt;/a&gt;, the landowners were &lt;a href=\"Farmer%20Ray\"&gt;Farmer Ray&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Farmer%20Getz\"&gt;Farmer Getz&lt;/a&gt;. Whether these two farmers were related (brothers, father/son...) is undetermined.\nA sharp eye could notice that the Magistrate and his clerk were not redheads or auburns like the rest of the Fields. So if the farms were owned by a family, it was likely that they were subject to some degree of outside authority."}

As a result of their expansion, the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Southshore\"&gt;Southshore&lt;/a&gt; were driven off to &lt;a href=\"Fenris%20Keep\"&gt;Fenris Keep&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Silverpine\"&gt;Silverpine&lt;/a&gt; and the town itself was devastated by the &lt;a href=\"New%20Plague\"&gt;New Plague&lt;/a&gt;.\nDue to the plaguing of &lt;a href=\"Southshore\"&gt;Southshore&lt;/a&gt;, the conversion of the farms into the Sludge Fields and the destruction of &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Garok\"&gt;Dun Garok&lt;/a&gt;, the Alliance lost all their major holdings in Hillsbrad following the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;.

Despite this, by the time of the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the Stormpikes still maintain presence.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the region was again at the center of conflict between the Horde and the Alliance, which managed to regain control of the ruins of Southshore, beginning its reconstruction after the armistice.\nThe land also consists of Alterac Mountains and its surroundings, such as &lt;a href=\"Dalaran%20Crater\"&gt;Dalaran Crater&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Strahnbrad\"&gt;Strahnbrad&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nHillsbrad is traditionally the most blood-soaked battlefield on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, despite its pleasant, pastoral setting. The southwestern corner of the area, such as &lt;a href=\"Azurelode%20Mine\"&gt;Azurelode Mine&lt;/a&gt;, used to be part of &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; before the &lt;a href=\"Greymane%20Wall\"&gt;Greymane Wall&lt;/a&gt; was built. Central Hillsbrad was part of the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Kingdom of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; from at least the 19 &lt;a href=\"BDP\"&gt;BDP&lt;/a&gt;. The northern part of this region consists of the chilly Alterac Mountains, where the ruins of the city of Alterac have been claimed by a tribe of &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s and the majestic city of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; was once annihilated by the &lt;a href=\"demon%20lord\"&gt;demon lord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;.\nSecond War.\nAfter they lost the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, the people of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; arrived in a &lt;a href=\"Refugee%23Exodus%20of%20Stormwind\"&gt;grand exodus&lt;/a&gt; across the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt; to the shores of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. These landless refugees then settled near the region of &lt;a href=\"Southshore\"&gt;Southshore&lt;/a&gt;, pledging their loyalty to the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and stationing their troops in the whole region for the coming invasion of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the outset of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;ish marauders started raiding coastal towns in the area. The newly-formed &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; established outposts to prepare themselves for the conflict. During the war itself, the region saw several important skirmishes between &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;forest troll&lt;/a&gt;s on one side, and &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; on the other. The towns of &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Fields\"&gt;Hillsbrad&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Southshore\"&gt;Southshore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tarren%20Mill\"&gt;Tarren Mill&lt;/a&gt; all got attacked by the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Durnholde%20Keep\"&gt;Durnholde Keep&lt;/a&gt; was raided by &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; himself in order free &lt;a href=\"Zul%27jin\"&gt;Zul'jin&lt;/a&gt; and his war party from imprisonment.\nThird War.\nOn the onset of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; gave the order to assemble the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;ish clans in order for the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;new Horde&lt;/a&gt; to leave the continent and travel to &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. They skirmished with Alliance forces and freed &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grommash Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20clan\"&gt;Warsong clan&lt;/a&gt;, later secretly infiltrating &lt;a href=\"Southshore\"&gt;Southshore&lt;/a&gt; during the night to steal its ships so they could sail to &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;.\nSunwell Trilogy.\nTwo years following the Third War, &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; came to the area to look for &lt;a href=\"Anveena%20Teague\"&gt;Anveena Teague&lt;/a&gt;. In turn, &lt;a href=\"Harkyn%20Grymstone\"&gt;Harkyn Grymstone&lt;/a&gt; and his team were tricked by &lt;a href=\"Dar%27Khan%20Drathir\"&gt;Dar'Khan Drathir&lt;/a&gt; to hunt Kalecgos. Kalec, &lt;a href=\"Tyrygosa\"&gt;Tyrygosa&lt;/a&gt;, and Anveena came to &lt;a href=\"Tarren%20Mill\"&gt;Tarren Mill&lt;/a&gt; which was still inhabited by humans and assisted in defense against a &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; attack led by Dar'Khan.\nAt some point after that, the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; claimed Tarren Mill as their southernmost holding at that time.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nThe Forsaken, aided by the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, battled fiercely with the humans of &lt;a href=\"Southshore\"&gt;Southshore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Fields\"&gt;Hillsbrad Fields&lt;/a&gt; that joined the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Syndicate\"&gt;Syndicate&lt;/a&gt; also had a presence here, taking over &lt;a href=\"Durnholde%20Keep\"&gt;Durnholde Keep&lt;/a&gt;.

Its members were accused of murder, but it turned out that Terrence's son, &lt;a href=\"Cedrick%20Fallrook\"&gt;Cedrick Fallrook&lt;/a&gt; killed his brother &lt;a href=\"Erik%20Fallrook\"&gt;Erik Fallrook&lt;/a&gt;.

Now the expansive Forsaken seek to maintain their holdings in order to conquer the rest of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; for the Horde.\nThe Dalaran mages fought against the Forsaken while they rebuilt their city, only to move the city to Northrend to combat the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;. What little &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; activity is left in the region is centered around &lt;a href=\"Dalaran%20Crater\"&gt;Dalaran Crater&lt;/a&gt; and the \"four fingers\" of Alterac, where the &lt;a href=\"Stormpike\"&gt;Stormpike&lt;/a&gt; with the aid of their new &lt;a href=\"Bloodfang%20pack\"&gt;Bloodfang&lt;/a&gt; allies seek to drive out the Forsaken. However, the Horde sabotaged the fingers.\nA large group of undead unleashed by &lt;a href=\"Warden%20Stillwater\"&gt;Warden Stillwater&lt;/a&gt; terrorizes &lt;a href=\"Brazie%20Farmstead\"&gt;Brazie Farmstead&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; targeted the Hillsbrad Foothills as one of their &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Invasions\"&gt;invasion points&lt;/a&gt;. It was successfully defended by the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt;. Later, the &lt;a href=\"Ravenholdt%20Manor\"&gt;Ravenholdt Manor&lt;/a&gt; was attacked by &lt;a href=\"Valitos\"&gt;Valitos&lt;/a&gt;. He was encountered by the agents of the &lt;a href=\"Uncrowned\"&gt;Uncrowned&lt;/a&gt;.\nExploring Azeroth.\nSeveral years after Southshore's destruction, the town has successfully been reclaimed by Alliance forces and was undergoing the process of cleaning up and rebuilding. According to &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt;, the Hillsbrad Foothills was rife with the Scourge, worgen, and ghosts.\nGeography.\nThough the rest of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; was ravaged by the Scourge and twisted into a haunted perversion of its former self, the Hillsbrad Foothills largely managed to escape this fate. It remains the best-preserved region of the fallen kingdom, giving travelers a feeling of what the land was like before the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;Plague&lt;/a&gt;. Yet the destructive efforts of the Forsaken threaten this land with devastation. Pine trees dot the ample farmland, and the rolling pastures are frequently crisscrossed with roads leading to the gloomy Forsaken settlements. A river flowing from &lt;a href=\"Darrowmere%20Lake\"&gt;Darrowmere Lake&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Western Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt; runs north to south. There are a few small, empty islands off the southern coast, and one larger one, &lt;a href=\"Purgation%20Isle\"&gt;Purgation Isle&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Valley\"&gt;Alterac Valley&lt;/a&gt; battleground can be found in the zone.\nDig sites.\nHillsbrad Foothills has two &lt;a href=\"dig%20site\"&gt;dig site&lt;/a&gt;s:\nIn the RPG.\nThe Hillsbrad Foothills are buffered from the &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands\"&gt;Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, and so, Hillsbrad is free from &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; influence and is one of the last stable &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; realms in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. This region offers safety and sustenance to a people long beset by misery. Yet Hillsbrad is not completely idyllic. The &lt;a href=\"Syndicate\"&gt;Syndicate&lt;/a&gt; has inveigled its way into the region, and &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; roam its wilderness. Its hills are green and pastoral, its meadows fertile and its soil rich. &lt;a href=\"Halmish\"&gt;Halmish&lt;/a&gt; lives here in a small cabin warning people about &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; suspected that the &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Linnena%20Hallow\"&gt;Linnena Hallow&lt;/a&gt; was near Hillsbrad Foothills.\nHistory.\nHillsbrad's people fought in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;s, though few Hillsbraders traveled to &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, thinking it dubious that the mysterious continent could hold anything better than their own land. They might be in for a sorry surprise when &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; strikes south. Nevertheless, Hillsbraders have earned their peace and they know it. Recently, Forsaken took over &lt;a href=\"Tarren%20Mill\"&gt;Tarrin's Mill&lt;/a&gt;, and the Syndicate, &lt;a href=\"Torn%20Fin\"&gt;Torn Fin&lt;/a&gt; murlocs, and rogue &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s from Alterac moved into the area. The Hillsbraders just want peace, but they are unlikely to get it any time soon. They hate the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; for what it has done to Lordaeron, and they are capable warriors with a strong militia.\nThe Syndicate sent a messenger to &lt;a href=\"Southshore\"&gt;Southshore&lt;/a&gt;, claiming that they have researched a new spell that is extremely effective against murlocs. They offered to parley with a Southshore representative, trading this new magic for some concessions. &lt;a href=\"Magistrate%20Henry%20Maleb\"&gt;Magistrate Maleb&lt;/a&gt; did not trust the Syndicate, but the murlocs have been preying on incoming ships and damaging Southshore's economy. He asked some trustworthy heroes to accompany his agent to the meeting with them. The Syndicate did indeed possess such a spell and were willing to part with it for the right price. Unfortunately, the Forsaken of Tarrin's Mill ambushed the Syndicate messenger on his way home and tortured the information out of him. &lt;a href=\"High%20Executor%20Darthalia\"&gt;High Executor Darthalia&lt;/a&gt; sent agents to the rendezvous point to slay both sides and steal the spell for herself, intending to use it to leverage the murlocs into obeying her commands.\nPeople and culture.\nHillsbrad's people are industrious and proud. They work hard to keep their realm in its current, peaceful state, reporting undead and other dangers immediately. They do not tolerate crime of any sort and punishments are brutal. The locals dress in white, &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;'s traditional color. Each year they celebrate &lt;a href=\"Hordefall\"&gt;Hordefall&lt;/a&gt;, the anniversary of the Second War's end.\nGeography.\nThe Hillsbrad Foothills are located south of the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac Mountains&lt;/a&gt; and northwest of the &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands\"&gt;Arathi Highlands&lt;/a&gt;. It borders the sea to the south. The area is largely peaceful, with numerous thriving farms and one or two large settlements. They offer a land of rolling green hills and fertile meadows. Rich rainfall creates many arable tracts, and this natural bounty aids Hillsbrad's self-sufficiency. The southern shore is windy but gentle, allowing ships to dock easily at Southshore's harbors. Torn Fin murlocs frequent the shores as well. &lt;a href=\"Mountain%20lion\"&gt;Mountain lion&lt;/a&gt;s, creeper &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt;s and gray &lt;a href=\"bear\"&gt;bear&lt;/a&gt;s roam Hillsbrad's pastoral landscape.\nSpeculation.\nThe eastern-most areas of the Hillsbrad Foothills (including &lt;a href=\"Durnholde%20Keep\"&gt;Durnholde Keep&lt;/a&gt;) may be considered part of the &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands\"&gt;Arathi Highlands&lt;/a&gt;, as \"\" indicates that &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;'s camp in a forested area west of Durnholde and east of a river (presumably the one east of &lt;a href=\"Southshore\"&gt;Southshore&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\") is within Arathi. The Highlands may, as a region, run up to this river, although due to Durnholde's inclusion &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;'s domain likely still runs up to &lt;a href=\"Thoradin%27s%20Wall\"&gt;Thoradin's Wall&lt;/a&gt;."}

{"id": "14022", "revid": "50021265", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=14022", "title": "Hillsbrad Foothills (Classic)", "text": "The Hillsbrad Foothills (sometimes referred to as simply Hillsbrad) is a mid-level zone most suitable for players around level 25. Located in the Southern end of the North Island of (&lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;), the hills are home to the towns of &lt;a href=\"Southshore\"&gt;Southshore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Fields\"&gt;Hillsbrad Fields&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;), and &lt;a href=\"Tarren%20Mill\"&gt;Tarren Mill&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;). Some notable locations, such as &lt;a href=\"Durnholde%20Keep\"&gt;Durnholde Keep&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Azurelode%20Mine\"&gt;Azurelode Mine&lt;/a&gt; can also be found here. Since this area lies outside of Thoradin's Wall, it is considered as a crossroads between Alliance and Horde players, which makes combat between the two factions likely.\nHillsbrad is relatively safe and stable. Its hills are green and pastoral, its meadows fertile and its soil rich. Humans loyal to the Alliance control Hillsbrad from the town of Southshore, though the Syndicate, murlocs and Forsaken threaten their serenity.\nThe current Hillsbrad Foothills is made up of the former Hillsbrad Foothills region, &lt;a href=\"Southshore\"&gt;Southshore&lt;/a&gt; region, and the &lt;a href=\"Tarren%20Mill\"&gt;Tarren Mill&lt;/a&gt; region. It is also one of the sub-regions of the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Valley%20region\"&gt;Alterac Valley region&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nHillsbrad is traditionally the most blood-soaked battlefield on Azeroth, despite its pleasant, pastoral setting. The &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Battle of Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt; was the first battle between the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; and the area saw several important skirmishes between &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;forest troll&lt;/a&gt;s on one side, and &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; on the other. In the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; wiped out the human town of &lt;a href=\"Tarren%20Mill\"&gt;Tarren Mill&lt;/a&gt;, though later it was claimed as the southernmost holding of the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;. Since then, the undead have been battling fiercely with the humans of &lt;a href=\"Southshore\"&gt;Southshore&lt;/a&gt;, and the region is infamous for having at one point been impossible to even enter without being slowed down by the constant battle and bloodshed.\nGeography.\nThough the rest of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; was ravaged by the Scourge and twisted into a haunted perversion of its former self, the Hillsbrad Foothills largely managed to escape this fate. It remains the best preserved region of the fallen kingdom, giving travelers a feeling for what the land was like before the Plague. It is Human country, soft and green. Pine trees dot the ample farmland, and the rolling pastures are frequently crisscrossed with roads leading to the numerous towns and villages that still remain. A river flowing from &lt;a href=\"Darrowmere%20Lake\"&gt;Darrowmere Lake&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Plaguelands%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Western Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt; runs north to south. There are a few small, empty islands off the southern coast, and one larger one, &lt;a href=\"Purgation%20Isle\"&gt;Purgation Isle&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere are no instanced dungeons or battlegrounds in the foothills, though the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Valley\"&gt;Alterac Valley&lt;/a&gt; battleground can be found in the nearby &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Alterac Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, the micro dungeon &lt;a href=\"Purgation%20Isle\"&gt;Purgation Isle&lt;/a&gt; can be found here.\nNotable characters.\nThe Hillsbrad Foothills are home to several characters of note. At Southshore, &lt;a href=\"Magistrate%20Henry%20Maleb\"&gt;Magistrate Henry Maleb&lt;/a&gt; seeks aid in the battle against the Syndicate, and &lt;a href=\"Marshal%20Redpath\"&gt;Marshal Redpath&lt;/a&gt; sends promising adventurers into the Alterac Mountains to slay the vicious ogres that have their holdings there. In Tarren Mill, &lt;a href=\"Apothecary%20Lydon\"&gt;Apothecary Lydon&lt;/a&gt; attempts to concoct the perfect new plague, and &lt;a href=\"High%20Executor%20Darthalia\"&gt;High Executor Darthalia&lt;/a&gt; orders agents of the Horde into human lands to show them what's what.\nPvP.\n\"If there is one great truth about Hillsbrad, it's that this region is destined to live under the shadow of war.\" ~Huraan, Southshore NPC\nOn PvP servers, and less commonly, non-PvP servers, Hillsbrad is Ground Zero. It's arguably the single most actively contested region within the game, with the area immediately surrounding Tarren Mill often being a major battlefield. This is due to a meeting point between the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; players reaching level 20 - 25 (coming from &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt;) and level 30 &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20Dwarf\"&gt;Ironforge Dwarf&lt;/a&gt; players (coming from &lt;a href=\"Wetlands%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Wetlands&lt;/a&gt; through &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Arathi Highlands&lt;/a&gt;). This zone should therefore probably be avoided for solo questing (or by levels below 20), especially considering that some max level players of the opposing faction who visit customarily have no qualms about killing characters much lower in level than themselves. Although quests are available here, the area tends to be frequented by individuals whose primary interest is PvP combat (on PvP servers).\nHaving been previously known as \"Gankbrad\",\"Pwnshore\", and \"Killsbrad Foothills\" among others, Hillsbrad was \"the\" place for PvP action before the battlegrounds were introduced. It is now once again a peaceful place. However, sometimes Alliance or Horde will venture to the opposing faction's outpost in parties or raids to wreak havoc, especially when the battlegrounds are down."}

The Wildhammers have always been staunch allies of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. It is from the Hinterlands that these dwarves find and tame their world-renowned &lt;a href=\"gryphon\"&gt;gryphon&lt;/a&gt;s. The &lt;a href=\"Razorbeak%20Gryphon\"&gt;Razorbeak gryphon&lt;/a&gt;s roam wild in this region. \nAlso in the Hinterlands is one of the last remaining settlements of the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; in Lordaeron at the &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Danil%20Lodge\"&gt;Quel'Danil Lodge&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe Hinterlands are also home to a large population of &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;forest troll&lt;/a&gt;s, which are divided into three separate tribes. The &lt;a href=\"Revantusk%20tribe\"&gt;Revantusk tribe&lt;/a&gt; is the only one that has declared sides in the Horde-Alliance conflict and support the &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Vilebranch\"&gt;Vilebranch&lt;/a&gt; tribe holds residence in the massive troll city of &lt;a href=\"Jintha%27Alor\"&gt;Jintha'Alor&lt;/a&gt; as well as the &lt;a href=\"Altar%20of%20Zul\"&gt;Altar of Zul&lt;/a&gt; while the &lt;a href=\"Witherbark%20tribe\"&gt;Witherbark tribe&lt;/a&gt; holds the smallest influence, hailing from the temples of &lt;a href=\"Shadra%27Alor\"&gt;Shadra'Alor&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the northern part of the region is the ancient, massive tree, &lt;a href=\"Seradane\"&gt;Seradane&lt;/a&gt; where the agents of the &lt;a href=\"Green%20dragonflight\"&gt;Green dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; have been corrupted. A massive portal on the side of the tree connects the servants of the &lt;a href=\"Aspect\"&gt;Aspect&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt; to her own realm, the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nThe earliest inhabitants of the Hinterlands were the &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;forest troll&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20Empire\"&gt;Amani Empire&lt;/a&gt;. This ancient empire stretched across much of eastern &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; with the Hinterlands at its heart. Many great troll cities were built in this region, and their colossal ruins still testify to the once-great empire. The great empire felt the beginnings of its doom when the exiled &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; arrived at Lordaeron. The trolls, though cunning and great in number, were no match for the arcane fires of the elven mages. The elven armies pushed the trolls out of the northern reaches of their empire and built their own cities in their newly acquired region: &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe trolls were forced to retreat to their bastions in the Hinterlands to the south, where they would remain, wary of the elves and their magic, for several generations.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Arathor\"&gt;Arathor&lt;/a&gt; began organizing themselves into a true political entity, the trolls decided to prevent them from gaining a foothold in the political geography of the region. The Amani trolls massed their power in one last bid against their adversaries, but it was for naught. The high elves, seeing a way to be rid of the &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; menace once and for all, taught the humans the secrets of the arcane arts. The trolls were no match for the combined armies and mages of the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s and high elves and they were utterly defeated. This defeat marked the last time the Amani forest trolls would join together as a single nation. Scattered and defeated, the remnants of the Amani returned to their homes in the Hinterlands. Because of their terrible loss, their well-established civilization was virtually gone, and their great monuments and temples began to crumble with no one to keep them up.\nWildhammer arrival.\nThe next time the Hinterlands would play a significant role in history was the coming of the &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammer clan&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt;. After the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;War of the Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt;, the Wildhammer dwarves forsook their subterranean homes of &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt; and traveled north to the Hinterlands where they built dwellings above the ground at the city of &lt;a href=\"Aerie%20Peak\"&gt;Aerie Peak&lt;/a&gt;. They adopted a society that focused less on metalworking and mining, and more on a closeness with nature. They were and remain unique among dwarves (and indeed, all races traditionally of the Alliance) in their cultivation of shamanistic practices. The dwarves also soon realized they had a strong affinity for the wild &lt;a href=\"gryphon\"&gt;gryphon&lt;/a&gt;s of the Hinterlands. Soon they trained &lt;a href=\"gryphon%20rider\"&gt;gryphon rider&lt;/a&gt;s who would fly into battle wielding the powers of the storm. So strong was the bond between the dwarves and the gryphons that the dwarves constructed an enormous monument in the likeness of a gryphon at Aerie Peak. Eventually, these gryphon riders would become perhaps their most valuable gift to the Alliance. Upon their arrival, the dwarves found themselves immediately at odds with the trolls of the Hinterlands. The trolls view the Wildhammers as squatters on their ancestral lands and spare no opportunity to accost the dwarves by attacking the gryphon aeries.\nBy the time of the Wildhammer clan's arrival in the Hinterlands, the trolls had recovered some of their numbers after the devastating war. These remnants split themselves into three separate tribes. The &lt;a href=\"Vilebranch%20tribe\"&gt;Vilebranch tribe&lt;/a&gt; was the strongest and held the ancient Amani bastions of &lt;a href=\"Jintha%27Alor\"&gt;Jintha'Alor&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Altar%20of%20Zul\"&gt;Altar of Zul&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Witherbark%20tribe\"&gt;Witherbark tribe&lt;/a&gt; was weaker than the Vilebranch, residing amongst the old temples of &lt;a href=\"Shadra%27Alor\"&gt;Shadra'Alor&lt;/a&gt; and the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Hiri%27Watha\"&gt;Hiri'Watha&lt;/a&gt;. The weakest of the three tribes was the &lt;a href=\"Revantusk%20tribe\"&gt;Revantusk tribe&lt;/a&gt;. The Revantusk trolls were nomadic and called no place their home. For many hundreds of years, this was the state of affairs for the trolls.\nSecond War.\nLocated to the southeast of the &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt;, the Hinterlands are home to the Wildhammer clan, renowned for their use of gryphons. Led at that time by &lt;a href=\"Kurdran%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Kurdran Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt;, the Wildhammer clan came under attack by what ultimately proved to be a diversionary tactic by &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt;. The Warchief deduced that if he sent a force to attack the Hinterlands, the Alliance would respond, allowing him to take the remainder of his forces into &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; with the aid of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27jin\"&gt;Zul'jin&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani tribe&lt;/a&gt;. Realizing their plans, &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt; dispatched &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;, along with half the Alliance forces, to travel north to Quel'Thalas and come to the aid of the elves, while he aided Kurdran in clearing out the remaining Horde forces in the Hinterlands. Kurdran pledged his and his kingdom's aid to Anduin Lothar after the human Alliance aided them in forcing the invading orcs and forest trolls out of their homeland.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, Kurdran Wildhammer went to &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; as part of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Expedition\"&gt;Alliance Expedition&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Falstad%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Falstad Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt; stayed in Aerie Peak to succeed him as the High Thane and rule the Wildhammer clan. Kurdran and his gryphon riders participated in the &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Invasion of Draenor&lt;/a&gt; and was one of the heroes willing to sacrifice their lives to safeguard Azeroth. Kurdran Wildhammer would later have a statue in his likeness built in the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Heroes\"&gt;Valley of Heroes&lt;/a&gt; to honor him for his heroic deeds.\nDuring the war, the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt; had a base at &lt;a href=\"Skulk%20Rock\"&gt;Skulk Rock&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Torntusk\"&gt;Elder Torntusk&lt;/a&gt; was there among the forest trolls when they were driven out by the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and Wildhammers all the way back to the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac Mountains&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the Third War.\nIt was only after the defeat of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; that the Hinterlands began to grow in importance once again. After the Horde had established a new homeland in Kalimdor, emissaries were sent to the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; seeking allies. Some of these emissaries came to the trolls of the Hinterlands seeking to renew the friendships of old. The Vilebranch and the Witherbark refused outright, but the Revantusk trolls, seeking to raise their position, reluctantly agreed. Thereafter, the Horde aided the Revantusk in building their first settlement after centuries of wandering, &lt;a href=\"Revantusk%20Village\"&gt;Revantusk Village&lt;/a&gt;. Because of the aid they received, the Revantusk trolls became staunch allies of the Horde. \nThe Wildhammer dwarves at Aerie peak stood witness to the destruction around them. They watched helplessly as the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;elves&lt;/a&gt; were destroyed by the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; and the crumbling of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. Though the Scourge did not reach the Hinterlands, the dwarves remained on the edge of this frontier. After the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the Wildhammers of the Hinterlands remained independent of the reformed &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; but softened their isolationist stance when Alliance adventurers aided them and proved their worth to them. During the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt;, many Wildhammer veterans from the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Expedition\"&gt;Alliance Expedition&lt;/a&gt; rejoined the Alliance. In fact, their stronghold in &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Valley\"&gt;Shadowmoon Valley&lt;/a&gt; and its other territories were bases for the Alliance.\n&lt;a href=\"Quel%27Danil%20Lodge\"&gt;Quel'Danil Lodge&lt;/a&gt; was used as a center of communication for the high elves of the Hinterlands. Their ambassadors were working to establish relationships with &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;other races&lt;/a&gt;, with whom they shared their knowledge of the &lt;a href=\"Witherbark%20tribe\"&gt;Witherbark trolls&lt;/a&gt; that inhabit the area in the southern Hinterlands. After the Third War, they struck an alliance with the Wildhammer dwarves, much to the ire of their common enemy, the Revantusk trolls.\nPrior to the start of the &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;Invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt;, the Hinterlands were invaded by a group of &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s led by &lt;a href=\"Highlord%20Kruul\"&gt;Highlord Kruul&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nIn order to prevent political turmoil in &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Falstad%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Falstad Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt; will help govern &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; as part of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;Council of Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt;. With Falstad's inclusion into Alliance affairs, the Hinterland Wildhammer dwarves have pledged themselves to the Alliance.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the mainline Alliance and Horde forces turned their attention to this previously neglected region. The &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammer clan&lt;/a&gt; expanded eastward, setting up new camps such as &lt;a href=\"Stormfeather%20Outpost\"&gt;Stormfeather Outpost&lt;/a&gt; in former Revantusk territory. The Horde presence was augmented with the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;, who took over &lt;a href=\"Hiri%27watha\"&gt;Hiri'watha&lt;/a&gt;, converting it into &lt;a href=\"Hiri%27watha%20Research%20Station\"&gt;Hiri'watha Research Station&lt;/a&gt;. Both factions also increased their pressure on the native unaligned trolls, driving them out of their former camps and setting up their own camps on the footsteps of &lt;a href=\"Jintha%27Alor\"&gt;Jintha'Alor&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Witherbark%20tribe\"&gt;Witherbark tribe&lt;/a&gt; was driven from the Hinterlands by the Forsaken.\nAt some point, a group of young &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; moved into the Hinterlands under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Ambassador%20Rualeth\"&gt;Ambassador Rualeth&lt;/a&gt;. While some of them are seen in &lt;a href=\"Aerie%20Peak\"&gt;Aerie Peak&lt;/a&gt;, others moved to the &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Danil%20Lodge\"&gt;Quel'Danil Lodge&lt;/a&gt;. These draenei hope to act as Alliance emissaries and recruit the high elves and Wildhammers of the Hinterlands to the Alliance cause.\nAs part of the Forsaken offensive in all the continent, the lodge came under attack. With the help of adventurers, the Highvale high elves and the draenei settlers were able to repel the &lt;a href=\"Deathstalker%20Invader\"&gt;invaders&lt;/a&gt;. The Highvale documents were also retrieved from the chaos by Alliance adventurers and safely delivered to &lt;a href=\"Anchorite%20Traska\"&gt;Anchorite Traska&lt;/a&gt;.\nOverall, however, the land suffered little from the Cataclysm, retaining its serene, peaceful green landscape of forests and grasslands. A new tunnel was carved into the southern mountains, connecting the Hinterlands with the &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands\"&gt;Arathi Highlands&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeography.\nWhile there are no instanced dungeons in the Hinterlands, the zone is notable for its huge outdoor micro dungeon, &lt;a href=\"Jintha%27Alor\"&gt;Jintha'Alor&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Hinterlands are the location of &lt;a href=\"Seradane\"&gt;Seradane&lt;/a&gt;, one of the four &lt;a href=\"Great%20Tree\"&gt;Great Tree&lt;/a&gt;s leading to the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; and guarded by the four Emerald Dragons. The three others are in &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Duskwood\"&gt;Duskwood&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Feralas\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt;.\nMaps and subregions.\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//wow.gamepressure.com/map.asp%3FID%3D21\"&gt;Topographic map of the Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt;\nNotable characters.\nThe Hinterlands are home to several characters of note. At Aerie Peak, &lt;a href=\"Falstad%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Falstad Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gryphon%20Master%20Talonaxe\"&gt;Gryphon Master Talonaxe&lt;/a&gt; seek aid in locating a young gryphon. At Revantusk Village, &lt;a href=\"Primal%20Torntusk\"&gt;Primal Torntusk&lt;/a&gt; attempts to locate her missing mate, and &lt;a href=\"Huntsman%20Markhor\"&gt;Huntsman Markhor&lt;/a&gt; sends bold adventurers into the deepest part of the wilds in search of dangerous wildlife.\nCataclysm.\nAfter the \"Cataclysm\" expansion, the Hinterlands level range changed from 40-50 to 30-35. \nAreas affected :\nIn the RPG.\nHistory.\nThe Hinterlands have remained pristine for centuries. The &lt;a href=\"Hill%20dwarf\"&gt;hill dwarves&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammer Clan&lt;/a&gt;, the only &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, moved their capital to &lt;a href=\"Aerie%20Peak\"&gt;Aerie Peak&lt;/a&gt; after losing &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt; in the Second War. Wildhammer &lt;a href=\"gryphon%20rider\"&gt;gryphon rider&lt;/a&gt;s are legendary and were a great boon to the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;s.\nWhen the ravenous &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; crashed through the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; and sacked &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, the omens of hope began to glimmer for the trolls. When the orcs invaded a second time, they plowed through &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt; and into Lordaeron. The three troll tribes saw the Horde as the means to their redemption. The Hinterlands forest troll tribes joined the Horde seeking to destroy their old enemies, the elves and the humans. They even managed to invade Quel'Thalas, but the Horde was ultimately defeated. Seeking to avoid the orcs' fate of imprisonment and slavery, the trolls abandoned their allies and returned to the Hinterlands, their dreams of former glory shattered. Even though the trolls were defeated in the war, their role in the greater scheme of things was not quite spent. \nDuring the same war, the Wildhammer dwarves sided with the Alliance, horrified at the defeat of their ancestral homeland of Khaz Modan. They sent their powerful gryphon riders into battle against the Horde. Perhaps without them, the Alliance would not have won. \nIn the events that transpired in Lordaeron during the years to come, the Hinterlands were little affected. The Wildhammer dwarves took in some refugees fleeing the destruction wrought by the Scourge, and many forest trolls moved south as well.\nThough largely peaceful, hostile trolls and dangerous creatures roam the wilderness. These daring trolls steal &lt;a href=\"gryphon\"&gt;gryphon&lt;/a&gt; eggs from Aerie Peak and they have begun training their own gryphon riders. If they complete their training, they would seriously curtail the Wildhammers' dominance, that is why the dwarves ask heroes to rescue the fledgling gryphons and slay the trolls.\nPeople and culture.\nThe savage Wildhammer dwarves, based in Aerie Peak, control most of this territory. For some reason, Wildhammers like &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt;. A connection formed between the two peoples, and seemingly it has something to do with nature and wildness. There are several high elves in Aerie Peak, and they have a &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Danil%20Lodge\"&gt;hunting lodge&lt;/a&gt; nearby.\nThe Hinterlands also play home to two marauding forest troll tribes: the &lt;a href=\"Vilebranch%20tribe\"&gt;Vilebranch&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Witherbark%20tribe\"&gt;Witherbark&lt;/a&gt;. Like other forest trolls, these creatures are vile and sadistic. They harass the Wildhammers constantly and prey on lone travelers. They infect this beautiful land with their presence.\nGeography.\nMaking their home in Aerie Peak, the dwarves have made efforts to preserve this realm. In utter contrast to the &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands\"&gt;Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;, the Hinterlands are a verdant, green realm of majestic oaks and maples. No roads cross the region and the area is tranquil and calm. The northeastern portion is especially idyllic, with mild, pleasant weather and many natural splendors. To the southwest the land becomes a bit misty and forlorn, taking on tones of the &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands\"&gt;Arathi Highlands&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. Vacant &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; farms and settlements are scattered across this area, but the only tangible forces that threaten the Hinterlands are two brutal &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;forest troll&lt;/a&gt; tribes.\nThe Hinterlands border the Arathi Highlands to the south, the &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt; to the southwest, the Alterac Mountains to the west and the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Eastern Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt; to the north. &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Hand\"&gt;Tyr's Hand&lt;/a&gt; in the Plaguelands is very near the border, which may help explain why that city remains relatively safe. It is amazing that the Hinterlands can thrive so near the wasted Plaguelands.\nThe Hinterlands are composed of lovely deciduous forest, primarily oaks and maples. Many of its trees are very old, and in some places branches block out the sun to create a world of perpetual twilight. Mossy beards hang from branches and streams rush over pebbles. The northeast is especially pristine, while the southwest is somewhat misty and eerie. Forest animals of all kinds live within the woods, and the Wildhammers tell explorers that dire &lt;a href=\"bear\"&gt;bear&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"wildkin\"&gt;wildkin&lt;/a&gt; and similarly dangerous creatures are common.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

The Wildhammers have always been staunch allies of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. It is from the Hinterlands that these dwarves find and tame their world-renowned &lt;a href=\"gryphon\"&gt;gryphon&lt;/a&gt;s. The &lt;a href=\"Razorbeak%20Gryphon\"&gt;Razorbeak gryphon&lt;/a&gt;s roam wild in this region. \nAlso in the Hinterlands is one of the last remaining settlements of the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; in Lordaeron at the &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Danil%20Lodge\"&gt;Quel'Danil Lodge&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe Hinterlands are also home to a large population of &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;forest troll&lt;/a&gt;s, which are divided into three separate tribes. The &lt;a href=\"Revantusk%20tribe\"&gt;Revantusk tribe&lt;/a&gt; is the only one of the three that has declared sides in the Horde/Alliance conflict and support the warchief &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Vilebranch\"&gt;Vilebranch&lt;/a&gt; tribe holds residence in the massive troll city of &lt;a href=\"Jintha%27Alor\"&gt;Jintha'Alor&lt;/a&gt; as well as the &lt;a href=\"Altar%20of%20Zul\"&gt;Altar of Zul&lt;/a&gt; while the &lt;a href=\"Witherbark%20tribe\"&gt;Witherbark tribe&lt;/a&gt; holds the smallest influence, hailing from the temples of &lt;a href=\"Shadra%27Alor\"&gt;Shadra'Alor&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the northern part of the region is the ancient, massive tree, &lt;a href=\"Seradane\"&gt;Seradane&lt;/a&gt; where the agents of the &lt;a href=\"Green%20dragonflight\"&gt;Green dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; have been corrupted. A massive portal on the side of the tree connects the servants of the &lt;a href=\"Aspect\"&gt;Aspect&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt; to her own realm, the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nThe earliest inhabitants of the Hinterlands were the &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;forest troll&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20Empire\"&gt;Amani Empire&lt;/a&gt;. This ancient empire stretched across much of eastern &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; with the Hinterlands at its heart. Many great troll cities were built in this region, and their colossal ruins still testify to the once-great empire. The great empire felt the beginnings of its doom when the exiled &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; arrived in Lordaeron. The trolls, though cunning and great in number, were no match for the arcane fires of the elven mages. The elven armies pushed the trolls out of the northern reaches of their empire and built their own cities in their newly acquired country: &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe trolls were forced to retreat to their bastions in the Hinterlands to the south, where they would remain, wary of the elves and their magic, for several generations.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Arathor\"&gt;Arathor&lt;/a&gt; began organizing themselves into a true political entity, the trolls decided to prevent them from gaining a foothold in the political geography of the region. The Amani trolls massed their power in one last bid against their adversaries, but it was for naught. The high elves, seeing a way to be rid of the &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; menace once and for all, taught the humans the secrets of the arcane arts. The trolls were no match for the combined armies and mages of the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s and high elves and they were utterly defeated. This defeat marked the last time the Amani forest trolls would join together as a single nation. Scattered and defeated, the remnants of the Amani returned to their homes in the Hinterlands. Because of their terrible loss, their well-established civilization was virtually gone, and their great monuments and temples began to crumble with no one to keep them up.\nWildhammer arrival.\nThe next time the Hinterlands would play a significant role in history was the coming of the &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammer clan&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt;. After the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;War of the Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt;, the Wildhammer dwarves forsook their subterranean homes and traveled north to the Hinterlands where they built dwellings above the ground at the city of &lt;a href=\"Aerie%20Peak\"&gt;Aerie Peak&lt;/a&gt;. They adopted a society that focused less on metalworking and mining and more on a closeness with nature. They were and remain unique among dwarves (and indeed, all races traditionally of the Alliance) in their cultivation of shamanistic practices. The dwarves also soon realized they had a strong affinity for the wild gryphons of the Hinterlands. Soon they trained gryphon riders who would fly into battle wielding the powers of the storm. So strong was the bond between the dwarves and the gryphons that the dwarves constructed a enormous monument in the likeness of a gryphon at Aerie Peak. Eventually, these gryphon riders would become perhaps their most valuable gift to the Alliance. Upon their arrival, the dwarves found themselves immediately at odds with the trolls of the Hinterlands. The trolls view the Wildhammers as squatters on their ancestral lands and spare no opportunity to accost the dwarves by attacking the gryphon aeries.\nBy the time of the Wildhammer clan's arrival in the Hinterlands, the trolls had recovered some of their numbers after the devastating war. These remnants split themselves into three separate tribes. The &lt;a href=\"Vilebranch\"&gt;Vilebranch&lt;/a&gt; tribe was the strongest and held the ancient Amani bastions of &lt;a href=\"Jintha%27Alor\"&gt;Jintha'Alor&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Altar%20of%20Zul\"&gt;Altar of Zul&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Witherbark%20tribe\"&gt;Witherbark tribe&lt;/a&gt; was weaker than the Vilebranch, residing amongst the old temples of &lt;a href=\"Shadra%27Alor\"&gt;Shadra'Alor&lt;/a&gt; and the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Hiri%27Watha\"&gt;Hiri'Watha&lt;/a&gt;. The weakest of the three tribes was the &lt;a href=\"Revantusk\"&gt;Revantusk&lt;/a&gt; tribe. The Revantusk trolls were nomadic and called no place their home. For many hundreds of years, this was the state of affairs for the trolls.\nSecond War.\nLocated to the southeast of the &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt;, the Hinterlands are home to the Wildhammer clan, renowned for their use of gryphons. Led at that time by &lt;a href=\"Kurdran%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Kurdran Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt;, the Wildhammer clan came under attack by what ultimately proved to be a diversionary tactic by &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt;. The Warchief deduced that if he sent a force to attack the Hinterlands, the Alliance would respond, allowing him to take the remainder of his forces into &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; with the aid of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27jin\"&gt;Zul'jin&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani tribe&lt;/a&gt;. Realizing their plans, &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt; dispatched &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;, along with half the Alliance forces, to travel north to Quel'Thalas and come to the aid of the elves, while he aided Kurdran in clearing out the remaining Horde forces in the Hinterlands. Kurdran pledged his and his kingdom's aid to Anduin Lothar after the human Alliance aided them in forcing the invading orcs and forest trolls out of their homeland.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kurdran%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Kurdran Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt; went to &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; as part of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Expedition\"&gt;Alliance Expedition&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Falstad%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Falstad Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt; stayed in Aerie Peak to succeed him as the High Thane and rule the Wildhammer Clan. Kurdran and his gryphon riders participated in the &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Invasion of Draenor&lt;/a&gt; and was one of the heroes willing to sacrifice their lives to safeguard Azeroth. Kurdran Wildhammer would later have a statue in his likeness built in the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Heroes\"&gt;Valley of Heroes&lt;/a&gt; to honor him for his heroic deeds.\nDuring the war, the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt; had a base at &lt;a href=\"Skulk%20Rock\"&gt;Skulk Rock&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Torntusk\"&gt;Elder Torntusk&lt;/a&gt; was there among the forest trolls when they were driven out by the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and Wildhammers all the way back to the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac Mountains&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the ravenous &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; crashed through the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; and sacked &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, the omens of hope began to glimmer for the trolls. When the orcs invaded a second time, they plowed through &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt; and into Lordaeron. The three tribes saw the Horde as the means to their redemption. The forest troll tribes joined the Horde seeking to destroy their old enemies, the elves and the humans. They even managed to invade Quel'Thalas, but the Horde was ultimately defeated. Seeking to avoid the orcs' fate of imprisonment and slavery, the trolls abandoned their allies and returned to the Hinterlands, their dreams of former glory shattered. Even though the trolls were defeated in the war, their role in the greater scheme of things was not quite spent. \nDuring the same war, the Wildhammer dwarves sided with the Alliance, horrified at the defeat of their ancestral homeland of Khaz Modan. They sent their powerful gryphon riders into battle against the Horde. Perhaps without them, the Alliance would not have won. \nIn the events that transpired in Lordaeron during the years to come, the Hinterlands were little affected. The Wildhammer dwarves took in some refugees fleeing the destruction wrought by the Scourge, and many forest trolls moved south as well.\nAfter the Third War.\nIt was only after the defeat of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; that the Hinterlands began to grow in importance once again. After the Horde had established a new homeland in Kalimdor, emissaries were sent to the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; seeking allies. Some of these emissaries came to the trolls of the Hinterlands seeking to renew the friendships of old. The Vilebranch and the Witherbark refused outright, but the Revantusk trolls, seeking to raise their position, reluctantly agreed. Thereafter, the Horde aided the Revantusk in building their first settlement after centuries of wandering, &lt;a href=\"Revantusk%20Village\"&gt;Revantusk Village&lt;/a&gt;. Because of the aid they received, the Revantusk trolls are now staunch allies of the Horde. \nThe Wildhammer dwarves at Aerie peak stood witness to the destruction around them. They watched helplessly as the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;elves&lt;/a&gt; were destroyed by the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; and the crumbling of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. Though the Scourge has not yet reached the Hinterlands, the dwarves remain on the edge of this frontier. After the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the Wildhammers of the Hinterlands remained independent of the reformed &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; but softened their isolationist stance when Alliance adventurers aided them and proved their worth to them. During the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt;, many Wildhammer veterans from the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Expedition\"&gt;Alliance Expedition&lt;/a&gt; have rejoined the Alliance. In fact, their stronghold in &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Valley\"&gt;Shadowmoon Valley&lt;/a&gt; and its other territories were bases for the Alliance.\n&lt;a href=\"Quel%27Danil\"&gt;Quel'Danil&lt;/a&gt; lodge was used as a center of communication for the high elves of the Hinterlands. Their ambassadors were working to establish relationships with &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;other races&lt;/a&gt;, with whom they shared their knowledge of the &lt;a href=\"Witherbark%20tribe\"&gt;Witherbark trolls&lt;/a&gt; that inhabit the area in the southern Hinterlands. After the Third War, they struck an alliance with the Wildhammer Dwarves, much to the ire of their common enemy, the Revantusk trolls.\nPrior to the start of the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt;, the Hinterlands were invaded by a group of &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s led by &lt;a href=\"Highlord%20Kruul\"&gt;Highlord Kruul&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeography.\nWhile there are no instanced dungeons in the Hinterlands, the zone is notable for its huge outdoor micro dungeon, &lt;a href=\"Jintha%27Alor\"&gt;Jintha'Alor&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Hinterlands are the location of &lt;a href=\"Seradane\"&gt;Seradane&lt;/a&gt;, one of the four &lt;a href=\"Great%20Tree\"&gt;Great Tree&lt;/a&gt;s leading to the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; and guarded by the four Emerald Dragons. The three others are in &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Duskwood%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Duskwood&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Feralas%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt;.\nNotable characters.\nThe Hinterlands are home to several characters of note. At Aerie Peak, &lt;a href=\"Falstad%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Falstad Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gryphon%20Master%20Talonaxe\"&gt;Gryphon Master Talonaxe&lt;/a&gt; seek aid in locating a young gryphon. At Revantusk Village, &lt;a href=\"Primal%20Torntusk\"&gt;Primal Torntusk&lt;/a&gt; attempts to locate her missing mate, and &lt;a href=\"Huntsman%20Markhor\"&gt;Huntsman Markhor&lt;/a&gt; sends bold adventurers into the deepest part of the wilds in search of dangerous wildlife.\nThe Hinterlands, Northeron, and the Aerie Peaks.\nSome speculate that the Hinterlands were the area known as &lt;a href=\"Northeron\"&gt;Northeron&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Aerie%20Peaks\"&gt;Aerie Peaks&lt;/a&gt; before the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, and were later renamed. Others believe the terms have retconned due to the lack of mention in recent lore and refer to what is now the Hinterlands. It is also possible a different relationship between the Hinterlands, Northeron, and the Aerie Peaks exists, such as being subzones within one another, neighboring zones, or possibly having no relationship whatsoever and being separate zones that have yet to show up in &lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;."}

He is currently the apprentice of &lt;a href=\"Mikanikos\"&gt;Mikanikos&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nAlongside many &lt;a href=\"kyrian\"&gt;kyrian&lt;/a&gt; and other stewards, Hipokos was captured during the House of Constructs and &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Rituals\"&gt;House of Rituals&lt;/a&gt;' attack on the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Courage\"&gt;Temple of Courage&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Bastion\"&gt;Bastion&lt;/a&gt; and taken to the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Constructs%20%28subzone%29\"&gt;Construct stronghold&lt;/a&gt; in Maldraxxus. He was locked in a cage in the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Chains\"&gt;Hall of Chains&lt;/a&gt; and had his tongue removed, rendering him mute. Some time thereafter, a &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Walker\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt; arrived and helped the blinded &lt;a href=\"Aspirant%20Thales\"&gt;Aspirant Thales&lt;/a&gt; rescue Hipokos and the other surviving captives, who subsequently relocated to the stronghold's central ripening pond along with &lt;a href=\"Secutor%20Mevix\"&gt;Secutor Mevix&lt;/a&gt;. Thales sent Hipokos and his fellow stewards &lt;a href=\"Kou\"&gt;Kou&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Koa\"&gt;Koa&lt;/a&gt; to retrieve kyrian bodies from around the pit, but Hipokos stayed behind to repair a &lt;a href=\"Destroyed%20Praetor\"&gt;Destroyed Praetor&lt;/a&gt; he found. He turned the construct into a &lt;a href=\"Salvaged%20Praetor\"&gt;Salvaged Praetor&lt;/a&gt;, which the group then used to break into the &lt;a href=\"Flesh%20Stitchery\"&gt;Flesh Stitchery&lt;/a&gt; where they took control of the &lt;a href=\"Soulfused%20Construct\"&gt;Soulfused Construct&lt;/a&gt; and escaped to &lt;a href=\"Spider%27s%20Watch\"&gt;Spider's Watch&lt;/a&gt;.\nHipokos helped defend the &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20the%20Primus\"&gt;Seat of the Primus&lt;/a&gt; when it was attacked by &lt;a href=\"Vyraz\"&gt;Baron Vyraz&lt;/a&gt;'s forces. After the battle, he relocated inside the Seat with Aspirant Thales and seemingly handed over his Salvaged Praetor to &lt;a href=\"Bonesmith%20Heirmir\"&gt;Bonesmith Heirmir&lt;/a&gt;.\nHipokos and the other former Construct captives returned to the Seat of the Primus after the battle of &lt;a href=\"Desmotaeron\"&gt;Desmotaeron&lt;/a&gt; to witness &lt;a href=\"Draka\"&gt;Draka&lt;/a&gt;'s promotion ceremony. During the event, Hipokos could be seen tinkering with a crate of potions. He and the others subsequently returned home to Bastion and were present in &lt;a href=\"Elysian%20Hold\"&gt;Elysian Hold&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Kyrestia%20the%20Firstborne\"&gt;the Archon&lt;/a&gt;'s announcement of the new &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Devotion\"&gt;Temple of Devotion&lt;/a&gt;. During &lt;a href=\"Adrestes\"&gt;Adrestes&lt;/a&gt;' promotion ceremony at the &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20the%20Archon\"&gt;Seat of the Archon&lt;/a&gt;, the Forgelite Prime &lt;a href=\"Mikanikos\"&gt;Mikanikos&lt;/a&gt; revealed that he had taken on Hipokos as his new apprentice and that he believed the other steward's experience in Maldraxxus and passion for the craft would allow him to do great things (with the forgelite's help). Mikanikos added that the two of them worked well together since he was a \"great talker\" and Hipokos was a \"great listener\". During the same event, Thales told the Maw Walker that he and Hipokos had bonded and that the steward would likely continue to serve as the blind aspirant's eyes, just as Thales would serve as Hipokos' voice."}

{"id": "14433", "revid": "46586549", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=14433", "title": "Hippogryph", "text": "A hippogryph, also called a windgryph, is a beast with the hindquarters of a mighty black stag and the head, wings, and forelegs of a large raven. Antlers rise from its feathered head. They are frequently used as mounts by the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilneans&lt;/a&gt;. Hippogryphs are highly intelligent, sentient beings; far more than mere \"mounts\".\nBackground.\nHippogryphs are ancient, magical beasts whose bodies resemble both &lt;a href=\"stag\"&gt;stag&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"raven\"&gt;raven&lt;/a&gt;s. They patrol the skies above &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; and viciously attack any enemies of the wilds that they encounter. Most hippogryphs are found in Kalimdor. While a few of them can be found in Ashenvale, the majority of hippogryphs inhabit the south-western &lt;a href=\"Feralas\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt;. Recently it was also discovered that several hippogryphs live in the northern &lt;a href=\"Howling%20Fjord\"&gt;Howling Fjord&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe intelligent hippogryphs have given their allegiance to the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; in honor of &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;, who stands as the protector of nature and all its creatures. Some say they were created by Cenarius himself as a gift for the night elves. The hippogryphs are wary of other races, but they're intelligent enough to recognize a friend of a friend. In the heat of battle, Night Elf Archers can call upon the mighty Hippogryphs to carry them into the air. The Archers mount the flying beasts and are capable of firing their arrows from the hippogryphs' backs. The brave creatures respond to the female riders as if they shared an empathic bond. Perfectly capable of understanding sentences, they also respond to code sounds. There is also an established code system of tapping the hippogryph's neck, as it is far easier to communicate through touch in driving winds. They appear to take pride in successfully navigating difficult conditions, and having the rider commend or acknowledge them for it. Indeed, their intelligence means that they stand a chance in flying such dangerous weather that no mere bird could withstand.\nOne of the first night elves to speak to the hippogryphs was &lt;a href=\"Dorendil%20Wildcaller\"&gt;Dorendil Wildcaller&lt;/a&gt; of Suramar, now buried at &lt;a href=\"Tel%27anor\"&gt;Tel'anor&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"General%20Startalon\"&gt;General Startalon&lt;/a&gt;, interred next to Dorendil, commanded the hippogryph riders during the War of the Ancients and was interred before the Sundering. The &lt;a href=\"Moon%20Guard\"&gt;Moon Guard&lt;/a&gt; have a long tradition of training hippogryphs for battle.\nThe colors of a hippogryph's feathers may vary, and different hippogryphs inhabit different areas. Feralas hippogryphs seem to be the most colorful, with either dark blue or purple-pink feathers. Most hippogryphs in Azshara and Howling Fjord are white with brown wings, but Azshara also holds a number of green ones with orange wings. The green variant is also common in Ashenvale (though not found on this location in the game), and thus the type chosen by night elves to be their mounts. The white-brown variant is mostly used as a mount within the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt;. A few hippogryphs are also nearly entirely white, and seem to be the preferred variant used by the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Covenant\"&gt;Silver Covenant&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; who apparently have won the respect of these hippogryphs.\nAfter a &lt;a href=\"harpy\"&gt;harpy&lt;/a&gt; incursion in Feralas, several hippogryph nesting grounds were attacked. Hundreds of hatchlings were orphaned, and they were entrusted to the care of the druids on &lt;a href=\"Sardor%20Isle\"&gt;Sardor Isle&lt;/a&gt;. The evil effects of the &lt;a href=\"Gordunni\"&gt;Gordunni&lt;/a&gt; ogres affected them and their numbers began dwindling. &lt;a href=\"Erelas%20Ambersky\"&gt;Erelas Ambersky&lt;/a&gt; enlisted the help of &lt;a href=\"Curgle%20Cranklehop\"&gt;Curgle Cranklehop&lt;/a&gt; and Alliance &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to help retrieve their eggs and move them to &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;. White hippogryphs are very loyal to their riders and the Grand Alliance, while the brown-white ones owned by the Argent Crusade will pair up with the bravest and battle-tested champion.\nAs a hunter pet.\nHippogryphs are tamable by &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s as part of the &lt;a href=\"feathermane\"&gt;feathermane&lt;/a&gt; family. This requires reading the &lt;a href=\"Tome%20of%20the%20Hybrid%20Beast\"&gt;Tome of the Hybrid Beast&lt;/a&gt;, which in turn requires completion of the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore%20storyline\"&gt;Broken Shore storyline&lt;/a&gt; (Legionfall campaign) and the hunter class mount storyline.\nIn the RPG.\nContrary to common belief, hippogryphs are not simply domesticated beasts that serve as &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; mounts. They are no less intelligent than most &lt;a href=\"humanoid\"&gt;humanoid&lt;/a&gt; races, in fact - though they are wary of non-elf races, as &lt;a href=\"kobold\"&gt;kobold&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s have both attempted to enslave hippogryphs in the past. Most hippogryphs dwell in &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt; and other forested regions commonly inhabited by night elves, and have been the staunch partners of the Kaldorei from time immemorial. Indeed, some legends say that hippogryphs may have originally been created by the night elves, or that they were gifts from &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;. While kind and generous to their night elf companions, hippogryphs are ferocious and fearsome beasts when fighting any creature they deem hostile.\nNight elf Sentinels watch over nests of hippogryph eggs. Likewise, hippogryphs care for the children of the night elves. Though most prefer to stay and protect communities, young hippogryphs taken with the urge to explore and see the forest beyond their nests often serve as willing mounts for night elf &lt;a href=\"windwarrior\"&gt;windwarrior&lt;/a&gt;s. Hippogryphs speak &lt;a href=\"Darnassian\"&gt;Darnassian&lt;/a&gt;, but are capable of learning &lt;a href=\"Common%20%28language%29\"&gt;Common&lt;/a&gt; and other languages.\nHippogryphs have a keen awareness of aerial tactics. Without riders, they attack in quick dives, striking with their beaks followed by swipes with their talons. Female hippogryphs avoid direct combat. If trapped on the ground, hippogryphs charge, trying to get space to regain the air. Carrying night elf archers, hippogryphs make careful circling attacks, darting within range long enough for a shot before wheeling away.\nOne could find the legendary hippogryphs in &lt;a href=\"Mirkfallon%20Lake\"&gt;Mirkfallon Lake&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, which migrate here from the cooler north. They roost near the lake in cave complexes high on the slopes.\nInspiration.\nThe is a legendary creature with the front quarters of an eagle and the hind quarters of a horse, said to be the offspring of a mare (female horse) and a &lt;a href=\"gryphon\"&gt;gryphon&lt;/a&gt;. It is sometimes seen as a symbol of love, since gryphons and horses are said to be mortal enemies.\n\"Note: Within Warcraft, the spelling is \"hippogryph\", but outside the \"World of Warcraft\", the spelling \"hippogriff\" is also valid, as \"gryphon\" is also spelled \"griffin\" or \"griffon.\"\""}

The bat god spoke in Vol'jin's head, telling him that his efforts to preserve the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspears&lt;/a&gt; had caused him to become separated from the loa. While his body healed, his soul would not unless he returned to the \"true ways\"; abandoning his history would only make the chasm grow.

Hir'eek did not reply, which the Darkspear chieftain took as a bad omen.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nHir'eek would eventually be corrupted by &lt;a href=\"G%27huun\"&gt;G'huun&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"blood%20troll\"&gt;blood troll&lt;/a&gt;s, and subsequently slain by an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; with the aid of &lt;a href=\"Jo%27chunga\"&gt;Jo'chunga&lt;/a&gt; and his poison at the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20Midnight\"&gt;Sanctum of Midnight&lt;/a&gt;.

This article documents the history of the concept, from their beginnings as a recurring in-joke and easter egg before the release of ' (2002) until their official introduction in ' (2012).\nCreation.\n&lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard's&lt;/a&gt; longtime art director &lt;a href=\"Samwise%20Didier\"&gt;Samwise Didier&lt;/a&gt; originally created the pandaren race in his own art. The origin can be traced back to Didier's brother and his \"fantastic skill at mangling up words and phrases\". During a desert camping trip, Didier's brother commented that Samwise was \"like one of those panda bears -- you're never cold\". Even though he meant to say \"polar bear\", the saying stuck and Didier was thereafter known among friends by the nickname \"Panda\".\nAfter the birth of Didier's daughter a few years later, he drew a Christmas picture for his family depicting a humanoid panda with a cub on his shoulder. With Didier's permission, one of Blizzard's webmasters later turned the picture into an official Blizzard wallpaper. This got a huge response from \"Warcraft\" fans, to Didier's surprise: \"[...] we put that up in there and everyone was like \u201cOh my God! A PANDA RACE? That\u2019s kind of cool!\u201d And I\u2019m like \u201cAre you kidding me, really? You want to see pandas in \"Warcraft III\" or whatever?\u201d\" Since that first piece of concept art, the pandaren have always been a fan favorite race (combining a heady mix of panda humanoids, eastern-style religions and mythology, and beer-brewing monks).\nDebuts in Warcraft III.\nAfter the original pandaren image, Didier began representing himself as a panda in other pieces of personal art. Before the release of \"\", he included a as an easter egg in one of the game's . This was quickly noticed by attentive fansites and spawned a number of panda-related rumors, which Didier in turn encouraged by including similar easter eggs in other places. When Blizzard were considering what to do for &lt;a href=\"2002%20April%20Fools\"&gt;2002's April Fools' Day&lt;/a&gt;, they decided to tie into the rumors by officially \"announcing\" that the pandaren would be the &lt;a href=\"Pandaren%20%28April%20Fools%29\"&gt;fifth playable race&lt;/a&gt; of \"Warcraft III\", using fake screenshots and some of Didier's personal artwork. The joke got a massive response from fans, including some who initially thought it was serious and were disappointed when it turned out to be a joke.\nAlthough they were originally announced as an April Fools joke, the pandaren would actually find their way into the game as a neutral hostile &lt;a href=\"creep\"&gt;creep&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike the &lt;a href=\"Furbolg%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;furbolgs&lt;/a&gt;\u2014whose model the pandaren shares (with a different skin and icon)\u2014there was only a single type of pandaren creep in \"Reign of Chaos\". The pandaren are native only to the &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; tileset. The human campaign mission &lt;a href=\"Dissension\"&gt;Dissension&lt;/a&gt; includes a lone pandaren hiding behind some trees near the center of the map. The undead campaign mission, &lt;a href=\"Digging%20up%20the%20Dead\"&gt;Digging up the Dead&lt;/a&gt; features a hidden &lt;a href=\"pandaren%20relaxation%20area\"&gt;pandaren relaxation area&lt;/a&gt; which causes a copy of Samwise's original pandaren artwork to be flashed briefly upon entering it, though no pandaren are actually present. A pandaren also appears in the ending cinematic of the night elf campaign mission, &lt;a href=\"Enemies%20at%20the%20Gate\"&gt;Enemies at the Gate&lt;/a&gt;. Finally, the night elf campaign mission, &lt;a href=\"Brothers%20in%20Blood\"&gt;Brothers in Blood&lt;/a&gt; features a hidden area hiding &lt;a href=\"The%20Largest%20Panda%20Ever\"&gt;The Largest Panda Ever&lt;/a&gt;. As an additional easter egg by Didier, the warglaives wielded by &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; and other &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Hunter%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Demon Hunter&lt;/a&gt; units have panda faces on them (a replacement for the original design, which when shrunk down for the in-game model ended up resembling a swastika).\nWith the release of \"Warcraft III\"'s expansion, \"\", the &lt;a href=\"Pandaren%20Brewmaster%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;pandaren brewmaster&lt;/a&gt; was added as a neutral hero, available and playable on nearly every melee map. One brewmaster, &lt;a href=\"Chen%20Stormstout\"&gt;Chen Stormstout&lt;/a&gt; was included as an optional playable hero in the expansion's &lt;a href=\"The%20Founding%20of%20Durotar\"&gt;bonus campaign&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href=\"Brewmaster%20drinking%20area\"&gt;hidden brewmaster area&lt;/a&gt; can be found in the night elf mission &lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20the%20Betrayer\"&gt;Wrath of the Betrayer&lt;/a&gt;, and a squad of pandaren led by a brewmaster appears in the &lt;a href=\"The%20Crossing\"&gt;Alliance Campaign secret mission&lt;/a&gt;. Lastly, the official online Blizzard strategy guide had its name (and fictional author) changed from \"&lt;a href=\"Marn%20Thunderhorn\"&gt;Marn Thunderhorn&lt;/a&gt;'s Warcraft III Strategy Guide\" to \"&lt;a href=\"Mojo%20Stormstout\"&gt;Mojo Stormstout&lt;/a&gt;'s Warcraft III Strategy Guide.\" Thus, by the release of \"The Frozen Throne\", pandaren were no longer considered a \"secret.\"\nIn the beta, pandaren wore samurai armor but as the panda as an animal is linked to China rather than Japan, some Chinese players complained and this was soon fixed.\nHints in World of Warcraft.\nDue to the pandaren's popularity, their possible appearance in WoW has been hinted at multiple times by Blizzard.\nScrapped race in The Burning Crusade.\nThe pandaren were initially planned to be the new playable race for the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\"'s first expansion, \"\", but about halfway through development they were replaced with the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;. In a Q&amp;A thread on Reddit in April 2020, former Blizzard artist &lt;a href=\"Trent%20Kaniuga\"&gt;Trent Kaniuga&lt;/a&gt; stated that this was because the Chinese government told Blizzard that they couldn't use pandas in the game. By that point, the artists had already created concept art for pandaren cities and buildings, but the change happened early enough in development that not much content was cut. The developers would not get permission to implement pandas until &lt;a href=\"%23Mists%20of%20Pandaria\"&gt;5 years later&lt;/a&gt;. According to Kaniuga, \"In reality it was probably just that they needed more time to negotiate it. Panda's are a national treasure in China, so it takes a lot of negotiating to work a deal to distribute characters that look like that in China.\"\nBecause of this, the pandaren's replacement\u2014the draenei\u2014were not ready to be showcased in time for the public announcement of \"The Burning Crusade\" at &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon%202005\"&gt;BlizzCon 2005&lt;/a&gt;; only the new &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; race\u2014the &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;\u2014was revealed, with no mention of what the Alliance race would be. This quickly led to a large amount of &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade%27s%20race%20ideas\"&gt;rumors and speculation&lt;/a&gt; among fans, with the pandaren being one of the more popular races brought up as a possibility. A \"leaked\" pandaren screenshot began circulating around various forums the day before BlizzCon, but on April 1 the following year it was revealed to have been a prank created by Ian McConville of the \"&lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.machall.com/\"&gt;Mac Hall&lt;/a&gt;\" webcomic. A BlizzCon 2005 article by Eurogamer stated that \"mentioning the ex-April-Fools-joke Pandaren Empire to Blizzard staff got a surprisingly cagey response...\" On October 31, a few days after BlizzCon, Stephen Glicker of the website Gaming Steve\u2014who claimed to have unofficial contacts at Blizzard\u2014stated that when editors from various gaming magazines were brought to Blizzard's offices to view \"The Burning Crusade\" for the first time, they saw dozens of posters and artwork depicting pandaren as the new Alliance race. Glicker further stated that, at the time, Blizzard had been \"80% certain\" that the pandaren would be the new Alliance race, but due to the political reasons surrounding the issue there was now a \"zero percent chance\" of the race making it into the game.\nThe draenei were officially unveiled as the new Alliance race at E3 2006, roughly 6 months after the announcement of \"The Burning Crusade\", but rumors persisted that the developers had originally planned to use pandaren instead. Blizzard would not confirm or deny these rumors directly until &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon%202011\"&gt;BlizzCon 2011&lt;/a&gt;, when &lt;a href=\"Chris%20Metzen\"&gt;Chris Metzen&lt;/a&gt; revealed during an interview with Direct TV that this was indeed the case.\nMists of Pandaria.\nOn July 28, 2011, Blizzard issued a trademark for the name \"Mists of Pandaria.\" Blizzard told GameSpot, \"We appreciate your interest in our trademark filings, but we\u2019re not ready to reveal any details at this time.\" Game Director &lt;a href=\"Tom%20Chilton\"&gt;Tom Chilton&lt;/a&gt; later said in an interview with IGN that the speculation was \"wildly overhyped.\" He added, \"if you look at traditionally how we've handled that race it's been in those secondary products because we haven't realized it in the world. Most of the time when we do anything panda-related it's going to be a comic book or a figurine or something like that.\"\nOn October 21, 2011 at &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon%202011\"&gt;BlizzCon 2011&lt;/a&gt;, Blizzard officially announced \"\" as the fourth &lt;a href=\"expansion\"&gt;expansion&lt;/a&gt;, and the pandaren became the first playable race available to both the Horde and the Alliance.\nControversy.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Chris%20Metzen\"&gt;Chris Metzen&lt;/a&gt; introduced \"Mists of Pandaria\" during the opening ceremony of &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon%202011\"&gt;BlizzCon 2011&lt;/a&gt;, controversy ensued, with the WoW community becoming somewhat divided over the expansion. Some players were very positive on the newly added pandaren race, which are basically beer-brewing kung fu-fighting panda bears. Others, on the other hand, seemed to have some pretty negative opinions about the pandaren and the expansion in general also featuring a &lt;a href=\"Pet%20Battle%20System\"&gt;\"Pok\u00e9mon\"-like pet system&lt;/a&gt; and no initial main antagonist; they seemed to worry about the potentially cute-and-cuddly implications of giant pandas, especially given that the pandaren previously showed up as an April Fools joke. Other players, who had never heard of the pandaren until recently, believed that Blizzard had in fact based this race on the \"\" franchise, due to the films' popularity and how well the pandaren in the trailer matches Po's appearance and fighting style in the films. \nDuring the \"World of Warcraft\" Story and Lore panel, Metzen was unequivocal about the pandaren and this expansion's place in the greater WoW lore. \"This is no joke,\" Metzen said in response to a question about whether \"Mists of Pandaria\" would see more serious story content. \"This is not a throw-away silly-silly ha ha funny expansion set; it is absolutely the next vital chapter and as things ratchet up, they\u2019re gonna get really gnarly. There's no way we\u2019re gonna build an expansion set based on an April Fools Joke.\" During an interview with Game Front, Lead Quest Designer &lt;a href=\"Dave%20Kosak\"&gt;Dave Kosak&lt;/a&gt;, who also was on the panel with Metzen, echoed the sentiments that \"Mists of Pandaria\" may seem more light-hearted, but it's just as important to the overall WoW experience as the previous expansion sets. Kosak also said that a playable pandaren race is \u201cby far\u201d the most asked-for \"World of Warcraft\" feature among fans.\nIn a retrospective interview with WIRED in June 2018, Game Director &lt;a href=\"Ion%20Hazzikostas\"&gt;Ion Hazzikostas&lt;/a&gt; said of \"Mists of Pandaria\" that \"There were a number of people who were turned off by the theme, by the motif of the expansion. They saw \"Mists of Pandaria\", they saw these pandas [...] and said \u201cThis isn't the \"Warcraft\" I know. The \"Warcraft\" I know is about orcs and humans and dragons, and this feels like a different game, this feels almost childish.\u201d In retrospect, many of those players would say [that] those who passed on the expansion for that reason made a mistake. Players who gave it a chance, who got into the story, quickly discovered that it actually was one of the most complex narratives and beautiful environments that \"World of Warcraft\" has ever presented to this day. As players today discuss \u201cWhat was your favorite expansion?\u201d, \u201cWhat was the best expansion?\u201d, \"Mists of Pandaria\" tends to figure prominently in those discussions.\""}

{"id": "27358", "revid": "26060681", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=27358", "title": "Hit", "text": "Hit refers to physical damage that occurs as a result of an attack made with melee or ranged weapons. The term is also used to describe a character's chance of not missing. Characters have a 100% chance to hit when fighting creatures up to 3 levels higher (bosses included), but their hit chance decreases when fighting characters above that level. \nPrior to \"&lt;a href=\"Warlords%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Warlords of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;\", players' chance to hit was lower; a secondary attribute called hit rating was used to ensure that the player would not miss against targets. The hit rating secondary attribute was removed with &lt;a href=\"Patch%206.0.2\"&gt;Patch 6.0.2&lt;/a&gt; along with &lt;a href=\"Expertise\"&gt;Expertise&lt;/a&gt;. The developers described the process of reaching the expertise and hit caps as a penalty rather than an augmentation, with players inevitably regarding the stats as mandatory rather than \"fun\". As a result, the stats were removed, with players effectively automatically capped in both expertise and hit.\nCalculating miss rate.\nIf the difference between the mob's level and your level is less than or equal to 2, then the formula for calculating your base miss rate against that mob is: \nIf the difference between the mob's level and your level is greater than 2, then the formula for calculating your base miss rate against that mob is: \nApplying these formulas gives the following base miss rate for a Level 90 character:\nThus, if you are a Level 90 character with no talents increasing your chance to hit, you need a Hit Rating of 2550 (7.50%) to never miss a shot against a Level 93 boss (or skull mob) with a special attack or single-wield auto-attack (see &lt;a href=\"%23Hit_rating_cap\"&gt;hit rating cap below&lt;/a&gt;).\nMelee attacks divide into two categories: auto-attacks (white attack/damage) and special attacks (yellow attack/damage). Attacking a mob from behind removes parry and block from both tables, provided the attack is more than 0.5 yards away (measured from center to center rather than with the &lt;a href=\"hitbox\"&gt;hitbox&lt;/a&gt;).\nAuto attacks.\nEach melee auto attack made by characters against mobs will result in one of the following (in order of precedence):\nHit chance doesn't work by increasing the amount of \"Hit\" on these tables. Instead, it works by decreasing the amount of miss.\nCritical strike chance \"fills in\" the hit chance portion of this table. Crit is \"capped\" when the crit chance exceeds the amount of hit chance on the table. Until we reach that cap, hit chance has NO effect on crit chance. For example: maximum dual wielding weapon skill, chance to hit 0% and chance to critical strike 50%. Dual wield auto-attacking a raid boss from behind results in a loss of 8.6% critical strike:\nIncrease chance to hit to 10% and decrease chance to critical strike to 45% results in no loss of critical strike:\nIt is actually quite difficult to be crit capped without trying. This is one reason why it's important to maintain a balance of stats, and not to \"stack\" any one stat indiscriminately.\nSpecial attacks.\nEach melee special attack made by characters against mobs will result in one of the following (in order of precedence):\nThe system is exactly the same as normal attacks, except the miss chance is reduced to 8%, whether dual-wielding or not.\nEnhancers.\nCooking.\n adds 20 Hit rating for 30 minutes.\n and add 40 Hit rating for 1 hour."}

She is very capable with various weapons. At some point, she dueled with &lt;a href=\"Reigol%20Valdread\"&gt;Reigol Valdread&lt;/a&gt; of the on the \"Makemba\" some time after the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;.\nShe had four children - &lt;a href=\"Adashe%20Flintwill\"&gt;Adashe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Akashinga%20Flintwill\"&gt;Akashinga&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Amahle%20Flintwill\"&gt;Amahle&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Makasa%20Flintwill\"&gt;Makasa&lt;/a&gt; - each with different father, raising them all by herself on the \"Makemba\" that operated out of &lt;a href=\"Booty%20Bay\"&gt;Booty Bay&lt;/a&gt;. She was tough on them, especially on Makasa as she saw herself in her youngest, teaching them the life of a pirate. She also told Makasa tales about the SI:7 agents. She was capable of tenderness and kindness but only after a good day. She believed that Makasa could one day rule the Blackwater Raiders. Marjani agreed with Blackwater's rule not to kill other ships' crew, but not because of honor, but because of practicality that the ship could return to be plundered again.\nSome time after the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, her children were relocated to the \"&lt;a href=\"Sea%20King\"&gt;Sea King&lt;/a&gt;.\" She gave no indication if it bothered her to lose them from her crew and said that she can always make new ones. Despite this, on their departure, she kissed them all and wished them good luck. This was the last time she would see any of them. Several weeks after this, the \"Sea King\" returned to Booty Bay and she would learn that the Flintwills brothers died and Makasa left.\nSpeculation.\nAs Makasa is said to have ancestors from &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt;, and was raised only by her mother, it is very likely that the ancestors are from Marjani's side of the family."}

As of &lt;a href=\"Patch%203.3.3\"&gt;Patch 3.3.3&lt;/a&gt;, battleground Marks of Honor (apart from &lt;a href=\"Wintergrasp%20Mark%20of%20Honor\"&gt;Wintergrasp Mark of Honor&lt;/a&gt;) are no longer obtainable, but before this patch they were obtained by participating in any &lt;a href=\"Battleground\"&gt;Battleground&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"World%20PvP\"&gt;World PvP&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"Patch%204.0.1\"&gt;Patch 4.0.1&lt;/a&gt;, all Marks of Honor and PvP tokens were converted into &lt;a href=\"Honor%20Points\"&gt;Honor Points&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattleground Marks of Honor.\nBattleground Marks of Honor were awarded to players who participate in Battlegrounds. At the end of the match, each player in the battleground was awarded either: \"one mark of honor for a loss, two marks of honor for a draw or three marks of honor for a win.\" Players who leave Battlegrounds before the match is completed would not receive any marks of honor. \nEach Battleground offered its own mark of honor. For example, &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Gulch\"&gt;Warsong Gulch&lt;/a&gt; awards players with the &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Gulch%20Mark%20of%20Honor\"&gt;Warsong Gulch Mark of Honor&lt;/a&gt;. Each type of mark of honor stacks up to 100 units. If a player accumulates more than 100 units of any type of mark of honor, the excess would be automatically mailed to the player via the in-game mailbox. See &lt;a href=\"Battlegrounds\"&gt;Battlegrounds&lt;/a&gt; for more complete details.\nPrior to 3.3.3 battleground marks of honor were used as currency in conjunction with &lt;a href=\"honor%20points\"&gt;honor points&lt;/a&gt; to purchase items from vendors in the &lt;a href=\"Champion%27s%20Hall\"&gt;Champion's Hall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Legends\"&gt;Hall of Legends&lt;/a&gt; as well as Battleground vendors located in Hillsbrad (&lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Valley\"&gt;Alterac Valley&lt;/a&gt;), Ashenvale (&lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Gulch\"&gt;Warsong Gulch&lt;/a&gt;), and Arathi Highlands (&lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Basin\"&gt;Arathi Basin&lt;/a&gt;).\nPlayers can turn in 1 of each of the 6 battleground Marks of Honor for &lt;a href=\"Honor%20Points\"&gt;honor points&lt;/a&gt;, reputation and via the &lt;a href=\"Concerted%20Efforts%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Concerted Efforts (quest)&lt;/a&gt; Although repeatable, additional turn-ins do not give more &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn general, items purchasable by battleground marks of honor are no longer all that useful to players. Most current PVP gear is purchasable by either honor points or a combination of honor points and arena points. This makes the best use for battleground marks of honor the quest referenced above, once the player has some of the more unique items purchasable by marks of honor.\nValue.\nFollowing &lt;a href=\"Patch%203.3.3\"&gt;Patch 3.3.3&lt;/a&gt;, battleground Marks of Honor could no longer be used as currency for items, instead they could be traded in to Brigadier Generals in Orgrimmar, Stormwind City and Dalaran for 185 &lt;a href=\"Honor%20Points\"&gt;Honor Points&lt;/a&gt; each. In \"&lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;\", all remaining Marks of Honor were converted into &lt;a href=\"Honor%20Points\"&gt;Honor Points&lt;/a&gt;, forever removing the currency.\nWorld PvP Marks of Honor.\nWorld PvP marks are awarded to players when they score an &lt;a href=\"Honorable%20Kill\"&gt;Honorable Kill&lt;/a&gt; against an enemy faction member when in the specified zone. &lt;a href=\"Mark%20of%20Honor%20Hold\"&gt;Mark of Honor Hold&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mark%20of%20Thrallmar\"&gt;Mark of Thrallmar&lt;/a&gt; can be obtained by scoring honorable kills in &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zangarmarsh\"&gt;Zangarmarsh&lt;/a&gt;. These can be used to purchase a few items from vendors in &lt;a href=\"Honor%20Hold\"&gt;Honor Hold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thrallmar\"&gt;Thrallmar&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Zangarmarsh\"&gt;Zangarmarsh&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Field%20Scout\"&gt;Alliance Field Scout&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Horde%20Field%20Scout\"&gt;Horde Field Scout&lt;/a&gt;). \n&lt;a href=\"Halaa%20Battle%20Token\"&gt;Halaa Battle Token&lt;/a&gt;s are awarded to those who score an honorable kill in the vicinity of &lt;a href=\"Halaa\"&gt;Halaa&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt;. They can be used to purchase a few items from vendors in &lt;a href=\"Halaa\"&gt;Halaa&lt;/a&gt; when controlled by the player's faction.\nValue.\nUnlike battleground marks of honor, world PvP marks of honor are used to purchase items from vendors without requiring any honor points or other currency. However, there are comparatively few rewards available for these marks, and they are generally of lower quality than battleground rewards.\nSee also.\nBattleground marks\nWorld marks"}

Upon their arrival, Wormthorn believed that the &lt;a href=\"Tainted%20Scar\"&gt;Tainted Scar&lt;/a&gt; could be healed, and attempted to grow it back by creating the great tree &lt;a href=\"Maldraz\"&gt;Maldraz&lt;/a&gt; with his power. From underneath its trunk, he entered a druidic trance and began to bring life back to the area. At first, it was a success and the forest was restored to its former, greener self, allowing the refugees to build &lt;a href=\"Surwich\"&gt;Surwich&lt;/a&gt; where the Tainted Scar was once present.\nHowever, the &lt;a href=\"Fel\"&gt;residual demonic powers&lt;/a&gt; left on the land began to take their toll, and while Wormthorn's attention was drawn to fighting back the demonic taint, the &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt; who had formerly resided there took the opportunity to infiltrate Madraz. Once inside, they corrupted Wormthorn's trance, making him lose his mind in the process, and used his body as a weapon to corrupt the tree and the forest.\nIn order to halt the corruption he had created from endangering the lives of others, a &lt;a href=\"Demoniac%20Vessel\"&gt;Demoniac Vessel&lt;/a&gt; was separately created by &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Observer%20Shayana\"&gt;Cenarion Observer Shayana&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Elijah%20Dawnflight\"&gt;Elijah Dawnflight&lt;/a&gt; to break Wormthorn's trance.
