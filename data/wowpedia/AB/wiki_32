As a child, he learned from most of his lessons that non-Dalaran mages, wild, untrained, and self-taught wizards without restraint, control, and thought, always ended in the same fashion with a bad end, and sometimes, though not often, destroying a large amount of the surrounding countryside with them.\nHedge mages often use the smoke of an herb known as &lt;a href=\"Witchbane\"&gt;Witchbane&lt;/a&gt; to draw evil from its hiding places.\nCertain renegade wizards have also been known to create their own &lt;a href=\"golem\"&gt;golem&lt;/a&gt;s to protect their secret dens and lairs. Many rogue mage disciples sanction exotic creature polymorphic studies.\nFirst War.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Northshire%20Abbey\"&gt;Northshire Abbey&lt;/a&gt; was attacked by a band of &lt;a href=\"brigand\"&gt;brigand&lt;/a&gt;s that had been convinced by enemy agents to fight against the crown.

He is the famous \"dance boss\". If you master the dance, then you master the fight. Some may view this as an easy feat, while many players struggle to master the concept.\nHistory.\nThe mastermind behind the magic of the cauldrons that quickly spread the undead plague through &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, corrupting not just the humans but flora and fauna in the area as well. The entire wilderness surrounding Lordaeron is now referred to as \"the Plaguelands\" \u2014 thanks in no small part to Heigan's handiwork.\n25-man abilities.\nPhase two.\nAfter 90 seconds Heigan will teleport to the middle of the raised platform and begin channeling.\n10-man abilities.\nHeigan the Unclean has approximately 3,060,000 hit points. Note that unlike 40-man Naxxramas the tunnel before Heigan is no longer a gauntlet.\nPhase two.\nAfter 90 seconds Heigan will teleport to the middle of the raised platform and begin channeling.\nStrategy.\nThe fight goes as a 135 second cycle:\nPositioning and movement is everything in this fight. Heigan deals extremely low melee damage and has no enrage timer, which means no one should have to worry about getting off a last cast before moving. You won't have time. No matter how much time you think you have, it is likely not enough. During all of phase 2, you will be almost constantly moving, and not worrying about casting anything or using any attacks. Tanks should not be afraid to turn their backs to Heigan, as his damage is low enough for a healer to easily heal through it. The only real source of damage (if the raid can properly avoid Eruptions) is Decrepit Fever, which should be removed immediately by a healer. Cleansing a disease is instant cast, and therefore can be done while moving.\nAlternate strategy.\nFor those groups that have trouble dancing, are heavy on melee dps, and which have a druid healer, there is an alternate strategy (the \"Lockard Maneuver\") which can make this fight much easier.\nThis approach hinges on the fact that Heigan's Spell Disruption ability only affects abilities with a cast time. Due to this fact, there is no need to dance at all in Phase 1 as long as your druid(s) (and other healers) can keep the tank up with HoTs and instant heals and you have sufficient melee dps to make good progress on the boss.\nTo execute the strategy, simply tank Heigan on the platform during the entirety of Phase 1. Make sure to tank him far enough on the platform that your melee dps won't be hanging off the edge, otherwise they'll take eruption hits.\nWhen he teleports to begin Phase 2, quickly get off the platform to avoid the platform AoE and to prepare for the fast dance. Run the dance through to completion, and when he transitions back to Phase 1, once again rush the platform to take him down. A well-geared group that is heavy on melee dps should be able to take him down in two platform phases, three at the outside.\nAlthough you will still be dancing in Phase 2, the major advantage of this approach is that you don't need to worry about moving Heigan around during Phase 1. The Phase 2 dance is faster, but you only have to concentrate on moving yourself, not trying to dps or position a boss as well.\nThe Heigan Dance.\nRegardless of the strategy you use during this fight, the key to taking Heigan down is learning the dance. If you are able to do the dance, then the following strategy will optimize your DPS and make this fight go much faster, thus reducing the potential for wipes. Unless your group is mostly ranged casters, then the above alternate strategy would be best. However, if your tanks are doing about 10% of group damage each, having your tanks run with Heigan doing nothing more than keeping aggro reduces the total group DPS output by about 20%. The same will go for each melee class that is required to run, reducing your damage output for that party member by about 80%, so something to consider when trying an alternate strategy that has your melee running with Heigan.\nYou want to start the fight by having your tank rush Heigan on the platform and have all melee DPS go to the platform as well. It is a good idea to have him tanked as far back on the platform as possible so you avoid anyone on the platform from getting hit by the eruptions. This allows your tank and all melee to concentrate on doing the most damage to Heigan during Phase 1.\nAll of the healers and caster ranged classes should be out on the floor and working through the dance required for Phase 1. The advantage here is that both ranged and healers can cast spells with worrying about the effects of &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wowhead.com/%3Fspell%3D29310\"&gt;Spell Disruption&lt;/a&gt;. With the tank stationary, they will also be able to manage the distance better individually rather than having to worry about the tank getting Heigan too close to the caster group. This provides more than sufficient time to cast spells for healing and DPS while allowing the tank and melee to maximize DPS. Note: Losing a healer during this stage has less impact than losing a tank out on the floor during eruptions.\nAs Heigan approaches Phase 2, there are 5\u201310 seconds between the last eruption and his teleportation and quickened eruptions, during which everyone must get to the starting zone for the Phase 2 dance. Begin running towards the starting zone just a few seconds prior to teleportation so you are not caught out on the floor during the first eruption in Phase 2.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

The items have a light blue hue in their text color (golden before &lt;a href=\"patch%207.0.3\"&gt;patch 7.0.3&lt;/a&gt;), and their attributes scale with the character's level, with upgrades to increase the max level it can scale to. Nearly all heirloom items are named after popular items from the early days of &lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;classic WoW&lt;/a&gt; and share the look of these items.\nOnce purchased, heirlooms are learned like mounts, pets, and toys, and show up in the &lt;a href=\"Heirlooms%20tab\"&gt;Heirlooms tab&lt;/a&gt;. From there, players can upgrade their heirlooms to be effective for more levels, and to make copies of the heirlooms to use on a character. Heirlooms can be mailed to any character that shares the same account, including those of opposing faction or on different realms.\nSince after &lt;a href=\"patch%209.0.1\"&gt;patch 9.0.1&lt;/a&gt;, heirloom provides better attributes and a set bonus during the leveling experience to reach current content. Prior to patch 9.0.1, the shoulders, chest pieces, cloaks, helms, legs, and the rings granted greater &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; gains while wearing them. The experience bonuses stacked with each other and with the &lt;a href=\"rested\"&gt;rested&lt;/a&gt; bonus, and affect experience gains from &lt;a href=\"quest\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt;s, but did not stack with &lt;a href=\"Essence%20of%20Wintergrasp\"&gt;Essence of Wintergrasp&lt;/a&gt;. The maximum possible experience bonus from heirlooms alone was 55% (with full heirloom set, Garrison Shipyard Ring, and &lt;a href=\"Dread%20Pirate%20Ring\"&gt;Dread Pirate Ring&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Fishing%20Extravaganza\"&gt;Stranglethorn Fishing Extravaganza&lt;/a&gt;).\nHeirloom items do not have a durability stat and do not need to be repaired. This saves money when leveling the character.\nHeirloom item restrictions are skill-based and not class-based. For example, any class could wear the cloth shoulders and chest for the 20% experience boost, but classes such as warriors and rogues would not benefit from the item's casting stats. Because characters don't typically get any shoulder or head gear until after level 20, putting any lower-armor-type XP enhancing heirloom you may have sitting around (like cloth, which all can wear) on even a mail or leather class will be helpful until you start getting equipment for what would otherwise just be just an empty slot\nCollection system.\n&lt;a href=\"Patch%206.1\"&gt;Patch 6.1&lt;/a&gt; implemented the &lt;a href=\"Heirlooms%20tab\"&gt;Heirlooms tab&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Collections\"&gt;Collections&lt;/a&gt; interface, and thus players now only need to acquire heirlooms once to learn them. Once learned (like pets, mounts or toys), players can right-click on an heirloom to add it to that character's inventory. Duplicate heirlooms and heirlooms that have been learned but are not useful to the current character can (like toys) be deleted without any further issue if they have not been enchanted.\nThe vast majority of heirlooms scale from levels 1 to 60, but can be upgraded with tokens three times: once to be effective from levels 1 to 90, secondly to 100, and finally to level 110. Upgraded heirlooms, when created from the heirlooms tab, will show up in characters' bags at the upgrade level seen in the UI.\nEnchants only apply to individual copies of heirlooms (unlike upgrades), so if an heirloom has been enchanted and it is no longer useful to the character wearing it, consider mailing the heirloom to another character rather than deleting it.\nNontraditional heirlooms (like the &lt;a href=\"Dread%20Pirate%20Ring\"&gt;Dread Pirate Ring&lt;/a&gt; or Garrosh weapons) are invisible in the heirlooms tab until acquired. Only the highest-difficulty Garrosh weapon will be visible in the UI if the player has the same item in multiple difficulty modes.\nNow-upgradeable heirlooms acquired before patch 6.1 were automatically added to the heirlooms tab at upgrade level 1/2 (effective up to level 90) regardless of whether or not they were actually upgraded, with the heirloom items themselves staying in the character's bags, bank, or void storage.\nHeirlooms with attributes that are no longer used (such as dodge or PvP resilience) were updated to provide another secondary stat (crit or haste).\nSources.\nAll-access.\nThe following vendors sell heirloom shoulders, chests, trinkets, necklaces, and weapons, and both sets of the heirloom upgrade tokens for gold:\nGuild vendors.\nGuild vendors sell heirloom helms, cloaks, and legs with guild reputation requirements. Helms and cloaks merely require honored guild reputation, while legs require being in a guild that has unlocked the &lt;a href=\"Working%20Better%20as%20a%20Team\"&gt;Working Better as a Team&lt;/a&gt; achievement:\nOther sources.\nBeyond the vendors, there are a few other sources of heirlooms:\nUpgrades.\nAs previously mentioned, heirlooms as sold by the vendors are effective from levels 1 to 60. Upgrade tokens are available for purchase to upgrade heirlooms to be effective up to level 90, 100, 110, and 120 respectively.\nDuring Timewalking Dungeon Events, the Timewalking Vendor sells upgrade tokens in exchange for Timewarped Badges.\nAdditionally, during holidays like &lt;a href=\"Love%20is%20in%20the%20Air\"&gt;Love is in the Air&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hallow%27s%20End\"&gt;Hallow's End&lt;/a&gt;, or the &lt;a href=\"Lunar%20Festival\"&gt;Lunar Festival&lt;/a&gt;, vendors tend to sell upgrade tokens in exchange for the event currency.\nCost.\nThere are currently 22 armor pieces, 16 weapons, and 13 off-hand and miscellaneous available to everyone. Additionally, being &lt;a href=\"Revered\"&gt;Revered&lt;/a&gt; with a guild grants access to 20 more armor pieces. Finally, there are 2 armor pieces, 3 weapons, and 17 off-hand and miscellaneous which are acquired through special means. One-handed weapons have a cheaper base cost, but upgrade costs are the same as two-handed. To max out each piece would cost the following:\nAchievements.\nThere are four achievements for learning heirlooms, with the last requiring 35 unique heirlooms learned. Upon unlocking the fourth achievement, players will receive a letter in the mail with a &lt;a href=\"Clinking%20Present\"&gt;Clinking Present&lt;/a&gt; attached. Inside the present is the &lt;a href=\"Chauffeured%20Chopper\"&gt;Chauffeured Chopper&lt;/a&gt;, a mount that can be used by players of all levels.\nStat values.\nAn heirloom's stats correspond to the &lt;a href=\"item%20level\"&gt;item level&lt;/a&gt; of a &lt;a href=\"Rare\"&gt;blue quality item&lt;/a&gt; requiring its wearer's level until the heirloom stops leveling, as specified by the tooltip. However, heirlooms give bonuses to four different stats from a far lower level than blue items start doing so. At level 100, heirlooms are equivalent to an item level 605 item, and will ultimately be replaced by questing, instancing, and PvP at the maximum level. The &lt;a href=\"%23Garrosh_weapons\"&gt;heirloom weapons&lt;/a&gt; that were dropped by &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; are instead equivalent to an item level 620 weapon at level 100.\nOn reaching levels 58, 68, 81, 86, and 91, players may notice unusually large increases to an heirloom's effective item level, because these are the lowest required levels for blues introduced in, respectively, the \"&lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;Wrath of the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Mists%20of%20Pandaria\"&gt;Mists of Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"&lt;a href=\"Warlords%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Warlords of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;\" expansions. However, since the &lt;a href=\"stat%20squish\"&gt;stat squish&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"patch%206.0.2\"&gt;patch 6.0.2&lt;/a&gt;, there are no longer large increases in heirloom power from these jumps in item level, except the jump that occurs at level 91 (reflecting the new \"Warlords of Draenor\" blue items).\nEnchanting your heirlooms.\nHeirlooms can be enchanted only with enhancements that will not bind the item to the character. All enchantments can be applied to heirloom items. High level enhancements applied to items equipped by low level players have their power scaled down to be similar to enhancements intended for that level range. Note that profession-specific enchantments still require the profession.\nNon-traditional heirlooms.\nHodir Shoulder Enchants.\nHeirloom shoulder &lt;a href=\"enchants\"&gt;enchants&lt;/a&gt; can be used at any level, but are only usable by level 30 characters and makes the heirloom soulbound. This is to allow for the use of these enchants without having to grind through the &lt;a href=\"reputation\"&gt;reputation&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Hodir\"&gt;Sons of Hodir&lt;/a&gt; with another character. \nNote that the Sons of Hodir heirloom items are only the \"highest level\" version of the item the faction vendor carries. For example, &lt;a href=\"Lesser%20Inscription%20of%20the%20Axe\"&gt;Lesser Inscription of the Axe&lt;/a&gt; is not an Heirloom and the name will not appear in the light blue color in the vendor's trade window.\nGarrosh weapons.\nFrom &lt;a href=\"patch%205.4\"&gt;patch 5.4&lt;/a&gt; to the launch of \"&lt;a href=\"Warlords%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Warlords of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;\", &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, the final boss of &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, dropped heirlooms for level 90-100 players. These heirlooms can no longer be acquired, and are invisible in the collections UI unless one of the heirlooms has already been learned. If players have multiple versions of the same item in different difficulty levels, only the highest-difficulty heirloom will be visible in the UI.\nThese weapons start at item levels of 556, 569, or 582, for the normal, heroic, and mythic versions respectively (flexible, normal, and heroic, before &lt;a href=\"patch%206.0.2\"&gt;patch 6.0.2&lt;/a&gt;). All 3 versions scale linearly to item level 620 at level 100, however, so the item level difference between the 3 versions decreases as a character approaches level 100. For example, at level 95, the weapons have item levels of 588, 595, and 601, respectively, which is a difference of 6-7 item levels, compared to the 13 item level difference at level 90.\nMythic dungeon trinkets.\n5 new trinket heirlooms were added in &lt;a href=\"patch%206.2.3\"&gt;patch 6.2.3&lt;/a&gt;, available to the launch of \"&lt;a href=\"Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt;\", having a chance to be rewarded to the player through &lt;a href=\"Personal%20loot\"&gt;Personal loot&lt;/a&gt; upon the defeat of the &lt;a href=\"Warlords%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Warlords of Draenor&lt;/a&gt; dungeon bosses on Mythic difficulty. These trinkets can only be used from levels 100-110.\nReputation commendations.\nSelect \"Mists of Pandaria\" factions have &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Commendation\"&gt;Grand Commendation&lt;/a&gt;s available for purchase that double the reputation gains with factions once their commendation has been purchased and used. In order to purchase a commendation, one character on the player's account must reach revered standing with that faction.\nThough technically heirlooms (they have the light blue color), commendations are &lt;a href=\"BoP\"&gt;BoP&lt;/a&gt; and should be consumed immediately after purchase."}

At an unknown point in time, he and &lt;a href=\"Rokhan\"&gt;Rokhan&lt;/a&gt; were part of a &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; scouting mission at &lt;a href=\"Blackfathom%20Deeps\"&gt;Blackfathom Deeps&lt;/a&gt;.

Named for their close kinship with Frostfire's native &lt;a href=\"frost%20wolf\"&gt;frost wolves&lt;/a&gt;, the clan placed great value in the noble ideals of family and community and sought to live in harmony with the land.\nDuring the formation of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt;, the Frostwolf chieftain &lt;a href=\"Durotan\"&gt;Durotan&lt;/a&gt; was one of the few to speak out against the growing corruption among the orcs and refused to participate in the drinking of the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20of%20Mannoroth\"&gt;Blood of Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; exiled the Frostwolves, who journeyed north to eventually find refuge in the frigid &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac Mountains&lt;/a&gt; and eke out an existence in &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Valley\"&gt;Alterac Valley&lt;/a&gt;.\nLater, Durotan and his mate &lt;a href=\"Draka\"&gt;Draka&lt;/a&gt; were assassinated by orcs loyal to Gul'dan, but their infant son &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Go'el&lt;/a&gt; was discovered by the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; noble &lt;a href=\"Aedelas%20Blackmoore\"&gt;Aedelas Blackmoore&lt;/a&gt;, who took the orc in and began raising him as a slave under the name \"Thrall\". Years later, Thrall discovered the truth of his origins and that he was the rightful heir of the Frostwolf clan, and would go on to reunite the defeated and scattered orc clans into a &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;new Horde&lt;/a&gt; before eventually leading them across the sea to &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. Under the leadership of the &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Drek%27Thar\"&gt;Drek'Thar&lt;/a&gt;, the Frostwolf clan chose to remain in Alterac, and are now locked in battle with the relic-seeking &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Stormpike%20Guard\"&gt;Stormpike Guard&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nRoughly 800 years before the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, some of the orcs who migrated out of &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Gorgrond&lt;/a&gt; settled in the bleak and icy region of &lt;a href=\"Frostfire%20Ridge\"&gt;Frostfire Ridge&lt;/a&gt;, among them the Frostwolves.\nThe Battle of Bladespire.\n11 years before the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, the Frostwolves were led by Chieftain &lt;a href=\"Garad\"&gt;Garad&lt;/a&gt;, who embodied the clan's noble ideals of family and community and believed that only by helping each other could the orcs survive in their harsh environment. He pressed his ideals of family and community on his three sons \u2014 &lt;a href=\"Fenris%20Wolfbrother\"&gt;Fenris&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ga%27nar\"&gt;Ga'nar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Durotan\"&gt;Durotan&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 but Fenris later left the Frostwolves to instead join the rivaling &lt;a href=\"Thunderlord%20clan\"&gt;Thunderlord clan&lt;/a&gt;, which he eventually rose to become the chieftain of. After Fenris' departure, Garad chose Durotan as his new heir apparent over the hotheaded Ga'nar, despite Ga'nar being the older of the two siblings. At some point, Ga'nar, Garad, and the warriors of the Frostwolf clan fought against the &lt;a href=\"Laughing%20Skull%20clan\"&gt;Laughing Skull clan&lt;/a&gt;.\nFor a number of months, tensions began to increase between the orc clans of Frostfire Ridge and the local &lt;a href=\"Bladespire%20clan\"&gt;Bladespire&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Imperator%20Kelgrok\"&gt;Imperator Kelgrok&lt;/a&gt;, troubled by the waning of ogre influence across Draenor, sought to retrain control of Frostfire and oversaw the creation of an army of half-orc, half-ogres known as the &lt;a href=\"Mok%27Nathal%20clan\"&gt;mok'nathal&lt;/a&gt;. The half-breeds formed the bulk of the Bladespire army as the ogres rampaged across Frostfire and seized large tracts of resource-rich land from the orcs. In response, Garad called upon the &lt;a href=\"Whiteclaw%20clan\"&gt;Whiteclaw&lt;/a&gt; and Thunderlord clans to unite with the Frostwolves against this new threat. Due to Fenris' influence, the Thunderlords rejected the call and instead dealt with the Bladespire in their own way, raiding settlements in the dead of night. The Whiteclaws, on the other hand, did join the Frostwolves, for whom they felt an affinity and with which they shared many customs and traditions. Garad was declared leader of the Frostwolf and Whiteclaw army and named Ga'nar and Durotan as his lieutenants. The orcs didn't win any decisive victories, but managed to capture several mok'nathal and their leader, &lt;a href=\"Leoroxx\"&gt;Leoroxx&lt;/a&gt;. Upon learning from Leoroxx that the mok'nathal were slaves rather than willing servants, Garad and the half-breed elder agreed to help each other destroy the Bladespire forever. Leoroxx returned to &lt;a href=\"Bladespire%20Hold\"&gt;Bladespire Hold&lt;/a&gt; and incited the mok'nathal to rebel against their masters while Garad and his army smashed into Bladespire Hold's outer defenses. The &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Bladespire\"&gt;Battle of Bladespire&lt;/a&gt; concluded with the allied orc and mok'nathal armies driving the ogres from their fortress, with Imperator Kelgrok having been strangled by Leoroxx in the heart of the burning fortress. However, hundreds of Frostwolves and Whiteclaws had perished in the battle, including Ga'nar. His death broke Garad's heart, and though Durotan remained to carry on the family line, the Frostwolf chieftain never recovered from the loss of his second son. Garad offered the mok'nathal land in Frostfire, but Leoroxx declined and chose to instead settle his people in a remote corner of Gorgrond, knowing the orcs would never truly accept half-breeds.\nThe next year, many orcs contracted the virulent &lt;a href=\"red%20pox\"&gt;red pox&lt;/a&gt; at one of the &lt;a href=\"Kosh%27harg\"&gt;Kosh'harg&lt;/a&gt; festivals in &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt;, including Garad. At the &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;'s urging, the plague bearers remained in Nagrand to construct a village to quarantine the affected. The thought of not returning home filled Garad with sorrow, but he did not wish to spread the pox to his family and clan members and instead agreed to remain in Nagrand, taking charge over his fellow plague victims. Durotan volunteered to stay behind with his father, but as he was the sole remaining heir to the clan Garad instead told him to return home and look after the Frostwolves for the time being. In a matter of weeks, the red pox consumed Garad, and the other pox victims named their village &lt;a href=\"Garadar\"&gt;Garadar&lt;/a&gt; in his honor.\nRise of the Horde.\n8 years before the First War, Chieftain Durotan, his mate &lt;a href=\"Draka\"&gt;Draka&lt;/a&gt; and the Frostwolf elder shaman &lt;a href=\"Drek%27Thar\"&gt;Drek'Thar&lt;/a&gt; were present at &lt;a href=\"Oshu%27gun\"&gt;Oshu'gun&lt;/a&gt; when Ner'zhul announced the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; as enemies of the orcs and where nearly every chieftain agreed to unite into a single Horde. Durotan felt conflicted about Ner'zhul's claim that the spirits had told him the draenei were planning to destroy the orcish race, but the Frostwolf chieftain was in no position to question the ancestral spirits. Additionally, other shaman, including Drek'Thar, revealed that they had received similar visions that confirmed Ner'zhul's claims. Two years later, the Whiteclaw chieftain &lt;a href=\"Zagrel\"&gt;Zagrel&lt;/a&gt; was assassinated under the orders of the &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; for speaking out against the Horde. Gul'dan feared that Zagrel could win the support of orcs who questioned the Horde, like Durotan and his Frostwolves. Durotan was already wary of the Horde's war against the draenei, and the Whiteclaw chieftain's death caused his unease to deepen, yet he had no proof of who had murdered Zagrel. The next year, Gul'dan called for a new meeting at Oshu'gun, where he revealed that the shaman of the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock clan&lt;/a&gt; had mastered a new power known as &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; magic after the elements had abandoned the orcs. Powerless shaman from all clans, including Drek'Thar, pleaded with the Blackrocks to share their fel secrets. Despite his suspicions about the fel, Durotan gave his permission to the shaman to study this new magic, as he would not allow his clan to be put in a place of weakness. Durotan also begrudgingly voted for the Blackrock chieftain &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; as the first &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; of the Horde along with the other chieftains, since he feared that his clan would face dire consequences from the Blackrocks if he were the only voice of dissent.\nShortly after his appointment as Warchief, Blackhand assigned specific roles to the various clans. The Frostwolves were among the clans that would make up the Horde's main fighting force, leading direct assaults on draenei settlements and forming the backbone of the orcish army. Shortly afterward, Blackhand sent his most powerful warlocks to the other orc clans in order to imbue adolescents with the strength and fury of adults. The thought of subjecting young Frostwolves to the warlocks' strange magics unsettled Durotan, but Blackhand had made it clear that anyone who opposed him would suffer, and the Frostwolf chieftain placed the safety of his clan above all else. Thus, he reluctantly allowed the warlocks to imbue his clan's youths with fel magic to transform them into hulking warriors. Durotan was also troubled by the fact that the orcs' brown skin had begun to slowly turn splotchy green, which he correctly suspected was due to the warlocks' magic. However, none of the other orcs were troubled by this physical change.\nTwo years later, Ner'zhul \u2014 a captive of Gul'dan \u2014 planted an anonymous missive to Durotan where he urged the Frostwolf chieftain to not follow Gul'dan's command at an upcoming clan gathering, or he and his people would suffer a fate worse than death. Durotan heeded the warning, and when the other orcs drank the &lt;a href=\"Blood-curse\"&gt;Blood of Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt; atop &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;a mountain&lt;/a&gt; near the &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Citadel\"&gt;Horde capital&lt;/a&gt;, the Frostwolf chieftain refused to participate and forbade his clan from drinking. Gul'dan was already suspicious of Durotan and was infuriated by his defiance, but could not afford killing him and upsetting the Frostwolves due to the impending assault on &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt;. With Gul'dan offering enslavement to the orcs just like &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; once did to the &lt;a href=\"eredar\"&gt;eredar&lt;/a&gt;, Durotan wondered if his clan would end up like &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Draenei\"&gt;exiled ones&lt;/a&gt;\" did.\nAfter Shattrath's fall, Warchief Blackhand tasked the Frostwolf, Whiteclaw and Thunderlord clans with wiping out Draenor's &lt;a href=\"gronn\"&gt;gronn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"ogron\"&gt;ogron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"magnaron\"&gt;magnaron&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the ogres that had refused to join the Horde. The Frostwolves and Whiteclaws saw no honor in hunting the giants down and held most of their warriors back, but the Thunderlords did not shy away from the task and reveled in the slaughter of their ancient enemies.\nBy the end of the &lt;a href=\"genocide%20of%20the%20draenei\"&gt;conflict&lt;/a&gt;, the Frostwolves were one of the smallest orc clans, now consisting of about eighty members. But Durotan's public refusal to drink the Blood of Mannoroth made his clan a clear target during the &lt;a href=\"Dying%20Time\"&gt;Dying Time&lt;/a&gt;, where disease and mass starvation threatened to destroy the orcs. The Frostwolves took the brunt of these attacks, with &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Hand%20clan\"&gt;Shattered Hand&lt;/a&gt; raiders attacking them for grain.\nDuring the construction of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, Blackhand staged mock battles and duels to prepare for the impending invasion of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Durotan saw this practice as a disgrace to tradition and began speaking out against Gul'dan and fel magic, urging the orcs to seek ways to heal their world. Most clans saw these actions as cowardly and treasonous and lashed out at the Frostwolves.\nThe First War and exile.\nDurotan brought the Frostwolf clan through the Dark Portal to Azeroth along with the rest of the clans, despite his disgust for the Horde's leadership. There was no future on the dying Draenor; only on Azeroth could the Frostwolves survive another generation. The clan initially fought against the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s alongside the other clans in the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, but Gul'dan later confronted Durotan in secret and informed him that his clan was no longer part of the Horde and had to leave the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Morass\"&gt;Black Morass&lt;/a&gt; immediately. If they ever returned or ever contacted any member of the Horde, Gul'dan promised to destroy every Frostwolf male, female, and child. Though loath to part from the other orcs, Durotan had recently learned that his mate Draka was pregnant, and he did not wish to risk her or their unborn child by testing Gul'dan's wrath. He also knew that Gul'dan was merely letting them live because, if Durotan were killed, it would make him a martyr and give his warnings weight among the rest of the Horde. The Frostwolves struck out north, but the journey was frightening, for the terrain was unfamiliar and the humans treated all orcs as enemies. However, the discovery of Azeroth's native and powerful &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt;s shook the former shaman Drek'Thar and reminded him of his abandoned heritage. He renounced his use of fel magic and asked the elements for aid, and in return the spirits showed him a path to remote, frost-lined mountains far to the north \u2014 a climate similar in some ways to Frostfire Ridge. The Frostwolves immediately set out to find these mountains.\nThe Frostwolves avoided almost all contact with humans thanks to the elements' aid. Shortly after the clan arrived at their new home, the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, Draka gave birth to a son whom she would name &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Go'el&lt;/a&gt;. However, to their horror, Durotan and Draka saw that their child's skin was green, proving that Gul'dan's pact with his masters had damned the orc race for all generations. Neither Durotan nor Draka could stand by any longer and do nothing about the dark forces controlling the Horde. They told the Frostwolves to remain in the mountains and carve out a new life while they and their son traveled south to reveal the truth to the Horde. Drek'Thar used his shamanic powers to send word to Durotan's old friend, the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock&lt;/a&gt; warrior &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt;, by causing the elemental spirits to whisper in his dreams and inform him that Durotan wished to meet at the edge of &lt;a href=\"Loch%20Modan\"&gt;Loch Modan&lt;/a&gt;. Orgrim had begun to distrust fel magic, Gul'dan, and Blackhand and viewed the banishment of the Frostwolf clan as further proof that the Horde's leadership was corrupt. Under the pretense of a scouting mission, Orgrim and a few trusted guards met with Durotan in Loch Modan, where the Frostwolf chieftain showed him Go'el and told him everything he knew about the Horde's corruption. Orgrim, in turn, told Durotan that the fel energies creeping through the Dark Portal had begun turning the land in the Black Morass &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;as dead as that of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;. Orgrim urged Durotan and Draka to take shelter in the north for the time being and sent his guards to accompany them home. However, the guards were secretly loyal to the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt; and decided that Gul'dan would want the Frostwolves dead. Several days into the journey, they attacked and killed Durotan and Draka, leaving the infant Go'el to die in the cold. A day later, a hunting party led by the human noble &lt;a href=\"Aedelas%20Blackmoore\"&gt;Aedelas Blackmoore&lt;/a&gt; discovered the grisly scene. Blackmoore decided to take Go'el \u2014 who was starving and freezing but still alive \u2014 back to &lt;a href=\"Durnholde%20Keep\"&gt;Durnholde Keep&lt;/a&gt; and have him examined.\nAfter Durotan's death, Drek'Thar became leader of the Frostwolves. Tucked away in a &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Valley\"&gt;hidden valley&lt;/a&gt; deep in the Alterac Mountains, the Frostwolf clan carved out a new home, isolating themselves from other orcs in the hopes of escaping the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;'s wrath. It was a harsh and lonely existence, but Drek'Thar had rekindled his connection with the elements and used them to keep his people safe. The clan's &lt;a href=\"frost%20wolf\"&gt;frost wolf&lt;/a&gt; companions established themselves in the valley, but the orcs also befriended the local &lt;a href=\"goat\"&gt;goat&lt;/a&gt;s. Although not as wise as the wolves, the goats willingly surrendered wool, milk, and sometimes even their life in return for the orcs' protection.\nRevitalization of the Horde.\nFor years, Blackmoore secretly raised the young Go'el \u2014 whom he named \"&lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;\" \u2014 as a gladiator slave within Durnholde. One day, Thrall escaped from the fortress and sought out the rest of his kind, eventually discovering the renegade &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20clan\"&gt;Warsong clan&lt;/a&gt;, whose chieftain \u2014 &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grommash Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 left a deep impression on the young orc. Seeking the truth of his own origins, Thrall then traveled north to find the legendary Frostwolf clan, from which he learned of the clan's exile and that he was the rightful son and heir of the late Chieftain Durotan. Under Drek'Thar's tutelage, Thrall studied the ancient shamanistic culture of his people, eventually becoming a powerful shaman and taking his place as chieftain of the Frostwolf clan. He soon set off to free the captive orc clans, eventually managing to liberate and unite them into a &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;new Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlterac Valley.\nAfter Thrall united the orc clans, the Frostwolves chose to remain in the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Valley\"&gt;valley&lt;/a&gt; they had for so long called home rather than join Warchief Thrall in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; (though Drek'Thar and &lt;a href=\"Nazgrel\"&gt;Nazgrel&lt;/a&gt; were both present in &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt; during Orgrimmar's construction). However, the Frostwolves' relative peace was soon challenged by the arrival of the &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarven&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Stormpike%20Guard\"&gt;Stormpike Expedition&lt;/a&gt;, who sought to mine and plumb Alterac's underexplored caves for relics and natural resources. Despite the dwarves' intentions, this caused them to come into conflict with the Frostwolves dwelling in the valley's southern reaches, and the orcs vowed to drive the interlopers from their lands. Opinions differed on who struck first and on whether the dwarves were peaceful explorers who were massaced by the orcs, or if they planned to poach and conquer.\nAccording to some &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; members, Alterac Valley was indeed rightful Frostwolf territory and the Stormpikes had simply arrived as peaceful visitors to search for ore and relics, but the Frostwolves had reacted with a cowardly, unnanounced attack, described as \"the most brutal and uncivilized act of aggression the Alliance has experienced\". The Stormpikes themselves, including their general &lt;a href=\"Vanndar%20Stormpike\"&gt;Vanndar Stormpike&lt;/a&gt;, considered the Frostwolves to be savages that were trying to halt the dwarves' sovereign and territorial \"imperialistic imperative\" of taking, culling, and turning Alterac for the &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;kingdom of Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;. They also claimed that the &lt;a href=\"Explorers%27%20League\"&gt;Explorers' League&lt;/a&gt; believed there to be artifacts in Alterac Valley, but that the Frostwolf orcs were stopping the dwarves' scholarly pursuits by not letting them explore the valley.\nThe Horde, on the other hand, stated that the \"favored clan of the Warchief\" were under attack from the \"nefarious Stormpike Guard\". They also claimed that regardless of any rumors, the Stormpike Expedition had invaded Frostwolf territory and that allowing an Alliance invasion of Horde lands without a forceful response could not be tolerated.\nCataclysm.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Shattering&lt;/a&gt;, the Stormpike dwarves joined forces with the &lt;a href=\"Bloodfang%20pack\"&gt;Bloodfang&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; and the Alliance and prepared to invade the &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt;, which had become predominantly Horde territory. After a set of Alliance battle plans were recovered, &lt;a href=\"High%20Warlord%20Cromush\"&gt;High Warlord Cromush&lt;/a&gt; quickly sent a Horde adventurer north to Alterac to enlist the aid of the Frostwolf clan. Word was sent ahead to Drek'Thar at &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20Keep\"&gt;Frostwolf Keep&lt;/a&gt;, and the shaman soon came to speak with the adventurer. Drek'Thar told the champion that during his life he had seen and done terrible things, but that he felt remorse for his crimes, unlike the Forsaken, who destroyed everything they touched and had killed countless innocents. According to Drek'Thar, none of the acts he had committed could ever be as terrible as lending aid to the Forsaken, and he vowed that the Frostwolf clan would never help the undead. Cromush was outraged by this defiance, but resolved to stop the Stormpikes without the clan's aid. After the Stormpike attack on Hillsbrad was repelled, Cromush stated that Warchief &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; would hear of the Frostwolves' treason.\nDragonflight.\nThe Frostwolf clan was one of the orcish clans in attendance at the first &lt;a href=\"Kosh%27harg\"&gt;Kosh'harg&lt;/a&gt; held on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Razor%20Hill\"&gt;Razor Hill&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the clan leaders gathered inside of the &lt;a href=\"Razor%20Hill%20Barracks\"&gt;Razor Hill Barracks&lt;/a&gt; to pitch their clan to prospective orcish recruits; Thrall highlighted the strength of the Frostwolf clan, their life-long &lt;a href=\"Frost%20wolf\"&gt;wolf&lt;/a&gt; companions, how they had hardy warriors and hunters, and hold a strong connection to the spirits of the elements and their ancestors. Upon the champion requesting to join the Frostwolf, Thrall expressed his pleasure. He subsequently instructed them with hunting, tracking, and killing &lt;a href=\"Gor%27krosh\"&gt;Gor'krosh&lt;/a&gt;, the Long Knives, without their armor, in order to test their skills in battle. Following their success, Thrall accepted the &lt;a href=\"%22Long%20Knife%22\"&gt;\"Long Knife\"&lt;/a&gt; as a trophy on behalf of the clan.\nCulture.\nOn Draenor, the proud members of the Frostwolf clan were exceptional fighters, but nonetheless lived in harmony with the land, believing that they should adapt to the environment rather than seeking to dominate it. The noble ideals of family and community were highly valued. The Frostwolves prided themselves on suppressing their rage and &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Fury\"&gt;bloodlust&lt;/a&gt;, for they knew that those who succumbed to the beast within became their own greatest enemy. Although they were traditionalists, the Frostwolves rejected certain practices, such as drowning weak or sickly infants.\nThe Frostwolf clan derived its symbol and name from its kinship with &lt;a href=\"Frostfire%20Ridge\"&gt;Frostfire Ridge&lt;/a&gt;'s native &lt;a href=\"frost%20wolf\"&gt;frost wolves&lt;/a&gt;, whom the orcs hunted alongside, befriended and even tamed as companions to fight and hunt together as an extended pack family. This practice, as well as many other customs and traditions, were shared with the neighboring &lt;a href=\"Whiteclaw%20clan\"&gt;Whiteclaw clan&lt;/a&gt;. In order to be granted full standing within the Frostwolf clan, each member had to undertake a solo quest to befriend and bond with a wild frostwolf. Not all clan members passed this trial, but those that did earned a lifelong companion. In life, no two creatures shared a stronger relationship than that of a Frostwolf orc and his or her companion wolf. The two ate, slept, and fought side by side until one or both died an honorable death. Even then, sometimes not even death itself could stop a frostwolf from coming to the aid of its beloved orc. A \"first-fang\" was the first of many shed by an adolescent frost wolf pup when their adult teeth began growing. Frostwolf orcs often kept the first-fang of their animal companion as good luck charms. The &lt;a href=\"choose\"&gt;choose&lt;/a&gt; is a Frostwolf ritual where a native wolf picks which orc to bond with for the rest of its life.\nWhen members of the Frostwolf clan came of age, they covered themselves in the blood of their first hunt, and rested their hands upon a &lt;a href=\"shamanstone\"&gt;shamanstone&lt;/a&gt; to honor the ancestors who came before them. As part of the rite of passage into adulthood, a Frostwolf orc had to slay a &lt;a href=\"boar\"&gt;frostboar&lt;/a&gt; and carve their family genealogy as far back as would fit on the creature's largest tusk. Family history and tradition were of great importance to the Frostwolf clan, so the largest frostboars were hunted each season to preserve clan lineage.\nWith Frostfire Ridge providing little vegetative nourishment, the Frostwolves depended on their hunters for sustenance. Snowshoes constructed of wolf bones and pelts helped keep trackers from sinking into deep drifts while pursuing prey. Together with their wolf companions, the orcs hunted the mighty &lt;a href=\"clefthoof\"&gt;clefthoof&lt;/a&gt;. Every winter, the clefthoof would migrate and the clan would follow. The clan spent a lot of time in Frostfire Ridge but migrated seasonally to &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt;.\nA special &lt;a href=\"Durotan%27s%20Battle%20Harness\"&gt;battle harness&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 crafted of heavy plate mail connected by chains and adorned with the image of two white wolves facing one another on its front \u2014 was passed down through eleven generations of Frostwolf chieftains, with &lt;a href=\"Durotan\"&gt;Durotan&lt;/a&gt; as its last wearer. The harness would have been passed down to Durotan's &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;son&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Durak\"&gt;grandson&lt;/a&gt;, but at some point it was lost to time.\nReputation.\nPlayers can earn &lt;a href=\"reputation\"&gt;reputation&lt;/a&gt; with the Frostwolf Clan by participating in the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Valley\"&gt;Alterac Valley&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"battleground\"&gt;battleground&lt;/a&gt;, completing various tasks and killing members of the &lt;a href=\"Stormpike%20Guard\"&gt;Stormpike Guard&lt;/a&gt;.\nReaching standing with the Frostwolf Clan is a requirement for &lt;a href=\"The%20Conqueror\"&gt;The Conqueror&lt;/a&gt;, which rewards the &lt;a href=\"Conqueror\"&gt;Conqueror&lt;/a&gt; title.\n&lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Valley%20rewards\"&gt;Various items&lt;/a&gt; can be purchased from and using &lt;a href=\"Mark%20of%20Honor\"&gt;Marks of Honor&lt;/a&gt;, but none of these items require any Frostwolf Clan reputation.\nIn Warcraft Adventures: Lord of the Clans.\nThe Frostwolf clan originally made its first appearance in the canceled \"\". Led by &lt;a href=\"Durotan\"&gt;Durotan&lt;/a&gt;, they were sent north to await orders that were never intended to arrive instead of being straight-up and officially exiled. In addition to &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and Durotan, &lt;a href=\"Drek%27Thar\"&gt;Drek'Thar&lt;/a&gt;, his son &lt;a href=\"Kal%27Thar\"&gt;Kal'Thar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nazgrel\"&gt;Nazgrel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Baelgun%20%28orc%29\"&gt;Baelgun&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zar%27gil\"&gt;Zar'gil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gath%27ras\"&gt;Gath'ras&lt;/a&gt; were members of the clan. \nThey lived in &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20Village\"&gt;Frostwolf Town&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Valley\"&gt;Frostwolf Settlement&lt;/a&gt; and it was shown that they did not disband their &lt;a href=\"Raider\"&gt;wolf rider corps&lt;/a&gt;, unlike the other clans of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt;."}

One of the smallest of the clans, the Frostwolves are known for their skill in the hunt, but take no joy in the suffering of their prey. They fight well and fully, but never do so out of rage or without reason, and will usually give up the fight when the other party yields. They do not take prisoners, or slaves, and dislike the practice. The Frostwolves did not hunt the &lt;a href=\"draenei%23Film%20universe\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;, and on one occasion had three Frostwolf children returned to them by the courageous outsiders. \nThe Frostwolves value strength and fitness, and once adolescence is reached the weak and the frail are exiled to an almost certain death alone in the snow wilderness. However, compared to the other clans, this is considered generous, as the exiled orc at least has a chance to earn their way back into the clan; whereas other orcs might simply drown sickly children at birth.\nThe last clan to accept the invitation of 's , under the leadership of the new chieftain , the Frostwolf clan traveled to the south where the Horde gathered at the . With more than a month of travel and hunger having taken a heavy toll on the clan, only a small selection of Frostwolves passed through the Dark Portal to Azeroth, notably including Durotan, and , with the rest remaining behind.\nFollowing Durotan's interrupted negotiations with the humans of Stormwind, those Frostwolf clan members who had traveled to Azeroth were exterminated on Gul'dan's orders. However, at least two are known to have survived, namely Orgrim, and the infant , with and missing in action.\nThe rest of the Frostwolf clan remain on Draenor, where they are led by Durotan's mother and Lorekeeper of the clan, . These include artisans and shamans, as well as the children, old and injured, none of whom were deemed fit to pass through with the Horde's first wave.\nHistory.\nDraenor.\nThe Frostwolf clan were nomads who would eventually make a home for themselves within the Frostfire Ridge. Legends states one Frostwolf chieftain felt so tied to the region that he could not bring himself to leave and yet didn't want to force his people to stay. As a such he requested the shaman to grant him an audience with the spirits and would fastened himself for three days and nights in order to commune within the spirits, who called him stubborn and created the &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Seat\"&gt;Stone Seat&lt;/a&gt;. From there on the Frostwolf clan would make a permanent home within Frostfire Ridge. The Frostwolves would also exile those they considered weak but should the exiled prove themselves strong they were allowed to return to the clan during Midsummer.\nBy the time rose to power, due to Draenor undergoing hardships (longer winters, short springs and summers, a shortage of game to hunt), the Frostwolves were led by who later accept to hear Gul'dan out after the later invoked the right of parlay. However Garad would be unmoved by Gul'dan's words and refused to join the and ended the parlay. In accordance with parlay tradition Gul'dan would give him a ceremonial dagger as a gift, but unknown to all the blade was poisoned. Sometime after Gul'dan departure the Frostwolves and would clash in battle and in his final moments the weakened Garad would realize that Gul'dan was responsible. The Frostwolves, ignorant of Gul'dan's role in Garad's death, would bury Garad according to tradition and then come under the leadership of his son .\nOver time the Red Walkers would grow bold and directly attack the Frostwolves but would be repelled and with the death of their hunting party the Red Walkers would retreat north. While leaving a few scouts to watch over the Frostwolves the Red Walkers would through unknown means take their strength from the spirits, all the while anticipating that the Frostwolves would come to their aid. The weakening of the spirits would prevent the likes of to hear their warnings and the clan would be caught off guard by the eruption of the volcano. While the bulk the clan would be spared, the Frostwolves would be forced to find a new home.\nIn this time of uncertainly Gul'dan would try to once again to gain Frostwolf support for the Horde and Durotan would be greatly tempted to join. However he ultimately rejected convinced that doing so would make them the warlock's slaves. A surprised would use the Draenei tongue to warn them that Gul'dan was dangerous, and (who had learned the tongue in her exile) informed her that they knew, though when Gul'dan demanded to know what was said Drake informed that warlock that Garona had called them fools. Accepting this Gul'dan then called Durotan stubborn but remarked that should he see wisdom and change his mind all he had to was head to Tanaan Jungle. While the likes of and Drek'thar would praise Durotan, other Frostwolves were in disagreement with rejecting the Horde and Durotan would be challenged by &lt;a href=\"Nokrar\"&gt;Nokrar&lt;/a&gt; and despite winning Durotan would refuse to kill arguing that too many Frostwolf lives had been lost. Nokrar, still convinced to join the Horde, would take his family and leave and Durotan would give chase to prevent the loss of Frostwolf lives. While Nokrar's family would be recovered Nokrar and the rest of his family would be killed and eaten by the Red Walkers, a fact that would horrify Durotan.\nSometime later the spirits would be able to get a message of sorts to Drek'Thar and Durotan decided to lead a party north to aid the spirits, while leaving Draka and Doomhammer in charge. With Durotan and his war party gone the opportunistic Red Walkers struck out against the Frostwolves in order to wound them and use them as a food supply. Unknown to the Red Walkers the weakened spirits still had enough energy to give one final gift to the Frostwolves and Durotan and his party rushed south and the Frostwolves under the command of Draka and Orgrim Doomhammer fought to kill their enemies. As a result Durotan would arrive in the midst of the fighting and the Red Walkers would ultimately be destroyed, and it's Chieftain would only live long enough to inform Durotan of how a once noble clan had fallen. While the Frostwolves wanted to leave their corpses rot, Durotan would order that the Red Walkers would be buried because despite their sins, they were still orcs and by them treating with respect the Frostwolves would remind themselves of what they never would become.\nThe war with the Red Walkers and hardships had taken a toll on the Frostwolves and in order to survive the the clan would march south and join the Horde. In order to survive the month-long trek, they would have to leave behind much of their belongings, including their many thick furs. , the clan's lorekeeper advised them to take what they could from Frostfire Ridge to remind them of their clan's heritage.\nAzeroth.\nUpon entering Azeroth the Frostwolves joined in the raiding parties, but refused to assault the human's defenseless settlements, seeing no honor in attacking those who could not defend themselves. As Gul'dan's fel magic began to sicken the land around them, Durotan, wishing the best for his son and his people, decided to work with the humans to stop Gul'dan. After spotting a human scout party sneaking away from the orc encampment, Durotan spoke to and persuaded her to arrange a meeting with the humans. \nThe clan met with King , and others, with Garona serving as translator, and informed them that Gul'dan would soon be ready to open the Portal, and that he must be stopped before he could accomplish this. Durotan asked the humans to attack the camp, allowing him time to tackle Gul'dan personally. In exchange, he grudgingly agreed that the Frostwolves would hold the Horde at bay while the humans gathered their forces.\nUnbeknownst to Durotan, Orgrim had been unable to stomach betraying his own people, and had told Gul'dan of Durotan's plans. As a result, the meeting was interrupted by an ambush by other members of the Horde, led by . The Frostwolves fled to defend their own camp, but on arriving were taken prisoner by the others, with some killed and put on display as a warning. Durotan was imprisoned, but freed by a repentant Orgrim, horrified at Gul'dan's actions following his revelation. As the others slaughtered the remaining members of the Frostwolf clan, Orgrim helped Draka to flee, taking with her the infant .\nThe next day, as Gul'dan prepared to open the Portal to Draenor, Durotan challenged the warlock to a . While Blackhand disputed his right to challenge Gul'dan, due to his status as \"ghost\", his clan having been destroyed, Gul'dan agreed to the match. While fairly evenly matched, the Great Gate soon began to form, and Gul'dan resorted to fel magic to quickly end the match, draining the life from Durotan. Rather than staying down, a dying Durotan rose to challenge Gul'dan one last time, forcing his attention away from the portal and highlighting his dishonor to the rest of the Horde. Angered, Gul'dan killed Durotan, although his use of magic sparked dissent among many of those gathered. Orgrim would later tear a tusk from his friend's jaw, with the intention of one day presenting to his son Go'el.\nDraka managed to escape the encampment, but was chased down and killed by the side of the river onto which she had launched her son Go'el, afloat in a basket. Go'el would later wash ashore, where he was discovered and rescued by the servant of an unknown human lord."}

It stood atop a tall spire within a vast chamber of ice, and was described as a diamond-hard block. At the end of the &lt;a href=\"Ascension%20of%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;Ascension of the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;King Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; entered the Throne Chamber, ascended the spire, shattered that ice with &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt; and made it into a much more literal throne. After the throne chamber collapsed and Arthas merged with Ner'zhul to become the new Lich King, he used the remnants of the Frozen Throne as the place from which he commanded the Scourge. While the Lich King slept, &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt; was built around the spire.\nHistory.\nThird War.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, a small band of &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; traveled to Northrend. When they finally reached Ner'zhul's icy fortress, embittered by the trials they had to suffer through, they had become dark and brooding. The Lich King offered them untold power in exchange for their services and loyalty, and they accepted to become &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s to his service.\nThe Frozen Throne.\n&lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; was charged by Kil'jaeden with destroying the Frozen Throne. To this end, he recovered the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Eye of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; and brought it to &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;. Illidan and his naga summoners used the eye, combined with Dalaran's natural magical energies, to create devastating earthquakes that would tear Icecrown apart. The intervention of his brother &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion&lt;/a&gt;, along with his former jailer &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Prince Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt;, stopped Illidan from completing his spell. Though he did not succeed in destroying the throne, Illidan's spell did rupture it. As a result, the Lich King began losing his power daily.\nFearing that Kil'jaeden would punish him for his failure, Illidan went to &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, but the demon lord quickly found him and commanded that he try again. Illidan led an army of &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; (led by &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Kael%27thas\"&gt;Prince Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; (led by &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Vashj\"&gt;Lady Vashj&lt;/a&gt;) to Icecrown in a bid to attack the throne directly.\nIllidan was ultimately defeated by &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;King Arthas&lt;/a&gt;, who ascended the spire and shattered the throne with &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt;. Arthas donned the &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Helm of Domination&lt;/a&gt;, which contained Ner'zhul's spirit, and they merged into the new Lich King. \"The Frozen Throne\" came to refer to the remnants of the crystal that Arthas physically sat upon as an actual throne.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, the Frozen Throne served as the final subzone of the &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt; raid, where the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; was encountered. The area was rebuilt into a much more complex and extreme form at some point after the Lich King ended his dormancy.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Highlord Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt; arrived at the top of Icecrown Citadel, they discovered the disfigured &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; suspended by chains above the Frozen Throne, where Lich King tortured him but could not break him.\nAfter the death of Arthas, the spirit of &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;King Terenas Menethil II&lt;/a&gt; warned that an uncontrolled Scourge would be all the more dangerous. Somebody would have to take Arthas's place. While Tirion was ready for this sacrifice and took up the &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Helm of Domination&lt;/a&gt;, Bolvar intervened, calling from his seat upon the Frozen Throne, his body warped by the &lt;a href=\"red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;'s fire and his mind scarred, he could never walk among the living as he once did. As a last act of service to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, Bolvar asked that Tirion place the Helm of Domination on his head. As the self-appointed \"Jailer of the Damned,\" Bolvar sought to keep the Scourge under control for the sake of Azeroth, and while he encased himself and the Frozen Throne once again in ice, he warned Tirion that no one could know what happened here. He then instructed Tirion to tell the world that the Lich King was dead \u2014 and that Bolvar Fordragon died with him.\nLegion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champion&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt; had to forge the &lt;a href=\"Blades%20of%20the%20Fallen%20Prince\"&gt;Blades of the Fallen Prince&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt; shard at the Frozen Throne.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nIn their quest to find the truth behind who whispered &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; when he chose Sylvanas as warchief of the Horde, Vol'jin's spirit and the Horde champion traveled to Icecrown to ask the Lich King if he knew anything about it. Following the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Pandaren\"&gt;new&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"allied%20race\"&gt;generation&lt;/a&gt; of death knights arose from here before &lt;a href=\"Darion%20Mograine\"&gt;Darion Mograine&lt;/a&gt; used his death gate to send them to the land of the living in order for them to choose their destiny.\nExploring Azeroth.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;war against the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, the brothers &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard\"&gt;Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; reported that the throne is waiting, empty.\nIn the RPG.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; sits on the Frozen Throne at the bottom of the rift, and his glory and power are terrible. Four &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Obelisk\"&gt;stone obelisks&lt;/a&gt; carved with &lt;a href=\"rune\"&gt;rune&lt;/a&gt;s of powerful &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; surround it. Bridges of pale blue, translucent energy stretch from the obelisk platforms to the Frozen Throne. Jets of frost periodically spew blue flames into the air, and there are glyphs carved into the rocky ground surrounding the Throne. Whoever wishes to enter the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20Chamber\"&gt;Throne Chamber&lt;/a&gt;, to risk the Lich King's wrath, must activate all four obelisks.\nDescriptions and speculation.\nThe exact description of the original throne chamber before its destruction has differed between sources. In \"Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne\", it was described and shown as lying within a frozen peak at the center of a valley in Icecrown. The RPG described the Frozen Throne as sitting at the bottom of a rift made upon its impact. The novel \"Arthas: Rise of the Lich King\" implies that the throne chamber was deep inside a cavern within the Icecrown Glacier itself, which sat in the middle of a valley.\nThe short story \"Road to Damnation\" doesn't make reference to the cavern or rift (although the \"very peak of Icecrown\" is mentioned), but instead describes the Frozen Throne as sitting inside a massive chamber inside a citadel. This could be a reference to the overall fortified nature of the throne chamber. Both Arthas and &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; were said to have traveled downward before ascending the spire.\nIn \"Wrath of the Lich King\", it seems as if the developers went with the original description from \"The Frozen Throne\". &lt;a href=\"Angrathar%20the%20Wrath%20Gate\"&gt;Angrathar the Wrath Gate&lt;/a&gt; appears to connect directly to the current Icecrown Citadel via a tunnel drilled through a mountain. This mountain is most likely what's left of the original frozen peak that housed the throne chamber, though it stands further south than it was implied to be before."}

However Fulmin was able to convince the Warlord to let him use the relic in battle and Gurthan agreed, though warned Fulmin was risking his life since the relic is unstable. With the relic successfully cutting off the connection from the Empress and the rest of the Mantid, Gurthan was noted to have smiled at the panic and pain shown by the mantid swarm.\nFulmin, once again, came to his master and showed him a way to house the Queen's remains after conquering the mantid. However, Gurthan was surprised to learn Fulmin had devised that a through an arcane spell, the mogu could trap the mantid queen's spirit in an urn which could then be called forth to show the other Mogu tribes of Gurthan's success against the Mantid. A pleased Gurthan remarked that Fulmin would receive more responsibilities in the future and then ordered him to teach him the spell, as he intended to crush the mantid that day.\nWhen the Mantid Empress was moved, as part of a plan by The Klaxxi, Gurthan ordered his warriors to attack the mantid and while others, like Fulmin, guarded the relic. As the &lt;a href=\"Klaxxi\"&gt;Klaxxi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kil%27ruk%20the%20Wind-Reaver\"&gt;Kil'ruk the Wind-Reaver&lt;/a&gt; decimated the Mogu that remained the Warlord ordered Fulmin to leave and safeguard the artifact in order to keep the mantid swarm docile. With his guards died and &lt;a href=\"Ninil%27ko%20the%20Bloodcaller\"&gt;Ninil'ko the Bloodcaller&lt;/a&gt; and the Wind-Reaver before him Gurthan decided to use the spell Fulmin taught him on himself to ensure that the mantid could not kill him. Sensing that his master had trapped himself in the urn Fulmin began to plan on how to crush the mantid and revive his master, he was ambushed and killed by the Bloodcaller and Wind-Reaver and the relic destroyed soon after."}

Her story starts with a young male &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elf&lt;/a&gt;, Rinn Firecaster, meeting the Forsaken Jillian Grell on her family's derelict farm in matters of business - she is supposed to buy a gem for her uncle, Barnabas. Before they get any further than introductions, they are ambushed by the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; led by Captain Renee Lauer. Both of them are promptly executed. \nTheir nearest relatives - Barnabas Grell and Reynah Firecaster - hear the news soon after, and both separately swear vengeance. The story then cuts to Reynah pleading with &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; for aid in destroying the Scarlet Crusade, but is denied audience by &lt;a href=\"Varimathras\"&gt;Varimathras&lt;/a&gt;. Varimathras says he'll relay the request when Sylvanas isn't busy with more important matters, and Reynah storms out of the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Quarter\"&gt;Royal Quarter&lt;/a&gt; crying, literally bumping into Barnabas - both are in a bad mood and promise to kill each other should they annoy one another again. Next, the Scarlets are shown to be grouping near an undefined lumbermill on the outskirts of &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt;. A few crusaders are laughing at a rumor that eating a pumpkin would turn someone in to an undead. Captain Lauer and another Crusader named Stefan are sparring in the background; while they fight, Stefan questions the Crusade's mission. Renee becomes enraged and overpowers him, but stops her sword right beside his neck. Her angry expression becomes a smile and she assures him that their cause is righteous. The next scene shows Reynah and Barnabas trying to capture a Scarlet scout for interrogation, but he escapes because they get in each other's way. They fight, then agree to a truce until they've captured Captain Lauer. \nThe Forsaken woman's story is briefly interrupted by the captive Crusader arguing with the &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarven&lt;/a&gt; captive. She resumes with the Crusader group, which is promptly attacked by Barnabas and Reynah. They successfully capture the Scarlet Captain after a brief fight. When Lauer awakens, she finds them arguing over who gets to finish her off. They fail to notice that the Crusaders have now regrouped and after another brief fight they are captured in turn. They are later questioned by Lauer, who wants to know why they attacked an overwhelming force so recklessly. They recount the stories of loss of their loved ones, and at this point Reynah and Barnabas find out their motivations were the same. Lauer ridicules both of them, saying they are both a disease upon the world that must be purged. Reynah, enraged, manages to utter a spell and kill a few of their captors, before they are subdued again. Stefan watches in horror as the captives are brutally slain, shortly before the Scarlet group is attacked by a horde of Forsaken led by Varimathras and Sylvanas themselves. Renee and Stefan try to escape, but they both are ultimately killed.\nThe captive Crusader asks the Forsaken woman how can she know all this, and accuses her of making it all up. She reveals that \"she\" is Renee Lauer, the &lt;a href=\"innkeeper\"&gt;innkeeper&lt;/a&gt; of Gallow's End Tavern, and Stefan was her nephew. The crusader recoils in disgust - he regards her now as not simply as an undead monstosity to be destroyed, but as a weak-minded traitor, a fellow crusader that has betrayed the ideals of the Scarlet Crusade. Lauer sighs and says she has told her story many times already, to numerous prisoners, and will keep telling it until people understand. The prisoner hasn't had anything to eat for quite some time and claims he can't hear any fairytales from the grumbling of his stomach; he asks if they plan to starve him to death. Lauer responds that she'll get him some &lt;a href=\"Fields%20of%20Grief%20%282%29\"&gt;fresh pumpkin&lt;/a&gt; to eat..."}

Bridenbrad's quest chain is cited by many players as one of the most moving stories in the game.\nBiography.\nThe quests offered concerning Crusader Bridenbrad do not reveal anything of his history before Icecrown, though all who know of him agree he was a great and brave champion of the Light. He was honored to serve alongside &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt;. He fought with the Crusade at the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Front\"&gt;Broken Front&lt;/a&gt; when it was attacked by the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, and was commended by Fordring for singlehandedly saving more than a dozen men from the carnage. Though Fordring wished to honor him for his valor, Bridenbrad chose to disappear into the mountains when he discovered he'd been infected with the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;Plague of Undeath&lt;/a&gt;, to avoid spreading it further. He does not fear death, but loathes the thought of becoming part of the Scourge.\nThe heroes sent by Fordring try and find a means to save Bridenbrad, resorting to asking for the help of &lt;a href=\"Keeper%20Remulos\"&gt;Keeper Remulos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;, and finally &lt;a href=\"A%27dal\"&gt;A'dal&lt;/a&gt;. A humble man, Bridenbrad is flattered by intervention from beings of such importance, though perhaps mildly perturbed to have so much attention and persistence applied for his benefit. His first thought upon meeting the heroes is to avoid infecting them or others with the plague, but he grows more comfortable with them and is eventually inspired by their actions of the \"great good left within this world\", easing his fears that \"darkness will prevail in his absence\". He is glad to have them by his side in his final moments, when he ultimately cannot be saved. Upon his passing, A'dal and his &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; take Bridenbrad's soul into the Light, ensuring his rescue from undeath and promising him \"paradise eternal\". By doing so, the naaru bound his soul to the realm of Light away from the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuest chain.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;# &lt;a href=\"A%20Tale%20of%20Valor\"&gt;A Tale of Valor&lt;/a&gt;\nQuotes.\nAfter the player tries to save him for a second time:\nExternal links.\n "}

The Crushridge ogres are cunning, massive and strong. Leftovers from the Second War, these ogres have thrown off orc rule for their own primitive ways. They live in Alterac City and kill whatever they can. They are cagey and surprisingly shrewd. Under Mug\u2019Thol\u2019s guidance, the Crushridge tribe has become a brutal and feared force in the Alterac Mountains. The tribe\u2019s combined might is formidable, and it relies on brute strength to attain its goals. The warriors of the tribe simply trample their enemies under a massive, raging charge. The tribe is easily roused to full battle. Keeping the tribal stronghold, protecting territory and finding food are the tribe\u2019s main concerns.\nThe Crushridge ogres are one of the most active of &lt;a href=\"Aretain%20Naris\"&gt;Aretain Naris&lt;/a&gt;' enemies, especially in winter, when they come down from the north and attack anything in their path. Aretain's reports portray them as a major threat (at best, an exaggeration), and Aretain promises to open the road to the &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands\"&gt;Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;. If any heroes visit them, the ogres will attack.\n&lt;a href=\"Gallow%27s%20Corner\"&gt;Gallow's Corner&lt;/a&gt;, which overlaps the road from &lt;a href=\"Tarren%20Mill\"&gt;Tarren Mill&lt;/a&gt; to the Plaguelands, is controlled by the Crushridge.\nSpeculation.\nIt is unclear whether the Crushridge ogres were previously from Mug'thol's &lt;a href=\"Stonemaul%20clan\"&gt;Stonemaul clan&lt;/a&gt; or a clan that Mug'thol took over."}

The &lt;a href=\"Cabal\"&gt;Cabal&lt;/a&gt; feeds him prisoners that have outlived their usefulness.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"A powerful demonic servant and acolyte of pain, Ambassador Hellmaw is dedicated to the art of death. He loves nothing more than the taste of a mortal's lifeblood tinged with horror and despair. Hellmaw is bound by the fel orcs of the Shadow Labyrinth and fed a constant stream of prisoners, bolstering the demon to serve the black will of his masters.\"\nStrategy.\nAfter killing the last of the ritualists Hellmaw will path one time around the room. He will stop where he initially was standing before the last mob was killed, then patrol up and down the northern most hallway indefinitely. It is best to pull the final ritualist far back to the southern entrance into the room. This will give you all the time you need to prepare for the final boss fight.\nFirst, have the &lt;a href=\"Main%20Tank\"&gt;Main Tank&lt;/a&gt; face him away from the party to minimize the effect of his corrosive acid. He fears fairly often, if the tank gets feared he may lose aggro, or the boss will follow him and hit other players with acid. A priest using &lt;a href=\"Fear%20Ward\"&gt;Fear Ward&lt;/a&gt; can prevent this, a shaman can drop &lt;a href=\"Tremor%20Totem\"&gt;Tremor Totem&lt;/a&gt;, otherwise the fear effect can be dispelled. Have someone keep track of time, so when there's 5 seconds left on the 25-second timer the healers can cast a couple of HoTs on the tank and move out of range, then get back and dispel if he is affected by fear.\nA warrior using Spell Reflection can also avoid the fear - it won't affect the boss, but the warrior won't be either. Warriors can also \"stance dance\", use berserker stance to avoid fear, paladins can bubble out. Another method is using a warlock's felhunter with devour magic.\nYou can also tank him in the tunnel leading to the room, so healers will not be feared out of the line of sight of the tank.\nNote that since &lt;a href=\"patch%202.3.0\"&gt;patch 2.3.0&lt;/a&gt;, mobs will often continue to attack feared tanks, making this encounters easier.\nHeroic.\nThis fight is all-over pretty easy even for inexperienced end-game players. The game goes just like before, though 2 healers might be a very good idea for this fight depending on your mana pool. After a few wipes we realized that Hellmaw in heroic mode was actually a timed encounter. An enrage ability activates if you don't kill the boss in maximum 3 minutes, pretty much like Mechano-Lord Capacitus in Mechanar Heroic Mode and one-shots every one by dealing over 30k damage on leather/cloth, 20k on mail and over 10-15k on plate. Heavy DPS is required in order not to wipe against this fairly easy boss. It is suggested to use all dump aggro abilities you might have like Soulshatter for warlocks or Invisibility for mages to keep steady DPS on him. Pulling aggro would result in possible death or losing precious seconds of DPS. Remember that resisting Hellmaw's fear might cause that person to die, it is suggested not to use any Shadow Resistance aura or Protection buff for this encounter.\nIf you have a Shaman with you, use &lt;a href=\"Tremor%20Totem\"&gt;Tremor Totem&lt;/a&gt;s and Bloodlust to ensure you have enough DPS to down him. If your group consists of casters, make sure they've got sufficient mana pots."}

The last boss between the players and &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Empress%20Shek%27zeer\"&gt;Grand Empress Shek'zeer&lt;/a&gt; provides an unorthodox battle which requires high raid awareness of both the boss' abilities and the abilities the players receive when changed into Mutated Constructs. \nBackground.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"Eager to please &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Empress%20Shek%27zeer\"&gt;his empress&lt;/a&gt;, Un'sok has produced several innovative concoctions. Yet this brilliant young &lt;a href=\"alchemist\"&gt;alchemist&lt;/a&gt;'s proximity to the mantid queen has allowed the &lt;a href=\"sha\"&gt;sha&lt;/a&gt;'s negative energies to take root in his mind. Now, Un'sok's overwhelming fear of failure drives him to create increasingly deadlier weapons.\"\nSpells and abilities.\nStage Two: Un'sok's Greatest Creation.\nWhen Un'sok reaches 70% remaining health, he calls forth a massive Amber Monstrosity to fight beside him. Un'sok continues to attack with his full arsenal of abilities from Stage One.\nStage Three: Un'sok Unleashed.\nUpon witnessing the destruction of his greatest creation, Un'sok channels power from the amber pools lining his chamber and prepares to make his final stand. Un'sok no longer uses Amber Scalpel, but now casts Reshape Life with greatly increased frequency.\nStrategy.\nStage 1.\nLet the tank charge in while the raid spreads out a few yards from each other. Un'sok will randomly target one player and begin channeling Amber Scalpel on it. The targeted player should kite it out of the raid and around the outside of the room. Several Living Amber oozes will spawn out of the beam trail and fixate on another random member of the raid. The living amber do not hit too hard, but should be killed fairly quickly to both lessen the healing load and spawn Burning Amber pools.\nAt the same time, Un'sok will cast Reshape Life on one of the tanks, turning that unit into a Mutated Construct. While converted, the player starts at 100% willpower and loses 2% every second. Should the player run out of willpower, it will die, and the construct will continue to attack the raid, uncontrolled. The construct has the following four controllable abilities, and one uncontrollable ability:\nWhile converted, the player is hostile to both Un'sok and the rest of the raid. Thus, the raid can attack the construct and the player controlling the construct can attack the boss. The construct will additionally cast Amber Explosion, which can be interrupted with Struggle for Control. If not interrupted, the explosion will do a huge amount of damage to the rest of the raid. Breaking free can only be used while below 20% health, so the raid must damage the construct below 20% health before the controlling player runs out of willpower.\nThe tank turned into a Mutated Construct should spam Amber Strike on the boss to place the stacking debuff on the boss, and should aim to Break Free just before the co-tank is turned into a Mutated Construct, therefore enabling the new Mutated Construct to maintain the debuff. As the Mutated Construct is also hostile towards the raid, the Construct must be careful not to accidentally target one of the other raid members.\nConsume Amber should \"not\" be used in this stage of the fight, as the Burning Amber pools should be kept for Stage 3 (where breaking players out of Constructs is not feasible). DPS should bring the Construct down to below 20% health as soon as possible to avoid such a situation from being necessary.\nIt should also be noted that the Mutated Construct can not act as a tank, as Un'sok's Destroy Will ability will quickly drain a Construct of all willpower.\nStage 2.\nAt 70% health, Un'sok will spawn the Amber Monstrosity (who needs to be quickly picked up by a tank) and put on his Amber Carapace, which absorbs 99% of all incoming damage. Un'sok keeps using all of his phase one abilities, but will instead target healers and DPS (instead of the tanks) for Reshape Life. The raid should continue to break out converted units while the Monstrosity is still alive. The Monstrosity has its own version of Amber Explosion, which does far more damage to the rest of the raid and can only be interrupted by a Construct's Amber Strike ability.\nThe Monstrosity's Fling ability appears to additionally reset its target's threat, thus necessitating a tank switch.\nThe Mutated Construct's role is similar to that of Stage 1 (use Amber Strike on the target, interrupt Amber Explosion with Struggle for Control, and Break Free when a new player is about to be reshaped into a Construct), although the target will be the Amber Monstrosity. There is no point in targeting Un'sok due to the 99% damage reduction, although the tank not on the Monstrosity should keep him occupied.\nThe Amber Monstrosity's Amber Explosion is significantly more damaging than the Mutated Construct's Amber Explosion. If a conflict between the two arises (due to GCD clashes), the Mutated Construct must prioritise interrupting the Amber Monstrosity's Amber Explosion with Amber Strike over the Construct's own Amber Explosion. The Construct should keep an eye on boss timers to ensure that Amber Strike is off cooldown when the Amber Monstrosity starts casting Amber Explosion.\nMutated Constructs should still avoid using Consume Amber as much as possible. Amber Scalpel will continue to annoy the raid during this stage.\nStage 3.\nWhen the Amber Monstrosity dies, the encounter enters its final phase. Un'sok will stop using Amber Scalpel, but starts using Reshape Life \"much\" more frequently. This is a burn phase, and the raid cannot spare any time or damage to free converted players from the constructs. Converted players should focus their attention on keeping their willpower up with Consume Amber (which is the primary reason for avoiding use of Consume Amber previously, to avoid running out of Amber Pools) and spam Amber Strike on Un'sok, stacking the damage taken debuff on him. Pop &lt;a href=\"Heroism\"&gt;Heroism&lt;/a&gt; and quickly work through Un'sok's remaining health.\nAlternate 10-man Normal Strategy.\nIf the raid has competent off-spec healers, it is possible to run with 2 tanks, 4-5 healers and 3-4 DPS.\nIn Phase 1, DPS should focus on the Amber Construct, and when it has been pushed to 20%, switch over to the Living Amber. Minimal DPS should be done on the boss, as this strategy is reliant on having the majority of the Amber Pools generated in Phase 1. It is recommended that the raid wait for at least 7 Amber Scalpels before pushing the boss into Phase 2.\nIn Phase 2, pop &lt;a href=\"Heroism\"&gt;Heroism&lt;/a&gt; to quickly free the tank trapped inside the Amber Construct. Once the tank is freed, any further Constructs should no longer be freed for the remainder of the encounter. DPS will need to prioritise killing Living Amber, then move to the Monstrosity; Constructs should spam the Monstrosity and eat the Amber Pools whenever low on willpower. If done correctly, there should be around three Constructs going into Phase 3.\nEveryone needs to focus on the boss in Phase 3. Tanks will need to chain cooldowns when there is only one healer (or no healers!) remaining.\nThis strategy requires a long Phase 1 to provide enough Amber Pools for the subsequent phases, but will result in a short Phase 2 and Phase 3 due to the army of Constructs placing extremely high stacks of the debuff on their targets. The increased number of healers is required to mitigate bad RNG turning too many healers into Constructs too soon. It is expected that the Constructs do the bulk of the damage dealt in Phases 2 and 3; consequently, it is important that the all raid members know how to play as a Construct and can handle control/interrupts perfectly.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

According to &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, it may have been destroyed by Malygos himself, in order to keep the magi from prying into his plans.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;war against the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, the brothers &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard\"&gt;Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; reported that the &lt;a href=\"red%20dragon\"&gt;red dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Surristrasz\"&gt;Surristrasz&lt;/a&gt;, stationed at Amber Ledge during the Nexus War, was still there keeping the younger red dragons that work with the Kirin Tor in line."}

It was occupied by the forces of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; who are friendly with the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. It was originally part of &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;kingdom of Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is made up of a &lt;a href=\"town%20hall\"&gt;town hall&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"stables\"&gt;stables&lt;/a&gt;, several mills, and a &lt;a href=\"lumber%20mill\"&gt;lumber mill&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Dalaran%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Dalaranian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"wizard\"&gt;wizard&lt;/a&gt;s lived and protected the inhabitants from the forest's dangers, however, the town was eventually taken by the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;. Following the final battle of the Silverpine Forest campaign, the area is inhabited by servitors once more, though the shield is gone.\nHistory.\nBefore the building of the &lt;a href=\"Greymane%20Wall\"&gt;Greymane Wall&lt;/a&gt;, Ambermill and the nearby &lt;a href=\"Pyrewood\"&gt;Pyrewood&lt;/a&gt; were owned by the Gilnean nobleman &lt;a href=\"Darius%20Crowley\"&gt;Darius Crowley&lt;/a&gt;. At the time of the &lt;a href=\"Scourging%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Scourging of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, the wall separated them from the rest of Gilneas when the doors were closed, causing Crowley to lead a civil war against &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; that became known at the &lt;a href=\"Northgate%20rebellion\"&gt;Northgate rebellion&lt;/a&gt;. \nPrior to the advent of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, Ambermill was a relatively unimportant site in the Silverpine Forest and was mainly used for &lt;a href=\"lumber\"&gt;lumber&lt;/a&gt; harvesting, but following the rampage of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; through the &lt;a href=\"northlands\"&gt;northlands&lt;/a&gt;, the rebuilding &lt;a href=\"wizard\"&gt;wizard&lt;/a&gt;s of Dalaran began to form plans for the strategic use of the town. According to &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Priest%20Allister\"&gt;Shadow Priest Allister&lt;/a&gt;, Ambermill remained a source of human opposition, mainly through the support they received from the wizards of Dalaran. Ambermill was located atop a dormant &lt;a href=\"ley%20line\"&gt;ley line&lt;/a&gt; energy node, the Kirin Tor attempted to reactivate the node for a large-scale project that was interrupted by the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;, as they feared to lose their hold on Silverpine Forest if that had been accomplished. The &lt;a href=\"Deathstalkers\"&gt;Deathstalkers&lt;/a&gt; learned from one of their prisoners that the wizards of the Kirin Tor at Ambermill have stored away important documents pertaining to the current state of Dalaran. &lt;a href=\"Mennet%20Carkad\"&gt;Mennet Carkad&lt;/a&gt; asked an adventuring rogue to obtain the documents.\n&lt;a href=\"Avelina%20Lilly\"&gt;Avelina Lilly&lt;/a&gt; provided her tailoring services to the wizards at Ambermill.\nAmbermill provided a safe haven for those Alliance adventurers traveling to the &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt; and beyond. The Forsaken desire to know why the Kirin Tor have occupied the town, and are just as eager to destroy it.\nCataclysm.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; conquered &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt;, the inhabitants of Ambermill shifted their entire town to a &lt;a href=\"pocket%20dimension\"&gt;pocket dimension&lt;/a&gt; to keep the Forsaken at bay. It is revealed that they were plotting to return to aid the Alliance in its invasion of Lordaeron when more reinforcements arrived.\nThe town was only accessible from a dimensional portal in &lt;a href=\"Beren%27s%20Peril\"&gt;Beren's Peril&lt;/a&gt; but it could only be entered by one person with a &lt;a href=\"%3ADalaran%20Archmage%27s%20Signet%20Ring\"&gt;:Dalaran Archmage's Signet Ring&lt;/a&gt;. Outside the pocket dimension, Ambermill magi created &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Servitor\"&gt;Elemental Servitor&lt;/a&gt;s to protect their territories from the Forsaken. One Horde adventurer entered the portal on behalf of &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; and killed many Ambermill magi and &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Ataeric\"&gt;Archmage Ataeric&lt;/a&gt;, the human responsible for keeping the pocket dimension active. With Ataeric killed, the town returned to Azeroth, leaving it open for the Forsaken to invade.\nIn the quest , the town is subsequently taken by the Forsaken as a part of a quest chain. The inhabitants who were slain, including Ataeric, were risen as Forsaken. The former residents of Ambermill, including Ataeric, appear during the final battle in Silverpine at the end of the Horde questing experience in that zone, contributing to a Forsaken victory and making it clear where their loyalties lie (for now) in undeath.\nIn the RPG.\nAmbermill is the only &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"settlement\"&gt;settlement&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Silverpine\"&gt;Silverpine&lt;/a&gt;, unless you count the &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt;-infested &lt;a href=\"Pyrewood\"&gt;Pyrewood&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Dalaran%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; soldiers protect the inhabitants from &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; and the forest's other dangers. Ambermill is a haven for the Dalaran &lt;a href=\"wizard\"&gt;wizard&lt;/a&gt;s who frequently survey the forest. The &lt;a href=\"Dead%20Wolf%20Inn\"&gt;Dead Wolf Inn&lt;/a&gt; serves a mean bowl of venison stew."}

Karlain attacked the worgen to rescue his son and Revil and Ambrose joined in the fray to support him. However, Ambrose died during the battle and they were too late in preventing Mardigan from being bitten by Gervase. After their foes were defeated, Karlain and Revil left the mine to bury the valiant and pious man. As they were digging a grave, a rabid Mardigan showed up in worgen form over the body of Ambrose but Karlain was able to subdue the worgen with his magic. After identifying Mardigan, Revil argued with Karlain to put Mardigan out of his misery and then went on to finish burying Ambrose's corpse into the grave."}

Our &lt;a href=\"Spy\"&gt;spies&lt;/a&gt; report that shortly after passing through the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac grasslands&lt;/a&gt; the Elves were ambushed by &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; troops. It is believed that these Elves are now being held in a small prison camp near the northwest region of &lt;a href=\"Tarren%20Mill\"&gt;Tarren Mill&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;Lord Terenas&lt;/a&gt;, fervently hoping to enlist the Elves into the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, has asked that you search for the missing warriors and deliver them to safety. The Elves have sent a cadre of Archers to assist in your quest. You will also be provided with plans to construct an &lt;a href=\"Lumber%20mill%23Elven%20lumber%20mill\"&gt;Elven Lumber Mill&lt;/a&gt; and the sylvan craftsman to operate it.\"\nBackground.\n&lt;a href=\"Milan\"&gt;Milan&lt;/a&gt; and his commander arrived at Tarren Mill with a stalwart group of footmen, and were greeted by elven archers who had already prepared the village for war. They had located their captured brethren to the northwest, and were armed and ready to seek revenge. The enemy camp was too far inland for their warships to assist, so they made preparations to march. They briefly considered training more soldiers for the raid, but the archers were eager to spill orcish blood and convinced them to strike at dawn.\nStill fatigued from yesterday's march, they gathered around the Circle of Power at first light and prepared their weapons. &lt;a href=\"Spy\"&gt;Spies&lt;/a&gt; reported that many of the orcs had spread out to plunder the surrounding area, leaving a minimal guard at their unorganized outpost. The Alliance force headed north and northwest in a tight group, wary of anything that moved. Startled orcs and trolls sent up war cries, but the Alliance force easily outnumbered them and slew them one at a time.\nThey then quickly returned through the village and headed west to approach the camp, the guards came howling out after them as expected. They lead them further south and killed those who did not turn back. This they repeated until all the guards had been dispatched; then they rushed the tower as a group. Before they had time to destroy it, a deep horn sounded an alarm, and they had very little time to break through a section of wall and get inside before the remaining orcs returned. Once inside, the archers tossed bows and quivers to the captives. They stood their ground until all was quiet.\nCold and bleeding, the victorious group returned to Tarren Mill and immediately sent word of their success. Not a single orc remained in the forest; enemy ships nearby were quickly sunk to prevent further problems. The reclusive elves of &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt; bade them farewell to return home. Milan wasn't certain if they would persuade their leaders to join the Alliance. The army then had but a single night's rest before an &lt;a href=\"Destroyer%23Elven%20destroyer\"&gt;elven destroyer&lt;/a&gt; arrived with orders to board ship and sail south, where the sounds of war were becoming commonplace.\nVideo.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

To govern these towns, Azshara placed &lt;a href=\"Athrikus%20Narassin\"&gt;Athrikus Narassin&lt;/a&gt;, an elf of considerable magical power who would spend most of his days in his &lt;a href=\"Tower%20of%20Althalaxx\"&gt;Tower of Althalaxx&lt;/a&gt;. His second, a mage known of his prowess in the arcane arts as much as with his physical abilities, was &lt;a href=\"Asterion\"&gt;Asterion&lt;/a&gt;, who lived among the people of Bashal'Aran, and went many times to Ameth'Aran to see to the needs and wants of its people. In its prime, the twin cities were graced by the blessing of the queen and were a sight to behold, with bazaars and temples to &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;final days&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Empire\"&gt;Kaldorei Empire&lt;/a&gt;, Ameth'Aran was already in ruins, its people clinging to the ground as though that might spare them from the destruction. It was then that Athrikus Narassin appeared to guide them to safety. Athrikus said he could protect his people with a spell, and then, all around him, the elves perished. They would have life eternal trapped within his soul gems, and have naught to fear from the sundering to come. Ameth'Aran was also &lt;a href=\"Anaya%20Dawnrunner\"&gt;Anaya Dawnrunner&lt;/a&gt;'s hometown and the place where she died.\nEventually, Bashal'Aran and Ameth'Aran were destroyed when the first &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; was shattered.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nThousands of years later, the ruins of Ameth'Aran were overrun with the restless &lt;a href=\"Ghost\"&gt;spirits&lt;/a&gt; of the Highborne that once dwelt within its walls. &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20Tysha%20Moonblade\"&gt;Sentinel Tysha Moonblade&lt;/a&gt; was sent to explore the ruins and came across with two &lt;a href=\"The%20Lay%20of%20Ameth%27Aran\"&gt;large&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"The%20Fall%20of%20Ameth%27Aran\"&gt;tablets&lt;/a&gt;, scrawled with the stories of Ameth'Aran and its fall. While she was reading the runes, she was accosted by the spirits, and fled. She sent an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; to the ruins to decipher the tablets in her place. Thanks to the traveler's help, Tysha was able to deliver a full report to the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; about Ameth'Aran's fall during the Sundering.\nSometime after, an adventurer managed to recover the seal imprisoning &lt;a href=\"Asterion\"&gt;Asterion&lt;/a&gt; in Bashal'aran from the &lt;a href=\"Deth%27ryll\"&gt;Deth'ryll&lt;/a&gt; satyr and went south to Ameth'Aran where it could be destroyed, finally freeing the ghostly elf from a life of torment.\n&lt;a href=\"Cerellean%20Whiteclaw\"&gt;Cerellean Whiteclaw&lt;/a&gt;, a night elven druid who survived the Sundering, sent adventurers to Ameth'Aran to destroy the spirit of his lover, Anaya Dawnrunner, in order to free her. Once done, the two lovers said farewell as Anaya's spirit faded away.\nCataclysm.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20of%20War\"&gt;Ancient of War&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Selenn\"&gt;Selenn&lt;/a&gt; was charged with guarding the ruins of Ameth'Aran. An adventurer, sent by &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, traveled to the ruins seeking Selenn's help into healing Darkshore. Before helping Malfurion though, Selenn had to protect Ameth'Aran from the &lt;a href=\"Enraged%20Earth%20Elemental\"&gt;Enraged Earth Elemental&lt;/a&gt;s that were threatening the ruins. Once dealt with them, Selenn realize that until Malfurion succeed in returning balance to the land, the elementals would not calm down so in a way, by helping the archdruid, he was fulfilling his task in protecting Ameth'Aran. Afterwards, the Ancient of War left the ruins to help Stormrage.\nBattle for Azeroth and aftermath.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Thorns\"&gt;War of the Thorns&lt;/a&gt;, mad &lt;a href=\"wisp\"&gt;wisp&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"ghost\"&gt;spirits&lt;/a&gt; took over the place and captured several &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;ish &lt;a href=\"grunt\"&gt;grunt&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; fighters. &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; adventurers were sent by &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; respectively to rescue their fallen comrades.\nLater, it was invaded by &lt;a href=\"Darkscale\"&gt;Darkscale&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; who sought to take advantage of the chaos during the Alliance and Horde's fighting. They looted the ruins and held soldiers prisoner. On the eastern edge of the ruins, against the &lt;a href=\"Felwood\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt; border, the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; was summoning &lt;a href=\"Granokk\"&gt;Granokk&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"earth%20elemental\"&gt;earth elemental&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome time after the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zekhan\"&gt;Zekhan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt; visited the ruins and found broken tablets strewn across the ruins. After sending rubbings of the tablets back to Orgrimmar to translate, and the tablet in question was Ilisara Ameth'Aran, or \"The Lay of Ameth'Aran.\" From the translation, they learned about its history. Zekhan ultimately noted that the twin cities are now nothing but dust."}

Posts had \"drop caps\" added, and several lines of melodramatic description added to their original content.\nThe javascript involved was fairly simple; a set of random generations produced the several pieces of text from a pre-set list. The title \"ArrPee\" was created inside the javascript, where every time a message was converted it was ran through a function called \"arrpee\", more specifically \"function arrpee(yeoldeposition)\". \nArrPee Forum Message Replacements.\nAll of the mad-lib style replacements below involved reformatting based on the character's class, gender, and realm. Further replacements were made whenever the text involved a \"target\", this target was then randomly generated from a list.\nMessage Introduction.\nOne of the following lines of text were added to the beginning of every user's message. The line is selected at random per message.\nMessage PrePend.\nOne of the following lines of text could be prepended before a forum message's sentence. If there were multiple lines to a forum message, one or more prepends could occur.\nMessage Conditionals.\nThe punctuation of each forum message's sentences were evaluated for the following conditionals. One of the following lines of text could be added to the end of a forum message's sentence. If there were multiple lines to a forum message, one or more additions could occur.\nMessage Append.\nOne of the following lines of text were added to the end of every user's message. The line is selected at random per message.\nIt is obvious the Blizzard web/community team had a good time putting this ArrPee event into motion. The CM's played along with the new forum text, and the web javascript code itself contained several mentions of the efforts being for \"The Lulz\", with comments reading \"//The Lulz. Do it for them.\" and \"//LULZ ARE GO\" and the naming of various code arrays like \"lolarray.\""}

The FOTM player is most likely your typical Trade chat beggar or anal joke spammer.\nExample: A FOTM player would roll a warlock, go 0/21/40 (Shadowbolt spam spec), and whine when the next patch drops his dps down to the 5th place. Immediately after he/she would start leveling a BM hunter, in hopes that a noob and easy rotation will bring him/her back to the top. Sadly for our friend, good hunters are scarce and hard to play, and after &lt;a href=\"3.0.8\"&gt;3.0.8&lt;/a&gt;, level 80 BM hunters became unheard of..\nNotes.\n- People with &lt;a href=\"altitis\"&gt;altitis&lt;/a&gt; are not FOTM rollers. FOTM rollers will most likely have a large array of alts, but only to move from one to another as the patches favor or gimp the different classes.\n- In WoW-related forums, FOTM rollers can be easily identified: most topics with a title similar to \"wuts moar powrful hunter or rouge\" or \"OMG BLIZZ NURFT MAI PALLI\" are FOTM rollers.\n- FOTM rollers are a type of &lt;a href=\"noob\"&gt;noob&lt;/a&gt;. In-game, they are your everyday damage meter spammers and duel braggers.\n- FOTM rollers seldom have decent gear or skills. At the first sign of aggression against their current class' obvious imbalance, they will reply \"it's because I play well\".\n- Some good examples of FOTM rollers are, until now (number.x refers to the patch they showed up in): 0/21/40 and SL/SL warlocks in 2.x, the first batch of 2.x Spriests, Exotic Pet BM Hunters in 3.x, Moonkin druids in 3.x and retadins in 3.x."}

His body was then taken by the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt; where his will would be broken and his spirit corrupted by &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;. He rose as the leader of the Four Horsemen.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nThe Four Horsemen stood in &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt; above Stratholme and oversaw &lt;a href=\"the%20Military%20Quarter\"&gt;the Military Quarter&lt;/a&gt;. They fought the champions of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt; assaulting the &lt;a href=\"necropolis\"&gt;necropolis&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Ashbringer.\n&lt;a href=\"Darion%20Mograine\"&gt;Darion Mograine&lt;/a&gt; also led a small party into &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt; in order to find his father. Following the whisperings of &lt;a href=\"Alexandros%20Mograine\"&gt;Alexandros&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Castillian\"&gt;Castillian&lt;/a&gt; teleported Darion's group in a trap where the Four Horsemen were waiting. &lt;a href=\"Brannigan%20Thundermaul\"&gt;Brannigan Thundermaul&lt;/a&gt; dismounted Zeliek and fought Korth'azz. While Alexandros battled his son Darion, Lady Blaumeux was defeated by &lt;a href=\"Grunn%27Holde\"&gt;Grunn'Holde&lt;/a&gt;, before being executed by Alexandros himself. Zeliek stroke at Brannigan's back, effectively killing him. Taking advantage of Castilian's spell, Darion cleft Korth'azz in two and killed his father with the &lt;a href=\"Ashbringer\"&gt;Ashbringer&lt;/a&gt;, which would thereafter hold the soul of Alexandros.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nDespite the first failure of &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt;, the necropolis rose once more, in the skies of &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; had returned along with his Horsemen. Alexandros Mograine, the greatest champion of the Scourge, was replaced with &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Rivendare\"&gt;Baron Rivendare&lt;/a&gt; as the new leader of the Horsemen. During the assault of the necropolis, they all fell under the attack of &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s.\nLegion.\nAfter the return of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; chose a new champion to lead the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Deathlord&lt;/a&gt;. The Deathlord found one of the three powerful, legendary &lt;a href=\"artifact\"&gt;artifact&lt;/a&gt; weapons suggested to him, after which he was ordered by &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar&lt;/a&gt; to create a new set of Four Horsemen.\nThe first Horseman is &lt;a href=\"Nazgrim\"&gt;Nazgrim&lt;/a&gt;. Buried near the front of &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, the Deathlord and &lt;a href=\"Thassarian\"&gt;Thassarian&lt;/a&gt; resurrect him. \nThe second Horseman is &lt;a href=\"Thoras%20Trollbane\"&gt;Thoras Trollbane&lt;/a&gt;. In order to access his body, the Ebon Blade had to deal with &lt;a href=\"Galen%20Trollbane\"&gt;Prince Galen&lt;/a&gt;. However, despite previous agreements, he refuses to let his father come back to life. The Deathlord executes him and takes &lt;a href=\"Trol%27kalar\"&gt;Trol'kalar&lt;/a&gt;. Finally, he resurrects Thoras and gives him back his sword. \nThe third Horseman is the former High Inquisitor of the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sally%20Whitemane\"&gt;Sally Whitemane&lt;/a&gt;. The Deathlord, Thassarian, and the Horsemen assault the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Monastery\"&gt;Scarlet Monastery&lt;/a&gt;, killing the last crusaders and reanimate some corpses. Finally, Sally Whitemane is resurrected by the Deathlord.\nIn order to resurrect &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt; as the final horseman, the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; mount an assault on &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt;. However, the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; on the sacred ground proves too strong and they are defeated. During the assault, &lt;a href=\"Darion%20Mograine\"&gt;Darion Mograine&lt;/a&gt; is killed. With his corpse returned to , the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; commends Darion's sacrifice and orders the Deathlord to raise him as the final horseman. The resurrected Darion follows in &lt;a href=\"Alexandros%20Mograine\"&gt;his father&lt;/a&gt;'s footsteps as the next leader of the Four Horsemen.\nCorrupted Ashbringer.\n\"The following section is a &lt;a href=\"Four%20Horsemen%23Corrupted%20Ashbringer\"&gt;part&lt;/a&gt; of the 's &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Corruption\"&gt;questline&lt;/a&gt;, a hidden cosmetic appearance for the &lt;a href=\"Ashbringer%20%28artifact%29\"&gt;Ashbringer&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Maxwell%20Tyrosus\"&gt;Maxwell Tyrosus&lt;/a&gt; together with the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Highlord&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; arrived to Acherus demanding an audience with the Four Horsemen. Darion angrily reminded the new wielder of his father's blade that they were not the only Highlord present before asking their reasoning for entering Acherus. Whitemane on the other hand wasn't interested about the reason for the paladins' arrival and asked the guards to escort them out before being interrupted by Nazgrim who, seeing the two paladins as honorable people, suggested that they let them explain themselves to which Trollbane agreed, saying that they could decide what to do with them after hearing them.\nThe Highlord of the Silver Hand then showed them the &lt;a href=\"Shard%20of%20Darkness\"&gt;Shard of Darkness&lt;/a&gt; which Darion thought only to be a myth. Darion, realizing the paladins' intentions was reluctant to help them until Maxwell reminded him and the other Horsemen that the death knights were indebted to the Order of the Silver Hand for attacking Light's Hope in an attempt to raise Tirion as one of theirs. The Horsemen agreed and Darion proclaimed that the Ashbringer would know their power once again.\nThe Horsemen then focused and channeled their power into the shard, turning it into the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Corruption\"&gt;Heart of Corruption&lt;/a&gt;. Darion told the Highlord that they were even now to which Maxwell responded by thanking Darion, and told the death knight that his father would be proud of him for agreeing to help them. Darion angrily asks Maxwell not to mention his father in his presence again before demanding the two paladins to leave Acherus and never return.\nLegionfall.\nThe Four Horsemen, with the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Deathlord&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Minerva%20Ravensorrow\"&gt;Minerva Ravensorrow&lt;/a&gt; mounted on &lt;a href=\"Daumyr\"&gt;Daumyr&lt;/a&gt;, battled demons on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nThroughout the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, The Horsemen acquired fallen champions of both the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; under the orders of the Lich King, and following its completion witnessed the new generation of death knights being raised.\nAs the &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"allied%20race\"&gt;allied race&lt;/a&gt;s can become death knights, the Four Horsemen appear at the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt;. Darion Mograine sends the new death knights to travel to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; if the death knight is &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; if it is &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and make a choice from the &lt;a href=\"Hero%27s%20Call%20Board\"&gt;Hero's Call Board&lt;/a&gt;.\nWe Ride Forth.\nBelieving that Bolvar had fallen to the powers of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, Darion Mograine attempted to kill him. However, Bolvar forcibly controlled the former's body and made him return to , while taunting him about requiring his fellow horsemen. Though wary of it being a trap, the horsemen agreed to kill the Lich King, and decide who would wield the &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Helm of Domination&lt;/a&gt; after Bolvar was slain.\nHowever, en route to &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, the Four Horsemen, using their connection to the Lich King, discovered him locked in combat with &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, and learned that this was all part of Bolvar's gambit to have the horsemen arrive and kill the winner of the conflict.\nThe Horsemen were stunned when Sylvanas won and destroyed the helm instead of claiming ownership of it. With the Scourge &lt;a href=\"Death%20Rising\"&gt;no longer under control&lt;/a&gt;, Darion ordered &lt;a href=\"Nazgrim\"&gt;Nazgrim&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sally%20Whitemane\"&gt;Sally Whitemane&lt;/a&gt; to rescue Bolvar, while he and &lt;a href=\"Thoras%20Trollbane\"&gt;Thoras Trollbane&lt;/a&gt; fought to keep Acherus under their control."}

Together they comprise the third and final encounter of the Deathknight wing of &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt;.\nGenerally regarded as one of the most difficult encounters of the original World of Warcraft, the coordination, timing, and relatively unforgiving nature makes them one of the hardest bosses in the instance.\nStrategies.\nThe Four Horsemen are a single-phase council encounter that depend entirely on proper positioning for each Horseman, as well as predetermined positioning, rotation, and responsibility for each raid member in order to properly manage the Horsemen's Marks and their unique abilities. \nFrom the mechanics of the Mark, each Horseman must be taken to a separate assigned corner, and tanked there. Whilst having one Mark stack up will do too much damage and kill you, it is possible to have all 4 marks stack to a lesser extent and survive. 4 stacks of Mark of Mograine (3000 damage) hurt a lot more than one stack of a Mark from each Horseman (no damage at all). The range of these marks is 70 yards, and with a 75 second duration, proper rotation timing is key.\nMarks.\nMarks are the signature ability of the Four Horsemen that shape the entire encounter. Each Horseman has its own mark, but these marks function identically to one another.\nThe mechanics are as follows:\nTanking.\nEight tanks are required for this encounter, two per Horseman. On pull, each Horseman should be picked up by its first tank and dragged to their assigned corner, where they will be tanked for the entire encounter. Tanks must rotate in and out from their assigned Horseman, otherwise they will die from the Mark stacking too high. A second tank must be ready to taunt off the first tank as soon as the Mark reaches a fatal number of stacks. \nAs &lt;a href=\"Taunt%20%28warrior%20ability%29\"&gt;Taunt (warrior ability)&lt;/a&gt; is considered a spell, tanks may want to consider some form of spell hit to counter taunt's resist chance (16% vs. bosses). Warrior tanks should prioritize Tier 3 for its 4-set bonus (+5% hit on taunt). Both tanks and healers should otherwise be prepared for taunt resists, especially if it resists twice in a row. Following proper strategy otherwise, taunt resists are generally the cause of wipes on this encounter.\nLoot.\nWhile some had speculated that the Four Horsemen's loot tables were generated in similar fashion to the &lt;a href=\"Silithid%20Royalty\"&gt;Silithid Royalty&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Temple of Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt;, with the kill order determining the loot awarded, repeated kills have now indicated that the kill order does not affect the loot. In addition to their non-set drops, the Four Horsemen also drop two &lt;a href=\"Tier%203\"&gt;Tier 3&lt;/a&gt; chest tokens. \nQuotes.\nConversation.\nWhen players pass beyond &lt;a href=\"Gothik%20the%20Harvester\"&gt;Gothik the Harvester&lt;/a&gt;, the Four Horsemen have a sort of conversation during which they are all introduced."}

Each horseman will periodically Mark anybody within 45 feet with a debuff that causes more damage each time it stacks. If nobody is in range, the horseman will AOE the room and the raid will wipe.\nMost strategies involve keeping all four horsemen occupied, while moving tanks and DPS between the bosses so that no player stacks more than three marks from any one horseman.\n25-man Abilities.\nThe Four Horsemen each have approximately 2,370,000 hit points. They will run into separate corners of the room when engaged.\nNote: Thane Korth'azz and Baron Rivendare will both cast their marks in unison, while Lady Blaumeux and Sir Zeliek will both cast their marks in unison. Because of Lady Blaumeux and Sir Zeliek's lower casting frequency, it is completely possible for their Mark debuffs to wear off and reset the stack counter.\nAfter 100 marks have been cast the Horsemen will berserker enrage increasing all damage done by 1,000%.

She will run into the far left corner of the room when engaged.\nSir Zeliek.\nA former paladin turned Death Knight. Ranged Combatant. He will run into the far right corner of the room when engaged.\n25-man Strategy.\nThis encounter is a lot simpler than it seems. You will need two tanks.\nThe Horsemen will automatically run to their corners, the raid will split into four groups one for each Horseman. The Zeliek and Blaumeux healers can remain in the middle without taking mark stacks and heal their 'tanks'.\nDepending on what you find more difficult to heal you can switch the healers around but unless you are bringing 8 healers some groups will have to be covered by one healer.\nEach group will run to their Horseman. The Korth'azz and Rivendare groups should stack up on their tank. The Zeliek and Blaumeux groups should be at max range in between Zeliek and Blaumeux. Every three marks the Korth'azz and Rivendare groups will switch places and the Zeliek and Blaumeux groups will switch places.\nThe Korth'azz and Rivendare tanks should drag their Horseman to near the door where you enter and taunt off each other, then drag their new Horseman back to their corner. Because of Meteor both groups will need to remain stacked on their tank. Another alternate more dps-efficient strategy is to wait for three marks and a meteor before switching, eliminating the need for the dps and healers on the melee bosses to move at all. \nThe Zeliek and Blaumeux ranged tanks should start running for each other's position as soon as the third mark goes off.\nAfter Korth'azz and Rivendare are dead their groups will switch to Zeliek and Blaumeux, remember to stay spread out on Zeliek and be careful of Void Zones on Blaumeux. You will still need to switch sides every 3 marks. Keep in mind they will target the closest player to them with their nukes.\nAll the tanks except Korth'azz's will take a lot of damage in this encounter, be prepared.\n10-man Strategy.\nThe encounter is like the 25man. You will need two tanks.\nThe Horsemen will automatically run to their corners, the raid will split into three groups.\nEach group will run to their Horseman. The Korth'azz group should stack up on their tank. With Baron Rivendare ranged and the healer can easily outrange his aura to ease the stress on healers. Every three marks the Korth'azz and Rivendare tanks will switch Horsemen and the healer and ranged dps tanking Zeliek and Blaumeux will switch places.\nThe Korth'azz and Rivendare tanks should drag their Horseman to near the door where you enter and taunt off each other, then drag their new Horseman back to their corner. Because of Meteor both groups will need to stack on their tank during the swap. Another alternate more dps-efficient strategy is to wait for three marks and a meteor before switching, eliminating the need for the dps and healers on the melee bosses to move at all.\nThe Zeliek and Blaumeux tanks should start running for each other's position as soon as the third mark goes off. \nAfter Korth'azz and Rivendare are dead their groups will switch to Zeliek and Blaumeux, remember to stay spread out on Zeliek and be careful of Void Zones on Blaumeux. You will still need to switch sides every 3 marks. Keep in mind they will target the closest player to them with their nukes. Their nuke is however really weak and can be dealt with easily with any healer class.\nIn 10-man only the group tanking Korth'azz will be taking heavy damage.\nEasy 10-man Strategy.\nNeed: 2 tanks, 3 healers (tested with 3, probably 2 possible too), at least 1 caster dps, preferably with self-healing abilities. \nWhy / when to use: when your party dies from taking too much mark damage. This tactic will put fewer marks on the DPS(@ switch from 3 to 3-and-1 instead of from 3 to 4-and-1) and migrate damage a bit more to the tanks (meteor, marks) instead of party, so in most cases it will become easier to heal.\nHow it works:\nAll 4 horsemen will run to a corner, where they need to be tanked. The key in this fight is that you need to switch tanking targets after each few marks, or the stacking damage from the marks gets too big. You need to split up raid into groups, and let them stick in a corner.\nWhen the encounter starts, all groups start getting aggro on the bosses in their corner. BLUE group goes all out on Korth'azz, with skills, cooldowns, etc. He needs to be down fast because of the meteor. RED group will tank Rivendare and stay alive. YELLOW tanks the ranged boss in the west corner and heals itself and the green ranged tank. GREEN tanks its ranged boss.\nNow comes the switch. At the moment the 3rd mark hits, YELLOW and GREEN need to switch. They do this simply by running to the others position, because the boss will target the closest person. Now they start to tank the other boss and stack 3 other marks. Switch again after 3.\nAfter the 3rd mark hits, the RED and BLUE tank move towards each other, so they can switch targets with taunt, before mark 4. Then move back to your old corner. Start DPS/tanking/healing again. Switch every other 3 marks. Repeat till Kor is dead, then move to Riv, followed by Blau, then Zel. Congrats! \nNOTES\nCLASS NOTES\nRemember to coordinate with the other tank, move to each other after mark 3, taunt quickly, move back fast. Don't forget that marks lower threat by 50%.\nYellow heal yourself and green. Red heal yourself and red tank. Blue heal yourself and blue tank and DPS (AoE heals). \nNuke Korth'azz, save skills and CDs for Rivendare. Don\u2019t walk along with the tanks or you may get an extra mark.\nZerg Strategy.\nIt helps to have a shaman in group for Bloodlust/Heroism, as well as the raid having high DPS output. The setup is exactly the same as above, except instead of splitting the DPS between Korth'azz and Rivendare, all of the DPS group up with the tank for Korth'azz. It also helps for both range tanks to be able to heal themselves, so that the maximum number of DPS can be on Korth'azz. \nAs soon as the encounter begins, all CD's and heroism are popped to take Korth'azz down as fast as possible. Having a good AoE healer in group helps, as you will more than likely get close to 5 marks of his debuff. If you are having problems with one of the healers dying during this process, you can have only the healers switch in between meteor casts at about 2 or 3 stacks of the debuff.\nAs soon as Korth'azz is down, the DPS / Healer / Tank who were on him run over to Rivendare's corner and engage him, while the other tank (and healer if he has marks) move to Korth'azz's corner to remove marks. DPS and healers can stay at max range on Rivendare to avoid marks, or just step out of range at 3-4 ticks until marks are removed. The only rotation of players needed is for the tanks (and possibly healers) to switch when 3-4 marks are reached until Rivendare is down. If the debuff becomes a problem for DPS (too many are dying), the DPS can just follow the tank to Korth'azz's corner until the marks are removed.\nOnce Rivendare is down, the DPS helps finish off Zeliek and Blaumeux, again staying at max range or rotating to avoid marks.\nDistracting Shot Strategy.\nAnother possible alternative to this encounter is for a hunter to use Distracting Shot on their tank's new target, then allow their tank to taunt off of them. Obviously this strategy only works when there is one or more hunter in the group.\nBeacon of Light 2-Healer Strategy.\nA slight variation to the 10-man strategy above is using a Holy Paladin to heal the front and another healer for the back. With the change to Beacon of Light in 3.2 (i.e. 60 yard range and over-healing being applied to the Beacon target), it is possible to cast Beacon on the single tank in the front and heal the rest of the group normally. Whenever the tanks swap, also swap the Beacon target. When using this approach, be sure to carefully calibrate the range between the two groups, as the single tank can get out of range easily. A range-displaying addon may prove helpful when using this approach.\nQuotes.\nConversation.\nWhen players pass beyond &lt;a href=\"Gothik%20the%20Harvester\"&gt;Gothik the Harvester&lt;/a&gt;, the Four Horsemen have a sort of conversation during which they are all introduced.\nInspiration.\nThey were originally based on the from the , said to bring the end of the world \u2014 Zeliek as the White Rider of Conquest, Rivendare / Mograine as the Red Rider of War, Blaumeux as the Black Rider of Famine, and Korth'azz as the Pale Rider of Death.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}
