The city resembles a massive totem, towering into the sky. The totem overlooks the expansive and awe-insipring landscape of Highmountain. Much of the city stretches out beyond the totem, camps fabricated on cliff faces and bluffs are all connected by wooden bridges to the city center. Established hundreds of years ago, the city ties a coalition between the major factions of Highmountain. &lt;a href=\"Mayla%20Highmountain\"&gt;Mayla Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; just recently became leader of the Highmountain tauren due to her father's unexpected death when &lt;a href=\"Dargrul\"&gt;Dargrul&lt;/a&gt; struck him down with the mighty Hammer of Khaz'goroth and stole it.\nHistory.\nCenturies ago, Highmountain was the home of four large tribes. The &lt;a href=\"Rivermane%20tribe\"&gt;Rivermane&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Skyhorn%20tribe\"&gt;Skyhorn&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Bloodtotem%20tribe\"&gt;Bloodtotem&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20Tribe\"&gt;Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; tribes. For ages they lived independently often with a quarrelsome relationship. However, when the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; invaded during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Huln%20Highmountain\"&gt;Huln Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; united these three tribes to fight a common enemy. This coalition would last for centuries, and for a long time Thunder Totem was the heart of the Highmountain tauren. All three tribes have lived in unity, each sharing a path into the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Chieftains\"&gt;Hall of Chieftains&lt;/a&gt; and each sharing an animal on the totem. \nHowever, the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; has severed the salient pact between the Highmountain tauren. &lt;a href=\"Dargrul\"&gt;Dargrul&lt;/a&gt;, king of the &lt;a href=\"Drogbar\"&gt;Drogbar&lt;/a&gt; has stolen the &lt;a href=\"Hammer%20of%20Khaz%27goroth\"&gt;Hammer of Khaz'goroth&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Hammer%27s%20Cradle\"&gt;Hammer's Cradle&lt;/a&gt; in Thunder Totem and killed the Highmountain leader. The Bloodtotem tribe has joined the Burning Legion, and the Rivermane tribe has been driven from their home. \nFollowing the end of the third invasion of the Burning Legion, parts of the city were turned into a small Horde capital, including &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"monk%20trainers\"&gt;monk trainers&lt;/a&gt;. Survivors of the Bloodtotem tribe who didn't chose to join the Legion also settled at Thunder Totem.\nGeography.\nThunder Totem is nestled against a large cliff face in the central valley of Highmountain. It is a large tent with a platform perched atop a great bluff, the totem being the crown jewel. The weather here is usually crisp and breezy, clouds are never in sight, even at night.\nThe entirety of Thunder Totem is comprised of many small camps and settlements all centered around the main bluff. A settlement to the north provides access to Thunder Totem from &lt;a href=\"Pinerock%20Basin\"&gt;Pinerock Basin&lt;/a&gt;. A large path to the east connects directly to &lt;a href=\"Snowblind%20Mesa\"&gt;Snowblind Mesa&lt;/a&gt;. And a path to the south connects to the &lt;a href=\"Path%20of%20Huln\"&gt;Path of Huln&lt;/a&gt;. The main platform is a large circle coverd by a tent. This is where most of the merchants set up shop and sell their goods.\nThunder Totem, the bluff itself contains two central chambers, the &lt;a href=\"Hammer%27s%20Cradle\"&gt;Hammer's Cradle&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Chieftains\"&gt;Hall of Chieftains&lt;/a&gt;. Two elevators travel down to the Hall of Cheftains from the platform and three halls link the Hall of Chieftains to the outside. The &lt;a href=\"Path%20of%20Earth\"&gt;Path of Earth&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Path%20of%20Sky\"&gt;Path of Sky&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Path%20of%20Water\"&gt;Path of Water&lt;/a&gt;. "}

Teeth and ears of victims form a crude necklace around the beast\u2019s neck, and it holds a sharpened tree as a massive club in its right hand. The creature grins wickedly as it begins to chant in an unearthly voice. Thunder bringers are rare, elite and powerful &lt;a href=\"magnataur\"&gt;magnataur&lt;/a&gt;. While &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;s are not uncommon among magnataur, few undergo the appropriate rituals that transform them from simple magnataur shamans to thunder bringers. Those who do rarely survive long. Thunder bringers represent the elite few who have survived years of assassination attempts and continued to grow in power and prominence over time. In addition to their great spellcasting abilities, they are also some of the largest and strongest of magnataur, making them even more formidable adversaries.\nMagnataur thunder bringers prefer to allow weaker magnataur to enter the fray first and support them with spells, retreating if the battle goes badly. If confronted on their own, they cast as many enhancement spells as they can before wading into melee. If they are preparing to attack an unaware target, they cast all their augmentation spells beforehand, then sneak up on their enemies to try to gain the advantage of surprise."}
{"id": "15685", "revid": "49468635", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=15685", "title": "Thunder lizard", "text": "Thunder lizards are large, heavy-set beasts that prefer canyons, plains, jungles, and forests. When in combat, they are capable of shooting lightning from their mouth at distance and dole out harsh headbutts at close range. Thunder lizards come in a wide variety of colors, including black, blue, gray, pink, and red. They can be found in the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Desolace\"&gt;Desolace&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vol%27dun\"&gt;Vol'dun&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Waking%20Shores\"&gt;Waking Shores&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnlike most reptiles, thunder lizards have a herd mentality akin to that of &lt;a href=\"Cow\"&gt;cattle&lt;/a&gt;, so most of them tend to stay together. Their minds are usually focused on one of three things: eating, drinking, or sleeping. In addition to running very fast, those activities are generally all that occupy a thunder lizard's mind, except during mating season. They are as such either docile or stampeding, not having much of a middle ground between them. Thunder lizards are grazing animals, feeding on grass and other plants. They also enjoy fish if they get the opportunity, the thunder lizards of the dragon isles particularly like piranhas. They like to make their beddings out of grass.\nIt is said that some rare kodos are bound to the spirits of the sky and storm. Thus, the tauren have legends about those they call lightning lizards, thunder lizards, and storm walkers. Whether or not these behemoths actually have supernatural powers remains to be seen.\n&lt;a href=\"Vol%27dun\"&gt;Vol'dun&lt;/a&gt; was once a lush jungle and the home of many great and powerful thunder lizards. Now their bones rest around the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Akunda\"&gt;Temple of Akunda&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Maruuk%20Centaur\"&gt;Maruuk Centaur&lt;/a&gt; make thunder lizard tenders, which residual electricity tingles the tongue.\nFighting thunder lizards.\nAttacks which interrupt the spellcasting of NPCs such as the rogue's &lt;a href=\"Kick\"&gt;Kick&lt;/a&gt;, the shaman's &lt;a href=\"Earth%20Shock\"&gt;Earth Shock&lt;/a&gt;, and the warrior's &lt;a href=\"Shield%20Bash%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Shield Bash (Classic)&lt;/a&gt; are also effective against these lizards. When you see the lightning building up in its mouth, hit it with the counter to casting used by your class and you won't have to worry about getting hit by any lightning bolts... you'll only have to worry about being trampled, gored, or crushed by a huge and irate reptile.\nThunder Lizards are hostile, whereas kodos are neutral, and will not aggro unless attacked.\nAs a hunter pet.\nThunder lizards are tamable by &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s as part of the &lt;a href=\"Scalehide\"&gt;Scalehide&lt;/a&gt; family, along with &lt;a href=\"ankylodon\"&gt;ankylodon&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"mushan\"&gt;mushan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"kodo\"&gt;kodo&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"stegodon\"&gt;stegodon&lt;/a&gt;s.\nIn Warcraft III.\nIn ', thunder lizards appeared in a variety of forms, including storm wyrms and lightning lizards. Rather than shooting lightning from their horns, they shot it from their mouths. The salamanders and thunder lizards looked very similar, indicating that they are, perhaps, related somehow, as one or the other was a simple reskin of the first. &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Ridge\"&gt;Thunder Ridge&lt;/a&gt; holds a massive amount of thunder lizards, and have already appeared in ' bonus campaign (starring &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt;). In \"Warcraft III\", Thunder Ridge thunder lizards were green, but in \"World of Warcraft\" they are red-skinned.\n&lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; thunder lizards appeared in the missions &lt;a href=\"The%20Culling%20%28WC3%20Human%29\"&gt;The Culling&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Crossing%20%28WC3%20BloodElf%29\"&gt;The Crossing&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nThe great reptile walks on all fours, the ground shaking with every step. It has a mottled green hide with a ridge running along its back.\nThe &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; have tales of legendary &lt;a href=\"kodo\"&gt;kodo beasts&lt;/a&gt;, gifted by the spirits of the sky and bound to the power of the storm. These legendary beasts include the thunder lizards, lightning lizards, and powerful storm wyrms. Tauren consider it a significant life event to encounter one of these creatures - an omen, though for good or ill is not always apparent.\nWhile similarities exist, the thunder lizard\u2019s relationship to kodo beasts is distant. These animals are aggressive, particularly while in herds. Keeping a healthy distance from a thunder lizard will likely allow one to avoid trouble. \nThunder lizards prefer to keep to a tight home range, with predictable movements. In rocky or hilly terrain, thunder lizards find grottos or vales to bed in for the night. Pairs or herds form a small number of these beds throughout their range, returning to whichever one is closer as they graze. These nest sites may have equipment and treasure left from would-be attackers.\n&lt;a href=\"Salamander\"&gt;Salamander&lt;/a&gt;s, cousins to the thunder lizards, are a rare and exotic offshoot of the race.\nLightning lizard.\nAn occasional spark fires from the peat reptile\u2019s eyes as it trundles its massive form along the plains. Is hide is mottled green and brown with splotches Of blue! and a great ridge runs along its back. Lightning lizards look much like thunder lizards, although they are of superior size. They also Possess abilities beyond what their smaller cousins enjoy. Sparks dance from the great lizard\u2019s eyes! and its bellow carries over tremendous distances.\nStorm wyrm.\nStorm wyrms are powerful cousins to thunder and lightning lizards. Some tauren believe that mighty sky spirits dwell in the most powerful of earthly creatures, the fusion of sky and earth taking the shape of storm wyrms. These beasts are clearly magical, as wind and mist play about them at all times. Storm wyrms are more powerful and more intelligent than their brethren. They have the same special attacks and special qualities as lightning lizards. These magical beasts may make use of some equipment, particularly magic rings."}

Formerly known as the Prince of Air, Thunderaan became the new Windlord following the death of &lt;a href=\"Al%27Akir\"&gt;Al'Akir&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Sundering\"&gt;Elemental Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, the Firelord &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; sought to consume Thunderaan. Thunderaan was betrayed by Ragnaros's lieutenants, &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Geddon\"&gt;Baron Geddon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Garr\"&gt;Garr&lt;/a&gt;, and struck down by &lt;a href=\"Sulfuras\"&gt;Sulfuras&lt;/a&gt;, the legendary hammer of Ragnaros. Thunderaan fell, utterly defeated. The Firelord feasted upon the essence of the Prince of Air but was unable to consume him entirely. What little remained of Thunderaan's essence was stored within a talisman of elemental binding. Ragnaros then shattered the talisman in &lt;a href=\"Bindings%20of%20the%20Windseeker\"&gt;two flawless pieces&lt;/a&gt; and assigned it to his two lieutenants.\nWhen mortal &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s infiltrated the &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Core\"&gt;Molten Core&lt;/a&gt; beneath &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt; thousands of years later, they struck down Garr and Baron Geddon and reclaimed the Bindings of Thunderaan. Working with &lt;a href=\"Highlord%20Demitrian\"&gt;Highlord Demitrian&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;, they were able to successfully summon Thunderaan... only to strike him down and for the &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarven&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Wray\"&gt;Wray&lt;/a&gt; to claim his sword, &lt;a href=\"Thunderfury%2C%20Blessed%20Blade%20of%20the%20Windseeker\"&gt;Thunderfury&lt;/a&gt;, for himself.\nYears later, the &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt; sought to gather the four Elemental Lords to stand against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; and so decided to resurrect Thunderaan to replace the fallen &lt;a href=\"Al%27Akir\"&gt;Al'Akir&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; adventurer gathered Thunderfury from Wray, who had been killed in &lt;a href=\"Azsuna\"&gt;Azsuna&lt;/a&gt;, and brought the blade to the &lt;a href=\"Vortex%20Pinnacle\"&gt;Vortex Pinnacle&lt;/a&gt;. Without a Windlord, &lt;a href=\"Skywall\"&gt;Skywall&lt;/a&gt; had been in turmoil and so after arriving there the shaman empowered Thunderfury with the &lt;a href=\"%3AHeart%20of%20Skywall\"&gt;:Heart of Skywall&lt;/a&gt; taken from &lt;a href=\"Vortos\"&gt;Vortos&lt;/a&gt;, Duke of the East Winds. With the heart, Thunderaan was reborn from the power of Thunderfury and became the new Windlord. Thunderaan promised that the armies of Skywall would stand shoulder to shoulder with the mortal races against the Legion, and sent &lt;a href=\"Consular%20Celestos\"&gt;Consular Celestos&lt;/a&gt; to join the Earthen Ring at the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Azeroth%20%28Class%20Hall%29\"&gt;Heart of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nSoon after, a &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt; obtained a pair of bindings similar to those Ragnaros had once used to contain Thunderaan and sought to use them as leverage to bargain with the new Windlord. Thunderaan was not pleased, as the last time mortals held such bindings they had freed him only to strike him down and steal his weapon. Even so, he agreed to bless the rogue's &lt;a href=\"The%20Dreadblades\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt; with his power in exchange for the bindings, intending to use them against the minions of the &lt;a href=\"Smolderon\"&gt;new Firelord&lt;/a&gt;. As he departed, Thunderaan warned the rogue never to call on him again.\nIn time the &lt;a href=\"Conclave%20of%20Wind\"&gt;Conclave of Wind&lt;/a&gt; would reject his rule, declaring that &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Sarsarun\"&gt;Prince Sarsarun&lt;/a&gt; was the true heir of Al'Akir. Seeking to regain their allegiance, Thunderaan tasked the Farseer with defeating the Conclave. Impressed with Thunderaan's champion, they subsequently swore their allegiance to Thunderaan. As a gesture of appreciation, Thunderaan gifted the Farseer with an elemental mount: The &lt;a href=\"%3AFarseer%27s%20Raging%20Tempest\"&gt;:Farseer's Raging Tempest&lt;/a&gt;.\nStrategy.\nThunderaan has surprisingly little HP, so downing him should not be a problem for any 40-man raid with experience in the &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Core\"&gt;Molten Core&lt;/a&gt; or harder instances. Bring some friends to put the numbers over 40, and you're virtually guaranteed success. He can be killed with far fewer people if they're well-geared or patient - 7 or 8 have been confirmed, and a good 5-person group should be able to complete the fight given time.\nThunderaan has a knockback that wipes &lt;a href=\"aggro\"&gt;aggro&lt;/a&gt;, but the radius for the knockback is less than the radius at which he's attackable. So long as the &lt;a href=\"tank\"&gt;tank&lt;/a&gt; stays at maximum &lt;a href=\"melee\"&gt;melee&lt;/a&gt; range the knockback should not be an issue. There is also a chain lightning effect that can hit melee attackers, and an area effect lightning attack that most &lt;a href=\"ranged\"&gt;ranged&lt;/a&gt; attackers and &lt;a href=\"healer\"&gt;healer&lt;/a&gt;s can avoid by keeping their distance.\nA tank with high nature &lt;a href=\"resistance\"&gt;resistance&lt;/a&gt; will mitigate a great deal of Thunderaan's damage.\nQuotes.\nSpeech to the Conclave of Wind.\nI see the Farseer has edified your allegiance to my direction. Good. Let me clear away any lingering doubts still polluting your minds. I am the Windlord now, and all of you bluster about within my domain. But let us not leave this council with a whiff of foul air. Divided, we are scattered to winds. But united, we are a cyclone of power. Let this council never dissipate again.\nSpeculation.\n&lt;a href=\"Prince%20Sarsarun\"&gt;Prince Sarsarun&lt;/a&gt; might be Thunderaan's brother and &lt;a href=\"Al%27Akir\"&gt;Al'Akir&lt;/a&gt; his father given his title of a prince."}

It is a sobering sight, a massive, silent grave with its wandering ghosts.\nAges ago, after being corrupted by &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt;, the Keeper &lt;a href=\"Loken\"&gt;Loken&lt;/a&gt; killed his brother's wife &lt;a href=\"Sif\"&gt;Sif&lt;/a&gt;, and tricked &lt;a href=\"Thorim\"&gt;Thorim&lt;/a&gt; into believing that &lt;a href=\"Arngrim%20the%20Insatiable\"&gt;King Arngrim&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"frost%20giant\"&gt;frost giant&lt;/a&gt;s were responsible. In a fit of rage, Thorim threw his hammer, &lt;a href=\"Krolmir\"&gt;Krolmir&lt;/a&gt;, at Arngrim, who was in the middle of a battle against a clan of &lt;a href=\"Frostborn\"&gt;frost dwarves&lt;/a&gt;. The explosion of Krolmir striking the ground killed all those nearby and froze the entire tableau for all time, catching the moment the shockwave threw many of the dwarves into the air. In his last act, Arngrim cast a rune on Krolmir, preventing anyone from claiming it.\nCenturies later, at the time of the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, Thorim discovered the truth with the aid of &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s serving the &lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Hodir\"&gt;Sons of Hodir&lt;/a&gt;. Roused from his stupor, he vowed to take the fight against Loken, and enlisted the adventurers to help him to make up for his past sins and to regain the trust of the frost giants. With the help of the adventurers, &lt;a href=\"King%20Jokkum\"&gt;King Jokkum&lt;/a&gt; summoned Thorim at Thunderfall, where the Keeper apologized for all he did, and after Jokkum agreed to forgive him, Thorim claimed once again his hammer.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;war against the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, the brothers &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard\"&gt;Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; visited the area, and &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; considered it to be proof of the fallibility of the keepers and those who created them."}

Upon defeating Thunderaan, loot the &lt;a href=\"Dormant%20Wind%20Kissed%20Blade\"&gt;Dormant Wind Kissed Blade&lt;/a&gt; from its corpse. Deliver this to (the now rather cowed) Highlord, and he will make Thunderfury.\nIn the RPG.\nThunderfury is a vicious sword, crafted from elementium and containing a crackling electrical core that might be all that remains of Prince Thunderaan. The hilt is unusually long, wrapped in black dragon hide, and studded with small spikes of black dragon bone."}

The opposite of &lt;a href=\"Amplify%20Magic%20%28removed%20mage%20ability%29\"&gt;Amplify Magic (removed mage ability)&lt;/a&gt;, it decreases the amount of damage the target takes from each enemy spell, but also decreases the healing a target group member takes from each healing spell.\nDamage taken and healing taken is the same effect as the &lt;a href=\"spell%20power\"&gt;spell power&lt;/a&gt; stat found on some gear. For example, a &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; casting a damage spell on a target buffed with Dampen Magic rank 6 will have the same effect as if he had 120 less +damage on his gear.\nTips and Tactics.\nMany players don't realize that, in certain situations, &lt;a href=\"Dampen%20Magic\"&gt;Dampen Magic&lt;/a&gt; is one of the mage's best defensive buffs. It reduces the damage caused by many kinds of non-&lt;a href=\"physical\"&gt;physical&lt;/a&gt; attacks, not only traditional spells. This includes natural attacks like &lt;a href=\"poison\"&gt;poison&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"DoT\"&gt;DoT&lt;/a&gt; effects of &lt;a href=\"disease\"&gt;disease&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"curse\"&gt;curse&lt;/a&gt;s, acid, and even melee attacks by fire, frost and wind &lt;a href=\"elementals\"&gt;elementals&lt;/a&gt;.\nMost mages use this spell when &lt;a href=\"solo\"&gt;solo&lt;/a&gt;ing or in small groups with no healer to lessen the damage enemy casters dish out. Most enemy damage spells are bolts with long &lt;a href=\"cast\"&gt;cast&lt;/a&gt;ing times; you'll really see the effect when 100 damage becomes 60.\nLike &lt;a href=\"Amplify%20Magic%20%28removed%20mage%20ability%29\"&gt;Amplify Magic (removed mage ability)&lt;/a&gt;, this spell has benefits and drawbacks and it is important to choose the correct spell. This spell can be very dangerous if used incorrectly, cutting the healing team's spell power and preventing heals from being effective. &lt;a href=\"Dampen%20Magic\"&gt;Dampen Magic&lt;/a&gt; is useful in group situations where players will take very many &lt;a href=\"magical\"&gt;magical&lt;/a&gt; damage hits. In these situations, it will prevent a large amount of damage, allowing the healing team more time to react, and allowing all players more time to get move out of &lt;a href=\"avoidable%20damage\"&gt;avoidable damage&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen deciding whether or not to use this buff, consider the number of damaging spells likely to hit vs. the number of heals. In raid situations, when a tank has multiple healers on him at a time and will get many more heals per second than damaging spells per second, the net healing decrease will be greater than the net damage decrease. \"Even\" when fighting most magic-damage bosses, &lt;a href=\"Amplify%20Magic%20%28removed%20mage%20ability%29\"&gt;Amplify Magic (removed mage ability)&lt;/a&gt; is still often more beneficial on the tank than no buff or &lt;a href=\"Dampen%20Magic\"&gt;Dampen Magic&lt;/a&gt; would be.\nWhen to use &lt;a href=\"Dampen%20Magic\"&gt;Dampen Magic&lt;/a&gt;:\nOn a fight with a steady stream of magic damage, such as the &lt;a href=\"Twin%20Val%27kyr\"&gt;Twin Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Sapphiron\"&gt;Sapphiron&lt;/a&gt; encounters, always have your mage(s) cast &lt;a href=\"Dampen%20Magic\"&gt;Dampen Magic&lt;/a&gt; on the entire raid; it will vastly reduce damage taken, making healing much easier.\nUsually beneficial on the DPS and Healers.\nDon't use &lt;a href=\"Dampen%20Magic\"&gt;Dampen Magic&lt;/a&gt; if there are relatively few magic damage hits, or if there is a good reason to use &lt;a href=\"Amplify%20Magic%20%28removed%20mage%20ability%29\"&gt;Amplify Magic (removed mage ability)&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen to use &lt;a href=\"Amplify%20Magic%20%28removed%20mage%20ability%29\"&gt;Amplify Magic (removed mage ability)&lt;/a&gt;:\nWhen fighting a boss such as &lt;a href=\"Deathbringer%20Saurfang\"&gt;Deathbringer Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Gruul%20the%20Dragonkiller%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Gruul the Dragonkiller&lt;/a&gt;, where only physical damage is taken, always have your mage(s) cast &lt;a href=\"Amplify%20Magic%20%28removed%20mage%20ability%29\"&gt;Amplify Magic (removed mage ability)&lt;/a&gt; on the entire raid; it will increase all healing done, making healing much easier.\nUsually beneficial on the Tanks.\nDon't use &lt;a href=\"Amplify%20Magic%20%28removed%20mage%20ability%29\"&gt;Amplify Magic (removed mage ability)&lt;/a&gt; if it presents a danger of tanks being one-shot, or if there is a good reason to use &lt;a href=\"Dampen%20Magic\"&gt;Dampen Magic&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen to use neither spell:\nWhile many will claim that it's often best to use neither buff, this is actually untrue, and very rarely will there come a time when it is optimal for any player to have neither buff active. This is easy to see, because removing one buff is the exact same effect as applying the other, and if it was beneficial to do one, then it must follow that is beneficial to do the other, which is almost always true. \"However\", if you risk picking incorrectly and using the wrong buff, it may be \"safer\" to run without either."}

During the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, he served as a captain in the &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20Militia\"&gt;Stromgarde militia&lt;/a&gt; and later as tactical advisor and second-in-command to General &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Expedition\"&gt;Alliance Expedition&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;. Since the sealing of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, he has been the master of &lt;a href=\"Honor%20Hold\"&gt;Honor Hold&lt;/a&gt;, the Expedition's headquarters in &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith the death of Prince &lt;a href=\"Galen%20Trollbane\"&gt;Galen Trollbane&lt;/a&gt;, the heir to the throne, Danath was considered by some to be the legitimate leader of Stromgarde, as the nephew of &lt;a href=\"Thoras%20Trollbane\"&gt;Thoras Trollbane&lt;/a&gt;, and awaited his return from &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. Danath ultimately fulfilled this desire, and became the leader of a newly rebuilt Stromgarde during the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, before the Horde laid siege to the kingdom during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Stromgarde\"&gt;Battle for Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nSecond War.\nA veteran &lt;a href=\"mercenary\"&gt;mercenary&lt;/a&gt; captain in the &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20Militia\"&gt;Stromgarde Militia&lt;/a&gt; at the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, he became the tactical advisor to General &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; during the conflict. \nDanath made a name for himself as a great leader during the final battle for the liberation of &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;. By the end of the war, he was considered one of Stromgarde's most celebrated soldiers and one of the war's most prominent veterans. His status as a great general and fighter elevated him to the position of Overseer at the orcish &lt;a href=\"internment%20camps\"&gt;internment camps&lt;/a&gt; system in &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28continent%29\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, based at &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;New Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;.\nBeyond the Dark Portal.\nDanath was called to reinforce &lt;a href=\"Nethergarde%20Keep\"&gt;Nethergarde Keep&lt;/a&gt; when the Horde reopened the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;. Taking half of the standing forces and all of the &lt;a href=\"Mercenary\"&gt;mercenaries&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;, Danath headed out to Nethergarde where he was ambushed by the &lt;a href=\"Death%20knight%20%28Old%20Horde%29\"&gt;death knights&lt;/a&gt; and the new &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20clan\"&gt;Warsong clan&lt;/a&gt;. Knowing that the Horde was going to win the battle, the men sacrificed themselves so Danath could warn &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;, the wizard in charge of Nethergarde. Against his wish to stay with his men, Danath could not let their sacrifices be in vain and galloped to Nethergarde where they were under siege by the Warsong led by &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grommash Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; until they were relieved by his friend and commander, General &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt;. Danath would never forget the guilt for leading and then leaving his \"boys\", as he called them, to be slaughtered.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; took the &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Medivh\"&gt;Book of Medivh&lt;/a&gt;, among other items, to Draenor, Danath joined the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Expedition\"&gt;Alliance Expedition&lt;/a&gt; as second-in-command and the tactical advisor to General Turalyon. After taking &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Citadel\"&gt;Hellfire Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, Danath led half of the Expedition along with &lt;a href=\"Kurdran%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Kurdran Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt;'s Gryphon Riders and half of &lt;a href=\"Alleria\"&gt;Alleria&lt;/a&gt;'s rangers led by &lt;a href=\"Talthressar\"&gt;Talthressar&lt;/a&gt; (who became his advisor) after &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;; while the rest went after the items. During the chase, Kurdran was struck down by Ner'zhul. Enraged with the loss of his friend, Danath relentlessly pursued the Horde and was determined to launch a full attack at once on &lt;a href=\"Auchindoun\"&gt;Auchindoun&lt;/a&gt; where the Horde had taken refuge, but at the urging of Talthressar he quickly calmed down.\nAs they waited, Talthressar and Danath encountered the &lt;a href=\"arakkoa\"&gt;arakkoa&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Grizzik\"&gt;Grizzik&lt;/a&gt;. Learning that Kurdran was still alive, Danath quickly followed Grizzik as he led them into the tunnels of the &lt;a href=\"Auchindoun\"&gt;Auchindoun&lt;/a&gt;. There Danath met the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; priest &lt;a href=\"Nemuraan\"&gt;Nemuraan&lt;/a&gt;. Convincing the draenei that they were going to rid the ancient temple of the orcs, Nemuraan aided them by calling the ancient draenei spirits and leading them into the tunnels. With the aid of his newfound allies, Danath led the Alliance against the orcs there where the humans, elves, and dwarves would fight for the first time alongside the draenei who would one day become members of the Alliance. \nAfter rescuing Kurdran, Danath comes face to face with the renowned orc chieftain &lt;a href=\"Kilrogg%20Deadeye\"&gt;Kilrogg Deadeye&lt;/a&gt;: who barred the way to Ner'zhul. After fighting a fierce but honorable duel, Danath slew the great orc warrior, but the delay had given Ner'zhul enough time to escape.\nParting from his new friends, Danath rejoined Turalyon and laid siege to the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt; where Ner'zhul was opening new portals. When the planet was starting to tear itself apart, Danath and his friends defended Khadgar against overwhelming forces while the mage closed the Dark Portal to Azeroth. Then, with the rest of the expedition, he disappeared into one of the rifts Ner'zhul created to escape the dying world of Draenor.\nDanath Trollbane has since been immortalized in stone, along with the other leaders from the expeditionary force, in the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Heroes\"&gt;Valley of Heroes&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nDanath and his men survived the cataclysm that created &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; and now reside at &lt;a href=\"Honor%20Hold\"&gt;Honor Hold&lt;/a&gt;, which has stood since before the sealing of the Portal. Honor Hold was left to its own devices in the battle against the Burning Legion and the fel orcs of &lt;a href=\"Magtheridon\"&gt;Magtheridon&lt;/a&gt;, until &lt;a href=\"Kazzak%20the%20Supreme\"&gt;Lord Kazzak&lt;/a&gt; reopened the Portal decades later. Danath, along with the rest of the Alliance forces, was presumed to be dead by those that remained on Azeroth. It turned out that many of them were still alive, including Danath. With General Turalyon missing, Danath has taken up leadership of the &lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Lothar\"&gt;Sons of Lothar&lt;/a&gt; in Turalyon's absence. Reunited with the Alliance, he has welcomed the much-needed supplies and reinforcements from Stormwind and Nethergarde.\nThrough these reinforcements, Danath has learned of the fate of his beloved Stromgarde, destroyed during the events of the Third War. Once his duty in Outland is done, Danath wishes to return to Stromgarde and restore it to its former glory.\nDanath is the last of the five leaders of the expedition to remain at Honor Hold. Khadgar settled in &lt;a href=\"Shattrath\"&gt;Shattrath&lt;/a&gt; after his journeys to other worlds. Kurdran and most of his Wildhammer brethren set up a &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20Stronghold\"&gt;base&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Valley\"&gt;Shadowmoon Valley&lt;/a&gt;. Danath has not heard from Turalyon or Alleria in over a decade.\nTuralyon and Alleria's son &lt;a href=\"Arator\"&gt;Arator&lt;/a&gt;, accompanying the Alliance reinforcements, visited Danath and wanted to find his parents. Danath told him that his father had long been missing.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"gan%27arg\"&gt;gan'arg&lt;/a&gt; took control of the &lt;a href=\"Honor%20Hold%20Mine\"&gt;Honor Hold Mine&lt;/a&gt;, he told &lt;a href=\"Foreman%20Biggums\"&gt;Foreman Biggums&lt;/a&gt; that he would take away ale rations from him if the dwarf didn't resolve the problem.\nCataclysm.\nDanath's possible return to Stromgarde is hinted at when players speak to &lt;a href=\"Skuerto\"&gt;Skuerto&lt;/a&gt; in \"Cataclysm\": \"I'm sick of sittin' in this &lt;a href=\"Refuge%20Pointe\"&gt;hole&lt;/a&gt;. I hope whatever sorry pencil-pusher is holdin' up Danath's return gets a punch in the jimmies.\"\nLegion.\nDanath returned during the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; as the quest starter for the &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"artifact\"&gt;artifact&lt;/a&gt;s. While being accompanied by the Alliance warrior on a reconnaissance flight above the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt; he was struck by Legion siege weapons, then disappeared after his gryphon fell toward the sea, telling the player that he would find an alternative way back.\nDanath can later be found at &lt;a href=\"A%20Hero%27s%20Welcome\"&gt;A Hero's Welcome&lt;/a&gt;. He comments that he had almost been killed by demons twice now, and they will not get a third chance. If the character is a warrior, he is glad to see they survived as well, stating he never doubted them, and that he would return to the front soon.\nWhen it is discovered that Alleria and Turalyon are still alive, Khadgar reunites with them on &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;, homeworld of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. He tells them that Kurdran and Danath both live, though he does not get to see them as much as he would like, and the three decide that when the fighting is over the Sons of Lothar will hold a reunion feast.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nDanath now wears a crown, and refers to &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands\"&gt;Arathi&lt;/a&gt; as \"his\". He returned to &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20Keep\"&gt;Stromgarde Keep&lt;/a&gt; to lead his &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, and was one of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; commanders during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Stromgarde\"&gt;Battle for Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt;. He leads the Stromgarde military into battle, with his elite forces consisting of &lt;a href=\"Veteran%20of%20Stromgarde\"&gt;Veterans of Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt; and various members of the &lt;a href=\"League%20of%20Arathor\"&gt;League of Arathor&lt;/a&gt;.\nThroughout the battle, he boasts about Stromgarde's defenses. He also shows a heightened animosity towards &lt;a href=\"Eitrigg\"&gt;Eitrigg&lt;/a&gt;, stating they do not belong in Stromgarde; the \"rightful home of the Trollbanes\". The battle ultimately ended in the Alliance's favor.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, outriders reported to Danath that a Horde group was passing through the Arathi Highlands. Danath informed &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; about it.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; presented himself to Stromgarde during his mission for &lt;a href=\"King%20Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, Danath blessed him to inspect the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20%28Stromgarde%20Keep%29\"&gt;Sanctum&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Crypt%20%28Stromgarde%20Keep%29\"&gt;Crypt&lt;/a&gt;.\nValley of Heroes monument.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; descended upon &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; after his violent exit from &lt;a href=\"Deepholm\"&gt;Deepholm&lt;/a&gt;, Danath's monument was toppled into the moat. Only the feet remained standing on its pedestal. &lt;a href=\"Foreman%20Wick\"&gt;Foreman Wick&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mason%20Goldgild\"&gt;Mason Goldgild&lt;/a&gt; were once again hired to set it back in place. In &lt;a href=\"patch%204.0.3a\"&gt;patch 4.0.3a&lt;/a&gt;, they had already retrieved the statue from the water.\nDespite the apparent difficulties Foreman Wick and Mason Goldgild had with the statue (and each other), Danath's statue was returned to its former splendor in &lt;a href=\"patch%205.2.0\"&gt;patch 5.2.0&lt;/a&gt;, alongside most of the other superficial damages that Deathwing caused in the Valley of Heroes.\nQuotes.\n\"For Danath's Warcraft II quotes, see &lt;a href=\"Quotes%20of%20Warcraft%20II%23Danath\"&gt;Quotes of Warcraft II#Danath&lt;/a&gt;\".\nIn the RPG.\nIn the RPG, Danath was oddly referred to with different last names: Dungalion and Trollbane. He is the uncle of &lt;a href=\"Cristof%20Dungalion\"&gt;Cristof Dungalion&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpeculation.\nA &lt;a href=\"TCG\"&gt;TCG&lt;/a&gt; image of Danath shows him wielding a sword identical to how &lt;a href=\"Trol%27kalar\"&gt;Trol'kalar&lt;/a&gt; is depicted in \"&lt;a href=\"Lands%20of%20Conflict\"&gt;Lands of Conflict&lt;/a&gt;\". Since the only known depiction of the legendary blade is from \"Lands of Conflict\", which is part of the &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20RPG\"&gt;Warcraft RPG&lt;/a&gt; and therefore non-&lt;a href=\"canon\"&gt;canon&lt;/a&gt;, it is unknown if the sword wielded by Danath in the TCG is meant to be Trol'kalar. It is reasonable to assume that they were meant to be the same at the time, though Blizzard is no longer bound to this."}

The feature gained infamy as it was advertised in the expansion's marketing but was never actually implemented due to the amount of animation work required, and it is often jokingly referenced in fan discussions about canceled features from other expansions.\nHistory.\nAnnouncement.\nThe feature was originally announced at &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon%202007\"&gt;BlizzCon 2007&lt;/a&gt; in the , which lists \"New dances\" as one of the expansion's features, alongside \"Changeable hairstyles\". Both of these were also included in the features list on the official \"Wrath of the Lich King\" flash site. The earliest known reference to a \"dance studio\" where these new dances would be obtained comes from a forum post by &lt;a href=\"Community%20Manager\"&gt;Community Manager&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bornakk\"&gt;Bornakk&lt;/a&gt; on August 24, 2007, in which he wrote that \"We are also providing players the opportunity to learn new/different dances with the dance studio.\"\nAt a press event at the &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Worldwide%20Invitational\"&gt;Blizzard Worldwide Invitational&lt;/a&gt; in July 2008, Lead Level Designer &lt;a href=\"Cory%20Stockton\"&gt;Cory Stockton&lt;/a&gt; stated that the dance studio was \"a gigantic amount of work\", as Blizzard would have to implement custom animations for each playable race so that they \"look right\". He continued that the developers hadn't decided how many animations they would do per race or how exactly players would acquire them, but that they had discussed the idea of a dance studio where players would go to learn new dances. He finished that they didn't know how much time it was going to take to implement, as this would be dictated by the amount of new animations required.\nPost-\"Wrath of the Lich King\" release.\nAlthough new character hairstyles and the option of changing hairstyles were implemented with the addition of the &lt;a href=\"barbershop\"&gt;barbershop&lt;/a&gt; as had been advertised, the dance studio never appeared in the \"Wrath of the Lich King\" beta and wasn't mentioned by Blizzard again until a community summit on October 9, 2008\u2014two weeks prior to the expansion's release\u2014during which Lead Designer &lt;a href=\"Jeffrey%20Kaplan\"&gt;Jeffrey Kaplan&lt;/a&gt; told \"Curse\" that the dance studio would be added \"After \"Lich King\" releases for sure\". He elaborated that adding even a single dance animation for a race takes \"as much time as creating a new creature for the game\", so the developers had to consider which of the two would see more use. The ultimate goal, according to Kaplan, was still to implement the studio and that one of the desired features was to allow players to not just choose a new dance, but string together multiple moves to create a unique dance.\nOn January 30, 2009, &lt;a href=\"Community%20Manager\"&gt;Community Manager&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Zarhym\"&gt;Zarhym&lt;/a&gt; wrote on the official forum that the studio had been a work in progress for the artists for \"some time now\" and that \"It's something they hack away at here and there when things like &lt;a href=\"Ulduar%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt; aren't imminent.\" On April 22, Community Manager &lt;a href=\"Nethaera\"&gt;Nethaera&lt;/a&gt; wrote in another thread that: \"It has not been dropped. Creating additional dances takes a significant amount of animation work and we want to make sure that when we do put them out, that they meet our standards. We still intend to put them in, but we have no current eta on their addition.\" She added that the specifics of the feature (such as if the possible dances would be restricted by character faction and gender) were still unknown.\nIn a developer chat on Twitter on February 26, 2010, Cory Stockton and &lt;a href=\"Greg%20Street\"&gt;Greg Street&lt;/a&gt; stated that the dance studio was \"still on the list\", adding that \"We always start an expansion with more than we can realistically do and then shuffle things up and down\". In an interview with DirecTV at &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon%202010\"&gt;BlizzCon 2010&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tom%20Chilton\"&gt;Tom Chilton&lt;/a&gt; mentioned that Blizzard had been working on new dances and that they'd release the dance studio when it was ready.\nLater expansions.\nOn August 25, 2013, Greg Street replied to a Twitter post about the then-in-progress &lt;a href=\"player%20character%20revamp\"&gt;player character revamp&lt;/a&gt; with: \"The good news is this [new character models] is something actively being worked on, not a shelved project like dance studio or &lt;a href=\"Abyssal%20Maw%20%28instance%29\"&gt;abyssal maw&lt;/a&gt;.\" In a follow-up tweet, he added: \"Also, shelved does not mean cancelled. :)\" In an interview at &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon%202013\"&gt;BlizzCon 2013&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"J.%20Allen%20Brack\"&gt;J. Allen Brack&lt;/a&gt; stated regarding the dance studio that: \"We talked about and developed a whole bunch of different animations and different technology that we could use. We didn't really come up with a really great game system behind it. It is something that we talked about. It is something that we wanna do at some point. But it's not something we're currently working on.\" At the &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon%202015\"&gt;BlizzCon 2015&lt;/a&gt; Q&amp;A, Tom Chilton stated that Blizzard would still like to add the studio someday and that it was a matter of finding the animation time for it.\nLegacy.\nOver time, as \"Wrath of the Lich King\" was developed, released, and came to a close without any sign of the dance studio and players kept asking what happened to it, it took on the status of meme and running gag, often included as a punchline at the end of lists of advertised features that were still missing from the game. In 2011, Mathew McCurley of \"&lt;a href=\"WoW%20Insider\"&gt;WoW Insider&lt;/a&gt;\" wrote that the dance studio \"has become a legend in its own right, being called everything from the second coming of the WoW messiah to a dumb waste of time for designers and developers who could be working on more 'important' projects\". He concluded that the primary reason for its reputation was its inclusion in the original \"Wrath of the Lich King\" trailer, along with the fact that new dances\u2014along with new hairstyles\u2014would've served as a long-awaited addition of more character customization, an aspect at which \"World of Warcraft\" was considered to be subpar compared to other MMOs at the time. The dance studio is sometimes called an example of or (dubiously) .\nDue to its infamy, Blizzard have made several joking references to the dance studio over the years.\nIn a 2014 article examining the meme and the reason for its longevity, Nathan Grayson of \"Kotaku\" wrote that: \"The legacy of [the dance studio] is something that can only happen in a game like \"World of Warcraft\", one that's been around for ages, one whose players have grown and changed over time with it. It seems like such an inconsequential feature, but it's another facet of players feeling a personal connection to their characters. It's a desire for greater freedom of self-expression. More than that, though, the dance studio has been kept in the public conscious by its own \"lack\" of existence longer than many real, frequently updated features can boast. It's practically immortal at this point. The heart of the dance studio is not a dance studio at all. It's the conversation it's inspired, the back-and-forth between Blizzard and slavering, dance-hungry fans. Maybe Blizzard is being a gigantic jerk, or maybe they're just trying to connect with their longtime fans like an old pal bringing up a years-dead injoke. Either way, fans keep talking, and the legend grows.\""}

His limitless ambition, combined with his egotistical mindset, made him an easy pawn for the forces of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;. Empowered by the treacherous &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Prince Arthas&lt;/a&gt; himself, Dar'Khan opened the way for the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; to enter Quel'Thalas and ravage the land in their march to the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile Dar'Khan has met death several times (execution by &lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt;, vaporization by &lt;a href=\"Anveena\"&gt;Anveena&lt;/a&gt;, and killed with an enchanted arrow by &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;), he has consistently managed to cheat his fate and return from the grave. Most recently, he was once again resurrected and resided at the fortress of &lt;a href=\"Deatholme\"&gt;Deatholme&lt;/a&gt; in the southern &lt;a href=\"Ghostlands\"&gt;Ghostlands&lt;/a&gt;, where he commands the Scourge in Quel'Thalas. His presence at the doorstep of Quel'Thalas was one of the primary obstacles preventing the &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;' full acceptance into the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, until he was finally beheaded by the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s.\nBiography.\nDar'Khan Drathir spent his childhood at &lt;a href=\"Dawnstar%20Spire\"&gt;Dawnstar Spire&lt;/a&gt;. At some point, he researched the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;, and the bulk of his research was conducted there. He discovered the &lt;a href=\"Telogrus%20Rift\"&gt;fragments of an ancient world&lt;/a&gt; teetering on the brink of the Void itself, which held an ancient object of unspeakable might. Thousand years later, Dar'Khan's research would lead to the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Void%20elf\"&gt;void elves&lt;/a&gt;.\nDiscontented magister.\nAs a magister of Quel'Thalas, Dar'Khan used the Sunwell to help construct the cities, shape the land, and attain whatever the high elves desired. At some point, he was sent to aid &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Priestess Liadrin&lt;/a&gt; in uncovering the mystery behind a &lt;a href=\"runestone\"&gt;runestone&lt;/a&gt; malfunction, though was captured and slated for torture. Beaten and exhausted, Dar'Khan struggled to free the group, though eventually succeeded in mustering the energy for a teleportation spell. The experience was the start of a friendship between himself, Liadrin, &lt;a href=\"Galell\"&gt;Galell&lt;/a&gt;, and future Regent Lord &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;, all of whom had survived the ordeal together.\nDar'Khan was a member of the &lt;a href=\"Convocation%20of%20Silvermoon\"&gt;Convocation of Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;. When warned by &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; of the potential threat of an alliance between the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;forest troll&lt;/a&gt;s under &lt;a href=\"Zul%27jin\"&gt;Zul'jin&lt;/a&gt;, Dar'Khan scoffed and believed that they would not be able to get past the runestones that protected the borders of &lt;a href=\"Eversong%20Forest\"&gt;Eversong Forest&lt;/a&gt;.\nDar'Khan was a highly ambitious and egotistical elf, feeling he was never duly rewarded for his deeds. Despite his high social status of magister, he was just one of many, not enough to sate his greed. He greatly coveted the position of &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister\"&gt;Grand Magister of Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, though was unable to attain it. Lack of recognition for his part in high elf society coupled with his own egotistical nature, pushed him down a dark path and he began to secretly develop his own magics, as well as an obsession with the Sunwell. Frustrated by a lack of progress, Dar'Khan was elated when during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Prince Arthas&lt;/a&gt; reached out to aid him, and pledged his loyalty to the despoiler of Lordaeron.\nManipulated and strengthened by his \"Blessed Lord\", it was his friendship with Lor'themar that allowed Dar'Khan to help Arthas and his army slip through the Thalassian defenses, slaughtering his own comrades in the process, all the while believing that Arthas was helping him to fulfill his desire for the Sunwell's power. Dar'Khan was tasked with binding the Sunwell, to ensure &lt;a href=\"Ban%27dinoriel\"&gt;Ban'dinoriel&lt;/a&gt; could not protect the kingdom from the undead onslaught. Dar'Khan left for the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell%20Plateau\"&gt;Sunwell Plateau&lt;/a&gt;, and murdered several members of the &lt;a href=\"Convocation%20of%20Silvermoon\"&gt;Convocation of Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;; though the first kill was difficult, he came to revel in the carnage as his murders became more frequent. Dar'Khan succeeded in his mission, though could not help but have a \"taste\" of the power that awaited him.\nAfter the resurrection of &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;, Dar'Khan - having attempted to betray Arthas, just as he had betrayed his own people - was killed by the death knight, a fact that pleased the recently-raised &lt;a href=\"banshee\"&gt;banshee&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; to no end. Arthas subsequently raised him into the Scourge and put him in charge of the citadel of &lt;a href=\"Deatholme\"&gt;Deatholme&lt;/a&gt; in what was now known as the &lt;a href=\"Ghostlands\"&gt;Ghostlands&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Sunwell Trilogy.\nThe corrupted &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt; would be later destroyed by &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Prince Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt;, but Dar'Khan realized that some of the magical pond's power had survived the incident. Drathir was sent by the Lich King to track down where the remaining magic had gone.\nFollowing years of fruitless searching he finally neared his goal, detecting the Sunwell's presence near a peasant girl named &lt;a href=\"Anveena%20Teague\"&gt;Anveena Teague&lt;/a&gt;, who had also drawn the attention of members of the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;. Dar'Khan disguised himself as a human prince and hired the dragon hunter &lt;a href=\"Harkyn%20Grymstone\"&gt;Harkyn Grymstone&lt;/a&gt; to hunt down any dragon that would be drawn to the Sunwell's essence.\nDar'Khan, now skilled in &lt;a href=\"necromancy\"&gt;necromancy&lt;/a&gt; and commanding Scourge forces, attempted to capture Anveena and ascertain the power's whereabouts. He led failed attempts at her home and again in &lt;a href=\"Tarren%20Mill\"&gt;Tarren Mill&lt;/a&gt; where he was defeated by &lt;a href=\"Tyrygosa\"&gt;Tyrygosa&lt;/a&gt;, who enveloped him with fire. He was able to whisk himself away before the fire fully consumed him. He then finally came to the realization that Anveena was, in fact, an avatar of the Sunwell's power in humanoid form. Kidnapping her in &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac Mountains&lt;/a&gt; and spiriting her to the ruined lands of Quel'Thalas, now known as the Ghostlands, he confronted her with the truth of her existence.\nWishing to become a &lt;a href=\"god\"&gt;god&lt;/a&gt; and make even Arthas bow to him, Dar'Khan then attempted to cast a spell that would allow him to absorb the energies from her, however with the aid of her allies, Anveena manifested the Sunwell's power and wielded it against him. He made a final desperate attempt to drain the energy from her directly, but was unable to withstand its brilliance and was burned away.\nBlood of the Highborne.\nAgainst all odds, Dar'Khan had somehow survived his pulverization at the hands of Anveena, and was once again reanimated as a puppet of the Scourge. Two years after his previous death, the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, intrigued by the possibility of &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;-wielding warriors who adhered to no particular moral code, had tasked Drathir with luring out members of the new &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knights\"&gt;Blood Knight Order&lt;/a&gt; to be slain and raised into undeath. Dar'Khan, delighting in the notion of forcing &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt; to attack her beloved Silvermoon, left a number of clues regarding the delivery of the &lt;a href=\"%3AStone%20of%20Light\"&gt;:Stone of Light&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"%3AStone%20of%20Flame\"&gt;:Stone of Flame&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Stone%20of%20Spark\"&gt;Stone of Spark&lt;/a&gt; to focus scrutiny on &lt;a href=\"Dawnstar%20Spire\"&gt;Dawnstar Spire&lt;/a&gt; and draw out an adequate number of knights. Posing as a man named \"Thadirr,\" Dar'Khan ambushed the elves with an undead horde at his back, though Lor'themar had seen through his deceit and arrived with &lt;a href=\"Astalor%20Bloodsworn\"&gt;Astalor Bloodsworn&lt;/a&gt; and the royal guard to kill him. The tide turned further when &lt;a href=\"Halduron%20Brightwing\"&gt;Halduron Brightwing&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Elven%20ranger\"&gt;rangers&lt;/a&gt; relieved the battle, though Dar'Khan set Theron ablaze and prepared to flee. However, the Blood Knights healed the regent lord's wounds, and Lor'themar fired an arrow enchanted with a fragment of the Stone of Spark straight into Drathir's head, which caused the former magister to crumble into dust.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nDar'Khan rose into undeath once more, returning to Deatholme to direct Scourge agents safely from behind the walls of Deatholme. &lt;a href=\"Magister%20Kaendris\"&gt;Magister Kaendris&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20the%20Sun\"&gt;Sanctum of the Sun&lt;/a&gt; asked adventurers to kill Dar'Khan once again and return with his head, which was then delivered to Lor'themar Theron.\nAbilities.\nStrategy.\nAround level 15-16, a quest chain begins at the Sanctum of the Sun, sending the player to &lt;a href=\"Farstrider%20Enclave\"&gt;Farstrider Enclave&lt;/a&gt;. The Farstriders task the player with discovering clues of Dar'Khan's past, and how to potentially defeat him in the present. His journal is discovered at &lt;a href=\"Dawnstar%20Spire\"&gt;Dawnstar Spire&lt;/a&gt;, where Dar'Khan apparently spent much time; the journal reveals his contempt for his own race as well as his plans to allow the Scourge into Quel'Thalas.\nDar'Khan promised two artifacts, the &lt;a href=\"Stone%20of%20Flame\"&gt;Stone of Flame&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stone%20of%20Light\"&gt;Stone of Light&lt;/a&gt;, to the Scourge. These were powerful artifacts imbued with the power of the Sunwell, used as wards against the Scourge. The player is sent to retrieve the stones, which are forged into a sword or an orb (depending on the player's class or preference), which would allow the power of the Sunwell to be used against Dar'Khan. The player is then sent to Deatholme to destroy Dar'Khan and return his head in &lt;a href=\"The%20Traitor%27s%20Destruction\"&gt;The Traitor's Destruction&lt;/a&gt;.\nDar'Khan is located at the \"dead center\" of Deatholme, within the Tower of the Damned. The entrances are guarded by &lt;a href=\"shade\"&gt;shade&lt;/a&gt;s known as the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Dar%27Khan\"&gt;Eyes of Dar'Khan&lt;/a&gt;. Inside are a &lt;a href=\"Wailer\"&gt;Wailer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"banshee\"&gt;banshee&lt;/a&gt; and four &lt;a href=\"Deatholme%20Necromancer\"&gt;Deatholme Necromancer&lt;/a&gt;s with skeletal minions - two inside Dar'Khan's inner sanctum, and one at each of the entrances to that chamber. The &lt;a href=\"Sunwell%20Blade\"&gt;Sunwell Blade&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Sunwell%20Orb\"&gt;Sunwell Orb&lt;/a&gt; from the previous quest have a special spell that can silence Dar'Khan for five seconds and cause 500 Arcane damage to him. It is recommended to have a group of five (or one person with a level 30+ friend) to kill Dar'Khan.\nIt is recommended to destroy the 2 necromancers by pulling their skeletons and killing the necromancers themselves with ranged attacks and spells for trying to get in melee range with them will aggro Dar'Khan himself. Dar'Khan is a warlock-type mob, his base attack is Shadowbolt, and he also has Corruption and Fear that can send you into adds, therefore it is advised to clear the whole tower before attacking him. He has a huge health pool and hits hard so it is advised to have a 5-man group (or the low-level player on the quest with a much higher-level friend) to kill him.\nBecause all of his abilities have a pretty long (1 second and up) cast time, it is possible to solo him by breaking the line of sight around the corners of the corridor. Even so, he hits hard and it is advisable to pop CDs (both offensive and defensive) and use healing spells/potions as needed. Off-GCD interrupts can be used as a backup, and are best reserved against Fear, which has the shortest cast time.\nSpeculation.\nHow did he return?\nDar'Khan's appearance in \"World of Warcraft\" remains something of a mystery. Though he was apparently vaporized by Anveena at the conclusion of the Sunwell Trilogy, and killed again by Lor'themar in \"Blood of the Highborne\", he has returned yet again to command the Scourge forces in Quel'Thalas with no explanation as to the method of his revival.\nSimilarly, in the Sunwell Trilogy, Dar'Khan experienced a variety of bodily injuries including a severed finger and being completely consumed by flames, however, he simply regenerates his wounds or reappears later, seemingly unharmed, offering little explanation beyond stating that he is, \"more than mortal,\" and \"not quite\" dead. A detailed summary appearing online prior to the book's release described Dar'Khan as more &lt;a href=\"lich\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt; than mortal, indicated that like liches, his physical form might be capable of regeneration so long as his soul remains grounded in the physical world.\nA theory put forward after \"&lt;a href=\"Blood%20of%20the%20Highborne\"&gt;Blood of the Highborne&lt;/a&gt;\" may explain Dar'Khan's lich-like powers. After binding the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;, Dar'Khan could not help but taste and gorge upon its energies directly, against Arthas' orders. When Arthas hurled &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;'s remains into the well, its energies became dark and tainted, raising the former necromancer as a lich. However, Dar'Khan was also affected by this ritual, having directly consumed some of the Sunwell shortly beforehand -- Arthas informed him that the well was now contaminated, and having tasted it after its binding, so too was Dar'Khan, who could feel an alteration in the very \"depths of his being.\" It may be that Dar'Khan was also imbued with similar lich-like properties to Kel'Thuzad after \"surviving\" this experience."}

He appears in the \"World of Warcraft\" novel \"&lt;a href=\"Night%20of%20the%20Dragon\"&gt;Night of the Dragon&lt;/a&gt;\".\nBiography.\nDargonax was reputedly the third &lt;a href=\"twilight%20dragon\"&gt;twilight dragon&lt;/a&gt; created by &lt;a href=\"Sinestra\"&gt;Sinestra&lt;/a&gt;. The first two were not named, but their instability saw them slain with relative ease compared to Dargonax. Hatched from a black dragon egg infused with the energies of the captured nether dragon, &lt;a href=\"Zzeraku\"&gt;Zzeraku&lt;/a&gt;, Dargonax rapidly grew into a gargantuan beast nearly equaling the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspect\"&gt;Dragon Aspect&lt;/a&gt;s themselves in size. His ambition and cunning grew along with his body, and soon he harbored a desire to overthrow his \"mother\" and conquer the world for himself. Becoming arrogant of his own abilities Dargonax attempted to kill his \"mother\" at first chance only to freeze in place as Sinestra used the shards of the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Demon Soul&lt;/a&gt; to control him. Later on, when he learned about her creating &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20dragonflight\"&gt;more&lt;/a&gt; dragons like him, Dargonax becomes displeased as he feels that his new brothers and sisters would be better.\nDuring his development, the blood elf &lt;a href=\"Zendarin%20Windrunner\"&gt;Zendarin Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; secretly wished to take control of Dargonax as a magic source and his own personal &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;, and tried to do so with a final feeding to make him his slave. Sinestra had foreseen all however, and simply made Zendarin's betrayal a part of her plans, which resulted in his failure and escape as an enraged Dargonax tried to kill him. Dargonax would later be called to battle the invaders of Grim Batol but they were able to free Zzeraku, who quickly engaged Dargonax in battle. As the two clashed Dargonax fully absorbed the dying Zzeraku, who had decided to try and save Iridi at the cost of his own life. During this time Zendarin stole the Demon Soul (possibly as an alternate magic source having failed to take Dargonax, or as a secondary objective), the foul creation of &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; that had been destroyed by Rhonin years earlier. He would have pulled it off if not for Vereesa's intervention, resulting in the destruction of the Demon Soul - and of Zendarin himself - when the stolen staff of the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; touched the artifact.\nWith his power strengthen and his newfound freedom in the wake of the Demon Soul's destruction Dargonax, who had become frustrated at with Sinestra's attempts to control him, turned on his \"mother\" at this. As Dargonax attacked her the others noticed that Zzeraku's sacrifice had catalyzed the minor defective part within the twilight dragon that Iridi and her allies were able to exploit and finally defeat Dargonax, who as he burned away took his Sintharia with him\nAbilities.\nLike the earliest twilight dragons created by Sinestra, Dargonax had the power to vampirically drain magical energy from any source. He especially delighted in draining the power from dragons, and indeed this may be the very purpose the twilight dragonflight was created for.\nDargonax also seemed to acquire the powers or attributes of his victims, as when he completely absorbed the powers of the nether dragon Zzeraku, he gained the nether dragon's ability to shift into an ethereal form. This ultimately proved Dargonax's undoing however, as absorbing Zzeraku's energies caused a fatal destabilization of the twilight dragon's already unstable powers. Glowing as brightly as the sun, Dargonax burned away, seriously injuring his mother in death.\nQuotes.\n\"I obey no one but myself... I am Dargonax, the Devourer of all, including \"&lt;a href=\"Sintharia\"&gt;you&lt;/a&gt;\"...\"\n\"Good... good... and friends, they help friends, yes? Is that right?\" (to &lt;a href=\"Kalec\"&gt;Kalec&lt;/a&gt;)"}

It is a dark fantasy action role-playing game franchise. It is not related to the &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20universe\"&gt;Warcraft universe&lt;/a&gt; in any way, nor are there significant contributions from that universe to this one. Although, there have been some rumors of more linkage.\nMany people suspected that the Diablo franchise was dead when Blizzard closed (the studio that created it) after the release of the last '. The franchise continued as ' which was announced at the &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Worldwide%20Invitational%23WWI%202008\"&gt;Blizzard Worldwide Invitational 2008&lt;/a&gt; in Paris, and eventually was released in 2012. ', originally a mobile-only game in the franchise, was announced at &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon%202018\"&gt;BlizzCon 2018&lt;/a&gt; to poor reception and was eventually released in 2022 with a PC port but with a heavy focus for mobile. ' was announced at &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon%202019\"&gt;BlizzCon 2019&lt;/a&gt; with a planned release in 2023.\nInfluence on and differences from Warcraft.\nHumorous references aside, many spells and abilities in WC3 and WoW were inspired by skills in \"Diablo II\", namely auras and the idea of passive skills. The RPG elements of \"Diablo\" were significant in the development of WoW, as it meant that Blizzard already had experience in building an RPG. Here are some of the similarities that players may notice between games:\nLike in the Warcraft universe, \"Diablo\" features demons, but unlike \"Warcraft\", \"Diablo\"'s demons are ruled by devils, come from Hell, and fight a war against actual angels. The more traditional nature of Heaven and Hell make the world of \"Diablo\" extremely different from that of \"Warcraft\". Religion becomes a conflict (references are made to Mage Wars and Inquisitions), and humanity becomes pawns in a greater conflict between angels and demons. In \"World of Warcraft\", the fight for fame and glory can be tied into a quest to save the world from the evils of the Old Gods or the Burning Legion. In the world of Sanctuary, no quest for prestige and riches can occur without facing the minions of Hell.\nIn terms of visual style, \"Diablo\" is on the opposite end of the visual spectrum from \"Warcraft\"."}

He was the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Seven%20Suns\"&gt;Order of the Seven Suns&lt;/a&gt; that were sworn to protect the naaru who lent its grace to shield &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Darkstorm\"&gt;Darkstorm&lt;/a&gt;. Greydon was to choose whoever he deemed worthy of wielding the blade. Although his brother &lt;a href=\"Malus\"&gt;Silverlaine&lt;/a&gt; was the superior swordsman, Greydon kept the blade for himself. He saw it as a symbol of his leadership, but Silverlaine was furious. While Greydon admitted that Silverlaine was worthy, he denied the blade to him because of pride and jealously. They argued endlessly until it tore their bond apart. One day, however, Silverlaine stole the blade from his brother's quarters and went alone to fight the naaru's enemy, the &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Xaraax\"&gt;Xaraax&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt; minions.\nWith the sword in hand, Silverlaine was outnumbered, and at last, Xaraax tempted him to his side, promising him great power and greater revenge in exchange for switching sides with the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s. Xaraax's worm tongue worked its charm and persuaded the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; that the naaru and his brother would discard him. Weakened by anger, Silverlaine accepted Xaraax's offer. Silverlaine returned to the order, and its members had no idea about the betrayal. Silverlaine then murdered the naaru with the Diamond Blade. The impact shattered the blade, and the shards of it were scattered across Azeroth. With it, the order was also shattered, but the Darkstorm didn't come.\nYears after the event, a mysterious &lt;a href=\"Voice%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Voice of the Light&lt;/a&gt; spoke to Greydon. It told him that the blade could be reforged and that it contained the essence of the naaru. This was the reason the Darkstorm didn't come; as long as the naaru existed in some form, it couldn't come. As such, Greydon had to leave &lt;a href=\"Thorne\"&gt;his family&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Lakeshire\"&gt;Lakeshire&lt;/a&gt; behind and set out to find the crystal shards, restore the naaru and stop Xaraax and his Darkstorm. He also couldn't allow the shards to fall into the enemy's hands, including his brother, who now bore the name Malus.\nFor the next five years, Greydon was looking for the shards with his magical compass that directed him towards the crystal shards. In the meantime, Malus became the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Hidden\"&gt;Hidden&lt;/a&gt;, under Xaraax, who pursued Greydon. Both assembled crews and obtained ships, the \"&lt;a href=\"Wavestrider\"&gt;Wavestrider&lt;/a&gt;\" and the \"&lt;a href=\"Inevitable\"&gt;Inevitable&lt;/a&gt;\", respectively. The Voice of the Light eventually told Greydon to also get his son, &lt;a href=\"Aramar%20Thorne\"&gt;Aram&lt;/a&gt; who too was part of this quest. Greydon immediately didn't tell his estranged son about the crystal shards, or the blade, or the naaru. Greydon and Aram spent half a year on the ship, journeying across Azeroth. As they were in &lt;a href=\"Desolace\"&gt;Desolace&lt;/a&gt; and journeyed to &lt;a href=\"Feralas\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt;, the Hidden attacked and destroyed the Wavestrider and captured Greydon. Before being captured, he managed to give Aram and &lt;a href=\"Makasa%20Flintwill\"&gt;Makasa Flintwill&lt;/a&gt; his compass and set them to the coast of Feralas. Journeying through the forests of Feralas, the flooded Thousand Needles, and the desert of Tanaris, facing off against Malus and the Hidden, Aram and Makasa made new friends and found crystal shards with the compass. As the first three crystals were found, they merged perfectly, creating the hilt of a sword.\nAs Greydon was presumed dead by the children, from &lt;a href=\"Charnas\"&gt;Charnas&lt;/a&gt; they learned about Aram's mysterious uncle named Silverlaine who was last seen in the Stonetalon Mountains. Although the compass was pointing towards Lakeshire, the travelers decided to find answers. With his new allies, Aram was transported to the mountains where Aram eventually ended up facing Malus once again, revealing his true identity to them. The Hidden captured Aram too, and Malus took the hilt and the broken compass. Unbeknownst to Malus, the compass needle was actually left behind and was soon found by Makasa.\nAlthough Makasa wanted to rescue Aram, she knew she had to continue their quest. Knowing the last direction was Lakeshire, Makasa and her companions traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. There, she used the compass' crystal and the Voice of the Light's guidance to locate the remaining crystal shards. As she and her allies found them, the crystal shards reconstructed into a blade. As Makasa held the blade, she recalled her friends and allies to gather at the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; and set out to attack the &lt;a href=\"Hidden%20citadel\"&gt;Hidden citadel&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; where Aram and Greydon were held captive, and Malus had the hilt of the Diamond Blade.\nAs Makasa's army attacked, Xaraax sensed the blade nearing. Malus came to Xaraax to his sanctuary, but the nathrezim &lt;a href=\"demon%20lord\"&gt;demon lord&lt;/a&gt; turned on him and attacked because he ran out of its usefulness. He took the hilt of the Diamond Blade from his body and proceeded to get the Hidden to the top of the citadel. There, Makasa and &lt;a href=\"Reigol%20Valdread\"&gt;Reigol Valdread&lt;/a&gt; made their way and fought against &lt;a href=\"Throgg\"&gt;Throgg&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Karrga\"&gt;Karrga&lt;/a&gt; but lost. The two ogres dragged the family to Xaraax. The &lt;a href=\"sand%20troll\"&gt;sand troll&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Zathra\"&gt;Zathra&lt;/a&gt; approached Makasa to retrieve the blade. As she took it, she quickly dropped it because it was too hot for her. Soon, the hilt from the demon lord's hands soared to the blade, the weapon reforging itself and becoming whole. A shocked Throgg dropped Makasa who leaped at the weapon. With the weapon and Voice of the Light in her hands and head, she charged at Xaraax. The Highlord, however, had a weapon on his own, a &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; sword matched the Diamond Blade, knocking it from Makasa's hands. Immediately, the arakkoa &lt;a href=\"Ssarbik\"&gt;Ssarbik&lt;/a&gt; enveloped her with &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20%28magic%29\"&gt;shadow magic&lt;/a&gt;, and Xaraax went to drop his fel blade and grab the Diamond Blade. He corrupted the hilt, and the dark power started to creep upon the blade.\nXaraax, preparing to destroy the naaru and release the Darkstorm upon Azeroth, did not expect that the broken Malus would hurry to take the dropped fel sword and stab Xaraax into his back and through his chest. Losing the Diamond Blade, Malus tossed the impaled dreadlord into the altar that swallowed the Highlord. As Malus was feeding the Darkstorm, Valdread slipped Karrga and kicked the Diamond Blade towards Makasa. She quickly grabbed the weapon of the Light and blocked Malus' attack. The twisted &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; now called reinforcements and continued fighting. As fel and Light clashed, the roof exploded, the black vortex of the Darkstorm growing quiet for a moment.\nSoon, the tide turned in favor of the &lt;a href=\"child\"&gt;child&lt;/a&gt;ren, defeating most of the Hidden and the demons. The two &lt;a href=\"Thorne\"&gt;Thorne&lt;/a&gt; brothers faced each other, with Malus almost gaining the upper hand, but ultimately it was Makasa with her Diamond Harpoon, and with the assistance from Aram, that ultimately faced Malus - the defeated Malus gathered his last strength to toss his fel sword at Makasa, but Aram used his new-found &lt;a href=\"Nature\"&gt;druidic&lt;/a&gt; power to blast the fel blade away, giving Makasa the opening to leap and strike Malus fatally. The roiling black vortex that was the Darkstorm raged for a moment before it dissipated completely.\nWith the naaru was restored and resting, Makasa broke the weapon and gave each of the party one shard to hold. They agreed that no one should wield the weapon. Makasa took the largest shard, the hilt, to Stormwind, where she told King Varian that the blade had been shattered beyond repair in the battle against Malus. Greydon told them to hide their pieces and guard their secrets. When the travelers reunited at the &lt;a href=\"Forever%20Tree\"&gt;Forever Tree&lt;/a&gt;, Aram buried his crystal shard in the ground at the base of the Tree. The tree's roots then buried the shard deeper.\nDescription and abilities.\nAlthough incomplete, the weapon could be used in battle. From the hilt emerged a beacon of pure, shining Light when facing Malus. It could also summon a ripple of Light and heat blasting out from it in every direction. The reforged blade was warm, almost too hot to hold comfortably. It dissolves bolts of shadow on approach. In Makasa's hands, the reforged Diamond Blade expanded and contracted, the hilt lengthened, the sharp end curved until it resembled a harpoon, humming with readiness in her grasp."}

You must establish a base and bolster your forces. Only aided by Ghouls and Meat Wagons will you be able to break through the Paladins' defenses.\"\nBattle.\nArthas gathered his forces on the outskirts of Andorhal in preparation for recovering the remains of the Necromancer Kel'Thuzad. The Cultists provided him with several Meat Wagons, which would both preserve and transport Kel'Thuzad's remains. When Arthas asked why they couldn't simply resurrect Kel'Thuzad on the spot, the Cultists explained that they needed a powerful nexus of magic to raise a being of Kel'Thuzad's power.\nArthas led his forces to Kel'Thuzad's grave. Along the way, they encountered some resistance from the Champions of Peace. The undead easily overwhelmed these humans and arrived at the grave. The Paladin Gavinrad the Dire, who was guarding the site told Arthas to stop this madness before it was too late. Arthas ordered Gavinrad to stand aside. Gavinrad instead attacked the undead. He was no match for Arthas and the Scourge warriors and was slain. As Arthas entered the graveyard, he suddenly heard the disembodied voice of Kel'Thuzad. A ghostly apparition of Kel'Thuzad then appeared before the Death Knight. The necromancer had clearly been expecting him.\nKel'Thuzad's remains were exhumed and loaded into a meat wagon. However, when Tichondrius inspected the remains, he informed Arthas that they were so badly decomposed, that they would never survive the journey to &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;. The power of the High Elves' Sunwell was needed to resurrect Kel'Thuzad. Tichondrius told Arthas that he would have to steal a special urn from the nearby Silver Hand camp. The urn would protect the remains.\nArthas found a nearby goldmine and established a base. The Acolytes summoned the necessary buildings from Northrend while ghouls harvested lumber. Eventually, Arthas's forces were strong enough and he led them into battle. To reach the Silver Hand camp, they had to fight their way through a town protected by the Champions of Light and the Champions of Truth. The Paladin Ballador the Bright confronted Arthas and told the fallen Prince that he deserved a \"gruesome death\" for his treachery. Arthas defeated Ballador and left him for dead.\nAs Arthas moved deeper into the town, he encountered another paladin Sage Truthbearer who rebuked Arthas for repaying Uther's loyalty like this. Although the paladin was considerably more powerful than the first two, Arthas triumphed again. He slew Sage Truthbearer and looted a pair of Gloves of Haste from paladin's corpse. These magical gloves allowed Arthas to wield the &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt; with greater speed. \nFinally, Arthas arrived at the Silver Hand camp where he found Uther waiting. Uther angrily told his former student that he had destroyed his father's kingdom in a matter of days. Arthas told him to hand over the urn. Uther was disgusted. The urn contained the late king's ashes. Arthas didn't care and engaged Uther in battle. Uther proved to be an incredibly powerful foe. He used his skills and magics to slay many of Arthas's minions. Inevitably, however, he fell before the death knight and the numerous undead warriors. In his dying moments, Uther expressed hope that there was a special place in Hell waiting for Arthas. Arthas's reply was that they may never find out as he intended to live forever. The death knight retrieved the urn, emptied it, and placed Kel'Thuzad's remains inside.\nTichondrius appeared again and congratulated Arthas. Kel'Thuzad's ghost appeared as well, although only Arthas was aware of his presence. Kel'Thuzad told Arthas not to trust Tichondrius. The Dreadlords, he explained, were the Lich King's jailors. Kel'Thuzad promised to tell Arthas everything once he had been resurrected."}

{"id": "81821", "revid": "39299307", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=81821", "title": "Nexus", "text": "The Nexus is the ancient fortress of the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, found in the center of &lt;a href=\"Coldarra\"&gt;Coldarra&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Borean%20Tundra\"&gt;Borean Tundra&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. With a network of ice caves underneath, comprising its base, there are rings of floating land stacked upward in a great column over the island, rotating about a massive beam of pure arcane energy. That beam shot into the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; and opened rips in reality itself.\nThe Nexus is where &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt; and his dragonflight gathered all that arcane energy during the &lt;a href=\"Nexus%20War\"&gt;Nexus War&lt;/a&gt;. After Malygos's death, the Nexus stayed standing, though the blue dragonflight was scattered.\nHistory.\nThe blue Dragon Aspect, &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt;, was charged ages ago by the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s as the guardian of magic. During the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, he watched in horror as &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; all but wiped out the blue flight before scattering the remaining dragons away. Already knowing what would happen next, &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Krasus&lt;/a&gt; infiltrated Malygos' lair in order to safeguard some of the now-abandoned blue eggs, fighting the magical constructs protecting the caverns. Malygos soon came back, and, maddened by grief, withdrew deep into the Nexus. He would pay little heed to the rest of the world for millennia thereafter.\nApproximately four thousand years later, a group of &lt;a href=\"Shandaral\"&gt;Shandaral&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"sorcerer\"&gt;sorcerer&lt;/a&gt;s infiltrated the Nexus in order to learn their secrets about magic. The Highborne succeeded in learning the dragons' techniques, but their greed drove them to steal &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Focus\"&gt;powerful artifacts&lt;/a&gt; as well. The theft triggered the Nexus's magical wards, sending the few surviving blue dragons into a frenzy. The Highborne thieves managed to escape, but the dragons took their retribution on Shandaral.\nAluneth.\nAt some point, while manipulating the fabric of reality, the blue dragons tapped into another &lt;a href=\"Plane\"&gt;realm of existence&lt;/a&gt; and made contact with a strange &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; entity called &lt;a href=\"Aluneth%20%28entity%29\"&gt;Aluneth&lt;/a&gt;. They were so intrigued by Aluneth's existence that they summoned the entity into Azeroth for further study. Aluneth immediately went on a rampage through the Nexu, destroying countless rare artifacts and tomes of power before finally being contained. Rather than becoming angry about the destruction, they were delighted by Aluneth's capricious nature. After years of conducting harmless experiments on Aluneth, the blue dragons had satisfied their curiosity and sent the entity back to its own realm. Many years later Aluneth would became bound within the &lt;a href=\"Aluneth\"&gt;greatstaff&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardian of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt;. Following the death of &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt; gave the staff to the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;, who stored it in the &lt;a href=\"Nexus%20Vault\"&gt;Nexus Vault&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the Second War.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Korialstrasz&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; visited Malygos' sanctum. There he saw frozen corpses of &lt;a href=\"ice%20troll\"&gt;ice troll&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"wendigo\"&gt;wendigo&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s, an &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;elf&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; that had been left there by the Dragon Aspect. Korialstrasz finally convinced Malygos to emerge from his lair by telling him that it finally seemed possible to avenge Deathwing's terrible crime. Though the Demon Soul was destroyed, Deathwing survived, and Malygos returned to his long solitude.\nThe Nexus War.\nAfter the reopening of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragon\"&gt;blue dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tyrygosa\"&gt;Tyrygosa&lt;/a&gt; brought &lt;a href=\"Zzeraku\"&gt;Zzeraku&lt;/a&gt; and other &lt;a href=\"nether%20dragon\"&gt;nether dragon&lt;/a&gt;s to the Nexus in order for them to recuperate through its energies. However, the Nexus' power was so great that they decided to claim the Nexus for themselves. They started to drain all its energy, declaring that they would never be enslaved to the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s or anyone again. &lt;a href=\"Arygos\"&gt;Arygos&lt;/a&gt; and the blue dragons intervened to defend the Nexus, but it was &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt; who, awakening from his seclusion, destroyed the nether dragons and absorbed back their energies. In doing so, his eyes were fully opened to the state of the world once more.\nHaving finally returned fully to his senses, Malygos quickly assessed the state of magical affairs in Azeroth and reached the grim conclusion that magic was running amok throughout the world. He blamed this dangerous development on the mortal races and their reckless pursuit of magical power. Determined to forestall a catastrophe, Malygos decreed that the world's unbridled magic must be reined in by any means necessary. He turned to the &lt;a href=\"Arcanomicon\"&gt;Arcanomicon&lt;/a&gt;, a map of the world's &lt;a href=\"ley%20line\"&gt;ley line&lt;/a&gt;s gifted to him ages ago by the titan &lt;a href=\"Norgannon\"&gt;Norgannon&lt;/a&gt; that had been continuously updated and revised by the blue dragonflight.\nMalygos used the Arcanomicon to locate and tap into the ley lines, diverting the magical powers that course beneath the earth to the Nexus. There, the energies were focused through the Nexus' ascending rings and blasted into the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;. Malygos's redirection of the ley lines carried disastrous consequences, however, splintering the world's crust and opening unstable rifts: tears in the very fabric of reality. Directing so much of Azeroth's arcane energy through the Nexus also affected the structure itself: a massive dimensional rift was torn open within the caverns, spawning arcane anomalies into its halls and transforming the &lt;a href=\"Singing%20Gardens\"&gt;Singing Gardens&lt;/a&gt; and its guardians into crystalline beings.\nMalygos' siphoning of the world's magic did not go unnoticed by the mortal races. The &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; used their waning powers to transfer the entire city of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; to float above Northrend. Furious at what he perceived to be the mortals' willful disregard for the future of the world, Malygos declared war upon them, beginning the conflict known as the &lt;a href=\"Nexus%20War\"&gt;Nexus War&lt;/a&gt;. However, not all of the Kirin Tor stood united. Several members instead opted to side with the blue dragonflight in the hopes of retaining power. Transformed and bolstered by Malygos, these &lt;a href=\"mage%20hunter\"&gt;mage hunter&lt;/a&gt;s were tasked with rooting out and, if necessary, destroying magical artifacts; killing or imprisoning individuals who practice magic without Malygos' permission; and aiding in the redirection of ley lines using massive constructs called &lt;a href=\"surge%20needle\"&gt;surge needle&lt;/a&gt;s. Many of them were invited into the Nexus itself to continue their work and guard it against intrusion.\nThe blue dragonflight's increasingly militaristic methods were also condemned by the &lt;a href=\"red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;. Charged with the preservation of life, they vowed to neutralize Malygos and formed a council with the Kirin Tor to subvert Malygos's devastating campaign. During the course of the war, Malygos imprisoned the red dragon &lt;a href=\"Keristrasza\"&gt;Keristrasza&lt;/a&gt; within the Nexus, intending to force her to become his new consort. The Kirin Tor and Red Dragonflight eventually laid siege to the Nexus, allowing the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; to breach its halls and defeat many of Malygos's strongest allies. In the end, &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s entered the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Eye of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; to battle Malygos himself. Though the Aspect unleashed his arcane might upon them, with aid of Alexstrasza they ultimately killed Malygos, ending the Nexus War but leaving the Blue Dragonflight bereft of leadership.\nCataclysm.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tarecgosa\"&gt;Tarecgosa&lt;/a&gt; escorted an adventurer through the Nexus. It was patrolled by servants of &lt;a href=\"Arygos\"&gt;Arygos&lt;/a&gt;. At the same time, &lt;a href=\"twilight%20dragon\"&gt;twilight dragon&lt;/a&gt;s led by &lt;a href=\"Thyrinar\"&gt;Thyrinar&lt;/a&gt; attacked the interior. The dragons were defeated, and a vision of Arygos' betrayal was shown. Although they didn't initially consider it real, the twilight dragonflight later trapped Kalecgos just outside the Nexus, only for Tarecgosa to break their spell and die during the process.\nThrall: Twilight of the Aspects.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20Deathwing\"&gt;war against Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, the Nexus was visited by &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;. It was also the place where the blue dragons gathered for the &lt;a href=\"Embrace\"&gt;Embrace&lt;/a&gt; to determine who among Arygos or &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; shall be the next Blue Aspect. When Arygos was revealed to work with &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;'s minions, entered the Nexus, killed Arygos, and activated the &lt;a href=\"Focusing%20Iris\"&gt;Focusing Iris&lt;/a&gt; with his blood, harnessed the Nexus's arcane energy through surge needles and used the power to revive &lt;a href=\"Chromatus\"&gt;Chromatus&lt;/a&gt;.\nTides of War.\nDeciding that the Focusing Iris needed to be placed somewhere safe, a squad of blue dragons tried to escort it from the Eye of Eternity to the depths of Azeroth's ocean. However, agents of the Horde killed the entire squad and stole the artifact. Kalecgos went out searching for it because of his former position as Aspect, but was unable to discover its location until the Focusing Iris was used to empower the mana bomb that destroyed Theramore.\nBecause of their diminished numbers, first from the War of the Ancients, then the Nexus War, and the Shattering, the blue dragonflight decided to go their separate ways. The few remaining blue dragons have scattered across the world, no longer affiliated with any organization.\nDawn of the Aspects.\nAfter the official disbanding of the blue dragonflight, Kalec remained behind in the Nexus for some time, despite having officially joined the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;. To protect the Nexus, magical wards powered by ley lines have been placed around the structure. They allowed entry only to blue dragons. When Kalec found a &lt;a href=\"Spark%20of%20Tyr\"&gt;lost artifact&lt;/a&gt; that had belonged to &lt;a href=\"Tyr\"&gt;Tyr&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Galakrond%27s%20Rest\"&gt;Galakrond's Rest&lt;/a&gt;, Kalec brought it back to the Nexus and witnessed painful visions of the Aspects' prehistoric battle with &lt;a href=\"Galakrond\"&gt;Galakrond&lt;/a&gt;, spending some time in his sanctum that was a gigantic cavern. Occasionally, other blue dragons besides Kalecgos would come to check up on the Nexus, including &lt;a href=\"Jaracgos\"&gt;Jaracgos&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; was worried about Kalec, she teleported to the Nexus and discovered an ancient artifact and realized that its magic has something to do with &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s. Kalec sensed someone so she teleported to the entrance to have Kalec think that she just arrived. After assuring that everything was all right, she teleported back to Dalaran. This prompted Kalec to strengthen the weak wards so that no one could enter the Nexus. During the process, he noticed that the artifact linked itself to each of the wards.\nJaina later returned here with newfound knowledge and noticed the wards' power. She was able to use her knowledge on them to counter the magic. As she did that, the Nexus erupted in an explosion of white and lavender energy, and shook the structure. After a while, the magical resistance subsided, the wards and the Nexus returning to their original states, and Jaina was able to once again teleport inside and eventually free Kalec from the artifact. After Kalec reminded Aspects of who they were and transported Jaina to Dalaran, he returned to the Nexus to ascertain whether there were any lingering aftereffects from the artifact's presence.\nLegion.\nFor a long time, Kalec has not returned to the Nexus. During the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, he sent a &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; there in search of &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Wrath\"&gt;Light's Wrath&lt;/a&gt;, a dangerous item created by the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; that the Kirin Tor had entrusted to the blue dragons some time before it was disbanded, and a &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; adventurer in search of &lt;a href=\"Aluneth\"&gt;Aluneth&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful staff once wielded by Aegwynn. The Nexus has since become the home of &lt;a href=\"ethereal\"&gt;ethereal&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Ethereum\"&gt;Ethereum&lt;/a&gt; who seek the blue dragons' treasures. &lt;a href=\"Azuregos\"&gt;Azuregos&lt;/a&gt;, who was at the Nexus to retrieve those same treasures, helped the adventurers stop &lt;a href=\"Nexus-Prince%20Bilaal\"&gt;Nexus-Prince Bilaal&lt;/a&gt;. Afterward, Azuregos stayed behind to secure the Nexus so it will not fall into the wrong hands again and said to give his regards to Kalecgos.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Oculus\"&gt;Oculus&lt;/a&gt; section of the Nexus was later invaded by the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; before &lt;a href=\"Belgaristrasz\"&gt;Belgaristrasz&lt;/a&gt;, with the help of the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;adventurer's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Class%20Hall\"&gt;followers&lt;/a&gt;, successfully fended them off.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Kathra%27natir\"&gt;Kathra'natir&lt;/a&gt; used the power of the Nexus, along with the &lt;a href=\"Nightborne%20Soulstone\"&gt;Nightborne Soulstone&lt;/a&gt;, to drain &lt;a href=\"Meryl%20Felstorm\"&gt;Meryl Felstorm&lt;/a&gt;, the Tirisgarde attacked the Burning Legion and Kathra'natir at the Nexus. After the battle, they trapped him within the soulstone.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, a group of &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; mages arrived at the top of the Nexus and assisted Kalecgos with charging a &lt;a href=\"Charged%20Scale%20of%20the%20Blue%20Aspect%20%28quest%20item%29\"&gt;Scale of the Blue Aspect&lt;/a&gt;.\nDragonflight.\nThe Nexus remained in the care of &lt;a href=\"Azuregos\"&gt;Azuregos&lt;/a&gt; for the next five years. After the reawakening of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;, Kalecgos released the essence of &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sindragosa\"&gt;Sindragosa&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Veiled%20Ossuary\"&gt;Veiled Ossuary&lt;/a&gt;, but it also awakened violent arcane memories, that appeared in the Nexus proper too. The area was defended by its keeper Azuregos, but soon Kalecogs, Sindragosa's simulacrum, and an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; arrived at Coldarra. Taking &lt;a href=\"%3AAzuregos%27s%20Staff\"&gt;:Azuregos's Staff&lt;/a&gt;, the adventurer fought off the memories at the entrances into the Nexus. Azuregos then remained here to investigate the memories further, but eventually left to aid his brethren at &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt; and ultimately the &lt;a href=\"Azure%20Archives\"&gt;Azure Archives&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the spirits of Malygos and Sintharia were put to rest, Azuregos resolved to study the &lt;a href=\"Azure%20Vault\"&gt;Azure Vault&lt;/a&gt;, so &lt;a href=\"Surigosa\"&gt;Surigosa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zeros\"&gt;Zeros&lt;/a&gt; offered to look after the Nexus.\nIn the RPG.\nOriginally the Nexus was exclusively &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt;'s lair, but has expanded considerably as other &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragon\"&gt;blue dragon&lt;/a&gt;s choose to live near their leader and partake of his wisdom. The Nexus is an extensive series of caves and tunnels that riddles the island of &lt;a href=\"Coldarra\"&gt;Coldarra&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvery space has been carved and smoothed so that it seems more like a castle buried in ice than a natural formation. The walls are ice and crystal, and cast rainbows of light from small glowing gems set in strategic locations; most flat surfaces are carved to show dragons in various activities. The floors are solid stone, polished glass-smooth and, mirror-bright. No stairs exist \u2014 in many places, an archway opens onto a vast open chamber and the dragons simply fly across to another portal placed somewhere on the other side. The outermost chambers are dotted with lifelike ice statues \u2014 or so it seems. These statues are the remains of uninvited guests, transformed by &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; and placed here as a warning. The caves themselves are fascinating, and many have unusual magical properties. Some of the rooms may actually change."}

He is the final boss of &lt;a href=\"Mana-Tombs\"&gt;Mana-Tombs&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Auchindoun\"&gt;Auchindoun&lt;/a&gt;.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"Convinced that vast riches lay within the depths of the Mana Tombs, Nexus-Prince Shaffar has spent untold amounts of his own considerable fortune to move an army into the shadowed halls of this crumbling ruin, and to keep competing ethereals out. The prince's greed knows no bounds, and he has vowed to uncover the mysteries of the Mana Tombs or die trying.\"\nStrategy.\nNexus-Prince Shaffar starts with three Ethereal Beacons surrounding him. These must be killed quickly or an Ethereal Apprentice will spawn in its place. Depending on how many damage-dealing classes the party consists of, each member should be assigned one beacon to kill. Each beacon has approximately 2600 health. Additional beacons will spawn one at a time as the fight progresses and should also be killed. Shaffar will yell, \"I have such fascinating things to show you!\" when one appears. This happens approximately every 10 seconds, so be ready for one even if he does not yell. If a beacon is not killed quick enough, an apprentice will spawn in its place. The apprentice can be crowd-controlled if necessary, such as being &lt;a href=\"polymorph\"&gt;polymorph&lt;/a&gt;ed by a &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;. The apprentices do not have much health and can be killed, but they inflict a lot of fire and frost damage very quickly if not dealt with immediately. When there are no beacons or apprentices to deal with, players should focus their damage on Shaffar.\nNexus-Prince Shaffar does not deal a lot of physical melee damage, but does deal a lot of spell damage: fire, frost, shadow, and arcane. &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt;s can use &lt;a href=\"Resistance%20Aura\"&gt;Resistance Aura&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s can cast &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Protection\"&gt;Shadow Protection&lt;/a&gt; to minimize incoming spell damage, also his spells can be reflected with a &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Reflection\"&gt;Spell Reflection&lt;/a&gt;. He occasionally casts Blink. This does not clear aggro and he will not teleport far away. However, he often casts &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Nova\"&gt;Frost Nova&lt;/a&gt; to snare players in melee range just before he &lt;a href=\"Blink\"&gt;Blink&lt;/a&gt;s, allowing him to cast spells uninterrupted. Warriors are able to use Spell Reflection to minimize spell damage taken. The tank must be ready to run toward him and maintain aggro when Frost Nova wears off or is removed, though aggro is generally not an issue because the other players will also be focusing their damage on the Ethereal Beacons.\nIf the party consists of primarily melee classes, players should stay near Nexus-Prince Shaffar. This ensures players will not have to run far from Shaffar to be able to attack the Ethereal Beacons and then resume attacking him.\nHeroic mode.\nThis fight is extremely difficult in Heroic mode compared with the rest of the instance. The beacons turn into apprentices much faster and spawn with 7000 hits (you may have trouble in killing all initial beacons before they spawn), and new beacons are spawned at an increased rate. The fight is very difficult with certain group makeups, as it is extremely difficult to deal sustained melee damage to Shaffar because of his near-constant usage of both Frost Nova and Blink.\nIt is strongly recommended to \"not\" attempt to ignore the adds (an effective strategy in some other similar fights), as they pile up very quickly and their damage output will overwhelm almost any group well before Shaffar can be taken down. Because they appear in semi-random locations around the room, it is difficult to chain-fear them (although a Warlock can manage this to some extent, and &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Tongues\"&gt;Curse of Tongues&lt;/a&gt; will help to mitigate the adds' damage while they are not feared.) It is extremely difficult for any tank to hold enough aggro on all the adds, so your healer(s) will eventually be focus-fired down by the uncontrolled ones.\nIf your group have a Mage or Warlock, they can use their &lt;a href=\"Pyroblast\"&gt;Pyroblast&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Fire\"&gt;Soul Fire&lt;/a&gt; spell on one of the beacons at the start of the fight. The spells have a long cast time, and can be started before the boss is actually engaged. This will make the first beacon kill extremely quick.\nIt is very helpful to have all damagers focus on killing the initial wave of beacons/adds before starting to attack Shaffar. This eliminates a lot of the confusion at the beginning of the fight, as well as giving the tank time to build aggro.\nThe main thrust of the fight is sustaining relatively high DPS on Shaffar while killing and/or controlling the adds well enough that your healers are not overwhelmed. Shaffar uses multiple types of magic, so it is difficult to mitigate his attacks substantially by stacking resistance; healer mana usage generally becomes the limiting factor. A high-HP tank is preferable to one with a lot of avoidance/armor, as Shaffar deals comparatively little melee damage. Shaffar does not have that many hit points; if he gets below 20-25% health but your healers are running out of mana, you may be able to kill him by going all-out damage and simply ignoring the adds. Note that the adds do not despawn after his death, but it doesn't really matter if the group wipes at that point.\nMelee DPS is at a substantial disadvantage when fighting Shaffar. He uses his Frost Nova and Blink abilities very frequently to move out of melee range, and trying to track his movements can be extremely disorienting. It is strongly recommended to use melee damage on the adds and ranged damage on Shaffar if at all possible. These abilities also make Shadowfiend usage much more dicey, making the fight even tougher on a Priest healer.\nBecause Shaffar deals almost exclusively magical damage, a Warlock can effectively tank the boss while still dealing a large amount of damage through DOTs and holding aggro by using Searing Pain as much as possible (a Balance Druid or Elemental Shaman might also be able to pull this off with enough HP, although aggro might be an issue due to spell pushback reducing their DPS.) In this case, the \"conventional\" tank can be used to hold aggro on the adds while melee damagers kill the adds and ranged attack the boss.\nIf your party is still not strong enough to maintain damage on both adds and Shaffar you can attempt to continuously kill the Ethereal Apprentices until Nexus-Prince Shaffar has run out of mana. At this point, he is likely to be at greatly reduced health and unable to summon Ethereal Apprentices until he has regenerated enough mana to do so. This strategy relies more on your healer's mana regeneration. If you attempt Shaffar with this method, prepare to be fighting for approximately five to seven minutes.\nExternal links.\n "}

It is Volume 2 in \"&lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Wing\"&gt;Shadow Wing&lt;/a&gt;\".\nDescription.\nAs &lt;a href=\"Ragnok%20Bloodreaver\"&gt;Ragnok&lt;/a&gt; leads his &lt;a href=\"fel%20orc\"&gt;fel orc&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"nether%20dragon\"&gt;nether dragon&lt;/a&gt; army to the &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; Gates, &lt;a href=\"Jorad%20Mace\"&gt;Jorad&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tyrygosa\"&gt;Tyri&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; army prepare for the fight of their lives. But even if they defeat Ragnok, the battle is far from over as the nether dragons pose a more dangerous threat than even Ragnok. Will the spawn of &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; cause the destruction of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;?\nSummary.\nThe death knight Ragnok Bloodreaver has an ethereal device that he uses to control netherdrakes via energy-draining collars affixed to them. In Ragnok's attempt to take control of the Dark Portal, a wild spell from one of the drakes combined with the energy of the others strikes the Dark Portal, shutting it down. Ragnok is killed by Jorad Mace, who also destroys the device.\nWith the device smashed, the collars begin uncontrollably siphoning away the netherdrakes' energy. In an attempt to save the drakes, Tyrigosa opens a portal to Coldarra so that they can draw enough energy from the Nexus to burn out the collars and survive. The netherdrakes continue to draw more and more energy from the Nexus, intending to become so powerful that none will ever control them again. Malygos gets pissed off and starts vaporizing the netherdrakes for \"defiling the Nexus.\" The netherdrakes retort that they \"are\" the Nexus now. Malygos, in his insanity, reasons that the Nexus is the ultimate repository of arcane magic, and as he is the lord of arcane magic, thus if the netherdrakes are part of the Nexus then they must be part of himself. So he sends them \"back where they belong\" by absorbing them into himself. Clarity returns to Malygos as he absorbs so much energy into himself and he truly sees, for the first time in millennia, everything that has happened to the world, and especially to its magic. He goes off to consider what must be done.\nThe Dark Portal is restored to working order. Feeling guilty about essentially leading virtually the entire population of Outland's netherdrakes to their deaths, Tyrigosa returns to Outland to watch over the remaining eggs as they hatch. Zzeraku, the last surviving netherdrake from this incident, gets captured by an agent of Sinestra, leading into Night of the Dragon."}

Having regained his sanity after many millennia, the Blue Aspect concluded that the mortal races' apparent reckless use of &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; was a threat to the stability of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. As the Guardian of Magic, Malygos subsequently declared war on all whose use of magic he deemed improper, specifically the magocracy of the Kirin Tor. He then decided to realign the flow of magic to point toward &lt;a href=\"Coldarra\"&gt;Coldarra&lt;/a&gt;, where the &lt;a href=\"Nexus\"&gt;Nexus&lt;/a&gt; gathered all this &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; energy.\nEventually, the &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Accord\"&gt;Wyrmrest Accord&lt;/a&gt;\u2014a coalition of the other &lt;a href=\"dragonflight\"&gt;dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;s\u2014joined in the fight against Malygos and the blue dragonflight. With the aid of &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, as everyone had an interest in not allowing the world to be torn apart, they were able to successfully prosecute a war against the Spellweaver's forces, ultimately culminating in a battle with, and the death of, Malygos himself. The war caused much strife among the dragonflights and mortal races alike, and ultimately left the blue dragonflight leaderless. Its effects are far-reaching and its consequences can still be seen in Azeroth today.\nHistory.\nPrelude to the War.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;Blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; notoriously attempted to stop &lt;a href=\"Neltharion\"&gt;Neltharion&lt;/a&gt;, Dragon Aspect of Earth, when he betrayed the other &lt;a href=\"dragonflight\"&gt;dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;s using the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Demon Soul&lt;/a&gt; artifact. Before the blues could stop him, however, Neltharion\u2014forever after known as \"Deathwing\"\u2014used the incredible power contained within the Demon Soul to annihilate virtually the entire Blue dragonflight, Malygos himself being driven away wounded.\nFollowing these events, the Blue Aspect fled to his flight's lair on the continent of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, still reeling from the destruction wrought by the former Earth-Warder. His grief over losing his flight at the hands of one he once considered a close friend drove Malygos into a deep madness. Stewing in regret, he remained hidden and secluded for thousands of years, paying little to no heed to the goings-on in the rest of the world. During this time, he also neglected his duties as Aspect of Magic, no longer monitoring its use throughout &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nEventually, the Aspect was coaxed out of seclusion during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; and was convinced, by the &lt;a href=\"red%20dragon\"&gt;red dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Korialstrasz&lt;/a&gt;, to aid the other Aspects in their battle with Deathwing to once and for all end the corrupting influence of the Demon Soul. Having succeeded, Malygos began to gradually regain his former sanity, greatly helped by the Aspect of Life, &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;'s, promise to help the Blue dragonflight to be reborn, as well as the return of &lt;a href=\"Tyrygosa\"&gt;Tyrygosa&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"nether%20drake\"&gt;nether drake&lt;/a&gt;s she had liberated in &lt;a href=\"Netherstorm\"&gt;Netherstorm&lt;/a&gt;. Their nether-warped physiology greatly helped in Malygos's eventual recovery.\nAs he became his former self again, the Spellweaver also began to once more survey the state of magical usage throughout the world. He discovered that, during his absence, magic had greatly increased in proficiency and was now running amok. He subsequently placed the blame squarely on the various mortal races that had since arisen on the world during his ten thousand years of seclusion. Seeking a solution, Malygos turned to the &lt;a href=\"Arcanomicon\"&gt;Arcanomicon&lt;/a&gt;, the map of all of Azeroth's &lt;a href=\"ley%20line\"&gt;ley line&lt;/a&gt;s, granted to him by the &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Norgannon\"&gt;Norgannon&lt;/a&gt; when he first became an Aspect. Using the map to locate all of the world's ley lines, the Lord of Magic began to divert their energies into his domain\u2014the &lt;a href=\"Nexus\"&gt;Nexus&lt;/a&gt;\u2014on the island of &lt;a href=\"Coldarra\"&gt;Coldarra&lt;/a&gt; in Northrend's &lt;a href=\"Borean%20Tundra\"&gt;Borean Tundra&lt;/a&gt;. They were then channeled through the floating rings of the Nexus and blasted into the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;.\nPrior to the Nexus War, rifts that seeped magical energy opened up in &lt;a href=\"Coldarra\"&gt;Coldarra&lt;/a&gt;'s face and beneath the water around it, a sign of &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt;'s plotting that set off little quakes up and down the coast.\nWhat Malygos did not know was how much damage his plan would wreak if implemented fully. While the Pantheon had told the Dragon Aspects many things, what they did not tell them was that Azeroth held a &lt;a href=\"world-soul\"&gt;world-soul&lt;/a&gt;, a dormant titan. Malygos's campaign had upset the equilibrium of the world, sparking natural disasters from Northrend to the southern tips of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;. Unless something was done, these disasters would spiral out of control and cause irreparable harm to Azeroth's world-soul.\nThe battle lines are drawn.\nMalygos's actions led to rifts opening in the fabric of magic itself. His siphoning of the world's magic also did not escape the notice of the mortal races - particularly the remnants of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;, the elite magi of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;. Recognizing that Malygos had become a very real threat, the Kirin Tor used what remaining powers they had to magically transport the rebuilt city of Dalaran to the skies of Northrend, right on the front lines of both the &lt;a href=\"War%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;War against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, and the coming conflict with Malygos.\nHowever, some members of the Kirin Tor believed that allying themselves with the Guardian of Magic would be more beneficial and prudent. Betraying their own brethren, many of these mages were transformed and bolstered by Malygos himself to become the dreaded &lt;a href=\"mage%20hunter\"&gt;mage hunter&lt;/a&gt;s. Their duties now became killing or capturing those who wielded magic without Malygos's consent, destroying specific magical artifacts, and aiding in the redirection of ley lines using &lt;a href=\"surge%20needle\"&gt;surge needle&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAs the war began to pick up, Malygos's genocidal campaign began to incur the ire of its former allies, the &lt;a href=\"red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, charged by the Titans to preserve life. Alexstrasza, the Red Aspect, subsequently allied her dragonflight with the &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s of the Kirin Tor in their efforts against the blues. Along with the Red flight, the entire &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Accord\"&gt;Wyrmrest Accord&lt;/a&gt; decided to unite with those opposing the Spellweaver, bringing the &lt;a href=\"Green%20dragonflight\"&gt;Green&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bronze%20dragonflight\"&gt;Bronze&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Black%20dragonflight\"&gt;Black&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"dragonflight\"&gt;dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;s into the conflict.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; called upon the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; to aid them against &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos the Spell-Weaver&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; during the Nexus War, &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Highlordord Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; were not inclined to accept the idea of \u200b\u200bdiverting resources from the conflict against the Lich King. Eventually, they accepted because they were also threatened by Malygos' actions, and members of the Alliance and the Horde aligned themselves with the Kirin Tor and its allies to put an end to the threat.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Champions&lt;/a&gt; of these two proved pivotal in the eventual frustration of Malygos's plans in the Borean Tundra and &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt;. At some point during the conflict, the &lt;a href=\"Ethereum\"&gt;Ethereum&lt;/a&gt;, an organization of militant &lt;a href=\"ethereal\"&gt;ethereal&lt;/a&gt;s, negotiated a deal with Malygos, whereby they would aid the Blue dragonflight in the war in exchange for a promise to be allowed access to the flight's powerful treasures.\nEnd of the Nexus War.\nThroughout the brutal conflict, the Blue dragonflight battled with its enemies in the western regions of Northrend, eventually failing to overcome the coalition arrayed against them. The final blow against Malygos's forces was struck by members of the Horde and Alliance. Upon the defeat of the &lt;a href=\"frost%20wyrm\"&gt;frost wyrm&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sapphiron\"&gt;Sapphiron&lt;/a&gt; in the heart of &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Key%20to%20the%20Focusing%20Iris\"&gt;its key&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Focusing%20Iris\"&gt;Focusing Iris&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Eye of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; (Malygos's inner sanctum) was recovered. The key was promptly delivered to Alexstrasza herself, who imbued it with her power, recognizing this as an opportunity to lure Malygos into battle. With the power of the Aspect of Life, it could now be used to open the way to the Spellweaver's lair.\n&lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Korialstrasz&lt;/a&gt;, Prime Consort of Alexstrasza, made a crucial request to the Alliance and Horde &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;heroes&lt;/a&gt; who would take on the responsibility of confronting Malygos: that the Blue Aspect be slain, and the powerful &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Magic\"&gt;Heart of Magic&lt;/a&gt;, Malygos's most prized possession, be recovered as proof of the deed. With everything now in place, the assault on the Eye of Eternity began. Having confronted Malygos, a vicious battle now ensued between the dragon and his mortal adversaries, who were eventually joined by &lt;a href=\"drake\"&gt;drake&lt;/a&gt;s of the Red dragonflight. Ultimately, Malygos was defeated, by Alexstrasza, with a lot of help on the ground. In his last breath, Malygos was questioning the reasoning of Alexstrasza's actions, imploring her to see that mortals would destroy everything. Shortly after Malygos's death, Alexstrasza arrived and declared that the Nexus War had officially concluded.\nAftermath of the Nexus War.\nIn the wake of Malygos's death in the Eye of Eternity, and the subsequent result of the war, the Blue dragonflight found its future uncertain. Others, such as Alexstrasza and Korialstrasz, express deep regret and discomfort at Malygos's demise, citing that he was ultimately one of the world's most powerful guardians. Korialstrasz himself remarked that \"\"Magic is now without its guardian\" and that \"A storm is brewing on the horizon and now we are without one of our most powerful defenders\"\".\nAfter the war's conclusion, the Blue dragonflight apparently joined the &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Accord\"&gt;Wyrmrest Accord&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; acting as its ambassador in &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe position of Aspect of Magic remained a major power vacuum for some time to come. Eventually, it caused a great divide among the Blue dragonflight, with Malygos's son, &lt;a href=\"Arygos\"&gt;Arygos&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; contending for the position. Ultimately, Arygos was revealed as a servant of &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, and the position is filled by Kalecgos. This particular effect of the Nexus War almost caused disaster during the war against Deathwing during the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;.\nMalygos's deal with the &lt;a href=\"Ethereum\"&gt;Ethereum&lt;/a&gt; would eventually lead to the organization attempting to plunder powerful treasures from within the &lt;a href=\"Nexus\"&gt;Nexus&lt;/a&gt; during the . Seeking to become &lt;a href=\"void\"&gt;void&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"ethereal\"&gt;ethereal&lt;/a&gt;s began using the &lt;a href=\"surge%20needle\"&gt;surge needle&lt;/a&gt;s from the Nexus War in &lt;a href=\"Coldarra\"&gt;Coldarra&lt;/a&gt; to bore into the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; and call on void energies. After &lt;a href=\"Nexus-Prince%20Bilaal\"&gt;Nexus-Prince Bilaal&lt;/a&gt; is defeated by an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Azuregos\"&gt;Azuregos&lt;/a&gt;, Azuregos remains in the Nexus so that its power will not fall into the wrong hands again.\nOne member of the Kirin Tor, &lt;a href=\"Normantis\"&gt;Normantis&lt;/a&gt;, who had lost many of his friends during the war, was eventually ousted from the organization and started hunting blue dragons in the name of vengeance. This quest would lead him to &lt;a href=\"Azsuna\"&gt;Azsuna&lt;/a&gt;, and he would eventually be slain by his former allies as they rescued &lt;a href=\"Zeros\"&gt;Zeros&lt;/a&gt;."}

{"id": "72832", "revid": "41171629", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=72832", "title": "Ni Karma", "text": "Ni Karma is a roll bonus system, that is also zero-sum (i.e., points leave the system at about the same rate they enter). \"Karma\" can be thought of as \"favor of the loot gods\", where it skews loot towards those with the most favor. You get this favor by attending raids, and lose it when winning items. Specifically the term \"DKP\" is avoided because karma does not really act as currency. But for those that love the idea of DKP, they can hoard points and then it DOES act as currency... but items can become quite expensive in this case.\nDesign goals.\nNi Karma (or NKS) was designed to solve the following issues well:\nDetailed description.\nName.\nThe system is officially called the Ni Karma System (or NKS), to distinguish it from &lt;a href=\"DKP\"&gt;DKP&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"zero-sum%20DKP\"&gt;zero-sum DKP&lt;/a&gt;, and other &lt;a href=\"Loot%20system\"&gt;loot distribution systems&lt;/a&gt;. (Karma can be thought as \"favor of the loot gods\" as the more you have, the more it skews loot towards you. It should not be equated to currency or DKP.)\nNew members.\nNew raiders start with 0 karma. Karma scores can never drop below zero (but this is configurable). If a penalty or enforced expenditure (by the minimum cost rule below) would bring a score below 0, it is set to zero instead.\nEarning Karma.\nThe following is a list of possible ways to earn karma. This list should be understood as an example, each raid using this system is encouraged to tweak it any way they like.\none simple and elegant alternative would be\nIt is possible for &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt; leaders to hand out bonuses to the entire raid, if a raid spends significant time to progress/learn how to defeat a new &lt;a href=\"boss\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt;. Karma may also be individually granted to those filling in empty slots to help the raid succeed.\nAs with all standard DKP systems, guild leaders need to pay attention on how much karma enters the system. If too few points enter the system, veteran raiders will be at a disadvantage, if too many points are awarded, veterans gain too much of a lead. For speed and to smooth out the extremely lucky rolls, rollers have to be within 50 points of the highest karma use. The leader should consider how many more raids/hours/commitment one person needs in order to completely lock out a new player on a loot drop, by having over 50 more points. A good starting factor would be 2-3 raids, which equates to about 10 hours. This means that people who have done 10 hours of raiding more than someone else, do not have to roll against them because they will have at least 50 more karma. Therefore, the karma entering should be approximately 5 points per hour, or about 20 karma per raid. This is a good value for fairness' sake. Spikes, such as special awards for new boss kills, won't harm the system, but continuously awarding too much karma will have a detrimental effect.\nDistributing Loot.\nWhen an item drops, the &lt;a href=\"master%20looter\"&gt;master looter&lt;/a&gt; first announces which classes and/or builds are eligible to compete for the item. Eligible raid members have now three choices: pass, roll without bonus, or roll with bonus.\nIf nobody with a karma score of 50 or more is willing to use their bonus, the loot master may open the item to other classes/off-specs at his discretion. If nobody is willing to use a bonus of 50 or more, in the end all raid members able to use the item are allowed to participate in the roll.\nMembers choosing to add their karma bonus to their rolls must use it fully -- no partial amounts.\nIf the item is won by someone using their bonus, their karma cost is [half their karma rounded up to the nearest multiple of 5].&lt;br&gt;(eg. Karma = 82. Cost is 82 / 2 = 41 --(rounded up)-&gt; 45. Final Karma = 82 - 45 = 37.)\nThere is no karma loss if none was used by the winner (except for class items - see next).\nClass set items always cost at least 25 karma, and at most 100 karma.\nThere is no such min/max loss cap on multi-class items. This is configurable, but imposing a maximum cost will affect the zero-sum property.\nAfter announcing the usage of bonus, those people whose used bonus is 50 points below the highest used bonus are excluded from the roll. If the highest karma used is 50 or lower, anyone eligible may roll with or without karma.\nMulti-class items are distributed first, then class items for consistency. (Any BOE's picked up on the way will also be distributed after boss loot.)\nTies are decided by a straight /roll with no bonuses.\nIf only one person was interested in the item at all, they get it as though they declared \"no bonus\", even if they did declare \"with bonus\".\nKarma is kept separately for each character and cannot be transferred (except when you are requested to bring an alt character, you may apply that karma to your main character).\nLosses for wins are immediate. Karma is added at the end of the night, or after loot distribution of each boss kill, if feasible. There exists a &lt;a href=\"http%3A//wow.curse-gaming.com/en/files/details/2636/ni-karma-system/\"&gt;UI mod&lt;/a&gt; to track karma continually.\nIf you are told not to compete for an item by an officer, you may not roll. This may be invoked in cases of multiple defaulted/free items being won by one person who then tries to roll on other things, or other situations that seem highly \"unfair\". Members are expected to not be greedy, but they are also expected to not collude. Members should generally spend karma on every item they actually want.\nExamples and comments.\nOne thing no system can solve is the issue of vastly unlucky class drops. The loss cap of 100 points and the minimum of 25 points fixes much of this, however.\nThe sliding tier window eliminates the extremely-lucky person from competing with someone who has a much higher bonus -- but only if that person uses his bonus. Ex: Person A has a high bonus of 150 and persons B, C, D have relatively low bonuses (70, 40, and 30). If Person A wanted to use her karma, she would win it outright since nobody else is within 50 points (and thus, ineligible to roll). If 'A' declines to use her bonus then the choice goes to 'B'. If 'B' uses his bonus, everyone with 20+ karma may roll with bonus (and A may not roll, since her bonus is zero by choice). If B passes too, the option will go to C. Since C is less-than-or-equal to 50 points, everyone may roll with their declared bonus, including A and B (with a 0 bonus). If Person C used bonus of 40, he'd have far more chance of winning against those not using bonus. This demonstrates how those that save bonus will generally be the last to receive items but get the first pick at new items. The sliding tier eliminates some of the annoying disappointment if both A and B wanted the item... A has way more karma than B, but could potentially lose without the sliding tier.\nRemember that there's still a minimum 25 point loss on all class items, whether bonus was used or not, and a maximum loss of 100 points. That means it's the players best interests to roll with bonus on class items if their bonus is 50 or lower, because they're going to lose 25 points when winning no matter what. The plugin actually forces a 50-point \"bonus\" roll on class items if they have the karma, due to the 25 point minimum cost for class items.\nEach person needs to decide how they want to use their points... saving them gives first pick and is much like purchasing the items, but items tend to cost more and will reduce the number of items won. Players following this strategy will get items either very early (when using karma), or late (without using karma).\nSpending karma quickly, on the other hand, gives more items cheaper, but only if the others don't want them. It's more random, and will never result in winning a high-end, top-of-the-line drop. Many times, you won't even get to roll on something you want, but many times you'll get very cheap items.\nThis duality is a big strength, where karma is more like currency (dkp) when saving, and more like a roll bonus (karma) if not. But the objective a loot system is to be \"fair\", so loot masters should use sound judgment when people are rolling on items for many different roles.\nOne rule used by the Knights who say Ni, which is not directly related to the system: For each instance, new members need to attend at least one previous run where at least one boss was killed in that instance before they get to roll on any items from that instance. The only exception is if they are the only person that can use the item.\nThe plugin is highly configurable. The Knights have recently added a 10 point minimum cost to help prevent people fishing for items for no karma, and only if nobody wants it for 10, drop the cost to zero. We normally allow people to pass to the next highest person, but if an item goes for free, it's only to prevent sharding... thus no passing to the next-highest roll is allowed in that cast.\nAlso unrelated directly to the system: The Knight who say Ni allow members to move karma between &lt;a href=\"alt\"&gt;alt&lt;/a&gt;s, with some restrictions. For instance, people may move &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Core\"&gt;Molten Core&lt;/a&gt; karma over 200 to &lt;a href=\"BWL\"&gt;BWL&lt;/a&gt; karma at a rate of 20%. Ex: Someone has 325 molten core karma. He can move 125 of it and get credited 25 points of BWL karma. This is some incentive for experienced players to help out in MC, since it will give them karma in BWL. It's not meant to replace going to BWL, but merely an incentive to continue attending MC.\nAcknowledgments:\nQed was a co-designer of this system and did a lot of the number crunching and theory. He is a fan of zero-sum and proved how this system \"tended towards zero-sum\" (although it is not strictly so). I'd like to thank the officers of the Knights who say Ni on Icecrown for their input, including a lot of work coming up with other possible systems, and the entire Ni guild for being so patient as we worked out the kinks"}

In the operas, the \"Nibelung\" are a race of dwarves.\nThe effect portion of the staff could be seen as a slight reference to the Valkyrie Profile games by Square-Enix as Nibelung Valesti was the signature finishing move of the series' most memorable characters; Lenneth, Hrist, and Silmeria Valkyrie."}

Niby refers to people as insects and expects them to bow down to him. He was also notably incompetent. He keeps an &lt;a href=\"imp\"&gt;imp&lt;/a&gt; as his &lt;a href=\"warlock%20minion\"&gt;minion&lt;/a&gt;, named &lt;a href=\"Impsy\"&gt;Impsy&lt;/a&gt;, who holds him in an extremely low opinion.\nHistory.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nNiby the Almighty originally found in &lt;a href=\"Felwood\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt; holds a vendetta against the people of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;, for exiling him. As such, he seeks to summon an especially almighty demon to wreak his revenge. Occasionally, Niby will attempt to summon this demon unaided, resulting in nothing but a mild explosion. Consequently, Impsy criticizes Niby's inexperience, resulting in a short chase between the two. Despite his incompetence, aspiring warlocks are sent to him to learn how to summon an &lt;a href=\"infernal\"&gt;infernal&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpon turning in the quest &lt;a href=\"Kroshius%27%20Infernal%20Core%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Kroshius' Infernal Core (quest)&lt;/a&gt;, Niby used a demonic core to attempt another summoning. This time, he succeeded to some extent, producing an over-sized demonic chicken named &lt;a href=\"El%20Pollo%20Grande\"&gt;El Pollo Grande&lt;/a&gt;. While Impsy found the summoning most amusing, Niby was at first surprised, but then regained his composure and assured himself that Stormwind City will see its death from the summoned chicken. Unsurprisingly, this did not come to pass, though apparently the chicken did go on a rampage large enough for it to be heard of down in &lt;a href=\"Gadgetzan\"&gt;Gadgetzan&lt;/a&gt;.\nIcecrown Citadel.\nNiby the Almighty has relocated to &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Light's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; within &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, where he sells the &lt;a href=\"Tier%2010\"&gt;Tier 10&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Coven%27s%20Regalia\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; for warlocks.\nUnlike in Felwood, he doesn't insult those who speak to him. \nCataclysm.\nHe is nowhere to be seen in Felwood, having left at some point. Strangely enough, however, Impsy remained behind, and now apparently works for or with the &lt;a href=\"satyr\"&gt;satyr&lt;/a&gt;s. \nWarlords of Draenor.\nThough he doesn't appear, Impsy does, apparently still his minion, despite Impsy appearing to work for the satyrs in Felwood at the time of the Cataclysm. Impsy still holds him in extremely low regard, still seeing him as incompetent.\nQuests.\nNiby is part of the quest chain where &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s gain their &lt;a href=\"Infernal%20%28warlock%20minion%29\"&gt;infernal&lt;/a&gt;, wherein he does nothing but talk down to the player for their inferior abilities in fel arts while his imp mocks him openly.\nQuotes.\nSilence, servant!

The power of Tirisfal was also implanted in the child, yet it wasn't to awaken until he reached physical maturity.\nDeath.\nAegwynn left the baby Medivh in the care of his father and his people at Stormwind Keep. On the eve of Medivh's &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Ascension\"&gt;Age of Ascension&lt;/a&gt;, Medivh awoke to fevered dreams, and sought his father. Upon merely touching the boy, a backlash of energies poured from the child, and only the combined powers of a hundred clerics and the Conjurer himself were able to properly contain him. Medivh and Nielas were locked in a magical trance for hours or possibly days, before, finally, they both collapsed. Nielas was dead, drained of all life, and Medivh was in a deep sleep. Medivh was taken to &lt;a href=\"Northshire\"&gt;Northshire&lt;/a&gt; to be tended by the Clerics.\nTrapped in Karazhan.\nNielas Aran is dead, but he does not slumber peacefully in death; a boss called the &lt;a href=\"Shade%20of%20Aran\"&gt;Shade of Aran&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 a white-haired human mage - appears in the &lt;a href=\"Guardian%27s%20Library\"&gt;Guardian's Library&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;'s tower of &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt;. It has been confirmed that this &lt;a href=\"ghost\"&gt;ghost&lt;/a&gt; is in fact that of Nielas Aran, though how he became trapped in his son's tower is unknown. After arriving in Karazhan, he took Medivh's journal from &lt;a href=\"Kamsis\"&gt;Kamsis&lt;/a&gt; and now carries it with him.\nWarrior: United.\nAt some point, his ghost was approached by &lt;a href=\"Loania\"&gt;Loania&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lieren\"&gt;Lieren&lt;/a&gt; looking for their father &lt;a href=\"Dougan\"&gt;Dougan&lt;/a&gt;. Furious, he attacked them and try to manipulate only to be saved by the ghost of Dougan. Aran commented that he is forever trapped in the tower, always shifting.\nLegion.\nA vision of Medivh accidentally killing Nielas is seen in the dining hall of Karazhan.\nIn the RPG.\nNielas Aran is described as an &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20of%20Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Archmage of Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpeculation.\nRelatives.\nJudging from his surname, &lt;a href=\"Fordred%20Aran\"&gt;Fordred Aran&lt;/a&gt; might be related to Nielas Aran.\nSpirit.\nIt is possible, considering that it was well known that mysterious visions lurked the halls of Karazhan, that Nielas' spirit was drawn to the tower because of a vision experienced by &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; decades before - showing Nielas and Aegwynn shortly after Medivh was conceived."}

{"id": "162054", "revid": "32055379", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=162054", "title": "The Long March (WC3 Orc)", "text": "The Long March is chapter 2 of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Invasion%20of%20Kalimdor\"&gt;Invasion of Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; campaign.\nLoading screen.\n\"Two days later, upon the desolate plains of the Barrens...\"\nChapter Two.\nThe Long March\n\"Two days later, upon the desolate plains of the Barrens...\"\nStrategy.\nThroughout the mission, waves of centaur will assault the caravan from the front and the back, sometimes simultaneously, sometimes separately. As the caravan progresses closer to the final oasis, the composition of attack waves and their point of origin changes (the game difficulty also affects this). In order to progress the caravan, it must not be under attack, and Thrall must be sufficiently far ahead of the caravan along the main path. If you are quite a ways away from the caravan and it is not moving, it is likely because Thrall is off on a side path rather than the main route. Although there are numerous points along the main path at which the attack waves are modified, there are two points that are most notable.\nShortly after the first oasis.\nThere is a region starting shortly after reaching the first oasis where periodic attacks will cease altogether. This region's starting point is along the dark road leading northwest from the oasis, and its end point is along the dark road leading west past the cave along the northern wall (if you cross a large pointy rock along the cliff above the walkable path you are crossing beyond the edge of this region). An easier way to tell if you're in this area is to wait until you cross the shallow water just past the first oasis and stop by the time you reach the cave. As long as the caravan does not move from this area, new attack waves will not spawn. You may still be attacked by attack waves that spawned while you were approaching the region and have not yet reached the caravan, but once defeated they will not replace themselves until the caravan moves forward.\nWhen the caravan reaches this spot, you can take advantage of it by backtracking and exploring any area off to the side of the main path before the first oasis that you had skipped along your journey without fear of leaving the caravan undefended. You can also use the opportunity to heal your units at the oasis in case they did not have time to finish before the caravan moved off, or they were wounded at any point after reaching the oasis. This is also a good opportunity to use any Healing Wards; since the caravan will remain stationary and unprovoked here, they will receive the greatest benefit from their healing aura.\nAlternatively, you can take advantage of the fact that the caravan will only follow Thrall, and leave him behind while sending your other units ahead to clear out the main road and side paths. Note that they will be unable to collect any items from this venture until Thrall follows them to pick them up himself, and Thrall will gain no experience from kills that take place too far away from him (although he is likely level-capped by this point anyway). You will still earn gold bounty from creeps slain with this method. Once you have finished exploring to your satisfaction, return all your units to the oasis to re-heal them once last time before moving Thrall and the caravan ahead out of the \"safe-zone\" and triggering the periodic attacks to resume.\nShortly after the goblin merchant.\nThe second region of note makes its start as you leave the dark-brown-colored dirt heading north past the goblin merchant and step foot upon the not-so-dark-brown-colored dirt with the cracked ground. Once the caravan reaches this point (roughly halfway into the mission), attack waves from the front will stop spawning. As before, any previously spawned waves will continue along their merry way until they are dealt with, but they will not be replaced. Attacks continue to spawn from the rear, but the way ahead is threatened only by pre-placed units which can be scouted in advance with ease (raiders and Thrall's Far Sight are good for this). This behavior persists for the remainder of the mission, though the composition and frequency of rear attacks will continue to change as the caravan advances to its final destination.\nWhat this means for you is that you can station your troops at the rear of the caravan most of the time and move Thrall ahead when you plan to advance the group. If an attack comes while Thrall is attempting to move the caravan, your units are already in position to defend the caravan, and only Thrall needs to run back (which is much easier for him to do without a group of slower-moving grunts in his way). You can also change your method of exploring the side paths by passing them with the caravan first, then backtracking to explore them. By \"parking\" the caravan outside these side paths, it is much easier to return to it should it be attacked while you are distracted. Unfortunately, Cairne continues to position himself at the front end of the caravan, so even though he is the most durable of the tauren units, he is unlikely to be the one targeted by the centaur.\nCatapults and towers.\nWhen you reach the second oasis you rescue a group of Warsong catapults. These are best used against the centaur towers, but the towers are almost always defended by centaur who will counterattack as soon as you open fire. To account for this, when you reach a tower, move one catapult into position, and station your troops near it. Fire the catapult and immediately pull it back to safety while your troops engage the centaur counterattack. Take care to fight the centaur outside the range of the towers. Also be cautious about leaving your catapults behind the caravan as they will be open to attack from periodic attackers. Once the centaur guarding the tower are dead, bring the catapults back into position and safely destroy the towers from outside their attack range. Although the catapults do meaningful damage to centaur units, they should be reserved for the towers only. The catapult splash damage will harm friendly troops and enemies alike (except when targeting buildings), and if they \"help out\" against the centaur, they are likely to severely weaken or kill your grunts, or worse, the tauren defending the caravan.\n\"Reforged\" Changes.\nThere are two major changes in \"Reforged\" that can help the player in completing the mission. First is that Kodo Beasts are now treated as organic units instead of mechanical in the original. This allows them to heal with items like &lt;a href=\"Scroll%20of%20Healing\"&gt;Scroll of Healing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Healing%20Ward%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Healing Wards&lt;/a&gt; and with the Fountain of Life at an oasis. The second are consumable items now stacking in a single slot. Because of this, Thrall doesn't have to sacrifice any additional item slot when stopping by the Goblin Merchant, and can stack multiple Scrolls of Healing to keep allied troops alive."}

Prior to \"&lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;\", this letter was sent by &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne&lt;/a&gt; instead, and still retains his signature.\nCataclysm changes.\nWith the changes brought by &lt;a href=\"the%20Shattering\"&gt;the Shattering&lt;/a&gt;, the Loremaster meta-achievement also changed. New achievement \u2013 &lt;a href=\"Loremaster%20of%20Cataclysm\"&gt;Loremaster of Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; was added, and both &lt;a href=\"Loremaster%20of%20Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Loremaster of Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Loremaster%20of%20Kalimdor\"&gt;Loremaster of Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; changed to meta-achievements similar to those from Outland and Northrend, and contain specific zone loremaster achievements . \nThose who achieved Loremaster prior to Cataclysm retain the achievement and all that comes with it without having to fulfill the new requirements. Also, if the quests in a particular zone were not reset with the expansion (especially in Outland and Northrend) then the character automatically gained the achievement for that zone if he/she had already fulfilled the requirements for it. Otherwise, the new zone achievements are available to pre-\"Cataclysm\" Loremasters to do if they wish.\nLoremaster in Mists of Pandaria.\nRather than a certain number of quests, the zones on &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; require that the player completes the story line for the entire zone. Each piece of the story chains into the next, so it is easier to keep track of one's progress through the zone and does not require players to go looking for that one quest that's in an isolated area and easily overlooked. Completing the achievements for all the zones yields &lt;a href=\"Loremaster%20of%20Pandaria\"&gt;Loremaster of Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs with Cataclysm, players who received the Loremaster achievement prior to this expansion keep the title and rewards that go with it, though they can still get the zone- and continent-wide achievements for completing each zone's story line.\nLoremaster in Warlords of Draenor.\nMuch like &lt;a href=\"Loremaster%20of%20Pandaria\"&gt;Loremaster of Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, the achievements for &lt;a href=\"Loremaster%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Loremaster of Draenor&lt;/a&gt; requires completing all the storylines in each zone, rather than completing a certain number of quests. Loremaster of Draenor is also one of the requirements for &lt;a href=\"Draenor%20Pathfinder\"&gt;Draenor Pathfinder&lt;/a&gt;."}

It is widely considered to be the easiest fight in SSC, earning it the nickname \"The Loot Below\". \nIn order to start the fight, raid members must fish in the \"Strange Pool\" (needs +300 &lt;a href=\"fishing\"&gt;fishing&lt;/a&gt; skill). Each cast has a chance to make the Lurker come to the surface. The success rate of this ranges from 1-2 attempts up to fishing for 8 minutes straight. Some people claim that hitting the center of the pool has a higher chance to summon the Lurker, but this is not confirmed.\nIn death, the Lurker Below, made its way to &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxus\"&gt;Maldraxxus&lt;/a&gt;, where it is found close to &lt;a href=\"Vashj\"&gt;Baroness Vashj&lt;/a&gt; at a lake in the southernmost part of the zone.\nPhases.\nThis encounter alternates between two phases. The Lurker is only active for Phase 1, which lasts 120 seconds. At the start of Phase 2, Lurker submerges and the adds are spawned. After 60 seconds of Phase 2, the Lurker re-emerges and goes back to Phase 1.\nPhase 2 adds.\nSix ambushers and three guardians spawn at the start of phase 2. All forms of &lt;a href=\"crowd%20control\"&gt;crowd control&lt;/a&gt;, except &lt;a href=\"mind%20control\"&gt;mind control&lt;/a&gt;, work on all adds.\nCoilfang Guardian: \nCoilfang Ambusher:\nPositioning.\nThe Lurker requires only one tank; having an off-tank makes it safer. The tank should stand in the inner ring with his back to the pillar to help prevent the knockbacks. Everybody else should spread out to minimize damage from Geyser. Melee damage dealers should stand as close to the inner edge of the platform as possible, so that the 5-yard Whirl knockback doesn't drop them into the water. Healers should stand at the outside limit of the ring to make it easy to step back into the water to avoid Spout. Ranged damage dealers can stand on the outer platforms.\nPhase 1.\nThe combat starts with the Lurker on the surface. It's rather straightforward tank and spank, except for Spout and Whirl. Aggro is hardly an issue\u2014as long as there are targets in melee range, the Lurker does not attack ranged targets except for a random Geyser now and then. The Lurker can also be taunted. After two minutes, the Lurker submerges (which also removes all debuffs from him), adds turn up and Phase 2 starts. The Lurker re-emerges 60 seconds later and Phase 1 starts again.\nSpout.\nSpout is the main reason for wipes on this boss; the whole raid has to learn how to avoid it. Boss mods usually give a 3-second warning, and it's best to immediately jump in the water when the warning comes up. Ranged DPS and healers can continue to do their job while in the water by swimming a little deeper to gain line of sight. After the beam has passed, it's safe to return to the platforms. The tank and everybody close to him need to pay attention\u2014the beam starts at the tank and rotates for a little more than 360\u00b0. Each spout is closely followed by a Whirl.\nAdvanced techniques have the melee group run in a circle around the platform to avoid the beam (while still dealing damage). It's also possible to blink through it, or to use &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Block\"&gt;Ice Block&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Shield\"&gt;Divine Shield&lt;/a&gt;. It should be noted, however, that melee can continue to DPS during a spout by jumping forward into the water immediately surrounding Lurker. This will allow them to maintain more consistent DPS than if they are running in a circle, and the damage they take is very minor provided that they jump back out of the water as soon as the spout passes.\nSpout does not affect pets.\nWhirl.\nThe second problem during Phase 1 is Whirl. If the entire melee group is knocked away from the Lurker, he starts to deal severe ranged damage to the raid. Thus a tank needs to avoid the Whirl, and be back in melee range ASAP.\nBoss mods normally give a warning before a Whirl is incoming. The best solution is to have the MT jump into the water closer to the Lurker. In this case, the knockback brings him back onto the platform without ever leaving melee range. Alternatively, it's possible to back out of melee range before a Whirl and quickly move back in right after.\nTo make the fight safer, additional tanks can try to do the same as the MT. Since the Lurker can be taunted, it's rather easy to control him once a tank is in melee range.\nIt is possible to have a tank in the water the whole time. This makes him immune to Spout, and he doesn't have to be alert on Whirls. The water inflicts about 380 damage per tick, but the bigger problem is that there may be line-of-sight problems for the healers. To avoid the LOS issue, the MT healers can stay under water, too. One shadow priest in their group is enough to keep their health and mana up. When using this technique, everybody must be alert to exit the water during phase 2.\nWhirl deals only about 1k of damage to pets, and no knockback.\nGeyser.\nSometimes the Lurker will randomly target someone in the raid for Geyser, which deals 2.5k-3.5k frost damage and knockback (10 yards) to the target and those nearby. Spread out to avoid having too many people hit by Geyser.\nPhase 2.\nEach time the Lurker submerges, he spawns a total of nine adds: two ranged &lt;a href=\"Coilfang%20Ambusher\"&gt;Coilfang Ambusher&lt;/a&gt;s on each outer platform, and three melee &lt;a href=\"Coilfang%20Guardian\"&gt;Coilfang Guardian&lt;/a&gt;s on the inner ring. All these adds can be &lt;a href=\"Crowd%20Control\"&gt;Crowd Control&lt;/a&gt;led.\nUsually, each platform has one group of the raid assigned to clear the &lt;a href=\"Coilfang%20Ambusher\"&gt;Coilfang Ambusher&lt;/a&gt;s, while the melee group deals with the &lt;a href=\"Coilfang%20Guardian\"&gt;Coilfang Guardian&lt;/a&gt;s. Each of the groups should use CC and kill their adds. Mages should note that these mobs cannot be polymorphed until they are standing in their place; trying to sheep them as they are nearing the islet results in an error message. When the platform groups are done with their packs, they need to help on the Guardians.\nThe Ambushers can basically be tanked by any class (the more armor the better). There is one dangerous effect to be aware of: If an Ambusher gains aggro on a healer (or damage dealer) on another platform, he starts to evade until the healer comes over onto their island. If the Lurker emerges while an Ambusher is still evading, the Lurker despawns.\nSimilarly, the Guardians can gain aggro on raid members on other platforms, but they simply teleport and attack in this case.\nOne minute after submerging, the Lurker comes back whether or not all adds are dead. After re-emerging, he starts out with a sequence of Whirl, Spout and another Whirl. It's very difficult to master this while there's an add around. The best bet is to keep the add CC'd until after the sequence (or even longer).\nAlternate strategy #1 for phase 2.\nNew &lt;a href=\"Coilfang%20Guardian\"&gt;Coilfang Guardian&lt;/a&gt;s spawn on the transition to phase two only to replace dead Guardians from prior spawns. Thus it's possible to keep the Guardians sheeped (or otherwise CC'd) during the whole fight. Of course, Guardians breaking their CC can mean a one-shot death for the mage, followed by the healers in the raid, so it is important to refresh sheep every 15\u201320 seconds. The mages should also be &lt;a href=\"soulstone\"&gt;soulstone&lt;/a&gt;d.\nOn top of that, hunters can put a freezing trap on the outer platforms, at the points where the &lt;a href=\"Coilfang%20Ambusher\"&gt;Coilfang Ambusher&lt;/a&gt;s enter. This way the raid has to deal with at most three mobs at the same time, making the healers' job much easier.\nAlternate strategy #2 for phase 2.\nThis strategy is similar to Alternate strategy #1. Our raid found that sheeping the Coilfang Guardians resulted in dead mages, so we took on the oppisite approach. We sheeped the Coilfang Ambushers instead and killed the Coilfang Guardians. That kept our mages alive and kept the dps going.\nRezzing.\nIt is possible to use &lt;a href=\"Levitate\"&gt;Levitate&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Water%20Walking\"&gt;Water Walking&lt;/a&gt; while rezzing, but the rez targets may quickly die again from the Scalding Water. A second healer should be ready to immediately get the rezzed players health up again and/or have the priest cast on the newly rezzed target before healing them again.\nTips.\nAs the Scalding Water debuff deals Fire damage, Mages can use Fire Ward to lessen the damage they take during Spouts.\nBugs.\nThe Lurker can get into a state where he does a constant Spout even though there is no casting bar and he still uses his other abilities. It occurs when the last add dies during a Spout. To not have the bug happen ensure that the final add is killed before or after a Spout, NOT during. This is supposed to be fixed in an upcoming patch. See the blue posts in http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=105971962&amp;pageNo=1&amp;sid=1#0 for more information\nThere is also a current bug where the melee adds can spawn on the various islands and one- or two-shot the DPSers. This occurs when someone uses a consumable while the adds are moving into position. The aggro generated causes the melee adds to teleport to the island where the aggro originates as they're coming in, and it looks like they're spawning on that island. As long as no one uses any consumables (that includes bandages) until the tanks have aggro on melee they will not bug out.\nAt the start of the Burning Crusade a bug existed where if the Lurker Below was killed while casting spout, the boss could be looted, and after a &lt;a href=\"Instance%20reset\"&gt;Soft Reset&lt;/a&gt; it would respawn. Many guilds used/abused this bug to farm the boss repeatedly."}

Many of the quests in this chain require travel in &lt;a href=\"Dustwallow%20Marsh\"&gt;Dustwallow Marsh&lt;/a&gt;, and one requires venturing into &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Monastery\"&gt;Scarlet Monastery&lt;/a&gt;. Other than the limitations those elements require, all the quests in the chain can be undertaken at level 30.\nThe Mage's Wand.\nYour trainer announces that you are ready to earn your mage's wand. You are instructed to go to the hermit &lt;a href=\"Tabetha\"&gt;Tabetha&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dustwallow%20Marsh\"&gt;Dustwallow Marsh&lt;/a&gt;, and given rough directions of where to find her.\n\"As a mage character, you have been able to use a wand from level 1. This wand, then, is 'special'. As well as being powerful for your level, this may well be the first wand you acquire that has attributes other than simply doing damage.\"\nDustwallow Marsh is a perilous place (for you), but you manage the trip to &lt;a href=\"Tabetha%27s%20Farm\"&gt;Tabetha's Farm&lt;/a&gt; and meet with her. To craft your wand, she says, she will need two separate things.\nThe bolt-charged bramble.\nTabetha directs you to go to &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands\"&gt;Arathi Highlands&lt;/a&gt; and assemble a &lt;a href=\"Bolt%20Charged%20Bramble\"&gt;Bolt Charged Bramble&lt;/a&gt; out of &lt;a href=\"Witherbark%20Totem%20Stick\"&gt;Witherbark Totem Stick&lt;/a&gt;s and a &lt;a href=\"Jade\"&gt;Jade&lt;/a&gt;, charging it on the &lt;a href=\"Stone%20of%20Outer%20Binding\"&gt;Stone of Outer Binding&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe trolls don't give up their totem sticks willingly, but you gather up the required number. You're barely able to set them on the stone before they are struck. Recovering from the shock, you quickly grab the charged bramble (carefully!) and return to Tabetha. She cheerily calls your encounter with the stone \"good luck\". You sincerely hope so.\nThe book of power.\nTabetha directs you to talk to &lt;a href=\"Magus%20Tirth\"&gt;Magus Tirth&lt;/a&gt;, and ask him for a copy of the book.\nYou're glad to get out of the marsh, but somewhat less so when you feel the striking heat at the &lt;a href=\"Mirage%20Raceway\"&gt;Mirage Raceway&lt;/a&gt;, where Magus Tirth has retired to a life of boozing and gambling on the races.\nTabetha had warned you that Tirth was no longer at the top of his game, and on first setting eyes on Tirth, you can agree. He's willing to help, but... he's forgotten the magic phrase to open his own lockbox. But he was a Famous Mage, and he had an assistant to remember things like that for him. Unfortunately, the assistant isn't anywhere around. (By the way, would you like to buy a chicken?)\nTirth sets you off to find his assistant and recover the phrase to open the box.\nYou scour the raceway looking for him, without success. Talking with the various bystanders and spectators leads you to talk to &lt;a href=\"Race%20Master%20Kronkrider\"&gt;Race Master Kronkrider&lt;/a&gt; at the finish line. Following on a tip from him, you find a nearby chicken and codice_1 it over to you.\nIt reveals itself as &lt;a href=\"%22Plucky%22%20Johnson\"&gt;\"Plucky\" Johnson&lt;/a&gt;, who has been hiding from Tirth this last while.\nYou return to Tirth and explain that Johnson is now a chicken. Tirth can't remember why he put a chicken curse on Johnson, though it was probably well deserved.\n... but that's okay, because the book wasn't in the lockbox anyway. He'd sold it to pay off gambling debts. Someone from the Scarlet Brotherhood had bought it. Tirth tells you that he probably took it back to his &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Monastery\"&gt;monastery&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt;, and that you'd need to look there for it.\nYou had heard of the fanatics at the Scarlet Monastery before. You gather a group of friends about you and set off for Tirisfal Glades. &lt;a href=\"Arcanist%20Doan\"&gt;Arcanist Doan&lt;/a&gt;, the monastery's librarian isn't eager to let the book go, but after martial argument with the monks you find and carry off the book.\nConclusion.\nHaving both the components she needs and the book with the incantations, Tabetha constructs a set of wands and offers you your choice of them.\nRewards.\nAside from the novelty of the quests and some incidental experience in completing them, the reward from this chain is the wand you select at the end.\nThe wands differ mostly in the type of damage they do. While there are minor differences in speed and damage, the &lt;a href=\"damage%20per%20second\"&gt;damage per second&lt;/a&gt; is almost equal between them."}

Humans taught dwarves how to write in &lt;a href=\"Common%20%28language%29\"&gt;Common&lt;/a&gt;, which was much simpler than runes; and over the years, dwarves altered the language into their own design. Dwarven looks like a weird hybrid of titan glyphs and human letters.\nDwarven names.\nIn dwarven culture, family names often indicate &lt;a href=\"clan\"&gt;clan&lt;/a&gt; names as well. They are lesser clans within one of the three main dwarven cultures. Some family names are derived from names of honor earned through some feat, which replace the family's true name. For example, &lt;a href=\"Falstad%20Dragonreaver\"&gt;Falstad Dragonreaver&lt;/a&gt;'s real name is Falstad Wildhammer. This shows that the new name could be passed on to their descendants, depending on the choice of the individual. Another example would be the members of \"Thunderaxe\", who joined the Dark Iron clan during the War of the Three Hammers, taking on the name \"Pikesplitter\".\nIronforge dwarves.\nDwarves typically have names reflecting the sturdy nature of their past. Many also have surnames that were earned by a member of the family in service during a quest or in a particular moment of notoriety or infamy that has now become part of a family legacy.\nWildhammer dwarves.\nWildhammers follow many of the same naming conventions as their Ironforge brethren, taking names that reflect noble ancestors. Wildhammer surnames recall great accomplishments of family members and clans.\nSelected Dwarven words (speculation).\nThis is the list of words created by the in-game language parser for the \"Dwarvish\" language, and is listed as language number six (word range 204-314, 1236) in the Language text file. \nIn the in-game translator, the language parser for Dwarvish shares similar words to Gnomish. \nNote: The language algorithm used by the in-game \"translator\" merely makes the words LOOK like Dwarven/Dwarvish. It does not actually use a specific dictionary. Therefore, translated in-game speech isn't true Dwarven.\nInspiration.\nDwarven has been the name for the languages of dwarves in many fantasy settings, including . It is also one of the standard languages in \"\". Outside of a few exceptions such as \"loch\" and several words from the opening lines to \"Beowulf\" (\"we\", \"gear\", \"dagum\", \"geardum\", \"gefrunon\", \"scyld\"), most Dwarven words do not have any real-life counterparts, although their phonology appears to have Celtic (\"Dun Morogh\", \"Gwyarbrawden\"), Germanic (\"Thandol\", \"Thor Modan\") and Semitic (\"Bael'gun\", \"Khaz Modan\") influences. This is in line with the archetypical dwarves of Tolkien's legendarium, which had Germanic-inspired names (frequently taken from Norse mythology), a Semitic-inspired language roughly based on Hebrew, and who would often be given Scottish or Irish accents in Tolkien's adaptations."}

Dwarven Homebrew is not a functional &lt;a href=\"alcohol\"&gt;alcohol&lt;/a&gt;ic &lt;a href=\"drink\"&gt;drink&lt;/a&gt; item.\nSource.\nDwarven Homebrew is the one and only token gift items that can be found inside a or a , given by Ironforge non-guards NPCs as part of the Love is in the Air event. (The Gift of Friendship contains only the token gift; the Gift of Adoration contains other functional gifts as well.) \nYou will need one free inventory slot or a current stack of less than 20 Dwarven Homebrews in order to remove a Dwarven Homebrew from its container. To remove the Dwarven Homebrew from its container, right click the Gift of Adoration or Gift of Friendship to open it. \nIngredient.\nIf you have five or more Dwarven Homebrews in your inventory, right clicking on any of them will consume five and create a &lt;a href=\"Case%20of%20Homebrew\"&gt;Case of Homebrew&lt;/a&gt;.\nNotes.\nInventory space.\nThe Gift of Adoration: Ironforge and Gift of Friendship: Ironforge container items do not stack. Opening your Gifts of Friendship: Ironforge should save inventory space, since the Dwarven Homebrew token gifts stack 20 high. It is generally useful to NOT &lt;a href=\"autoloot\"&gt;autoloot&lt;/a&gt; a Gift of Adoration container - the Love is in the Air event items quickly consume any available inventory space. If you have autoloot turned on, you can hold down the shift key while right clicking the Gift of Adoration to not autoloot it. You can then remove only the items that you need at the moment. \nBe careful when combining these into packages, the Dwarven Homebrew token gift item stacks 20 high, but the Case of Homebrew package item does not stack at all.\nIronforge non-guard NPCs.\nFor the Love is in the Air gift items given by non-guard NPCs, the race of the NPC, not the location, determines which city's gift item you get. &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20dwarf\"&gt;Dwarf&lt;/a&gt; NPCs give Ironforge gifts regardless of which of the participating cities they are in. \nThe &lt;a href=\"innkeeper\"&gt;innkeeper&lt;/a&gt;s, though they are non-guards and have hearts over their heads, do not give gifts.\nTransferability.\nThis is a &lt;a href=\"conjured\"&gt;conjured&lt;/a&gt; item.

The dwarves have embraced this new knowledge and delved deep inside themselves in search of hidden power left there by their creators. Most have discovered the ability to turn their &lt;a href=\"stoneform\"&gt;flesh to stone&lt;/a&gt; for limited periods, but a few have persisted to unlock further secrets - though none have yet discovered what the titans intended them to do with their abilities.\nTo become a dwarven avatar, an Ironforge dwarf must make a pilgrimage to a shrine to the titans (found in Bael Modan, and at most major dwarven excavations where titan artifacts have been discovered) and meditate undisturbed for three days without food or water. As he connects with the essence of the titans, the dwarven avatar learns to speak to the earth itself. With fists of stone and incredible strength, dwarven avatars make unarmed attacks with greater and greater force. As the dwarven avatar progresses, he makes these attacks with greater strength and power. A dwarven avatar\u2019s enhanced connection to earth and stone hones the stonecunning possessed by all Ironforge dwarves. This improves his ability to check for things such as sliding walls, stonework traps, new construction (even when built to match the old), unsafe stone surfaces, shaky stone ceilings and the like. Something that isn\u2019t stone but that is disguised as stone also counts as unusual stonework. The dwarven avatar can become nearly immovable, once he learns earthstance. He resists being bull rushed or tripped when standing on the ground. Experienced dwarven avatars, learn to draw upon the metaphysical power of the titans and channel it into greater physical strength. A dwarven avatar can harden his skin into stoneskin. Though all Ironforge dwarves can learn to turn their bodies to living stone, dwarven avatars learn to focus this ability to even greater effect. The dwarven avatar learns to project his own energies into the earth to shift and shape it to his will. The most experienced dwarven avatars unlock the greatest power of their titan heritage, acquiring the ability to transform their bodies into living iron.\nInspiration.\nThe inspiration for this class likely came from the &lt;a href=\"mountain%20king\"&gt;mountain king&lt;/a&gt; ability '&lt;a href=\"Avatar\"&gt;Avatar&lt;/a&gt;' in Warcraft III."}

The dwarven reciprocator is a brutal and intimidating weapon designed for use against charging opponents at close range. This weapon has proven ideal for dwarven tunnel delvers as well, since it can fill a hallway with enough lead to poison any pursuer permanently.\nTurning the crank once fires a single shot. Winding the clockwork crank around several times fires all five barrels in rapid succession. The dwarven reciprocator fires rifle bullets. Each shot consumes one ounce of gunpowder."}
{"id": "105679", "revid": "46586549", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=105679", "title": "Dwarven relations", "text": "This article explains dwarven relations with the other races.\nWith Alliance Races.\nIronforge is one of the strongest nations of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and dwarves and humans are two of the most closely politically tied races in all of Azeroth. Ever since the days of the &lt;a href=\"Arathor\"&gt;Arathor Empire&lt;/a&gt;, the humans and dwarves have been natural allies. Both have long shared many secrets of metal-smithing and engineering and discovered a common love for battle and storytelling. The dwarves and humans have frequently formed political alliances, and both are founding member races of the Alliance. Gnomes are great friends of the Ironforge dwarves. They have been allies for generations and often exchange ideas and inventions. Their bond is so great that they live in many dwarven settlements including &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; itself.\nRelationship of the Three Hammers.\n&lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard%20dwarf\"&gt;Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20dwarf\"&gt;Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt; all have tense and complex relationships. Dark Iron dwarves are despised and distrusted by both the Bronzebeard and the Wildhammer dwarves as they re-instigated hostilities with them a few years after the conclusion of the of the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;War of the Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt;. Years of war and betrayals have allowed bitterness and prejudice to fester among the clans. Naturally, both the Wildhammers and the Bronzebeards don't approve of the Dark Irons' underhanded and brutal ways and likewise, the Dark Irons distrust both the Wildhammers and the Bronzebeards as well. While the Bronzebeard dwarves and the Wildhammer dwarves both have common allies in the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, the Ironforge dwarves resent the Wildhammers' obstinate independent attitude, even more so now that they are co-governing Ironforge. The only things the three dwarven clans have in common is their love of battle and ale but I'm sure that even those will be subject to much debate among the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;Council of Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith Horde Races.\nTauren and dwarves have a rocky relationship as outlined below. The Dwarven style of digging and use of explosives angers the tauren. The dwarves likewise commonly refer to tauren as beasts. There is least one instance of individual friendship with the two hunters &lt;a href=\"Hemet%20Nesingwary\"&gt;Hemet Nesingwary&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Roon%20Wildmane\"&gt;Roon Wildmane&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe fact that we are dealing with various rogue elements out here leads me to believe we will need support from the King's Army. Not only will the excavation require military support, it would seem to my novice eye that the location of Bael Modan might be of strategic value to the Alliance considering the volatility of world politics in their current state.\nAlas, I have digressed. There is much work to be done beneath the rock. I have spent too much time writing and not enough digging...\nThe most notable incident was the destruction of the &lt;a href=\"Stonespire\"&gt;Stonespire tribe's&lt;/a&gt; villiage in the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Southern Barrens&lt;/a&gt; in the in response to the protests of the Tauren. Many tauren lost their lives or were forced off their ancestral lands during the ensuing battles. &lt;a href=\"Gann%20Stonespire\"&gt;Gann Stonespire&lt;/a&gt; is one of the few remaining villagers and member of the tribe that was lost to the dwarves, who seeks vengeance against them, for the deaths of his brethren and continued destruction of his ancestral lands with explosives and destructive machines. The dwarves have also rejected attempts at diplomatic resolutions.\nIn addition to the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt; dig-site, another outpost in &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt; outraged &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; the local &lt;a href=\"Bloodhoof%20tribe\"&gt;Bloodhoof tauren tribe&lt;/a&gt;, who believe the excavations are disrespectful to the &lt;a href=\"Earthmother\"&gt;Earthmother&lt;/a&gt;(which were proved correct by Cataclysm). The digging is enraging the kodos of &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn Cataclysm the tauren were proved correct as after the dwarves refused to listen to the warnings of the tauren and angered the spirits of the Land they were violently excavating on with explosives. The infuriated Earth spirits killed the Bael'dun miners and the tauren now seek to calm them.\nThe dwarves were involved in the destruction of &lt;a href=\"Camp%20Taurajo\"&gt;Camp Taurajo&lt;/a&gt;, having used Wildhammer mercenaries to firebomb the village.\nIn revenge for the dwarves destroying his home and killing his friends a second time, Gann parts ways with the Horde and blows up Bael'dun to avenge his tribe and Camp Taurajo.\nAngry at the death of his &lt;a href=\"Marley%20Twinbraid\"&gt;son&lt;/a&gt;, a scout pilot and amateur archaeologist, General Twinbraid mistakenly blames the goblins in &lt;a href=\"Frazzlecraz%20Motherlode\"&gt;Frazzlecraz Motherlode&lt;/a&gt; mine due to finding the corpse of a goblin helper of Gann. &lt;a href=\"General%20Twinbraid\"&gt;General Twinbraid&lt;/a&gt; then orders the player to attack the goblin miners, telling the player to \"Kill 'em All\" and to \"Lay waste to their whole grubby operation.\" This attack likely did not help dwarf/goblin relations.\nIn the RPG.\nThe Ironforge (Bronzebeard) dwarves in the Barrens and Mulgore have drawn the ire of the tauren, and centaur.\nThey knew the work at &lt;a href=\"Bael%20Modan\"&gt;Bael Modan&lt;/a&gt; (and other locations) would be noisy and disruptive to local inhabitants, but believed their search was of far greater importance than the comfort of the locals. It turned out that the digging up of Titan ruins appalls the tauren, an act they see as desecration of holy ground. According to &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, the dwarves and gnomes suffer constant attacks from the Horde, especially nearby tauren from Mulgore. The tauren attempt to destroy Ironforge dwarf dig sites at every opportunity, hassling dwarven archaeologists any way they can and stopping just short of open warfare. The dwarves felt they had to drive a band of tauren out of the area who were proving to be such a nuisance. The centaur have also made forays against Bael Modan, but were repelled decisively each time. They believed these attacks to be from various rogue organizations.\nThe Ironforge dwarves do not trust the Horde, as they've fought the orcs almost as long as the humans have. They accept the current truce, but chafe at the notion that they must stay away from the borders of Durotar. The titans left clues all over Kalimdor, and the Ironforge dwarves do not want border disputes to get in the way of their research. Some of the more adventurous dwarves refuse to abide by Jaina Proudmoore's command to stay away from Durotar, and explore the orcish homeland's outer regions anyways. They frequently have skirmishes with the jungle trolls who inhabit Durotar's borderlands.\nLands of Mystery.\n\"Lands of Mystery\" had initially described a more peaceful relationship. However \"Cataclysm\" paints a far different picture and makes no mention of any of the below.\nWhile under constant threat of outsiders encroaching upon their ancestral lands, by both centaur and goblin, the tauren see little difference in the case of dwarves, despite a difference in motives. The tauren do not realize that the dwarves are searching for relics of their heritage, and not quick cash like the goblins. If they did they would likely allow the the dwarves to work in peace, and perhaps even with their blessing. The tauren respect the worship of of ancestors, and they would likely find the dwarves purpose similar enough to tolerate the digging, provided the dwarves also showed the proper respect for the land. Even though tauren and dwarves do not share good relations, they were eager to share knowledge of runes and titan myths.\nAfter Brann Bronzebeard visited the dwarves of the &lt;a href=\"Bael%27dun%20Digsite\"&gt;Bael'dun Digsite&lt;/a&gt; he knew he needed to act before his friends were put in greater danger. While he visited Thunder Bluff he suggested to &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; that he send a group of his own people to work with the dwarves in exchange for making sure that the land was properly cared for. Cairne agreed to bring up his offer to his council of elders for discussion. Apparently it worked, as Baine Bloodhoof asked a group of young tauren to act as emissaries to the dwarven excavation of Bael\u2019dun to convince the dwarves to cease their careless digging. Given enough effort, the tauren apparently convinced the dwarves to allow a shaman to oversee their site to make sure that the land is properly cared for during the excavation, and that the dwarves return to the land as much as they take."}

When freak natural disasters rocked &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; just prior to the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, dwarven lands were not spared from calamity. A series of quakes tore through areas surrounding &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;, reducing settlements to rubble and taking the lives of many innocent &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt;. The quakes roused numerous &lt;a href=\"troggs\"&gt;troggs&lt;/a&gt; from their subterranean dwellings and drove the bestial creatures toward the dwarven settlement of &lt;a href=\"Anvilmar\"&gt;Anvilmar&lt;/a&gt; in Coldridge Valley. The sudden influx of troggs also caused the savage &lt;a href=\"Frostmane%20tribe\"&gt;Frostmane trolls&lt;/a&gt; to abandon their usual holdings on &lt;a href=\"Shimmer%20Ridge\"&gt;Shimmer Ridge&lt;/a&gt; and encroach upon dwarf-occupied areas. Threatened on two fronts, Dun Morogh's mountaineers are spread thin. Without additional assistance, the prized lands of Dun Morogh might soon fall to the dwarves' barbarous foes.\n&lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s in Anvilmar are recruited by the mountaineers to fend off the trogg invasion. The dwarven mountaineers were trained to protect themselves from odd wolf attacks but not from an invasion of troggs. Many dwarves in the battle zone were injured and exhausted, and the adventurers were sent with first aid kits to help them. After that, they are sent inside Anvilmar, which was put on lockdown due not only to the trogg invasion, but also the earthquakes causing destruction. There they help &lt;a href=\"Jona%20Ironstock\"&gt;Jona Ironstock&lt;/a&gt; resupplying the settlement with food and beer (no one can expect the dwarves to work without their ale, and &lt;a href=\"Grundel%20Harkin\"&gt;Grundel Harkin&lt;/a&gt; with his &lt;a href=\"archaeology\"&gt;archaeology&lt;/a&gt; quest, by recovering dwarven artifacts exposed by the quakes.\nAfterwards, the adventurers are sent to &lt;a href=\"Grelin%20Whitebeard\"&gt;Grelin Whitebeard&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Whitebeard%27s%20Encampment\"&gt;camp&lt;/a&gt;, to deal with the fleeing Frostmane trolls. After spying on the troll encampments, the dwarves find out the Cataclysm tore open a portal to the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Plane\"&gt;Elemental Plane&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"fire%20elemental\"&gt;fire elemental&lt;/a&gt; was terrorizing the trolls and causing them to flee their caves. The adventurers are sent to end the fire elemental before he caused the trolls to occupy the whole valley and expel the dwarves from their homes.\nFinally, the adventurers are sent by Grelin to deliver a report of the elemental's presence to Ironforge. However, once they reach &lt;a href=\"Coldridge%20Pass\"&gt;Coldridge Pass&lt;/a&gt;, an aftershock causes the tunnel to collapse, preventing them to cross to &lt;a href=\"Kharanos\"&gt;Kharanos&lt;/a&gt;. With the help of the &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Hands%20Springsprocket\"&gt;Hands Springsprocket&lt;/a&gt;, they send a distress signal to the &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan%20Airmen\"&gt;Gnomeregan Airmen&lt;/a&gt; who quickly come to their aid. After collecting supplies for the journey from Anvilmar, they travel to Kharanos on &lt;a href=\"Milo%20Geartwinge\"&gt;Milo Geartwinge&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Milo%27s%20Gyro\"&gt;gyrocopter&lt;/a&gt;. Apparently, the Coldridge folk were ill-informed of the events going on outside of the valley, and Milo informs them that the rest of Dun Morogh was in distress as well. From the Frostmane trolls invasion, to rumors of &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;Dark Irons&lt;/a&gt; in the east, and the political upheaval with King &lt;a href=\"Magni\"&gt;Magni&lt;/a&gt; turned into a diamond, the dwarves at Kharanos had their hands full, and needed help too."}
