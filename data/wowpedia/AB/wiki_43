On &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, they were known for their strict military discipline and skills in mining and blacksmithing. One of the first orcish clans to be taught the ways of &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; magic, the Blackrocks were the strongest faction within the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt; during the course of the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;s, and the Horde's first two &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt;s \u2014 &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; and his deposer &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 were both Blackrocks.\nFollowing the Horde's defeat, parts of the Blackrock clan were placed in &lt;a href=\"internment%20camp\"&gt;internment camp&lt;/a&gt;s and later joined &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;'s Horde once freed, whilst the remaining free Blackrocks joined forces with Blackhand's sons, &lt;a href=\"Dal%27rend%20Blackhand\"&gt;Rend&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Maim%20Blackhand\"&gt;Maim&lt;/a&gt;, in what would become known as the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Horde\"&gt;Dark Horde&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, a faction of the clan in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; attempted to revive their old &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;-worshipping traditions but were thwarted by the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; and, later, the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. The Blackrocks of the Dark Horde initially did not join &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;new Horde&lt;/a&gt;, instead choosing to pursue their own, darker path under Rend's leadership, but many of them were later granted amnesty by the then-Warchief &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; and recruited into his ranks.\nA few years after the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eitrigg\"&gt;Eitrigg&lt;/a&gt; took the leadership of the clan and represents it among the other clans in the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nRoughly 800 years before the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, the orcs began to migrate out of &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Gorgrond&lt;/a&gt;, but many orcs chose to remain in the region and gradually formed several distinct clans. The Blackrock clan lorded over much of Gorgrond and remained in their ancestral caves to study the earth around them. A great &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Foundry\"&gt;foundry&lt;/a&gt; served as the ancestral home of the clan, wherein master smiths smelted and worked the impossibly hard &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Ore\"&gt;blackrock ore&lt;/a&gt; that is the clan's namesake.\nRise of the Horde.\nIn the years preceding the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, the Blackrocks were led by a powerful warrior named &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt;, who commanded enormous respect from orcs around the world. Like the &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20clan\"&gt;Warsongs&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt;, the Blackrocks had long clashed with local &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt; populations. By the time of 11 years before the First War, the orcs had crushed their brutish enemies and driven most of them from Gorgrond.\nYears later, the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Orcish Horde&lt;/a&gt; made war upon the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;. Disagreements over battle tactics between rival chieftains often led to infighting, and the orcs had little success with attacking large draenei settlements. The demon lord &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; was displeased by this and ordered his servant, the &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;, to find a true leader \u2014 a &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 to lead the Horde. Chieftain Blackhand was the only orc Gul'dan knew of who possessed the strength and confidence to exert control over the Horde. Of all the clans, his Blackrocks had been the most successful against the draenei, and if they led the Horde, they could impose their strict military discipline on the other orcs and use their elemental forges to create armaments and massive war machines to destroy the draenei's defenses. Gul'dan met with Blackhand and promised that if he took up the mantle of &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt;, his &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; would wield power again, his soldiers would become mightier than the other clans and he himself would be remembered as the greatest orc leader to ever live. To win Blackhand's support, Gul'dan trained some of the Blackrock shaman in the ways of &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; magic and taught them how to rapidly grow adolescent orcs to adulthood by imbuing them with fel power. Blackhand was impressed with the results and ordered that his young sons, &lt;a href=\"Dal%27rend%20Blackhand\"&gt;Dal'rend&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Maim%20Blackhand\"&gt;Maim&lt;/a&gt;, be granted the same treatment. Blackhand agreed to lead the Horde, and Gul'dan promised to include the Blackrock chieftain as a member of the newly-formed &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt;, though in truth this was merely a tactic to make the Warchief believe he would hold authority over all aspects of the Horde. The warlock and the Warchief distrusted each other; Gul'dan intended to use Blackhand as a puppet ruler, while Blackhand intended to use Gul'dan to secure his place in orcish history.\nShortly thereafter, Gul'dan dispatched agents of the Shadow Council to spread word of Blackhand's deeds and the powerful new force discovered by the Blackrock shaman. Many orcs grew intrigued and looked upon Blackhand with awe. The next year, Gul'dan called for a gathering of the chieftains and their shaman at &lt;a href=\"Oshu%27gun\"&gt;Oshu'gun&lt;/a&gt;. Gul'dan told the gathered shaman that the &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elements&lt;/a&gt; had abandoned them, but that &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;benevolent beings&lt;/a&gt; had taught the Blackrocks how to wield a glorious new power known as fel magic. The Blackrock warlocks demonstrated their strength by siphoning the life from draenei captives and burning them from the inside out, and powerless shaman from all clans pleaded with the Blackrocks to teach them their fel secrets. The Blackrocks and their chieftain were seen as masters of fel magic and were treated with immense reverence. Gul'dan addressed the gathered orcs once more and convinced them that they needed a single military leader and that Blackhand, who had led his clan to victory after victory against the draenei, was best suited for the role. In the end, the clans unanimously voted for Blackhand as their Warchief.\nBlackhand ordered his Blackrock masons to begin construction of a capital, known as the &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Citadel\"&gt;Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, in western &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Tanaan Jungle&lt;/a&gt;. While the masons worked, the Warchief assigned specific roles to the various clans and also created a new clan, known as the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Tooth%20Grin%20clan\"&gt;Black Tooth Grin&lt;/a&gt;, which consisted of soldiers handpicked by the Warchief himself and would serve as the scouting arm of the Blackrock clan. The Blackrocks themselves were among the clans that would make up the Horde's main fighting force, leading direct assaults on draenei settlements and forming the backbone of the orcish army. To maintain order and discipline in his armies, Blackhand named &lt;a href=\"Eitrigg\"&gt;Eitrigg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; as his lieutenants. The three of them oversaw the Blackrock war machine as smiths slaved away at their forges in Gorgrond day and night, crafting thousands of new weapons, armor and siege engines for the clans. Meanwhile, the most powerful Blackrock warlocks were sent to the other clans to artificially age adolescent orcs much as they had done with their own clan's youths.\nThe First War.\nA few years after &lt;a href=\"genocide%20of%20the%20draenei\"&gt;genocide of the draenei&lt;/a&gt; concluded, the Blackrocks accompanied the Horde through the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;. The Blackrocks rose quickly in power and were responsible for numberless victories against the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s throughout the war. Orgrim Doomhammer had long sought to erase the corruption that had damned his people, and when Gul'dan fell into a coma he challenged Warchief Blackhand to a &lt;a href=\"mak%27gora\"&gt;mak'gora&lt;/a&gt; duel. Orgrim ended the contest when he crushed Blackhand's skull with the &lt;a href=\"Doomhammer\"&gt;Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt;, after which he was declared the new Warchief of the Horde and chieftain of the Blackrock clan.\nThe Second War.\nAlthough years of war had reduced their numbers, the Blackrock clan remained the strongest within the Horde, and they continued to dictate the course of the war, intimidating the lesser clans within the Horde into following Orgrim's lead. The forces of the Blackrock clan were fanatically loyal to Doomhammer and would serve him with their lives. As the dust of the First War settled, Orgrim's followers scrambled to find new weapons. Blackrock orcs commandeered the forges of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;, but many of them were in ruins due to the fire that had raged through the city. After Gul'dan created the necromantic horrors known as the &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s, Orgrim ordered members of the Blackrock clan to keep a close watch on the undead beings; the Warchief secretly planned to destroy Gul'dan and his new soldiers after the Horde had secured victory.\nAfter the Horde swept through the lands of &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Bleeding%20Hollow%20clan\"&gt;Bleeding Hollow clan&lt;/a&gt; were stationed outside the cities of &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt; to keep their inhabitants contained, Orgrim ordered his Blackrock orcs to mine the surrounding mountains and commandeer the dwarves' forges. Before long, thick smoke blanketed the region, and blacksmiths distributed newly wrought armaments and siege weapons throughout the Horde in preparation for an assault on &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; to the north.\nWhen the Horde began moving from the &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, Varok Saurfang commanded a rearguard of Blackrock orcs to waylay the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, giving the rest of the Horde precious time to cross Hillsbrad and funnel through a narrow mountain pass into the &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the Horde's final defeat at &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, the forces of the Black Tooth Grin clan under the leadership of Dal'rend and Maim Blackhand gathered with other Horde survivors, mainly from the Blackrock clan, and waited until the Alliance had pulled its forces out of the region. When the way was clear, the orcs snuck back into &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt; and took control of the stronghold, when a bargain was struck between the Dark Irons and the Blackrocks; the dwarves descended even deeper into the mountain, while the orcs occupied the higher levels. Like many bargains, it was never intended to be kept. It was there that Rend declared himself Warchief and chieftain of the weakened Blackrock clan. Dal'rend and Maim despised Orgrim for having killed their father, Blackhand, and blamed him for the Horde's defeat. The brothers now planned to reforge the Horde as they saw fit and gradually reached out to other large groups of survivors. &lt;a href=\"Kilrogg%20Deadeye\"&gt;Kilrogg Deadeye&lt;/a&gt; and the Bleeding Hollow ignored them, but the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt; pledged their support and offered to give some of their enslaved &lt;a href=\"red%20dragonflight\"&gt;dragons&lt;/a&gt; to the forces at Blackrock if they were ever needed. In the aftermath of the Second War, many members of the Blackrock clan were also captured by the Alliance and placed in &lt;a href=\"internment%20camps\"&gt;internment camps&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe imprisoned Blackrock orcs in the internment camps were later freed by &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, Orgrim Doomhammer's successor, and joined the modern Horde.\nThe Third War.\nShortly prior to the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the Blackrock forces in southern Lordaeron re-embraced their demon-worshipping heritage and became a major problem for the Alliance. The clan's warlocks predicted that demons would soon rain from the sky and that the world would burn, referring to the upcoming invasion by the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. The orcs' uprisings forced the Alliance to take decisive measures, and &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;King Terenas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; sent his son, &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Prince Arthas&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther the Lightbringer&lt;/a&gt; to contain the threat. Arthas helped repel a Blackrock attack on the defenseless village of &lt;a href=\"Strahnbrad\"&gt;Strahnbrad&lt;/a&gt;, slaying the Blackrock &lt;a href=\"Slave%20Master\"&gt;Slave Master&lt;/a&gt;, but not before the orcs managed to haul off several villagers to their nearby &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Camp\"&gt;encampment&lt;/a&gt;. Uther's attempts at parleying with the &lt;a href=\"Blademaster%20of%20the%20Blackrock%20Clan\"&gt;Blackrock blademaster&lt;/a&gt; failed, and shortly afterward the blademaster sacrificed several human captives in the name of the Legion. Arthas led an attack on the blademaster's lair and succeeded in slaying him, but told Uther that he suspected the orcs had been attempting to summon demons with their sacrifices. However, the Lightbringer reassured the prince that the orcs were simply trying to hold on to dying traditions and that their demons had been defeated a long time ago.\nMonths later, as the Legion-controlled &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; ravaged Lordaeron, an encampment of Blackrock orcs led by &lt;a href=\"Jubei%27Thos\"&gt;Jubei'Thos&lt;/a&gt; and various &lt;a href=\"blademaster\"&gt;blademaster&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"far%20seer\"&gt;far seer&lt;/a&gt;s maintained a functional &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Gate\"&gt;Demon Gate&lt;/a&gt; near the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; and Arthas (who was now a Scourge &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;) sought to claim the gate by destroying the Blackrock base so that Kel'Thuzad could commune with the demon lord &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt;. Upon encountering the undead, the Blackrocks proclaimed that the Legion had sent the dead to test them. The orcs considered themselves the true servants of the Legion and believed that the mindless undead were weak and impure. Kel'Thuzad replied that the orcs had failed their task and that they, too, had to be scourged from the world. When Arthas asked how the demon-worshipping orcs fit into the relationship between the Burning Legion and the Scourge, Kel'Thuzad explained that it was a very complicated matter, but that, simply put, the orcs no longer held any favor with the Legion. Ultimately, the Blackrocks and their heroes were slaughtered, and Kel'Thuzad succeeded in contacting Archimonde.\nElsewhere the Blackrock clan members of the New Horde helped set up Orgrimmar in &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; as evidenced by the Blackrock banner visible in the city's entrance when &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt; visited the capital.\nThe Dark Horde.\nIn Blackrock Spire, Warchief Dal'rend had found a new home for his people. Rend and Maim ruled the Spire, in constant conflict with the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;Dark Iron&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; over control of the stronghold. The black dragon &lt;a href=\"Nefarian\"&gt;Nefarian&lt;/a&gt;, son of &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, gained the servitude of the Blackrock orcs and asserted dominion over the Spire, with Dal'rend under his command. The orcs were used primarily as beasts of burden and cannon fodder for the black dragonflight, being known together with their allies as the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Horde\"&gt;Dark Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nA force of Blackrock orcs under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Gath%27Ilzogg\"&gt;Gath'Ilzogg&lt;/a&gt; traveled from the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Steppes\"&gt;Burning Steppes&lt;/a&gt; and claimed &lt;a href=\"Stonewatch%20Keep\"&gt;Stonewatch Keep&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt; with the aid of the human warlock &lt;a href=\"Morganth\"&gt;Morganth&lt;/a&gt;. The orcs fought with horrific savagery, presumably fueled by Morganth's evil magic. Many human soldiers perished trying to defend the keep, but ultimately nothing could be done. Oddly enough, Morganth turned on his Blackrock cohorts shortly after the victory at Stonewatch, constructing the &lt;a href=\"Tower%20of%20Ilgalar\"&gt;Tower of Ilgalar&lt;/a&gt; and building a small army of &lt;a href=\"Shadowhide%20Gnoll%20Clan\"&gt;Shadowhide&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt;s who began attacking humans and orcs alike. Whatever betrayal took place between Morganth and the Blackrock warlord &lt;a href=\"Gath%27Ilzogg\"&gt;Gath'Ilzogg&lt;/a&gt; remained a mystery, though it was later discovered that Morganth had been searching for the &lt;a href=\"%3AScythe%20of%20Elune\"&gt;:Scythe of Elune&lt;/a&gt;.\nFrom Stonewatch, the Blackrock clan marauded the areas north of &lt;a href=\"Lakeshire\"&gt;Lakeshire&lt;/a&gt;, keeping its citizens penned in the town like cattle. Once, the clan staged a ruthless offensive on Lakeshire itself, killing many humans and destroying the bridge spanning &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Everstill\"&gt;Lake Everstill&lt;/a&gt;. The Blackrocks enlisted &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Shadowcaster\"&gt;shadowcasters&lt;/a&gt;, equipped with &lt;a href=\"Midnight%20Orb\"&gt;midnight orbs&lt;/a&gt;, to aid their attacks in Redridge, while &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Outrunner\"&gt;outrunners&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Renegade\"&gt;renegades&lt;/a&gt; ran ambushes between Lakeshire and Stonewatch. The outrunners were led by a vicious, crafty orc named &lt;a href=\"Tharil%27zun\"&gt;Tharil'zun&lt;/a&gt;. Gath'Ilzogg holed himself up in Stonewatch Keep, plotting the Blackrocks' further \"crimes against humanity\". Lakeshire's magistrate, &lt;a href=\"Magistrate%20Solomon\"&gt;Solomon&lt;/a&gt;, sent envoys north to &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; to request &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;King Magni&lt;/a&gt;'s aid against the Blackrock incursions. &lt;a href=\"Moira%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Princess Moira&lt;/a&gt; volunteered to help, but while traveling through the Burning Steppes she and her guardsmen were ambushed and captured by Dark Irons. King Magni was not personally concerned by the Blackrocks. According to him, the orcs were fighting a losing war and would eventually die off.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Searing%20Gorge\"&gt;Searing Gorge&lt;/a&gt;, the dwarf &lt;a href=\"Lathoric%20the%20Black\"&gt;Lathoric the Black&lt;/a&gt; created the golem &lt;a href=\"Obsidion\"&gt;Obsidion&lt;/a&gt; in the name of &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt;. Lathoric intended to use Obsidion to destroy the Blackrock orcs and unite the Dark Irons with their brethren in the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Depths\"&gt;Blackrock Depths&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Horde traitor &lt;a href=\"Grark%20Lorkrub\"&gt;Grark Lorkrub&lt;/a&gt; was found to be giving the Blackrock orcs vital information about the &lt;a href=\"Kargath%20Expeditionary%20Force\"&gt;Kargath Expeditionary Force&lt;/a&gt;'s day to day operations and began hiding amongst the Blackrock forces in the Burning Steppes. &lt;a href=\"Lexlort\"&gt;Lexlort&lt;/a&gt; ordered Horde adventurers to confront and capture him. The black drake &lt;a href=\"Velarok\"&gt;Velarok&lt;/a&gt; deceived adventurers into helping him and sabotaging the Dark Irons in the Searing Gorge, proclaiming that the \"legions of Blackrock\" would soon invade and lay waste to the gorge.\nAlliance forces in the Burning Steppes assumed that the Blackrocks were a product of their savage upbringing. However, when they discovered that the black dragonflight were the ones controlling the orcs and fueling them with rage and hostility, an adventurer was sent to warn Magistrate Solomon in Lakeshire. As Lakeshire could not possibly survive an attack from both the Blackrock orcs and the black dragonflight, the adventurer was sent on to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Highlord Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; to request aid. Since &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Lady Katrana Prestor&lt;/a&gt; refused to help, Bolvar instead empowered the adventurer as an acting deputy of Stormwind; if they managed to find proof of the black dragonflight's involvement with the Blackrock orcs, Bolvar would send military aid to Lakeshire. Solomon sent the adventurer back to the Burning Steppes, where they began investigating the disappearance of &lt;a href=\"Reginald%20Windsor\"&gt;Marshal Reginald Windsor&lt;/a&gt;, the commanding officer of an Alliance squad that had been gathering large amounts of intelligence about the Blackrocks. When Windsor was lost, so was all of the precious information. &lt;a href=\"Ragged%20John\"&gt;Ragged John&lt;/a&gt;, who was with Reginald when he went missing, related how the two of them were attacked by a Blackrock raiding party in the middle of Blackrock Mountain. Windsor fought the orcs off with the ancient dwarven hammer &lt;a href=\"%3AIronfoe\"&gt;:Ironfoe&lt;/a&gt;, but it soon became clear that John and Reginald had been caught up in a battle between the Blackrocks and the Dark Iron dwarves (the orcs had arrived early to set up traps and \"other diabolical things\"). When the Dark Iron army arrived, they recognized Ironfoe and chose to spare Reginald's life, imprisoning him in the Blackrock Depths rather than killing him on sight. Reginald was eventually freed and would go on to unmask Katrana Prestor as being the black dragon &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Onyxia&lt;/a&gt;, sister of Nefarian, though he paid for it with his life.\nSome time later, Horde adventurers in Blackrock Spire discovered Blackrock documents signed by Warchief Rend. This came as a shock, as it was previously thought within the Horde that Dal'rend had been slain decades earlier. The adventurer was sent to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; to learn what &lt;a href=\"Eitrigg\"&gt;Eitrigg&lt;/a&gt; knew about the Blackrocks before conferring with Warchief &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; to find out what he wished to do about this problem. Thrall proceeded to send adventurers to Blackrock Spire and ordered them to retrieve Rend's head in the name of the Horde.\nCataclysm.\nA force of Blackrock orcs under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Kurtok%20the%20Slayer\"&gt;Kurtok the Slayer&lt;/a&gt; managed to invade &lt;a href=\"Northshire%20Valley\"&gt;Northshire Valley&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; opened a break in the mountain between Northshire and the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Steppes\"&gt;Burning Steppes&lt;/a&gt; to the north. &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Worg%20%28Elwynn%20Forest%29\"&gt;Battle worgs&lt;/a&gt; were sent against the defenders of &lt;a href=\"Northshire%20Abbey\"&gt;Northshire Abbey&lt;/a&gt; while spies peered at the human forces from the valley's northwestern forests. &lt;a href=\"Goblin\"&gt;Goblin&lt;/a&gt; assassins were hired to kill the human soldiers and ambush a battalion stationed behind the abbey. Alliance adventurers were sent to kill the worgs, spies and assassins, as well as heal fallen human soldiers, but a large contingency of Blackrocks remained in the eastern valley and began burning down the forests. They took over and began burning down the &lt;a href=\"Northshire%20Vineyards\"&gt;Northshire Vineyards&lt;/a&gt;, planning their final assault against the human defenders. Adventurers were sent to kill the rampaging orcs and collect their weapons, as well as extinguish the fires raging across the vineyards, before being ordered to kill the invasion leader himself, Kurtok, who hid in a passage leading into the mountains in preparation for another assault. Once Kurtok was slain, &lt;a href=\"peasant\"&gt;peasant&lt;/a&gt;s were sent to the pass in an attempt to seal the passage so that no more orcs could come through.\nIn Redridge, Lakeshire once again came under threat from the Blackrock orcs, who joined forces with the &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20pack\"&gt;Redridge&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt;s to plan an attack on the humans. Several orcs were placed in the &lt;a href=\"Rethban%20Caverns\"&gt;Rethban Caverns&lt;/a&gt; under the direct command of the gnoll leader, &lt;a href=\"Yowler\"&gt;Yowler&lt;/a&gt;. The orcs also gave &lt;a href=\"Ardo%20Dirtpaw\"&gt;Ardo Dirtpaw&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href=\"Ettin%20Control%20Orb\"&gt;magical orb&lt;/a&gt; which allowed him to control the local &lt;a href=\"ettin\"&gt;ettin&lt;/a&gt;s. The &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Invasion%20Plans\"&gt;Blackrock invasion plans&lt;/a&gt; carried by Yowler revealed a massive buildup of orcish and gnoll forces in eastern Redridge and that the Blackrock general Gath'Ilzogg was planning to march his armies across Lakeshire to attack &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; directly. In order to prevent the impending orc assault, &lt;a href=\"Magistrate%20Solomon\"&gt;Magistrate Solomon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Colonel%20Troteman\"&gt;Colonel Troteman&lt;/a&gt; turned to the renowned war veteran &lt;a href=\"John%20J.%20Keeshan\"&gt;John J. Keeshan&lt;/a&gt;. However, as Keeshan refused to help, Alliance adventurers were tasked with rousing him from his stupor by retrieving Keeshan's armor and personal possessions from &lt;a href=\"Alther%27s%20Mill\"&gt;Alther's Mill&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Render%27s%20Camp\"&gt;Render's Camp&lt;/a&gt; as well as rescue the various members of Keeshan's battalion, the &lt;a href=\"Bravo%20Company\"&gt;Bravo Company&lt;/a&gt;, from orcish captivity in several locations around Redridge. The adventurer, Keeshan and the reunited Bravo Company proceeded to head to &lt;a href=\"Camp%20Everstill\"&gt;Camp Everstill&lt;/a&gt; on the far side of Lake Everstill. Since the orcs had destroyed the bridge leading to Stonewatch Keep, the humans had to either head north through &lt;a href=\"Alther%27s%20Mill\"&gt;Alther's Mill&lt;/a&gt;, cutting their way through an army of worgs, or south through &lt;a href=\"Render%27s%20Valley\"&gt;Render's Valley&lt;/a&gt;, which was described by &lt;a href=\"Jorgensen\"&gt;Jorgensen&lt;/a&gt; as a death trap. Keeshan told &lt;a href=\"Messner\"&gt;Messner&lt;/a&gt; to find some &lt;a href=\"seaforium\"&gt;seaforium&lt;/a&gt; while the adventurer was sent to both gather material for camouflage and find the scout &lt;a href=\"Brubaker\"&gt;Brubaker&lt;/a&gt;. When the adventurer found Brubaker, he had been killed by orcs and gruesomely strung up, but a note in his pouch revealed that the orcs had cages full of prisoners of war, which would have to be freed before the valley could be blown up, and that the orcs were being backed by black dragons. After constructing the camouflage and killing several &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Hunter\"&gt;Blackrock scouts&lt;/a&gt;, the adventurer accompanied Jorgensen to free the prisoners in Render's Valley before planting the seaforium charges and finally blowing all of Render's Valley up, turning it into &lt;a href=\"Render%27s%20Valley\"&gt;Render's Crater&lt;/a&gt; and killing many orcs.\nThe Bravo Company began closing in on the Blackrock &lt;a href=\"High%20Command%23Blackrock%20high%20command\"&gt;high command&lt;/a&gt; in Stonewatch, but first turned their attention to the nearby army of Shadowhide gnolls and their master, &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magus%20Doane\"&gt;Grand Magus Doane&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 a human traitor working for the Blackrock orcs. After retrieving the key to Doane's tower, the &lt;a href=\"Tower%20of%20Ilgalar\"&gt;Tower of Ilgalar&lt;/a&gt;, from &lt;a href=\"General%20Fangore\"&gt;General Fangore&lt;/a&gt; and slaughtering the gnolls, the adventurer confronted the magus inside the tower, but Doane managed to teleport away before the hero could finish him off, mentioning \"&lt;a href=\"Darkblaze\"&gt;Darkblaze&lt;/a&gt;\" in the process. Shortly afterward, Colonel Troteman arrived with a large &lt;a href=\"Bravo%20Company%20Siege%20Tank\"&gt;siege tank&lt;/a&gt; to help the Bravo Company \"end this mess\". The Blackrocks had become aware of the adventurer's location and sent a large force to meet them head on, and the hero was tasked with piloting the siege tank to clear a path to &lt;a href=\"Keeshan%27s%20Post\"&gt;Keeshan's Post&lt;/a&gt; in the north, killing hundreds of orc soldiers in the process and finally only leaving the Blackrocks holding out at Stonewatch Keep. The Bravo Company proceeded to head to Stonewatch to put an end to the Blackrock high command and the orc invasion, confronting and killing both Tharil'zun and Gath'Ilzogg (who had now somehow become &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s). However, Troteman warned that the Company had walked into a trap, and suddenly the black dragon Darkblaze, the true form of Grand Magus Doane, appeared in the distance. Darkblaze asked the Bravo Company if they had truly believed that the orcs had the presence of mind to plan such a large-scale invasion, before declaring that they would die as an offering to &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; as the march upon Stormwind began. After a fiercesome struggle, Darkblaze incinerated most of the Bravo Company, killing them instantly. However, Keeshan managed to leap into the dragon's mouth as the heavily wounded Darkblaze began flying out across Lake Everstill. Before long, the dragon succumbed to his wounds and fell into the lake, taking Keeshan with him. The adventurer, now the last surviving member of Bravo Company, headed back to Lakeshire to tell Magistrate Solomon that the orc invasion had been stopped, but at great cost. However, Keeshan's body was never found.\nSome time later, in the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Steppes\"&gt;Burning Steppes&lt;/a&gt;, the Blackrocks began gathering their forces and preparing for yet another invasion of Redridge. These plans were described by the Horde as an act of \"blind aggression\" and by &lt;a href=\"Ariok\"&gt;Ariok&lt;/a&gt; as being for no reason other than blind territorialism. To prevent this from coming to fruition, Alliance and Horde adventurers were sent to the steppes to assist either Colonel Troteman and John J. Keeshan \u2014 who had survived his confrontation with Darkblaze \u2014 or the Blackrock veteran &lt;a href=\"Eitrigg\"&gt;Eitrigg&lt;/a&gt; and his son, Ariok.\nAt the &lt;a href=\"Whelping%20Downs\"&gt;Whelping Downs&lt;/a&gt;, the orcs chained &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20whelp\"&gt;baby dragons&lt;/a&gt; of various &lt;a href=\"dragonflight\"&gt;flights&lt;/a&gt; to the ground, preparing them for the twisted experiments of their dark master, Nefarian. In the northwest, &lt;a href=\"Ner%27gosh%20the%20Shadow\"&gt;Ner'gosh the Shadow&lt;/a&gt; and several &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Warlock\"&gt;warlocks&lt;/a&gt; kicked the &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; warlock &lt;a href=\"Gorzeeki%20Wildeyes\"&gt;Gorzeeki Wildeyes&lt;/a&gt; out of his home at the &lt;a href=\"Altar%20of%20Storms%20%28Burning%20Steppes%29\"&gt;Altar of Storms&lt;/a&gt; to claim it for themselves. After heroes dealt with the whelpers, rescued the dragon whelps, gathered several supplies from the surrounding areas and obtained several reagents from Gorzeeki, they journeyed with Keeshan and Ariok to &lt;a href=\"Chiselgrip\"&gt;Chiselgrip&lt;/a&gt; to rendezvous with Troteman and Eitrigg and seek the aid of the &lt;a href=\"Thorium%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Thorium Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; (killing a number of Blackrock forces in the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Tooth%20Hovel\"&gt;Black Tooth Hovel&lt;/a&gt; along the way). With the help of the tailor &lt;a href=\"Thelaron%20Direneedle\"&gt;Thelaron Direneedle&lt;/a&gt;, the adventurer constructed a disguise and infiltrated the ranks of the Blackrock clan, polishing boots for &lt;a href=\"Quartermaster%20Kaoshin\"&gt;Quartermaster Kaoshin&lt;/a&gt; while also taking the opportunity to assassinate three prominent Blackrock allies with a &lt;a href=\"scorpid\"&gt;scorpid&lt;/a&gt; barb. Kaoshin proceeded to send the adventurer to call in the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20War%20Kodo\"&gt;war kodos&lt;/a&gt; from the grazing lands to the south, as &lt;a href=\"General%20Thorg%27izog\"&gt;General Thorg'izog&lt;/a&gt; said that the Blackrocks would be moving into Redridge soon. After doing as they were told, the adventurer kept the &lt;a href=\"Horn%20of%20the%20Callers\"&gt;kodo-calling horn&lt;/a&gt; and took it back to Chiselgrip. Troteman and Eitrigg expressed concern over Kaoshin's words, as they had not known the attack on Redridge would occur so soon.\nNext, the adventurer was sent to the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Stronghold\"&gt;Blackrock Stronghold&lt;/a&gt; and General Thorg'izog, the first of the \"Big Three\" running the Blackrock ground forces in the steppes. After the hero proved their worth by defeating &lt;a href=\"Magma%20Lord%20Kolob\"&gt;Magma Lord Kolob&lt;/a&gt;, Thorg'izog tasked them with cudgeling the troops outside the stronghold as a way to keep them focused and obedient. Troteman and Eitrigg asked the adventurer to also kill several of Thorg'izog's &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Sergeant\"&gt;mounted sergeants&lt;/a&gt; in the process by cudgeling them repeatedly. The adventurer returned to Chiselgrip before accompanying Keeshan and Troteman to &lt;a href=\"Morgan%27s%20Vigil\"&gt;Morgan's Vigil&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 vacated as most of its inhabitants had moved into Blackrock Mountain to fight their own battle against the Blackrocks \u2014 or Ariok and Eitrigg to &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Crest\"&gt;Flame Crest&lt;/a&gt;. After gathering some more supplies, the adventurer accompanied Keeshan or Ariok to investigate the Blackrock army around the nearby &lt;a href=\"Dreadmaul%20Rock\"&gt;Dreadmaul Rock&lt;/a&gt;, as well as kill several champions sent by the orcs and their black dragon allies to stand guard at rally points as a vanguard. Additionally, the adventurer delivered the dragon whelps rescued from the Whelping Downs to the &lt;a href=\"red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Acridostrasz\"&gt;Acridostrasz&lt;/a&gt;. Acride agreed to uphold his end of the bargain in the coming battle against the orcs; while the red flight had no particular love for Redridge, they shared the grudge against the Blackrock clan.\nFinally, the hero donned their Blackrock disguise once more to deliver three special packages to the Big Three: General Thorg'izog, &lt;a href=\"Dragon-Lord%20Neeralak\"&gt;Dragon-Lord Neeralak&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"High%20Warlock%20Xi%27lun\"&gt;High Warlock Xi'lun&lt;/a&gt;. Thorg'izog, who had relocated to the &lt;a href=\"Firegut%20Furnace\"&gt;Firegut Furnace&lt;/a&gt;, received a package of &lt;a href=\"Worg%20Cutlet\"&gt;worg meat&lt;/a&gt; marinated in \"&lt;a href=\"Fel%20Slider%20Cider\"&gt;fel slider cider&lt;/a&gt;\" from the Altar of Storms, which he proceeded to distribute among the ogres. The second package contained several sleeping &lt;a href=\"flamekin\"&gt;flamekin&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 a brand of fire demon which, to the untrained eye, would look identical to warlock &lt;a href=\"imp\"&gt;imp&lt;/a&gt;s \u2014 and was delivered to the &lt;a href=\"Skull%20Warren\"&gt;Skull Warren&lt;/a&gt;, a cave where the warlocks of the Blackrock clan often practiced their magic. As High Warlock Xi'lun was busy elsewhere, the cave was instead held by Dragon-Lord Neeralak, whose expertise was in dragons, not &lt;a href=\"necromancy\"&gt;necromancy&lt;/a&gt;. The disguised adventurer managed to convince Neeralak that the sleeping flamekin were imps. Finally, High Warlock Xi'lun, located in a cave atop Dreadmaul Rock, was expecting a delivery of a magical Orb of Domination from Ner'gosh the Shadow, which he would be able to use in a powerful summoning ritual. Instead, the adventurer delivered him a completely powerless &lt;a href=\"Clear%20Glass%20Orb\"&gt;glass orb&lt;/a&gt;. Xi'lun hesitantly accepted that the orb was the one he had been waiting for and dismissed his doubts as being \"his nerves talking\".\nOnce all three packages had been delivered, the battle was ready to start. During a war conference atop Dreadmaul Rock, Thorg'izog revealed that he was feeling ill due to \"something he ate\", and he couldn't promote any of his sergeants since they had all been killed in various freak accidents. Neeralak said that the \"imps\" he had received had woken up and started shooting fireballs at everyone in the Skull Warren, and that dozens of his dragons had been killed when two enemies swept through the front lines. Xi'lun considered them both to be failures and instead began his summoning ritual, saying that the Blackrocks wouldn't need foot soldiers nor dragons if they had a &lt;a href=\"annihilan\"&gt;pit lord&lt;/a&gt; on their side. The warlock successfully summoned the pit lord &lt;a href=\"Hellmondath\"&gt;Hellmondath&lt;/a&gt;, but when he tried and failed to use his orb to take control of the demon, the creature instead began rampaging through the Blackrock army. Thorg'izog ordered a retreat to the dragons, but Neeralak said that he had never called any dragons. The adventurer proceeded to burn down large parts of the army from atop the back of a dragon cloaked in obsidian ash to make it appear as a member of the black dragonflight. The Big Three all survived the attack; Thorg'izog returned to the Firegut Furnace, Neeralak retreated to the cave on the mountain's peak and Xi'lun hid in the back of the Skull Warren with his fellow warlocks. The adventurer was sent to kill all three, finally putting a stop to the Blackrocks' invasion plans. While the Blackrock orcs still swarmed in Blackrock Spire, both Troteman and Eitrigg doubted that their plans would take them anywhere Redridge any time soon.\nAcride later made it into Blackrock Spire, disguised as a Blackrock orc, in order to halt Nefarian's efforts. To accomplish this, however, he first had to enlist adventurers to dispose of Nefarian's &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Horde\"&gt;Dark Horde&lt;/a&gt; underlings.\nMists of Pandaria.\nMany members of the Blackrock clan were later granted amnesty and joined the new Horde at the behest of Warchief &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;. His own bodyguard, &lt;a href=\"Malkorok\"&gt;Malkorok&lt;/a&gt;, was of Blackrock descent. He also became a leader of the &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron\"&gt;Kor'kron&lt;/a&gt; who began acting akin to a secret police, ensuring the loyalty of other Horde races (and, in some cases, orcs), while abducting, brutalizing, and in some cases even murdering those they deemed treasonous or troublesome.\nDragonflight.\nBy the time of the reawakening of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eitrigg\"&gt;Eitrigg&lt;/a&gt; had become the new chieftain of the Blackrock clan. He spoke, represented, and acted as their leader during Azeroth's first &lt;a href=\"Kosh%27harg\"&gt;Kosh'harg&lt;/a&gt; festival. There he was reunited with other members of his clan, including &lt;a href=\"High%20Warlord%20Cromush\"&gt;High Warlord Cromush&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thura\"&gt;Thura&lt;/a&gt;, and his son, &lt;a href=\"Ariok\"&gt;Ariok&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the leaders of the clans were gathered to recruit orcs into their clans, Eitrigg spoke of his clan's honor and role in the Horde. He highlighted the clan's importance on the idea of being a warrior and a blacksmith to prospective new clanmates. Upon the champion requesting to join the Blackrock, Eitrigg declared that they had honored him. He subsequently instructed them with hunting, tracking, and killing &lt;a href=\"Gor%27krosh\"&gt;Gor'krosh&lt;/a&gt;, the Long Knives, without their armor, in order to test their skills in battle. Following their success, Eitrigg accepted the &lt;a href=\"%22Long%20Knife%22\"&gt;\"Long Knife\"&lt;/a&gt; as a trophy on behalf of his clan.\nCulture.\nThe Blackrocks were known for their strict military discipline and extremely regimented society. On Draenor, the clan studied the earth around them, developing their knowledge of metallurgy and smithing. The first of the orc clans to master the secrets of the unique &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Ore\"&gt;blackrock ore&lt;/a&gt; scattered throughout Gorgrond, the Blackrocks were able to create astonishing tools and weapons. Blackrock blades were soon coveted for their reliability and durability, though they themselves preferred to wield blunt weaponry in battle to honor their ancestors. Heavy metal and wood hammers eventually came to be considered as their traditional weapons.\nThe Blackrock clan originally used the naturally occurring &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt;-fueled infernos of ancient Draenor to shape and harden their namesake ore. A &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; could use these bellows to channel the power of a fire spirit directly to a blast furnace, allowing the Blackrock to set up forges anywhere.\nBy the time immediately preceding the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt;, the Blackrocks boasted the largest, most organized, and best equipped orcish military in the world. The clan's shaman had perfected the art of using elemental fire to shape the blackrock ore, and the clan had the most advanced weapon foundries among all the orcs of Draenor. The Blackrocks worked their forges day and night, crafting enchanted weaponry and armor that were nearly indestructible.\nAfter the fall of the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; settlement of &lt;a href=\"Telmor\"&gt;Telmor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; offered the town to the &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20clan\"&gt;Frostwolves&lt;/a&gt;, but since &lt;a href=\"Durotan\"&gt;Durotan&lt;/a&gt; refused the Blackrocks instead took up residence in the city. Many of the orcs began using draenic clothes and robes as everyday clothing, melding the unique style into their own culture.\nMale orcs of the Blackrock clan never cut their hair until they came of age, at which point their head was shaved and their role in the clan's society was determined. Some particularly ornamented switchblades were likely used by prominent families for many generations of initiation.\nThe Blackrocks of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Horde\"&gt;Dark Horde&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt; were known to celebrate the &lt;a href=\"Midsummer%20Fire%20Festival\"&gt;Midsummer Fire Festival&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn Warcraft II.\nChieftain: \"&lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt;\"\nClan Colors: \"Red\"\nBackground: \"Although years of war have reduced their numbers, the Blackrock clan remains the strongest within the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Ruled for many years by &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; the Destroyer, the Blackrock clan rose quickly in power and was responsible for numberless victories against the &lt;a href=\"Human\"&gt;Human&lt;/a&gt;s in the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;. Orgrim Doomhammer - known also as the Backstabber - assassinated the ruthless, but careless Blackhand, and named himself clan chieftain and &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;War Chief&lt;/a&gt; of the Horde. The Blackrock clan continues to dictate the course of the war intimidating the lesser clans within the Horde into following Orgrim's lead. The forces of the Blackrock clan are fanatically loyal to the Doomhammer and will serve him with their lives.\"\nDomain: &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28continent%29\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;\nIn Warcraft III.\nThe Blackrock Clan was an &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; faction. Among their ranks it counted &lt;a href=\"Peon%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;peons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Grunt%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;grunts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Raider%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;raiders&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Headhunter%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;troll headhunters&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ogre%20Magi%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;ogre magi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Catapult%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;catapults&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Orc%20Warlock%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;warlocks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20Sapper%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;goblin sappers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20Zeppelin%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;goblin zeppelins&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;red dragons&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Slave%20Master\"&gt;slave master&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blademaster%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;blademasters&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Far%20Seer%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;far seers&lt;/a&gt;. They appeared as a hostile faction in &lt;a href=\"The%20Defense%20of%20Strahnbrad%20%28WC3%20Human%29\"&gt;The Defense of Strahnbrad&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20and%20Roll%20%28WC3%20Human%29\"&gt;Blackrock and Roll&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20%26amp%3B%20Roll%2C%20Too%21%20%28WC3%20Undead%29\"&gt;Blackrock &amp; Roll, Too!&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpeculation.\nSkin.\nIn ', the dark gray skin of Rend's Blackrock orcs is explained as being due to the years they spent dwelling deep inside Blackrock Mountain without seeing the light of day. However, ', the \"&lt;a href=\"Blackhand%20%28comic%29\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt;\" webcomic and in ' all depict the Blackrock orcs as having already had gray skin on Draenor, long before coming to dwell in Blackrock Mountain on Azeroth, implying that the origin of the skin color has been &lt;a href=\"retcon\"&gt;retcon&lt;/a&gt;ned. It can be speculated that the reason for the skin color being due to dwelling underground is still a valid explanation, but that it was a trait the Blackrocks always had due to dwelling in the caverns and mountains of Gorgrond rather than it being a trait they developed recently in Blackrock Mountain.\nThe skin color of modern-day Blackrock orcs is inconsistently depicted. &lt;a href=\"Eitrigg\"&gt;Eitrigg&lt;/a&gt; was never a member of the Dark Horde but still has gray skin, whereas &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; has green skin. A of a Blackrock orc in the Burning Steppes also depicts green skin rather than gray. &lt;a href=\"Dranosh%20Saurfang\"&gt;Dranosh Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; on the other hand, has brown skin.\nSeveral orcs in the new Horde, including &lt;a href=\"Mok\"&gt;Mok&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mokasa\"&gt;Mokasa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"General%20Krakork\"&gt;General Krakork&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Overlord%20Or%27barokh\"&gt;Overlord Or'barokh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Armorer%20Orkuruk\"&gt;Armorer Orkuruk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"General%20Ushet%20Wolfbarger\"&gt;General Ushet Wolfbarger&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Nassar\"&gt;Nassar&lt;/a&gt;, have the same skin color as Blackrock orcs, but it is not outright stated whether or not they are members of the clan."}
{"id": "386365", "revid": "3154973", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=386365", "title": "Blackrock clan (alternate universe)", "text": "The Blackrock clan is an &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"clan\"&gt;clan&lt;/a&gt; led by himself. The Blackrock are a disciplined, organized, and militaristic clan who boast expert &lt;a href=\"blacksmith\"&gt;smith&lt;/a&gt;s and metalworkers. Well armored, they utilize brute strength and weaponry to destroy their foes.\nHistory.\nFor years, the clan had many victories under the guidance of their . While many of them thought it was just luck, the reality was different. Their leader was a brilliant tactician who had always found the weak point of the enemy.\nAt that time, was haunted by the prophecy that said that the last of the &lt;a href=\"Doomhammer\"&gt;Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; line would use the weapon to doom his people, and brought the hammer back to the place where it was forged, hoping to avert the prophecy while keeping the weapon's power. However, the &lt;a href=\"furies\"&gt;furies&lt;/a&gt; saw the fear and pride that came over Orgrim and took the hammer away from him. No one else was allowed to claim it - those who did were burned to death.\nWithout the hammer in the hands of Orgrim, the clan lost to the ogres for the first time.\nSoon, the Blackrock clan was surrounded at the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Foundry\"&gt;Foundry&lt;/a&gt;. They were outnumbered, and even if they had attacked the ogres before dawn, while they were vulnerable, they would still not have been able to break the siege. The only choice was whether to starve to death within the foundry's walls or to die quickly in battle. As death seemed certain, Orgrim returned to the place where he left the Doomhammer, contemplating it. He recalled his pride, being ready to give his life for the clan on orders from his chief whether on the battlefield or in the lava lake to retrieve the legendary hammer. But the chieftain refused, it was he who would take the hammer. He ordered Orgrim to lead the assault before dawn. He said that the hammer was their last hope, and that the survival of the clan's leader did not matter. As he plunged his hand into the lava and tried to grab the hammer, the lava covered the body of the chief - but instead of burning him to death, the furies spoke to him, even though he was not a &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;. It said that though the chieftain was not worthy to carry the hammer, he was allowed to use it to forge new weapons for the clan.\nAmazement read in the eyes of Orgrim when the chieftain came back with the hammer. The furies had sent him the knowledge to use the legacy of the Doomhammer family to forge new weapons throughout the night. Then, in the morning, freshly armed orcs charged behind their leader at the ogre army. Victory was theirs. The chieftain then had to pass the hammer back to Orgrim, as it still belonged to him and told his second-in-command that the day the prophecy will be fulfilled is yet to come. Since then, the Blackrock leader took on the name of , as his hand was transformed by the lake that held the Doomhammer into one of flame and black stone.\nIron Horde.\nThe Blacrock clan was the first to join the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt;. After a &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;mysterious prophet&lt;/a&gt; gave detailed schematics, Blackhand marshaled the Blackrock clan to industrialize warfare on a colossal scale.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Assault%20on%20the%20Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Assault on the Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, the Blackrock clan tried to stop the invading forces. Their attempts failed, and the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Quarry\"&gt;Blackrock Quarry&lt;/a&gt; was flooded as a result. \nIn the end, the Blackrock orcs lost their &lt;a href=\"Blackhand%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;warlord&lt;/a&gt; during the siege of their Foundry.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt;'s defeat, it's presumed they joined the rest of Draenor in rebuilding.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nIn time, the Blackrock clan joined with the other under the command of . As the Mag'har and [[Lightbound]] [[war between the Lightbound and the Mag'har|clashed]], events on [[Azeroth]] would see to a [[Fourth War|new war]] between the [[Horde]] and the [[Alliance]]. In the midst of this, [[Eitrigg]] sought to travel to the and call upon the debt the Mag'har owed to the Horde for liberating them from [[Garrosh Hellscream]]'s meddling and the [[Burning Legion]]'s corruption. \nAs the entire Lightbound army was marching towards the Mag'har, Grommash ordered for the Mag'har to follow Geya'rah and fallback to Azeroth. Thus, when Warchief Hellscream and charged at the Lightbound, Eitrigg activated the shard of the [[Vision of Time]] in his possession in order to return to Azeroth with his new allies. After their arrival on Azeroth, Overlord Geya'rah took her place as leader of the Mag'har and pledged the loyalty of her people to [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Warchief Sylvanas Windrunner]] and the [[Horde]].\nSkin color.\nInterestingly, the orcs of the Blackrock clan have been shown to have gray skin, just like Rend's Blackrock faction. However, it was said that the gray skintone was a result of the Dark Horde Blackrock orcs dwelling in the inside of [[Blackrock Mountain]] for years and the other Blackrock orcs such as [[Varok Saurfang|Saurfang]] and [[Orgrim Doomhammer|Doomhammer]] had green skin. The Warcraft RTS games, particularly the first two in which the Blackrock clan played a major role, depicted Blackrock orcs as having green skin. It's possible that the origin of the gray skin has been [[retcon]]ned (despite being explained only recently) and that it now always was a natural part of the Blackrock clan. This would mean Blackrock characters like Saurfang currently have an outdated model. Alternatively, it could be that the Dark Horde regained their natural skin color via their alliance with Nefarian.\nThough, just like the ones in Blackrock Mountain, these orcs have been working in mountains ([[Blackrock Foundry]]) themselves building up siege weapons among other devices for the [[Iron Horde]], which could result in the same skin tones.\nReferences.\n[[Category:Blackrock clan| ]]\n[[Category:Alternate universe organizations\u200e]]"}

{"id": "13909", "revid": "22514", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=13909", "title": "Psychic Scream", "text": "Psychic Scream is a &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt; ability that causes up to 5 nearby enemies to run away in &lt;a href=\"fear%20effect\"&gt;fear&lt;/a&gt;. It is one of the priest's primary forms of &lt;a href=\"crowd%20control\"&gt;crowd control&lt;/a&gt;.\nTips and tactics.\nIn PvE.\nThe main drawback to the use of Psychic Scream in PvE is the potential for fleeing mobs to aggro other mobs, causing a number of additional enemies to attack the priest or their group. In many situations this can be disastrous, and situational awareness is required to use it successfully.\nShadow priests can use &lt;a href=\"Mind%20Flay\"&gt;Mind Flay&lt;/a&gt; to snare a feared enemy, reducing the potential distance they travel and therefore the likelihood that they will aggro other mobs. While damage may break the effect, Mind Flay counts as a &lt;a href=\"DoT\"&gt;DoT&lt;/a&gt; and so has a reduced chance of doing so.\nWhile Psychic Scream has the potential to affect several targets, some enemies are immune to fear, notably dungeon and raid Bosses, and all &lt;a href=\"Undead\"&gt;Undead&lt;/a&gt; mobs.\nPsychic Scream in PvP.\nPsychic Scream can be indispensable in PvP due to its ability to interrupt players and remove them from play for up to 8 seconds. However, many players have abilities that render them immune from fear effects, and others will make use of &lt;a href=\"PvP%20trinket\"&gt;PvP trinket&lt;/a&gt;s or similar abilities to end their fear prematurely. Damage taken may also cancel the effect. Psychic Scream also shares a &lt;a href=\"diminishing%20returns\"&gt;diminishing returns&lt;/a&gt; category with all other &lt;a href=\"fear%20effect\"&gt;fear effect&lt;/a&gt;s.\nWhile Shadow priests have a number of other options for \"single-target\" crowd control, such as &lt;a href=\"Silence\"&gt;Silence&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Psychic%20Horror\"&gt;Psychic Horror&lt;/a&gt;, Psychic Scream offers a powerful instant escape option from up to 5 opponents. With the exception of &lt;a href=\"Mind%20Control\"&gt;Mind Control&lt;/a&gt;, Discipline priests have no other &lt;a href=\"crowd%20control\"&gt;crowd control&lt;/a&gt; abilities, and Holy priests have only . To compensate, these two specs have the talent &lt;a href=\"Psychic%20Voice\"&gt;Psychic Voice&lt;/a&gt;, cutting the cooldown of Psychic Scream in half.\nPsychic Scream can allow priests time to cast spells uninterrupted, whether to heal or to deal damage, although direct damage spells will usually cause the effect to break. It is particularly useful when attempting to use &lt;a href=\"Mind%20Control\"&gt;Mind Control&lt;/a&gt; on the target, due to its lengthy cast time. When attempting to Mind Control the target off a cliff or edge, Psychic Scream can be doubly useful in propelling them most or all of the way toward it, although it will not in itself cause targets to walk off high edges.\nWhile direct damage will almost always break the effect, by placing several &lt;a href=\"DoT\"&gt;DoT&lt;/a&gt;s upon a target before fearing them and using Mind Flay, Shadow priests can cause significant amounts of damage while the enemy is helpless to respond, or escape.\nWhen survivability is not the priest's prime concern, Psychic Scream can also be used regularly as a form of damage mitigation. By placing himself within range of a number of enemy targets the priest can use the spell to prevent them from damaging his team mates, by causing them to flee or at the least interrupting casters. Damage caused to feared opponents will usually break the effect, so this is of greatest use when a group of players is focusing upon a single target - such as a flag carrier or healer - removing other enemies from the situation. The 8 yard range of Psychic Scream means that this use may require the priest to place himself in the midst of battle, and timing can be critical in affecting as many targets as possible. However, such direct intervention may draw an undesirable amount of attention to the priest.\nAlthough use of Psychic Scream will ideally result in enemies being feared for 8 seconds, trinkets, counters and the possibility of damage breaking the effect means that in PvP this will often not be possible. However Psychic Scream is still extremely valuable as a multiple-target interrupt, even if the effect is immediately broken. As with any interrupt, players may wish to save this ability for interrupting healers and casters at critical moments. Even non-casters such as hunters using &lt;a href=\"Aimed%20Shot\"&gt;Aimed Shot&lt;/a&gt; can be interrupted in this way to great effect. Psychic Scream can even be used while the target is &lt;a href=\"shield%20%28disambiguation%29\"&gt;shielded&lt;/a&gt; with certain spells (such as ) to interrupt them and prevent them from completing their cast. Damage taken (or absorbed) while under the protection of shield or damage reduction spells will still count toward Psychic Scream's damage threshold in full, and such spells will not reduce the likelihood of Psychic Scream breaking.\nFinally, Psychic Scream is of particular use in &lt;a href=\"battlegrounds\"&gt;battlegrounds&lt;/a&gt; when players are attempting to perform an action such as capturing a base or picking up a flag. In these situations the priest may wish to reserve Psychic Scream for use at these moments, potentially making the difference between a win and a loss. The spell can also be of critical use in slowing the progress of flag carriers, although the unpredictable path taken by feared opponents means that while the target may wander directly away from his goal (or toward your team mates) on occasion he will in fact continue to travel in the same direction."}

An adult pterrordax's sonic screeches are capable of turning a humanoid's eardrums to bloody pulps. &lt;a href=\"Zandalari\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s are known to use pterrordaxes as flying mounts.\nPterrordax eggs are incubated underneath the fossils of their forebears, allowing the hatchlings to absorb their ancestors' ferocity and intelligence. Pterrordaxes eat &lt;a href=\"direhorn\"&gt;direhorn&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAn intact pteradon skeleton recovered from Un'Goro Crater is exhibited in the &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Library%20%28Ironforge%29\"&gt;museum&lt;/a&gt;. Based on the skeletal structure, it is clear that its specific genus has not yet been encountered. The skeleton could have been preserved for any number of centuries beneath the region's rich soil.\nPterrordaxes have lungs capable of breathing air with a low saturation of oxygen, allowing them to live upon the highest peaks of &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt; where most species are unable to breathe. Pterrordaxes' salivary glands have restorative properties.\nAs a hunter pet.\nPterrordaxes are tamable by &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s as an exotic species, requiring Beast Mastery specialization.\nIn the RPG.\nPterrordax soar through the air, using their keen predator's senses to satisfy their taste for fresh meat. These fierce creatures stand as tall as a horse and weigh up to 1,500 pounds. Their pigmentation ranges from moss green to deep emerald. Claw-tipped wings stretch out from the back of the reptilian creature. Green eyes shine above a long, beaklike snout lined with razor teeth. While weaker than other dinosaurs, pterrordax possess great agility. Pterrordax prefer to hunt alone; normally, adventurers encounter them in pairs only during mating season, a two-week period in the springtime. Pterrordax may form flights when their breeding grounds are threatened by a strong foe, but disband once they eliminate the threat. A hungry pterrordax attacks any creature smaller than itself, disdaining carrion. It batters enemies to death with its clawed wings and tears the flesh from bones with its fanged beak. A badly wounded pterrordax retreats and flies back to its lair to rest.\nInspiration.\nPterrordax are likely based on the various fictionalized and fancy representations of flying reptiles in fiction, due to their aggressiveness, teeth and apparently having large prey as a food source. This situation in similar to that of the &lt;a href=\"raptor\"&gt;raptor&lt;/a&gt;s. Also notable is that while pterrordax are considered &lt;a href=\"dinosaur\"&gt;dinosaur&lt;/a&gt;s in the RPG, the real-world s that they are based on were not actually dinosaurs (though they were closely related to them).\nSpeculation.\nThey are likely closely related to &lt;a href=\"skyscreamer\"&gt;skyscreamer&lt;/a&gt;s who also go by the similar name of \"pterrorwing.\""}

{"id": "13078", "revid": "22514", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=13078", "title": "Pull", "text": "Pull, pulling, etc. Generally used to refer to the act of starting combat, normally with the aim to single out one (or as few as possible) &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;(s) from a larger group, with the intent to kill the pull target(s) without &lt;a href=\"aggro\"&gt;aggro&lt;/a&gt;ing the other mob(s).\nIn Vanilla and TBC, skilled pulling was an art form, and in many cases the key to winning a fight. &lt;a href=\"Garr\"&gt;Garr&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"High%20King%20Maulgar\"&gt;High King Maulgar&lt;/a&gt; were legendary for the difficulty of the initial pull, several 5 player instances featured very interesting combinations of trash mob patrol patterns. The question which class should pull is hotly contested, and probably has no correct answer. The most important factor is (as always) player skill. Nontheless in some situations, certain classes have abilities which predestine them to pull, but these situations have become pretty rare.\nPulling techniques.\nStandard ranged pull.\nThe most frequently used method of pulling is having the &lt;a href=\"main%20tank\"&gt;main tank&lt;/a&gt; do the job. The advantages of tank pulling are:\nThe disadvantages are:\nIn summary, this is a simple and fast method for pulling, but a rather risky one.\nSafety pull.\nIn some cases (particularly when several &lt;a href=\"patrol\"&gt;patrol&lt;/a&gt;s meet in complex patterns) a high amount of safety is required. The puller should then move further ahead of the party, at least 30 yards. This gives him enough room to abort the pull if something went wrong.\nBody pulling.\nWhenever a fight is started by a player moving into the &lt;a href=\"aggro%20radius\"&gt;aggro radius&lt;/a&gt; of a mob, this is called a body pull. In many cases, body pulls are not intentional. In situations where nothing can go wrong, warriors like to pull by &lt;a href=\"charge\"&gt;charging&lt;/a&gt; the mob. This gives them a good amount of rage to start with. If there's more than one mob, they also stay close together, minimizing problems with ranged damage dealers.\nA more subtle form of the body pull makes use of the fact that for many mobs the range at which they detect damage is larger than the range at which they aggro from proximity. Thus, entering the aggro radius of one mob aggros that one for sure. His friends though may stay behind if the first mob does not take damage, whereas they may join the fray if the pull is done with damage. Using non-damaging abilities like &lt;a href=\"Faerie%20Fire\"&gt;Faerie Fire&lt;/a&gt; also makes use of these different ranges.\nThe term \"face pulling\" is used to indicate that a body pull was careless or otherwise unintentional. Often used when a player who is not the tank initiates combat.\nCrowd-control pulling.\nIn some situations, crowd control is the most important aspect of the fight, and the pull is conducted using some CC ability (like &lt;a href=\"Polymorph\"&gt;Polymorph&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Shackle%20Undead\"&gt;Shackle Undead&lt;/a&gt;). In such cases, the tank must immediately draw aggro from the puller. See &lt;a href=\"Crowd%20Control\"&gt;Crowd Control&lt;/a&gt; for details.\nLOS pull / Corner pull.\nWhen the mob group contains ranged damage dealers, very frequently the \"round the corner\" pull is used. After drawing aggro, the puller runs around a corner or behind some obstacle, so that the mobs can't see him any more. They follow and thus come close enough for the party to attack them. In this situation it is imperative that the party keeps strict discipline and does nothing to aggro any mobs while they are still moving. While waiting for the mobs to come, it is also common that the tank lays down some kind of temporary AoE-effect (such as &lt;a href=\"Consecration\"&gt;Consecration&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Death%20and%20Decay\"&gt;Death and Decay&lt;/a&gt;) which immediately generates more aggro on the mobs when they round the corner and step onto the AoE.\nBe aware with any strategy that involves line of sight that healers need line of sight to their tanks to heal - if the healer is in the wrong place, the LOS pull can put the puller out of the healer's LOS too.\nSplit pull.\nThis is a very advanced pulling method. It's difficult, but very well possible to split some mob groups with precisely timed &lt;a href=\"Feign%20Death\"&gt;Feign Death&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Vanish\"&gt;Vanish&lt;/a&gt;. This is achieved by having the hunter or rogue in question &lt;a href=\"Feign%20Death\"&gt;Feign Death&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Vanish\"&gt;Vanish&lt;/a&gt; when one part of the mob group is close enough to another player to aggro him, while the rest of the mobs are not yet close enough, and thus return to their original positions. Some highly artificial forms of split pulling have been declared a bannable offense by Blizzard, but in the meantime most of these methods have been made impossible by patches. The standard form (as described here) is not bannable under any circumstances.\nHunters.\nIf there is a class designed for the pulling job, it's the &lt;a href=\"Hunter\"&gt;Hunter&lt;/a&gt; class. &lt;a href=\"Tracking\"&gt;Tracking&lt;/a&gt; helps a lot when evaluating patrol patterns, Hunters have ranged instant pulls, they can integrate CC into the pull (with their traps), they can transfer aggro with &lt;a href=\"Misdirection\"&gt;Misdirection&lt;/a&gt;, and can easily abort with &lt;a href=\"Feign%20Death\"&gt;Feign Death&lt;/a&gt;. An experienced Hunter pulling is a great asset for every group, especially in complex situations. Since good pulling is an ability which requires lots of practise, it is a good idea to let the hunter do most of the pulling, even if this makes things a little slower sometimes (when misdirection is on CD and the tank needs a little extra effort to transfer aggro)."}

This is done using abilities that lower aggro range such as &lt;a href=\"Mind%20Soothe\"&gt;Mind Soothe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Soothe%20Animal\"&gt;Soothe Animal&lt;/a&gt; and methods to disengage from combat if too many mob's are pulled via abilities such as &lt;a href=\"vanish\"&gt;vanish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Feign%20Death\"&gt;Feign Death&lt;/a&gt;. Occasionally pulling will be done by a class with &lt;a href=\"CC\"&gt;CC&lt;/a&gt; abilities by applying crowd control to a single mob in a group that has yet to attack, which will effectively pull every other mob in the group but ensure at least one mob is CC before it can do any damage. Since the more powerful CC classes also tend to have lower survivability (such as a &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; using &lt;a href=\"polymorph\"&gt;polymorph&lt;/a&gt;) caution or careful coordination with another puller should be taken when attempting this tactic.\nThe best puller would be the one who knows how to select the most vulnerable and isolated mobs, is capable of making the pull appropriately (bearing in mind timing) and can prevent &lt;a href=\"add\"&gt;add&lt;/a&gt;s while doing it. The puller does not necessarily have to be the &lt;a href=\"tank\"&gt;tank&lt;/a&gt;. The hunter was designed as the idealized puller, possessing &lt;a href=\"tracking\"&gt;tracking&lt;/a&gt; and assorted other talents allowing them to know the location of nearby mobs prior to attempting pull, strong range attack, ability to &lt;a href=\"Feign%20Death\"&gt;Feign Death&lt;/a&gt; to disengage if too many are pulled, both &lt;a href=\"Feign%20Death\"&gt;Feign Death&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Misdirection\"&gt;Misdirection&lt;/a&gt; allow for quick passing of aggro to the main tank after pull. Despite the pulling potential of hunters and other classes many parties, especially during lower levels, will not want to wait for the slower (and safer) pulling methods and will simply have their tank pull."}

{"id": "20256", "revid": "26060681", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=20256", "title": "Dath'Remar Sunstrider", "text": "Dath'Remar Sunstrider was the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; who survived the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;. He became the founder of the &lt;a href=\"kingdom\"&gt;kingdom&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; and the first of its royal family, the &lt;a href=\"Sunstrider%20dynasty\"&gt;Sunstrider dynasty&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nDath'Remar Sunstrider was born a member of the wealthy and powerful Highborne. His family name was an ancient one, but most night elves had always considered it somewhat odd, given that they were primarily a nocturnal people who worshiped the goddess &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;. Even his appearance was strange, for his auburn hair bore streaks of gold.\nAccording to rumors passed down through generations, a young Dath'Remar dreamed of the weapon &lt;a href=\"Felo%27melorn\"&gt;Felo'melorn&lt;/a&gt;. In that dream, the &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; blade burned like the sun and dispatched so many enemies that it created a swift-flowing river of blood. Dath'Remar would later recount the specifics of the blade's appearance to the renowned magesmith &lt;a href=\"Luminarian\"&gt;Luminarian&lt;/a&gt; who crafted the weapon on his arcane &lt;a href=\"forge\"&gt;forge&lt;/a&gt;.\nA poor bargain.\nRegardless of Dath'Remar's unusual name and appearance, he, like the rest of his caste, was fascinated by the first &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;. Over time &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt; and the rest of the Highborne became obsessed with studying and harnessing the Well's magic. Their abuse of that magic provoked violent storms around the Well and attracted the notice of &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"dark%20titan\"&gt;dark titan&lt;/a&gt;, who quickly enthralled the helpless night elves and bent them to his will. He promised to remake Azeroth into a paradise if the night elves helped him enter their world. Working toward that goal, the deluded Highborne summoned increasing numbers of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; into the palace. Eventually, these demons marched out of the palace and began slaughtering night elves. They quickly leveled most of the capital city, &lt;a href=\"Zin-Azshari\"&gt;Zin-Azshari&lt;/a&gt;. Only the Highborne and their homes were spared. Dath'Remar was even offered to be turned into a &lt;a href=\"satyr\"&gt;satyr&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Xavius\"&gt;Xavius&lt;/a&gt; but declined, becoming increasingly uneasy over the Highborne's affiliation with the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe night elf race scrambled to defend itself, and the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; broke out. Even so, the Highborne worked feverishly to widen and stabilize the portal they had opened into the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;, so that Sargeras could use it to reach Azeroth. They abandoned all their other studies of the Well; they hardly slept, if at all; and they ate and drank so little that they became skeletally thin. Even so, Sargeras' lieutenants were displeased with the Highborne's slow progress and proved quick to slay spellcasters who faltered in their duties. Many of the Highborne broke free of Sargeras' influence and realized that they had made a foolish choice in serving the Legion. Although Sargeras had made glorious promises, he had provided nothing but grueling and thankless work. It seemed likely that instead of rebuilding the world, Sargeras intended to destroy it.\nEscape from Zin-Azshari.\nWord reached Dath'Remar that High Priestess &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; had been captured by the Legion and taken to the palace. He was appalled to hear that the leader of the Sisters of Elune had been made a prisoner of the demons. Accordingly, he learned the location of her prison cell and paid her a secret visit. She proved a sympathetic listener, and so he found himself confiding in her. Working in secret, he formed a desperate plan. He contacted all the other Highborne who had come to consider the Burning Legion the enemy. Then he went to visit Tyrande one last time. He explained that he and a group of other Highborne were leaving the palace. They had agreed to help her escape if she would speak to the night elf defenders on behalf of the rebel Highborne. She quickly agreed, for she believed in the compassionate teachings of Elune and felt that the Highborne deserved a chance to redeem themselves for their reckless actions.\nDuring the escape, Tyrande was unexpectedly separated from the rebel Highborne when she was snatched into the air by an attacking demon. Dath'Remar and others were attacked by guards of the Highborne still loyal to the Burning Legion. He waved his hand and the guards flew into a wall. He said, \"That will teach them to dare attack a Highborne of the Elite Circle.\" Nevertheless, Dath'Remar and many of the other Highborne managed to escape the palace, rendezvous with the rest of the night elves and joined the &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Resistance\"&gt;Kaldorei Resistance&lt;/a&gt; to the opposition of many night elves. As Dath'Remar fought against the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s with Felo'melorn in hands. The weapon brought hope among the night elven defenders.\nLater, the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt; created a new ocean, and both groups of night elves were forced to flee for their lives. The rushing waters pursued the elves all the way to &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; before finally subsiding. On Mount Hyjal, the Highborne and the Resistance reunited once more. Dath'Remar and a few other night elves soon discovered that &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; had stolen several vials of pure energy from the first Well of Eternity, and then emptied three of the vials into a normal lake. In doing so, he had created a second Well of Eternity. He considered himself a hero, but most other night elves disagreed. They confiscated the remaining vials from Illidan and sentenced him to imprisonment for the rest of his immortal life.\nExile of the Highborne.\n7,300 years ago, in the centuries following the Sundering, relations between the Highborne and the rest of the night elves were strained. The Highborne's abuse of arcane magic had led to the Burning Legion's invasion and the shattering of ancient Kalimdor. Countless night elves had been killed by the demons. Thus, arcane magic was now a crime punishable by death. Regardless, Dath'Remar and the rest of the Highborne continued practicing their sorcery. As the highest caste of ancient night elf society, the Highborne had studied arcane magic for more than a thousand years before Queen Azshara came to the throne. Most other night elves had significantly less knowledge and skill at manipulating arcane energies. The Highborne had no intention of surrendering the magic they saw as their birthright. They felt that the lower-caste majority had neither the right nor the ability to judge the safety of arcane magic. Nor were the Highborne the only ones to maintain that arcane magic was worth pursuing.\nThe Highborne soon grew bold in defying the new laws against arcane magic. They would not bow to the hysterical fears of the lower-caste majority. The Highborne felt they had taken all the necessary precautions by resolving to be more cautious than their predecessors. After all, the Highborne had no desire to bring about another Sundering. Rather than execute the Highborne, the rest of the night elves sentenced them to exile after they had unleashed a terrible magical storm over &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;. The Highborne were thoroughly exasperated by what they saw as a foolish overreaction against sorcery. They were therefore not unhappy at the prospect of exile; on the contrary, they looked forward to it. Thinking ahead, they contrived to steal one of the magical vials that had been confiscated from Illidan.\nFounding of Quel'Thalas.\nThe exiled Highborne then eagerly sailed to the Eastern Kingdoms, still under Dath'Remar's leadership. Gradually the Highborne lost their connection to the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity%20%28Hyjal%29\"&gt;second Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;, though Dath'Remar had prepared for this eventuality too.\nAll the same, they struggled onward. Deep within the northern forests of the continent, in the continent of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, they founded the magical kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;. Using the vial the Highborne had stolen, Dath'Remar created the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;, a fountain of magical energy that, while weaker than the original, Dath'Remar claimed would one day become stronger than its predecessor. That day, the &lt;a href=\"high%20elven\"&gt;high elven&lt;/a&gt; race was born, the energies of the great well immediately altering the elves' appearance from their night elven forebears. Dath'Remar led his people in the magical construction of their new nation.\nThe Sunwell was designed to be constantly but exclusively available to the high elves, who chose its name as a further renunciation of night elf society. Dath'Remar was crowned the first king of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; and though he did not rule, the king retained a modicum of political power.\nDath'Remar's signature weapon was the sword &lt;a href=\"Felo%27melorn\"&gt;Felo'melorn&lt;/a&gt;, also known as Flamestrike, which became an heirloom of the Sunstrider dynasty and has been wielded by his descendants to the last of the Sunstriders, &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Prince Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegacy.\nDath'Remar's throne was inherited by four of his descendants over the years. His earliest named successor (following two unnamed monarchs) was &lt;a href=\"Anasterian%20Sunstrider\"&gt;King Anasterian Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;, who reigned Quel'Thalas for roughly 2,800 years, presiding over conflicts such as the &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Wars\"&gt;Troll Wars&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, and the waning moments of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;. In the wake of the Third War, Quel'Thalas was nearly scoured from Azeroth: a &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; invasion saw almost 90% of the kingdom's population culled, King Anasterian slain, and Dath'Remar's royal legacy left in the sole hands of &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Prince Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe high elves took up the name \"&lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;\" in the wake of this devastation, and had a monument called the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Dath%27Remar\"&gt;Shrine of Dath'Remar&lt;/a&gt; created in their first king's honor.\nName.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"The%20Founding%20of%20Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;The Founding of Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; Dath'Remar took his ancestral name Sunstrider, meaning 'he who walks in the day,' after they landed in the Tirisfal Glades. According to the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients%20Trilogy\"&gt;War of the Ancients Trilogy&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20Encyclopedia\"&gt;Warcraft Encyclopedia&lt;/a&gt;, Dath'Remar already had the name Sunstrider. Although apparently there is a Remar dynasty as well, &lt;a href=\"blood%20mage\"&gt;Kath'ranis Remar&lt;/a&gt;. It's unclear which sides of the family Remar and Sunstrider originate.\nIn the RPG.\nDath'Remar owned the &lt;a href=\"Sunstrider%27s%20Longbow\"&gt;Sunstrider's Longbow&lt;/a&gt;."}

Finally they ran into a dead end and were cornered. &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tichondrius\"&gt;Tichondrius&lt;/a&gt; then revealed themselves to Tyrande's horror and disbelief. Archimonde gloated that the Legion had returned to consume this world, and that this time the Night Elves would not stop them. His Doomguards then killed Tyrande's archers, but just as they closed in on the Priestess herself, she used her powers to meld with the shadows. A furious Archimonde killed one of the Doomguards and ordered the others to find and kill Tyrande. \nThe Doomguards dispersed unaware that Tyrande was standing exactly where she was before. When the demons were gone, Tyrande set out to cross the river and warn the rest of the Sentinels. Getting out of the immediate area was not an easy task as the Doomguards still patrolled the area.\nShe found out that the Doomguards were corrupting the forests by order of Archimonde. While evading the Doomguards, Tyrande recovered a few magical items - including a Druid Pouch and a pair of Slippers of Agility. She also freed an imprisoned &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt; which distracted the nearby Doomguards long enough for Tyrande to slip by (the furbolg was not so lucky). She finally crossed a bridge to relative safety, where she found a group of night elf &lt;a href=\"archer\"&gt;archer&lt;/a&gt;s waiting for her.\nTyrande and her small group ran into a fight between human footmen and ghouls. Tyrande observed that the humans were also enemies of the undead, however, she refused the idea of allying with them. The night elves hid from the battle until most of the humans and undead were slain. They then finished off the survivors. Tyrande also salvaged a magical Ring of Superiority from the humans' camp. \nTyrande and her troops then stumbled upon another battle - this one between the undead and the orcs. Tyrande stole a Mantle of Intelligence from the distracted orcs and then led her sisters to a nearby Waygate.\nThe Waygate transported the night elves to a small lake, where they met a group of &lt;a href=\"huntress\"&gt;huntress&lt;/a&gt;es. The huntresses warned Tyrande that the Doomguards nearby were using &lt;a href=\"shade\"&gt;shade&lt;/a&gt;s which could see through the night elves' shadowmeld powers. Fortunately, the huntresses had placed owl sentinels on the trees which could detect the shades. Furthermore, Tyrande had enough troops with her now that they could take down lone Doomguards. The night elves carefully picked off the shades and Doomguards one at a time. Tyrande retrieved a Ring of Protection and a pair of Gloves of Haste from the demons' possession. She also ran into a fight between some footmen and a single Doomguard. The Doomguard slew all the humans, but suffered damage during the fight. Tyrande and her troops easily finished off the Doomguard which dropped a magical Tome of Strength.\nTyrande encountered more night elves by a Fountain of Health. She also found some abandoned &lt;a href=\"ballista\"&gt;ballista&lt;/a&gt;e. Her forces killed a couple more Doomguards which were guarding another magical Tome and a Mana Stone. Tyrande found yet more night elves and ballistae at the edge of an undead base.\nBy this time, the sun had risen, and now the night elves were no longer able to meld with the shadows. They would have to fight their way past the undead now. Tyrande used the ballistae to level the Spirit Towers and then led her troops against the undead. The night elves destroyed the undead base and Tyrande finally arrived at the night elf outpost where &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt; was waiting for her. Tyrande informed Shandris that the Burning Legion had returned and that the Druids must be awoken.\nQuests.\nMain Quests.\nEscape into Shadow.\n\"The Burning Legion has invaded Ashenvale and placed the land under a terrible pall.

But the truth was that Davin never wanted to be a soldier and was actually a tremendous coward. He was physically strong and managed to fake it through training, considering he was never in real danger, but was hopeless as he engaged in real combat. What saved his career was being part of a particularly talented platoon, from whom he could bask in the reflected talent and glory. One day, he and his men faced off against renegade &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; who had come to his village to try to escape dwarven justice after a failed attempt to overthrow the &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;existing government&lt;/a&gt;.\nToward the end of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, Davin and his men were sent with a &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; to investigate a &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic stronghold. Due to his cowardice, Davin's entire expedition died while he hid himself to survive. He returned to his people and as the lone survivor got a promotion, being hailed as a hero for surviving the deadly onslaught and coming back to report what had happened. After the events of the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Durotar\"&gt;invasion of Durotar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Daelin&lt;/a&gt;'s death, Davin was left in charge of Northwatch, a duty he had originally welcomed for being peaceful and uneventful.\n&lt;a href=\"Lorena\"&gt;Lorena&lt;/a&gt; visited his fortress in order to find out why an Alliance ship did not help an orcish ship that had been attacked by pirates. Later on, he learned from &lt;a href=\"Rych\"&gt;Rych&lt;/a&gt;, that Captain &lt;a href=\"Joq\"&gt;Joq&lt;/a&gt; was arrested because of an argument with an orc in &lt;a href=\"Ratchet\"&gt;Ratchet&lt;/a&gt;. He sent word to &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore Isle&lt;/a&gt; to ask for more reinforcements, a move that would be seen by the Horde as an act of aggression. Later on, both human and orcish armies arrived near Northwatch. Davin and his army battled against orcs and trolls. During the battle, he saw a zeppelin arrive to the battlefront. &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; came out from the zeppelin and ended the battle by revealing that &lt;a href=\"Burx\"&gt;Burx&lt;/a&gt; had allied himself with a demon named &lt;a href=\"Zmodlor\"&gt;Zmodlor&lt;/a&gt;. Davin was near the two orcs and Burx in his last act, charged at Davin. As Burx was about to kill Davin, Thrall charged at Burx and denounced him by ending his life. Thrall apologized to Davin for what has happened and both human and orcish armies retreated. Shortly after that, Davin handed his letter of resignation from the military."}

Your job is to bring it deep within the Scholomance.\nThe undead mage Vectus leads a team of &lt;a href=\"scourge\"&gt;scourge&lt;/a&gt; scholars... place Dawn's Gambit in their chamber, called the \"viewing room.\" It will then react with the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; found there and, with a little luck, destroy them!\nAfter that, defeating Vectus shouldn't be a problem. Right?\nRewards.\nYou will also receive:\nProgress.\nRemember, &lt;name&gt; - we must be tolerant yet rigid in our beliefs!\nCompletion.\nYou did it! Vectus is defeated! And Dawn's Gambit... did it work?\nHm... maybe my device wasn't the success I had hoped, but I'm glad you were able to handle things anyway. Well done, &lt;name&gt;!\nThe &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt;, and the good people of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, are in your debt.\nNotes.\nWhen you place the item in the viewing room, all the previously non-aggressive students in that room turn aggressive and most of them will aggro immediately, so be prepared to deal with 30 or so fairly weak level 59 non-elites, i.e. shield the clothies ahead of time, bunch up the mobs, and pour on the AoE. The bosses - a 59 elite and a 60 elite - do not aggro, and can be pulled individually after the students are down."}

She has device she wants you to test out that \"should\" extract the essence of the nearby broodlings for study.\nYou volunteer to take her device and zap a number of broodlings, and collect their essences. The broodlings are a nuisance anyway...\nTinkee's study of the essences you brought her have given her ideas of how dragon whelp eggs might be frozen. But she needs help from a colleague of hers, &lt;a href=\"Felnok%20Steelspring\"&gt;Felnok Steelspring&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Everlook\"&gt;Everlook&lt;/a&gt;. It's a postman's work, but now she's got you curious.\nUp in &lt;a href=\"Winterspring\"&gt;Winterspring&lt;/a&gt;, Felnok is freezing. Big surprise, it's cold up there. He's collected the parts Tinkee needs, with one exception: \"uncracked\" horns from the &lt;a href=\"Chillwind%20Chimaera\"&gt;Chillwind Chimaera&lt;/a&gt;s that make winterspring their home.\nApparently they are \"packed with cold\" or something. Tinkee can sort it out, all you have to do is gather them.\nFelnok packages up the parts, and sends you back to Tinkee. Yippee, another intercontinental trip. Hope you remembered to book First Class this time.\nTinkee has finished a prototype of a dragon egg freezing device, and wants you to test it out. The eggs to test it on, though, are in a &lt;a href=\"rookery\"&gt;rookery&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;. And for that, you will need to find some help.\nYou gather a fair number of friends with you, and storm Blackrock Spire. You wade through blackrock legion orcs, black dragonkin, and various minions of &lt;a href=\"Rend%20Blackhand\"&gt;Rend Blackhand&lt;/a&gt;, even braving the &lt;a href=\"Pyroguard%20Emberseer\"&gt;Pyroguard Emberseer&lt;/a&gt; to get to the rookery. Your party soon finds that the eggs are easily disturbed, causing the whelps inside to hatch. Exceedingly gingerly, you approach an egg and fire the &lt;a href=\"Eggscilloscope%20Prototype\"&gt;Eggscilloscope&lt;/a&gt; at it. Success!\nYou return with the news of the device's success. Tinkee is overjoyed to hear it. With the success of the Eggscilloscope, she's added a &lt;a href=\"Collectronic%20Module\"&gt;collection module&lt;/a&gt; and (much to your relief) increased the range. But... she wants you to go back to the rookery and collect 8 dragon eggs. After freezing them, of course.\nOy, vey. Nothing for it. You bend a few arms, place a few bribes, or butter up your friends (whichever tactic works) and off you go to Blackrock Spire again. The denizens of Blackrock Spire are no more happy to see you this time than they were last time. You get hacked at, bitten, flamed, and all. Still, you manage to collect the eggs.\nTinkee reveals that the person she's working for (and wants to keep very, very happy) is someone named &lt;a href=\"Vectus\"&gt;Vectus&lt;/a&gt;. However, someone named &lt;a href=\"Leonid%20Barthalomew\"&gt;Leonid Barthalomew&lt;/a&gt; apparently knows him and wants the eggs delivered to him at &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Eastern Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;. Since \"nobody knows her master unless he allows it\", it must be authentic.\nSo you get handed the bundle of frozen eggs and take them to the Eastern Plaguelands. At least it isn't Winterspring again...\nIt turns out that Leonid isn't actually associated with Vectus. But that's a good thing, since Vectus is part of the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Cult of the Damned&lt;/a&gt;, and has been trying to create a \"&lt;a href=\"plagued%20dragonflight\"&gt;plagued dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;\". Fortunately, Leonid intercepted the eggs before they got to the cult.\nLeonid asks you to take the eggs to &lt;a href=\"Betina%20Bigglezink\"&gt;Betina Bigglezink&lt;/a&gt;, nearby. She immediately takes the eggs out and puts them safely away, but what she is really interested in is the container.\nThere are undead scholars in &lt;a href=\"Scholomance\"&gt;Scholomance&lt;/a&gt;, of which Vectus is the leader. Betina wants you to take a device she has created and named &lt;a href=\"Dawn%27s%20Gambit\"&gt;Dawn's Gambit&lt;/a&gt; into Scholomance in the egg crate. She is hoping that it will destroy the scholars and their leader, but isn't \"quite\" sure that it will work.\nYou're really quite happy to stop anyone who wants to make diseased and corrupted dragons, so you take the chest and with the help of a few friends venture into the &lt;a href=\"Viewing%20Room\"&gt;Viewing Room&lt;/a&gt; in Scholomance.\nThere, you find Vectus along with &lt;a href=\"Marduk%20Blackpool\"&gt;Marduk Blackpool&lt;/a&gt;, and a large number of students. You put the device on the floor and activate it (being sure to step briskly away from it!). The box levitates, separates, and opens in a burst of light. The flesh of the undead students is burned away, but Vectus and Marduk seem only little affected. Time to resort to the \"old fashioned way\", and bludgeon the bones into shards, and slice the two tutors into .\nYou return to Betina and report the partial success of the device, and the destruction of Vectus and Marduk. On behalf of the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt;, Bentia rewards you.\nRewards.\nFrom &lt;a href=\"Return%20to%20Tinkee\"&gt;Return to Tinkee&lt;/a&gt;, you gain one of or .\nFor completing &lt;a href=\"Dawn%27s%20Gambit\"&gt;Dawn's Gambit&lt;/a&gt;, you gain one of:\nYou gain some &lt;a href=\"reputation\"&gt;reputation&lt;/a&gt;:"}

Knaak&lt;/a&gt;. It focuses on the former &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt; dealing with losing their immortal powers after defeating &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, and there will also be flashbacks to the time before they first became Aspects in the era of &lt;a href=\"Galakrond\"&gt;Galakrond&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"proto-dragon\"&gt;proto-dragon&lt;/a&gt;s.\nDescription.\nTHE AGE OF DRAGONS IS OVER.\nUncertainty plagues &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s ancient guardians as they struggle to find a new purpose. This dilemma has hit &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt;, youngest of the former Dragon Aspects, especially hard. Having lost his great powers, how can he\u2014or any of his kind\u2014still make a difference in the world?\nThe answer lies in the distant past, when savage beasts called proto-dragons ruled the skies. Through a mysterious artifact found near the heart of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, Kalecgos witnesses this violent era and the shocking history of the original Aspects: &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt;, Neltharion, and &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn their most primitive forms, the future protectors of Azeroth must stand united against Galakrond, a bloodthirsty creature that threatens the existence of their race. But did these mere proto-dragons face such a horrific adversary alone, or did an outside force help them? Were they given the strength they would become legendary for...or did they earn it with blood? Kalecgos\u2019s discoveries will change everything he knows about the events that led to the...\nDAWN OF THE ASPECTS\nPart 1.\nThe former Dragon Aspects are on the brink of going their separate ways to forge new destinies. As Kalecgos ponders the uncertain future awaiting his kind, he uncovers a mysterious artifact that allows him to see through the eyes of his late predecessor, Malygos. Intense visions bombard Kalecgos, transporting him to a time when the original Aspects were no more than primitive proto-dragons. Across ancient &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s northern plains, they fought for survival against each other and a terrifying creature that dominated the era: the Father of Dragons, Galakrond. But many questions remain for Kalecgos. What are the origins of this strange artifact? Are its visions a gift, or a curse?\nPart 2.\nPowerful visions of history torment Kalecgos, forcing him to witness Galakrond's brutality firsthand. The ravenous beast terrorizes ancient Kalimdor, consuming everyone in his path. The original Aspects and other proto-dragons struggle to temper their savage rivalries long enough to make a stand against their merciless enemy, but their efforts might prove useless. A horrific new threat is rising from Galakrond's shadow: the undead. Apart from this chilling discovery, Kalecgos is troubled by a mysterious hooded figure from the distant past who appears in the present, pushing the blue dragon's sanity to the breaking point.\nPart 3.\nAlliances and betrayals are taking shape among the ancient proto-dragons as they rally against Galakrond. Kalecgos\u2014seeing these events through Malygos's eyes\u2014is quickly losing a sense of his own identity. Amid harrowing attacks from undead and living proto-dragons, the former blue Aspect is finding it harder to separate the past from the present\u2026 and his thoughts from those of Malygos. Meanwhile, the archmage Jaina Proudmoore launches an investigation of the strange artifact granting Kalecgos visions of history. Her efforts lead to startling discoveries about the relic's origins and the deadly fate that may lie ahead for her blue dragon companion.\nPart 4.\nChaos grips the icy wastes of ancient Kalimdor. A united group of proto-dragons has taken wing for a daring assault against Galakrond and his throngs of mindless undead. The blue dragon Kalecgos bears mute witness to the chilling battle through the eyes of his predecessor, Malygos. He and his new comrades\u2014Alexstrasza, Nozdormu, Ysera, and Neltharion\u2014soon find themselves struggling tooth and claw for survival. Their only hope for the future may lie with an enigmatic figure named Tyr. But even with the aid of this mighty stranger, do the proto-dragons have any chance of withstanding Galakrond\u2019s fury?\nPart 5.\nTime is running out for Kalec. The strange artifact forcing him to experience past events will soon destroy the blue dragon's identity. As Jaina Proudmoore struggles to break the relic's hold over Kalec, visions of ancient history continue assaulting him. Through the eyes of Malygos, he witnesses a desperate fight taking shape above the icy wastes of northern Kalimdor. Galakrond, driven by an insatiable hunger, is poised to consume all life on the continent. Only five proto-dragons\u2014Alexstrasza, Malygos, Nozdormu, Neltharion, and Ysera\u2014possess the courage to stand against the monstrous creature. This thrilling finale to the Dawn of the Aspects series will reveal the mysteries behind the artifact, Galakrond's gruesome corruption, and the climactic battle that changed Azeroth forever\u2014the battle that gave rise to the age of the dragons.\nTimeline.\nThe main events of the book some time after Jaina and Kalec joined Kirin Tor, following the death of Deathwing and the destruction of Theramore. When Jaina and Kalecgos were speaking shortly after Kalec found the Spark of Tyr, Jaina mentions that since his last visit of Dalaran \"things have turned upside down\" and that she has \"been forced to make some changes\" she didn't like. This could potentially refer to the events of the &lt;a href=\"purge%20of%20Dalaran\"&gt;purge of Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;.\nInconsistencies.\nAlthough the book acknowledges the destruction of Theramore, and Jaina's ascension into the Council of Six, it also says that \"Jaina had also had to balance her duties on the council with governing the island kingdom of Theramore.\"\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

They have two outposts in the &lt;a href=\"Krasarang%20Wilds\"&gt;Krasarang Wilds&lt;/a&gt;, one is &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Cleft\"&gt;Thunder Cleft&lt;/a&gt; and the other is &lt;a href=\"Dawnchaser%20Retreat\"&gt;Dawnchaser Retreat&lt;/a&gt;. Members of the tribe, particularly their Chief, &lt;a href=\"Sunwalker%20Dezco\"&gt;Sunwalker Dezco&lt;/a&gt;, are occasionally encountered elsewhere. Some background information for the tribe was established by a short story, \"&lt;a href=\"Bleeding%20Sun\"&gt;Bleeding Sun&lt;/a&gt;\", published on the official website.\nHistory.\nFor several months the Chief's wife, Leza, dreamed of the vale. Even Dezco and other tauren had visions of the vale as well, but it was the strongest in Leza. The tribe set out from their small enclave within the sunny plains of &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt; on a journey to find &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, and the vale deep within the continent. Along the voyage three of their four vessels were destroyed by the violent storms, which caused the death of many friends and family from the tribe. Only one vessel made landfall in the &lt;a href=\"Krasarang%20Wilds\"&gt;coastal jungles&lt;/a&gt; of Pandaria.\nOnce they made it here, they set up &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Cleft\"&gt;Thunder Cleft&lt;/a&gt; as their base to be used in the search for the vale and for Leza to have her babies. After Leza gave birth the tribe continued on in their search for weeks until they finally discovered the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt;. They, along with some Horde that followed them, moved into the vale and settled at the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Two%20Moons\"&gt;Shrine of Two Moons&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt was the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Lotus\"&gt;Golden Lotus&lt;/a&gt;, guardians of the vale, that welcomed the tribe into land and allowed them to use the shrine as their own. This vale would become their new home.\nCulture.\nThe Dawnchaser tribe carries a number of traditions rarely found in other tauren tribes, including:\nTrivia.\nAt &lt;a href=\"Dawnchaser%20Retreat\"&gt;Dawnchaser Retreat&lt;/a&gt; Dezco says that one of his sons \"is named 'Kor', for my &lt;a href=\"Kor%20Bloodtusk\"&gt;oldest friend&lt;/a&gt;\" and the other \"is named\" the player's name \"for his savior\". That was contradicted by the \"Bleeding Sun\" short story. Instead, the story indicates that Dezco merely intended to name them that way later, but for the purposes of the story they were named \"Redhorn\" and \"Cloudhoof\". The story rationalized the alternate names by indicating that the tribe used temporary \"weaning names\"."}

Resurrect instantly and just stand there while waiting on the costume cooldown to keep attacking. Other players will get credit for your character's death if your character still has the buff (it lasts through death), even if your character cannot actively attack.\nAnother method is to use graveyard resurrection sickness, for those who can't enter raids, but make sure to put all armor that takes durability damage in the bank while doing this.\nA macro to make competitive killing easier:\n codice_1\nThis removes the stun/knockdown caused by others, and causes you to attack.\nRacial home city graveyards.\n1Pandaren can only complete the quest at a neutral city."}

Rhonin twisted around so as to see the heavens--and saw instead a hellish sight.\nA dragon the color of raging fire filled the sky above and in its forepaws it held what remained of his horse and his costly and carefully chosen supplies. The crimson leviathan consumed in one gulp the rest of the carcass, eyes already fixed on the tiny, pathetic figures below.\nAnd seated atop the shoulders of the beast, a grotesque, greenish figure with tusks and a battle axe barked orders in some harsh tongue and pointed directly at Rhonin.\nMaw gaping and talons bared, the dragon dove toward him.\"\nPlot.\nThe novel opens at the waning days of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; having already been captured, and most of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Orcish Horde&lt;/a&gt; having already surrendered. A few &lt;a href=\"clan\"&gt;clan&lt;/a&gt;s of orcs remain scattered about Azeroth, including the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw orcs&lt;/a&gt;, who, holed up in &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;, maintain control over the Red Dragonflight. &lt;a href=\"Nekros%20Skullcrusher\"&gt;Nekros Skullcrusher&lt;/a&gt; still holds the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Demon Soul&lt;/a&gt;, and wields it against the captive &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; forcing her to mate with her consorts to produce more dragons, although her ability to do so is deteriorating, along with her health and the health of her consorts. \nThe dragon mage &lt;a href=\"Krasus\"&gt;Krasus&lt;/a&gt;, desperate to save his queen Alexstrasza, secretly enlists the help of &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt; (then holding an ignominious reputation) in order to send him on a secret mission to &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt; to free her, while also soliciting the aid of the other &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt;. In doing so, &lt;a href=\"Vereesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Vereesa Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; is assigned to the task of seeing Rhonin to the seaport &lt;a href=\"Hasic\"&gt;Hasic&lt;/a&gt; on his way to Khaz Modan, ostensibly so that he may undertake a mission of observation at Grim Batol. Vereesa suspects otherwise.\nMeanwhile, &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, posing as the noble Lord Prestor, works his way into the diplomatic negotiations involving Alterac, and uses his spellwork to influence King Terenas into declaring that he will succeed the deposed King Perenolde of Alterac. From this vantage point, Deathwing would use his new position of power to tear down the diplomatic foundations of the Alliance. \nEarly on in their journey, Vereesa and Rhonin are attacked by a Dragonmaw orc patrol and are rescued by a band of &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammer clan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"gryphon%20rider\"&gt;gryphon rider&lt;/a&gt;s, led by Falstad Wildhammer. Vereesa initially thought the mage a burden, but quickly begins to change her mind when she sees his spellcasting skill in defending them from the dragons. After the ensuing battle, Rhonin and Vereesa are picked up by a few &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Duncan%20Senturus\"&gt;Duncan Senturus&lt;/a&gt; their leader, and are taken to the unnamed keep nearby where the Knights maintain watch. They are distrustful of Rhonin, as most are wary of wizards, but welcoming to Vereesa. During their stay, a mysterious explosion rocks the keep when Rhonin attempts to cast a spell, killing a few of the paladin guards, and resulting in the mysterious disappearance of Rhonin. Rhonin was saved by what we later find out was presumably Deathwing, or another dragon, since he claimed to have been picked up by a great set of claws or hands just at the moment a tower was to collapse on him. The paladins believe Rhonin caused the explosion, and they ride out to find him, only to find him right under their noses a short ways off. After questioning him, they decide that he did not cause the explosion, and escort him and Vereesa to Hasic.\nWhen they arrive they find that Hasic has been ravaged by dragon riders, and that the Wildhammer dwarves had driven them off. Vereesa, deciding that her oath to defend Rhonin on his mission extended beyond Hasic, decides to accompany him further. Partially out of necessity, and partially out of Falstad's and Duncan's enamorment with Vereesa's elven beauty, the paladin and the dwarf agree to escort Rhonin and Vereesa by flight to Khaz Modan. Along the way, they are attacked by a pair of Dragonmaw dragon-riders. Duncan, in an act of brazen heroism, leaps from a gryphon onto a dragon mid air and kills it, sacrificing himself at the hands of the dragon's rider. During this time, Rhonin and his escort Molok, are knocked out of the sky, and fall to the earth. The other dragon is killed when, out of nowhere, Deathwing arrives and slays it, seemingly in defense of Vereesa and Falstad. In reality, Deathwing used the opportunity in order to capture Rhonin in order to use him as a pawn to acquire the dragon eggs held by the Dragonmaw.\nDeathwing's plans and the quest to find and rescue Rhonin carried out by Vereesa and Falstad and Krasus's plea to the aspects for help would ultimately connect as the other aspects would attack Deathwing as the Alliance engaged the Dragonmaw in battle. With the aspects losing (even with Alexstrasza feed), Rhonin would turn the tide by destroying the demon soul using Deathwing's own black scale. With their powers freed Deathwing would be forced to retreat under their onslaught (which also caused his plans for the Alliance to crumble without him in place), and the Dragonmaw would be defeated. These events became later known as the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Battle of Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;."}

But while there was some damage, the city was rebuilt, after &lt;a href=\"Zul\"&gt;Zul&lt;/a&gt;'s departure.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nAfter the Horde saved Zul and &lt;a href=\"Talanji\"&gt;Talanji&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Stockades\"&gt;Stormwind Stockades&lt;/a&gt;, Zandalar let the Horde establish an embassy within the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Seal\"&gt;Great Seal&lt;/a&gt;. Some time later, &lt;a href=\"Zul\"&gt;Zul&lt;/a&gt; launched an insurrection against Rastakhan. With Zandalar opening its borders to non-trolls, other races such as &lt;a href=\"tol%27vir\"&gt;tol'vir&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"tuskarr\"&gt;tuskarr&lt;/a&gt; traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Port%20of%20Zandalar\"&gt;Port of Zandalar&lt;/a&gt; to do trade.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"Faction%20Assaults\"&gt;Faction Assaults&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Airship\"&gt;Alliance Airship&lt;/a&gt; shot cannonballs at the pyramid.\nThe upper part of Dazar'alor, the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Seal\"&gt;Great Seal&lt;/a&gt; would come under attack from &lt;a href=\"Mythrax\"&gt;Mythrax&lt;/a&gt;, seeking to unleash &lt;a href=\"G%27huun\"&gt;G'huun&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Dazar'alor.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Dazar%27alor%20%28battle%29\"&gt;Battle for Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt;, the city is put under siege by the forces of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; and her &lt;a href=\"Proudmoore%20flagship\"&gt;ship&lt;/a&gt; spearheaded the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20navy\"&gt;Alliance navy&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Dazar%27alor%20%28battle%29\"&gt;assault on Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt;. Once they were within range, the Alliance planned to detonate the hidden explosives they planted on the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Fleet\"&gt;Golden Fleet&lt;/a&gt;'s ships. The Golden Fleet, however, began harrying the Alliance navy with their &lt;a href=\"ballistae\"&gt;ballistae&lt;/a&gt;s and one of them collapsed the floor of &lt;a href=\"Gelbin%20Mekkatorque\"&gt;Gelbin Mekkatorque&lt;/a&gt;'s position just as he was about to detonate the explosives. Jaina began using her magic to shield her ship from missiles; just long enough for Mekkatorque to re-position his remote detonator machine and blow up the entire Golden Fleet defending the &lt;a href=\"Port%20of%20Zandalar\"&gt;Port of Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;. With the Golden Fleet in ruins, the Alliance navy invaded Dazar'alor with little resistance. \nDuring the battle, King Rastakhan urged &lt;a href=\"Bwonsamdi\"&gt;Bwonsamdi&lt;/a&gt; to aid his forces. Bwonsamdi created a blood moon and raised the dead to fend off the Alliance. However, despite the Horde and the Zandalari's combined defenses, the Alliance breached Dazar'alor and faced Rastakhan. Rastakhan refused the Alliance's offer of surrender and declared that the Zandalari would endure long after the Alliance had crumbled to dust. Determined to protect his empire and people, Rastakhan fought against the Alliance forces until his death.\nFollowing the death of &lt;a href=\"King%20Rastakhan\"&gt;King Rastakhan&lt;/a&gt;, the Alliance fleet withdrew from Daza'alor while the Zandalari, the other troll tribes, the Horde, and even the &lt;a href=\"vulpera\"&gt;vulpera&lt;/a&gt; mourned the King.\nThe Queen's ascension.\nDuring the sacred rite of kings and queens, many Dazar'alor citizens and Horde representatives gathered at the steps of &lt;a href=\"Zanchul\"&gt;Zanchul&lt;/a&gt; to celebrate the ascension of the new queen. However, before Talanji could begin the sacred ritual, dissidents led by &lt;a href=\"Samara\"&gt;the White Widow&lt;/a&gt; rose up in protest of a priest of Bwonsamdi becoming their queen. In response, Talanji and her allies dealt with the protests by making the dissenters see reason and allowed them to bend the knee, however not all chose to accept and instead fought to the death for their opinions.\nSpeculation.\nIt is likely that Dazar'alor translates to \"Dazar's temple\", with &lt;a href=\"Dazar\"&gt;Dazar&lt;/a&gt; referring to the first king of the Zandalari, and with the &lt;a href=\"Zandali\"&gt;Zandali&lt;/a&gt; word \"Alor\" possibly meaning temple or altar."}

Daze can be applied by mobs - \"Creature daze\" - or other players - \"Player daze\" - and each form functions differently.\nCreature daze.\nCreature daze is a 50% snare debuff, which often forces its target to dismount if mounted. All &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s have a chance of applying daze when they hit a player in melee range that is facing away from the mob. The daze mechanic is intended to prevent players from carelessly running past large groups of mobs.\nAll mob creatures have a chance to daze on each melee hit, ranging from 0% to a maximum 40%. Chance to daze is primarily a function of player level - mobs that are below a player's level have less chance to daze, while mobs above his level have a higher chance, with equal level mobs having a base 20% chance.\nThe base chance of 20% is decreased for players under level 30. For example, a level 10 player running from a level 10 mob will only have a 7% chance to be dazed.\nA player can only be dazed from behind and within melee range of the attacking mob. This is most common when running away from it, but it can also happen while standing still if the mob approaches from behind, or when backing up if the mob overshoots you while following you. Due to server latency, it can sometimes appear that a mob has dazed from a long distance, or in front of the player.\nIt has been confirmed that friendly mobs (for escort quests for example) can daze other mobs that are running away. It also seems that the dazed debuff can't be applied by a mob if you are \"&lt;a href=\"Immune\"&gt;Immune&lt;/a&gt;\" (such as with a Paladin &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Shield\"&gt;Divine Shield&lt;/a&gt; or Mage &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Block\"&gt;Ice Block&lt;/a&gt;), if you \"&lt;a href=\"Resist\"&gt;Resist&lt;/a&gt;\" the hit, or if all the damage from the hit is &lt;a href=\"Absorb\"&gt;Absorb&lt;/a&gt;ed (such as with ).\nWhile it slows movement speed, creature daze is not considered a movement impairing effect. Thus it cannot be removed by the usual means such as &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"shapeshift\"&gt;shapeshift&lt;/a&gt;ing, &lt;a href=\"Vanish\"&gt;Vanish&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Faction%20Insignia\"&gt;Faction Insignia&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Hand%20of%20Freedom\"&gt;Hand of Freedom&lt;/a&gt;. It is considered a physical debuff, however, and can be removed by &lt;a href=\"Hand%20of%20Protection\"&gt;Hand of Protection&lt;/a&gt; and the like. Note that it is also removed by immunity granting effects such as &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Shield\"&gt;Divine Shield&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Block\"&gt;Ice Block&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlayer daze.\nSome playable classes have abilities that apply a dazed debuff as well. However, player dazes do not dismount others the same way creature daze does, nor is the player daze effect immune to skills/items that remove movement impairements or harmful spell effects.\nDazing effects are notorious in PvP settings, especially in Warsong Gulch. Flag runners are usually hit with these abilities, leaving them vulnerable to attack from the opposing team. Player daze effects usually reduce movement speed by either 50% or 70%, depending on the ability."}

An elderly &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt;, he had practiced sorcery for a very long time, and he considered himself one of the foremost spellcasters of his order.\nBackground.\nWar of the Ancients.\nHe was one of the sorcerers dispatched to &lt;a href=\"Black%20Rook%20Hold\"&gt;Black Rook Hold&lt;/a&gt;, the fortress of Lord &lt;a href=\"Kur%27talos%20Ravencrest\"&gt;Kur'talos Ravencrest&lt;/a&gt;, in order to interrogate some prisoners: &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Broxigar\"&gt;Broxigar&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt;. Malfurion told a wild-sounding story about how the &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; were abusing the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;. Like many lower-caste night elves, Latosius was willing to believe ill of the Highborne. Like most of night elf society, though, he did not regard &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt; in the same negative light, despite the fact that she, too, belonged to the Highborne.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; and its Highborne allies managed to restrict access to the Well of Eternity, the disruption brought an abrupt end to Latosius' magical interrogation of Malfurion. The Moon Guard tried repeatedly to restart the interrogation, but their spells failed without direct access to the Well's energies. Latosius was frightened and furious.\nMessengers began arriving at Black Rook Hold with even worse news: demonic invaders were attacking &lt;a href=\"Zin-Azshari\"&gt;Zin-Azshari&lt;/a&gt;. Kur'talos and his soldiers were convinced that the queen had become a prisoner in her own palace. They therefore set out for Zin-Azshari to free her and defeat the demons. Although the Moon Guard's magical abilities were greatly diminished, Latosius and his comrades accompanied the army.\nThe war escalated, and as the highest-ranking sorcerer, Latosius assumed leadership of the Moon Guard and directed their efforts on the battlefield. However, several other defenders later remarked that Latosius seemed to focus too much on minor details rather than the bigger picture. Eventually the elderly sorcerer was caught off guard and killed by an &lt;a href=\"Eredar%20warlock\"&gt;Eredar warlock&lt;/a&gt;'s spell.\nRhonin avenged Latosius' death by killing the &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; responsible. By the time Rhonin had done so, &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; was already crossing the battlefield toward the remaining Moon Guard. Illidan, though not a member of their order, clearly had superior magical talent, and he proved much better than Latosius at coordinating the Moon Guard's efforts.\nLegion.\nA &lt;a href=\"dreadlord\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Dantalionax\"&gt;Dantalionax&lt;/a&gt; impersonates Latosius atop Black Rook Hold and manipulates Lord Ravencrest to work for the Legion. When &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s battle the pair, Dantalionax sheds his disguise and Ravencrest resists his control to fight back."}

Known for their violent and bloodthirsty nature, these orcs take great pride in their clan identity and have therefore refused to join the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt;. With the Iron Horde trying to destroy the Laughing Skull clan, they have allied themselves with the &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20Orcs\"&gt;Frostwolf clan&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; to fight their common enemy.\nIn the past, the two clans battled against each other. Following events in Gorgrond, however, they appear to be rather close allies.\nEarly in their settlement of Draenor, the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Rangari\"&gt;Rangari&lt;/a&gt; learned from the Laughing Skulls that &lt;a href=\"podling\"&gt;podling&lt;/a&gt;s hate fire. The &lt;a href=\"Rangari%20Refuge\"&gt;Rangari Refuge&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Tanaan%20Jungle\"&gt;Tanaan Jungle&lt;/a&gt; houses several Laughing Skull refugees and guards, indicating the two factions may still be close.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Marrow\"&gt;Marrow&lt;/a&gt; in Beastwatch, the Laughing Skull orcs use goren teeth as tools and weaponry.\nThe Laughing Skull chortle whenever they collect &lt;a href=\"Humerus%20Bone\"&gt;Humerus Bone&lt;/a&gt;s from a fallen enemy.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nAs the various clans of Draenor began uniting to begin their &lt;a href=\"War%20in%20Draenor\"&gt;invasion of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, the Laughing Skulls rejected their offer, wishing to keep their freedom to kill whomever they wished. Following the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Thunder%20Pass\"&gt;Battle of Thunder Pass&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20Orcs\"&gt;Frostwolf clan&lt;/a&gt; chieftain , his mate , and the Horde commander make contact with the Laughing Skull shaman &lt;a href=\"Kaz%20the%20Shrieker\"&gt;Kaz the Shrieker&lt;/a&gt;. After helping them with a &lt;a href=\"goren\"&gt;goren&lt;/a&gt; invasion of their village, Kaz and her compatriots agree to an alliance with the Frostwolves, and by extension &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, against their common enemies. The Laughing Skull's involvement in the &lt;a href=\"Gorgrond%20storyline\"&gt;Gorgrond storyline&lt;/a&gt; splits when the player chooses either a lumber mill or an arena.\nDuring the arena campaign, the Laughing Skull has a smaller role. &lt;a href=\"Bony%20Xuk\"&gt;Bony Xuk&lt;/a&gt; accompanies the player through the wastes giving quests until the &lt;a href=\"Ghost\"&gt;spirits&lt;/a&gt; apparently play a trick on the shaman and get him killed by &lt;a href=\"Gro%20the%20Uncreator\"&gt;Gro the Uncreator&lt;/a&gt;. His &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20of%20Bony%20Xuk\"&gt;spirit&lt;/a&gt; can be recruited as a follower.\nDuring the lumber mill campaign, the clan has a comparatively larger role, where Kaz and her son &lt;a href=\"Cutter\"&gt;Cutter&lt;/a&gt; join Draka in battling the &lt;a href=\"botani\"&gt;botani&lt;/a&gt; and securing greater resources for the garrison. During the storyline, Kaz and Draka butt heads over strategy but eventually begin to respect each other. They discover an artifact that can control &lt;a href=\"genesaur\"&gt;genesaurs&lt;/a&gt; and retrieve it from the hands of the botani. After an epic battle against &lt;a href=\"Iyu\"&gt;Iyu&lt;/a&gt;, Kaz now calls Draka \"sister\" and pledges her clan and herself (as a follower) fully the Horde's cause. The Laughing Skull later aids in the assault on the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Approach\"&gt;Iron Approach&lt;/a&gt;.\nGreater Laughing Skull Orc reputation can be unlocked by building a &lt;a href=\"Trading%20Post%20%28Garrison%29\"&gt;Trading Post&lt;/a&gt; at your &lt;a href=\"garrison\"&gt;garrison&lt;/a&gt;.\nTanaan Jungle.\nA group of Laughing Skull refugees can be found at &lt;a href=\"Rangari%20Refuge\"&gt;Rangari Refuge&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Tanaan%20Jungle\"&gt;Tanaan Jungle&lt;/a&gt;, where they are under supervision by &lt;a href=\"Frogan\"&gt;Frogan&lt;/a&gt;. Some scouts have been imprisoned in the but were rescued when the adventurers raided the place.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nIn time, the Laughing Skull clan joined with the other &lt;a href=\"Mag%27har%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Mag'har orc clans&lt;/a&gt; under the command of &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hellscream%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Warchief Grommash Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;. As the Mag'har and &lt;a href=\"Lightbound\"&gt;Lightbound&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"war%20between%20the%20Lightbound%20and%20the%20Mag%27har\"&gt;clashed&lt;/a&gt;, events on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; would see to a &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;new war&lt;/a&gt; between the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. In the midst of this, &lt;a href=\"Eitrigg\"&gt;Eitrigg&lt;/a&gt; sought to travel to the &lt;a href=\"Draenor%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;alternate Draenor&lt;/a&gt; and call upon the debt the Mag'har owed to the Horde for liberating them from &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;'s meddling and the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s corruption.\nAs the entire Lightbound army was marching towards the Mag'har, Grommash ordered for the Mag'har to follow Geya'rah and fallback to Azeroth. Thus, when Warchief Hellscream and &lt;a href=\"Lantresor%20of%20the%20Blade%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Lantresor of the Blade&lt;/a&gt; charged at the Lightbound, Eitrigg activated the shard of the &lt;a href=\"Vision%20of%20Time\"&gt;Vision of Time&lt;/a&gt; in his possession in order to return to Azeroth with his new allies. After their arrival on Azeroth, Overlord Geya'rah took her place as leader of the Mag'har and pledged the loyalty of her people to &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Warchief Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. \nAfter joining the Horde, members of the clan like &lt;a href=\"Kaz%20the%20Shrieker\"&gt;Kaz the Shrieker&lt;/a&gt; can be seen fighting for the Horde against the Alliance on &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;."}

{"id": "20299", "revid": "39299307", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=20299", "title": "Laughing Skull clan", "text": "The Laughing Skull clan (or simply the Skulls) was an &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; clan that dwelled in southeastern &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Gorgrond&lt;/a&gt; and on the island of &lt;a href=\"Farahlon\"&gt;Farahlon&lt;/a&gt;. Maniacal and bloodthirsty, the Laughing Skulls were considered to be mad by other clans, and they later had a reputation for treachery and deceit.\nHistory.\nRoughly 800 years before the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, the orcs began to migrate out of &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Gorgrond&lt;/a&gt;, but many orcs chose to remain in the region and gradually formed several distinct clans, one of which was the Laughing Skull clan.\nEarly on, the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Rangari\"&gt;Rangari&lt;/a&gt; learned from the Laughing Skulls that &lt;a href=\"podling\"&gt;podling&lt;/a&gt;s hate fire.\nAt some point, the warriors of the &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20clan\"&gt;Frostwolf clan&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 including Chieftain &lt;a href=\"Garad\"&gt;Garad&lt;/a&gt; and his son &lt;a href=\"Ga%27nar\"&gt;Ga'nar&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 fought against the Laughing Skulls. Around the time that &lt;a href=\"Durotan\"&gt;Durotan&lt;/a&gt; led the Frostwolf clan, the Laughing Skulls were led by the &lt;a href=\"ogre%20mage\"&gt;ogre mage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mogor\"&gt;Mogor&lt;/a&gt;.\nRise of the Horde.\nThe Laughing Skull clan was among the many orc clans who rallied to the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and began attacking the draenei in the belief that it was their ancestors' will. To more effectively combat the draenei, the Laughing Skull joined with the &lt;a href=\"Bleeding%20Hollow%20clan\"&gt;Bleeding Hollow clan&lt;/a&gt;, more than doubling their numbers.\nThe clan was present at the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Throne of Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; when &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; offered the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20of%20Mannoroth\"&gt;Blood of Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt; had conquered much of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, the threat of starvation caused many orcs to grow more agitated and turn on each other, clashing in short-lived battles that left hundreds dead. Several clans, among them the Laughing Skulls, completely lost themselves to the depths of madness. To protect the rest of the Horde, &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; banished the violent clans from &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Citadel\"&gt;Hellfire Citadel&lt;/a&gt; to the remote areas of &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; in order to preserve some of the Horde's dwindling strength.\nWhen the Horde prepared to invade &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, Blackhand ordered the troublesome clans to remain on Draenor, since he believed that they would become liabilities if allowed to participate in the invasion. He knew that the clans would grow restless on Draenor, but a few months of waiting while hearing only stories of the lush new world and seeing only scraps of the war spoils would force them to be on their best behavior. If the clans were still uncontrollable, they could stay on Draenor and rot, for all Blackhand cared. After the fall of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;, the new warchief &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; sent messengers to Draenor to call up the remaining clans in order to replenish the Horde's numbers, but the messengers later returned to inform the warchief that the clans on Draenor had descended deeper into bloodlust and had begun fighting with one another, allowing only a few orcs and &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s to bolster the Horde.\nBeyond the Dark Portal.\nAround the time that &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; was planning to rally the orc clans on Draenor into a &lt;a href=\"Horde%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;reformed Horde&lt;/a&gt;, the Laughing Skulls battled against the &lt;a href=\"Thunderlord%20clan\"&gt;Thunderlord clan&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, the Laughing Skulls joined the rest of the Horde of Draenor, but the Laughing Skull &lt;a href=\"Obris\"&gt;Obris&lt;/a&gt;, who served as one of Ner'zhul's officers, later told &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; that his clan had been forced back into the fold and that Ner'zhul had promised them a new start.\nAlmost immediately after Ner'zhul reopened the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grommash Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; led the &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20clan\"&gt;Warsong&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Hand%20clan\"&gt;Shattered Hand&lt;/a&gt;, Thunderlord and Laughing Skull clans in an invasion of the &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt; while &lt;a href=\"Teron%20Gorefiend\"&gt;Teron Gorefiend&lt;/a&gt; led a group of orcs and &lt;a href=\"Death%20knight%20%28Old%20Horde%29\"&gt;death knights&lt;/a&gt; in search of the artifacts that would allow Ner'zhul to open portals to new worlds. In &lt;a href=\"Farahlon\"&gt;Farahlon&lt;/a&gt;, the clan entered a truce with a part of the invading &lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Lothar\"&gt;Alliance Expedition&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen Ner'zhul opened countless portals that began tearing Draenor apart, he intended to leave the Horde to its fate as he was only concerned about his own survival. When Obris protested, he was mowed down by Ner'zhul's magic and left for dead. Later, the dying Obris gave the &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Medivh\"&gt;Book of Medivh&lt;/a&gt; to Khadgar, stating that it would please him to know that his last act was to defy Ner'zhul.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nAt some point after Draenor was transformed into &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, a large number of Laughing Skulls transformed into &lt;a href=\"fel%20orc\"&gt;fel orc&lt;/a&gt;s and eventually came into the service of the &lt;a href=\"Fel%20Horde\"&gt;Fel Horde&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt;. Laughing Skull forces can be found throughout the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Furnace\"&gt;Blood Furnace&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Citadel\"&gt;Hellfire Citadel&lt;/a&gt;. Two &lt;a href=\"Laughing%20Skull%20Ambusher\"&gt;Laughing Skull Ambusher&lt;/a&gt;s and the assassin &lt;a href=\"Krun%20Spinebreaker\"&gt;Krun Spinebreaker&lt;/a&gt; were responsible for the murder of &lt;a href=\"Vindicator%20Sedai\"&gt;Vindicator Sedai&lt;/a&gt;.\nA ruined settlement known as the &lt;a href=\"Laughing%20Skull%20Ruins\"&gt;Laughing Skull Ruins&lt;/a&gt;, nestled near the mountains of northern &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt;, is currently inhabited by &lt;a href=\"Warmaul\"&gt;Warmaul&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s and was once inhabited by &lt;a href=\"Mag%27har%20orc\"&gt;Mag'har orc&lt;/a&gt;s. Mogor, the \"Hero of the Warmaul\", can be found overseeing the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Blood\"&gt;Ring of Blood&lt;/a&gt; in the northernmost part of the ruins.\nCulture.\nManiacal, volatile, and bloodthirsty, the orcs of the Laughing Skull clan were capable of extreme brutality. Other clans believed them to be mad and considered them to be dangerous and unpredictable, much like &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Gorgrond&lt;/a&gt; itself, and the clan had a reputation for being treacherous. Rather than flinching in the face of death, the Laughing Skulls prided themselves on laughing at it instead, and they chortled whenever they collected a &lt;a href=\"Humerus%20Bone\"&gt;humerus bone&lt;/a&gt; from a fallen enemy.\nThis violent mindset stemmed from their environment. The Laughing Skulls struggled to maintain their ancestral territory, but the brutality of being constantly assaulted by Gorgrond's warring &lt;a href=\"Breakers\"&gt;Breakers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Primals\"&gt;Primals&lt;/a&gt; forged them into bloodthirsty savages and forced them to \"match savagery with savagery\". The Laughing Skulls always burned their dead in order to prevent the bodies from being raised and &lt;a href=\"infested\"&gt;infested&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"botani\"&gt;botani&lt;/a&gt;.\nMembers of the clan wore distinctive skull-like masks. These were more than fancy facewear; with a mask and \"some proper incentive\", anyone could be made into a Laughing Skull.\nThe Laughing Skulls had long learned a few secrets of the &lt;a href=\"botani\"&gt;botani&lt;/a&gt; that they could use to grow their own plants. There was no such thing as a hungry Laughing Skull for this reason. With a dash of a few secret ingredients, one could feed an army with the food grown from the pollen carried by the botani's &lt;a href=\"ravager%20wasp\"&gt;wasps&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"ravager\"&gt;ravager&lt;/a&gt;s, if one knew \"the secret ways\". Laughing Skull cuisine was generally notable for its complex spices and unusual ingredients sourced from the island of &lt;a href=\"Farahlon\"&gt;Farahlon&lt;/a&gt;, often &lt;a href=\"Cannibalism\"&gt;including sentient creatures&lt;/a&gt; such as botani themselves. One such recipe is &lt;a href=\"Curried%20Botani%20and%20Lobstrok%20Stew\"&gt;Curried Botani and Lobstrok Stew&lt;/a&gt;, which is a salt water stew cooked with pieces of &lt;a href=\"lobstrok\"&gt;lobstrok&lt;/a&gt;, botani brain, curry spices and &lt;a href=\"Fenugreek\"&gt;Fenugreek&lt;/a&gt;.\nBy the time of the &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Invasion of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, the Laughing Skulls felt a kinship to thievery and assassination, and their warriors were distrusted by many of their fellow orcs. Although their loyalty was considered questionable, the skill and audacity of the clan's minions was unequaled.\nIn Warcraft II.\nManual.\nLeader: &lt;a href=\"Mogor\"&gt;Mogor&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Ogre\"&gt;Ogre&lt;/a&gt;\nColor: Yellow\nThe morose Laughing Skull is perhaps the most treacherous of all the &lt;a href=\"Clan%23Orcish%20clan%20system\"&gt;clans&lt;/a&gt;. Feeling a kinship to thievery and assassination, the warriors of the Laughing Skull are distrusted by many of their fellow &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;s. Although the loyalty of those in the Laughing Skull are questionable, the skill and audacity of their minions are unequaled.\nCampaign.\n\"Most of the following events were &lt;a href=\"retcon\"&gt;retcon&lt;/a&gt;ned or ignored by the novel \"&lt;a href=\"Beyond%20the%20Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Beyond the Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;\".\"\nWhen the elder &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; first began developing his plan to open more &lt;a href=\"dimensional%20gateway\"&gt;dimensional gateway&lt;/a&gt;s, he required the knowledge of a specific order of &lt;a href=\"Death%20knight%20%28Old%20Horde%29\"&gt;death knights&lt;/a&gt; who knew how to rebuild the original Dark Portal. &lt;a href=\"Mogor\"&gt;Mogor&lt;/a&gt;, the renegade &lt;a href=\"ogre%20mage\"&gt;ogre mage&lt;/a&gt; of the Laughing Skull clan, had taken control of this group of death knights and was using them for some dark purpose of his own. Ner'zhul ordered a small force of orcs, &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s, and a death knight from the &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20clan\"&gt;Shadowmoon clan&lt;/a&gt; to attack the Laughing Skulls and subjugate Mogor's death knights. Ner'zhul's forces also rescued &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grommash Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; and some of his &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20clan\"&gt;Warsong&lt;/a&gt; soldiers, who had been held prisoner by the Laughing Skulls, and with their help the attack was carried out successfully and Ner'zhul gained the knowledge required to open to reopen the Dark Portal.\nAfter the reopening of the Dark Portal, a group of Laughing Skull, Warsong, and Shadowmoon warriors established a base near &lt;a href=\"Nethergarde%20Keep\"&gt;Nethergarde Keep&lt;/a&gt;, where they subsequently fought against and were defeated by &lt;a href=\"Danath%20Trollbane\"&gt;Danath Trollbane&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; forces. Shortly after the &lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Lothar\"&gt;Sons of Lothar&lt;/a&gt; invaded Draenor, they attacked the &lt;a href=\"shipyard\"&gt;shipyard&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Zeth%27kur\"&gt;Zeth'kur&lt;/a&gt;. One of the nearby islands contained a Laughing Skull encampment which was destroyed by the Alliance. Later, the Alliance destroyed another Laughing Skull encampment located on one of the islands off the &lt;a href=\"Skeletal%20Coast\"&gt;Skeletal Coast&lt;/a&gt;.\nBefore the Alliance managed to attack &lt;a href=\"Fortress%20Shadowmoon\"&gt;Fortress Shadowmoon&lt;/a&gt;, the Laughing Skull stole the &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Medivh\"&gt;Book of Medivh&lt;/a&gt; from Ner'zhul's stronghold. Later, the Skulls contacted the Sons of Lothar and informed them that while none could stand against the combined might of the Horde, the Laughing Skull clan sought advantage from the turmoil of the war. The orcs asked the Alliance to lend their strongest warriors to help the Laughing Skulls gain dominance over Draenor's northern clans by securing the passes across the &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Blade's Edge Mountains&lt;/a&gt; and destroying the stronghold of the &lt;a href=\"Thunderlord%20clan\"&gt;Thunderlord clan&lt;/a&gt; that dwelled there. The Skulls would supply the humans with warriors and supplies culled from their villages. In exchange for the Alliance's assistance, the Laughing Skulls would give them the Book of Medivh. The Sons of Lothar complied and reinforced the orcs as they attacked and destroyed the strongholds of the &lt;a href=\"Bonechewer%20clan\"&gt;Bonechewers&lt;/a&gt; and Thunderlords, allowing the Skulls to gain control of the region."}

It can also be found in the depths of &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;, inside &lt;a href=\"Ragefire%20Chasm\"&gt;Ragefire Chasm&lt;/a&gt;, and within the &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Dragonshrine\"&gt;Obsidian Dragonshrine&lt;/a&gt;. \nTraversing lava.\nGenerally there is a route over or around lava pools, however traveling through it is often the fastest way. Common shortcuts include &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt;' room in Molten Core and lava-swimming in Blackrock Depths from &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Incendius\"&gt;Lord Incendius&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"The%20Black%20Forge\"&gt;The Black Forge&lt;/a&gt; which allows players to skip a large part of the instance for a fast run or to complete the &lt;a href=\"Attunement_to_the_Core\"&gt;Molten Core attunement quest&lt;/a&gt;.\nDamage.\nWhen touching lava, your character will take &lt;a href=\"fire%20damage\"&gt;fire damage&lt;/a&gt; every 2 seconds until dead or clear from the lava. It is possible to avoid one damage tic with a well-timed jump into the air, even if it means landing back in the lava. &lt;a href=\"Fire%20resistance\"&gt;Fire resistance&lt;/a&gt; reduces the damage taken.\nSwimming in lava.\nLava behaves like water in that a character can swim through deep pools or walk in the shallows. Underneath the surface, the breath meter will be displayed and drowning is possible if the character is not killed by the ticking fire damage first. There is almost never any need to actually travel below the surface of the lava, however, so this is a scenario easily avoided. \nNo abilities or circumstances that would allow a character to walk on water will work with lava. This means that even dead characters will have to swim through it. However, abilities that increase &lt;a href=\"swim\"&gt;swim&lt;/a&gt; speed and allow &lt;a href=\"breath\"&gt;underwater breathing&lt;/a&gt; will work while in lava.\nTravel with care.\nIn some areas, lava is used as a border to enclose a region and prevent a player from leaving the map. Players should take caution when swimming through such areas, as the map beyond the lava may be incomplete, possibly leading to areas with no exit to safe land, or even falling through the world.\nFishing.\nLava can be &lt;a href=\"fishing\"&gt;fished&lt;/a&gt; in, just like water. The quality of catches in lava is generally quite poor, if there is any fishing allowed in the region at all. Fishing in lava will usually result in quality catches, (a different loot table than poor quality loot obtained due to low fishing skill), with occasional fire-based elemental trade goods, or . Actual fish are rarely or never caught when fishing in lava, (one exception being , which used to be catchable in the lava of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Forge\"&gt;Great Forge&lt;/a&gt;)."}

Molten lava oozes from its great fists. Lava elementals are destructive creatures that consume everything they touch with their powerful heat. Some theorize that lava elementals may be related to fire elementals, but the two do not seem to get along. Lava elementals fight for their own territory and refuse to share with their fiery brethren. A lava elemental appears as a floating, vaguely humanoid shape composed of large boulders. These boulders are in truth blobs of molten lava. While the lava elemental trails a few inches of the ground, it cannot rise any higher. A lava elemental stands nearly 15 feet and weighs about 2,000 pounds. Lava elementals enjoy targeting enemies with heavy armor, thus making good use of their impacting blow ability. They use their powerful attacks it their fullest degree and divide their attacks among their enemies, in order to affect as many as possible with their lava sear ability. Lava Elementals speak &lt;a href=\"Terran\"&gt;Terran&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ignan\"&gt;Ignan&lt;/a&gt; dialects of &lt;a href=\"Kalimag\"&gt;Kalimag&lt;/a&gt;."}

These can consist of four different type of &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s, each with a different ability.\nEach pack always contains one Flameguard and one Firewalker, and either a Lava Reaver or two Lava Elementals.\nStrategy.\nLava packs represent probably the hardest trash mobs in the Molten Core. They can easily &lt;a href=\"wipe\"&gt;wipe&lt;/a&gt; a raid if not controlled properly. It is important to have some distance between the &lt;a href=\"tank\"&gt;tank&lt;/a&gt;s and warlocks to the rest of the raid (at least 20 yards). Let the tanks get their targets, and face them away from raid, and only then start DPSing.\nOf the four types of mobs, only the Lava Reavers and Lava Elementals can be &lt;a href=\"banish\"&gt;banish&lt;/a&gt;ed. It is very important that the Firewalker and Flameguard AOEs not be allowed to overlap. The main tank is usually assigned to hold the Flameguard facing away and some distance beyond the party, while the off-tank holds the Firewalker and the lava elementals are banished by a warlock. The Firewalker is killed first, followed by the Flameguard, and finally each of the banished Lava Reavers or Lava Elementals. It is helpful to delay the banishing until 5\u20138 seconds after engaging the pack, so the Reaver/Elemental tanks have time to get aggro on their adds. If you fail to do this, the adds will become unbanished and rampage through the raid until the tank grabs them again.\nLava packs are on a 2 hour respawn timer."}

It is illustrated by &lt;a href=\"Lindsey%20Burcar\"&gt;Lindsey Burcar&lt;/a&gt;. The story tells of &lt;a href=\"Hava\"&gt;Hava&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Siy\"&gt;Siy&lt;/a&gt;, two young &lt;a href=\"vulpera\"&gt;vulpera&lt;/a&gt; who were tasked by their caravan to follow the &lt;a href=\"%3AWailing%20Bone\"&gt;:Wailing Bone&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Rivu\"&gt;Elder Rivu&lt;/a&gt;'s resting place.\nSummary.\nThe story open \"in media res\" from the perspective of &lt;a href=\"Hava\"&gt;Hava&lt;/a&gt;, a young vulpera just a year shy of adulthood, unable to sleep. He slips past his parents and five siblings leaving his caravan and going into the caravan of &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Kulen\"&gt;Elder Kulen&lt;/a&gt; to look at the &lt;a href=\"%3AWailing%20Bone\"&gt;:Wailing Bone&lt;/a&gt;, while hearing an incessant dripping sound. On the bone is inscribed a poem in a script few vulpera can read but all could recite:\nUpon grabbing the bone, he heard a voice say, \"NO REST. NEVER REST.\" He then proceeded to take the bone without touching it, wrapping it in cloth.\nThe story then jumps to the events leading up to the opening of the story. &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Rivu\"&gt;Elder Rivu&lt;/a&gt; explains that the vulpera were born of the magic of the &lt;a href=\"Vol%27dun\"&gt;desert&lt;/a&gt;, and how the desert calls to the vulpera upon death to a specific location by following the Wailing Bone in order to help their spirits pass the &lt;a href=\"veil\"&gt;veil&lt;/a&gt;. The bone indicates the location has been reached because the vulpera tasked with holding the bone can hear its cries, whether it takes just a day or weeks.\nThe story returns to where it previously left off, Hava having stolen the bone and brought both halves to his cousin &lt;a href=\"Siy\"&gt;Siy&lt;/a&gt;. Siy makes the mistake of grabbing the bone, where he becomes paralyzed until Hava knocks him down. Siy begins to vomit more water than he could have possibly drunk, as well as small fishes, pebbles, silt, and a long continuous thread of river grass enough to circle Hava many times over that Hava was forced to pull from Siy's mouth. They remark the incessant dripping is driving them insane, and how they're unable to sleep due to nightmares of drowning and the rotten corpse of Elder Rivu chasing them down.\nThe story jumps to the past again. Elder Rivu had just died and had no family, so Siy and Hava were tasked with leading the caravan with the bone. Due to frustration and exhaustion after many weeks of wandering, and Elder Rivu's corpse rotting, Siy suggested to instead toss the corpse into a river that had sprung up due to a flash flood. Hava agreed to this plan. Upon Elder Rivu's body touching the water, the bone screamed in a piercing tone, and cracked in half. When they returned to their caravan, their family sighed in relief due to not having to wander any more.\nThe story jumps back to the present. Hava is pretending the bone is whispering to him to lead Siy to the river. Hava strikes Siy over the head, and then proceeds to choke him with the bone to hold him under the water, drowning him. He asks the bone if its satisfied now, but the bone laughs. Suddenly, the bloated corpse of Elder Rivu grabs his ankles and pulls him underwater as the bone burned in his paws. The bone explains that he had guided his caravan for generations, thousands of vulpera following the cries of the bone, but Hava had abandoned his elder and left him in a river where his body will never know rest. Siy's body then grabs Hava as well, dragging Hava into the depths with Rivu. \nA year later, Hava's bones washed upon the shores of the canyon, along with Siy's. Elder Kulen took Hava's bone and inscribed the poem upon it, becoming the caravan's new Wailing Bone. The story ends with the lesson, \"shirking your duty always has consequences\" and \"a caravan always needs a Wailing Bone\"."}

He has a rabbit named &lt;a href=\"Pooka%20%28rabbit%29\"&gt;Pooka&lt;/a&gt; and was worried that he had to compete with &lt;a href=\"Razzle%20Sprysprocket\"&gt;Razzle Sprysprocket&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ozzie%20Togglevolt\"&gt;Ozzie Togglevolt&lt;/a&gt;. While his regular work is making dynamite with very dependable fuses, which his clients appreciate, he considers it to be boring and generally unfulfilling. His house is full of seemingly useless inventions and he has a knack for saying the wrong things at the wrong time. When he went to &lt;a href=\"Thunderbrew%20Distillery\"&gt;Thunderbrew Distillery&lt;/a&gt;, Ozzie and Razzle scoffed at him, but &lt;a href=\"Innkeeper%20Belm\"&gt;Innkeeper Belm&lt;/a&gt; was kind to him. While there, he proclaimed to the patrons that he was sorry about previous problems with his inventions and introduced them to a game he thought up, called Live Action Re-enactment Pagenants, in which they would put on costumes of orcs and tauren. However, the dwarves only laughed him out of the inn.\nLater on, a &lt;a href=\"Frostmane%20tribe\"&gt;Frostmane&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ice%20troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; was said to be headed for Kharanos. Dwarves immediately ventured to hunt him down. Lazlo refused to go with them telling them that he is not a fighter. Back in the distillery, Belm convinced him that he could help out in a non-combat role, which would be just as important to help the town. After this, he bumped into Razzle and Ozzie just in time when the troll appeared, who scoffed at the three as a potential threat when he recognized they weren't spell-casters. When the troll was about to attack them, &lt;a href=\"Kogan%20Forgestone\"&gt;Kogan Forgestone&lt;/a&gt; appeared only to be defeated. Razzle and Ozzie tried to throw grenades at the troll but then realized they'd grabbed time bombs. Lazlo started to run when the troll overwhelmed Razzle and Ozzie. Lazlo got an idea how to defeat the troll: he grabbed his LARP troll head and went to the distillery where the troll was about to kill Belm and taunted the troll into chasing him. Lazlo threw a chemical grenade which is supposed to make the target instantly fall asleep, however, he hadn't tested it and only then found out it didn't work.\nIn desperation, he led the now extremely enraged troll back to his house and shot him with a teleporter ray meant to put groceries in one's pantry, but it instead teleported the troll extremely high up in the air above Lazlo's house. After the troll crashed through Lazlo's stone roof back into the house and surrendered, Lazlo was honored as a hero of Kharanos.\nLazlo got his own song written by dwarves and gnomes, similar to the song of &lt;a href=\"Corrigan\"&gt;Corrigan&lt;/a&gt;. The dwarves assured him that they will help repair his home. Even Ozzie and Razzle apologized to Lazlo and they offered him their shop as a temporary place of business. He admits to the other engineers that his teleporter strategy was actually a screwup, but it is apparent that Ozzie and Razzle decide to keep that detail to themselves."}

The &lt;a href=\"anima\"&gt;anima&lt;/a&gt; drought has caused the Heart to wither and it needs more anima than Ardenweald has if it's going to keep The Jailer bound within the Maw. The Queen decreed that the Heart of the Forest's magic is cultivated, and that can't be done without mortal souls destined for Ardenweald that were trapped in the Maw, Maw Walker is sent to bring the unjustly trapped from the countless souls in the Maw."}

These must be picked up and taken away from XT-002 Deconstructor otherwise they will heal and buff him.\nDuring these phases the XT-002 Deconstructor's Heart becomes targetable by all dps, those not assigned to pulling adds away from the XT-002 Deconstructor must burn this down to 0hp from 1.5million in non-heroic and 7 million in heroic.\nWhen the Heart is destroyed the XT-002 Deconstructor will be healed back up to maximun health and he will lose all of his old abilitis and gain new ones.\n Heartbreak: Activated when killing the Exposed Heart, engaging hard mode and healing the boss to full: The heart of the XT-002 Deconstructor has been severed, removing the combat limitations of the XT-002 Deconstructor. Damage increased by 15%. Health increased by 50%. (Heroic: 15% damage and 60% health) XT-002 will no longer summon adds or have exposed heart phases, but any adds summoned during the breaking of the heart will need to be dealt with. \n Void Zone: Gravity Bombs summon a Void Zone that deals Shadow damage to enemies that stand within it. 5000 damage on Normal, 7500 on Heroic. \n Life Spark: Light Bombs summon a Life Spark that deals damage to nearby enemies. The Sparks have Static Charged, which deals Nature damage to all enemies within 500 yards every 3 sec. 800 damage on Normal, 2000 on Heroic. \nIt is useful to assign a specific side for each of the two abilities to be dumped on. This easily and clearly allows players to avoid the void zones and Light Bombs with minimal hassle.\nThis phase is mainly a dps burn and very healing intensive - although with ICC standard gear players will find it much easier to complete this Hard mode challenge - all in all this is a basic test for experienced raiders that involves minimum raid movement and mainly requires high dpsers."}

The road to the town is called &lt;a href=\"Hearthglen%20Pass\"&gt;Hearthglen Pass&lt;/a&gt;, and a forest near Hearthglen is called the &lt;a href=\"Hearthglen%20Woods\"&gt;Hearthglen Woods&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe town stands out from the rest of the region for its peaceful appearance, although it has not been spared from the attacks of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. The town and formerly the region, was controlled from &lt;a href=\"Mardenholde%20Keep\"&gt;Mardenholde Keep&lt;/a&gt;. It fell under the control of the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; until &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt; returned and resumed control. It now serves as a training ground and headquarters for the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, the keep never fell to the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Orcish Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Some time before the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, traveling dignitaries and representatives from the various nations of the Alliance passed through Hearthglen on their secret diplomatic errands.\nBefore the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, Hearthglen was ruled by the &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt;, Lord of Mardenholde. He was, however, &lt;a href=\"Excommunication\"&gt;excommunicated&lt;/a&gt; and exiled for treason, for giving aid to an orc found in his lands, &lt;a href=\"Eitrigg\"&gt;Eitrigg&lt;/a&gt;. The paladin &lt;a href=\"Barthilas\"&gt;Barthilas&lt;/a&gt; was temporarily given command of the province, but he was wounded during an orc assault on &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;, and was not able to make his command effective. Some years later, Tirion's son &lt;a href=\"Taelan%20Fordring\"&gt;Taelan Fordring&lt;/a&gt; was given control of the keep.\nThird War.\nIn the beginnings of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, Hearthglen was a target of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;Plague of Undeath&lt;/a&gt; arrived there in a grain shipment from &lt;a href=\"Andorhal\"&gt;Andorhal&lt;/a&gt;. The city was about to be attacked by an army of undead, and the defenders had just baked and eaten the grain before the attack started. Meanwhile, Prince &lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; had tracked the shipment of grain to Hearthglen. He, along with soldiers of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;'s army, were able to slay those infected by the shipment before they could spread the disease to the entire town. Shortly thereafter the large &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; army laid siege to the town. Reinforced by Prince Arthas and his armies, the town held off the undead long enough for the arrival of &lt;a href=\"Uther\"&gt;Uther&lt;/a&gt; and his knights. Ironically, it was the efforts of the future &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; that saved Hearthglen and ultimately allowed it to survive uncontrolled by the Undead Scourge.\nAshbringer.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Scourging%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Scourging of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, Hearthglen was used as a rallying point by the remains of the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Order of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Alexandros%20Mograine\"&gt;High Alexandros Mograine&lt;/a&gt;, due to &lt;a href=\"Taelan%20Fordring\"&gt;Taelan Fordring&lt;/a&gt;'s offer for refuge. The town was later appropriated by the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt;, who turned it into a major base of operations. During a &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; attack, &lt;a href=\"High%20General%20Abbendis\"&gt;High General Abbendis&lt;/a&gt; died here.\nLight's Wrath.\nAt some point, the Scarlet Crusade set out to create a staff of unparalleled holy might, a weapon that would rival even the legendary &lt;a href=\"Ashbringer\"&gt;Ashbringer&lt;/a&gt; in righteous fury. Ten of the Scarlet Crusade's learned priests gathered in Hearthglen to create &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Wrath\"&gt;Light's Wrath&lt;/a&gt;. For weeks, they practiced a ritual that would purify the dark jewel they found in the war-torn &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands\"&gt;Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt; and bind it to the staff. However, &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt; learned of their plans and feared that such a weapon could unmask his deception and shatter his hold over the Crusade. The &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt; disrupted the cleansing ritual, and the crusaders lost control of their delicate spellwork. A storm of holy energy ripped through the meeting place, instantly killing the ten priests. Yet Light's Wrath was left intact. The blast had purified the jewel and affixed it to the staff. Upon close inspection, Balnazzar found that the staff trembled with unstable energies. Wielding it with any reliability would be near impossible. Rather than destroy the weapon, the demon allowed the Scarlet Crusade to keep it. He looked forward to the mayhem it would cause in the years to come.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nAt some point, &lt;a href=\"Kirsta%20Deepshadow\"&gt;Kirsta Deepshadow&lt;/a&gt; was sent by the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; to gauge the strength of Hearthglen's defenses. She was to infiltrate the town but was injured, so she accepted the help of &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to assist her at Hearthglen Pass and inside Hearthglen as well.\nIn order to save his son from the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt; asked the adventurers to meet &lt;a href=\"Myranda%20the%20Hag\"&gt;Myranda the Hag&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Uther%27s%20Tomb\"&gt;Uther's Tomb&lt;/a&gt;, so they could be disguised and infiltrate Hearthglen to deliver &lt;a href=\"%3ATirion%27s%20Gift\"&gt;:Tirion's Gift&lt;/a&gt; without being attacked by the Scarlet crusaders. Upon receiving the box and its contents, &lt;a href=\"Taelan%20Fordring\"&gt;Taelan Fordring&lt;/a&gt; agreed to leave the Scarlet Crusade and reunite with his father outside of town, however, this betrayal triggered the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Crusader%20Dathrohan\"&gt;Grand Crusader Dathrohan&lt;/a&gt; (possessed by &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt;), who sent &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Inquisitor%20Isillien\"&gt;Grand Inquisitor Isillien&lt;/a&gt; to kill the Fordrings. After he managed to defeat the assassins, Tirion rushed to Hearthglen, where he witnessed Isillien killing Taelan. Spurred by his son's death, Tirion avenged him and vowed over his son's body to reform the original &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Order of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; as its Highlord, once more as a force of good dedicated to extinguishing the evil that plagued the world.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nPrior to the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Battle for Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"High%20Commander%20Galvar%20Pureblood\"&gt;High Commander Galvar Pureblood&lt;/a&gt; assembled a host of Scarlet armies in Hearthglen and the surrounding area to aid the Crusade at the east of &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Hand\"&gt;Tyr's Hand&lt;/a&gt;, along with crusaders from &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt;; the combined Scarlet armies were &lt;a href=\"An%20End%20To%20All%20Things...\"&gt;destroyed by the Scourge&lt;/a&gt; shortly thereafter, after they were led into a trap by the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"death%20knights%20of%20Acherus\"&gt;death knights of Acherus&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nWhen Tirion Fordring returned from &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; after the end of the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, he resumed the command of Hearthglen. The area is now controlled by the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; and serves as a training ground for its forces. The &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Daria%20L%27Rayne\"&gt;Daria L'Rayne&lt;/a&gt; was preserving the peace in the town. Recently, supplies from the town went missing, and Daria along with an adventurer discovered them among the Redpine gnolls at &lt;a href=\"Taelan%27s%20Tower\"&gt;Taelan's Tower&lt;/a&gt;.

{"id": "14267", "revid": "40320555", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=14267", "title": "Hearthstone", "text": "A hearthstone is an enchanted stone that can teleport the wielder to the location it is bound to, such as an &lt;a href=\"inn\"&gt;inn&lt;/a&gt;. All characters receive a Hearthstone upon creation that returns them to their starting area. Asking an &lt;a href=\"innkeeper\"&gt;innkeeper&lt;/a&gt; to \"make this inn your home\" will set that as your new home location. Should the player destroy their hearthstone, they can recreate one by simply speaking to an innkeeper.\nBackground.\nA hearthstone is a palm-sized, oval-shaped crystal bound by &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; magic to a particular person and place. They can be used to instantly travel from any distance to the stone's origin point. Only the specific person that a stone is bound to can make use of it. They are usually chiseled from a rare mineral, though &lt;a href=\"Lilian%20Voss\"&gt;Lilian Voss&lt;/a&gt; owns a hearthstone made of a chunk of gravestone. They are covered with glowing blue runes, one of them meaning \"home\" and the others referring to the location and person they're bound to. Teleporting using a hearthstone is referred to as \"hearthing\" and is done by holding the stone and concentrating until it flares and causes the holder to materialize at their destination.\nChanging an old hearthstone's spell patterns is a monumental task, but creating a new one even more so. They can stop working if they become worn or damaged. In order to change who a hearthstone is bound to, the owner and recipient both place their hands over each other while the recipient closes their hand tightly over the stone and concentrates, \"taking it into themselves\" and making it theirs, until a faint blue light lines both people's hands and the binding of the stone shifts to the new owner. Twice, &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; has been able to use &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;'s power to forcibly change who a hearthstone is bound to, but a stone can try to resist such an attempt if its current owner is still alive.\nHearthstones are very rare artifacts. They are known to have been used in the &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Empire\"&gt;Kaldorei Empire&lt;/a&gt; prior to the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian&lt;/a&gt; believed them to be only a legend, calling them \"things heard only in stories concerning magi... or elves.\" &lt;a href=\"Broll%20Bearmantle\"&gt;Broll Bearmantle&lt;/a&gt; had only seen a hearthstone twice prior to the &lt;a href=\"War%20Against%20the%20Nightmare\"&gt;War Against the Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;. Both the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; have lent hearthstones to &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to allow speedy relocation to areas in need of help.\nAccording to legend, the &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarven&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"innkeeper\"&gt;innkeeper&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bryher%20Stonekeeper\"&gt;Bryher Stonekeeper&lt;/a&gt; once made a deal with a &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; to turn his daughter &lt;a href=\"Keelin%20Stonekeeper\"&gt;Keelin&lt;/a&gt; into a hearthstone so that she would always return home to her father's inn. The &lt;a href=\"%3AHearthsteed\"&gt;:Hearthsteed&lt;/a&gt; is a magical construct rumored to be chiseled from the same mineral as hearthstones. &lt;a href=\"%3AHearthy\"&gt;:Hearthy&lt;/a&gt; is an animated hearthstone crafted by a powerful &lt;a href=\"wizard\"&gt;wizard&lt;/a&gt; who refused to wear robes with pockets.\nKnown hearthstones.\nThe following is a list of specific hearthstones known to exist in the lore. For \"World of Warcraft\" items that function as hearthstones, see the \"&lt;a href=\"%23Similar%20items\"&gt;Similar items&lt;/a&gt;\" section further down the page.\nIn World of Warcraft.\nA player's hearthstone is a key adventuring item in the game. Upon moving to a new area or reaching a new continent's capital city, players will often want to bind their hearthstone to the local &lt;a href=\"inn\"&gt;inn&lt;/a&gt; to allow efficient travel back to the area. Among the most common times to use it are:\nItem usage details.\nActivating the teleportation effect:\nWorking with innkeepers to manage hearthstone \"bind points\":\nSimilar items.\nSeveral items in the game have an effect similar to that of a hearthstone. The following ones share a cooldown with a regular hearthstone, essentially acting as a cosmetic change to the typical tool:\nAbilities that behave similarly to hearthstones without sharing a cooldown also exist, but are much rarer or more restricted:\nIt is possible to bind the hearthstone to a capital/hub city with many permanent &lt;a href=\"portal%20%28city%29\"&gt;portals&lt;/a&gt;, allowing access to many different continents through a single hearthstone location. During expansions in which the hub cities are not Orgrimmar and Stormwind, low-level characters can reach that city with the help of a friendly &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"portal%20%28spell%29\"&gt;portal&lt;/a&gt; spell, and they can use their hearthstones to return to the city later, then take a portal to a desired destination. This is sometimes done for &lt;a href=\"alt\"&gt;alt&lt;/a&gt;s for accessibility to cities far away from each other. However, since the hearthstone is committed to that one location, it becomes less useful and flexible for the smaller-scale movement an alt might be doing while questing.\nRecommended home locations.\nWhile leveling, players usually set their hearthstones either to a major city close to their questing zone, or individual inn locations where the quests revolve around. The capital allows for quick shifts in focus such as pausing questing to partake in holiday events or meeting with other players, while local locations allow hearthstones to be used \"tactically\" for short trips within a questing zone. Such hearthstones can still ease travel on the return trip from a capital city, of course.\nFor max level characters, those with fast flying mounts, or others not focused on questing and short-distance movement, ease of travel throughout the world is the priority. During most expansions, there is typically one \"hub\" city with many &lt;a href=\"portal%20%28city%29\"&gt;permanent portals&lt;/a&gt; to various continents, so players will want to bind their hearthstone in that hub, unless they have some other tool to get there such as the &lt;a href=\"Dalaran%20Hearthstone\"&gt;Dalaran Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;. See &lt;a href=\"Portal%20%28city%29\"&gt;Portal (city)&lt;/a&gt; for a list of past and present portal connections out of hub cities.\nLevel to level, if a player wishes to bind their hearthstone to a central location rather than local quest hubs, these locations often serve well:\nFor the Alliance\nFor the Horde\nRemoved functionality.\nDuring the \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" alpha, hearthstone functionally was made available by a spell called \"Word of Recall\".\nUntil &lt;a href=\"patch%203.1.0\"&gt;patch 3.1.0&lt;/a&gt;, it was possible to \"trick\" the game into teleporting characters to their hearthstone point while it was on cooldown. A player would create a group with someone else, zone into an easily accessible instance (such as the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Stockade\"&gt;Stockade&lt;/a&gt;), then pass the group lead to the other person and leave the group. The system would then teleport them to their hearthstone point as an invalid group member. This technique was known as \"ghetto hearthing\". Post-patch, the game transports such characters to the nearest graveyard instead of to the hearthstone location. At this time, the cooldown of a hearthstone was also lowered to 30 minutes, reducing the motivation for such tricks.\nIn other Blizzard games.\nThe digital card game \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\" is named after the famous stone. The game itself takes place in an inn and is narrated by the innkeeper who welcomes back returning players upon logging in. The trademark Hearthstone swirl also serves as the game's logo.\nHearthstones can also be found in the team brawler \"&lt;a href=\"Heroes%20of%20the%20Storm\"&gt;Heroes of the Storm&lt;/a&gt;\", where it serves a similar purpose to that in \"World of Warcraft\", to teleport the player back to the Hall of Storms."}

It was announced on 22 March 2013 at PAX East 2013, and entered closed beta in the Americas region on 16 August 2013, and in the European region on 4 September 2013. The game entered open beta worldwide on 21 January 2014, and was fully released 11 March 2014.\n\"Hearthstone\" is available on Microsoft Windows and OS X operating systems, and on iPad, supporting iPad Air, iPad 4th generation, iPad 3rd generation, iPad 2, iPad mini, Android, iPhone and iPad mini with Retina display. \"Hearthstone\" is planned to available for Windows 8 Touch and in the Windows 10 store.\nIn \"Hearthstone\", players can choose to play as one of nine legendary \"Warcraft\" heroes, taking turns to play cards from their customizable decks to cast potent spells, use heroic weapons or abilities, or summon powerful minions to crush their opponent. \nPlayers can compete for glory and standing in the game's Ranked Play mode, battle legendary bosses from \"World of Warcraft\"'s history in adventure mode, or forge a unique deck of randomly selected cards in the Arena, and can complete quests and earn prizes to gain gold and powerful new cards for their collection, constructing formidable decks with which to do battle. \"Hearthstone\" is designed to be a quick and accessible card game, that nonetheless features substantial strategic depth for more serious players.\nGame details.\n\"Hearthstone\" is a collectible card game that revolves around turn-based online 1vs1 matches between two opponents, operated through &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Battle.net\"&gt;Battle.net&lt;/a&gt;. Players can do battle as one of nine classes, with each offering its own strengths, powers and synergies, and can create their own custom decks from their card collections.\nPlayers start the game with a substantial collection of 'basic' cards, but can gain rarer and more powerful cards through purchasing packs of additional cards, or as reward for competing in the Arena. Card packs and entry to the Arena can be purchased using real money, or gold, an in-game currency earned through completing special quests. Players can choose from a number of game modes, with each offering a slightly different experience. \n\"Hearthstone\" is set within the \"Warcraft\" universe, with its characters, abilities and items drawing from existing lore. The game features detailed card art, much previously used for the \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft%20Trading%20Card%20Game\"&gt;World of Warcraft Trading Card Game&lt;/a&gt;\", and uses infamous quotes and comical soundbites to bring to life many well-known characters from the franchise's history. \"Hearthstone\" also features colourful visuals and animated game boards, with interactive features to entertain players between rounds.\nMatches.\nEach \"Hearthstone\" battle is a 1vs1 match between two opponents. Gameplay in \"Hearthstone\" is turn-based, with players taking turns to play cards from their hand, casting spells, equipping weapons, or summoning 'minions' to do battle on their behalf. Play may be between two human players, or one player and a computer-controlled opponent.\nEach player is represented by their chosen 'hero', an important character from \"Warcraft\" lore. Each hero represents a particular class, determining the special cards and unique hero power available to them. Each hero has 30 Health - if that number is reduced to zero, the hero is destroyed, and the controlling player has lost the game. For a list of heroes and classes, &lt;a href=\"%23Classes%20and%20heroes\"&gt;see below&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the start of each turn, the player draws a new card from their deck - a collection of 30 cards selected before battle. Players can choose to play using one of several pre-assembled 'basic' decks, or one of their own custom-made decks. While most cards are available to heroes of any class, a substantial portion are limited to a specific class, giving each hero their own strengths and unique possibilities.\nDuring their turn, each player can choose to play any of their cards, use their hero power, command their minions to attack targets, or or attack directly using their hero, if they have a weapon equipped. However, which actions the player is able to take is partly determined by their mana. Each player starts the game with 0 mana crystals, but gains one at the start of each turn, until the maximum of 10 is reached. Each card and hero power requires the player to expend a specific amount of mana in order to play it, strategically limiting each player's actions. In addition, the larger mana pools in later rounds allow players to play increasingly expensive cards, opening the game up to ever more impressive moves and powerful abilities.\nA match is concluded when one or both players has reached zero health, or chooses to concede. Completing a battle will grant each player's hero experience (with additional experience granted for winning) and can allow players to complete quests and earn gold. Winning games can also allow players to earn rewards in Arena and attain higher ranks in Ranked play.\nEach match takes place on a randomly selected battlefield, representing the board on which the game is played. There are four possible battlefields: Stormwind, Orgrimmar, Pandaria and Stranglethorn. Each battlefield features its own design and numerous interactive elements, such as catapults that can be loaded and fired, bells that can be rung, windows and boxes that can be knocked at and broken, and lurking beasts that can be driven back into the shadows. However, these elements are purely for entertainment and in no way affect gameplay. \nClasses and heroes.\nPlayers can choose from 10 classes, representing the classes from \"World of Warcraft\". Each class is represented by a legendary figure from \"Warcraft\"'s history.\nClass determines which class-specific cards can be used, as well as granting a unique hero power - a special non-card ability which can be used once per turn for 2 mana. Through these mechanics, each class has its own powers, synergies and style. Unlike in \"World of Warcraft\", it is not necessary to create a separate character in order to play as a new class - players can switch at will to a new class, using either a default basic deck or a custom deck of their own construction.\nEach hero begins at level 1, and can be raised through earning experience to level 60 (matching the original level cap for \"World of Warcraft\"). Every two levels up to level 10 will reward players with a pair of new class-specific cards, similar to the learning of core abilities in \"World of Warcraft\". Above level 10, reaching certain levels will grant golden versions of existing basic cards, a purely cosmetic reward which serves to display the player's progress to opponents in battle.\nCards.\nCards are the main substance of \"Hearthstone\", representing the abilities, characters and effects which each player is able to make use of during the match. There are currently 2,816 playable cards in the game, 2,187 of which can be collected, with more added each &lt;a href=\"expansion\"&gt;expansion&lt;/a&gt;.\nEach player starts the game with a wide selection of 'basic' cards. Cards of higher rarity can be obtained by purchasing card packs, or as reward for success in the Arena. Card packs and entry to the Arena can be purchased using real money, or 'gold', an in-game currency earned through completing special 'quests', such as winning a certain number of matches, or dealing a certain amount of damage. Each card pack consists of five random cards, including at least one 'rare' card. Obtaining new cards allows the player to add them to their decks, opening up new possibilities for play and strategy.\nPlaying a card consumes mana equal to that card's mana cost, displayed in the top-left corner of each card.\nTypes.\nThere are three main types of card: minions, spells and weapons.\nMinions.\nMinion cards can be used to summon the described creature onto the battlefield, where they will fight for the player. Minion cards feature an Attack value, reflecting the damage that minion can deal in combat, a Health value, reflecting how much damage the minion can take before being destroyed. Minions are controlled by the player who summoned them, and can be commanded to attack their opponent's minions, or even the opposing hero. Minions with Taunt can act as tanks, preventing the opponent's forces from attacking the hero directly with melee attacks until that minion is destroyed. Minions are a major element in battles between heroes, and are usually responsible for the majority of all damage dealt in a game. Minions are the most common type of card.\nSpells.\nSpell cards are cards that can be played to trigger a one time effect or ability, described in the card's text. In contrast to a minion or weapon card, a spell card will expire immediately after it has been used. Spells include many powerful and useful direct effects, such as damage and removal effects, minion buffs and hidden secret abilities. Spell cards do not have an Attack or Health value.\nWeapons.\nWeapons are special cards which can be equipped by heroes. Each weapon has an Attack value and a Durability value. Each hero can only equip one weapon at a time, and equipping a new weapon will destroy the old one. Attacking using a weapon deals damage equal to its Attack, and reduces its Durability by 1. When a weapon's Durability is reduced to zero, the weapon will be destroyed. All classes except druids, priests and mages have some weapons available to them, with rogues, paladins and warriors generally considered to have the greatest synergy with weapons. Weapons are the least common type of card.\nDecks.\nIn all game modes except 'Arena', the player does battle using a deck of 30 cards, constructed from cards in the player's collection. Each deck can only feature two of each card, and only one of each 'legendary' card. Arena play features no such limitations, but requires players to play using a new deck chosen from a series of randomly provided selections. For either type of deck, the construction of a player's deck is a key strategic element in the game, determining which cards are available to them during the course of a match. Each deck is also limited by its chosen class, with class-specific cards only available in decks of the same class. \nPlayers are provided with a basic deck for each class, and can create their own custom decks through the collection manager.\nCard set and rarity.\nIn addition to type, cards are divided in two primary ways: card set and rarity.\nCard set deals with how a card is obtained. Basic cards are available freely to all players, either being included in their collections from the start of the game, or gained through raising the appropriate class to level 10, while expert cards are obtained through card packs or as Arena rewards. The other card sets, reward and promotions, include a small number of cards available through completing special quests, or in relation to real-world promotions. While basic cards form the foundation for any deck, the most powerful and outlandish cards belong to the expert and other sets. \nRarity refers to a card's overall quality and scarcity. \"Hearthstone\" uses a rarity color-scheme similar to that of \"World of Warcraft\", with the exception that there is no 'uncommon' rarity. The rarities and matching colors are therefore , , , and . However, unlike in \"World of Warcraft\", rarity does not directly affect the strength of a card through means such as &lt;a href=\"item%20level\"&gt;item level&lt;/a&gt;. Rather, rarity tends to roughly illustrate some degree of increased power or utility. A common expert minion will usually bring higher stats or more powerful abilities than a basic minion of the same mana cost, but lower stats or less utility than the equivalent rare or epic minion. Fittingly, legendary cards are especially notable, depicting key characters from \"Warcraft\" lore, and typically bring extraordinary powers to the game, such as sourcing new cards directly from the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;, or manipulating the very sands of time. \nNonetheless, while higher rarity cards offer an overall advantage over lower rarity equivalents, \"Hearthstone\"'s tactical nature generally prevents players from winning by rarity of cards alone. While a well-timed star appearance can be enough to tip the scales in the player's favor, not every legendary is considered a strong card, and even &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; himself is quite capable of being beaten by a free or common card under the right circumstances.\nCrafting and disenchanting.\nPlayers can also use the crafting system to create new cards. The system uses 'arcane dust' to craft specific cards. Arcane dust can be obtained as an Arena reward, or by destroying existing cards, allowing players to convert unwanted cards into more desirable options. The crafting system was created as an alternative to the player card trading prevalent in trading card games such as \"Magic: The Gathering\", removing the risk, uncertainty and imbalance found in the trading of cards between players, and providing players with a reliable and direct means of obtaining specific cards, which nonetheless allows players to trade-in their unwanted cards for more desirable alternatives. There are no plans to introduce card-trading between players.\nGolden cards.\nSimilar to the 'foils' found in physical collectible card games, \"Hearthstone\" features 'golden' cards, special versions of regular cards featuring a golden border and unique animations. These cards are far harder to obtain than their regular versions, and cost more arcane dust to craft. Golden cards differ from their regular counterparts purely cosmetically, and are designed to allow players to show off their accomplishments. Golden basic cards can be obtained by levelling heroes, while golden versions of cards from other sets must be crafted or gained from card packs or rewards.\nAcquiring cards.\nNew cards can be earned in several ways. Players begin the game with a substantial collection of basic cards, and can earn further basic class cards through raising each hero to level 10. To collect expert cards, players can either spend gold or real money to purchase card packs directly, or may win packs or individual cards as reward for competing in the Arena. Card packs are packs of 5 random cards, guaranteed to contain at least 1 rare or higher rarity card. Some cards can also be acquired through completing special quests, such as by collecting all murloc minions.\nGame modes.\nFour main game modes are available to play in \"Hearthstone\", with each offering a slightly different set of rules, and its own rewards.\nSingle-player.\nTutorial.\nThe game features a Tutorial, a limited and non-repeatable starting experience designed to introduce players to \"Hearthstone\", in which the player is pitched against a series of special opponents, with substantial dialogue elements.\nAdventure mode.\nAdventure mode refers to the entire single-player experience provided by Hearthstone, consisting of the three game modes: Practice mode, Adventures, and Missions.\nPractice mode.\nPractice mode allows players to do battle against a selection of computer opponents. Players can choose which class to play against, as well as one of two difficulty settings: basic and expert. Each opponent and difficulty setting features its own deck. \nBasic opponents offer players a chance to learn the basics of the game, explore a new class, or prepare for battle in Play mode, and use decks comprising only basic cards. Expert opponents offer a stiffer challenge, giving players the chance to try their hand against decks featuring higher rarity cards and specific plays.\nPlayers can unlock and level heroes in Practice mode, making it the ideal mode for exploring a new class and acquiring its basic cards. The choice of opponent also allows players to focus on problem classes.\nAdventures.\ns are non-free single-player PvE game modes, revolving around special boss encounters. Each adventure has a theme, and brings around a small new collectable card set to the game, including neutral and class-specific cards. \nAdventures feature a selection of battles against computer-controlled bosses, each representing a well-known adversary from Warcraft lore. Each boss presents a unique encounter, featuring special hero powers and decks. Bosses uses a combination of regular cards and boss cards, special and often extremely powerful cards not available to players. Bosses can be encountered in Normal or Heroic mode, and defeating a Heroic boss usually presents quite a challenge, with players needing to devise special decks to counter the mechanics of that specific fight.\nAdventures also feature Class Challenges, special class-specific versions of existing boss battles using specific prepared decks.\nAdventures offer rewards in the form of new cards to use in the rest of play, as well as a new card for defeating all bosses in Heroic mode.\nMissions.\ns refer to the free single-player adventure game modes.\nMultiplayer.\nPlay mode.\nPlay mode matches players against other human players of similar skill, in random matches. Players can choose to play Casual 'friendly' games, or take part in Ranked play, earning ranks and special rewards to reflect their skill and standing within the community. \nRanked play features a 26-tier rank system, with wins allowing the player to progress to higher ranks, and losses causing them to descend in rank. All ranks are subject to a soft-reset at the end of each season, with each season lasting for one month. Ranked play also provides special cosmetic rewards, including alternate card back designs and animated golden hero portraits. \nArena.\nThe Arena offers a unique challenge, with players forging a new deck from a random selection of cards before using it to do battle in a series of games. A successful run in Arena can offer substantial rewards, including gold, Arcane Dust and card packs, but can be costly and difficult to achieve. Access to the Arena is purchased with gold or real money.\nUnlike other game modes, the Arena does not use a pre-made deck, but one that is assembled at the start of that Arena run. Upon entering the Arena the player is given a random selection of 3 classes to choose one. Once a class has been chosen, the player is provided with 30 selections of 3 possible cards, choosing one - and only one - from each selection, slowly building a full deck. Unlike other decks, which are limited to 2 of each card, decks made in Arena may feature any number of the same card. As in any game mode, the strength of the deck constructed is a large part of achieving victory, but Arena's randomised process offers players an additional challenge in anticipating the cards on offer.\nOnce a deck is constructed, the player is placed in a series of matched games using that deck, although the games do not have to be played all at once. Once the player has won 12 games, or lost 3, the Arena run is ended, and the player is offered a reward determined by their accomplishments that run. Players who do well can reap handsome rewards, but failing to achieve a good run can turn the Arena into an expensive gamble.\nBattlegrounds.\n is a game mode where eight players face off in 1v1 rounds, with the goal to be the last player standing. Each round consists of two phases. The Recruit Phase lets players can purchase and sell minions, upgrade the tavern, use their hero power, and rearrange their minions' attack order. Combat Phase has minions automatically attacking the opponents' until one player (or both) has no minions remaining, at which point the victor attacks the loser directly.\nUnlike other play modes, Battlegrounds has a set of cards totally unique to itself (although many are functionally identical to collectible cards) as well as a pool of specialized heroes. All Battlegrounds cards are available from the beginning.\nBattlegrounds is significantly different from all other play modes in Hearthstone, featuring completely different mechanics from anything previously seen. There is no mana: instead, the only currency is Coins (similar to the Bartender Bob, Bartendotron, and Bazaar Bob encounters from previous Single-player adventures). All minions cost 3 coins, with the power of minions instead dictated by their Tavern Tier, taking the usual place of mana on the card interface. Minions do not attack the opponent directly - rather, surviving minions add Tavern Tier to the hero's attack once the round is over. \nDuels.\n is a game mode where players face off against other players, attempting to claim 12 victories before they suffer 3 losses, similar to Arena. However, instead of drafting a deck, players are offered a choice between 4 of Hearthstone's 10 classes, then one of three of special class Hero Powers, followed by one of six of that class's Signature Treasures. Players then must build a 16-card deck, using 15 cards from their collection, and the treasure they selected.\nAt the end of each round, whether it was a win or a loss, the player gains 5 higher maximum health and chooses three cards to add to their deck from three separate choices, similar to Dungeon Run and other single-player missions. Occasionally, the player can also pick a passive or active treasure to add to their deck.\nTavern Brawl.\nTavern Brawls is a \"For Fun\" game mode, offering a wide array of rules and changes every week. Tavern Brawls are available between Wednesdays to Sundays (in the Americas). Tavern Brawls are unlocked for players who have reached level 20 on at least one hero. The first win of the Tavern Brawl week grants a free Classic Card Pack as well.\nEach Tavern Brawl presents a limited time opportunity to face other players in special matches with unique rules. These might be requiring players to use special pre-made decks, adding random cards or minions, or changing the very rules of ability activation or mana use. Some Tavern Brawls allow the player to construct special decks especially for the challenge from within the game mode itself, while others provide powerful premade decks, or entirely random decks, and some Brawls even see players take control of special heroes with their own Hero Powers or contain co-op or single-player encounters. Some Brawls feature Tavern Brawl cards, special cards not available in other types of play, as well as boss cards from adventures. Each week sees a fresh Tavern Brawl, with its own unique rules.\nFriendly Challenge.\nA duel players challenge players to on their friends' list to unranked matches. Duels offer no rewards, save the satisfaction of crushing your friends in combat.\nExpansions and other game additions.\nEach year, \"Hearthstone\" receives three s, which add new cards available through card packs and crafting. Each expansion has its own setting and theme and generally introduces unique mechanics or new card abilities based on said theme. Between the game's release in 2014 and the start of the in spring 2017, \"Hearthstone\" content releases alternated between expansions and PvE &lt;a href=\"%23Adventures\"&gt;adventures&lt;/a&gt;. Starting in 2017, no standalone adventures are released and each expansion instead features optional adventure-style content that mainly serves to illustrate the expansion's story and characters. Beginning at the end of 2020, expansions are also accompanied by a mini-set released a few months later, which mix and match together themes from the rest of the year.\nLore.\nThe &lt;a href=\"canon\"&gt;canon&lt;/a&gt;icity of the game of \"Hearthstone\" is that of &lt;a href=\"flavor%20lore\"&gt;flavor lore&lt;/a&gt;. It is a card game developed and played at &lt;a href=\"inn\"&gt;inn&lt;/a&gt;s around &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and , as can be seen in \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\", but as such may not accurately represent things as they really are.\nMore specifically, the game mainly takes place in &lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20inn\"&gt;a special inn&lt;/a&gt;, owned by the &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarven&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"innkeeper\"&gt;innkeeper&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Harth%20Stonebrew\"&gt;Harth Stonebrew&lt;/a&gt;, whose visitors claim that it appeared to them when they most needed it in locations as wildly different as &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20of%20Sorrows\"&gt;Swamp of Sorrows&lt;/a&gt;.\nThough \"Hearthstone\" mostly draws from already existing \"Warcraft\" lore, it has also introduced many new concepts, characters, and even races not seen in previously established canon material, such as &lt;a href=\"Skycap%27n%20Kragg\"&gt;Skycap'n Kragg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Elise%20Starseeker\"&gt;Elise Starseeker&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"energy-camel\"&gt;energy-camel&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"tortollan\"&gt;tortollan&lt;/a&gt;s, moreso in recent expansions and adventures. Whether or not these actually exist within the canon \"Warcraft\" universe has not yet been determined. Some elements and characters (such as Skycap'n Kragg and the tortollans) have since made the transition into \"World of Warcraft\", making them canon, though elements of them often differ from their original \"Hearthstone\" depictions. For a comprehensive list of \"Hearthstone\"-specific characters, see \"\" on the \"Hearthstone\" wiki.\nIn-universe, Hearthstone is played in several locations, such as the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Two%20Moons\"&gt;Shrine of Two Moons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Seven%20Stars\"&gt;Shrine of Seven Stars&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Flayers%27%20Point\"&gt;Flayers' Point&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Desolace\"&gt;Desolace&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Guardian%27s%20Study\"&gt;Guardian's Study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Greywatch\"&gt;Greywatch&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormheim\"&gt;Stormheim&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Lowtide%20Tavern\"&gt;Lowtide Tavern&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Drustvar\"&gt;Drustvar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Deadwash\"&gt;Deadwash&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormsong%20Valley\"&gt;Stormsong Valley&lt;/a&gt;, an unnamed inn in &lt;a href=\"Freehold\"&gt;Freehold&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Tiragarde%20Sound\"&gt;Tiragarde Sound&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Missing%20Hinge%20Inn\"&gt;Missing Hinge Inn&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Azure%20Span\"&gt;Azure Span&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Algeth%27ar%20Academy\"&gt;Algeth'ar Academy&lt;/a&gt;. Several characters, such as &lt;a href=\"Railmaster%20Rocketspark\"&gt;Railmaster Rocketspark&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Yumadormu\"&gt;Yumadormu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Great%20Akazamzarak\"&gt;The Great Akazamzarak&lt;/a&gt;, own Hearthstone cards, and the &lt;a href=\"gorilla\"&gt;gorilla&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Winstone\"&gt;Winstone&lt;/a&gt; is a champion Hearthstone player. Hearthstone as an in-universe game may be older than previously assumed, as it is tradition in &lt;a href=\"Guo-Hee%20Calmwater\"&gt;Guo-Hee Calmwater&lt;/a&gt;'s family to pass card collections from parent to firstborn. &lt;a href=\"Mysterious%20Apparition\"&gt;A drakonid ghost&lt;/a&gt; used to collect cards before their death millennia ago, but it seems their own variant of the game had some differences with the modern one.\nFor more information, see \"\" on the \"Hearthstone\" wiki.\nCrossover and references.\nFrom the game's very first announcement, there has been talk of cross-play between \"Hearthstone\" and \"World of Warcraft\". During the game's alpha test the developers were already discussing the possibility of allowing players to play \"Hearthstone\" from within \"World of Warcraft\". However, no solid plans have yet been announced.\nOne possible avenue for the eventual introduction of cross-play came with &lt;a href=\"patch%205.4.0\"&gt;patch 5.4.0&lt;/a&gt;, when two full-sized \"Hearthstone\" boards were added to each faction's shrine in the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt;. These detailed, three-dimensional sets come with cards, mana crystals and even a tiny gryphon on the Stormwind map used by the models. NPCs can be found playing the game from nearby benches and spectating, apparently discussing the game in progress and occasionally cheering the players on. No moving parts are involved, although every so often a small &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Explosion\"&gt;Arcane Explosion&lt;/a&gt; occurs above the game board. Players are free to sit on the benches around unoccupied boards, with some roleplayers including games of \"Hearthstone\" in their \"WoW\" characters' activities. Some have even begun taking their \"WoW\" characters over to \"Hearthstone\" for some in-character fun with their roleplaying friends and guildmates.\nTo mark the release of \"Hearthstone\", on 11 March 2014 the &lt;a href=\"Hearthsteed\"&gt;Hearthsteed&lt;/a&gt; mount was made available to \"World of Warcraft\" players as a reward for winning three games in \"Hearthstone\"'s Play or Arena modes. As a free to play game, this served to encourage \"WoW\" players to try \"Hearthstone\", and marked the first significant and rewarding crossover between the two games.\nThe developers have discussed the possibility of adding further crossover in the future, such as \"Hearthstone\" card packs dropping from \"WoW\" bosses.\nWith &lt;a href=\"patch%206.0.2\"&gt;patch 6.0.2&lt;/a&gt;, two new toys related with Hearthstone were released (&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20Board\"&gt;Hearthstone Board&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Winning%20Hand\"&gt;Winning Hand&lt;/a&gt;). Also, a garrison quest related to Hearthstone was added where the follower have to face 3 famous decks (Zoolock, Miracle Rogue and Control Warrior). The awards are the &lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20Strategy%20Guide\"&gt;Hearthstone Strategy Guide&lt;/a&gt; (that teaches a follower the Hearthstone Pro trait) and &lt;a href=\"Autographed%20Hearthstone%20Card\"&gt;Autographed Hearthstone Card&lt;/a&gt; (a toy with references to famous players of Hearthstone). During the &lt;a href=\"Rocketspark%20and%20Borka\"&gt;Rocketspark and Borka&lt;/a&gt; encounter in &lt;a href=\"Grimrail%20Depot\"&gt;Grimrail Depot&lt;/a&gt;, players can force &lt;a href=\"Borka%20the%20Brute\"&gt;Borka the Brute&lt;/a&gt; to destroy several of &lt;a href=\"Railmaster%20Rocketspark\"&gt;Railmaster Rocketspark&lt;/a&gt;'s possessions, including his entire collection of \"Hearthstone\" cards.\nOn the 14th of March 2016, it was announced on the official \"Hearthstone\" website that &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt;, the new alternate hero (player character) for the &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt; class, would be obtained through a special \"World of Warcraft\" promotion. Rather than being purchased with real money like the previously released alternate heroes, to obtain Liadrin one must level at least one \"World of Warcraft\" character to level 20 and earn the &lt;a href=\"Fledgling%20Hero%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;Fledgling Hero of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt; achievement.\nIn ', players can find a in the &lt;a href=\"Nighthold%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Nighthold&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"the%20Great%20Akazamzarak\"&gt;the Great Akazamzarak&lt;/a&gt; is the owner of a golden &lt;a href=\"Dr.%20Boom\"&gt;Dr. Boom&lt;/a&gt; . &lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20Card\"&gt;Discarded Hearthstone cards&lt;/a&gt; are picked up from the &lt;a href=\"Legerdemain%20Lounge\"&gt;Legerdemain Lounge&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Inscription\"&gt;Inscription&lt;/a&gt; quest &lt;a href=\"Clues%20Abound\"&gt;Clues Abound&lt;/a&gt;, while in ', a pair of &lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20Enthusiast\"&gt;Hearthstone Enthusiast&lt;/a&gt;s can be found at &lt;a href=\"Anyport\"&gt;Anyport&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Drustvar\"&gt;Drustvar&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20Card%20%28Mechagon%29\"&gt;Different Hearthstone cards&lt;/a&gt; can also be found on &lt;a href=\"Mechagon%20Island\"&gt;Mechagon Island&lt;/a&gt;.\nDevelopment.\nEarly development.\n\"Hearthstone\" was developed by &lt;a href=\"Team%205\"&gt;Team 5&lt;/a&gt;, which was formed in 2008. The desire was to create a game in a genre Blizzard had not designed for before, in this case, a card game. It was decided early in development that the game would be based on the \"Warcraft\" universe, borrowing creatures, powers, and heroes from the franchise. In this early stage of development, &lt;a href=\"Chris%20Metzen\"&gt;Chris Metzen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Morhaime\"&gt;Mike Morhaime&lt;/a&gt; were enthusiastic about the project, but doubts existed within Blizzard. Additionally, it has been stated that the development of \"Hearthstone\" began as an attempt to recapture elements of the \"Warcraft\" RTS games, namely the tongue-in-cheek moments. As \"World of Warcraft\" shifted to epic-scale events, \"Hearthstone\" was seen as an opportunity to bring back some of the early games' irreverence. It was decided that the game would be based around cards rather than pieces, in order to differentiate \"Hearthstone\" from the RTS games.\nThe development knew they would be walking a line between remaining faithful to the \"Warcraft\" visual style, while also giving the game its own identity. During the game's inception phase, four design pillars were established:\nBy this point, \"Hearthstone\" was still an unnamed game, and many in Blizzard weren't sold on the game. A point of contention was the fact that the game wouldn't focus on a Horde vs. Alliance scenario, which was considered integral to the \"Warcraft\" IP. To sell the idea, a &lt;a href=\"https%3A//wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/File%3AHearthstone_Announcement_key_art.jpg\"&gt;piece of art&lt;/a&gt; was illustrated by &lt;a href=\"Laurel%20Austin\"&gt;Laurel Austin&lt;/a&gt;, showing Horde and Alliance characters in the same room and having fun. The idea was that \"Hearthstone\" could show the two factions getting along. The artwork proved integral in getting staff to warm up to the concept.\nWhen it came to choosing the game's title, an open call was put out to all Blizzard employees to suggest a name. \"Hearthstone\" was one of the suggestions, and it was a name that the developers kept coming back to, and eventually settled upon. &lt;a href=\"Harth%20Stonebrew\"&gt;Harth Stonebrew&lt;/a&gt; was designed to be the \"face\" of the game.\nA lot of time was spent on \"paper design,\" where the developers nailed down ideas while Team 5's engineers were temporarily transferred to work on \"World of Warcraft\". Physical cards were designed in this period as per the lack of engineers. A flash prototype was also created. In terms of mechanics, this version was practically identical to the final version, though lacked the artistic style. The engineers used this version as the basis for the final version in terms of mechanics.\nVersions of the game were rolled out for internal play within Blizzard layer by layer, steadily giving more and more people access to the game. By December 2012 \"Hearthstone\" had gained broad exposure within Blizzard, and there was more confidence in the project. Prior to the summer of 2013, members of &lt;a href=\"Team%204\"&gt;Team 4&lt;/a&gt; had been transferred to work on the game.\nLater development.\nIn August 2013 the game entered closed beta, with full release eventually coming in March 2014. As of October 2014, over 20 million people have played the game. It had the internal effect of getting Blizzard to look at the potential for other platforms. As of February 2018 however, the game has not been ported to any console, and there are no plans to release it on the Nintendo Switch.\nA conceptual shift occurred in 2014, with the release of the \"Goblins vs. Gnomes\" expansion. Cinematics Director &lt;a href=\"Jeremiah%20Johnson\"&gt;Jeremiah Johnson&lt;/a&gt; started singing and dancing the lyrics that would appear in the expansion's trailer. This set the stage for future trailers which would feature lyrics to sell the theme. As time went on, \"Hearthstone\" began asking \"What if?\" in regards to the \"Warcraft\" setting. \"One Night in Karazhan\" is an example of this philosophy, the question of \"What if (Medivh held a party in Karazhan when he was young, before it became haunted)?\"\nAs of April 2017, the game has 70 million registered users.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

A squad of &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s will say they stumbled in off the streets of &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; during an unseasonable storm, and a caravan of &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt; traders might claim they slogged through the &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20of%20Sorrows\"&gt;Swamp of Sorrows&lt;/a&gt; for days before finding the inn in the middle of nowhere. There is one constant: all patrons of the Inn found it when they needed it most, when they couldn't bring themselves to take another step.\nThe Inn gets rowdy from time to time, but as long as the visitors stick to their fists it's fine. &lt;a href=\"Harth%20Stonebrew\"&gt;The Innkeeper&lt;/a&gt; is stronger than he looks, and as soon as anyone pulls out their blade or magic, they'll probably find themselves flying out of the front door, and, if they're very lucky, end up on a street in a city they recognized.\nMany who leave the Inn do so with a \"Hearthstone\" board tucked under their arm, since most people have trouble finding the Inn more than twice a year.\nThe Inn is the kind of place that will always welcome anyone and everyone who's willing to play fair and have fun, so it tends to get all sorts of visitors, but some crowds leave more of an impression than the others. During the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Tournament\"&gt;Grand Tournament&lt;/a&gt;, most of the visitors were wearing \"the shiniest armor you ever saw\", including the magic-using types. The Innkeeper claims to have even seen &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt;s geared up in plate, and a young &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarven&lt;/a&gt; woman leading a majestic &lt;a href=\"unicorn\"&gt;unicorn&lt;/a&gt; around the common room.\nOf course, the Inn has a knack for putting itself right where the excitement is."}

Does such a man exist?\nIt took much research, but through bits of overheard stories, I managed to find two men that should do.\nThe first is Dalin Forgewright, who has dedicated himself to the care of the &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; refugees, whom are refused by their kin at the &lt;a href=\"Greymane%20Wall\"&gt;Greymane Wall&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe other is Comar Villard, a man who remains faithful to his lost love, wandering the &lt;a href=\"Wetlands\"&gt;Wetlands&lt;/a&gt; for a sign of his wife.\nDeliver their hearts to Carendin.

Bring me the hearts and you will impress me once again.\nCompletion.\nThe heart of a goodly man seems much the same as any, when you see it like this, don't you think?\nPerhaps we possess something of a... different... view on the subject. These will do, though. I have no doubt that a succubus would be attracted by their purity.\nNotes.\nTo find Dalin, follow the main road south through &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt;. When the path forks to head to the &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt;, continue south along the path. You will eventually come across a giant wall blocking the path. Dalin is mounted on a horse and roams back and forth along the wall.\nFinding Comar is much more difficult as you must cross several contested zones. Travel through the &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt; and then head east into the &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt;. On PvP servers, depending on the time of day, there is a good chance you will get attacked by &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; players much higher than you. You might want to swing by &lt;a href=\"Tarren%20Mill\"&gt;Tarren Mill&lt;/a&gt; to pick up the flypoint if you haven't done that yet. Continue east through Hillsbrad into the &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands\"&gt;Arathi Highlands&lt;/a&gt;. While Arathi isn't as populated with Alliance players, the creatures here are much higher. Your goal here is to make it to the &lt;a href=\"Thandol%20Span\"&gt;Thandol Span&lt;/a&gt; on the southern border. However, you might want to swing by &lt;a href=\"Hammerfall\"&gt;Hammerfall&lt;/a&gt; to get the flypoint there as well. Cross the Span into the &lt;a href=\"Wetlands\"&gt;Wetlands&lt;/a&gt;. You will find Comar just inside the Wetlands on the west side of the road.\nAnother strategy can be taking the &lt;a href=\"zeppelin\"&gt;zeppelin&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt;, and walk to him either as &lt;a href=\"ghost\"&gt;ghost&lt;/a&gt; or without dying, and use a resurrection point near him.\nA third strategy is crossing the Great Sea from Hillsbrad Foothills straight to the Thandol Span. Running with a Death Knight (for Path of Frost) or a Shaman (Water Walking) can speed this up."}

They are &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s whose bodies have been contorted by the ancient &lt;a href=\"Drust\"&gt;Drust&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; that they wield. When a witch grows powerful enough, they slit their own throats to &lt;a href=\"Matron\"&gt;ascend&lt;/a&gt;. Witchcraft has long been a superstition of the people of Drustvar, but only recently did some of these superstitions become a reality.\nHistory.\nThe birth of the Coven began when &lt;a href=\"Meredith%20Waycrest\"&gt;Meredith Waycrest&lt;/a&gt;, stricken with grief due to her ailing husband &lt;a href=\"Arthur%20Waycrest\"&gt;Arthur&lt;/a&gt;, called out to any power that could save him. The &lt;a href=\"Drust\"&gt;Drust&lt;/a&gt; king &lt;a href=\"Gorak%20Tul\"&gt;Gorak Tul&lt;/a&gt; answered her cry and promised that death would never part the couple, but for a price. In exchange for his magic, she would recruit new members to the Coven and together, they would bring Gorak Tul back to the realm of the living. Meredith started by recruiting several girls from Corlain. They would go to the manor at night and return back home in the morning. After adapting to their newfound powers, they moved on to live subjects. They started to kidnap the local populace and take them to &lt;a href=\"Waycrest%20Manor\"&gt;Waycrest Manor&lt;/a&gt;. The guards were also placed under a curse making them slaves to the Coven. Eventually, the entirety of Corlain was under their control, those that didn't flee to &lt;a href=\"Arom%27s%20Stand\"&gt;Arom's Stand&lt;/a&gt; were bound by a spell for later use.\nWith Corlain in their hands, the Coven began sending more of their followers to nearby lands. They send &lt;a href=\"Sister%20Littlefield\"&gt;Sister Littlefield&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Arom%27s%20Stand\"&gt;Arom's Stand&lt;/a&gt; to corrupt the refugees of Corlain by recruiting them as new members. The soldiers of &lt;a href=\"Watchman%27s%20Rise\"&gt;Watchman's Rise&lt;/a&gt; were bound to their control with &lt;a href=\"Sister%20Adela\"&gt;Sister Adela&lt;/a&gt; calling the shots. &lt;a href=\"Sister%20Noella%20Briarwood\"&gt;Sister Noella Briarwood&lt;/a&gt; went to &lt;a href=\"Falconhurst\"&gt;Falconhurst&lt;/a&gt;, with her advanced magic, she created an army of wickermen known as the Briarwood. The &lt;a href=\"Briarwood\"&gt;Briarwood&lt;/a&gt; attacked the villagers and they forced them into a corner by the sea. Another witch was sent to &lt;a href=\"Bleak%20Hills%20Mine\"&gt;Bleak Hills Mine&lt;/a&gt; where an army of &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt;s was corrupted by Drust magic and attacked the local miners. &lt;a href=\"Matron%20Levae\"&gt;Matron Levae&lt;/a&gt; was sent to &lt;a href=\"Fletcher%27s%20Hollow\"&gt;Fletcher's Hollow&lt;/a&gt;. Taking refuge in the mine, she believed it was the location of ancient artifacts. She sealed the entrance and started to send an army to attack the village. The unprepared villager retreated to a hill outside. There most successful campaign came at &lt;a href=\"Glenbrook%20Homestead\"&gt;Glenbrook Homestead&lt;/a&gt;. A recruit from the village by the name of &lt;a href=\"Mary%20Hayes\"&gt;Mary Hayes&lt;/a&gt;, managed to recruit the rest. She lured the men in the woods and stole their hearts. Once she was done, she left the place abandoned. &lt;a href=\"Sister%20Westwood\"&gt;Sister Westwood&lt;/a&gt; was sent to &lt;a href=\"Barrowknoll%20Cemetery\"&gt;Barrowknoll Cemetery&lt;/a&gt; where she bound the local spirits to her whim and began to place their souls into wickermen. Several witches went to &lt;a href=\"Gol%20Koval\"&gt;Gol Koval&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gol%20Osigr\"&gt;Gol Osigr&lt;/a&gt; to reanimate the &lt;a href=\"Drust%20construct\"&gt;Drust construct&lt;/a&gt;s in the area. A witch went to &lt;a href=\"Carver%27s%20Harbor\"&gt;Carver's Harbor&lt;/a&gt;, where she turned the local butchers into pigs and corrupted &lt;a href=\"Roland%20Hacksaw\"&gt;Roland Hacksaw&lt;/a&gt; to keep on making sausages. The witch &lt;a href=\"Helena%20Gentle\"&gt;Helena Gentle&lt;/a&gt; went to &lt;a href=\"Fallhaven\"&gt;Fallhaven&lt;/a&gt; to corrupt the local residents. She made their animals aggressive, their harvest fail and she froze them in time for all eternity. Another regiment went to the &lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Forest\"&gt;Crimson Forest&lt;/a&gt;, where they initiated the ritual to bring &lt;a href=\"Gorak%20Tul\"&gt;Gorak Tul&lt;/a&gt; back.\nAt the same time, a segment of the Waycrest Guard defected to the Coven. Led by &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Goodspeed\"&gt;Captain Goodspeed&lt;/a&gt;, the troops willing joined the Coven in exchange for power.\nAn adventurer, the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; emissary, would arrive to stand against the Coven. They would deal with all the situations mentioned above, including repelling an ambush at &lt;a href=\"Hangman%27s%20Point\"&gt;Hangman's Point&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Sister%20Widdowson\"&gt;Sister Widdowson&lt;/a&gt;. Along with &lt;a href=\"Lucille%20Waycrest\"&gt;Lucille Waycrest&lt;/a&gt;, who realized that the Coven was using Drust death magic, the two would recreate the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20Embers\"&gt;Order of Embers&lt;/a&gt; to fight against the Coven. They even tried to stop the return of the Drust king but failed.\nWith the Coven on the run, the Order of Embers charged to &lt;a href=\"Waycrest%20Manor\"&gt;Waycrest Manor&lt;/a&gt;. Arriving at the foothill, they are confronted by Meredith, who corrupts &lt;a href=\"Marshal%20Everit%20Reade\"&gt;Marshal Everit Reade&lt;/a&gt; before fleeing to the Manor.\nThey also are known to have rejected &lt;a href=\"Emily%20Mayville\"&gt;Emily Mayville&lt;/a&gt; for being weak.\nIn the end, Lady Waycrest was merely a vessel for Gorak Tul's power, and her death opened the &lt;a href=\"Rupture%20%28Waycrest%20Manor%29\"&gt;Rupture&lt;/a&gt;, the doorway for the Drust to enter Azeroth. At the Rupture Gorak Tul was able to raise his people from the dead, but he was slain nonetheless. However, upon his death Gorak Tul revealed that it was only a vessel and he still existed in the Blighted Lands. Even so, the Heartsbane Coven was broken and Drustvar was released from Gorak Tul's power.\nOutside of Drustvar, &lt;a href=\"Petula%20Algerson\"&gt;Petula Algerson&lt;/a&gt; turned to witchcraft in order to punish her husband, and used her powers to overrun the &lt;a href=\"Algerson%20Lumber%20Yard\"&gt;Algerson Lumber Yard&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"wicker%20construct\"&gt;wicker construct&lt;/a&gt;s and spiders. She was subsequently taken care of."}

Masters of magic and communing with the spirits, these respected bastions of knowledge stand upon fifteen millennia worth of accumulated knowledge. The highest of these have a seat on the Zanchuli Council, which both advises the King and ensures his every command is executed upon. The council is consulted before every battle or major decision. Empowered by the Zandalari gods themselves to act as his voice, &lt;a href=\"Rastakhan\"&gt;King Rastakhan&lt;/a&gt; ruled for over two hundred years. \nOne of the most respected of these was &lt;a href=\"Zul\"&gt;Zul&lt;/a&gt;. Even as a child his dark and terrible visions had come true down to the last horrifying detail. He commanded fear and respect as one of the dark prophets: seers capable of witnessing great tragedies before they come to pass. He advised the council and the king to unite with the other troll tribes and to abandon their doomed homeland. Despite Zul's infamy, the council refused to believe in the scope of the disaster to come. Many felt that Zul was grandstanding to increase his own status and power. They scoffed as he and his followers began assembling a war fleet and reaching out to the lesser troll races. But Zul's vision were visions of the truth. &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; rocked &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt; to its foundation.

The Zandalari people turned to their King for help, but there was only one Zandalari equipped to help them: The prophet Zul.\nLong ago it was decided that the &lt;a href=\"dire%20troll\"&gt;dire troll&lt;/a&gt;s should always have a seat on the Zanchuli Council, to ensure that those specials needs of the elite warriors were met by the government, and to provide the wisdom of war to those councilors who may seldom see a battlefront. &lt;a href=\"General%20Jakra%27zet\"&gt;General Jakra'zet&lt;/a&gt;, who had proven himself in Zul's campaign in &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, was the first non-Zandalari troll to be on the council.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nAll members but &lt;a href=\"Wardruid%20Loti\"&gt;Wardruid Loti&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hexlord%20Raal\"&gt;Hexlord Raal&lt;/a&gt; betray Rastakhan and side with Zul, seeking to recreate the &lt;a href=\"Empire%20of%20Zul\"&gt;ancient troll empire&lt;/a&gt; with a revived &lt;a href=\"Dazar\"&gt;Dazar&lt;/a&gt; at its head instead of Rastakhan. &lt;a href=\"Vol%27kaal\"&gt;Vol'kaal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Yazma\"&gt;Yazma&lt;/a&gt; are killed at &lt;a href=\"Atal%27Dazar\"&gt;Atal'Dazar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"General%20Jakra%27zet\"&gt;General Jakra'zet&lt;/a&gt; dies in &lt;a href=\"Vol%27dun\"&gt;Vol'dun&lt;/a&gt; while resurrecting &lt;a href=\"Mythrax%20the%20Unraveler\"&gt;Mythrax the Unraveler&lt;/a&gt;, and Zul himself is killed by Rastakhan during Mythrax's attack on &lt;a href=\"Dazar%27alor\"&gt;Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt;, though he is resurrected by his new master, &lt;a href=\"G%27huun\"&gt;G'huun&lt;/a&gt;, and then killed again in the halls of &lt;a href=\"Uldir\"&gt;Uldir&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Dazar%27alor\"&gt;Battle of Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt;, Rastakhan was killed by the Alliance and &lt;a href=\"Talanji\"&gt;Talanji&lt;/a&gt; became queen of the Zandalari. She created a new Zanchuli Council, where Loti and Raal were joined by &lt;a href=\"Jo%27nok%2C%20Bulwark%20of%20Torcali\"&gt;Jo'nok, Bulwark of Torcali&lt;/a&gt; (replacing Vol'kaal), &lt;a href=\"High%20Prelate%20Rata\"&gt;High Prelate Rata&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rakera\"&gt;General Rakera&lt;/a&gt; (replacing Jakra'zet), and &lt;a href=\"Lashk\"&gt;Lashk&lt;/a&gt;, the first &lt;a href=\"tortollan\"&gt;tortollan&lt;/a&gt; to sit on the Council.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the Zanchuli Council investigated families who were tied to the traitor &lt;a href=\"Yazma\"&gt;Yazma&lt;/a&gt;. They found &lt;a href=\"Bezime\"&gt;Bezime&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Nav%27rae\"&gt;family&lt;/a&gt; cleared of any wrongdoing. They later advised &lt;a href=\"Talanji\"&gt;Queen Talanji&lt;/a&gt; with dealing with the &lt;a href=\"Widow%27s%20Bite\"&gt;Widow's Bite&lt;/a&gt;."}

Originally a chain of mountains on the continent of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor%20%28landmass%29\"&gt;Ancient Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, it became an island following the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt; caused by the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Empire\"&gt;Zandalari Empire&lt;/a&gt; survived and kept seeking to influence troll and world affairs.\nWith the advent of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the island was thrown into chaos, as large sections of its capital were lost to the sea and the jungle of &lt;a href=\"Nazmir\"&gt;Nazmir&lt;/a&gt; began to sink, transforming it into a swamp. This would lead the Zandalari followers of &lt;a href=\"Zul\"&gt;Zul&lt;/a&gt; to attempt to forge a new nation in other parts of the world to escape their home which they believed doomed, but they were largely unsuccessful. Not as strong as in times past, beset by internal troubles within Zandalar itself, and amidst another war with the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, the trolls of Zandalar now seek fresh allies, setting the ancient island up as a major theater for the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;. \nHistory.\nAncient times.\nOriginally, \"Zandalar\" was the name given to a holy mountain range in southern &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor%20%28landmass%29\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, where many &lt;a href=\"Wild%20God\"&gt;Wild God&lt;/a&gt;s (referred to by the trolls as \"&lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt;\") dwelled. As the trolls revered and worshiped these loa, they soon built small encampments on the slopes of the Zandalar Mountains. Nearly all of the tallest plateaus were claimed by the most powerful group of trolls, the &lt;a href=\"Zandalar%20tribe\"&gt;Zandalar tribe&lt;/a&gt;. Atop Zandalar's highest peaks, the Zandalari constructed a small cluster of crude shrines, that would later come to grow into a bustling temple city known as &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt;. This series of giant ziggurats looked like a towering mountain from a distance. During the &lt;a href=\"Aqir%20and%20Troll%20War\"&gt;Aqir and Troll War&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt;' forces would assault the Zandalar Mountains.\nWhen the first &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; imploded, a hole was punched through Kalimdor. Deep fissures appeared in the continent, and the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; hastily cast strong protective spells to protect their home from destruction. Even so, they could not shield the rest of the continent from widespread upheaval. The ground immediately beyond the Zandalari's shield was drawn underwater when Kalimdor broke into separate landmasses. When at last the Sundering was over, the Zandalari saw that their home had become an island.\nAt some point, a &lt;a href=\"plague%20of%20corrupted%20blood\"&gt;plague of corrupted blood&lt;/a&gt; broke out on Zandalar, after a foolish troll tried to summon &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20the%20Soulflayer\"&gt;Hakkar the Soulflayer&lt;/a&gt; on the island. After the great plague, there were still those who clung to the magics of the blood god. They tested their magics and perfected them. One such relic was a &lt;a href=\"%3ASanguinating%20Totem\"&gt;:Sanguinating Totem&lt;/a&gt;, capable of draining the life and blood from enemies and infusing the caster with it, altering them in unusual ways. This was the dawn of who the Zandalari call, \"the &lt;a href=\"blood%20troll\"&gt;blood troll&lt;/a&gt;s\".\nRecent times.\n&lt;a href=\"Rastakhan\"&gt;King Rastakhan&lt;/a&gt; rules the island from a great, golden palace. Different troll tribes distrust one another and have often fought one another, but every six years, envoys from all the troll tribes arrive in Zuldazar in order to share information and discuss matters that may affect the entire troll race.\nCataclysm.\nZandalar has been severely crippled by the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, causing King Rastakhan's &lt;a href=\"Dazar%27alor\"&gt;palace&lt;/a&gt; to list to one side, the spine of the land to split in two, a fissure to open in the floor of the forum, and the region of the island called &lt;a href=\"Nazmir\"&gt;Nazmir&lt;/a&gt; as well as other areas of the island to begin sinking beneath the waves. But though Zandalar was indeed damaged, it did not sink as Zul predicted. While Zul and the Golden Fleet left Zandalar, those that stayed behind endured and rebuilt. This also explains the desperate measures the Zandalari have taken, by issuing the call to scattered troll populations of Azeroth as well as their wish to reunite with the &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; and claim &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; as their own.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nRecently, the Horde have come to Zandalar to seek alliances as a result of another war with the Alliance. The Zandalari have to deal with the &lt;a href=\"blood%20troll\"&gt;blood troll&lt;/a&gt;s attacking them from the sinking region of Nazmir, as well as a civil war between Zul's followers and Rastakhan's followers.\nShadows Rising.\nThe Alliance ceded all their outposts and footholds on Zandalar after the armistice between the Horde and the Alliance was signed, leaving the island.\nGeography.\nZandalar is a large tropical island located in the &lt;a href=\"South%20Seas\"&gt;South Seas&lt;/a&gt;, between the &lt;a href=\"Maelstrom\"&gt;Maelstrom&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;. It's a vast region with jungles, swamps, and deserts.\nZones.\nZandalar is separated into three regions. All zones are scaled to the player's level up to 50.\nIn the RPG.\nZandalar is a sizeable island in the &lt;a href=\"South%20Seas\"&gt;South Seas&lt;/a&gt;, to the southwest of &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28continent%29\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. On this island live &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s \u2014 thousands upon thousands of trolls. It is understandably a difficult place to visit for anyone who isn't a troll. Two huge mountains rise from its green canopy; one of these mountains is, in fact, the great ziggurat-city &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt;, while the other is the snowy &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Mugamba\"&gt;Mount Mugamba&lt;/a&gt;. Other, smaller ziggurats \u2014 the domains of troll &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"witch%20doctor\"&gt;witch doctor&lt;/a&gt;s \u2014 also jut from the jungle, and birds and stranger beasts fly it above and among the trees. Troll priests and witch doctors live all over the island. It is a lush and tropical place, and a deadly one.\nCulture.\nTrolls dominate Zandalar, including all known trolls, from &lt;a href=\"Jungle%20troll\"&gt;jungle&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Ice%20troll\"&gt;ice&lt;/a&gt;, which consider Zandalar their homeland. It is neutral territory for their kind, so trolls don't battle each other when are on Zandalar. The same courtesy doesn't extend toward other races, though, and Zandalar's trolls are a wicked and &lt;a href=\"voodoo\"&gt;voodoo&lt;/a&gt;-worshiping bunch who delight in slaying their enemies and devouring their remains. As such, not even &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; merchants are safe on this island, and visitors face stalking, axe - and spear-wielding danger from every green shadow.\nMost of the native trolls here are jungle trolls, though ice trolls live atop Mount Mugamba's snowy peak. The trolls here are bigger, stronger and nastier than all other trolls (well almost\u2014the &lt;a href=\"Drakkari\"&gt;Drakkari&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; are a bit bigger). &lt;a href=\"King%20Rastakhan\"&gt;King Rastakhan&lt;/a&gt;, an ancient and formidable witch doctor and keeper of troll lore, rules from Zuldazar. Trolls often have trouble working with each other, despite the conferences on Zandalar.\nGeography.\nZandalar is a tropical and lush island. &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Mugamba\"&gt;Mount Mugamba&lt;/a&gt; is by far the highest peak on the island, rising from its center. Troll ziggurats, the domains of troll &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;s, priests and witch doctors, are scattered throughout the jungle, as are troll totems and huts.\nZandalar boasts impressive wildlife as well and is a prime hunting ground.

They came to Yojamba Isle in an effort to recruit help against the resurrected &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20the%20Soulflayer\"&gt;Blood God&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Atal%27ai\"&gt;Atal'ai&lt;/a&gt; priests in &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Gurub\"&gt;Zul'Gurub&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Atal%27Hakkar\"&gt;Temple of Atal'Hakkar&lt;/a&gt;. With the Gurubashi trolls destroyed and the Blood God no longer an issue, most Zandalari trolls have returned back to their homeland &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;, leaving &lt;a href=\"Yojamba%20Isle\"&gt;Yojamba Isle&lt;/a&gt; empty. Exalted reputation with this faction was made a Feat of Strength.\nHistory.\nFrom: &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/basics/factions/zandalar/\"&gt;Zandalar Tribe&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.worldofwarcraft.com/\"&gt;Official site&lt;/a&gt;:\nTens of thousands of years ago, two great troll empires appeared: the Amani and the Gurubashi. The Amani were forest trolls and the Gurubashi were jungle trolls; Amani and Gurubashi were the names of the two largest and most powerful troll tribes, which is why the empires received their names. These early empires eventually clashed with the nascent night elves. Drawing arcane magic from the Well of Eternity, the night elves shocked the trolls by handing them a rapid and resounding defeat. The night elves pushed the trolls out of some of their lands and were then able to establish the night elf empire.\nOne tribe of trolls in these ancient days was the Zandalar tribe \u2014 the progenitor tribe from which all other trolls arose. Most Zandalari were scholarly and valued knowledge; however, a significant portion desired conquest instead. These disaffected trolls eventually left the Zandalari to found other tribes. The remaining Zandalari, then, were all of the scholarly and mystical bent. As time went on, other trolls came to regard them as an overarching priest caste for all trolls. The Zandalari preserved troll history, and they worked to further the goals of troll society as a whole.\nThough they had the respect and admiration of all other trolls, the Zandalari did not attempt to exert any power over them. They averaged (and still average) 8 feet in height: significantly larger than all other trolls save the savage Drakkari of the far north. Despite their greater size and knowledge and the respect they commanded, the Zandalari did not wield sovereignty over the other trolls, nor did they seek such authority.\nWhen the Sundering came, the wise Zandalari trolls wove swift magics to protect their realm. The land around their territory shuddered; waves crashed in and trees and soil sank beneath the waves. Through it all, the Zandalari\u2019s land remained largely intact. After the Sundering, the Zandalari discovered that their territory was now an island. Seeing no reason to leave it, they set about rebuilding their settlements and continuing their studies.\nEventually the Zandalari noticed that their Gurubashi brethren on the mainland were growing rapidly in power and territory, attributing their victories to the influence of the god Hakkar. At first, the Zandalari were glad for the fellow trolls. However, as Zul\u2019Gurub continued to expand, the Zandalari\u2019s pleased surprise turned to disquiet. They consulted myths and delved into historical accounts. What they learned horrified them.\nHakkar was also known as the \u201cSoulflayer\u201d, a name he had richly earned. He filled his adherents with murderous rage and reveled in their dark emotions. The carnage that invariably followed Hakkar suited him perfectly, for having consumed blood he had developed a taste for it. Worse, he became more powerful as he consumed the blood shed in his name, and his tie to the world that was feeding him grew stronger.\nEvery Zandalari who could fight immediately set out for Stranglethorn Vale and brought the terrible tidings to the jungle trolls. The Gurubashi empire was already in a state of civil unrest due to the numerous sacrifices that Hakkar was demanding. With the Zandalar tribe\u2019s news, the jungle trolls banded together with the Zandalar tribe and rose up in open revolt against the bloodthirsty Soulflayer.\nRewards.\nThere are also unique head and leg &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Gurub%20Enchants\"&gt;Zul'Gurub Enchants&lt;/a&gt; which require a reputation.\nUpon reaching a reputation, you can receive a &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Gurub%20Amulet\"&gt;neck slot item&lt;/a&gt; (as well as some gold and rep), e.g. the &lt;a href=\"Maelstrom%27s%20Tendril\"&gt;Maelstrom's Tendril&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Falthir%20the%20Sightless\"&gt;Falthir the Sightless&lt;/a&gt;. You can upgrade these items as your reputation improves.\nThere is also a class-specific &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Gurub%20Trinket\"&gt;Zul'Gurub Trinket&lt;/a&gt; by defeating the 4 &lt;a href=\"Edge%20of%20Madness\"&gt;Edge of Madness&lt;/a&gt; mini-bosses and collecting each of their quest items. Which of the 4 bosses that spawns is not random and instead based on a complicated Spawn Calendar. Because of this, it will take a minimum of 1 month for all 4 bosses to spawn."}

While the &lt;a href=\"Loa%20Speaker%20%28Isle%20of%20Thunder%29\"&gt;Loa Speaker&lt;/a&gt;s infuse beasts with the power of the &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt;, similarly to how they empower their weaponry. On the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Giants\"&gt;Isle of Giants&lt;/a&gt;, the Beast Ward raised mighty beasts as engines of war.\nThe Zandalari use a series of fetishes and charms to maintain their control over their menagerie of beasts. Due to the need for &lt;a href=\"raptor\"&gt;raptor&lt;/a&gt;s in war and the limited time that they have, the Zandalari have awakened the \"old ways\" and turned to taking the blood of the raptors and binding their essence to fetishes.\nSome of the most skilled beast tamers in the Zandalari military can be found in the &lt;a href=\"Beast%20Pens\"&gt;Beast Pens&lt;/a&gt;, where they build their cavalry. They are trained to kill with axe, beast, and claw.\nSome Zandalari beastlords carry spears that serve as scrimshaws, with tips carved from the rack of a &lt;a href=\"direhorn\"&gt;direhorn&lt;/a&gt;'s skull."}

It is located on the island of &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;, formerly a mountain range where the first trolls settled around over 16,000 years ago. The most powerful tribe inhabited the highest peaks of the mountains, and called themselves Zandalari. Now the oldest-lasting empire on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, having been around for at least over 16,000 years, they possess one of the most powerful navies in existence, one that is unmatched on the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nAncient history.\nThe early trolls gathered around a mountain range in southern &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor%20%28landmass%29\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, where many &lt;a href=\"Wild%20God\"&gt;Wild God&lt;/a&gt;s, which they called &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt;, dwelled. They named the mountain range &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;, and built small encampments upon its slopes. In these old days, before trolls gathered in great cities, the &lt;a href=\"shadow%20hunter\"&gt;shadow hunter&lt;/a&gt;s were the leaders of the small tribes. As cities grew and the Zandalari grew in power, the shadow hunters' influence was lessened, but the position is still highly respected. &lt;a href=\"Dazar\"&gt;Dazar&lt;/a&gt; was the founder and first King of Zandalar, who led an exodus of his people out of the muck and mire and built a city of gold. It is implied that the heart of their civilization was originally &lt;a href=\"Nazmir\"&gt;Nazmir&lt;/a&gt; with the city of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Nazman\"&gt;Zul'Nazman&lt;/a&gt;, but they moved south into the mountains to avoid &lt;a href=\"G%27huun\"&gt;G'huun&lt;/a&gt;. The most powerful group of trolls was called the Zandalar tribe, who claimed the Zandalar Mountains' highest plateaus. They built a small cluster of crude shrines that in time grew into the bustling temple city of &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt;. And Dazar united the tribes into the empire.\nTheir society was built heavily on a caste system, and as time went on those castes evolved into their own people. Most Zandalari were scholarly and valued knowledge, but a significant portion desired conquest instead. Over the next several centuries, these disaffected trolls left the Zandalari to found other tribes. The scholarly Zandalari were content to see them go, they saw them as children who would see the folly of youthful rebellion and come back begging for Zandalari approval. However, the trolls would not return.\nTwo main empires were the &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;forest troll&lt;/a&gt; nation of the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20Empire\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"jungle%20troll\"&gt;jungle troll&lt;/a&gt; nation of the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20Empire\"&gt;Gurubashi&lt;/a&gt;, who challenged one another for territory and power. Other empires co-existed with them, whose focus was not to climb any further in power at the time: the &lt;a href=\"ice%20troll\"&gt;ice troll&lt;/a&gt; nation of the &lt;a href=\"Drakkari%20Empire\"&gt;Drakkari&lt;/a&gt; and the progenitor nation of them all, the Zandalari.\nAs time went on, other trolls came to regard the Zandalari as an overarching priest caste for all trolls. The Zandalari preserved troll history, and they worked to further the goals of troll society as a whole. Though they had the respect and admiration of all other trolls, the Zandalari did not wield sovereignty over the other trolls, nor did they seek such authority.\nThe Aqir and Troll War.\nOnly one place was forbidden by Zandalari's witch doctors and priests: a small mound of blackened stone at the base of the Zandalar Mountains. The loa warned the tribes' mystics of severe consequences should they disturb the black stones. For many years, none of the trolls dared disobey. But curiosity eventually won out, and 16,000 years ago a group of rebellious trolls led by the Gurubashi exile &lt;a href=\"Zan%27do\"&gt;Zan'do&lt;/a&gt; plumbed the forbidden mound. They discovered that the black stones were not mere rocks - they were the jagged hide of a monstrous creature. The trolls believed it to be an undiscovered loa, and a powerful one at that, considering that the other loa were frightened by it. The trolls performed vile rituals and living sacrifices to awaken the slumbering monstrosity.\nRoused by the blood offerings, the gigantic &lt;a href=\"C%27Thrax\"&gt;C'Thrax&lt;/a&gt;xi &lt;a href=\"General%20%28rank%29\"&gt;general&lt;/a&gt; known as &lt;a href=\"Kith%27ix\"&gt;Kith'ix&lt;/a&gt; emerged from its long slumber and slaughtered all those who had revived it. The ancient loa had in fact buried Kith'ix in ancient times when it collapsed before the Zandalar Mountains, fleeing, gravely wounded, from the fight it had with &lt;a href=\"Keeper\"&gt;Keeper&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tyr\"&gt;Tyr&lt;/a&gt;. Kith'ix, fully awakened, knew it would delight the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s to see this pitiful civilization rent to ashes. It reached out with its mind and took control of the &lt;a href=\"aqir\"&gt;aqir&lt;/a&gt; dwelling underground. The aqiri swarms began building a vast subterranean &lt;a href=\"empire\"&gt;empire&lt;/a&gt; known as &lt;a href=\"Azj%27Aqir\"&gt;Azj'Aqir&lt;/a&gt;, and when they had swollen enough in number, the C'Thrax led them to make war against the trolls.\nThe aqiri threat was unlike any the trolls had ever faced. Numerous smaller tribes fell before them. As they got dangerously close to the Zandalar Mountains, the Zandalari moved to act. They united the disparate troll tribes into a single mighty force, which they called the &lt;a href=\"Empire%20of%20Zul\"&gt;Empire of Zul&lt;/a&gt;. Its members would put aside their differences and work together to destroy the aqir.\nThe Zandalari took on the role of commanding the troll armies. With their temple city looming high in the mountains, they could detect enemy movements and direct attacks at weak points. Under their guidance, the other trolls used ambush tactics to whittle down the enemy's numbers in the surrounding jungles. Elsewhere, revered priests summoned the loa to assail their enemies, and they would join the troll warriors in battle, ripping through the aqiri ranks and even wounding Kith'ix.\nThe aqir were forced to retreat before they could mount a proper siege on the sacred mountains. Kith'ix, gravely wounded by the loa, fled to the northeast. The Zandalari knew that their enemy still posed a grave threat, as it would attack outlying troll territories. At the Zandalari's behest, the other tribes moved out to hunt down the aqir. The trolls quickly learned it was not enough to simply kill the insectoids: if any aqir escaped underground, they would establish a new colony and rise up again later. To permanently end the threat, no corner of the continent could be left unguarded. The Zandalari thus convinced the most power-hungry troll factions to establish new strongholds across Azeroth. Chief among these groups were the Amani, Gurubashi, and Drakkari. After defeating the aqir, they could claim the fertile new lands for themselves, without any competition.\nAnd so the Drakkari pushed into the frigid north, but they faced unexpected resistance in the form of corrupted tol'vir, who had been enthralled by the aqir. The &lt;a href=\"obsidian%20destroyer\"&gt;obsidian destroyer&lt;/a&gt;s almost overpowered the Drakkari, but they devised brilliant ways to topple and shatter their foes.\nThe Gurubashi also encountered corrupted titan-forged in the southwest, where the aqir had overrun &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt;, in the form of enslaved &lt;a href=\"anubisath\"&gt;anubisath&lt;/a&gt; giants. They slaughtered several large Gurubashi encampments. The Zandalari instructed Gurubashi priests to separate their tribe into smaller, more mobile raiding groups instead of large armies, allowing them to bleed their enemies dry and win.\nMeanwhile, the Amani had set out to destroy Kith'ix and tracked its trail to the northeastern woodlands. In a suicidal attack against the C'Thrax, they defeated Kith'ix, and only a tiny fraction of the troll army survived. They became legend among the trolls and established a temple city known as Zul'Aman.\nAfter many centuries of brutal fighting, the trolls shattered the aqir empire. Without war to bind them together, the troll factions grew ever more distant and insular. The tribes eventually grew into empires in their own right, and the Zandalari withdrew to their mountain plateaus to pursue spiritual knowledge, but they would always maintain an immense influence of the disparate troll societies.\nThe mogu and pandaren.\nBetween 15,000 and 12,000 years ago, &lt;a href=\"Zulathra\"&gt;Zulathra&lt;/a&gt;, a high priest of the Zandalari, proposed to the &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; Emperor &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen\"&gt;Lei Shen&lt;/a&gt; an exchange of each other's secrets; the mogu's &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; power for the trolls' knowledge of the lands beyond the vale. Together, the two empires would be unstoppable. They should have destroyed each other, but they understood that in a war, pitting strength against strength, the survivor would be weakened and might even succumb to creatures far weaker than it. That would be a tragedy that neither race wanted. With back firmly set against back, mogu and trolls carved out their positions in the world.\nBoth the mogu and Zandalari held contempt for one another. The Zandalari thought themselves above the mogu for two reasons: the presence of the &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt;, and that the Zandalari did not use slaves as the mogu did. The mutual contempt between the two would grow to polite indifference. They trusted the other not to attack because they were confident they would defeat the other. While Zandalari and mogu stood back to back, they did not watch the other and did not see the other falter.\n12,200 years before the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, Lei Shen sought to claim the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Origination\"&gt;Forge of Origination&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Uldum\"&gt;Uldum&lt;/a&gt;. Its &lt;a href=\"tol%27vir\"&gt;tol'vir&lt;/a&gt; guardians were to become honored members of the mogu empire under his leadership. However, the tol'vir became furious upon learning that Lei Shen had betrayed &lt;a href=\"Highkeeper%20Ra\"&gt;Highkeeper Ra&lt;/a&gt; and refused. The mogu army marched on Uldum accompanied by their troll allies. The tol'vir could not resist them and instead configured the Forge of Origination to purge the area around Uldum of almost all life. The death of the Thunder King and most of the Zandalari leadership (including Zulathra, whose life had been artificially extended by Lei Shen) left massive power vacuums, striking a mortal blow to both empires.\n300 years later, after the &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; revolted against the mogu, a great debate raged within the Zandalari capital of Zuldazar as to how to acquire a large plot of land that the Zandalari had been promised by their mogu allies. A descendant of the great high priest Zulathra, &lt;a href=\"Mengazi\"&gt;Mengazi&lt;/a&gt;, convinced the other Zandalari that the best course of action was to take the territory by force, as the pandaren and their allies were unlikely to honor an agreement made by their cruel former masters. And so the Zandalari marched south into &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, beginning the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Troll%20Wars\"&gt;Zandalari Troll Wars&lt;/a&gt;.\nOvercoming this threat was to be one of the &lt;a href=\"Pandaren%20Empire\"&gt;Pandaren Empire&lt;/a&gt;'s first tests of strength, but through tenacity, diplomacy, and a unique form of unarmed combat, the pandaren staged a successful revolution that deposed their tyrants and established an empire that would prosper for thousands of years. Imbued with mystic powers and riding great dinosaur war mounts, the Zandalari at first met with little resistance by the pandaren. The tide of war only turned when &lt;a href=\"Jiang\"&gt;Jiang&lt;/a&gt; formed the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Cloud%20Serpent\"&gt;Order of the Cloud Serpent&lt;/a&gt; by teaching her fellow pandaren how to tame and ride the powerful &lt;a href=\"cloud%20serpent\"&gt;cloud serpent&lt;/a&gt;s, thus giving the pandaren a counter to the Zandalari's airborne &lt;a href=\"Pterrordax\"&gt;pterrorwing&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Bat\"&gt;batrider&lt;/a&gt;s. The trolls realized they could not win by conventional means, so Mengazi turned to one final tactic: resurrecting Lei Shen. However, the trolls' efforts to resurrect the Thunder King from his resting place in the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Conquerors\"&gt;Tomb of Conquerors&lt;/a&gt; were thwarted by the serpent riders, as Jiang sacrificed herself in a final, desperate attack, killing Mengazi. The other Zandalari soon broke ranks and fled back to Zandalar in shame, ending the war. Despite being defeated and pushed from the island now called Pandaria, the Zandalari, just like the mogu, remained in Pandaren lore, and slowly turned into \"bogeymen\".\n&lt;a href=\"Taran%20Zhu\"&gt;Taran Zhu&lt;/a&gt; theorized that humans and possibly even some Zandalari may have sided with the Pandaren in the &lt;a href=\"Pandaren%20revolution\"&gt;pandaren rebellion&lt;/a&gt; 12,000 years ago. When Vol'jin pointed out the attitude of the Zandalari and the uncivilized humans at that time, Taran Zhu explained that there are some exceptions in every race.\nThe night elves and the Sundering.\nIn the millennia that followed the founding of the empire, the troll race continued to maintain control over much of the continent of Ancient Kalimdor. This changed, however, when a new race known as the &lt;a href=\"kaldorei\"&gt;kaldorei&lt;/a&gt; emerged near the waters of the mystical &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;. Although originally evolved from trolls (greatly influenced by their proximity to the well) the kaldorei, or night elves, bore very little resemblance at all to the other ancient race. Physically, they were much more sleek and elegant, but culturally they had adopted their own traditions. They adopted new religious beliefs and quickly established their own civilization in the center of Kalimdor. The night elves, highly intelligent and able to harness the innate magical forces of the world, began to forge their own empire completely independent of their troll ancestors. \nDespite the size and glory of the mighty Empire of Zul, despite its vast temple cities and rich culture, it was utterly eclipsed by the rapid expansion and development of the glorious &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Empire\"&gt;Kaldorei Empire&lt;/a&gt;. In an ensuing golden age, the night elves expanded across the entire continent, driving the other races, including the trolls, farther away. At this point, the Empire of Zul was a shadow of its former self, devoid of the unity and energy it possessed when it warred with the aqir. Eventually, under the fantastic reign of the kaldorei monarch known as &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt;, the two empires came into direct conflict. Of all the threats that the kaldorei encountered during the expansion of their empire, only the trolls had drawn their full attention. \nSporadic battles soon broke out between the two sides in the south and although what remained of the Empire of Zul fought ferociously to defend their lands, they were simply unable to resist the power of the night elves' sorcery. Their armies buckled under the onslaught and they found themselves unable to prevail against their elven foes. Azshara, however, had no interest in controlling the trolls' lands and so an accord was reached between the kaldorei and the Zandalari tribe, ever the leaders of the troll race. In exchange for a strict end to all troll incursions and expansion near night elf territory, they would\u2014by Azshara's grace\u2014be permitted to remain in possession of their sacred mountain ranges to the south. Though the terms were extremely uneven and humiliating for the trolls, they had no choice but to acquiesce. The shame of this agreement would sow the seeds of resentment among all trolls for thousands of years to come. Even in the modern day, the inherent troll resentment of elves can be attributed to these events.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt; came, the wise Zandalari trolls wove swift magics to protect their realm. The land around their territory shuddered; waves crashed in and trees and soil sank beneath the waves. Through it all, the Zandalari's land remained largely intact. After the Sundering, the Zandalari discovered that their territory was now an island. Seeing no reason to leave it, they set about rebuilding their settlements and continuing their studies. They adapted to island life, and over thousands of years, learned how to master the seas.\nAfter the Sundering, the Zandalari started exploring numerous islands that dotted the newly formed &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt;. During one of these trips, they discovered &lt;a href=\"Kezan\"&gt;Kezan&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; race, who were very primitive but still possessed some intellect. Initially, the two races kept a distance as the Zandalari only came to the island in order to mine the rare mineral &lt;a href=\"kaja%27mite\"&gt;kaja'mite&lt;/a&gt;. While the trolls didn't know too much about it, they realized that it was very potent, and used it as a sacred component in their rituals and ceremonies. For many centuries the trolls mined and occasionally even paid goblins in trinkets in order to work for them, but this arrangement was soon to change. At some point the trolls, while digging, discovered that Kezan possessed an unimaginable deposit of kaja'mite underground, more than they would ever need. So rather than digging themselves, they enslaved the goblins and force them to drill in terrible conditions. For thousands of years the goblins, too weak to resist, suffered under the rule of the Zandalari, and the island was considered a part of the Zandalar Empire.\nThe Council of Tribes.\nThere was once a time when no single emperor could rule Zandalar. After a period of civil war, the heads of three families formed an uneasy coalition and tried to rule the empire together: the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Tribes\"&gt;Council of Tribes&lt;/a&gt;. Though they did not often agree, there was peace in Zandalar. Briefly.\nDuring the final era of the Council of Tribes, a &lt;a href=\"plague%20of%20corrupted%20blood\"&gt;blood plague&lt;/a&gt; broke out, when a foolish troll tried to summon &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20the%20Soulflayer\"&gt;Hakkar the Soulflayer&lt;/a&gt; to the island of &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;, killing thousands of trolls. It was deemed that the bodies, too polluted for proper burial, would instead be handled by golems, burned, and kept in special urns. As time progressed, this method became commonplace among the Zandalari in disposing of their dead.\nThis marked the end of the caste whose purpose was to handle and protect the remains of Zandalar's former rulers. \nAfter the great plague, there were still those who clung to the magics of the &lt;a href=\"G%27huun\"&gt;blood god&lt;/a&gt;. They tested their magics and perfected them. One such relic was a totem, which when concentrated upon, would drain not just the life from their enemies, but also their blood, infusing the caster with it and altering them in unusual ways. This was the dawn of who the Zandalari call, \"the &lt;a href=\"blood%20troll\"&gt;blood troll&lt;/a&gt;s\".\nThe Troll Wars.\nThousands of years after the Sundering, 2,800 years before the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; was opened, the Zandalari traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; to help the &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;forest troll&lt;/a&gt;s of Zul'Aman against the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;. In the Amani, the Zandalari saw an opportunity to revitalize one of their race's most powerful tribes and reassert dominance on the Eastern Kingdoms.\nThe Zandalari formed an alliance with the Amani and marshaled their forces for the impending conquest. The Zandalari would ensure that the mighty loa demigods would aid the trolls in battle. To settle the matter of leadership and infighting that had plagued the forest trolls, the Zandalari made one of the Amani's fiercest warriors, &lt;a href=\"Jintha\"&gt;Jintha&lt;/a&gt;, the ruler of his people. Small Amani warbands ventured from Zul'Aman to raid the high elves and test their strength. The cunning trolls hid their true numbers and capabilities; and after several successful attacks, decided that the time for all-out war had finally come. Without warning, tens of thousands of troll fighters exploded from the shadowy forests. Fearsome loa demigods marched alongside the Amani, infusing their adherents with supernatural power. The high elves struggled desperately to hold back the trolls but were forced to give ground. With astonishing speed, the Amani laid waste to the outer reaches of Quel'Thalas. The Zandalari emissaries were pleased by what they saw: even the elves and their potent arcane powers could not withstand the might of the Amani\u2014the might of the troll race.\nEventually, the elves would find help in the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s, whose tribes had been united into the kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Arathor\"&gt;Arathor&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Thoradin\"&gt;Thoradin&lt;/a&gt;. The union of elves and humans ultimately ended in the trolls losing what would come to be known as the &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Wars\"&gt;Troll Wars&lt;/a&gt;, with Jintha and hundreds of troll soldiers dying to a horrific firestorm conjured by the &lt;a href=\"One%20Hundred\"&gt;One Hundred&lt;/a&gt;, the first human mages in history. The disastrous battle floored the Zandalari emissaries. Once so confident of victory, they skulked back to their island home in disbelief and shame. For them, the defeat marked a dark turning point in troll history, one from which their beleaguered race might never recover.\nFirst war against the Soulflayer.\n1,500 years before the opening of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, the Zandalari noticed that their Gurubashi brethren on the mainland were growing rapidly in power and territory, attributing their victories to the influence of the god &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20the%20Soulflayer\"&gt;Hakkar the Soulflayer&lt;/a&gt;. At first, the Zandalari were glad for the fellow trolls. However, as &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Gurub\"&gt;Zul'Gurub&lt;/a&gt; continued to expand, the Zandalari's pleased surprise turned to disquiet. They consulted myths and delved into historical accounts. What they learned horrified them: Hakkar was also known as the \"Soulflayer\", a name he had richly earned. He filled his adherents with murderous rage and reveled in their dark emotions. The carnage that invariably followed Hakkar suited him perfectly, for having consumed blood he had developed a taste for it. Worse, he became more powerful as he consumed the bloodshed in his name, and his tie to the world that was feeding him grew stronger.\nEvery Zandalari who could fight immediately set out for &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt; and brought the terrible tidings to the jungle trolls. They were branded as heretics. Heathens, known as &lt;a href=\"freethinker\"&gt;freethinker&lt;/a&gt;s, dared to challenge the &lt;a href=\"Hakkari\"&gt;priests&lt;/a&gt; of Hakkar and were therefore hunted and killed as vermin. However, those heathens never wavered in their fight against the Blood God. The Gurubashi Empire was already in a state of civil unrest due to the numerous sacrifices that Hakkar was demanding. With the Zandalar tribe's news, the jungle trolls banded together with the Zandalar tribe and rose up in open revolt against the bloodthirsty Soulflayer. The united tribes narrowly defeated the Blood God and cast out the &lt;a href=\"Atal%27ai\"&gt;Atal'ai&lt;/a&gt;. Despite their victory, however, the Gurubashi Empire soon fell.\nShortly after the fall of the Gurubashi, the Zandalar almost succumbed to a final defeat from evil within their own tribe. It was then that the &lt;a href=\"confessor\"&gt;confessor&lt;/a&gt;s amongst them arose, preserving the tribe by banishing out those who would destroy their own kind. In the dark days after the Gurubashi Empire ripped itself up, the &lt;a href=\"augur\"&gt;augur&lt;/a&gt;s led the Zandalari to the tribe's safe haven in the &lt;a href=\"South%20Seas\"&gt;South Seas&lt;/a&gt;. In those dark times, Zandalar &lt;a href=\"Predator%20%28Zandalari%29\"&gt;predators&lt;/a&gt; used their prowess to provide sustenance for the tribe.\nThe goblin rebellion.\nAs the trolls' goblin slaves worked the kaja'mite mines on Kezan, they breathed in the dust of the ore that clouded the mines, over time it began to awake the goblins' dormant intelligence. Secretly they plotted to start a rebellion, gathering any materials they could find and hide in order to create a wide range of weapons, traps, and explosives. One hundred years before the opening of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, the troll overseers were caught completely off guard when the goblin masses stormed out from the mines, armed with technology that the Zandalari couldn't even imagine at the time. The trolls' hold over Kezan was shattered completely, their mining operation failed and the surviving Zandalari fled. The goblins were now free, and in order to celebrate their newfound freedom they turned on each other, creating chaos as countless feuds were waged and alliances formed. Soon enough they were split into various different groups, with the most powerful of these groups known as the &lt;a href=\"Cartel\"&gt;cartels&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlthough they no longer inhabit it, Kezan is still sacred to the Zandalari to this day.\nWrath of the Soulflayer.\nThe Zandalari were shocked to learn of the attempt to summon Hakkar in the &lt;a href=\"Sunken%20Temple\"&gt;Sunken Temple&lt;/a&gt; and believed the loa's return would herald a dark time for trolls. They were pleased to hear that the Atal'ai had been defeated in the temple by the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, but their relief soon turned to horror. Some of Hakkar's adherents survived, and they were continuing their quest. In time, the exiled Atal'ai priests have discovered that Hakkar's physical form can only be summoned within the ancient and once-deserted capital of the Gurubashi Empire, &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Gurub\"&gt;Zul'Gurub&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, the priests have met with success in their quest to call forth Hakkar \u2014 reports confirm the presence of the dreaded Soulflayer in the heart of the ruins.\nAnd so the Zandalar tribe arrived on the shores of Azeroth at &lt;a href=\"Yojamba%20Isle\"&gt;Yojamba Isle&lt;/a&gt; to battle Hakkar once again. But the Blood God had grown increasingly powerful, bending several tribes to his will and even commanded the avatars of the Gurubashi's loa \u2014 &lt;a href=\"Hir%27eek\"&gt;Bat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bethekk\"&gt;Panther&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shirvallah\"&gt;Tiger&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shadra\"&gt;Spider&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Hethiss\"&gt;Snake&lt;/a&gt;. With the tribes splintered, the Zandalari were forced to recruit champions from &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s varied and disparate races to battle the Soulflayer. The champions and their Primal God aspects fed the awesome power of the Soulflayer. Adventurers brave enough to venture into the foreboding ruins had to overcome the High Priests if they were to have any hope of confronting the mighty blood god.\nThe Zandalari knew that they did not have the resources to scour the Atal'ai and their leader, &lt;a href=\"Jin%27do%20the%20Hexxer\"&gt;Jin'do the Hexxer&lt;/a&gt;, from Zul'Gurub. They sent word through the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear tribe&lt;/a&gt; that the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; needed to act immediately for Hakkar being successfully summoned would throw the world into chaos. A large Horde strike force was sent to Zul'Gurub in turn. After the Soulflayer was defeated, &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Hakkar\"&gt;his cursed heart&lt;/a&gt;, the still-burning kernel of Hakkar's power, was brought to &lt;a href=\"Molthor\"&gt;Molthor&lt;/a&gt; in the hope the Zandalari would know how to destroy it. The heart was banished.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, Zandalari trolls traveled to &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Drak\"&gt;Zul'Drak&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, not to help their cousins but to bear witness and record the fall of the &lt;a href=\"Drakkari%20Empire\"&gt;Drakkari Empire&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter they established bases at &lt;a href=\"Zim%27Torga\"&gt;Zim'Torga&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dubra%27Jin\"&gt;Dubra'Jin&lt;/a&gt;, they discovered that the Drakkari were killing their loa to obtain their powers. This was something new; in the recent conflicts at Zul'Aman and Zul'Gurub the loa had been imprisoned, not outright killed. The Zandalari opposed the Drakkari in their efforts to slay their gods, but still did not help them against the Scourge.\nAmong the Zandalari in Zul'Drak was &lt;a href=\"Zul\"&gt;Zul&lt;/a&gt;, a prophet of the &lt;a href=\"Zanchuli%20Council\"&gt;Zanchuli Council&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nWith the Gurubashi trolls and Hakkar no longer an issue, most of the Zandalari in Stranglethorn Vale returned to Zandalar, leaving &lt;a href=\"Yojamba%20Isle\"&gt;Yojamba Isle&lt;/a&gt; empty.\nYears ago, &lt;a href=\"Rastakhan\"&gt;God King Rastakhan&lt;/a&gt;'s most trusted prophet, &lt;a href=\"Zul\"&gt;Zul&lt;/a&gt;, warned him of &lt;a href=\"Shattering\"&gt;a terrible Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;. For Zul had seen a vision of a &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;great armored dragon&lt;/a&gt; clenching the world in his ferocious jaws. Months later Zul returned, bearing more grim news from his visions. He saw a &lt;a href=\"Naga\"&gt;legion of serpents&lt;/a&gt; pouring forth from a gaping fissure that tore open the floor of the ocean. Still, King Rastakhan did nothing. Finally, mere months before the Cataclysm, Zul returned. Tearing his clothes and throwing his staff to the ground, Zul spoke of earthquakes and tidal waves. He described the golden capital of Zandalar slowly sinking beneath the waves in the aftermath of the Cataclysm, its once-great people drowning as their mighty works slipped forever beneath the sea. He advised the council and the king to unite with the other troll tribes and to abandon their doomed homeland. Despite Zul's infamy, the council refused to believe in the scope of the disaster to come. Many felt that Zul was grandstanding to increase his own status and power. But the Cataclysm would come just as Zul foresaw and Zandalar would indeed be damaged; the spine of the land split in two, parts of its capital fell into the sea, and the region of &lt;a href=\"Nazmir\"&gt;Nazmir&lt;/a&gt; began to sink. But though Zandalar was indeed damaged, it did not sink as Zul predicted. While Zul and the Golden Fleet left Zandalar, those that stayed behind endured and rebuilt.\nIn years past, the Zandalar tribe, encompassing the wise and scholarly progenitors of the trolls, heroically assisted the Horde and the Alliance with thwarting the nefarious activities of their brethren in Zul'Gurub and Zul'Drak. Yet the chaos unleashed by the recent Cataclysm has reshaped the Zandalari's philosophy about the world and the dwindling remnants of their race. Led by Zul, the Zandalari have issued a call to Azeroth's embattled troll populations: unite into a single mighty empire and save their race from extinction. Thus far, the Gurubashi and Amani trolls have answered the summons and received aid from the Zandalari, allowing them to rebuild their respective capitals in Zul'Gurub and Zul'Aman. Not all trolls, however, have so eagerly adopted the Zandalari's grandiose vision of a new troll empire. Vol'jin and his Darkspear tribe are opposed to the warmongering espoused by Zul. To prevent the burgeoning Gurubashi and Amani troll forces from wreaking havoc on Azeroth, Vol'jin has reached out to his Horde comrades and members of the Alliance for assistance. Should the Darkspears' campaign fail, a new troll empire shall rise and bring war to a world already beset by suffering and conflict.\nThe Zandalar tribe &lt;a href=\"War%20against%20the%20Zandalari\"&gt;returned&lt;/a&gt;, resulting in the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20tribe\"&gt;Gurubashi tribe&lt;/a&gt;'s plan to retake &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt;, leading to a new assault on &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Gurub%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Zul'Gurub&lt;/a&gt;. Their involvement is also touched in Zul'Aman. They are being opposed by &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Darkspear\"&gt;Darkspear&lt;/a&gt; followers, who claim that they are manipulating the Amani and are the real threat. Vol'jin explains that the Zandalari are seeking to create a new troll empire, reaching out to all of the troll tribes, including the Amani, Gurubashi and his own Darkspear tribe - the likes of which would be a grave threat if not immediately dealt with. With aid from both &lt;a href=\"Halduron%20Brightwing\"&gt;Halduron Brightwing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vereesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Vereesa Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, Vol'jin was able to create an appropriate battle plan and personally leads a strike force into Zul'Aman and with the aid of adventurers puts an end to &lt;a href=\"Daakara\"&gt;Daakara&lt;/a&gt; and the Zandalari's efforts within Zul'Aman.\nDarkspear agents inside Zul'Gurub have discovered that &lt;a href=\"Jin%27do\"&gt;Jin'do&lt;/a&gt; is wrestling &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20the%20Soulflayer\"&gt;Hakkar the Soulflayer&lt;/a&gt; into submission, holding him by spirit chains and stripping out his power into himself. They enlist adventurers to put an end to Jin'do's mad plans once and for all. Upon destroying the spiritual chains holding the Soulflayer in place, Hakkar turns upon Jin'do, and utterly destroys him, leaving only the corpse of Jin'do the Broken. Hakkar then returns the adventurers to the mortal realm, promising to deal with them another time, before vanishing. Though Hakkar is free, the Zandalari have lost their hold on Zul'Gurub.\nMists of Pandaria.\nAfter the mists of &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; collapsed, the Zandalari were intensely curious about Pandaria, even more so perhaps than the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; were. Even with their defeat in Zul'Aman and Zul'Gurub the Zandalari have decided to continue their war efforts and appear in the &lt;a href=\"Kun-Lai%20Summit\"&gt;Kun-Lai Summit&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;. Having set up their base of operations on the island north of the mainland, they now pour down the shores of the region, attacking the denizens. They also hired and brought the &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Blackmane%20Mercenaries\"&gt;Blackmane&lt;/a&gt;.\nLong before the pandaren have established their empire on the continent, the Zandalari were allies with the then-ruling &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; and fought the pandaren for a long time. Now that the mists cloaking the continent have disappeared, the warmongering tribe returns to the ancient continent once more. With their homeland damaged by the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the Zandalari wish to make Pandaria their new home, before Zandalar sinks beneath the sea. To support them in their campaign, they plan to reforge their old alliance with the mogu by reviving &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen\"&gt;Lei Shen&lt;/a&gt;, the Thunder King. While King Rastakhan was in support of the plan to unite the lesser troll tribes after the Cataclysm, he was actually against the plan to revive Lei Shen.\nThe forces of Zandalari in Pandaria are led by &lt;a href=\"Prophet%20Khar%27zul\"&gt;Prophet Khar'zul&lt;/a&gt; under direct orders from the mysterious dark prophet Zul. Most of them are involved in the art of spiritbinding: a common art of dark magic practiced by them and their mogu allies, that can transfer a spirit into a new host body. They plan to reanimate the teracotta bodies slumbering within the crypts of &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20the%20Emperors\"&gt;Valley of the Emperors&lt;/a&gt; in Kun-Lai Summit in order to fuel the growing mogu army intended to reclaim &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, and eventually the dreaded figure that terrorized the land and \"lesser races\" inhabiting it in ancient times, the infamous emperor &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen\"&gt;Lei Shen&lt;/a&gt;, the Thunder King himself. The Zandalari eventually manage to reclaim the body and move it to the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Reckoning\"&gt;Isle of Reckoning&lt;/a&gt;, where the prophet made his lair. The Zandalari along with the help of all united troll tribes and &lt;a href=\"Mercenary\"&gt;mercenaries&lt;/a&gt; started to assault &lt;a href=\"Zouchin%20Village\"&gt;Zouchin Village&lt;/a&gt; near the Summit's coast, but the invasion was ultimately repelled, the prophet slain, but it was too late to stop Thunder King's resurrection.\nSome of the Zandalari have managed to break into &lt;a href=\"Mogu%27shan%20Vaults\"&gt;Mogu'shan Vaults&lt;/a&gt;, searching for arcane secrets. &lt;a href=\"Gara%27jal%20the%20Spiritbinder\"&gt;Gara'jal the Spiritbinder&lt;/a&gt; is leading the incursion.\nVol'jin: Shadows of the Horde.\nSeveral weeks after Lei Shen's revival, the Zandalari sent a second attack force to Zouchin Village. Led by &lt;a href=\"Khal%27ak\"&gt;Khal'ak&lt;/a&gt;, the purpose of this attack was to secure a landing spot for Zandalari ships going between Pandaria and the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Isle of Thunder&lt;/a&gt;. The attack was met with resistance from the &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan\"&gt;Shado-Pan&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href=\"Tyrathan%20Khort\"&gt;Tyrathan Khort&lt;/a&gt; and Vol'jin. Despite the defense, the Zandalari successfully took Zouchin and the pandaren living there were forced to flee.\nKhal'ak and her forces would later travel to &lt;a href=\"Tu%20Shen%20Burial%20Ground\"&gt;Tu Shen Burial Ground&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt; to revive Lei Shen's trusted &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Kao\"&gt;Warlord Kao&lt;/a&gt;. Once again they found resistance from the Shado-Pan, though they were taken prisoner by the Zandalari save for Vol'jin, who Khal'ak attempted to convince to leave the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and join the Zandalari. Khal'ak and her forces brought the prisoners and Vol'jin to the Isle of Thunder, where Vol'jin freed his comrades and they returned to the &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan%20Monastery\"&gt;Shado-Pan Monastery&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Zandalari, their mogu allies, and their Gurubashi and Amani servants attacked the Monastery and found themselves facing &lt;a href=\"The%20Thirty-three\"&gt;The Thirty-three&lt;/a&gt;. Despite the overwhelming numbers, the Zandalari forces fell to traps and the superior fighting skills of the Monastery's defenders. Khal'ak was killed when Vol'jin pierced her throat with a &lt;a href=\"monk\"&gt;monk&lt;/a&gt; technique.\nThe Thunder King.\nMost of the Zandalari supporting &lt;a href=\"Zul\"&gt;Zul&lt;/a&gt; have joined Lei Shen in his island fortress - &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Throne of Thunder&lt;/a&gt;. Under Lei Shen's orders, the Zandalari begin building massive ships in areas already under mogu occupation. Zandalari and mogu forces have landed at most of the coastlines in Pandaria, and have begun to invade the surrounding regions. This Zandalari army that marched on the island of the Thunder King is not the entire Zandalari race, but one branch of their force that's cruising out around the world. The Zandalari were promised generous holdings along the northern coast of Pandaria by Lei Shen.\nSometime after the events at the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Isle of Thunder&lt;/a&gt;, the Zandalari have turned their focus on rallying the &lt;a href=\"Frostmane%20tribe\"&gt;Frostmane tribe&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Morogh\"&gt;Dun Morogh&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;, but their plans were thwarted by &lt;a href=\"Moira%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Moira Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nA few Zandalari have shown up among the &lt;a href=\"Shipwrecked%20Captive\"&gt;shipwrecked captives&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Oceanus%20Cove\"&gt;Oceanus Cove&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Azsuna\"&gt;Azsuna&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nWith the new arising &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;conflict&lt;/a&gt; between the two main powers of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; has come to Zandalar to recruit the remaining Zandalari on the island into its ranks as a result of the new war. The Zandalari are under attack by the &lt;a href=\"blood%20troll\"&gt;blood troll&lt;/a&gt;s and in a &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20civil%20war\"&gt;civil war&lt;/a&gt; between the &lt;a href=\"Atal%27zul\"&gt;followers of Zul&lt;/a&gt; and the followers of Rastakhan.\nDuring the conflict, Rastakhan would be attacked by Zul but barely survive, and the Loa of Kings &lt;a href=\"Rezan\"&gt;Rezan&lt;/a&gt; would remind King Rastakhan of his duties and convince him to take the threat of Zul more seriously. This lead to a final confrontation with Zul, however during the fight Zul would kill the Loa of Kings. The death of Rezan left Rastakahn vulnerable, and he was later killed during &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Dazar%27alor%20%28battle%29\"&gt;the Battle of Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt;. Leadership would pass to his daughter &lt;a href=\"Talanji\"&gt;Talanji&lt;/a&gt;, though not all Zandalari trolls were happy about it. Thinking of her as cursed, and afraid she would elevate the &lt;a href=\"Bwonsamdi\"&gt;loa of death&lt;/a&gt; over all others, a small-scale rebellion happened during her coronation.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, Talanji's rule was threatened by the &lt;a href=\"Widow%27s%20Bite\"&gt;Widow's Bite&lt;/a&gt; led by her childhood friend &lt;a href=\"Apari\"&gt;Apari&lt;/a&gt;. Not approving of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bwonsamdi\"&gt;Bwonsamdi&lt;/a&gt;, the rebels spread false rumors, made attempts on the new queen's life, attacked Dazar'alor, and kidnapped noblemen. Although the Horde wanted to help Talanji, they also needed to know what was happening in Zandalar, so they elevated &lt;a href=\"Zekhan\"&gt;Zekhan&lt;/a&gt; to the rank of Horde &lt;a href=\"ambassador\"&gt;ambassador&lt;/a&gt; and was then sent to Zuldazar. Although Talanji's forces were bigger, they could not apprehend the rebels in time, being spread across the swamps. Seeking the death of Bwonsamdi, the rebels allied with &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20loyalists\"&gt;Sylvanas' loyalists&lt;/a&gt; and worked on dismantling his shrines.\nUltimately, Horde forces arrived to Zandalar and helped Talanji and the Zandalari forces to defeat the rebels as well as the undead loyalists led by &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller\"&gt;Nathanos Blightcaller&lt;/a&gt;. This was also achieved with the help of &lt;a href=\"Tayo\"&gt;Tayo&lt;/a&gt;, a former rebel who started disapproving with their methods when Apari wanted to sacrifice children, who provided the Zandalari and Horde crucial information about traps laid by Nathanos. This victory brought the Zandalari Empire closer to the Horde, with Talanji taking her seat at the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Council\"&gt;Horde Council&lt;/a&gt;, and Tayo becoming the empire's ambassador to the Horde.\nMilitary.\nThe Zandalari Empire military organizations:\nSpeculation.\nThe \"final defeat from evil within their own tribe\" that was mentioned by the Zandalari at Yojamba's isle may allude to the summoning of Hakkar on Zandalar and the subsequent release of the &lt;a href=\"plague%20of%20corrupted%20blood\"&gt;blood plague&lt;/a&gt; and the creation of the &lt;a href=\"blood%20troll\"&gt;blood troll&lt;/a&gt;s. This led to the Zandalari \"banishing the trolls who would destroy their own kind\", which would correspond to the trolls who summoned the blood god. However, Hakkar was summoned to Zandalar \"many millennia ago\", which would be an odd choice of words if it was the same incident as this one which occurred 1,500 years ago."}

They consisted of the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Farraki%20tribe\"&gt;Farraki&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20tribe\"&gt;Gurubashi&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Drakkari%20tribe\"&gt;Drakkari tribe&lt;/a&gt;s under &lt;a href=\"Zandalar%20tribe\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; leadership, sent to conquer &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Zul\"&gt;Dark Prophet Zul&lt;/a&gt; who directed the assault from somewhere in the &lt;a href=\"South%20Seas\"&gt;South Seas&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Vilnak%27dor\"&gt;Vilnak'dor&lt;/a&gt; was sent by &lt;a href=\"King%20Rastakhan\"&gt;King Rastakhan&lt;/a&gt; to aid with leading the Zandalari in Pandaria.\nHistory.\nThe Zandalari Invaders were the result of Zul's call to unite the troll tribes following the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, in the wake of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; efforts to stop the rise of the Zandalari after their attacks on &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Gurub\"&gt;Zul'Gurub&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt;. Rather than simply working together as they had been within the two troll cities, the Invaders were a unified force. They invaded the northern part of &lt;a href=\"Kun-Lai%20Summit\"&gt;Kun-Lai Summit&lt;/a&gt;, attacking &lt;a href=\"Zouchin%20Village\"&gt;Zouchin Village&lt;/a&gt;. There, they established the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Vanguard\"&gt;Zandalari Vanguard&lt;/a&gt; and gathered resources. When confronted, the majority of the invaders claimed that &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt; was destroyed by the Cataclysm and for that reason they needed to conquer &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; as they were now homeless.\nThe Invaders rekindled their relationship with the &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; and found Emperor &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen\"&gt;Lei Shen&lt;/a&gt;'s body buried inside the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Conquerors\"&gt;Tomb of Conquerors&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Emperors\"&gt;Valley of Emperors&lt;/a&gt;, along with his army. The trolls took the body to the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Reckoning\"&gt;Isle of Reckoning&lt;/a&gt;, just north of the Vanguard, and the Thunder King was resurrected by &lt;a href=\"Prophet%20Khar%27zul\"&gt;Prophet Khar'zul&lt;/a&gt; before they could be stopped by some &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s. Though Khar'zul was slain, Lei'shen escaped. &lt;a href=\"Gara%27jal%20the%20Spiritbinder\"&gt;Gara'jal the Spiritbinder&lt;/a&gt; and his forces would later delve into the &lt;a href=\"Mogu%27shan%20Vaults\"&gt;Mogu'shan Vaults&lt;/a&gt; in order to learn dark secrets, though they too were defeated.\nThe Thunder King returned to his &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;island stronghold&lt;/a&gt;. He gathered most of the mogu clans and the Zandalari Invaders to his &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;throne&lt;/a&gt;, forming a ruthless army capable of crushing Pandaria. He quickly encountered opposition, however, from the &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan%20Assault\"&gt;Shado-Pan Assault&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor%20Offensive\"&gt;Kirin Tor Offensive&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Sunreaver%20Onslaught\"&gt;Sunreaver Onslaught&lt;/a&gt;. Lei Shen rewarded the most loyal and ambitious Zandalari trolls with power beyond their wildest dreams. The berserker &lt;a href=\"Jin%27rokh%20the%20Breaker\"&gt;Jin'rokh&lt;/a&gt; was one of the first to receive the King's blessing. Gara'jal's spirit had also persisted and would later form the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Elders\"&gt;Council of Elders&lt;/a&gt; alongside the leaders of the Amani, Farraki, Gurubashi and Drakkari, representing the Invaders within the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Throne of Thunder&lt;/a&gt;, the palace of the Thunder King. &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Warbringer\"&gt;Zandalari Warbringer&lt;/a&gt;s also arrived throughout Pandaria, challenging the Horde and Alliance forces.\nThe Thunder King's allies and legions were eventually defeated, and adventurers of the Alliance and Horde laid siege to his stronghold. In front of the gate to the palace, Lei Shen appeared and summoned a storm that collapsed the entrance bridge along with the adventurers. Fighting through the caves and depths, they eventually fought through the citadel, and Lei Shen himself was slain at the &lt;a href=\"Pinnacle%20of%20Storms%20%28subzone%29\"&gt;Pinnacle of Storms&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; had what remained of his power drained into the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Antonidas\"&gt;Staff of Antonidas&lt;/a&gt;, transforming it into the &lt;a href=\"Storm-Stave%20of%20Antonidas\"&gt;Storm-Stave of Antonidas&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20the%20Thunder%20King\"&gt;Heart of the Thunder King&lt;/a&gt; was brought to &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt;, who wanted to know how and why the mogu came to be. The black dragon ultimately ate the heart to prevent Lei Shen from ever being resurrected again. Without a central leader, the surviving mogu dispersed, and the Zandalari Invaders were defeated.\nAftermath.\nAfter their demise, the Zandalari &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Fleet\"&gt;Golden Fleet&lt;/a&gt; returned home with whatever survivors remained. The loss of the Zandalari Invaders had sweeping repercussions for the Drakkari, as this would be the last time they would stand as a tribe. By the time that the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; reached for Zandalar, they were already declared as a lost tribe.\nZul's prophecies that had spurred the Invaders to attack Pandaria had been since proven false as Zandalar was not destroyed. While there was damage, it was rebuilt and not nearly as significant as Zul claimed it would be. It is unknown if the invaders were just simply taking Zul at face value, or believed that, after areas such as &lt;a href=\"Nazmir\"&gt;Nazmir&lt;/a&gt; and part of &lt;a href=\"Dazar%27alor\"&gt;Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt; were destroyed, that it was simply inevitable. This was a lie perpetrated to learn the methods of resurrection using Lei Shen.\nSome of his followers appeared to have lost faith in &lt;a href=\"Zul\"&gt;Zul&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href=\"Dockmaster%20Cobo\"&gt;Dockmaster Cobo&lt;/a&gt;, while others kept to his promise that they would be called upon again. As a result, the &lt;a href=\"Atal%27zul\"&gt;Atal'zul&lt;/a&gt; contained members from Zul's excursion into Pandaria, such as &lt;a href=\"Vilnak%27dor\"&gt;Vilnak'dor&lt;/a&gt; and continued the Invaders' alliance with the mogu. Zul would later go on to use what he learned from Lei Shen's revival to revive &lt;a href=\"Dazar\"&gt;Dazar&lt;/a&gt;, first king of the Zandalari, during &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20civil%20war\"&gt;his attempted coup against the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Empire\"&gt;Zandalari Empire&lt;/a&gt;."}
