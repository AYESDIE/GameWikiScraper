Suddenly, two &lt;a href=\"Rattling%20Dead\"&gt;Rattling Dead&lt;/a&gt; crawl up out of the ground and attack the two &lt;a href=\"Valarjar\"&gt;Valarjar&lt;/a&gt;.\nBy the time you kill the two &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s, four more Rattling Dead have risen amidst another dust cloud further down the path.\nUpon killing the second group of skeletons:\nA large group of Rattling Dead are shambling about in front of the entrance to the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20the%20Old%20Kings\"&gt;Tomb of the Old Kings&lt;/a&gt;. However, as you and Hruthnir approach, fel flames begin to erupt around the skeletons' feet, and suddenly a group of &lt;a href=\"Lesser%20Imp\"&gt;Lesser Imp&lt;/a&gt;s led by &lt;a href=\"Pillik\"&gt;Pillik&lt;/a&gt; appear and kill the undead amidst a series of fel explosions.\nStage 2: The Disturbance.\nPillik has 537,000 health (at level 100). He mainly casts Fel Firebolts (interruptible) but will occasionally cast \"Retreat!\", teleporting a short distance away while also spawning more Lesser Imps.\nKilling Pillik:\nStage 3: Crypt Crawl.\nHruthnir walks over to the entrance of the Tomb of the Old Kings and pushes the doors open. Inside, lightning orbs called &lt;a href=\"Swirling%20Storms\"&gt;Swirling Storms&lt;/a&gt; are moving about while &lt;a href=\"Reylar%20the%20Stormcaller\"&gt;Reylar the Stormcaller&lt;/a&gt; is channeling storm magic. The Swirling Storms deal damage to anyone standing near them. While they have little health, they will regenerate a few seconds after being killed.\nAid Hruthnir in killing Reylar, at which point the Swirling Storms become permanently dormant and no longer deal damage.\nFurther down into the tomb, the hallway is taken up by a Windwall that pushes anyone who tries to stand in it back towards the direction of the entrance. The Windwall is maintained by three &lt;a href=\"Spectral%20Windshaper\"&gt;Spectral Windshaper&lt;/a&gt;s \u2014 one in a southern alcove, one in a northern alcove and one at the western end of the hallway.\nAfter some time:\nFollow Hruthnir's advice and use &lt;a href=\"Heroic%20Leap\"&gt;Heroic Leap&lt;/a&gt; to reach the windshapers. After killing the southern and northern channelers, the Windwall is removed, allowing Hruthnir to run up to and attack the western Windshaper.\nAfter killing the last Windshaper and reaching the western end of the hall, Hruthnir turns south to find a door sealed with two &lt;a href=\"Swirling%20Storms\"&gt;Swirling Storms&lt;/a&gt;.\nUse &lt;a href=\"Heroic%20Throw\"&gt;Heroic Throw&lt;/a&gt; to destroy the lightning orbs. If the player does not do so for some time, Hruthnir will destroy the orbs himself.\nStage 4: The Confrontation.\nUpon the orbs' destruction, the doors swing inward, opening the way into the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20the%20Icebreaker\"&gt;Tomb of the Icebreaker&lt;/a&gt;. When the player follows Hruthnir down into the chamber, a cutscene begins.\nHruthnir runs a few yards further into the chamber, the walls of which are lined with alcoves housing dormant, ghostly &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpeak with Hruthnir to start the encounter.\nHruthnir runs forward another few yards into the middle of the tomb.\nMagnar suddenly leaps down from his platform, landing in front of Hruthnir. He immediately becomes and starts attacking the Valarjar.\nGhostly &lt;a href=\"Icebreaker%20Champion\"&gt;Icebreaker Champion&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Icebreaker%20Tombguard\"&gt;Icebreaker Tombguard&lt;/a&gt;s begin to awaken from their alcoves and attack the player and Hruthnir.\nMagnar leaps back up onto his platform, becoming unattackable as more guards gradually awaken. Two of the dormant vrykul are Spectral Windshapers, who travel halfway up the two stairs leading to Magnar's platform and begins casting a spell similar to the Windwall seen earlier to prevent the player from reaching Magnar.\nHelp Hruthnir kill all of the non-Windshaper vrykul to proceed to the next stage.\nStage 5: The Greatest Warrior.\nHruthnir runs up the western flight of stairs, killing the Windshaper along the way and then rushing to confront his father again. However, the Windwall-like spell persists, forcing you to use &lt;a href=\"Heroic%20Leap\"&gt;Heroic Leap&lt;/a&gt; to reach the platform.\nHelp Hruthnir bring Magnar to 1% health, at which point he turns and kneels in defeat.\nFinal Stage: Armaments of the Black Wyrm.\nThe Armaments have landed in the area between the two stairs. After looting and equipping them, a &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr%20of%20Odyn\"&gt;Val'kyr of Odyn&lt;/a&gt; appears next to a pillar of light that allows you to &lt;a href=\"Jump%20to%20Skyhold\"&gt;Jump to Skyhold&lt;/a&gt;. Return to the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Mead%20Hall\"&gt;Great Mead Hall&lt;/a&gt; and speak to Odyn to complete the quest."}

Talking to Darkhammer will unlock the catalog. It requires player-made goods and items from &lt;a href=\"Scholomance\"&gt;Scholomance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;.\nObjectives.\nIn order to create the Leggings of Arcana, you will be required to bring the following items back to Malyfous Darkhammer: 1 Pristine Hide of the Beast; 5 Frayed Abomination Stitchings; 5 Arcanite Bars; 5 &lt;a href=\"Frostwhisper%27s%20Embalming%20Fluid\"&gt;Frostwhisper's Embalming Fluid&lt;/a&gt;.\nYou will also be required to pay 50 gold pieces for the crafting of the item. \nDescription.\nWhile the crafting of such an item has never successfully been accomplished, it is thought to be possible - under the right circumstance.\nShould the seeker of arcanum desire to imbue leggings with immense power, the following they must find:\nBEHOLD! \nProgress.\nUnless you've got everything I need, you're wasting my time. \nCompletion.\nFew more improbable tasks I have seen completed by mortals. Bask in the glory of my handiwork! Reap its rewards!\nNotes.\nThe Pristine Hide of the Beast is skinned off &lt;a href=\"The%20Beast\"&gt;The Beast&lt;/a&gt; by a level 310 &lt;a href=\"Skinning\"&gt;skinner&lt;/a&gt;. Frayed Abomination Stitchings drop off the &lt;a href=\"abomination\"&gt;abomination&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Arcanite\"&gt;Arcanite&lt;/a&gt; Bars can be bought from the &lt;a href=\"Auction%20House\"&gt;Auction House&lt;/a&gt; or crafted by &lt;a href=\"Alchemy\"&gt;Alchemists&lt;/a&gt;. Frostwhisper's Embalming Fluid can be looted in &lt;a href=\"Scholomance\"&gt;Scholomance&lt;/a&gt; from the room with &lt;a href=\"Ras%20Frostwhisper\"&gt;Ras Frostwhisper&lt;/a&gt;. All of these materials can be collected without having the quest. \n\"Tip\": Because Pristine Hide of the Beast is so much harder to get than all other materials, you should collect that material first. Then collect the BOP Frostwhisper's Embalming Fluid and Frayed Abomination Stitchings. Once you have these materials, you can buy the arcanite bars and then take and complete the quest. This minimizes the usage of your quest log and bank space."}

This additional tick usually occurs a moment after the original tick. Consequently, ticks that deal fatal damage to a target are not usually capable of generating bonus ticks.\nShadowy Recall procs work independent of crits. Critical hits can generate bonus ticks, but these bonus ticks do not automatically crit. Bonus ticks have the same chance of critting as any other tick, regardless of whether generated by a critical or non-critical hit.\nBecause this mastery depends on a proc chance to generate bonus ticks, its effectiveness is highly subject to chance, or &lt;a href=\"RNG\"&gt;RNG&lt;/a&gt;.

The trolls use her venom as a powerful poison for their weapons. She is summoned by using the &lt;a href=\"Idol%20of%20Shadra\"&gt;Idol of Shadra&lt;/a&gt; at her altars in &lt;a href=\"Shadra%27Alor\"&gt;Shadra'Alor&lt;/a&gt;.\nShe can be encountered in the &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt; as an &lt;a href=\"elite\"&gt;elite&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Witherbark%20tribe\"&gt;Witherbark tribe&lt;/a&gt; worships Shadra, and one time collected her most potent venom from her. The &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;, wanting her venom, wished to summon her. To summon her, it was required to know her true name: Elortha no Shadra. After Shadra was summoned and killed, her venom was sent to the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;.\nLike the other primary loa worshiped by the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20tribe\"&gt;Gurubashi tribe&lt;/a&gt;, Shadra was held in &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Gurub%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Zul'Gurub&lt;/a&gt; against her will during the time when the &lt;a href=\"Hakkari\"&gt;Hakkari&lt;/a&gt; were attempting to resurrect &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20the%20Soulflayer\"&gt;Hakkar the Soulflayer&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nAt &lt;a href=\"Jintha%27alor\"&gt;Jintha'alor&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Vilebranch%20tribe\"&gt;Vilebranch tribe&lt;/a&gt; drank Shadra's blood and performed mass sacrifices in her name. The &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt; wanted to kill her in advance before she could be directed to them, while the Forsaken once more wanted Shadra's venom for their &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Apothecary%20Society\"&gt;apothecaries&lt;/a&gt;. At &lt;a href=\"Shadra%27Alor\"&gt;Shadra'Alor&lt;/a&gt;, she was once more summoned and killed.\nVol'jin: Shadows of the Horde.\nShortly after the events of &lt;a href=\"Landfall\"&gt;Landfall&lt;/a&gt;, Shadra communicated with &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 betrayed by &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 through visions. According to &lt;a href=\"Khal%27ak\"&gt;Khal'ak&lt;/a&gt; in the distant past a few Zandalari turned away from her worship to the powers of Mogu, which displeased the Mother of Venom. Following the Zandalari's defeat at the &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan%20Monastery\"&gt;Shado-Pan Monastery&lt;/a&gt; effort &lt;a href=\"Bwonsamdi\"&gt;Bwonsamdi&lt;/a&gt; remarked that the silk dance would rejoice at the web Vol'jin weaved and would be a bit beholden to him due her Zandalari failing.\nTraveler: The Spiral Path.\nShadra was summoned by the &lt;a href=\"Sandfury%20tribe\"&gt;Sandfury tribe&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Farrak\"&gt;Zul'Farrak&lt;/a&gt; so they could sacrifice their prisoners - &lt;a href=\"Aramar%20Thorne\"&gt;Aramar Thorne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Makasa%20Flintwill\"&gt;Makasa Flintwill&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Taryndrella\"&gt;Taryndrella&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hackle\"&gt;Hackle&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Murky%20%28Traveler%29\"&gt;Murky&lt;/a&gt; - to her. But Taryndrella, &lt;a href=\"dryad\"&gt;dryad&lt;/a&gt; daughter of &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;, stopped her from doing so because as a child of nature there was no venom that could harm her, no spider that was not her friend, and death was as natural as life. Furthermore, Taryndrella stopped Shadra from going after her other companions. Shadra backed away and nodded her head out of respect \u2014 or perhaps out of fear.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20civil%20war\"&gt;Zandalari civil war&lt;/a&gt;, her own high priestess &lt;a href=\"Yazma\"&gt;Yazma&lt;/a&gt; trapped Shadra in the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Shadra\"&gt;Shrine of Shadra&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt; and feasted on her blood. Yazma thus consumed Shadra's might in the name of &lt;a href=\"Zul\"&gt;Zul&lt;/a&gt;, killing Shadra in the process, and transforming herself into a spider-like troll being. &lt;a href=\"Wardruid%20Loti\"&gt;Wardruid Loti&lt;/a&gt; compared this to what happened to the loa in &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Drak\"&gt;Zul'Drak&lt;/a&gt;.\nShadow Rising.\n&lt;a href=\"Talanji\"&gt;Talanji&lt;/a&gt; considers Shadra to be dead.\nShadowlands.\nWith the machine of death broken, Shadra's soul traveled into the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt;, where she remained until she was rescued by &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt;. After being brought to &lt;a href=\"Ardenweald\"&gt;Ardenweald&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Winter%20Queen\"&gt;Winter Queen&lt;/a&gt; took Shadra under her care.\nFollowers.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Atal%27Shadra\"&gt;Atal'Shadra&lt;/a&gt; are fallen followers of Shadra who joined with &lt;a href=\"Yazma\"&gt;Yazma&lt;/a&gt; and turned hostile.\n&lt;a href=\"Samara\"&gt;Samara&lt;/a&gt;, the White Widow, stayed faithful to her loa.

Located on the border of the Barrens and Dustwallow Marsh, the inn was torched by unknown vandals. Although the owner of the inn, a man now known as &lt;a href=\"Smiling%20Jim\"&gt;Smiling Jim&lt;/a&gt;, escaped, his wife and child were not so lucky. Their brutal deaths weakened Jim's grip on sanity, and he can now be found in the city of Theramore, reciting the same poem over and over again.\nVery scant evidence is available to indicate who or what was responsible for the destruction of the inn. Still, some adventurers have reported seeing a set of hooftracks leading away from the inn, and at least one investigator recovered a scorched black shield from the wall of the inn. According to the engraving on the shield, it was crafted by &lt;a href=\"Mosarn\"&gt;Mosarn&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 a very respected blacksmith in Thunder Bluff. Even more importantly, a golden badge belonging to Lieutenant &lt;a href=\"Paval%20Reethe\"&gt;Paval Reethe&lt;/a&gt;, a deserter from the Theramore Isle military, has been found in the charred ruins of the inn. With the help of an ogre named Ogrok, Paval Reethe was tracked down, but he was executed by the Theramore military before he could disclose the name of the person responsible for the arson.\nAlthough many adventurers have contacted Mosarn regarding the shield, he was unable to provide any specific information regarding its owner or anything that may help the investigation. Thus, it can be concluded that the investigation has reached a dead end and is unlikely to advance until either Mosarn provides the information required or some additional clues surface.\nThe burning of the Shady Rest Inn was an unfortunate incident that spelled trouble for the relationships between the Alliance and the Horde. The fact that Thrall specifically ordered the humans of Theramore Isle to be left alone further fuelled the Warchief's anger over the destruction of the inn, leading him to order an investigation into the incident to find those responsible and bring them to justice.\nAt the Shady Rest Inn.\nAt the Shady Rest Inn, the quest branches into three paths, each starting when a different item gets looted.\nLoot the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Shield\"&gt;Black Shield&lt;/a&gt;:\nLoot the &lt;a href=\"Hoofprints\"&gt;Hoofprints&lt;/a&gt;:\nLoot the &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Guard%20Badge\"&gt;Theramore Guard Badge&lt;/a&gt;:\nConclusion.\n&lt;a href=\"Patch%202.3.0\"&gt;Patch 2.3.0&lt;/a&gt; added a concluding chapter to this story. After completing Black Shield 5, Suspicious Hoofprints, and Questioning Reethe, &lt;a href=\"Mosarn\"&gt;Mosarn&lt;/a&gt; will volunteer new information to the player and give the quest \"Return to Krog\". This begins the final steps of the quest chain."}

She honors the ideals that &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; upheld during his time as &lt;a href=\"warchief\"&gt;warchief&lt;/a&gt;, even when her companions in the Garad'kra pursue their own goals over serving the greater good.\nBiography.\nThe Garad'kra.\nShagara spent many years in the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Barrens\"&gt;Northern Barrens&lt;/a&gt; with her father, a &lt;a href=\"farmer\"&gt;farmer&lt;/a&gt;. In adulthood, Shagara and other shaman used their skills to compel the elements to bring rain to the parched settlements of the drought-prone &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;, causing many to depend on her.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, Shagara's shaman mentor &lt;a href=\"Targnak\"&gt;Targnak&lt;/a&gt; recommended her to the &lt;a href=\"Garad%27kra\"&gt;Garad'kra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;'s new &lt;a href=\"militia\"&gt;militia&lt;/a&gt; group, and she was put in charge of a team consisting of &lt;a href=\"Ironhoof\"&gt;Ironhoof&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ashra%20Valandril\"&gt;Ashra&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elf&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rada%27jin\"&gt;Rada'jin&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"jungle%20troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Felgrim\"&gt;Felgrim&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;. While en route to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, Shagara and Targnak tried to save a farm in northern Durotar from lava streams, but the &lt;a href=\"water%20elemental\"&gt;water spirits&lt;/a&gt; refused to answer her call. Targnak suggested that she should finish her journey to Orgrimmar instead, but Shagara refused to give up and called on the element of &lt;a href=\"Air%20elemental\"&gt;air&lt;/a&gt; to create a lightning storm. This halted the lava, but also destroyed the farm. Targnak admonished her for her recklessness, but Shagara replied that he was the one who'd taught her that risk is a part of life.\nIn Orgrimmar, Shagara summoned Ironhoof, Ashra, and Rada'jin to the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Honor\"&gt;Valley of Honor&lt;/a&gt;, to inspect them before they assembled in front of &lt;a href=\"Battlemaster%20Br%C3%B6ng\"&gt;Battlemaster Br\u00f6ng&lt;/a&gt;. She named Ironhoof to be her &lt;a href=\"Stone%20guard%20%28rank%29\"&gt;stone guard&lt;/a&gt;, giving his commands the same weight as hers, in the hopes of using his experience to mold her team. Ashra, who disliked the idea of the Garad'kra being led only by orcs, challenged Shagara to &lt;a href=\"mak%27gora\"&gt;mak'gora&lt;/a&gt; for command of the team. She nearly killed him in the duel, but left him alive with the intent of humbling him. She and the others then hurried to meet up with the last team member, Felgrim, as he arrived to Orgrimmar. Shagara intervened when a group of orcs tried to attack Felgrim for his involvement in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Angrathar%20the%20Wrathgate\"&gt;Wrathgate&lt;/a&gt;, but Felgrim proceeded to incinerate the orcs and warn his new teammates not to interfere in his affairs. At the Garad'kra assembly in the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Ring of Valor&lt;/a&gt;, Battlemaster Br\u00f6ng gave them their first mission: to deal with a new &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt; threat. Ashra continued bickering with Felgrim and Ironhoof until Shagara reminded the blood elf of her authority.\nThe Barrens.\nShagara's team traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Barrens\"&gt;Northern Barrens&lt;/a&gt; and found the orc &lt;a href=\"Malgar\"&gt;Malgar&lt;/a&gt; under attack from the new centaur leader &lt;a href=\"Aratas\"&gt;Aratas&lt;/a&gt; and his soldiers. Shagara's team proved to be disorganized, with Rada'jin attacking recklessly and almost costing them the battle, but they ultimately won the fight thanks to Malgar's help. Afterward, Shagara harshly reprimanded Rada'jin. Malgar's unlikely friend &lt;a href=\"Dorthar\"&gt;Dorthar&lt;/a&gt;, a centaur abandoned by his kin, revealed that Aratas had created an army of centaur and orc &lt;a href=\"slave\"&gt;slave&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"Desolace\"&gt;Desolace&lt;/a&gt; in order to invade &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt; and Orgrimmar. Shagara asked for Ironhoof's advice, and he decided that the Garad'kra needed to buy the Horde time by striking at Desolace on their own.\nShagara sent word back to Br\u00f6ng, after which the team set out on a &lt;a href=\"zeppelin\"&gt;zeppelin&lt;/a&gt; journey to Desolace alongside Malgar and Dorthar. During the voyage, Malgar argued with Shagara, telling her that her disorganized team had no chance against the centaur army and that they should focus on freeing the slaves instead. Shagara shot back that the lone wolf Malgar knew nothing of teamwork. Shagara bonded with a self-deprecating Rada'jin, assuring him that they all\u2014Shagara most of all\u2014were trying to prove their worth, just like him. She also helped teach Dorthar how to fight and play to his strengths, an exercise which the rest of the Garad'kra soon joined in on, knitting the team closer together and training them to work as a unit.\nMaraudon.\nOn arrival in Desolace, Shagara and Ironhoof formed a plan to stop the centaur army by killing Aratas, even if it meant their own deaths, while Malgar and Dorthar would free the orc slaves. In the ensuing battle outside &lt;a href=\"Maraudon\"&gt;Maraudon&lt;/a&gt;, the Garad'kra started to lose against Aratas' &lt;a href=\"perfect%20ones\"&gt;perfect ones&lt;/a&gt;. The khan personally attacked and captured Shagara, who pretended to fall unconscious, and killed Rada'jin. Aratas then brought Shagara into Maraudon with the intent of sacrificing her to his &lt;a href=\"Aratas%27%20father\"&gt;elemental father&lt;/a&gt; to drive the latter into a bloodlust and cause it to rampage across Azeroth. The Garad'kra stopped in outer Maraudon to fight the elemental while Malgar pursued Aratas. The khan easily held Malgar off until Shagara revealed that she was conscious and used her earth totem to root the centaur in place, allowing Malgar to decapitate him. The two orcs ran back to the main chamber and Malgar tossed Aratas' head at the elemental to distract it. Shagara gave Aratas' spear\u2014the elemental's only weakness\u2014to Ashra, and after the others used their abilities to give him an opening, he used it to destroy the monster.\nAratas' death gave the Horde enough time to break up the centaur army and end their threat. Back in Orgrimmar weeks later, as Shagara and Ironhoof searched for recruits that could take Rada'jin's place, Battlemaster Br\u00f6ng told Shagara that she had been reckless but that her mission had been a success. Shagara disagreed, as she was bothered by Rada'jin's death and disliked Warchief Hellscream's treatment of the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear&lt;/a&gt;, regardless of what Garrosh thought of her opinion.

Notably, &lt;a href=\"Valewalker%20Farodin\"&gt;Valewalker Farodin&lt;/a&gt; plants an &lt;a href=\"arcan%27dor\"&gt;arcan'dor&lt;/a&gt; on the central platform of Shal'Aran, which &lt;a href=\"Arcan%27dor%2C%20Gift%20of%20the%20Ancient%20Magi\"&gt;eventually&lt;/a&gt; grows to the point of bearing magical fruit capable of curing the nightborne's addiction to the &lt;a href=\"Nightwell\"&gt;Nightwell&lt;/a&gt;.\nPortals.\nOnce you finish Oculeth\u2019s quests he comes with you to Shal\u2019aran where he becomes your Chief Telemancer. After which the player can unlock more portals from other locations in Suramar to Shal'Aran.\nSpeculation.\nShal'Aran's original purpose, before it was abandoned and later repurposed by the resistance, is unclear. It was obviously meant as a nexus of arcane energies, as every other known leyline feed in the wilds of Suramar feeds it. Thalyssra had no knowledge of the place before taking refuge there, and during &lt;a href=\"Shal%27Aran%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Shal'Aran (quest)&lt;/a&gt;, she is puzzled by what could have required such power: \"A weapon, perhaps?\"\nIt is possible that Shal'Aran was always meant to house an arcan'dor. Its layout is nearly identical to the &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Locus\"&gt;Shattered Locus&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Falanaar\"&gt;Falanaar&lt;/a&gt;, which has a failed arcan'dor in the middle; furthermore, when planting the seed on &lt;a href=\"The%20Valewalker%27s%20Burden\"&gt;The Valewalker's Burden&lt;/a&gt;, it is described to fit with a satisfying click. It is as if the seed and the central platform were meant for each other all along. Also, Selentia and her minions are described as \"keepers\", and while it is a generic term recurring in \"Warcraft\" lore, it is among other things known to refer to the elves of Farodin's order. Finally, the broken \"pillar\" in the center, seen when first entering Shal'Aran and fighting Selentia, looks suspiciously like a stump; the remains of a felled arcan'dor, perhaps?\nThis is further confirmed by the stump being called \"hubmanatree_dead\" in the game files, hubmanatree being the name used for the arcan'dor. Most notably, there are statues of open arcan'dor seeds used as decoration around the central platform.\nOne possible interpretation of the evidence is that the keepers originally planned to plant at least two arcan'dors, one in Falanaar and one in Shal'Aran. Perhaps Selentia was in charge of the Shal'Aran arcan'dor, like Farodin watched over the one in Falanaar. However, at some point, the tree in Shal'Aran was destroyed, possibly as a direct response to the tragedy of the Shattered Locus, so that Shal'Aran would be spared the same fate. Selentia then continued to watch over the ruins, even in undeath.\nThe roots of a third mana tree can be found under &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar City&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Nal%27tira%27s%20Lair\"&gt;Nal'tira's Lair&lt;/a&gt; where &lt;a href=\"Nal%27tira\"&gt;Nal'tira&lt;/a&gt; is fought, but the tree can not be seen."}

However, Anduin later freed himself and restored Shalamayne to its true state.\nHistory.\nShalla'tor and Ellemayne.\nShalla'tor and Ellemayne were a pair of magic elven blades forged during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; and wielded by the twins &lt;a href=\"Vor%27Illian\"&gt;Vor'Illian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lo%27Vellian\"&gt;Lo'Vellian&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"Darnassian\"&gt;Darnassian&lt;/a&gt;, \"Shalla'tor\" means \"Shadow Render\", while \"Ellemayne\" means \"Reaver\". While Ellemayne had a red gem, Shalla'tor had a blue one instead.\nThe blades eventually came into the possession of Lady &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;. After &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; was split into two people by &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Onyxia&lt;/a&gt;'s magic, the two ultimately found each other again and resolved to slay the black dragon. They were granted the night elven blades by Jaina, who aided them in the assault on &lt;a href=\"Onyxia%27s%20Lair\"&gt;Onyxia's Lair&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen Onyxia inadvertently combined the two Varians back into one person, the two blades were merged into a single weapon as well. This sword became known as Shalamayne, and its first target was the black dragon &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Onyxia&lt;/a&gt;, who was slain by the merged Varian using his new sword.\nShalamayne.\nAfter Onyxia's death, Varian returned home with the new sword at his side. Varian learned to wield his sword with either hand, although one would always be favored over the other. Shalamayne is also able to be split into Shalla'tor and Ellemayne.\nVarian used his sword against &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Gorehowl\"&gt;Gorehowl&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale%20war\"&gt;Ashenvale war&lt;/a&gt;. At the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;battle for the Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, Varian split Shalamayne into two to battle the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Upon his death, the split swords were left behind in the sand, their light snuffed out. Without Varian's touch, the sword lay dormant, awaiting the touch of another to which it would respond.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Armies%20of%20Legionfall\"&gt;Armies of Legionfall&lt;/a&gt; began their assault on the Broken Shore, Varian's son &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; sneaked out of Stormwind and journeyed to &lt;a href=\"Wrynnfall\"&gt;Wrynnfall&lt;/a&gt;, the site of his father's demise, where he found Shalamayne. The moment Anduin truly accepted the duties of a king, light once again began swirling in the right-hand blade he was holding, only this time with the golden glow of the &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt; instead of the orange-red hue of the &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;.\nShalamayne thus passed down to Anduin, making the young king a sword-wielding priest.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"mak%27gora\"&gt;mak'gora&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, Anduin gave Shalamayne to Saurfang, while &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; gave him &lt;a href=\"Dra%27gora\"&gt;Dra'gora&lt;/a&gt;. After losing the axe, Saurfang split the blade into Shalla'tor and Ellemayne, and managed to land a blow and wound Sylvanas's eye.\nKingsmourne.\nAfter Anduin was captured by the forces of &lt;a href=\"the%20Jailer\"&gt;the Jailer&lt;/a&gt; and brought to the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt;, he continued wielding Shalamayne until he was dragged into &lt;a href=\"Torghast%2C%20Tower%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Torghast, Tower of the Damned&lt;/a&gt;. In order to turn Anduin into his servant, the Jailer had his &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt; reforge Shalamayne into Kingsmourne, a &lt;a href=\"mourneblade\"&gt;mourneblade&lt;/a&gt; even greater than &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt;. As the weapon neared completion, the Jailer inserted a blue crystal forged from the soul of &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; into it to serve as the source of the &lt;a href=\"Domination\"&gt;Domination&lt;/a&gt; magic that would allow him to control Anduin. Far away in &lt;a href=\"Oribos\"&gt;Oribos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; sensed the creation of the mourneblade in the form of visions of a terrible darkness rising within Torghast. The Jailer's ally &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; tried to convince Anduin to join her and the Jailer willingly, but when this failed she was forced to Dominate him.\nThe Dominated Anduin was forced to use Kingsmourne to collect the &lt;a href=\"sigil\"&gt;covenant sigils&lt;/a&gt; required for the Jailer's plan to reach the &lt;a href=\"Sepulcher%20of%20the%20First%20Ones\"&gt;Sepulcher of the First Ones&lt;/a&gt; and remake reality. He was first sent to &lt;a href=\"Elysian%20Hold\"&gt;Elysian Hold&lt;/a&gt; with Kingsmourne initially disguised as Shalamayne. He plunged the weapon into the ground to release a shockwave of dark magic that stunned the nearby &lt;a href=\"Kyrian%23Paragons%20and%20Hands\"&gt;Paragons&lt;/a&gt; before stabbing &lt;a href=\"Kyrestia%20the%20Firstborne\"&gt;the Archon&lt;/a&gt; herself to extract her sigil. During &lt;a href=\"%3Athe%20Battle%20of%20Ardenweald\"&gt;:the Battle of Ardenweald&lt;/a&gt;, he used Kingsmourne to absorb the &lt;a href=\"Winter%20Queen\"&gt;Winter Queen&lt;/a&gt;'s sigil from the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20the%20Forest\"&gt;Heart of the Forest&lt;/a&gt;. During the battle between the Jailer and the &lt;a href=\"Primus\"&gt;Primus&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Runecarver%27s%20Oubliette\"&gt;Runecarver's Oubliette&lt;/a&gt;, he used it to extract the Primus' sigil and launch it into the Jailer's waiting hand.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Zereth%20Mortis\"&gt;Zereth Mortis&lt;/a&gt;, Anduin used Kingsmourne to Dominate &lt;a href=\"Dausegne\"&gt;Dausegne&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"automa%23Oracle\"&gt;oracle&lt;/a&gt; who then opened the way for Anduin and the Jailer into the Sepulcher of the First Ones. From some distance away, &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; felt a \"familiar presence\"\u2014that of Arthas\u2014in the sword. Within the Sepulcher of the First Ones, the Jailer forced Anduin to try to waylay the &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Walker\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt;s and their allies. He periodically used Kingsmourne to separate the heroes' souls from their bodies, allowing them to assist Anduin's own struggling soul and restore his willpower, in turn allowing him to manifest the source of his Domination\u2014the &lt;a href=\"Remnant%20of%20a%20Fallen%20King\"&gt;Remnant of a Fallen King&lt;/a&gt;\u2014from the weapon. At the end of the battle, the Jailer forced Anduin to plunge Kingsmourne into the ground again, enveloping him in smoke as the sword seemingly began draining his soul. As the king struggled, he suddenly saw the weapon's previous wielders, Varian and Saurfang, appear to him and remind him that Shalamayne's legacy was one of valor and honor, not darkness. With their help, Anduin was able to get a firm grip on the sword and split it in half, turning the blade back into Shalla'tor and Ellemayne, releasing what was left of Arthas' fading soul, and freeing Anduin himself from the effects of Domination. The king subsequently bore the Ellemayne half back with him to Zereth Mortis.\nAppearance.\nShalamayne has a unique narrow edge at the point and a thicker, angled edge further down. The hollow in the lower part of the blade glows like a sun. There is a backward arch at the bottom of the blade, and the hilt is long and slender.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Azeroth\"&gt;Battle for Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;\", the model of the weapon was re-detailed with refined accents, such as curving swirls down the blade. Though this was likely purely an art update, and its new appearance was included in older content such as &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt;, it is worth noting that the conceptualization for this version of Shalamayne is referred to as 'Shalamayne Reforged' by Blizzard's art design.\nDuring its time as Kingsmourne, the sword retained its overall shape, but with sharp spikes jutting out of the blade and with glowing &lt;a href=\"Domination\"&gt;Domination&lt;/a&gt; runes running along its length, mirroring the appearance of &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt;. In place of its normal light, the hollow near the hilt was filled by the glowing blue remnant of &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;'s soul."}

Being or having been priestesses during that time, &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; all knew her to some extent.\nHistory.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; she vanished secretly together with her lover, and later husband, &lt;a href=\"Jarod%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Jarod Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;. It was generally assumed that she wandered away and was killed in an accident, even though searchers never found a body. She and Jarod had agreed to keep their relationship secret, as he had not yet decided to leave their people behind and, hoping that she would not follow him into what amounted to self-exile, she would be free from having to answer questions as to why he had left.\nIn the end, she would leave with him, and they would spend the next 10,000 years enjoying their life together in the wilderness. Some time after the Battle for Mount Hyjal occurred, they heard rumors that they had become mortal.\nSome time after the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; occurred, Shalasyr was struck by an illness. While she and Jarod agreed to bring her to &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; to be saved by Tyrande and &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;, Shalasyr actually knew that she was dying and that it was her time. She privately wished to die among her people, and to make certain her husband would not remain alone after her passing. Once in the city, they run into &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; who helps carry her to Tyrande in an attempt to save her. Just as Shalasyr had already expected, by the time they arrive it's too late to do anything and she had already passed away. Tyrande arranged the wake for Jarod and had Shalasyr dressed, as was proper, as one of the &lt;a href=\"Sisterhood%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Sisterhood of Elune&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile Tyrande officiates her funeral in the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Moon\"&gt;Temple of the Moon&lt;/a&gt;, Elune guided Shalasyr's spirit from her body and she looks at Jarod, who then relives all the tender moments they had shared together over the centuries as if they had only happened yesterday. Her spirit then shrank into a tiny, glowing sphere that dissipated into the &lt;a href=\"moonlight\"&gt;moonlight&lt;/a&gt;. Jarod assumes that it was merely a \"visual effect\" of Tyrande's doing and later thanks her for it, but learns that she had done nothing (for her, doing so would have been disrespectful toward Jarod) and that he was the only one to see it. Tyrande explained that Elune had made it a private experience, meant only for Shalasyr and Jarod alone.\nHer funeral bier was led by Jarod and Tyrande outside the city, where Malfurion and some of his druids placed the body in a small patch of soft grass and bushes and lovingly arranged by two female druids to appear as if dreaming. Malfurion then grew a drape of white and golden flowers over her."}

Issue a challenge at the challenge stone to bring forth a powerful creature. Continue until you have caught the attention of the Ordon, drawing the Archiereus out of the &lt;a href=\"Ordon%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Ordon Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;.

In Heroic mode, there is one more boss after him. The murloc was using &lt;a href=\"Cookie%27s%20Tenderizer\"&gt;Cookie's Tenderizer&lt;/a&gt; to fight, a fun fact, until we learned how many skulls he smashed with.\nCookie survived his encounter and went to &lt;a href=\"Talador\"&gt;Talador&lt;/a&gt; to make some fine &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Chili\"&gt;Legion Chili&lt;/a&gt;. After meeting his demise at the hands of adventurers, his soul was sent to &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxus\"&gt;Maldraxxus&lt;/a&gt; where he became an &lt;a href=\"Chef%20Cookie\"&gt;abomination leftover&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe can be seen fighting the forces of &lt;a href=\"Deathwingurlugull\"&gt;Deathwingurlugull&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Azmerloth\"&gt;Azmerloth&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"Cookie proclaimed himself captain of the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Juggernaught\"&gt;juggernaut&lt;/a&gt; following its previous commander's death. Although he still performs his official duties as chief cook, anyone who questions the validity of his captain title has been known to come down with a severe case of food poisoning.\"\nStrategy.\nAfter Admiral Ripsnarl dies, Cookie will spawn inside the hut. He is heavily shadowed and untargetable. When you get near to him, he will run past you, to the center of the deck and spawn a cooking pot, then jump in it. If you get too close to the cooking pot, you will be dealt with fire damage. Cookie will throw food at random people, which will do damage and create food on the floor. There is Rotten food and normal food, the rotten food will emit a damaging aura to nearby players, if eaten it will debuff the player with 30% reduced movement and attack speed, and deal a DoT. The normal food when eaten will give players a stacking buff that increases movement and attack speed (with no stacking limit).\nThe Rotten food debuff can be dispelled by eating a normal food, thus not taking any AoE damage from the Rotten Food, and also keeping the normal food buff, which is 30% haste on casting, melee and range speed.\nIt is best if each member of the group eats one Rotten Food then eat one Normal Food to have the group have more space for movement. The achievement &lt;a href=\"I%27m%20on%20a%20Diet\"&gt;I'm on a Diet&lt;/a&gt; still works if you alternate between Normal and Rotten Food. (And thus can be argued as the \"correct\" way of approaching this fight). Also, eating food does not de-select your dps/healing target, and everyone should therefore be able to eat everything around their feet, without moving and stop dps/healing the entire fight.\nNote that Captain Cookie does not actually maintain a threat table. This fight can therefore be considerably shortened (and trivialized) by using 4 DPS and 1 healer.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

Clicking on it causes the plow to disappear from its resting place and appear in the player's inventory. The player should then stand next to a plot to be plowed and click on the plow, causing an animation of the character moving in the direction it was facing at the time and plowing any untilled plots in the path. The best results are realized when the player stands at one end of a row and faces in the direction of the opposite end, as the plow can till up to four plots (note that latency may reduce the number of plots tilled). If any \"occupied\" plots are in the way, the &lt;a href=\"virmen\"&gt;virmen&lt;/a&gt; within is forcibly expelled from the plot at half health and is stunned for a few seconds; the plot will require re-tilling -- either with the plow or by hand -- after the virmen has been killed. Once the player wishes to remove the plow from inventory, the standard message about the object being destroyed and asking for confirmation that the player wants to do this will appear, but in reality the plow respawns at its original spot near the steps and can be returned to inventory whenever the player clicks on it again.\nAs a quest objective.\nThis item starts &lt;a href=\"The%20%22Earth-Slasher%22%20Master%20Plow\"&gt;The \"Earth-Slasher\" Master Plow&lt;/a&gt;."}

This can be looted once daily for a symbol which can be turned in to the Matron for a .

{"id": "494804", "revid": "42014766", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=494804", "title": "Toranaar", "text": "Toranaar the Indomitable was the king and greatest champion of the ancient &lt;a href=\"aldrachi\"&gt;aldrachi&lt;/a&gt; people. When &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; offered the aldrachi a place in his &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, Toranaar refused and initiated a duel with Sargeras. Though he succeeded in inflicting a small injury on the lord of the Burning Legion, the aldrachi were then immediately wiped out by the infuriated Dark Titan. Toranaar's &lt;a href=\"Aldrachi%20Warblades\"&gt;Aldrachi Warblades&lt;/a&gt; were given to Sargeras' lieutenant, &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;, who in turn eventually gave them to &lt;a href=\"Caria%20Felsoul\"&gt;Caria Felsoul&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nToranaar came from a long line of respected warriors, and his elder brother was the greatest among them. Expectations of him were high, and after Toranaar took his first step he was cast into the merciless aldrachi war machine. Through the years of brutal training, one thought propelled Toranaar through the pain and suffering: winning the right to carry warblades, the most prestigious of all aldrachi weapons. As the young aldrachi lay in bed every night, his body bruised and broken, he pictured himself carrying warblades of his own. He willed that vision to become a reality.\nToward the end of his training, Toranaar had his final and greatest test as the aldrachi military high command chose an elder warrior at random to battle him in a fight to the death. When Toranaar stepped into the ritual fighting pit on the day of the duel, he saw that the opponent was his older brother. He spared his sibling only a passing glance, and instead fixed his eyes upon his brother's warblades. Toranaar's dream was within reach, and not even family would keep him from it. The two brothers grappled through the night and into the next day, and near the end both of them was on the verge of death. Toranaar finally managed to disarm his brother and took the warblades for himself before plunging the weapons deep in his sibling's chest, all without uttering a word.\nDefiance against the Legion.\nSome time later, &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; set his sights on recruiting the aldrachi into his &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; and resolved to send an invasion force to the aldrachi homeworld and wear the warrior race thin in order to make them ripe for conversion. Despite the overwhelming force of the countless invading demons, the aldrachi held fast against the enemy and fought like ravenous beasts, and none with more ferocity than Toranaar the Indomitable. According to a &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt; record known as \"&lt;a href=\"%3AThe%20Codex%20of%20the%20Dead\"&gt;:The Codex of the Dead&lt;/a&gt;\", Toranaar's warblades howled over the clamor of battle, rending anything that came near. Each demon he vanquished seemed to fill him with renewed vigor, and he was like \"an army unto himself\". However, the Legion's numbers never diminished, and slowly and methodically, the demons whittled away at the aldrachi resistance and pushed them back to the towering stronghold in the center of their capital. There, Toranaar and the few champions that remained, all armed with warblades teeming with the souls of thousands of victims, readied themselves in preparation for another Legion attack. However, that attack never came, and the Legion instead halted its advance. A monstrous figure then emerged from the Legion's ranks: the Dark Titan, Sargeras himself.\nSargeras offered Toranaar and his people power beyond anything they had ever dreamt of. They would serve as his personal guards and command tens of thousands of demons in war, an offer the Dark Titan believed would prove irresistible to the battle-loving race. Toranaar, however, emphatically rejected the offer, vowing to destroy the Legion for all of the aldrachi the demons had killed, or die trying. Either way, he would never bow to Sargeras.\nWhat followed was a duel between the champion of the aldrachi and the lord of the Burning Legion. The gathered Legion host watched with rapt attention as Sargeras dueled with Toranaar. The Dark Titan could have simply annihilated his foe at any moment, but he did not seek to destroy Toranaar, but to corrupt him. For days, Sargeras battered the aldrachi with just enough force to wear him down. Toranaar recognized Sargeras' ploy and knew that he could not best the Legion's ruler in combat. Thus, he decided on one final act of defiance by feigning submission. When Sargeras let his guard down, Toranaar struck, his warblades ripping through the titan's hide and drawing his molten blood. Though it was only a minor injury, the other aldrachi howled in triumph.\nInfuriated by Toranaar's defiance, Sargeras instantly ripped him and his fellow aldrachi champions to pieces, leaving nothing of their bodies but dust. The Legion's ruler then commanded his armies to bathe the aldrachi world in an inferno that would smolder for eternity.\nLegacy.\nThough the attempt to corrupt the aldrachi had failed, the warblades of Toranaar and his kin remained intact. Sargeras gave the warblades to his lieutenant, &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;, and ordered him to distribute them to the Legion's greatest warriors. In time, Kil'jaeden had distributed all of the warblades, save Toranaar's, the most powerful arms taken from the aldrachi. The demon lord kept the last set of warblades under close watch for years, until he found someone worthy of wielding them: &lt;a href=\"Caria%20Felsoul\"&gt;Caria Felsoul&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"demon%20hunter\"&gt;demon hunter&lt;/a&gt; who had willingly turned against her &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt; allies. In her hands, the instruments of dignity and defiance would become tools of betrayal and murder."}

Toravon was introduced along with Arena Season 8 and the final wing of &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt; on February 2, 2010.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt; came to the Vault to find a way to defeat the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s, the giant brothers who made it their home were less than cordial when he arrived, still furious after their previous encounters with the adventurers from both factions.\nStrategies.\nThis is a fairly simple fight where the boss has 2 interesting abilities.\nFirstly, he will spawn Frozen Orbs (1 in 10 man, 3 in 25) which pass through the raid, ticking AoE frost damage within a fairly wide radius. These need to be killed quickly as he will cast Whiteout soon afterwards, which does large raidwide damage. Whiteout stacks a debuff which will increases frost damage taken, so each cast imparts more damage on the raid. If the orbs are not taken down, healers will not have had a chance to top up the raid and people with damage will start dying to Whiteouts. \nMelee hits from Toravon will start stacking a Frostbite debuff which adds a significant DoT to the damage taken. A 2 tank setup will need to taunt Toravon as the debuff on the other tank reaches 4 stacks, which allows time for their own to clear. At the start, tanks can handle a higher number of stacks, but as the raid gets more stacks of the Whiteout debuff it makes harder for healers to keep tanks alive. In addition, he sometimes immobilizes the tanks using Freezing Ground. This will prevent the tanks from dodging Frozen Orb.\nThe original advice on this raid has been to spread out to avoid multiple raid members taking hits from the frozen orbs, but this may make it harder for AoE healers to keep people up. With reasonable raid healers, the best tactic appears to be to take down the frozen orbs as soon as possible (even using melee dps if the raid is short on ranged) to allow the healers time to top up the raid before the Whiteout. If people take damage for longer by avoiding instead of DPSing the orbs, the chances of deaths on the next Whiteout increase significantly.\nHealing will get more difficult as the raid gets more stacks of the whiteout debuff, but a 2 tank, 2 AoE healer, 6 dps setup in 10 man or 2 tank, 5 healer (one tank healer), 18 dps setup in 25 man has been seen to succeed.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

This guide is by no means the only way to complete the quest; if your method works for you, stay with it.\n\"Where did it go?\".\nYou toss that torch, and pft!, it's gone. The first toss is the longest, highest, and easiest to lose. However, it's also the most predictable: if you start at the same spot near the bonfire, it's always going to fly in approximately the same direction and land in the same general area. Test run: pick a tracking method below, let fly, run in the launch direction, and get a feel for where you will need to be when it lands. If you can't even tell where it's landing, you're probably not running far enough. The torch doesn't travel \"quite\" as fast as you run, but you don't have a lot of time to stand around.\nTrack from Above.\nTo maximize the view here, go to Interface, Camera, MAKE NOTE of your current settings, and set the following: Follow Terrain - uncheck, Max Camera Distance - High, Camera Following Style - Never adjust camera. Click Okay and return to game. Now angle the camera so you are looking straight down and zoom all the way out. You should be now able to see the torch for all tosses except the first one.\nTrack from Below.\nZoom all the way in so your toon disappears, and look straight up.\n\"Note: Since tracking from above is pretty much how you play the rest of the game, it is more intuitive and less disorienting than from below. However, from below is the only way never to lose sight of the torch. Use what works best for you.\"\nd\nFollow that Shadow.\nAnother trick is to take note where the shadow of the torch is on the ground. This trick works best in places of even ground such as Ironforge or Orgrimmar. By following the shadow you can run in a straight line, making sure that you stay slightly ahead of it so that when the torch finally falls it will land right before your toon.\n\"There it is! But I can't...get there...fast enough!\nA moment after you catch the torch, it launches itself in a random direction \"behind\" you, and there's just not enough time to turn around and catch up to it. First, make sure you have any fast forms or Aspects you have are active (&lt;a href=\"Hunter\"&gt;Hunter&lt;/a&gt;s/&lt;a href=\"Shaman\"&gt;Shaman&lt;/a&gt;s/&lt;a href=\"Druid\"&gt;Druid&lt;/a&gt;s. The rest is skill... \nKeyboard Method.\nThe key to success is staying a step ahead. This technique requires the use of your \"Strafing\" keys (default Q and E). Strafing allows you to run \"at full speed\" directly to the left or right of the direction you are facing. If you're not comfortable with strafing, take a minute to play around with it, especially combining it with your normal movement keys to understand the effects that it has, and the different directions you can move.\nOnce you're comfortable with strafing, try a torch run with it. Position yourself facing 90 degrees to the direction the torch will fly, since you will be strafing to get to it. You can use your other movement keys to adjust your position forward and backward (to the right and left of the torch's path, since you're moving sideways) as you run.\nNow, if you are equally comfortable strafing and moving in both directions, then when you catch the torch, you can just start strafing back the other way. However, many players find they are more comfortable strafing in one direction. If so, as soon as the you catch the torch, start turning to face the direction you just came from. Since you were running sideways, you only have 90 degrees to turn instead of 180. This makes all the difference in the world. The next torch may not fly exactly that direction, but it will \"always\" fly somewhere within the 180 degrees in front of you now; which means, with strafe in your arsenal, you can always start running full speed towards it as soon as it launches.\nAs the torch rises and you get in front of it, turn so you're strafing again; so, again, you will only have 90 degrees to turn once you catch it.\nMouse Method.\nIf you only have two mouse keys and no mouse wheel, you may have to stick with the Keyboard Method. \nIf you've never tried moving with your mouse, give this method a shot. It can be very tricky, as your turn speed is not constant as with keys, but rather is relative to the speed at which you move your mouse; but some people quickly adapt to this method and never go back.\nEnabling.\nUnder Options (Esc), Key Bindings, Movement Keys; assign Move and Steer to one of your mouse keys, and hit Okay. \nIf you have a mouse wheel, your wheel may also actually be a button. To find out, click next to Move and Steer under either Key 1 or Key 2 (this generates a \"Press Key to Bind to Command -&gt; Move and Steer\" message at the bottom of the window) and immediately press down on your wheel (without turning it) as you do you other mouse keys. If you see \"Middle Mouse\" appear, your wheel is also a button! NOTE: as with \"all\" changes to Key Bindings, make sure you did not just get a red warning message at the bottom of the window saying \"&lt;Such-and-such&gt; Function is Now Unbound!\" If you do, make sure the next button you click is Cancel.\nUsing.\nSimplicity itself. Hold down the mouse key you assigned above. You will run as long as the button is down, and turn however you move your mouse. When you catch the torch, just whip the mouse around until you are facing the right way.\nAdjustments.\nUnder Options (Esc), Interface, Mouse: "}

In addition, you can buy a stack of 5 for from &lt;a href=\"Midsummer%20Merchant\"&gt;Midsummer Merchant&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"Midsummer%20Supplier\"&gt;Midsummer Supplier&lt;/a&gt;s, and you also receive 5 from &lt;a href=\"Torch%20Catching%20%28Horde%29\"&gt;Torch Catching (Horde)&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=\"Torch%20Catching%20%28Alliance%29\"&gt;Torch Catching (Alliance)&lt;/a&gt;.\nStrategy.\nCollect a minimum of 10 . Some people have reported doing it with as few as 8, but it is common to have 9 in the air at the same time, so 10 or more is recommended. Note that the tooltip says you must \"know how to juggle\" to catch them; this means you must have completed &lt;a href=\"Torch%20Catching\"&gt;Torch Catching&lt;/a&gt;.\nOpen your Achievements window, find \"Torch Juggler\" under World Events/Midsummer, and click \"Track\" to watch your progress.\nMake sure you are in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;; you will see no progress if you aren't in Dalaran. Further, you should be somewhere secluded, to decrease lag and minimize interruption by bystanders. Since the torches are a targeted effect, anyone (at random) in the area of effect may catch the torch. Hover over the Game Menu (computer) button on your toolbar or turn on Framerate (FPS) Display (Ctrl-R; or Options, Key Bindings, Miscellaneous Functions, Toggle Framerate Display) and check the FPS in various areas - higher is better. Also note you can usually substantially increase low FPS by standing in a corner, pointing your camera straight down, and zooming all the way in (eliminating required animations).\nDrag the torches to an ActionBar key you have mapped to your keyboard (a hotkey).\nHit the hotkey with your non-mouse hand, then click the ground below you. There is almost no cooldown on the torches, so you can toss torches almost as fast as you can click. Using a hotkey means you don't have to move the mouse. \nTwo or more can complete this achievement together by tossing to each other. This is also more showy, and more subject to lag and interruption by bystanders. More total torches are required, because each player will have torches in the air.\nWhichever method you choose, you should use the first 15 seconds just to get up to speed. The counter will automatically reset, and you will already have torches in the air; so don't stop after the counter reaches zero - just keep mashing away.\nTry them and see which works best for you; but whichever does, persistence and high FPS are the key.\nIsolated locations.\nSome sample isolated locations\nNotes.\nThe timer for this starts once the first torch is caught. As it takes a second or two for the torch to come down, the timer may not start immediately."}

He was orphaned at a very young age.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Keda%20Bloomblade\"&gt;Keda Bloomblade&lt;/a&gt; fell in love with Toreth but lacked the confidence to tell him, instead often turning clumsy and awkward in his presence. After a ceremony in which Keda was honored for having defended a shrine from a &lt;a href=\"bog%20beast\"&gt;bog beast&lt;/a&gt;, Toreth approached her to ask her questions about the battle. This gave her the idea to impress him and work up the courage to confess her feelings by performing feats of heroism. She began throwing herself against increasingly dangerous foes and, as expected, got to speak with Toreth after each battle. He began inviting her for tea, but she continued to feel too embarrassed to accept his offers until her friend, the &lt;a href=\"alchemist\"&gt;alchemist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Elyrion%20Fogsong\"&gt;Elyrion Fogsong&lt;/a&gt;, had her collect ingredients for a potion that would give her bravery.\nThe potion caused Keda to finally agree to have tea with the Lorekeeper. They began meeting regularly, with Toreth one night inviting Keda to the roof of the Sentinel barracks to watch a migration of &lt;a href=\"glowmoth\"&gt;glowmoth&lt;/a&gt;s. He told her that there was more to life than service and battle, and the two shared a kiss. Weeks later, Keda revealed what it was that caused her to start courting Toreth, but he\u2014having studied a bit of alchemy himself\u2014revealed that all of the ingredients she'd collected for Elyrion were useless. He added that, as Lorekeeper, he was familiar with the alchemist's personal history: his &lt;a href=\"Ellaene\"&gt;wife&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arietta\"&gt;daughter&lt;/a&gt; were killed in battle. Toreth and Keda sought out the alchemist at reclusive home. He told them about his lost family and of how he preferred to live alone rather than risk suffering such a loss again, but Keda told him that he was worthy of having a family again and managed to convince him to return to the village with her and Toreth."}

It sits at the center of the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt;. Torghast is an endlessly replayable, ever-changing dungeon that can be challenged alone or in a group. Each run will differ, and adventurers will need to explore cautiously, as death comes at a terrible cost. Advance through Torghast's unpredictable challenges to unlock anima powers to enhance damage output or survivability. The goal is &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Ash\"&gt;Soul Ash&lt;/a&gt;, used to craft the legendary weapons and armor that will help restore balance to the Shadowlands.\nHistory.\nTorghast is the seat of power for &lt;a href=\"the%20Jailer\"&gt;the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, the ruler of the Maw. It serves as an eternal prison for the most dangerous souls in the cosmos and is one of the most dangerous towers in all of existence. Like the Maw itself, the power of &lt;a href=\"Domination\"&gt;Domination&lt;/a&gt; is woven into Torghast's very fabric, and the Jailer's malevolence permeates everything within it. It is a place devoid of all hope or redemption. Each floor that rises into the endless abyss is crueler than the last; to climb Torghast is to ascend deeper into despair. The tower's interior defies all traditional logic: its corridors are vast and seemingly endless, to the point where one could spend an eternity wandering them, and they are constantly shifting and changing according to the will of the Jailer. The deeper one journeys into Torghast, the closer one also gets to the Jailer himself.\nGaining access and storyline.\nTorghast is unlocked through a quest chain, started by &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Oribos\"&gt;Oribos&lt;/a&gt;. Max-level players must first pledge themselves to one of the Covenants and complete the first chapter of their covenant campaign, at which point they will be offered &lt;a href=\"The%20Highlord%20Calls\"&gt;The Highlord Calls&lt;/a&gt;, a breadcrumb back to Bolvar in Oribos.\nFor alts, access to Torghast is on an account-wide basis. Unlock access on one character and all subsequent characters will gain access after reaching level 60.\nThe campaign covers freeing some of the characters that were left behind and unlocking the &lt;a href=\"Runecarver\"&gt;Runecarver&lt;/a&gt;. Quests are generally offered on a weekly basis, or on a 20-hour time gate for players who are catching up. If Bolvar does not immediately offer a follow-up quest, check back with him 20 hours later.\nTower mechanics.\nA normal Torghast run is composed of five floors, with increasingly powerful enemies on higher floors.\nFound or dropped anima cells unlock &lt;a href=\"anima%20power\"&gt;anima power&lt;/a&gt;s, which can drastically change how runs are played out, by unlocking some temporary abilities.\nSouls can be freed, and will stack an untimed +1% primary stat (agility/intellect/strength) buff for the duration of the run.\nFriendly NPCs will offer optional side quests near the beginning of a floor, asking players to find another friendly NPC or an object near the end of a floor, or kill a specific enemy, and will award an anima cache on completion.\nTreasure chests can occasionally be found, and will need to be opened with three keys found elsewhere in the floor, or via solving lever puzzles.\nWings, layers, and floors.\nPlayers first arrive in the &lt;a href=\"Torghast%20Antechamber\"&gt;Torghast Antechamber&lt;/a&gt;, which provides access to all of the wings. Torghast is divided into six primary wings, with eight layers of five floors per layer. All wings play similarly, but each wing has its own twist on a mechanic.\nA normal Torghast run is of a single five-floor layer. Floors have the following pattern:\nBefore patch 9.1, layers had six floors, with two floors of enemies before and after the break room on floor three. Each floor raises the difficulty incrementally by increasing enemy health, the mix of enemies spawned, the size of spawn packs, and the damage enemies deal. Higher layers raise the difficulty even further.\nAt expansion and patch 9.1 launch, higher layers were locked behind a weekly gate:\nPlayers must complete a run with a high enough score on any given layer to unlock the next. The layer-unlocking carries over between the six primary wings. For example, once players complete layer five in Skoldus Halls, they will be able to attempt layer six in Skoldus or any of the other wings, like Coldheart Interstitia. However, the layer-unlocking does not apply to the Twisting Corridors, which keeps track of its own layer unlocks.\nBlizzard suggests the following item levels to complete layers of the normal six wings of Torghast, and of the Twisting Corridors (TC):\nScoring.\nInstead of a binary pass-fail measure of success\u2014either the layer boss died or the party ran out of lives\u2014patch 9.1 introduced a numerical scoring mechanic, in which layer unlocks are tied to getting a good enough score. Higher scores grant more &lt;a href=\"Tower%20Knowledge\"&gt;Tower Knowledge&lt;/a&gt;, which can then be used at &lt;a href=\"%23The%20Box%20of%20Many%20Things\"&gt;The Box of Many Things&lt;/a&gt; to unlock permanent perks.\nThe points-based score is both time- and completion-driven. Each 40 points earned adds one star to the score. Points are granted for things such as completing a run under a par time (much like in &lt;a href=\"Mythic%2B\"&gt;Mythic+&lt;/a&gt;), quickly killing enemies to stay &lt;a href=\"%23Empowered\"&gt;empowered&lt;/a&gt;, breaking &lt;a href=\"Ashen%20Phylactery\"&gt;ashen phylacteries&lt;/a&gt;, looting chests, freeing &lt;a href=\"%23Soul%20remnants\"&gt;souls&lt;/a&gt;, and completing &lt;a href=\"%23Captured%20souls%20and%20bonus%20objectives\"&gt;bonus objectives&lt;/a&gt;. \"Completion\" is a large portion of the overall score, and to five-star a run players will need to kill/save/loot just about everything. After defeating the layer boss, the score display will appear and Tower Knowledge will be granted.\nPlayers must get four or five stars in a run to unlock the next layer. Get a five-star run to earn the achievement &lt;a href=\"A%20Taste%20of%20Perfection\"&gt;A Taste of Perfection&lt;/a&gt;. Five-star runs on layers 9 and above will grant access to the &lt;a href=\"%23Adamant%20Vaults\"&gt;Adamant Vaults&lt;/a&gt; once unlocked from &lt;a href=\"%23The%20Box%20of%20Many%20Things\"&gt;The Box of Many Things&lt;/a&gt;. Achieve flawless runs on layer 12 of all six wings to earn the achievement &lt;a href=\"Flawless%20Master%20%28Layer%2012%29\"&gt;Flawless Master (Layer 12)&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe bulk of the score comes from:\nOther tasks/goals/accomplishments will add or subtract points:\nOne other change in patch 9.1 is that layer bosses will not reset to full health after a wipe, and there is no longer a hard death limit. Players can die as much as they like, though their score will suffer, but as long as they eventually kill the boss at the end, they will still get their &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Ash\"&gt;Soul Ash&lt;/a&gt; and/or &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Cinders\"&gt;Soul Cinders&lt;/a&gt;.\nPermanent upgrades.\nSo that players are constantly improving their odds of success, they will earn currency (both within the tower and without) that can be used to permanently upgrade their power in the tower.\nThe Box of Many Things.\nIn &lt;a href=\"patch%209.1\"&gt;patch 9.1&lt;/a&gt;, players will unlock &lt;a href=\"The%20Box%20of%20Many%20Things\"&gt;The Box of Many Things&lt;/a&gt;, which serves as a Torghast-specific talent tree. Complete runs to earn &lt;a href=\"Tower%20Knowledge\"&gt;Tower Knowledge&lt;/a&gt;, then feed that knowledge to the box to unlock permanent perks. Such perks include:\nThe Box of Many Things does not apply in the &lt;a href=\"%23Twisting%20Corridors\"&gt;Twisting Corridors&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlayers will gain Tower Knowledge based on the layer they complete and the &lt;a href=\"%23Scoring\"&gt;star rating&lt;/a&gt; they earn:\nVe'nari.\n&lt;a href=\"Ve%27nari\"&gt;Ve'nari&lt;/a&gt;, at &lt;a href=\"Ve%27nari%27s%20Refuge\"&gt;her refuge&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt; exchanges &lt;a href=\"Stygia\"&gt;Stygia&lt;/a&gt; for some permanent upgrades to a few mechanics in Torghast. The non-consumable items are account-wide, and only need to be purchased on one character.\nUpgrades include:\nSoul ash and cinders.\nOnce per week, layer bosses will drop &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Ash\"&gt;Soul Ash&lt;/a&gt;, with the amount increasing based on the layer cleared. Soul ash is used by the &lt;a href=\"Runecarver\"&gt;Runecarver&lt;/a&gt; to make equipment, with a base (item level 190) item costing 1250 Soul Ash. Only the six normal wing bosses will drop Soul Ash - bosses in the Twisting Corridors or any quest-specific wings will not have any Ash to loot.\nIn an effort to not force players to run every layer in a wing, they can skip back to that layer in future runs. The end boss will drop all soul ash from lower layers. Thus, if players skip to layer three for their first run of a week, they will loot 460 Soul Ash from the wing boss, as seen in the table. Afterwards, should the player clear layer 4 of the same wing, they will come up with 105 more Soul Ash.\nBy virtue of two wings being available each week, should players manage to full-clear both wings they will gain 2080 Soul Ash each week through layer 12.\nIn &lt;a href=\"patch%209.1\"&gt;patch 9.1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Cinders\"&gt;Soul Cinders&lt;/a&gt; will start dropping from the new layers 9-12. Cinders are used alongside soul ash to upgrade legendaries above item level 235. Additionally, layers that have already been cleared in a given week will drop a small portion of their soul ash on re-clears. For example, a layer six reclear is worth 146 ash. Furthermore, Soul Ash drop rate was increased by roughly 50%, so instead of getting 570 ash for clearing an eight, players will receive 860 instead.\nPhantasma and brokers.\n&lt;a href=\"Phantasma\"&gt;Phantasma&lt;/a&gt; is the Torghast run-specific currency. Most mobs and &lt;a href=\"Ashen%20Phylactery\"&gt;ashen phylacteries&lt;/a&gt; will drop some Phantasma, which can then be traded in to &lt;a href=\"Broker%20Ve%27ken\"&gt;brokers Ve'ken&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Broker%20Ve%27nott\"&gt;Ve'nott&lt;/a&gt; on floors three and five for a selection of anima powers. Phantasma cannot be carried over between runs, and will be lost should players exit Torghast prematurely or end their runs normally after defeating the layer boss.\nBrokers offer a selection of anima powers, and some special items, not all of which are available on each broker, including:\nIn layers nine and above, the brokers occasionally sell transmog cosmetic pieces and even toys if players have Stygia to spare for each, including:\nAnima powers.\n&lt;a href=\"Anima%20power\"&gt;Anima power&lt;/a&gt;s are gained by interacting with anima caches that can be found scattered about, either just spawned out in the open, dropped by mobs, rewarded from completing bonus objectives, or found in treasure chests or selected ashen phylacteries. Each selected power will modify the rest of the run. Many powers can be stacked, increasing the effect of the power.\nThere are hundreds of unique anima powers. Common powers are available to all players (straight stat or health increases like &lt;a href=\"Obleron%20Spikes\"&gt;Obleron Spikes&lt;/a&gt;, or general powers like &lt;a href=\"Curious%20Miasma\"&gt;Curious Miasma&lt;/a&gt;), while others are class- or spec- based (like &lt;a href=\"Dimensional%20Blade%20%28anima%20power%29\"&gt;Dimensional Blade (anima power)&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Blink\"&gt;Blink&lt;/a&gt; through a &lt;a href=\"Mawrat\"&gt;Mawrat&lt;/a&gt; to kill it instantly and gain bonus Blink charges), and there are &lt;a href=\"covenant\"&gt;covenant&lt;/a&gt;-based powers as well (like &lt;a href=\"Strigidium\"&gt;Strigidium&lt;/a&gt;: your summoned steward can heal or buff you in combat).\nAnima powers can also synergize with previously-selected anima powers. For instance, mages can select &lt;a href=\"Everwarm%20Socks\"&gt;Everwarm Socks&lt;/a&gt; to move while under an &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Block\"&gt;Ice Block&lt;/a&gt;, then they can later choose &lt;a href=\"Creeping%20Freeze\"&gt;Creeping Freeze&lt;/a&gt;, which freezes enemies that are near the mage while it moves when Ice Blocked.\nEmpowerment.\nIn &lt;a href=\"patch%209.1\"&gt;patch 9.1&lt;/a&gt;, part of the Torghast interface is the Empowerment bar. Fill the bar by slaying enemies, freeing souls, and breaking urns. Once the bar crosses the threshold, activate the ability using the bonus action:\nThe higher the bar is before players use it, the longer they will stay Empowered. The empowerment bar will reset to zero on deaths. Additionally, some &lt;a href=\"%23The%20Box%20of%20Many%20Things\"&gt;The Box of Many Things&lt;/a&gt; perks modify the length of time players remain Empowered, or the Empowered effect:\nBeyond that, some anima powers can be picked up during runs that trigger while players are Empowered, including:\nAdamant Vaults.\nUnlocked via &lt;a href=\"The%20Box%20of%20Many%20Things\"&gt;The Box of Many Things&lt;/a&gt;, players who five-gem a layer 9-12 Torghast run by &lt;a href=\"%23Scoring\"&gt;scoring at least 200 points&lt;/a&gt; can choose to continue their run in the Adamant Vaults. The vaults consist of two floors, one regular floor with enemies and one boss floor with the traditional broker vendor. Defeating one of the following three possible bosses grants bonus Tower Knowledge: &lt;a href=\"Vault%20Aegis\"&gt;Vault Aegis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Troz%27igal%20the%20Oppressor\"&gt;Troz'igal the Oppressor&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Vault%20Sentinel%20%28Adamant%20Vaults%29\"&gt;Vault Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;.\nTorments and Blessings.\nTorments and blessings change up runs of Torghast.\n9.0 Torments.\nPreviously in all wings, but as of patch 9.1 only in the Twisting Corridors, wing-based torments will be added to the mix. The effect increases on every floor (with the exception of the break room on floor three). So, if an enemy has +5% health on floor 1, it will have +20% health on floor five. Higher layers start with additional stacks of the buff. So on layer five, the first floor will have three stacks. Torments include:\n9.1 Torments.\nIn &lt;a href=\"patch%209.1\"&gt;patch 9.1&lt;/a&gt;, the torments system changes. Starting on layer six, players will be affected by at least one torment. These torments vary by day and by wing (that is, Skoldus Hall and Coldheart Interstitia will have different torments active each day), but they are shared across players. More torments will be unleashed concurrently on higher layers.\nPlayers can spend &lt;a href=\"Tower%20Knowledge\"&gt;Tower Knowledge&lt;/a&gt; to reduce the amount of Torments afflicted upon them:\nTorments include:\nOne blessing and three torments have achievements attached to them. Earn all four blessing/torment-related achievements to earn the meta-achievement &lt;a href=\"Master%20of%20Torment\"&gt;Master of Torment&lt;/a&gt;.\nBlessings.\nBlessings are unlocked from &lt;a href=\"%23The%20Box%20of%20Many%20Things\"&gt;The Box of Many Things&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"patch%209.1\"&gt;patch 9.1&lt;/a&gt;, and players can invest &lt;a href=\"Tower%20Knowledge\"&gt;Tower Knowledge&lt;/a&gt; to gain up to three blessings per run:\nJust like with Torments, they vary by day and by wing, but are the same for all players. At rank three, players will be awarded the achievement &lt;a href=\"So%20Blessed\"&gt;So Blessed&lt;/a&gt;.\nBlessings include:\nSoul remnants.\nSoul remnants are a common sight in Torghast - Once freed, they will give the last of their strength in the form of the buff Soul Remnant's Blessing, which increases agility/intellect/strength by 1% per soul saved in Torghast. The Soulforges wing has a special variant that instead can provide a stacking 10% crit damage/healing and 10% haste buff, but it only lasts for three minutes.\nSuch souls include:\nThe Jailer's Chains.\nOutside of very few exceptions, players are prevented from adjusting their equipment, talents, or specializations while on a run. The exceptions include at the entrance of the first floor, and near the broker on the third floor, who provides Refuge of the Damned:\nDeaths.\nUntil &lt;a href=\"patch%209.1\"&gt;patch 9.1&lt;/a&gt;, players (or the party) are allotted a set amount of deaths per run, starting with five for solo players and scaling up to 15 for a party of five. These deaths are spread across the party, and not that each player has fifteen deaths each. Once the death counter reaches zero, the very next death will trigger a 30-second timer. Once that timer expires, &lt;a href=\"The%20Tarragrue\"&gt;The Tarragrue&lt;/a&gt; spawns at the beginning of the floor and slowly walks all the way to the exit.\nThe tarragrue will one-shot any players it comes across. Should the entire party die or the tarragrue reach the end of the floor, the run will end and the Jailer will eject players from the tower. Drop everything and get to the end of the floor to continue the run, but be warned that more deaths will spawn another tarragrue on the next floor.\nIn patch 9.1, &lt;a href=\"The%20Tarragrue%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;The Tarragrue&lt;/a&gt; will be occupied by being a boss in the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Sanctum of Domination&lt;/a&gt; raid, so the death counter mechanic will be removed in the tower. Deaths still negatively affect scoring, but there is no hard limit on deaths on any given run.\nWings.\nInitially, players must complete the tutorial wing, Arkoban Hall, then a selection of two wings are made available each week. Late in the primary quest line, players will unlock access to the Twisting Corridors, a special challenge mode wing, which is always accessible from then on.\nSkoldus Hall.\n\"Skoldus Hall is but one of Torghast's countless cell blocks. &lt;a href=\"Warden%20Skoldus\"&gt;Warden Skoldus&lt;/a&gt; utilizes beasts, chains, and traps to torment his prisoners as well as those who intrude upon his domain.\"\nSkoldus Hall is the baseline version of Torghast.\nEnemies include:\nFracture Chambers.\n\"Within the Fracture Chambers, prisoners from across the Shadowlands have their bones endlessly broken and mended in a cruel cycle of torture. Release them so they might claim their vengeance.\"\nFull of necromancy and with a green theme, skeletal mobs in the Fracture Chambers, like &lt;a href=\"Lumbering%20Creation\"&gt;Lumbering Creation&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"Skeletal%20Remains\"&gt;Skeletal Remains&lt;/a&gt;, explode when they die for a decent chunk of damage. Large packs of Skeletal Remains are notorious for this -- make sure to not kill them all point-blank, or the feedback may kill the player in return... Unlike exploding &lt;a href=\"Mawrat\"&gt;Mawrat&lt;/a&gt;s, this damage only affects players so this cannot be used to clear out packs of enemies.\nEnemies include:\nThe Soulforges.\n\"Doomed souls are brought to the Soulforges to be melted down into weapons and armor for the Jailer's army. Beware the rampant flames that burn within these falls.\"\nIn the lava and fire-filled Soulforges, the &lt;a href=\"Partially-Infused%20Soul%20Remnant\"&gt;Partially-Infused Soul Remnant&lt;/a&gt;s found here have been partially bound into armor. Players can choose to finish the binding ritual, gaining a stacking +10% crit damage/healing and +10% haste buff for three minutes, or they can be freed as normal for the usual untimed 1% agility/intellect/strength buff.\nEnemies include:\nColdheart Interstitia.\n\"Suspended between the towering spires of Torghast, the Coldheart Interstitia is where the &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kyrian%23Mawsworn\"&gt;kyrian&lt;/a&gt; make their lair. Striking from above, they fling foolhardy interlopers into the darkness below.\"\nThink teal and Mawsworn kyrian in the Coldheart Interstitia. Watch out for the ambushers!\nEnemies include:\nMort'regar.\n\"Like the shifting and malformed terrain itself, the souls trapped within Mort'regar have lost all semblance of who they once were. The Jailer's forces subject them to necromantic experiments, transforming them into horrible monstrosities.\"\nIn Mort'regar, the corpses of most mobs slowly spread Death Pools that \"do not despawn\". Take care to avoid killing them in inconvenient spots. Additionally, &lt;a href=\"Deadsoul%20Spirit\"&gt;Deadsoul Spirit&lt;/a&gt;s cannot be fully killed, and will respawn after 30 seconds with 40% health.\nEnemies include:\nThe Upper Reaches.\n\"The Upper Reaches are the domain of the Jailer's most devoted servants. Elite &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt; forces and their &lt;a href=\"Venthyr\"&gt;Venthyr&lt;/a&gt; allies patrol these halls and maintain their master's most powerful defenses.\"\nThe Upper Reaches is the most prison-like wing of the tower. Fewer anima cells, ashen phylacteries, and freeable soul remnants are around, limiting the power gains as well. Many enemies from previous wings make an appearance.\nTwisting Corridors.\n\"True to their name, the Twisting Corridors wind unpredictably throughout the entirety of Torghast's myriad cell blocks and are guarded by all manner of the Jailer's minions. Those intrepid enough to venture into its 18 floors seldom return.\"\nFor players seeking cosmetic rewards, the Twisting Corridors will stitch together three wings of floors for a total of 18 floors (six per wing), with the usual break rooms on the third floor and a boss on the sixth. No &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Ash\"&gt;Soul Ash&lt;/a&gt; will be found here. In a small concession to run time, floors are generally much smaller than in normal wing runs; usually a small or medium-sized room per floor. Twisting Corridor wings can be from any of the other six wings listed above, and it is possible two have two Corridor wings be of the same Torghast wing in a row (i.e. first wing is Skoldus Hall, second is Mort'regar, but third is Skoldus Hall again). The difficulty rises steadily within a given wing like normal, and jumps in difficulty between wings.\nIn Layer 3 and above, the standard torments start applying. Players will gain five stacks of a torment over the six floors of each layer, and that debuff will persist for the rest of the run. Should players wind up in the same wing again, the debuff will continue to stack.\nUnlike the normal six wings, &lt;a href=\"%23The%20Box%20of%20Many%20Things\"&gt;The Box of Many Things&lt;/a&gt; does not apply in the Twisting Corridors, and the &lt;a href=\"%239.0%20Torments\"&gt;9.0 torments&lt;/a&gt; will remain active in &lt;a href=\"patch%209.1\"&gt;patch 9.1&lt;/a&gt;.\nCompleting specified Twisting Corridors layers will grant cosmetic rewards:\nQuests.\nPlayers are directed to Torghast several times in the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands%20campaign\"&gt;Shadowlands campaign&lt;/a&gt;. The first time is late in the &lt;a href=\"Revendreth%20storyline\"&gt;Revendreth storyline&lt;/a&gt; when &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Renathal\"&gt;Prince Renathal&lt;/a&gt;, freed from a cage in the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt; sneaks himself, the &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Walker\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt;, and his enchanted sword into Torghast during &lt;a href=\"Torghast%2C%20Tower%20of%20the%20Damned%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Torghast, Tower of the Damned (quest)&lt;/a&gt; to free some more allies.\nLater, after players have joined their &lt;a href=\"covenant\"&gt;covenant&lt;/a&gt;, the second chapter of their covenant campaign will send them to Torghast multiple times to be introduced to the wings and to free some Azerothian champions. Additionally, they will unlock access to the &lt;a href=\"Runecarver\"&gt;Runecarver&lt;/a&gt;, who will create and upgrade items over the course of the expansion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Chains%20of%20Domination%20campaign\"&gt;Chains of Domination campaign&lt;/a&gt;, players are directed into the tower to find &lt;a href=\"Uther\"&gt;Uther&lt;/a&gt;'s soul fragment, taken from him when he was slain by &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt;.\nOther notable inhabitants.\nSome notable characters have been captured, and part of the storyline is freeing them, including:\nCaptured souls and bonus objectives.\nCaptured souls offer a bonus objective, and after completing it, can become the Maw Walker's follower in their covenant sanctum for &lt;a href=\"Adventures\"&gt;Adventures&lt;/a&gt;. Players will eventually be able to come up with eight followers for their adventures - six covenant-bound and two neutral.\nAdditionally, there are a handful of frequent-flyer quest givers that the Maw Walker does not save -- they will continually reappear in Torghast."}

The encounter is started by someone using a &lt;a href=\"Mist-Filled%20Spirit%20Lantern\"&gt;Mist-Filled Spirit Lantern&lt;/a&gt; at the glowing &lt;a href=\"Cursed%20Gravestone\"&gt;Cursed Gravestone&lt;/a&gt; in the strand, which drops from &lt;a href=\"Evermaw\"&gt;Evermaw&lt;/a&gt;, the rare elite &lt;a href=\"whale%20shark\"&gt;whale shark&lt;/a&gt; circling the island. The gravestone has an hour-long cooldown, so even if multiple players loot the spirit lantern from Evermaw, it can only be summoned once every 60 minutes. Also of important note is that Dread Ship Vazuvius has an \"enrage\" timer; if it is not killed within a certain amount of time after combat starts, it sails away and soon despawns.\nStrategy.\nPlayers cannot get within the hitbox of the ship, as it will knock back roughly 100 yards back into the water. On either side of the ship (port or starboard), the ship-mounted cannons will launch instant Cannon Barrages at players within their line of sight who are foolish enough to stay still long enough to get hit. On deck, skeletal pirates will launch barrels of Burning Pitch at players' positions, spawning pools of fire that tick for 100,000 damage a second while swimming in it. In front of the ship, the large skull launches instant Dark Barrages at players in the front half of the ship.\nThe best strategy for avoiding all the abilities is to swim down to the bottom, then across until you are underneath the ship. (For melee characters: In addition to the previous instruction, swim somewhat upwards until the mob is just within hit range.) This method requires that players pay attention to their &lt;a href=\"Breath\"&gt;Breath&lt;/a&gt; or utilize an item or spell which grants underwater breathing.\nAnother method is to keep moving to avoid the burning pitch, and be try to behind the ship to limit incoming cannon barrages."}

Separated from the rest of &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Serpent%27s%20Spine\"&gt;Serpent's Spine&lt;/a&gt; constructed during the rule of &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen\"&gt;Lei Shen&lt;/a&gt;, the Dread Wastes are the home of the &lt;a href=\"Mantid\"&gt;Mantid&lt;/a&gt;. The landscape is dotted with massive &lt;a href=\"Kypari\"&gt;Kypari&lt;/a&gt; trees that produce the &lt;a href=\"amber\"&gt;amber&lt;/a&gt; which the Mantid utilize in many ways. &lt;a href=\"Klaxxi%27vess\"&gt;Klaxxi'vess&lt;/a&gt; serves as the main quest hub for the zone, but there are two Pandaren settlements, &lt;a href=\"Soggy%27s%20Gamble\"&gt;Soggy's Gamble&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sunset%20Brewgarden\"&gt;Sunset Brewgarden&lt;/a&gt;, that provide additional quests and are necessary for unlocking all of the &lt;a href=\"Paragon\"&gt;Paragons&lt;/a&gt;. \nFollowing the arrival of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and the subsequent release of the &lt;a href=\"Sha\"&gt;Sha&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Sha%20of%20Fear\"&gt;Sha of Fear&lt;/a&gt; possessed &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Empress%20Shek%27zeer\"&gt;Grand Empress Shek'zeer&lt;/a&gt; and began corrupting both the Mantid and the land itself. Even the great Kypari trees began succumbing to the corruption and dying. Faced with no other choice, the &lt;a href=\"Klaxxi\"&gt;Klaxxi&lt;/a&gt; ordered the death of the empress and her fear-driven lieutenants and were successful with the aid of &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s. \nHistory.\nThe Dread Wastes are the &lt;a href=\"mantid\"&gt;mantid&lt;/a&gt; homeland. From here, &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Empress%20Shek%27zeer\"&gt;Grand Empress Shek'zeer&lt;/a&gt; commands a seemingly endless swarm of mantid. They hurl themselves against the &lt;a href=\"Serpent%27s%20Spine\"&gt;Serpent's Spine&lt;/a&gt; wall, nearly overwhelming the &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan\"&gt;Shado-Pan&lt;/a&gt; defenders. Historically, the mantid have swarmed in regular and predictable intervals, but this swarm is about ten years too soon, and the pandaren are caught off-guard. It's not that the Empress is getting more strategic; in fact, her whole society is in the middle of an upheaval.\nShek'zeer has been overwhelmed and possessed by the &lt;a href=\"Sha%20of%20Fear\"&gt;Sha of Fear&lt;/a&gt;, and she's running her empire into the ground. At her command, the mantid are embracing the &lt;a href=\"sha\"&gt;sha&lt;/a&gt;, willfully corrupting themselves, their sacred trees, and the entire ecology of their land. Blind fear has driven the empress onto a warpath and it's tearing her civilization apart. The &lt;a href=\"Klaxxi\"&gt;Klaxxi&lt;/a&gt; however recognize that the empress has lost her mind, and that swarming &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; will mean little if their entire civilization is given over to the sha in the process. Most of the zone focuses around this conflict between the mantid swarm and the Klaxxi, showcasing both the terrible scope of a full-on swarm and the fallout of unchecked sha corruption.\nThe Stormstout family has come to bring the fight directly to the mantid, and have fallen in with the brewmasters of the &lt;a href=\"Sunset%20Brewgarden\"&gt;Sunset Brewgarden&lt;/a&gt; who specialize in brewing with sap from the native &lt;a href=\"kypari%20tree\"&gt;kypari tree&lt;/a&gt;s. Meanwhile, the crew of a wrecked fishing boat has built &lt;a href=\"Soggy%27s%20Gamble\"&gt;Soggy's Gamble&lt;/a&gt;, a ramshackle collection of huts on the southern coast, and is reaping the benefits of being the only &lt;a href=\"Anglers\"&gt;Anglers&lt;/a&gt; beyond the wall.\nGetting there.\nDread Wastes is accessed on foot from either the &lt;a href=\"Dusklight%20Bridge\"&gt;Dusklight Bridge&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Shallowstep%20Pass\"&gt;Shallowstep Pass&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Townlong%20Steppes\"&gt;Townlong Steppes&lt;/a&gt;. It is possible to fly over the &lt;a href=\"Serpent%27s%20Spine\"&gt;Serpent's Spine&lt;/a&gt; from points eastward and to swim around the wall's southern end from &lt;a href=\"Krasarang%20Wilds\"&gt;Krasarang Wilds&lt;/a&gt; as well.\nPlayers who progress far enough in the &lt;a href=\"Townlong%20Steppes\"&gt;Townlong Steppes&lt;/a&gt; zone will be offered a free flight to a &lt;a href=\"Flight%20Point\"&gt;Flight Point&lt;/a&gt; on top of the &lt;a href=\"Serpent%27s%20Spine\"&gt;Serpent's Spine&lt;/a&gt; with quest-givers who start the Dread Wastes quest chain. Ground-bound players who do not want to wait for that quest to become available can travel to the &lt;a href=\"Terrace%20of%20Gurthan\"&gt;Terrace of Gurthan&lt;/a&gt; and find a coil of rope on the ground. Click on the rope to climb to the top and find the flight point and quest-givers.\nGeography.\nThe Dread Wastes are the southern portion of Townlong region separated from the rest of Pandaria mainland by the great wall, &lt;a href=\"Serpent%27s%20Spine\"&gt;Serpent's Spine&lt;/a&gt;. It is very similar to its northern counterpart, except that it apparently became twisted by sinister energies and a dark gloom blankets over the land along with a swath of sha-corrupted soil that has even managed to break through the wall into the Valley of the Four Winds and set the path of war towards the &lt;a href=\"Gate%20of%20the%20Setting%20Sun\"&gt;Gate of the Setting Sun&lt;/a&gt;, with mantid's relentless armies pouring through to conquer and devour everything that stands in their way. In the center of the twisted path stands the imperial palace of the mantid race, known as the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Fear\"&gt;Heart of Fear&lt;/a&gt;, a paragon to the &lt;a href=\"Sha%20of%20Fear\"&gt;Sha of Fear&lt;/a&gt; which took the entire race into its sway through their empress, &lt;a href=\"Shek%27zeer\"&gt;Shek'zeer&lt;/a&gt;. The mantid Kyparis along the path have also been corrupted by the unstable energies. There is one Vess of the mantid in the heart of the Wastes, held by ones that openly rebel against their corrupted empress' madness, the &lt;a href=\"Klaxxi\"&gt;Klaxxi&lt;/a&gt; - keepers of the mantid culture.\nQuests.\nAlthough the Klaxxi are wise and powerful, there aren't very many of them. Although they don't have a standing army, they do have access to the &lt;a href=\"paragon\"&gt;paragon&lt;/a&gt;s: mantid champions from past eras who were preserved in &lt;a href=\"amber\"&gt;amber&lt;/a&gt; at the height of their strength and buried all over the Dread Wastes. Some of them are war masters, others are ingenious alchemists or master assassins. When you first arrive in Dread Wastes, you stumble upon - one of these paragons and wake him up \u2013 he then introduces you to the council, and they allow you to continue waking up paragons to help build their forces. These paragons become your daily questgivers, so as you're waking them up you're also unlocking more dailies. They also provide you with buffs that let you do things like mind control enemies or double-jump while in the Dread Wastes. The quest flow is meant to blend \"level-up\" quest progression with a daily reputation grind, so you begin working with the Klaxxi and earning rep almost immediately after setting foot in the zone. Your progression through the one-shot quests yields direct benefits to the eventual daily experience, and your progression into the higher rep levels through dailies will in turn open up more one-shot story quests.\nResources.\nThe Dread Wastes is the most plentiful place the player can find mineable &lt;a href=\"Kyparite\"&gt;Kyparite&lt;/a&gt; nodes."}

They are the children of the \"Raven God\", &lt;a href=\"Anzu\"&gt;Anzu&lt;/a&gt;, and have close ties to the &lt;a href=\"arakkoa\"&gt;arakkoa&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nThe dread ravens are the children of the Raven God &lt;a href=\"Anzu\"&gt;Anzu&lt;/a&gt;, as the &lt;a href=\"kaliri\"&gt;kaliri&lt;/a&gt; are to &lt;a href=\"Rukhmar\"&gt;Rukhmar&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"wind%20serpent\"&gt;wind serpent&lt;/a&gt;s were to &lt;a href=\"Sethe\"&gt;Sethe&lt;/a&gt;. Long ago, after a battle with Sethe, Anzu was cursed never to fly again. He disappeared into the shadows, later to become the patron God of many flightless &lt;a href=\"arakkoa\"&gt;arakkoa&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Arakkoa%20Outcasts\"&gt;outcasts&lt;/a&gt;. His children, the dangerous and shadowy dread ravens, still populate the &lt;a href=\"Spires%20of%20Arak\"&gt;Spires of Arak&lt;/a&gt; to this day. Fiercely strong and surprisingly intelligent, dread ravens are dangerous when their territory is breached, particularly if their hatchlings are jeopardized. They are a grave threat on land and even more terrifying when they strike from above. Adventurers should be wary of their powerful headbutt or deafening screech. Stronger dread ravens use their wings as weapons, buffeting explorers with winds that threaten to blow them off the spires' high cliffs. &lt;a href=\"Ka%27alu\"&gt;Ka'alu&lt;/a&gt; is the current leader of the dread ravens; Anzu left her to watch over them when he retreated into a world of darkness.\nThe dread ravens seem to have mostly gone extinct when Draenor became &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, likely because they were native to the &lt;a href=\"Spires%20of%20Arak\"&gt;Spires of Arak&lt;/a&gt; which were destroyed. &lt;a href=\"Yikkan%20Izu\"&gt;Yikkan Izu&lt;/a&gt;, who was transported to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; to serve as a &lt;a href=\"Brawler%27s%20Guild\"&gt;Brawler's Guild&lt;/a&gt; gladiator, is one of the few remaining specimens.\nBathed in the blood of &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Reins%20of%20the%20Corrupted%20Dreadwing\"&gt;corrupted dread ravens&lt;/a&gt; are significantly more aggressive, and will often kill one another if kept in confinement.\nAs a companion pet.\n&lt;a href=\"Dread%20Hatchling\"&gt;Dread Hatchling&lt;/a&gt; is granted upon purchase of the \"&lt;a href=\"Warlords%20of%20Draenor%20Collector%27s%20Edition\"&gt;Warlords of Draenor Collector's Edition&lt;/a&gt;\".\nAs a hunter pet.\nDread ravens are tamable by &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s as part of the &lt;a href=\"bird%20of%20prey\"&gt;bird of prey&lt;/a&gt; family.
