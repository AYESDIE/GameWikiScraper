{"id": "17921", "revid": "168424", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=17921", "title": "Magic", "text": "The universe is a realm filled with potent magics (also spelled magiks and magicks, or even called wizardry and sorcery) and mighty beings. Since the dawn of time, these forces have influenced the cosmos, setting the stars in motion and the destiny of countless worlds and mortal civilizations.\nMagical energies are most apparent beneath the earth as well as in special locations - centers of elemental forces, otherworldly powers, and mystical energies. The nature and uses of the forms of magic are vigorously &lt;a href=\"Flavor%20lore\"&gt;debated&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, but the magnitude of what magic can accomplish cannot be doubted.\nThe cosmic forces.\nThe &lt;a href=\"First%20Ones\"&gt;First Ones&lt;/a&gt; are enigmatic &lt;a href=\"god\"&gt;god&lt;/a&gt;like beings who shaped the cosmos and the fabric of all realities. They conceived and put in place the six governing cosmic forces of reality, as well as the pantheons that embody them and the &lt;a href=\"plane\"&gt;realms&lt;/a&gt; that they inhabit. According to the &lt;a href=\"broker\"&gt;broker&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Firim\"&gt;Al'firim&lt;/a&gt;'s interpretations of the First Ones' writings, the cosmos began with six forces (or possibly a different number) existing in opposition to each other until they came together (or were brought together) and gave form to a design. Each \"architect\" gave a portion of themselves, and thus \"the pattern was drawn\". With a framework in place, all things in the universe came to be, like a fungus growing upon the frame. The six forces were now in balance, and others arose from their intersections\u2014a simple structure growing infinitely more complex. The brokers believe that the First Ones made the endless cycle of Life and Death the central part of their creation.\nLight and Shadow.\n&lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Shadow&lt;/a&gt; are the most fundamental forces in existence. Although contradictory by their very nature, they are bound together on a cosmic scale. One cannot exist without the other. Pure Light and Shadow dwell in a &lt;a href=\"plane\"&gt;realm&lt;/a&gt; outside the borders of reality, but shades of their presence are found in the physical universe. Light manifests as &lt;a href=\"holy\"&gt;holy&lt;/a&gt; magic, while Shadow (also called the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;) appears as &lt;a href=\"shadow%20%28magic%29\"&gt;shadow&lt;/a&gt; magic.\nLife and Death.\nThe forces of &lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;Life&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Death\"&gt;Death&lt;/a&gt; hold sway over every living thing in the physical universe. The energies of Life, known commonly as &lt;a href=\"nature\"&gt;nature&lt;/a&gt; magic, promote growth and renewal in all things. Death, in the form of &lt;a href=\"necromancy\"&gt;necromantic&lt;/a&gt; magic, acts as a counterbalance to Life. It is an unavoidable force that breeds despair in mortal hearts and pushes everything toward a state of entropic decay and eventual oblivion.\nOrder and Disorder.\nThe forces of Order and Disorder (also called Chaos) govern the cosmic systems of the physical universe. Order is most commonly perceived in reality as &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; magic. This type of energy is innately volatile, and wielding it requires intense precision and concentration. Conversely, Disorder is manifested as highly destructive &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; magic. This brutal and extremely addictive energy is fueled by drawing life from living beings.\nIt has been hinted that when titans die, their souls would return to their own Order plane.\nThe Elements.\nThe elements of fire, air, earth, and water serve as the basic building blocks of all matter in the physical universe. &lt;a href=\"Shaman\"&gt;Shaman&lt;/a&gt;ic cultures have long sought to live in harmony with, or assert dominion over, the elements. To do so, they called upon the primordial forces of &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20%28lore%29\"&gt;Spirit&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Decay\"&gt;Decay&lt;/a&gt;. Those who seek to bring balance to the elements rely on Spirit (sometimes referred to as the fifth element by shaman, or &lt;a href=\"chi\"&gt;chi&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt;). This life-giving force interconnects and binds all things in existence as one. Decay is the tool of &lt;a href=\"Dark%20shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; seeking to subjugate and weaponize the elements themselves.\nElemental duality.\nElements can influence a variety of emotionally positive and negative states:\nThe seventh force?\nA few in-game sources imply the presence of a potential seventh force. The &lt;a href=\"broker\"&gt;broker&lt;/a&gt; Al'firim compiled &lt;a href=\"Expedition_Report_A37J_-_Part_1\"&gt;a report&lt;/a&gt; on his findings of a force he refers to as the \"fractals\". Additionally, a &lt;a href=\"Korthia\"&gt;Korthia&lt;/a&gt;n relic, the &lt;a href=\"Everliving%20Statuette%20%28item%29\"&gt;Everliving Statuette (item)&lt;/a&gt;, whispers \"\".\nDifferent types of magic.\nCommonalities.\nAll spells cost a certain amount of &lt;a href=\"mana\"&gt;mana&lt;/a&gt;, a substance and a magical power resource which &lt;a href=\"caster\"&gt;caster&lt;/a&gt;s draw upon when they use magic, which is just a measure of a fundamental power\u2014if mana were water, then for instance arcane would be steam pressure. The existence and mixture of &lt;a href=\"Magic%23The%20cosmic%20forces\"&gt;various forces and energies&lt;/a&gt; form powerful vortices of mana. When they run out of mana, spellcasters can no longer use magic and are left exhausted. As magic draws its energy from the physical forces of the caster, the only way to regenerate the body is by consuming food, especially protein. They may also drink while resting, or use mana &lt;a href=\"potion\"&gt;potion&lt;/a&gt;s prepared by &lt;a href=\"alchemist\"&gt;alchemist&lt;/a&gt;s. The more a living being's mana is consumed or drained, the more they are weakened, and if abused, it can cause fainting or death. In older times, when magic was less understood and spells required vast amounts of mana to cast, gems were used to store mana for use in complex spells.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"anima\"&gt;anima&lt;/a&gt; is the source that is drawn upon by its denizens when using &lt;a href=\"Necromancy\"&gt;death magic&lt;/a&gt;, and is comparable to the mana used in the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;Great Dark Beyond&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere are many different &lt;a href=\"Magic%20schools\"&gt;schools of magic&lt;/a&gt;, tapping into various cosmic energies and using different methods to sometimes reach similar goals. Most magic &lt;a href=\"spell\"&gt;spell&lt;/a&gt;s however require specific components, physical requirements the &lt;a href=\"caster\"&gt;caster&lt;/a&gt; must meet in order to use them. These requirements might be verbal, with the spellcaster using specific words of power, somatic, with the spellcaster having to make motions, or material, with the spell requiring &lt;a href=\"reagent\"&gt;reagent&lt;/a&gt;s. Some clothes might even be more adapted than others for the casting of certain spells. As such these spells might have different &lt;a href=\"cast%20time\"&gt;cast time&lt;/a&gt;s and can even be &lt;a href=\"interrupt\"&gt;interrupt&lt;/a&gt;ed by circumstances. &lt;a href=\"Spellbook\"&gt;Spellbook&lt;/a&gt;s are known to describe spells, their effects and their components. &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt; personally had &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt; fitted with a fully equipped pantry of spell components, including a larder of aromatic and thaumaturgic herbs, and a lapidarium of crushed semi-precious stones.\nFailing to follow a spell's components, such as changing a hand-motion or not using a required incense, would most of the times result in failure, with the energies of the spell dissipating harmlessly. Occasionally the energies may go wild and out of control, but usually the only result of a failed spell is a frustrated spellcaster. Changing the incantation or altering the motions isn't also enough to refit a spell for a new activity. Changing an existing spell requires a deep and precise understanding of how it works, and this activity is more dangerous than simply following a list of components, as a failed spell being very close to the final intended spell would lead to the magics trying to close the gap, to make something happen, though then resulting in unintended results or spectacular and dangerous failure.\n&lt;a href=\"Necromancy\"&gt;Necromancy&lt;/a&gt; is the art of \"animating unliving flesh\" and controlling the dead, which can be empowered by the magic of any cosmic forces.\nHoly.\nPure &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; cannot exist within the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;physical universe&lt;/a&gt; but shades of it manifest as holy magic. Summoned by emotions, willpower or faith in one's ability to do so, the powers of the Light can be harnessed to heal, cleanse, protect, harm, and even &lt;a href=\"Resurrect\"&gt;restore life to the dead&lt;/a&gt;, while being extra efficient against the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s. The Light is often said to bring about feelings of positive emotion\u2014hope, courage, comfort\u2014coming from the \"heart.\" Most of its practitioners are called &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s, devoted to cleansing the universe of &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;darkness&lt;/a&gt;. Learning to wield this healing force takes years of discipline, as it is necessary to learn to abnegate oneself through meditation, in order to become conduits for the Light.\nMoonlight.\n&lt;a href=\"Moonlight\"&gt;Moonlight&lt;/a&gt; is a type of &lt;a href=\"holy\"&gt;holy&lt;/a&gt; magic that can be used by the follower of the &lt;a href=\"moon\"&gt;moon&lt;/a&gt; goddess &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;, notably the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; who revere her as Mu'sha in their &lt;a href=\"tauren%20mythology\"&gt;mythology&lt;/a&gt;.\nShadow.\nPure &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; cannot exist within the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;physical universe&lt;/a&gt; but shades of it manifest as shadow magic A source of terrible power, it is the kind of power that comes at a price, as the very nature of the Void is hostile to what the mortal know as life and sanity, and will do whatever it takes to drive them to madness. Although destructive, it can also be used to harm the mind, imparting feelings such as despair, doubt, and panic\u2014emotions based on survival logic. Twilight magic is presumably &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt; magic of the void branch. Most common practitioners of shadow magic are called &lt;a href=\"shadowcaster\"&gt;shadowcaster&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"shadowmage\"&gt;shadowmage&lt;/a&gt;s, or &lt;a href=\"shadow%20priest\"&gt;shadow priest&lt;/a&gt;s.\nNature.\nThe energies of &lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;Life&lt;/a&gt;, commonly known as nature magic, promote growth and renewal in all things. The elements that carve form into the universe are fluid forces of nature. &lt;a href=\"Druid\"&gt;Druid&lt;/a&gt;s work with the natural life forces of the world, and harness the vast powers of nature to preserve balance and protect life. As druid healing involves life force being drained and transferred, they ask the surrounding nature to lend them their energy in order to cast spells or to aid them in battle.\nSolar magic.\n&lt;a href=\"Solar%20magic\"&gt;Solar magic&lt;/a&gt; is praticed through the use of the solar energy emitted by the &lt;a href=\"sun\"&gt;sun&lt;/a&gt;. It is associated to the &lt;a href=\"nature\"&gt;nature&lt;/a&gt; magic used by &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s, rather than the &lt;a href=\"holy\"&gt;holy&lt;/a&gt; magic used by &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s.\nBlood magic.\n&lt;a href=\"Blood%20magic\"&gt;Blood magic&lt;/a&gt; is a form of tortured life magic that uses blood as a power source. On &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, it is shunned by many as a dark and forgotten art, as in that and many other ways, it shares some distinct characteristics with &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;demonic magic&lt;/a&gt;. Someone who practices blood magic is often called a blood mage or blood wizard.\nNecromantic.\nNecromantic magic is the manifestation of &lt;a href=\"Death\"&gt;Death&lt;/a&gt; magic, it was developed by the &lt;a href=\"Primus\"&gt;Primus&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt; and has many functions through the practice of &lt;a href=\"necromancy\"&gt;necromancy&lt;/a&gt;. Masters of this tainted field of magic can conjure festering diseases, harness the shadows into &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Bolt\"&gt;bolts of incendiary energy&lt;/a&gt;, and reconstruct the flesh of &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; creatures, allowing them to function again even after the foul monsters have been destroyed. Its most common practitioners are known as &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt;s and others include &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"necrolyte\"&gt;necrolyte&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Necrolord%20%28occupation%29\"&gt;necrolords&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt;.\nDomination.\nDomination is a brand of powerful &lt;a href=\"Rune%20magic\"&gt;runic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Death\"&gt;Death&lt;/a&gt; magic whose sole purpose is the utter suppression of another being. Behaving in a matter similar to a language, it alters the victim's thoughts so powerfully that it interferes with their sense of self. It was originally created by the &lt;a href=\"Primus\"&gt;Primus&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxus\"&gt;Maldraxxus&lt;/a&gt; for the purpose of imprisoning &lt;a href=\"Zovaal\"&gt;Zovaal the Jailer&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Runeblade\"&gt;Runeblade&lt;/a&gt;s infused with Domination are known as &lt;a href=\"mourneblade\"&gt;mourneblade&lt;/a&gt;s.\nArcane.\nArcane magic is a cold and intellectual magic that warps &lt;a href=\"time\"&gt;time&lt;/a&gt;, space, and controls the flow of &lt;a href=\"mana\"&gt;mana&lt;/a&gt;. Though extremely volatile, which requires intense precision and concentration, arcane is so similar to an element it might as well be one, for all magical intents and purposes. Arcane has been described as the \"base fabric\" of the world and can be pulled from &lt;a href=\"ley%20line\"&gt;ley line&lt;/a&gt;s, channels of immense magical power that course through &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; itself.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;, when a &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; creates fire with arcane magic, all they do is concentrate the inherent nature of the fire contained in the surrounding area into one location in order to call it into being.\nTechnomancy.\nTechnomancy, or techno-sorcery, is a form of magic employed by the &lt;a href=\"ethereal\"&gt;ethereal&lt;/a&gt;s, capable of &lt;a href=\"Reforging\"&gt;modifying&lt;/a&gt; an item's &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; essence or &lt;a href=\"Void%20Storage\"&gt;housing items in a pocket dimension&lt;/a&gt;, as well as opening portals.\nChronomancy.\nChronomancy is the art of weaving time. This discipline falls under the &lt;a href=\"Arcane\"&gt;arcanic&lt;/a&gt; school of &lt;a href=\"The%20Schools%20of%20Arcane%20Magic%20-%20Transmutation\"&gt;transmutation&lt;/a&gt;, and most of its practitioners are called chronomancers.\nFel.\nFel magic is a destructive form of magic used by all members of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, and often by &lt;a href=\"Warlock\"&gt;warlocks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Demon%20hunter\"&gt;demon hunters&lt;/a&gt; among the mortal races. Its use results in the alteration of the individual, or &lt;a href=\"Fel%23Effects%20on%20beings\"&gt;corruption&lt;/a&gt;, which manifests as a physical transformation such as a change to an individual's eyes or skin color, or heavy genetic mutations. All &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s carry the taint of fel magic within their very blood, allowing them to spread greater evil. Warlocks use life force to power their fel magic.\nShamanism.\nShamanism is a deeply spiritual form of elemental magic that involves a connection with both the natural and spirit worlds. &lt;a href=\"Shaman\"&gt;Shaman&lt;/a&gt; do not normally enslave &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt;s, but honor them, asking the elements to heed their call. Shaman are not inherently imbued with magic\u2014they harness the powers of the elements through ceremonial &lt;a href=\"totem\"&gt;totem&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20of%20Life\"&gt;Spirit&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Chi\"&gt;Chi&lt;/a&gt; as the &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; call it, is the life force that &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; manipulate. Spirit energy is intrinsically linked to the elements\u2014earth, air, fire, and water. This life-giving force interconnects and binds all things in existence as one. There is a relation to the spiritual magic of shaman and the natural magic of &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s, which is why the shaman were able to hear the spirits of &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeomancy.\nGeomancy is a crude form of shamanism.\nRunic.\nRunic magic is a magic that employs runes. The &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; practice a runic magic that even the most experienced wizards find unfamiliar. The runes can access various types of magic, such as fel, void, arcane, and death.\nVoodoo.\nVoodoo is a dark and powerful form of magic, referred to as the \"ancient power of the trolls\", and practiced by &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"shadow%20hunter\"&gt;shadow hunter&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"hexxer\"&gt;hexxer&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"witch%20doctor\"&gt;witch doctor&lt;/a&gt;s. They use &lt;a href=\"mojo\"&gt;mojo&lt;/a&gt; in their voodoo. A practitioner of voodoo is sometimes called a voodooist or vodouisant.\n&lt;a href=\"Hoodoo\"&gt;Hoodoo&lt;/a&gt; is also a form of magic used by trolls.\nIn the RPG.\nTwo categories of magic exist, &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"divine\"&gt;divine&lt;/a&gt;. Divine magic contains druidism, shamanism, voodoo, and holy light, as well as other religions. &lt;a href=\"Nature\"&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt; is a subcategory within the divine, but a form of it can also be found in arcane as well. Runes are mystically ancient, it is a type of arcane magic, but accessed by more natural means (see &lt;a href=\"Runemaster\"&gt;Runemaster&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Inscriber\"&gt;Inscriber&lt;/a&gt;s).\nArcane.\nArcane, the most common form of magic, comes from the Well of Eternity, which itself draws from the Twisting Nether. Arcane magic is very powerful, but if not used carefully can cause corruption and great destruction. Used by &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"wizard\"&gt;wizard&lt;/a&gt;s, and other &lt;a href=\"sorcerer\"&gt;sorcerer&lt;/a&gt;s, such as those of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;, arcane magic is ever present in the atmosphere and accessible to any who are capable of drawing upon its energies. Arcane magics were discovered by the kaldorei and later refined by the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; nations, and are most commonly practiced by mages.\nFel.\nFel energy is arcane magic at its most corrupt. If arcane magic is an addiction, fel magic is the embodiment of the drug at its purest form.\nNecromancy.\nNecromancers are capable of reviving living creatures from death to do their bidding as &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; servants.\nNature.\nDruids derive their power from the earth itself, although they do not require totems to channel energy like shamans. They become agents of nature itself, forming a bond with all beings of nature and pulling their strength directly from that bond.\nGeomancy.\nThe practice of divination and elemental combat native to several humanoid races of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. It is similar to shamanism in that disciples of geomancy wield the powers of the earth and encourage respect of earth's spirits. The main difference between a geomancer and a shaman is the method through which the trust of the elements is gained. A shaman speaks directly with the elemental spirits, whereas a geomancer uses rituals, songs, and sacrifices to appease and propitiate the spirits.\nRune magic.\nRunic magic was created by the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s. Their creation, the &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt;, quickly mastered the mysteries of the runes taught to them. However, as generations passed, the dwarves forgot their heritage and lost all knowledge of runes and their hereditary powers.\n&lt;a href=\"Tauren\"&gt;Tauren&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; rediscovered the power of runes. An ancient race as well, the tauren remembered the myths of runecasting and revived interest in this nearly lost art. The dwarves that came to Kalimdor with &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;'s Alliance Expedition learned tauren runecasting techniques. Tauren and dwarves do not share good relations, but they were eager to share knowledge of runes and titan myths.\nVoodoo.\nVoodoo is a strange tribal mix between the power of arcane and divine magic, practiced by &lt;a href=\"witch%20doctor\"&gt;witch doctor&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"shadow%20hunter\"&gt;shadow hunter&lt;/a&gt;s. They often combine reagents in a cauldron to create strange brews that most often result in bizarre transformations when consumed. They are widely known for placing &lt;a href=\"hex\"&gt;hex&lt;/a&gt;es to morph victims into various creatures or placing curses. The majority of voodoo users are trolls, although other races of the Horde have taken up the craft.\nSpeculation.\n&lt;a href=\"Saezurah\"&gt;Saezurah&lt;/a&gt;, oracle of &lt;a href=\"Zereth%20Mortis\"&gt;Zereth Mortis&lt;/a&gt;, has &lt;a href=\"Saezurah%23Quotes\"&gt;idle dialogue&lt;/a&gt; that states \"Mortis. Lumen. Ordus. Rhythm and structure. (...) Vitae. Umbra. Tumult. Improvisation and possibility.\" Whether or not these are the names of the other realms of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Ones\"&gt;First Ones&lt;/a&gt; has not been confirmed. "}

{"id": "59330", "revid": "40389549", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=59330", "title": "Magic Absorption", "text": "Magic Absorption is a &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; talent that increases &lt;a href=\"resistance\"&gt;resistance&lt;/a&gt; to all schools, and restores mana each time a spell is resisted.\nThis talent is most useful to mages that expect to take a lot of magical damage. Aside from the resistance added to all schools, it will restore mana for each full resist. The amount of mana restored is a percentage of the mage's total mana pool, meaning that the talent scales with gear. Pre-expansion, there were quite a few raid encounters that required high amounts of resistance, such as &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vaelastrasz%20the%20Corrupt\"&gt;Vaelastrasz the Corrupt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Viscidus\"&gt;Viscidus&lt;/a&gt;. With the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt; expansion, there are fewer raid encounters that rely on the entire raid wearing a lot of resist gear, and this talent has become less useful. This could still be somewhat useful in PvP situations.\nAlthough the following should not weigh heavy in any consideration for the talent, it is observed that if you do a run through a low-level instance, you will resist essentially all magic attacks against you, and that will give you significant mana regeneration.\nDo take into consideration that this talent grants a lot of resistance at max level, and less resistance gear means more room for DPS gear.\nMost mages first choose &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Concentration\"&gt;Arcane Concentration&lt;/a&gt; at this tier in the Arcane tree, and take Magic Absorption as filler for later talents in the tree."}

Dampen Magic (Rank\u00a06) will reduce damage taken by 180 and healing taken by 360. The range increase is subjectively useful, but broad as it covers all Arcane spells. It is often taken as a filler talent to get later talents in the Arcane tree. For Arcane specialized mages that use Amplify Magic and Dampen Magic often enough, this talent would make a good filler.\nThe talent is also important in certain PvP builds for its use in extending Polymorph's range from 30 yards to 36 at full rank."}

{"id": "448535", "revid": "4517731", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=448535", "title": "Magic addiction", "text": "Magic addiction is an affliction suffered by the &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt;, and to a greater extent by their descendants. Banished from &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; for their refusal to give up arcane magic, the Highborne founded their own kingdom, within which they unleashed their magical wonders. After 7,000 years of being suffused by the power of the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;, their people \u2014 known as the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt;, then as the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 developed an innate, seemingly incurable addiction to its arcane energies. When the Sunwell was destroyed, their source of arcane power was torn away, and the elves were left with a weakening, sometimes fatal, hunger for magic in its place.\nVarious methods have been used to counter and sate addiction to magic, but no true cure has ever been found.\nBackground.\nThousands of years ago, the Highborne of old, led by &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt;, lived in opulence and used their great magic with whim and caprice. Many were fascinated and obsessed with the original &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;, and were greatly tempted by the second. Their reckless use of the arcane eventually attracted the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, and following the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"kaldorei\"&gt;kaldorei&lt;/a&gt; outlawed magic on pain of death. The Highborne, unwilling to give up their arcane practices, were banished. The Highborne were the first to experience an addiction to the arcane.\nWhen the exiled Highborne founded the Kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, their first king, &lt;a href=\"Dath%27Remar%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Dath'Remar Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;, created the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt; using a stolen vial of the Well of Eternity. It was his belief that the Sunwell would surpass the old well; its powers not only began suffusing and strengthening the Highborne, but altered their appearance, giving birth to the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt;. Empowered by the Sunwell, the elves thrived for millennia, creating one of the strongest empires in the Eastern Kingdoms. The Sunwell's energies were essential to the elves' way of life, and the very existence of Quel'Thalas; it was the heart of their society. It had empowered the magi who had built their kingdom, and enabled some of the elves' day-to-day spellcasting. Magic had become as much a way of life for the high elves as eating or breathing. The Sunwell's energy pervaded the high elves every moment of every day, washing over them with its power, feeding them unceasingly.\nYet, the high elves' blessings were not without cost. Not apparent to the elves was the effect the Sunwell would have on them: forever linked to the Sunwell, living in the warmth of its glow, and constantly fed its magical energies, the high elves became intrinsically dependent upon it.\nLoss of the Sunwell.\nProtected by the Sunwell, Quel'Thalas stood strong for over 7,000 years. This changed during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, when Quel'Thalas was &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20invasion%20of%20Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;invaded&lt;/a&gt;, and nearly obliterated, by the undead &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. The Sunwell was tainted and defiled by necromancy, and the surviving elves destroyed it to avert a further catastrophe. The war's end was brutal: ninety percent of the high elves had been slaughtered, their kingdom was left in ruins, and their source of power was gone. The survivors, rallied by their &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;prince&lt;/a&gt;, began calling themselves the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; in honor of their perished kin.\nIt was now that the elves became aware of their addiction to magic. While the tainted Sunwell's destruction had saved them from death, it left them weakened and despondent without its arcane energies for nourishment. Only now did they realize how dependent they'd become on the Sunwell, how much they needed to feed on the arcane.\nFinding a cure.\n&lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;, last of the &lt;a href=\"Sunstrider%20dynasty\"&gt;Sunstrider dynasty&lt;/a&gt; and now the sole ruler of Quel'Thalas, asserted that finding a cure to this crippling addiction was of paramount importance. He believed that only a new source of power would save his people, and instructed his regent, &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;, to govern the elven kingdom while the prince and his army left to battle in Lordaeron. Lor'themar and &lt;a href=\"Halduron%20Brightwing\"&gt;Halduron Brightwing&lt;/a&gt; safeguarded the land, battling the lingering Scourge remnants with their &lt;a href=\"Farstriders\"&gt;Farstriders&lt;/a&gt;, while seeking a cure for their people's seemingly insatiable hunger. Notably, the rangers were affected by the withdrawal less so than their brethren. The cause of this was unknown.\nWithdrawal from magic was an issue the blood elves struggled with daily; reclaiming their kingdom was a daunting task, beset on all sides by enemies but lacking in allies, even without their weakening addiction to magic to consider. The withdrawal proved fatal to the very young, the very old, and the sick, and had grown steadily, worsening with time.\nAn answer to this predicament came from an unlikely source. While in Lordaeron, Kael'thas met &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Vashj\"&gt;Lady Vashj&lt;/a&gt; and her serpentine &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;. Vashj claimed that the naga, too, were addicted to magic and that her master &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; could help the blood elves in their struggle with magic addiction. Kael, who had been sentenced to death along with his entire army by an intolerant human commander, accepted her aid, rescued his people, and fled to &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. There, he met Illidan and pledged his allegiance to the half-demon in return for a cure for magic addiction. Illidan had something else in mind, however. He informed the prince that there \"was\" no cure, but that the addiction \"could\" be sated. He shared with Kael'thas the ability to &lt;a href=\"Mana%20Tap\"&gt;drain mana&lt;/a&gt; from various arcane-bearing sources, even &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demons&lt;/a&gt;. It was an offer Kael'thas felt he had to accept. He was certain his people would die without either a cure or a new source of magic. Kael'thas swore his loyalty to Illidan, who taught several blood elves the techniques he had offered. These teachings spread to the other blood elves in Outland, who were then able to stave off their painful hunger for arcane magic.\nHowever, Illidan had in his possession another fount of arcane power called the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Lost%20Souls\"&gt;Shrine of Lost Souls&lt;/a&gt;, comparable to the Well of Eternity, which he used to break his demonic servants free of their addiction to the Legion's magic. Years later, it was speculated that this was what he intended to give the blood elves to free them from their addiction to the Sunwell, but for some reason he did not let them near it.\nStill, Kael'thas and his followers took well to mana draining. He sent one of his most loyal advisors, &lt;a href=\"Rommath\"&gt;Rommath&lt;/a&gt;, to spread these teachings - albeit with certain details left out - back home to Quel'Thalas, to reinvigorate their people.\nMana draining.\nRommath returned to Quel'Thalas and spread Illidan's teachings. He took care to limit what the general population knew, hiding Kael's contact with Illidan; it is likely the involvement of demons would have horrified most blood elves. Rather, Rommath encouraged his people to sate their cravings with good judgment, and to strive to maintain the healthy balance between deficiency and overindulgence.\nMost blood elves embraced these teachings, using them to drain arcane power from compact &lt;a href=\"mana%20crystal\"&gt;mana crystal&lt;/a&gt;s (which became a popular product) and innocuous mana-bearing vermin. Mana draining could be used on anything containing arcane power, including crystals, artifacts, creatures, and even mortals possessing such power. In \"\", this was illustrated by the blood elf racial ability, &lt;a href=\"Mana%20Tap\"&gt;Mana Tap&lt;/a&gt;, which drained a small amount of mana from any target possessing some.\nHeartened by their swift recovery, the blood elves succeeded in retaking and rebuilding much of Quel'Thalas. The Scourge was expelled from &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt;, which was rebuilt almost overnight. Invigorated, the blood elves were able to retake sections of &lt;a href=\"Eversong%20Woods\"&gt;Eversong Woods&lt;/a&gt;, and others looked to the &lt;a href=\"Ghostlands\"&gt;Ghostlands&lt;/a&gt;. The elves reconstructed their &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Sanctum\"&gt;Arcane Sanctums&lt;/a&gt;, using them to gather arcane energy from key ley lines throughout the land.\nIt is important to note that although &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; magic was used in Quel'Thalas, it was not for the purpose of sustenance. Demonic power was enslaved in crystals, which the &lt;a href=\"Magisters\"&gt;Magisters&lt;/a&gt; used to empower the kingdom's structures; many buildings had fallen apart without the Sunwell's power to hold them together. The crystals, which had apparently always been present in some form, can be found strewn around Quel'Thalas. Simply living around this fel magic is how most of the blood elves developed their fel-green eyes.\nAlthough mana draining was an efficient way for an elf to retain their strength, it was only a temporary respite from magic addiction. Within hours of consuming a mana crystal, the gnawing hunger for arcane magic would return. Furthermore, some desperate blood elves took the process too far, overusing the technique. This gave birth to the &lt;a href=\"Wretched\"&gt;Wretched&lt;/a&gt;, a group of disheveled, violent addicts willing to do anything for another arcane meal. All blood elves were taught and encouraged to control their addiction to magic; it is a thirst unending.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, Kael'thas' magisters have refined their usage of mana crystals to the point where they can siphon large amounts of energy in a matter of seconds. They do this by attuning smaller &lt;a href=\"Bloodgem%20Shard\"&gt;bloodgem crystal shards&lt;/a&gt; to larger, fully charged ones. Exposure to this level of raw energy greatly magnifies their innate addiction to magic, however.\nKael'thas eventually turned from arcane magic to fel in efforts to acquire greater power. This was a change that would have damning consequences, as the prince lost faith in Illidan and aligned himself with the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, whose master had promised his people salvation. Kael became twisted due to his reliance on fel energy, and his actions began causing friction and &lt;a href=\"Scryers\"&gt;defections&lt;/a&gt; from within his own ranks. Some of the prince's magisters refined their mana crystals, which allowed them to rapidly drain huge amounts of energy at the cost of augmenting their innate addiction to magic. It is presumed they were too drunk on this magic to question their leader's increasingly dark path.\nThe Sunwell restored.\nKael'thas' ambitions were not to be realized, and the twisted prince and his Legion allies were fought and defeated by an army of blood elf and &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; soldiers named the &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Sun%20Offensive\"&gt;Shattered Sun Offensive&lt;/a&gt;. After the battle, the Sunwell, exhausted from Kael'thas' ill-fated attempt to summon forth &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; from its mystical depths, was restored by &lt;a href=\"Prophet%20Velen\"&gt;Prophet Velen&lt;/a&gt;, using the heart of the fallen &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"M%27uru\"&gt;M'uru&lt;/a&gt;. Its energies sanctified, the Sunwell was reborn as a fount of both arcane and holy power. Its significant source of &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; is what blood elf paladins, known as Blood Knights, now turn to in order to invoke their powers.\nThis was a great gift to the blood elves, most of whom have resolved to embrace it as they fight to overcome their addiction to magic. Although some elves remain hesitant to abandon their dependence on arcane magic, others have embraced change for the betterment of Quel'Thalas.\nFuture.\nWith the Sunwell restored, blood elves no longer make use of mana draining, and in \"World of Warcraft\" the Mana Tap racial was removed. However, while the Sunwell once more sustains them, their core addiction to magic is not yet cured. Prominent figures among the blood elves have referenced this.\n&lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;, regent lord of Quel'Thalas, has encouraged his people to turn to the Sunwell. He specified that as its energies are now different, it may take time for some to adjust.\n&lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knight\"&gt;Blood Knights&lt;/a&gt;, believes that the Sunwell will give the blood elves the strength they need to conquer their addiction completely. It will be a difficult battle, but with the Sunwell, she states they will be able to restore their people to greatness and break free from the addiction ravaging their people.\n&lt;a href=\"Tae%27thelan%20Bloodwatcher\"&gt;Tae'thelan Bloodwatcher&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the &lt;a href=\"Reliquary\"&gt;Reliquary&lt;/a&gt;, seeks to find artifacts of power capable of freeing his race from their addiction to magic.\nThe updated introduction to playable blood elves in \"\" outright says that, over time, the new Sunwell may cure the blood elves of their cursed state.\nAbstinence.\nOne answer to magic addiction was to abstain from magic entirely. This was employed by some of the remaining high elves who did not become blood elves. Some dealt with their addiction in a similar manner to the blood elves, using stolen artifacts and mana-bearing crystals to sate their hunger. The high elves of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Danil\"&gt;Quel'Danil&lt;/a&gt; swore off magic completely, while the high elves of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Lithien\"&gt;Quel'Lithien&lt;/a&gt; opposed mana draining on moral grounds.\nAbstinence was not for everyone. While rangers could get by with minimal assistance, more magic-inclined elves who ceased their intake of magic became gravely ill.\nAddiction to fel.\nIt is known that many demons of the Burning Legion are addicted to the magic of their dark masters. Illidan Stormrage found (or created) a way to cure them of it using the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Lost%20Souls\"&gt;Shrine of Lost Souls&lt;/a&gt;, which washed away their fel taint and freed them from the Legion's yoke. It was suggested by &lt;a href=\"Kanrethad%20Ebonlocke\"&gt;Kanrethad Ebonlocke&lt;/a&gt;, who was present during the Black Temple's fall, that Illidan had originally intended to use this to free the blood elves of their addiction to the Sunwell, but for one reason or another did not let them near it. &lt;a href=\"Observer\"&gt;Observer&lt;/a&gt; demons joined the Legion to begin with in order to seek out and taste new forms of magic.\nBlood elves are addicted to arcane magic, not fel, but it is possible for a blood or high elf to succumb to fel magic's lure; Kael'thas Sunstrider and some of his more zealous followers did so while on Outland. Dissatisfied with the limits of arcane magic, Kael'thas began consuming fel energy to acquire even greater power. A blood elf who consumes enough fel magic will be warped into a demonic hybrid, known as a &lt;a href=\"felblood%20elf\"&gt;felblood elf&lt;/a&gt;, essentially their race's equivalent of a &lt;a href=\"fel%20orc\"&gt;fel orc&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn his report on &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; reported that blood elves were addicted to both, arcane and fel magic.\nNaga.\nThe &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; too are addicted to magic. As former Highborne, the naga's past abuse of the Well has not been without additional consequences. The Highborne were obsessed with the Well, and the naga have been exposed to the Well's residual magics for millennia. Consequently, modern naga are addicted to magic. But, they already resolve way for it addiction with overcoming at beneath the surface.\nNightborne.\nThe residents of &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt; who began living under a mystical barrier during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; utilized one of the &lt;a href=\"Pillars%20of%20Creation\"&gt;Pillars of Creation&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Aman%27Thul\"&gt;Eye of Aman'Thul&lt;/a&gt;, to create their own font of arcane power: the &lt;a href=\"Nightwell\"&gt;Nightwell&lt;/a&gt;. Cut off from the rest of the world, these elves began to feed on the Nightwell itself, consuming arcane magic in the form of &lt;a href=\"arcwine\"&gt;arcwine&lt;/a&gt;. While it sustained them, it also mutated them over time into a race known as the &lt;a href=\"shal%27dorei\"&gt;shal'dorei&lt;/a&gt;, or nightborne. It also cursed them with a far more debilitating addiction to arcane magic, as the addiction became combined with hunger. Failing to sate this addiction led to a nightborne quickly becoming emaciated, a state known as '&lt;a href=\"nightfallen\"&gt;nightfallen&lt;/a&gt;', with their hunger becoming stronger and stronger, and having clear effects on their behavior such as paranoia and delirium.\nIf the addiction remained unsated, a nightborne would eventually be transformed into a feral, enraged creature known as a &lt;a href=\"withered\"&gt;withered&lt;/a&gt;. Tormented by crazed and confused memories, no longer possessing higher brain functions, and driven purely by hunger, becoming a withered was considered a fate worse than death, and was irreversible.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion\"&gt;campaign&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;, however, Dalaran intercepted a distress call by &lt;a href=\"First%20Arcanist%20Thalyssra\"&gt;First Arcanist Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt;, an exiled noble of Suramar, and with the help of an adventurer, she united exiles and rebels under the Nightfallen banner and, more importantly, discovered a cure to the nightborne's condition: the fruit of the &lt;a href=\"Arcan%27dor\"&gt;Arcan'dor&lt;/a&gt;, a creation of nature and arcane magic that restored balance to the nightborne and allowed them to once again gain sustenance from ordinary food.\nNon-elf races.\nCuriously, non-elf races seem immune to magic addiction. The high elves were notably surprised to discover humans had this resistance, and it appears gnomes, dwarves, goblins, and &lt;a href=\"Ogre\"&gt;the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;races&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Draenei\"&gt;alien&lt;/a&gt; to Azeroth also possess it. Even the elves' own progenitors, the trolls, seem to possess this resistance to magic addiction.\nIn the RPG.\nIn exchange for the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;' loyal service, &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; gave the blood elves a place to live, as well as further techniques to siphon &lt;a href=\"mana\"&gt;mana&lt;/a&gt; from anything with &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; power. Blood elves on Outland now hunt demons and feed off the demons' magic. Illidan wanted to create another Well of Eternity on &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; to fuel his blood elves' magic addiction."}

There are several categories such as felbreakers and firebreakers, each being able to actively dampen or nullify their affiliated magic.\nBackground.\nMagic breakers are molded through an extremely dangerous process. Breakers are chosen for resilience. They are scalded by heat, crushed by rocks, denied water, food, and air. First, they learn the signs and patterns of a school of magic. Then, they are struck by controlled infusions of that magic in the presence of a special &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;Forger&lt;/a&gt; stone that can dampen magic. Eventually, some of their life essence is peeled away, and a small part of it is replaced by the magic branded into their very being, making them immune.\n&lt;a href=\"Ko%27ragh\"&gt;Ko'ragh&lt;/a&gt; was the only ogre with a near-complete immunity to all magic.\n&lt;a href=\"Imperator%20Mar%27gok%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Imperator Mar'gok&lt;/a&gt; is the only one who can invoke the power of the Forger stone.\nDuring the events of the &lt;a href=\"war%20in%20Draenor\"&gt;war in Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, Ko'ragh, Mar'gok, and a number of the breakers were killed by &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Crulgorosh\"&gt;Crulgorosh&lt;/a&gt; is known to have worked on empowering them, while &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Reglakk\"&gt;Grand Magister Reglakk&lt;/a&gt; worked on imbuing armor with felbreaker magic in order to equip any soldier with their magic.\nFollowing the assault on Highmaul and the fall of the &lt;a href=\"Gorian%20Empire\"&gt;Gorian Empire&lt;/a&gt;, their current status is unknown. The &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt; employs s in &lt;a href=\"Tanaan%20Jungle\"&gt;Tanaan Jungle&lt;/a&gt; which use Nullification Barriers, similar to &lt;a href=\"Ko%27ragh\"&gt;Ko'ragh&lt;/a&gt;'s."}

Your &lt;a href=\"resistance\"&gt;resistance&lt;/a&gt; against five of these schools are displayed in your &lt;a href=\"Paper%20doll\"&gt;character information&lt;/a&gt;. The magic schools are also used as damage types, but even abilities that don't cause damage have schools.\nIf you are a caster, and an opponent uses an &lt;a href=\"interrupt%20effect\"&gt;interrupt effect&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"Counterspell\"&gt;Counterspell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kick\"&gt;Kick&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Mind%20Freeze\"&gt;Mind Freeze&lt;/a&gt; on you while you're casting a spell, your cast will be interrupted, and you will be prevented from casting any spell in that school for a certain period time. It's good to know what schools your abilities are in so you can switch to another when this happens. It's fairly clear for &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s (the school of the spell is the same as the tree it falls under) and &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s (if it doesn't involve fire, it's Shadow). For other classes, it's not always clear. Fortunately, the tooltip of any damage spell will specify the type of damage it does. Some abilities belong to &lt;a href=\"%23Multi-school\"&gt;multi-schools&lt;/a&gt;, and behave a little differently.\n&lt;a href=\"Warrior\"&gt;Warrior&lt;/a&gt;s are the only class that strictly deals only one damage type, that being Physical. &lt;a href=\"Hunter\"&gt;Hunter&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; have the most varied damage types, with both being able to deal Physical, Nature, Frost, and Fire damage, as well as Arcane and Shadow for hunters.\n&lt;a href=\"Physical\"&gt;Physical&lt;/a&gt;.\nNot presented as magic to the user, but treated as a school by the game mechanics. All weapons except &lt;a href=\"wand\"&gt;wand&lt;/a&gt;s deal physical damage; the target can use &lt;a href=\"Dodge\"&gt;Dodge&lt;/a&gt; to avoid the attack, a shield to &lt;a href=\"Block\"&gt;Block&lt;/a&gt; it, the &lt;a href=\"Parry\"&gt;Parry&lt;/a&gt; skill to block it with a weapon, and &lt;a href=\"Armor\"&gt;Armor&lt;/a&gt; to resist some of the damage if all else fails. Damage taken is physical damage. Most &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt; abilities are Physical. &lt;a href=\"Death%20knight\"&gt;Death knight&lt;/a&gt; abilities obtained by spending talent points in the Blood Tree do physical damage. &lt;a href=\"Armor%20penetration\"&gt;Armor penetration&lt;/a&gt; only ever applies to physical damage dealt.\nSome physical abilities, like &lt;a href=\"Demoralizing%20Shout\"&gt;Demoralizing Shout&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Clap\"&gt;Thunder Clap&lt;/a&gt;, are treated like spells. These abilities have a chance to miss like all spells, which can be offset by &lt;a href=\"Hit\"&gt;Hit&lt;/a&gt; rating, but resistance to these abilities cannot be increased.\n&lt;a href=\"Arcane\"&gt;Arcane&lt;/a&gt;.\nArcane magic is typically utility magic that causes various effects rather than dealing direct damage, and is used by &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Hunter\"&gt;Hunter&lt;/a&gt;s' &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Shot\"&gt;Arcane Shot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eagle%20Eye\"&gt;Eagle Eye&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Flare\"&gt;Flare&lt;/a&gt; are Arcane based. The &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s' &lt;a href=\"Moonfire\"&gt;Moonfire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Starfire\"&gt;Starfire&lt;/a&gt; is a main source of direct damage. Also, the &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elf&lt;/a&gt; racial ability &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Torrent\"&gt;Arcane Torrent&lt;/a&gt; is Arcane-based. (Before patch &lt;a href=\"Patch_3.0.2\"&gt;3.0.2&lt;/a&gt;, night elf priests could do Arcane damage with &lt;a href=\"Starshards\"&gt;Starshards&lt;/a&gt;.)\nThe true masters of the Arcane, however, are &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s. For mages, the Arcane school is primarily a utility line rather than a damage line. Any spell from a mage's Arcane ability category is of the Arcane school, including four spells that do damage (&lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Missiles\"&gt;Arcane Missiles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Explosion\"&gt;Arcane Explosion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Blast\"&gt;Arcane Blast&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Barrage\"&gt;Arcane Barrage&lt;/a&gt;) and a very broad range of utility spells: &lt;a href=\"Polymorph\"&gt;Polymorph&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Intellect\"&gt;Arcane Intellect&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mana%20Shield%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Mana Shield (Classic)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mage%20Armor\"&gt;Mage Armor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blink\"&gt;Blink&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Teleport\"&gt;Teleport&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Portal%20%28Spell%29\"&gt;Portal&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Counterspell\"&gt;Counterspell&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Conjure%20Mana%20Gem\"&gt;Conjure Mana Gem&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Conjure%20Food\"&gt;Food&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Conjure%20Water\"&gt;Water&lt;/a&gt;.\nHostile Arcane spells (including those that do no damage) can be resisted; there are items that increase one's &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20resistance\"&gt;Arcane resistance&lt;/a&gt;. Arcane is the only resistible magic school against which players cannot increase their Resistance via class abilities.\n&lt;a href=\"Fire\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpells of the Fire school typically inflict damage, which can be &lt;a href=\"direct%20damage\"&gt;direct damage&lt;/a&gt; and/or &lt;a href=\"DoT\"&gt;damage over time&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;Mage&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s use it as one of their primary source of damage, while &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Engineering\"&gt;engineers&lt;/a&gt; also use the Fire school.\nMany spells and environmental effects (such as lava) do Fire damage. The classes most associated with the ability to control fire are &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s. Fire is also one of the fundamental elements that shamans can manipulate with their Totems. In the same way, &lt;a href=\"Warlock\"&gt;Warlock&lt;/a&gt;s deliver huge burst of Fire damage. &lt;a href=\"Destruction\"&gt;Destruction&lt;/a&gt; warlocks are sometimes called \"Firelocks\". Hunters' &lt;a href=\"Explosive%20Trap\"&gt;Explosive Trap&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Explosive%20Shot\"&gt;Explosive Shot&lt;/a&gt; also deal Fire damage; similarly, explosives and damaging trinkets created by &lt;a href=\"Engineers\"&gt;Engineers&lt;/a&gt; typically do Fire damage.\nLike Arcane resistance, &lt;a href=\"Fire%20resistance\"&gt;Fire resistance&lt;/a&gt; is a statistic that can be affected by spells and items.\n&lt;a href=\"Frost\"&gt;Frost&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Frost school is effective both for attack (doing damage) and defense (raising armor value). Frost spells often inflict &lt;a href=\"snare\"&gt;snare&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"root\"&gt;root&lt;/a&gt; effects, as well. &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;Mage&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s use the Frost school.\n&lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;Mage&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s have Frost specializations, and obviously any spell in those trees are of the Frost school. Shamans' &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Shock\"&gt;Frost Shock&lt;/a&gt; is also of the Frost school.\n&lt;a href=\"Frost%20Resistance\"&gt;Frost Resistance&lt;/a&gt; exists as a statistic as well.\n&lt;a href=\"Nature\"&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Nature school is usually used for nature based attacks, &lt;a href=\"buff\"&gt;buff&lt;/a&gt;s, and curative spells. Nature damage can be &lt;a href=\"direct%20damage\"&gt;direct damage&lt;/a&gt; (like lightning) or &lt;a href=\"DoT\"&gt;damage over time&lt;/a&gt; (like poison). This means that &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt;s (poison), &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s have access to Nature damage.\nAlmost all magical &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s abilities are Nature school, including some of their signature abilities like &lt;a href=\"Hunter%27s%20Mark\"&gt;Hunter's Mark&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Misdirection\"&gt;Misdirection&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tame%20Beast\"&gt;Tame Beast&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mend%20Pet\"&gt;Mend Pet&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Beast%20Lore\"&gt;Beast Lore&lt;/a&gt;.\nAcids, &lt;a href=\"disease\"&gt;disease&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"poison\"&gt;poison&lt;/a&gt;s inflict Nature damage, and damage from lightning is also considered part of the Nature school. Shamans' and druids' healing spells are Nature spells, and other non-damaging spells such as &lt;a href=\"Entangling%20Roots\"&gt;Entangling Roots&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Faerie%20Fire\"&gt;Faerie Fire&lt;/a&gt; are in this school as well. Rogues' poisons are also Nature-based.\nA &lt;a href=\"Nature%20resistance\"&gt;Nature resistance&lt;/a&gt; statistic exists.\n&lt;a href=\"Shadow%20%28magic%29\"&gt;Shadow&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe opposite of Holy magic, Shadow is probably the most versatile school. Used by &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s (&lt;a href=\"Wailing%20Arrow\"&gt;Wailing Arrow&lt;/a&gt;) it contains a wide variety of spells. Apart from &lt;a href=\"Direct%20Damage\"&gt;Direct Damage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Damage%20over%20Time\"&gt;Damage over Time&lt;/a&gt; spells, there are various utility spells, including &lt;a href=\"Drain\"&gt;Drain&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Crowd%20Control\"&gt;Crowd Control&lt;/a&gt; spells, &lt;a href=\"Debuff\"&gt;Debuff&lt;/a&gt;s, and even &lt;a href=\"healing\"&gt;healing&lt;/a&gt;.\nShadow damage is dealt by dark spells such as those of the &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;'s Shadow abilities and most of the warlock's repertoire. The creation of a &lt;a href=\"Healthstone\"&gt;Healthstone&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Soulstone\"&gt;Soulstone&lt;/a&gt; and the summoning of demons are Shadow effects. Warlocks can also absorb Shadow damage with &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Ward\"&gt;Twilight Ward&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Resistance\"&gt;Shadow Resistance&lt;/a&gt; is the final resistance type.\n&lt;a href=\"Holy\"&gt;Holy&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Holy school is usually related to abilities which heal and aid living beings. There are also a few spells that do Holy damage, including &lt;a href=\"Smite\"&gt;Smite&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Consecration\"&gt;Consecration&lt;/a&gt;. Contrary to popular belief, Holy Magic does not deal additional damage to &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s.\n&lt;a href=\"Priest\"&gt;Priest&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s are the primary users of the Holy school, including all their healing and resurrection abilities. \nHoly damage.\nIt is not possible to resist Holy magic, giving it a slight advantage over other schools, but it does have a basic miss chance like all spells. This is of little value to players, and in &lt;a href=\"PvE\"&gt;PvE&lt;/a&gt;, NPCs' resistance is usually minimal anyway. However, NPC abilities that deal Holy damage can be significantly more harmful to a buffed raid group than damage of other schools.\nItems and Buffs which give a bonus to all resistances do not include Holy resistance, but percentage-based damage-reduction abilities successfully reduce damage from Holy spells. Also, the &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Protection%20Potion\"&gt;Holy Protection Potion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Major%20Holy%20Protection%20Potion\"&gt;Major Holy Protection Potion&lt;/a&gt; items will also absorb limited amounts of Holy damage.\nMulti-school.\nSome abilities belong to multiple schools of magic. These multi-school abilities benefit from bonuses that affect any of their schools. They use the lowest resistance value among their schools, and they ignore absorption and immunity effects that apply to only some of their schools. Multi-schools were introduced with &lt;a href=\"patch%204.0.1\"&gt;patch 4.0.1&lt;/a&gt;, although &lt;a href=\"Frostfire%20Bolt\"&gt;Frostfire Bolt&lt;/a&gt; had served as a prototype of the effects of multi-schools since &lt;a href=\"patch%203.0.2\"&gt;patch 3.0.2&lt;/a&gt;. \n&lt;a href=\"Interrupt%20effect\"&gt;Interrupt effect&lt;/a&gt;s are far less effective at locking players out of using multi-school spells. As long as any of the spell's schools is available, the player will still be able to cast the spell. This makes multi-school spells extremely hard to lock down, requiring the use of at least two consecutive interrupts (one for each school) in a very short space of time. This means that these abilities will almost always be available for players to cast when one of their schools is locked. In addition, some multi-school spells such as &lt;a href=\"Wake%20of%20Ashes\"&gt;Wake of Ashes&lt;/a&gt; belong to schools that are not used by any of the class's other spells. When these spells are instant cast, this means that it is not possible for that spell to be locked down."}

It contains a list of all the &lt;a href=\"school\"&gt;school&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Magic%23In%20the%20RPG\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; found in published sources and the lore behind them. The final section discusses how mechanics in the MMO do not necessarily fit with the published lore of the RPG.\nPaths.\nMost spells fall into two main categories; arcane and divine. All magic on Azeroth came from the kaldorei, both divine and later arcane. However, not all magic fits neatly into these two categories. Other magic types lurk outside or within arcane and divine, powerful and strange in their own rights. For example Priests have access to divine magic, while druids wield nature magic. One of the most sinister is fel magic. \nDivine domains.\nDivine domains describe healer spells and help define divine spells.\nSpirits has some overlap with the Elements and the Ancestors domain. It can cover abilities dealing with ancestral spirits, voodoo spirits and &lt;a href=\"elemental%20spirit\"&gt;elemental spirit&lt;/a&gt;s/spirits of nature.\nBranches.\nBranches mentioned in the lore in the RPG and other sources.\nSchools.\nCutting across the categories of arcane and divine spells are the eight schools of magic. These schools represent the different ways that spells take effect.\nSubschools.\nThe main schools split into several subschools. Some of the subschool categories can be found within more than one school.\nDescriptor.\nA descriptor further categorizes spells in some way. Some spells have more than one descriptor. Descriptors govern how the spell interacts with other spells, with special abilities, with unusual creatures, with alignment, and so on.\nFire magic is a subcategory of arcane magic.\nSpecial powers.\nThese magical discriptions usually have ties to enchantments or enhancements or bonus abilities on items.\nMechanics behind casting.\nArcane, runic, and fel.\nArcane and runic magic involve manipulating &lt;a href=\"ley%20line\"&gt;ley line&lt;/a&gt;s, which were laid down by the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Norgannon\"&gt;Norgannon&lt;/a&gt; during the creation of the universe. By manipulating the energies of the ley lines, arcane and runic casters can manipulate the world around them, causing changes in the physical universe.\nSimilar to arcane and runic magic, &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; magic involves the caster's manipulating the physical world by making compacts with &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s. Every manipulation of fel energies requires a small sacrifice of the caster's humanity to the demon world, having a similar effect as arcane magic, but without the burdensome study.\n&lt;a href=\"Hydromancy\"&gt;Hydromancy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Geomancer\"&gt;Geomancy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pyromancy\"&gt;Pyromancy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Aeromancy\"&gt;Aeromancy&lt;/a&gt; are magical specializations that require the caster use his/her manipulation over supernatural forces (like manipulating ley lines or compacting with demons) to command the loyalty of the elements from within the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Plane\"&gt;Elemental Plane&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Necromancy\"&gt;Necromancy&lt;/a&gt; is a similar specialization that allows fel (like the &lt;a href=\"dreadlords\"&gt;dreadlords&lt;/a&gt;) or arcane (&lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Cult of the Damned&lt;/a&gt;) magicians to use their powers to call upon spirits from the afterlife and reanimate dead flesh as &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; minions.\nDivine.\n&lt;a href=\"Divine\"&gt;Divine&lt;/a&gt; magic involves the blessings of a supernatural being.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt; of Creation grants supernatural healing and, in some cases, destructive powers to anyone who follows the strict discipline prescribed by its religious philosophy. More importantly, the user has to believe in the Light and that what they are doing is right.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20Shadow\"&gt;Forgotten Shadow&lt;/a&gt; provides similar powers to those people who follow its nihilistic religious doctrine. &lt;a href=\"Troll\"&gt;Troll&lt;/a&gt; witch doctors draw their abilities from the &lt;a href=\"Loa\"&gt;Loa&lt;/a&gt; gods, invoking their powers by enticing them with voodoo rituals. Some of the abilities of a &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt; are divine, drawing their power from the Night Elf goddess, &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;.\nNature.\n&lt;a href=\"Nature%23In%20the%20RPG\"&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt; magic involves drawing upon the spirits of the earth to invoke natural phenomenon.\nShamans draw upon the power of the elements, creating a personal relationship with each of the five elements (Fire, Water, Air, Earth, and Wilds) and asking for their assistance when it becomes necessary. This procedure is unlike the elemental practices of arcane or fel magicians, who use their manipulation over the physical universe to command the loyalty of elementals at their leisure.\nDruidism draws its mastery over the natural world from the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;, where the &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20of%20the%20Wilds\"&gt;Spirit of the Wilds&lt;/a&gt; and the spirits of all living things in the universe reside. Unlike in shamanism, a druid makes a physical connection between his/her spirit and the spirits of the Dream, becoming literally a part of the natural world. This explains the way all druids appear to have foliage growing from them, and their ability to shape-shift, because their spirit has made itself one with all other living things.\nThere are &lt;a href=\"arcane%20druids\"&gt;arcane druids&lt;/a&gt;, who use supernatural forces to command a link between themselves and the Dream. Though this practice does require an advanced knowledge of the Emerald Dream, it does not necessitate the close connection and respect of the natural world that true druidism does."}

Some of their most powerful mages created runes and tablets citing rules of the arcane and insights into their findings. They would leave these for all to ponder in public places.\nI would very much like rubbings of these runes from the Ruins of Eldarath. I have a kit for you to make the rubbings with, but it will be up to you to find them. Be careful though, the Explorer's League isn't the only one interested in Eldarath.\nRewards.\nUpon completion of this quest you will gain:\nProgress.\nWell, well, well, glad to see you made it out here, &lt;name&gt;. Did you get the rubbings for Tymor?\nAs dangerous as this place is, there hasn't been too much action along the coast. That might be on account of the naga swimming underwater, but that's not my problem... I patrol the skies.\nCompletion.\nGood to see you safe and sound, &lt;name&gt;. I hope things weren't too tough for you.\nI'll get these to &lt;a href=\"Tymor\"&gt;Tymor&lt;/a&gt; right away. He'll be thrilled to take a look at these things.\nGo ahead and toss the flare gun... probably won't be any good to you anymore anyway, and I already got a new one.\nNotes.\nIt can be a little tricky to find the right place to stand when you fire the flare gun. You must be standing on the central circular portion of the platform when you fire the gun, or else Xiggs will not arrive. Standing on the outer rim of the platform, or on the ramp leading up to it, will not work. As the flare gun only has two charges, if you miss this portion of the quest you will have to travel all the way back to &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; and then back to Azshara to complete it, wasting a lot of time."}

This talent does not apply to interrupts from abilities that also lock out a school, such as &lt;a href=\"Counterspell\"&gt;Counterspell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kick\"&gt;Kick&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Shield%20Bash%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Shield Bash (Classic)&lt;/a&gt;, and it does not apply to &lt;a href=\"silence%20effect\"&gt;silence effect&lt;/a&gt;s. It only reduces the &lt;a href=\"channel\"&gt;channel&lt;/a&gt;ing and casting time that is lost due to taking damage.\nUses.\nAt one point Arcane Stability was only useful for solo play, especially for lower-level mages that use Arcane Missiles while an enemy is beating on them. While Arcane Missiles can always be recast after it finishes channeling, thus never losing its &lt;a href=\"DPS\"&gt;DPS&lt;/a&gt;, the lack of interruption makes it more mana efficient when used while taking damage. For mages that don't take much damage while casting Arcane Missiles, or do not use the spell often, this talent is not as useful.\nRecently, especially given the amount of raid-wide damage applied by boss encounters in raid instances such as &lt;a href=\"Ulduar%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt;, pushback has become a considerable factor in Mage DPS, dramatically increasing Arcane Stability's relative worth within the Arcane tree. Pushback to a mage's Arcane Blast or Arcane Missiles spell can greatly reduce their effective damage and therefore raid performance.\nSince this talent can be combined with the benefit from a paladin's &lt;a href=\"Concentration%20Aura\"&gt;Concentration Aura&lt;/a&gt;, which can be &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Concentration%20Aura\"&gt;Improved&lt;/a&gt;, most mages can afford to put only 2-4 points into this ability to achieve close or full pushback immunity."}

Against summoned units, it deals an additional 20 damage on them. This makes it excellent against discouraging hero rushes, as the tower quickly drains the enemy heroes of vital mana needed to continually harass a base.\nOnce the Magic Sentry technology is researched, Arcane Towers can start revealing areas of the map.

Found mainly in the blood elven capital, &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt;, they patrol it with fervor and serve as the city's elite guard force while supplementing the &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City%20Guardian\"&gt;Silvermoon City Guardian&lt;/a&gt;s in their duties. They will periodically announce words of encouragement, sing praises to the blood elven regent &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;, urge the people of Silvermoon to remain strong in the wake of &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;'s betrayal, and remind the citizens of Quel'Thalas to remain law-abiding.\nAside from those found in Quel'Thalas, other blood elven organizations such as the &lt;a href=\"Scryers\"&gt;Scryers&lt;/a&gt; have made use of their arcane guardians. Following the formation of the &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Sun%20Offensive\"&gt;Shattered Sun Offensive&lt;/a&gt;, this faction also employed several guardians during the effort to retake the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Isle of Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nSeveral blood elven arcane golems have also been modified by the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; and imbued with demonic power.

The former have dispensed familiar-looking models from &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt;, while the latter have created guardians with a violet color scheme. Both forces have also created an alteration of the older arcane golem model: the &lt;a href=\"Pyrestar%20Demolisher\"&gt;Pyrestar Demolisher&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Sunreaver%20Onslaught\"&gt;Sunreaver Onslaught&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Destroyer%20%28Isle%20of%20Thunder%29\"&gt;Arcane Destroyer&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor%20Offensive\"&gt;Kirin Tor Offensive&lt;/a&gt;.

It is also here that magical sentries may be called to allow the human towers to detect invisible enemy invaders.\nHigh elven and blood elven arcane sanctum.\nThe arcane sanctum helped the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; to fend off &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; as he tried to attack their capital city of &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; in ' by training units. However, the arcane sanctum couldn't be built by the &lt;a href=\"Peasant%20%28high%20elf%29\"&gt;high elf worker&lt;/a&gt; unit likely due to the limited ability of the map editor prior to the ' expansion. With the addition of the \"The Frozen Throne\" expansion's map editor, it is possible to make additional groups with building orders.\nThe arcane sanctum also helped the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20the%20Blood%20Elves\"&gt;Curse of the Blood Elves&lt;/a&gt; campaign in \"The Frozen Throne\". This arcane sanctum produced unique blood elven-only units. \nWorld of Warcraft.\nWith the introduction of the blood elves in \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\", the arcane sanctum officially entered the game at the following locations:"}

Many &lt;a href=\"race\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt;s wield arcane power carelessly, disregarding the lessons of the past. The arcanist class encompasses all users of arcane magic \u2014 those who seek power without regard for consequences, and those who think arcane can be handled responsibly; each arcane spellcaster chooses a distinct path. Those who wish to manipulate arcane magic often choose between the way of the &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;. Each path specializes in a particular kind of magic, which reflects the nature and practice of the arcane arts on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. In a world forged in war and beset by pervasive evils such as the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, arcanists have gradually come to excel in specific areas of arcane magic. What Azeroth's arcanists lack in versatility, however, they more than make up for in the abilities they acquire and the powers they wield within their chosen paths.\n&lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;Dwarves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; are all capable of becoming mages. The dark path of the necromancer is rarely taken. Humans and the Forsaken practice this black art, while most other races seem not to have the stomach for such magic. Warlocks are uncommon. Some exist among the Forsaken, outcast gnomes, or humans and &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s foolish enough to toy with the forces of demonic energy. The few remaining high elves who are warlocks have long since become &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;. Arcanists can have the best of intentions, and while mages mostly tend to be from the good and lawful alignments, necromancers and warlocks tend to come from the more unsavory levels of morality.\nArcanists are found among all of the affiliations, regardless of their practices, in both the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. Warlocks are far more common in the Alliance, surprisingly enough \u2014 the fact that the use of arcane magic is so prevalent in the Alliance possibly allows for such reckless practices. Still, mages are far more common in the Alliance, outnumbering warlocks immensely. Necromancers are almost unheard of until someone encounters one."}

Years later, he was eliminated by &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s sent to weaken the defense of the monastery.\nA living version of Doan can still be seen in &lt;a href=\"Old%20Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Old Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nThe Ashbringer.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, Doan was a member of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;. He was summoned with his comrades of the Order to the meeting of &lt;a href=\"Highlord%20Mograine\"&gt;Highlord Mograine&lt;/a&gt; at the inn of &lt;a href=\"Southshore\"&gt;Southshore&lt;/a&gt;, among them were present &lt;a href=\"Isillien\"&gt;Isillien&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fairbanks\"&gt;Fairbanks&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"High%20General%20Abbendis\"&gt;Abbendis&lt;/a&gt;. He was initially skeptical of Alexandros' idea to \u200b\u200buse the dark crystal he found from an &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, but quickly changed his mind when he saw it consume the holy light used by Isillien to destroy it. He then asked his \"brothers\" to participate in an experiment, and together, they succeeded in purifying what would later become the heart of the &lt;a href=\"Ashbringer\"&gt;Ashbringer&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Saidan%20Dathrohan\"&gt;Lord Commander Saidan Dathrohan&lt;/a&gt; informed them of the &lt;a href=\"Culling%20of%20Stratholme\"&gt;Culling of Stratholme&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Prince Arthas&lt;/a&gt;' suspension of the Silver Hand, the mage followed his comrades to explore all available options to wipe out the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. He was later present in &lt;a href=\"Hearthglen\"&gt;Hearthglen&lt;/a&gt;, where during a meeting on Lordaeron's situation he proposed to focus their efforts to contain the plague.\nFollowing the death of Alexandros Mograine, he joined the ranks of the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt;, and attended the ceremony of induction of &lt;a href=\"Renault%20Mograine\"&gt;Renault Mograine&lt;/a&gt; as a paladin into the ranks of the Crusade.\nWhen the Scourge attacked Hearthglen, Doan was present on the ramparts of the fortified town. When Isillien ordered him to fight, he asked him to be patient and explained that he needed to conserved save energy for the right moment. Once ready, the mage unleashed a powerful blizzard which decimated the waves of undead.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nHe is the keeper of the Monastery's library; a guardian of the arcane that the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; is rumored to distrust. Yet he is indeed a trusted official of the Crusade, keeping a &lt;a href=\"The%20Scarlet%20Key\"&gt;vital key&lt;/a&gt; that grants access to Scarlet operations across the &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands\"&gt;Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;. Arcanist Doan believes that arcane magic is the only way to rid Lordaeron of the Scourge.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Hillsbrad\"&gt;Old Hillsbrad&lt;/a&gt; instance of the &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt;, Doan is present in the inn of &lt;a href=\"Southshore\"&gt;Southshore&lt;/a&gt; for the meeting with the other members of the Silver Hand, the two paladins Alexandros Mograine and &lt;a href=\"Brigitte%20Abbendis\"&gt;Brigitte Abbendis&lt;/a&gt;, and the two priests Fairbanks and Isillien, wearing the same tabard of Lordaeron as the other members of Mograine's circle of trusted friends. Unlike the comic, High General Abbendis is not present but is replaced by his daughter, while &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt; is present although it is not the case in the comic.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, he is mentioned in &lt;a href=\"The%20Schools%20of%20Arcane%20Magic%20-%20Abjuration\"&gt;The Schools of Arcane Magic - Abjuration&lt;/a&gt; for his Arcane Bubble spell. He has perfected that spell that combines Evocation and Abjuration to shield himself for a short time and provides him a degree of near invulnerability for a precious few seconds. Few mages have the capacity to cast it safely.\nAs evidenced by the &lt;a href=\"Arcanist%20Doan%27s%20Silver%20Coin\"&gt;silver coin he has thrown into Dalaran's fountain&lt;/a&gt;, Doan has a crush on &lt;a href=\"Brigitte%20Abbendis\"&gt;Abbendis&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nHe was assassinated by &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s sent to take down the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Monastery\"&gt;Scarlet Monastery&lt;/a&gt;'s defenses before a true invasion can begin, as he maintained some of these powerful defenses to protect his comrades, and because he was teaching arcane magic to his apprentices and not the Light.\nMists of Pandaria.\nFollowing his death, Doan was replaced by &lt;a href=\"Flameweaver%20Koegler\"&gt;Flameweaver Koegler&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Athenaeum%20%28Scarlet%20Monastery%29\"&gt;Athenaeum&lt;/a&gt;, as the keeper of the Monastery Library and the trainer of mages in the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Monastery\"&gt;Scarlet Monastery&lt;/a&gt;.\nStrategy.\nThe one thing to watch out for is his Detonation spell he uses when at half-health. This can inflict HUGE amounts of damage to the targets. His Detonation spell can be avoided if you move out of line of sight, so if you tank him near the doorway, you can just move out of line of sight. He will cast it at 50 percent health just after he casts Arcane Bubble. \nDoan also uses an AoE silence which can severely limit healers and casters. Due to the relatively small size of his room, the only way for a caster to avoid its large AoE easily is to stay in the corridor, in which case the tank must take care to keep himself and Doan in the casters LOS.\nHe also Polymorphs a target, so make sure that your priests and paladins dispel it. Druids can shift out of polymorph, Shaman have grounding totem for Polymorph, Paladins can bubble out of it, the polymorph cast can be Counterspelled.\nOverall, this encounter is pretty simple.\nLoot.\nDoan is a popular solo-farming target for Enchanting Rogues and Druids, as there is no stealth-detection on the mobs leading up to him, and he can be engaged without any adds.\nRelatives.\nHe may be related to , an Undercity trades good vendor."}

Hoping to find a way to calm them of their feral nature or even cure them, he kept withered subjects within the walls of the city in order to study them. At one point, one of his subjects escaped and ran amok in the royal gardens of the city. After this incident, Kel'danath was ordered to kill all the withered in his possession and cease his research entirely. He refused to do so, and was therefore exiled from the city.\nRelocating to &lt;a href=\"Ambervale\"&gt;Ambervale&lt;/a&gt;, where there was an abundance of withered, Kel'danath resumed his studies. He construced arcane wards around the perimeter of his base of operations, putting great effort into finding a way to scare the withered off without harming them. However, these wards did little to deter the wildlife around the area.\nThe arcanist kept a log of his studies day by day. Initially, he spent thirteen days of study attempting to communicate with the withered, but to no avail. However, on his fourteenth day, he found that his sixteenth subject, which he named &lt;a href=\"Theryn\"&gt;Theryn&lt;/a&gt;, was much different. Theryn's arcane essence was much more soothed than other withered, having been touched by some mysterious power. On his sixteenth day, using Theryn's essence as a base, Kel'danath created a &lt;a href=\"Spellstone%20of%20Kel%27danath\"&gt;spellstone&lt;/a&gt; that calmed the withered, at least sometimes. His twelfth subject, &lt;a href=\"Shal%27an\"&gt;Shal'an&lt;/a&gt;, remained particularly stubborn.\nOn his twenty-fourth day, Kel'danath awoke to &lt;a href=\"Valewalker%20Farodin\"&gt;Valewalker Farodin&lt;/a&gt; holding his blade to his neck. Farodin asked what he was doing to the withered. Kel'danath simply replied, \"searching for a cure.\" At this, Farodin merely grunted, and then disappeared back into the woods.\nOn his fortieth day of study, a massive &lt;a href=\"ettin\"&gt;ettin&lt;/a&gt; wrecked his workshop at &lt;a href=\"Koralune%20Manor\"&gt;Koralune Manor&lt;/a&gt;. Kel'danath managed to scare the ettin away with magic, but he had a feeling he would return.\nOn his fiftieth day, Kel'danath had truly begun to wither himself. As the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; poured from the sky into Suramar, Kel'danath realized he could no longer protect his withered, so he released them. In his final log, it is apparent he realized he would be joining his former subjects in their state, and so implored the reader to find his spellstone and carry on his work.\nWhen Kel'danath's old colleague &lt;a href=\"First%20Arcanist%20Thalyssra\"&gt;First Arcanist Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt; was exiled, she attempted to reach Ambervale to look for him. She would later send her new &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;outlander&lt;/a&gt; allies to do so in her place. With help from his magical log, the outlanders found the arcanist withered entirely, and he had to be unfortunately put down. However, both the spellstone and Theryn were retrieved and brought back to Thalyssra in &lt;a href=\"Shal%27Aran\"&gt;Shal'Aran&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlthough Kel'danath himself died, his actions led to the growth of a new &lt;a href=\"Arcan%27dor\"&gt;Arcan'dor&lt;/a&gt;, and in effect, the salvation of the entire Nightborne race."}

As one of the original members and leaders of the Nightfallen, Valtrois was heavily involved in the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20rebellion\"&gt;Nightfallen rebellion&lt;/a&gt; that raged through &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third coming&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Alongside her leader &lt;a href=\"First%20Arcanist%20Thalyssra\"&gt;First Arcanist Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt;, Valtrois and the other resistance fighters would spearhead the charge to topple the regime of &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magistrix%20Elisande\"&gt;Grand Magistrix Elisande&lt;/a&gt; and drive the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s from Suramar.\nProud and somewhat haughty, Valtrois would be particularly instrumental in overseeing the development of the system of &lt;a href=\"Ley%20line\"&gt;ley&lt;/a&gt; stations that fed much of the rebellion's efforts, especially early on. As the conflict progressed, her intelligence and deep knowledge of the &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; would see her become one of Thalyssra's chief lieutenants, and instrumental to the insurrection.\nBiography.\nThe Nightfallen.\nValtrois lived in &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar City&lt;/a&gt; at the time of the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; as a skilled &lt;a href=\"arcanist\"&gt;arcanist&lt;/a&gt;. By the time of the rebellion alone, she had spent thousands of years studying &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"ley%20line\"&gt;ley line&lt;/a&gt;s. With the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s' arrival, the &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt; were largely torn as to how to deal with the threat. &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magistrix%20Elisande\"&gt;Grand Magistrix Elisande&lt;/a&gt; would ultimately choose to ally with the Legion in exchange for sparing &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt;, a decision which many deeply opposed. Valtrois was one such dissenter, believing that, with the &lt;a href=\"Nightwell\"&gt;Nightwell&lt;/a&gt;, the Suramar was fully capable of standing against the demon hordes. &lt;a href=\"First%20Arcanist%20Thalyssra\"&gt;First Arcanist Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt; would ultimately lead a failed coup against Elisande's rule in an attempt to prevent the demonic alliance though it proved a decisive failure, and the Burning Legion would enter Suramar City for the first time in over 10,000 years.\nThough it is unclear whether Valtrois directly took part in Thalyssra's coup, she was nonetheless exiled immediately afterward, being forced to wander the greater Suramar region, and cut off from the vital energies of the Nightwell. To survive, the arcanist had to scavenge &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Mana\"&gt;ancient mana&lt;/a&gt; from the areas abandoned ley stations. Nevertheless, starved of the Nightwell's power, Valtrois physically &lt;a href=\"withered\"&gt;withered&lt;/a&gt; into a &lt;a href=\"nightfallen\"&gt;nightfallen&lt;/a&gt; state, a shadow of her former self; however, despite her circumstances, she remained loyal to First Arcanist Thalyssra's position.\nOn one occasion, as Valtrois attempted to gain entry to &lt;a href=\"Ley%20Station%20Anora\"&gt;Ley Station Anora&lt;/a&gt;, she encountered an &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;outlander&lt;/a&gt; sent by Thalyssra to also investigate the ruin. Not aware of who sent them, Valtrois soon threatened to slay the outlander, before relenting upon being shown the &lt;a href=\"First%20Arcanist%27s%20Token\"&gt;First Arcanist's token&lt;/a&gt;. With the help of Thalyssra's agent, Valtrois was able to successfully reactivate the ley station and direct its flow back to &lt;a href=\"Shal%27Aran\"&gt;Shal'Aran&lt;/a&gt;, the base of the newly-formed &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Nightfallen&lt;/a&gt; resistance faction.\nValtrois would return to Shal'Aran and work closely with Thalyssra, now joined also by &lt;a href=\"Chief%20Telemancer%20Oculeth\"&gt;Chief Telemancer Oculeth&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the outlander, to create the foundations for their rebellion. Specifically, she focused on tapping into Suramar's potent ley line grid to directly bring power to Shal'Aran. As with her fellow nightfallen, Valtrois would also have to regularly be fed sources of ancient mana to prevent further mental and physical deterioration.\nA change of seasons.\nAs the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20rebellion\"&gt;Nightfallen rebellion&lt;/a&gt; continued to grow, so too did Shal'Aran's leyline grid. Under Valtrois's guidance, all of Suramar's latent lay stations were brought online, bringing with them a vast quantity of power. The &lt;a href=\"arcan%27dor\"&gt;arcan'dor&lt;/a&gt;, a tree of incredible power growing in the center of subterranean Shal'Aran, would also be fed by this influx of power from the leylines. Later in the conflict, Valtrois dispatched forces to the &lt;a href=\"Arcway\"&gt;Arcway&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar City&lt;/a&gt; in order to retrieve an &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20Leyline%20Map\"&gt;ancient map&lt;/a&gt; detailing the network of Suramar's leylines.\nEventually, the arcan'dor neared maturation. Having been fed by the energies of Suramar's leylines thus far, the tree now required a substantial additional burst of power to fully mature. With the help of Valtrois and her expertise, a plan was formed to spark a manastorm under the main ley conduit of Suramar City, thereby sending a surge of energy directly to Shal'Aran; Valtrois herself created the warp-field device that was used to generate the manastorm. The operation would ultimately be successful, and from Shal'Aran Valtrois was able to direct the massive influx into the arcan'dor, providing it with the resources it needed.\nThe arcan'dor would soon afterwards produce powerful &lt;a href=\"Fruit%20of%20the%20Arcan%27dor\"&gt;fruit&lt;/a&gt; with the ability to free &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt; of their addiction to the &lt;a href=\"Nightwell\"&gt;Nightwell&lt;/a&gt;, and even reverse the &lt;a href=\"nightfallen\"&gt;nightfallen&lt;/a&gt; state. The resistance's leaders (Valtrois, &lt;a href=\"Thalyssra\"&gt;Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Oculeth\"&gt;Oculeth&lt;/a&gt;) were the first to partake of the new gift, and were restored to their original healthy forms, a turn of events which greatly relieved Valtrois.\nInsurrection.\nAfter the events surrounding the maturation of the &lt;a href=\"arcan%27dor\"&gt;arcan'dor&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Nightfallen&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20rebellion\"&gt;revolution&lt;/a&gt; had secured immense gains over &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magistrix%20Elisande\"&gt;Grand Magistrix Elisande&lt;/a&gt; and her allies, and continued to do so. No longer &lt;a href=\"Withered\"&gt;withering&lt;/a&gt; herself, Valtrois took the opportunity to study the &lt;a href=\"ley%20line\"&gt;ley line&lt;/a&gt;s of the regions bordering &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt;. She believed that these new ley lines could also be harnessed to feed the recent surge of &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt; refugees into &lt;a href=\"Shal%27Aran\"&gt;Shal'Aran&lt;/a&gt;, for whom there was not yet enough &lt;a href=\"Fruit%20of%20the%20Arcan%27dor\"&gt;arcan'dor fruit&lt;/a&gt; to go around. The arcanist subsequently journeyed to the &lt;a href=\"Ley-Ruins%20of%20Zarkhenar\"&gt;Ley-Ruins of Zarkhenar&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Azsuna\"&gt;Azsuna&lt;/a&gt; alongside a Nightfallen &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champion&lt;/a&gt; to investigate.\nThere, Valtrois and her companion would be confronted by the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragon\"&gt;blue dragon&lt;/a&gt; and member of the &lt;a href=\"Azurewing\"&gt;Azurewing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stellagosa\"&gt;Stellagosa&lt;/a&gt;, who expressed deep suspicion at their goal. Ultimately, Stellagosa would aid in Valtrois's mission (though mainly to keep an eye on the arcanist) and was vital in identifying the precise locations of the ley lines to be tapped. Despite her initial animosity towards the &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;, Valtrois would gradually warm to Stellagosa, often through exchanges of witty banter. With a final ritual to properly redirect the flow (aided by Stellagosa) and having withstood a small army of feral &lt;a href=\"withered\"&gt;withered&lt;/a&gt;, Valtrois would succeed in her goal of diverting some of &lt;a href=\"Azsuna\"&gt;Azsuna&lt;/a&gt;'s ley line power to Shal'Aran.\nAfter the mission, Stellagosa would fly Valtrois and her champion back to Shal'Aran personally. Fascinated by the blue dragon's deeply insightful knowledge regarding the ley lines, and apparently enjoying her company, Valtrois would subsequently spend more time with Stellagosa, even after arriving back in &lt;a href=\"Shal%27Aran\"&gt;Shal'Aran&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe rebellion would continue to secure the upper hand in the civil war, eventually being reinforced with allies in the forms of the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;. Together, these united forces would lay siege to &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar City&lt;/a&gt; and, in time, assault the nightborne metropolis in full. Valtrois took part in this major campaign, which would ultimately face a significant setback at the gates of the &lt;a href=\"Nighthold\"&gt;Nighthold&lt;/a&gt; itself. Elisande, drawing on her potent time magic, was able to trap the elven forces within a time spell, rendering them immobile and neutralized.\nWith the main attack stalled, &lt;a href=\"First%20Arcanist%20Thalyssra\"&gt;First Arcanist Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt; hurriedly investigated other routes into the Nighthold, discovering the existence of a breach and access point &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20Depths\"&gt;underneath&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20Order\"&gt;Sanctum of Order&lt;/a&gt;. Thalyssra charged Valtrois with examining breach and the magical seal securing it. Valtrois's own investigation would take her to the ruin of &lt;a href=\"Kel%27balor\"&gt;Kel'balor&lt;/a&gt;, where she found that Elisande's forces were secretly drawing significant power for the seal from the ley station there. She quickly set to work on a plan to overcome the breach's barrier.\nBefore long, Valtrois devised a plan to finally gain access to the breach to the Nighthold, which involved placing energy disruptors at key points around Suramar City. Doing this effectively broke the links sustaining the barrier at the breach and provided an opportunity for the rebels. Valtrois subsequently worked with the other Nightfallen leaders in a coordinated attack on the breach, held by Elisande's new First Arcanist &lt;a href=\"Andaris%20Narassin\"&gt;Andaris Narassin&lt;/a&gt;. Together, and utilizing the power of the &lt;a href=\"withered\"&gt;withered&lt;/a&gt;, they were able to overcome the breach's magical and physical defenses, defeating and slaying Andaris in the process. This victory would conclusively open the way for a final assault on the &lt;a href=\"Nighthold\"&gt;Nighthold&lt;/a&gt; itself.\nIn a fierce battle that acted as the culmination of the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20rebellion\"&gt;rebellion&lt;/a&gt;, the Nightfallen forces gradually fought their way through the Nighthold, defeating Elisande's supporters one-by-one. Valtrois herself was present on the scene, along with the main leaders of the insurrection, who gathered in the courtyard of the fortress. Ultimately, Elisande herself was slain, and the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s plans for Suramar subsequently dashed.\nIn the aftermath of their victory, &lt;a href=\"First%20Arcanist%20Thalyssra\"&gt;First Arcanist Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt; would return to the &lt;a href=\"Nightwell\"&gt;Nightwell&lt;/a&gt; to determine its role in the future of Suramar, accompanied by Valtrois and &lt;a href=\"Oculeth\"&gt;Oculeth&lt;/a&gt;. There they discovered that the font of power was unstable, and at risk of dying in the absence of the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Aman%27thul\"&gt;Eye of Aman'thul&lt;/a&gt;. Valtrois suggested that the Nightwell be immediately stabilized; though the &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt; were no longer addicted to its energies, she posited that it could still provide immense power. Despite this temptation, Thalyssra would choose to allow the Nightwell to die, so that Suramar could forge a new and brighter future. Valtrois herself would decide to respect Thalyssra's judgment, and trust in her continued leadership.\nSuramar restored.\n&lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt; would eventually recover from the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20rebellion\"&gt;civil war&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic occupation, under the of &lt;a href=\"First%20Arcanist%20Thalyssra\"&gt;First Arcanist Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Nightfallen&lt;/a&gt;. Shortly before the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, Thalyssra chose to seek new allies for the &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt; as they reentered the world after thousands of years of isolation.\nThe First Arcanist would meet with &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; in order to discuss her people's potential entry into the faction. At the &lt;a href=\"Estate%20of%20the%20First%20Arcanist\"&gt;Estate of the First Arcanist&lt;/a&gt;, the two discussed the details of this, with Valtrois and several others also present. Thalyssra subsequently accepted Liadrin's invitation to visit &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt;, and traveled there accompanied by Valtrois and &lt;a href=\"Silgryn\"&gt;Silgryn&lt;/a&gt;. After meeting with the &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elf&lt;/a&gt; Regent Lord &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"high%20elf\"&gt;high elf&lt;/a&gt; hero &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, the nightborne trio would take part in a visit to the mythical &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Isle of Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere, prompted by Alleria Windrunner's connection to the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;, the Sunwell and those gathered around it were attacked by the forces of &lt;a href=\"Nether-Prince%20Durzaan\"&gt;Nether-Prince Durzaan&lt;/a&gt;.

From his research, he figured that the Nightwell initially drew power from the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Aman%27Thul\"&gt;Eye of Aman'Thul&lt;/a&gt;, which was imbued with the power of the titan himself. After its collapse, the energies previously trapped in it complicated the influence of &lt;a href=\"Aman%27Thul\"&gt;Aman'Thul&lt;/a&gt; scattered about the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;, as releasing Aman'Thul's power brought more chaos than harmony, with his power growing more and more unstable.\nWhen Arcanomancer Vridiel was brought the &lt;a href=\"Cursed%20Shard\"&gt;Cursed Shard&lt;/a&gt; - an unnatural metallic shard that shifted from color to color, and that swelled in size before melting away at one's touch, with its droplets hitting the ground with a hiss and giving out a noxious stench - he cursed &lt;a href=\"Illidan\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt;. The appearance of &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt; over &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; accelerated the reaction triggered by the Nightwell's collapse, and Vridiel believed that the Legion's actions on Argus were further destabilizing the powers that people drew upon unknowingly for many years. The changes the substance had undergone since the \"&lt;a href=\"Vindicaar\"&gt;Vindicaar&lt;/a&gt;\" departed for Argus were also alarming. The reaction's intensity was accelerating by the day, and Vridiel feared they may win the fight against the Legion only to lose something very dear to them.\nQuotes.\nAny lout with a hammer and tongs can bang steel.

He will then solicit the player's help. Hobart is also one of the dozens of past NPC's encountered by adventurers to assist in killing the elementals at &lt;a href=\"Sethria%27s%20Roost\"&gt;Sethria's Roost&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt;, he traveled to &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; where he sold engineering supplies. To fight the demons, he made a lot of guns. However, since Azeroth's heroes were finding artifacts all over the world, his weapons become useless, so he decided to get rid of them. As such, he supplied &lt;a href=\"Fargo%20Flintlocke\"&gt;Fargo Flintlocke&lt;/a&gt; with guns and ammo. Later, he tried to turn guns into useful tools, creating a &lt;a href=\"Prototype%20Pump-Action%20Bandage%20Gun\"&gt;gun that shot bandages&lt;/a&gt;. He continued working with Fargo, sending him to &lt;a href=\"Stormheim\"&gt;Stormheim&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Murloc%20Trinket\"&gt;some materials&lt;/a&gt; for his new type of wormhole generator.\nLater, Hobart sent Fargo to test his new &lt;a href=\"Hobart%27s%20Prototype%20Gunshoes\"&gt;gunshoes&lt;/a&gt; and gunpacks to &lt;a href=\"Azsuna\"&gt;Azsuna&lt;/a&gt;. The dwarf wasn't very satisfied with the inventions as they kept exploding. Subsequently, he requested the &lt;a href=\"%3ARunestone%20of%20Vitality\"&gt;:Runestone of Vitality&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Odyn\"&gt;Odyn&lt;/a&gt; and used its power on a pile of gun parts. He intended to mass-market the gun parts as toys for children.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, Hobart was a part of the Horde's forces in &lt;a href=\"Drustvar\"&gt;Drustvar&lt;/a&gt;. After &lt;a href=\"Krazzlefrazz%20Outpost\"&gt;Krazzlefrazz Outpost&lt;/a&gt; was established, Hobart joined the Horde &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;'s team as an &lt;a href=\"engineer\"&gt;engineer&lt;/a&gt;. He accompanied the Horde into the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Fleet%20shipwrecks\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt; on the \"&lt;a href=\"Banshee%27s%20Wail\"&gt;Banshee's Wail&lt;/a&gt;\", and provided the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Speaker of the Horde&lt;/a&gt; with a diving helmet to withstand the water pressure, instructions to use the said helmet, and communicate with them as they carried out their mission to acquire the body of &lt;a href=\"Marshal%20M.%20Valentine\"&gt;Marshal M. Valentine&lt;/a&gt;. However, the \"Banshee's Wail\" was infiltrated by the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; champion, forcing Hobart to put on his mechanical suit, ready to knock the invader off the ship. Subsequently, &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20Gryphon%20Rider%20%28War%20Campaign%29\"&gt;WIldhammer Gryphon Riders&lt;/a&gt; were seen throwing lightning hammers at him.\nUnaware of the Alliance attack, the Speaker killed the wildlife to help charge the communication network within the helmet, and while the Alliance was driven back. With communication secured, Hobart ordered the Speaker to kill the &lt;a href=\"undead%20dragon\"&gt;undead dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Daenistrasz\"&gt;Daenistrasz&lt;/a&gt; in order to claim Valentine's body. With the dragon slain, Hobart ordered the Speaker to return to the \"Banshee's Wail\" with Valentine's body and anything else of value. Thus, the Speaker discovered and brought the body of &lt;a href=\"Derek%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Derek Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; to the ship as well.\nAfter this, Hobart appeared in &lt;a href=\"Plunder%20Harbor\"&gt;Plunder Harbor&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Tiragarde%20Sound\"&gt;Tiragarde Sound&lt;/a&gt; with his &lt;a href=\"Hobart%27s%20Flying%20Machine\"&gt;flying machine&lt;/a&gt;. He can also be seen in the &lt;a href=\"MOTHERLODE%21%21\"&gt;Motherlode&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnlike his fellow &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt;, Hobart sat out the conflict between &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;.\nGoblins exalted with the &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Cartel\"&gt;Bilgewater Cartel&lt;/a&gt; were later sent to deliver a &lt;a href=\"Mysterious%20Package\"&gt;Mysterious Package&lt;/a&gt; to Hobart Grapplehammer only to discover that &lt;a href=\"Jastor%20Gallywix\"&gt;Trade Prince Gallywix&lt;/a&gt; has not only used forgery to get Hobart under contract but has managed to buy all of &lt;a href=\"Crapopolis\"&gt;Crapopolis&lt;/a&gt; within the Motherlode. Upon discovering that Hobart had no intention of giving him the &lt;a href=\"X-52%20Personnel%20Armor\"&gt;X-52 Personnel Armor&lt;/a&gt;, Gallywix and &lt;a href=\"Hired%20Scoundrel\"&gt;Hired Scoundrel&lt;/a&gt;s attacked Hobart's workshop only to be driven back. Despite this minor setback, Gallywix returned with greater numbers and took Hobart prisoner, with the intention of claiming the armor as his own. However, Hobart stubbornly refused to yield to Gallywix to the point of giving the X-52 Personnel Armor to Gallywix's &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20%28playable%29\"&gt;old rival&lt;/a&gt;. The resulting fight between old rivals ended with Gallywix trapped his own armor and forced to renegotiate his contract with Hobart, whose shaking him down actually impressed the Trade Prince.\nBy the time of the formation of the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Council\"&gt;Horde Council&lt;/a&gt;, Gallywix had left the Horde and the Bilgewater Cartel, and it is unknown how this affected Hobart's contract with him.\nInventions.\nHobart Grapplehammer claims to be the genius behind many products brought to the &lt;a href=\"Kajaro%20Trading%20Company\"&gt;Kajaro Trading Company&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href=\"%3AKaja%27Cola\"&gt;:Kaja'Cola&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Poultryizer\"&gt;Poultryizer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Town-In-A-Box\"&gt;Town-In-A-Box&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lab-In-A-Box\"&gt;Lab-In-A-Box&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Hobart%27s%20Ingenious%20Cap%20of%20Mook%20Foolery\"&gt;Ingenious Cap of Mook Foolery&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"KTC%20Train-a-Tron%20Deluxe\"&gt;KTC Train-a-Tron Deluxe&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20All-In-1-Der%20Belt\"&gt;Amazing G-Ray&lt;/a&gt;, Never-Deflating Pool Ponies, &lt;a href=\"%3AThe%20Big%20One\"&gt;:The Big One&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Warrior-Matic%20NX-01\"&gt;Warrior-Matic NX-01&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"gilgoblin\"&gt;gilgoblin&lt;/a&gt;s.\nBefore the eruption of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Kajaro\"&gt;Mount Kajaro&lt;/a&gt;, Hobart was working on two new projects, the &lt;a href=\"Micro%20Mechachicken\"&gt;Micro Mechachicken&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Subject%20Nine\"&gt;Subject Nine&lt;/a&gt;. While on the &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Isles\"&gt;Lost Isles&lt;/a&gt; he designed and built the greatest fighting submersible of all time, the &lt;a href=\"Mechashark%20X-Steam\"&gt;Mechashark X-Steam&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlong with &lt;a href=\"Jastor%20Gallywix\"&gt;Jastor Gallywix&lt;/a&gt;, Hobart developed &lt;a href=\"The%20Bomb\"&gt;a massive bomb&lt;/a&gt; out of &lt;a href=\"azsharite\"&gt;azsharite&lt;/a&gt; that would later be used on &lt;a href=\"Thal%27darah%20Grove\"&gt;Thal'darah Grove&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. In Drustvar he created the &lt;a href=\"Wolfercycle\"&gt;Wolfercycle&lt;/a&gt;, though it quickly crashed.\nOther items belonging to Hobard include &lt;a href=\"Hobart%27s%20Ingenious%20Cap%20of%20Mook%20Foolery\"&gt;Hobart's Ingenious Cap of Mook Foolery&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hobart%27s%20Prototype%20Gunshoes\"&gt;Hobart's Prototype Gunshoes&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Hobart%27s%20Spare%20Hubcap\"&gt;Hobart's Spare Hubcap&lt;/a&gt;.\nVeracity of his inventions.\nHe's been advised not to claim he created the gilgoblins by his counsel, due to a negligence case brought up over them. It was also later revealed by &lt;a href=\"Lenu%20Gillbrack\"&gt;Lenu Gillbrack&lt;/a&gt; that Hobart's claims of inventing them was a lie. In fact, it seems he may not have been forthright about his \"inventions\" and is possible he didn't create some of them.\nQuotes.\nThese exhanges happen in random order.\nFor dialog with &lt;a href=\"Assistant%20Greely\"&gt;Assistant Greely&lt;/a&gt; before takeoff to &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Skies\"&gt;Twilight Skies&lt;/a&gt;, look &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Skies%20%282%29%23Transcript\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nAnything worth having is worth fitting inside of a box.\nExcept people, of course!

{"id": "32973", "revid": "41339159", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=32973", "title": "Hobgoblin", "text": "Hobgoblins, sometimes known simply as brutes, oafs, or mooks, are large, mutated &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s most commonly found guarding goblin settlements, acting as bodyguards or even serving as mounts. They were once regular goblins, but have been altered by some foul &lt;a href=\"alchemy\"&gt;alchemy&lt;/a&gt; to become tough, powerful, and \"dumber than an &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt; with a hangover\".\nThe sweat of hobgoblins is considered acidic. They are shown to be affected by &lt;a href=\"kaja%27mite\"&gt;kaja'mite&lt;/a&gt; just like normal goblins. According to &lt;a href=\"Sky%20Admiral%20Rogers\"&gt;Sky Admiral Rogers&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Dominance%20Offensive\"&gt;Dominance Offensive&lt;/a&gt; brought in &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Mook\"&gt;Heavy Mook&lt;/a&gt;s in order to hide behind their bodies during the battles in the &lt;a href=\"Krasarang%20Wilds\"&gt;Krasarang Wilds&lt;/a&gt;.\nHobgoblins made their first appearance in \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" with the \"\" expansion.\nIn the RPG.\nBackground.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Alchemists%27%20Union\"&gt;Alchemists' Union&lt;/a&gt;'s greatest creations are the dread hobgoblins. As large as an orc and resembling a bulky purple goblin, hobgoblins are alchemically created for strength and simplicity, despite their physical and emotional instability. Hobgoblin don't wander around the world too often as almost all members of the subrace are kept in Undermine\u2019s halls, however, the occasional hobgoblin forms some form of independence and escapes. Hobgoblins are stupid, brutal troops that goblins created with their mad alchemy. Goblins created hobgoblins by experimenting on their own kind. The alchemically-wrought changes in hobgoblins did more than increase their size and strength and decrease their mental faculties. Perhaps the most well-known fact about them is their short lives. If a hobgoblin lives to his third year, he's ancient. Hobgoblins either don\u2019t realize their lives are pitifully short (which is likely, due to their limited intellect) or they don't care. Hobgoblins can also alter their personal metabolisms, channeling their adrenalin into the muscles that most need it. Their sweat is acidic, and they are capable of bursts of amazing speed that will reduce them to unconscious piles.\nOne frightening change the alchemy wrought was on hobgoblin emotions and psychology. Hobgoblins are unstable, and their goblin masters find them difficult to control. They have a number of tactics \u2014 ranging from the violent to the culinary \u2014 to convince hobgoblins to obey, but because of this instability goblins use hobgoblins only rarely. Hobgoblins grunt out phrases in &lt;a href=\"Common%20%28language%29\"&gt;Common&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20%28language%29\"&gt;Goblin&lt;/a&gt;. When hobgoblins use one of their alchemically-created abilities, they secrete a sticky acid that build up on their skin and eventually becomes coated with this acid. Creatures that touch them or are touched by them are harmed by this acid. If enough of this acid builds up they are capable of shaking themselves like a dog, spraying the acid on nearby creatures. However, this acid is also highly flammable and will burst into flames should the hobgoblin come into contact with fire. The most insane hobgoblins set themselves on fire before entering combat."}

In fact, the &lt;a href=\"frost%20giant\"&gt;frost giant&lt;/a&gt;s who once guarded the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Winter\"&gt;Temple of Winter&lt;/a&gt; were killed by Loken's pet &lt;a href=\"fire%20giant\"&gt;fire giant&lt;/a&gt;s and Hodir himself was taken captive in &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt;, which caused the previously established cold weather patterns at the temple to cease.\nUlduar.\nNow the watcher dwells in an ice cave in the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Winter\"&gt;Halls of Winter&lt;/a&gt;, forced to serve the will of &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt;.

Odyn sends his &lt;a href=\"Valarjar\"&gt;Valarjar&lt;/a&gt; to aid the forces of Ulduar in their defenses, and Hodir chases the demons through a portal as they retreat. On the other side, in &lt;a href=\"Niskara\"&gt;Niskara&lt;/a&gt;, Hodir was captured and corrupted by the Legion, but &lt;a href=\"Thorim\"&gt;Thorim&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Valarjar\"&gt;Valarjar&lt;/a&gt; work together to save him.

Now the watcher dwells in an ice cave in the Halls of Winter, forced to serve the will of &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nOverview.\nBreak out allies trapped in Flash Freeze. Once freed they will provide assistance in various ways.\nAbilities.\nAllied Adventurers.\nAllied Adventurers begin the fight encased in Flash Freeze. Once freed they will grant their aid until Frozen again.\nHard Mode.\nDefeat Hodir quickly to prevent him from destroying the Rare Cache of Winter.\nFriendly NPCs.\nBefore the start of the fight, there are several NPCs (8 in Heroic, 4 in Normal) frozen in iceblocks who can be freed by attacking the iceblocks. When freed, they will help the raid by attacking Hodir, casting spells to help the raid, and providing beneficial buffs. Horde and Alliance raids will see a different set of NPCs according to their faction. If you wish, you can mark the NPC's while frozen by typing /tar and their first name to target them.\nStrategy.\nThis is a single-phase fight that remains the same from beginning to end when Hodir is at 1% health. Making effective use of the friendly NPC buffs can increase raid DPS tremendously, and is necessary to complete the encounter in hard mode, which requires killing Hodir within 3 minutes. Note: Turn on the \"Projected Textures\" option in the game video settings for this fight (as of patch 3.1.1, this option is on by default), as much of the avoidable raid damage requires seeing the glowing white target circles on the ground.\nOnce the encounter begins by pulling the boss or attacking an iceblock, all players must be aware of Hodir's &lt;a href=\"http%3A//wowhead.com/%3Fspell%3D62188\"&gt;Biting Cold&lt;/a&gt; aura. This aura cannot be outranged and will stack a DoT debuff every few seconds whenever a player is not moving. The amount of damage done every tick increases rapidly with every stack of the debuff, so players that accumulate more than a few stacks will likely die. Moving will only remove one stack of the debuff every second, so players who have multiple stacks of the debuff must remain moving for several seconds before the debuff is completely removed.\nThroughout the fight, Hodir will randomly cast &lt;a href=\"Freeze\"&gt;Freeze&lt;/a&gt;, a Frost Nova-type spell centered on a random member of the raid. The targeted player\u2014along with any other players within 10 yards\u2014become rooted for 10 seconds. Dispel this as quickly as possible. &lt;a href=\"Priest\"&gt;Priest&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mass%20Dispel\"&gt;Mass Dispel&lt;/a&gt; works well for this. &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt;s can help free players with &lt;a href=\"Hand%20of%20Freedom\"&gt;Hand of Freedom&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mages\"&gt;Mages&lt;/a&gt; can &lt;a href=\"Blink\"&gt;Blink&lt;/a&gt; to free themselves. &lt;a href=\"Gnome\"&gt;Gnome&lt;/a&gt; characters can also use &lt;a href=\"Escape%20Artist\"&gt;Escape Artist&lt;/a&gt;, so gnome mages have two escapes from this root effect. &lt;a href=\"Human\"&gt;Human&lt;/a&gt;s can use &lt;a href=\"Will%20to%20Survive\"&gt;Will to Survive&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rogue\"&gt;Rogue&lt;/a&gt;s have &lt;a href=\"Cloak%20of%20Shadows\"&gt;Cloak of Shadows&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vanish\"&gt;Vanish&lt;/a&gt;. For &lt;a href=\"Druid\"&gt;Druid&lt;/a&gt;s , the fastest and easiest method (assuming standard stance bar) is simply double-click the form button that you're currently in - it will instantly drop the form and shift back, removing the freeze. The major problem with Freeze is if it prevents players from moving out from under an Icicle, or to safety from Flash Freeze. It may be worth saving one's personal escapes for these situations.\nIcicles will fall from the ceiling onto players randomly during the fight. They are visually cued by snowflakes pouring down before they land and, with projected textures, a white target circle on the ground. Players have a few seconds to move from the area before the Icicle hits the ground, causing significant damage to all players in the area and knocking them back around 30 yards if they are not already rooted by Hodir's Freeze spell.\nPeriodically, Hodir gains a self-buff called Frozen Blows. It reduces the physical damage he does, but in turn buffs frost damage to his attacks (up to 40,000 unresisted). While Hodir has the Frozen Blows buff, he also deals 4,000 frost damage to the whole raid every 2 seconds, so healers will have to be prepared when they hear Hodir roar. If the raid is employing a frost resist tank, he needs to watch for the emote tied to this and \"immediately\" taunt him. Healers also need to be paying attention for the emote to switch targets onto the frost resist tank. When the buff wears off, the original tank must taunt back immediately and the healers must switch back right away again.\nWhen Hodir starts casting Flash Freeze, three large icicles will begin to fall (two on Normal). The areas where these icicles will fall are immediately marked by a mound of snow and a large white targeting circle on the ground. Players should get next to, but \"not\" inside one of these large circles as soon as possible. After several seconds the large icicle will crash into the ground causing tremendous damage to anyone in the circle and knocking them 30 yards away. After the icicle has hit the ground, all players have only a couple seconds to run into the circle where a large icicle has just fallen. Any NPCs or players who are not in one of the large circles will be frozen in an iceblock by the Flash Freeze. Players and NPCs in iceblocks should be freed immediately prior to resuming DPS on Hodir.\nOverall, this fight is mostly a test of endurance. No players should get more than a couple stacks of the Biting Cold debuff. Very few should ever get hit by falling Icicles. And no one should get frozen by Flash Freeze.\nMage NPC abilities.\nThe two mage NPCs provide a number of beneficial buffs to the raid. For this reason, the mages should be released from their ice blocks first at the start of the encounter. Their abilities are:\nBecause the mage NPCs only spawn fires about 5-15 yards around themselves, assigning a caster to each of the mage NPCs ensures that the debuff stays up at all times. Before you start the encounter, manually target and mark Amira Blazeweaver/Missy Flamecuffs and Veesha Blazewaver/Sissy Flamecuffs (using Diamond and Moon is less likely to conflict with any marking addons).\nYour assigned raid casters will be looking out for the fires when they spawn. Once up, they should stand on top of them and start casting to get the debuff rolling (remember, you cannot run though them once he starts casting Flash Freeze). Singed lasts 30 seconds, with a 30% chance to apply. To help with keeping the debuff stacked, the raid must release the mages as fast as possible after each Flash Freeze. Once released, the mage NPCs will help you to release the rest of the NPCs, and your assigned casters get back to their respective DPS target, and refresh Singed.\nQuotes.\nMortals, I am indebted to you for freeing me from the terrible corruption that besets this place. Though I have not yet recovered fully, I can help you battle Yogg-Saron.\nI can grant you and your friends the Fortitude of Frost, increasing your damage and reducing damage taken from enemy attacks. Should one of you be about to fall in battle, I can freeze you in a block of ice, protecting you from all damage for a short time. Know that this ability taxes my power, and I must rest after using it.\nSound files.\nSee \"&lt;a href=\"PlaySoundFile%20macros%20-%20Ulduar%23.C2.A0Hodir\"&gt;Sound Files of Ulduar: Hodir&lt;/a&gt;\"\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

His defeat is the objective of for low-level &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; players.\nWhile Hogger's significance in-game was originally minimal, his relative difficulty at such a low level has caused him to become one of the most well-known and popular minor characters in the game. His role in-game has since been expanded with ' and '.\nAfter his death at the hands of the adventurers in the &lt;a href=\"Stockade\"&gt;Stockade&lt;/a&gt;, the gnoll packs in the kingdom found themselves leaderless, becoming messy and easy for the armies of Stormwind to defeat and repel.\nBiography.\nClassic.\n from the &lt;a href=\"Westbrook%20Garrison\"&gt;Westbrook Garrison&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Elwynn%20Forest\"&gt;Elwynn Forest&lt;/a&gt;, near the border of &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt;, offers a reward for Hogger's death. He is an indirect agent of the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; along with the rest of his &lt;a href=\"Riverpaw%20pack\"&gt;Riverpaw pack&lt;/a&gt;.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nHogger is a \"memory\" in the fight against &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Confessor%20Paletress%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Argent Confessor Paletress&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Trial%20of%20the%20Champion\"&gt;Trial of the Champion&lt;/a&gt; encounter of the &lt;a href=\"Crusaders%27%20Coliseum\"&gt;Crusaders' Coliseum&lt;/a&gt;. This was introduced in patch &lt;a href=\"Patch%203.2.0\"&gt;Patch 3.2.0&lt;/a&gt;, \"Call of the Crusade\".\nCataclysm.\nIn \"\", Hogger as leader of the Riverpaw gnolls now has his own hill named after him, &lt;a href=\"Hogger%20Hill\"&gt;Hogger Hill&lt;/a&gt;, that he is restricted to. Getting him too far from it will cause him to reset. Rather than being killed, after being defeated he is now arrested and taken to the &lt;a href=\"Stockade\"&gt;Stockade&lt;/a&gt; in Stormwind City, where he is later faced again by adventurers and killed.\nFollowing the death of the gnoll, Shaw mentions that the &lt;a href=\"Hogger%27s%20Trousers\"&gt;Hogger's Trousers&lt;/a&gt; are kept in the stockade by guards as a memento that improves the morale of the troops.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; breaks into the Stockade, they find a &lt;a href=\"Hogger%20%22Costume%22\"&gt;Hogger costume&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kazul\"&gt;Kazul&lt;/a&gt;, who was imprisoned for impersonating him at some point.\nStrategy.\nHogger has a reputation as a particularly dangerous foe, primarily because he is one of the first &lt;a href=\"elite\"&gt;elite&lt;/a&gt; mobs a &lt;a href=\"human%20%28playable%29\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; will meet. Thus, new players will sometimes underestimate him, not knowing what the elite tag indicates. In &lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;classic&lt;/a&gt;, this mistake was a recipe for a very quick death.\nIn recent years he has become a bit less of a threat than he originally was; for most classes, he can be soloed relatively easily. Mages and other cloth wearers may still want to group up though, as Hogger can hit fairly hard.\nCulture.\nA \"Hogger &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt;\" is where many level 1 characters (a full 40-man raid back in the day, nowadays usually no more than 25 persons) attempt to kill Hogger by &lt;a href=\"zerg\"&gt;zerg&lt;/a&gt;ing him. Level 1 players can no longer form a raid group.\nHogger is also used as a joke when it comes to where loot drops. Many people will jokingly say that items such as , and are rare drops from Hogger. Keep in mind that Hogger has no extraordinary loot, and these claims are false. Hogger is also often referred to as an extraordinarily difficult mob on par with other raid &lt;a href=\"boss\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt;es, which has no basis in fact and serves only to glorify him. \nIn almost every respect, the cultural icon of Hogger far exceeds that of the actual in-game character. Hogger is often aggrandised in &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.chucknorrisfacts.com\"&gt;jokes traditionally featuring Chuck Norris&lt;/a&gt;. With the introduction of the &lt;a href=\"statistics%20panel\"&gt;statistics&lt;/a&gt; system, the number of times the character has been killed by Hogger is specifically listed in each player's statistics pane, even for Horde characters.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

He is, in fact, the direct chief of the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;, surpassing even &lt;a href=\"Edwin%20VanCleef\"&gt;Edwin VanCleef&lt;/a&gt;.\nHogger has a reputation as a particularly dangerous encounter, primarily because he is one of, if not the only, boss that has wiped a whole 25-man raid in less then 10 seconds.\nStrategy.\nHogger has 1,000,000,000 health on &lt;a href=\"normal\"&gt;normal&lt;/a&gt; difficulty and 100,000,000,000 on &lt;a href=\"heroic\"&gt;heroic&lt;/a&gt; difficulty.\n\"Note: The strategies and tactics described below are for a raid of low level characters. Most could also work with high level characters, as, like all other ?? level mobs, his level is always 3 more than the level of the player he is attacking.\"\nStrategy.\nHogger should be pulled only by the tanking group(s). Once combat is started, healers and DPS will have to be at full mana. The reason for the group of tanks is to switch them off whenever Head Butt hits. If you want, they can continue fighting but the healers will be burning much more mana on him/her. If any adds aggro during the fight, the DPS needs to focus fire and burn them down before going back to Hogger.\nPhase 1.\nHogger will spam Head Butt with no mercy. The raid will likely need to use slowing effects on him, and this phase will burn mana quite quickly. Fortunately, you only need to burn down 10% of his health before phase 2.\nPhase 2.\nAt 90%, Hogger will start Phase 2. He will still use Head Butt, but it seems to be on a 10 second cooldown (not timer). He will use Rushing charge whenever he switches targets, so tanks will not survive very long. The first tank will need to sit down after Head Butt, while tank 2 gets pummeled without Head Butt, and tank 3 gets Head Butt, Tank 4 gets pummeled without it, and by the time he gets to tank 5, tank 1 will probably be up again. Hogger often uses Disintegrate Armor at around 15% health. This Phase lasts until 10%.\nPhase 3.\nHogger will turn into the Lich King, wearing the Helmet of Domination and wielding Frostmourne. He will summon Gnoll zombies that hit for 50-60 damage and have 200 health each, use defile which players must immediately jump out of, and use Pierce Armor on random targets. He will stop using Head Butt and Rushing Charge, so it will be easier on the tank, but likely harder on the group.\nPhase 4.\nPhase 4, Hogger reverts back to his normal form and from there on out it is a pure DPS race, if you do not finish him in under 7 seconds he casts \"Fury of C.Norris\" which kills all players online. If he is beaten then he will scream \"I shall take you all with me!!!\" and explode, killing all player on the server...\nEnrage.\nHogger enrages after 10 seconds of fighting, angry that not everyone is dead yet. He will lose all previous abilities, gain his enrage abilities, gain 1000% armor, and deal twice as much damage. The embodiments aren't very dangerous, that is until too many spawn. Have an offtank pull the embodiments when they spawn and a small group to nuke them down. Their health is extremely low, and can be killed in seconds, but they will spawn at a very fast rate.\nHogger will use Hogger's blast more and more frequently the more time you spend on enrage, until all players are in the air, at which point he will reset. If you get hit with it, you must navigate around trees, caves, mountains, houses, etc. and get back to your raid. Though you will likely die upon landing, dying from impact means that you are far away from the raid group as you traverse all of azeroth when hit with this."}

He ultimately left the Betrayer's service when he decided that Illidan had become the very thing he was sworn to fight, making camp in western &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt; with his &lt;a href=\"nether%20drake\"&gt;nether drake&lt;/a&gt; mount, &lt;a href=\"Nethrandamus\"&gt;Nethrandamus&lt;/a&gt;, and making plans against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; encampments there. &lt;a href=\"Akama\"&gt;Akama&lt;/a&gt; admired Altruis for opposing the direction Illidan was taking. He was eventually captured by the night elf &lt;a href=\"Warden\"&gt;Warden&lt;/a&gt;s, who imprisoned him along with the other demon hunters in the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20the%20Wardens\"&gt;Vault of the Wardens&lt;/a&gt;. Freed during the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; and although reconciled with his &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt; brethren, Altruis still does not condone Illidan's methods and wants new leadership for the Illidari.\nAltruis is one of two characters player demon hunters can choose to be their second-in-command, the other being &lt;a href=\"Kayn%20Sunfury\"&gt;Kayn Sunfury&lt;/a&gt;, whose ideals and plans for the Illidari are incompatible with Altruis' own.\nBiography.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nAltruis the Sufferer was once a member of the &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt; in service to &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, but he defected after he concluded that Illidan had succumbed to the &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; energy within, thereby becoming the very thing Altruis had sworn to destroy. While he still respected Illidan for leading him to the path of a demon hunter, Altruis believed that the Betrayer's mind and soul had become twisted and that his Illidari servants were as much of an abomination as the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; itself. Once, Altruis fought the &lt;a href=\"observer\"&gt;observer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Xeleth\"&gt;Xeleth&lt;/a&gt; and drove a &lt;a href=\"Imbued%20Silver%20Spear\"&gt;silver spear&lt;/a&gt; into him, but the demon nonetheless survived.\nAround the time of the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt;, Altruis arrived in &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt; on his &lt;a href=\"nether%20drake\"&gt;nether drake&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Nethrandamus\"&gt;Nethrandamus&lt;/a&gt; to hunt the Burning Legion. He passed through the towns of &lt;a href=\"Garadar\"&gt;Garadar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Telaar\"&gt;Telaar&lt;/a&gt;, asking their inhabitants to let would-be &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;heroes&lt;/a&gt; in town know that he would be staying in western Nagrand for a while and that they should seek him out if they were looking for a purpose. When an adventurer arrived, Altruis informed them that the Legion were building weapons of mass destruction in the &lt;a href=\"forge%20site\"&gt;forge camps&lt;/a&gt; of western Nagrand, but also that the demons had created wards to prevent the demon hunter from seeing past their defenses. As such, to dismantle the forge camps before the demons were able to finish their constructions, the adventurer would have to act as Altruis' eyes by riding on Nethrandamus and surveying the camps' defenses. From the information gathered by the adventurer, Altruis concluded that there were two primary forge camps\u2014 and \u2014which each contained a Legion transporter, and that nothing done to the camps would have any permanence as long as the transporters stood. He sent the adventurer into the camps to fight the Legion's &lt;a href=\"mo%27arg\"&gt;mo'arg&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"gan%27arg\"&gt;gan'arg&lt;/a&gt; in order to slow down the demons' process and buy him time to devise a plan, after which he tasked the hero with killing the camps' &lt;a href=\"Mo%27arg%20Master%20Planner\"&gt;mo'arg master planner&lt;/a&gt; and obtaining his blueprints. Altruis then sent the adventurer with the blueprints to &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt; in order to seek out one of his acquaintances, a drunken mo'arg named &lt;a href=\"Sal%27salabim\"&gt;Sal'salabim&lt;/a&gt;, and ask him to lend his assistance. Sal'salabim recognized the blueprints as his own designs and, after adventurers helped him collect some old debts, he explained that the adventurer could simply turn the forge camps' &lt;a href=\"fel%20cannon\"&gt;fel cannon&lt;/a&gt;s around and use them on the Legion's own structures. However, to do so, they would also need to obtain keys from the camps' overseers. Returning to Nagrand, the adventurer killed the forge camp overseers &lt;a href=\"Demos%2C%20Overseer%20of%20Hate\"&gt;Demos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Xirkos%2C%20Overseer%20of%20Fear\"&gt;Xirkos&lt;/a&gt; to loot their keys, commandeered the fel cannons, and destroyed the camps. They thereby effectively halted the Legion's advances in Nagrand, and Altruis commended them for their work.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Valley\"&gt;Shadowmoon Valley&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Aldor\"&gt;Aldor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Scryers\"&gt;Scryers&lt;/a&gt; were unsettled to discover &lt;a href=\"Sunfury\"&gt;Sunfury&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; traveling to the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Karabor\"&gt;Ruins of Karabor&lt;/a&gt; to be trained as Illidari demon hunters. Having heard rumors of Altruis in Nagrand, the Aldor and Scryers sent an adventurer to seek out the Sufferer in the hopes that he could shed some light on the demon hunter training grounds. Before he was willing to help, however, Altruis needed proof that the adventurer was on the same side as him. He sent them to kill three targets: the Legion defector &lt;a href=\"Xeleth\"&gt;Xeleth&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Zangarmarsh\"&gt;Zangarmarsh&lt;/a&gt; (to prove that they were an enemy of demons), the elusive &lt;a href=\"shivarra\"&gt;shivarra&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Avatar%20of%20Sathal\"&gt;Sathal&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Netherstorm\"&gt;Netherstorm&lt;/a&gt; (to prove that they were an enemy of the Legion), and Illidan's lieutenant &lt;a href=\"Lothros\"&gt;Lothros&lt;/a&gt; (to prove that they were an enemy of the Illidari). After the adventurer completed the tests, Altruis recounted the story of the Illidari master tutor &lt;a href=\"Varedis%20Felsoul\"&gt;Varedis&lt;/a&gt; and sent the hero to the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Labyrinth\"&gt;Shadow Labyrinth&lt;/a&gt; in order obtain the source of Varedis' power, the &lt;a href=\"%3ABook%20of%20Fel%20Names\"&gt;:Book of Fel Names&lt;/a&gt;, from &lt;a href=\"Blackheart%20the%20Inciter\"&gt;Blackheart the Inciter&lt;/a&gt;. When the book was brought back to him, Altruis felt its power starting to tempt him and urged the adventurer to bring the object back to Shadowmoon Valley and those who had sent them. Before they left, Altruis instructed the hero to burn the book in Varedis' presence in order to deprive him of his power. With the help of Altruis' instructions, the adventurer and their allies assaulted the Ruins of Karabor and killed Varedis and his fellow instructors &lt;a href=\"Alandien\"&gt;Alandien&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Netharel\"&gt;Netharel&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Theras\"&gt;Theras&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nAt some point, Altruis was captured by the &lt;a href=\"warden\"&gt;warden&lt;/a&gt;s and imprisoned in the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20the%20Wardens\"&gt;Vault of the Wardens&lt;/a&gt; alongside his former Illidari brethren and the body of Illidan himself. Years later, when the Burning Legion attacked the Vault during their &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; released the captive Illidari, including Altruis and &lt;a href=\"Kayn%20Sunfury\"&gt;Kayn Sunfury&lt;/a&gt;, a demon hunter utterly loyal to Illidan who resented Altruis for having opposed the Illidari and orchestrating the deaths of Varedis and the other tutors. Altruis, Kayn, and the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Illidari commander&lt;/a&gt; who led the demon hunters in Illidan's absence accompanied Maiev to the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20the%20Betrayer\"&gt;Vault of the Betrayer&lt;/a&gt; but were unable to stop and &lt;a href=\"Cordana%20Felsong\"&gt;Cordana Felsong&lt;/a&gt; from claiming Illidan's body for the Legion. Maiev chased after Gul'dan and Cordana, but not before telling the demon hunters that they had to survive the Vault and seek out &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Archmage Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;. After defeating the two &lt;a href=\"mo%27arg\"&gt;mo'arg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Crusher%20%28mo%27arg%29\"&gt;Crusher&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sledge\"&gt;Sledge&lt;/a&gt; left behind by Gul'dan, Altruis and Kayn moved deeper into the Vault. Altruis protested against trusting Maiev, to which Kayn shot back that Altruis trusted no one and believed in nothing. On a higher level of the Vault, Altruis helped some Illidari defeat the &lt;a href=\"beholder\"&gt;beholder&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Glazer\"&gt;Glazer&lt;/a&gt; before continuing ahead with Kayn. When the two of them reached the &lt;a href=\"Warden%27s%20Court\"&gt;Warden's Court&lt;/a&gt;, their continued arguing escalated into a duel, despite &lt;a href=\"Kor%27vas%20Bloodthorn\"&gt;Kor'vas Bloodthorn&lt;/a&gt;'s protests. They eventually stopped when the Illidari commander caught up with them, and the commander was left to decide whether Altruis or Kayn would serve as their second-in-command and personal champion going forward.\n\"The storyline varies depending on the player's decision during &lt;a href=\"A%20New%20Direction\"&gt;A New Direction&lt;/a&gt;. If they choose Altruis as their second-in-command, Kayn will depart. If they choose Kayn, Altruis will depart and tell the player that they should beware that they don't suffer Illidan's fate. The following describes the storyline for players who choose Altruis. For the Kayn version, see &lt;a href=\"Kayn%20Sunfury\"&gt;Kayn Sunfury&lt;/a&gt;'s article.\"\nAltruis sent &lt;a href=\"Kor%27vas%20Bloodthorn\"&gt;Kor'vas Bloodthorn&lt;/a&gt; to find the demon hunter to report to him immediately at &lt;a href=\"Krasus%27%20Landing\"&gt;Krasus' Landing&lt;/a&gt;. To find the &lt;a href=\"Twinblades%20of%20the%20Deceiver\"&gt;Twinblades of the Deceiver&lt;/a&gt;, he and the demon hunter went to the entrance of the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Hold\"&gt;Violet Hold&lt;/a&gt; guarded by &lt;a href=\"Warden%20Alturas\"&gt;Warden Alturas&lt;/a&gt; whose task was to not permit anyone to enter the prison. By Khadgar's trust, the Warden had no choice but to let them in. He told them that the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; would not be responsible for any sacrifices taken. Altruis stood guard to let the demon hunter confront an eredar named &lt;a href=\"Taldath%20the%20Destroyer\"&gt;Taldath the Destroyer&lt;/a&gt; to get answers of where &lt;a href=\"Varedis%20Felsoul\"&gt;Varedis Felsoul&lt;/a&gt; was. Eventually, the demon spilled out the information without warning, and Altruis told the demon hunter to finish him off. Learning that &lt;a href=\"Felsoul%20Hold\"&gt;Felsoul Hold&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt; is where he and the artifact were at, Altruis got a bat ready for the demon hunter. &lt;a href=\"Lyana%20Darksorrow\"&gt;Lyana Darksorrow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Illysanna%20Ravencrest\"&gt;Illysanna Ravencrest&lt;/a&gt; were to accompany the demon hunter regardless of the outcome. Altruis warned the demon hunter that Varedis was a cunning adversary. Upon arriving at Felsoul Hold, the demons spotted the bats and Altruis told them to fly to a landing site quickly. Losing both Darksorrow and Ravencrest, the demon hunter leaped into the fray and punish them for their hubris.\nAltruis sent Kor'vas Bloodthorn to find the demon hunter to report to him immediately at &lt;a href=\"Krasus%27%20Landing\"&gt;Krasus' Landing&lt;/a&gt;. To find the &lt;a href=\"Aldrachi%20Warblades\"&gt;Aldrachi Warblades&lt;/a&gt;, he said that &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Khadgar\"&gt;Archmage Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; had something called a &lt;a href=\"Crystallized%20Soul\"&gt;Crystallized Soul&lt;/a&gt;. He stressed that the Warblades could tip &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;the war&lt;/a&gt; in their favor.\nUpon returning to the prison world of &lt;a href=\"Mardum%2C%20the%20Shattered%20Abyss\"&gt;Mardum&lt;/a&gt; to make it their new home, Altruis addresses to the Illidari of the accomplishments of the demon hunter by obtaining the artifact. With the \"&lt;a href=\"Fel%20Hammer\"&gt;Fel Hammer&lt;/a&gt;\" in their control, they can plan out every aspect of their assault on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;.\nAltruis was met by the adventurer and Khadgar at &lt;a href=\"Illidari%20Stand\"&gt;Illidari Stand&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Azsuna\"&gt;Azsuna&lt;/a&gt;. Surprised and really impressed of the artifact the champion wielded, he told them to assist Allari and Jace as best they can to maintain ground against the demons there. He instructed the champion, &lt;a href=\"Cyana%20Nightglaive\"&gt;Cyana Nightglaive&lt;/a&gt;, and Kor'vas Bloodthorn to attack from within the legion camp ahead. Unfortunately, Cyana betrayed them to Legion and the Illidari were swift to put her down. Her death was a blow for the Illidari cannot afford to lose even a single demon hunter in their ranks. Under Khadgar's direction, Altruis directed the adventurer to meet up with the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragon\"&gt;blue dragon&lt;/a&gt;s that live &lt;a href=\"Azurewing%20Repose\"&gt;nearby&lt;/a&gt; citing they can be proven to be a powerful ally in the war against the Burning Legion.\nAltruis was the first to become the champion's cause in their campaign. After collecting essences to communicate with their master, it was time to seek out other allies. Seeking the aid of &lt;a href=\"Akama\"&gt;Akama&lt;/a&gt; the Illidari sneak into the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt;. Though initially hostile to the Illidari Akama is convinced to rejoin the fold as he had admired Altruis for opposing Illidan. The \"Fel Hammer\" then jumped to the Legion world of &lt;a href=\"Niskara\"&gt;Niskara&lt;/a&gt; to take out the &lt;a href=\"Caria%20Felsoul\"&gt;Fel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"Varedis%20Felsoul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt; siblings. With their mission successful, he gave one of the highest honors to the demon hunter and declared them the Slayer and told them that their artifact can awake great potential when the time came.\nAltruis participated in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Exodar\"&gt;Battle for the Exodar&lt;/a&gt; battling against &lt;a href=\"High%20General%20Rakeesh\"&gt;High General Rakeesh&lt;/a&gt;, alongside &lt;a href=\"Asha%20Ravensong\"&gt;Asha Ravensong&lt;/a&gt;.\nAltruis and Kayn were both aboard the \"&lt;a href=\"Fel%20Hammer\"&gt;Fel Hammer&lt;/a&gt;\" when the Slayer obtained the &lt;a href=\"Slayer%27s%20Felbroken%20Shrieker\"&gt;Slayer's Felbroken Shrieker&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuotes.\nLegion.\nGossip.\nWe are indomitable.

{"id": "493231", "revid": "39299307", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=493231", "title": "Aluneth (entity)", "text": "Aluneth is a strange, fickle and powerful entity of pure &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; energy hailing from another &lt;a href=\"plane\"&gt;plane&lt;/a&gt; of existence. It was eventually defeated by the &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt; and bound to &lt;a href=\"Aluneth\"&gt;an enchanted greatstaff&lt;/a&gt; that would come to bear its name, where it remains to this day.\nBiography.\nThe first creatures on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; to discover Aluneth were the wise &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;. While manipulating the fabric of reality, they tapped into another realm of existence and made contact with the strange arcane entity. Intrigued by the being's existence, the dragons summoned Aluneth into their stronghold, the &lt;a href=\"Nexus\"&gt;Nexus&lt;/a&gt;, for further study. The entity immediately went on a rampage, destroying countless tomes and artifacts before it was contained by the dragons, who, rather than being angry, were delighted by the creature's capricious nature. After years of conducting harmless experiments on Aluneth to sate their curiosity, the dragons sent the creature back to its home realm.\nYears later, a &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; sorcerer named &lt;a href=\"Meitre\"&gt;Meitre&lt;/a&gt; came into contact with an unknown blue dragon, from whom he learned of the existence of Aluneth and the plane where it dwelled. Though he never found a way to enslave Aluneth, Meitre found a way to draw power from the entity to enhance his own spells. During the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, Meitre mastered his connection to the being, and on one occasion used this power to mass teleport himself and a group of &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; resistance forces to safety away from an overwhelming force of &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAfter the War of the Ancients, the night elves outlawed the use of arcane magic, as they believed that continuing to wield it would only lead to another disaster. Meitre refused, quailing at the thought of losing his connection to Aluneth, and retreated from society to become a recluse. He left behind many scrolls that would continue to be used in the study of magic for millennia, but the existence of Aluneth was forgotten by all until the time of the &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt;. Realizing that Meitre had wielded more power than any regular sorcerer should have been capable of, Aegwynn discovered a series of lost scrolls by Meitre which detailed both Aluneth and the spells used to tap into the being's power.\nResolving to bind Aluneth to her will to use it as a weapon against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, Aegwynn summoned the entity to Azeroth with ease, but it refused to obey her commands. It thrashed against her containment magics and nullified her spellwork, but the Guardian reveled in the challenge. After many setbacks, she finally succeeded in binding the entity to an enchanted greatstaff that would come to bear the creature's name: &lt;a href=\"Aluneth\"&gt;Aluneth&lt;/a&gt;. However, it would take several more years before the Guardian was able to truly harness its power.\nDuring her battle against the &lt;a href=\"Avatar%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;avatar&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, Aegwynn called upon Aluneth to assist her, but as the being refused her commands she was forced to instead summon another greatstaff, &lt;a href=\"Atiesh%2C%20Greatstaff%20of%20the%20Guardian\"&gt;Atiesh&lt;/a&gt;, to aid her in battle. Even though she defeated the avatar, a portion of its spirit had been transferred into Aegwynn's soul, darkening her thoughts and driving her to distance herself from her allies, the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Council of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt;. Aegwynn resolved to create a hidden refuge in the form of a great tower, using Aluneth to warp reality around her until the tower known henceforth as &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt; rose from the earth.\nAegwynn eventually gave birth to a son, &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;, who became possessed from birth as Sargeras' spirit passed from the mother into the child. Years later, Medivh allowed the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;orcish Horde&lt;/a&gt; entry into Azeroth, forcing Aegwynn to confront him. Despite the aid of Aluneth, Aegwynn was unable to best her son and only narrowly escaped with her life. Medivh was later vanquished, but that brought Aegwynn little solace, and she eventually retreated into exile, entrusting Aluneth \u2014 and the entity within \u2014 to the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;. To prevent anyone from abusing Aluneth's power, the Kirin Tor locked the staff away in the &lt;a href=\"Nexus%20Vault\"&gt;Nexus Vault&lt;/a&gt;, where it would remain for years under the protection of the blue dragons.\nLegion.\nDuring the Burning Legion's &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt; of Azeroth, &lt;a href=\"Mage%23Arcane\"&gt;arcane mage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s journey to the Nexus in search of Aegwynn's greatstaff. With the help of &lt;a href=\"Azuregos\"&gt;Azuregos&lt;/a&gt;, they defeat the sinister &lt;a href=\"Ethereum\"&gt;Ethereum&lt;/a&gt; forces in the area that are seeking to \"become &lt;a href=\"void\"&gt;void&lt;/a&gt;\" before venturing alone into the Nexus Vault. While Aluneth begins to whisper to them, the adventurer uses the same ancient scrolls of Meitre that Aegwynn once used to subdue the entity and nullify its magics. While Aluneth considers the adventurer little more than a child that's unworthy to wield its power, the entity agrees to let itself be claimed by the mage in order to see what they are made of.\nAluneth continues to communicate with the adventurer during their adventures in the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;, frequently urging them to turn on their allies and unleash the full power they have at their command.\nWhen an image of Aegwynn appears within the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Eternal%20Night\"&gt;Cathedral of Eternal Night&lt;/a&gt;, Aluneth initially responds with fear, declaring that she will not bind it again. But upon realizing that it is only an echo, Aluneth assures the Archmage that it is nothing to be concerned about."}

As a reward, she was purified with fire and reborn as a fearsome &lt;a href=\"fire%20hawk\"&gt;fire hawk&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nAbilities.\nStage One: I Will Burn You From the Sky!\nAlysrazor flies around the arena, allowing her minions to corner her foes far below. She periodically flies through the center of the arena to claw at foes.\nStage Two: The Skies are Mine!\nAlysrazor flies in a tight circle, removes Wings of Flame from all players after 5 seconds, and then begins her ultimate attack.\nStage Three: Burnout!\nAlysrazor crashes to the ground with 0 Molten Power and becomes vulnerable. This stage lasts until Alyrazor's energy bar reaches 50 Molten Power.\nStage Four: Reborn in Flame!\nAlysrazor's fire reignites at 50 Molten Power. This stage lasts until Alysrazor reaches 100 Molten Power.\nStrategy.\nThe Encounter Has a 15 Min Hard Enrage.\nInitial Pull.\nThe first pull of the night will require a player to get Fandral's attention. Fandral will then pull all players to the area in front of him and stun them with Smoldering Rootsthem while he monologues.\nWhen Alysrazor spawns she will cast Firestorm (30K damage plus a knockback, followed by a 10k per second AoE). The raid should move out of the strafing path, then group up for AoE heals.\nSecond and later pulls are triggered by touching the single feather at northeast end of the battlefield. Players will not be relocated by Fandral this time, so before touching the feathers, players should group up near the \"front\" of the battlefield (toward the flame cavern containing Alysrazor) but outside of the strafing path (southeast is traditional). If you are too close to the \"back\" of the battlefield, Firestorm will knock you into the Volcanic Fire and you will probably die. After the knockback, stay grouped up for AoE heals.\nPhase 1.\nAlysrazor will fly along the strafing path while casting Blazing Claw. Don't get clawed. This strafing run will be repeated a few times during phase 1, so if you must enter the strafing lane (to collect feathers or switch sides) do not tarry.\nIn her wake Molten Feathers will be dropped. Each healer should grab one for the speed buff and the ability to cast while moving. The flyboy(s) (good classes for this role are Fire Mages, Spriests, Aff locks and Fury warriors) should grab 3 feathers to gain Wings of Flame. Any remaining feathers may be picked up by the raid (casters and hunters prefered for the cast-while-moving benefit). \nWith Wings of Flame you are able to fly around and blast Alysrazor without having to worry about worms and hatchlings. However you do need to avoid cloud of flames that she releases along with the flame rings. While in the air fly through the flame rings to extend your air time indefinitely and gain a large stacking haste buff (stacks to 25, or 200% haste). If you lose the wings, grab another feather to regain them. At 24 stacks, you will gain Alysra's Razor, increasing your critical strike chance significantly. If you grab every single ring she spawns, you will be able to hit 24 stacks during the second ground strafe, leaving an entire air phase with the maximum haste and crit buffs. Both buffs last 40 seconds and are refreshed upon running through a ring. These rings will continue to spawn during phase 2, and if you succeed at hitting a couple during that phase, both buffs can be extended into and completely through phase 3.\nDPS and interruptors' first priority is the Blazing Talon Initiate. Brushfire can not be interrupted. Fieroblast \"must\" be interrupted. A missed interrupt gives the initiate a buff that speeds up later casts, making it eventually impossible to interrupt every fieroblast. The sooner you can kill the initiate, the sooner you can plink at the\nhatchlings. Be on the look-out for replacement initiates that spawn throughout the fight.\nTanks have to pick up the Voracious Hatchlings. The player standing closest to each hatchling will be Imprinted and aggro is permanent until that player dies. Only the tank should be close enough to become Imprinted. Imprinted also gives the tank +1000% damage. Tanks are expected to do the majority of the damage against the hatchlings.\nHatchlings start out Satiated, but rather quickly convert to Hungry. While Hungry every time they land a blow there's a 20% chance to convert to Tantrum. When the hatchling throws a tantrum the tank should quickly kite it (strafing is preferable to backpedaling) into a Plump Lava Worm. Try not to walk through the Lava Spew. This is also a good time to pick up two Molten Feathers to get the speed buff. Don't pick up 3, or you will be launched into the air (and risk having the hatchling imprint on another player).\nWorms spawn shortly after the Hatchlings emerge from their eggs. There is an initial wave of four and after a set period of time, another four spawn. Tanks should memorize the spawn points of the worms so that they do not spawn under a hatchling (and \"waste\" a tantrum suppression opportunity). The worms can be divided between the two tanks using the strafing path as the dividing line (although the second wave of worms has ones very close to the strafing path that can cause confusion over dibs for tanks-in-training). Each tank can expect to have the use of four worms during phase 1, although the chaos of battle can mess this up.\nIt is not unusual to suffer a tantrum while there are no worms available. Tanks should have a major cooldown available to lighten the load on the healers in this event.\nConversely, it is possible to get lucky and have spare worms near the end of phase 1. If there are still worms up 15 seconds before the beginning of phase 2, use the hatchling to kill the worms so they are not casting Lava Spew during phase 2.\nTanks who are in below-average gear may find it challenging to kill the voracious hatchling before phase 2 starts. If DPS is able to quickly kill the Blazing Talon Initiate, they can assist by blasting the hatchling until the next Initiate lands.\nHealers and DPS, be aware that the hatchlings periodically cleave a Gushing Wound. Try not to be in the 60 degree cone. Healers, understand that a player afflicted by this will bleed until they reach half health, or until 60 seconds pass. Trying to top off a player afflicted by this DoT is probably a waste of mana. Wait until they bleed down to 50% health and \"then\" heal them.\nDo not let a worm spin its Lava Spew onto you. It causes 40K damage per second.\nPhase 2.\nHatchlings and worms should be dead at the beginning of phase 2. A skilled tank can dodge tornadoes and tank the hatchling, but it is rather difficult and healers are too busy dodging tornadoes to cast more heals.\nPhase 2 is a brutal frogger minigame. The center of the arena and the outer edge of the arena are death zones because of the Harsh Winds AoE. In between there is a zone of less death filled with orbiting Fiery Tornados. \nExperienced players will perceive that there are well-defined circular concentric lanes. Each lane is populated by tornadoes moving in the same direction at the same speed. Adjacent lanes have tornadoes moving in the opposite direction. Tornadoes move faster than players can run (the only exception being those with 3 feathers in the interior 2-3 lanes), so players must change lanes to avoid damage.\nThe simplest tactic is to chase a tornado in a single lane until a tornado passes you going in the opposite direction. Immediately change lanes and change directions to pursue the opposing tornado. If you were to stay in the same lane too long, a tornado would overtake you, but by changing lanes you are able to avoid this. It is possible to allow two tornadoes to pass in the adjacent lane and then change lanes while still avoiding being steamrolled by the pursuing tornado.\nFlyboys should attempt to pass through at least 1-2 flame rings during this phase. If done properly, the haste and crit buffs from phase 1 can be extended through the end of the phase 3 dps burn.\nPhase 3.\nAlysrazor falls to the center of the arena, exhausted. This phase lasts a maximum of 33 seconds, but usually lasts closer to 20. All DPS and healers should begin blasting Alysrazor to take advantage of Essence of the Green (and the bonus damage of phase 3). Group up before phase 4 starts for AoE healing and to avoid taking a cleave.\nThe two tanks must move to their assigned sides and interrupt the Ignition cast by Blazing Talon Clawshapers. Interrupting Ignition delays Alysrazor's revival. The cast interval on Ignition is such that pure interrupts aren't enough. The tanks should first use an interrupt, then a stun, then another interrupt. The fourth ignition is of no consequence because even with good interrupts Alysrazor will be reignited by her own Spark. After the third interrupt a tank should move into position to tank phase 4.\nPhase 4.\nWhen Alysrazor reaches 50 energy she reactivates. A tank should taunt and immediately build threat. As with Beth'tilac, the raid and tanks should be positioned in a triangle around Alysrazor, to avoid tanks sharing the cleave and debuff. Alysrazor will perform Blazing Claw, a cleave that stacks a debuff on the tank. All DPS should already be grouped up behind Alysrazor. The second tank should take care not to be in the cone of Blazing Claw, and should taunt off the first tank to mitigate the debuff's effects. Healers should be able to keep a single tank alive through 11 or 12 stacks of Blazing Claw if necessary (and tanks using a minor cooldown to reduce the damage helps), so single-tanking this phase is an option. Once Alysrazor reaches 100 energy she will knock everyone back, drop feathers under herself, and take to the air and return to Phase 1.\nIf the raid ends up taking Alysrazor to a third Phase 4, she will fail to fully re-ignite and continue spamming Blazing Buffet and Blazing Claw until either she or the raid die.\nAfterword.\nIf the flyboy has learned how to DPS and stay flying, and the raid is able to focus during phase 3, a properly geared raid can expect to kill Alysrazor in the air during either phase 3 of the second cycle or phase 1 of the third cycle. Undergeared raids who can compensate with skill will take longer, usually killing her during phase 3 of the third cycle. The fight does have one soft-enrage mechanic (the failed full re-ignition in the third Phase 4),coupled with the 15 min Hard Enrage. This fight is mostly about control and survival. If you have people dying, you need more power or more practice.\nSolo strategy.\nMelee players should save CDs for phase three, while ranged players should use it on the pull. This fight is annoying for non-ranged players, as the encounter tends to reset if the only player is flying to attack her in melee range. Run over two Molten Feathers after Alysrazor drops them to gain the cast-while-moving benefit, though. If possible, put most of the DPS on her, but don't let adds stay up long. Stay out of the fires.\nIn phase two, get out of the center and the outer edge of the arena while dodging tornadoes, as their damage will start to add up. Try to run through the rings on the ground to gain the stacking crit/haste buffs.\nIn phase three, pop all CDs and blow her up. Try to interrupt the Blazing Talon Clawshapers' ignition, as that will end the phase sooner.\nRemember that she will enrage after 15 minutes (after the third phase three cycle), so try to finish her off before then.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

{"id": "16734", "revid": "39299307", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=16734", "title": "Aman'Thul", "text": "Aman'Thul (or Aman'thul), the Highfather, is the leader of the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;. He is the oldest and wisest of his kind. The titan who originally blessed &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"bronze%20dragonflight\"&gt;bronze dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, Aman'Thul has mastery over temporal magic. Having led the Pantheon during the ordering of the universe, he and his brothers were felled by &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, their souls held captive by the Dark Titan until they were freed by the heroes of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Aman'Thul and the Pantheon subsequently helped the heroes defeat &lt;a href=\"Argus%20the%20Unmaker\"&gt;Argus the Unmaker&lt;/a&gt; and used the last of his essence to imprison Sargeras within the &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20the%20Pantheon\"&gt;Seat of the Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;, apparently crippling the Legion and ending the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt; forever.\nBiography.\nAccording to legend, Aman'Thul was the first &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; to wake from his slumber, although no one knew how or why the first titan woke. He was alone in the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;Great Dark&lt;/a&gt;, but knew in his heart that other titans must exist, and so set out to explore the myriad worlds of the universe in search of others of his kind. Over time, he discovered other nascent &lt;a href=\"world-soul\"&gt;world-soul&lt;/a&gt;s and lovingly nurtured them until they awoke and joined him in his travels. Eventually, Aman'Thul and his siblings became known as the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;, and in the early ages of the universe they ordered and reshaped countless worlds in hopes of finding other titans. In order to aid the Pantheon, Aman'Thul called upon the celestial beings known as the &lt;a href=\"constellar\"&gt;constellar&lt;/a&gt; to observe and watch over the many worlds ordered by the titans.\nDuring the ordering of the world of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, home to a particularly powerful world-soul, the titans crafted the &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt; in order to battle the monstrous &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s that had infested the world. Though the titan-forged were largely victorious against the forces of the Old Gods, the Pantheon grew concerned that &lt;a href=\"Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;Y'Shaarj&lt;/a&gt;, the most powerful of the Old Gods, would prove too mighty for their servants to defeat. Despite the titans' colossal size posing the risk of inflicting permanent harm to Azeroth, Aman'Thul himself reached down through the stormy skies and heaved Y'Shaarj from the crust of the world, tearing the Old God apart. Before leaving Azeroth in the care of the titan-forged, Aman'Thul commissioned the constellar &lt;a href=\"Algalon%20the%20Observer\"&gt;Algalon&lt;/a&gt; to watch over the planet. After the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Galakrond\"&gt;Galakrond&lt;/a&gt;, Aman'Thul used &lt;a href=\"Highkeeper%20Ra\"&gt;Highkeeper Ra&lt;/a&gt; as a conduit to channel a portion of his power into &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt;, granting him mastery over time, and enabling him to hold \"dominion over the interweaving pathways of fate and destiny\". Aman'Thul's vision of the Old Gods one day causing the &lt;a href=\"Hour%20of%20Twilight\"&gt;Hour of Twilight&lt;/a&gt;, capable of potentially wiping out all life on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, was one of the reasons the Pantheon empowered Nozdormu and the other Aspects with their powers, to ultimately avert this single catastrophe, although Aman'Thul for all his vast powers was not omniscient and was unaware &lt;a href=\"Neltharion\"&gt;Neltharion&lt;/a&gt; would eventually be corrupted into &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the Pantheon confronted the traitorous titan champion &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; near the world of &lt;a href=\"Nihilam\"&gt;Nihilam&lt;/a&gt;, Aman'Thul pleaded with Sargeras in an attempt to make him abandon his mad &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;. The Highfather told the fallen titan about the world-soul of Azeroth, and how it would have the potential to stop the &lt;a href=\"void%20lord\"&gt;void lord&lt;/a&gt;s without the need to purge the universe of life. Sargeras listened carefully but was unmoved.\nLike the rest of the Pantheon, Aman'Thul could not stand against Sargeras' &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; power, and was ultimately destroyed. Like the others, however, Aman'Thul's soul was saved by a spell cast by &lt;a href=\"Norgannon\"&gt;Norgannon&lt;/a&gt;, and the now disembodied spirits of the Pantheon hurled out through the cosmos until they reached Azeroth and slammed into the titan-forged &lt;a href=\"keeper\"&gt;keeper&lt;/a&gt;s assigned to watch over the planet. Aman'Thul's spirit entered the body of &lt;a href=\"Ra\"&gt;Ra&lt;/a&gt;, his greatest servant, who was the only keeper to realize that the brief influx of power felt by the titan-forged was not a mere anomaly, but the very last remnant of the Pantheon's power. Carefully, Ra extracted Aman'Thul's soul fragment and stored it in a mountain vault near the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt;. There it remained until many years later, its power was absorbed by the &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; warlord &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen\"&gt;Lei Shen&lt;/a&gt;, who used it to establish the &lt;a href=\"mogu%20empire\"&gt;mogu empire&lt;/a&gt;.\nSargeras would eventually capture the spirits of the Pantheon, except for Eonar who escaped. Aggramar succumbed to Sargeras's torture and was revived as an &lt;a href=\"avatar\"&gt;avatar&lt;/a&gt; on the planet &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt; to serve the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Aman'Thul, Khaz'goroth, Norgannon, and Golganneth were tortured by the &lt;a href=\"Coven%20of%20Shivarra\"&gt;Coven of Shivarra&lt;/a&gt; with the goal of breaking them as Aggramar was.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Eonar\"&gt;Eonar&lt;/a&gt; is saved and &lt;a href=\"Aggramar\"&gt;Aggramar&lt;/a&gt; is liberated, the Pantheon is reunited, returning to their &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20the%20Pantheon\"&gt;Seat of the Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;, where they attempted to sever &lt;a href=\"Argus%20the%20Unmaker\"&gt;Argus the Unmaker&lt;/a&gt;'s connection with the Legion once and for all. Aman'Thul called upon his brethren to assist the Alliance and Horde champions during the encounter, and directly intervened by attempting to dissipate &lt;a href=\"Argus%20the%20Unmaker\"&gt;Argus the Unmaker&lt;/a&gt;'s weakened physical form with a massive Temporal Blast, collapsing time around him, but his powers were unable to truly subdue him. After Argus was eventually defeated, Sargeras strikes out at Azeroth and severely wounded her in &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;. The Pantheon subsequently combined the last of Argus's essence with their powers and imprisoned their fallen brother within the Seat of the Pantheon, decisively crippling the Legion and apparently ending the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt; forever. &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, who stayed behind while his comrades left, serves as Sargeras's jailer.\nIn the RPG.\nAman'Thul is a male &lt;a href=\"Aesir\"&gt;Aesir&lt;/a&gt; titan. His classes are &lt;a href=\"Healer\"&gt;Healer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Druid%20of%20the%20Wild\"&gt;Druid of the Wild&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shaman\"&gt;Shaman&lt;/a&gt;. He wields a staff named &lt;a href=\"Orodur\"&gt;Orodur&lt;/a&gt;.\nAman'Thul rules the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 the titan high council. He is the oldest and wisest of his ancient race. Once, Aman'Thul and his brother &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; oversaw the creation of innumerable worlds across the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; and gently guided countless races to greatness. Sargeras was Aman'Thul's closest advisor and supporter until he turned to evil. Now Aman'Thul looks to his consort &lt;a href=\"Eonar\"&gt;Eonar&lt;/a&gt; for council. Though the mysterious High Father is rarely seen, every world feels his presence.\nAs leader of the titans, Aman'Thul is responsible for the creation of all worlds, including &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. All those who revere the titans ultimately pay their respects to the High Father. On Azeroth, explorers have only recently uncovered the titans' existence, and few aside from the &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20dwarf\"&gt;Ironforge dwarves&lt;/a&gt; venerate them. Dwarves, being a practical lot, show their respect for the titans by delving ever deeper into their mysteries.\nSpeculation.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen\"&gt;Lei Shen&lt;/a&gt; ate &lt;a href=\"Ra\"&gt;Keeper Ra&lt;/a&gt;'s heart, he absorbed both his powers and the soul fragment of Aman'Thul. When &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt; ate Lei Shen's heart, he saw countless perfectly ordered planets and millions of stars. This corresponds to the vision the Keepers had when the Pantheon members tried to inhabit their bodies, suggesting Wrathion absorbed the Highfather's soul fragment just as Lei Shen did. This is reinforced by Wrathion saying upon absorbing the Keeper's power, which was likely a memory of Aman'Thul speaking of the Pantheon's fate and &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s status.\nInspiration.\nAman'Thul was likely inspired by the Greek god and the Norse god .\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

The scout cannot be sapped or sheeped.\nEvery minute or two a new scout will spawn and begin its preset patrol. Keep an eye out behind you as you steadily move forward through Jan'Alai's trash as scouts will continue to spawn behind the group and may aggro if the raid group is not continually moving forward. We assign a druid and rogue to keep a lookout behind the raid so any unexpected scout can be quickly rooted and stunlocked down before he can summon two more adds.\nIf the group is currently engaged with the packs of elites (usually a caster, two guardians and a scout) additional adds can make a pull very stressful and potentially wipe and unexpecting group.\nQuotes.\n\"Amani'shi Scout Yells: Invaders!

Separate the mobs quickly and you will have no problem. \nUnlike the bear mobs before them the enrage is not dispellable with hunters tranquilizing shot. It does not last long enough to make much of a difference UNLESS the tank has the stacked Furious Roars.\nOnce the Warbringer does separate the Troll has somewhere around 16-20% health and the bear has 80-85%. We found it easy enough to sleep the bear, kill the troll, then kill the bear then move on to the next one and repeat.\nThey come with a pack of four before the bear boss. Crowd control the two adds on the sides (they're susceptible to Polymorph and and Freezing Trap) and split them apart. They enrage and kick the crap out of the tank. We had 3 healers, 1 for each tank and a clean up. When the Warbringer enrages all 3 healers need to be on that tank (HoTs should keep the other tank as long as his Warbringer doesn't enrage), hopefully they don't enrage at the same time. I think we managed to keep them both up during an enrage by the skin of our teeth. When the Warbringer gets to a certain health amount, he dismounts, kill the troll and the tank needs to pick up the bear quickly. Saving a Thunder Clap for when the Warbringer hits 25% should do the trick. Healers really have to keep the tank topped off for a couple seconds here because you're taking double damage until the troll goes down."}

{"id": "16870", "revid": "27079649", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=16870", "title": "Amani Empire", "text": "The Amani Empire is a &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;forest troll&lt;/a&gt; empire that had incredible power in antiquity. It took its name from the strongest tribe of forest trolls and the founders of the empire in that time, the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt;. Their empire was crushed in the &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Wars\"&gt;Troll Wars&lt;/a&gt;, thought to never be able to rise again. Although a shadow of its former self, the empire still endures.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nThe Amani were one the troll tribes that arose to challenge the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; for territory and power.\nWhen a group of trolls awakened &lt;a href=\"Kith%27ix\"&gt;Kith'ix&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"C%27Thrax\"&gt;C'Thrax&lt;/a&gt; viewed the troll nations with contempt and thus sought to destroy them with the &lt;a href=\"aqir\"&gt;aqir&lt;/a&gt;. At the onset of the &lt;a href=\"Aqir%20and%20Troll%20War\"&gt;Aqir and Troll War&lt;/a&gt; numerous smaller tribes fell before the aqir. The Amani were one of the many troll tribes to join the &lt;a href=\"Empire%20of%20Zul\"&gt;Empire of Zul&lt;/a&gt;, in which the Zandalari took on the role of commanding the troll armies. The Empire of Zul forced the aqir to retreat and Kith'ix would be gravely wounded by the trolls and their loa allies.\nSeeking to permanently end the aqir threat, the Zandalari knew that no corner of the continent could be left unguarded, and so the Zandalari convinced the most power-hungry of the troll factions to establish new and permanent strongholds across Kalimdor. At the forefront of these groups were the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20tribe\"&gt;Gurubashi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Drakkari%20tribe\"&gt;Drakkari tribe&lt;/a&gt;s. After they had fully vanquished the aqir in their new regions, they could lay uncontested claim to the untouched fertile lands that they now lived in. The ambitious tribes listened to the Zandalari and readily agreed. \nThe Amani tribe had set out to the northeast, their goal to hunt down and destroy the aqir leader, Kith'ix. They tracked the C'Thrax's trail deep into the continent's northeastern woodlands, encountering increasingly fierce resistance the closer they came. After cutting through legions of aqir, the Amani finally reached the insectoid general itself. In a savage and legendary battle, virtually the entire tribe threw itself at Kith'ix and his remaining forces in a suicidal assault. The C'Thrax, though wounded from the war's previous conflicts, personally slaughtered countless trolls. Only a minute fraction of the tribe survived the terrible engagement, yet Kith'ix eventually succumbed to its tireless hunters. Though it had cost the tribe dearly, the reputation of the Amani became legendary among all the troll tribes for their heroic act. Atop the site where they had slain the C'Thrax, the Amani established a new settlement. In time, it would develop into the impressive temple city of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt; and with it, the Amani Empire was born.\nArrival of the high elves.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"high%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Dath%27Remar%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Dath'Remar Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; were first exiled and landed in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, they met violent clashes with the forest trolls, who viewed them as defiling their homeland. At the time of the founding of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, the Amani Empire was the most powerful empire in the Eastern Kingdoms; they still held much of northern Lordaeron in their territorial grasp. \nAs the forces of Zul'Aman fought to keep these unwanted strangers from their lands, the high elves developed a deep loathing for the vicious trolls and killed them on sight whenever they were encountered. In time the high elves founded the &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; and vowed to create a mighty empire which would dwarf that of their Kaldorei cousins. Unfortunately, they soon learned that Quel'Thalas was founded upon an ancient troll city that the trolls still held to be sacred. Almost immediately, the trolls began to attack the elven settlements en masse.\nThe stubborn elves, unwilling to give up their new land, utilized the magics which they had gleaned from the Well of Eternity and kept the savage trolls at bay. Under Dath'Remar's leadership, they were able to defeat the Amani warbands that outnumbered them ten to one. Some elves, wary of the Kaldorei's ancient warnings, felt that their use of magic might possibly draw the attention of the banished Burning Legion. Therefore, they decided to mask their lands within a protective barrier which would still allow them to work their enchantments. They constructed a series of monolithic &lt;a href=\"runestone\"&gt;runestone&lt;/a&gt;s at various points around Quel'Thalas which marked the boundaries of the magic barrier. The Runestones not only masked the elves' magic from extra-dimensional threats but helped to frighten away the superstitious troll warbands as well.\nAs time wore on, Quel'Thalas flourished into a shining amount of the high elves' efforts and magical prowess and for nearly four thousand years the high elves lived peacefully within the secluded safety of their kingdom. Nevertheless, the vindictive trolls of Zul'Aman were not so easily defeated. They plotted and schemed in the depths of the forests and waited for the numbers of their warbands to grow. Finally, a mighty troll army charged out from the shadowy forests and once again laid siege to the shining spires of Quel'Thalas.\nThe Troll Wars.\nAs the high elves led by High King &lt;a href=\"Anasterian%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Anasterian Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; fought for their lives against the trolls' fierce onslaught, the scattered, nomadic &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; fought to consolidate their own tribal lands. The &lt;a href=\"tribe\"&gt;tribe&lt;/a&gt;s of early humanity raided each other's settlements with little heed for racial unification or honor. Yet one tribe, known as the &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20tribe\"&gt;Arathi&lt;/a&gt;, saw that the trolls were becoming too great a threat to ignore. The Arathi wished to bring all of the tribes under its rule so that they could provide a unified front against the troll warbands.\nEven as the Arathi outmaneuvered, outfought rival tribes, and offered peace and equality to those they conquered; thus winning the loyalty of those they had beaten, the Forest Trolls of Zul'Aman were proving to be very successful against the high elves of Quel'Thalas. In desperation weary ambassadors from Quel'Thalas journeyed to &lt;a href=\"Strom\"&gt;Strom&lt;/a&gt;, the capital of the Arathi nation of &lt;a href=\"Arathor\"&gt;Arathor&lt;/a&gt;, in order to speak to &lt;a href=\"Thoradin\"&gt;King Thoradin&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe elves informed Thoradin that the troll armies were vast and that once the trolls had destroyed Quel'Thalas, they would move on to attack the southlands. The desperate elves, in dire need of military aid, hastily agreed to teach certain select humans to wield magic in exchange for their help against the warbands. Thoradin, distrustful of any magic, agreed to aid the elves out of necessity. Almost immediately, elven sorcerers arrived in Arathor and began to instruct a group of humans in the ways of magic.\nThe elves found that although humans were innately clumsy in their handling of magic, they possessed a startling natural affinity for it. &lt;a href=\"One%20Hundred\"&gt;One hundred men&lt;/a&gt; were taught the very basics of the elves' magical secrets: no more than was absolutely necessary to combat the trolls. Convinced that their human students were ready to aid in the struggle, the elves left Strom and traveled north alongside the mighty armies of King Thoradin.\nThe united elf and human armies clashed against the overwhelming troll warbands at the foot of the Alterac Mountains. The battle lasted for many days, but the unflagging armies of Arathor never tired or gave an inch of ground before the troll onslaught. The elven lords deemed that the time had come to release the powers of their magic upon the enemy. The hundred human magi and a multitude of elven sorcerers called down the fury of the heavens and set the troll armies ablaze. The elemental fires prevented the trolls from regenerating their wounds and burned their tortured forms from the inside out.\nAmong the trolls, whispers spread of a spellbound blade known as &lt;a href=\"%3AFelo%27melorn\"&gt;:Felo'melorn&lt;/a&gt;, empowered by &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; not only to slay the most formidable and cunning of its enemies but also to cut through superior numbers and irrigate battlefields with their blood. Troll &lt;a href=\"witch%20doctor\"&gt;witch doctor&lt;/a&gt;s set about casting hexes and curses against the infamous weapon, but history bears out that even the darkest &lt;a href=\"voodoo\"&gt;voodoo&lt;/a&gt; did little to negate the effectiveness of Felo'melorn during the &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Wars\"&gt;Troll Wars&lt;/a&gt;. It was said that a thousand Amani trolls fell before Felo'melorn's fury, spilling enough Amani blood to brim the walls of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt;. As such, it became known as a legendary troll-killer and bane of trolls.\nAs the troll armies broke and attempted to flee, Thoradin's armies ran them down and slaughtered every last one of their soldiers. The trolls would never fully recover from their defeat, and history would never see the trolls rise as one nation again. Assured that Quel'Thalas was saved from destruction, the elves made a pledge of loyalty and friendship to the nation of Arathor and to the bloodline of its king, Thoradin. Humans and elves would nurture peaceful relations for ages to come.\nThe Great Wars and aftermath.\nDespite their defeat and considered broken, the Amani Empire remained active throughout the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Wars\"&gt;Great Wars&lt;/a&gt; and the fall of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27jin\"&gt;Zul'jin&lt;/a&gt;.\nTribes.\nAll currently known &lt;a href=\"tribe\"&gt;tribe&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;forest troll&lt;/a&gt;s are descended from the Amani Empire. After the &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Wars\"&gt;Troll Wars&lt;/a&gt;, the empire lost much of its territory. Seemingly some of these tribes became independent while others stayed affiliated with the Amani Empire.\nTerritories.\nThe Amani Empire controlled the northeastern areas of &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Kalimdor\"&gt;Ancient Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. After the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, they still held much, if not, all of the region that would later be known as &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. Even though, the arrival of the high elves and the founding of the human kingdom of Arathor diminish their dominance and after the &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Wars\"&gt;Troll Wars&lt;/a&gt; they lost much of it. The following is a list of ruins that are currently associated with &lt;a href=\"tribe\"&gt;tribe&lt;/a&gt;s descended from the Amani Empire."}

The famous Warlord &lt;a href=\"Zul%27jin\"&gt;Zul'jin&lt;/a&gt; was the leader of the &lt;a href=\"tribe\"&gt;tribe&lt;/a&gt; for a time.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Amani%27shi\"&gt;Amani'shi&lt;/a&gt; is a group within the Amani.\nHistory.\nTroll Wars.\nEstablished long before the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20Empire\"&gt;Amani Empire&lt;/a&gt; took its name from the strongest tribe of &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;forest troll&lt;/a&gt;s at the time. After the Amani Empire was shattered by the &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Wars\"&gt;Troll Wars&lt;/a&gt;, most forest trolls settled in areas that were a comfortable distance from &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;. However, the Amani tribe sneered at such precautions as cowardice. Beset by the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt;' powerful sorcery, &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt; was greatly reduced in size, but the Amani tribe remained entrenched at the easternmost edge of the enchanted kingdom. Ironically, the Amani trolls' magic was originally stronger than the high elves until the elves stole ancient knowledge from troll spellcasters.\nFirst War.\nBack during the &lt;a href=\"genocide%20of%20the%20draenei\"&gt;genocide of the draenei&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; had shocked the other &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; clans by integrating some of their former &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt; enemies into the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Once on the world of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, Blackhand tried, at some point, the same thing with the local forest trolls, sending his second, &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt;, to meet with them. Though &lt;a href=\"Zul%27jin\"&gt;Zul'jin&lt;/a&gt; refused, this paved the way for his later alliance with the orcs during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;.\nSecond War.\nStill led by &lt;a href=\"Zul%27jin\"&gt;Zul'jin&lt;/a&gt;, the Amani trolls joined the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;. They did so in part to fight against the high elves, who had joined the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. After the Amani, several other forest trolls joined the Horde war effort as well. They proved to be a valuable addition to the Horde.\nHowever, Zul'jin disappeared mysteriously after the end of the war and the defeat of the Horde.\nThird War.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; led the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; into Quel'Thalas during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the Amani tribe witnessed the resulting slaughter with glee. Acting swiftly, the trolls launched a series of attacks on high elf settlements in the &lt;a href=\"Eversong%20Forest\"&gt;Eversong Forest&lt;/a&gt;. To the trolls' surprise, the few high elves who had survived the invasion seemed greatly weakened and put up a poor fight. The Amani claimed a significant portion of the forest before the elf Prince &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; arrived in Quel'Thalas. When Kael'thas, his magisters, and their guards arrived to &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt; to destroy the corrupted &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;, the Amani tribe also landed on the isle, having been carried by troll &lt;a href=\"destroyer\"&gt;destroyer&lt;/a&gt;s. As the mages destroyed the Sunwell, its blast caught everyone standing near it, troll and &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; alike.\nAfterward, Kael'thas gathered all the surviving elves he could find and gave them a new name: the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;. These blood elves began draining magic from nearby creatures, and they seemed to gain new strength. Even worse, Kael'thas organized them into a fighting force that proved frustratingly effective against the Amani tribe's efforts, even after Kael'thas and his strongest warriors left Quel'Thalas to fight the Scourge elsewhere. In recent days, the blood elves have shown signs of increased magical training and use. The elves' spells have increased in power, and they have rebuilt portions of Quel'Thalas. The blood elves have also begun retaking Eversong Forest. Nevertheless, the Amani tribe remains fiercely dedicated to its battle against the elves, while the diminished elven populace has to continue fighting both the trolls to the east and the Scourge to the south.\nThe Gods of Zul'Aman.\nZul'jin himself had fled to Zul'Aman and began to rebuild his once mighty troll army. After that, the witch doctor &lt;a href=\"Malacrass\"&gt;Malacrass&lt;/a&gt; suggested a way for the Amani to get great power through dark ways, with which Zul'jin, in his anger, agreed. Having survived his ordeal with the high elves, and indeed the entire Scourge invasion that had crippled much of Quel'Thalas, Zul'jin and the Amani persisted in their goal to wipe the elves out. The high elves, having renamed themselves \"blood elves\" in honor of their fallen brethren, began to take back much of Quel'Thalas themselves; Zul'jin, seeing this as an opportunity, coordinated a number of attacks on the reforming elves from &lt;a href=\"Tor%27Watha\"&gt;Tor'Watha&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zeb%27Watha\"&gt;Zeb'Watha&lt;/a&gt;, the Amani's holdings in Eversong, and directly out of Zul'Aman in the Ghostlands. However, Zul'jin's ruthless crusade against Quel'Thalas would be halted by an unexpected development - the blood elves officially joining the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Reaffirming his hatred for the outside world, Zul'jin resolved to take down all of his enemies with this dark new power.\nDespite being able to draw upon the ghostly spirits of each of the four liberated animal gods from Zul'Aman and being able to change his own shape to assume their powers, Zul'jin, and his priests, were slain by the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nRise of the Zandalari.\nTo fill the power vacuum left by the death of their warlord, Zul'jin, the remaining trolls chose their favored champion, &lt;a href=\"Daakara\"&gt;Daakara the Invincible&lt;/a&gt;, to reclaim their lost glory. When &lt;a href=\"Zul\"&gt;Zul&lt;/a&gt; called for the Troll tribes to unite to form a new Troll Empire, Daakara and the Amani agreed, along with &lt;a href=\"Jin%27do\"&gt;Jin'do&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20tribe\"&gt;Gurubashi&lt;/a&gt;. In response, &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear tribe&lt;/a&gt; went about dismantling Jin'do's burgeoning empire within &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Gurub\"&gt;Zul'Gurub&lt;/a&gt;, and then turned his attention to Zul'Aman to deal with the Amani holdouts.\nTo this end, Vol'jin joined forces with his &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; ally &lt;a href=\"Halduron%20Brightwing\"&gt;Ranger General Halduron Brightwing&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Farstriders\"&gt;Farstriders&lt;/a&gt; and marched to nip the Amani empire in the bud. Overstretched, Halduron called upon &lt;a href=\"Vereesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Vereesa Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; to assist their cause, and the two ranger-generals, along with Vol'jin, can be seen making their battle preparations on the outskirts of Zul'Aman.\nThe combined armies request the aid of adventurers to venture into the ancient forest troll capital and put an end to Amani leadership. After deciding on an appropriate battle plan, Vol'jin personally leads a strike force into Zul'Aman, and with the aid of adventurers, puts an end to Daakara (severely weakening the Amani even further) and the Zandalari's efforts within Zul'Aman.\nMists of Pandaria.\nThe remaining Amani have bolstered the Zandalari forces invading the northern shores of Pandaria, along with the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20tribe\"&gt;Gurubashi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Drakkari%20tribe\"&gt;Drakkari&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Farraki%20tribe\"&gt;Farraki tribe&lt;/a&gt;s. Their strength takes part in the &lt;a href=\"Horridon\"&gt;Horridon&lt;/a&gt; fight and the defense of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Elders\"&gt;Council of Elders&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nMembers of the Amani live in the enclave of &lt;a href=\"Tal%27aman\"&gt;Tal'aman&lt;/a&gt;, located at the &lt;a href=\"Port%20of%20Zandalar\"&gt;Port of Zandalar&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt;. They are resistant to the idea of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; allying with &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;, even going as far as to become hostile over it, but remain subservient to the Empire regardless. To remind them of their place, the Amani's champions, disciples of their loa, are slain by Horde adventurers.\nIn spite of their clashing with Rastakhan, many &lt;a href=\"Amani%20Warrior\"&gt;Amani Warrior&lt;/a&gt;s were a part of the procession that mourned him after his death in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Dazar%27alor\"&gt;Battle of Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt;.

Each mushroom only has 150 health, and are easily killed. AOE the tanking area to clear it from Poisonous Mushrooms that spawn in at approximately 30 second intervals. At the same time, try not to kill the Healthy mushrooms while you are AOE-ing the tanking area whenever possible. If you get the \"mini\" debuff from Amanitar, kill a Healthy Mushroom to go back to normal. If possible, try to stand near a Healthy Mushroom.\nKilling a healthy mushroom when you are \"mini\" and close to it removes the debuff and appears to be the key to the encounter. Healing through crit chains is very difficult depending on your tank type - dodge-based druids fare better than defense-based prot warriors.\nTrivia.\nAmanitar is no doubt named for the mushrooms, the genus that is responsible for approximately 95% of the fatalities resulting from mushroom poisoning, but also contains many edible species.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

Though they are aware of some corruption within their ranks, they have tasked some to hunt the corrupted down and, in fact, plan to kill &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt; by activating &lt;a href=\"Reply-Code%20Omega\"&gt;Reply-Code Omega&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Origination\"&gt;Forge of Origination&lt;/a&gt;, though this would also kill everyone else on the planet. The Amathet see everyone else as no different from N'Zoth and believe they all must be purged.\nBackground.\nVery little is known of &lt;a href=\"Sun%20King%20Nahkotep\"&gt;Sun King Nahkotep&lt;/a&gt; who leads the Amathet, but it is known that those closest to him are referred to as \"Suntouched\", a caste of solar magic practitioners. The Amathet use various idols and monuments to channel their solar magic. The Sun Priests are an ancient order who have walked among all tol'vir tribes, but the ones among the Amathet have twisted the tol'vir's beliefs and weaponized them to justify their crusade.\n&lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; striking &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; with his sword unearthed new tombs below &lt;a href=\"Sunstone%20Terrace\"&gt;Sunstone Terrace&lt;/a&gt;, which was their ancient territory, and from those tombs the Amathet emerged. They speak little to other tol'vir, believing them to be betrayers of their sacred duties. They believe that they, stewards of the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s, should alone control the &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt;. When they realized that &lt;a href=\"Rajh\"&gt;Rajh&lt;/a&gt; and his kin were slain, they constructed their own &lt;a href=\"Uldum%20watcher\"&gt;new watchers&lt;/a&gt;, which means they must have an active forge like the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Wills\"&gt;Forge of Wills&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Origination\"&gt;Forge of Origination&lt;/a&gt;. It was later revealed that the Forge they had was, in fact, the Forge of Origination, as they had occupied the Halls of Origination. At the &lt;a href=\"Tombs%20of%20the%20Precursors\"&gt;Tombs of the Precursors&lt;/a&gt; in Uldum, the Amathet are reassembling broken watchers, which is how they obtain them. Among the Amathet's watchers is &lt;a href=\"Saba-tok\"&gt;Saba-tok&lt;/a&gt; who is strangely referred to as a &lt;a href=\"Keeper\"&gt;Keeper&lt;/a&gt;.\nTheir bows are apparently different than those of modern tol'vir, giving the Amathet a range advantage.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the Amathet assaulted the islands of &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Cay\"&gt;Molten Cay&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rotting%20Mire\"&gt;Rotting Mire&lt;/a&gt; in search of Azerite. A &lt;a href=\"Swirling%20Sands\"&gt;Swirling Sands&lt;/a&gt; portal also gave access to an Amathet-held &lt;a href=\"Dusty%20Tomb\"&gt;Dusty Tomb&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt; escaped the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Prison\"&gt;Last Prison&lt;/a&gt; and began attempting to recreate the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Empire\"&gt;Black Empire&lt;/a&gt;, the Amathet began to assault the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Origination\"&gt;Halls of Origination&lt;/a&gt; and surrounding areas of &lt;a href=\"Uldum\"&gt;Uldum&lt;/a&gt;, bringing them into conflict with the &lt;a href=\"Ramkahen%20tribe\"&gt;Ramkahen tribe&lt;/a&gt; and their newly formed &lt;a href=\"Uldum%20Accord\"&gt;Uldum Accord&lt;/a&gt;. The Amathet now viewed the planet as being too far gone to save, and sought to use the Forge of Origination to end the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s' corruption by purging all life on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; through the use of &lt;a href=\"Reply-Code%20Omega\"&gt;Reply-Code Omega&lt;/a&gt;. Fortunately, this was coincidentally discovered in time by &lt;a href=\"High%20Explorer%20Dellorah\"&gt;High Explorer Dellorah&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Explorers%27%20League\"&gt;Explorers' League&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;'s aid and the Amathet's assault on the Halls was ultimately routed.\nSpeculation.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20the%20Sun%20King\"&gt;Tomb of the Sun King's&lt;/a&gt; name presumably refers to &lt;a href=\"Sun%20King%20Nahkotep\"&gt;Sun King Nahkotep&lt;/a&gt;, as he is found here and it is near Sunstone Terrace which was the Amathet's territory before they went to slumber in underground tombs."}

Therefore, although it is slower than the Vashj'ir version, it is widely sought after.\nSeveral factors make this mount desirable to players. The first would be that it is one of two &lt;a href=\"swimming\"&gt;swimming&lt;/a&gt; mounts usable anywhere, the other being the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20Turtle%20%28mount%29\"&gt;Sea Turtle (mount)&lt;/a&gt;, a very rare &lt;a href=\"fishing\"&gt;fishing&lt;/a&gt; drop. Therefore if you can kill Poseidus, you are guaranteed a swimming mount rather than fishing day after day. Another is looks; this is one of only two seahorse mounts in the game, which is very attractive to mount collectors.\nBeing collectable leads into the third factor, which is 'how much gold is it worth to you?' Being BoE, this mount can be sold to other players, and you can usually find one in the &lt;a href=\"auction%20house\"&gt;auction house&lt;/a&gt; from time to time. Players will farm for Poseidus during its spawn times, solely to get the mount to sell (which can include illegal &lt;a href=\"gold%20farmer\"&gt;gold farmer&lt;/a&gt;s: as always, report a suspected gold farmer to the &lt;a href=\"Game%20Master\"&gt;GMs&lt;/a&gt; via &lt;a href=\"ticket\"&gt;ticket&lt;/a&gt;). This can be an option for players that do not want to farm for either mount and can afford local server prices, which are often very high for this mount.\nA fourth, lesser factor would be utility; if you must swim, are not a &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt; or a class that cannot walk on water, why not have a mount that can make you go faster? In this regard, the Sea Turtle is actually a better choice, as it is amphibious and both mounts swim at the same speed. Being able to walk on land means the Sea Turtle can jump above the surface, while the Reins of Poseidus cannot, automatically dismounting the player.\nSource.\nThis item is a guaranteed drop from &lt;a href=\"Poseidus\"&gt;Poseidus&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"rare%20spawn\"&gt;rare spawn&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Shimmering%20Expanse\"&gt;Shimmering Expanse&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Abyssal%20Depths\"&gt;Abyssal Depths&lt;/a&gt;.\nIcon description.\n\"Summons and dismisses a rideable Subdued Seahorse. This mount is a zippy swimmer.\nDue to his capricious nature, swim speed is not affected by effects that increase or decrease mount speed.\"\nMount Journal.\n\"\"One has not truly lived until they have felt the tidal current rushing through their hair while atop a majestic seahorse,\" said no one. Ever.\"\nTrivia.\nA WoW developer known to frequent the &lt;a href=\"http%3A//forums.wow-petopia.com/%7C\"&gt;Petopia forums&lt;/a&gt; was once asked why this mount's speed was limited in Vashj'ir. It was explained that the original goal was for it to have Subdued Abyssal Seahorse speed in Vashj'ir, and Sea Turtle speed outside Vashj'ir.\nHowever, they found that they could not enable both speeds properly. They were forced to choose between either applying only the Subdued Abyssal Seahorse properties, locking it to Vashj'ir, or applying only Sea Turtle properties, which would limit the speed in Vashj'ir, but also allow it to be used everywhere else."}

(You are given a choice of which to summon.) You will need to wait for the skulls to reset before summoning another at that circle.\nThis quest was changed in &lt;a href=\"patch%202.4\"&gt;patch 2.4&lt;/a&gt;, though no mention was made in the patch notes. The change removed the requirement to loot trophy tokens from each of the four mini-bosses, and replaced it with a kill requirement instead. This allows all members of the party to gain credit for the quest with a single summon of each boss. The change is especially beneficial because it allows a party to gain five &lt;a href=\"Time-Lost%20Offering\"&gt;time-lost offerings&lt;/a&gt; (and by extension, five chances to summon and kill &lt;a href=\"Terokk\"&gt;Terokk&lt;/a&gt;) from a single collection of 40 scrolls. However, this change also means it is no longer possible to gather the offerings via auction or other means of trade as a shortcut to completing the quest.\nThe use of the trophy tokens was recycled into a repeatable quest, &lt;a href=\"Tokens%20of%20the%20Descendants\"&gt;Tokens of the Descendants&lt;/a&gt;, which allows a player to get more &lt;a href=\"Time-Lost%20Offering\"&gt;Time-Lost Offering&lt;/a&gt;s as needed. If you keep the tokens from this quest, you can essentially get a 'free' offering.\nOn a final note, if you still have the pre-patch version of the quest in your log, you will need to abandon it and return to &lt;a href=\"Hazzik\"&gt;Hazzik&lt;/a&gt; to pick up the new version."}

While &lt;a href=\"First%20Arcanist%20Thalyssra\"&gt;First Arcanist Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt; argued that the Legion would not be making offers if they were actually capable of destroying the barrier, Melandrus countered by theorizing that the demons must be desperate and needed the Nightwell's power immediately. When Thalyssra and &lt;a href=\"Advisor%20Vandros\"&gt;Advisor Vandros&lt;/a&gt; then began to argue whether or not to accept the Legion's offer, Melandrus told his fellow advisor that even though they could argue all night, the decision ultimately lay with &lt;a href=\"Elisande\"&gt;Grand Magistrix Elisande&lt;/a&gt;.\nTwo days later, however, Melandrus, saying that the nightborne would not become the Legion's honored allies, but its &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt;-cursed servants, joined Thalyssra and several others in planning a rebellion against the Grand Magistrix to prevent her from giving in to the Legion's threats. During the night, the rebels stormed into the city, but were ambushed by Elisande's soldiers. Melandrus and Thalyssra managed to evade the fighting, making their way to just outside the Magistrix's &lt;a href=\"Nighthold\"&gt;palace&lt;/a&gt;. However, in that moment, Melandrus raised his sword and stabbed Thalyssra through the back, saying \"I am sorry, my friend... but allegiance is the only way\". He then pushed her over the edge, sending her into the river below, before joining Advisor Vandros and the Grand Magistrix in bringing the barrier down.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"First Blade of the Grand Magistrix, Melandrus rarely leaves Elisande's side. He has eschewed the magical arts, instead harnessing the power of the Nightwell to heighten his reflexes and his movements to inhuman levels.\"\nOverview.\nMelandrus uses a variety of sword strikes to cripple his enemies, pairing magic with skill in a frightening fashion.\nStrategy.\nAdvisor Melandrus is generally the most difficult boss in Court of Stars. The encounter is somewhat punishing in terms of melee uptime, and so it is important that melee plan movement out so they may react to Melandrus' frequent dashes. A death knight tank is highly recommended on higher Tyrannical keystones, as &lt;a href=\"Vampiric%20Aura%20%28death%20knight%20artifact%20trait%29\"&gt;Vampiric Aura (death knight artifact trait)&lt;/a&gt; (20% leech for 15 seconds to the party upon casting Consumption) is extremely helpful in dealing with Slicing Maelstrom.\nOver time, clones progressively spawn throughout the encounter (at most eight may be active). It is important that party members do not stand near these, for they amplify the damage of Slicing Maelstrom. Additionally, their Piercing Gale lines must be avoided.\nSlicing Maelstrom is the mechanic that singularly makes this boss the hardest in the instance. Advisor Melandrus casts this ability once every 25 seconds after being engaged, and it deals progressively higher damage as additional clones spawn from Blade Surge. Generally speaking everyone should have a defensive cooldown active for this (Prydaz helps, though it does not line up perfectly) and the healer should have a cooldown rotation prepared for the later Maelstrom casts at higher keystone levels. As noted earlier, death knight tanks can mostly trivialize this boss by use of Consumption (which is available for every second Maelstrom cast).\nIt should be noted that Melandrus' actual tank damage is quite low, and therefore tanks can in some cases continue in the event of a near-full wipe to Slicing Maelstrom and go on to kill the boss, even on higher Tyrannical keystones.

When &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Farondis\"&gt;Prince Farondis&lt;/a&gt; planned to destroy the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;, Vandros reported this to &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt; herself. Azshara wasted no time in punishing Farondis and his people. In a frightening display of arcane power, she destroyed the &lt;a href=\"Tidestone%20of%20Golganneth\"&gt;Tidestone of Golganneth&lt;/a&gt;, and in doing so, released a wave of dark energy over all of Azsuna and its inhabitants. Evidently, Vandros would later join the Highborne of Suramar when they created a shield to protect their city.\nTwilight of Suramar.\nVandros was present when , emissary of the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, appeared before the &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt; with his offer: bring down the barrier around &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt;, give him access to the &lt;a href=\"Nightwell\"&gt;Nightwell&lt;/a&gt; and become allies of the Legion, or be destroyed. Afterwards, &lt;a href=\"Advisor%20Melandrus\"&gt;Advisor Melandrus&lt;/a&gt; wondered if the Legion was trying to negotiate because they had need of the Nightwell's power immediately, to which Vandros responded that it is always better to negotiate while having the advantage. &lt;a href=\"First%20Arcanist%20Thalyssra\"&gt;First Arcanist Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt; countered by saying that Vandros was a fool if he believed the demons would keep their word, to which the advisor responded that the nightborne were outnumbered and that it was a risk they had to take. Melandrus ended the argument by saying that the decision was ultimately up to &lt;a href=\"Elisande\"&gt;Grand Magistrix Elisande&lt;/a&gt;.\nTwo days later, with the three-day time limit for Gul'dan's offer nearing its end, Elisande revealed to Vandros that she had decided to accept the Legion's offer and told him to gather her advisors. Despite a brief and unsuccessful uprising within the city by Thalyssra and a group of rebels, Vandros helped the Grand Magistrix bring down the barrier and expose their city to the Legion.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"Vandros is one of Elisande's closest advisors, and an adept at harnessing the arcane magic of the Nightwell, second only to Elisande herself. He would not ordinarily venture into the Arcway himself, but after monitoring the state of the nightfallen resistance and their allies, he now feels the need to take matters into his own hands.\"\nOverview.\nAdvisor Vandros uses the power of the Nightwell to influence time. He frequently summons Chrono Shards and attempts to erase players from existence with Banish In Time."}

She shines when dealing with large packs of weak-to-moderately powerful enemies, or paired with a class capable of healing her, since her survivability against stronger foes is, like the other bodyguards, somewhat unremarkable. Since Aeda counts as a player unit, players can cast &lt;a href=\"Blessing%20of%20Protection\"&gt;Blessing of Protection&lt;/a&gt; and similar spells on her, making her an excellent companion for paladins, priests, shamans, and others.\nAeda's summoning ritual makes her a particularly useful bodyguard if a group finds itself lacking a warlock.
