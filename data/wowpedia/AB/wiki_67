Quick on their heels were vehicles to support weapons and troops at war, and the most versatile of these vehicles has proved to be the siege wagon.\nThe siege wagon is a boxy vehicle with ironbound wooden wheels, an armored skin and an expansive interior. The inside compartment of the siege wagon carries materiel and troops to the front lines. Then, upon arriving at an encampment, some wagons become field hospitals or kitchens, while others are used as tinkers\u2019 workshops or officers\u2019 headquarters. However, the truly remarkable use of siege wagons requires multiple wagons used in combination. Using troops and a block and tackle, siege wagons can be stacked atop one another and bolted together to form mobile &lt;a href=\"siege%20tower\"&gt;siege tower&lt;/a&gt;s that can slowly roll up to the outer fortifications of large cities and bring troops within striking distance. Arrow slits in the sides of a siege wagon allow archers to attack in all directions, and ladders leading through hatches in the top and bottom of the vehicle allow for easy transit between stacked siege wagons. Each siege wagon can extend a 20-foot-long and 4-foot-wide plank to allow troops to cross to fortifications. When siege wagons are stacked to form a siege tower, they remain mobile. It moves at 60 miles per hour and has a crew of 1."}

They were added in \"\".\nCut siege weapons.\nFrom the beginning of \"World of Warcraft\", most races had (and still have) one or more types of nonfunctioning siege weapons stationed throughout their territories. It is unknown if these were an early stage of siege vehicle development that became decorations, or just decorations from the beginning.\nInitially (on a very early version of the community site's PvP page) it was said that \"Something long-term we want to add to battlegrounds to make them even more fun are siege vehicles. We'll begin implementing them after WoW ships, but the intention is to give players catapults and other siege vehicles, and then increase the challenge when it comes to razing the opposing side's town. Once siege vehicles are in, the mechanism for conquering the other side will be to destroy their buildings and not just to kill their NPCs.\" Concept art was shown on the page of a \"Battleground Concept\" that was seemingly a siege battleground, and an \"Orc Demolisher PvP Vehicle\" that was fully rendered but never used in the game.\nIn previews of WotLK, it was said there were originally going to be \"different siege weapons for different races\". This hints at more types than were added, though the current types do not invalidate this.\nEarly cut weapons include:\nThe first two may be early concepts of the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken%20catapult\"&gt;Forsaken catapult&lt;/a&gt;, while the ballista may be just a basic example, although some ballistae did become &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Ballista\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s.\n&lt;a href=\"Flying%20machine\"&gt;Flying machine&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Bomber\"&gt;Bomber&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Shredder\"&gt;Shredder&lt;/a&gt;s were initially going to be added to Wintergrasp, but air/anti-air combat in the zone was cut."}

{"id": "211811", "revid": "46586549", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=211811", "title": "Sif", "text": "Sif was a &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; woman and the wife of &lt;a href=\"Keeper\"&gt;Keeper&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thorim\"&gt;Thorim&lt;/a&gt;. She was murdered by &lt;a href=\"Loken\"&gt;Loken&lt;/a&gt;, who then tricked Thorim into believing that it had been the work of &lt;a href=\"Arngrim%20the%20Insatiable\"&gt;Arngrim&lt;/a&gt;, the king of the &lt;a href=\"frost%20giant\"&gt;frost giant&lt;/a&gt;s. This caused Thorim to turn against his giant allies, and later lapse into a long depression.\nA tendril of &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt; impersonating Sif appears as an add in Thorim's &lt;a href=\"Thorim%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;boss encounter&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ulduar%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\n&lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; believes that, based on their similar names, Sif may have come from the &lt;a href=\"Hyldnir\"&gt;Hyldnir&lt;/a&gt; village of &lt;a href=\"Sifreldar%20Village\"&gt;Sifreldar&lt;/a&gt;, or alternatively that the village was named after her. He has suggested that she may have been the winner of an ancient &lt;a href=\"Hyldsmeet\"&gt;Hyldsmeet&lt;/a&gt;, a Hyldnir competition held to determine who will \"rule by Thorim's side\".\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; fell silent, Thorim's brother &lt;a href=\"Loken\"&gt;Loken&lt;/a&gt; grew close to Sif, often meeting with her in private to tell her of his worries. In time, the two fell in love and began an affair. &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt;, from its prison within Ulduar, twisted Loken's thoughts and turned his love into obsession. Loken began to suggest that he and Sif should make their relationship public, but she refused, knowing that the keepers' unity would be destroyed if Thorim discovered the affair. She eventually broke her ties with Loken and told him to leave her in peace. Afraid of losing her, Loken lashed out and killed her.\nAs Loken scrambled to cover up Sif's death, her spirit appeared before him. To his surprise, she forgave him and told him to hurry, lest Thorim find out the truth and the titan-forged descend into civil war. Unbeknownst to Loken, this version of Sif was an illusion created by Yogg-Saron. On the spirit's suggestion, Loken tricked Thorim into believing that Sif had been killed by &lt;a href=\"Arngrim%20the%20Insatiable\"&gt;Arngrim&lt;/a&gt;, the king of the &lt;a href=\"frost%20giant\"&gt;frost giant&lt;/a&gt;s, triggering a war between Thorim's &lt;a href=\"storm%20giant\"&gt;storm giant&lt;/a&gt;s and Arngrim's frost giants. Sif's false spirit continued to guide Loken and convinced him to create an army with the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Wills\"&gt;Forge of Wills&lt;/a&gt;, with which he ended the conflict. Unbeknownst to him, Yogg-Saron had planted the &lt;a href=\"curse%20of%20flesh\"&gt;curse of flesh&lt;/a&gt; inside the forge. When he noticed the curse spreading among his warriors, Loken called out to Sif for advice, but this time she remained silent. Loken realized that Yogg-Saron had tricked him, a discovery that destroyed the last of his noble heart. At the same time, Thorim brooded at the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Storms\"&gt;Temple of Storms&lt;/a&gt; for centuries over the death of Sif.\nThousands of years later, within the &lt;a href=\"Ulduar%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Ulduar raid&lt;/a&gt;, Yogg-Saron continued to impersonate Sif and used her to keep Thorim subdued. Thorim's hard mode required that he be defeated in her presence, where she attacked the raid with heavy frost damage spells. After the players broke Thorim of his nightmarish controlled state, Sif transformed into a tentacle of Yogg-Saron and dispersed through the ground.\nAbilities.\nSif will cast spells that hit targets for high amounts of frost damage, she will also teleport around the arena into random spots, she cannot be damaged or targeted and is considered an obstacle for the raid encounter."}

{"id": "707043", "revid": "27079649", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=707043", "title": "Sigil", "text": "The sigils (sometimes capitalized as Sigils and occasionally referred to as covenant sigils) are five objects that were long ago given to each of the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Ones\"&gt;Eternal Ones&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt; as symbols of their &lt;a href=\"covenant\"&gt;covenant&lt;/a&gt;s' purpose. The Eternal One &lt;a href=\"Zovaal\"&gt;Zovaal&lt;/a&gt; saw them as keys to forbidden knowledge and tried to claim the sigils of the other Eternal Ones by force, leading his siblings to banish him to the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt; and make him its Jailer.\nAges later, with the Shadowlands in disarray, the Jailer once again began working to claim the sigils. If he obtained all five, nothing would stop him from reaching the &lt;a href=\"Sepulcher%20of%20the%20First%20Ones\"&gt;Sepulcher of the First Ones&lt;/a&gt;. He eventually obtained four of the five keys, at which point the &lt;a href=\"Primus\"&gt;Primus&lt;/a&gt; decreed that the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;mortal heroes&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; had to defeat Zovaal in the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Sanctum of Domination&lt;/a&gt;. As a contingency in case their assault failed, the covenants also had to create new sigils so that they could pursue Zovaal to the Sepulcher. In order for new sigils to be made, however, each covenant first had to \"remember its purpose... and find its future\".\nThe assault did indeed fail, with Zovaal claiming the fifth sigil from the &lt;a href=\"Arbiter\"&gt;Arbiter&lt;/a&gt; and using the combined power to open a portal to &lt;a href=\"Zereth%20Mortis\"&gt;Zereth Mortis&lt;/a&gt;, the location of the Sepulcher. The covenants gathered at &lt;a href=\"Keeper%27s%20Respite\"&gt;Keeper's Respite&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Korthia\"&gt;Korthia&lt;/a&gt; to enact the Primus' contingency plan and presented the four new sigils they'd made, which the Primus could use\u2014along with a replacement for the Arbiter's sigil\u2014to forge a key to follow Zovaal. The Arbiter's &lt;a href=\"attendant\"&gt;attendant&lt;/a&gt;s later recreated the sigil, allowing them and the Primus to open a new portal to Zereth Mortis.\nStatus.\nVenthyr (Revendreth).\n&lt;a href=\"Sire%20Denathrius\"&gt;Sire Denathrius&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Revendreth\"&gt;Revendreth&lt;/a&gt; willingly gave his sigil to the Jailer at some point. In order for &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Renathal\"&gt;Prince Renathal&lt;/a&gt; and his allies to create a new one, they would need all seven medallions of the &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Harvesters\"&gt;Court of Harvesters&lt;/a&gt;, including the &lt;a href=\"%3AMedallion%20of%20Wrath\"&gt;:Medallion of Wrath&lt;/a&gt; held by &lt;a href=\"the%20Stonewright\"&gt;the Stonewright&lt;/a&gt;, who up until then had remained neutral. Renathal and his allies sought out the Stonewright to inform her that her old nemeses\u2014the &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt;\u2014had returned to the Shadowlands and that they needed her medallion. However, several members of Renathal's envoy were subsequently revealed to be disguised nathrezim who proceeded to steal the Medallion of Wrath. After a chase around Revendreth, the Stonewright, a &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Walker\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt;, and their companions defeated the nathrezim &lt;a href=\"Mal%27Ganis\"&gt;Mal'Ganis&lt;/a&gt; and took back the medallion. The Maw Walker brought the medallion to &lt;a href=\"Sinfall\"&gt;Sinfall&lt;/a&gt;, where Renathal, the Stonewright, and the other Harvesters used the assembled medallions to forge a new sigil. The Stonewright subsequently delivered the sigil to the Primus along with the unity and purpose of Revendreth.\nKyrian (Bastion).\nThe Jailer obtained the sigil of &lt;a href=\"Kyrestia%20the%20Firstborne\"&gt;Kyrestia&lt;/a&gt;\u2014Archon of the &lt;a href=\"kyrian\"&gt;kyrian&lt;/a&gt;\u2014by sending his disguised vessel, the &lt;a href=\"Domination\"&gt;dominated&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;a href=\"Elysian%20Hold\"&gt;Elysian Hold&lt;/a&gt; under the pretense of wanting an audience with the Archon. Anduin used the &lt;a href=\"mourneblade\"&gt;mourneblade&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kingsmourne\"&gt;Kingsmourne&lt;/a&gt; to stab Kyrestia through the chest and extract the sigil before returning to the Maw to give it to his master.\nForging a new sigil required the presence of all five of &lt;a href=\"Bastion\"&gt;Bastion&lt;/a&gt;'s paragons and temples. Kyrestia initially wanted to replace the deceased &lt;a href=\"Devos\"&gt;Devos&lt;/a&gt;, former Paragon of Loyalty, by naming her polemarch &lt;a href=\"Adrestes\"&gt;Adrestes&lt;/a&gt; to the same position. However, he convinced her to replace the virtue of Loyalty with Devotion, since it was Loyalty that had led to the fracturing of the kyrian and the forming of the rebel &lt;a href=\"Forsworn\"&gt;Forsworn&lt;/a&gt;. After rededicating the Citadel of Loyalty into the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Devotion\"&gt;Temple of Devotion&lt;/a&gt; and recruiting the Forsworn to the cause, the kyrian gathered at the &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20the%20Archon\"&gt;Seat of the Archon&lt;/a&gt;, where Kyrestia anointed Adrestes the Paragon of Devotion. The five paragons and the Archon then worked together to form the new sigil, which Kyrestia declared would symbolize their path forward and the unity between kyrian and Forsworn. Uther subsequently delivered the sigil to the Primus along with the devotion of Bastion.\nNight fae (Ardenweald).\nAfter the attack on the Archon, the Jailer sent a Mawsworn army to claim the &lt;a href=\"Winter%20Queen\"&gt;Winter Queen&lt;/a&gt;'s sigil, triggering &lt;a href=\"%3Athe%20Battle%20of%20Ardenweald\"&gt;:the Battle of Ardenweald&lt;/a&gt;. The queen hid her sigil inside the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20the%20Forest\"&gt;Heart of the Forest&lt;/a&gt; to keep it safe, but Anduin managed to breach the Heart and absorb the sigil into Kingsmourne\u2014causing the Heart to partially wither in the process\u2014before escaping back to his master. After the completion of a ritual to stabilize the powers of the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Warrior\"&gt;Night Warrior&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;, the Winter Queen and her allies used their &lt;a href=\"anima\"&gt;anima&lt;/a&gt; to heal Heart of the Forest, bringing the forces of &lt;a href=\"Death\"&gt;Death&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;Life&lt;/a&gt; into harmony once more and restoring the night fae sigil. &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Moonberry\"&gt;Lady Moonberry&lt;/a&gt; subsequently delivered this sigil to the Primus along with the steadfastness of &lt;a href=\"Ardenweald\"&gt;Ardenweald&lt;/a&gt;.\nNecrolord (Maldraxxus).\nBefore he went to investigate the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Primus\"&gt;Primus&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxus\"&gt;Maldraxxus&lt;/a&gt; entrusted his sigil to the &lt;a href=\"attendant\"&gt;attendant&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Korthia\"&gt;Korthia&lt;/a&gt;. He believed that even locking it away in the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20Secrets\"&gt;Vault of Secrets&lt;/a&gt; might not be enough to keep it safe, so he created an additional safeguard by binding it with the &lt;a href=\"magic%20of%20memory\"&gt;magic of memory&lt;/a&gt;, which he believed that not even Zovaal could untangle.\nThe Primus subsequently traveled to the Maw, where the Jailer defeated him, took his memories from him, and turned him into the &lt;a href=\"Runecarver\"&gt;Runecarver&lt;/a&gt;. The sigil, however, remained safe in Korthia for years until the Jailer pulled the entire realm into the Maw and sent his &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt; to attack the Vault of Secrets. Unaware of what the Jailer was after, the attendant leader &lt;a href=\"Tal-Galan\"&gt;Tal-Galan&lt;/a&gt; decided he and a Maw Walker had to claim the prize in question before the Mawsworn did. He enlisted the Primus' apprentice, &lt;a href=\"Bonesmith%20Heirmir\"&gt;Bonesmith Heirmir&lt;/a&gt;, to accompany them and help open the vault. By recreating the message the Primus had given to the attendants, the group learned what the Mawsworn's objective was and made their way to the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20the%20Sigil\"&gt;Chamber of the Sigil&lt;/a&gt;. The Mawsworn &lt;a href=\"Xalvez%20the%20Collector\"&gt;Xalvez the Collector&lt;/a&gt; attacked them and tried to steal the prize, but Heirmir and the Maw Walker defeated him and took the bound sigil back to &lt;a href=\"Keeper%27s%20Respite\"&gt;Keeper's Respite&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Highlord Bolvar&lt;/a&gt; noted that the magic binding it was reminiscent of the Maw Walker's interactions with the Runecarver and suggested that the amnesiac prisoner was their best chance of untangling it. Heirmir and the hero traveled to &lt;a href=\"Torghast%2C%20Tower%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Torghast&lt;/a&gt; and gave the sigil to the Runecarver, unexpectedly restoring all of his memories and causing him to transform back into the Primus. The Jailer immediately noticed this and arrived with Anduin and an army of Mawsworn. With help from Heirmir and the hero, the Primus tried to hold off the attackers and reminded Zovaal that \"Should you strike me down, my sigil will be lost to you forever\". However, he wasn't expecting the Jailer's vessel to be carrying a mourneblade, and Anduin managed to use Kingsmourne to sever the sigil from the Primus' body and launch it into the Jailer's hand. Zovaal and his minions then left, allowing the Primus to return to Keeper's Respite with his allies and reveal his contingency plan to have each of the covenants make new sigils.\nAfter the covenants dealt with the most immediate threats to their position by defeating the Jailer's servants &lt;a href=\"Helya\"&gt;Helya&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vyraz\"&gt;Vyraz&lt;/a&gt;, the Primus reforged his sigil and entrusted it to &lt;a href=\"Draka\"&gt;Draka&lt;/a&gt; until he had need of it, at which point Draka delivered it back to him along with the might of Maldraxxus.\nThe Arbiter.\nThe fifth sigil originally belonged to Zovaal himself when he served as the Arbiter of the Shadowlands, but it was stripped from him when he betrayed the other Eternal Ones and was used to create a &lt;a href=\"Arbiter\"&gt;new Arbiter&lt;/a&gt; to replace him. The sigil appeared as a floating orb in the center of the new Arbiter's chest. In the warning he left at the &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20the%20Primus\"&gt;Seat of the Primus&lt;/a&gt;, the Primus described the Arbiter as \"the final key\" and stated that she had to be protected at all costs. During the Battle of Ardenweald, the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; stayed in &lt;a href=\"Oribos\"&gt;Oribos&lt;/a&gt; to keep the Arbiter's essence safe.\nAt the end of the &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;confrontation&lt;/a&gt; between Azeroth's heroes and &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, the Jailer engulfed Oribos in the Maw. He blasted the Arbiter with a bolt of power and then drew her essence out of her body, causing her to disintegrate. The orb entered the hole at the center of his chest, restoring the power that had been taken from him, fully empowering him with a suit of armor, and allowing him to escape with Anduin through a portal to the Sepulcher. The Primus told the Maw Walkers that he'd have to find something to replace the Arbiter's sigil in order to follow Zovaal. When the time arrived, the Primus gathered with three of the Arbiter's &lt;a href=\"attendant\"&gt;attendant&lt;/a&gt;s\u2014&lt;a href=\"Tal-Inara\"&gt;Tal-Inara&lt;/a&gt; the Honored Voice, &lt;a href=\"Overseer%20Kah-Delen\"&gt;Overseer Kah-Delen&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Overseer%20Kah-Sher\"&gt;Overseer Kah-Sher&lt;/a&gt;\u2014in the &lt;a href=\"Crucible%20%28Oribos%29\"&gt;Crucible&lt;/a&gt;. Although her presence was \"lost to darkness\", the Arbiter's voice still \"sang\" within her attendants, allowing them to recreate her sigil with the Primus' help. They then used all five sigils to create a gateway of their own to Zereth Mortis.\nOther.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Prototype%20Pantheon\"&gt;Prototype Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; in the Sepulcher of the First Ones drop a trinket named &lt;a href=\"The%20First%20Sigil\"&gt;The First Sigil&lt;/a&gt;, whose effect associates it with all four covenants. It's unknown how this relates to the other sigils."}

As of late 2020, it consisted of around 200 individuals.\nOverview.\nTeam 1's existence (in form, if not in name) stems back to at least 1994. Indeed, before and during the development of \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\", Blizzard only had a single internal development team, which managed every videogame released, except the &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20franchise\"&gt;\"Diablo\" series&lt;/a&gt;. After the release of \"World of Warcraft\", it was clear that Blizzard needed a dedicated team to update and expand the game, so they split the workforce and created &lt;a href=\"Team%202\"&gt;Team 2&lt;/a&gt; to continue the development of \"World of Warcraft\", while Team 1 would take charge of the \"&lt;a href=\"StarCraft%20franchise\"&gt;StarCraft II&lt;/a&gt;\" project. Blizzard thus started to identify their internal teams by a number.\nFrom 2012-2019, Team 1 was in charge of \"\". Prior to that, the team had made \"box products\" for 15-20 years, which involved a more traditional schedule: working on a title for a couple of years, and then releasing it, and perhaps producing an expansion another couple of years later. \"Heroes of the Storm\", however, is in a \"constant state of evolution\", and the team plans to maintain their schedule of content and adjustment releases every 4-6 weeks.\nAs of April 2019, \"Heroes of the Storm\" is now part of the &lt;a href=\"Classic%20Games\"&gt;Classic Games&lt;/a&gt; team.\n&lt;a href=\"Team%201\"&gt;Team 1&lt;/a&gt; worked on \"\". However, the game was poorly received. Team 1's next project was a remake of \"Diablo II\", but in a postmortem of \"Reforged\", Team 1 was removed from the project, and development turned over to &lt;a href=\"Team%203\"&gt;Team 3&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vicarious%20Visions\"&gt;Vicarious Visions&lt;/a&gt;. \nOn Oct. 15, 2020, Blizzard informed members of Team 1 that it was reorganizing the entire division. In the following weeks, members of the team were given opportunities to interview for jobs elsewhere within Blizzard. Those who did not find positions in the company were gradually cut. Others left for independent studios such as Frost Giant Studios and DreamHaven Inc. By January 2021, Team 1 had been removed from development of \"Reforged\", and replaced with a new division."}

After the release of \"World of Warcraft\", it was clear that Blizzard needed a dedicated team to update and expand the game, so they split the workforce and created Team 2 to continue the development of \"World of Warcraft\", while &lt;a href=\"Team%201\"&gt;Team 1&lt;/a&gt; would take charge of the \"&lt;a href=\"StarCraft%20franchise\"&gt;StarCraft II&lt;/a&gt;\" project. Blizzard thus started to identify their internal teams by a number.\nIn February 2019, after a round of layoffs at &lt;a href=\"Activision%20Blizzard\"&gt;Activision Blizzard&lt;/a&gt;, it was announced that the team would be expanded. &lt;a href=\"Proletariat\"&gt;Proletariat&lt;/a&gt; has been working with Blizzard since May 2022, working with Team 2 on \"World of Warcraft\" and later were bought by Blizzard in June 2022."}

{"id": "734413", "revid": "6295293", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=734413", "title": "Team color", "text": "As a tradition of RTS games, team colors are used to distinguish different side during a battle. The rules vary for each game.\nThe color of each side is hardcoded in both campaigns. Since most battles are usually &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s versus &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s there is not much room left for confusion, but two missions are actually humans versus humans and orcs versus orcs. There are unique hero units but without specific team colors.\nYou can't select your team color in multiplayer games. You will be assigned the team color usually associated to your race. If the other player is playing the same race, both of you will see their opponent's units in the alternative color (i.e. if both players select humans, both will see their own units as blue and the opponent's units as red; if both select orcs, both will see their own units as red and the opponent's units as blue).\n\"Warcraft II\".\nIn ' and ' each faction on a map must now have a different color, even when fighting on the same side, which is why many &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;ish &lt;a href=\"Clan%23Orcish%20clan%20system\"&gt;clans&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"kingdom\"&gt;kingdom&lt;/a&gt;s were created and are displayed on the &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20II%20ranks\"&gt;ranking board&lt;/a&gt; at the end of a game. Most playable hero units such as &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar%20%28Warcraft%20II%29\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Uther%20Lightbringer%20%28Warcraft%20II%29\"&gt;Uther Lightbringer&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall%20%28Warcraft%20II%29\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt; are depicted using the Violet color to distinguish them from their surrounding troops, though this isn't always true.\nNevertheless, in campaign missions, heroes will always be a different color than non-unique units of the same class. For example, in &lt;a href=\"Slayer%20of%20the%20Shadowmoon%20%28WC2%20Orc%29\"&gt;Slayer of the Shadowmoon&lt;/a&gt;, Grom Hellscream is red the color of the Warsong, but his forces are orange, so the player won't get Grom Hellscream confused with another &lt;a href=\"Grunt%20%28Warcraft%20II%29\"&gt;Grunt&lt;/a&gt; of the same color.\nYou still can't select your team color in multiplayer games. You will be assigned a team color randomly among eight available.\n\"Warcraft III\".\nIn ' and ' there are no more unique colors associated to each factions, many different factions can now share the same color depending on context. &lt;a href=\"Hero%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Heroes&lt;/a&gt; are also surrounded by an aura matching their team color to distinguish them from other units. With this and the fact that they have unique models now, heroes are generally no longer distinguished by having a different team color in the campaign, although some such as &lt;a href=\"Varimathras%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Varimathras&lt;/a&gt; are still represented with a different color.\nIn multiplayer you can choose any color between 12 (\"classic\") and 24 (\"\") available.\n\"World of Warcraft\".\nAs it is heavily inspired by its RTS roots, \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" displays many factions with strong color schemes, but those are usually now carried through &lt;a href=\"tabard\"&gt;tabard&lt;/a&gt;s and standards, as faction-specific &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s usually carry more elaborate equipment than just having a single team color. For example, the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; is emblematic for having red armor, but they also prominently feature white, gold and black colors. Some factions are still referencing their RTS days however, with the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani trolls&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt; retaining their iconic red mohawks from \"Warcraft II\"."}

{"id": "63373", "revid": "22514", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=63373", "title": "Base mana", "text": "Base mana refers to how much &lt;a href=\"mana\"&gt;mana&lt;/a&gt; a character has before it is modified by &lt;a href=\"talents\"&gt;talents&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"enchants\"&gt;enchants&lt;/a&gt;, and other &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt; effects. As of &lt;a href=\"patch%203.0.2\"&gt;patch 3.0.2&lt;/a&gt;, all spell costs are a percentage of base mana. Prior to that, most spells cost a fixed amount of mana, rather than a percentage of base mana, with a few exceptions.\nThe value is in most cases dependent on class only, not on race. A character being both a mana-using class and a &lt;a href=\"gnome%20%28playable%29\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt; does however have a slight advantage compared to another race being the same class due to &lt;a href=\"Expansive%20Mind\"&gt;Expansive Mind&lt;/a&gt;.\nSignificant Base Mana Values.\nThese are the correct values as of &lt;a href=\"patch%202.4.3\"&gt;patch 2.4.3&lt;/a&gt; for level 70, &lt;a href=\"patch%203.0.8\"&gt;patch 3.0.8&lt;/a&gt; for level 80, and &lt;a href=\"patch%204.0.3\"&gt;patch 4.0.3&lt;/a&gt; for level 85.\nCalculation.\nAs stated above, the base mana pool is only dependent on character class. Each race will have the exact same base mana. The calculation is quite simple. \n Base Mana = MaxMana - ManaFromIntellect\n = MaxMana - ( min(20, Int) + 15*(Int - min(20, Int) ) )\n = MaxMana - (20 + (15*(Int \u2013 20))) //for Intellect 20 or over\n = MaxMana - (Int) //for Intellect under 20\nMana From Intellect can be seen by hovering your mouse over the Intellect stat on your character screen. The part that says \"Increase Mana by XXXX\" is how much Intellect is boosting your max mana.\nNote: Some talents and items boost max mana. e.g.:\nRemove the effect of this talent before doing the computation. For example, if a character has 11000 mana and has a +10% mana effect, then divide 11000 by 1.1 first, to get 10000, then subtract the amount of mana it says is granted by Intellect.\n Example : Kalium, Level 70 Human Warlock. Total Mana: 8695. Intellect Increases Mana by 5824.\n Base Mana = 8695 - ( Talents = 0 ) = 8695\n = 8695 - 5824 \n = 2871 Base Mana Pool\nAs a sanity check, it can be noted that most spells (as of Patch 3.0.2) cost a percentage of base mana. This can make it very easy to verify that the numbers are correct.\nFor example, Rank 7 of &lt;a href=\"Mind%20Flay\"&gt;Mind Flay&lt;/a&gt; for a level 70 priest without &lt;a href=\"Focused%20Mind\"&gt;Focused Mind&lt;/a&gt; nor &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Focus%20%28priest%20talent%29\"&gt;Shadow Focus (priest talent)&lt;/a&gt; costs 9% of base mana. In game, this shows up as 235 mana. 9% of 2620 is 235.8 (the numbers all get rounded down).\nTable of all values.\nYou can use the following script to print your current Base Mana value, assuming you have no mana increasing effects (such as warlock's &lt;a href=\"Fel%20Vitality\"&gt;Fel Vitality&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"Beaming%20Earthsiege%20Diamond\"&gt;Beaming Earthsiege Diamond&lt;/a&gt;). The formula subtracts the amount of mana you gain though intelligence from your maximum mana.\n /script local mm = UnitManaMax(\"player\"); local int = UnitStat(\"player\", 4); local mfi = math.min(20,int)+15*(int-math.min(20,int)); DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessage(\"BaseMana: \"..mm-mfi..\" = \"..mm..\"-\"..mfi);\nThe following tables are lists known Base Mana values for each class, by level.\n\"NOTE: As of Cataclysm Hunters no longer use mana\"\nReferences.\nBold text"}

Destroy them, and the &lt;a href=\"Aether-tech%20Adept\"&gt;Aether-tech Adept&lt;/a&gt; appears. The disruptor towers launch AoEs at the NPCs and players; a large group (raid of 25) is recommended to clear this one, but it may be possible to get the gems with a smaller group, if you buy quickly and then wipe.

The &lt;a href=\"Aether-tech%20Master\"&gt;Aether-tech Master&lt;/a&gt; appears upon completion of the event. The Master sells Meta Gems, Geodes and Accelerator Modules:\nThe Metamorphosis Geodes can be \"opened\" like lockboxes and most likely contain a armor piece.\nAccelerator Modules.\nThese can be used on the small rods that stick up from the ground near the long tunnels of rings on Bash'ir Landing. These are rather buggy at the moment, so be sure that no mobs are in the tunnel, or about to enter the tunnel when you use the controls or the summoned boss could bug and despawn. Summoned harbingers drop an &lt;a href=\"Apexis%20Crystal%20%28item%29\"&gt;Apexis Crystal (item)&lt;/a&gt; and a couple of boe items, easily five-mannable.

The warfront was won by the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, but Bashal'Aran was later left in ruins once again.\nHistory.\nAncient times.\nBefore the time of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt; brought her favored servitors, those of the &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt;, to the twin towns of &lt;a href=\"Ameth%27Aran\"&gt;Ameth'Aran&lt;/a&gt; and Bashal'Aran. To govern these towns, Azshara placed &lt;a href=\"Athrikus%20Narassin\"&gt;Athrikus Narassin&lt;/a&gt;, an elf of considerable magical power. His second, a mage known for his prowess in the arcane arts as much as with his physical abilities, was &lt;a href=\"Asterion\"&gt;Asterion&lt;/a&gt;, who lived among the people of Bashal'Aran, and went many times to Ameth'Aran to see to the needs and wants of its people. In its prime, the twin cities were graced by the blessing of the queen and were a sight to behold, with bazaars and temples to &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;.\nEventually, these two cities were destroyed when the first &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; was shattered. After the Sundering, the powerful Athrikus Narassin used his craft to create a &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Moonstone%20Seal\"&gt;moonstone seal&lt;/a&gt;, forming a prison to hold Asterion by the means of magic. The reasons why he was held in the ruins of Bashal'Aran by his former master are unknown, but from that point on, he began a long and painful life. When he died at some point, Asterion discovered to his horror that even as a specter he was still imprisoned.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nThousands of years later, the ruins of Bashal'Aran were overrun with &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic minions - &lt;a href=\"grell\"&gt;grell&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"satyr\"&gt;satyr&lt;/a&gt;s - which had taken up residence in the area. These evil creatures fed upon the magical energies left among the ruins, their powers growing from the continued exposure. Even so, they never approached the shrine where Asterion was imprisoned.\nAn Alliance &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; managed to recover the seal imprisoning Asterion from the &lt;a href=\"Deth%27ryll\"&gt;Deth'ryll&lt;/a&gt; satyr and went south to Ameth'Aran where it could be destroyed, finally freeing the ghostly elf from a life of torment.\nCataclysm.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, Bashal'Aran became inhabited by &lt;a href=\"Cursed%20Highborne\"&gt;Cursed&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Writhing%20Highborne\"&gt;Writhing Highborne&lt;/a&gt;, the ghostly remains of the denizens that once inhabited the city. &lt;a href=\"Ranger%20Glynda%20Nal%27Shea\"&gt;Ranger Glynda Nal'Shea&lt;/a&gt; sent adventurers to the ruins to extinguish the Final Flame of Bashal'Aran so their ancestors' spirits could find peace.\n&lt;a href=\"Arya%20Autumnlight\"&gt;Arya Autumnlight&lt;/a&gt; came to the ruins to grant peace to these troubled spirits. However, the task put a heavy burden on her mind and she asked for help from an adventurer. With the traveler help, they managed to accomplish the task.\nA night elf druid by the name of &lt;a href=\"Cerellean%20Whiteclaw\"&gt;Cerellean Whiteclaw&lt;/a&gt; sent adventurers to Bashal'Aran to destroy the spirit of her lover, &lt;a href=\"Anaya%20Dawnrunner\"&gt;Anaya Dawnrunner&lt;/a&gt;, in order to free her. Once done, the two lovers said farewell as Anaya's spirit faded away.\nBattle for Azeroth and aftermath.\nIt was at Bashal'Aran where &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; performed the ritual to become the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Warrior\"&gt;Night Warrior&lt;/a&gt;, and where the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Eye of Elune&lt;/a&gt; was located. The combined Alliance forces under Maiev and Shandris successfully fought to defend Tyrande from waves of Horde attackers, upon which the newly empowered Tyrande immediately slew the entire Horde battalion. \nAfterward, Bashal'Aran became the base of operations for the Alliance and the Horde during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Darkshore\"&gt;Battle for Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;, depending on which faction is assaulting the zone. &lt;a href=\"Jarod%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Jarod Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; was stationed here as a Recruitment Officer, as were most of &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;'s surviving &lt;a href=\"warden\"&gt;warden&lt;/a&gt;s and the major commanders of the &lt;a href=\"Gilnean\"&gt;Gilnean&lt;/a&gt; forces sent to assist the kaldorei. &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20Cordressa%20Briarbow\"&gt;Sentinel Cordressa Briarbow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Moon%20Priestess%20Lasara\"&gt;Moon Priestess Lasara&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Erion%20Shadewhisper\"&gt;Erion Shadewhisper&lt;/a&gt; were all present as well, situated at the Hunter's Lodge, the Altar of Elders and the Glaiveworks, respectively.\nFor a time, Bashal'Aran remained an Alliance stronghold in the region after the &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Black%20Moon\"&gt;Army of the Black Moon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; ultimately triumphed over the Horde. &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; gave her victory speech there before the kaldorei and their allies before she went into the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;.\nDespite this, some time after the war, &lt;a href=\"Zekhan\"&gt;Zekhan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt; visited Darkshore and found that both, Ameth'Aran and Bashal'Aran, were in ruins. From the remains, they took rubbings of the tablets and sent them to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; for translation. When it was done, the tablet spoke about the avatars of Elune. Zekhan ultimately noted that the twin cities are now nothing but dust.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

Basilisks are classified as &lt;a href=\"beast\"&gt;beast&lt;/a&gt;s and as of \"\" can be &lt;a href=\"tame\"&gt;tame&lt;/a&gt;d by &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThere are basilisks on the worlds of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mardum%2C%20the%20Shattered%20Abyss\"&gt;Mardum&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;.\nAzeroth basilisks.\nBasilisks are heavily-armored, six-legged lizards which are related to the &lt;a href=\"crocolisk\"&gt;crocolisk&lt;/a&gt;. Basilisk stomachs are capable of dissolving nearly anything. Because of this, basilisks have a fondness for eating crystals and rocks from the area they inhabit. The basilisks of Azeroth long had a fondness for the legendary \"singing crystals\" that grow in &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs a side effect of eating the crystals, the Basilisk have mutated: the mystical crystals now grow from their scaly hides, giving them even greater power against their enemies. This not only makes their hides extremely hard, but gives them a unique power. They're best known for their ability to petrify a person with their stare. Due to this, basilisk parts are often sought by &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s and alchemists for study. These powerful, enchanted creatures are something of an anomaly throughout the land of Azeroth. They are also found on the &lt;a href=\"Draenor%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;alternate Draenor&lt;/a&gt; and likewise can turn their enemies into stone. Basilisks are rock-eaters, and are fed a diet of flowers and stones at the &lt;a href=\"Menagerie%20%28Suramar%29\"&gt;Suramar Menagerie&lt;/a&gt;.\nOutland basilisks.\nAnother type of creature native to Outland is also known as a basilisk. Unlike a normal basilisk, their skin comes in smooth bright colors, and they have three glowing eyes. These basilisks are commonly found in various zones throughout Outland, often inhabiting the cracked edges of the world. Their notable drops include &lt;a href=\"Chunk%20o%27%20Basilisk\"&gt;Chunk o' Basilisk&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dampscale%20Basilisk%20Eye\"&gt;Dampscale Basilisk Eye&lt;/a&gt;. While they appear reptilian like their Azerothian counterparts, they do in fact suckle their young, as evidenced by the &lt;a href=\"Canyon%20Icemother\"&gt;Canyon Icemother&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiology.\nA basilisk's meat, brain and milk are suitable for consuming. Their meat is even considered a delicacy among the &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Desolace\"&gt;Desolace&lt;/a&gt;.\nTheir blood can be used in &lt;a href=\"blood%20magic\"&gt;blood magic&lt;/a&gt; rituals, and even in a potion to help cure blindness. Their eyes, along with the ability to turn victims to stone, luckily lose their properties once slain. They can still be used, however, to help focus and concentrate magics, and in potions to induce prophetic visions. Their heart, while made of complete stone, can be used in certain shaman rituals, their spine can be harvested and used in powerful enchanting, and their tail and hide can both be used to fashion armor.\nIn the RPG.\nBasilisks are large-thick bodied reptiles with six stumpy legs and a scaly hide studded with shimmering crystals. Their eyes shine with a pale, eerie glow. The creatures built their nests near the crystal beds and even rubbed against them. In time, basilisks were born with chunks of crystal growing from their hides. The crystals' mystical nature gives basilisks great power against any would invade their lairs. While gentle enough when left alone, basilisks will defend their nests with great ferocity. In addition to biting and clawing, basilisks will focus the power of the crystals in their hide to plunge intruders into slumber, lull their prey to sleep or even turn them to stone. If that attack should fail, basilisks unleash their petrifying gaze upon their foes.\nBasilisks are possessed of barely more than animal intelligence but can put prey to sleep or even turn enemies to stone (if they aren't hungry). While fierce fighters, basilisks do not exhibit cruel or violent tendencies. They defend their territories and hunt other creatures, even sapient ones, for food. Basilisks' hides range from dark chestnut shades of brown to mossy green and ocean blue. Males tend to be larger and brighter than females. Immature basilisks usually stand as tall and wide as an adult boar. Full-grown basilisks grow to 10 feet in length and weigh up to 2,500 pounds. After mating, a basilisk pair remains together for several months. The female buries her eggs in warm earth and rotting plant matter; she guards the eggs while her mate hunts and brings her food. After the young hatch, the male departs. A basilisk stays at range and targets its enemies with sleep. Once its prey enters range, the basilisk switches to its petrifying gaze attack. When the enemy reaches a distance of 15 or so from the basilisk, the basilisk charges. Basilisks are ferocious fighters but not suicidal; they retreat when the odds turn against them.\nManual of Monsters.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Manual%20of%20Monsters\"&gt;Manual of Monsters&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"Manual%20of%20Monsters/Appendix%20Three\"&gt;Appendix Three&lt;/a&gt; another type of basilisk is given, the &lt;a href=\"Manual%20of%20Monsters/Appendix%20Three%23Ice%20Basilisk\"&gt;Ice Basilisk&lt;/a&gt;, however, the validity of the source is disputed.\nInspiration.\nIn European bestiaries and legends, a is a legendary reptile reputed to be king of serpents and said to have the power of causing death by a single glance. The basilisk is popular in some forms of fantasy (a large number of readers will recognize the major antagonist from \"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\"), in some cases as a traditional snake, in others as a sort of lizard. Though it is generally believed that basilisks are capable of reproducing normally, it is possible to create a basilisk through a sort of magical ritual \u2014 this species was not thought to breed naturally, the arcane offspring of a chicken and a toad. This parentage created the composite \"cockatrice\" image of a serpent with certain elements of chicken biology. As a rule of thumb, \"basilisk\" refers to the creature itself, while \"cockatrice\" refers to the composite chicken/serpent imagery. The Basilisk's gaze is fatal when met directly, but causes petrification (remaining as still as stone, but still alive) if met indirectly. In a number of modern fantasy, the Basilisk's gaze always turns a being to stone, in the same manner as a Gorgon.\nMore specifically, \"Warcrafts basilisks appear to be heavily influenced by the multi-legged, lizard-like basilisks of '."}

It features four bosses plus one optional &lt;a href=\"Heroic%20mode\"&gt;heroic&lt;/a&gt; boss. The Bastion of Twilight, along with &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20the%20Four%20Winds\"&gt;Throne of the Four Winds&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blackwing%20Descent\"&gt;Blackwing Descent&lt;/a&gt;, is meant to be the \"&lt;a href=\"Naxxramas\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt;\" of Cataclysm: an entry level raiding experience. The instance entrance is located on top of the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Citadel\"&gt;Twilight Citadel&lt;/a&gt; in southwestern &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Highlands\"&gt;Twilight Highlands&lt;/a&gt; overlooking &lt;a href=\"Loch%20Modan\"&gt;Loch Modan&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; emerged from &lt;a href=\"Deepholm\"&gt;Deepholm&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; emerged from the shadows, and &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt; led his army into the Highlands. The cult's members carved out a fortress in the heart of the region. Cho'gall named this stronghold the Bastion of Twilight and fashioned it into the cult's base of operations and a place for its members to worship their unseen gods. &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; energies gradually bled from the spire, creeping across the terrain, mutating all life beneath its shadow and warping the land.\nThe ravings of some of the cult's more vocal members have been easy to dismiss as mere fancy in the past - but not once one has seen the Bastion of Twilight, the embodiment of the Hammer's fascination with new forms and transcending earthly bodies. The entrance to the bastion sits at the peak of the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Citadel\"&gt;Twilight Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, atop a twisted &lt;a href=\"elementium\"&gt;elementium&lt;/a&gt; spire that points at the sky. Here, a &lt;a href=\"Instance%20portal\"&gt;portal&lt;/a&gt; waits to take the greatest Twilight aspirants... where? No one can say for certain.\nWhat is clear is that the Leader of the Twilight's Hammer, Cho'gall, directs his forces from this dread place. And, whatever the location, it is certain to be near to the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s who dwell beneath &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, and give fruit to the darkest dreams of the living.\nDuring the course of the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20Deathwing\"&gt;war against Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; invaded the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Highlands\"&gt;Twilight Highlands&lt;/a&gt; and the Bastion of Twilight. The stronghold's defenses crumbled and the Horde's greatest champions cut their way through the citadel where they managed to kill Cho'gall. With the death of Cho'gall and the fall of the bastion, the cult's strength was broken.\nDungeon Journal.\n\"The Bastion of Twilight stands as a dark symbol of the Old Gods' burgeoning power on Azeroth. Various branches of the Twilight's Hammer dwell deep beneath the towering form -- considered the cult's foremost command center -- along with their twisted leader, Cho'gall. There, he and his servants conspire to bring the Old Gods' apocalyptic visions to fruition by bleeding Azeroth of all sanity, hope and life.\"\nGeography.\nDespite the entrance portal being atop a tall spire, the Bastion of Twilight seemingly takes place deep underground, with lava seen in several places, and goes deeper and deeper as one progresses. It has a traditional, linear raid design.\nAfter some initial &lt;a href=\"Trash%20mob\"&gt;trash&lt;/a&gt; in the Bastion Antechamber, one finds &lt;a href=\"Halfus%20Wyrmbreaker\"&gt;Halfus Wyrmbreaker&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Proto-Behemoth\"&gt;Proto-Behemoth&lt;/a&gt; keeping watch over several enslaved &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;s in the Wyrmbreaker's Rookery. A long hallway filled with &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer%20clan\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; cultists stands between here and the Twilight Enclave, home to the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20dragonflight\"&gt;twilight dragons&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Valiona%20and%20Theralion\"&gt;Valiona and Theralion&lt;/a&gt;.\nFurther down one finds the &lt;a href=\"elemental%20ascendant\"&gt;elemental ascendant&lt;/a&gt;s under Cho'gall's leadership. Here, in the Sanctum of the Ascended, resides the &lt;a href=\"Ascendant%20Council\"&gt;Ascendant Council&lt;/a&gt;, which consists of representatives of fire, earth, water, and wind. Those adventurers brave enough to survive this encounter may challenge &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt; himself in the Throne of the Apocalypse.\nYet it seems there is more going on than meets the eye. After defeating Cho'gall on heroic mode, the floor drops out to reveal the massive Twilight Caverns, home to Lady &lt;a href=\"Sinestra%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Sinestra&lt;/a&gt;, consort of &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;. She is surrounded by twilight eggs and is sure to be one of the toughest encounters adventurers have yet faced.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

While on Pandaria, Vilnak'dor was very eager to please his &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; hosts: he wore mogu clothing tailored to fit his expansive girth, dyed his hair white and curled it in the mogu style, and seemingly even tried growing his fingernails into talons.\nWhen Khal'ak presented Vol'jin before him, Vilnak'dor was initially dismissive of Vol'jin to the point of asking why he shouldn't just kill Vol'jin right then and there. However, Vol'jin was quick to point out that doing so would ensure that the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear&lt;/a&gt; would never join the Zandalari and that the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; would be an open enemy of the Zandalari. The Darkspear chieftain was able to further tempt Vilnak'dor by pointing that out that he could, in fact, bring the Darkspear into the Zandalari where his king had failed. Despite pointing out that Vol'jin's status as a &lt;a href=\"shadow%20hunter\"&gt;shadow hunter&lt;/a&gt; and his own political assessment would be valuable to the Zandalari's efforts, Khal'ak privately informed Vol'jin that Vilnak'dor would quickly have Vol'jin eliminated after the Darkspear were brought into the fold and use forged documents to make himself or one of his puppets as the heir of the Darkspear. In turn, Vol'jin realized that should he accept the Zandalari, he knew that he would have to kill Vilnak'dor.\nHowever, both points turned moot when Vol'jin decided to reject the Zandalari and with the help of his allies escaped the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Isle of Thunder&lt;/a&gt;. Angered at Khal'ak for letting Vol'jin deceive her and trying to prevent &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Kao\"&gt;Warlord Kao&lt;/a&gt; from launching his own strike on the &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan\"&gt;Shado-Pan&lt;/a&gt;, since their destruction by the Mogu could make them question why they need Zandalari aid, Vilnak'dor decided that Khal'lak would lead a force of 500 to deal with the Shado-Pan once and for all. Before Khal'lak left, Vilnak'dor warned Khal'ak that Warlord Kao would see her as an enemy and would poison the Thunder King against her and if she didn't deliver the Shado-Pan and Vol'jin as promised, then he would deliver her own head to him.\nVilnak'dor was nowhere to be seen when the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and Horde assaulted the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Isle of Thunder&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nVilnak'dor led a mogu invasion of &lt;a href=\"Warport%20Rastari\"&gt;Warport Rastari&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt; alongside Warlord Kao, to claim territory the mogu had been promised by &lt;a href=\"Zul\"&gt;Zul&lt;/a&gt;. After Kao's death, Vilnak'dor revealed that the attack was only a distraction to keep the Zandalari warriors away from &lt;a href=\"Rastakhan\"&gt;Rastakhan&lt;/a&gt; as Zul began a coup.\nVilnak'dor was later killed by Rastakhan and a Horde &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Lair%20of%20Rezan\"&gt;Lair of Rezan&lt;/a&gt;, as he was attempting to drain &lt;a href=\"Rezan\"&gt;Rezan&lt;/a&gt;'s power for Zul, in the same way, the &lt;a href=\"Drakkari\"&gt;Drakkari&lt;/a&gt; once did to their loa.\nSpeculation.\nSince Khal'ak indicated that Vilnak'dor was a close advisor to Rastakhan, he may at one point have been a member of the &lt;a href=\"Zanchuli%20Council\"&gt;Zanchuli Council&lt;/a&gt;. If he was a member, his title of general likely means that he held the position that was later given to &lt;a href=\"General%20Jakra%27zet\"&gt;Jakra'zet&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; campaign. This may be why he went from being notably loyal to the king to eventually betraying him."}

The vessel would go on to take part in the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20Campaign\"&gt;Argus Campaign&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, in which it acted as headquarters for the mortal forces.\nThe ship can maintain instant connections to various nearby and distant locations at a given time through the use of &lt;a href=\"Lightforged%20beacon\"&gt;Lightforged beacon&lt;/a&gt;s. The \"Vindicaar\" is also equipped with powerful defensive shields, as well as offensive air-to-surface weaponry.\nCurrently, the \"Vindicaar\" has come under the control of the &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Army of the Light&lt;/a&gt;, who use the vessel as their primary base after the \"&lt;a href=\"Xenedar\"&gt;Xenedar&lt;/a&gt;\"'s destruction, and who have since joined the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nDevelopment.\nPreparations to make the \"Vindicaar\" operational first began immediately following the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Exodar\"&gt;Battle for the \"Exodar\"&lt;/a&gt;, during the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, when the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s led by &lt;a href=\"High%20General%20Rakeesh\"&gt;High General Rakeesh&lt;/a&gt; almost seized control of the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; capital. These efforts were ordered directly by &lt;a href=\"Prophet%20Velen\"&gt;Prophet Velen&lt;/a&gt;, and overseen and handled by &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Artificer%20Romuul\"&gt;Grand Artificer Romuul&lt;/a&gt;. The \"Exodar\" itself had long been crippled by the crash that brought the draenei to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; many years ago, and so its restoration was not an option.\nThe \"Vindicaar\"'s development would become a massive objective for the draenei. According to Velen himself: \"Every spare moment, every resource, has gone toward the birth of a new vessel.\" As it finally neared completion, the need for such a ship became dramatically apparent, as a rift in the skies above &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; opened and connected it to the demon planet of &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt; in the wake of &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;'s death. It was quickly decided that an all-out assault on Argus would be the key to finally bringing an end to the war against the Burning Legion, and that the \"Vindicaar\" would take the role of spearheading this attack. \nShadows of Argus.\nIn preparation for the journey to &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;, forces from across &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, including the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, converged on &lt;a href=\"Azuremyst%20Isle\"&gt;Azuremyst Isle&lt;/a&gt; to form an assault force. &lt;a href=\"%3ALight%27s%20Heart\"&gt;:Light's Heart&lt;/a&gt; was also brought on board the \"Vindicaar\" at this time, and many key figures such as &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Khadgar\"&gt;Archmage Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vereesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Vereesa Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt; and more arrived to take part in the coming campaign. The decided upon a plan of attack involved the \"Vindicaar\" rendezvousing with the &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Army of the Light&lt;/a&gt; on board the \"&lt;a href=\"Xenedar\"&gt;Xenedar&lt;/a&gt;\" upon reaching Argus itself, and from there launch a united offensive against &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;'s forces.\n, arriving above the region of &lt;a href=\"Krokuun\"&gt;Krokuun&lt;/a&gt; a short while later. Events quickly began to spiral out of control, however, as the \"Xenedar\", upon also arriving at the meeting point, was devastated by a barrage from heavy Legion artillery, and crashed into the Argussian landscape. Desperate to prevent the same from happening to the \"Vindicaar\", the forces on board launched an immediate assault on the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic positions below, ultimately succeeding in neutralizing their long-range artillery in the area. \nWith the ship temporarily safe from destruction, the mortal champions began to secure the area, foremost by reestablishing contact with the Army of the Light. Throughout the remainder of the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20Campaign\"&gt;Argus Campaign&lt;/a&gt;, the \"Vindicaar\" would serve as a mobile base and launching point for operations across Argus, eventually traveling to the &lt;a href=\"Antoran%20Wastes\"&gt;Antoran Wastes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Eredath\"&gt;Eredath&lt;/a&gt; regions. Early in the battle, the former main weapon from the \"Xenedar\" known as &lt;a href=\"%3ALight%27s%20Judgment%20%28item%29\"&gt;Light's Judgment&lt;/a&gt; was successfully salvaged and installed on the \"Vindicaar\", providing formidable firepower in the fight against the Legion.\nBattles and other operations would continue to be launched across Argus, and almost every base on the ground remained connected to the \"Vindicaar\" through various &lt;a href=\"Lightforged%20beacon\"&gt;Lightforged beacon&lt;/a&gt;s; using the &lt;a href=\"Navigation%20Console\"&gt;Navigation Console&lt;/a&gt; in the \"Vindicaar\" itself could allow instant travel to any such beacons anywhere on Argus. The vessel also rapidly became the home of the Army of the Light survivors, as well as elements of the &lt;a href=\"Argussian%20Reach\"&gt;Argussian Reach&lt;/a&gt; faction of &lt;a href=\"broken\"&gt;broken&lt;/a&gt;. \nAs the command ship for the invading mortal forces, the \"Vindicaar\" would come under heavy fire from Legion artillery in most locations on Argus (particularly the &lt;a href=\"Antoran%20Wastes\"&gt;Antoran Wastes&lt;/a&gt;) though its shields were able to prevent serious damage. In charge of maintaining these defenses, &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Artificer%20Romuul\"&gt;Grand Artificer Romuul&lt;/a&gt; also ordered the recovery of a specific variety of crystal from the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Argus%20Construct\"&gt;ancient constructs&lt;/a&gt; scattered around &lt;a href=\"Eredath\"&gt;Eredath&lt;/a&gt;, which were vital to these efforts.\n&lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt; and his allies would ultimately work to reassemble the ancient &lt;a href=\"eredar\"&gt;eredar&lt;/a&gt; artifact known as the &lt;a href=\"Crown%20of%20the%20Triumvirate\"&gt;Crown of the Triumvirate&lt;/a&gt;, believing its power to be vital in the Legion's defeat. Once all pieces were recovered and the relic restored in the \"Vindicaar\"'s bridge, , the old purple color of its hull replaced with a holy gold. At this stage, all was now prepared for the final assault on the Burning Legion's main base of &lt;a href=\"Antorus%2C%20the%20Burning%20Throne\"&gt;Antorus, the Burning Throne&lt;/a&gt;, and the last struggle to end &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;Crusade&lt;/a&gt;. \n&lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alleria\"&gt;Alleria&lt;/a&gt; would lead the main assault of the Army of the Light on the ground, while the \"Vindicaar\" itself provided fire support and transport from the skies above Antorus. Light's Judgement was notably used to force entry into some of the fortress's deeper reaches. Ultimately, the mortal &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;heroes&lt;/a&gt; would fight their way to the &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20the%20Pantheon\"&gt;Seat of the Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; located in the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;Great Dark Beyond&lt;/a&gt;, where they battled and defeated the &lt;a href=\"world-soul\"&gt;world-soul&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Argus%20the%20Unmaker\"&gt;Argus the Unmaker&lt;/a&gt;. All surviving victors (with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;) then , as the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Titan Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; united to permanently imprison Sargeras. \nFrom the vessel the mortals watched as the &lt;a href=\"dark%20titan\"&gt;dark titan&lt;/a&gt;, before being dragged to his prison, buried &lt;a href=\"Sword%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;his sword&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s surface, with the \"Vindicaar\" only narrowly avoiding his desperate grasp on its flight. Afterwards, with the threat of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; finally defeated, the mortals gathered on board to make closing remarks on the conflict.\nPost-Legion.\nIn the wake of the successful &lt;a href=\"Argus%20Campaign\"&gt;campaign&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;, the \"Vindicaar\" remained a base of operations for the &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Army of the Light&lt;/a&gt;. Though their quest to defeat the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt; was now over, the &lt;a href=\"Lightforged%20draenei\"&gt;Lightforged draenei&lt;/a&gt; of the ship continued to train new recruits (such as the ever-enthusiastic &lt;a href=\"T%27paartos\"&gt;T'paartos&lt;/a&gt;) and induct them into the army. Shortly before the commencement of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt; between the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"High%20Exarch%20Turalyon\"&gt;High Exarch Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; met with &lt;a href=\"King%20Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and the other Alliance leaders in the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Embassy\"&gt;Stormwind City Embassy&lt;/a&gt;.\nEager to once more aid his people, Turalyon pledged the loyalty of the Army of the Light, and by extension the \"Vindicaar\", to the Alliance cause. The Lightforged draenei too desired to join their cousins from Azeroth and entered the Alliance as one of its newest &lt;a href=\"Allied%20race\"&gt;allies&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Artificer%20Romuul\"&gt;Grand Artificer Romuul&lt;/a&gt; appeared to have remained on the vessel following the events on Argus, continuing to oversee its maintenance and upkeep, and while most of its other former NPCs, including most of its non-draenei champions and the Argussian Reach emissary, have left the vessel, several old NPCs, including &lt;a href=\"Tassia%20Whisperglen\"&gt;Tassia Whisperglen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thelbus%20Wimblenod\"&gt;Thelbus Wimblenod&lt;/a&gt;, have remained, and &lt;a href=\"Vigilant%20Quoram\"&gt;Vigilant Quoram&lt;/a&gt; has even apparently joined the ranks of the Lightforged.\nInconsistencies.\nMany character dialogues or gossip texts on the \"Vindicaar\" were originally in conflict with established lore, and erroneous. They were developer oversights, as some were confirmed to be and later fixed."}

The exact definition of vindicator remains unclear. While it is a generic title and profession, they are referred to as \"holy warriors of the Light\" and are counted as wielders of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;. However, the vindicators and paladins have been listed separately in the &lt;a href=\"Hand%20of%20Argus\"&gt;Hand of Argus&lt;/a&gt;. All leaders of the &lt;a href=\"Triumvirate%20of%20the%20Hand\"&gt;Triumvirate of the Hand&lt;/a&gt; have this title. &lt;a href=\"Paladin%20trainer\"&gt;Paladin trainer&lt;/a&gt;s in the \"&lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt;\" are based in the &lt;a href=\"Vindicators%27%20Sanctum\"&gt;Vindicators' Sanctum&lt;/a&gt;. Their weapons kept their razor sharp through the holy power contained within, while their shields are somehow magically maintained against attrition. The &lt;a href=\"Hammer%20of%20the%20Naaru\"&gt;Hammer of the Naaru&lt;/a&gt; is a Light-blessed crystalline weapon mainly used by the vindicators.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Thal%27kiel\"&gt;Thal'kiel&lt;/a&gt;'s whispers about &lt;a href=\"Talixae%20Flamewreath\"&gt;Talixae Flamewreath&lt;/a&gt;, the Vindicators existed on &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt; as a police force. On &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Akama\"&gt;Exarch Akama&lt;/a&gt; served as High Vindicator, leading a military order known as the Vindicators. They were the defenders of draenei society, standing as the primary guardians of &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt; during the orcish invasion.\nAmong the draenei's most elite warriors who followed the naaru &lt;a href=\"Xe%27ra\"&gt;Xe'ra&lt;/a&gt; to wage war on the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, many draenei vindicators were infused with the essence of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt; and became &lt;a href=\"Lightforged%20draenei\"&gt;Lightforged&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Army of the Light&lt;/a&gt;. Their armors are made of &lt;a href=\"Empyrium\"&gt;Empyrium&lt;/a&gt;, described as \"the finest material on Argus\", and are honed to protect them from the Legion's &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; magic.\nZandalari vindicators.\nVengeance is power, and the &lt;a href=\"Zandalar%20tribe\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt; vindicator is such power. The tribe has many enemies, and the vindicator exacts retribution on them. No crime against the Zandalari is unpunished, and the vindicator delivers this punishment. The vindicator's symbol of power is the breastplate, which is forged with powerful mojo. It is trusted only to those revered within the tribe and is the Zandalar symbol of vengeance; to become a vindicator is to become vengeance.\nIn Warcraft III.\nThe \"&lt;a href=\"Draenei%20Vindicator%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;draenei vindicator&lt;/a&gt;\" were heavy fighter units used by the &lt;a href=\"Lost%20One\"&gt;Lost One&lt;/a&gt;s in \"\". With normal draenei later seen using this title, it is possible that these may be former vindicators that were corrupted.\nIn the TCG.\nWhen law and justice are at odds, the Vindicators settle things.\nRPG class.\nIn the RPG, Vindicator is a &lt;a href=\"prestige%20class\"&gt;prestige class&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlthough vindicators may come from any race or culture, all vindicators share one thing in common: They harbor an unwavering desire to bring retribution upon those they deem deserving of punishment. Vindicators only avenge those things they have personally witnessed or otherwise hold irrefutable proof of the wrongs they are trying to right. Vindicators are fueled by a deep hatred, which usually comes from the loss of a loved one, the witnessing of a horrible crime or injustice, or sometimes great personal suffering experienced at some point in the past. Vindicators travel the world to punish those who have harmed others. Vindicators are stern and humorless loners, they are not the easiest persons to befriend, but once they call someone a comrade they go to great lengths to protect, or avenge him. Vindicators are driven by the need to bring what they call justice upon their enemies. They sometimes appear to be merciless zealots who would risk their lives and those of their friends to seek retribution. They may be intense and focused, but despite their ill-reputed, and seldom understood ideas of what is right and wrong, vindicators view themselves as indispensable tools of justice. Vindicators seldom respect society's laws, but are willing to work with whoever they need to complete their self-appointed task. Vindicators often take on the roles of vigilantes, imposing their unusual sense of justice on the people of their communities. While vindicators may be rash, their actions are never evil, nor do they consider the act of seeking revenge especially cruel. After all, it is the right thing to do.\nVindicators originate from the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; societies of olden days. Traditionally, vindicators remained close to their homelands to ensure that their special kind of justice was brought to their people's enemies. In ancient times, most vindicators focused their attention on creatures and groups that threatened the well-being of their people or the environment in which they lived. Today vindicators roam the world to punish those who harm it. Vindicators are sometimes fanatically righteous and perceived as perverted and cruel, they are misunderstood and mistrusted. Although vindicators would argue otherwise, those who meet a vindicator perceive the hatred that drives him as a force stronger than the individual who owns it. Thus, many people view vindicators as eerie, zealous individuals who cannot control their emotions. Though it is true that vindicators tolerate little frivolity, they draw strength from their inner rage and the power of their convictions. Those few individuals who call a vindicator friend understand this, and learn to respect those who are driven by this inner fire. Vindicators work best with people who share similar values. Most vindicators are relentless defenders of whatever noble cause they adopt, and they go to great lengths to bring their special brand of retribution upon those whom they consider enemies of that cause. Vindicators who reside in towns and cities are thorns in the sides of those who live off crime. They target &lt;a href=\"thief\"&gt;thieves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"assassin\"&gt;assassin&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"slaver\"&gt;slaver&lt;/a&gt;s, as well as anyone who makes a living by taking advantage of others. Vindicators are a various lot, but regardless of their pasts, they are heroic characters considered a blessing to those who are on their side, and a deadly threat to individuals whom they deem deserving of their wrath."}

After reading the journal that was brought to him, Vindicator Kuros ordered all trackers of Blood Watch to hunt down Mathis the Cruel and bring him back alive to be judged.\nWhen Matis the Cruel was taken unconscious to Blood Watch, the blood elf was sentenced to death by a hologram of &lt;a href=\"Prophet%20Velen\"&gt;Prophet Velen&lt;/a&gt; for his crimes of genocide against the draenei people. The Blood Knight began to insult Velen, declaring that he and his order did not serve the Light, but that it was the Light that served them. He ends up confessing to Kuros that they already knew everything about &lt;a href=\"O%27ros\"&gt;O'ros&lt;/a&gt;, and that they would also capture her to make her their slave, before expressing the sadistic pleasure he had felt torturing &lt;a href=\"Vindicator%20Saruan\"&gt;Saruan&lt;/a&gt;, and that he would have liked to continue until death as for all other draenei. It was upon hearing these words and &lt;a href=\"Blasphemy\"&gt;blasphemies&lt;/a&gt; that Kuros told Matis that it was his last breath before executing him with a single blow of his warhammer, bringing justice and revenge for his mentor. Present throughout the scene and the execution, Velen ordered Kuros to find their source of energy and destroy it.\nFollowing the plan of &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt;, with the Sun Gate who has been destroyed and Sironas and her &lt;a href=\"Sunhawk\"&gt;Sunhawk&lt;/a&gt;s were defeated; the Hand of Argus consequently prevented &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Kael%27thas\"&gt;Prince Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt; from invading &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; and corrupting the draenei into &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s.\nProphet's Lesson.\nAs a member of the &lt;a href=\"Triumvirate%20of%20the%20Hand\"&gt;Triumvirate of the Hand&lt;/a&gt;, Kuros is present during the meeting of the &lt;a href=\"Hand%20of%20Argus\"&gt;Hand of Argus&lt;/a&gt; to discuss their people's future on Azeroth in light of the \"&lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt;\"'s repair. With the Triumvirate, he agreed on the decision that, unless Velen ordered otherwise, within a week the \"Exodar\" would take flight for old Draenor to rebuild their second home on &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; and assist the &lt;a href=\"Lost%20One\"&gt;Lost One&lt;/a&gt;s remaining behind.\nHe is present when Velen himself emerged to quell the unrest between the Vindicators and the Alliance refugees, and announced the decision that the draenei and the \"Exodar\" would remain in Azeroth to combat the incoming threat with their allies of the Alliance.\nLegion.\nAfter the disaster at the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt; and the death of &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt;, Vindicator Kuros convenes with the leaders of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s other &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt; orders in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;.

When the draenei came under attack by the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s on &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, Maraad failed to protect his people as he became overcome by vengeance, a mistake that has haunted him since that day. After the draenei barely survived the orcs' attempt to exterminate them, they managed to flee and ended up on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. He became a wandering warrior of faith thereafter. His sister was the mother to the assassin &lt;a href=\"Garona%20Halforcen\"&gt;Garona Halforcen&lt;/a&gt;, whom Maraad continued to search for.\nAfter triumphing against evil in the &lt;a href=\"War%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;Northrend campaign&lt;/a&gt;, Maraad began instructing other races of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; in the ways of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;. His time facing the countless dangers of Azeroth left him prone to action above meditation, choosing to attack while others delayed. Maraad played a significant role in the campaign on &lt;a href=\"Draenor%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;alternate Draenor&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt;, seeking redemption for his past failures by preventing the atrocities of his tragic past from happening again. He was eventually killed by during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Shattrath\"&gt;Battle for Shattrath&lt;/a&gt; while protecting &lt;a href=\"Yrel\"&gt;Yrel&lt;/a&gt; with the last of his power.\nBiography.\nA resolute soldier, Vindicator Maraad fought in many wars. He defended the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; as they evaded the demonic army of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; across countless worlds. As a paladin of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;, Maraad epitomized the strong arm of righteousness. His weapon, the &lt;a href=\"%3AHammer%20of%20the%20Naaru\"&gt;:Hammer of the Naaru&lt;/a&gt;, meted out punishment to anyone who threatened his kind. He vowed to protect the innocent.\nDraenor.\nWhile living on Draenor prior to it becoming Outland, Maraad spent much time in Shadowmoon Valley, especially around the area of &lt;a href=\"Elodor\"&gt;Elodor&lt;/a&gt;. He was also knowledgeable of the potential dangers of &lt;a href=\"Gorgrond\"&gt;Gorgrond&lt;/a&gt;'s primordial jungle.\nMaraad was a member of the Vindicators and one of the greatest followers of &lt;a href=\"Akama\"&gt;Akama&lt;/a&gt;. He and &lt;a href=\"Nobundo\"&gt;Nobundo&lt;/a&gt; participated in the fights against &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s that were marching on &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt;. They found and killed &lt;a href=\"Hok%27lon\"&gt;Hok'lon&lt;/a&gt; and his generals, leaving the ogre forces in disarray. Rather than slaughter their foes, the draenei then immediately returned to Shattrath.\nSome time after the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Orcish Horde&lt;/a&gt; was formed, his sister &lt;a href=\"Leran\"&gt;Leran&lt;/a&gt; was captured by orcs of the &lt;a href=\"Bladewind%20clan\"&gt;Bladewind clan&lt;/a&gt;. Draenei scouts reported the Bladewind sacrificing their prisoners in gruesome rituals to appease the elements and Maraad urged the draenei to save the prisoners, his sister included. He led the assault on the Bladewind, but by the time they arrived, Leran and the others were dead. The sight of his sister's body sent Maraad into a rage and he rampaged through the village. Unbeknownst to Maraad at the time, Leran had given birth to a daughter, his niece &lt;a href=\"Garona%20Halforcen\"&gt;Garona&lt;/a&gt;, before her death.\nMaraad was at the siege of Shattrath, the battle where the orcs destroyed the draenei capital. When &lt;a href=\"Larohir\"&gt;Exarch Larohir&lt;/a&gt; told Maraad to take &lt;a href=\"refugee\"&gt;refugee&lt;/a&gt;s to safety, he did so. However, the sight of an orc within reach convinced Maraad to go after him instead. He told the refugees to take a path out of the city, assuring them that it was safe and that the Light was with them. Maraad managed to slay the orc, breaking his weapon in his rage, but when he went to return to the refugees he discovered that the passage had \"not\" been safe, and they were all dead\u2014slaughtered by the Horde. He has sought vengeance against the orcs ever since.\nAt some point, Maraad used to meet with the &lt;a href=\"Triumvirate%20of%20the%20Hand\"&gt;Triumvirate of the Hand&lt;/a&gt; and sit in council with the draenei leadership.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nMaraad was confirmed during &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon\"&gt;BlizzCon&lt;/a&gt; 2013 to be the draenei seen in the &lt;a href=\"The%20Dark%20Portal%20%28cinematic%29\"&gt;\"Burning Crusade\" cinematic&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorld of Warcraft: The Comic.\nMaraad never abandoned his sister's memory. He discovered the existence of his niece - the assassin &lt;a href=\"Garona%20Halforcen\"&gt;Garona Halforcen&lt;/a&gt; - and began his search for her that lasted years. During his search, Maraad eventually met and befriended &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;, likely before the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; was reopened. Meeting Khadgar allowed him to fill in his knowledge of what happened to Garona after she left Draenor through the Dark Portal and up until the end of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;. Led by a vision, he traveled to Kalimdor.\nMaraad secretly rescued &lt;a href=\"Garona\"&gt;Garona&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt;, and at the entrance of &lt;a href=\"Onyxia%27s%20Lair\"&gt;Onyxia's Lair&lt;/a&gt; revealed that he is Garona's uncle and therefore &lt;a href=\"Med%27an\"&gt;Med'an&lt;/a&gt;'s great uncle. He explained to her that &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; had bred his sister to one of his warriors (which, considering orcish/draenei relations at the time, implies rape), which resulted in Garona's birth. Garona resolved to go and kill &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt; and left him while &lt;a href=\"Valeera%20Sanguinar\"&gt;Valeera Sanguinar&lt;/a&gt; started battling with the draenei. They were stopped by Med'an who teleported them back to Theramore. He has now become a founding member of the &lt;a href=\"New%20Council%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;New Council of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt; and began to teach Med'an the ways of the Light. He helped to defend Theramore against Cho'gall's dark minions and decided to take Med'an to Outland to be beyond the reach of the Old Gods. When he introduced Med'an to Khadgar, the &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; greeted each other as old friends. Maraad asked Khadgar to join the new Council of Tirisfal but refused and in his stead sent &lt;a href=\"Dalynnia%20Wrathscar\"&gt;Dalynnia Wrathscar&lt;/a&gt;. After they returned, they joined the final attack on Cho'gall granting his power to Med'an. He was last seen at the funeral of &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt; and took Med'an to further his training.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nMaraad was stationed aboard the \"&lt;a href=\"Skybreaker\"&gt;Skybreaker&lt;/a&gt;\" which is flying above &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt; and served as a Vindicator in the &lt;a href=\"Valiance%20Expedition\"&gt;Valiance Expedition&lt;/a&gt;.\nProphet's Lesson.\nComing home from his tour of duty in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, Vindicator Maraad was surprised to learn both that human refugees from the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; were camped outside the \"&lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt;\", and that &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt; had refused to meet with anyone in weeks. When it was revealed in a meeting with the &lt;a href=\"Triumvirate%20of%20the%20Hand\"&gt;Triumvirate of the Hand&lt;/a&gt; that the \"Exodar\" was nearly repaired, Maraad decided that if Velen would not lead them, then it was up to them to decide what to do: take the fight to the Legion, return to Outland, or stay on Azeroth. It was agreed that if Velen did not speak to them within the week, then they would leave Azeroth.\nWhen the refugees began rioting and seriously injured &lt;a href=\"Romnar\"&gt;Vindicator Romnar&lt;/a&gt;, Maraad and the other vindicators were forced to use deadly force to defend themselves. When Velen appeared to stop the battle, Maraad told him about their ultimatum. Velen told them that war was everywhere, and they were needed on Azeroth. Deeply moved, Maraad went to heal the refugees with the other draenei. Dedicated to the draenei and under the will of his Prophet, he remained in the \"Exodar\" until the events of Pandaria's invasion.\nThe Untamed Valley.\nShortly after the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, Maraad and Sentinel Commander &lt;a href=\"Lyalia\"&gt;Lyalia&lt;/a&gt; teamed up in &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; where they were hired by the &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan\"&gt;Shado-Pan&lt;/a&gt; to transport an orc war criminal called &lt;a href=\"Mashok\"&gt;Mashok&lt;/a&gt; across the continent to &lt;a href=\"Lion%27s%20Landing\"&gt;Lion's Landing&lt;/a&gt;. Their journey would eventually lead them to camp on &lt;a href=\"Haohan%20Mudclaw\"&gt;Haohan Mudclaw&lt;/a&gt;'s field. Noticing them, the virmen came out of their tunnel and offered them axles for carrots. Maraad refused for he had none. At that moment, the virmen started attacking. Luckily for them Haohan Mudclaw and &lt;a href=\"Mung-Mung\"&gt;Mung-Mung&lt;/a&gt; came to their rescue. After accepting to stay at Haohan's house, the three moved into the cellar for the night. Sometime after, the dark shamans tracked them down and came to rescue their leader Mashok. A group of &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Hellscream's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"True%20Horde\"&gt;loyalists&lt;/a&gt; caught up with them, but Maraad and Lyalia received aid from several members of the &lt;a href=\"Tillers\"&gt;Tillers&lt;/a&gt; (including &lt;a href=\"Farmer%20Fung\"&gt;Farmer Fung&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Old%20Hillpaw\"&gt;Old Hillpaw&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gina%20Mudclaw\"&gt;Gina Mudclaw&lt;/a&gt;, Mung-Mung and Haohan Mudclaw himself). To keep the prisoner secure, Maraad took the orc back down in the cellar and closed the doors behind him. The two entered in a deadly struggle, with Maraad trying to keep the orc from moving. Upstairs, the last living shaman &lt;a href=\"Zertin\"&gt;Zertin&lt;/a&gt; was able to trick the farmers and distracted Maraad long enough for Mashok to grab a hold of the elements. The paladin ran outside to warn the others of the prisoner's escape but to no avail. Mashok rooted everyone who opposed him, promising them that their land will burn. It all looked lost until Farmer Fung asked him if carrots will grow, to which he replied no. Then out of nowhere, the virmen all rose up from the ground and came to the conclusion that if the farmers die, there'd be no more carrots. The Vindicator asked Haohan Mudclaw to spare him and he agreed. In the morning, he healed everyone and is later seen on Haohan's cart taking the prisoner to his final destination, Lion's Landing.\nLords of War.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt; began its march on Azeroth, Maraad met with &lt;a href=\"King%20Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, who was not certain he could defeat what was essentially the same threat that killed his &lt;a href=\"Llane%20Wrynn\"&gt;father&lt;/a&gt; and destroyed the kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; many years prior. Maraad urged Varian to sign the declaration of war on the Iron Horde, but Varian was lost in doubt. Maraad told Varian that he had faced the warlords before, and that they were not invincible. He proceeded to tell the king about the histories of several warlords: &lt;a href=\"Kargath%20Bladefist\"&gt;Kargath Bladefist&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grommash Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kilrogg%20Deadeye\"&gt;Kilrogg Deadeye&lt;/a&gt;. He also told him of an opposing view to the others; &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;'s father, &lt;a href=\"Durotan\"&gt;Durotan&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the end, Maraad told Varian about the battle of Shattrath in which he participated and how he failed the refugees he had to protect. Varian, convinced, signed the declaration and Maraad was the first to answer the call to war in order to prevent the atrocities he had witnessed from happening again.\nThe Iron Tide.\nWhen the Dark Portal turned red, Maraad helped to stop the &lt;a href=\"Ironmarch\"&gt;Ironmarch&lt;/a&gt; invasion of the &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt; and was located at the &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Beachhead\"&gt;Shattered Beachhead&lt;/a&gt; along with the Alliance army. He sent adventurers to eliminate the Iron Horde numbers and their machinery. Later on, he moved behind enemy lines with &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Vines\"&gt;Commander Vines&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Enohar%20Thunderbrew\"&gt;Enohar Thunderbrew&lt;/a&gt; and a small Alliance army. They began pushing the Iron Horde in the ruins of Nethergarde back; and he also had the new ruler of the &lt;a href=\"Dreadmaul\"&gt;Dreadmaul&lt;/a&gt; ogres \u2014 who had allied with the Iron Horde \u2014 killed. He ultimately assisted the adventurers in killing one of the &lt;a href=\"Ironmarch\"&gt;Ironmarch&lt;/a&gt;'s leaders \u2014 &lt;a href=\"Gar%27mak%20Bladetwist\"&gt;Gar'mak Bladetwist&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 who was holed up in &lt;a href=\"Okril%27lon%20Hold\"&gt;Okril'lon Hold&lt;/a&gt;. Afterward, he sent a report to King Wrynn while he stayed there and continued the war effort.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nMaraad agreed to help lead the forces of the noble Alliance as they stood against the impending invasion. Now, Maraad has a chance to come to terms with the tragedy of his past. He intends to fulfill his vow, not only to save the innocent, but also to execute vengeance on everyone who caused him and his people so much heartache.\nAssault on the Dark Portal.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Assault%20on%20the%20Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Assault on the Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, Maraad was a part of the unified Alliance and Horde squad tasked with destroying the in &lt;a href=\"Tanaan%20Jungle\"&gt;Tanaan Jungle&lt;/a&gt;. He and &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; were the first to enter the alternate . When the adventurers were shutting down the Portal, he defended the group with the force of the Light. Once the Portal was deactivated, he accompanied the archmage and his group through the orc camps in the eastern part of Tanaan. Once the group left the Umbral Halls, he armed the freed draenei and went to fight the Blackrock orcs and eventually the rest of the Iron Horde under the Worldbreaker. When the Dark Portal was destroyed, Maraad, &lt;a href=\"Yrel\"&gt;Yrel&lt;/a&gt; and the freed draenei left Tanaan on the Iron Horde's ships.\nShadowmoon Valley.\nOnce they arrived to , they were greeted by Prophet who took them to the place called Lunarfall. Maraad said that before they entered Draenor, King Varian suggested that the adventurer should lead the campaign on the savage world. Now, Maraad acknowledged Varian's words and the adventurer as the commander. Once the base of Alliance Garrison was established, he directed the commander to a nearby threat of the pale orcs on the north where &lt;a href=\"Qiana%20Moonshadow\"&gt;Qiana Moonshadow&lt;/a&gt; happened to be. When the two returned, Maraad suggested that Qiana becomes the first follower in the Garrison. When the Garrison was established, Maraad made an arrangement with &lt;a href=\"Exarch%20Akama\"&gt;Akama&lt;/a&gt; to supply laborers for the harvest at &lt;a href=\"Elodor\"&gt;Elodor&lt;/a&gt;'s fields in exchange for food supplies. Both of them escorted Alliance workers to the area, but his wagon got left behind in the woods. When Akama and the commander found him, he explained that they were attacked by the . Akama stayed to fend off the attackers while the laborers were escorted to Elodor, where Akama caught up.\nAs Akama believed that the orcs would not be foolish enough to attack fortified cities, Maraad explained that the orcish threat was not to be taken lightly and asked to speak with the &lt;a href=\"Exarch%20Council\"&gt;Exarch Council&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Exarch%20Othaar\"&gt;Exarch Othaar&lt;/a&gt; agreed with hearing the Alliance's plea concerning the Iron Horde but the meeting needed all the members. and were found and brought by the commander while and Akama were brought by Maraad. However, as soon as they got together, Hataaru was killed and a traitor was among them. Maraad stayed by them until the betrayal of Exarch Othaar was revealed and the draenei promised to help the Alliance.\nAfterwards, the vindicator started dealing with the attack on the Shadowmoon clan. He apparently battled Ner'zhul who gravely wounded him. Shortly before the attack on &lt;a href=\"Karabor\"&gt;Karabor&lt;/a&gt;, he went to &lt;a href=\"Embaari%20Village\"&gt;Embaari Village&lt;/a&gt;, where he met with Yrel and Velen who went to confront . After Velen's purified Ner'zhul's Dark Star back into naaru and his subsequent death, the Iron Horde attacked Karabor and destroyed its defense crystal. Maraad flew to Yrel and told her about the attack and suggested to flee but she was eager to defend the temple. Vindicator thus suggested the commander to use the troops of the Garrison while they will lead them from above. Riding the fey dragons, they fend off the orcs, and eventually Karabor was secured. Victorious, Yrel and Maraad returned to Embaari and announced success.\nFour days after arrival onsite, Maraad visited &lt;a href=\"Admiral%20Taylor%27s%20Garrison\"&gt;Admiral Taylor's Garrison&lt;/a&gt; and suggested that &lt;a href=\"Taylor\"&gt;Taylor&lt;/a&gt; send laborers to Elodor to acquire food. Taylor turned him down. Maraad was also in contact with &lt;a href=\"Wrynn%27s%20Vanguard\"&gt;Wrynn's Vanguard&lt;/a&gt; forces on &lt;a href=\"Ashran\"&gt;Ashran&lt;/a&gt;.\nGorgrond.\nLater he and Yrel agreed to sent an expedition to &lt;a href=\"Gorgrond\"&gt;Gorgrond&lt;/a&gt; in order to gain its secret that could be used against the Iron Horde. He becomes gradually driven by anger and vengeance as the campaign progresses through Gorgrond. With &lt;a href=\"Thaelin%20Darkanvil\"&gt;Thaelin Darkanvil&lt;/a&gt; they established an outpost - &lt;a href=\"Highpass\"&gt;Highpass&lt;/a&gt;. From there Maraad sent &lt;a href=\"Rangari%20Erdanii\"&gt;Rangari Erdanii&lt;/a&gt; to deal with the threat of the Breakers on the north. Not long after, he sent the commander to assist her. Erdanii told the commander that she sees a danger fire in Maraad's eyes. Erdanii was successful in her mission and with the help of &lt;a href=\"Rexxar%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; she retrieved the artifact &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Magnaron\"&gt;Heart of Magnaron&lt;/a&gt;. In the meantime, Yrel and her group of Rangari managed to get &lt;a href=\"Will%20of%20the%20Genesaur\"&gt;Will of the Genesaur&lt;/a&gt; and both were sent to Maraad. When the artifacts were secured, the vindicator sent the Alliance and their allies to the north in order to attack a camp near the Iron Dock, which was a successful attempt. The commander on his journey stumbled upon savage beasts which he killed. Their trophies were brought to Maraad.\nTalador.\nSome time later ships of the Iron Horde arrived to &lt;a href=\"Talador\"&gt;Talador&lt;/a&gt;. Agent &lt;a href=\"Bodrick%20Grey\"&gt;Bodrick Grey&lt;/a&gt; sent Maraad a message and the vindicator sent the commander back to Garrison. From there the commander was sent to an Alliance camp stationed by Yrel, Maraad, and Thaelin. Maraad was distrustful of Thaelin's inventions but those spotted an army led by Orgrim Doomhammer. The vindicator said that draenei should have wiped the orcs when they landed on Draenor. On his orders were the numbers of orcs reduced and he had their cannon, &lt;a href=\"Dreadpiston\"&gt;Dreadpiston&lt;/a&gt;, destroyed. When the orcish army in Tuurem was annihilated, Maraad joined Khadgar before Shattrath and began planning their counter-attack. Maraad claimed that nothing will stop him from saving Shattrath. Soon after the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Shattrath\"&gt;attack began&lt;/a&gt;, Maraad was among the defenders. In the harbor he joined the attack on Warlord who eventually mortally wounded him. He ultimately meets his demise, defending Yrel with the last remnants of his powers and with the words \"In the light, we are one\". Maraad died saving the city he failed to save before. His body was eventually teleported by Khadgar back on the ground.\nWhile she had been using a mace and shield as a new paladin, Yrel took up Maraad's Hammer as her own from then on.\nTrial of Faith.\nMaraad was cremated and his ashes were put into . He is ultimately seen as a &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20of%20Maraad\"&gt;ghost&lt;/a&gt; in Auchindoun while Yrel undertakes her trials for the Exarch Council. She battles against him and when he is defeated he acknowledges that she is ready and bids her farewell.\nQuotes.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nShattered Beachhead.\nAzeroth has been invaded by a vicious enemy that seems bent on world domination. \nWe must act quickly if we are to put a stop to the chaos that is unfolding around us.\nEmbaari Village.\nNow it is time to drive them out of Shadowmoon once and for all.\nGorgrond.\nThe Iron Horde is a plague upon this land!\nTalador.\nI will stop at noting to prevent Shattrath from falling again.

He was the master, teacher and mentor of &lt;a href=\"Vindicator%20Kuros\"&gt;Vindicator Kuros&lt;/a&gt;, who took Saruan's place in the Triumvirate after the vindicator vanished and the search for him was abandoned.\nDuring a patrol, Saruan was captured by the &lt;a href=\"Sunhawk\"&gt;Sunhawk&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; and subjected to harsh torture at the hands of &lt;a href=\"Matis%20the%20Cruel\"&gt;Matis the Cruel&lt;/a&gt;. Matis beat the vindicator repeatedly until he lost consciousness, at which point the elf attempted to wake him by splashing contagion laced water across his ravaged body, but Saruan did not wake. Saruan's fellow captive &lt;a href=\"Galaen%27s%20Corpse\"&gt;Galaen&lt;/a&gt;, who witnessed the torture and was killed by the elves shortly afterwards, wrote in his journal that Matis seemed visibly concerned that Saruan had perished in the beatings; apparently, Matis' superior, the &lt;a href=\"eredar\"&gt;eredar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sironas\"&gt;Sironas&lt;/a&gt;, had special plans for the vindicator and would \"flay the flesh from [Matis'] bones\" if he killed the draenei.\nWhen Matis was later captured by the draenei of Blood Watch, he claimed that Saruan had wept like a babe as he was beaten, and that were it not for Sironas' plans for the draenei, Matis would have tortured him to death the same way he did to all draenei he captured. Before being killed by Vindicator Kuros, the blood elf mentioned that he was certain the draenei would see Saruan again soon. Later, a draenei &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; magically disguised as a blood elf interrogated a captured Sunhawk agent held in a cage at Blood Watch. The agent claimed that Sironas had transformed a high-ranking member of the Triumvirate into a &lt;a href=\"Eredar%23Demonic%20eredar\"&gt;man'ari&lt;/a&gt; abomination, described as \"massive, powerful, and full of rage\". The agent further claimed that any attacks against the &lt;a href=\"Vector%20Coil\"&gt;Vector Coil&lt;/a&gt; would most certainly fail as long as the abomination was present, and that Sironas and her creation would clean up whatever the Sunhawk forces left behind of the draenei. However, the abomination never made an appearance."}

As a result, Sedai's Corpse can be found at the &lt;a href=\"Mag%27har%20Grounds\"&gt;Mag'har Grounds&lt;/a&gt; by Alliance &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s.\nHe was described by his brother as an idealist.\nBackground.\nSedai left the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Telhamat\"&gt;Temple of Telhamat&lt;/a&gt; to try to negotiate peace with the orcs of the nearby &lt;a href=\"Mag%27har%20Post\"&gt;Mag'har Post&lt;/a&gt;. His brother, &lt;a href=\"Anchorite%20Obadei\"&gt;Anchorite Obadei&lt;/a&gt;, began to worry when Sedai didn't return for some time, so he sent an adventurer to find him. They discovered Sedai's corpse and delivered the bad news to Obadei.\n&lt;a href=\"Makuru\"&gt;Makuru&lt;/a&gt; was enraged at Sedai's death and asked the adventurer to enact vengeance by killing several Mag'har grunts. Anchorite Obadei chastised Makuru, as this went against Sedai's ideals. Wanting to shed some light on the situation, Obadei sent the adventurer to &lt;a href=\"Amaan%20the%20Wise\"&gt;Amaan the Wise&lt;/a&gt;.\nAmaan lent the adventurer an item called the &lt;a href=\"%3ASeer%27s%20Relic\"&gt;:Seer's Relic&lt;/a&gt; and asked them to return to Sedai's corpse with it. Though the relic didn't have the power to reveal the past, it could grant a vision showing a likely series of events. In this vision, Sedai was escorted from the village by two &lt;a href=\"Mag%27har%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Mag'har&lt;/a&gt; orc guards, who swore they'd kill him if he ever came back. He lamented that peace was impossible. As the orcs turned to head back to their village, a pair of &lt;a href=\"fel%20orc\"&gt;fel orc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Laughing%20Skull%20Ambusher\"&gt;Laughing Skull Ambusher&lt;/a&gt;s attacked. The ambushers killed one of the Mag'har orcs, but Sedai was able to help the other fight them off. Victory was short-lived, however; as Sedai knelt before the Mag'har orc's corpse and wondered if there was anything he could do to stop the cycle of bloodshed, &lt;a href=\"Krun%20Spinebreaker\"&gt;Krun Spinebreaker&lt;/a&gt; appeared and finished off both Sedai and the other Mag'har orc.\nIt's unknown if the events shown in the vision are what really happened, but Amaan hoped that it might lead the adventurer to consider other possibilities, rather than making an assumption and believing it the truth.\nSpeculation.\nWhilst unstated, the unusual hostility of the Mag'har in the vision could've been due to the &lt;a href=\"Murkblood%20tribe\"&gt;Murkblood tribe&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Broken\"&gt;Broken&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; massacring the Mag'har town of &lt;a href=\"Sunspring%20Post\"&gt;Sunspring&lt;/a&gt;."}

They are highly territorial, and alphas will vie to become dominant over one of &lt;a href=\"Bastion\"&gt;Bastion&lt;/a&gt;'s many hills, fending off all who tread near. Far deadlier foes than lions, their wings allow them to chase prey with unparalleled precision, and their massive claws and teeth take care of the rest. Long ago, &lt;a href=\"kyrian\"&gt;kyrian&lt;/a&gt; aspirants trained against these creatures, before the advent of the &lt;a href=\"centurion\"&gt;centurion&lt;/a&gt;s. While effective, it is not recommended to attempt to stop a larion mid-attack, as it would most likely result in death. Should one encounter a larion, it is suggested they appreciate it from a safe distance.\nLarions spend much of their lives airborne. Being social creatures, they bond through hunting and will not eat without their pride. They also need to chew in order to keep their teeth sharp and healthy; some like chewing on &lt;a href=\"cloudstrider\"&gt;cloudstrider&lt;/a&gt; antlers. Larions can become destructive if they don't get proper things to chew on. Young tamed larions enjoy kyrian-made toys such as balls and squeakers.\nEarning the trust of a larion is no easy feat, since they are particular, noble, and stubborn creatures.\nAs a hunter pet.\nLarions are tamable by &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s as part of the &lt;a href=\"Feathermane\"&gt;Feathermane&lt;/a&gt; family.

He says that one of his men is participating in the match.\nWhen Velen wanted to completely abandon &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt;, last holdout of the draenei, Larohir was the one to convince him otherwise. The exarch knew enough draenei had chosen to stay behind, to be slaughtered in the defense of the city and its people; and if the Orcs (and more importantly Kil'jaeden) weren't convinced they had wiped the draenei out, they would never stop hunting them. Velen reluctantly agreed and left Larohir to lead the defenses during the Siege of Shattrath. &lt;a href=\"Farseer%20Nobundo\"&gt;Vindicator Nobundo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vindicator%20Maraad\"&gt;Vindicator Maraad&lt;/a&gt; were among those who volunteered to stay behind under the exarch's command.\nOnce the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;demonically-fueled Horde&lt;/a&gt; had breached their gates, Larohir ordered Maraad to take the last group of refugees and see them safely out of the city. Even as Shattrath burned and crumbled around him, Larohir would not yield its defense. The exarch fought on so others could escape; he is presumed to be dead.\nSpeculation.\nGiven his title, he was probably a member of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Exarchs\"&gt;Council of Exarchs&lt;/a&gt;.

He is almost always accompanied by his giant &lt;a href=\"eagle\"&gt;eagle&lt;/a&gt; mount, &lt;a href=\"Aviash\"&gt;Aviash&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike his fellow chieftains, Lasan is a boisterous and jolly individual. He enjoys flying as much as a good fight. Lasan and his tribe regularly clash with the &lt;a href=\"Harpy\"&gt;harpies&lt;/a&gt; of Highmountain.\nBiography.\nA Mountain Divided.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; returned to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spiritwalker%20Ebonhorn\"&gt;Spiritwalker Ebonhorn&lt;/a&gt; called a meeting between the leaders of the tauren tribes \u2014 &lt;a href=\"Ulan%20Highmountain\"&gt;Ulan Highmountain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jale%20Rivermane\"&gt;Jale Rivermane&lt;/a&gt;, Lasan Skyhorn and &lt;a href=\"Torok%20Bloodtotem\"&gt;Torok Bloodtotem&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 as well as the &lt;a href=\"Underking\"&gt;Underking&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"drogbar\"&gt;drogbar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dargrul\"&gt;Dargrul&lt;/a&gt;. Like Torok, Jale and Dargrul, Lasan was shocked at Ebonhorn's revelation that according to the spirits, the power of the hammer would be wielded against the Legion by an outsider rather than a native of Highmountain, but he nonetheless agreed to obey the spirits at High Chieftain Ulan's command. After Dargrul stole the hammer and used it to kill Ulan, Lasan told Ulan's daughter, &lt;a href=\"Mayla%20Highmountain\"&gt;Mayla&lt;/a&gt;, that the Skymane could not spare anyone to hunt him down, as there was nothing they could do against the power of the hammer. As the drogbar would use the hammer against the tauren villages, the chieftains had to defend their own lands from the assault, and so Lasan was forced to depart from &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Totem\"&gt;Thunder Totem&lt;/a&gt; along with Torok and Jale.\nLegion.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Riverbend\"&gt;Riverbend&lt;/a&gt; is destroyed by Dargrul, the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; is sent by High Chieftain Mayla to assist the Skyhorn tribe. Upon arriving at &lt;a href=\"Skyhorn\"&gt;Skyhorn&lt;/a&gt;, which is under attack by &lt;a href=\"harpy\"&gt;harpies&lt;/a&gt;, Lasan informs them that the drogbar are not the only threat to Highmountain and that he will not send forces to support Mayla until &lt;a href=\"High%20Crawliac\"&gt;High Crawliac&lt;/a&gt;, the queen of the harpies, has been dealt with. After helping secure Skyhorn from the immediate harpy threat, the adventurer, Lasan, and his eagle riders head into the &lt;a href=\"Haglands\"&gt;Haglands&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 the heart of High Crawliac's domain. After culling a sufficient amount of the Haglands' defenders, including High Crawliac's three highest-ranking lieutenants, the champion assaults the Witchqueen's throne with the aid of the Skyhorn chieftain. Impressed by the adventurer's prowess, Lasan names them \"Skyfriend\" and agrees to travel to Thunder Totem to once again declare his allegiance to Mayla.\nLasan and his eagle riders later participate in the battle against Dargrul's forces at &lt;a href=\"Snowblind%20Mesa\"&gt;Snowblind Mesa&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegionfall.\nDuring the campaign of the &lt;a href=\"Armies%20of%20Legionfall\"&gt;Armies of Legionfall&lt;/a&gt;, a jovial Lasan led his &lt;a href=\"Skyhorn%20Interceptor\"&gt;Skyhorn Interceptors&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"War%20Eagle\"&gt;War Eagles&lt;/a&gt; into battle against the demons at the foot of the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, giving &lt;a href=\"Mayla%20Highmountain\"&gt;Mayla Highmountain's&lt;/a&gt; ground assault covering fire.\nHe also participated in the &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Assaults\"&gt;Legion Assaults&lt;/a&gt; directing the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;class order leaders&lt;/a&gt;.\nLasan Skyhorn was one of the &lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20tauren\"&gt;Highmountain tauren&lt;/a&gt; that traveled to &lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20Summit\"&gt;Highmountain Summit&lt;/a&gt; in order to thwart the &lt;a href=\"Necrodark\"&gt;Necrodark&lt;/a&gt;'s ritual to incarnate &lt;a href=\"Uul%27gyneth\"&gt;Uul'gyneth&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nLasan and his eagles arrived to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; in order to aid his new Horde allies in freeing &lt;a href=\"Talanji\"&gt;Talanji&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zul\"&gt;Zul&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;'s dungeons. He provided transport. When the infiltrators and prisoners managed to escape throughout the city to the Harbor, Lasan and his eagles attacked a group of Alliance army stationed there, grabbing them into the air. He and his eagles then landed on Talanji's ship. Following the arrival of the &lt;a href=\"Banshee%27s%20Wail\"&gt;Banshee's Wail&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt;, Lasan resides on the ship, where he expresses his belief that he and &lt;a href=\"Aviash\"&gt;Aviash&lt;/a&gt; could beat the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Empire\"&gt;Zandalari Empire&lt;/a&gt;'s best riders in a race and fight.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Faction%20Assault%20on%20Vol%27dun\"&gt;Faction Assault on Vol'dun&lt;/a&gt;, he provided agents of the Horde the use of Aviash so they may reach the Alliance airship commanded by &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Granger\"&gt;Captain Granger&lt;/a&gt; and assigns them the task of tearing it apart from the inside, while he rains death from above. Following the captain's death and the destruction of the airship, Lasan declared that the skies belong to the Horde.\nDragonflight.\nLasan joined the &lt;a href=\"Dragonscale%20Expedition\"&gt;Dragonscale Expedition&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt; and visited the &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Shikaar\"&gt;Clan Shikaar&lt;/a&gt; section of &lt;a href=\"Maruukai\"&gt;Maruukai&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Ohn%27ahran%20Plains\"&gt;Ohn'ahran Plains&lt;/a&gt;. While acknowledging the wariness that his friends from &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; had against the &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt;, Lasan paid them no mind as he felt that any friend of the birds was a friend of his.\nQuotes.\nDragonflight.\nMy Kalimdor friends seemed wary of the centaur, but I paid them no mind. Any friend of the birds is a friend of mine!\n&lt;Lasan lets out a belly laughs.&gt;"}

This unique group must summon the strength to face insurmountable odds \u2014 but at what cost?\nPlot.\nIn the hills above &lt;a href=\"Thandol%20Span\"&gt;Thandol Span&lt;/a&gt;, Lo'Gosh and Thargas fight their way through a group of Dark Iron dwarves, eventually killing all of them except one. Thargas demands to know where Hjalmar is. The Dark Iron replies that &lt;a href=\"Balgaras%20the%20Foul\"&gt;Balgaras the Foul&lt;/a&gt; is holding the elder Anvilmar captive at Thandol Span, which Thargas initially doesn't believe; last he heard, the Dark Irons tried and failed to destroy the bridge and the span was left in &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; hands. The Dark Iron reveals that his kind have retaken the span, that Hjalmar discovered their plans but were unable to stop them, and that by day's end, both the bridge and Hjalmar will be blown to pieces. Enraged, Thargas crushes the Dark Iron's head with his mace.\nIn a cave not far away, Broll ofers a herbal draught to Valeera, who is suffering from the effects of the &lt;a href=\"Mark%20of%20Kathra%27natir\"&gt;Mark of Kathra'natir&lt;/a&gt; and partially blames herself for the situation that she and Broll are stuck in while Lo'Gosh and Thargas are out scouting. Broll tells her that when he was similarly attacked by &lt;a href=\"Azgalor\"&gt;a demon&lt;/a&gt;, he too blamed himself and wasted years in self-recrimination. He urges Valeera to not make the same mistake, and that while what happened to her matters, how she deals with it matters more. Transforming into a &lt;a href=\"storm%20crow\"&gt;storm crow&lt;/a&gt;, Broll takes Valeera on his back so they can do some scouting of their own. During the flight, Valeera insists that it was her fault for touching the &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; dagger in &lt;a href=\"Menethil%20Harbor\"&gt;Menethil Harbor&lt;/a&gt;, and she admits that she is now scared of what she is and of what she could become.\nBroll and Valeera fly above Thandol Span and spot a group of Dark Iron dwarves led by Balgaras the Foul at one end of the bridge next to a &lt;a href=\"siege%20engine\"&gt;siege engine&lt;/a&gt;. Valeera notices that Balgaras is carrying a &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20the%20Anvilmars\"&gt;horned helmet&lt;/a&gt; and is accompanied by a &lt;a href=\"felhound\"&gt;felhunter&lt;/a&gt;, and she spots a dwarven captive that she concludes must be Hjalmar Anvilmar. She also notices a number of explosives, but before she and Broll are able to get closer, the Dark Irons notice them and begin firing at them, forcing Broll to quickly fly away.\nOn the dirigible mooring dock at &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;King Magni&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"rifleman\"&gt;riflemen&lt;/a&gt; are preparing to leave for Thandol Span. The dirigible's &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; master tells Magni that he can't transport the dwarves' cannons, since carrying heavy artillery would compromise the goblins' neutrality. Magni holds a short speech for his men, and &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar&lt;/a&gt; tells the king that he doesn't know how Thandol Span managed to fall, since he did in fact order reinforcements to &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;. \"Varian\", Anduin, and &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Katrana&lt;/a&gt; appear on the dock, with Katrana revealing that she countermanded Bolvar's orders; with their forces stretched so thin, dealing with the Dark Irons shouldn't be Stormwind's concern as they are Magni's brethren. While the dirigible takes off, Magni fumes at the insult of being likened to the Dark Irons and becomes more eager to meet with Lo'Gosh, the \"other\" Varian that &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; believes is the true king.\nBack in the &lt;a href=\"Wetlands\"&gt;Wetlands&lt;/a&gt;, Broll and Valeera meet up with Lo'Gosh and Thargas and inform them of what they saw on the bridge. While the party ride toward the span, Thargas promises to aid Lo'Gosh in deposing the usurper in Stormwind in return for his aid. To provide cover for the party's infiltration of the span, Broll summons fog and rain to obscure the Dark Iron sentries' sight.\nIn Stormwind Keep, Varian and Anduin bond over an archery session. Anduin asks how his father ended up in the hands of &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; if it was the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; who kidnapped him, to which Varian replies that he can't remember. As Anduin aims his bow, Varian promises him a reward if he's able to hit the bull's-eye on the target. The prince indeed hits the center of the target, and for his reward says that he would like to ask Bolvar to investigate how it came to be that Varian was ransomed by the naga. Lady Prestor watches the conversation from the shadows. She decides that Anduin is too perceptive and that this threat must be neutralized permanently.\nOn Thandol Span, Lo'Gosh's party are sneaking toward the bridge's central tower when the fog suddenly begins to disperse as a result of Balgaras' felhunter &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Lock\"&gt;countering&lt;/a&gt; Broll's spell. The Dark Iron sentries spot the intruders but are unable to fire as the rain has wet the powder in their rifles. Lo'Gosh and his companions charge at the dwarves, but in response Balgaras summons a huge &lt;a href=\"war%20golem\"&gt;war golem&lt;/a&gt;. After Lo'Gosh tries and fails to attack the golem, Thargas climbs into the Dark Irons' siege engine and rams it into the construct, simultaneously blowing open a hole into the central tower. While Thargas heads inside for his brother, Valeera finishes off Balgaras' felhunter. In a frenzy, she rips off and eats a portion of the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;'s flesh, much to Broll's fury. Lo'Gosh tells Broll that they can discuss the details of Valeera's behavior later, and that for now he should summon the rain again to make sure the dwarves' powder stays soaked.\nInside the explosive-packed tower, Thargas comes upon Balgaras preparing to kill Hjalmar by driving a fire spell right through the Helm of the Anvilmars to fuse it to Hjalmar's face. In response, Thargas rushes forward, chops off Balgaras' left hand, then knocks him aside and begins to free his brother. However, Balgaras lands right next to a set of explosives and begins casting a fire spell in his remaining hand to light the fuse. Hjalmar notices the attempt and jumps forward, absorbing the ensuing explosion with his own body. Devastated, Thargas finishes Balgaras off by smashing his head in, then rushes to his dying brother's side. With his last breath, Hjalmar tells Thargas that the Helm of the Anvilmars is now his, and that he should wear it bravely and save Thandol Span. Placing the helmet on his head, Thargas swear to uphold this last wish.\nThargas leaps outside to join Lo'Gosh, Broll, and Valeera in killing the remaining Dark Irons. Some of the dwarves fire up their wrecked siege engine and begin driving towards the group, but are interrupted when the vehicle suddenly blows apart after being bombarded from above. Aboard the dirigible high above the span, King Magni congratulates one of his men on the shot and tells the rest of his skirmishers to open fire on the remaining Dark Irons on the bridge. The goblin captain yells at Magni for bringing a cannon on board despite his orders, but Magni merely shrugs and asks \"What cannon?\" while one of his riflemen uses his elbow to knock the cannon off the side of the airship and down onto the Dark Irons below. With the surviving Dark Irons now fleeing the scene, the riflemen rappel down from the dirigible to kill or capture any survivors they can.\nShortly, Magni meets with Thargas and the other saviors of the span and offers his condolences for Hjalmar's death. When Magni points out that he ordered Thargas to bring his escort to Ironforge, Lo'Gosh explains that it was his insistence that Thargas bring him to the span instead. Lo'Gosh asks how it came to be that the span was left undefended, to which Magni replies that that is one of the things they need to investigate, as Lo'Gosh's doppelganger has been remarkably ineffective during his tenure. Magni ends the conversation by telling Lo'Gosh: \"I \"am\" addressing King Varian, I presume?\""}

She was the wife of &lt;a href=\"Thaedris%20Feathersong\"&gt;Thaedris Feathersong&lt;/a&gt; and though her memorial is not as grand or famous as the others in &lt;a href=\"Tel%27anor\"&gt;Tel'anor&lt;/a&gt;, it holds special importance for him. Her sarcophagus is located at the upper landing.\nThere was potent &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; in her bow, its string glowed with a pale light. Only a powerful force could pick it up. Thaedris asked the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;order leader&lt;/a&gt; helping him to retrieve her bow for him, which he believed was stolen by one of the restless spirits of Tel'anor. It turns out it was in the hands of Latara herself, who had too turned into a spectral spirit. The order leader granted her rest and brought the bow back to Thaedris. With Latara's release at long last, a great power enveloped one of the arrows left in her quiver.\nRelatives.\nShe may be related by marriage to &lt;a href=\"Rayne%20Feathersong\"&gt;Rayne Feathersong&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lyranne%20Feathersong\"&gt;Lyranne Feathersong&lt;/a&gt;.\nNotes.\nLatara Feathersong seems to have been one of the earliest Sentinel huntresses, and an active participant in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;. However, according to \"\", Tyrande Whisperwind supposedly established the Sentinels six centuries after the War of the Ancients, as the night elves of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; expanded from Mount Hyjal to Ashenvale. It is possible that older incarnations of the order existed within the &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Empire\"&gt;Kaldorei Empire&lt;/a&gt; military of &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt;, and Tyrande was inspired by memories of them after the conflict."}

A latency of 50ms means that it takes 50 milliseconds to send and receive a packet from the World of Warcraft server. For playing games online such as WoW, a low latency is desired as it means less communication time between control input and events happening on the player's screen. A high latency can become a hindrance for proper gameplay. Things that could be experienced are delayed messaging, out of sync battles and difficulty of performing tasks in-game that are required to advance. The terms \"Lag\" and \"Ping\" are often used when players refer to their current latency status.\nLatency Bar.\nThe Latency Bar measures the speed of your connection to the World of Warcraft server. A green bar means your connection is good. A yellow bar means you may experience intermittent delay, called lag. A red bar means your connection is poor and you will experience significant delay.\"\nThe bar itself was eventually merged into the &lt;a href=\"Game%20Menu\"&gt;Game Menu&lt;/a&gt; button.\nWhat can affect latency.\nWorld of Warcraft requires clients to connect to the Blizzard Servers to play the game. There are four possible breaking points in the transmission of the required communications, which are: the client's computer, the client's router, the client's ISP and finally Blizzard's Servers. In a network such as this, one faulty point causes the whole game experience to suffer. When trying to identify the cause of high latency, consider the following things: \nAny changes applied can cause devices to function slighly different than before, and as such, be the cause of elevated latency. Most likely, if problems ever do arise, something was done to alter the setup from how it worked before. The official World of Warcraft forums have a Technical Problem section where help can be found to more specifically pinpoint the cause and solve it.\nMalware.\nRemember to keep the computer free from adware, spyware and other malware. These would fall under the category of new software. Since these are applied to a computer without notification or permission of the user, it is easy to overlook these as a possible cause of higher latency.\nFile-sharing software.\nSome ISPs punish users of software by lowering the quality of their connections, which can increase latency. However, this usually stops promptly once the software stops running. With Bell Canada at least, one can use the same connection for both a BitTorrent client and WoW, but not both at the same time.\n4.0.6 Changes.\nIn 4.0.6 Blizzard changed the way the latency is displayed. There is now a 'home' and a 'world' latency. The official explanation is the following."}

Using the quick and explosive power of the &lt;a href=\"red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, and the focused and overwhelming magic of the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, the Devastation evoker can shoot at enemies from a distance using their long-range spells. Created by &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Neltharion&lt;/a&gt; to wield the power of all five of the &lt;a href=\"dragonflight\"&gt;dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;s, it is astounding to see coalescing energy when an evoker uses their powers. Preservation serves as a &lt;a href=\"Healer\"&gt;healing&lt;/a&gt; specialization. Using the abilities of the &lt;a href=\"bronze%20dragonflight\"&gt;bronze dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, they can manipulate time to help heal wounds faster, aided by the nurturing power of the &lt;a href=\"green%20dragonflight\"&gt;green dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;.\nStarting at level 58, dracthyr evokers will explore &lt;a href=\"dracthyr%20starting%20experience\"&gt;their own starting zone&lt;/a&gt;, separate from the rest of the races and &lt;a href=\"class\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt;es of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Forbidden%20Reach\"&gt;Forbidden Reach&lt;/a&gt;. Before stepping foot on new uncharted land, players will be able to pick their faction - &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; - on the character creation screen, similar to the &lt;a href=\"Pandaren%20%28playable%29\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Dragonflight\" is required to play the evoker class, and players are limited to one evoker per realm. A player's first evoker can be created without additional restrictions, but creating another evoker character will require a pre-existing level 50 character on their realm of choice.\nEvokers use a new spell type called Empower. By holding down a button, the player can charge up a spell. The longer the spell is charged up, the more damage it puts out or the more targets it hits. An Empowered ability stays at max charge up to three seconds, after which it fires of automatically.\nEvokers were playable with &lt;a href=\"patch%2010.0\"&gt;patch 10.0&lt;/a&gt; a few weeks before the expansion, similar to &lt;a href=\"demon%20hunter\"&gt;demon hunter&lt;/a&gt;s in the expansion.\nBackground.\nEvery &lt;a href=\"dracthyr\"&gt;dracthyr&lt;/a&gt; is an expert soldier. Whatever &lt;a href=\"weyrn\"&gt;weyrn&lt;/a&gt; they serve, they use their talents to defend dragonkind in obedience to the Earth-Warder. Yet even among such illustrious ranks, there are a select few who transcend the skills of their kin, who are able to master the specialties of all weyrns and shift between roles at will. These are the evokers; the best of the best, finest of the finest.\nThese elite forces possess the rare potential to focus their essences into an instrument of preservation or a weapon of devastation. The journey to such mastery is long, and few dracthyr can see this path through. But those who learn to harness their full potential shall be honored with the title of evoker.\nSpecializations.\nEvokers started with only two &lt;a href=\"specialization\"&gt;specialization&lt;/a&gt;s, but will get one more in &lt;a href=\"patch%2010.1.5\"&gt;patch 10.1.5&lt;/a&gt;:\nDevelopment.\nThe evokers were created as an alternative to the pre-existing classes. Upon the creation of the dracthyr, developers felt as if the original classes did not encompass the idea of the dracthyr that they wanted; and so, to create a work around this issue, a unique class was made to represent the wonders of the dragonflights."}

A paladin must be of good alignment and loses all light abilities if he ever willingly commits an evil act. He loses all paladin spells and abilities (but not weapon, armor, or shield proficiencies).\nAdditionally, a paladin\u2019s code requires that he respect legitimate authority, act with honor (not lying, not cheating, not using poison and so forth), help those in need (provided they do not use his help for evil or &lt;a href=\"chaotic\"&gt;chaotic&lt;/a&gt; ends), and punish those who harm or threaten innocents. While he may adventure with characters of any good or &lt;a href=\"true%20neutral\"&gt;neutral&lt;/a&gt; alignment, a paladin will never knowingly associate with evil persons, nor will he continue an association with someone who consistently offends his moral code. A paladin may accept only henchmen, followers or cohorts who are of good alignment.\nIf they break any of these, they may not train any farther as a paladin. He regains his abilities and advancement potential if he atones for his violations. An ex-paladin may only restore his paladinhood if he is truly repentant and desirous of setting right his misdeeds, this atonement requires undertaking a quest, and/or through the spell of \"atonement\".\nThe &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; has a couple of ex-paladins dedicated to training new paladins who join the organization. Although paladins keep joining \u2014 and some are already a part of \u2014 the Scarlet Crusade, few can balance their commitment to the Light with the dark deeds done by the Scarlet Crusade, so few keep their holy status.

An echo of him called Councilor Hataaru can still be found there, watching a &lt;a href=\"jed%27hin\"&gt;jed'hin&lt;/a&gt; match at the &lt;a href=\"Circle%20of%20Aspirants\"&gt;Circle of Aspirants&lt;/a&gt;. Hataaru says he participated in a round or two of jed'hin in his life, but the competitors are far better than he could ever hope to be and he must admit he is envious.\nFollowing the ejection of the darkened &lt;a href=\"K%27ara\"&gt;K'ara&lt;/a&gt; from the \"&lt;a href=\"Genedar\"&gt;Genedar&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"Prophet%20Velen\"&gt;Prophet Velen&lt;/a&gt; found himself able to see the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;'s desired futures. Finding it difficult to distinguish visions of true calamity from glimpses into the Void's dreams of a corrupted universe convinced Velen that it would be disastrous if he were the only leader among his people. Thus the exarchs (a council of sages that would oversee different aspects of draenei culture), was created and Hataaru was chosen to be exarch of the Artificers, tasked with building armor, weapons, and settlements. Among Hataaru's first creations were &lt;a href=\"arkonite\"&gt;arkonite&lt;/a&gt; crystals, which served as conduits of arcane energy which brought light and power to draenei society and also allowed them to build constructs to protect their homes from danger.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; manipulated the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s into attacking the draenei Hataaru initially thought the orcs were victims of the world's natural disasters and elemental upheaval and merely sought to defend their holdings. Upon discovering the Burning Legion had been manipulating the orcs Hataaru and his fellow leaders knew they could no longer defend their holdings and ordered their forces to withdraw to &lt;a href=\"Shattrath\"&gt;Shattrath&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Karabor\"&gt;Temple of Karabor&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe draenei helped prepared the defense of the Temple of Karabor and against all odds the outnumbered draenei were able to push the relentless orcs back. In response &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt; used the &lt;a href=\"K%27ara\"&gt;Dark Star&lt;/a&gt; to break the stalemate. Though Hataaru and many of the draenei survived, they were forced to abandon the temple to the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Knowing that Shattrath was doomed to fall Hataaru, along with his fellow exarchs, argued against Velen's decision to be among the defenders of the city. Convinced that the best hope for their race's survival was under Velen's leadership, the exarchs persuaded Velen to leave Shattrath. Thus Velen would flee with the civilians while bulk of their military might would remain within the city, in order to sacrifice themselves to ensure the survival of the draenei race and trick that orcs into thinking that they had slaughtered all of them. \nHataaru's fate is unknown but he was presumably killed by the Horde.\nSpeculation.\nIt's possible that like his alternate universe self he was killed by Exarch Othaar. The Orcish Horde's attack on Shattrath would have provided him with the cover to do the deed."}

He discovered that &lt;a href=\"D%27ore\"&gt;D'ore&lt;/a&gt;'s corpse was attracting the souls of draenei who died in the \"&lt;a href=\"Genedar\"&gt;Genedar&lt;/a&gt;s crash and allowed the draenei to commune with them. &lt;a href=\"Auchindoun\"&gt;Auchindoun&lt;/a&gt; was constructed and the &lt;a href=\"Auchenai\"&gt;Auchenai&lt;/a&gt; established to protect the dead, with Maladaar promoted to a member of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Exarchs\"&gt;Council of Exarchs&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the fall of &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt;, many &lt;a href=\"Vindicator\"&gt;Vindicator&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Rangari\"&gt;Rangari&lt;/a&gt; fled to Auchindoun in hopes of defending it from the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Maladaar organized the military defenses, and they fiercely defended Auchindoun from &lt;a href=\"Teron%20Gorefiend\"&gt;Teron'gor&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt;. They also received aid from Auchindoun's departed spirits, and together slaughtered many of the Shadow Council's agents. As Maladaar and his forces closed in, Teron'gor sought out the &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s who pooled their powers together and reached beyond the veil of reality. They sought to bring a powerful demon into the world, but in their wild desperation found something else instead: &lt;a href=\"Murmur\"&gt;Murmur&lt;/a&gt;. This otherworldly elemental creature was pulled to Draenor from a distant corner of the universe, and the shockwave on its arrival ripped the earth asunder. Many draenei were killed and Auchindoun was blasted apart. Waves of destructive energy rolled out and leveled the &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Wastes\"&gt;surrounding forest&lt;/a&gt;.\nMaladaar and a handful of his draenei used their magics to shield themselves from the blast. But though they survived, they no longer had the numbers to resist the Shadow Council. Teron'gor and his warlocks overwhelmed the draenei and bound them in chains, and contained Murmur deep within Auchindoun as well.\nMaladaar would eventually be driven mad by the loss of everyone and everything he had ever loved. His lunatic dedication to the preservation of their memory drove him to a mastery of the dark arts. Once he turned to necromancy, he created &lt;a href=\"Shirrak%20the%20Dead%20Watcher\"&gt;Shirrak the Dead Watcher&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter his death by the adventurers of the Alliance and Horde, the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"D%27ore\"&gt;D'ore&lt;/a&gt; appeared and redeemed his &lt;a href=\"ghost\"&gt;spirit&lt;/a&gt;, which eventually appeared to &lt;a href=\"Greatfather%20Aldrimus\"&gt;Greatfather Aldrimus&lt;/a&gt; and thanked him for having Maladaar killed."}

He leads the reclamation of from the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nAssault on the Dark Portal.\nAt some time prior to the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s invasion of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Exarch%20Othaar\"&gt;Exarch Othaar&lt;/a&gt; - a &lt;a href=\"Sargerei\"&gt;Sargerei&lt;/a&gt; traitor in the Exarchs - arranged for the Iron Horde to capture Maladaar, expecting that the orcs would kill him. Maladaar was held in the the &lt;a href=\"Tanaan%20Jungle\"&gt;Tanaan Jungle&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Hand%20clan%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Shattered Hand&lt;/a&gt; and tortured, until the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;champion&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; freed him along with during the &lt;a href=\"Assault%20on%20the%20Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Assault on the Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;. Maladaar joined them in their escape from Tanaan Jungle, and upon entering &lt;a href=\"Umbral%20Halls\"&gt;Umbral Halls&lt;/a&gt; he and &lt;a href=\"Qiana%20Moonshadow\"&gt;Qiana Moonshadow&lt;/a&gt; went to scout the cave. Soon after, he returned to inform &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; and they left the cave. Eventually he battled against the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Blackrock&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Quarry\"&gt;Blackrock Quarry&lt;/a&gt;. After the battle, he and Yrel healed the draenei escapees.\nWhen the forces split up Maladaar followed &lt;a href=\"Yrel\"&gt;Yrel&lt;/a&gt; and the Alliance champion to .\nThe Pursuit of Justice.\nAfter the Alliance arrived in Shadowmoon Valley, Maladaar returned to the city of &lt;a href=\"Elodor\"&gt;Elodor&lt;/a&gt;, and was soon summoned to a meeting of the &lt;a href=\"Exarch%20Council\"&gt;Exarch Council&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Maraad\"&gt;Maraad&lt;/a&gt; and the Alliance champion. Having grown wary due to his ordeal in Tanaan, Maladaar began to suspect demonic dangers to his people afoot within Shadowmoon, and with the assistance of the Alliance champion successfully located a &lt;a href=\"Sargerei\"&gt;Sargerei&lt;/a&gt; hideout in the city.\nOn the matter of what to do with this troubling development, the Exarch Council proved divided, each leader with their own opinion of how to best guide their people. Maladaar chose to be proactive, and, after the murder of &lt;a href=\"Exarch%20Hataaru%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Exarch Hataaru&lt;/a&gt;, he left of his own volition to investigate Hataaru's death, even though Exarch Akama and Othaar were against it. Maladaar and &lt;a href=\"Soulbinder%20Nyami\"&gt;Soulbinder Nyami&lt;/a&gt; performed a ritual to summon forth Hataaru's spirit to identify his killer, and though Maladaar learned an exarch had a role in his death, Nyami abruptly ended the ritual after Maladaar asked Hataaru who killed him and Hataaru pointed at her.\nMaladaar asked the Alliance champion to help him install a device on &lt;a href=\"Exarch%27s%20Rise\"&gt;Exarch's Rise&lt;/a&gt; to help root out the traitor, which exposed Exarch Othaar as the traitor. Exarch Othaar transformed into a &lt;a href=\"man%27ari\"&gt;man'ari&lt;/a&gt; and renamed himself &lt;a href=\"Socrethar%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Socrethar&lt;/a&gt;, but fled upon being weakened by the Alliance champion, warning the other exarchs that their days were numbered. Maladaar, fearing there may be other traitors among the draenei's ranks, departed for &lt;a href=\"Talador\"&gt;Talador&lt;/a&gt; with Nyami to see to the safety of .\nIn the Shadows of Auchindoun.\nWhen Maladaar arrived he found Auchindoun under siege by the under the personal command of &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Teron%27gor\"&gt;Teron'gor&lt;/a&gt;. With the assistance of the champion, Maladaar discovered that Teron'gor planned to conquer Auchindoun to feast on the souls therein and that the Shadow Council had already begun subverting the Auchenai's defenses with the help of Sargerei agents. &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Sunsworn\"&gt;Sunsworn&lt;/a&gt;, a force of &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; who have came to Talador's aid against the Legion, joined with Maladaar and the Auchenai. Maladaar and Liadrin's forces then began a counter-offensive, holding the line at Auchindoun itself and undoing the Legion's work in the nearby city of &lt;a href=\"Telmor%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Telmor&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs this was happening, Nyami left Maladaar, stating she would confront and defeat Teron'gor herself. Maladaar, concerned for her safety, asked the champion to find her. The champion found her holding Teron'gor's &lt;a href=\"Demonic%20Gateway\"&gt;Demonic Gateway&lt;/a&gt; open, and when the champion, Maladaar and Liadrin charged through the portal the trap was sprung. The portal led to the destroyed world of &lt;a href=\"Xandros\"&gt;Xandros&lt;/a&gt; where Gul'dan and Teron'gor lay in wait to kill them with the help of the &lt;a href=\"pit%20lord\"&gt;pit lord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mongrethod\"&gt;Mongrethod&lt;/a&gt;. Though Maladaar and Liadrin were victorious over the annihilan, Gul'dan and Teron'gor took advantage of the distraction to break through the defense of Auchindoun in a bloody rush. When Maladaar, Liadrin and the champion arrived back at Auchindoun they found the entrance paved with corpses and no sign of where Teron'gor and Gul'dan had gone. He informed &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; about Teron'gor's infiltrating of Auchindoun. \nSha'tari Defense.\nMaladaar, along with the &lt;a href=\"Sha%27tari%20Defense\"&gt;Sha'tari Defense&lt;/a&gt;, Auchenai soul priests, and Liadrin's Blood Knights, arrived at Shattrath to take back the city from the Burning Legion and Sargerei forces. Maladaar and Liadrin eventually confront and kill Socrethar himself, paving the way for the Auchenai to retake Shattrath in time.\nMaladaar later presides over &lt;a href=\"Yrel\"&gt;Yrel&lt;/a&gt;'s trials of the exarch. He praises both Yrel and the player's abilities, and christens Lady Yrel as Exarch Yrel before the gathered crowds.\nHe is ultimately seen with the other Exarchs at the Gates of Tanaan confronting Warchief Grommash after the death of &lt;a href=\"Azuka%20Bladefury\"&gt;Azuka Bladefury&lt;/a&gt;.\nFury of Hellfire.\nWhile Yrel and the forces of Lunarfall infiltrate Tanaan by sailing in from the east, Maladaar leads an attack on the Path of Glory in Talador alongside and destroys the gate to Tanaan. This opens up a new battlefield with the Iron Horde on &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Front\"&gt;The Iron Front&lt;/a&gt;, which he presides over for the &lt;a href=\"Hand%20of%20the%20Prophet\"&gt;Hand of the Prophet&lt;/a&gt;. After he was checked with the commander, he sent him to three agents, that were scouting the Tanaan terrain.\nMaladaar is ultimately seen with the other Exarchs in Karabor as he the commander receives the blessing of the naaru &lt;a href=\"K%27ara%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;K'ara&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuotes.\nGossip.\nIf we make it out of this jungle, I will personally see to it that you and your people are taken care of.\nA traitor among us - a fallen Exarch!\nThis is... unthinkable.\nThe Light is screaming for aid.\nThe spirits within Auchindoun grow restless.

His lunatic dedication to the preservation of their memory has driven him to a mastery of the dark arts.\"\nStrategy.\nDPS during this fight should stay aware and focus on killing shadow doubles when they are spawned. Doubles have roughly the same health and abilities as the characters they copy, and will die quickly under a focused attack. At 25% health, Maladaar creates a double of himself with 30,000 HP. This double has a mortal strike ability, and can be offtanked or kited while you kill Maladaar. You may also kill the double first, but it will probably be harder for your tank to gain aggro on it.\nMaladaar will hit players in close range with a shadow attack about 1000-1200 damage. Shadow resistance will help the tank, but is not vital. The key point is to kill the shadow doubles and keep them off the healer.\nThe AoE fear can result in your healer being killed if the non-healing party members are all melee. When he fears all of the melee party members he'll go straight for the healer and likely kill them. In this kind of group makeup the healer needs to be sure to stay in fear range. In groups with ranged DPS he usually goes for the ranged DPS instead of the healer so it isn't as much of a problem. Though this puts you in range of the shadow attack mentioned above the healing isn't too intensive; a couple heals for everyone every 5 to 10 secs is enough. A shaman can use &lt;a href=\"Tremor%20Totem\"&gt;Tremor Totem&lt;/a&gt; to minimize the effect of the AoE fear.\nIn the event you kill Maladaar, but not the double, the Avatar will remain over his corpse. After several minutes (but before the bosses' corpse despawns) the Avatar will die automatically. Alternatively, he can be killed by himself upon your return from the ghost run; he does give rep and has a good drop in heroic mode. Using an ankh or a soulstone to resurrect while the Avatar is still there may aggro him.\nHeroic mode.\nEssentially the same fight; tank &amp; spank. OT to pickup the Avatar helps, but quite easy. The Avatar hits as hard as him and can cause a wipe if using only one tank. Fortunately, you can resurrect, rebuff, and engage him while looting the actual boss. His Ribbon of Souls didn't seem to hit any harder than on normal mode."}

Evidently the mortal eredar are not multiversal singularities, as there have been at least two Velens encountered. Similarly, the conversation where Afrasiabi revealed this information did go on to suggest that the situation with the eredar is 'difficult' to say the least. The Socrethar encountered on Outland is clearly familiar with the draenei who confront him, and the fall of Draenor, and vice-versa. So how the two relate to each other is currently unknown."}

The north of the Rise forms a rampart overlooking Ashran's northeastern beaches, from which Ashmaul archers fire arrows down upon the boats of apparent encroachers. Populated by &lt;a href=\"ray\"&gt;ray&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"riverbeast\"&gt;riverbeast&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Sand%20Snapper\"&gt;Sand Snapper&lt;/a&gt;s, the beach is littered with pearl-bearing clams.\nBrute's Rise is perhaps the highest point in Ashran, with its back set against the mountains that form the zone's eastern ridge. To the west a path runs down to &lt;a href=\"Emberfall%20Tower\"&gt;Emberfall Tower&lt;/a&gt;, while to the south the land drops sharply to where &lt;a href=\"The%20Dark%20Woods\"&gt;The Dark Woods&lt;/a&gt; nestle in the crook of the mountains.\nThe Rise appears to be one of the main bases of the Ashmaul, and they can be found practising their fire magics throughout the area. Summoned fire elementals escort or assist their masters in their rituals around the large bonfires that dot the zone, while herds of &lt;a href=\"Wild%20Goreger\"&gt;Wild Goreger&lt;/a&gt;s graze in unused areas, with a few larger specimens domesticated to serve as war-boars for the ogres.\nEvents.\nOgre Fires! is the even that takes place in Brute's Rise.\nPlayers must rush to claim Ogre Fires in the north-east of the zone. During the event, one of the numerous ogres in the area will become marked as the Ogre Fire, becoming claimable by a tug-of-war bar similar to bases in &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20the%20Storm\"&gt;Eye of the Storm&lt;/a&gt;. Once a faction has fully claimed the fire, their score is increased by 1, and a new Ogre Fire is nominated. The first faction to claim 3 fires wins the event.\nSpecial objects.\nBoulder piles can be interacted with to gain a special buff allowing the player to throw targetable boulders onto nearby players and NPCs, dealing substantial damage. Each pile grants 3 boulders.\nGrappling hooks can be used from Brute's Rise to scale down to the beach below, or from the beach to climb up to the Rise.\n&lt;a href=\"Captured%20Gor%27vosh%20Stoneshaper\"&gt;Captured Gor'vosh Stoneshaper&lt;/a&gt;s can be found in crude cages in the area; freeing them will earn the player their gratitude, with the ogre granting them their Boulder Shield, a powerful protective barrier that constantly regenerates while out of combat, with a medium-term duration.\nTrivia.\nAn of Ashran shows this area named the \"Ogre Tower\". During &lt;a href=\"Warlords%20of%20Draenor%20beta%20timeline\"&gt;the expansion's beta&lt;/a&gt;, it was known as \"The Tower\"."}

It is performed by casting &lt;a href=\"Hearthstone\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt; while protected by &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Shield\"&gt;Divine Shield&lt;/a&gt;, preventing enemies from interrupting the Hearthstone cast.\nAlthough very useful, bubble-hearthing is generally viewed as a cowardly act and those who use it are often mocked for doing so. Of course, this tactic has to be used when necessary, such as when a roaming paladin finds himself unfairly situated against multiple foes and does not stand any chance of emerging victorious. In such situations, the Bubble Hearth is more of a smart move than a cowardly one. Indeed, wise (and fearless) paladins may realise that the most challenging and courageous path of all is at times to remove themselves from battle, and bubble-hearthing paladins can hold their heads high in the knowledge that they are making a most Righteous Retreat. \nBubble-hearthing paladins are largely immune to enemy attacks thanks to &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Shield\"&gt;Divine Shield&lt;/a&gt;'s effects. However, &lt;a href=\"Priest\"&gt;Priest&lt;/a&gt;s' &lt;a href=\"Mass%20Dispel\"&gt;Mass Dispel&lt;/a&gt; spell and &lt;a href=\"Warrior\"&gt;Warrior&lt;/a&gt;s' &lt;a href=\"Shattering%20Throw\"&gt;Shattering Throw&lt;/a&gt; are capable of removing this immunity. Paladins can reduce the likelihood of this happening by pre-emptively using CC abilities such as &lt;a href=\"Hammer%20of%20Justice\"&gt;Hammer of Justice&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Fist%20of%20Justice\"&gt;Fist of Justice&lt;/a&gt;) or &lt;a href=\"Repentance\"&gt;Repentance&lt;/a&gt; on enemies capable of removing Divine Shield. The duration of these abilities will potentially keep the target out of action long enough to prevent them from interrupting the paladin's Hearthstone cast.\nDebate.\nBubble Hearthing has long incurred the wrath of non-paladins. Seen as a cowardly move, it allows paladins to escape defeat (or simply avoid PvP entirely), in a manner that may be considered unfair by their opponents. Bubble Hearthing and its debatable fairness has been the subject of much discourse within the community, including the creation of numerous videos and even a song (see below).\nAs a method of avoiding an otherwise inevitable defeat, Bubble Hearthing can be frustrating for the paladin's attackers, as it may deprive them of the glory and satisfaction of finishing their opponent. However, it should be remembered that many other classes have similar capabilities, and when faced with a no-win situation will also often choose to flee combat rather than stand and fight (and die). A prime example of this behaviour would be &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt;s, with numerous abilities such as &lt;a href=\"Vanish\"&gt;Vanish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sprint\"&gt;Sprint&lt;/a&gt; designed to allow for a swift exit should things turn sour.\nWhile still generally considered a cowardly move, Blizzard's explicit re-implementation of Bubble Hearthing with &lt;a href=\"Glyph%20of%20the%20Righteous%20Retreat\"&gt;Glyph of the Righteous Retreat&lt;/a&gt; can be seen as at last ending the debate regarding its overall validity. While the decency of Bubble Hearthing may continue to be disputed, it is at least clear that the trick is (now) intended to be part of the paladin's repertoire. The glyph's tongue-in-cheek title, as well as in-game references such as those listed below, also reveal Blizzard's awareness of the community's attitude toward the trick.\nOfficial references.\nIt is unknown if Blizzard planned the Bubble Hearth to be a paladin tactic, although it's likely that its existence was merely a coincidence. Even so, Blizzard seems to have since embraced the Bubble Hearth as an iconic feature of the paladin class.\nOther.\nThere is even a song made by players relating to this act:\nHistory.\nPre-Cataclysm.\nBefore &lt;a href=\"Patch%204.0.1\"&gt;Patch 4.0.1&lt;/a&gt;, the Bubble Hearth was performed simply by casting &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Shield\"&gt;Divine Shield&lt;/a&gt; followed immediately by &lt;a href=\"Hearthstone\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;. This worked because the duration of Divine Shield (then 12 seconds) overlapped the Hearthstone's cast time (10 seconds). \nCataclysm.\nWith &lt;a href=\"Patch%204.0.1\"&gt;Patch 4.0.1&lt;/a&gt;, the duration of Divine Shield was reduced to 8 seconds, whereas the casting time of Hearthstone remained at its previous duration of 10 seconds, making the Bubble Hearth impossible.\nHowever, there still remained ways of replicating the tactic: when wearing 4 pieces of the &lt;a href=\"Valorous%20Redemption%20Plate\"&gt;Tier 7 Protection Set&lt;/a&gt; (level 80), the set bonus increased the duration of Divine Shield (and Divine Protection) by 3 seconds, allowing you to negate the nerf and still make a glorious exit.\nAnother solution was (and remains) &lt;a href=\"The%20Last%20Relic%20of%20Argus\"&gt;The Last Relic of Argus&lt;/a&gt;, an item from &lt;a href=\"archaeology\"&gt;archaeology&lt;/a&gt;. Having a cast time of 5 seconds, it can effectively replace the Hearthstone as a teleportation item. The only downside is that it has a 12 hour cooldown, and teleports the user to an unpredictable and usually rather undesirable location.\nThese options aside, the Bubble Hearth remained impossible throughout Cataclysm.\nMists of Pandaria.\nBubble Hearthing officially returned to the game in patch &lt;a href=\"Patch%205.0.4\"&gt;Patch 5.0.4&lt;/a&gt; with the introduction of &lt;a href=\"Glyph%20of%20the%20Righteous%20Retreat\"&gt;Glyph of the Righteous Retreat&lt;/a&gt;, a minor glyph which reduces Hearthstone's cast time to 5 seconds when under the effect of &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Shield\"&gt;Divine Shield&lt;/a&gt;. Since Divine Shield lasts for 8 seconds, this gives the paladin a 3-second window in which to cast the Hearthstone (as opposed to the 2-second window possible before Patch 4.0.1).\nLegion.\n&lt;a href=\"Patch%207.0.3\"&gt;Patch 7.0.3&lt;/a&gt; removed Glyph of the Righteous Retreat while making its effect baseline for all paladins."}
