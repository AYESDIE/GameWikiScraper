Basically, vignette instance IDs quickly become too large. The system that handles interaction between Lua and C tries to assign the vignette instance ID a 32-bit signed integer, but vignette instance IDs actually cap out at the cap for 32-bit unsigned integers. This causes an integer overflow, resulting in total failure of C_Vignettes.GetVignetteInfoFromInstanceID() and partial failure of VIGNETTE_ADDED (it will give you negative 64-bit signed integers in place of the real integers for some reason?).\nThe vignette system will work for fine for objects that never despawn and only fade from the player's view (since they will have the same vignette instance ID as they did when the server came up), but for things like npcs that repeatedly respawn and require new vignette instance IDs, the numbers rapidly become too large. NPCs will work fine with vignettes for the first few hours after a server restart, while they are still within the bounds of signed integers, but they will quickly begin to fail afterwards."}

More importantly they were an epiphany, the key to unlocking a whole new universe of knowledge. And the epiphany was why he was here.\nNobundo took comfort in the words as he slowly negotiated Zangarmarsh's forest of colossal mushrooms, their spores glowing green and red in the early morning mist. He traversed the creaky wooden bridges that stretched over the shallow marshland waters. In just a few moments he found himself at his destination, gazing up at the radiant underbelly of a mushroom that dwarfed all others. There atop its cap, the draenei settlement of Telredor awaited him.\nHe progressed with trepidation, leaning heavily on his walking stick and cursing the pain in his joints as he stepped onto the platform that would carry him to the top. He was worried, for he was still unsure how the others would react. There had been a time when his kind had not even been allowed to enter the settlements of the unaffected.\n\"They are just going to laugh at me.\"\nHe took a deep breath of the cool, misty marsh air and asked it to give him courage for the challenge to come.\nOnce the platform came to a stop, Nobundo carefully shuffled through the arched entryway, down several shallow steps, and out onto the landing overlooking the settlement's small plaza, where the assembly had already gathered.\nHe gazed down at the hard-set faces of the various draenei, whose disdainful, superior eyes stared up at him.\nHe was, after all, \"Krokul\": \"Broken\".\nTo be Broken was to be outcast and vilified. It was not right or just, but it was the reality he had been forced to accept. Many of his unaffected brothers and sisters could not understand how the decline of the Krokul could have occurred, and especially, as in Nobundo's case, how one who had been so gifted and so favored by the Light could have fallen so far.\nThough Nobundo himself did not know exactly how it happened, he did know when. He recollected with startling clarity the exact moment that marked the beginning of his own personal descent.\n- Chapter 1 -\nThe skies wept when the orcs laid siege to Shattrath City.\nIt had been many long months since rain had graced the lands of Draenor, but now, almost as if in protest of the looming battle, dark clouds roiled overhead. Light showers drizzled over the city and the army outside its walls, increasing to a steady downpour as the two sides watched and waited.\n\"There must be a thousand of them\", Nobundo speculated grimly from his perch high atop the inner ramparts. Beyond the outer walls shadows moved among the torch-lit trees of Terokkar Forest. Perhaps if the orcs had taken the time to plan more carefully, they would have deforested the region outside in preparation for their attack, but these days the orcs cared little for strategy. For them there was only the thrill of battle and the immediate gratification of bloodshed.\nTelmor had fallen, as had Karabor and Farahlon. So many of the draenei's once-majestic cities now lay in ruins. Shattrath was all that was left.\nSlowly the orc assemblage maneuvered into position, making Nobundo think of a great fanged serpent coiling itself in preparation to strike... a strike that would surely spell the end of Shattrath's defenders.\n\"Not that we are meant to survive anyway.\"\nHe knew full well that he and the others who had gathered here tonight were meant to be a sacrifice. They had volunteered to remain behind and fight this last battle. Their inevitable defeat would appease the orcs such that they would consider the draenei decimated and all but extinct. Those who had sought refuge elsewhere would survive to fight another day, a day when the scales would be more balanced.\n\"So be it then. My spirit will live on, becoming one with the glory that is the Light.\"\nEmboldened, Nobundo stood to his full height, his strong and athletic frame bracing for the events to come. His thick tail shifted anxiously as he settled his weight evenly between both leonine legs and ground the toes of his hooves into the solid stone masonry. He took a deep breath, tightening his hands around the shaft of his Light-blessed crystalline hammer.\n\"But I will not go quietly.\"\nHe and the other Vindicators, holy warriors of the Light, would fight to the very last. He glanced to either side at his brethren stationed at intervals along the wall walk. Like him, they stood impassive and resolute, having reached their own peace with the destiny that now awaited them.\nOutside, the war machines had arrived: catapults, rams, ballistae--siege engines of every description passing briefly through the torchlight. Their heavy apparatuses creaked and groaned ominously as they were positioned within striking distance of the walls.\nDrumbeats sounded, sporadic at first, then quickly joined by more and more until the entire forest was alive with a rhythm that started soft like the rain, then grew to a persistent, thundering roll. Nobundo whispered a prayer, asking the Light to give him strength.\nThere was a deep rumbling and movement in the murky clouds overhead that echoed the frantic drumbeats below. For a second Nobundo wondered if perhaps the Light meant to answer his prayer with a display of power and fury beyond any he could hope to summon, a great beam of holy fire that would eradicate the entire savage, bloodthirsty army in one magnificent sweep.\nA display indeed followed, but not of the holy powers of the Light.\nThe clouds thundered, swirled, and erupted, punched through by massive flaming projectiles that hurtled to the earth with meteoric speed and bone-jarring strength.\nA deafening roar assaulted Nobundo's ears as one of the objects passed perilously close, obliterating a nearby buttress and pelting him with flying debris. As if awaiting this signal, the multitudes outside pressed forward, their bloodcurdling war-cries rolling over the city as they mobilized with singular purpose: to destroy all within their path.\nThe rain's intensity increased as the outermost walls shuddered from the strikes of massive stones slung by the crude catapults. Nobundo knew the outer walls would not hold. They had been constructed rather hastily: the wall sections extending above the depressed floor of the outer ring were an addition made in the last year, a defense made necessary by the orcs' methodical extermination of his people and the subsequent realization that this city would be their final bastion.\nSeveral brutish ogres went to work on penetrating a section of wall already compromised from the meteor assault. Two more of the massive beasts swung a gargantuan battering ram against the city's main gates.\nNobundo's brethren cast several attacks against the enemy, but wherever the draenei struck one attacker down, two more would take his place. The damaged wall section had begun to crumble completely. A flood of crazed orcs clamored on the opposite side, climbing over top of one another in a frenzy of bloodlust.\nThe time had come. Nobundo raised his hammer to the sky, closed his eyes, and cleared his mind of the overwhelming cacophony of battle. His mind called out, and his body felt the familiar warmth of the Light wash over him. The hammer glowed. He focused his intentions and directed the blessed, purging holy powers into the ogres below.\nThere was a blinding flash that briefly illuminated the entire battle scene, accompanied by a startled bellowing from the front line of orcs as the Holy Light seared through them, stunning them into silence and halting them long enough for several draenei warriors to focus on bringing down one of the giant ogres.\nNobundo's momentary relief was crushed by the sound of splintering wood: the final successful thrust of the battering ram against the main gates. Nobundo watched as the Lower City defenders raced to meet the incoming tide of orcs and ogres and were immediately cut down. Nobundo called upon the Light again, directing his healing powers to whomever he could, but the opposition was simply too great. As soon as he healed a wounded draenei, that same warrior endured repeated, brutal attacks mere seconds later.\nMore ogres had gone to work on the weakened section of outer wall and were now succeeding in pushing through. The defenders, hopelessly outnumbered, were beset on either side.\nThe orcs were crazed, drunk on their bloodlust. As the outer ring filled with their number, Nobundo could see their eyes: they glowed, burned with a crimson fury that was at once mesmerizing and terrifying. Nobundo and the other Vindicators switched tactics, from healing to purging. Once again the city was bathed in brilliant radiance as scores of orcs were struck by the Light, the crimson glow dimming from their eyes momentarily as they slumped forward to be dispatched by the remaining draenei warriors.\n\"Kra-koom!\"\nThe wall shook, and Nobundo's hooves slid on the rain-slicked stone. He steadied himself and looked down to see one of the ogres pummeling away at the base of the buttress to his left with a tree trunk-sized club. He raised his hammer to the sky and closed his eyes, but his concentration was quickly broken by another sound...\n\"Kra-KABOOM!\"\nNot the ogre this time, but an explosion that originated from somewhere below but out of sight, knocking Nobundo off balance. He rolled to his side and glanced over the edge to see a fine red mist billowing out into Lower City. The few defenders who were left immediately began choking and retching. They doubled over, many of them dropping their weapons. The barbaric orcs made quick work of the sickened warriors, reveling in the carnage.\nWhen the slaughter was finished, they glared upward, rabid in their desire to tear the defenders on the wall limb from limb. Several orcs climbed on the backs of the ogres, attempting to scale the sheer surface by hand. Their aggression and unbridled ferocity were staggering. The mist had spread throughout the entirety of Lower City and was now beginning to rise, slowly obscuring the bedlam below.\nNobundo heard a commotion behind him. Several orcs who had somehow broken through the inner circle's defenses now stormed onto the rise.\n\"Kra-koom!\"\nThe wall shuddered again, and Nobundo cursed the ogre below, who had undoubtedly returned to pummeling the buttress. A second salvo of flaming meteors fell from the sky as Nobundo readied to meet the oncoming crush of attackers.\nHe directed the fury of the Light into the first orc head-on. The green beast's eyes dimmed, and he crumpled. Nobundo brought the crystal hammerhead down squarely on top of the orc's skull, then yanked upward and swung left, feeling a satisfying crunch as the orc's ribs shattered. He twisted and brought the hammer across at a downward arc into the side of another orc's leg, shattering its kneecap. The beast howled in pain and fell forward off of the rampart.\nThe mist had worked its way onto the rise now, where it rolled out and covered the stone like a carpet. Nobundo and his fellow Vindicators fought on as the mist rose to chest level, then finally to their faces, stinging their eyes and burning their lungs.\nNobundo heard the death-cries of several of his companions, but he had lost sight of them in the dense red fog. Mercifully the attacks on him seemed to have abated; he stumbled back a step, stifling the urge to vomit. It felt as if his skull was about to burst.\nThen he heard a horrific battle cry from out of the mist that chilled him to the bone.\nA shadow approached. Nobundo struggled to see as his body wrenched in spasms. He tried desperately to hold his breath as out of the dense crimson mist stepped a tattooed, fiery-eyed terror... a massive orc covered in the distinctive blue of draenei blood, out of breath, twisting a wicked two-handed axe in his grip. His raven-hued hair clung to his thick chest and shoulders, and his lower jaw had been colored as black as pitch, lending his face the countenance of a skull.\nBehind him scores of orcs rushed onto the rise. Nobundo knew that the end was near.\n\"Kra-koom!\"\nThe wall shook once more. The nightmarish orc charged. Nobundo arched back. The blade carved a gash across his chest, rending his armor and numbing his left side. Nobundo answered with a swing of his hammer that crushed the fingers of the orc's right hand, rendering it and the axe he held useless. Then, to Nobundo's horror, the terrifying creature \"smiled\".\nThe orc gripped him with his good hand, and the twin furnaces of his eyes bored into Nobundo... bored through him. Nobundo was forced to gasp for air. As he did, he felt the veneer of his will being stripped away. It was as if some manner of dark, demonic magic was at work, as if a part of his very essence was being obliterated, and it was an assault he had no answer for.\n\"Kra-koom!\"\nNobundo vomited thick blood onto the orc's face and chest. He closed his eyes and frantically, desperately hailed the Light, beseeching it to neutralize the orc long enough for him to mount a defense. He called out...\nAnd for the first time since he had contacted the Light and been graced by its blessed radiance...\nThere was no answer.\nTerrified, he opened his eyes and looked into the manic, fire-pit orbs of the orc, who opened his great mouth and bellowed, drowning out all other sound and threatening to shatter Nobundo's eardrums. It seemed as if he was suddenly plunged into some kind of terrible, silent dream. The beast reared back and slammed its head into Nobundo's face. Nobundo reeled backward, his arms flailing, the rain pounding down, those blazing eyes searing into his own as he fell... down, down, down through the mist, crashing into something large that grunted as it gave beneath him.\nStill trapped in the silent nightmare, Nobundo saw the orc disappear from the edge of the wall. Nearby, the ruined buttress gave way, and a massive section of the upper ramparts fell, blocking out the rain and the sky and trapping Nobundo in a world of quiet darkness.\nAs he lay there, he thought about the ones who had gone into hiding, those he prayed would escape slaughter, those he loved and respected, those for whom he had given his...\n\"Life\". Somehow, he still clung to life.\nNobundo emerged from the black pit of unconsciousness only to find himself trapped in a choking, sightless confinement. His breath came in ragged, shuddering gasps, yet he still lived. He had no idea how much time had passed since... since the wall fell, since...\nHe reached out with his mind. Surely in the tumult of battle he had simply failed to concentrate hard enough to reach the Light, but now, now he could make contact, now surely he could...\nNothing.\nThere was no response.\nNobundo had never felt so helplessly lost and utterly alone. If the Light was out of reach and he died here, what would become of his spirit? Would the Light not receive him? Would his essence be condemned to an eternity of drifting through the void?\nHe had lived his life honorably. Yet... could this be some kind of punishment?\nEven as his mind reached for answers, his hand reached out and immediately brushed against cold stone. He slowly became aware that he was lying in a very awkward position, that some softer but still formidable mass was packed tightly next to him, and that his left leg was most certainly broken.\nHe rolled to his right and took in a deep breath, trying to ignore the pain in his ribs and leg. Without recourse to the Light he could not heal himself, and so he would just have to live with the pain for now. At least the feeling had returned to his left side. And... he could hear the muffled noises caused by his movements, so his hearing had returned as well.\nThe fact that he was breathing meant that air was reaching him from somewhere. As his eyes continued to adjust, he spotted a pinhole, not of light, but simply a lighter shade of darkness than that which surrounded him. He reached out farther, and his hand landed on a familiar cylindrical object: the shaft of his hammer.\nWith what little strength he possessed, Nobundo gripped the handle just under the head, lifted and thrust in the direction of the pinhole. Chunks of masonry gave way, vaguely revealing a cramped passage created by the massive stone blocks and the angles at which they had fallen.\nHis ears were immediately greeted with the sound of muted screams, wails of pure terror issuing from some distance away. He used the hammer to pull his upper torso through the hole he created and into the tight space. As he did, he heard a deep moaning sound from the depths of the rubble behind him.\nWith a burst of strength he pulled himself the rest of the way into the passage, stifling the urge to cry out as his broken leg raked across the jagged stone threshold and sent lances of pain throughout his body. The labored moans continued. The stones around him shifted, and sand and dirt filtered down through the cracks. Quickly he dragged himself toward an irregularly shaped egress, where he spied the faintest hint of light.\nJudging by the increased moans of the thing in the rubble, Nobundo guessed it was an ogre, and it was trying desperately to dislodge itself. Nobundo rolled onto his back and crab-walked with his elbows out into the night air while the ogre made another determined effort. Nobundo could see the full mound of debris now. The ogre bellowed in rage one final time, and the entire mass collapsed fully, sending a cloud of dust in all directions and cutting the outburst short.\nAnother cry immediately followed, however, from some distance away and above: the sound of a terrified female.\nNobundo turned and was greeted by a sight he would never forget, no matter how hard he tried from that day on.\nThe entire expanse of Lower City, lit by the moon and ambient firelight from above, had become a dumping ground for the bodies of the butchered draenei. And though the rain had stopped, the corpse mounds were still slick with vomit and blood and every manner of waste.\nNobundo's heart withered at the sight of children among the dead. Despite their youth, many of them had bravely volunteered to stay with their parents, who knew all too well that the orcs would be suspicious of a draenei city where no children dwelled and would hunt the last of their kind to extinction. Still, a part of Nobundo hoped and prayed with all his might that the remaining children could be defended, that they would stay safe in the hiding places that had hastily been dug into the mountains. A foolish hope, he understood, but one he clung to nonetheless.\n\"Could anything be more senseless than killing children?\"\nAgain his ears were assaulted by the screams of a female, accompanied by taunts and jeers. The orcs were celebrating, reveling in their victory. Looking up, he pinpointed the source of the noise: high above, jutting out from the cliffs of the Barrier Hills, the draenei had built Aldor Rise. There the orcs were torturing some poor female draenei.\n\"I must try to stop them.\"\nBut how? Alone, with a broken leg, one against hundreds... one who had been abandoned by the Light, armed with only his hammer. How could he stop the madness unfolding above?\n\"I must find a way!\"\nFrantically he crawled over the corpses, slipping in the fluids, shutting the putrid stench and raw viscera out of his mind. He worked his way around the outer circle of Lower City, toward the base of the cliffs, where the wall met the mountain. He would find a way to climb up there. He would...\nThe screaming stopped. He looked up to see shadows silhouetted by moonlight. They carried a still form to the edge of the overlook and then swung, tossing the lifeless cargo down into the depths. It landed with a dull thud not far from where Nobundo lay motionless.\nHe crept forward, looking for any signs of life from the female... Shaka, he determined her name to be when he drew close enough to see her features. He had seen her many times before, though they had only spoken on brief occasions. He had always found her pleasant and engaging. Now she lay battered and bruised, her throat cut, her lifeblood drained. At least for her the pain was over.\nAnother scream issued from above, the voice of another female. Rage welled within Nobundo. Rage and frustration and an overwhelming desire for vengeance.\n\"There is nothing you can do.\"\nDesperately he gripped the hammer tightly and tried once again to call upon the Light. With its assistance maybe he could do something, anything... but once again his only answer was silence.\nSomething within urged him to get out as quickly as he could, to seek out the others in hiding, to live... to one day fulfill some greater purpose.\n\"That is cowardice. I must find a way; I must.\"\nBut deep inside, Nobundo knew that this battle was over. If indeed some greater destiny awaited him, he must leave immediately. He would only die a meaningless death if he tried to make his way to the rise. Cries of anguish once more pierced the night air. Nobundo looked over to a section of the outer wall that lay partially ruined. It was a perilous obstacle, but not insurmountable, and it was not guarded.\n\"The time is now; you must make your choice.\"\nIt was a chance. A chance to live and to someday make a difference once again.\n\"You must make it through this. You must go on.\"\nThat long wail sounded again, but this time was cut mercifully short. Then the sound of orcish voices just around the bend of the inner wall drifted to him. It sounded as if they were rooting through the corpses, looking for something or someone. His time had run out.\nNobundo took up his hammer. Though it cost considerable time and effort and sapped what little strength he had left, he made it over the remaining bodies and through the gap in the wall.\nAs he shambled slowly, painfully into Terokkar Forest, female screams atop Aldor Rise began anew.\n- Chapter 2 -\n\"Surely your survival is a sign, a message from the Light.\"\n\"It blesses each of us in its own way. When the time comes, you will find it again.\"\n\"I hope that is true, old friend. I just... I do not feel the same. Something within me has changed.\"\n\"Nonsense. You are tired and confused, and after all you have been through, you cannot be faulted for either. Get some rest.\"\nRolc exited the cave. Nobundo laid back and closed his eyes...\n\"Cries. The frantic pleas of the females.\"\nNobundo's eyes snapped open. He had been here for several days now, in one of the few camps occupied by those who had gone into hiding before the battle. Yet he could not escape the heartrending screams of the women he had left to die. They called out to him every time he closed his eyes, imploring him to help them, to save them.\n\"You had no choice.\"\nBut was that really the truth of it? He was not so sure. Recently Nobundo found it increasingly difficult to think clearly. His thoughts were muddy, disjointed. He sighed heavily and got up from his blanket on the stone floor, groaning as his sore joints protested.\nHe stepped out into the misty marshland air and worked his way through a sodden reed bed. Zangarmarsh was an inhospitable territory, but for the time being at least, it was home.\nThe wetlands had always been largely avoided by the orcs, and for good reason. The entire region was covered with shallow, brackish water; many of the flora and fauna were poisonous if not properly prepared; and many of the larger wetland creatures would eat anything that did not eat them first.\nAs Nobundo navigated several towering giant mushrooms, he heard raised voices: a commotion near the edge of camp.\nHe hurried to see what was happening. Three battered draenei, two male and one female, were being assisted by camp members past the perimeter guards. Another, unconscious, was carried behind them.\nNobundo shot a questioning glance to one of the guards, who responded to the unspoken enquiry: \"Survivors from Shattrath.\"\nGalvanized, Nobundo followed the party back to the caves, where the survivors were carefully laid down on blankets. Rolc laid his hands on the unconscious one first, but was unable to awaken him.\nThe female, seemingly in a daze, was muttering, \"Where are we? What has happened? I do not feel--something is...\"\nRolc came and shushed her. \"Just relax. You are among friends now. Everything is going to be fine.\"\nNobundo wondered. Would everything be fine? Orcish hunting parties had already discovered one camp and wiped it out. And these four, how had they survived? What horrors had the female witnessed? What had driven the unconscious one to his catatonic state? Even more, the way they looked and behaved... Nobundo wondered if their injuries went beyond the physical: they appeared drained, dispirited.\nThey looked the way he felt.\nSeveral days later the survivors had recovered sufficiently for Nobundo to feel comfortable asking them about Shattrath.\nThe female, Korin, spoke first. Her voice broke as she recounted the experience. \"We were lucky. We stayed deep in the mountain, in one of the few hiding places that remained undiscovered... at least for the most part.\"\nNobundo looked puzzled.\n\"At one point a band of the green-skinned monsters found us. The battle that followed was... I have never seen such things. Four of the men who had volunteered to defend our group were slaughtered, but they killed many of the orcs as well. Finally only Herac and Estes were left. They killed the brutal creatures that remained. They were savage beasts. And those eyes, those terrible eyes...\" Korin shuddered at the memory.\nEstes spoke: \"There was an explosion. Moments later a putrid gas filtered into our hiding place, choking us, causing a sickness such as none of us had ever felt before.\"\nNobundo thought of the unnatural red mist and quickly forced the memory away. Herac broke in. \"It felt as if we were dying. Most of us blacked out. When we awoke, it was morning. The upper levels were deserted. We made our way into the Barrier Hills, and from there journeyed into Nagrand, where we were found many days later.\"\n\"How many of you were there?\"\nHerac answered: \"Twenty, maybe more. Mostly women, some children. Others trickled in days later, like the one who lies unconscious in the cave... Akama, they said his name is. We were told he caught a larger dose of the gas than any of the other survivors. Rolc is still unsure if he will ever...\" Herac broke off and fell silent.\nEstes continued, \"Later we were split up and sent to different camps throughout Zangarmarsh and Nagrand. A precaution, so that if one of the camps were discovered by the orcs, we would not all be killed.\"\n\"Were any of you priests or Vindicators--wielders of the Light?\"\nAll three shook their heads. \"I cannot speak for Akama, but Estes and I were simple craftsmen, unaccustomed to wielding a weapon of any kind. That was why we were assigned to the caves: to be a last line of defense.\"\nKorin asked Nobundo, \"When you escaped, did any others make it with you? Were there more survivors? We heard the orcs in the lower levels, but we did not want to risk discovery, so we fled.\"\nNobundo thought of the piled bodies in Lower City... heard the pleas from Aldor Rise, tried to force the tortured screams from his mind.\n\"No,\" he answered. \"There were no more that I know of.\"\nSeasons passed.\nVelen, their prophet leader, had visited them two days ago... or was it four? Lately Nobundo found it harder to remember some things. Velen had come from one of the neighboring camps. His exact location remained a closely guarded secret, in case one of their number was taken alive and tortured. The draenei could not give up information they did not possess. At any rate, Velen had spoken to them about their future, about how they would have to lie low for quite a long time, possibly years, to watch and wait and see how events concerning the orcs would play out.\nAccording to Velen, the greenskins had begun construction on something that seemed to be monopolizing their time and resources. The project had apparently diverted their attention from hunting down the surviving draenei, at least for the time being. What the orcs were building, not far from their base citadel in the scorched lands, appeared to be some kind of gateway.\nVelen seemed to know a great deal more that he did not say, but he was after all a prophet, a seer. Nobundo thought the noble sage must know many things, things he and others were simply not wise enough to understand.\nNobundo watched now as Korin waded into the water with her fishing spear. Something about her appeared different. It seemed to him that her physique had changed in the past several weeks. Her forearms had grown slightly larger; her face looked drawn; and her posture had deteriorated. As improbable as it sounded, her tail seemed to have actually \"shrunk\".\nHerac and Estes approached, and Nobundo could have sworn he saw similar transformations in them. He looked down at his own forearms. Was it his imagination, or did they appear swollen? He had not felt right ever since... ever since that night. But he had assumed he would recover in time. Now he was becoming increasingly worried.\nKorin approached. \"I am finished for today. I need to go lie down.\" She handed Nobundo her spear.\n\"Are you okay?\" he asked.\nKorin attempted a smile that lacked conviction. \"Just tired,\" she replied.\nNobundo sat atop the mountains overlooking Zangarmarsh, eyes closed. He felt tired, tired to his very bones. He had come here to be alone. He had not seen Korin in several days. She and the other two had holed up in one of the caves, and when he enquired as to their condition, his enquiries were answered with unknowing shrugs. As for the one called Akama, he was still unresponsive, barely hanging on despite Rolc\u2019s continued efforts.\nSomething was drastically wrong. Nobundo knew it: he had seen the changes in himself and in the other survivors, Akama included. The rest of the camp knew it as well. They seemed to speak to him less and less, even Rolc. And just the other day, when Nobundo had returned to camp with a few small fish, he was told that they had plenty, that he should eat the fish himself... as if whatever malady was plaguing him and the others could be spread by touching the same food he had handled.\nNobundo was disgusted. Had his service meant nothing? He had taken to spending long hours here among the hilltops, quietly contemplating, forcing his mind to focus, trying desperately to achieve what still remained unattainable: access to the Light. It was if a door had been closed to him, as if the part of his mind that had been able to make contact simply no longer functioned, or worse yet, no longer \"existed\".\nEven simple musings such as these made his head ache. Lately it was becoming more and more difficult to articulate his thoughts. His arms had continued to swell, a swelling that would not go away, and his hooves had begun to splinter. Pieces of them had actually fallen away and not grown back. And all the while, the nightmares... the nightmares persisted.\nAt least the patrolling orcish war parties had grown less frequent. Reports had come in that whatever the orcs were constructing was nearing completion. And it did appear to be some kind of gateway, just as Velen had predicted.\n\"Good,\" Nobundo thought. \"I hope they go through it, and I hope it carries them straight to their doom.\"\nHe arose and slowly, deliberately made his way back toward camp, grateful for the support of the hammer, which had grown so heavy in recent weeks that he carried it head down, using it more often than not as a walking stick.\nHours later he reached his destination and decided to see Rolc. Together they could call a meeting to address the issue of the increasing intolerance displayed by--\nNobundo stopped at the entrance to Rolc's cave. Korin was there, lying on a blanket. She had now transformed so that she almost looked no longer like a draenei, but rather like some parody of their race. She was sickly and emaciated. Her eyes were milky, and her lower arms had swollen to a massive size. Her hooves had sloughed away to twin bony protuberances, and her tail was nothing more than a small nub. Despite her frail condition, she was struggling in Rolc's arms.\n\"I want to die! I just want to die; I want the pain gone!\"\nRolc held her firmly. Nobundo quickly approached, leaning close.\n\"Don't be foolish!\" He looked at Rolc. \"Can you not cure her?\"\nThe priest frowned at his friend. \"I have tried!\"\n\"Let me go! Let me die!\"\nA glow emanated from Rolc's hands then, soothing Korin, subduing her gently until her exertions lessened and finally stopped completely. She broke down into racking sobs and curled into a fetal position. Rolc motioned with his head for them to leave the cave.\nOnce outside, Rolc fixed a stern gaze on Nobundo. \"I have done all I know. It's as if her body, like her will, has been broken.\"\n\"There must be something that can--some way to--\" Nobundo struggled to properly communicate his thoughts. \"We have to do something!\" he finally blurted.\nRolc was silent for a moment. \"I worry for them, for you. We have received reports that Shattrath survivors in the other camps are undergoing similar changes. Whatever this is, it is not responding to any kind of treatment, and it is not going away. Our people are afraid that if measures are not taken, we will all be lost.\"\n\"What are you saying? What has happened?\"\nRolc sighed. \"Just talk. For now. I have tried to be the voice of reason, but even I cannot defend you and the others for very long. And, truth be told, I am not sure that I should.\"\nNobundo felt bitter disappointment in his friend, in the one person he thought he could trust, who was now succumbing to the same narrow-minded paranoia as the others.\nAt a loss for words, Nobundo turned and walked away.\nKorin's condition worsened, and the decision that Nobundo dreaded, that Rolc had spoken of, was finally rendered a few days later.\nNobundo, Korin, Estes, and Herac were gathered before the camp members. Some wore grim expressions; some appeared sad; others were unreadable. Rolc, for his part, simply appeared conflicted but resolved, like a hunter who prefers not to kill, but knows he must eat and is preparing to deal his prey a mortal blow.\nAs it turned out, it was Rolc the camp had chosen as their spokesperson. \"This is not easy for me, for any of us...\" He indicated the stoic assembly behind him. \"But we have spoken with representatives from the other camps, and together we have come to a decision. We believe it would be in the best interests of everyone involved if those of you who have been... \"afflicted\" commune together, but... separate from those of us who remain in good health.\"\nKorin, looking particularly forlorn, spoke in a harsh rasp: \"We are being banished?\"\nBefore Rolc could demur, Nobundo broke in: \"That is exactly what this is! They cannot solve our problems, so they... they hope to ignore us! They just want us to go away!\"\n\"We cannot help you!\" Rolc blurted. \"We have no idea whether or not your condition is contagious, and your decreased physical abilities, your diminished mental faculties are a liability that we cannot afford. There are not enough of us left to take chances!\"\n\"What of the other, Akama?\" Korin asked.\n\"He will stay here in my care until he awakens,\" Rolc responded, and then added, \"\"if\" he awakens.\"\n\"How kind of you,\" Nobundo muttered, his words laced with sarcasm.\nRolc strode forward to stand defiantly before Nobundo. Despite his failing health, Nobundo straightened and looked Rolc squarely in the eyes.\nRolc said, \"You have said that you wonder if perhaps the Light is punishing you with its silence, for your failure at Shattrath.\"\n\"I gave everything at Shattrath! I was prepared to die so that you, all of you could live!\"\n\"Yes, but you did not die.\"\n\"What are you--are you saying I deserted?\"\n\"I think that if the Light has abandoned you, it has done so with reason. Who are we to question the ways of the Light?\" Rolc looked back at the others for support. Some of them looked away, but many did not. \"Whatever the case, I think it is time you accepted your new place in the order of things. I think it is time you took the welfare of others into account...\"\nRolc reached down and snatched the hammer from Nobundo's hand.\n\"And I think it is time you stopped trying to be something you are not.\"\n- Chapter 3 -\n\"It was a mistake to come here. Nothing has changed. You are still Krokul\u2014you are still Broken.\"\nNo. They would listen. He would make them listen. There was, after all, the epiphany. Nobundo forced his eyes from the gathered assembly to the fountain in the center of the small plaza. From that water he asked for clarity.\nHe felt his thoughts resolve into focus. He thanked the water and, leaning heavily on his stick, forced himself to meet the sea of disapproving gazes below. There was a moment of awkward silence.\n\"This is nonsense,\" he heard someone whisper.\nWhen at first he tried to speak, his voice sounded small and hoarse, distant to his own ears. He cleared his throat and began again, louder. \"I have come to... to talk to you about--\"\n\"We are wasting our time. What can a Krokul have to say to us?\"\nMore voices of dissent joined in. Nobundo faltered. His mouth worked, but his voice was lost.\n\"I was right. This was a mistake.\"\nNobundo turned to depart, and looked up into the placid eyes of the prophet, their leader, Velen.\nThe seer fixed Nobundo with a critical gaze. \"Going somewhere?\"\nNobundo sat atop one of the cliffs overlooking the scorched lands. They had not changed much in the last... how long had it been since he first ventured out here? Five years? Six?\nWhen he and the others were sent away to the new camp for Krokul, as they had finally come to be called, Nobundo was angry, frustrated, and depressed. He went to the farthest spot possible in the only direction he was \"allowed\". He had always meant to investigate the hills bordering Zangarmarsh, but at the base of those hills were camps of the \"unaffected\", a region now off-limits to \"his kind\".\nAnd so he ventured here through the blistering heat, to the peaks high above the most desolate wastes on Draenor: wastes that had been lush glades before the orcs' policy of hatred and genocide, wastes created by the warlocks and their twisted magic.\nAt least the orcs presented less of a problem these days. Some wandering orcish parties still patrolled, and they still killed the draenei on sight. The orcs were fewer in number, however: many of the green-skinned savages had departed through their gateway years ago and not returned.\nAs a result Nobundo had heard that his people were constructing a new city somewhere in the marsh. \"No matter\", he thought. \"It is a city I will never be welcome in.\"\nThe changes in Nobundo and the others continued. Appendages appeared where before there were none. Spots and warts and strange growths spread across their bodies. Their hooves, one of the draenei's most distinctive features, were entirely gone, replaced by things that now resembled misshapen feet. Nor was such change limited to the purely physical. Their brains struggled more and more to maintain higher functions. And some, some became lost completely, turning into vacant shells that meandered aimlessly, conversing with audiences that existed only in their minds. Some of those Lost Ones would simply wake up one day and wander off, never to return. One of the first to do so was Estes. Now Korin was left with only one of her companions with whom she had shared that dark time at Shattrath.\n\"Enough\", he thought. \"Stop putting it off. Do what you came here to do.\"\nHe put it off because part of him knew this time would be no different. But he would do it anyway, just as he had done every day for the past several years... because somehow, someway a part of him still maintained hope.\nHe closed his eyes, forced all extraneous thought from his mind, and reached out for the Light. \"Please, just this once... let me bask again in your radiant glory.\"\nNothing.\n\"Try harder.\"\nHe focused with every ounce of concentration he had left in him.\n\"Nobundo.\"\nHe nearly jumped out of his skin, his eyes snapping open as he put out a hand to steady himself. He looked around, up at the sky.\n\"I found you!\"\nHe turned to see Korin and let out a deep breath, shaking his head.\n\"You should have known better than to think the Light would favor you again.\"\nShe came and sat down next to him, looking worn and weathered and somewhat confused.\n\"How are you?\" he asked.\n\"No worse than normal.\"\nNobundo waited for more, but Korin simply stared out over the harsh vista.\nUnseen by both of them, a figure peeked out from a nearby cluster of jagged stone, watching. Listening.\n\"Was there something you wanted to tell me?\"\nKorin considered for a moment. \"Oh yes!\" she said at last. \"New member came to camp today. Said the orcs were... regrouping. Getting ready for something. They are led by some new... what are they named? The ones who make the dark magic?\"\n\"Warlock?\"\n\"Yes, I think that was it.\" Korin stood and stepped forward, standing just a few inches from the edge of the cliff. She was silent for a long moment.\nNot far away, the figure behind the stones departed as silently as he had come.\nKorin\u2019s eyes were distant, as was her harsh voice when she spoke, as if she were not entirely present. \"What do you think would happen if I took a few more steps?\"\nNobundo hesitated, unsure whether or not she was joking. \"I think you would fall.\"\n\"Yes, my body would fall. But sometimes I think my spirit would... fly? No, that's not the word. What's the word... to go up and up, like flying?\"\nNobundo thought. \"Soar?\"\n\"Yes! My body would fall, but my spirit would soar.\"\nDays later Nobundo awakened, his head aching, his stomach empty. He decided to venture out and see if any fish remained from the previous night's meal.\nAs he made his way out of the cave, he noticed that the others were gathered, staring upward, eyes shielded. He walked out from beneath a giant mushroom, raised his eyes, and was forced to shield them as well. His mouth fell open.\nA rift had appeared across the early-morning crimson sky. It looked as if a seam had opened, tearing through the very fabric of their world, allowing dazzling lights and some kind of raw, unspeakably powerful energy to intrude. The rift wavered and danced like an immense, slithering snake made of pure light.\nThe ground began to quake. Pressure built up in Nobundo's head, threatening to explode from his ears. Electricity crackled in the air; the hairs on Nobundo's body stood up; and for a brief, maddening second it seemed as though reality itself was coming undone.\nAs Nobundo watched, for the briefest second the gathered Broken separated into multiple mirror images: some older, some younger, some not Broken at all but rather healthy, unaffected draenei. Then the illusion was gone. The ground shifted as if Nobundo were standing on the back of a cart suddenly spurred into motion. He and the others were flung to the mud, and there they stayed as the trembling continued.\nAfter several moments the shuddering slowed and finally came to a stop. Korin was staring wide eyed at the rift, which was now resealing itself. \"Our world is coming to an end,\" she whispered.\nTheir world did not end. But it had come close.\nWhen Nobundo returned to his familiar spot atop the mountain peaks the following day, he looked out onto a horizon gone mad. Smoke billowed into the sky, casting a black cloud over the land. The air burned his lungs. At the base of the cliff where he stood, a giant fissure had opened. Steam poured out, and when Nobundo leaned over, he could see a faint glow from deep within the earth.\nLarge chunks had been ripped from the desert floor and were inexplicably floating high in the air. And portions of the sky itself looked almost like windows to... something. It seemed as if Nobundo could glimpse other worlds in those windows, some distant, some seemingly nearby, but whether it was real or some trick of the catastrophe Nobundo could not say.\nAnd everywhere, everywhere a palpable silence pervaded, as if all the creatures of the land had either died or scurried off to some remote hideaway. Even so, Nobundo felt as if he was not alone. For a brief instant he thought he caught furtive movement out of the corner of his eye. He scanned his nearby surroundings, half expecting to see Korin.\nNothing. Just his addled mind playing tricks.\nNobundo cast his eyes once more to the nightmarish vista before him, and he wondered if the near future would bring an end to all he had come to know.\nBut time passed and life, such as it was, went on. Reports filtered into the camp that entire regions had been utterly destroyed. Yet the world survived.\nBattered, twisted, tormented... the world survived, and so did the Broken. They ate nuts and roots and what few fish they could find in the marshes. They boiled their water and sought shelter from storms the likes of which they had never seen, but they survived. As the seasons wore on, animals returned. Some of them were species that had not previously existed, but the animals did return. When the Broken were lucky enough to have a successful hunt, they fed on meat. They survived.\nMost of them, at least. Just days ago Herac had disappeared. He had been distant and confused for many long months, and though Korin would not speak of it, both she and Nobundo knew that he had been close to joining the ranks of the Lost Ones. Herac was the last of Korin's defenders from Shattrath, and Nobundo felt for her loss.\nAnd though Nobundo would not speak of it, he wondered if he too might someday lose all control of his sanity and set out into the unknown, never to return, becoming little more than a memory, if that.\nHe continued his daily vigil, making his pilgrimage to the remote mountaintop, somehow maintaining hope that one day, if he had served his penance and earned its grace, the Light would shine on him once again.\nEvery day he returned to camp disappointed.\nAnd every night he suffered the same terrible nightmare.\nNobundo stood outside Shattrath City, pounding his fists against the closed gates while the screams of the dying shattered the night air. In his waking mind he knew that this was yet another dream, another nightmare, and he wondered absently if this one would be the same as all the others.\nHe pounded repeatedly against the wood until his battered hands began to bleed. Inside, women and children died slow, horrific deaths. One by one the screams died out until a final, tormented wail remained. He recognized that cry: it was the voice that had echoed through the woods of Terokkar Forest as he had made his escape from the city.\nSoon that cry faded also, and there was nothing left but silence. Nobundo stepped back from the gates, looking down at his frail, deformed, useless body. He trembled and wept, awaiting his inevitable awakening.\nThere was a creak as the gates slowly parted. Nobundo looked up, eyes wide. This had never happened before. This was new. What could it mean?\nThe massive doors revealed an empty Lower City, the inner walls and ramparts lit by a single large fire just inside the inner ring.\nNobundo stepped inside, drawn toward the warmth of the flames. He looked around, but there were no bodies, no sign of the carnage that had transpired beyond a few discarded weapons lying several feet in a radius around the fire.\nThere was a soft roll of thunder, and Nobundo felt a drop of rain hit his arm. As he took another step forward, the giant gates closed behind him.\nHe heard sounds then, shuffling noises emanating from beyond the firelight, drawing closer. He carried no weapons, not even his walking stick, and the knowledge that he was dreaming did nothing to diminish the danger he felt. He prepared to grab a cord of burning wood from the fire when he saw a female draenei step into the light.\nThe sporadic rain persisted.\nAt first he smiled, delighted to see that one of them had survived, but his smile quickly disappeared as he saw the bloody gash across her throat, the bruises on her body. Her left arm hung limp and useless at her side. She stared at him vacantly, yet something in her demeanor was... accusatory. As she drew nearer, he saw that it was Shaka. Soon she was joined by others, scores of them shambling forward from both sides, their eyes cloudy, their bodies bearing gruesome wounds.\nThe wind picked up, stirring the fire. The rain became a steady drizzle. One by one, the women bent down, retrieving the various weapons from the earthen floor, advancing. Nobundo grabbed a torch from the fire.\n\"I wanted to save you! There was nothing I could do\", he wanted to shout, but the words would not come. His movements felt slow, restricted.\nThe wind again grew stronger, blowing out the torch Nobundo held. The slain women drew closer, raising their weapons as the fierce wind whipped the flames of the campfire until it too died, leaving Nobundo in complete darkness.\nHe waited, listening... trying to hear sounds of their approach through the pouring rain.\nSuddenly an icy grip closed around his wrist. Nobundo screamed...\nAnd awoke. He felt drained, more tired than when he went to sleep. The dreams were taking their toll.\nHe decided the morning air might do some good. Perhaps Korin was awake, and they might converse.\nHe stepped out to where some of the others were gathered for their morning meal and enquired as to Korin's whereabouts from one of the newer members.\n\"She left.\"\n\"Left? Where? When?\"\n\"Moments ago. She did not say where. She behaved strangely... said she was going to--what was the word?\"\nThe Broken paused, thinking, then nodded in recollection.\n\"That is right. She said she was going to 'soar'.\"\nNobundo ran as quickly as his legs would carry him. By the time he reached the mountain peaks, his lungs were on fire; he was coughing up thick green mucus; and his legs shook uncontrollably.\nOn the plateau leading to the cliff he saw her, standing at the edge looking down.\n\"Korin! Stop!\"\nShe looked back, offered the slightest hint of a smile, then turned and pitched forward silently, disappearing into a thick cloud of steam.\nNobundo reached the edge and glanced over, seeing nothing but that faint glow far, far below.\n\"You were too late.\"\nHe had failed once again, just as he had failed to save the women of Shattrath. Nobundo closed his eyes tight and called out to the Light with his mind: \"Why? Why have you abandoned me? Why do you continue to torment me? Did I not serve you faithfully?\"\nStill no response. Only a gentle breeze drying the tears on his cheeks.\nPerhaps Korin was right. Nobundo knew deep down exactly why she had done what she had: she had not wanted to become like the Lost Ones. Perhaps she had found the only way out.\nThis world had nothing left for him. It would be so easy to take those final steps, to walk off the edge and put an end to the misery.\nNot far away a figure stepped out from behind jutting rocks, preparing to call out...\nBut even now, cast out by his own people, ignored by the Light, tormented by the souls of those he had failed to save... Nobundo found that he could not give up.\nThe breeze turned to a gush then, scattering clouds of steam and pushing so forcefully it backed Nobundo away from the edge. In its rushing he distinctly heard a single word: \"Everything...\"\nNobundo strained to hear. Surely his sanity had reached its end; surely his mind was playing tricks on him.\nThe figure near the rocks took cover again, maintaining its silent watch.\nThe wind picked up once more. \"Everything that is...\"\nMore words. What madness was this? This was not the work of the Light. The Light did not \"speak\": it was warmth that pervaded the body. This was something new, something different. A final blast of wind rolled over the plateau, forcing Nobundo to take a seat.\n\"Everything that is... is alive.\"\nAfter all these years of pleading, Nobundo had finally received an answer; an answer that came not from the Light...\nBut from the wind.\nNobundo had heard of orcish practices that dealt with the elements: earth, wind, fire, and water. His people had witnessed some of the powers wielded by these \"shaman\" before the orcs' murderous campaign, but such things were completely foreign to the draenei.\nOver the next several days Nobundo returned to the cliff, where he heard whispers carried by the wind: reassurances that he was not alone, promises, and tantalizing hints that a wealth of knowledge awaited him. Sometimes the voice of the wind was calm and placating; at others it was insistent and forceful. All the while, a nagging doubt still lingered in Nobundo's mind that perhaps he was going mad after all.\nOn the fifth day, as he sat near the cliff's edge, he heard a rumbling sound like thunder, though the sky was clear. He opened his eyes and witnessed a great column of fire erupting beyond the cliff's edge, rising from the fissure below. The flames spread out, and in their flickering dance he could see shifting, nebulous features. When the fire spoke, it sounded like a great and powerful storm.\n\"Go to the mountains of Nagrand. High among the peaks you will find a place... where your true journey will begin.\"\nNobundo considered this, and answered: \"To go there, I will have to pass through the camps of the unaffected, where my kind is forbidden.\"\nThe fire expanded rapidly, and he could feel the heat on his face. \"Do not question the opportunity you are being given!\"\nThe flames subsided.\n\"Walk with your head held high, for you are no longer alone.\"\nNot far away, Nobundo\u2019s longtime observer ducked back behind his concealment. And though he could not hear the elements as Nobundo could, he had seen the flames, seen their dancing features. Not surprisingly, if Nobundo could have looked into the eyes of the watcher, he would have seen absolute astonishment.\nOver the next two days Nobundo made the arduous trek with the wind always at his back, always whispering in his ear. He learned that the orc shaman communed with the elements, but that their connection was severed when the orcs turned to practicing fel magic. He could have learned more, but many times it was difficult for Nobundo to understand, as if the communication was being filtered or dampened.\nAt several points along the route he thought he heard footsteps somewhere behind him. Always when he looked back, he sensed that whoever or whatever was following him had just ducked out of sight. He wondered if maybe it was the elements. Or a fabrication of his mind.\nWhen he came at last to the camps of the unaffected, the sun had long since left the sky. Undoubtedly the watchmen had observed his approach, however, for two guards awaited him as he reached the camp perimeter.\n\"What is your business here?\" the larger of the two guards asked.\n\"I mean only to pass through to the mountains.\"\nSome of the other camp members had emerged, eyeing Nobundo warily.\n\"We have strict orders. No Krokul are allowed in the camps. You will have to go elsewhere.\"\n\"I do not wish to stay in your camp, only to pass through.\" Nobundo took a step forward.\nThe larger guard thrust out his hand, shoving Nobundo backward. \"I told you--\"\nThere was a deafening clap of thunder then, and a black mass of clouds appeared where clear skies had been only seconds before, releasing a sudden deluge of rain. The wind that had gently urged Nobundo forward now gushed with fantastic strength, forcing the two guards backward. Most incredible of all, the wind and the stinging rain both moved \"around\" Nobundo to hammer against the two guards, who fell in the slick mud.\nNobundo witnessed the events, eyes wide in wonderment. \"So this is what it is like\", he mused out loud, \"to have the elements on your side.\" He smiled.\nThe camp members sought shelter in the caves. The guards stared up at Nobundo in fear. For his part, Nobundo simply proceeded forward, leaning on his staff as he made his way slowly through the camp and finally to the foothills on the other side, leaving the residents of the camp shocked, scared, and confused.\nThe figure that had followed Nobundo stepped out from his hiding place behind one of the giant mushrooms. He dared not proceed for he was, after all, Krokul.\nBut the events that Akama had just witnessed planted a seed within him. Ever since he had awakened from his long sleep, he had felt nothing but despair and a needling dread of the future. But to see what this Krokul had just done, to see the elements rise to his defense stirred a feeling in Akama that he had feared long dead.\nHe felt hope.\nWith that newfound hope he turned and slipped quietly back into the marsh.\nMany hours later, racked by fatigue, Nobundo scaled the upper reaches of the mountains and began seeing signs of fresh, verdant vegetation. When his pace slowed due to exhaustion, the wind pushed him on, and the very earth beneath his feet seemed to lend him strength. And though the rain continued, it seemed to land everywhere but on him, and it provided flowing streams from which Nobundo eagerly drank.\nAs he neared the peaks, he heard competing voices in his mind: one low and persistent, followed by the familiar sound of the wind, and finally the occasional rumbling of a fire. The voices seemed chaotic, clashing in their haste to commune with him, building to a cacophony that forced him to stop. \"Enough! I cannot understand all of you at once.\"\nNobundo summoned what little strength he had left and crested a hill that opened onto a lush vista. Here was Draenor as it had once been; fertile and serene, a beautiful garden-like refuge of cascading waterfalls and vibrant life.\n\"You must forgive them: it has been too long since they have felt the tempering influence of the shaman. They are angry, confused, still reeling from the blow dealt to them.\"\n\"The cataclysm,\" Nobundo said as he stepped farther into the tranquil setting. He knelt and drank from a pool of water and felt immediately rejuvenated. He felt his mind open up, his thoughts becoming a part of his surroundings as the surroundings in turn became a part of him.\nThe voice that answered him was at once clear and soothing, strong and robust. \"Yes. I was perhaps the least affected, but it has always been this way. It is a necessity that I adapt quickly, given that I provide the very foundations of life.\"\n\"Water.\"\nHe felt more than heard the affirmation.\n\"Welcome. Here in this quiet refuge the elements coexist in relative peace, and so our discourse with you will be easier, especially in the early stages of your journey, before you have learned to feel our intentions without thinking. True knowledge and understanding will take years, but if you stay the course, in time we will be yours to call upon... but never to command. Yet if you respect us, and your motives remain unselfish, we will never abandon you.\"\n\"Why have you chosen me?\"\n\"The cataclysm cast us all into turmoil and uncertainty. For a time we were lost. In you we sensed a kindred spirit: confused, neglected. It took time for us to recover sufficiently to reach out once again, but when we did, we hoped you would be... receptive.\"\nTo Nobundo it seemed almost too good to be true. But what of the Light? Was he forsaking it if he chose this new path? Was he turning his back on it? Was this a test?\nThe risk would be worthwhile if...\n\"Will I be able to use these abilities to help my people?\"\n\"Yes. The relationship between the elements and the shaman is one of synchronicity. The shaman's influence helps to calm and unite us, just as our influence enriches and fulfills the shaman. When you have completed your training, you will be able to call upon the elements in times of need. If the elements deem your cause just, we will assist you in any way possible.\"\nTrue understanding, as Water promised, took years. In time, however, Nobundo gained an understanding of the life-energies around him. From the largest creatures on Draenor to a single, seemingly insignificant grain of sand, he was keenly aware that everything in existence was alive with a vital energy, and that these energies were linked and dependent on one another despite geographic location and opposing forces. What was more, he could feel these energies as if they were a part of him, which as he now understood, they were.\nThe elements kept their bargain, and aspects of their nature were bestowed upon him. From Water he gained clarity and patience: for the first time in so many years, his thoughts were unclouded. From Fire he gained passion, a renewed appreciation for life, and the desire to overcome any obstacle. From Earth he gained resolve, a steel will, and unshakable determination. From Wind he learned courage and persistence: how to dig deep within and press on in the face of adversity.\nStill, there was a key lesson that eluded him. He felt it, sensed that the elements were holding something back, something that he was simply not yet ready to understand.\nAnd... there were still the nightmares. They had eased somewhat, but night after night Nobundo still found himself pounding on the gates of Shattrath while the screams of the dying rang in his ears. And now when he went beyond the gates and stood by the fire, when the reproachful dead appeared, they were accompanied by Korin.\nHe felt the soothing tone of Water: \"We sense that you are still... conflicted.\"\n\"Yes,\" he answered. \"I am haunted by the spirits of those who passed at Shattrath. Can the elements assist in this?\"\n\"The conflict rests not with the spirits of the departed, but within you. It is a conflict you alone must resolve.\"\n\"Will this inner struggle prevent me from realizing my true potential as a shaman?\"\nA sense of mirth radiated from the pools around him. Of all the elements, Water was the most lighthearted. \"Your conflict is reflected in the sky above, in the ground beneath you, in me, and especially in Fire. It is a reflection of nature's eternal struggle to achieve and maintain balance.\"\nNobundo thought for a moment. \"No matter how far my journey takes me, I suppose true understanding lies in the knowledge that the journey will never end.\"\n\"Good... very good. The time has come for you to take your next step, one that may prove to be the most important of all.\"\n\"I am ready.\"\n\"Close your eyes.\"\nNobundo did. He felt the earth seemingly fall away beneath him, felt the elements withdraw, and for a single terrifying second his mind was back in Shattrath, abandoned and left in the dark.\nThen he felt... something. Something very different from the other elements. It felt immense: cold but not hostile. And in its presence Nobundo felt very, very small. Then, he felt this presence speak with a multitude of voices, both feminine and masculine, a harmonic symphony within and all around him.\n\"Open your eyes.\"\nNobundo did. And again he experienced that sense of diminution, of insignificance as he witnessed a dark, never-ending expanse filled with myriad worlds. Some like Draenor, some great balls of ice and frost, some covered in water, some lifeless and barren.\nAnd suddenly Nobundo understood... something seemingly so simple, yet a concept that had completely eluded his mind: there were countless worlds beyond. This much he had known, as his people had traveled to many worlds before settling on Draenor. But what Nobundo had failed to comprehend was that the power of the elements stretched far beyond as well. Each world had its own elements, its own powers to call upon.\nAnd there was more. Out here in the void was another element, one that seemed to bind the worlds together, one composed of unspeakable energy. If he could call upon this one--but he knew immediately that he was far too inexperienced at this stage of his journey to commune with this mysterious new element. This was just a glimpse, a gift of understanding...\nAn epiphany.\n- Chapter 4 -\nVelen appraised Nobundo with his crystal blue eyes. Nobundo protested, \"They will not listen to me! I do not think this was a good idea.\"\nVelen's lip curved upward on one side. He wore that same expression that made Nobundo feel as if the Prophet was aware of so many things beyond Nobundo's understanding. \"After all you have been through, all you have overcome, are you really willing to give up now?\"\n\"I cannot get them to see me as anything more than Krokul, despite what I may have to teach.\"\n\"Perhaps the true problem does not lie with them.\"\n\"That is what the elements said\", Nobundo thought.\nAs a result of their previous conversations, Nobundo had learned not to try and guess at what the Prophet was thinking, so he stayed silent and waited.\nVelen continued, \"I hear the screams in your mind: the women of Shattrath. I am aware of your heart's burden. You have questioned whether or not your departure was an act of cowardice.\"\nNobundo nodded, suddenly overcome with emotion.\n\"A part of you knew even then that it was imperative for you to survive, to embrace your greater destiny. And throughout so many trials from that day on, never once did you give up. That is why I chose you. Why the elements have chosen you. Our people call you Krokul, Broken, but I believe you may present us with our greatest hope.\"\nVelen extended a gentle hand to Nobundo's shoulder. \"Let them go. Let the screams be silenced.\"\nIt was true. He was not a coward. Part of him had known, but in all that had happened since then, that part of him had gotten hopelessly lost. Nobundo let out a deep sigh, and somehow he knew right then that when he lay down to sleep that evening, the nightmare would not be waiting for him. He felt a sense of joy from the elements, as if they were... proud.\nVelen smiled. \"Now, for the good of all of us, go. Go and embrace your destiny.\"\nNobundo returned to the landing. The gathered draenei were conversing among themselves, paying no heed to the frail figure above.\nHe raised his staff. Clouds gathered from a clear blue sky, casting a dark shadow onto the settlement. The draenei stopped their conversations.\nNobundo called out, his voice carrying across the marsh. \"Watch and listen.\"\nA deluge of rain poured down. Lightning danced between the lamps surrounding the plaza, shattering the glass. The gathered draenei stared in awe.\n\"You have come here to learn. To one day wield these powers: the powers of the shaman.\"\n\"But shamanism is an orcish practice!\" one of the audience called out. Others joined in concurrence.\n\"Yes. A practice they abandoned in favor of communing with demons.

When he charges, he melees and will do approximately 8-10k damage in under two seconds.\nHe charges the farthest person from him. Position the mob such that the healers are in LOS of the tank but not in LOS of the Unchained Doombringer. You can do this by tanking the mob in the archway with the healers off to the side walls where they're in range of the tank.\nAlso ensure that the one of the healers is further away from the mob than DPS. Whilst the healer is out of LOS, the mob will target that healer for the charge but will not perform it. In this way, it avoids DPS from being charged. \nDPS can remain near the tank at all times as the mob does not cleave. This will avoid a charge but you are susceptible to War Stomps which silences for a few seconds."}

Baxter engages about 10 seconds after Hummel, and then Frye about 10 seconds after that.\nApothecary Hummel deals \"perfume damage\" (purple aura) while Apothecary Baxter deals \"cologne damage\" (green aura). Each boss has a short-range aura, and a channeled frontal cone attack. Each also occasionally casts \"Chain Reaction\", a 3-second cast that does a (physical) &lt;a href=\"Area%20of%20Effect%23Point%20blank\"&gt;PBAOE&lt;/a&gt; (not sure if this can be interrupted). Apothecary Frye randomly tosses vials of both perfume and cologne which create color-coded damage zones on the ground, dealing damage unless you are wearing the matching neutralizer. Frye is 'untankable', but can be stunned (unsure about snares and other CC).\nAll three bosses do minimal melee damage, and so can be \"tanked\" by any class. Wearing the appropriate neutralizer (found on the nearby table) negates all of the bosses' damage except their melee and the \"Chain Reaction\" PBAOE. Hummel and Baxter should be separated and faced away from each other, so that the others in the group are only hit by one or the other at a time. Frye should be ignored until the other two are dead; melee attackers will have to chase him down if they cannot stun or snare him.\n&lt;a href=\"Combat%20pet\"&gt;Combat pet&lt;/a&gt;s are not affected by the poisons: it was quickly shown that they could not survive very long if they were, and this had to be hotfixed out a few days into introducing the boss in 2010.\nOriginally, weak adds called &lt;a href=\"Crazed%20Apothecary\"&gt;Crazed Apothecaries&lt;/a&gt; also spawned throughout the fight, and would run in and self-destruct for about 2500 damage after 5\u201310 seconds. These could be killed if they were causing trouble for the healer, although high-DPS (or high-healing) groups would largely ignore them. They were removed from the fight when it was updated for level 85.\nAlternate Strategy.\nIf, for some reason, you insist on doing this with one tank, you should use cooldowns to kill Hummel as quickly as possible, and try to CC Baxter until Hummel is killed. Once Hummel is killed, everyone switches to the green neutralizer and gangs up on Baxter.\nAll party members begin with Purple Buff on, once Hummel is downed switch to Green. Frye will throw both colors so all members avoid poison, poison is what will wipe groups. Once Hummel is down, go for Baxter. Once these two are down, Frye is more or less soloable if one stays out of poison.\nThe random mobs mentioned earlier self-destruct for fairly decent AoE damage, if your healer is having trouble, pick a ranged dps to focus on these. \nAnd remember, POISON WIPES GROUPS. Other than that, the encounter is quite easy.\nAbilities.\n&lt;a href=\"Apothecary%20Hummel\"&gt;Apothecary Hummel&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Apothecary%20Baxter\"&gt;Apothecary Baxter&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Apothecary%20Frye\"&gt;Apothecary Frye&lt;/a&gt;\nQuotes.\nRemoved in &lt;a href=\"Patch%204.0.3a\"&gt;Patch 4.0.3a&lt;/a&gt;:\nLoot.\nHummel will drop \"one\" necklace per kill:\nThe first time each day a level 50-60 player kills Hummel, a &lt;a href=\"Heart-Shaped%20Box\"&gt;Heart-Shaped Box&lt;/a&gt; will also drop for each group member. The box will hold 5-10 &lt;a href=\"Love%20Token\"&gt;Love Token&lt;/a&gt; and may have one of the following items:\nBelow level 50, players will instead receive the &lt;a href=\"Heart-Shaped%20Carton\"&gt;Heart-Shaped Carton&lt;/a&gt;, which contains all of the above items with the exception of the mount.\nThe X-45 Heartbreaker and the pre-Cataclysm versions of the rare items formerly dropped off of Hummel himself, in a system identical to the original &lt;a href=\"Coren%20Direbrew\"&gt;Coren Direbrew&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Headless%20Horseman\"&gt;Headless Horseman&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Ahune\"&gt;Lord Ahune&lt;/a&gt; encounters.\nAs well, the first time Hummel is defeated each year, he drops a &lt;a href=\"Faded%20Lovely%20Greeting%20Card\"&gt;Faded Lovely Greeting Card&lt;/a&gt;, which starts the quest &lt;a href=\"Something%20is%20in%20the%20Air%20%28and%20it%20Ain%27t%20Love%29\"&gt;Something is in the Air (and it Ain't Love)&lt;/a&gt;."}

Oni'jus' poison and assassination skills are invaluable to Sylvanas, and the queen appointed the half-elf to lead the Testing department of the Society, sending teams of warriors and rogues out to capture mortals and Scourge alike to test the vile toxins she and Faranell create. She is dedicated totally to the destruction of Arthas and the Scourge.

{"id": "26565", "revid": "40286632", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=26565", "title": "Applying affine transformations using SetTexCoord", "text": "The SetTexCoord method in WoW's Texture API can be used for some fairly complex display tasks, including drawing bits of circles, rotating images on screen, etc. Unless one has experience in computer graphics programming, the way in which this can be used might not be evident, so this document hopes to explain how Textures work and how you can use them.\nBasic concepts.\nBefore wading too far into the Texture waters, it's best to begin with some basic concepts:\nScreen coordinates.\nThe screen refers to what the player sees. It may go by various different names in some graphics systems (canvas, surface, etc.) but here we'll just call it the screen. The term \"Screen Coordinates\" is used to specify a point in the screen. In World of Warcraft the origin of the screen coordinates is at the lower left corner.\nTexture coordinates.\nA Texture frame is used to display all or part of an image. It has an arbitrary location, size, and scale, and appears as a rectangular area on the screen with vertical and horizontal edges, just like any other frame. We'll use the term \"Texture Coordinates\" to refer to a location within the frame, where (0,0) is the lower left corner, (1,0) is the lower right corner, (0,1) is the upper left corner, and (1,1) is the upper right corner. \"Texture\" will always have an initial capital, for consistency with the name of the frame type in the API. Each screen coordinate within the bounds of the Texture on screen can be mapped into a Texture frame coordinate within the box from (0,0) to (1,1).\nImage coordinates.\nTexture frame elements contain images. These are generally loaded from image files located by file paths. The World of Warcraft user interface engine handles different sizes of images: the length of each side is always a power of two (64 x 64, 256 x 256, 512 x 128, etc.). We will use the term \"Image Coordinates\" to refer to locations within the contents of the image rectangle. The corners are (0,0) for the upper left, (1,0) for the upper right, (0,1) for the lower left, and (1,1) for the lower right. Notice that the image origin is at the upper left, whereas screen and texture frame origins are at the lower left.\nIt is quite possible that a pixel logically outside the image rectangle is visible in the texture frame. To allow for this, the coordinate box from (0,0) to (1,1) containing the entire image is imagined to be extended over an infinite canvas by repeating indefinitely the first and last pixels on each row and column. This will usually give the desired effect, as the pixels at the edge are generally set to the image background colour.\nAn analogy.\nThink of the image as a sheet of infinitely flexible rubber, with a faint set of grid lines rules on it. There's an origin, and coordinates, and the contents of the image file is printed onto the rubber between (0,0) an (1,1) and extends as far as you want in each direction.\nThink of the Texture frame as a rigid rectangular frame, with an attachment point at each of the four corners. The rubber image sheet is attached to each corner of the frame, and stretches between these points. Anything outside the edge of the frame can be ignored; what's within the edges of the frame is what you see on screen.\nThe SetTexCoord method is used to provide the image coordinates of each of these four corner points.\nCoordinate transformations.\nThe way in which the image coordinates map to Texture frame coordinates, and then onto Screen Coordinates (or vice versa) is through a series of \"Affine Transformations\". These are transformations which preserve linearity (points which lay on a line before the transformation, continue to lay on a line after it) and distance ratios (the ratio of distance between two pairs of points on a line before the transformation remain the same afterwards). In the 2D world affine transformations are any combination of:\nTextures and the screen.\nFor the Texture frame coordinate to Screen coordinate mapping there's a simple translation and scaling process, since we cannot shear or rotate on-screen frames, but for the mapping from image coordinates to the Texture frame, the full set are available.\nLogically the process by which a point is transformed from image space to a point on screen can be represented by two transformations T, the transformation from the image to the Texture, and then S, the transformation from the Texture to the screen (I'll go into the math later):\nTexture coordinate from image coordinate: t = T * i\nScreen coordinate from Texture coordinate: s = S * t\nThe S transformation is implied by the anchors, size, and scale of the Texture frame element (and the Frame it's contained within).\nT, and its inverse.\nMost of the time you are most readily able to provide T, the transformation between the image and the Texture, because you want to achieve a specific thing (Say, rotate the image 30 degrees and move it to the left). However SetTexCoord wants image coordinates as its parameters, for the four corner Texture coordinates. In order to do this, we need to create T', the inverse of T, such that given t = T * i, the inverse can be applied to get i = T' * t.\nWith the inverse in hand, we can determine what the image coordinates are going to be by passing in the four corner Texture coordinate values (0,1) (0,0) (1,1) (1,0) in turn and passing the resulting set of coordinates into SetTexCoord as the UL, LL, UR, and LR image coordinates.\nThe math.\nMatrix multiplication.\nMatrix multiplication is written as follows, for the expression b = Ta, where b is (X,Y,Z) and a is (x,y,z) you'd have;\nformula_1\nWhich is then calculated as follows:\n X = Ax + By + Cz\n Y = Dx + Ey + Fz\n Z = Gx + Hy + Iz\nAffine transformations as matrices.\nYou'll note my matrix example was a 3 dimensional coordinate, and a 3 by 3 matrix, this is because a 2 dimensional matrix isn't enough to represent an affine transformation by itself, because it cannot represent translation. The trick is to add a 'dummy' z coordinate, which ALWAYS has the value 1, and then use the following matrices:\nformula_2\nWhich then yields:\n X = Ax + By + C\n Y = Dx + Ey + F\n 1 = 1\nIn this case, A,B,D,E represent scaling, shearing, and rotation, and C,F represent translation. Matrices of this form also multiply together properly, preserving the last row in the correct format.\nSetTexCoord math with matrices.\nT as a matrix.\nThe first step in figuring out your SetTexCoord parameters is to represent your transformation as a matrix. This wont be covered here, but there are plenty of tutorials online concerning the mathematics of matrix transformations. You'll end up with a matrix with 6 variables, in the form shown above, and we'll use those for this example.\nInverting T.\nNot all matrices can be inverted, but for this case with the affine restricted 3x3 matrix, any matrix for which (AE-BD) is not zero has an inverse (This value is the 'determinant' of the matrix, and represents the change in area that a shape undergoes when transformed, you cannot reverse a matrix with a zero determinant because it represents a collapse into a single point or line)\n det = AE - BD\n x = ( EX - BY + (BF-CE)) / det\n y = (-DX + AY - (AF-CD)) / det\nThus, if we were to make a new matrix for T' it'd be as follows\nFinal SetTexCoord results.\nTo calculate the final image coordinates, we apply T' to each of the corner Texture coordinates:\nUL Texture Coordinates (X,Y) = (0,0)\n ULx = ( BF - CE) / det\n ULy = (-AF + CD) / det\nLL Texture Coordinates (X,Y) = (0,1)\n LLx = (-B + BF - CE) / det = (-(1-F)B - CE) / det\n LLy = ( A - AF + CD) / det = ( (1-F)A + CD) / det\nUR Texture Coordinates (X,Y) = (1,0)\n URx = ( E + BF - CE) / det = ( BF + (1-C)E ) / det\n URy = (-D - AF + CD) / det = ( AF - (1-C)D ) / det\nLR Texture Coordinates (X,Y) = (1,1)\n LRx = ( E - B + BF - CE) / det = ( (1-C)E - (1-F)B ) / det\n LRy = (-D + A - AF + CD) / det = (-(1-C)D + (1-F)A ) / det\nExample function.\nThe function below will take a texture t, and a matrix with 6 variables as its arguments, and apply the transformation to the texture using the SetTexCoord calculations above.\n function setCoords(t, A, B, C, D, E, F)\n local det = A*E - B*D;\n local ULx, ULy, LLx, LLy, URx, URy, LRx, LRy;\n ULx, ULy = ( B*F - C*E ) / det, ( -(A*F) + C*D ) / det;\n LLx, LLy = ( -B + B*F - C*E ) / det, ( A - A*F + C*D ) / det;\n URx, URy = ( E + B*F - C*E ) / det, ( -D - A*F + C*D ) / det;\n LRx, LRy = ( E - B + B*F - C*E ) / det, ( -D + A -(A*F) + C*D ) / det;\n t:SetTexCoord(ULx, ULy, LLx, LLy, URx, URy, LRx, LRy);\n end\nApplying transformations is then rather simple. To apply a rotation to the texture, we can use the rotation matrix below (assuming angle a):\nApplying a rotation of 90 degrees can then be done by using:\n local cos, sin = math.cos, math.sin;\n local angle = math.rad(90);\n setCoords(texture, cos(angle), sin(angle), 1, -sin(angle), cos(angle), 1);\nSimple rotation of square textures around the center.\nWhile the above section about matrix manipulation gives a lot of flexibility, most often much simpler math suffice.\nHere's an example of rotating a square texture around its center with an arbitrary angle:\n local s2 = sqrt(2);\n local cos, sin, rad = math.cos, math.sin, math.rad;\n local function CalculateCorner(angle)\n local r = rad(angle);\n return 0.5 + cos(r) / s2, 0.5 + sin(r) / s2;\n end\n local function RotateTexture(texture, angle)\n local LRx, LRy = CalculateCorner(angle + 45);\n local LLx, LLy = CalculateCorner(angle + 135);\n local ULx, ULy = CalculateCorner(angle + 225);\n local URx, URy = CalculateCorner(angle - 45);\n texture:SetTexCoord(ULx, ULy, LLx, LLy, URx, URy, LRx, LRy);\n end\nEven simpler rotation of textures about the center.\n function RotateTexture(self, degrees)\n local angle = math.rad(degrees)\n local cos, sin = math.cos(angle), math.sin(angle)\n self:SetTexCoord((sin - cos), -(cos + sin), -cos, -sin, sin, -cos, 0, 0)\n end\nSimple rotation of textures about their own center.\nIt may just have been a lack of understanding on my part but the above methods did not work for me; Or at least did not meet my needs.\nTo be explicit, I wanted to be able to rotate a texture about its own center.\nIn other words, I wanted the texture to spin in place, and not rotate or move the texture about the center of the UI, or its parent's center.\nThe following code gives a rough idea of how to animate a texture to make it spin.\nBut the basic method can be seen in the :SetTexCoord method :\n local angleInc = 0.25\n function myOnUpdate(self, elapsed)\n self.timer = self.timer + elapsed;\n if ( self.timer &gt; 0.05 ) then\n self.hAngle = self.hAngle - angleInc;\n self.s = sin(self.hAngle);\n self.c = cos(self.hAngle);\n miniNote:SetTexCoord( 0.5-self.s, 0.5+self.c,\n 0.5+self.c, 0.5+self.s,\n 0.5-self.c, 0.5-self.s,\n 0.5+self.s, 0.5-self.c);\n self.timer = 0;\n end\n end\nangleInc has been precalculated as a Radians value - the larger it is, the faster the spin.\nOr reduce the self.timer threshold to make a smoother rotation.\nradians = (pi/180) * degrees\nRotation of textures about any point with any aspect.\nThis function caters to all your rotation needs.\n function RotateCoordPair (x,y,ox,oy,a,asp)\n y=y/asp\n oy=oy/asp\n return ox + (x-ox)*math.cos(a) - (y-oy)*math.sin(a),\n (oy + (y-oy)*math.cos(a) + (x-ox)*math.sin(a))*asp\n end\nAnd use it like this:\n coords={tl={x=0,y=0},\n bl={x=0,y=1},\n tr={x=1,y=0},\n aspect=image_width/image_height\n angle=3.14159/2\n texture:SetTexCoord(\n RotateCoordPair(coords.tl.x,coords.tl.y,origin.x,origin.y,angle,aspect),\n RotateCoordPair(coords.bl.x,coords.bl.y,origin.x,origin.y,angle,aspect),\n RotateCoordPair(coords.tr.x,coords.tr.y,origin.x,origin.y,angle,aspect),\n RotateCoordPair(coords.br.x,coords.br.y,origin.x,origin.y,angle,aspect)\n )"}

When the Old Gods' &lt;a href=\"Black%20Empire\"&gt;Black Empire&lt;/a&gt; was defeated by the &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt;, the aqir were driven underground, where they remained until they were reawakened by &lt;a href=\"Kith%27ix\"&gt;Kith'ix&lt;/a&gt; millennia later. Obsessed with eradicating all non-insectoid life on &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor%20%28landmass%29\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, they &lt;a href=\"Aqir%20and%20Troll%20War\"&gt;waged war&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s, but were eventually defeated and split into three distinct colonies: the &lt;a href=\"nerubian\"&gt;nerubian&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Azjol-Nerub\"&gt;Azjol-Nerub&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"qiraji\"&gt;qiraji&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"mantid\"&gt;mantid&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Manti%27vess\"&gt;Manti'vess&lt;/a&gt;. Armies of the original aqir race reemerged thousands of years later in service to the newly-freed Old God &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe Black Empire.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s embedded themselves in the surface of primordial &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, they soon began spreading corruption around them, blighting and withering the land. The organic matter that seeped from their massive bodies gave rise to two distinct races: the aqir and the &lt;a href=\"n%27raqi\"&gt;n'raqi&lt;/a&gt; (or \"faceless ones\"). The incredibly strong and resilient aqir were employed as laborers by the cunning and intelligent n'raqi and were forced to build temple cities and towering citadels around their masters' massive bulks. The greatest of these holdings was built around the most powerful of the Old Gods, &lt;a href=\"Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;Y'Shaarj&lt;/a&gt;, and this civilization soon spread across Azeroth, forming the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Empire\"&gt;Black Empire&lt;/a&gt;.\nHowever, one day the &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt;, servants of the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;, arrived on Azeroth to combat the Black Empire. The titan-forged were successful in imprisoning the enslaved &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Lord\"&gt;Elemental Lord&lt;/a&gt;s and thereafter turned their attention to the aqir, many of which dwelled in enormous catacombs below the surface of the empire. The titan-forged &lt;a href=\"Archaedas\"&gt;Archaedas&lt;/a&gt; used his earth magic to collapse the burrows, forcing the insectoids to escape above ground, where they found themselves surrounded by the titan-forged. Most of the aqir were destroyed by the titan-forged, though several small pockets survived by tunneling deep underground, too weakened to launch a counterattack.\nWar with the trolls.\nThousands of years later, long after the Black Empire's fall, a race known as the &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s rose to prominence in Kalimdor and established great civilizations that covered most of the continent. One day, roughly 16,000 years before the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, a rebellious group of trolls accidentally awakened &lt;a href=\"Kith%27ix\"&gt;Kith'ix&lt;/a&gt;, an ancient servant of the Old God &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt; who had survived an encounter with the titan-forged &lt;a href=\"Tyr\"&gt;Tyr&lt;/a&gt; centuries earlier. Kith'ix, knowing that destroying the trolls would please its Old God masters, reached out with its mind and discovered the aqir, rallying them into building the subterranean empire of &lt;a href=\"Azj%27Aqir\"&gt;Azj'Aqir&lt;/a&gt;. When the time was right, Kith'ix led the aqir to the surface, launching a terrible war against the trolls.\nThe aqiri threat was unlike anything the trolls had ever faced before. When the insectoids had almost reached the sacred &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Zandalar%20tribe\"&gt;Zandalar tribe&lt;/a&gt; united the trolls into the &lt;a href=\"Empire%20of%20Zul\"&gt;Empire of Zul&lt;/a&gt; to fight back against the legions of Azj'Aqir. Ambush tactics and the aid of the &lt;a href=\"Wild%20God\"&gt;Wild God&lt;/a&gt;s helped the trolls in pushing back the insectoids and even wounding Kith'ix, who retreated with a group of its closest followers to the northeastern corner of the &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor%20%28landmass%29\"&gt;continent&lt;/a&gt;. Knowing that the aqir would soon move to attack outlying troll territories and would simply burrow underground and establish new colonies if allowed to live, the Zandalari sent the powerful &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20tribe\"&gt;Gurubashi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Drakkari%20tribe\"&gt;Drakkari&lt;/a&gt; tribes to track down and eliminate the insectoids, as well as establish new strongholds to guard the distant corners of the troll empire. The Drakkari overthrew the northern aqir, who had enslaved a group of titan-forged &lt;a href=\"tol%27vir\"&gt;tol'vir&lt;/a&gt; known as &lt;a href=\"obsidian%20destroyer\"&gt;obsidian destroyer&lt;/a&gt;s, while the Gurubashi succeeded in containing a group of aqir in the titan-forged prison complex of &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt; through a war of attrition. In the northeast, the Amani succeeded in tracking down and killing Kith'ix before establishing the city of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt; over its corpse.\nDuring the war the aqir ravaged the jungle of &lt;a href=\"Vol%27dun\"&gt;Vol'dun&lt;/a&gt; near the Zandalar Mountains, transforming it into a desert.\nIn a vision granted by &lt;a href=\"Hir%27eek\"&gt;Hir'eek&lt;/a&gt; of ancient times, &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; saw Amani trolls sacrificing aqiri captives. When a priest used a knife adorned with loa symbols to rip open an aqir's belly, Hir'eek himself manifested above the altar and breathed in the aqir's spirit, using subtle wing motions to pull more of it to himself and becoming more sharply defined. Vol'jin interpreted this as Hir'eek showing him the proper way to worship the loa.\nWith Kith'ix dead, the trolls eventually managed to shatter Azj'Aqir. Having successfully eradicated all aqiri presence from central Kalimdor and contained the insectoids in the far northern and southern reaches of the continent, the trolls proclaimed themselves victorious.\nThe three empires.\nThree distinct groups of aqir managed to survive the destruction of their empire. The ones in the north congregated around the underground prison of the Old God &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt;, evolving into the &lt;a href=\"nerubian\"&gt;nerubian&lt;/a&gt; race and establishing the kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Azjol-Nerub%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Azjol-Nerub&lt;/a&gt;. The ones in the southwest remained inside Ahn'Qiraj, where the energies of the Old God &lt;a href=\"C%27Thun\"&gt;C'Thun&lt;/a&gt; warped them into a race known as the &lt;a href=\"qiraji\"&gt;qiraji&lt;/a&gt;. During the later stages of the war, one group had also fled to the southeast. Drawn towards the lingering energies of the dead Old God &lt;a href=\"Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;Y'Shaarj&lt;/a&gt;, these aqir took up the name &lt;a href=\"mantid\"&gt;mantid&lt;/a&gt; and founded the colony of &lt;a href=\"Manti%27vess\"&gt;Manti'vess&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nShortly after the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, the surviving aqir known as &lt;a href=\"Zek%27voz\"&gt;Zek'voz&lt;/a&gt; arrived on Zandalar\u2014now turned into an island\u2014in order to bring the newly-isolated Zandalari trolls into the service of his master &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;. However, he was not prepared to encounter the titanic defenses of &lt;a href=\"Uldir\"&gt;Uldir&lt;/a&gt; and ended up being captured, studied, and finally stored in the &lt;a href=\"Archives%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Archives of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s delved into Uldir in order to stop the rise of &lt;a href=\"G%27huun\"&gt;G'huun&lt;/a&gt;, they encountered and slew Zek'voz, who summoned various Old God servants from his people's successor races.\nVisions of N'Zoth.\nIt was assumed that the aqir had been driven to extinction at the end of their war with the trolls, but it seems instead that they were rebuilding. When N'Zoth was freed from &lt;a href=\"Last%20Prison\"&gt;its prison&lt;/a&gt;, its aqiri servants were unleashed upon Azeroth under the command of the &lt;a href=\"Hivemind\"&gt;Hivemind&lt;/a&gt;. The insectoids are now among N'Zoth's &lt;a href=\"Black%20Empire\"&gt;Black Empire&lt;/a&gt; forces from the realm of &lt;a href=\"Ny%27alotha\"&gt;Ny'alotha&lt;/a&gt;. Aqir are unearthed in the &lt;a href=\"Assault%20in%20Uldum\"&gt;Assault in Uldum&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs a hunter pet.\nAqiri are a family of &lt;a href=\"Exotic%20Beasts\"&gt;Exotic Beasts&lt;/a&gt; added in &lt;a href=\"patch%209.0.1\"&gt;patch 9.0.1&lt;/a&gt; as a replacement for the &lt;a href=\"silithid\"&gt;silithid&lt;/a&gt; family. Despite the name, the only aqir who are tamable as part of this family are the large aqir goliaths. The family also includes silithid &lt;a href=\"Silithid%20reaver\"&gt;reavers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"silithid%20worker\"&gt;workers&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"silithid%20colossus\"&gt;colossi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"kunchong\"&gt;kunchong&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"sand%20reaver\"&gt;sand reaver&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAqir scarabs and winged aqir are tamable as part of the &lt;a href=\"beetle\"&gt;beetle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"wasp\"&gt;wasp&lt;/a&gt; families, respectively."}

{"id": "295234", "revid": "40286736", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=295234", "title": "Aqir and Troll War", "text": "The Aqir and Troll War was a major conflict that occurred on &lt;a href=\"Old%20Kalimdor\"&gt;Old Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, and was fought between a resurgent &lt;a href=\"Azj%27Aqir\"&gt;Azj'Aqir Empire&lt;/a&gt; and the newly-formed &lt;a href=\"Empire%20of%20Zul\"&gt;Empire of Zul&lt;/a&gt;, a coalition of the most powerful &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; tribes. The war began around 16,000 years before the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; and saw the two races fight viciously for dominance of the continent.\nHaving been seriously injured long ago in an encounter with the &lt;a href=\"keeper\"&gt;keeper&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tyr\"&gt;Tyr&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"C%27Thrax\"&gt;C'Thrax&lt;/a&gt; known as &lt;a href=\"Kith%27ix\"&gt;Kith'ix&lt;/a&gt; went into a deep hibernation at the base of the &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt; mountain range. Millennia later, his body was discovered by curious trolls who promptly conducted rituals and living sacrifices to reawaken what they believed was a &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt;. Awakening at these events and promptly slaying the trolls, Kith'ix made contact with the dormant &lt;a href=\"aqir\"&gt;aqir&lt;/a&gt;, who had remained hidden underground since the fall of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Empire\"&gt;Black Empire&lt;/a&gt;. He ordered them to begin to build up their numbers, and they created a vast subterranean empire called Azj'Aqir. Finally prepared, the C'Thrax drove the aqir into a frenzy and urged them to lay waste to the bustling troll civilizations, with the goal of pleasing the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt; and to begin cleansing the world for their eventual return. The aqir swarmed the troll lands and began systematically destroying the majority of smaller tribes.\nIn response to this, the powerful &lt;a href=\"Zandalar%20tribe\"&gt;Zandalar tribe&lt;/a&gt; created an alliance consisting of the trolls' largest tribes: the Zandalari, &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20tribe\"&gt;Gurubashi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Drakkari%20tribe\"&gt;Drakkari&lt;/a&gt;. They dubbed this unified force the Empire of Zul and began to coordinate it against the encroaching aqir. Troll priests were even successful in enlisting the aid of the mighty &lt;a href=\"Wild%20God\"&gt;Wild God&lt;/a&gt;s to assail their enemies. Under the Zandalari's leadership, the trolls succeeded in halting the aqir offensive and began driving them back. Seeking to destroy the &lt;a href=\"insectoid\"&gt;insectoid&lt;/a&gt;s utterly, each troll tribe now began to hunt down aqir colonies and destroy them. To this end, many of the tribes ventured to different parts of the continent.\nThe Drakkari tribe went to the freezing north and engaged a large colony of aqir, who were bolstered by &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20destroyer\"&gt;Obsidian destroyer&lt;/a&gt;s captured from the titan stronghold of &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt;. After much fighting, the Drakkari's ingenuity allowed them to finally defeat and crush their enemies. To the southwest, the Gurubashi tribe had also encountered the aqir as well as corrupted &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt;. Having taken over the fortress of &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt; and enslaved its keepers, the aqir launched devastating attacks on the Gurubashi forces. At the direction of the Zandalari, the trolls began to divide their forces into more maneuverable groups and prosecuted an effective guerrilla war that brought the aqir armies to their knees. Meanwhile, the Amani had begun hunting the aqir's leader, who had retreated deep into the northeastern woodlands. Cutting through innumerable aqir, nearly all of the tribe flung itself in a suicidal assault on the C'Thrax. Although only a tiny fraction of the trolls survived, they succeeded in finally bringing down their mighty foe. This success made the Amani tribe legendary among the other troll nations.\nBefore long, the aqir, while not quite driven to extinction, were unable to continue the war and the trolls subsequently declared themselves the victors. The troll tribes, now far from their original home near the center of the continent, chose to settle in these new areas which they had discovered, founding new cities and empires such as &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Gurub\"&gt;Zul'Gurub&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Drak\"&gt;Zul'Drak&lt;/a&gt;. The various remaining pockets of aqir, now confined to separate areas of the continent, branched off and developed their own cultures as they too formed new, individual empires. These included the &lt;a href=\"mantid\"&gt;mantid&lt;/a&gt; in the south, the &lt;a href=\"qiraji\"&gt;qiraji&lt;/a&gt; in the southwest, and the &lt;a href=\"nerubian\"&gt;nerubian&lt;/a&gt;s in the north. The war, while destructive for both sides, firmly established the mortal, &lt;a href=\"humanoid\"&gt;humanoid&lt;/a&gt; races as the rulers of the continent; although this would not be the last time the aqir and their descendants would attempt to dominate the land.\nHistory.\nThe Rise of the Trolls.\nMillennia before the events of the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, a relatively intelligent and sophisticated race of creatures emerged from the dense woodlands around the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; and quickly proved extremely adept at surviving in their environment. Living as hunter-gatherers, this new race, the &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s, began to thrive in the surrounding forests. Although only possessing average intelligence when compared to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s modern races, the trolls had great agility and strength and their unique physiology allowed them to recover from physical injuries at an astonishing rate, even to the point of being capable of regenerating lost limbs over time. Over the years, troll society developed many superstitious customs, some practicing ritual cannibalism or devoting themselves to warfare. Some even sought mystical and arcane knowledge, often using meditation. A dark and powerful form of magic eventually developed among the burgeoning troll societies: &lt;a href=\"voodoo\"&gt;voodoo&lt;/a&gt;.\nAn extremely spiritual people, all trolls, regardless of their path in life, held a deep reverence for &lt;a href=\"Old%20Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;'s mysterious and elusive &lt;a href=\"Wild%20God\"&gt;Wild God&lt;/a&gt;s, powerful demigods that the trolls worshipped, calling them the '&lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt;'. In their devotion to their religious beliefs, the troll race gradually began to migrate to and gather around a series of great peaks and plateaus south of the center of the continent. This mountain range's importance lay in the fact that many of the trolls' honored loa resided here. The trolls ultimately named the sacred mountain range Zandalar and soon began to develop a civilization upon its slopes. The most powerful and spiritual group of trolls was known as the &lt;a href=\"Zandalar%20tribe\"&gt;Zandalar tribe&lt;/a&gt;, and they laid claim to almost all of the mountain peaks and plateaus, considering them to be holy ground. Upon the highest peaks, they began to construct numerous shrines and temples for their deities. In time, these grew to become a bustling temple city known as &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt; and the other tribes united with the Zandalari. Over time trolls from the lower castes of Zandalari society would leave to form their own new tribes.\nThis period proved to be something of a golden age for the troll race; unchallenged by all but their brethren, the trolls began to expand in all directions. Eventually, although still not having expanded very far from Well of Eternity, various factions laid claim to a particular area, and territories were fully established. As the centuries progressed, several other tribes grew to rival the power and prestige of the Zandalari. The &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20Empire\"&gt;Gurubashi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Amani%20Empire\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Drakkari%20Empire\"&gt;Drakkari&lt;/a&gt; all held large amounts of territories and, on occasion, even challenged the Zandalari in their position as the most powerful and influential of tribes. It was not uncommon for these powerful tribes to go to war with each other, usually over disputed territories or for specific resources. For the most part, however, these wars were benign and rarely lasted long enough for any major conflicts to occur. The trolls were so very skilled at hunting and fighting that any large confrontation would prove to be extremely costly for all parties involved, regardless of which side won. Untouched and unclaimed land was plentiful in every direction, and the various factions quickly realized that it was wiser to resettle or withdraw rather than to risk an open and potentially costly war.\nKith'ix and the Aqir.\nThere was only one location which the trolls were actively forbidden from disturbing by their priests and mystic. This was a dark mound of blackened earth and stone located at the base of the Zandalar Mountains. The loa warned troll priests of severe consequences should they disturb this place, and for centuries none dared to. Eventually, however, a group of curious and rebellious trolls led by the Gurubashi outcast &lt;a href=\"Zan%27do\"&gt;Zan'do&lt;/a&gt; resigned to throw caution to the wind and plumbed the forbidden mound. What they discovered was that the black stones were not rocks\u2014they were the jagged hide of a large and monstrous creature. Stunned and excited by their discovery, they incorrectly believed that what they had unearthed was a loa. They further concluded that this loa must be one of a particular power, as the other spirits appeared to be afraid of its presence. Determined to awaken this being, the trolls performed vile ceremonies and rituals, including living sacrifices. Roused by the ritually-spilled blood, a gigantic &lt;a href=\"C%27Thrax\"&gt;C'Thrax&lt;/a&gt;xi general emerged from its millennia-long slumber and immediately viciously slew those who had revived it. Far from a loa, this being was &lt;a href=\"Kith%27ix\"&gt;Kith'ix&lt;/a&gt;, a being who had survived a major encounter with the keeper &lt;a href=\"Tyr\"&gt;Tyr&lt;/a&gt;, many years prior. Gravely wounded from the event, the C'Thrax had fled southwestward to what would become known as the Zandalari Mountains, before collapsing into deep hibernation. Reeling from its presence, the ancient loa in the region buried the being beneath the earth so that, it was assumed, no other creature would disturb it.\nThe newly-awoken Kith'ix looked upon the troll civilization with contempt; it was but a pale shadow of the glorious &lt;a href=\"Black%20Empire\"&gt;Black Empire&lt;/a&gt; which had once laid claim to the world's entire landmass. The C'Thrax decided that it would be a fitting tribute to the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt; if these nations were reduced to ash. Kith'ix now reached out with his mind, seeking any of the Old Gods' servants who yet lived. It soon found a race of creatures it could control\u2014the &lt;a href=\"aqir\"&gt;aqir&lt;/a&gt;. Since the fall of the Black Empire, these &lt;a href=\"insectoid\"&gt;insectoid&lt;/a&gt;s had remained hidden in small warrens and tunnels deep beneath the ground. Kithi'ix now rallied the dormant aqiri swarms, driving them to establish dominance over the continent once again. As the C'Thrax expanded its power and recovered, the aqir began creating a vast subterranean empire called &lt;a href=\"Azj%27Aqir\"&gt;Azj'Aqir&lt;/a&gt;. Observing these preparations patiently, Kith'ix watched as the aqiri ranks swelled in number. When its host was large enough, Kith'ix led them from their underground lairs and they swarmed across the land.\nAs the aqiri conquest began, many smaller troll tribes hopelessly fell before their tide. Although the trolls were skilled and formidable fighters, the aqiri threat was unique from anything they had faced before, and they did not know how to combat them effectively. Uninhibited, the vast insectoid legions pressed on, penetrating deeper and deeper into trolls lands. Before long, the aqir were encroaching the sacred Zandalar Mountains themselves, at which point the Zandalari moved to act. Through negotiations with the other tribes, the Zandalari united the three other most powerful ones into a single mighty force, which they named the &lt;a href=\"Empire%20of%20Zul\"&gt;Empire of Zul&lt;/a&gt;. The members of this newly-formed alliance would put aside past differences and transgressions and work together to end the aqir threat.\nThe Empire of Zul.\nThe Zandalari themselves took on the role of leading the united troll armies. From their strategic positions in the heights of the Zandalar Mountains, they could detect enemy movements and direct attacks at enemy weak points. This proved highly effective, and the trolls became able to consistently outmaneuver the more rigid aqir. Under the Zandalari's guidance, the other tribes began employing ambush tactics in the surrounding jungles and forests to whittle down the enemy's vast numbers, which would ordinarily allow them to overwhelm the trolls. Elsewhere, the tribes' priests summoned the formidable loa and beseeched them for their aid against the relentless insectoids. These ferocious Wild Gods joined the troll warriors in battle, ripping through the aqiri ranks and even managing to wound Kith'ix.\nThese new actions largely negated the majority of advantages that Kith'ix's army possessed. Unable to properly lay the mountains under siege, the aqir were forced to retreat from the area, suffering significantly from raids and guerrilla actions carried out by the Empire of Zul. Kith'ix, seriously wounded during an engagement with the loa, fled to the northeast with some of its most important aqiri followers. It planned to retire for a time to recover from its wounds, while the aqiri swarm continued its war against the trolls.\nThough the trolls had successfully driven the aqir away, the Zandalari were aware that they still posed a potent threat to the continued survival of troll civilization in the future. The insectoids, if left unchecked, would continue to attack outlying troll territories, and it would only be a matter of time before they once more regained to strength to assault the sacred mountains again; and so, at the Zandalari's behest, the other tribes moved out in force to hunt down the aqir. The trolls soon learned that it was not enough to simply defeat or kill the insects. If any escaped underground, they would establish a new colony, increase in numbers, and rise up again. To permanently end the threat, no corner of the continent could be left unguarded. To accomplish this difficult task, the Zandalari successfully convinced the most power-hungry of the troll factions to establish new and permanent strongholds across Kalimdor. At the forefront of these groups were the Gurubashi, Amani, and Drakkari tribes. After they had fully vanquished the aqir in their new regions, they could lay uncontested claim to the untouched fertile lands that they now lived in. The ambitious tribes listened to the Zandalari and readily agreed.\nThe Drakkari tribe acted first, pushing into the frigid and snow-covered north against a colony of aqir that had retreated in that direction. While they had expected to find numerous aqir, they were shocked and caught off-guard by the presence of corrupted &lt;a href=\"tol%27vir\"&gt;tol'vir&lt;/a&gt; guardians. A small group of these titan-forged had been captured and enthralled from the nearby fortress of &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt;. This particular type of tol'vir, known as &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20destroyer\"&gt;Obsidian destroyer&lt;/a&gt;s, caused havoc among the Drakkari ranks. Their size and stone skin allowed them to shrug off many conventional attacks, rendering them highly resistant to the trolls' normal form of warfare. The Drakkari were almost overpowered by these constructs, but they had evolved to become tenacious and brilliant in their thinking through years of combat. Eventually, the cunning fighters developed clever ways to knock over and shatter their foes, without suffering heavy casualties.\nMeanwhile, the Gurubashi tribe had ventured to the southwest, where they too encountered corrupted titan forged. The trolls soon discovered that the aqir had overrun the ancient city of &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt;, originally built as a prison complex for the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"C%27Thun\"&gt;C'Thun&lt;/a&gt;. When they seized the fortress, the aqir enslaved the resident guardians, the &lt;a href=\"anubisath\"&gt;anubisath&lt;/a&gt; giants who guarded the prison. Early engagements between the two forces proved disastrous for the Gurubashi. The insectoids, along with their constructs, marched on and massacred several large troll forces and razed numerous encampments. Observing the situation, the Zandalari instructed the Gurubashi leaders to separate their tribe into smaller, more maneuverable raiding parties instead of large and easily-targeted armies. This new tactic allowed the Gurubashi to constantly bleed the aqiri forces over the years, whittling down their numbers while remaining impossible to effectively be attacked themselves. This worked extremely well and, although not quite able to wipe out the aqir completely, the Gurubashi were successful in securing uncontested control of the entire region.\nFinally, the Amani tribe had set out to the northeast, their goal to hunt down and destroy the aqiri leader, Kith'ix. They tracked the C'Thrax's trail deep into the continent's northeastern woodlands, encountering increasingly fierce resistance the closer they came. After cutting through legions of aqir, the Amani finally reached the insectoid general itself. In a savage and legendary battle, virtually the entire tribe threw itself at Kith'ix and his remaining forces in a suicidal assault. The C'Thrax, though wounded from the war's previous conflicts, personally slaughtered countless trolls. Only a minute fraction of the tribe survived the terrible engagement, yet Kith'ix eventually succumbed to its tireless hunters. Though it had cost the tribe dearly, the reputation of the Amani became legendary among all the troll tribes for their heroic act. Atop the site where they had slain the C'Thrax, the Amani established a new settlement. In time, it would develop into the impressive temple city of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith Kith'ix gone, the aqir did not fight with the same level of ferocity and purpose. The war between the trolls and the aqir had shifted dramatically, almost unthinkably. Now, determined to never have to face the insectoids' relentless attacks again, the main objective of the trolls became their total extinction. Much brutal and bloody fighting continued for centuries between the two races, the aqir eventually becoming contained within the far northern and far southern reaches of the continent. Central Kalimdor was permanently scoured of their presence. The insectoids, now seeking simply to survive, greatly fortified their underground colonies against further troll aggression. They showed no further interest in fighting or encroaching on troll territories. In time, accepting the impossibility of ever truly wiping out the aqir, the trolls declared themselves the victors and laid claim to Kalimdor for themselves.\nAftermath.\nWithout the war and imminent threat of destruction to bind them together, the troll nations grew ever more distant and insular from each other. The new territories which the tribes now ruled were very far from each other and so equated to relatively little interaction between the troll factions. Although successful in its one and only objective, the Empire of Zul as an idea now began to fade in relevance. The tribes' newly-established strongholds eventually blossomed into vibrant homes, temple cities, and ultimately the seats of empires in their own rights. The Zandalari, meanwhile, content with the outcome of the war and the general direction the troll race was taking, withdrew to their mountain plateaus and cities to pursue spiritual knowledge. Regardless, they would still maintain immense influence over the thriving yet disparate troll societies, having ensured the trolls' continued survival in their time of greatest need.\nLegacy.\nThe aqir empire shattered, its insectoid members now existed in several pockets located throughout the continent. Isolated from the rest of their brethren, the aqir began to become more independent and each group started to develop its own culture and duties. Those in the north were drawn to the ancient underground prison of the old god &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt;. Owing to their proximity to the ancient being, these aqir began to gradually evolve into a new race, the &lt;a href=\"nerubian\"&gt;nerubian&lt;/a&gt;s. They would continue to rebuild in their new home, establishing the kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Azjol-Nerub\"&gt;Azjol-Nerub&lt;/a&gt;.\nSimilarly, those contained in the southwest of the continent inhabited C'Thun's prison of Ahn'Qiraj. They would make the prison-city's deepest reaches their home and, as a result of their exposure to C'Thun's presence, would slowly change to become the &lt;a href=\"qiraji\"&gt;qiraji&lt;/a&gt;. Forgotten by the rest of the world, they would lie dormant under the ground, with the ever-present possibility that they may &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Shifting%20Sands\"&gt;one day&lt;/a&gt; emerge and swarm once more. Finally, those aqir confined to the pocket of the southeast of Kalimdor congregated where the dead old god &lt;a href=\"Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;Y'Shaarj&lt;/a&gt;'s essence still polluted the land. Like the other aqir, this particular old god's influence would gradually warp these insectoids into a unique race, the &lt;a href=\"mantid\"&gt;mantid&lt;/a&gt;. Even before the aqir empire had completely fallen, they had begun establishing a great colony known as &lt;a href=\"Manti%27vess\"&gt;Manti'vess&lt;/a&gt;, near the fabled &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt;. From this base, the mantid would forge an empire of their own and, in the years following the aqir's fall, they would remain the most active\u2014and dangerous\u2014 of the former aqir colonies."}

They are most prominent during the &lt;a href=\"Feast%20of%20Winter%20Veil\"&gt;Feast of Winter Veil&lt;/a&gt; selling Feast of Winter Veil goods, but can also be found year-round selling &lt;a href=\"food\"&gt;food&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"drink\"&gt;drink&lt;/a&gt; outside of &lt;a href=\"battleground\"&gt;battleground&lt;/a&gt;s. \nThe Copperpinch family sells primarily to the Horde, while the Jinglepocket family sells primarily to the Alliance, but in &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt; they share the sales. In spite of their faction specific locations, the Smokywood Pastures vendors are all , and will sell to either faction, if you can get to them. \nBattlegrounds.\nSmokywood Pastures battleground vendors sell &lt;a href=\"fruit\"&gt;fruit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"fungus\"&gt;fungus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"meat\"&gt;meat&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"drink\"&gt;drink&lt;/a&gt; items. The &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Gulch\"&gt;Warsong Gulch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Basin\"&gt;Arathi Basin&lt;/a&gt; vendors only carry &lt;a href=\"food\"&gt;food&lt;/a&gt; items of level 25, 35, 45, and 55, and the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Valley\"&gt;Alterac Valley&lt;/a&gt; vendors only carry level 55 items. The food items require a character level ten lower or above for use (level 25 food requires character level 15 or above), so very early entry characters (levels 10 to 14 going into Warsong Gulch) are not served. Top level participants will prefer more robust fare than is offered. \nThe variety of foods available might be for hunters whose pet won't eat meat, but &lt;a href=\"Wind%20Serpent\"&gt;Wind Serpent's&lt;/a&gt; diet (&lt;a href=\"bread\"&gt;bread&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"cheese\"&gt;cheese&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"fish\"&gt;fish&lt;/a&gt;) is not covered. Pets will consume food above their level, and so can be served. Top level participants will still prefer more robust fare than is offered, although even a level 80 pet will eat level 55 food (with diminished benefit). \nSmokywood Pastures battleground vendors stand in the area outside their battleground entrance. They are not available to characters in the battleground, nor to characters that enter the battleground from another location (but other locations generally have plenty of food vendors.) The battleground entrances are somewhat remote, and the nearest food vendor not at the battleground entrance is invariably a fair hike away, so these guys do serve a purpose for the players who use these entrances.\nFeast of Winter Veil.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Feast%20of%20Winter%20Veil\"&gt;Feast of Winter Veil&lt;/a&gt;, the vendors are paired, male and female, one selling lower value Feast of Winter Veil goods and the other selling higher value Feast of Winter Veil goods. Several also give Feast of Winter Veil quests. The low value vendors in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;, and , also sell unique seasonal patterns. &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; does not have a Smokywood Pastures vendor presence during the Feast of Winter Veil, so there are two more Copperpinches than Jinglepockets. \nWonderform Operators.\nThe s do not have individual names.

However, shortly after becoming the Firelord, he went missing.\nHistory.\nThe death of &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; left the Firelands in utter chaos. The elementals residing there became engaged in an epic battle for supremacy. Eventually Smolderon and &lt;a href=\"Pyroth\"&gt;Pyroth&lt;/a&gt;, the son of &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Rhyolith\"&gt;Lord Rhyolith&lt;/a&gt;, would emerge as the top contenders for the position of Firelord.\nLegion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt; attempt to unite the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Lord\"&gt;Elemental Lord&lt;/a&gt;s once more, and recruit them in the fight against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Upon witnessing the civil war raging in the Firelands, the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Farseer&lt;/a&gt; sent scouts ahead and learned that Smolderon was more willing to work with mortals than Pyroth. The Earthen Ring retrieved &lt;a href=\"Emberscar%2C%20Brand%20of%20Damnation\"&gt;Emberscar, Brand of Damnation&lt;/a&gt; for Smolderon to wield, and then slew Pyroth. Now free to rule uncontested, Smolderon became the new Firelord. In exchange, he would help the mortals against the invading &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;.\nSmolderon sent a servant by the name of &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Scaldius\"&gt;Baron Scaldius&lt;/a&gt; to represent him and to aid the Ring at the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Azeroth%20%28Class%20Hall%29\"&gt;Heart of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Smolderon himself later journeyed to the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt; to disrupt the Legion's control over the &lt;a href=\"element\"&gt;element&lt;/a&gt;s and to request the Ring to put an end to &lt;a href=\"Barastagax%20the%20Flamecleaver\"&gt;Barastagax the Flamecleaver&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; who had somehow been able to use the power of the Firelands, which greatly angered Smolderon.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20Ragnaros\"&gt;Cult of Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; attempted to revive Ragnaros in &lt;a href=\"Sulfuron%20Keep\"&gt;Sulfuron Keep&lt;/a&gt;, Smolderon was missing. A worried &lt;a href=\"Anvil-Thane%20Thurgaden\"&gt;Anvil-Thane Thurgaden&lt;/a&gt; was even wondering where Smolderon was, to which the cult's apparent leader &lt;a href=\"High%20Justice%20Grimstone\"&gt;High Justice Grimstone&lt;/a&gt; only replied \"All in due time.\"\nDragonflight.\nFollowing &lt;a href=\"Fyrakk\"&gt;Fyrakk&lt;/a&gt;'s alliance with the &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Flame\"&gt;Druids of the Flame&lt;/a&gt; and entry into the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;, Smolderon has been shown to throw his lot in with the Primal Incarnate with the intention of expanding his domain and appears in the assault on &lt;a href=\"Amirdrassil\"&gt;Amirdrassil&lt;/a&gt;. However, despite his power, Smolderon failed to defeat the World Tree's defenders, leading to his death. The last of his flames would be absorbed by Fyrakk to empower himself to breach into Amirdrassil's core.\nQuotes.\nTread carefully in my domain, shaman.

Commanded by &lt;a href=\"Rend%20Blackhand\"&gt;Rend Blackhand&lt;/a&gt;, the Dark Horde has not given up the battle to claim &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, although Rend's forces are significantly smaller than &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. A group of &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s drives the Dark Horde, which has not relinquished the original Horde's involvement in demonic &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;. The Dark Horde is essentially still fighting the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, but Rend and his group know that they stand little chance of success, despite their alliance with the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Dark Horde's numbers are dwindling, and it has no means of recruiting new members. Realistically, these evil individuals are well aware that their days are numbered. Such knowledge has given them a grim mindset: they are desperate, bitter, and completely ruthless in battle.\nSmolderthorn trolls revere the memory of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27jin\"&gt;Zul'jin&lt;/a&gt; and consider the &lt;a href=\"Firetree\"&gt;Firetree&lt;/a&gt; tribe acceptable allies, but despise all other forest trolls as deserters, particularly the &lt;a href=\"Revantusk%20tribe\"&gt;Revantusk tribe&lt;/a&gt;, which is loosely affiliated with Thrall's Horde. Ironically the Revantusks consider the Smolderthorn trolls traitors for failing to leave Blackrock Spire and aid Thrall and his followers, for the Revantusks believe that Thrall leads the true Horde. In general, trolls outside the Dark Horde have long since decided that the Smolderthorn and Firetree trolls are insane for allying themselves with the black dragonflight and continuing to fight an unwinnable war (if, indeed, it can be called a war).\n&lt;a href=\"Smolderthorn%20Speaker\"&gt;Smolderthorn Speaker&lt;/a&gt;s can be found in &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn Hearthstone.\nThe Smolderthorn Tribe has two representatives in the &lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt; expansion, \"Rastakhan's Rumble.\" In this game, they are portrayed as having experience with dragons due to working under &lt;a href=\"Nefarian\"&gt;Nefarian&lt;/a&gt; for so long. &lt;a href=\"https%3A//hearthstone.gamepedia.com/War_Master_Voone\"&gt;War Master Voone&lt;/a&gt; copies all dragons in your hand, while the dragon-riding &lt;a href=\"https%3A//hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Smolderthorn_Lancer\"&gt;Smolderthorn Lancer&lt;/a&gt; can instantly kill damaged enemies."}

The show revolves around Snacky the gnome, a hapless, gullible guy who can't say no, and his best friend Angie the night elf, an obnoxious, pushy but fun-loving gal who lures Snacky into awkward and/or dangerous yet hilarious situations in each episode.\nThe format of each episode involves Snacky writing a journal entry which the audience hears in a voice over. This is rudely interrupted by Angie yelling outside Snacky's window, and when Snacky opens the window, Angie talks him into going on an adventure or getting into some kind of sticky situation. At the end of each episode Snacky wraps it all up with another journal entry, which is also interrupted by Angie, and they then continue to bicker while the credits are rolling. \nHistory.\nSnacky the character began as a gnome rogue named Poet on the Gorgonnash server, owned by series creator Jun Falkenstein. When Jun's friends transferred to the Silver Hand server, she moved Poet over there too - except, unfortunately, the name was taken. The first thing that came into her head when re-naming the character was 'Snacky', for no particular reason, except that it sounded funny and gnome-like.\nJun had created several music videos already using WoW machinima, including the popular 'Ballad of the Noob' which won first place in the music category in the 2006 Blizzard/Xfire movie contest. However, she decided she wanted to create a comedy series next, specifically one which non-gamers could also watch and understand - so she didn't want a lot of in-game references. She also wanted to create a show which parents could feel safe about their kids watching, so nothing would be over a PG rating.\nAfter thinking about all her game characters, Jun decided that Snacky seemed to have the most potential for a comedy, as gnomes were just automatically funny creatures. She also wanted a hyper, weird female character as well, and her friend had a night elf on the same server named Anjaleen - so Jun shortened that to Angie and she became Snacky's best friend/nemesis.\nEpisodes.\nIntroduces the characters of Snacky and Angie, who invites Snacky to go murloc tipping in the middle of the night. It turns out that Angie is playing a trick on Snacky, who gets jumped by a tribe of murlocs. In the end, one murloc follows Angie home, and she names him Roberto.\nSnacky feels like he's gaining weight, so Angie introduces him to Scott the Orc, a personal trainer whom Angie has a crush on. After Snacky is put through an abusive workout session, Angie realizes that Scott isn't exactly what she was looking for.\nAngie enters herself and Snacky in the annual Booty Bay Fishing Tournament, which Angie hopes to win by catching a sea monster. After escaping from a tribe of pygmy gnomes in the jungle, Angie convinces Snacky to act as bait to catch the monster - but the plan fails. Roberto ends up winning the contest in a surprising way. \nSnacky is tongue-tied around a cute girl gnome at the Mechanostrider lot and doesn't have the guts to talk to her; but a more forthright Angie does convince Snacky (by bribing him with gold) into going on a double date with Scott and his tauren friend Kaya. During dinner, Kaya reveals to Snacky that she is really enamored with Scott, and bribes Snacky to pretend to have a good time with her in order to make Scott jealous. The couples head to the Darkmoon Faire (which is souped up to seem more like a real-world carnival) and Snacky plays his role to the fullest. It works; Scott takes Snacky aside and bribes him to 'get rid' of Angie - which backfires on Snacky who ends up literally being shot out of a cannon and losing his ill-gotten riches. But in the end he does gain something after all.\nRelated Movies.\nA trailer for Episode 3, featuring Snacky talking to the audience in a spotlight. At the beginning of the trailer we see 'behind the scenes' as a microphone is raised and a troll slates for the camera.\nA collaborative holiday special starring Roberto the murloc, in which he enters a pumpkin carving contest judges by celebrity judges Mojache the Mage, Drewbie, and Macheath.\nMojache is a character from \u00a0'&lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DxeUhSjuhQYE\"&gt;Jimmy: The World of Warcraft Story&lt;/a&gt;' and \".\nDrewbie and Macheath are characters on another series, '&lt;a href=\"The%20Grind\"&gt;The Grind&lt;/a&gt;'.\nCast and Crew.\nThe show is written, directed and edited by &lt;a href=\"Jun%20Falkenstein\"&gt;Jun Falkenstein&lt;/a&gt;, who is a professional artist in the animation industry. \nSnacky is played by Peter Terrill, and Angie is played by Aliki Theofilopoulos, both of whom have voice acting experience.\nMusic.\nAll the music for the main series episodes is original, and written and recorded by Jun Falkenstein, with occasional special guest singers and musicians."}

So while optional, he can be worth the time.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"After the First War, the orc hunter Zigris became infamous for tracking down &lt;a href=\"Refugee%23Exodus%20of%20Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind refugees&lt;/a&gt; and slaughtering them like game. He loathes Blackrock Spire's claustrophobic halls, but he is certain a day will come when he'll hunt in the open air again.\"\nStrategy.\nHe likes to use his gun, so &lt;a href=\"pull\"&gt;pull&lt;/a&gt; him out into the hallway to fight him. Otherwise, he may back up to get a shot and pull in several tough &lt;a href=\"add\"&gt;add&lt;/a&gt;s.\nHe not only likes to shoot you but he also likes to call nearby friends and net you. I suggest clearing at least the top half of the hallway, where you will pull him into for the fight. Also, clear both sets of mobs on the right side of the room. You don't need to worry about the left side. He moves all around the room, so when the he gets to the right side, pull him and move behind the wall down the hallway a bit. After that it's just tank and spank. I did this solo as a 70 combat rogue. I also died a few times due to the group I pulled also called their friends to join in on the fun. So when you pull the mobs pull them down into the hallway. A lesson that took me awhile to realize.\nLoot.\nZigris formerly dropped &lt;a href=\"Quartermaster%20Zigris%27%20Footlocker\"&gt;Quartermaster Zigris' Footlocker&lt;/a&gt;, but it was removed from the game."}

Inside the garden of the Queen\u2019s Conservatory adventures will have access to two types of plots\u2014the Wildseed Pods themselves, and Catalyst Plots. Adventures can plant different catalysts in the plots connected to each Wildseed to infuse that seed with extra strength. Each type of catalyst will provide a different type of bonus to the regrowth process. One catalyst might reduce the incubation time required to restore a soul, while others may influence the amount or quality of the reward cache adventures receive from each restored soul. For once restored to their full strength, the restored deity will show their gratitude with a reward cache, which can contain anything from resources to special cosmetics, such as pets and mounts. Managing the various Wildseeds and plots allows adventures to try to maximize the efficiency of the garden. Learning the best ways to use and place their catalysts will be the key to unlocking the true potential of the Queen\u2019s Conservatory."}

Once the ruler of the &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Empire\"&gt;Kaldorei Empire&lt;/a&gt; over ten thousand years ago, she was entrancingly beautiful and beloved by her people. When her &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; made contact with the Dark Titan &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, she accepted his offer to cleanse her world of the impure, of the inferior races. The Highborne and the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s worked together to summon the full might of the Legion and their master on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; through the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;, but the &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Resistance\"&gt;Kaldorei Resistance&lt;/a&gt; thwarted their efforts.\nThe Well of Eternity was destabilized, and collapsed, swallowing immense swathes of land with it in an event known as the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;. Azshara and many of her Highborne followers fell into the depths of the newly created &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt; and would have drowned if not for the intervention of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s. They forged a pact with &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;, who saved the Highborne by transforming them into the serpentine &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;, a price they would pay by becoming their servants. For ten thousand years, she led the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Nazjatar%20Empire\"&gt;Nazjatar Empire&lt;/a&gt; in the depths, preparing an army to serve her master's plans.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, Azshara split open the ocean as the Alliance and Horde fleet sailed above. As both factions' naval forces were smashed on the ocean floor, she welcomed them to &lt;a href=\"Nazjatar\"&gt;Nazjatar&lt;/a&gt;. The Alliance and Horde had to work together to confront Azshara in her &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Palace\"&gt;Eternal Palace&lt;/a&gt;. Azshara was defeated, but not before she freed N'Zoth from his prison. Azshara was taken to Ny'alotha, where she was tortured in punishment for her defeat before being rescued by adventurers. Azshara has since remained missing, awaiting an opportunity to claim the power she desired.\nQueen Azshara serves as one of the supporting antagonists in ' and ' and later serves as the secondary antagonist in .\nBiography.\nQueen Azshara.\nQueen Azshara was born with golden eyes, which were quite rare in night elves before the Great Sundering. Thus, golden eyes were commonly regarded as a sign of future greatness. Indeed, she was widely considered the most beautiful of night elves and swiftly became the most beloved monarch in night elf history. Strong-willed, manipulative, and incomparably beautiful, Azshara possessed far more magical talent than almost any other night elf. As one of the Highborne and sole heir to the throne, she had long been fascinated with the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;.\nAzshara's coronation ceremony lasted days. Each night, the Highborne nobility lavished precious gifts on Azshara to curry her favor, but there was one she cherished more than all the others. A night elf named Lord &lt;a href=\"Xavius\"&gt;Xavius&lt;/a&gt; presented the queen with a jeweled scepter, etched with delicate magical sigils. He promised Azshara that so long as she kept it close, it would bring her prosperity and great power. Azshara held the scepter aloft, and the jewels shimmered in the light of the moons like brilliant stars. The sight of the queen and her gift was so beautiful that it brought many of the attendant Highborne to tears. One of the first things Azshara did with the scepter was to use its power to enhance her legendary beauty. As the years wore on, the queen seemed to grow younger and more mesmerizing. A brilliant aura enveloped Azshara, enthralling those who looked upon her. The Highborne marveled at this strange phenomenon. A few even took it as a sign of divinity.\nAfter her coronation, she indulged her interests to the fullest. Soon she ordered the construction of a lavishly bejeweled palace on one of the Well's shores. Seeking to please the queen, the nobles proposed that the night elf capital city be renamed in her honor. Azshara graciously accepted, and after a much-heated debate, the city's name was changed to &lt;a href=\"Zin-Azshari\"&gt;Zin-Azshari&lt;/a&gt;, or \"glory of Azshara\". Night elves everywhere celebrated the city's new name, for they loved their queen as much as they distrusted the decadent &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; or the quel'dorei. Such was her charm that her people did not truly consider her one of the Highborne. Azshara was adored by all kaldorei, but she reserved her love only for her Highborne, the corrupt noble elite, who were hated among the jealous masses, for amongst the Highborne were some of the most powerful practitioners of magic. Azshara and her court took up residence in the new palace as soon as it was complete.\nAzshara ordered her Highborne to join the night elf priests in trying to uncover the secrets of the Well. In their quest to learn its secrets, the night elves discovered that they could manipulate the cosmic energies flowing from the Well. Perhaps no one was more suited to this task than Azshara. She was one of the greatest magic users who had ever lived. As she honed her command over the lake's energies, she infused a drop of its living waters into her bejeweled scepter. Queen Azshara's enchanted scepter afforded her great power. Imbued with the Well of Eternity's potent waters, it held sway over the rivers and the seas, aquatic creatures of all kinds, and the life energies that stirred within Azshara herself. She granted it a new name, one befitting its remarkable properties: &lt;a href=\"Sharas%27dal%2C%20Scepter%20of%20Tides\"&gt;Sharas'dal, Scepter of Tides&lt;/a&gt;. Many of the Highborne living in the palace devoted themselves to constant study of the Well. As their obsession grew, these Highborne drew magic from the Well's depths at reckless speed and channeled the chaotic energies into ever-greater spells. The Well was thrown into constant turmoil. Dark storms broke out over its surface, and its waters darkened until they became utterly black.\nAt Azshara's behest, expeditionary forces were sent out to explore the world and expand the fledgling &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Empire\"&gt;kaldorei empire&lt;/a&gt;'s borders, founding the outposts of &lt;a href=\"Shandaral\"&gt;Shandaral&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Then%27Ralore\"&gt;Then'Ralore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Eldre%27Thalas\"&gt;Eldre'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;. Azshara herself oversaw the construction of &lt;a href=\"Lathar%27Lazal\"&gt;Lathar'Lazal&lt;/a&gt;, a temple of &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt; built on the western edges of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor%20%28landmass%29\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. As masons constructed the temple, Azshara shaped the waters around it with &lt;a href=\"Sharas%27dal%2C%20Scepter%20of%20Tides\"&gt;Sharas'dal, Scepter of Tides&lt;/a&gt;. She spoke the names of the rivers and the seas, and they moved at her command. Salt water from the roaring ocean and fresh water from the mountain streams trickled to Azshara's side. With the flick of her wrist, the queen partitioned them into great lakes that hugged Lathar'Lazal's sturdy foundation. Creatures of all kinds populated these waters, and they were at Azshara's beck and call. Whenever she walked the bridges of Lathar'Lazal, nearby schools of exotic fish would array themselves in colorful patterns. She even kept a colossal &lt;a href=\"sea%20giant\"&gt;sea giant&lt;/a&gt; bound to one of the lakes. She used her scepter to make him perform tricks and feats of strength, much to the delight of the watching &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt;. Curious night elves from the far corners of the empire journeyed to Lathar'Lazal to study the mythical creature and his habits.\nThere was, however, one location that the queen sought to avoid: &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, the sacred mountain refuge of the elusive &lt;a href=\"Wild%20God\"&gt;Wild God&lt;/a&gt;s. Unsettled by the Wild Gods and their wild, untamable homeland, the queen publicly prohibited any attempts to expand into Hyjal under the pretense that she wanted to respect the night elves' kinship with the forests, even though in truth Azshara actually despised the mountain and the harmony it represented.\nAzshara also struck an accord with the &lt;a href=\"Zandalar%20tribe\"&gt;Zandalar tribe&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s, who held considerable influence over the rest of their race. Uninterested in conquering the trolls, which the queen saw as a minor nuisance at best, she allowed the Zandalari to keep their sacred &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar Mountains&lt;/a&gt; in exchange for ending troll incursions into kaldorei territory.\nWar of the Ancients.\nOne day, the queen was approached by her most trusted advisor, Counselor Xavius, with an idea of using the power of the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; to cleanse the world, and make it perfect in her eyes. Their meddling with immense magic, however, drew the eye of an interested observer: &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;. Seeking to unleash his Burning Legion upon Azeroth, the Dark Titan entranced Xavius, pulling him under his power, following quickly with most of the Highborne and eventually Azshara herself. Xavius helped the queen communicate with Sargeras, whom she told of her desire to cleanse the world of the lesser races. Sargeras tricked the queen into making a portal from which was launched the first invasion of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; by the Burning Legion, an event which is now known as the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Burning Legion's first attack on the world of Azeroth was located at Zin-Azshari, the capital city of the ancient night elf civilization. The Burning Legion, spearheaded by Hakkar and Mannoroth, quickly decimated Zin-Azshari with no mercy, killing all that stood in their path. The second most powerful and populated city in the night elf empire, &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt;, was next in line to taste the fires of the Burning Legion. Thousands of night elves were slaughtered as the dark Highborne stood safely atop their walls and Azshara laughed at the deaths of her kind. \"Azshara help us!\" \"For Azshara!\" \"Run Azshara!\" were among the few battle roars emanating from the chaos, but Azshara just looked away and knew that her peoples' deaths were necessary so she could be the matriarch of a new perfect world that would be shaped after her own vision.\nEventually, a &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Resistance\"&gt;resistance&lt;/a&gt; was formed, but Azshara paid no attention to their efforts. Sargeras dispatched three of his most dangerous minions to do his bidding: &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20the%20Houndmaster\"&gt;Hakkar the Houndmaster&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth the Destructor&lt;/a&gt; and finally &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde the Defiler&lt;/a&gt;. All three commanded and watched over the Legion and would have prevailed had it not been for the efforts of three night elves: &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; the druid, &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; the sorcerer (twin to Malfurion), and &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; the priestess (beloved of both brothers), and three heroes from far into the future: A dragonmage in a high elf form known in humanoid shape as &lt;a href=\"Krasus\"&gt;Krasus&lt;/a&gt; and as a dragon &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Korialstrasz&lt;/a&gt;, a skilled human wizard named &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt;, and a seasoned orc warrior named &lt;a href=\"Broxigar\"&gt;Broxigar&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome leagues away from Zin-Azshari, in the region of &lt;a href=\"Azsuna\"&gt;Azsuna&lt;/a&gt;, the Highborne &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Farondis\"&gt;Prince Farondis&lt;/a&gt; was far enough that he did not fall under the demons' sway. Farondis decided that the only course of action for him to take was to destroy the Well of Eternity using the &lt;a href=\"Tidestone%20of%20Golganneth\"&gt;Tidestone of Golganneth&lt;/a&gt;, one of the &lt;a href=\"Pillars%20of%20Creation\"&gt;Pillars of Creation&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Vandros\"&gt;Vandros&lt;/a&gt;, a noble in Farondis' court, caught wind of the plan and reported it to the queen. Azshara wasted no time in punishing Farondis and his people. In a frightening display of arcane energy, she destroyed the Tidestone of Golganneth and unleashed a wave of dark magic across Azsuna and its inhabitants. The land was sundered and the resident elves now wander Azsuna eternally as spirits.\nWhen the portal to the other realm was almost open, the combined force of the night elves and their allies from the future (see &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;) charged in to destroy it. Irritated by the lack of order, Azshara approached &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt; and demanded an explanation. Enraged by both his own failure and the questions asked by the Queen, he wanted to rip her head off, but quickly saw the error of his ways when he realized that Azshara was \"a force against which only &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;his lord&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; would prove superior\". Azshara forgave him that mistake and urged him on to allow &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; entrance to Kalimdor.\nAt some point around this moment, Azshara herself was assaulted by a small band of night elves, in actuality adventurers from the future. She used her Keepers of Eternity essentially as living shields to fight for her while using a mystical shield to prevent any wounds to her. She escaped after this skirmish.\nBirth of the naga.\nNot much later, the portal was destroyed and the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Sundering&lt;/a&gt; was upon Kalimdor. Realizing that &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; would not be coming, she decided not to tell her &lt;a href=\"handmaiden\"&gt;handmaiden&lt;/a&gt;s and most loyal followers. As the ocean roared in to fill the void left by the destroyed Well of Eternity, Azshara raised Sharas'dal high. She wove a magical shield around herself and the Highborne, saving them from being crushed by the colossal waves. But it was only a momentary reprieve. The howling ocean soon swallowed the queen, Sharas'dal, and her followers. Their lungs burned for air, and so the queen willed Sharas'dal to let them breathe the water, but it did not. The scepter could not save them. As oblivion spread its arms and beckoned the desperate Highborne, a small fish with strange red eyes seemed to be whispering to Azshara to 'let go' and give up, even as the waves destroyed her palace. Eventually, Azshara's arcane shield failed, and she and her court were swept into the sea. However, something seemed to keep the queen from drowning. The fish began speaking directly to Azshara, revealing itself to be possessed by &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;. Offering Azshara visions of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Empire\"&gt;Black Empire&lt;/a&gt; that it had ruled over in ages past, it offered to save her in exchange for becoming its servant. Azshara, ever guileful and charismatic, convinced the Old God that she would not be a servant, but become a queen to rule at its side. It could either accept the offer or potentially have no servants and be left with no way to free itself. N'Zoth reluctantly agreed, transforming her and the Highborne into &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;. Following the transformation of her and her followers, Azshara directed the naga into forging a new empire with its capital known as &lt;a href=\"Nazjatar\"&gt;Nazjatar&lt;/a&gt;. Azshara herself expanded with hate and rage and transformed into a massive monstrosity, reflecting the malice and wickedness that had always hidden within her core. Queen Azshara offered &lt;a href=\"Uu%27nat\"&gt;Uu'nat&lt;/a&gt;, of her most devoted followers, into N'Zoth's service.\nAs the years wore on, Azshara relied on Sharas'dal less and less. She still treasured the scepter, but she found it was more useful in the hands of her fearsome sea witches. These loyal servants wielded Sharas'dal as a weapon to spread the naga's domain and crush all who opposed them. It was not long before the naga sea witches learned to harness Sharas'dal as Azshara had. With a swipe of the scepter, they drove thousands of aquatic predators into a frenzy and unleashed them against troublesome sea giants. With a whispered incantation, they boiled kvaldir raiders from the inside out and scattered their remains to the currents.\nWhen the sea witches were not wielding Sharas'dal, Azshara would often carry it at her side and reminisce about times long past. She still remembered Lord Xavius's promise: so long as she kept the scepter close, it would bring her prosperity and great power. The queen had lost much, but she was not dead. Far from it. In her heart, she knew that one day her empire under the sea would eclipse even that of the ancient night elves. One day, the world would be hers again, and she would not let it slip through her fingers a second time.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nWhile Azshara does not appear herself, statues depicting her appeared frequently throughout Azeroth and &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, usually in ruins inhabited by the naga.\nCataclysm.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, Queen Azshara was primarily responsible for the troubles in &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;, as she attempted to divert &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;'s attention from &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;. Both &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; could trigger her appearance by killing the four &lt;a href=\"Darkscale%20Priestess\"&gt;Darkscale Priestess&lt;/a&gt;es surrounding the &lt;a href=\"Horn%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;Horn of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt was later revealed that Queen Azshara would like nothing more than the total destruction of the Elemental Lord &lt;a href=\"Neptulon\"&gt;Neptulon&lt;/a&gt;, as it would leave her free to rule over the oceans in his stead. It was also a command of &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;, both for revenge against Neptulon for defying it and so that they could splinter the world's nations into isolated enclaves by halting sea travel. To that end, Azshara personally charged the priestess &lt;a href=\"Valishj\"&gt;Valishj&lt;/a&gt; and her &lt;a href=\"Slitherblade\"&gt;Slitherblade&lt;/a&gt; naga with scouring the coast of &lt;a href=\"Desolace\"&gt;Desolace&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Engravings%20of%20Neptulon\"&gt;Ancient Engravings of Neptulon&lt;/a&gt;, which would grant Azshara entrance into the &lt;a href=\"Abyssal%20Maw\"&gt;Abyssal Maw&lt;/a&gt;. However, Valishj's efforts were thwarted by the combined efforts of the &lt;a href=\"water%20revenant\"&gt;water revenant&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Hydronis\"&gt;Lord Hydronis&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Her past self&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Queen%27s%20Royal%20Guard\"&gt;her royal guard&lt;/a&gt; also appeared as a boss when visiting the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, Queen Azshara sent a force led by &lt;a href=\"Tidemistress%20Athissa\"&gt;Tidemistress Athissa&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;, in order to retrieve the &lt;a href=\"Tidestone%20of%20Golganneth\"&gt;Tidestone of Golganneth&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Azsuna\"&gt;Azsuna&lt;/a&gt;. Azshara herself appeared before &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Farondis\"&gt;Prince Farondis&lt;/a&gt; when the latter tried to save an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; captured by the naga, she attempted to convince him to kneel before her but Farondis fought her off. Before leaving, Azshara told Farondis that her \"wrath\" was coming.\nThe naga at the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Azshara\"&gt;Eye of Azshara&lt;/a&gt; summoned a creature known as the &lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20Azshara\"&gt;Wrath of Azshara&lt;/a&gt; after retrieving the Tidestone of Golganneth. When the Tidestone was taken back by adventurers, Azshara sent &lt;a href=\"Mistress%20Sassz%27ine\"&gt;Mistress Sassz'ine&lt;/a&gt; to get it again.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, Queen Azshara corrupted &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Stormsong\"&gt;Lord Stormsong&lt;/a&gt; and most of the &lt;a href=\"Tidesage\"&gt;Tidesage&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;. She sought to gain control of the kingdom's legendary fleet. In the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20the%20Storm\"&gt;Shrine of the Storm&lt;/a&gt;, she told Lord Stormsong to deal with the intruders. She also had naga attack the western coast and summoned the &lt;a href=\"Pride%20of%20Azshara\"&gt;Pride of Azshara&lt;/a&gt; to attempt to destroy &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Daelin\"&gt;Fort Daelin&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt some point, she struck an accord with &lt;a href=\"Zul\"&gt;Zul&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt;, who was scheming to free &lt;a href=\"G%27huun\"&gt;G'huun&lt;/a&gt;. She also sent naga to &lt;a href=\"Darkwood%20Shoal\"&gt;Darkwood Shoal&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Vol%27dun\"&gt;Vol'dun&lt;/a&gt; to find the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Tides\"&gt;Ring of Tides&lt;/a&gt;, vital to her plans.\nRise of Azshara.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Dazar%27alor%20%28battle%29\"&gt;Battle of Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt;, the naga attacked both the Alliance and Horde on shores across the Great Sea. They dragged &lt;a href=\"prisoner\"&gt;prisoner&lt;/a&gt;s to &lt;a href=\"Nazjatar\"&gt;Nazjatar&lt;/a&gt; to turn into &lt;a href=\"slave\"&gt;slave&lt;/a&gt;s. Meanwhile, N'Zoth maneuvered &lt;a href=\"Xal%27atath\"&gt;Xal'atath&lt;/a&gt; into the hands of &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; and let the Alliance know of this in the Crucible of Storms. Some time later, Nathanos Blightcaller set off from Zuldazar with Xal'atath in hand, and the Alliance fleet in hot pursuit.\nAs the two groups neared Nazjatar's position, Azshara ordered the Tidestone of Golganneth, now in her possession once again, to be put into position. She was approached by tendrils of N'Zoth's power as her order was carried out and assured the Old God that their plans were nearing completion. Shortly afterwards, she channeled a mighty spell through the Tidestone that caused the ocean to open up around all of Nazjatar, and right under the Alliance and Horde fleets, causing them to go crashing into the now-exposed seabed. She then welcomes both parties to Nazjatar. It was also soon revealed that she had entered an alliance with the &lt;a href=\"Ashvane%20Trading%20Company\"&gt;Ashvane Trading Company&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"Priscilla%20Ashvane\"&gt;Priscilla&lt;/a&gt; herself being given a commanding position in the naga forces, as well as allowing her to oversee the production of &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt; weaponry for the naga. She later intervened when Priscilla pleaded for her help, by rescuing her from the adventurers while telling her she won't let Priscilla die before she has \"fulfilled [her] destiny\".\nThroughout the Nazjatar campaign, she frequently spoke to Alliance and Horde heroes to challenge them to fight against her most powerful subjects, and it became clear to both parties that she was planning something that required their presence.\nSeeking to break Azshara's hold on the &lt;a href=\"Tidestone%20of%20Golganneth\"&gt;Tidestone of Golganneth&lt;/a&gt;, the Horde and Alliance united together and used the &lt;a href=\"Javelins%20of%20Suramar\"&gt;Javelins of Suramar&lt;/a&gt; to break the protective barrier around the pillar and kill her champion, &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Zharessa\"&gt;Lady Zharessa&lt;/a&gt;. When &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; began to argue on which side would deal the final blow to her, Azshara interrupted their bickering by formally inviting all of them to enter her palace.\nThe Eternal Palace.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; forces stormed through the Eternal Palace as Azshara taunted and toyed with them. As they made their way to her, she used her forces to test their worthiness (including Priscilla, who she transformed into a hideous, inhuman monstrosity). The factions utilized the &lt;a href=\"%3AHeart%20of%20Azeroth\"&gt;:Heart of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful artifact that has been slowly empowered over time, as a weapon against Azshara's forces. Once she felt the attackers have proved themselves, she invited them to the Circle of Stars to face her.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Last%20Prison\"&gt;Last Prison&lt;/a&gt; was filled with &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; technology that was only partially powered. The Alliance and Horde worked together to fight her until it eventually became clear that Azshara was holding back her considerable power and letting them live for a reason. It was revealed that everything up to this point was orchestrated by Azshara, including manipulating &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; into having both factions work towards empowering the Heart of Azeroth. Once this became apparent, it was too late, as they were trapped and she siphoned the power from the heart to shatter the prison of the Old God, N'Zoth. As Azshara's attention was set on completing the ritual, the Alliance and Horde worked together, desperately trying to stop her. They thought they had succeeded, but as Queen Azshara fell, the final seal that contained N'zoth was broken. She was successful in completing her ultimate goal. Seconds later the titan mechanisms clicked into place, and a flash of light radiated out from the chamber and the magical bindings in the distance shattered. In the black abyss below a giant red eye flashed open and a shadowy tentacle shot upwards. It pierced the dome of the titan facility and embraced Azshara before jolting her back into consciousness. She was last seen before the tentacles brought her down the abyss.\nNy'alotha, the Waking City.\nFollowing the events in the Eternal Palace, Azshara was taken to &lt;a href=\"Ny%27alotha%2C%20the%20Waking%20City\"&gt;Ny'alotha, the Waking City&lt;/a&gt;, where she was tortured by N'Zoth's servant &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Inquisitor%20Xanesh\"&gt;Dark Inquisitor Xanesh&lt;/a&gt;. When &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt; and a group of adventurers arrived to battle Xanesh, Azshara urged them to free her as she possessed the only means of defeating N'Zoth. Upon Xanesh's defeat, Azshara revealed that she held Xal'atath and claimed that she would have driven the dagger into N'Zoth's heart herself had the Alliance and Horde not disrupted her plans. The naga then gave Xal'atath to Wrathion while warning him and the champions that if they failed to kill N'Zoth with their first blow, they would not survive to attempt another. She then declared that she was tired of dealing with \"intermediaries and heralds\" and that she would claim the \"true throne of power\" for herself, before opening a Void portal and disappearing to parts unknown.\nShadows Rising.\nFollowing the defeat of &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt; and the fall of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Empire\"&gt;Black Empire&lt;/a&gt;, Azshara was reported by &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; to be still missing since her escape.\nDragonflight.\nAccording to the &lt;a href=\"Farscale%20Manifesto\"&gt;Farscale Manifesto&lt;/a&gt; found in the &lt;a href=\"Burrow%20of%20the%20Faithful\"&gt;Burrow of the Faithful&lt;/a&gt;, Queen Azshara called her followers from beyond the &lt;a href=\"Umbral%20Veil\"&gt;Umbral Veil&lt;/a&gt;, as she had since transcended the &lt;a href=\"Circle%20of%20Stars\"&gt;Circle of Stars&lt;/a&gt;. She basked in her eternal grandeur, and will return to reign over sea and sky and earth.\nIn the RPG.\nAzshara is often thought to be the greatest mortal &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; ever to live - although she may no longer be mortal. Azshara was considered to be one of the greatest &lt;a href=\"sorcerer\"&gt;sorcerer&lt;/a&gt;s as she was gifted with knowledge about magic without studying any treatises. As such, she was crowned the Sorceress-Queen of Kalimdor.\nAzshara has become an Ancient and lurks beneath the waves, biding her time to reclaim her worldly power. Queen Azshara was not drowned, but transformed into a hideous aquatic thing who will someday lead her accursed followers to retake the surface world. Queen Azshara, her handmaidens, and many Highborne sunk into the sea. The Old Gods chose Azshara as another useful tool and transformed her, her Highborne, and her Handmaidens into Naga. The mighty Queen Azshara still lives and rules the naga. Once she awoke at the bottom of the sea, she ordered a palace built to rival her home in Azshara.\nQueen Azshara lives still, in the vast city of &lt;a href=\"Nazjatar\"&gt;Nazjatar&lt;/a&gt; at the bottom of a deep ocean trench. She has embraced the power of the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;, grown in size, and possesses many tentacles bedecked in jewels and items of power. She plots her revenge on the treacherous &lt;a href=\"Night%20Elves\"&gt;Night Elves&lt;/a&gt;, biding her time until the growing might of the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; can be brought to bear. Living under the sea, she has become the queen of the naga. The naga serve Azshara without question. Most naga live in Nazjatar, their capital city. This city is built into a massive abyssal sea trench in the ocean floor, and houses Azshara's imperial palace.\nThe creature moves on five slithering, octopus-like tentacles, its massive round and bulbous body shifting constantly. A humanoid torso covered in thick scales rises from the body, the creature reaching at least 20 feet in height. Four arms extend from the torso, with two hands holding javelins of dark polished wood and gold-leafed tips. Despite the monstrosity of its body, the creature's face still possesses an otherworldly, feminine, almost elven beauty. Snakes writhe about her head, serving as her hair and as further eyes. A cruel smile plays across her lips, as though she is deciding whether to play with her enemies a moment longer or simply destroy them now. \"&lt;a href=\"Shadows%20%26amp%3B%20Light\"&gt;Shadows &amp; Light&lt;/a&gt;\" suggests that Azshara's altered body is with octopus-like tentacles quite different from those of ordinary naga.\nWhen Azshara finally decided to make the naga's existence known, she sent &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Vashj\"&gt;Lady Vashj&lt;/a&gt; to establish contact with the surface dwellers. She yet seeks revenge against the night elves who defeated her, slowly readying her naga subjects in Nazjatar to show their might to all of Azeroth. The world grows wary of what the changed Queen Azshara may attempt in the coming future.\nShe imbued &lt;a href=\"Frostfathom\"&gt;Frostfathom&lt;/a&gt; with its icy burst quality, making it even deadlier for her favored agent to wield.\nJavelins of Suramar.\n&lt;a href=\"Javelins%20of%20Suramar\"&gt;Javelins of Suramar&lt;/a&gt; were wielded by Azshara in the &lt;a href=\"Azshara%27s%20Palace\"&gt;Eternal Palace&lt;/a&gt;, and she wields them still in &lt;a href=\"Nazjatar\"&gt;Nazjatar&lt;/a&gt; as queen of the naga.\nPotential fate.\nIn a desperate gamble, the Alliance was planning to outfit hundreds of their best and brightest with the magic and technological items necessary to survive underwater. With the help of some allied &lt;a href=\"makrura\"&gt;makrura&lt;/a&gt;, they planned to stage an attack on &lt;a href=\"Nazjatar\"&gt;Nazjatar&lt;/a&gt;. However, the attack would simply be a distraction in order to allow a small group of adventurers to enter the city, steal into the palace, overcome Queen Azshara's defenses, capture her, and return her to the surface. The Alliance plans to either siphon the captured queen's &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; powers or use her to enlist the help of the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;.\nPersonality and powers.\nCharismatic and beautiful, Azshara outwardly portrayed herself as a kind, generous, loving monarch who adored her people and her empire with all her heart. In truth, however, she was a vain, cruel, power-hungry narcissist who cared for herself above all else. An intensely manipulative individual, she fostered her own benevolent image solely so she could take complete advantage of it. Although she did hold favor for her Highborne and handmaidens, it was not out of love, respect, or any form of benevolence. It was purely out of how useful they were to her. She never hesitated to throw their lives away if it suited her, and such was her power and charms that they would do so for her gladly, completely unaware of her indifference. She held very little loyalty either, as she freely gave her allegiance to the Old Gods so she could survive the Sundering when she had been one of the most devout servants of Sargeras mere moments before (and whom she considered to be the only worthy potential mate). Of particular note, however, is despite her cruel and dominating personality, she rarely ever raised her voice when angry or made direct insults of her minions.\nPerhaps Azshara's greatest ability was her immense charisma and stunning beauty, the latter of which she augmented further through mystical means. Such was her physical and mental appeal that none ever noticed her true personality, no matter how cruel or destructive her commands might be. The vast majority of her servitors were willing to go to any means to elevate themselves in her eyes, even at the cost of their own lives. Demons who were around her long enough fell prey to her wiles and would kill their own kin under her command. &lt;a href=\"Xavius\"&gt;Xavius&lt;/a&gt;, who considered himself above her charms, was, in fact, completely enamored. Incredibly vain, Azshara surrounds herself with opulence and wealth, her throne room a sealed, air-filled chamber (not underwater, as might be practical for a naga) simply so it can be decorated with elaborate fountains and waterfalls, one of them used like a mirror. She goes so far as to admit she could drown the heroes at any time by simply canceling the Tidestone's spell, but does not simply out of desire for them to amuse her.\nHowever, Azshara was much, much more than a pretty face. She was one of the most powerful mages to ever walk the face of Azeroth, wielding the arcane with such skill that she is known to have even been able to suppress her magical glow, as proved when Illidan noticed her intensifying it after receiving his new eyes. With barely an effort she shielded her palace from the Sundering, and alter her own body to increase her beauty. So great was her power that when &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt;, once growing enraged at her questioning him, attempted to kill her he realized, to his chagrin, that Azshara was far more powerful than he, and that only &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; would prove superior. This power which she achieved on her own was before she was empowered by N'Zoth and became the queen of the naga. She seemingly also gained mastery over shadow magic, as she was able to teleport from Ny'alotha using a void portal. &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; would later refer to her as perhaps the greatest sorceress the world of Azeroth had ever known.\nAppearance.\nAs a night elf.\nQueen Azshara was tall - even taller than many men, and she moved with a grace that even a cat would envy her, with great pride and grace. She spoke with a voice so enchanting it could send any man running into his certain death. Her skin was a deep blue, and her long, luscious hair cascaded as silver down her shoulders and back. Her eyes were golden and, as with other night elves, without pupils in them.\nThis description did not, however, fit how she was modeled in the previews of her appearance in the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; instance in &lt;a href=\"patch%204.3.0\"&gt;patch 4.3.0&lt;/a&gt;, where she was displayed with dark blue hair, rather than moonlight silver, blue eyes, rather than golden, and a skin tone that's almost gray, rather than deep violet. Nor was her hair cascading, as Richard Knaak describes her several times in &lt;a href=\"The%20Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;The Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; book, but rather appeared tied up in an elaborate knot. It appeared to be based on a popular piece of fan art, seen below. This, however, was later changed and Azshara got a brand new texture fitting the description of the novel.\nAs a naga.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; found the statue of Azshara in the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, she noticed that the queen resembled a night elf but with a snake-like tail. Not mentioned, it also had an extra set of arms. During flashbacks in the mission, statues like this appear more night elven, and gold in color, and morph during scene transitions.\nIn \"World of Warcraft\", statues of the queen depict her as a normal female naga.\nWhen Tyrande attempted to rescue Malfurion during the &lt;a href=\"War%20Against%20the%20Nightmare\"&gt;War Against the Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; produced a hallucination of Azshara (playing on Tyrande's fears of becoming like the evil queen):\nIn Darkshore and Azsuna, Azshara is seen projecting a sort of avatar or image herself to oversee her plans in the regions. This image resembles her handmaidens, and in the latter zone she alters its appearance to resemble her original night elf form.\nShe finally appears in her true form in official art surrounding \"Battle for Azeroth\" and as a hologram speaking to Lord Stormsong in the Shrine of the Storm. Here she resembles the description given in the pen and paper RPG; a monstrous creature melding a naga torso with the tentacles of a squid (or possibly a kraken) from the waist down, multiple arms, one wielding a spear. She also possesses three eyes, and her \"hair\" resembles the tentacles of a sea anemone, rather than snakes.\nPlaque.\nA statue of Queen Azshara is located in the &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Dormir%20Gardens\"&gt;Quel'Dormir Gardens&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Shimmering%20Expanse\"&gt;Shimmering Expanse&lt;/a&gt;.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

She now watches her most trusted magi empower the portal where Sargeras will be brought into Azeroth, content to let multitudes of her servants die in advance of the Dark Titan's arrival.\"\nEncounter.\nEnchanted Magi.\nQueen Azshara commands two of her six Enchanted Magi to attack the players. When the players defeat an Enchanted Magus or enough time elapses, another two Magi enter combat. Each Enchanted Magi possess one of three schools of magic. When the players defeat all of the Enchanted Magi, Queen Azshara retreats from combat and the players complete the encounter.\nStrategy.\nAzshara herself is shielded from all damage, so DPS against her is pointless.\nThe absolute priority in this fight is to interrupt Dance, puppets! before Azshara finishes casting. If she completes the cast it wipes the party. Fortunately, she does not cast this often. The easiest thing to do is for a player with a ranged interrupt to /focus Azshara and watch for the casting bar. If no ranged interrupts are available, the tank should collect mobs near Azshara so a melee interrupter can quickly switch and interrupt the cast.\nA less urgent (but still important) concern is You are mine now! which mind-controls a party member. All DPS should switch to the hand-shaped mob above the victim's head and kill it. This frees the victim.\nThe rest of the time the the party should be blasting the Enchanted Magi that activate throughout the fight. Two activate at the start, and as each one is killed, a new one activates and must be picked up by the tank. Some of the magi abilities are interruptible, but make sure you have a cooldown available to interrupt Dance puppets!\nOnce all Magi are dead, Azshara leaves and the players may collect loot from a chest."}

It is the larger of the two major concentrations of high elves in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; and is one of the very last high elven settlements.\nHistory.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Loania\"&gt;Loania&lt;/a&gt; grew up here, being raised by &lt;a href=\"Voldana\"&gt;Voldana&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nThe lodge was used as a center of communication for the high elves of the &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt;. Their ambassadors were working to establish relationships with &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;other races&lt;/a&gt;, with whom they shared their knowledge of the &lt;a href=\"Witherbark%20tribe\"&gt;Witherbark trolls&lt;/a&gt; that inhabit the area in the southern Hinterlands.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the high elves of Quel'Danil struck an alliance with the &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20dwarf\"&gt;Wildhammer dwarves&lt;/a&gt;, much to the ire of their common enemy, the &lt;a href=\"Revantusk\"&gt;Revantusk&lt;/a&gt; trolls. &lt;a href=\"Otho%20Moji%27ko\"&gt;Otho Moji'ko&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Revantusk%20Tribe\"&gt;Revantusk Tribe&lt;/a&gt; instructs &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to slaughter as many Highvale elves as possible. After freeing the Witherbark troll &lt;a href=\"Rin%27ji\"&gt;Rin'ji&lt;/a&gt; and being pointed to an ancient tablet as reward, &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s delivered it to &lt;a href=\"Oran%20Snakewrithe\"&gt;Oran Snakewrithe&lt;/a&gt;, a well known scholar on matters concerning Rin'ji's kind. She enlisted the same adventurers to burn documents that recorded the Highvale elves' communications with the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;other races&lt;/a&gt; and other information. However, Oran's and Otho's actions were unsuccessful, as the Highvale elves still retained the documents, which also included deaths, births and seasons.\nCataclysm.\nAt some point, a group of young draenei moved into the &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt; under the lead of &lt;a href=\"Ambassador%20Rualeth\"&gt;Ambassador Rualeth&lt;/a&gt;. While some of them are seen in the &lt;a href=\"Aerie%20Peak\"&gt;Aerie Peak&lt;/a&gt;, others moved to the Quel'Danil lodge.\nAs part of the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; offensive in all the continent, the lodge came under attack. With the help of adventurers, the Highvale high elves and the draenei settlers were able to repel the &lt;a href=\"Deathstalker%20Invader\"&gt;invaders&lt;/a&gt;. The Highvale documents were also retrieved from the chaos by Alliance adventurers and safely delivered to Anchorite Traska.\nInhabitants.\nHigh elves.\nThe high elves that live in the lodge are referred as \"Highvale\" elves. This could mean that Quel'Danil means \"High Vale\", given that \"quel\" means \"high\" in Thalassian. After the loss of the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;, the Quel'Danil elves decided to stop practicing magic altogether. Named quel'dorei inhabitants are &lt;a href=\"Voldana\"&gt;Voldana&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ravic\"&gt;Ravic&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Jalinde%20Summerdrake\"&gt;Jalinde Summerdrake&lt;/a&gt; is assumed to be one of its leaders.\nWhile the high elven race, for the most part, lost access to &lt;a href=\"dragonhawk\"&gt;dragonhawk&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"mount\"&gt;mount&lt;/a&gt;s with the split from &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt;, Quel'Danil Lodge apparently has managed to maintain their own supply of dragonhawks.\nDraenei.\nLed by &lt;a href=\"Ambassador%20Rualeth\"&gt;Ambassador Rualeth&lt;/a&gt;, quite a few young draenei (&lt;a href=\"Tracker%20Yoro\"&gt;Tracker Yoro&lt;/a&gt; among them) settled in Quel'Danil to train in the ways of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; and enjoy the peaceful beauty of &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands\"&gt;the land&lt;/a&gt;. They are under the charge of &lt;a href=\"Anchorite%20Traska\"&gt;Anchorite Traska&lt;/a&gt;.\nArchitecture.\nWhile Quel'Danil Lodge has a kaldorei-like wooden architecture in-game, the mangas depict it with traditional quel'dorei/sin'dorei architecture.\nNPCs.\n\"The following NPCs are only seen during &lt;a href=\"In%20Defense%20of%20Quel%27Danil\"&gt;In Defense of Quel'Danil&lt;/a&gt;\"\nIn the RPG.\nQuel'Danil Lodge is a &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elven&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;'s lodge located in the &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt;, near &lt;a href=\"Aerie%20Peak\"&gt;Aerie Peak&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Saldor%20Shallowbrook\"&gt;Saldor Shallowbrook&lt;/a&gt;, an aged, placid high elf, oversees it. A connection between the elves and the &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; formed, probably due to something about nature and wildness. Several high elves live in Aerie Peak and maintain good relations with the dwarves. In &lt;a href=\"Thalassian\"&gt;Thalassian&lt;/a&gt; Quel'Danil means \"High Peak\".\nIt acts as an embassy of sorts to continue the remaining high elves' diplomatic relations with other races."}

It housed a number of elven documents, even some pertaining to the &lt;a href=\"Sunstrider%20dynasty\"&gt;royal family&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Ranger-General%20of%20Silvermoon\"&gt;Ranger-General of Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;.\nThird War and aftermath.\nThe lodge fell on hard times following the &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20invasion%20of%20Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Scourge invasion of Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;. It was here that the banished &lt;a href=\"Elven%20ranger\"&gt;rangers&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Renthar%20Hawkspear\"&gt;Renthar Hawkspear&lt;/a&gt; took up residence after &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Rommath\"&gt;Grand Magister Rommath&lt;/a&gt;'s return from &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;; Renthar and his group had dissented against Rommath's teachings on moral grounds. To avoid the nation becoming divided on the issue, as the teachings had been an essential boon to the elves, Lor'themar, now &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;' regent, exiled the group south. The priestess &lt;a href=\"Aurora%20Skycaller\"&gt;Aurora Skycaller&lt;/a&gt; was among the exiles. From then on, the lodge served as their home.\nQuel'Lithien eventually came under attack from &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; agents on behalf of &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller\"&gt;Nathanos Blightcaller&lt;/a&gt;, who killed a number of rangers at the lodge and took the &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20Registry\"&gt;Quel'Thalas Registry&lt;/a&gt;.\nMuch happened in Quel'Thalas in the years that followed, of which the lodge remained unaware. Lor'themar - now the sole leader of the Kingdom of Quel'Thalas - made a final journey to the lodge. He informed the exiles of the recent events that had transpired, telling the tale of &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;'s downfall and the restoration of the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;. With the &lt;a href=\"Ghostlands\"&gt;Ghostlands&lt;/a&gt; in a safer state, the regent offered Renthar and his company regular aid and supplies. However, Renthar was outraged, outright refused to accept any aid, and threatened to kill anyone Lor'themar might send bearing it. The regent mourned for the losses the lodge had incurred, but in his heart could not fault the exiles for their anger. He left the lodge feeling only sorrow.\nCataclysm.\nAll the elves at the lodge became &lt;a href=\"wretched\"&gt;wretched&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href=\"Ranger%20Lord%20Hawkspear\"&gt;Ranger Lord Hawkspear&lt;/a&gt; found an item of seductive energy. &lt;a href=\"Kirkian%20Dawnshield\"&gt;Kirkian Dawnshield&lt;/a&gt; and Hawkspear himself were two of the only known residents to escaped their fate.

While Hawkspear is now apparently focused on destroying the undead and waits for people to ask him to ally himself with them for that purpose, none have yet to appear to have made such an offer; he is one of several &lt;a href=\"rare%20mob\"&gt;rare mob&lt;/a&gt;s who can be attacked by adventurers of both factions.\nInhabitants.\nPrior to the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the lodge used to be the home of &lt;a href=\"Ranger%20Lord%20Hawkspear\"&gt;Ranger Lord Hawkspear&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Aurora%20Skycaller\"&gt;Aurora&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kriss%20Goldenlight\"&gt;Kriss&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ellaria\"&gt;Ellaria&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kirkian%20Dawnshield\"&gt;Kirkian&lt;/a&gt;.

It is ruled by the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;, descendants of the kingdom's &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; founders, and is known as the Land of Eternal Spring\"'. Its capital is &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing their exile from &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;Darnassian&lt;/a&gt; society and their abandonment of the &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt;, the Highborne under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Dath%27Remar%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Dath'Remar Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; founded the kingdom of Quel'Thalas to the north, within which they reinvented themselves as the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt;. Soon, Quel'Thalas became a shining monument to high elven prowess; the land was magically bathed in an eternal springtime, and Dath'Remar created the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;, his people's own version of the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity%20%28Hyjal%29\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;, which empowered the citizens of Quel'Thalas from then onwards. The elves earned the enmity of the &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;forest troll&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt;, under the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20Empire\"&gt;Amani Empire&lt;/a&gt;, who viewed the elves as usurpers. After several long-spanning conflicts, &lt;a href=\"Anasterian%20Sunstrider\"&gt;King Anasterian Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; presided over the &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Wars\"&gt;Troll Wars&lt;/a&gt;, which dealt the Amani a defeat they would never truly recover from. In its seclusion, Quel'Thalas continued to prosper with the protection of the Sunwell (even rendering the invasion of the Amani remnants and their &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt; allies fruitless), until the kingdom's formidable defenses were bypassed by the treacherous scion of Lordaeron, &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Prince Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;, and his &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20invasion%20of%20Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Scourge invasion of Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, the high elves were nearly scoured from Azeroth: the king perished before Arthas's dark powers, the Sunwell was destroyed, and the bulk of their people were slaughtered. In the wake of this devastation, the king's son &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Prince Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; proclaimed the surviving high elves reborn from the ashes of their shattered kingdom and people, as the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;. The blood elves worked tirelessly to reclaim their homeland from the lingering undead, and would eventually succeed in taking back much of their country, the capital of &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt; included. In a dramatic turn of events, a twisted Prince Kael'thas returned to beauteous Quel'Thalas and attempted to summon the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; via the Sunwell. The prince's dark ambitions were not to be realized, however, and the Sunwell itself would ultimately be returned to the blood elves by the &lt;a href=\"Prophet%20Velen\"&gt;Prophet Velen&lt;/a&gt;. With the Sunwell restored, a bright future now lies ahead for Quel'Thalas.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;kingdom of Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; is currently led by its regent, &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;, following the fall of the &lt;a href=\"Sunstrider%20dynasty\"&gt;royal family&lt;/a&gt;. It serves as the starting location for the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;-aligned blood elves in the \"\" expansion, and consists of three zones: &lt;a href=\"Eversong%20Woods\"&gt;Eversong Woods&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Ghostlands\"&gt;Ghostlands&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Isle of Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn World of Warcraft.\nClassic.\nThere is also a zone of the \"old world\" officially named Quel'thalas. It was the only glimpse of Quel'Thalas before the Burning Crusade expansion, and was accessible in the game. See &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Northern Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas/Eastern%20Kingdoms%20terrain\"&gt;this subpage&lt;/a&gt; for more information and speculation about the zone. &lt;a href=\"Adon\"&gt;Adon&lt;/a&gt; the high elf hinted that the zone was to be added in a later add-on.\nPrior to &lt;a href=\"Patch%204.0.3\"&gt;Patch 4.0.3&lt;/a&gt;, you could reach it by swimming along the coast from &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt; east; or north from the &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt; beyond the coast of the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Eastern Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocated near the peninsula of the unnamed zone is a &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas/Eastern%20Kingdoms%20terrain\"&gt;tall white tower&lt;/a&gt; that is currently inaccessible that has a dock nearby.\nFollowing the \"&lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;\" expansion and the ability to fly in &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, invisible walls prevented conventional access to the \"old\" Quel'Thalas. With \"&lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Azeroth\"&gt;Battle for Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;\", the walls were removed.\nBurning Crusade.\nQuel'Thalas was opened in \"\", and is split into three main regions. To the north is the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Isle of Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt;, home to the dragonhawks and location of the mystical &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;. South of Quel'Danas, across a channel of the &lt;a href=\"North%20Sea\"&gt;North Sea&lt;/a&gt;, is &lt;a href=\"Eversong%20Woods\"&gt;Eversong Woods&lt;/a&gt;, the blood elf starting zone and the location of their capital, &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt;. To the south of Eversong, across the &lt;a href=\"Elrendar%20River\"&gt;Elrendar River&lt;/a&gt;, is the &lt;a href=\"Ghostlands\"&gt;Ghostlands&lt;/a&gt;. It is here that the primary base of the Scourge in Quel'Thalas, the fortress of &lt;a href=\"Deatholme\"&gt;Deatholme&lt;/a&gt;, is located - as is the city of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt;, the capital of Quel'Thalas' long-hated enemies, the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani forest trolls&lt;/a&gt;.\nAll of Quel'Thalas is bisected by a path of &lt;a href=\"Blight%20%28plague%29\"&gt;Blight&lt;/a&gt; known as the &lt;a href=\"Dead%20Scar\"&gt;Dead Scar&lt;/a&gt;. This was the path taken by Arthas from Lordaeron to the Sunwell in his quest to resurrect Kel'Thuzad, running from Deatholme all the way through the Ghostlands and Eversong Woods, coming to a stop midway through Quel'Danas at the gates of the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell%20Plateau\"&gt;Sunwell Plateau&lt;/a&gt;. The path is patrolled by remnants of the Scourge invasion of Quel'Thalas. All attempts by blood elf magisters to cure the blighted soil have failed, giving the blood elves more of an incentive to seek out the destiny promised them beyond the Dark Portal.\nQuel'Thalas is connected to the old world via the &lt;a href=\"Thalassian%20Pass\"&gt;Thalassian Pass&lt;/a&gt; in southern Ghostlands, which goes along the main road (blocked by debris prior to Burning Crusade) into Lordaeron, in the region now called the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Eastern Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;. The path between Ghostlands and EPL is separated by an instance portal; the areas in which the \"instance\" falls under are all three regions of Quel'Thalas, both islands of the &lt;a href=\"Azuremyst%20Isles\"&gt;Azuremyst Isles&lt;/a&gt; (where the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; start out) and all of &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nPlayers will briefly visit the Sunwell during the quest to restore &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Delar\"&gt;Quel'Delar&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nWhile most of the rest of Azeroth has been updated and moved forward in the timeline to just after the Cataclysm, Quel'Thalas remains as it was in The Burning Crusade expansion. Specifically, the Scourge shows no abatement as a result of Arthas' defeat; while the large, green crystals filled with fel energy, said to have been removed at this point in the timeline, still dot the landscape in Eversong Woods and Silvermoon City. In the lore timeline, the blood elves should be using the now-restored Sunwell for power (although, their fel-green eyes will take a long time to wear off) while the Scourge still has a presence in Ghostlands by the time of Invasion of Pandaria as encountered by &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; during the trial of &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, the Isle of Quel'Danas should now be free of Scourge, Burning Legion, and Kael's forces; this progress can only be glimpsed during the questline for &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Delar\"&gt;Quel'Delar&lt;/a&gt; in a phased version of the isle. It is unknown whether Quel'Thalas will be updated to the present time, and if so, when.\nDiscounting standard city updates (the addition of new class trainers and some updated &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knight\"&gt;Blood Knight&lt;/a&gt; quest text), the battle against the revitalized troll empire brewing in &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt; marks the first major change to Quel'Thalas post-\"The Burning Crusade\", as the &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Delar\"&gt;Quel'Delar&lt;/a&gt; segment is phased for its entirety.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nThe Horde sent a massive force to march on &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands\"&gt;Arathi&lt;/a&gt; and take &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt; in order to use it as a launching point for Gilneas. The Alliance in return sent their armies to protect the Stromic lands and continue their conquest of the Eastern Kingdoms, by cutting off the north, especially Silvermoon City.\nSources.\nFrom &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_zdcgw/is_200512/ai_n15717842\"&gt;\"World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade\" in Computer Gaming World, December, 2005 by Jeff Green&lt;/a&gt;:\nIn the RPG.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Lands%20of%20Conflict\"&gt;Lands of Conflict&lt;/a&gt;\", Quel'Thalas is a burned and dead land that has been dubbed &lt;a href=\"Blackened%20Woods\"&gt;Blackened Woods&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpeculation.\nBan'dinoriel.\nThe power of the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt; - manifesting in a massive arcane shield known as &lt;a href=\"Ban%27dinoriel\"&gt;Ban'dinoriel&lt;/a&gt; - was once used as a great defensive measure to protect &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt;. It was considered to be impenetrable. During the Second War, it was enough to ward off an onslaught of enslaved &lt;a href=\"red%20dragon\"&gt;red dragon&lt;/a&gt;s, and during the Third War it halted the Scourge army's advance until the invaders, using knowledge gleaned from a traitor, were able to dispel it. With the Sunwell restored, it is unclear if it still holds these considerable powers of protection. Though the mooncrystals required to passively empower this shield are now gone, it was stated that the magi could erect Ban'dinoriel in their place.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

To the south it borders the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Western&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Eastern Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;, and the area known as \"&lt;a href=\"Northern%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Northern Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;\" is found within its limits. It is a leftover from the original planned &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; during the development of \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\", which was postponed, reworked, and later added in \"\".\nDescription.\nIn an unmarked area of the map (northwest of &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;), a solitary white tower stands on the coast. This tower can be found by swimming around from northern &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt;, staying close to the shoreline so as not to induce &lt;a href=\"fatigue\"&gt;fatigue&lt;/a&gt;. Its purpose is unknown but it has been speculated that it represents an abandoned idea for allowing players to access Quel'Thalas. Another theory is that it is a leftover from before &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;'s current form was conceived.\nIf you continue past this tower, you can see that the &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elf&lt;/a&gt; starting area is not, in fact, part of the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; terrain, neither is located on the Eastern Kingdoms continent server. Instead, Quel'Thalas (like the &lt;a href=\"Azuremyst%20Isles\"&gt;Azuremyst Isles&lt;/a&gt;) is actually located northeast of &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; in its continent server. This can be seen if the character swims to where the &lt;a href=\"Ghostlands\"&gt;Ghostlands&lt;/a&gt; are supposed to be, and then seeing that the map shows them in the middle of zone but they are instead on the sea. Players attempting the reverse of this trick (accessing Tirisfal Glades from the Ghostlands) will find invisible walls blocking their path, and if bypassed, Outland itself to the southwest.\nWith the ' world revamp and the availability of flying mounts, this zone was blocked off by an invisible wall, but following the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Battle for Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; in ', the invisible wall is removed, and it can once again be reached from northern Tirisfal or via flying mount. However, there is no reason to visit beyond curiosity as nothing new was added to the area.\nDevelopment.\nOriginally, Quel'Thalas was intended to be in the game at release and was even worked a little before being eventually postponed. There is a big empty green area and much of the surrounding terrain bears the hallmarks of a \"cookie-cutter\" terrain editor fill. Moreover, the name \"Quel'thalas\" will display when entering the zone. It also has its own &lt;a href=\"chat\"&gt;chat&lt;/a&gt; channels, but there is no music in the area.\nWhen the was made, they decided to cut the Quel'Thalas into two zones, and to place it on the Outland continent server, making it easier to restrict access to those who had not purchased the expansion. The same &lt;a href=\"loading%20screen\"&gt;loading screen&lt;/a&gt; exists for both the blood elf and draenei zones, and Outland. This also causes the minimap arrow for party members in the blood elf or draenei zones to appear on your minimap when you are in Outland (or vice versa)."}

The corrupted Sunwell was destroyed in the aftermath of the onslaught by &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;crown prince Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;, who renamed the survivors the blood elves in honor of their perished brethren, made &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; Quel'Thalas' regent, and traveled far beyond his homeland to seek salvation for his people, ultimately meeting a tragic end. The blood elves eventually reclaimed and rebuilt much of Quel'Thalas, and the Sunwell was restored, heralding a brighter future after some of the kingdom's darkest days.\nQuel'Thalas maintained a 2,000-year friendship with the mage-state of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;. This alliance would be strained by the two kingdoms' differing loyalties and incidents between them in years to follow. Quel'Thalas joined the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, but was a reluctant member at best, returning to independence after King &lt;a href=\"Anasterian\"&gt;Anasterian&lt;/a&gt; accused the Alliance of abandoning his people during the war. The kingdom sought out allies following the Scourge invasion: Kael'thas departed Azeroth to pursue alliance on &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; after a disastrous tenure in the ruins of Lordaeron, and the Alliance had no interest in fighting for Quel'Thalas again; aid was offered only by former ranger-general &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; and her &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;. The kingdom was eventually committed to &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;'s reformed &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; by Lor'themar Theron, who worked to repair Quel'Thalas' relations with the rest of Azeroth following his prince's downfall. More recently, Quel'Thalas established good relations with the &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;nightborne of Suramar&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nNew beginnings.\nBanished from &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; by their night elf brethren, the Highborne led by &lt;a href=\"Dath%27Remar%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Dath'Remar Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; left their ancestral homeland behind them and struck out across the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt; in search of whatever lands might lie beyond the &lt;a href=\"Maelstrom\"&gt;Maelstrom&lt;/a&gt;. Their determination was rewarded when they discovered the continent that would eventually become known as the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;, landing in a region filled with lush woodlands and wildlife. The Highborne traveled on foot for months until settling in a region known to its primitive human residents as &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal\"&gt;Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt;. The Highborne initially had little interaction with the humans but gleaned from them the legend of &lt;a href=\"Tyr\"&gt;Tyr&lt;/a&gt;, a guardian who had sacrificed himself to slay a &lt;a href=\"Zakajz%20the%20Corruptor\"&gt;mighty foe&lt;/a&gt; in Tirisfal. Indeed, the Highborne had noticed powerful energies in the land\u2014energies the primitive humans could not detect. It could not match their old &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity%20%28Hyjal%29\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;, but it intrigued the arcane-practicing elves nonetheless. They believed they could regain their lost glory if they unlocked its secrets, but in time this proved unfeasible; the energy was dark and corrupted and drove the elves who dabbled in it mad. Furthermore, cut off from the Well, the Highborne became susceptible to mortality, age, and disease. Their skin had lost its violet hue, and they had shrunk in stature. The Highborne feared these effects would only worsen over time.\nThe Highborne grew increasingly expedient, convinced that the humans had built their settlements over the most potent ley lines. Some pushed for war, resolved to outright conquer the native humans or at least force them to relocate. Dath'Remar Sunstrider did not agree. The Highborne leader saw no wisdom in making enemies of beings that posed his people no threat. He had also noticed the dark energies radiating from the land and theorized that it was responsible for the sudden rise of belligerence and madness afflicting his kind. Ultimately, he chose to lead them away from Tirisfal to avert violence and spare them from a potential calamity. He decided that they would make a new home in the north. There, Dath'Remar's scouts had discovered a region rife with lush forests and powerful ley energies. Intent on reaching this land, the beleaguered Highborne left Tirisfal and marched north into the unknown.\nThe founding of Quel'Thalas.\nDath'Remar and the Highborne continued their quest to find a home on the Eastern Kingdoms. Following the trails of magical essence, they traveled north through perilous weather; a deadly blizzard trapped the elves for nearly a month as they pressed on. For the first time in living memory, the Highborne began to die of starvation; only the compassion of primitive humans living in the mountain kept the entire expedition from perishing. The lesson was a harsh reminder of all they had lost, cut off from the Well of Eternity. Once the storm lifted, they forged ahead, shaken but determined to find their new home. Hope warmed their weary hearts when they finally reached the land Dath'Remar's scouts had spoken of: verdant woodlands covered the terrain, and the very ground beneath the Highborne's feet crackled with potent lines of magic. But the elves soon discovered that another race also called this region home: the barbaric &lt;a href=\"Amani%20Empire\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt; forest trolls.\nThe arrival of the Highborne infuriated the Amani trolls, who harbored a bitter hatred of elves from the days of &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt;. The Amani sent out raiding parties immediately to slaughter the unwanted trespassers, and the Highborne soon learned to fear troll ambushes in the dense forests. Yet the elves were stubborn, and pushed forward, using their great magical prowess to decimate any Amani who dared to cross their path. As the elves had feared the trolls, the trolls learned to fear the elves. The constant skirmishes fostered a mutual, bitter enmity between the Amani and the Highborne. Despite the trolls' ferocity, the elves finally reached the nexus of ley lines they had been seeking. Powerful torrents of arcane energy converged in the vibrant forests. Dath'Remar proclaimed that this was where his people would begin their civilization anew.\nDath'Remar shocked his followers by revealing a vial containing energy from the Well of Eternity, one of several created by &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, that the Highborne leader had stolen from the night elves' custody shortly before their banishment from Hyjal. Dath'Remar poured the vial's enchanted water into a small lake at the center of the nexus, and a brilliant fount of energy tore through the skies of Azeroth. The Highborne dubbed this glorious cradle of power the \"Sunwell,\" a name chosen in honor of Dath'Remar and his bold quest to reignite their culture.\nThereafter, the Highborne abandoned their worship of the moon and instead took strength from the sun. In time, they took the name \"high elves,\" and the arcane power available to them increased by an astonishing degree. Although the journey had been torturous, Dath'Remar had led them to salvation. They called their new land Quel'Thalas, (\"High Home\"), and declared that it would dwarf the night elves' civilization and stand as a monument to the ages.\nNourished by the arcane magic from the Sunwell, the Highborne created Silvermoon and shaped the forests of Quel'Thalas. The Amani did not agree. The high elves had built their new kingdom \u2014 a kingdom centered on the Sunwell, the heart of their new culture \u2014 atop ancient Amani ruins, ruins still considered hallowed ground by the trolls. Outnumbering the elves nearly ten-to-one, the Amani struggled ferociously to drive the invaders from their sacred land. The high elves drew on the full might of the newfound power the Sunwell afforded them, but could barely hold off the trolls' assault. Dath'Remar himself led almost every battle against the fierce Amani. Bit by bit, the elves carved out the borders of their kingdom, securing a new home, paid for in the blood of their brothers and sisters.\nYet many of the high elves grew weary of their rampant use of arcane magic, fearing that it could once more draw the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; to Azeroth. Dath'Remar sent his most powerful arcanists to find a solution. Over several decades, they built a series of monolithic &lt;a href=\"runestone\"&gt;runestone&lt;/a&gt;s around Quel'Thalas' borders. This barrier was called \"&lt;a href=\"Ban%27dinoriel\"&gt;Ban'dinoriel&lt;/a&gt;\", or \"the Gatekeeper\" in the high elven tongue. It would prevent others from detecting the high elves' use of magic, ward off the superstitious Amani, and weaken the magic of all non-elves within it. The trolls eventually retreated into their temple city of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt;. They decided it was safer to ambush elven convoys that strayed beyond the magic barrier than to launch a full assault on Quel'Thalas. An elite group of rangers soon arose to combat this threat.\nWithin the borders of Quel'Thalas, civilization thrived. No longer fearful of using magic, the high elves created marvelous works that bathed their kingdom in eternal springtime. Never again would they experience another winter as brutal as the one they had suffered en route to this cherished land. Their capital, &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt;, became a shining monument to the memory of the elves' ancient empire. Silvermoon was constructed out of radiant white stone and adorned in crimson tapestry. With his new empire established, Dath'Remar stepped down as its leader. His bloodline would go on to inherit a magical kingdom of peace and prosperity. Its beauteous palaces, crafted in the same architectural style as the ancient halls of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, were interwoven with the natural topography of the land. Quel'Thalas had become the shining jewel that the elves had longed to create. The &lt;a href=\"Convocation%20of%20Silvermoon\"&gt;Convocation of Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt; was founded as the ruling power over Quel'Thalas, though the &lt;a href=\"Sunstrider\"&gt;Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; Dynasty maintained a modicum of political power. Comprised of seven of the greatest high elf lords, the Convocation worked to secure the safety of the elven lands and people, and Quel'Thalas prospered in peace. Yet this era would come to an end when Dath'Remar's great-grandson, &lt;a href=\"Anasterian%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Anasterian Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;, donned the mantle of leadership. He came into power at a time when his people faced war with the trolls once again.\nThe Troll Wars.\nMillennia after their defeat at the elves' hands, the Amani trolls plotted revenge within Zul'Aman. Though they were fierce warriors and possessed savage voodoo magic, they lacked unity and a strong leader. Infighting had also spread throughout the tribe, threatening to destroy it from within. Their fortune changed when they received aid from the revered &lt;a href=\"Zandalar%20tribe\"&gt;Zandalar tribe&lt;/a&gt;. The Zandalari saw themselves as the protectors and spiritual leaders of all trolls and sought to strengthen troll societies all across Azeroth. The trolls had languished since the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, the Zandalari included. In the Amani, the Zandalari saw an opportunity to revitalize one of their race's most powerful tribes and reassert dominance on the Eastern Kingdoms. Overwhelming the high elves would be no easy task, but despite its founder's claims, Quel'Thalas was not as powerful as the ancient night elf empire that had decimated the trolls so long ago.\nThe Zandalari formed an alliance with the Amani and marshaled their forces for the impending conquest. The Zandalari would ensure that the mighty &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt; demigods would aid the trolls in battle. To settle the matter of leadership, the Zandalari made one of the Amani's fiercest warriors, &lt;a href=\"Jintha\"&gt;Jintha&lt;/a&gt;, the ruler of his people. Small Amani warbands ventured from Zul'Aman to raid the high elves and test their strength. The cunning trolls hid their true numbers and capabilities; and after several successful attacks, decided that the time for all-out war had finally come. Without warning, tens of thousands of troll fighters exploded from the shadowy forests. Fearsome loa demigods marched alongside the Amani, infusing their adherents with supernatural power. The high elves struggled desperately to hold back the trolls but were forced to give ground. With astonishing speed, the Amani laid waste to the outer reaches of Quel'Thalas. The Zandalari emissaries were pleased by what they saw: even the elves and their potent arcane powers could not withstand the might of the Amani\u2014the might of the troll race. When the high elves went to war with the Amani trolls, the elves could not understand how the trolls' weapon enchantments were more powerful than their own. The elves then stole ancient knowledge from troll spellcasters, including the famous &lt;a href=\"Zanza\"&gt;Zanza&lt;/a&gt;, and used stolen idols to craft their own versions of the troll enchantments.\nThe expanding troll empire was not a threat only the elves were faced with. King &lt;a href=\"Thoradin\"&gt;Thoradin&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Strom\"&gt;Strom&lt;/a&gt; had also feared how far the Amani's ambitions would reach, and kept a careful eye on the intensifying war between the high elves and the Amani. Although he heard of much death and destruction in the elven homeland, he remained stubborn in his belief that intervening would put his own people at unnecessary risk. His opinion finally changed when high elf ambassadors sent by Anasterian told the king firsthand of the Amani's stark brutality and the demigods walking the land; surely, Strom would be next if Quel'Thalas were to fall. Convening with his advisors, the king agreed to form an alliance with the elves, but even so, he doubted they had the power to destroy the Amani. They issued the elves an ultimatum: in return for Strom's military aid, the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s would be taught in the ways of magic. Elven magic was legendary among humans, but even Thoradin, deeply suspicious of sorcery, knew the humans needed it to win the battle.\nAnasterian knew well the dangers of unchecked magic. He knew that teaching the arcane arts to humans could easily lead to disaster. Yet, as much as this troubled Anasterian, his own people were facing extinction. Knowing he had little choice, he agreed that &lt;a href=\"One%20Hundred\"&gt;one hundred&lt;/a&gt;\u2014and only one hundred\u2014humans would be tutored in the rudimentary ways of magic. Elven magi traveled to Strom and began their mentorship; over the course of many months, the elves were stunned at the natural affinity the humans had for magic, even if they lacked in grace and subtlety.\nOnce the elves had finished tutoring the human magi, &lt;a href=\"Arathor\"&gt;Arathor&lt;/a&gt; launched its offensive. Over twenty thousand human soldiers gathered at &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, and Thoradin himself led his armies to Quel'Thalas. The full might of Arathor's armies smashed into the Amani's rear flank, while the high elves began a heavy assault in the north and laid waste to the trolls' front lines. Though faced with enemies of both sides, Jintha remained confident in the Amani's victory, resolving to crush Arathor first and return to purge the elves from Quel'Thalas for good. Thoradin called for a retreat, and lured the voracious Amani into a deathtrap in the mountains of Alterac, whittling the trolls' numbers down on both fronts. The final battle took place outside of Quel'Thalas, and the Amani, stuck between the elves to the north and the humans to the south, took massive losses when the human magi (whose existence had been hidden), were revealed and unleashed. Alongside the elven sorcerers, the humans called upon their vast new powers. The humans pooled their energy together and wove a single terrible spell, engulfing the Amani ranks in a searing conflagration. Loa and troll alike fell and burned.\nJintha was among the first to fall. Leaderless, the Amani broke ranks and retreated north, but were hunted down and slaughtered at every turn. The disastrous battle shocked the Zandalari emissaries, who fled back to their island in shame and disbelief. For them, this defeat marked a dark turning point in history. Yet for Quel'Thalas, the war was the beginning of a glorious new era. For months after the conflict's end, celebrations graced the streets of Silvermoon. The grateful elves pledged their loyalty to Arathor and Thoradin's descendants.\nBeyond the borders.\nYears passed, and Quel'Thalas continued its prosperous growth. When the kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; was founded to the south, some of the elves traveled there to teach, study, and reside, including Quel'Thalas's own crown prince, &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;, and future &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister\"&gt;Grand Magister&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rommath\"&gt;Rommath&lt;/a&gt;. Silvermoon and Dalaran established an alliance that would continue for over 2,000 years to come. Indeed, many of the &lt;a href=\"Magisters\"&gt;Magisters&lt;/a&gt; of Quel'Thalas would study in Dalaran together with the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt some point, the grandfather of &lt;a href=\"King%20Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;King Terenas Menethil II&lt;/a&gt; successfully negotiated with Quel'Thalas to formally establish the border between the elven kingdom and &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Second War.\nNearly three thousand years later, shortly after the fall of the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt; - the last blood descendant of King Thoradin - led his people across the Great Sea to Lordaeron, where he went before &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;King Terenas&lt;/a&gt; and warned of the coming of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Orcish Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Terenas immediately called a council of the neighboring kings which led to the formation of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. With Lothar named Supreme Commander, Terenas sent a missive to King &lt;a href=\"Anasterian%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Anasterian Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; - himself a veteran of the Troll Wars millennia before - informing him of Lothar's lineage and the request for aid to the Alliance. At first, Anasterian reluctantly sent a token display of support in the form of a party led by &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;. The king himself was hesitant to fully involve Quel'Thalas in the war, and had hoped to remain impartial should the orcs not threaten his own kingdom.\nNot long afterward, when &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; led the Horde's invasion of Quel'Thalas and began burning the edges of the Eversong Woods, it was discovered that the Horde was being aided by the elves' mortal enemies, the Amani, led by the cunning &lt;a href=\"Zul%27jin\"&gt;Zul'jin&lt;/a&gt;. The orcish necromancers had succeeded in subverting some of the runestones, allowing their magic free reign and their forces to approach the capital, though the invaders could not pierce Ban'dinoriel even with their &lt;a href=\"red%20dragon\"&gt;red dragon&lt;/a&gt; servants. Alleria brought the head of a freshly slain troll warrior to the Convocation of Silvermoon, throwing it at Anasterian's feet. This provoked an intense rage within the King of Quel'Thalas, and he immediately called for the mobilization of his armies to battle the Horde. The elves provided many &lt;a href=\"Archer%23High%20elven%20archer\"&gt;archers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Elven%20ranger\"&gt;rangers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Destroyer%23Elven%20destroyer\"&gt;destroyers&lt;/a&gt; to the conflict, and even craftsmen for the &lt;a href=\"Lumber%20mill%23Elven%20lumber%20mill\"&gt;lumber mills&lt;/a&gt; of the Alliance. The effort was led by &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ranger-General%20of%20Silvermoon\"&gt;Ranger-General of Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;. Making little progress, the orcs soon abandoned the battle in favor of besieging Lordaeron, and the Alliance forces pursued them. The Amani saw the orcs' withdrawal as a betrayal and chose instead to fight a hopeless, vicious battle in Quel'Thalas, only to be beaten back after considerable bloodshed. Zul'jin himself was captured by the elven ranger &lt;a href=\"Halduron%20Brightwing\"&gt;Halduron Brightwing&lt;/a&gt; and his platoon, though narrowly escaped and went into hiding.\nReturn to seclusion.\nQuel'Thalas was, at best, a reluctant member of the Alliance. In the wake of the Second War, humanity began to distance itself from Quel'Thalas, and in turn, the high elves came to view the deteriorating Alliance with increasing coldness. At the same time, they still participated in the defense of &lt;a href=\"Nethergarde%20Keep\"&gt;Nethergarde Keep&lt;/a&gt;, but that was as much from their fascination with all &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; as from any desire to help humans. King Anasterian himself felt betrayed by the Alliance's retreat to Lordaeron during the war, which left the elves to deal with the rampaging Amani trolls alone. Anasterian claimed that the Alliance had abandoned Quel'Thalas in its darkest hour, and while not all of the high elves agreed with him, enough did. The tension eventually came to head when King Anasterian withdrew his support from the Alliance entirely. The official stance was that the humans' poor leadership resulted in the burning of Eversong Woods (even though Terenas reminded him of the many humans who gave their lives to protect Quel'Thalas); in addition, with Lothar dead and the Horde defeated, Anasterian believed that the debt to Thoradin and his descendants was repaid. With few exceptions - including some elven priests and sorceresses, as well as Anasterian's son and heir, &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Prince Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt;, a member of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; - the majority of the elven race shut themselves inside their enchanted kingdom. Some high elves chose to remain with their allies in the Alliance instead of returning to their kingdom.\nAnasterian's decision to secede was the catalyst that led to both King &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thoras%20Trollbane\"&gt;Thoras Trollbane&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt; to follow the high elven king's example, a domino effect that would soon have dire repercussions for the humans and elves alike.\nThe fall of Quel'Thalas.\nSeveral years later, the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;Plague of Undeath&lt;/a&gt; broke out in Lordaeron. Terenas' son &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt;, a paladin trained by &lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther the Lightbringer&lt;/a&gt; himself, made efforts to stop the Plague from turning his beloved people into mindless undead raised to serve the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, master of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, the whole chain of events appears to have been engineered by the Lich King himself to find a suitable host for his bodiless mind, and Arthas fell into despair and eventually madness. Traveling to Northrend, he forfeited his soul to the Lich King upon taking up the &lt;a href=\"runeblade\"&gt;runeblade&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt;.\nNow the greatest of the Lich King's death knights, Arthas traveled back to his homeland, murdered his father and all but obliterated the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Kingdom of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. With its fall, neighboring human nations converged on Lordaeron, hoping to vanquish the Scourge. Even Quel'Thalas, no longer a member of the Alliance, sent priests to combat the undead.\nArthas was then tasked by &lt;a href=\"Tichondrius\"&gt;Tichondrius&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the Dreadlords and the Lich King's chief jailor, to resurrect the necromancer &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; - whom Arthas had killed not long before - so he could fulfill his appointed duty of summoning &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; into Azeroth. Tichondrius also told Arthas that there was only one suitable place to resurrect Kel'Thuzad - the mystic &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;, the source of the high elves' magic, deep inside Quel'Thalas.\nTo reach the Sunwell, Arthas needed an insider, someone who could allow him to bypass the magical defenses of Quel'Thalas; he found one in &lt;a href=\"Dar%27Khan%20Drathir\"&gt;Dar'Khan Drathir&lt;/a&gt;, a disillusioned &lt;a href=\"Magisters\"&gt;magister&lt;/a&gt;. Dar'Khan, an egotistical and embittered man, believed he deserved more than he was receiving. Arthas preyed upon his ego, promising Dar'Khan untold power in exchange for his aid, and his loyalty. With the backing of his \"Blessed Lord Arthas\", Dar'Khan provided the Scourge with two powerful artifacts - the Stone of Light and the Stone of Flame - that had warding powers against the undead, allowing the Scourge armies to circumvent Quel'Thalas' formidable defenses. Thus, Arthas led the Scourge in a march of death down a path that today is known as the &lt;a href=\"Dead%20Scar\"&gt;Dead Scar&lt;/a&gt;, across the Elrendar River into Eversong Woods, destroying one of the protective runestones on the edges of the forest.\nThe elves, in an attempt to stop the blight from spreading further into Eversong Woods, set the area around the destroyed runestone to the torch. But the armies of the Scourge pressed on, breaking through the Elfgates and through Silvermoon itself. Ranger General &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; led the defense as best she could, but she fell to the power of Frostmourne. In a cruel gesture of dominance, Arthas took Sylvanas' lifeless body and ripped her spirit from it, creating the first banshee. Even the blade &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Delar\"&gt;Quel'Delar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Anasterian%20Sunstrider\"&gt;King Anasterian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Belo%27vir%20Salonar\"&gt;Grand Magister Belo'vir&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Convocation%20of%20Silvermoon\"&gt;Convocation of Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt; were no match for Arthas and his legions, slaughtered with their people by the relentless tide of the mindless undead.\nWith Silvermoon in ruins and the elves broken and scattered, Arthas fulfilled his task and submerged the corpse of Kel'Thuzad within the waters of the Sunwell, fouling the potent waters of Eternity; the necromancer returned to the world of the living as a sorcerous &lt;a href=\"lich\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen word of Quel'Thalas' fall reached Dalaran, Prince Kael'thas - now the last of his bloodline and \"de jure\" leader of the high elves - returned to his homeland and joined up with &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; and the survivors.\nRise of the blood elves.\nKael'thas' return to his shattered kingdom was not a warm one. Rather than fighting to protect Quel'Thalas in its darkest hour, the prince had been absent in Dalaran. Many of the despondent survivors scorned him, claiming that Kael had always felt a greater kinship with that distant kingdom than Quel'Thalas itself. The prince could hardly fault them, for it was true, he had always felt distant from his insular, isolationist kingdom, and was far more open to the world beyond Quel'Thalas than many of his people. Still, Kael'thas loved his people more than they knew, and the rule of the kingdom now fell to him. He swore to do all in his power to see it rebuilt and restored to its glory.\nThe prince attended the funeral of his father, surveyed the ruins of his kingdom, and finally examined the befouled Sunwell. The well, once the beating heart of high elf society, was now pulsating dark, necromantic energies that threatened to kill every elf bound to it. Kael'thas returned to Silvermoon and told his people a truth few were happy to hear: the Sunwell must be destroyed. Accompanied by a small raid, Kael'thas and his strongest magi teleported to Quel'Danas, where they bound and destroyed the Sunwell in an elaborate ritual. The ensuing detonation did huge damage to the undead and Amani warbands swarming the isle, and Kael'thas returned to Silvermoon triumphant. To the gathered high elves he spoke of the future and renamed them the blood elves, \"sin'dorei\" in their native tongue, in honor of their perished king and kin. For all the hardships and sorrow in the blood elves' recent history, this new chapter would need to be one of healing and rebuilding if Quel'Thalas was to endure.\nThe loss of the Sunwell was immediately felt by the blood elves. Having spent every day of their lives bathed in its energies, they were left bereft, weakened by its absence, with an insatiable hunger to feed. A &lt;a href=\"The%20Bazaar\"&gt;small portion&lt;/a&gt; of Silvermoon had been defensibly reclaimed, but most of Quel'Thalas remained in rubble and ruins, a wasteland haunted by phantoms and cadaverous undead. Kael'thas knew that true rebuilding would never be possible until the immediate threat of the Scourge running rampant through all of Lordaeron was dealt with. To this end, he named the seasoned ranger &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; his regent, gathered the healthiest of his warriors, and departed to do battle in the south.\nReformations.\nThe Scourge invasion hugely changed the political scene of Quel'Thalas. With the deaths of roughly 90% of the kingdom's population (including its king, ranger-general, grand magister, and &lt;a href=\"Convocation%20of%20Silvermoon\"&gt;ruling council&lt;/a&gt;), many political decisions were made to fill the voids left.\nNew allegiances.\nAlthough King Anasterian had seceded from the Alliance, Kael'thas joined up with the Alliance remnants battling in Lordaeron. But the Alliance's chain of command in the region had also changed significantly: the reigning &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Marshal\"&gt;grand marshal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Garithos\"&gt;Garithos&lt;/a&gt;, was a prejudiced man promoted by chance instead of merit. The grand marshal was bigoted towards non-human races and harbored a deep personal hatred of the elves in particular. He gave the blood elves tasks either far beneath their capabilities as warriors or - worse - suicidal. Kael'thas was forced to call upon the aid of the night elves (led by &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;, hunting for Malfurion's brother &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt;) and, later, &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Vashj\"&gt;Lady Vashj&lt;/a&gt; and the naga. The naga presented themselves as misunderstood enemies of the Scourge -- their input had not only saved the lives of the blood elf soldiers but also ensured the Alliance's flank remained protected during the battle for Dalaran -- but to Garithos, they were monsters no better than the undead.\nWhen Garithos discovered the naga had aided Kael and his brethren, he sentenced them to death for treason. Kael and his comrades were rescued by Vashj and her naga, who took them to Illidan in the wastes of &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. Illidan won Kael'thas over with an understanding of his plight, and promised the prince a solution to the arcane hunger consuming his race; Kael'thas then pledged the loyalty of the blood elves to Illidan's cause. Settling in Outland with the rest of Illidan's forces, Kael'thas sent a magister named &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Rommath\"&gt;Rommath&lt;/a&gt; back to Quel'Thalas, with the promise that Kael'thas would one day return to lead the blood elves to paradise. Rommath rejoined &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar&lt;/a&gt;, Regent Lord of Quel'Thalas, and informed him of Kael'thas' command to prepare the blood elves for their journey into the \"promised land\" beyond the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;.\nKael'thas's departure to Outland marked the beginning of a dark turn. He could not bear to return to his kingdom a failure and a fugitive with nothing to show for his people's hardships, and his hunger for magic grew ever worse. While sojourning on Outland he convinced a hesitant Illidan to share the secrets of &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; magic with him; this damning switch soon became an addiction. His actions grew callous, he turned paranoid, and put himself in a position where &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden the Deceiver&lt;/a&gt;, lord of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, could prey on his weaknesses and turn him into an ideal pawn to further the Deceiver's own plans, which Quel'Thalas was crucial to.\nMeanwhile, in ruined Lordaeron, Sylvanas Windrunner and her free-willed &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; undead had killed Garithos and claimed &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt; as their own. The Forsaken holdings were tenuous, beset as they were by enemies on all sides. The banshee queen reached out to Quel'Thalas, seeking sanctuary; she had given her life to defend the kingdom and expected something in return for her sacrifice. Yet her request was refused. The blood elves feared the undead, suspecting a trick, and treated them as monsters.\nRebuilding.\nLittle had changed in Quel'Thalas during the prince's absence. The Farstriders frequently struck out to battle the Scourge, but their enemy was inexorable, and the blood elves' debilitating hunger for magic was yet to be ameliorated. Meanwhile, Dar'Khan Drathir, risen from the grave to harry Quel'Thalas once more, haunted the kingdom he had betrayed. The Lich King, outwardly dormant atop his frozen throne, clashed with &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt; and his servant &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; in a race to hoard the remnants of the Sunwell, which the &lt;a href=\"red%20dragon\"&gt;red dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Korialstrasz&lt;/a&gt; had hastily collected and transformed into a mortal guise, the human woman &lt;a href=\"Anveena%20Teague\"&gt;Anveena Teague&lt;/a&gt;. Drathir discovered her identity and dragged her to Quel'Thalas for his own purposes. Sylvanas, Lor'themar, and the Farstriders allied with Kalec and his companions, and Anveena killed the great traitor once again. Anveena's true identity was to be kept a closely-guarded secret by Quel'Thalas' leadership, and she was put under protection at an undisclosed location within the kingdom. Kalecgos remained by her side.\nIt was not until Rommath returned with Illidan's teachings - teachings smoothly attributed to Kael'thas - that the tides began to turn. Rommath taught his brethren the ability to &lt;a href=\"Mana%20Tap\"&gt;siphon arcane magic from external sources&lt;/a&gt;, primarily mana-bearing creatures and objects. This proved invaluable to the beleaguered elves, most of whom were suffering from arcane withdrawal with the Sunwell's constant flow of energy gone, and lacking the strength to restore their beloved homeland. Some elves opposed this technique, considering it immoral, and were exiled south to the Plaguelands to avoid civil unrest; the exiles took up residence at &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Lithien%20Lodge\"&gt;Quel'Lithien Lodge&lt;/a&gt;.\nRommath and the magi used their powerful magics to reclaim and rebuild the eastern half of &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt; almost overnight, and the blood elves struck out to reclaim Eversong and push into the scoured south. Most of Eversong was restored, but the elves were more divided on how to approach the &lt;a href=\"Ghostlands\"&gt;Ghostlands&lt;/a&gt;. Some were content to remain north, in the safety of Silvermoon; others would not rest until the Scourge was driven from Quel'Thalas entirely.\nKael'thas also sent back &lt;a href=\"M%27uru\"&gt;M'uru&lt;/a&gt; to Quel'Thalas, a &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; guardian he had defeated in &lt;a href=\"Tempest%20Keep\"&gt;Tempest Keep&lt;/a&gt;. The blood elves learned to manipulate and harvest his holy energies, using them to empower a group of pseudo-paladins dubbed the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knights\"&gt;Blood Knights&lt;/a&gt;. Under the leadership of the disillusioned former priestess &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt;, the knights rose to prominence in Quel'Thalas, their creed being to defend the kingdom from any and all threats.\nThe New Horde.\nAlthough far more stable than it had been, Quel'Thalas was still in turmoil. Packs of undead roamed the land, and the Amani trolls began new attacks on the southern borders. Regent Lord Lor'themar Theron had few resources to defend his home: the kingdom's military was still in tatters, and the emergence of the &lt;a href=\"Wretched\"&gt;Wretched&lt;/a&gt;, reckless magic addicts who had overused the technique of draining mana, had further weakened his people from within.\nTo make matters worse, Kael'thas had still not returned from Outland. The latest news Quel'Thalas had heard of its prince did not bode well: the Legion was amassing for reasons unknown, and Kael had suffered &lt;a href=\"Scryers\"&gt;considerable defections&lt;/a&gt; from his own forces. Kael'thas was vulnerable, but Lor'themar could not leave Quel'Thalas undefended while he launched a campaign to assist the prince on Outland. Quel'Thalas needed allies, and it would no longer find them among the humans, dwarves, gnomes and night elves. Anasterian's secession from the Alliance still left bitter memories, and the Alliance had no interest in fighting for Quel'Thalas again. Kael'thas' alliance with Illidan and Vashj had further soured relations between Quel'Thalas and the Alliance.\nAssistance was offered from an unlikely source: again, Sylvanas Windrunner reached out to the blood elves. Their positions had been reversed: the Forsaken had firmly entrenched themselves in the ruins of Lordaeron, but Sylvanas presented herself as a sympathetic ally who had lost no love for her homeland and its people. The elves still feared deception, but ultimately relented, accepting her offers of aid. Forsaken troops traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Ghostlands\"&gt;Ghostlands&lt;/a&gt;, where they reinforced the blood elf holdings and helped keep control of reclaimed outposts such as &lt;a href=\"Tranquillien\"&gt;Tranquillien&lt;/a&gt;. \nSome of the elves saw their former ranger-general as a hero who had given her life in Quel'Thalas' defense; others were suspicious of her motives and questioned whether the Dark Lady was truly still the Sylvanas they'd known. Still, the Forsaken's aid was indispensable in the years to come, and through this alliance, Sylvanas introduced Lor'themar to the reformed &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, which the Forsaken owed allegiance to. Sylvanas arranged &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and High Chieftain &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; to meet with the regent.\nDespite the elves' history of warfare with the orcs, Lor'themar was receptive to the idea. He knew the modern Horde was different than the one which had ravaged Quel'Thalas in years past. He was also painfully aware that time was running out for both his people and his prince, and Quel'Thalas would not survive without allies. The regent accepted Sylvanas' overtures and met with the Horde's leaders.\nThrall and Cairne saw great promise in the blood elves. The people of Quel'Thalas had proved their courage and resolve while fighting to protect their kingdom from outside threats like the Scourge. Thrall and Cairne also believed that helping the blood elves would be an act of honor: like many races of the Horde, the sin'dorei were a people brought near to extinction and were trapped in a struggle between restoring their once-glorious kingdom and their addiction to magic. They extended the hand of peace to Lor'themar, and the regent accepted. This alliance would prove beneficial for both the Horde and Quel'Thalas: the Horde gained much from another foothold on the Eastern Kingdoms, and the blood elves brought to the Horde's arsenal a mastery of the arcane it had previously been lacking. The Horde's support would allow the blood elves to reach their missing prince on Outland.\nOnly one major obstacle preventing their becoming full members of the Horde remained: the Scourge that remained on the footsteps of Quel'Thalas, marching from their citadel of &lt;a href=\"Deatholme\"&gt;Deatholme&lt;/a&gt; at the southern terminus of the Dead Scar. There, the resurrected Dar'Khan Drathir directed the Scourge in Quel'Thalas; only his death allowed the blood elves to become equal members of the Horde.\nAttack on Zul'Aman.\nWith most of the blood elves' soldiers occupied on Outland, Zul'jin of the Amani saw the opportunity to strike back at the elven kingdom at last. Zul'jin was a cunning leader, and his attacks were motivated by a deep hatred of Quel'Thalas as well as strategic reasons: Zul'jin was certain that Quel'Thalas would inevitably convince its new allies to deal with the Amani empire. Deep within their foreboding citadel of Zul'Aman, troll priests undertook rituals to harness the power of their loa, unleashing mighty creatures in the form of giant beasts. Their energies suffused the Amani soldiers. The Horde was desperate not to fight a two-pronged war \u2013 Outland and Quel'Thalas. The faction's mightiest champions volunteered to storm &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt;. They did not have the strength to face the trolls' army directly, but they had no need to. The Horde's strike force slew Zul'jin himself, along with his priests, before their rampage in Quel'Thalas could even begin.\nThe Prince and the Deceiver.\nKil'jaeden, the lord of the Legion, had discovered a way to restore the Sunwell. He sensed the &lt;a href=\"Anveena\"&gt;remnants of its power&lt;/a&gt; deep within Quel'Thalas and dispatched his most cunning servants to assume blood elf forms and infiltrate the kingdom's inner circle. They learned the truth of Anveena, and Kil'jaeden knew that he could use her \u2013 the Sunwell's mortal avatar \u2013 as a gateway into Azeroth. The beleaguered prince, Kael'thas, was just as crucial to this plan as Anveena herself: the Legion's servants in the region were few, and could not hope to control the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Quel%27Danas\"&gt;necessary areas&lt;/a&gt; of Quel'Thalas without the intimate knowledge Kael had of his kingdom, the resting place of the Sunwell, and its defenses. The Deceiver set in motion a plan to corrupt the prince to his side and eventually succeeded. Between Illidan's ineffectual leadership, the many setbacks he'd suffered on Outland, his damning addiction to fel magic, and his feelings of personal failure, Kael'thas proved an amenable pawn. The wiser choice would have been to cut his losses and return to Quel'Thalas, but the prince would not do so without the salvation he had promised his people - which Kil'jaeden had promised to him. \nLor'themar and his closest aides kept Anveena's true identity secret even from Kael'thas. He understood that Kael'thas was desperate to save their people, but that if he knew the truth he may act without considering the consequences: the Sunwell was now mortal, and none knew how, or whether, their well could be recreated. Quel'Thalas was already a wounded nation, and another disaster could destroy it forever.\nOver time, Lor'themar's opinion changed. He worried constantly over Kael's fate on Outland, and rather than reaching the prince and his \"promised land\", the regent believed it was time for the prince to return home to his kingdom. He hoped to achieve this by telling Kael'thas about Anveena. However, Kil'jaeden, who knew that giving the prince hope of the Sunwell's restoration could ruin his carefully laid plans to turn Kael'thas into a pawn of the Legion, had his agents ensure Lor'themar's messages never reached Kael'thas. The demon lord needed Kael'thas to remain desperate and to believe that only the Legion could offer him a future.\nKael'thas could not hide his dark alliance forever. Kael'thas had left a bloody mark on Outland, and his most significant defectors -- the &lt;a href=\"Scryers\"&gt;Scryers&lt;/a&gt; -- worked tirelessly to show their people that the sin'dorei would face destruction if they continue to follow Kael'thas. Many of the Horde's blood elves did not accept these stories at first. It was not until they arrived in &lt;a href=\"Netherstorm\"&gt;Netherstorm&lt;/a&gt; and saw for themselves that the truth was laid bare. Kael'thas had embraced fel magic and become the Burning Legion's pawn; he was their prince no longer.\nWord of this reached Lor'themar and the sin'dorei in Quel'Thalas. The news broke their hearts, but they came to a consensus: Kael'thas was lost, and it was their duty to vanquish him and end his treachery. The Horde made war on Kael'thas and his followers, assaulted his fortress of Tempest Keep, and defeated him in battle. Yet Kael'thas was not killed. Kil'jaeden had predicted his defeat, and prepared accordingly: the demons spirited him away and kept him alive with fel magic, ensuring his survival at the cost of his remaining sanity -- he was now Kil'jaeden's servant and would do whatever was asked of him. \nFury of the Sunwell.\nNorth of Quel'Thalas, Kael'thas and his last loyal soldiers invaded the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Isle of Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt;, the Sunwell's resting place. Under Kil'jaeden's direction, Kael'thas captured both M'uru and Anveena and took them to the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell%20Plateau\"&gt;Sunwell Plateau&lt;/a&gt;. The fallen prince leeched their powers, supplementing them with the arcane energy harvested on Outland, and rekindled the Sunwell's energies as a gateway through which his master could enter Azeroth. As he worked, some blood elves informed the Horde leadership of what was transpiring. One of these leaders was Liadrin, the Blood Knight matriarch, who had witnessed Kael seize M'uru from Silvermoon herself. She traveled to Shattrath to renounce her loyalty to Kael'thas and vow to destroy the Burning Legion. Her assistance was welcomed, and added the blades of her Blood Knights to the newly-formed &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Sun%20Offensive\"&gt;Shattered Sun Offensive&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Shattered Sun Offensive marched on the Sunwell and began battling with &lt;a href=\"Sunfury\"&gt;Kael'thas' forces&lt;/a&gt;. Though constantly besieged by demons, Liadrin and her allies had an impact. They disrupted Kael'thas's spellwork long enough for more help to arrive.\nMembers of the Horde and Alliance soon converged on the Sunwell and stood alongside the Shattered Sun Offensive. Liadrin directed the Horde's champions to hunt down Kael'thas in the &lt;a href=\"Magisters%27%20Terrace\"&gt;Magisters' Terrace&lt;/a&gt;. Though the twisted prince had grown more powerful since his defeat at Tempest Keep, the Horde slew him and ended his threat once and for all. Kael'thas, who had fallen with a cry for Quel'Thalas on his lips upon his defeat at Tempest Keep, met death a ranting madman. His death marked the downfall of the Sunstrider dynasty. Meanwhile, the Alliance assaulted the Sunwell Plateau and battled with Kil'jaeden himself once the demon lord had torn his way through the Sunwell. The Alliance's efforts had little effect until Anveena sacrificed her own existence, expending what was left of her energy to weaken the demon lord; it was just enough to banish him and close his gateway into Azeroth.\nThe Burning Crusade was halted, but there were consequences. Kael'thas' meddling had tainted the Sunwell. As before, corruptive energies coursed through the fount, and they would soon spread throughout Quel'Thalas and engulf the blood elves. Lor'themar Theron and his followers considered destroying the Sunwell again, but another solution presented itself.\n&lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt;, the prophet of the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;, had come to the Sunwell to pay his respects to M'uru. Little was left of the naaru, save for its heart. Velen sensed a glimmer of power \u2013 of hope \u2013 in what remained of M'uru. He used the naaru's heart to cleanse the Sunwell and transform it into a fount of Holy Light and arcane magic. Its brilliant energy blazed across land and sky for all in Quel'Thalas to see, and Velen noted that this would be the first step to rebirth the soul of the nation.\nThis turn of events had a profound effect on the blood elves and their kingdom. The Sunwell was reborn, and its return heralded a promising future for Quel'Thalas. With the fount to draw on, the elves no longer needed to scavenge elsewhere to satisfy their cravings for magic, and the blood elf paladins, who once wielded the Light through discordant and unsustainable means, could now access their powers through the Sunwell.\nRecent times.\nThe past few years had seen unprecedented changes in the eternal realm of Quel'Thalas, from one &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;near-calamity&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;another&lt;/a&gt;. With the restoration of the Sunwell, a bright future now lies ahead for Quel'Thalas.\nReinvigorated, the blood elves fight to protect Quel'Thalas, conquer their magical addiction with the Sunwell's sustainment, and help redeem the soul of their ancient people.\nIn the wake of Prince Kael'thas's betrayal, &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; has become the de facto leader of the country, continuing to style himself as its Regent Lord. With the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Isle of Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt; back under blood elf control, the Sunwell has been reinforced and open only to native visitations. The remnants of the &lt;a href=\"Sunfury\"&gt;Sunfury&lt;/a&gt; forces have also returned home following the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt;, put to the task of defending Quel'Thalas's borders with the Farstriders. Quel'Thalas was likely the first target for the new &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; empire brewing in &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt;. Ranger-general &lt;a href=\"Halduron%20Brightwing\"&gt;Halduron Brightwing&lt;/a&gt; joined forces with &lt;a href=\"Darkspear\"&gt;Darkspear&lt;/a&gt; Chieftain &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vereesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Vereesa Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; to counter this threat.\nFollowing the Purge of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Aethas%20Sunreaver\"&gt;Archmage Aethas Sunreaver&lt;/a&gt; (and the escaped &lt;a href=\"Sunreavers\"&gt;Sunreavers&lt;/a&gt; themselves) returned home to Quel'Thalas. In response, &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Halduron%20Brightwing\"&gt;Thalassian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Rommath\"&gt;leadership&lt;/a&gt; moved to assemble &lt;a href=\"Sunreaver%20Onslaught\"&gt;their forces&lt;/a&gt;, noting that the time had come for the blood elves to take matters into their own hands.\nLor'themar moves the &lt;a href=\"Sunreaver%20Onslaught\"&gt;Sunreaver Onslaught&lt;/a&gt; forces against the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor%20Offensive\"&gt;Kirin Tor Offensive&lt;/a&gt; to lay claim to &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen\"&gt;Emperor Lei Shen&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;island stronghold&lt;/a&gt; and the treasures contained therein. Lor'themar's reasoning is twofold: for justice, and to claim the emperor's weaponry for himself, as leverage against Garrosh. Lor'themar suspects that a Horde uprising is on the cards, and believes it is best to be prepared for it. Ultimately, the Regent Lord acquires the leverage he had sought to find on the isle: heroes of the Horde deliver to the regent lord a crystal charged with the power of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Animus\"&gt;Dark Animus&lt;/a&gt;, which Lor'themar uses to re-empower a dormant &lt;a href=\"Animus%20Golem\"&gt;Animus Golem&lt;/a&gt; at the promontory. Lor'themar puts his top archmages to the task of extensively studying it to harnessing their power as leverage against Garrosh should the Horde fall to anarchy.\nFollowing the declaration of &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Rebellion\"&gt;rebellion&lt;/a&gt; against Garrosh, the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; sent reinforcements across the sea from &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, planning to regroup them with the rest of the rebels to make the final push against the &lt;a href=\"True%20Horde\"&gt;True Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith the massive &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"War%20in%20Draenor\"&gt;invasion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Liadrin\"&gt;Liadrin&lt;/a&gt; commands a force named the &lt;a href=\"Sunsworn\"&gt;Sunsworn&lt;/a&gt;, a military force of &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;. Headed by the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knight\"&gt;Blood Knight&lt;/a&gt;s, they have combined forces with &lt;a href=\"Elven%20ranger\"&gt;rangers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Magisters\"&gt;magi&lt;/a&gt; and based themselves in &lt;a href=\"Talador\"&gt;Talador&lt;/a&gt;. They have also deployed the blood elves' &lt;a href=\"Life%20Blood\"&gt;recently-acquired&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"blood%20golem\"&gt;blood golem&lt;/a&gt; technology.\nDuring preparations for the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, a group of blood elf paladins uses the power of the Sunwell to enchant their Horde allies' weapons with holy might. The priests of Netherlight Temple later retrieve a fragment of Light from the Sunwell, among other holy places on Azeroth.\nLater, during the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20rebellion\"&gt;Nightfallen rebellion&lt;/a&gt;, many portals were created between Silvermoon and &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt;. The blood elven forces arrived at &lt;a href=\"Meredil\"&gt;Meredil&lt;/a&gt; from the city to support the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20%28faction%29\"&gt;nightfallen&lt;/a&gt; rebels in their attempt to seize the city from its &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;-aligned masters.\nSilvermoon and &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar City&lt;/a&gt; maintained good relations following the &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20rebellion\"&gt;rebellion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thalyssra\"&gt;Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt;'s rise to power. Lor'themar, seeing much in common between the sin'dorei and &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;shal'dorei&lt;/a&gt; kingdoms, invited their new leader to Silvermoon for a visit; Thalyssra soon after pledged Suramar to the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. The regent also entertained &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, who had come in an attempt to convince Silvermoon to leave the Horde and ally with the Alliance, but this offer was rejected. Alleria instead sought out &lt;a href=\"Void%20elf\"&gt;exiles&lt;/a&gt; from Silvermoon who had been banished for dabbling in the &lt;a href=\"void\"&gt;void&lt;/a&gt;, which the blood elf leaders consider a threat to the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt; and all Quel'Thalas.\nPeople and culture.\nQuel'Thalas was the fruit of its founder's quest to reignite Highborne culture. &lt;a href=\"Dath%27Remar%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Dath'Remar Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; had intended Quel'Thalas to dwarf the night elves' civilization and stand as a monument to the ages. In defiance of kaldorei traditions, the Highborne rejected the old ways, the goddess &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt; and the moon, choosing instead to embrace the sun. In contrast to the &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Empire\"&gt;Kaldorei Empire&lt;/a&gt;, which once stretched the breadth of Kalimdor, there is no evidence that Quel'Thalas ever claimed territory beyond the &lt;a href=\"Thalassian%20Pass\"&gt;Thalassian Pass&lt;/a&gt;. Quel'Thalas is known as the \"Land of Eternal Spring\", owing to the magically-enchanted radiance that bathes the kingdom in perpetual brightness; its healthier woodlands stand in stark contrast to the scourged &lt;a href=\"Ghostlands\"&gt;Ghostlands&lt;/a&gt; and much of plagued Lordaeron to the south.\nAt the heart of the kingdom's culture is the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;. At the height of their glory, the elves prospered in its glow, their way of life only made possible due to it: its energies empowered the magi who built the kingdom and enabled many of the spells that informed their day-to-day lives, as well as providing great protection over their capital. The Sunwell was bound to all the elves of Quel'Thalas, feeding them magic unceasingly. Its destruction during the &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20invasion%20of%20Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Scourge invasion of Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; dealt a devastating blow to the elves who survived the onslaught, leaving them with an insatiable hunger for the very magic that once built their kingdom. Since the Sunwell's restoration as a fount of both arcane and &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt; energies, those who treat with its cosmic opposite, the &lt;a href=\"void\"&gt;void&lt;/a&gt;, are considered a danger to the well.\nMagic plays a central role in Quel'Thalas, as essential to many elves as eating or breathing. The Highborne's refusal to abandon the practice of magic was the reason they had been banished across the sea, and they used their great magical power to build their new kingdom. Prince &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; described magic in Quel'Thalas as all-encompassing, the birthright of every citizen.\nThe people of Quel'Thalas are largely insular and isolationist. Having long sought exclusion from others, Quel'Thalas is not amply connected to other lands, although its pact with the Horde has allowed its citizens to travel via translocation, portal, or zeppelin to friendly territories. Most sin'dorei are content to live out their entire lives in the confines of &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt;. Quel'Thalas proved an aloof and reluctant ally of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, committing minimal official aid and eventually withdrawing from the coalition entirely. However, the great tragedies of its past have left the kingdom no longer able to stand alone: in the wake of the Scourge invasion of Quel'Thalas, its people were on the verge of extinction. With enemies on all sides, Quel'Thalas turned to the reformed &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; for support, each needing the other.\nSomething originating from Quel'Thalas is called \"Thalassian\", or \"Quel'Thalassian\".\nFilm universe.\nThe elven kingdom of Quel'thalas participated in the council that would eventually lead to the creation of the .\nSpeculation.\nSuccession?\nWith the fall of the &lt;a href=\"Sunstrider%20dynasty\"&gt;Sunstrider dynasty&lt;/a&gt;, Quel'Thalas no longer has a clear line of succession. Although power was transferred from &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas\"&gt;Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt; to his regent, &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;, neither man has any surviving family members and Theron does not wish to start his own dynasty, continuing to style himself regent lord. Furthermore, Kael'thas decreed that &lt;a href=\"Anasterian%20Sunstrider\"&gt;his father&lt;/a&gt; would be the last king of Quel'Thalas, and thus far this has been respected. If Lor'themar were to fall, it is possible that in the absence of a designated successor, &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Rommath\"&gt;Grand Magister Rommath&lt;/a&gt; would come into power; his current station is arguably the highest in the kingdom below Lor'themar's. Alternatively, power might pass to &lt;a href=\"Halduron%20Brightwing\"&gt;Halduron Brightwing&lt;/a&gt; as Quel'Thalas' military leader.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

Most quests are given by by an &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt; (non-player character). However, some quests can come from right-clicking signs (usually the &lt;a href=\"wanted%20poster\"&gt;wanted poster&lt;/a&gt; type), reading scrolls or documents, opening containers, using certain looted items (which will say \"Begins a quest\" on the tooltip when moused over), or from completing a previous quest (chain quest). Until you reach the maximum level, a quest will also reward you with &lt;a href=\"Experience%20point\"&gt;Experience Points&lt;/a&gt; (XP). After that, you will receive gold instead. Many quests will also reward you with &lt;a href=\"reputation\"&gt;reputation&lt;/a&gt; from the same faction as the NPC quest giver.\nThere are currently more than 34,000 quests in \"World of Warcraft\". The initial design had only 100 &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; quests, 100 &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; quests and 100 &lt;a href=\"neutral\"&gt;neutral&lt;/a&gt; quests planned for the whole game.\nThe has articles on many specific quests. This list may not be as comprehensive as database sites such as &lt;a href=\"Wowhead\"&gt;Wowhead&lt;/a&gt;, but the quest articles have the advantage of being a summary of information on a quest, as opposed to a long list of sometimes conflicting or old comments added to the raw quest data. \nNew quests can be added to Wowpedia by reading , using the to record the details and adding categories for the starting zone, obtainable at level (e.g. ) and other as appropriate. Then update the main zone quest guide page, and any pages for the quest giver or starting item.\nFor a complete list of quests available, see the page.\nStarting out.\nDepending on your &lt;a href=\"race\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt; you will &lt;a href=\"Newbie_Guide%23Starting_Areas\"&gt;start in a different geographical region&lt;/a&gt; with some common quests and some &lt;a href=\"race\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"class\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt;-specific quests with several low-level creatures around and a limited number of &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt;s. Many of the quests in \"World of Warcraft\" are single-step, but there will often be multiple followup quests that turn into a long quest series.\nMany NPCs can offer you more than one quest; when talking to them, you'll get a window giving you the option to select which quest you wish to talk to them about, using the same symbols as appear over their heads. To find out the quest or the status of an uncompleted quest, &lt;a href=\"talk\"&gt;talk&lt;/a&gt; to the NPC with a quest status indicator. Occasionally as you adventure in Azeroth, you may encounter &lt;a href=\"drop\"&gt;drop&lt;/a&gt;ped or &lt;a href=\"Fixed%20Device\"&gt;fixed&lt;/a&gt; items that will give out quests when activated (right-clicked).\nTry to get and finish all the quests in a given geographic locale before moving on to a higher-level area with new quests. The reason for this is that other quests may send you in different directions and into other map areas. By the time you get back to the original quest track, the quests have gone gray. They can still be accomplished, but any items received will be below your current level, the XP will be much less helpful, and the cash, if any, will be small change compared to the amounts you are currently bringing in from looting and selling &lt;a href=\"vendor%20trash\"&gt;vendor trash&lt;/a&gt; items. However, if it is a member of a long quest chain, it may be worth completing gray quests, because later ones may be for your level or even for above your level.\nIdentifying quest givers.\nYou can identify quest giving &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt;s from indicators over their heads:\nAlso as of patch 2.3, you can identify quest givers by the pointer change when you move it over them:\nAlso as of &lt;a href=\"patch%202.3.2\"&gt;patch 2.3.2&lt;/a&gt;, you can identify quest enders (completed quest) by the pointer change when you move it over them:\nIf you have completed a quest but you might not want to turn it in yet (because your bags are full, for instance), you can return to it later at any time. However, until you turn it in, the quest ender will continue to display a gold question mark (), so you will not know if they have a new quest for you until you turn it the completed quest or speak to them as if to turn it in.\nLow level quests.\nIf a quest is considered too low level for your character (if it will have a gray color in your log), it will be much less visible. By default, an exclamation point () will not appear above the quest giver's head, nor will one appear on the minimap without an extra step (see below). Since &lt;a href=\"patch%202.3\"&gt;patch 2.3&lt;/a&gt;, the quest title in the quest giver's talk window will also be tagged \"(Low Level)\".\nBefore &lt;a href=\"patch%203.0.2\"&gt;patch 3.0.2&lt;/a&gt;, a low-level quest could be discovered only by mousing over (or interacting with) its quest giver. Since 3.0.2, selecting \"Low Level Quests\" on the minimap radar will display exclamation points () for every available quest, including those considered \"low level\". This also causes a dull exclamation point to appear over NPCs offering low-level quests.\nQuest types.\nIn \"World of Warcraft\", quests are separated into several broad categories:\nSolo quests.\nMost quests are intended to be completed by a single player, but depending on the quest, different classes may have differing levels of difficulty completing quests.\nGroup quests.\nIn the quest text a group quest will have a recommended number of players to complete this type of quest. These number estimates are conservative and some 2 player quests can be easily soloed while others may be slightly difficult with given number of players. Many quests recommending 3-4 players can be done with 2 players.\nPreviously called an \"elite\" quest.\nDungeon quests.\nRequires an objective inside an instance. Other than that they can be similar to solo and group quests.\nHeroic quests.\nFor non-raiders, these are the hardest quests as they require completion inside a Heroic mode, non-raid instance. These are the hardest types of non-raid quests to complete for players of the recommended level range. These quests can also be a variant of a daily quest which tends to be slightly easier.\nRaid quests.\nRequires an objective inside a raid instance or involving an outdoor raid boss. Besides the Heroic quests, these are the hardest types of quests to complete for players of the recommended level range. This is the only quest type that can be done while in a raid group\nPvP quests.\nThese quests require players complete them while flagged for PvP and usually in a PvP battleground or zone. These quests can also be a variant of a daily quest which may be tied to a specific battleground or can be very tedious and often are ignored by PvP oriented players.\nRepeatable quests.\nMost quests are of the standard type (). However, some can be repeated indefinitely (or at least until some maximum is hit) and can be identified by the blue or over the head of the &lt;a href=\"Quest%20Giver\"&gt;quest giver&lt;/a&gt; whether or not you have the requisite items. The symbol remains a blue after you turn it in again. Such repeatable quests are quite frequently begun by a normal quest, and once you've completed that quest it appears as is described.\nMost repeatable quests are repeatable reputation quests (&lt;a href=\"RRQ\"&gt;RRQ&lt;/a&gt;s) for increasing your reputation with a particular &lt;a href=\"faction\"&gt;faction&lt;/a&gt;. See the &lt;a href=\"repeatable%20reputation%20quest\"&gt;repeatable reputation quest&lt;/a&gt; article for a list. Contrary to the type of quest described just above, for example, the &lt;a href=\"Timbermaw\"&gt;Timbermaw&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Felwood\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Winterspring\"&gt;Winterspring&lt;/a&gt; want you to prove to them that you're on their side. In this case, each time you turn in the quest, rather than having a blue question mark, you get a familiar gold exclamation point.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Faire\"&gt;Darkmoon Faire&lt;/a&gt; has special repeatable quests that both increase reputation and allow you to collect tickets for rewards.\nTechnically these quests cannot be done indefinitely, since they stop appearing if a reputation maximum is reached.\nDaily quests.\n&lt;a href=\"Daily%20quest\"&gt;Daily quest&lt;/a&gt;s are a sub-type of repeatable quests that you may only do once per 24 hours. The exact reset hour depends on the realm, but it never changes, is chosen to be in the early AM, and will not coincide with the instance reset. Each character used to be limited to 25 quests of this type they could do a day, until the limit was removed in \"&lt;a href=\"Mists%20of%20Pandaria\"&gt;Mists of Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;\".\nDaily quests come in normal, profession, heroic, and PvP subtypes.\nWeekly quests.\n&lt;a href=\"Weekly%20quest\"&gt;Weekly quest&lt;/a&gt;s are a sub-type of repeatable quests that you may only do once per week, often resetting on Tuesday for US servers and Wednesday for EU servers.\nMonthly quests.\n&lt;a href=\"Monthly%20quest\"&gt;Monthly quest&lt;/a&gt;s are a sub-type of repeatable quests that you may only do once per month. Very few quests do this, most notably the profession quests at the &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Faire\"&gt;Darkmoon Faire&lt;/a&gt; are monthly quests, since the faire is only available one week out of each month.\nSeasonal quests.\nSeasonal quests are available during short time (from one day to two weeks) at special time of year. They can be both normal and daily; some normal quests can be repeatable during the next season.\nBonus Objectives.\nWhen you walk around a zone, new objectives might appear randomly in your quest list. Completing the objectives will reward you with extra experience, and leaving the area will drop the quest. However, if it is partially completed, credit will not be erased.\n&lt;a href=\"Rare%20mob\"&gt;Rare mob&lt;/a&gt;s in the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt; has a bonus objective to kill them.\nLegendary quests.\nLegendary quests gives &lt;a href=\"legendary%20items\"&gt;legendary&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"artifact\"&gt;artifact&lt;/a&gt; items. During \"Battle for Azeroth\", it was the main storyline quests such as the &lt;a href=\"War%20Campaign\"&gt;War Campaign&lt;/a&gt;.\nCampaign quests.\nCampaign quests are the main storyline to a specific zone or expansion.\nImportant quests.\nImportant quests unlock important features and rewards.\nCallings.\nCallings are special daily quests related to the &lt;a href=\"Covenant\"&gt;Covenant&lt;/a&gt;s of . Unlike regular daily quests, Callings have a timer of three days. Each day a new calling becomes available, with a maximum of three callings to be possible to have active. In addition to being listed in the Quest Log under \"Callings\", they are also listed on the Covenant Report.\nSee the following categories for list of all callings:\nQuest variations.\nMost standard quest tasks take one of the following forms with a variety of &lt;a href=\"quest%20objective\"&gt;quest objective&lt;/a&gt;s:\nNOTE: Some quests have a time limit, which is counted down in a clock that appears under the mini-map.\nQuest rewards.\nMost &lt;a href=\"reward\"&gt;reward&lt;/a&gt;s take the form of &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"money\"&gt;money&lt;/a&gt;, but some quests (especially &lt;a href=\"class\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt;-specific ones) give &lt;a href=\"Ability\"&gt;abilities&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"spell\"&gt;spell&lt;/a&gt;s. Some of the more desirable reward items include &lt;a href=\"quality\"&gt;quality&lt;/a&gt; or better items or &lt;a href=\"recipe\"&gt;recipe&lt;/a&gt;s for use with &lt;a href=\"profession\"&gt;profession&lt;/a&gt;s. All quests tend to include &lt;a href=\"XP\"&gt;XP&lt;/a&gt; as part of the reward, although some repeatable reputation quests do not reward XP.\nAdditional notes:\nQuest chains.\nA quest chain (also known as \"questline\" or similar terms) is a series of quests connected in the sense that when quest A is completed, quest B becomes available. The majority of quests in the game are connected in quest chains, and progressing along quest chains provide much of the game's story element.\nManaging a quest log.\nCurrently active quests are listed with their status and details in the &lt;a href=\"Quest%20Log\"&gt;Quest Log&lt;/a&gt; (L key). Quests can also be shared with other &lt;a href=\"party\"&gt;party&lt;/a&gt; members. A player can be in the process of completing (or completed but not turned in) up to 25 quests at any one time. A warning will sound and a small message appears if you try to accept a quest when you already have 25 quests.\nSharing quests.\nTo share a quest, open the &lt;a href=\"Quest%20Log\"&gt;Quest Log&lt;/a&gt;, select a quest and click Share Quest at the bottom of the window. Each member of the party who is in the vicinity will be prompted whether they want to join the quest. Once you've tried to share a quest, the following things may happen:\nSome quests will not be sharable, since they apply only to the player who accepted the quest. If the option to accept the quest is not given to a party member, they will not receive credit for having helped complete it. If accepting the quest gives an item which is required to do the quest, the quest is usually not shareable.\nAbandoning quests.\nQuests can be abandoned with no penalty by clicking Abandon Quest in the Quest Log, except that the player must find the quest giver again to pickup the quest again. The Cancel button in the Quest Log just closes the window and does not affect any selected quests. There will be a warning that the special quest items already obtained (if there are any) will be destroyed when the quest abandoned. This does not include normal, non-quest items needed for some quests.\n\"Kill X of Y\" quests.\nAny quests that require you to kill \"X\" amount of something will have you restart at 0 killed if/when you pick up the quest again. This will affect all kill counters for any single quest, regardless of the number of different items needed to kill.\n\"Collect X of Y\" quests.\nIf the items you are collecting are marked as \"Quest item\" you will lose those items when you abandon the related quest. Items, such as trade goods, which are not quest items will not be lost.\nQuests that have you collect \"X\" amount of something though will be updated to show the current amount you have collected (on person or in bank) if/when you pick up the quest again.\nThe quests that are most easily abandoned are the ones that come from drops that you have found. This way you can just reactivate the item and get the quest right back. Also, other good quests to drop (in case you need to) are the ones you get from &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt;s in the area of your &lt;a href=\"Hearthstone\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;-bound inn. This way you don't have to travel far to re-obtain them. It could be inconvenient, however, if you suddenly decide to do a quest that you get from there, yet you have to travel quite some distance to arrive at where you complete the quest. It can be very difficult to juggle quests. It would be helpful to write down what quests you've seen, where to get them, and where they're completed, and where you turn them in, so you can do several quests at once in one area."}

Happy pets dealt 25% more damage than normal, and unhappy pets dealt 25% less. With patch 4.1.0, happiness was removed. Feeding a pet now heals it but has no other effect.\nHappiness affected only hunter &lt;a href=\"pet\"&gt;pet&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Warlock\"&gt;Warlock&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Death%20Knight\"&gt;Death Knight&lt;/a&gt; pets are unaffected.\nHappiness levels.\nThe happiness of a pet is shown beside the pet's &lt;a href=\"portrait\"&gt;portrait&lt;/a&gt; and in his pet &lt;a href=\"paper%20doll\"&gt;paper doll&lt;/a&gt; as a small smiley face icon. This icon shows the states of happiness your pet goes through:\nEach level spans about 350 happiness points. So if your pet just dropped from Happy to Content, it will require food for 350 happiness to get it to maximum happiness.\nGaining happiness.\nThe most basic way to increase the happiness of your pet is by &lt;a href=\"Feed%20Pet\"&gt;feeding it&lt;/a&gt;. One feeding will give the pet 10 bites of food, distributed over 20 seconds. Depending on the quality of the food, each bite will give 8, 17 or 35 happiness, for a total of 80, 170 or 350 per feeding. You can follow the gain in happiness in the &lt;a href=\"combat%20log\"&gt;combat log&lt;/a&gt;. If your pet attacks or is attacked during the feed period, the feeding is interrupted.\nHowever, glyphs and talents allow ways of increasing (or maintaining) a pet's happiness without food.\nWith the &lt;a href=\"Glyph%20of%20Mend%20Pet\"&gt;Glyph of Mend Pet&lt;/a&gt;, the pet gains happiness whenever the &lt;a href=\"Mend%20Pet\"&gt;Mend Pet&lt;/a&gt; spell is used. Feeding pets is not necessary with this glyph. A big advantage of the glyph is that it allows the pet to gain happiness while it is in combat. A pet cannot fight and gain happiness via &lt;a href=\"Feed%20Pet\"&gt;Feed Pet&lt;/a&gt; because it stops eating when entering combat and won't eat while in combat.\n&lt;a href=\"Pet%20talents%23Ferocity\"&gt;Ferocity&lt;/a&gt; pets may learn the &lt;a href=\"Bloodthirsty\"&gt;Bloodthirsty&lt;/a&gt; talent, which allows them to gain happiness during combat. This can allow the hunter to get away with not carrying any pet food at all, provided the pet is used in combat frequently enough to allow the talent to proc. &lt;a href=\"Pet%20talents%23Tenacity\"&gt;Tenacity&lt;/a&gt; pets may learn &lt;a href=\"Guard%20Dog\"&gt;Guard Dog&lt;/a&gt;, which increases happiness whenever &lt;a href=\"Growl%20%28pet%20ability%29\"&gt;Growl (pet ability)&lt;/a&gt; is used.\nAs of &lt;a href=\"patch%204.0.1\"&gt;patch 4.0.1&lt;/a&gt;, pets in the Bear family also have a new ability &lt;a href=\"Rest%20%28pet%20ability%29\"&gt;Rest (pet ability)&lt;/a&gt; which grants 40 happiness over 12 seconds.\nLosing Happiness.\nThings that make a pet lose happiness are:\nMounting up will make your pet disappear, but it will not make it lose any happiness. The pet does not lose happiness over time while the Hunter is mounted."}

He will spin up in a Whirlwind, so combatants should leave melee range when he starts casting it. His signature ability is Spear Barrage, which fires a large number of spears all over the area, typically in a line passing through the adventurer's position. Get out of the red circles on the ground, which indicate where the spears will land."}

He tried to beseech her wisdom and advice at her temple, although he convinced himself otherwise, possibly because of knowing the loa's anger with the prophets. However, she is seemingly not out to kill him.\nShe is the only survivor of the Drakkari god slaughter.\nHistory.\nAfter the Drakkari turned on their gods, Har'koa was the last of the gods to be subdued and the trolls were quick to use her power in order to &lt;a href=\"Cursed%20Offspring%20of%20Har%27koa\"&gt;curse her children&lt;/a&gt;. After &lt;a href=\"Witch%20Doctor%20Khufu\"&gt;Witch Doctor Khufu&lt;/a&gt; was able to contact other gods, adventurers were sent to aid Har'koa. After freeing her children Har'koa sent the adventurers to help other loa, specifically &lt;a href=\"Rhunok\"&gt;Rhunok&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Quetz%27lun\"&gt;Quetz'lun&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Akali\"&gt;Akali&lt;/a&gt;. She was also saddened that she couldn't aid other loa such as &lt;a href=\"Mam%27toth\"&gt;Mam'toth&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile able to aid the other loa, Akali was ultimately slain by &lt;a href=\"Prophet%20of%20Akali\"&gt;his prophet&lt;/a&gt;, which caused Har'koa and Witch Doctor Khufu to work together on ensuring his death. Har'koa personally aided adventurers in fighting against the prophet, in order to ensure his death. Following this she sent adventurers to meet with &lt;a href=\"Tol%27mar\"&gt;Tol'mar&lt;/a&gt;, who directed them to destroy the &lt;a href=\"Gundrak\"&gt;Gundrak&lt;/a&gt; leadership."}
