He is a servant of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt; and seeks to usher in his masters' vision of conquering all of the worlds in the universe. His plans were surprisingly rewarded when he was picked up by the naaru. He must have corrupted &lt;a href=\"Warden%20Mellichar\"&gt;Warden Mellichar&lt;/a&gt; into releasing all the prisoners in the Arcatraz.\nSkyriss uses the same model as &lt;a href=\"The%20Prophet%20Skeram\"&gt;The Prophet Skeram&lt;/a&gt;, and appears as the 4th and final mob of a multi wave encounter in the &lt;a href=\"Arcatraz\"&gt;Arcatraz&lt;/a&gt; wing of &lt;a href=\"Tempest%20Keep\"&gt;Tempest Keep&lt;/a&gt;. The encounter is begun by engaging &lt;a href=\"Warden%20Mellichar\"&gt;Warden Mellichar&lt;/a&gt;. The warden will in turn open the four orbs along the walls of the room, and finally wake up Skyriss. There are two different varieties of each mini-boss. If the mini-bosses are killed quick enough, there's time for regeneration out of combat between them. The encounter can be reset by running out, after a certain wait time Mellichar will respawn, just like after a wipe.\nMany of the mini-bosses, as well as Skyriss himself, are based on classic \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" raid bosses.\n\"Note: The encounter is not able to be reset if you wipe after Harbinger Skyriss appears but before he becomes attackable (this can happen if a party wipes on the final orb mini-boss). An instance reset is required to reset the encounter if this occurs.\"\nAdventure Guide.\n\"The naaru believed the persuasive voice of Harbinger Skyriss was silenced when they contained him and forced him into a long, dreamless sleep. The unfortunate warden of Arcatraz learned the naaru were wrong. Skyriss had just enough energy to speak to Warden Mellichar in a still, small voice. Time took care of the rest.\"\nAbilities.\nFirst Prison Cell.\nWhen Warden Mellichar enters combat, he opens the first prison cell, releasing either a Blazing Trickster or a Phase-Hunter.\nSecond Prison Cell.\nShortly after unlocking the first prison cell, Warden Mellichar unlocks the second prison cell, releasing Millhouse Manastorm.\nThird Prison Cell.\nImmediately after realizing that the second prison cell only contains Millhouse Manastorm, Warden Mellichar unlocks the third prison cell containing either a Sulfuron Magma-Thrower or an Akkiris Lightning-Waker.\nFourth Prison Cell.\nShortly after unlocking the third prison cell, Warden Mellichar unlocks the fourth prison cell containing either a Blackwing Drakonaar or a Twilight Drakonaar.\nStrategy.\nSkyriss behaves much like from the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Temple of Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt;. The clones have less hitpoints and a somewhat reduced set of abilities. They have a normal non-stunning Mind Flay which deals less damage than the original, however if Skyriss and the clone both use their flay/rend on the same person that person will most likely die.\nHealing is the key to this fight. Secondary healers should wear their best healer outfit. The job of the backup healer is to keep Millhouse alive, and to make sure the main healer survives when he's affected by the mind flay.\nHow to deal with Skyriss' abilities:\n1. Skyriss clones\n2. Random Target Mind Rend\n3. Mind Control \nShadow Protection buff is helpful to resist or break the MC early as well as the mindflay.\nA warlocks Felhunter pet can use \"Devour Magic\" on fears/mind rends/mind control debuffs.\nMages can blink or ice block out of the mind flay, minimizing the damage they take.\nA Rogue in melee range will attract every fear and many mind controls; conscientious rogues will equip their PvP trinket and use it early in the fight to absorb as much CC as they can. Bear in mind that &lt;a href=\"Cloak%20of%20Shadows\"&gt;Cloak of Shadows&lt;/a&gt; can be used by Skyriss while you are Mind Controlled, and break the effect early.\nHunters - make sure to get a Snake Trap out, Skyriss will Mind Flay the snakes, saving you a few Mind Flays and making it easier on your healer."}

Reflecting on what &lt;a href=\"A%27dal\"&gt;A'dal&lt;/a&gt; told him in &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath&lt;/a&gt;, Med'an decides that he needs to know what his father can tell him if he is to make the right choices. While flying above &lt;a href=\"Deadwind%20Pass\"&gt;Deadwind Pass&lt;/a&gt;, Med'an tells Maraad that he'll meet his uncle back in Theramore and proceeds to suddenly teleport off of his &lt;a href=\"gryphon\"&gt;gryphon&lt;/a&gt;, arriving in a room in Karazhan where a projection of Medivh is standing in front of a chess board.\nFirst, the illusion explains that it is not Medivh himself, but a &lt;a href=\"Echo%20of%20Medivh\"&gt;vessel of his remaining power&lt;/a&gt; that has been waiting for years to deliver Medivh's message to his son. He continues that Med'an needs to know the true meaning of the game he is about to play, and for that he must know his history so that he doesn't repeat his father's mistakes. The echo knocks the game board aside, transforming the room into a &lt;a href=\"Chess%20Event\"&gt;giant chess board&lt;/a&gt; with life-sized pieces resembling &lt;a href=\"Garona%20Halforcen\"&gt;Garona&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nielas%20Aran\"&gt;Nielas Aran&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt;, with Medivh in the king's position. Med'an's clothing is also transformed from his simple vest into a suit of armor.\nMed'an's echo begins to recount the &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt;'s life, starting with how his mother Aegwynn refused to surrender her Guardian powers and instead transferred them into her son, not knowing that he had been possessed by &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; before his birth. Aegwynn gave Medivh to his father Nielas Aran to raise, but when the boy came of age, Sargeras' power instantly awakened within him, killing Nielas and throwing Medivh into a coma for twenty years. Upon awakening, Medivh warred with Sargeras, but the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; proved the stronger and led the Guardian to create the Dark Portal and unleash the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s on Azeroth. The orcs sent Medivh an emissary in the form of Garona, whom Medivh even then realized was of mixed orc and &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; descent. Garona was unaware of Medivh's possession and his actions; she knew only that she came to care for him. Medivh reciprocated her feelings, and in a moment of defiance when Sargeras' attention was turned elsewhere, they conceived Med'an. Shortly after, Garona and Khadgar discovered Medivh's crimes and informed Anduin Lothar, leading to the Guardian's demise. Later, Medivh returned and became a true Guardian of Tirisfal by using his remaining power to forge the union of mortal races that &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;achieved victory&lt;/a&gt; over the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;. Now, however, Medivh is gone, and only his \"last echo\" remains on Azeroth.\nMedivh's echo finishes that the knowledge he has kept hidden for years is now Med'an's, for the old game is ended and a new one is about to begin. Med'an's garb transforms again, this time into a mix of the plate armor and his usual, humbler gear. When Med'an asks what he should do, Medivh's echo replies that he and Garona's fates were fixed before they were born, but their son's power is his birthright to use in any way he wishes; his path and destiny will be of his own choosing. This is Medivh's greatest gift to his son, and he asks that Med'an use it wisely in whatever game he chooses to play. With that, the echo vanishes, and Med'an finds himself on a transformed chess board, this time with himself in the king's position and with &lt;a href=\"Valeera%20Sanguinar\"&gt;Valeera&lt;/a&gt;, Maraad, Aegwynn, &lt;a href=\"Meryl%20Felstorm\"&gt;Meryl&lt;/a&gt;, and Garona as the pieces around him. On the opposing side of the board are pieces representing &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt; minions. Med'an declares that he will \"play the game before him\" by facing \u2014 and destroying \u2014 Cho'gall in &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;. With that, he teleports away, leaving Karazhan behind.\nMeanwhile, Cho'gall's elementals rampage through &lt;a href=\"Sentry%20Point\"&gt;Sentry Point&lt;/a&gt; on their path to Theramore. As the elementals surround the island keep, &lt;a href=\"Krank%20Axeljink\"&gt;Krank&lt;/a&gt; reminds the other council members of his invention and asks them to place the helmets on their heads. Meryl objects, but Aegwynn and the others feel that there is little to lose and agree to do as Krank says. Wearing the master helmet, the &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt; climbs up onto a window ledge and tells the others to channel their power into the machine so that it'll meld their different magic forms into a single blast that Krank can unleash on their attackers. The power in the machine steadily builds until it reaches a crescendo, at which point the device suddenly explodes, instantly killing Krank and blowing open a giant hole in the side of the &lt;a href=\"mage%20tower\"&gt;mage tower&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe elementals descend on the remaining council members, who are left with no choice but to fight back as best they can. Not long after, Dalynnia and Maraad arrive on their mounts and join the battle. &lt;a href=\"Hamuul%20Runetotem\"&gt;Hamuul&lt;/a&gt; is struck down by one of the elementals. &lt;a href=\"Kathra%27natir\"&gt;Kathra'natir&lt;/a&gt; tells Meryl that he is too weak to prevail against the attackers and offers to help him, which Meryl accepts. The &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; drains the life force from Maraad's injured &lt;a href=\"gryphon\"&gt;gryphon&lt;/a&gt; to power a blast of &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; magic that he and the &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; unleash on the elementals. Aegwynn admonishes Meryl, but only a few moments later, Med'an finally returns from Karazhan to join the fight.\nMeanwhile in &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt;, Cho'gall is busy conducting a ritual. He tells his &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; followers to stand back, declaring that soon the &lt;a href=\"anubisath\"&gt;anubisath&lt;/a&gt;s will awaken and there will be \"an evocation of power such as this world has never seen\". With the &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt; distracted, Garona slips into &lt;a href=\"C%27Thun\"&gt;C'Thun&lt;/a&gt;'s chamber and begins to climb into the dead god's body to search for the base of &lt;a href=\"Atiesh%2C%20Greatstaff%20of%20the%20Guardian\"&gt;Atiesh&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn Theramore, the battle continues. Med'an calls on his &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; power and the blessing of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; to drive off the elementals. Meryl asks why he doesn't just kill them, to which Med'an replies that the elementals don't serve their master willingly and should be freed rather than destroyed. Kathra'natir concurs and points out that Meryl is weakening; soon, the dreadlord will be the master. While Meryl is busy arguing with his inner &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;, an elemental appears and knocks him to the ground. The mage manages to tell &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina&lt;/a&gt; to begin the ritual of sharing and feed her power into Med'an. Jaina does so, with Maraad and &lt;a href=\"Rehgar%20Earthfury\"&gt;Rehgar&lt;/a&gt; quickly joining in on the effort. Greatly empowered, Med'an unleashes a single massive blast against the elementals, but is himself knocked unconscious by the feedback of power.\nAn unexpected visitor arrives in &lt;a href=\"Flight%20Form\"&gt;Flight Form&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Broll%20Bearmantle\"&gt;Broll Bearmantle&lt;/a&gt;. Seeing that the battle is not yet done, he lands on the ruined tower and summons roots from the ground to crush all of the remaining elementals. Afterwards, Hamuul and Valeera bid Broll welcome. The &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; explains that &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt; is rapidly recovering and, since &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral&lt;/a&gt; can handle the rest of the healing process alone, he gave Broll leave to go to Theramore. Meryl and Aegwynn tend to the unconscious Med'an, remarking that they simply shoved the power at him even though he hadn't been properly prepared, and that the feedback problem is one of the reasons for why a Guardian needs to be consecrated in a formal ceremony.\nSome time thereafter, while the rest of the council convenes, Med'an awakens in his room with Aegwynn sitting by the side of his bed. He states that he knows Aegwynn is his grandmother and recounts his meeting with Medivh's echo in Karazhan. Aegwynn comments that her arrogance was her son's undoing, but Med'an is her redemption. She continues that the rest of the council will want Med'an to be their Guardian, but he must keep the identity of his father a secret since they'll shun him if they find out he is Medivh's son. However, Med'an believes that the council will understand and states that he has had enough of lies and secrets; the council must know and accept who he is if he is to be their Guardian.\nMeanwhile, in a nearby chamber, Meryl is reciting the prophecy he overheard from Cho'gall in Ahn'Qiraj to Broll, Valeera, Rehgar, Hamuul, Dalynnia, &lt;a href=\"High%20Priest%20Rohan\"&gt;Rohan&lt;/a&gt;, Jaina, and Maraad. Med'an and his grandmother enter the room, and they, Maraad, and Meryl openly reveal Med'an's parentage to the rest of the council. As the boy is the only person among them with the necessary abilities, the council unanimously agrees to make him their Guardian. Meryl points out that they'll need to perform the investiture ceremony, but first also create a place safe from Cho'gall's attacks where the council can reside. Meryl also states that he himself will not be on the council, as Kathra'natir is growing in power and he can't allow the dreadlord access to the other council members, since he has wielded fel magic. The demon angrily replies that Meryl will soon be his, in both body and soul.\nIn Ahn'Qiraj, Cho'gall \u2014 standing in a burning ritual circle and surrounded by anubisaths \u2014 declares that the winds have carried Med'an's boast to him and his master. As the ogre's visage appears in the clouds above Theramore, he announces that all the preparations have been made and that he awaits meeting Med'an in Silithus."}

One of those meat slabs landed clear over here! Nice work there!\nNotes.\nThe hulking jormungar hit cloth-wearers for upwards of 1300 a swing. Unload as much damage as you possibly can in as short of a period of time as possible as they show weakness and open their mouth around the 80% mark (which is roughly 10,000 HP). You've got a few seconds to throw the item into their mouth when \"The Hulking Jormungar falters for a moment, opening its mouth wide.\" A good dozen Jormungar Meat will spawn on the ground around the hulking jormungar. Move fast, as they despawn fairly quickly!"}

The dwarves not only survived but flourished, spreading southward and into what would later become &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; and the other continents."}

The unknown figure raises three undead abominations and slowly tortures the three missing paladins. After destroying the monsters, saving the paladins, and finding the holy water, the Highlord returns to Grayson. \nOnce the barding have been imbued, Grayson rides out to the Slaughter House. Unfortunately, the shadowy figure stole the body and took Rivendare's mount for his own. Making himself known as &lt;a href=\"Raemien%20the%20Soultaker\"&gt;Raemien the Soultaker&lt;/a&gt;, he confronts the paladins with countless undead outside. \nRaemien is killed and &lt;a href=\"Shadowmane\"&gt;Shadowmane&lt;/a&gt; is contained by Grayson and his paladins. They bring it to Light's Hope Chapel where they purify it and the Highlord accepts it as his own."}

Considering he cowered beneath the power of just one of these beings for years, he felt that all of them accessing the world through the Cataclysm would shatter it.\nIn the RPG.\nApparently not all the Twilight's Hammer followers are the skilled &lt;a href=\"warlocks\"&gt;warlocks&lt;/a&gt; they purport to be. A warlock called Highlord Demitrian got a bit greedy raising the crystals of Silithus from beneath the sands. It seems he tried to enslave a powerful air elemental called Thunderaan, but got caught himself. Now he and his men serve the wind elemental, searching the area for a talisman.\nDemitrian was recruited at an early age by the Twilight's Hammer, who found him a willing and able student of the &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;'s art - a rare feature in a human. He grew quickly in rank and power, earning the rank of highlord at an unusually young age. Unfortunately, his brashness led to overconfidence. While serving at a post in the Crystal Vale in Silithus, he learned secret ways to soothe and control the enraged air elementals there. Convinced he could bend any elemental to his will, he dared assault an enormous wind elemental called &lt;a href=\"Thunderaan\"&gt;Thunderaan&lt;/a&gt;. Instead of taking control of the elemental, Demitrian fell under its sway. Soon after, the forces of air demolished the Twilight's Hammer outpost, but Demitrian was allowed to live as Thunderaan's servant. Now he searches for the remaining essences of his master, torn from him by Ragnaros in ages past.\nSpeculation.\nConsidering he serves the Windlord, it is likely\u2014and outright stated in the non-canon &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20RPG\"&gt;Warcraft RPG&lt;/a&gt;\u2014that Demitrian is a rare example of a human shaman introduced prior to the &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiran%20%28playable%29\"&gt;Kul Tiran&lt;/a&gt; shaman in \"\"."}

After the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; reopened, he officially replaced &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Kazzak\"&gt;Lord Kazzak&lt;/a&gt; (now in Outland's &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;) as the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s field commander in Azeroth.\nBiography.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nBefore the Burning Legion was about to strike at Azeroth from Outland, Kruul was tasked to kill Illidan Stormrage. The two battled but Kruul was eventually defeated and left the fight through a portal. Kruul then set on his next task, retrieving the &lt;a href=\"Glaive%20of%20the%20Aspects\"&gt;Aspect Shards&lt;/a&gt; for his master &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Kazzak\"&gt;Kazzak&lt;/a&gt;. Kruul succeeded in this task.\nWhen the defenders of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; pushed the demonic forces back through the Dark Portal to &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;, Kruul joined his forces at the &lt;a href=\"Stair%20of%20Destiny\"&gt;Stair of Destiny&lt;/a&gt; to fight them. Unbeknownst to the Azerothian forces, Kruul was attacked by &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"demon%20hunter\"&gt;demon hunter&lt;/a&gt;s who distracted him long enough for &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; to kill him with a blast of fel magic that tore a hole through his torso. Without Kruul to command them the demons fell into disarray, allowing the Alliance and Horde to gain a foothold at the Stair of Destiny. They would never learn that the Illidari had saved them from certain defeat at the hands of Kruul.\nLegion.\nSoon after Kruul's death at the hands of the Illidari, the Illidari were imprisoned by the &lt;a href=\"Wardens\"&gt;Wardens&lt;/a&gt;. During that imprisonment, the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; locked Kruul's heart away in the vaults of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; to keep the Legion from retrieving it. Many years later, during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Legion's third invasion&lt;/a&gt; of Azeroth, the demons finally broke into Dalaran's vaults and stole Kruul's heart despite &lt;a href=\"Kor%27vas%20Bloodthorn\"&gt;Kor'vas Bloodthorn&lt;/a&gt;'s attempts to stop them. &lt;a href=\"Prophet%20Velen\"&gt;Prophet Velen&lt;/a&gt; discovered that Kruul's minions stole his heart to hasten his return within the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;, and sent Kor'vas and an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Stair%20of%20Destiny\"&gt;Stair of Destiny&lt;/a&gt; to pry open a way into Kruul's realm.\nKor'vas worked to reactivate the portal that Kruul's lackeys had left behind, while defended by the adventurer from demons that were trying to stave them off while Kruul was regenerating. After the death of &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Vazuun\"&gt;Lord Vazuun&lt;/a&gt;, Kor'vas decided that the two of them could not defeat Kruul alone and sent the adventurer back to Dalaran to report to the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Six\"&gt;Council of Six&lt;/a&gt; while she kept the portal stabilized. &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Modera\"&gt;Archmage Modera&lt;/a&gt; vowed to prepare an assault on his lair, and &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Karlain\"&gt;Archmage Karlain&lt;/a&gt; ensured that the Illidari were given all the supplies that Dalaran could spare.\nLater, the adventurer, Kor'vas, and Velen confronted Kruul &lt;a href=\"Kruul%27s%20world\"&gt;inside the Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;. He claimed to be empowered by the souls of a thousand conquered worlds and killed most of his own minions to empower himself further. &lt;a href=\"Inquisitor%20Variss\"&gt;Inquisitor Variss&lt;/a&gt; captured Kor'vas, but after Velen and the adventurer killed him to free her, Kruul attacked. Before he could die Kruul overloaded himself with power to self-destruct and kill his opponents along with him, but Velen saved Kor'vas and the adventurer. Because he died inside the Twisting Nether, Kruul is now dead for good.\nIn World of Warcraft.\nFrom the &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.worldofwarcraft.com/index.xml\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt; news page under patch 2.0.3:\nIt is also reported that Lord Kazzak was seen departing through the Dark Portal. In his stead he has left his minion, Highlord Kruul, to sow fear and confusion among the defenders.\nAccompanied by a host of &lt;a href=\"infernal\"&gt;infernal&lt;/a&gt;s, Kruul has been seen near a number of major cities in Azeroth (a possible reference to the near legendary kites of his predecessor &lt;a href=\"Doom%20Lord%20Kazzak\"&gt;Doom Lord Kazzak&lt;/a&gt;), along with the following outdoor areas:\nPreparation.\nAfter finding Highlord Kruul you will need a well geared/skilled raid. The best places to engage him are the above zones, far away from major cities so that wandering players aren't killed (this avoids the 70k heal). Due to the short enrage timer, he will put out more damage, so he requires a larger raid with more healing, dps, and tanks to finish him quicker than Kazzak.\nBefore pulling it is important to note a few things. First, there will be a flaming area near his spawn point that periodically releases level 50 &lt;a href=\"Infernal%20Hound%20%28Dark%20Portal%20Opens%29\"&gt;Infernal Hound&lt;/a&gt;. They can be easily killed to avoid them attacking healers. Second, at each spawn there will be two boss infernals, these are easily pulled and killed away from Kruul and do not respawn. They also drop a BoE blue, so finding Kruul before he is killed could be quite profitable.\nAbilities.\nMost of his abilities are copies from &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Kazzak\"&gt;Lord Kazzak&lt;/a&gt;, which is fitting since he is Kazzak's minion.

It is one of the last great frontiers of the isles, named in honor of &lt;a href=\"Huln%20Highmountain\"&gt;Huln Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; for his bravery in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nLong ago, the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt; sought to claim Highmountain. Their campaign was led by &lt;a href=\"Uul%27gyneth\"&gt;Uul'gyneth&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Huln%20Highmountain\"&gt;Huln Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; gathered heroes from among the tribes, and fought against Uul'gyneth's servants, the &lt;a href=\"Necrodark\"&gt;Necrodark&lt;/a&gt;. Yet the forces of shadow were too great to overcome. So Huln devised another plan. Wards were placed to lock away the Old Gods' influence. Though the general survived, Uul'gyneth's essence was trapped.\nLegion.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"war%20in%20Draenor\"&gt;war in Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; began to invade Azeroth through the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; of Highmountain, descended from Huln Highmountain and other tauren who had fought in the War of the Ancients, had been living in peace with the local &lt;a href=\"drogbar\"&gt;drogbar&lt;/a&gt; for generations, but when the Legion invaded, the drogbar stole the tauren's sacred artifact, the &lt;a href=\"Hammer%20of%20Khaz%27goroth\"&gt;Hammer of Khaz'goroth&lt;/a&gt;. The Highmountain are now at risk of being taken over by the drogbar and their king &lt;a href=\"Dargrul%20the%20Underking\"&gt;Dargrul the Underking&lt;/a&gt;, ruling his kin from the &lt;a href=\"Neltharion%27s%20Lair\"&gt;former lair&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;aspect&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Neltharion\"&gt;Neltharion&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs is his habit when new parts of the world are ready to be discovered, the one and only &lt;a href=\"Hemet%20Nesingwary\"&gt;Hemet Nesingwary&lt;/a&gt; makes his way to the mountains of the Broken Isles in search of new and exotic dangerous animals to hunt.\nThe wards bounding Uul'gyneth began to weaken just enough for the Darkness to seep through, and the Necrodark began to summon Uul'gyneth into the physical realm. Though Uul'gyneth did manage to incarnate itself, it was defeated by a &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt one point, an &lt;a href=\"eredar\"&gt;eredar&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Despoiler%20Egrothar\"&gt;Despoiler Egrothar&lt;/a&gt; desecrated the sacred burial sites of the Highmountain tribe, raising the bodies of the dead. The &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Order of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; sent their troops to kill the demon and put them back to rest. They also made contact with a &lt;a href=\"tribe\"&gt;tribe&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20tauren\"&gt;Highmountain tauren&lt;/a&gt;, who had an excess supply of furs and leather, after they took down a &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; incursion led by a &lt;a href=\"doomguard\"&gt;doomguard&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Raidmaster%20Sorthol\"&gt;Raidmaster Sorthol&lt;/a&gt; who stood in their way.\nGeography.\nThe namesake mountain of this region, &lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20Peak\"&gt;Highmountain Peak&lt;/a&gt;, is among the tallest mountains in all of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, and the Highmountain range which surrounds it is filled with untamed wilds, deep canyons, fertile valleys, and icy peaks. Because the waters of Highmountain flow into &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stormheim\"&gt;Stormheim&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Val%27sharah\"&gt;Val'sharah&lt;/a&gt;, the area serves as the lifeblood of virtually every region on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;. Below the surface of the region lies an infinite network of tunnels and caverns, with steam and warmth implying potential volcanic activity.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

It is the highest point in the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;. The mountain's trails and outposts are maintained by the &lt;a href=\"Skyhorn%20tribe\"&gt;Skyhorn tribe&lt;/a&gt;. Only two settlements can be found on Highmountain Peak: &lt;a href=\"Greystone\"&gt;Greystone&lt;/a&gt;, and the secluded &lt;a href=\"Ironhorn%20Enclave\"&gt;Ironhorn Enclave&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeography.\nThe mountain is composed of three large, snow covered peaks with two valleys in between them. The center peak is the highest. Many cave systems run beneath the mountain, including &lt;a href=\"Neltharion%27s%20Lair\"&gt;Neltharion's Lair&lt;/a&gt;. As the altitude gets higher, most of the vegetation cannot survive so the mountain is mainly comprised of a light grey colored rock and snow.\nMountain trail.\nOnly one small path ascends the mountain. Buffeted by howling winds and covered by thick snow, the trail is seldom maintained. It starts at &lt;a href=\"Summitcrest%20Basecamp\"&gt;Summitcrest Basecamp&lt;/a&gt;, found in the &lt;a href=\"Snowblind%20Mesa\"&gt;Snowblind Mesa&lt;/a&gt;. As it ascends you pass a drogbar controlled settlement called &lt;a href=\"Greystone\"&gt;Greystone&lt;/a&gt;. The path continues up the mountain, winding along cliff faces. It reaches the top of the first peak at &lt;a href=\"Frosthoof%20Watch\"&gt;Frosthoof Watch&lt;/a&gt;, and a large bridge spans across to the next peak. After the bridge the path splits in two. To the left it leads down to &lt;a href=\"Ironhorn%20Enclave\"&gt;Ironhorn Enclave&lt;/a&gt;, and continuing straight will lead to the rest of the mountain. Progressing straight, the path passes the highest point of the mountain; a small piece of &lt;a href=\"Weathered%20Parchment\"&gt;weathered parchment&lt;/a&gt; acknowledges this. The path continues to another bridge called &lt;a href=\"Sanderhorn%27s%20Span\"&gt;Sanderhorn's Span&lt;/a&gt;. Which leads to the final area of the peak, &lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20Summit\"&gt;Highmountain Summit&lt;/a&gt;.\nWildlife.\nThe most notable wildlife found on the mountain are the &lt;a href=\"Highpeak%20Goat\"&gt;Highpeak Goat&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Snowfoot%20Fox\"&gt;Snowfoot Fox&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Snowshoe%20Hare\"&gt;Snowshoe Hare&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Hawk%20Owl\"&gt;Northern Hawk Owl&lt;/a&gt;s can also be seen however they are not as common."}

During the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, 10,000 years ago, he united the warring &lt;a href=\"Rivermane%20tribe\"&gt;Rivermane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bloodtotem%20tribe\"&gt;Bloodtotem&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Skyhorn%20tribe\"&gt;Skyhorn&lt;/a&gt; tribes of his homeland under the banner of the Highmountain. Huln was chosen by &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Krasus&lt;/a&gt; to lead his people against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; alongside &lt;a href=\"Unng%20Ak\"&gt;Unng Ak&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Dungard%20Ironcutter\"&gt;Dungard Ironcutter&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"earthen\"&gt;earthen&lt;/a&gt;. For his bravery during the war, Huln received a blessing from the &lt;a href=\"Wild%20God\"&gt;Wild God&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;, so that his people would forever have the demigod's favor: the &lt;a href=\"Horns%20of%20Eche%27ro\"&gt;Horns of Eche'ro&lt;/a&gt;, which transformed the horns of Huln and his followers into moose-like antlers. After the war, Huln returned to his homeland and used a &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; artifact known as the &lt;a href=\"Hammer%20of%20Khaz%27goroth\"&gt;Hammer of Khaz'goroth&lt;/a&gt; to banish the traitorous &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspect\"&gt;Dragon Aspect&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; and free his &lt;a href=\"drogbar\"&gt;drogbar&lt;/a&gt; slaves as well as &lt;a href=\"Ebyssian\"&gt;a single uncorrupted black dragon egg&lt;/a&gt;. In his honor, the four tribes named the region \"&lt;a href=\"Highmountain\"&gt;Highmountain&lt;/a&gt;\".\nLegion.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; who founded the &lt;a href=\"Unseen%20Path\"&gt;Unseen Path&lt;/a&gt; left &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; to return to the Broken Isles, the Highmountain &lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; recognized the nobility of their cause and offered them friendship. It was the descendants of &lt;a href=\"Huln%20Highmountain\"&gt;Huln Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; who led the Unseen Path to &lt;a href=\"Talon%20Peak\"&gt;Talon Peak&lt;/a&gt; where they built their base known as &lt;a href=\"Trueshot%20Lodge\"&gt;Trueshot Lodge&lt;/a&gt;. Since the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s return, the Highmountain have helped restore the lodge, such as replacing two damaged watch towers with tauren structures.\nMillennia later, Huln's descendants continue to live in &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Totem\"&gt;Thunder Totem&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;. With the death of &lt;a href=\"Ulan%20Highmountain\"&gt;High Chieftain Ulan&lt;/a&gt;, his daughter &lt;a href=\"Mayla%20Highmountain\"&gt;Mayla&lt;/a&gt; has become the High Chieftain of the accord between Highmountain, Rivermane, Skyhorn and Bloodtotem. Unfortunately, the theft of the Hammer of Khaz'goroth by &lt;a href=\"Dargrul\"&gt;Dargrul the Underking&lt;/a&gt; and his drogbar has shattered the unity of the four tribes. Despite the attempts at a reunion of the tribes by an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;, the Bloodtotem betrayed the other tribes by joining the Burning Legion. In their place, the drogbar &lt;a href=\"Navarrogg\"&gt;Navarrogg&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Stonedark%20tribe\"&gt;Stonedark tribe&lt;/a&gt; joined the Highmountain's cause instead.\nJoining the Horde.\nAfter corresponding with Chieftain &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; in the aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20Campaign\"&gt;Argus Campaign&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mayla%20Highmountain\"&gt;Mayla Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; accepted an invitation to attend a feast in &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt;. Yet, when Baine and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champion&lt;/a&gt; greeted their Highmountain tauren guests, &lt;a href=\"Spiritwalker%20Ebonhorn\"&gt;Spiritwalker Ebonhorn&lt;/a&gt; was tormented by the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods%27%20forces\"&gt;Old Gods' forces&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Uul%27gyneth\"&gt;Uul'gyneth&lt;/a&gt; attempting to corrupt him, and he and Mayla were forced to retreat back to &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Totem\"&gt;Thunder Totem&lt;/a&gt; while Baine and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; champion defended Thunder Bluff from Uul'gyneth's invasion force. Apparently, the wards Ebonhorn had been maintaining in &lt;a href=\"Highmountain\"&gt;Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; weakened just enough to let the Darkness seep through. \nLater on, Baine and the Horde champion traveled to Thunder Totem to offer their aid to mend Ebonhorn, who has been fighting unconsciously to keep a darkness from consuming him. Mayla sent the Horde champion to &lt;a href=\"Spiritwalker%20Graysky\"&gt;Spiritwalker Graysky&lt;/a&gt;, who has the Horde champion undergo &lt;a href=\"Spiritwalker\"&gt;Spiritwalker&lt;/a&gt; rituals to walk in the memories of &lt;a href=\"Igrul%20the%20Scalebane\"&gt;Igrul the Scalebane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Oenia%20Skyhorn\"&gt;Oenia Skyhorn&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Huln%20Highmountain\"&gt;Huln Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; in order to restore the wards that kept the dark corrupting forces at bay. After restoring the wards, Ebonhorn regained consciousness and revealed Uul'gyneth sought to return and conquer Highmountain. Baine, Mayla, the Horde champion, and Ebonhorn left to join &lt;a href=\"Lasan%20Skyhorn\"&gt;Lasan Skyhorn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Aviash\"&gt;Aviash&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Jale%20Rivermane\"&gt;Jale Rivermane&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20Summit\"&gt;Highmountain Summit&lt;/a&gt; to thwart the &lt;a href=\"Necrodark\"&gt;Necrodark&lt;/a&gt;'s ritual to incarnate Uul'gyneth and restore the final ward. They failed however, and Uul'gyneth was summoned into the physical realm, leaving the Horde champion little choice but to vanquish Uul'gyneth the Darkness. After the battle, Mayla expressed her gratitude for rescuing her people from the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt;.

Divided into four tribes (&lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20Tribe\"&gt;Highmountain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rivermane%20tribe\"&gt;Rivermane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Skyhorn%20tribe\"&gt;Skyhorn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bloodtotem%20tribe\"&gt;Bloodtotem&lt;/a&gt;), they are the direct descendants of the tauren led by &lt;a href=\"Huln%20Highmountain\"&gt;Huln Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; who assisted the &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Resistance\"&gt;Kaldorei Resistance&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;. During the war, Huln received a blessing from &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;, so that his people would forever have the demigod's favor, granting them the Horns of &lt;a href=\"Eche%27ro\"&gt;Eche'ro&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"moose\"&gt;moose&lt;/a&gt;-like antlers. Additionally, the Highmountain tauren appear larger in stature in comparison to their cousins in Kalimdor.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"drogbar\"&gt;drogbar&lt;/a&gt;, who had previously lived in peace with the Highmountain, rose up and stole the sacred &lt;a href=\"Hammer%20of%20Khaz%27goroth\"&gt;Hammer of Khaz'goroth&lt;/a&gt;, shattering the unity of the four tribes. The tauren found aid from &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s from outside Highmountain, who defeated the drogbar and recovered the Hammer. Not long afterward, the Highmountain tauren joined their kin from &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; as members of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nWar of the Ancients.\nThe peaks and valleys of &lt;a href=\"Highmountain\"&gt;Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; have been home to four ancient tauren tribes for millennia: &lt;a href=\"Rivermane%20tribe\"&gt;Rivermane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Skyhorn%20tribe\"&gt;Skyhorn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bloodtotem%20tribe\"&gt;Bloodtotem&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20Tribe\"&gt;Highmountain&lt;/a&gt;. For generations, the tribes fought each other upon the mountain. Countless lives and even entire tribes were lost in the bloodshed, until one day, &lt;a href=\"Huln%20Highmountain\"&gt;Huln&lt;/a&gt; of the Highmountain tribe found his people slaughtered by an unfamiliar foe. Though battling with grief, he managed to convince the warring tribes to unite under his own banner to face this new threat: the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nJoining with the &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Resistance\"&gt;Kaldorei Resistance&lt;/a&gt; alongside the &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"earthen\"&gt;earthen&lt;/a&gt;, Huln and his tauren played a crucial role in several battles during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;. For his bravery and his rescue of the &lt;a href=\"moose\"&gt;moose&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Eche%27ro\"&gt;Eche'ro&lt;/a&gt;, Huln and his people received a blessing from the &lt;a href=\"Wild%20God\"&gt;Wild God&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;, so that they would always have the demigod's favor: the Horns of Eche'ro. After the war, Huln returned home. With the aid of a powerful artifact known as the &lt;a href=\"Hammer%20of%20Khaz%27goroth\"&gt;Hammer of Khaz'goroth&lt;/a&gt;, he banished the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; from the region and liberated the dragon's &lt;a href=\"drogbar\"&gt;drogbar&lt;/a&gt; slaves. In Huln's honor, the four tribes renamed their homeland \"Highmountain\".\nLegion.\nFor centuries, the Highmountain tauren tribes protected the Hammer of Khaz'goroth and lived in peace alongside the drogbar. However, soon after the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s arrival on the isles, a drogbar leader by the name of &lt;a href=\"Dargrul\"&gt;Dargrul&lt;/a&gt; rose up and shattered their unity by stealing the hammer and killing &lt;a href=\"Ulan%20Highmountain\"&gt;High Chieftain Ulan&lt;/a&gt;, intending to use the artifact's immense power to take control of the region. In response, &lt;a href=\"Mayla%20Highmountain\"&gt;Mayla Highmountain&lt;/a&gt;, daughter of Ulan and his heir, enlisted the aid of &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s in order to stop Dargrul and reunite the scattered tribes. Despite their efforts, the &lt;a href=\"Bloodtotem%20tribe\"&gt;Bloodtotem tribe&lt;/a&gt; betrayed their brethren by joining the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. In their place, the drogbar &lt;a href=\"Navarrogg\"&gt;Navarrogg&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Stonedark%20tribe\"&gt;Stonedark tribe&lt;/a&gt; joined the Highmountain's cause instead.\nJoining the Horde.\nAfter corresponding with Chieftain &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; in the aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20Campaign\"&gt;Argus Campaign&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mayla%20Highmountain\"&gt;Mayla Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; accepted an invitation to attend a feast in &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt;. This was the first time that the Highmountain tauren had visited &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. Yet when Baine and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champion&lt;/a&gt; greeted their Highmountain tauren guests, &lt;a href=\"Spiritwalker%20Ebonhorn\"&gt;Spiritwalker Ebonhorn&lt;/a&gt; was tormented by the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods%27%20forces\"&gt;Old Gods' forces&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Uul%27gyneth\"&gt;Uul'gyneth&lt;/a&gt; attempting to corrupt him, and he and Mayla were forced to retreat back to &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Totem\"&gt;Thunder Totem&lt;/a&gt; while Baine and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; champion defended Thunder Bluff from Uul'gyneth's invasion force. Apparently, the wards Ebonhorn had been maintaining in &lt;a href=\"Highmountain\"&gt;Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; weakened just enough to let the Darkness seep through. \nLater on, Baine and the Horde champion traveled to Thunder Totem to offer their aid to mend Ebonhorn, who has been fighting unconsciously to keep a darkness from consuming him. Mayla sent the Horde champion to &lt;a href=\"Spiritwalker%20Graysky\"&gt;Spiritwalker Graysky&lt;/a&gt;, who has the Horde champion undergo &lt;a href=\"Spiritwalker\"&gt;Spiritwalker&lt;/a&gt; rituals to walk in the memories of &lt;a href=\"Igrul%20the%20Scalebane\"&gt;Igrul the Scalebane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Oenia%20Skyhorn\"&gt;Oenia Skyhorn&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Huln%20Highmountain\"&gt;Huln Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; in order to restore the wards that kept the dark corrupting forces at bay. After restoring the wards, Ebonhorn regained consciousness and revealed Uul'gyneth sought to return and conquer Highmountain. Baine, Mayla, the Horde champion, and Ebonhorn left to join &lt;a href=\"Lasan%20Skyhorn\"&gt;Lasan Skyhorn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Aviash\"&gt;Aviash&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Jale%20Rivermane\"&gt;Jale Rivermane&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20Summit\"&gt;Highmountain Summit&lt;/a&gt; to thwart the &lt;a href=\"Necrodark\"&gt;Necrodark&lt;/a&gt;'s ritual to incarnate Uul'gyneth and restore the final ward. They failed however, and Uul'gyneth was summoned into the physical realm, leaving the Horde champion little choice but to vanquish Uul'gyneth the Darkness. After the battle, Mayla expressed her gratitude for rescuing her people from the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt;. Impressed by the strength and courage of the Horde, Mayla and Baine traveled to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; to pledge the Highmountain tauren to the Horde.\nAppearance and culture.\nThe Highmountain tauren appear largely similar to their &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; cousins, with the main difference being their prominent antler-like Horns of Eche'ro, rather than the more bovine-looking horns seen on &lt;a href=\"yaungol\"&gt;yaungol&lt;/a&gt;, tauren and &lt;a href=\"taunka\"&gt;taunka&lt;/a&gt;. Both males and females have these antlers, though the ones seen on females are much smaller. The Highmountain tauren inscribe and decorate their antlers to show their particular tribe affiliation or even their rank within that tribe. \nMuch like the Kalimdor tauren, the Highmountain tauren worship the &lt;a href=\"Earth%20Mother\"&gt;Earth Mother&lt;/a&gt; and her two eyes, &lt;a href=\"An%27she\"&gt;An'she&lt;/a&gt; (the &lt;a href=\"sun\"&gt;sun&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Mu'sha&lt;/a&gt; (the &lt;a href=\"White%20Lady\"&gt;White Lady&lt;/a&gt;). It is, however, unclear if they acknowledge the &lt;a href=\"Sky%20Father\"&gt;Sky Father&lt;/a&gt;.\nNot all Highmountain tauren are &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s, but those that are typically commemorate their first kill with a ceremonial drum, stretched with the hide of their quarry. Most trailhead drums are made with rabbithide or foxhide. Hunters typically carry them for the rest of their lives. &lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20War-Drum\"&gt;Highmountain War-Drum&lt;/a&gt;s are used in &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Totem\"&gt;Thunder Totem&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is customary for a widow, child, or grandchild to keep a pyrestone from the funeral pyre of an especially loved one. These stones are carried in a pocket and rubbed for courage, comfort, or in remembrance of a lost companionship. The Highmountain tauren warn their children to never follow a drogbar into a cave.\nFor centuries, the Highmountain tauren have fought the &lt;a href=\"basilisk\"&gt;basilisk&lt;/a&gt;s in the Highmountain mesas. The basilisks have adapted to the tauren as thoroughly as the tauren have adapted to the beasts.\nMounts and companions.\nThe Highmountain tauren frequently use the large and powerful &lt;a href=\"moose\"&gt;moose&lt;/a&gt; of Highmountain as mounts or cook their meat as food. &lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20Elderhorn\"&gt;Highmountain elderhorns&lt;/a&gt; are the favored mount of Highmountain hunters, able to leap across the rushing rivers of &lt;a href=\"Pinerock%20Basin\"&gt;Pinerock Basin&lt;/a&gt; even when saddled with a full-sized tauren. The tauren train the sure-footed &lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20Thunderhoof\"&gt;Highmountain thunderhoof&lt;/a&gt; moose to safely traverse the paths and peaks of Highmountain. At one point, moosebone was the most common material for fishhooks: solid enough to carve a barb into, but pliable enough not to break off in the mouth of a large salmon. Many tauren fishermen carved elaborate designs into their \"lucky hooks\". The Highmountain tribes cherish the hide of a rare and elusive creature, the &lt;a href=\"Majestic%20Elderhorn\"&gt;Majestic Elderhorn&lt;/a&gt;, for their most important ceremonies.\nThe enormous &lt;a href=\"eagle\"&gt;Great Eagles&lt;/a&gt; of Highmountain are revered by the &lt;a href=\"Skyhorn%20tribe\"&gt;Skyhorn tribe&lt;/a&gt;, who use them as mounts in much the same way as the &lt;a href=\"Frostborn\"&gt;Frostborn&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Peaks\"&gt;Storm Peaks&lt;/a&gt;.\nTribes.\nAdditionally, the &lt;a href=\"Prepfoot\"&gt;Prepfoot&lt;/a&gt; are a recently-formed group who believe that &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; has not been defeated and will soon return to Highmountain and cause the ocean to swallow the entire region. Their founder and leader is &lt;a href=\"Trand%20Prepfoot\"&gt;Trand Prepfoot&lt;/a&gt;, and they are found exclusively in the &lt;a href=\"Prepfoot%20Compound\"&gt;Prepfoot Compound&lt;/a&gt;."}

The &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20dwarf\"&gt;Wildhammer dwarves&lt;/a&gt; (aka &lt;a href=\"Wild%20dwarf\"&gt;wild dwarves&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard%20dwarf\"&gt;Bronzebeard dwarves&lt;/a&gt; have been described as having hill dwarves or &lt;a href=\"Mountain%20dwarf\"&gt;mountain dwarves&lt;/a&gt;. Hill dwarves are earthier and love to live subterranean lives in holes in the ground. Hill dwarves are shorter (by about six inches) and stockier than the &lt;a href=\"wild%20dwarves\"&gt;Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt; mountain dwarves.\nThe Bronzebeard hill dwarves share old enmities with their &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20dwarf\"&gt;Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt; cousins. When the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; attacked Khaz Modan, most of the dwarves escaped, however a few Bronzebeard hill dwarves' escape routes were cut off and they were stuck behind enemy lines. They were forced to go underground more so than they previously had done before. Many had died at the time, and more died while the Horde held the land. Only four clans of Bronzebeard hill dwarves were left in Khaz Modan. One clan (&lt;a href=\"Rom%27s%20clan\"&gt;Rom's clan&lt;/a&gt;) was left with forty-seven members where it once numbered in the hundreds. Two of the clans were larger than the first, and the fourth was either the same size or smaller than the first. Between the four clans, the number of individuals totalled three-hundred and a little over, which was only a small fraction of the number they once were in the land. A clan of Bronzebeard hill dwarves helped take back an area near &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;. They thought they could claim the mountain fortress and all of Grim Batol as theirs again.\nWetlands dwarf?\nIt is possible that that Rom's dwarves are connected to the Ironforge dwarves living in the Wetlands.\nIt seems that \"hill dwarf\" was originally a term for a Bronzebeard dwarf of Khaz Modan, before the latter term was cemented. \"Night of the Dragon\" seems to confirm this by clarifying Rom's heritage."}

It's by her grace that we were granted the ability to shift forms and take to the skies.\nAviana was both beautiful and terrible, like the great birds of prey she counted among her children. She lived in the towering spirit realm of &lt;a href=\"G%27hanir\"&gt;G'hanir&lt;/a&gt;, the Mother Tree, but appeared on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; in the form of a great winged goddess.\n&lt;Choluna's face darkens.&gt;\nTen thousand years ago demons flooded across Azeroth in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;. Aviana called her children to the skies and fought off the demon hordes from the front lines. Her wrath was inescapable.\nHundred feel before the fury of her talons. But ultimately she was surrounded by &lt;a href=\"Doomguard\"&gt;Doomguard&lt;/a&gt;s, their barbed lances piercing her sides...\nIt is said that her blood itself attacked the demons, searing their flesh, destroying them even as she herself fell from the sky.\nAviana perished on the battlefield that day, but the mortal races and the remaining ancients ultimately triumphed. The first druids found her body among the carnage, and bore it up her, to &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;the highest mountain&lt;/a&gt;.\nShe was laid to rest just outside this shrine, within a circle of sacred stones.\nA seed of G'hanir was used to planet the &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt;, and it is all that remains of that sacred realm, which otherwise perished with her."}

Once he reaches the area, Sam situates himself directly opposite Doji, and 6 male pandaren Challengers appear. These friendly NPCs appear near to Doji, and for a time are stationary. They then gather together into the exact center of the area, and begin... to dance. Because the 6 pandaren are all standing on the exact same spot, the visual effect is quite unusual. After a while, the Challengers split up and move around the area, briefly pausing to perform dance moves. The process is repeated as the Challengers gather together once more to dance in the center of the area, before again separating to travel around the area performing dance moves. \nAfter repeating this sequence a number of times, Sam the Wise stirs and begins the walk back to his normal dwelling place. The moment he moves, all of the Challengers go into &lt;a href=\"stealth%20%28mechanic%29\"&gt;stealth&lt;/a&gt;, and move rapidly off in different directions as Sam crosses the area. The stealthed pandaren, still visible to the player (if sufficiently close), move erratically around the area for a time before disappearing, one by one."}

This is mostly useful if you want to have enough space so that you can modify the macros further.\nNote that these techniques tend to make the macros less easy to understand for a human being.\nImportant info.\nAlways save your original macro.\nAlways test your macro after modifying with each technique so you haven't forgotten anything.\nYou can test for simple \"lua-compatibility\" (that is, no missing paranthesis, end:s and so on) by saving the macro to a file then using the lua compiler on the file. The compilers can be found at this nice wiki page: &lt;a href=\"http%3A//lua-users.org/wiki/LuaBinaries\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\nBasic techniques.\nThese techniques are made for two purposes:\nNote that there often are ways to make something in a different way, which may turn out to use less characters than the current way of doing this. This often requires Lua and WoW API knowledge, though, and as such is beyond the scope of this HOWTO.\nSlash commands.\n/run and /script are the same command, so use /run instead of /script. Duh. :)\nOnly 3 bytes saved here, but since it's 3 bytes in every scripted macro...\nMacros are read by the computer.\nBecause macros should - in the end - only be read by the computer, you can leave out a lot.\nFirst up is the semi-colon, ;. It can be \"completely\" left out. However, you should leave a space between most \"words\".\nSecond to the executions is the &lt;ENTER&gt; (newline) character. Yes, each new line takes up valuable space. \nWrite it all in one big line. The Computer does not care if it looks like crap (you will, though).\nYou can remove spaces around operators, such as -, +, /, *, &gt;, &lt;, &gt;=, &lt;=, =, ~= and ==. while a == b may look prettier than a==b, they both work the same way. While it may not be obvious at first, parentheses, quotes, etc. are also technically operators. For example:\n /run CastSpellByName(\"Charge\") SpellStopCasting() CastShapeshiftForm(3)\ncan be shortened to (among other optimizations):\n /run CastSpellByName(\"Charge\")SpellStopCasting()CastShapeshiftForm(3)\nSeveral /script commands in one macro.\nJust put it all in one big line. Do it for the Widow's Son. Once again, the amount of readability will decrease, but you'll shave off some characters.\nMake it small, not good-looking.\nDo not use paranthesis in flow-control statements (if, for, while...) unless totally necessary.\nOnce again, it may look pretty:\n /script if ( qwerty == yuiop ) then asdf(); end\n... but it can be made to be small:\n /run if qwerty==yuiop then asdf()end\nSpells that always are cast.\nDo not use CastSpellByName for these ones.\nIf the spell is always cast, use /cast instead. Less bytes, and even easier to understand. :)\nPlus, it really is the same. No, really, it is!\n /script CastSpellByName(\"Volley\");\nbecomes\n /cast Volley\nIn fact, this is one of the few techniques that actually makes stuff smaller without it being less readable.\nAdvanced techniques.\nThese can be a bit harder to apply.\nDifferent conditionals causing the same result.\nIf you see that a macro does the same thing dependent on several conditions, you can bunch them together.\nBasically, this means that if you see:\n if A then X elseif B then X elseif C then X elseif D then Y end\nyou can compress it to the following form\n if A or B or C then X elseif D then Y end\nYou might also be able to use slightly different conditions to achieve the same result. For example a macro with 4 different commands based on modifier keys: \n /use [modifier:shift,modifier:alt]act4;[modifier:alt]act3;[modifier]act2;act1\nbecomes\n /use [nomodifier]act1;[nomodifier:alt]act2;[nomodifier:shift]act3;act4\nUsing shorter conditionals.\nYou can shorten following the conditionals since 2.3:\n modifier -&gt; mod, button -&gt; btn, actionbar -&gt; bar, equipped -&gt; worn , stance -&gt; form\nso the above becomes\n /use [nomod]act1;[nomod:alt]act2;[nomod:shift]act3;act4\nAnd the original was actually just 2 characters longer\n /use [mod:shift,mod:alt]act4;[mod:alt]act3;[mod]act2;act1\nItems.\nUse item IDs instead of Item names.\n /use Reins of the Veridian Netherwing Drake\nis a lot longer than\n /use item:32861\nMaking aliases.\nIf the macro uses a long name for something you can make an alias for it.\nFor instance check out this macro:\n /script if not UnitExists(\"pet\") then CastSpellByName(\"Revive Pet\"); else if UnitIsDead(\"pet\") then CastSpellByName(\"Revive Pet\");else CastSpellByName(\"Mend Pet\");end;end\nShrunk with this method alone:\n /script c=CastSpellByName if not UnitExists(\"pet\") then c(\"Revive Pet\"); else if UnitIsDead(\"pet\") then c(\"Revive Pet\");else c(\"Mend Pet\");end;end\nQuite a difference. We'll see how this macro can be shrunk even further.\nAnother example from my mage \"Eat,Drink and Be Mary\" macro\n /script if ( UnitHealthMax(\"player\") - UnitHealth(\"player\") &gt; 50 ) then UseContainerItem(0, 1); end if ( UnitManaMax(\"player\") - UnitMana(\"player\") &gt; 100 ) then UseContainerItem(0, 2); end\n /script p=\"player\" if ( UnitHealthMax(p) - UnitHealth(p) &gt; 50 ) then UseContainerItem(0, 1); end if ( UnitManaMax(p) - UnitMana(p) &gt; 100 ) then UseContainerItem(0, 2); end\nSubstituting and/or for if-then.\nIf you have an if-then expression where both branches do the same thing with slightly different values, consider getting rid of the if-then, and using a \"condition expression\" (known to C programmers as a \"ternary operator\"). This is based on the Lua idiom that\n a and b or c\nwill evaluate to \"b\", if \"a\" is anything but \"nil\" or \"false\". Otherwise, the expression will evaluate to \"c\". We can extend this to\n cond1 and val1 or cond2 and val2 or ... condN and valN or valLast\nFor instance check out this macro:\n /script if not UnitExists(\"pet\") then CastSpellByName(\"Revive Pet\"); else if UnitIsDead(\"pet\") then CastSpellByName(\"Revive Pet\");else CastSpellByName(\"Mend Pet\");end;end\nShrunk with this method alone:\n /script c=CastSpellByName if not UnitExists(\"pet\") then c(\"Revive Pet\"); else if UnitIsDead(\"pet\") then c(\"Revive Pet\");else c(\"Mend Pet\");end;end\nExamples.\nExamples of macros being shrunk down using the techniques above.\nHunter Macros.\nLet's look at a few examples (originally from the LazyFAQ / Hunter Macro thread):\nThis macro does the following : if your pet is dead, Revive Pet. Otherwise, if it's alive, Mend Pet.\n /script if not UnitExists(\"pet\") then CastSpellByName(\"Revive Pet\"); else if UnitIsDead(\"pet\") then CastSpellByName(\"Revive Pet\");else CastSpellByName(\"Mend Pet\");end;end\nShrunk version:\n /run CastSpellByName((not UnitExsists(\"pet\")or UnitIsDead(\"pet\"))and \"Revive Pet\" or \"Mend Pet\")\nFeed Pet macro - it checks if you're in combat or not. Then it looks for the item in Slot Y in Bag No. X and feeds your pet the food. If there's nothing there, the bag will open prompting for attention. Replace X = Your Bag slot, starting with \"0\", reads from Right to Left. Replace Y = Your Item Slot in your bag, starting with \"1\", reads from Left to Right, top to bottom row.\n /script if (not PlayerFrame.inCombat) then if (not GetContainerItemLink(X,Y)) then OpenBag(X); else CastSpellByName(\"Feed Pet\"); PickupContainerItem(X,Y); end end\nShrunk:\n /run if not UnitAffectingCombat(\"player\") then if not GetContainerItemLink(X,Y) then OpenBag(X) else CastSpellByName(\"Feed Pet\") PickupContainerItem(X,Y) end end\nNote that not PlayerFrame.inCombat is not a totally sure way of checking if you are in combat anymore. Use not UnitAffectingCombat(\"player\") instead.\nGeneric macros.\nFrom my mage \"Eat,Drink and Be Mary\" macro\n /script if ( UnitHealthMax(\"player\") - UnitHealth(\"player\") &gt; 50 ) then UseContainerItem(0, 1); end if ( UnitManaMax(\"player\") - UnitMana(\"player\") &gt; 100 ) then UseContainerItem(0, 2); end\nShrunk:\n /run p=\"player\" if UnitHealthMax(p)-UnitHealth(p)&gt;50 then UseContainerItem(0,1) end if UnitManaMax(p)-UnitMana(p)&gt;100 then UseContainerItem(0,2) end\nIn closing.\nThese techniques are meant to work as patterns for macros. Please add your own techniques to the list!\nRemember that, if you post macros, most people who use them will have the 255 character limit. Consider throwing in the original macro and adding the shrunk version.\nMost freely available macros can be shrunk. Note that there is no need to shrink a macro unless you want to expand on it and if you have the built-in limit of 255 characters. \nI personally find it a challenge to compress and shrink macros - but I'm a weird person. \n "}

It was created in 2005 by the guild \"Shroud\".\nThe grandfather of the point based loot systems is the &lt;a href=\"DKP\"&gt;DKP&lt;/a&gt; point system, created in 1999. Shroud Loot System is also a point based loot system, but one that attempts to correct what the creators perceived are flaws in the DKP system and its variants.\nThe goals of SLS.\nSLS has similar goals to all point systems, including DKP, as described in the previous sections. However, it has the following specific goals:\nSLS points are not points as much as they are a way of ranking each player's priority, i.e. their place in line to receive the next loot they desire.\nThe theory of SLS.\nEarning points.\nSLS awards points based solely on attendance, regardless of the amount of loot received. The purpose behind this method is to award players who participate in learning new content, when the loot to time ratios are very low by allowing them to build a base of points before players who begin participating only when the content has been mastered and the loot to time ratio is now high.\nEarning points on a time based format also allows for more tightly scheduled content, as one can easily award points only during a scheduled time. As loot systems such as SLS or DKP are generally only used when the number of players involved and the time required are both large, invariably some players will have strict time constraints due to outside forces. This allows those players to participate without being disadvantaged if they have to remove themselves before the of the content due to poor scheduling.\nSpending points for items.\nThere are only two ways to spend points on an item. A player can either spend 1/2 their current points or bid a low fixed cost (usually on the order of the points received for participating once in content). The player with the highest bid receives the item. If two players tie, which usually only happens when all players bid the low fixed cost, the item is given out by chance using a random number generator. \nThe main consequences of a bidding scheme such as this are:"}

Note that it has a two minute duration, so move quickly! Also be warned that \"Myzerian can see through the cloak\", so avoid him at all costs! Pets are not affected by the invisibility shield, and thus will draw aggro, so dismiss them before heading in.\nSummoning a mount will not break stealth until the cast completes, so it is possible to trigger a powder keg, summon a flying mount and fly away if need be without arousing an attack from the elite guards.\nAnother cutscene once all seven have been tampered with: The player is again running off back toward the oasis. The camera pans back to show the area surrounding the obelisk. All is peaceful as Myzerian circles the area, when suddenly, everything explodes! Myzerian looks like he's been killed.\nPlayers wind up in front of Harrison when the cutscene concludes."}

Naralex's dreams then became nightmares, which is the cause of so many deviate creatures appearing in the Wailing Caverns. However, he can't wake up Naralex and end his nightmare until the four Fanglords are defeated. Thus, he asks you to eliminate the four leaders of the corrupted &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s.

All hope is not lost!\nThe awakening ritual is quite complex, however. It cannot be done alone.\nI will handle all of the necessary preparations but I will need you to protect me. The nightmares summoned from Naralex's journey through the Emerald Dream prove to be quite formidable. Without your help, this mission is doomed.\nWhen you are ready to defend me, say the word, and I shall lead the way to Naralex's chamber.\nEscort tactics.\nIf you've dispatched all four Fanglords, be ready to head back to the entrance of the dungeon and tell the Disciple of Naralex that you're ready to awaken the sleeping Druid. You are now on an escort event. You will need to defend him against 2 &lt;a href=\"raptor\"&gt;raptor&lt;/a&gt;s at the first turn and against an onslaught of vipers once he reaches the circle of torches.\nHe will finally arrive at Naralex's chamber and will begin the ritual of awakening. This will take a long time so don't panic if you seem to be standing around with nothing happening. You will be facing the final gauntlet of the instance \u2014 so stay ready and make sure you have all buffs on and potion timers ready, because this is a tough fight if you're in your low 20's.\nYou will be facing several waves of incoming mobs trying to stop the ritual from being completed. The first wave consists of 3 level 20 elite &lt;a href=\"Deviate%20Moccasin\"&gt;Deviate Moccasin&lt;/a&gt;s. The second wave consists of many level 20 non-elite &lt;a href=\"Ooze\"&gt;slime&lt;/a&gt;s. The final wave is a gargantuan level 22 elite murloc named &lt;a href=\"Mutanus%20the%20Devourer\"&gt;Mutanus the Devourer&lt;/a&gt;. If you manage to defeat this &lt;a href=\"boss\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt;, Naralex awakens, all the monsters and Druids of the Fang in the Wailing Caverns disappear, Naralex and his tauren disciple transform into owls and fly away. &lt;a href=\"Mutanus%20the%20Devourer\"&gt;Mutanus the Devourer&lt;/a&gt; also drops the &lt;a href=\"Glowing%20Shard\"&gt;Glowing Shard&lt;/a&gt; that is, apparently, a reflection of the Emerald Dream.

Once you have them all, get ready to use them the moment you see the message appear \"Skadi the Ruthless is in range of the harpoon launchers!\" and use the launchers, starting from the left one to the right one, and back to the left one. The harpoon launchers having a few second cooldown, you will miss Skadi's mount if you do not use the launchers correctly.\nThis achievement can be done along with &lt;a href=\"Lodi%20Dodi%20We%20Loves%20the%20Skadi\"&gt;Lodi Dodi We Loves the Skadi&lt;/a&gt;: the key to do the two achievements at the same time, is that your group must already have the harpoons on them before the fight is initiated. Knowing that it can be reset by the group pulling back into the room that &lt;a href=\"Gortok%20Palehoof\"&gt;Gortok Palehoof&lt;/a&gt; is found in lets you keep your harpoons without dying or having to leave the instance and lose them.\nAfter 3 assigned members of the group have 2 harpoons each (only 5 are needed to kill Grauf), he is reset and the group can quickly run past to the harpoon guns before he respawns.

This actually makes it easier. Let some other player start the event and get thrown to the first boulder of the steps. Wait a few seconds, strike the gong, and get to the top via Terrath's throw. Try to stand on the boulders surrounded by a green aura, then pop trinkets and cooldowns.\nConsidering players must burn through roughly 300,000 health, and subtracting the time taken to get to the top, jumping between boulders, getting back to the ground, and turning in to Terrath, it will take roughly 5000 DPS on average for an individual player to pull this off by him- or herself. More players attacking Aeosera at the same time means that less damage is required per player.\nRemember that the 90 second time limit also includes getting back down to the ground and talking to Terrath to turn in, so move quickly! Players must be on the boulders with the clock running as Aeosera submits in order to be eligible when turning in."}

He called forth the wilds defenders to aid them with Mylune being one of them. She thought it was about the fuzzy little animals being in danger, but as soon as a creature of the nightmare appeared she knew something bad was happening.\nTo find &lt;a href=\"G%27Hanir%2C%20the%20Mother%20Tree\"&gt;G'Hanir, the Mother Tree&lt;/a&gt; and cleanse it from the nightmare, the druid adventurer asked the forest nymph surrounded by her animal friends for where to find it. Unfortunately, she was in a state of depression and the druid adventurer quickly told her that there was hope for Azeroth to find the artifact. Mylune now confident since G'Hanir is really counting on them, they started to work by finding the &lt;a href=\"Cup%20of%20Moonwater\"&gt;Cup of Moonwater&lt;/a&gt; and let it be blessed by &lt;a href=\"Leafbeard%20the%20Storied\"&gt;Leafbeard the Storied&lt;/a&gt;. Upon return, Mylune told her animal friends that the hero would fix this. As the druid adventurer started making their way to &lt;a href=\"Tel%27Andu%20Barrow%20Den\"&gt;Tel'Andu Barrow Den&lt;/a&gt; where &lt;a href=\"Naralex\"&gt;Naralex&lt;/a&gt; was waiting, Mylune told them to be careful because the Dream wasn't safe at this time.\nMylune alongside Naralex became the first champion under the Archdruid's banner. She came to the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dreamway\"&gt;Emerald Dreamway&lt;/a&gt; when the Nightmare invaded it, and the Archdruid used &lt;a href=\"Mylune%27s%20Flute\"&gt;Mylune's Flute&lt;/a&gt; to round up as many &lt;a href=\"Teensy%20Weensy%20Fae%20Dragon\"&gt;Teensy Weensy Fae Dragon&lt;/a&gt;s as they could from the Nightmare.. She was also one of the chosen companions in &lt;a href=\"Malorne%27s%20Nightmare\"&gt;Malorne's Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; sequence.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nClaiming to have heard \"the teeny tiny animals\", Mylune arrived at &lt;a href=\"Mechagon%20Island\"&gt;Mechagon Island&lt;/a&gt; to aid the creatures by having the adventurer use sap from &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt; to speed the land's recovery.

{"id": "21898", "revid": "42038977", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=21898", "title": "Mystery of the Makers", "text": "For &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s, the present has always mattered more than the past. They spend little time exploring their origins. As far as they are concerned, they have always been here. (Older races raise an eyebrow at this assertion, but even the elves must admit that human tribes were well established when the elves discovered them.)\nIn contrast, &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; have always been curious about their origins. Their oldest dwellings and relics contained hints at an origin myth, but only after their recent arrival upon &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; did the dwarves see the larger truth behind their fragmented legends. Based on scattered ruins they discovered in the wilds of Kalimdor, the dwarves were apparently created by a now-vanished race that ruled the world in ancient days.\nIncredible as this possibility is, it barely answers one mystery while giving rise to a host of questions. Who was this ancient race? Why were the dwarves created? What did these &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s intend for them to do and should they be doing it? What were their creators like, and what happened to them? When they disappeared, why were the dwarves left behind?\nStill, the dwarves' practical nature does not lend itself to blind worship of a progenitor race, regardless of how compelling the evidence may be. They rely upon measurements, mathematics, and the work of their hands. Rather than taking the measure of their creators on faith, the dwarves have embarked on a mammoth investigation of their past.\nThis evidence of titan progenitors has awakened a powerful excitement within the dwarves of Kalimdor. They rush out to explore the world around them, searching for clues as their time and resources allow. Any possible piece of evidence is studied, tested, and passed on to another dwarf for examination. The information piles up, the theories are tested and shared, and the base of knowledge grows.\nThe other races look upon the dwarves' efforts with everything from bemusement to treasure-seeking avarice to concern. Some are as curious as the dwarves themselves, while others worry that seeking hidden mysteries may awaken something primordial and dangerous.\nThe true origins of the dwarves.\nSomewhat unbeknown to the dwarves, the titans created the &lt;a href=\"earthen\"&gt;earthen&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 ancient ancestors to the dwarves \u2014 to help shape the world of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; after they were gone. When the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; imploded, causing the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, the earthen were deeply affected, feeling the pain of the earth as if it were their own. They retreated to their places of their origin \u2014 the titan cities of &lt;a href=\"Uldum\"&gt;Uldum&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Uldaman\"&gt;Uldaman&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 and hibernated for almost eight thousand years. When they awoke, they found that their powers over stone and earth had waned and their rocky hide had softened to smooth skin due to the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Flesh\"&gt;Curse of Flesh&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 they had become dwarves. Those who had awoken from Uldaman migrated to the snowy mountains of &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Morogh\"&gt;Dun Morogh&lt;/a&gt; and built the city of &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;. However, some of the earthen had \"devolved\" into &lt;a href=\"troggs\"&gt;troggs&lt;/a&gt;, due to interference from the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt;. Their strength was still in their grasp, but the same cannot be said about their intelligence."}

{"id": "492853", "revid": "39299307", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=492853", "title": "Grand Promenade (Suramar)", "text": "The Grand Promenade is a major thoroughfare located in the northwest of the &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt; capital city of &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt;. It is the main area of the upper and outer tier of &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar City&lt;/a&gt;, mainly to the west. Also on this tier is the &lt;a href=\"Lunastre%20Estate\"&gt;Lunastre Estate&lt;/a&gt; on the western end and the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Vineyards\"&gt;Twilight Vineyards&lt;/a&gt; making up most of the eastern section. Its statues, water gardens, ornamental plants, and ornate walkways make it one of the more elegant areas of Suramar City.\nThe Promenade is a mainly open space of winding paths and decorative gardens, though it also hosts a number of shops, houses, and secluded alcoves. Many areas of the city can be accessed from the Grand Promenade, including the &lt;a href=\"Menagerie%20%28Suramar%29\"&gt;Menagerie&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20Enlightenment\"&gt;Sanctum of Enlightenment&lt;/a&gt; to the east, the &lt;a href=\"Concourse%20of%20Destiny\"&gt;Concourse of Destiny&lt;/a&gt; and the city's lower levels to the southeast, and the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20Order\"&gt;Sanctum of Order&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lunastre%20Estate\"&gt;Lunastre Estate&lt;/a&gt; to the southwest. The Promenade is also connected to a road that leads out of the city and into the wider &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar region&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Promenade's central location at the edge of the city would ultimately make it a major first target for the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20%28faction%29\"&gt;rebels&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20rebellion\"&gt;Nightfallen rebellion&lt;/a&gt; when they and their &lt;a href=\"elven\"&gt;elven&lt;/a&gt; allies finally marched on the city proper. In the opening stages of the campaign, the Nightfallen successfully secured the Grand Promenade and much of the surrounding area before eventually pushing deeper into the city.\nHistory.\nThe Grande Promenade was located at the very edge of &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar City&lt;/a&gt; for the 10,000 years it remained isolated under its arcane shield following the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;. Though its role as a gateway to the city was made redundant at the time by the shield, it nonetheless represented a graceful and important area of Suramar. The area was heavily patrolled and administered by the &lt;a href=\"Duskwatch\"&gt;Duskwatch&lt;/a&gt;, the nightborne police force, with the upper sections of both the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20Order\"&gt;Sanctum of Order&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20Enlightenment\"&gt;Sanctum of Enlightenment&lt;/a&gt; (two of their major bases) opening onto the Promenade.\nThe Promenade was not seriously involved in the early events of the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20rebellion\"&gt;Nightfallen rebellion&lt;/a&gt;, nor relatively speaking by the arrival of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe master jeweler &lt;a href=\"Lespin%20Silverleaf\"&gt;Lespin Silverleaf&lt;/a&gt; operated his business from the far west of the Grand Promenade at this time, though he was soon replaced by his apprentice, &lt;a href=\"Apprentice%20Ardrias\"&gt;Apprentice Ardrias&lt;/a&gt;, when he perished during one of his schemes. The fruit merchant &lt;a href=\"Keelay%20Moongrow\"&gt;Keelay Moongrow&lt;/a&gt;, from his establishment near the central Promenade, also carried out numerous plots to discredit and sabotage rival sellers, often using underhanded means.\nThe &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Astoril\"&gt;Astoril&lt;/a&gt; was based from a residence on the Promenade near the entrance to the &lt;a href=\"Terrace%20of%20Order\"&gt;Terrace of Order&lt;/a&gt;. Under the guise of helping exiled nightborne to secretly reenter the city, he was, in fact, luring many of them to &lt;a href=\"Felsoul%20Hold\"&gt;Felsoul Hold&lt;/a&gt; in service to the Burning Legion. He was eventually slain in this enterprise by a member of &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20%28faction%29\"&gt;the Nightfallen&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Grand Promenade truly rose to prominence in the Nightfallen rebellion during its latter stages, when the combined armies of the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Nightfallen rebels&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; began their siege of &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar City&lt;/a&gt; to depose &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magistrix%20Elisande\"&gt;Grand Magistrix Elisande&lt;/a&gt; and expel the Burning Legion. Having established several camps outside the limits of the city and Grand Promenade, the insurgents next tried to seize control of the thoroughfare to eventually march on the &lt;a href=\"Nighthold\"&gt;Nighthold&lt;/a&gt; itself.\nGreat amounts of &lt;a href=\"Duskwatch\"&gt;Duskwatch&lt;/a&gt; defenders were brought up to the outer areas, and portals were opened by the Burning Legion to bring major reinforcements to the front. As the attackers' front line troops engaged the loyalist and &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic defenders, agents infiltrated the Promenade itself and began to undermine its formidable defenses. Through the efforts of &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20Moonshade\"&gt;Sentinel Moonshade&lt;/a&gt;, the crystals powering the Legion's portals were destroyed and the &lt;a href=\"eredar\"&gt;eredar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Overseer%20Ingra\"&gt;Overseer Ingra&lt;/a&gt; was slain, effectively cutting off any demonic reinforcements to the battle.\nAt the same time, &lt;a href=\"Magus%20Sendath\"&gt;Magus Sendath&lt;/a&gt; began to work against the defensive efforts of &lt;a href=\"Arcshaper%20Thorendis\"&gt;Arcshaper Thorendis&lt;/a&gt;. In charge of the Promenade's defenses, Thorendis created a large magical shield as well as portals to hold back the invaders' advance into the city. Having succeeded in bypassing the arcshaper's barrier, Magus Sendath and his allies managed to defeat him, thus removing another obstacle from the assault on the city.\nAs fighting continued to rage across the Grand Promenade and the rebels gained the upper hand, the Grand Magistrix's forces attempted a desperate measure in reactivating the &lt;a href=\"Arm%20of%20the%20Magistrix\"&gt;Arm of the Magistrix&lt;/a&gt;, the most powerful &lt;a href=\"Nightborne%20construct\"&gt;construct&lt;/a&gt; if its kind ever created. The insurgents, however, were successfully able to defeat the construct in the nearby &lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Thicket\"&gt;Crimson Thicket&lt;/a&gt;, and in so doing struck the final blow in the seizure of the Grand Promenade.\nIn the aftermath of the battle, the majority of the invading forces pushed on to the &lt;a href=\"Concourse%20of%20Destiny\"&gt;Concourse of Destiny&lt;/a&gt; and eventually the Nighthold itself, though troops were left behind to hold the central area of the Promenade from counterattack and keep the path through the city open."}

The demonic energies at his command have left him a husk who finds delight only in torturing young fel orcs to test the limits of their mental and physical strength.\"\nStrategy.\nWhen you approach Grand Warlock Nethekurse, he will have 4 non-elite &lt;a href=\"Fel%20Orc%20Convert\"&gt;Fel Orc Convert&lt;/a&gt;s standing in front of him. After the 4th of these are killed (the order does not matter), Nethekurse will attack the group. Nethekurse has some humorous quips to say while the party is killing the Fel Converts. If the group takes too long to kill the last of the four, Nethekurse will kill it himself and aggro the party.\nThroughout the fight, he will place down 'Void Zones' that will begin to do 1000 Shadow damage per second after 1 second of being placed. Moving out of these as soon as possible is advisable for everyone including the tank. You will get a second or two of warning that one of these zones is spawning when a translucent, circular red graphic appears around the player. The actual damage-dealing Void Zone appears as a purple vertical column, and will persist for a while. There may be a few of these active once the fight has begun.\nHe will also Death Coil random people which will do 2000 Shadow damage to the person hit, fear them for 4 seconds, and heal Nethekurse (presumably for 2000 HP).\nAt around 20% HP, Nethekurse will engage his 'Dark Spin' ability, in which he will begin to hit anyone directly around him for 2000 Physical damage and spit out Shadowbolts at random people in the group in rapid succession. The Shadowbolts hit for approximately 1500 Shadow Damage, and it is best to burn his remaining HP as quick as possible to limit deaths and a possible wipe. He will not move while enraged, so its best for the tank and any melee to back on out, and everyone can DPS from range, including the healer and tank if they can (warriors can use reflect if they can build enough rage). If a rogue is in the group, it is recommended that they save both the &lt;a href=\"Cloak%20of%20Shadows\"&gt;Cloak of Shadows&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Evasion\"&gt;Evasion&lt;/a&gt; abilities until he begins this attack, as it will allow them to continue meleeing the boss for a longer amount of time.\nSo long as everyone pays attention to the void zones, the boss is relatively easy. Prayer of Shadow Protection, or Shadow Protection aura helps a lot, as do good sets of Shadow Protection armor and potions.\nBugs.\nAt one point, it was possible to be Death Coiled through the walls and doors of Nethekurse's room where players were then stuck; this has since been fixed.\nHeroic Mode.\nHe does some extra damage on heroic, but not significantly more. The Void Zones are far more deadly, as expected, but the same one second rule applies to get out of them. Getting to his room is often more of a challenge than taking him down."}

When mind controlled, they have a &lt;a href=\"Widow%27s%20Embrace\"&gt;Widow's Embrace&lt;/a&gt; ability which when cast NEAR Faerlina can prevent Frenzy as well as silence Faerlina's nature school for 30 seconds. Using Widow's Embrace AFTER Faerlina Frenzies locks her nature school for 60 seconds. Using this ability actually kills the Worshipper.\nFollowers.\nThere are two ways of dealing with the &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas%20Follower\"&gt;Followers&lt;/a&gt;: off-tank them the entire fight or kill them first. If they are to be killed first, then they need to die quickly (around 30 seconds to bring both down). They do not hit particularly hard but will sometimes charge random people. In addition to that, they have an AoE silence, so try to have them tanked away from your caster classes. They are IMMUNE to silence.\n10-man abilities.\nGrand Widow Faerlina.\nShe has approximately 2,230,000 hit points.\nWorshippers.\nThere are 4 \"Naxxramas Worshipper\" NPCs at the start of the fight.\nWorshippers.\nThey will be off-tanked for most of the fight, and eventually sacrificed to Faerlina. When killed near Faerlina, they will remove and prevent Frenzy as well as silence Faerlina's nature school for 30 seconds. This fight cannot last more than 4:45 or so because there will be no way to prevent the Frenzy if all the adds are dead. It should be noted that in 10-man, the Worshippers are immune to Mind Control, and must be DPSed down. This can be tricky if your off-tank is overzealous and brings one in particular down too fast. Predetermine a kill order for the worshippers (raid marks work well), and bring one down to ~5%, then kill it once Faerlina enrages.\nStrategy.\n25-man.\nThree tanks are ideal. One tank will pick up the Worshippers and offtank them near the priests in the raid. One will pick up the followers which will be focused down by the DPS classes. The Followers CANNOT be sheeped (a difference from the 10-man). The main tank will pick up Faerlina and drag her to the middle of the room where everyone will spread out around her. When the frenzy is about to come off cooldown a priest will mind control one of the Worshippers and move it near Faerlina then use Widow's Embrace when frenzy is cast. Aside from healing her AoE damage this is the entire fight from 100% to 0%. The priest will need to be quick as she hits extremely hard while frenzied and may kill the tank if there is any delay.\n10-man.\nEasier than 25man. You will need two tanks. One tank will pick up the worshippers and offtank them right under the stairs on the left side. Any tank class is good at tanking them, as they don't deal high loads of damage. The main tank will pick up Faerlina after the OT pulls the rest and drag her to the middle of the room where everyone will spread out around her. Every DPS should focus ONLY in Faerlina, ignoring the four adds till the enrage phase is near.\nThe off-tank will pick all four adds, and start DPSing one of them: the one who must be killed in order to stop Faerlina's enrage.\nWhen the frenzy is about to come off cooldown (10 secs or so) every DPS should stop all DPS and switch target to the worshipper marked to kill. Do not start attacking it, just target it and be in range for attacks. The main tank should go where the OT is, the closer the better, taking Faerlina with him. The Offtank should have lowered the worshipper's health to 15% or less.\nWhen the enrage is up, all DPS should burst their CD to insta-kill the worshipper. If done properly Faerlina's enrage should fade, and MT can move Faerlina back to the center of the room, where DPS can resume on her.\nRinse &amp; Repeat every time the enrage timer is close.\nNOTE: Off-Tank should stop DPS worshippers at some time, because he/she will kill them all otherwise.\nNOTE: It is also possible to do the same start strategy but instead killing one Worshipper at a time to stop her enrage. (If gear is well suited) Downing all Worshippers and then focusing on Faerlina, even through her enrages can be done. (Good healer(s)and someone to dispel is needed for this way in this fight.)\nAchievements.\nThe raid can earn the achievement by killing Faerlina without dispelling any of the Frenzy phases.\nStrategy.\nIf your guild is lacking a shadow priest or you fancy getting your achievement, the following strategy will work for both 10 and 25 man raids.\nFirst of all the raid setup needs to have the usual 2 tanks, two shamans and 5-6 healers in the raid. Have both Shamans place cleansing totem down at the beginning of the fight, have 3-4 healers on your main tank. one healer on the raid *preferably a Druid* and one healer on the offtank.\nEngage the boss fight by having your offtank *preferably an aoe tank such as Paladin/DK* charge onto the pedestal and collect all the Worshippers and Faerlina. Have your main tank pick up Faerlina and tank her in one set position until rain of fire is cast on the main tank. Whilst the main tank gains aggro on Faerlina dps all the adds down using aoe. Once the adds are down, blow heroism pop your trinkets and full nuke Faerlina with 4-5 of your healers all concentrating on the main tank . This amount of healing can easily heal through the enrage and with the poison totems and a druid on raid healing. The achievement is yours! \nIf you have problems with your main tank dying due to the occasional slip up, the easy way around this is to reverse tank roles, have your main tank charge in and take all the adds whilst your offtank builds up aggro on the boss. Once the adds are down the main tank can then taunt Faerlina off the offtank. giving the offtank substantial threat in case the main tank dies.\nSolo Strategy.\nAt level 90, this achievement can be soloed by simply killing Faerlina without killing any of the adds. Before engaging Faerlina, unequip any cleave trinkets or legendary cloaks as these can easily one-shot the adds.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;\nExternal links.\n "}

If you sacrifice the Worshiper before the enrage, it will merely delay the enrage for 30 seconds.\"\nWorshipers and followers.\nThere are 6 NPCs at the start of the fight, 4 Worshipers and 2 Followers. \nWorshipers.\nThey will be off-tanked for most of the fight, and eventually sacrificed to Faerlina. When mind controlled, they can be used to remove and prevent Enrage as well as silence Fearlina's nature school for 30 seconds. Using this ability actually kills the Worshiper, so this fight cannot last more than 4:45 or so because there will be no way to prevent the Enrage if all the adds are dead.\nFollowers.\nThere are two ways of dealing with the Followers: off-tank them the entire fight or kill them first. If they are to be killed first, then they need to die quickly (around 30 seconds to bring both down). They do not hit particularly hard but will sometimes charge random people. In addition to that, they have an AOE silence, so try to have them tanked away from your caster classes.\nStrategies.\nThe Poison Volley hurts, but can be healed through and the DoT can be cleansed off fairly easily. A Greater NR pot when learning can help ease the learning curve.\nMelee can put quality Fire resistance gear on to lessen the damage of the Rain of Fire. Most importantly though, the MT and all melee need to pay attention to where it is being cast and run out of it as fast as possible. It is also very important to have ranged DPS and healers spread out throughout the room to avoid getting multiple hits with the Rain. Again, Greater FR pots will help the learning curve. \nOverall this is a very short and sweet fight. It shouldn't be lasting any more than 4 minutes, and as such, it is a DPS race to get her down before you run out of adds to silence her with.\nMake sure that your Paladins and Shaman Cleanse in this fight.Have all your healers at least cleanse themselves so the paladins/shaman can cleanse the DPS. Three Paladins/shaman cleansing is a solid number. Make sure your cleansers are wearing mana/5 and intellect gear instead of their +healing gear, as cleansing can drain quite a bit of your mana.\nFor newer guilds, this fight is very healing intensive as people might not get out of the rain of fire quick enough. Assigning 4 healers with the most +healing to cover 2 groups each with rank 5 renews and Rank 6 rejuvenate can be quite effective, as that spell is usually their quickest heal in terms of cast time, and is quite efficient. \nThat leaves 8 healers left, assuming a raid of 15 healers, two healers on the main tank, the other 6 healers on the followers/worshipers. Have your mind controlling priest heal a tank that is tanking a follower, so he can move into position for the MC once the two followers are dead. Have the other healer healing a follower tank also be a priest. Make sure that he watches over the mind control priest's health, as well as have him make sure the main tank is topped off just before the enrage. Have him become the backup MCer in case the mind control priest dies for any reason.\nIf your whole raid lives through the first sacrifice, this fight gets easier and easier. With each Worshiper sacrifice, more and more healers are freed up and your chances of keeping the raid as well as the main tank alive go up.\nLoot.\nYou receive 100 reputation with the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt; at all reputation levels."}

After surviving the explosion that destroyed most of Auchindoun, they remained there for many years. \nIn time, &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Teron%20Gorefiend\"&gt;Teron Gorefiend&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kilrogg%20Deadeye\"&gt;Kilrogg Deadeye&lt;/a&gt; fled to Auchindoun to take shelter from the pursuing &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; armies. They had been unaware of the presence of other orcs here, but Vorpil and Blackheart welcomed them. When presented with news of the betrayal of &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;, Vorpil pledged himself to Ner'zhul. When Danath broke into Auchindoun to rescue &lt;a href=\"Kurdran\"&gt;Kurdran&lt;/a&gt;, Vorpil and Blackheart fought to stop them, but were beset by ghosts of dead &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;. In the confusion, Danath slew Kilrogg Deadeye in single combat. Ner'zhul and Gorefiend teleported themselves to the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt;, and Vorpil and Blackheart fled back into the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Labyrinth\"&gt;Shadow Labyrinth&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nTill this day they remain there, tempering with cosmic forces such as &lt;a href=\"Murmur\"&gt;Murmur&lt;/a&gt;. Their followers form what is known as the &lt;a href=\"Cabal\"&gt;Cabal&lt;/a&gt;. By his name, it is guessed that he is the Grandmaster of the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Labyrinth\"&gt;Shadow Labyrinth&lt;/a&gt;.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"In the early days of the Horde, Grandmaster Vorpil convinced the orc warlock Gul'dan to allow him to investigate the mysteries of Auchindoun, secretly desiring to harness the energy of the frighteningly powerful cosmic essences that permeated the area.\"\nBattle progression.\nThe fight starts as soon as one of the players moves close enough to Vorpil to aggro him. The entire room will aggro so the room must be cleared before engaging. Vorpil will immediately open the Void Rifts around him, and Voidwalkers will start spawning, at an increasingly faster rate as the battle progresses. Vorpil will engage his aggro target in melee combat, always attempting to stay in melee range. After some time has progressed, Vorpil will cast Draw Shadows teleporting the party and himself to the pedestal he started on, and immediately cast Rain of Fire. Usually following Rain of Fire Vorpil will also cast Shadow Bolt Volley, whereupon Vorpil will engage the player with the highest threat in melee combat again until the next Draw Shadows is cast. This continues until every member in the party is dead, or Vorpil is killed, at which point the Void Rifts close, and Voidwalkers disappear.\nStrategy.\nThe most common strategies for defeating Grandmaster Vorpil are to stem the flow of voidwalkers by killing them, to maneuver Vorpil around so that the voidwalkers never reach him in order to explode, or to burn him before they are numerous enough to cause a problem. Either way, the battle outcome will be dictated by how well the group manages these voidwalker spawns, as their spawn rate will soon cause the group to be overwhelmed, and the chain of exploding voidwalkers will quickly kill the party.\nKiting Tactics.\nSouth-North Voidwalker Kite.\nThis strategy utilizes the slowness of the voidwalkers to the max. During the fight, all DPS is focused on Grandmaster Vorpil at all times. The main tank, who must at all times hold aggro, will move down one of the hallways, forcing Vorpil to follow him. The voidwalkers will slowly funnel down the hallway, away from their spawn locations towards Vorpil.\nTypically the first kite is to the south, as there is more available kiting distance. It can be useful to station the group, other than the puller, about two thirds of the way to the south end of the room and immediately pull Vorpil to that location, just beyond the maximum distance the voidwalkers will reach before the teleport. This eliminates potential difficulties with maintaining targeting and damage during the kite. It also helps prevent voidwalker healing if the tank losses aggro, as Vorpil is less likely to be running into voidwalkers in that case.\nAt the time of the Teleport, everyone in the party exits the Rain of Fire to optionally kill any voidwalkers dangerously close to Vorpil, then head down the opposite hallway of the last kite. The main tank, who will remain the highest threat to Vorpil, will immediately head down the hallway in the opposite direction of the first kite. The time before the next teleport will give the voidwalkers enough time to funnel down the new hallway, and the process is repeated until Vorpil is dead.\nDuring the time of the Rain of Fire, and before the tank is on top of Vorpil again, the party must take care not to take aggro from the main tank, and if that happens, they must be careful to kite Vorpil to the main tank again.\nAll-South (Metronome) Kite.\nThere are dangers to the strategy just described, although its principles are sound. Often, the group will become confused by which direction they are supposed to go, Line of Sight becomes an issue, and northward kites tend to place voidwalkers right on the teleport destination. Less organized groups with low DPS may prefer a method known as The Metronome.\nIn it, Vorpil is always directed south - but towards the walls of his room, in an alternating west-east pattern.\n1. Beginning with the southwest position, the tank must pull Vorpil onto the nearest skeleton mound and establish solid aggro. As the voidwalkers near, draw Vorpil further south, onto the next skeleton mound. Once there, take him west against the wall, allowing for the best Line of Sight to the pursuing party members, and hold him there until the teleport occurs.\n2. After the teleport, run up the mound to the east, even into the niche in the wall, to make Vorpil's approach angle as extreme as possible. When he has passed the pack of voidwalkers, exit the niche, continue south, and then head for the east wall.\nRepeat 1 &amp; 2 until Vorpil dies. Absolutely no voidwalkers need to be killed using this method, though it does get scary after the fourth teleport.\nThis method can be made even easier with a &lt;a href=\"Misdirection\"&gt;Misdirection&lt;/a&gt; pull, and with &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Nova\"&gt;Frost Nova&lt;/a&gt; on the pack of voidwalkers after each teleport.\n\"Note: Make sure to clear all skeletons from the mounds immediately prior to pulling him. There are a few spawns far up on top that do not pull with the lower-down ones.\"\nCombination Strategy (Heroic Mode).\nIf you are having trouble killing him on heroic mode, try this strategy. Assign one person to kill as many of the voidwalkers around the platform as possible, while the other four party members do the north-south kiting described above. This way, you will have less healing and explosions during a teleport. Frost nova, slowing trap, etc. also helps during teleports, especially later in the fight when there are more of them.\nNon-Kiting Tactics (Require High DPS).\nWhen the fight starts, the party will be given some lead time before the Voidwalkers approach Vorpil, since they move so slow. If the party can muster enough damage output before the first and second teleports, it is possible to wear Vorpil down before Voidwalkers are so many they become a problem.\nMound Fight (Involves Killing Voidwalkers).\nThis strategy offers a much less chaotic fight, and you can easily have him dead after the first summon.\nPull Vorpil to the right mound next to his dais. Assign the lowest direct damage DPS to kill voidwalkers as they move up the hill. Shadow Priests are great to use, as they will be in constant Spirit Tap while nuking the voidwalkers, and can place DoTs on Vorpil. Placing Vorpil on the mound for the fight funnels all his void walkers into a few paths and makes killing them much easier. It also makes this fight much easier for even average tanks to maintain aggro.\nFor shamans, totems should be placed at the top of the mound at the start of the fight. Bloodlust can be popped once Vorpil is on the top of the mound if he's been walked to the top by the tank. \nVorpil's first summon occurs around the 40 second mark, so you can easily be ready for it. Jump off the dais, all DPS moves to the mound and have the tank waiting below to walk him back to the top of the mound. Repeat until dead.\nLedge/Pillar Fight.\nBefore the fight, all members of the party move to the western ledge of the platform as you face him; if the party hugs the wall, they can all move into position without aggroing him. The tank pulls Vorpil to this ledge, and the party members pour on the damage until he is dead. With a decently high DPS group, it is possible to bring him down to under 20% before the first teleport.\nAfter the 'port, the party returns to their spot on the ledge, and continues the fight after the tank regains aggro.\nIf the DPS isn't high enough to take him down before the voidwalkers become a problem, the party can move the fight behind the column in the northwest, making it more difficult for the voidwalkers to get to him do line of sight.\nCrazy DPS Strategy.\nIf you have a druid tank, you can also have him switch to his DPS gear, and have all four DPSers go all out on him straight-away. He hits for very little, so any decent healer can heal a clothie with aggro. Just be sure to keep standing still if you have aggro, so as to allow the melee to be in range. A variation on this strategy is to have the healer doing damage as well; a well-geared shadowpriest will be able to do a substantial amount of damage while also keeping the party up.\nQuotes.\nBeyond the Dark Portal.\n\u201cTeron Gorefiend?

This means that it's possible to level two characters up to 85 in this manner (thus earning a total of 84 grantable levels) and thus allow the veteran player to create a new character from level 1 and have the two recruited characters grant him levels all the way up to 85.\nAlso, because granting a character levels does not affect their progress through their current level, you can use this tactic to bring a brand new character straight to level 86. This is because a character that is at 99% experience in level 1 will be at 99% at any level they obtain through granted levels."}

While originally from Azeroth, it was carried through the dark portal by the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, whether by accident or on purpose, 20 years prior to the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;. This explains the fact that the herb is only found in the first two zones, the areas with the highest concentration of Horde, Alliance, and &lt;a href=\"Cenarion\"&gt;Cenarion&lt;/a&gt; forces, who were most likely to carry this seed. This &lt;a href=\"herb\"&gt;herb&lt;/a&gt; is more than likely one of the more heartier breeds of Azerothian plants, as it appears to be the one of only a few able to survive in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;."}

But as the Cenarion Circle moved the bulk of its forces to the Dreamgrove only during the third invasion of the Burning Legion this may not be the case.\nIt is possible the Dreamweavers initially existed as a loose and isolated prototype of the Cenarion Circle, possibly as an offshoot of the Keepers and initially consisting of Cenarius-tutored druids from &lt;a href=\"Val%27sharah\"&gt;Val'sharah&lt;/a&gt;, but later expanded to combine their ranks with that of Kalimdor's &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; after it was founded by &lt;a href=\"Malfurion\"&gt;Malfurion&lt;/a&gt;, due to their largely overlapping responsibilities and spheres of influence. Again, although Malfurion appears to know most of the major druids in the Dreamweavers and apparently even mentored some of them, the extent of direct contact between the night elves of Kalimdor and those of the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt; during the Long Vigil remains largely unclear."}

They keep attempting to rebuild Revendreth's dilapidated infrastructures and constructions, but it is a losing battle considering the &lt;a href=\"anima\"&gt;anima&lt;/a&gt; drought. The ideal dredger is absolutely subservient and works \"out of sight, out of mind\". It is considered distasteful for dredgers to seek appreciation for their work.\nDespite often having no choice in who they serve, dredgers have their own independent thoughts and opinions. If treated badly they will dislike and resent the offender, even if they cannot physically act against it. They refer to &lt;a href=\"venthyr\"&gt;venthyr&lt;/a&gt; as 'fangs', but not those of whom they're friendly with. &lt;a href=\"Nadjia%20the%20Mistblade\"&gt;Nadjia the Mistblade&lt;/a&gt; is a notable venthyr that befriended dredgers alongside &lt;a href=\"stonebound\"&gt;stonebound&lt;/a&gt;, leading some to state that a friend of hers is a friend to them as well. All in all, dredgers are often not respected, but when given respect will gladly return it in kind.\nThey can be reshaped into &lt;a href=\"biggun\"&gt;biggun&lt;/a&gt;s that are created from multiple dredgers using a &lt;a href=\"Gem%20of%20Binding\"&gt;Gem of Binding&lt;/a&gt;.\nAll dredgers are made from muck pools using filth and fiber through an alchemic process, which are found in the &lt;a href=\"Dredgewood\"&gt;Dredgewood&lt;/a&gt; and . It seems the &lt;a href=\"Blistering%20Bog\"&gt;Blistering Bog&lt;/a&gt; was once a muck pool.
