When his energy reaches 0, he moves to the center of the room and begins to channel Blessing of the Sun. This spell recharges his energy to full over 20 seconds, while dealing damage to the party and increasing damage to Rajh by 100%. As such, cooldowns should be saved for this phase, and heroism should be used such that the last 20 seconds coincides with this spell (perhaps used when Rajh is at 20 or 40 energy).\nRajh has a number of special abilities which he uses at random. All of them consume energy, but some are instant while others have a cast time. The latter should always be interrupted, as this will prevent the consumption of energy and buy time for the party to kill him. Summon Sun Orb has a long cast and is easy to interrupt, though Inferno Leap has a short cast and requires better reflexes.\nUnless the party has very high DPS, the random selection of abilities adds a measure of luck to this achievement, as the time available in each attempt varies. If this is the case, it may be desirable to intentionally wipe unless a certain number of spells (e.g. 3) are interrupted prior to Blessing of the Sun."}

The army consisted mostly of &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;, but also included some &lt;a href=\"fel%20orc\"&gt;fel orc&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s making their numbers into thousands. Some pilgrims from &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; also voluntarily joined their group. The bulk of their army had been established both in the &lt;a href=\"Netherstorm\"&gt;Netherstorm&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Valley\"&gt;Shadowmoon Valley&lt;/a&gt;, while several of their members left the main contingent to follow other pursuits; mainly, the &lt;a href=\"Scryers\"&gt;Scryers&lt;/a&gt; and the blood elven forces loyal to &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlthough Kael'thas was supposedly allied with Illidan, in truth he had joined the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the enemies of Illidan, because of his hunger for &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;. According to various discussions between &lt;a href=\"Dawnblade%20Blood%20Knight%23Quotes\"&gt;Dawnblade agents&lt;/a&gt; however, it seems that the rank and file soldiers were not really loyal to the Legion and its goals, being more interested into saving the sin'dorei from the addiction that bound them or monetary matters, believing themselves the true masters of the demons.\nIn the waning moments of Prince Kael'thas' ill-fated assault on the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell%20Plateau\"&gt;Sunwell Plateau&lt;/a&gt;, the prince recalled his loyal servitors on &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; to his side at &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt;. Though some remnants of his army would heed this call, and become known as the &lt;a href=\"Dawnblade%20%28blood%20elves%29\"&gt;Dawnblade&lt;/a&gt;, others did not: a number of the Sunfury forces broke away from the prince's increasingly damning path, and instead reaffirmed their loyalty to their homeland of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; and its acting regent, &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;. Though little is known of the organization's current status, their presence has ensured the &lt;a href=\"Farstriders\"&gt;Farstriders&lt;/a&gt; to become less strained with protecting the nation's borders.\nHistory.\nFormation of the army.\nPrince Kael'thas led a group of his healthiest fighters to join the battlefront, where they hoped to fight the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; alongside &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20resistance\"&gt;resistance forces&lt;/a&gt; in the aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, but his commander, , despised elves. Despite this, the blood elves proved themselves and seized large swaths of land in &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt; and worked their way to the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;. While there, the elves tried to draw on city's convergence of ley lines, but they could not gather enough power to satisfy their cravings.\nLater, Garithos put him in an almost impossible mission which forced Kael'thas to get help from &lt;a href=\"Illidan%27s%20Naga\"&gt;Illidan's Naga&lt;/a&gt;. This act, however, was considered as treason, and Kael'thas was sentenced to death. With no other choice he joined &lt;a href=\"Illidan%27s%20forces\"&gt;Illidan's forces&lt;/a&gt; and went to &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; to find his master.\nServitude to &lt;a href=\"Illidan%27s%20forces\"&gt;Illidan's forces&lt;/a&gt;.\nAround 15% of the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; followed him, there the combined forces of blood elves and &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; defeated the &lt;a href=\"Watchers\"&gt;Watchers&lt;/a&gt;, led by . After defeating the night elves Illidan was reunited with his forces and prepared to defeat , the Lord of Outland, after some battles, Illidan's forces defeated Magtheridon but appeared and ordered Illidan to destroy the . Kael'thas was optimistic that they would destroy the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt;. Kael'thas' forces established across &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; and were in war against the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, then one day arrived and destroyed a settlement, after the battle Kael and Arthas had a discussion, where Kael'thas was confident that the vast armies of Illidan would destroy the Scourge once and for all. Arthas, with the help of , managed to emerge in &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt; after taking a shortcut and confronted to , , and their armies. However Arthas defeated Illidan in single combat and Kael'thas was forced to leave. felt that Illidan's agenda was shortsighted and made a new alliance with his previous enemy, the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nActivities in Outland.\n&lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; serving as the strategic battlefront in the ongoing &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; recently used &lt;a href=\"Tempest%20Keep\"&gt;Tempest Keep&lt;/a&gt; to reach the shattered land. However, when the naaru set out from their stronghold, Kael'thas and his blood elves quickly raided the dimensional fortress and assumed control over its satellite structures. Though Kael'thas and his minions maintain a tight hold on the keep, a band of &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt;, hijacked one of its satellite structures, the &lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt;, and used it to escape Outland, but the blood elves managed to sabotage the Exodar, and, while it managed to reach &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, it crashed. A group of Sunfury agents called the &lt;a href=\"Sunhawk\"&gt;Sunhawk&lt;/a&gt;s followed the draenei to Azeroth to reclaim the Exodar and seemed to want to turn the draenei into &lt;a href=\"man%27ari%20eredar\"&gt;man'ari eredar&lt;/a&gt;. They have since been disbanded by adventurers sent by the &lt;a href=\"Hand%20of%20Argus\"&gt;Hand of Argus&lt;/a&gt;.\nKirin'Var Village.\n&lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas\"&gt;Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt; wasn't part of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; anymore, and found out that they held a settlement called &lt;a href=\"Kirin%27Var%20Village\"&gt;Kirin'Var Village&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Netherstorm\"&gt;Netherstorm&lt;/a&gt;. One night he attacked the village, it began with an explosion of a &lt;a href=\"mana%20bomb\"&gt;mana bomb&lt;/a&gt; in the officer quarters at the northwest of the village. Thousands of blood elves attacked, even bringing &lt;a href=\"Dimensional%20Ship\"&gt;Dimensional Ship&lt;/a&gt;s with them, and &lt;a href=\"Archmage\"&gt;Archmage&lt;/a&gt; casted a protective ward on the tower.\n led the attack as commander of the Sunfury blood elves and fought in the front lines, killing many Kirin Tor mages although the overall army was led by himself. During the attack looted the &lt;a href=\"Heliotrope%20Oculus\"&gt;Heliotrope Oculus&lt;/a&gt;, claimed &lt;a href=\"Glacius\"&gt;Glacius&lt;/a&gt; as his trophy, betrayed the Kirin Tor and handed the blood elves the secrets of the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Tower\"&gt;Violet Tower&lt;/a&gt;'s defenses that Vargoth had casted before, leading Kirin'var to defeat.\nKael'thas' forces murdered all of the village inhabitants with the exception of , which was imprisoned in the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Tower\"&gt;Violet Tower&lt;/a&gt; by Kael'thas, and &lt;a href=\"Ravandwyr\"&gt;Ravandwyr&lt;/a&gt;, who fled with the &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Vargoth%27s%20Staff\"&gt;Archmage Vargoth's Staff&lt;/a&gt; in hope to rescue his master later. Vargoth was sealed with a magic that forbids passage to anyone of the Kirin Tor, but also Kael'thas took the &lt;a href=\"Sigil%20of%20Krasus\"&gt;Sigil of Krasus&lt;/a&gt; from him and gave it to , finally he left &lt;a href=\"Ar%27kelos\"&gt;Ar'kelos&lt;/a&gt; as a guardian to guard Vargoth's prison. After the destruction of the village the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; withdrew to &lt;a href=\"Sunfury%20Hold\"&gt;Sunfury Hold&lt;/a&gt;, where some Sunfury were left stationed, including . After that, &lt;a href=\"mana%20surge\"&gt;mana surge&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"arcane%20wraith\"&gt;arcane wraith&lt;/a&gt;s started to appear because the mana bomb had caused a rift in the nether.\nScryers and the Azerothian blood elves' betrayal.\nOne day Kael'thas sent out a regiment of blood elves, led by to destroy &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt;. When the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; prepared to defend the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; from the invaders, the blood elves dropped their weapons and pledged allegiance to the &lt;a href=\"Sha%27tar\"&gt;Sha'tar&lt;/a&gt;. That day Kael'thas forces suffered the most losses from ever before; many of the best and brightest amongst Kael's scholars and &lt;a href=\"magisters\"&gt;magisters&lt;/a&gt; were convinced by Voren'thal to join the naaru. They called themselves the &lt;a href=\"Scryers\"&gt;Scryers&lt;/a&gt; and became an enemy of Kael'thas' forces.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; was reopened and the forces of the Alliance and Horde began pouring into Outland, Kael'thas and his followers originally accepted the new blood elven pilgrims coming from Azeroth. However, these new arrivals were given menial tasks and treated little better than slaves, until Voren'thal's &lt;a href=\"Scryers\"&gt;Scryers&lt;/a&gt; discovered that Kael'thas had entered into an alliance with the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; through the revelations of Sunfury deserters. Despite this revelation some other elves still decided to join their prince, prompting a recruitment war between Kael's forces and the Scryers. Eventually the majority of blood elves assisted the Alliance and Horde in fighting the Sunfury.\nExperiments.\nKael'thas was conducting several experiments across &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. One of them was creating and dropping red crystals that summon &lt;a href=\"colossi\"&gt;colossi&lt;/a&gt; and drive them mad. After that experiment failed because of the intervention of the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Expedition\"&gt;Cenarion Expedition&lt;/a&gt;, he used an artifact created at the &lt;a href=\"project%20at%20Firewing%20Point\"&gt;project at Firewing Point&lt;/a&gt; to destroy the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Thicket\"&gt;Cenarion Thicket&lt;/a&gt; as an act of vengeance\u2014the &lt;a href=\"mana%20bomb\"&gt;mana bomb&lt;/a&gt;. He used the &lt;a href=\"Bonechewer%20clan\"&gt;Bonechewer clan&lt;/a&gt; as a distraction, but nevertheless, the project was destroyed by the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Bonechewer%20clan\"&gt;Bonechewer clan&lt;/a&gt; was defeated.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Netherstorm\"&gt;Netherstorm&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"manaforge\"&gt;manaforge&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; are threatening the region and may blow it up within a few months, probably taking much of Outland with the explosion.\nKael's magisters also experimented on &lt;a href=\"mana%20crystal\"&gt;mana crystal&lt;/a&gt;s, combined with &lt;a href=\"Bloodgem%20Shard\"&gt;Bloodgem Shard&lt;/a&gt;s, greatly increasing their potency at the cost of augmenting the user's innate addiction to magic. Many, if not all of Kael's followers were using this method; believes that Kael's forces are too drunk on it to question him.\nManaforges.\nDiscovery.\nThe Sunfury army holds control over four &lt;a href=\"manaforge\"&gt;manaforge&lt;/a&gt;s. The &lt;a href=\"Scryers\"&gt;Scryers&lt;/a&gt; were sent to investigate them and the &lt;a href=\"Aldor\"&gt;Aldor&lt;/a&gt; went as well as they couldn't ignore the threat that they present. They were sent by &lt;a href=\"High%20Priestess%20Ishanah\"&gt;High Priestess Ishanah&lt;/a&gt;. The manaforges threatened the region with blowing up within a few months, probably taking much of Outland with the explosion.\n, leader of a &lt;a href=\"ballista\"&gt;ballista&lt;/a&gt; team outside of &lt;a href=\"Manaforge%20B%27naar\"&gt;Manaforge B'naar&lt;/a&gt;, held the . The Aldor defeated their &lt;a href=\"Sunfury%20Magister\"&gt;magisters&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sunfury%20Bloodwarder\"&gt;bloodwarders&lt;/a&gt; while the Scryers kill Arathyn and managed to obtain it. With this information, the Scryer began to assassinate Sunfury blood elves, but not any blood elf that could be easily replaced. They targeted the brains of the operation: the &lt;a href=\"Sunfury%20Warp-Engineer\"&gt;Sunfury Warp-Engineer&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Sunfury%20Warp-Master\"&gt;Sunfury Warp-Master&lt;/a&gt; who oversaw the retrieval of a so-called \"warp-energy\" by the manaforge and its delivery to a remote destination via a system of underground pipes and the &lt;a href=\"Sunfury%20Geologist\"&gt;Sunfury Geologist&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile the &lt;a href=\"Aldor\"&gt;Aldor&lt;/a&gt; went to investigate if the manaforges were made with &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; technology. They discovered that it was a modified technology of &lt;a href=\"Tempest%20Keep\"&gt;Tempest Keep&lt;/a&gt;, and that the warp were highly dangerous as the naaru technology wasn't supposed to be used so close to the land. However, as most naaru constructs, the manaforges had a safeguard that allows them to be permanently disabled in case of emergency. This information was shared with the Scryer.\nDestruction.\nManaforge B'naar.\nManaforge B'naar was protected by blood elves and even , with in possession of one &lt;a href=\"B%27naar%20Access%20Crystal\"&gt;access crystal&lt;/a&gt; used to deactivate Manaforge B'naar. Both Aldor and Scryer went and killed Theredis and shut it down.\nManaforge Coruu.\n was the leader of &lt;a href=\"Manaforge%20Coruu\"&gt;Manaforge Coruu&lt;/a&gt;, but held control over the &lt;a href=\"Coruu%20Access%20Crystal\"&gt;access crystal&lt;/a&gt;.\nBy this time &lt;a href=\"Manaforge%20Duro\"&gt;Manaforge Duro&lt;/a&gt; went under heavy attack by &lt;a href=\"arcane%20wraith\"&gt;arcane wraith&lt;/a&gt;s, the same mana creatures they lured with their &lt;a href=\"mana%20bomb\"&gt;mana bomb&lt;/a&gt;, because they wanted the harvested energy and the situation went out of control. and took many troops from &lt;a href=\"Manaforge%20Coruu\"&gt;Manaforge Coruu&lt;/a&gt;, even when it had very few blood elves to defend themselves, to go and defend Duro. &lt;a href=\"Caledis%20Brightdawn\"&gt;Caledis Brightdawn&lt;/a&gt; managed to infiltrate &lt;a href=\"Manaforge%20Coruu\"&gt;Manaforge Coruu&lt;/a&gt;, and the Scryers managed to overhear the information of Manaforge Duro, and gave that information to the Aldor.\nThe blood elves activities in Coruu sent waves of &lt;a href=\"mana%20surge\"&gt;mana elementals&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Kirin%27Var%20Village\"&gt;Kirin'Var Village&lt;/a&gt;. Although adventurers helped the ghosts of Kirin'Var, more waves continued to appear. These creatures were also attacking the Sunfury blood elves, so they began to develop techniques to destroy them.\nFinally, Kirin'Var was saved as they activated a shield with the Sunfury's stolen technology and destroyed the new mana creatures who tried to enter the village.\nThen the attack commenced against the Manaforge Coruu: The Aldor attacked the &lt;a href=\"Sunfury%20Arcanist\"&gt;arcanists&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sunfury%20Researcher\"&gt;researchers&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile other Aldor and Scryer adventurers used the distraction of the Sunfury caused by the mana creatures and managed to destroyed the manaforge, killing &lt;a href=\"Overseer%20Seylanna\"&gt;Overseer Seylanna&lt;/a&gt; alongside . During the battle it was discovered that the Sunfury had received outside assistance to understand the naaru technology.\nSunfury Hold.\nAt that time, other adventurers sent by &lt;a href=\"Custodian%20Dieworth\"&gt;Custodian Dieworth&lt;/a&gt; attacked &lt;a href=\"Sunfury%20Hold\"&gt;Sunfury Hold&lt;/a&gt;, where they killed their &lt;a href=\"Sunfury%20Archer\"&gt;archers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sunfury%20Flamekeeper\"&gt;flamekeepers&lt;/a&gt;, their leader &lt;a href=\"Master%20Daellis%20Dawnstrike\"&gt;Master Daellis Dawnstrike&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spellreaver%20Marathelle\"&gt;Spellreaver Marathelle&lt;/a&gt;, and burned up their ballistae and tents.\nBetrayal of the Consortium.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Consortium\"&gt;Consortium&lt;/a&gt; gave the Sunfury blood elves a shipment of &lt;a href=\"Box%20of%20Surveying%20Equipment\"&gt;Box of Surveying Equipment&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Manaforge%20Duro\"&gt;Manaforge Duro&lt;/a&gt; but the blood elves refused to pay, but during the confusion of the attack of mana creatures adventurers sent by the ethereals managed to repossess the shipment. After these events, it was unofficially ended the dealings between both organizations.\nThey were also allied with with the &lt;a href=\"Zaxxis\"&gt;Zaxxis&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ethereal\"&gt;ethereal&lt;/a&gt;s, but the ethereals cut off relations with the Sunfury and went into business for themselves.\nSome time later, was sent by &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Nexus-Prince%20Haramad\"&gt;Nexus-Prince Haramad&lt;/a&gt; asking for &lt;a href=\"Spirit%27s%20Song\"&gt;Spirit's Song&lt;/a&gt;, but decided to give the crystal to the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; instead and end the dealings with the Sunfury. For these actions, Solannas and his guards attacked the ethereals but were killed by Haramad himself.\nManaforge Duro.\n&lt;a href=\"Spymaster%20Thalodien\"&gt;Spymaster Thalodien&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Anchorite%20Karja\"&gt;Anchorite Karja&lt;/a&gt; were worried because of the lost of control in &lt;a href=\"Manaforge%20Duro\"&gt;Manaforge Duro&lt;/a&gt;, as the explotion of the manaforge could threaten all of &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. The Scryers used the mana beasts' attack to Manaforge Duro and fought against the Sunfury at the same time, slaughering many blood elves. And then, both factions sent &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to deactivate the manaforge, they killed . During the battle was also killed at &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Vargoth\"&gt;Archmage Vargoth&lt;/a&gt;'s request. After this Archmage Vargoth obtained all the necesary items to release from his prison he just needed to defeat , an &lt;a href=\"arcane%20guardian\"&gt;arcane guardian&lt;/a&gt; left by &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas\"&gt;Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt;, with help from adventurers he managed to defeat the golem, but still needed a key held by a &lt;a href=\"Bloodwarder\"&gt;Bloodwarder&lt;/a&gt; commander. By destroying Manaforge Duro just one manaforge was left.\nDiscovery of the Burning Legion's alliance.\nManaforge Ara.\n&lt;a href=\"Manaforge%20Ara\"&gt;Manaforge Ara&lt;/a&gt; was the last manaforge active, it was overseen by , they recruited blood elves from &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; and reincorporated them into their ranks. betrayed the Sunfury and offered assistance to the Scryers, who sent adventurers to check if Theledorn wasn't a double agent, but the contrary happened, thanks to him they were able to obtain evidence of the alliance between Kael'thas' forces and the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. The Scryers shared the information with the Aldor, who sent ten troops to attack the Manaforge, but only one survived, the survivor was reinforced and managed to kill some &lt;a href=\"shivarra\"&gt;shivarra&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"mo%27arg\"&gt;mo'arg&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Nether-Stalker%20Oazul\"&gt;Nether-Stalker Oazul&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"ethereal\"&gt;ethereal&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"The%20Consortium\"&gt;The Consortium&lt;/a&gt;, went to attack the blood elves because they were destroying the land with the manaforges, targeting the &lt;a href=\"Sunfury%20Nethermancer\"&gt;nethermancers&lt;/a&gt;, who stabilize the flow of power.\nThe Sunfury had also a mine below Manaforge Ara, the &lt;a href=\"Trelleum%20Mine\"&gt;Trelleum Mine&lt;/a&gt;; since the destruction of &lt;a href=\"Manaforge%20Ultris\"&gt;Manaforge Ultris&lt;/a&gt;, that was attacked by mana creatures, this was their last source of materials to run the manaforges. As the &lt;a href=\"ethereal\"&gt;ethereal&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Consortium\"&gt;Consortium&lt;/a&gt; wanted to take the mine for themselves, they sent adventurers to defeat the &lt;a href=\"Foreman%20Sundown\"&gt;foreman&lt;/a&gt;, but when he was found he revealed that he had been demoted, and, in truth, held control over the mine and the foreman was no longer an enemy of the ethereals. The overmaster was defeated and the ethereals learned that the Sunfury were allied with the Burning Legion and that there were some blood elf defectors.\nMeanwhile, the Scryers didn't know about the alliance with the Legion thinking that the overseer of Manaforge Ara was a blood elf. They went to deactivate it but, when they proceeded, they found out that the overseer was, in truth, a &lt;a href=\"wrathguard\"&gt;wrathguard&lt;/a&gt; and that the Sunfury were working with the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, very bad news to the thousands of blood elves traveling from &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Even with the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s protecting the manaforge, both Aldor and Scryers managed to deactivate the last manaforge, saving &lt;a href=\"Netherstorm\"&gt;Netherstorm&lt;/a&gt; and all of &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; from a possible explosion.\nThe Scryers sent word from this alliance between &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas\"&gt;Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Voren%27thal%20the%20Seer\"&gt;Voren'thal the Seer&lt;/a&gt;.\nDownfall.\nThe adventurers from Azeroth, guided by the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt;, not only stopped the dark plans of Kael'thas' forces in Netherstorm but also launched a successful invasion of &lt;a href=\"Tempest%20Keep\"&gt;Tempest Keep&lt;/a&gt; which nearly killed their leader Prince Kael'thas Sunstrider.\nThough nearly destroyed in Outland, Kael'thas and what remained of his forces not only launched an invasion of &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt; and captured the naaru , but were able to begin the summoning of into Azeroth.\nHis army entered &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt; from the portals at the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Throne of Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;.\nDespite this victory, the proud heroes of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, with the aid of the &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Sun%20Offensive\"&gt;Shattered Sun Offensive&lt;/a&gt;, boldly challenged and defeated the last remnants of Kael'thas's forces, and finally killed the Sun King.\nReturn to Quel'Thalas.\nRegent Lord &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; mentioned that a number of the Sunfury had recently returned to &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, and that their input had ensured the &lt;a href=\"Farstriders\"&gt;Farstriders&lt;/a&gt; have become a little less strained with protecting Quel'Thalas' borders. Though their return was a surprise to some, it serves as a reminder that not all of the sin'dorei within Kael'thas' forces were willing to share in the prince's dark fate.\nSpeculation.\nThe group may have been named after &lt;a href=\"Sunfury%20Spire\"&gt;Sunfury Spire&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt;."}

He is found at two locations; &lt;a href=\"Farwatch%20Overlook\"&gt;Farwatch Overlook&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan%20Garrison\"&gt;Shado-Pan Garrison&lt;/a&gt;. He can assist you with &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan\"&gt;Shado-Pan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Daily%20Quests\"&gt;Daily Quests&lt;/a&gt; after completing the quest . With the &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen\"&gt;Thunder King's&lt;/a&gt; assault on Pandaria commencing, Nurong has joined &lt;a href=\"Taran%20Zhu\"&gt;Taran Zhu&lt;/a&gt; and the Shado-Pan at the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Isle of Thunder&lt;/a&gt;.\nNurong is the author of &lt;a href=\"Troubles%20From%20Without\"&gt;Troubles From Without&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nTrial of the Red Blossoms.\nPrior to the arrival of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, Shado-Pan scouts had spotted several &lt;a href=\"yaungol\"&gt;yaungol&lt;/a&gt; tribes moving east from the &lt;a href=\"Townlong%20Steppes\"&gt;Townlong Steppes&lt;/a&gt; in a manner more akin to escape than aggression. Taran Zhu as the leader of the Shado-Pan, sent Nurong along with several members of the order to deliver a message to the council of &lt;a href=\"Tillers\"&gt;Tillers&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20the%20Four%20Winds\"&gt;Valley of the Four Winds&lt;/a&gt;. This mission, however, had an accidental interlude as the missive they carried was stolen by a young thief named &lt;a href=\"Ten\"&gt;Ten&lt;/a&gt;. Though Nurong got the thief by the end of the chase, Ten had already deceived his experienced subordinates onto a false trail, and was impressed by the youth's speed and quick wit. He offered Ten an option to undertake the Trial of the Red Blossoms to join the Shado-Pan order in lieu of punishment.\nThree months later, after the mists had parted, the Trial of the Red Blossoms tested the initiates with a gauntlet of pain and rigor. Nurong as the master of Wu Kao Discipline, held the third part of the Trial: the Test of Spirit. Yet, some &lt;a href=\"mantid\"&gt;mantid&lt;/a&gt; assassins had secretly used the &lt;a href=\"sha\"&gt;sha&lt;/a&gt; energy to defy and corrupt the Shado-Pan's sacred tradition. Nurong tracked the assassins from their hidden den near the outskirts of &lt;a href=\"Firebough%20Nook\"&gt;Firebough Nook&lt;/a&gt; and tortured them to reveal their conspiracy. Though he learned little from them, he still removed all their limbs and eventually decapitated them.\nNurong returned to &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan%20Monastery\"&gt;Shado-Pan Monastery&lt;/a&gt; and declared that Ten, &lt;a href=\"Pei-Ling\"&gt;Pei-Ling&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Chan\"&gt;Heavy Chan&lt;/a&gt; could demonstrate their spirit if they would willingly take the oath to be Shado-Pan. He explained that the three young pandaren would be knowingly agreeing to face the sha again and again after having been marked for life, and would only feel increasing terror and fear with each new encounter: this is why only veterans are sent to face them. &lt;a href=\"Yalia%20Sagewhisper\"&gt;Yalia Sagewhisper&lt;/a&gt; of Omnia discipline disagreed, but she backed down with her face blank after Nurong warned her to not lecture him on his duties.\nAfter the three accepted, Nurong rested on a bench after his long journey back and realized that he had been pickpocketed by Ten out of habit. He called Ten over and asked for his belongings back, which the acolyte, smiling, did so with his apologizes.\nMists of Pandaria.\nLater, Nurong led a small elite force at &lt;a href=\"Farwatch%20Overlook\"&gt;Farwatch Overlook&lt;/a&gt; against the mantid force coming from &lt;a href=\"Dread%20Wastes\"&gt;Dread Wastes&lt;/a&gt;, while Taran Zhu was seeking a skillful member for his hunt party for the &lt;a href=\"Sha%20of%20Hatred\"&gt;Sha of Hatred&lt;/a&gt;. Nurong joined Taran and confronted the Sha in &lt;a href=\"Sik%27vess%20Lair\"&gt;Sik'vess Lair&lt;/a&gt;, putting it to rest after so much death it had wrought in its roam. He then moved with the other Shado-pan masters to &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan%20Garrison\"&gt;Shado-Pan Garrison&lt;/a&gt; to continue his duty against the mantid.\nThe Thunder King.\nWith the Thunder King's assault on Pandaria commencing, Nurong had joined the &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan%20Assault\"&gt;Shado-Pan Assault&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Isle of Thunder&lt;/a&gt;.\nTimeless Isle.\nNurong can be found on the Timeless Isle overlooking the Celestial Court with &lt;a href=\"Taoshi\"&gt;Taoshi&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nWhen a monk adventurer goes after &lt;a href=\"Sheilun%2C%20Staff%20of%20the%20Mists\"&gt;Sheilun, Staff of the Mists&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Terrace%20of%20Endless%20Spring\"&gt;Terrace of Endless Spring&lt;/a&gt;, Nurong is among the Shado-Pan who aid them in the battle against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nAbilities.\nHawkmaster Nurong has the following abilities when aiding you in &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan\"&gt;Shado-Pan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Daily%20Quests\"&gt;Daily Quests&lt;/a&gt;.\nNotes.\nWhile aiding you in &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan\"&gt;Shado-Pan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"daily%20quest\"&gt;daily quest&lt;/a&gt;s and when he is found at his second location at &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan%20Garrison\"&gt;Shado-Pan Garrison&lt;/a&gt;, Hawkmaster Nurong has 787,000 health rather than 393,000. When aiding you in Shado-Pan daily quests you can also hand in some Shado-Pan daily quests to him. His generic name is Wu Kao Hawkmaster.\nIt should be noted, however, that as a companion Hawkmaster Nurong has been universally panned by the player base for the strange style in which the AI uses in combat. Hawkmaster Nurong will always set down a &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Trap\"&gt;Ice Trap&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Explosive%20Trap\"&gt;Explosive Trap&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Snake%20Trap\"&gt;Snake Trap&lt;/a&gt; at a certain distance from the target, usually where it is the least useful and tends to be in the path of patrolling mobs. He also tends to liberally use &lt;a href=\"Disengage\"&gt;Disengage&lt;/a&gt; when in melee (which happens a lot), which usually ends with him flying into the aggro range of surrounding mobs. Some players have expressed that the only good thing about choosing Hawkmaster Nurong is watching him quickly getting himself killed."}

Wrath deals a large amount of nature damage and should be interrupted as often as possible, though it is possible to heal through if not interrupted. Periodically, Hazza'rah will stun four members of the group with Waking Nightmare and spawn four Nightmares that will move slowly towards those players. If they reach their targets, they will cast Consume Soul and the player will be instantly killed. Fortunately, they only have about 3000 health, and move very slowly, so it is relatively easy for the fifth player to kill them all before they cast Consume Soul.\nLoot.\nEach of the four bosses summoned drop two items: they drop one of their exclusive drops and one of their shared drops."}

This debuff is gained by being in melee range of the when it dies. In order to complete the achievement, the player must have three stacks of the debuff, requiring that it be cast by all three Servants prior to killing Siamat. The debuff remains on the player for 30 seconds, meaning that it must be refreshed or Siamat killed within 30 seconds of the previous cast. Each stack of the debuff increases damage taken by 33% and damage dealt by 10%, adding up to 100% increased damage taken and 30% damage dealt by the third stack.\nStrategy.\nDue to the increased damage taken by those with the Lightning Charge debuff, this achievement can be difficult. It can be made easier, but long, by pre-DPSing Siamat with the endurance method.\nEndurance Method.\nThis method is easy and very reliable, but it takes some time. It's helpful if the tank is overgeared, as there will be three Servants of Siamat attacking the tank for quite a while. Only one ordinary healer is required. At no time does the group take excessive damage; only the tank takes significant damage.\nSynopsis: Siamat will be DPS'd down to approximately 50k health, while the tank holds the Servants of Siamat, and someone kills the Minions of Siamat away from the group. Then everyone stacks on the tank and the Servants are killed in the order that they spawned. Siamat drops his shield and is killed immediately, granting everyone the achievement.\nDetail:\nWhen Siamat is at about 50k health, everyone will stack on the tank. The Servants will be killed in the order they were spawned, and should have been marked (skull, X, circle). It's advisable to allow each one to finish its two-second death cast before killing the next one.\nWhen the third Servant is killed, Siamat will drop his shield. He can be immediately killed and everyone gets their achievement.\nNote that depending on luck it may take Siamat several seconds to put his shield up at the beginning of the fight, so offensive cooldowns may be used here to get a short burst of damage. Due to the extreme length of the fight, heroism may usually be used twice, so it is acceptable to use it here (activate it before starting the fight).\nHealing Throughput Method.\nThe proper method of performing this achievement requires intensive healing due to the large damage increase from the debuff, and may be more than a single healer can handle. If this is the case, an off-healer e.g. a DPS shaman with healing rain can help some.\nThis method relies on killing the Servants one at a time, killing the next before the debuff from the previous expires; note that it takes several seconds for each to cast the debuff on death, so the party should kill each with at least 5 seconds left on the previous stack. The third Servant must be killed first, as that will cause Siamat's shield to drop so the party can do full damage, but the other two may then be killed in any order. After the shield falls and Siamat finishes throwing the party around, heroism and offensive cooldowns should be used to burn him down as quickly as possible, but don't forget to kill the other two Servants as necessary; defensive cooldowns may also prove useful to reduce the damage taken by the party.\nSolo Method.\nThis is a method for getting the achievement on your own, while part of a group (not for solo-killing the boss). This assumes that the other members of your group are unaware/uninterested in the achievement. It puts you at considerable risk of dying and makes more work for the healer.\nWhenever a Servant of Siamat spawns, go over to it. Be sure to stand on it when it dies, and remain there until you receive its debuff (there is still a two-second cast when it dies). After the third Servant dies, you will bounce around and take lots of damage; reserve any self-survival cooldowns for this time. You will then have less than 30 seconds to kill the boss, so pop all CDs and burn him. Using a potion will help.\nDo not use Ice Block or other debuff-clearing self-defense mechanisms, as they will prevent you from earning the achievement."}

Many headhunters are &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s, dexterous spearthrowers and experts at taking trophies on their fallen opponents. Through a combination of learning how to channel their rage and alchemical means, troll headhunters can become known as &lt;a href=\"Troll%20berserker\"&gt;berserkers&lt;/a&gt;.\nThird War.\nThough the Horde allied itself with the evil &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;forest troll&lt;/a&gt;s during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, the alliance was short lived due to the Horde\u2019s eventual defeat. But &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, on one of his many journeys, befriended a tribe of &lt;a href=\"jungle%20troll\"&gt;shadowy trolls&lt;/a&gt; from the steamy jungles of &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn&lt;/a&gt;. These cunning warriors are trained from birth to hunt, track and trap the most dangerous beasts in the wilds and possess the uncanny ability to regenerate lost health. In times of war, however, headhunters relish turning their mighty spears on the enemies of the Horde without hesitation. Capable of hurling their deadly spears at distant enemies, troll headhunters provide invaluable cover fire for the other warriors of the Horde. Like all trolls, headhunters can regenerate lost health over time. This racial ability makes the trolls fearsome opponents and often allows them to spring back into combat even though they\u2019ve suffered grievous wounds.\nOriginal description.\nThe disenfranchised trolls of northern &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; have once again pledged their savage services to the &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;ish &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. These cunning warriors are trained from birth to hunt, track and trap the most dangerous beasts in the wild. In times of war, however, troll headhunters turn their mighty spears upon the enemies of the Horde without hesitation. Capable of hurling their deadly spears at distant enemies, Troll Headhunters provide invaluable cover fire for the other warriors of the Horde.\nIn the RPG.\nThese trolls wear well-wrought dark brown chain shirts decorated with small black metal beads. Upon their backs is a large pack designed to carry many &lt;a href=\"spear\"&gt;spear&lt;/a&gt;s, and their points jut out over the creatures coarse, red mane. Trained from birth to track down and trap dangerous wild beasts, jungle trolls have long been renowned for their hunting and survival skills. The best among them are also cunning warriors able to fend for themselves against capable enemies. Troll headhunters excel at two things: Tracking down quarries and flinging spears at their foes. Because of these reasons, they are invaluable to the Horde. Their ability to hurl spears at distant enemies with deadly accuracy make the jungle troll headhunters among the best soldiers at providing cover fire to the other warriors of the Horde. Their superior tracking skills also make them tremendous scouting and reconnaissance experts as well as capable bounty hunters.\nLike most of their kind, troll headhunters excel at throwing things. They make good use of their natural talent, extensive training and hunting expertise when engaged in combat. During the first few rounds of battle, the jungle troll headhunters attack from afar - often targeting the same opponent with a volley of spears when working in groups. They continue to throw spears at their enemies until forced into melee (or until they only have one spear left).\nUnnamed.\nPresumed headhunters:"}

Additionally, &lt;a href=\"Shade%20of%20the%20Horseman\"&gt;his shade&lt;/a&gt; attacks &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; villages at various times throughout the event.\nThe Horseman was once a Knight of the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;, but is now cursed. He is of the belief that he is alive, while those who face him are dead. When defeated, he is revealed as Sir &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Thomson\"&gt;Thomas Thomson&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo spawn him, click on the Pumpkin Shrine. While the Horseman can be summoned, killed, and looted as usual in a &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt;, the instance limit is 5 people.\nWith the new &lt;a href=\"Dungeon%20Finder\"&gt;Dungeon Finder&lt;/a&gt;, you can now queue up and be teleported to the fight when a full group is assembled. Everyone gets a loot-filled pumpkin upon completion of the battle.\nThe Headless Horseman is voiced by &lt;a href=\"Carlos%20Larkin\"&gt;Carlos Larkin&lt;/a&gt;.\nStrategy.\nThe Headless Horseman encounter is a three phase fight.\nPhase one.\nThe Horseman makes his entrance and engages whoever lit the candle. The tank should &lt;a href=\"taunt\"&gt;taunt&lt;/a&gt; immediately if they did not start the event. Watch out for &lt;a href=\"Cleave\"&gt;Cleave&lt;/a&gt; and DPS him down.\nAt 1% the horseman will go immune, toss his head, walk around disoriented, and occasionally use a &lt;a href=\"Whirlwind\"&gt;Whirlwind&lt;/a&gt; attack. The Head of the Horseman will become an active target while the body heals to 100%. All DPS should have a target &lt;a href=\"macro\"&gt;macro&lt;/a&gt; for Head of the Horseman. After the party damages the head to about 60%, or the body heals to 100%, the head will rejoin the body and the next phase begins.\nPhase two.\nWhen the Horseman rejoins with his head, he targets the player with the highest threat. This is the same as phase one except he will randomly cast Conflagration on a random party member (not the tank). You can use a PvP Trinket to remove the Conflagration. Healers and ranged DPS should be alert to the location of both tank and Conflagration target; steer clear of these.\nPhase two ends if the head reaches about 30% health, or when the body heals to 100%.\nPhase three.\nThe Horseman does not use Conflagration in Phase Three. Eventually he will toss four Pulsing Pumpkins, which sprout Pumpkin Fiends after several seconds, and they will completely heal. The fastest course of action seems to be having the tank stand in the middle of the pumpkins with focus abilities at the ready. The rest of the party continues DPS on the Horseman until his head is tossed. If the party has low DPS, a second or even third wave of Pulsing Pumpkins can be spawned before the head is tossed. \nTanking the Horseman on the steps to the underground area will cause all the spawns to land very close to the boss. This should make it very easy for the tank to pick them all up. \nOnce the Head of the Horseman dies, the Headless Horseman has been defeated, and the remaining pumpkins will die. If you don't kill the Head of the Horseman before the Horseman heals to 100%, Phase Three will repeat, meaning you have to nuke the Horseman again to get him to toss his head. \nAdditional notes.\nWhen the Horseman was introduced in 2007, making multiple attempts required resetting the instance each time and creating multiple instance IDs, running up against the 5 instances per hour rule. In 2008, the event was changed so that resetting the instance was no longer required.\nLoot.\nAs of 2017, all gear drops - including those in the Loot-Filled Pumpkin - scale to your character level when you acquire them.\nThe Headless Horseman can also drop any item normally found in a &lt;a href=\"Treat%20Bag\"&gt;Treat Bag&lt;/a&gt;.\n2015 drops.\nThe following items only dropped from the level 100 version of the Headless Horseman (2015), and are listed here for historical purposes only.\n2012-2014 drops.\nThe following items only dropped from the level 90 version of the Headless Horseman (2012-2014), and are listed here for historical purposes only.\n2011 / 2024 drops.\nThe following items dropped in 2011 (historical) from the level 85 version of the Headless Horseman and are currently dropping in 2024 in Cataclysm Classic.\nIn 2024 the Loot-Filled Pumpkin contains The Horseman's Sinister Saber and The Horseman's Horrific Helmet. They are not looted from the Horseman.\n2009-2010 drops.\nThe following items only dropped from the level 80 version of the Headless Horseman (2009\u201310), and are listed here for historical purposes only.\n2007-2008 drops.\nThe following items only dropped from the level 70 version of the Headless Horseman (2007-8), and are listed here for historical purposes only.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

Situated in &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;, this Black Citadel was later &lt;a href=\"retcon\"&gt;retcon&lt;/a&gt;ned into actually being the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Valley\"&gt;Shadowmoon Valley&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nThe Black Citadel was a menacing structure in the &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; region of &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. Shortly after the destruction of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;'s many portals, a &lt;a href=\"Annihilan\"&gt;pit lord&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Magtheridon\"&gt;Magtheridon&lt;/a&gt; used the Black Citadel as a throne from which to rule over Outland. Magtheridon used the portals Ner'zhul created to summon members of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, bolstering his armies and hold on Outland.\n&lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; and his lieutenants - &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Vashj\"&gt;Lady Vashj&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Akama\"&gt;Akama&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Broken\"&gt;Broken&lt;/a&gt; - led their followers through Outland in an effort to hide Illidan from his master, &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;. He attempted this by destroying all portals in Outland, the &lt;a href=\"Dimensional%20gateway\"&gt;access points&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; from which the Burning Legion could enter. Thinking himself finally safe from Kil'jaeden's wrath, Illidan shifted his goal from simple self-preservation to conquest. He set out to take control of Outland from the cruel Magtheridon and rule over Outland in his place.\nThe Citadel, however, was heavily guarded. Magtheridon controlled a variety of &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s, including the corrupted &lt;a href=\"fel%20orc\"&gt;fel orc&lt;/a&gt;s that relentlessly attacked Illidan's forces. &lt;a href=\"Infernal%20machine\"&gt;Infernal machine&lt;/a&gt;s sat silently along the walls to hurl devastating attacks on intruders. A huge abomination named the &lt;a href=\"Butcher%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Butcher&lt;/a&gt; lingered in the dark recesses, waiting for prey. Six fel orc &lt;a href=\"blademaster\"&gt;blademaster&lt;/a&gt;s were set up to guard: &lt;a href=\"Bonethirst\"&gt;Bonethirst&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maim%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Maim&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bloodgrin\"&gt;Bloodgrin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nera%27thor\"&gt;Nera'thor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sagra%27nel\"&gt;Sagra'nel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rend%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Rend&lt;/a&gt;. Guarding the final areas were the &lt;a href=\"Master%20of%20Pain\"&gt;Master of Pain&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mistress%20of%20Torment\"&gt;Mistress of Torment&lt;/a&gt; along with an army of Burning Legion minions. In order to get through these defenses, Illidan enlisted Lady Vashj to attack the Citadel by water and Akama to infiltrate Magtheridon's inner chambers through stealth.\nIllidan and his company succeeded in defeating Magtheridon and named themselves the new rulers of Outland. The victory was short-lived as Kil'jaeden appeared to remind Illidan that he could not escape the far-reaching gaze of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, not even in the Black Citadel.\nIn the RPG.\nIllidan the Betrayer stands as the lord of Outland, and rules his domain from a massive, black iron ziggurat called the Black Citadel. &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; was originally responsible for this hulking edifice \u2014 but now blood elves, naga, and Illidan's few other allies roam its corridors. The naga live in underground sewers, and the upper levels teem with blood elves, traps, evil and death. Rumors tell that beneath the citadel sprawls a great prison; trapped within are heroes from previous wars, languishing in unknown solitude.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; spreads before the distant Black Citadel.\nBlack Citadel and Temple.\nIn \"Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne\", the building from which Magtheridon ruled was called the Black Citadel and was positioned north of \"Shadowmoon Ruins\" near the \"Mountains of Flame\" in northern Hellfire Peninsula on the map of Outland. The Shadowmoon Ruins were likely intended to be the ruins of Fortress Shadowmoon or the Shadowmoon Clan's settlement holdings, which were originally south of Hellfire Peninsula according to the maps in \"\" (listed as \"Shadowmoon Lands\" or \"Shadowmoon Clan\").\nThe Outland map in \"\", however, was designed specifically in order to make it closer (though not exactly the same) to the \"Warcraft II\" maps: the Shadowmoon Ruins on \"The Frozen Throne\" map were moved back to their original location in Shadowmoon Valley, and the Black Citadel and Fortress Shadowmoon became the same structure, known as the Black Temple."}

It reigned over much of the world after the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Lord\"&gt;Elemental Lord&lt;/a&gt;s and their armies failed to repel the Old Gods. The empire was ultimately destroyed by the &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt; armies of the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the Black Empire was recreated by &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;, before being defeated by Azeroth's &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Azeroth\"&gt;Heart of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nAncient times.\nAfter slamming into Azeroth from the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;Great Dark Beyond&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt; embedded themselves in the world's surface and sent their tentacles slithering towards the planet's defenseless core and its nascent &lt;a href=\"world-soul\"&gt;world-soul&lt;/a&gt;. As they spread their corruptive influence across the land, two races arose from the organic matter that seeped from their blighted forms: the cunning &lt;a href=\"n%27raqi\"&gt;n'raqi&lt;/a&gt; and the resilient &lt;a href=\"aqir\"&gt;aqir&lt;/a&gt;. The n'raqi, or \"faceless ones\", acted as taskmasters, employing the &lt;a href=\"insectoid\"&gt;insectoid&lt;/a&gt; aqir to build massive citadels and temples around the massive bulks of their Old God masters. The greatest of these bastions was built around &lt;a href=\"Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;Y'Shaarj&lt;/a&gt;, the most powerful and wicked of the Old Gods. This burgeoning civilization was located near the center of Azeroth's largest continent, and soon the holdings of Y'Shaarj and the other Old Gods would spread across the world, becoming known as the Black Empire. Massive sacrifices and living buildings filled with &lt;a href=\"void\"&gt;void&lt;/a&gt; energy were some of the distinguishing features of this shadowy domain.\nThe rise of the Black Empire did not go unnoticed by the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Lord\"&gt;Elemental Lord&lt;/a&gt;s, who had previously been the only inhabitants of Azeroth. Seeing the Old Ones as a threat to their dominion, for the first time in Azeroth's history, the native spirits of the world united against a common enemy. Ultimately, however, the &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt;s could not stand against the endless swarms of n'raqi and aqir, and the Old Gods eventually succeeded in enslaving the Elemental Lords. Without the native spirits of the world to hinder the Old Gods' influence, the Black Empire's borders crept over much of the desiccated world. Perpetual twilight descended upon Azeroth, and the world spiraled into an abyss of death and suffering.\nThe Old Gods constantly fought against each other, through infinite armies that clashed in ceaseless battle. The forces of &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;, led by the &lt;a href=\"C%27Thrax\"&gt;C'Thrax&lt;/a&gt;xi &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Zon%27ozz\"&gt;Warlord Zon'ozz&lt;/a&gt;, waged endless war against the forces of &lt;a href=\"C%27Thun\"&gt;C'Thun&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt; and at one point, N'Zoth also lost a great battle to &lt;a href=\"Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;Y'Shaarj&lt;/a&gt; in the land now known as the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;. However, as was so often the case, even defeat ultimately worked in N'Zoth's favor.\nArrival of the titans.\nOne day, however, the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s arrived with the intention of purging Azeroth of the Old Gods' corruption and saving its growing world-soul. As the titans' bodies were too massive for them to take action directly without risking permanent harm to the planet, they instead crafted the mighty &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 the &lt;a href=\"aesir\"&gt;aesir&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"vanir\"&gt;vanir&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 to do battle in their stead. The titan-forged succeeded in defeating the Elemental Lords and sealing them in an &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Plane\"&gt;Elemental Plane&lt;/a&gt; and destroyed most of the aqiri race, but when they began making their way towards the temple city of Y'Shaarj, the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; feared that the Old God would prove too great a challenge for them. &lt;a href=\"Aman%27Thul\"&gt;Aman'Thul&lt;/a&gt; the Highfather decided to take direct action, despite the risk of inflicting permanent damage to the planet. Thus, he reached down through Azeroth's skies and ripped Y'Shaarj from the surface of the world, tearing the Old God apart and obliterating hundreds of titan-forged in the process. To the titans' horror, a &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;great wound&lt;/a&gt; was left in Y'Shaarj's wake, and the world-soul's &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; lifeblood erupted from the scar to roil out across the world. The Pantheon realized that the Old Gods had burrowed far deeper into the surface than anticipated, and they could not risk excising the remaining three Old Ones, lest Azeroth be completely destroyed. Instead, the Pantheon ordered their titan-forged servants to imprison the remaining Old Gods and contain their evil below the earth, rather than outright killing them.\nAfter several long and difficult battles, the titan-forged succeeded in imprisoning &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"C%27Thun\"&gt;C'Thun&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt; where they lay, even after Yogg-Saron unleashed its mighty C'Thraxxi generals. The Black Empire was no more, and for the first time in Azeroth's history, a tentative peace settled over the world.\nModern times.\nEven after the Black Empire's fall, the Old Gods continue to influence the mortal world through &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods%27%20forces\"&gt;whomever they can influence and enslave&lt;/a&gt;, and they have repeatedly sought to reassert their dominion over Azeroth by recreating the Black Empire, such as during the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nAfter arriving on Azeroth, &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer clan&lt;/a&gt; heard the whispers of the Old Gods, who showed the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt; visions of the terrible glory of the Black Empire, which the Twilight's Hammer could help rebuild as a way of heralding the &lt;a href=\"Hour%20of%20Twilight\"&gt;Hour of Twilight&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, N'Zoth intended to use &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; to restore the Black Empire and shroud the world in shadow.\nAt least some powerful n'raqi also seek to reforge the Black Empire and restore it to its former glory.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nThe &lt;a href=\"blood%20troll\"&gt;blood troll&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Nazmir\"&gt;Nazmir&lt;/a&gt; serving &lt;a href=\"G%27huun\"&gt;G'huun&lt;/a&gt; aimed to free the Old God in order to restore the Black Empire.\nLater during &lt;a href=\"Investigating%20the%20Halls\"&gt;Investigating the Halls&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt; surmises that the nightmarish visions seen by the player is a future with a restored Black Empire, and theorizes that this is N'Zoth's ultimate goal. Wrathion later surmises that N'Zoth intends to do so by seizing control of the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Origination\"&gt;Forge of Origination&lt;/a&gt; and use the &lt;a href=\"Reorigination%20Protocol\"&gt;Reorigination Protocol&lt;/a&gt; to transform Azeroth. At N'Zoth's command, the Black Empire &lt;a href=\"Assaults\"&gt;assaults&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Uldum\"&gt;Uldum&lt;/a&gt; under the command of &lt;a href=\"Vil%27raxx\"&gt;Vil'raxx&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Black%20Warden%20Rhothkozz\"&gt;Black Warden Rhothkozz&lt;/a&gt;, respectively.\nSeeking to stop N'Zoth from claiming Azeroth, &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; invaded &lt;a href=\"Ny%27alotha%2C%20the%20Waking%20City\"&gt;Ny'alotha, the Waking City&lt;/a&gt; combating the Black Empire and ultimately defeating, and presumably killing, N'Zoth.\nDragonflight.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"bronze%20dragon\"&gt;bronze dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Chronormu\"&gt;Chronormu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"infinite%20dragon\"&gt;infinite dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Eternus\"&gt;Eternus&lt;/a&gt; battle each other across time, the Black Empire is one of the eras they time travel to. It appears to be early into the Black Empire's history as the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Lords\"&gt;Elemental Lords&lt;/a&gt; can be seen in the background battling the Old Gods' minions, not yet enslaved."}

Regardless of which NPC players use, only max-level players can access the auction house.\nHow it works.\nInstead of buying items from other players like the regular &lt;a href=\"Auction%20House\"&gt;Auction House&lt;/a&gt;, items on the Black Market are generated and listed by NPCs. The items are listed for one day only. The items for sale vary from items that were made unobtainable, to rare drops and &lt;a href=\"TCG\"&gt;TCG&lt;/a&gt; items. All items are listed infrequently, so it should not be seen as a reliable way to farm rarities.\nBidding works like the regular Auction House. There is no buyout price. The sky (or the &lt;a href=\"gold%20cap\"&gt;gold cap&lt;/a&gt;) is the limit when competing with other players for the final bid. With a successful purchase, the item is sent in the mail. Normal &lt;a href=\"Bind%20on%20Pickup\"&gt;Bind on Pickup&lt;/a&gt; rules apply, so you must bid on the correct character.\nThe supply of items is &lt;a href=\"realm\"&gt;realm&lt;/a&gt;-based. Each realm will have different items for sale at any one time and prices are likely to vary wildly from server to server.\nIf empty, the item window will list \"There are no items at this time. Please check back later.\"\nItems for sale.\nThese are items that \"may\" appear for sale. There may be more items which, due to the random nature of listings, have not been seen yet.\nNPCs.\nMost auctions are posted by various well-known NPCs, depending on the item type:\nRemote access.\nIn &lt;a href=\"patch%206.2.0\"&gt;patch 6.2.0&lt;/a&gt;, a representative of the black market auction house was introduced, &lt;a href=\"Zhang%20Yeoh\"&gt;Zhang Yeoh&lt;/a&gt; will become a resident of the player's garrison upon completing &lt;a href=\"The%20Missing%20Manifest\"&gt;The Missing Manifest&lt;/a&gt;, which comes from &lt;a href=\"Waterlogged%20Manifest\"&gt;Waterlogged Manifest&lt;/a&gt; rewarded from the shipyard mission &lt;a href=\"Black%20Market%20Journal\"&gt;Black Market Journal&lt;/a&gt;.

It is this region where the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s first appeared in &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; through the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe bleak swamp of the Black Morass was originally a land of marshes and low hills, bayous and backwaters, failed settlements and lurking danger. The &lt;a href=\"Morass%20Road\"&gt;Morass Road&lt;/a&gt; crossed the swamp. The &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; usually stayed on the roads, which gave an advantage to the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s who soon knew the area better than its natives.\nFirst War.\nOnce Medivh had opened the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Orcish Horde&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; begin to cross their side of the portal into &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; reaching the swampland known as the Black Morass. It was here where the orcs made their first stronghold in the new world while they sent scouts to explore the area. After rumors of new creatures in the Black Morass &lt;a href=\"Llane%20Wrynn%20I\"&gt;King Llane&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; dispatched Sir &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt; to uncover who they were. Lothar led a small force of knights to scout the Black Morass, resulting in the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20Stormwind\"&gt;Knights of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; clashing with orcs for the first time in a series of bloody skirmishes. Lothar and his men scored a number of small victories, yet for every orcs killed two more seemed to take its place. The humans were more outnumbered in each subsequent battle, and Lothar was eventually forced to pull back without venturing deep enough into the heavily guarded Black Morass to find the Dark Portal. Around this time, the Morass Road traversed the swamp making it easier for travel.\nThe orcs built the settlements of &lt;a href=\"Rockard\"&gt;Rockard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stonard\"&gt;Stonard&lt;/a&gt;, and the first &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Temple of the Damned&lt;/a&gt; deep within the region. &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; assigned &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; to oversee the construction of an outpost in the &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20of%20Sorrows\"&gt;Swamp of Sorrows&lt;/a&gt;. As time passed, the Dark Portal began to wither the land around it.\nSecond War.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; this area was the domain of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Tooth%20Grin%20clan\"&gt;Black Tooth Grin clan&lt;/a&gt;, who were entrusted with the keeping of the Dark Portal.\nThe defeat at &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt; irreparably shattered &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Doomhammer's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. A large group of those who fled the battle made their way south, led by the &lt;a href=\"Death%20knight%20%28Old%20Horde%29\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Teron%20Gorefiend\"&gt;Teron Gorefiend&lt;/a&gt;. Their intention to reach the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; and, by extension, the relative safety of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, was ruthlessly harassed by &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; and his armies. They tracked Gorefiend's force as it reached the Black Morass; the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; was eager to discover the exact location of the mystical portal from which the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s had first invaded their world, which had eluded the human leadership thus far.\nTuralyon and his forces descended upon their enemies just outside the Dark Portal itself. The ensuing battle proved to be one of the most brutal and desperate fought in the war, with the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and their death knights battling furiously for simple survival. In the end, they were able to hold off their Alliance foes long enough for the majority of their own forces to escape through the gateway. Unwilling to take the risk of pursuing, Turalyon ordered his soldiers not to follow the Horde through. Instead, he chose to have the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic gateway sealed forever.\nTo carry out this task, Turalyon called upon the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; and his fellow spellcasters. Together, they gathered around the Dark Portal and channeled an immense spell to rip the structure apart. The incantation succeeded in pulling apart the very threads keeping the rift open, forcing the path to another world to slam shut. The backlash of residual energy blasted apart the stone frame of the Dark Portal in a blinding arcane explosion. As the portal crumbled to dust, the gathered Alliance forces jubilantly cheered the development. The destruction of the gateway to Draenor marked the end of the Second War and, for the vast majority of those gathered, the end of a dark and personal chapter in their lives. The Alliance was victorious, yet the cost had been high.\nBy the time of the Alliance's destruction of the Portal the southern portion of the Black Morass was nothing more than parched red soil devoid of plant-life, mirroring &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;'s transformation of &lt;a href=\"Tanaan%20Jungle\"&gt;Tanaan Jungle&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;. Yet the rift between the two worlds remained, and its damaging effects continued. This left behind a completely waterless, treeless wasteland which became known as the &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt; while the northernmost part was named the &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20of%20Sorrows\"&gt;Swamp of Sorrows&lt;/a&gt;, in honor of those who had died during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the final battle against the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nethergarde%20Keep\"&gt;Nethergarde Keep&lt;/a&gt; was built and &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;elven&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"scout\"&gt;scout&lt;/a&gt;s were placed on continual patrol within the region searching for any sign of the renegade &lt;a href=\"Bleeding%20Hollow%20clan\"&gt;Bleeding Hollow clan&lt;/a&gt;. The orc clan, because they had failed to arrive in time to take part in the battle at &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, were now disappeared into the wilds near the &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt; to plot their next move rather than risk destruction by attacking the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nThe Black Morass can be visited in a \"\" instance, accessible through the &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt; in the event called &lt;a href=\"Opening%20the%20Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Opening the Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;."}

Disturbed by her passage between the two worlds, gave birth to on the very edge of the portal.\nFollowing the orcs' arrival on Azeroth the area around the orcs' encampment rapidly began to change. Prior to Durotan's meeting with the humans of Stormwind he noticed that the land was changing to resemble that on the other side of the portal, the marshy swampland rapidly drying out. The less affected areas still bore plants and areas of stagnant water; over time the water seems to become polluted by the fel, turning it a bright green, and the plants begin to die. In the parts where the changes have progressed the furthest the ground has turned entirely to dirt, parched and thirsty, even the plants having died and been ground to dust. However, the corruption was highly localized: lush trees still cover the nearby hills, and dense foliage surrounds the encampment."}

This elven structure served as a bulwark against the Legion during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, until a shadow fell upon it. Black Rook Hold is a dungeon in \"\". You start in the catacombs below Black Rook Hold and work your way through the outside to the top of the spire.\nBackground.\nThe location that would later become Black Rook Hold was originally a huge granite formation atop a high and treacherous mount. The first &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; to bear the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Ravencrest\"&gt;clan designation of Ravencrest&lt;/a&gt; remarked that the stocky formation resembled a piece from a chessboard, a rook colored black and that huge, dark birds circled and nested atop it, which he took as a sign. For more than a kaldorei generation, the solid rock was carved into a fortress like none other seen among the &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Empire\"&gt;empire&lt;/a&gt;. The structure stood in terms of magnificence second only to the &lt;a href=\"Azshara%27s%20Palace\"&gt;royal palace&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Zin-Azshari\"&gt;Zin-Azshari&lt;/a&gt; and extended its military influence over most of the realm, the power of Black Rook Hold tipping the balance when conflict arose between the night elves and the &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt;.\nWar of the Ancients.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; the Hold stood as a defensive gathering place for the night elves to strategize and plan the stand against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Ravencrest\"&gt;Lord Ravencrest&lt;/a&gt; was the current head of this monumental structure. The hold was said to have the strength to withstand an attack from the Burning Legion for days, giving time for its inhabitants to make a stand \u2014 or flee to safer ground.\nLegion.\nAfter stealing the corpse of &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20the%20Wardens\"&gt;Vault of the Wardens&lt;/a&gt;, conducted a ritual to separate his soul from his body. This energy brought the souls of the Ravencrest clan back to their ancestral home. The ghosts of the Hold's forces have been risen by Gul'dan, from the lowliest soldier to &lt;a href=\"Desdel%20Stareye\"&gt;Desdel Stareye&lt;/a&gt; and even Lord Ravencrest himself, to protect the secrets within the tower. These undead night elves cannot see the living for what they truly are and believe them to be demons as they eternally relive the horrors of the War of Ancients.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"Carved from the greatest mountain of Val'sharah by ancient elven masons, Black Rook Hold stood as a bulwark against the Burning Legion during the War of the Ancients. The nigh-impregnable fortress is also the ancestral home of Lord Kur'talos Ravencrest, one-time mentor of Illidan himself. But since the latest Legion attack, a strange dark energy emanates from the Hold, and restless dead plague the surrounding lands.\""}

In Frostfire, she asked the Horde commander to speak with the &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20orcs\"&gt;Frostwolf orcs&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Throm%27var\"&gt;Throm'var&lt;/a&gt; on their behalf. When Khadgar was nearly assassinated by , Cordana fought her off and forced Garona to flee.\nCordana later joined Khadgar at &lt;a href=\"Zangarra\"&gt;Zangarra&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;'s base in &lt;a href=\"Talador\"&gt;Talador&lt;/a&gt;. As Khadgar searched for , the warlock once again sent Garona. This time, the assassin succeeded in stabbing and poisoning Khadgar. After Cordana recovered, she ordered the commander to hunt Garona down while she stayed with the archmage and called for help. When the commander caught Garona and returned to the tower with her antidote, Khadgar refused healing magic and instead told Cordana to stitch him back up so he could return to tracking Gul'dan.\nAfter the death of , Cordana helped Khadgar break Garona free of Gul'dan's control. She stopped Khadgar's initial attempt to interrogate Garona about her master, seeing it as torture. Khadgar agreed and backed off, sending the commander to get a Shadow Council &lt;a href=\"Orb%20of%20Dominion\"&gt;Orb of Dominion&lt;/a&gt;. After using it to break Gul'dan's hold over Garona's mind, Cordana took the orb away to destroy it. She stayed behind in Zangarra while Khadgar and Garona traveled to &lt;a href=\"Bladefury%27s%20Command\"&gt;Bladefury's Command&lt;/a&gt; to apprehend Gul'dan.\nDue to the Orb of Dominion's influence, Gul'dan was able to corrupt Cordana from afar. When the commander brought her a number of &lt;a href=\"Tome%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Tomes of Chaos&lt;/a&gt; from to destroy, she instead attempted to use the fel magic within them to take the ring Khadgar had given the commander. The commander was forced to fight her until she retreated through a demonic portal, vowing that the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; would soon come to destroy &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Khadgar was visibly stricken with grief at her betrayal.\nLegion.\nWorking with Gul'dan, Cordana led him into the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20the%20Wardens\"&gt;Vault of the Wardens&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;, to the chamber where &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt;'s corpse had been locked away after his defeat at the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt; years before. Cordana and Gul'dan were confronted by and &lt;a href=\"demon%20hunter\"&gt;demon hunter&lt;/a&gt;s which she had freed to fight off the Legion invasion. Maiev told Cordana that she would answer to the High Council for her treachery, but Cordana and Gul'dan escaped with Illidan's corpse.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for the Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, Cordana was summoned by in front of the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;.\nShe contacted the &lt;a href=\"Felsworn\"&gt;Felsworn&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Cailyn%20Paledoom\"&gt;Cailyn Paledoom&lt;/a&gt; through a Legion Communicator in order to discover &lt;a href=\"Azurewing\"&gt;nearby dragons&lt;/a&gt;' moves.\nCordana remained in the Vault of the Wardens with the &lt;a href=\"Sargerite%20Keystone\"&gt;Sargerite Keystone&lt;/a&gt; that had been kept there. She tempted many demon hunters to join the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; before ultimately being slain. Following her death, the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Deathlord&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; used her &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20the%20Warden\"&gt;eye&lt;/a&gt; to help create &lt;a href=\"Rottgut\"&gt;Rottgut&lt;/a&gt;, and the First of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Harvest\"&gt;Black Harvest&lt;/a&gt; sent by &lt;a href=\"Kira%20Iresoul\"&gt;Kira Iresoul&lt;/a&gt; used &lt;a href=\"Felsworn%20Heart\"&gt;her heart&lt;/a&gt; to empower the &lt;a href=\"Bloodstone%20%28quest%20item%29\"&gt;Bloodstone (quest item)&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuotes.\nGossip.\nIshnu-alah, commander.\nI'll be fine!\nIn the RPG.\nCordana Felsong is a female &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"warden\"&gt;warden&lt;/a&gt;. She uses her spell-like abilities to appear and disappear within shadow. She casts Silence first, to unnerve her opponents and to prevent &lt;a href=\"Caster\"&gt;spellcasters&lt;/a&gt; from using verbal spell components. Then she targets one foe and appears from the darkness nearby, attacking swiftly and retreating for another pass.\nCordana is described as: \"She steps from the shadows as if emerging from a dark pool, her delicate features forming in front of those she encounters. Tall and lithe, she wears no armor but carries an impressive silvery blade as if it weighed nothing. Her cool gaze sweeps across them, and they feel as if they have been judged \u2014 and barely deemed acceptable.\"\nSpeculation.\nShe might have told Gul'dan about the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20the%20Wardens\"&gt;Vault of the Wardens&lt;/a&gt; and maybe even about &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt; after she was corrupted by the orb.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

Try to turn so that the dog's head is facing outwards. This way, as few tanks as possible will likely be hit by the melee dot. \nAfter every dog has a suitable number of sunders (2 minimum, but 5 is ideal), you can call in the AoE attacks. This will help get all the dogs dead at the same time. Any person that does single target damage is also constantly looking for the dog with the highest HP to target. This is very important, if a single hound dies too soon then it will be reignited by the living hounds and in turn will reignite the others when they die. If the Core Hounds do revive, it is still possible to recover with quick thinking and coordinated dps. It is also Important for the healers to remember to continue healing the tanks after all the Core Hounds are dead, those stackable DoT's continue doing a lot of damage after the battle."}

They are the vicious but faithful servants of the &lt;a href=\"Firelord\"&gt;Firelord&lt;/a&gt; and his minions.\nThey come in two varieties, the much more common, and larger, two-headed variant, and the smaller one-headed variant. The latter are used by the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt; as racial mounts.\nThe &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; green core hounds are also known as &lt;a href=\"fel%20beast\"&gt;fel beast&lt;/a&gt;s or fel core hounds.\nDescription.\nA core hound has the appearance of a massive &lt;a href=\"dog\"&gt;dog&lt;/a&gt; with one or two heads, with a mouth filled with rows of flaming teeth. Its body is covered with armored hide and the head is studded with bony spikes. A streak of flames runs down its spine from head to stubby tail. \nBackground.\nThe oldest and most powerful of the core hounds is &lt;a href=\"Magmadar\"&gt;Magmadar&lt;/a&gt;, the alpha male and sire of the entire current pack. Every core hound can trace their lineage back to Magmadar.\nCore hounds originate from the &lt;a href=\"Firelands\"&gt;Firelands&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Plane\"&gt;Elemental Plane&lt;/a&gt;, however, they also lived alongside their master &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Core\"&gt;Molten Core&lt;/a&gt; and recently started to invade &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;. The largest is known is &lt;a href=\"Magmadar\"&gt;Magmadar&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Golemagg%20the%20Incinerator\"&gt;Golemagg the Incinerator&lt;/a&gt; seems to treat them as pets. There is also a small captured one in upper &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt; known as &lt;a href=\"the%20Beast\"&gt;the Beast&lt;/a&gt;, who has swallowed &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt; explorer &lt;a href=\"Pip%20Quickwit\"&gt;Pip Quickwit&lt;/a&gt;.\nCore hound hide called &lt;a href=\"Core%20Leather\"&gt;Core Leather&lt;/a&gt; can be used to fashion armor and bags.\nTypes.\nOne-headed type:\nAs a companion pet.\nA &lt;a href=\"Core%20Hound%20Pup\"&gt;Core Hound Pup&lt;/a&gt; is mailed out to the first character to logon on accounts that have a &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Authenticator\"&gt;Blizzard Authenticator&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Mobile%20Authenticator\"&gt;Blizzard Mobile Authenticator&lt;/a&gt; attached, including accounts that are attached to an authenticator in the future. It represents the authenticator as being the \"guard dog\" of your account.\nAs a hunter pet.\nCore Hounds are a family of &lt;a href=\"Exotic%20Beasts\"&gt;exotic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Pet_abilities%23Ferocity_abilities\"&gt;Ferocity pets&lt;/a&gt;, only tamable by &lt;a href=\"Hunter_abilities%23Specializations\"&gt;Beast Mastery&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s starting at level 39.\nCore Hounds, through use of their &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Hysteria\"&gt;Ancient Hysteria&lt;/a&gt; ability, can increase melee, ranged, and spell casting speed by 30% for all party and raid members for 40 seconds. This makes them a good choice in &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt;s when player-provided buffs such as &lt;a href=\"Bloodlust\"&gt;Bloodlust&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Heroism\"&gt;Heroism&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Time%20Warp\"&gt;Time Warp&lt;/a&gt; are not available. They also have a special exotic ability, &lt;a href=\"Lava%20Breath\"&gt;Lava Breath&lt;/a&gt;, which reduces the target's casting speed by 10% for 10 seconds. They retain their signature roar when tamed, though the loudest is &lt;a href=\"Chromaggus\"&gt;Chromaggus&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Traditional\" red core hounds can be found and tamed in &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Core\"&gt;Molten Core&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;. However, other beasts lore-wise not related to core hounds also count toward this pet family:\nIn the RPG.\nCore hounds use simple tactics, attacking the most obviously threatening target first. They will typically attempt an improved grab or bull rush to push their target into nearby lava. A core hound with flaming breath takes hold of a victim before using its flaming breath, thus preventing the victim from escaping the effect. Core hounds grow and gain power throughout their lives. Core hounds understand &lt;a href=\"Kalimag\"&gt;Kalimag&lt;/a&gt; but cannot speak."}

These races speak a number of &lt;a href=\"language\"&gt;language&lt;/a&gt;s, have different &lt;a href=\"Racial%20Traits\"&gt;racial traits&lt;/a&gt;, and can pursue different &lt;a href=\"class\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt;es.\nPlayable races in \"World of Warcraft\" belong to one of the game's two main &lt;a href=\"faction\"&gt;faction&lt;/a&gt;s: the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. The playable &lt;a href=\"Pandaren%20%28playable%29\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dracthyr%20%28playable%29\"&gt;dracthyr&lt;/a&gt; are the only exception being able to join either faction. For playable &lt;a href=\"character\"&gt;character&lt;/a&gt;s, choice of race is therefore restricted by faction. \n&lt;a href=\"Allied%20race\"&gt;Allied race&lt;/a&gt;s are another type of playable race that need to be unlocked before being able to play them.\nClasses.\nBase stats vary depending on the class. The race's stat modifiers are applied on top of the class' base stats:\nExpansion races.\nWorld of Warcraft's first expansion, &lt;a href=\"The%20Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;The Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;, brought Blood Elves for the Horde, and Draenei for the Alliance into the game as playable races. The third expansion, \"\", introduced Worgen for the Alliance and Goblins for the Horde. It also added a number of new race/class combinations. The fourth expansion, &lt;a href=\"Mists%20of%20Pandaria\"&gt;Mists of Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, introduced Pandaren as the game's first Neutral race. Pandaren characters would choose between the Alliance and Horde after completing their starting zone at level 10.\nRemoval of expansion requirement.\nIn August 2012, Blizzard Entertainment announced that &lt;a href=\"patch%205.0.4\"&gt;patch 5.0.4&lt;/a&gt; would remove the expansion requirement on all previous races requiring one. This gave all players, regardless of what version of World of Warcraft they had, the ability to create characters of all races except the then-new pandaren, which would still require the expansion (&lt;a href=\"Patch%206.0.2\"&gt;Patch 6.0.2&lt;/a&gt; subsequently removed this requirement).\nCurrently, the only race that requires an expansion pack is the &lt;a href=\"dracthyr%20%28playable%29\"&gt;dracthyr&lt;/a&gt;, which was introduced in (and requires) the expansion."}

However, Coren fought and whined his way into the contest as well. While Chen and Grimbooze were quite even in votes on their drinks, Coren only had two votes - one from himself, and one that Chen had given him out of pity. Angered, Coren attacked, but was knocked into the air by Chen and landed in an open keg, getting soaked in beer. Fuming, Coren climbed out and stalked off. Since that day, Coren and his minions have attacked every Brewfest annually.\nCoren is not only unable to let go of a grudge, but remains sensitive about his work. While his current &lt;a href=\"Direbrew%27s%20Dire%20Brew\"&gt;Dire Brew&lt;/a&gt; is an excellent product, he will not suffer critics, and the last person to insult his brew was fed to &lt;a href=\"dire%20boar\"&gt;dire boar&lt;/a&gt;s.\nCoren Direbrew won the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Brewfest%20Kodo\"&gt;Great Brewfest Kodo&lt;/a&gt; after drinking a &lt;a href=\"Tauren\"&gt;Tauren&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt; under the table - and the druid was in &lt;a href=\"Bear%20Form\"&gt;Bear Form&lt;/a&gt;. It was one of Direbrew's proudest moments.\nAttacks and abilities.\nAdd Abilities:\nStrategy.\nFight starts with the boss and 3 regular adds. Defeat them quickly and then nuke the boss. Occasionally drills will spawn (like during the Dark Iron Attack at Brewfest proper), knocking players back and spawning another add. Ranged DPS and healers need to avoid Coren Direbrew's melee range, or they may be disarmed and receive heavy damage. Otherwise, put damage on the boss while taking care of adds, specifically killing the brew maidens quickly so there's less chance they can stun someone if they're slow to use the tossed drink.\nGeneral Notes:\nCoren Direbrew:\nIlsa &amp; Ursula Direbrew:\nDark Iron Antagonists:\nLoot.\nThe item &lt;a href=\"Direbrew%27s%20Dire%20Brew\"&gt;Direbrew's Dire Brew&lt;/a&gt; drops the first time you defeat Coren Direbrew each year.\nAs of 2017, all items - including those in the Keg-Shaped Treasure Chest - scale to your character level when you acquire them.\nPrevious years loot.\n2009 / 2010.\nSince normal loot rules applied to these items, in 2009 a person could 'farm' Coren for one of those drops, as long as they could continue inviting people into the group who had not started the event (IE make Coren hostile) that day. The 2010 event enforces that each character only has one chance per day to get one of the special items through the keg.\nQuotes.\n&lt;br&gt;\nVideos.\n - September 23, 2008"}

She blesses fellow zealots by harnessing &lt;a href=\"nether%20dragon\"&gt;nether dragon&lt;/a&gt; essences to transform these believers into menacing &lt;a href=\"twilight%20drakonid\"&gt;twilight drakonid&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nStrategy.\nCorla is surrounded by 2 Twilight Zealots (heroic: 3). When the fight starts, the zealots will be inactive, but will begin gaining stacks of Evolution. If a zealot reaches 100 stacks, it will transform into an Evolved Twilight Zealot, which attacks normally and deals high damage.\nThe key to the fight is preventing these transformations. Each zealot has a purple beam connecting it to the nether drake at the top of the room. If a player stands in that beam, he will 'steal' its effect; the zealot will stop gaining Evolution, and the player will get it instead. If a player reaches 100 stacks, he will transform and become mind-controlled, likely wiping the group.\nEvolution has a 15 second duration, and takes 20 seconds to reach 100 stacks. This means that a single player can trade the beam back and forth with an assigned zealot every 15 to 20 seconds without either of them evolving. On heroic mode it is necessary to do this to all 3 zealots for the entire fight, as a zealot evolving tends to be disastrous. On normal mode, however, some groups find it easier to alternate 2-3 players in one beam while letting the other zealot evolve, killing it, and returning to the boss. On heroic mode, since three players are necessary, and there aren't enough players to keep all of the beams under control, a good rule of thumb is to sit in the beam until you have around 70-80 stacks, jump out of the beam and wait for the debuff to wear off before jumping back in the beam. Rinse and repeat as needed.\nThe last problem is that Corla periodically fears a random player using Dark Command. Dark Command is a 2-second cast and must be interrupted, since a player stepping out of his beam at the wrong time will likely result in an evolution. If a player does get feared away, one of the players who weren't on a beam before must take his place until his stacks clear.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

Led by &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Waycrest\"&gt;Lady Waycrest&lt;/a&gt; herself, the witches have occupied the city, corrupted the guards, and continue to use its citizens in horrifying rituals. Those who survived the disaster have fled to &lt;a href=\"Arom%27s%20Stand\"&gt;Arom's Stand&lt;/a&gt; seeking refuge, while the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20Embers\"&gt;Order of Embers&lt;/a&gt; wages a war to drive the Coven from the city.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"House%20Waycrest\"&gt;House Waycrest&lt;/a&gt; secured its position in &lt;a href=\"Drustvar\"&gt;Drustvar&lt;/a&gt; when they finally defeated the &lt;a href=\"Drust\"&gt;Drust&lt;/a&gt;, safeguarding all of &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;. Since then, they have ruled over Drustvar as lords, traditionally residing in &lt;a href=\"Waycrest%20Manor\"&gt;Waycrest Manor&lt;/a&gt; surrounded by Corlain.\nDue to its size and proximity to the manor, Corlain became one of the first victims of the &lt;a href=\"Heartsbane%20Coven\"&gt;Heartsbane Coven&lt;/a&gt; of witches. The Coven was founded in Corlain, and secretly led by &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Waycrest\"&gt;Lady Waycrest&lt;/a&gt; herself. In a matter of weeks, Lady Waycrest had the city's guard under her dark control and attracted many citizens of Corlain as initiates to her new coven. Most of the populace remained troubled, but unaware of the true threat until Waycrest acted. The Heartsbane seized control of Corlain easily, capturing or killing most of the citizenry. Some survivors fled to &lt;a href=\"Arom%27s%20Stand\"&gt;Arom's Stand&lt;/a&gt;, while those who could not become mindless slaves to the witches.\nAs the Coven's influence began to spread across Drustvar, Corlain became the center of their operations and plans. Lady Waycrest, the \"Mother\", secluded herself within Waycrest Manor, while her followers busied themselves in the fallen city. Many more coverts were recruited and trained within Corlain, and the witches' ranks expanded rapidly. While most of the defenders were corrupted against their will, a brigade of halberdiers under &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Goodspeed\"&gt;Captain Goodspeed&lt;/a&gt; willingly joined the Heartsbane.\nThe newly-refounded &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20Embers\"&gt;Order of Embers&lt;/a&gt; eventually arrived on Corlain's outskirts with the aim of liberating the city and putting an end to Lady Waycrest. Under the direction of Lady &lt;a href=\"Lucille%20Waycrest\"&gt;Lucille Waycrest&lt;/a&gt;, the Inquisitors occupied &lt;a href=\"Watchman%27s%20Rise\"&gt;Watchman's Rise&lt;/a&gt; on the outskirts and launched a campaign against the Coven. The former guards of the city under the spell of the Heartsbane were too far gone to save, and had to be killed along with the witches. Starting with lower Corlain, the Heartsbane's lieutenants and their servants were slain, while many of the enthralled citizens were saved.\nA powerful barrier placed on the main gate barred passage into Upper Corlain and Waycrest Manor. With some silver recovered from &lt;a href=\"Bleak%20Hills%20Mine\"&gt;Bleak Hills Mine&lt;/a&gt;, however, the Inquisitors fashioned explosives to break through. In the city's upper reaches, they once again cut through the Coven's toughest forces and killed their matrons, before pushing through to the Manor. There, Lucille Waycrest and her party were confronted by her mother, Lady Waycrest. Lady Waycrest ultimately retreated inside the Manor, where the Inquisitors pursued her. Deep in the house's cellar, they finally slew Lady Waycrest, ending her plans and striking a critical blow against the Coven in Corlain and all of Drustvar."}

They had competed in the past over kills, territory, and strength.\nOne day when dozens of proto-dragons were hunting in the same area, Coros and two of his companions attacked Malygos. Though outnumbered, the grey proto-dragon &lt;a href=\"Neltharion\"&gt;Neltharion&lt;/a&gt; came to Malygos's aid, establishing a friendship between the two and driving Coros and his companions off.\nLater, when the massive &lt;a href=\"Galakrond\"&gt;Galakrond&lt;/a&gt; was devouring proto-dragons, Coros cut off Malygos and hid in a crevasse his rival had intended on hiding in, leaving Malygos open to being attacked by Galakrond. Like the other proto-dragons Coros rallied under &lt;a href=\"Talonixa\"&gt;Talonixa's&lt;/a&gt; command and quickly gained her favor as evidenced by her allowing him to hunt by her side and even agreed to tentative peace with Malygos due to threat Galakrond and the &lt;a href=\"not-living\"&gt;not-living&lt;/a&gt; posed to their race.. \nDespite seeming to agree with Talonixa that the proto-dragons should rally and destroy Galakrond, Coros encouraged &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt;, who grew more vehement in her distaste for violence, in preaching her belief of peace to the other dragons. However while Ysera seemed to seek a return to the status quo, Coros preached in finding a way to live under the rule of Galakrond. When Ysera attempted to convince Talonixa to seek peace Coros left her standing her alone as he sough to deflect focus away from him, though Malygos noted if Ysera convinced the majority Coros would suddenly appear beside her.\nAt some point during the meeting Coros and his companions vanished and following the meetings end, an uneasy Malygos began to search out for them. After locating his rival Malygos discovered to his shock that Coros, in an attempt to gain protection from Galakrond had started to emulate him by practicing cannibalism and encouraged his companions to do the same. After being attacked and killing one of Coros's companions Malygos continued to secretly follow him and while hidden bore witness to Coros betraying the rest of proto-dragons by informing Galakrond of when Talonixa planned to attack the great beast. After seemingly leaving Galakrond quickly returned when Coros and his remaining companions took flight and devoured one, while Coros rammed the other to buy him time to escape. Despite this Galakrond gave chase perhaps viewing Coros as a threat, simply wanting to sate his hunger, or both, and devoured the smaller dragon."}

As he and his men try to work their way through the Overgrowth, Teegan is rather annoyed between the mosquitoes, raptors, hyenas, quilboar, diplomats, and &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt;.\nReceiving the help from an &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;, he asked them to rescue &lt;a href=\"Ambassador%20Gaines\"&gt;Ambassador Gaines&lt;/a&gt;, quell the numbers of the quilboar, and to obtain a bramblestaff. He used the bramblestaff and accidentally summoned a &lt;a href=\"Ferocious%20Jungle%20Vine%E2%80%8E\"&gt;Ferocious Jungle Vine\u200e&lt;/a&gt; that grabbed &lt;a href=\"Ol%27%20Durty%20Pete\"&gt;Ol' Durty Pete&lt;/a&gt;, but it was quickly killed by &lt;a href=\"Goucho\"&gt;Goucho&lt;/a&gt;. Then he sent the adventurer to kill &lt;a href=\"Three-Tooth\"&gt;Three-Tooth&lt;/a&gt; and her students with the staff, after which Teegan broke the staff.\nSome time after the death of &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, Teegan was alerted when a wounded Alliance &lt;a href=\"scout\"&gt;scout&lt;/a&gt; came to the camp and warned them about the attacking &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, he was encountered in &lt;a href=\"Ratchet\"&gt;Ratchet&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; champions in order to prevent the Alliance from learning about their smuggling operations in the town.\nQuotes.\nLook at this mess. I was told the Barrens would be... barren.\nThis jungle appeared overnight and has already swallowed up my camp and choked off the roads!\nWe're still cut off from Forward Command, but thanks to your 'negotiations' with the quilboar, we should be able to re-open the roads with a little elbow grease."}

However, &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard&lt;/a&gt; decided that this was not an intended option to ease raid encounters so they introduced an instance block that prevents you from entering the instance in ghost form or alive while your raid is fighting a boss inside.\nSince the same measures cannot be used for non-instanced raid encounters like &lt;a href=\"Azuregos%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Azuregos&lt;/a&gt;, most world bosses have special abilities to prevent corpse running. For example, if you died during an Azuregos fight you received a &lt;a href=\"debuff\"&gt;debuff&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href=\"Mark%20of%20Frost\"&gt;Mark of Frost&lt;/a&gt; that froze you in place if you got within 100 yards of Azuregos.\nThere are however a few encounters that allow you to corpse run, e.g. the fight against &lt;a href=\"Bloodlord%20Mandokir\"&gt;Bloodlord Mandokir&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Gurub\"&gt;Zul'Gurub&lt;/a&gt; where special &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Healer\"&gt;Spirit Healer&lt;/a&gt;s allow you to resurrect within the instance and without any &lt;a href=\"resurrection%20sickness\"&gt;resurrection sickness&lt;/a&gt;.\nCorpse running can also be used to safely traverse high-level areas. If you run to a Spirit Healer at another graveyard and ask her to bring you back to life she will do so, but the resurrection sends you back to the graveyard at which you originally spawned as a ghost. However, if you log out and log back in, your character loses its association with that graveyard's spirit healer, so you will be able to return to life at the graveyard of the spirit healer you speak to. Thus, it is possible for a character to die in one zone, reach a spirit healer far away, relog, and resurrect safely at the nearby spirit healer. When relogging the &lt;a href=\"minimap\"&gt;minimap&lt;/a&gt; arrow () for the nearest spirit healer will also disappear."}

The valley is considered the \"breadbasket\" of &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, but the year\u2019s harvest is in jeopardy and a terrible malaise has overcome the pandaren that live along the coast. The valley is also the home of the legendary &lt;a href=\"Stormstout%20Brewery\"&gt;Stormstout Brewery&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"Chen%20Stormstout\"&gt;Chen Stormstout&lt;/a&gt; and his niece &lt;a href=\"Li%20Li\"&gt;Li Li&lt;/a&gt; hope to journey to discover the whereabouts of their long-lost ancestors.\nThe pandaren grow extremely large vegetables here because there are waters that have been flowing down from &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt; for millennia. Its waters kept the Vale in bloom and their runoff into the Valley of the Four Winds created the most fertile farmland in the world.\nHistory.\nIn the golden and green fields of the Valley of the Four Winds, &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; sees to the hunger and thirst of its people. Sizeable corn and lotus crops are watered by ingenious agricultural advances and cared for by the &lt;a href=\"Tillers\"&gt;Tillers&lt;/a&gt;, Pandaren farmers who feed a growing empire. &lt;a href=\"Farm\"&gt;Farm&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"ranch\"&gt;ranch&lt;/a&gt;es and marketplaces dot a land of rolling plains and vine-covered boughs. The name &lt;a href=\"Yao%20Firmpaw\"&gt;Yao Firmpaw&lt;/a&gt; is associated with health and wellness of the area.\nIt is here that &lt;a href=\"Brewmaster\"&gt;Brewmaster&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Chen%20Stormstout\"&gt;Chen Stormstout&lt;/a&gt; arrives after a life spent traveling, first on the &lt;a href=\"Wandering%20Isle\"&gt;Wandering Isle&lt;/a&gt; and then throughout &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. Alongside &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; explorers, he'll discover the ancestral home of the Stormstout for the first time, and strive to live up to his family's name and legacy of peerless brewing. But not all is idyllic within the Valley. The ravenous appetites of long-toothed &lt;a href=\"virmen\"&gt;virmen&lt;/a&gt; and simian &lt;a href=\"hozen\"&gt;hozen&lt;/a&gt; endanger crops and farmers alike... and threaten the entire continent with starvation. If you can stop these animalistic pillagers, you\u2019ll be able to grab a plow and a shovel and cultivate Pandaria's fallow farmlands once again. Meanwhile, as farmers worry over their harvests and the hunger in their bellies, the &lt;a href=\"Serpent%27s%20Spine\"&gt;great wall&lt;/a&gt; built to keep the violent &lt;a href=\"mantid\"&gt;mantid&lt;/a&gt; race out of the Valley begins to show its first cracks...\nLegion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s attacked the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Granary\"&gt;Imperial Granary&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Pools%20of%20Purity\"&gt;Pools of Purity&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Stormstout%20Brewery\"&gt;Stormstout Brewery&lt;/a&gt;.\nGetting there.\nThe valley is accessed via a bridge from &lt;a href=\"Forest%20Heart\"&gt;Forest Heart&lt;/a&gt; in the western side of central &lt;a href=\"Jade%20Forest\"&gt;Jade Forest&lt;/a&gt;.

There are numerous pools and marshes, as well as waterfalls that both spill into the Valley and cascade from the Valley into the Krasarang Wilds to the south. The heart of the Valley is where most of the pandaren farms and settlements are located.\nThe northern border consists of sheer cliffs, separating the valley from the Vale of Eternal Blossoms. A steep path cut through the mountain leads through the Veiled Stair to Kun-Lai Summit. The western border of the valley is sealed by the Great Wall, which has kept the mantid at bay for time immemorial.\nThe Yan-Zhe River cuts along the southern border, and a thin strip of land beyond consists of the Cliffs of Despair. Access to the Krasarang Wilds beyond can only be done at either end of the cliffs via steep slopes that roll their way downward.\nThere is only one forest within the valley, and that is in the northwest. Thick with bamboo, it is shrouded in dense fog.\nMaps and subregions.\nTillers.\n&lt;a href=\"Halfhill\"&gt;Halfhill&lt;/a&gt; is the farmer's market here, which is the social hub of the Valley of the Four Winds. Every day farmers will come to the market with different problems, providing daily &lt;a href=\"quest\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt;s with the &lt;a href=\"Tillers\"&gt;Tillers&lt;/a&gt;:\nYou will be able to decorate the farm as you gain reputation. For example, you can add some pigs and slop, some other animals, and grow an apple orchard.\nStormstout Brewery.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Stormstout%20Brewery\"&gt;Stormstout Brewery&lt;/a&gt; dungeon is in the world at full size, meaning it can be used for questing as well.

Valoku advocated that they help her as she was like them and could answer their questions but Zzeraku didn't trust her. An argument was sparked between the two nether dragons that distracted the Broken enough for Tyrygosa to escape. Tyrygosa recruited the help of the two nether dragons in locating and rescuing her missing companion &lt;a href=\"Jorad%20Mace\"&gt;Jorad Mace&lt;/a&gt; but was mislead and attacked by Zzeraku before he flew off abandoning her. Valoku flew off behind him.\nAfter Tyri and Jorad were reunited they gave chase but were once again confronted by Ragnok's band of minions. Tyrygosa had once again lost her paladin companion and was disoriented when Valoku came to her rescue, taking her to his nether dragon lair. From Tyrygosa, he discovers the history of his kind's progenitor, &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, and his relation to the Netherwing dragonflight. With the promise that Tyrygosa would free their brethren from their enthrallment, they partook in the battle for the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"Ragnok%20Bloodreaver\"&gt;Ragnok Bloodreaver&lt;/a&gt;'s forces.\nTyrygosa convinced Valoku and Zzeraku to battle their own people in an attempt to free the nether dragons from the control of Ragnok, who was leading an attack on the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;. He eventually placed himself in front of Tyrygosa to protect her from an attack by the enthralled nether dragons. His shield spell eventually faltered to their attacks, and he burned away."}

It was originally found to the northwest, north of the &lt;a href=\"Haldarr%20Encampment\"&gt;Haldarr Encampment&lt;/a&gt;. In \"Cataclysm\" the area was moved to the southwest. The original location was fairly unprotected and bare, as the Horde had initial little interest in this hostile territory, though the new outpost was reinforced by the time of the return of &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nOld Valormok was a small outpost found in northwestern Azshara. The warriors there experienced difficult times but were still hopeful. It was populated with many more orcs, but most were slain by the treacherous &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Magus%20Rimtori\"&gt;Magus Rimtori&lt;/a&gt;, who was sent with warriors by &lt;a href=\"Belgrom%20Rockmaul\"&gt;Belgrom Rockmaul&lt;/a&gt; to find riches and powerful artifacts. Instead, Rimtori ended up killing the Horde warriors and taking what she found for herself. The leader of the camp, &lt;a href=\"Ag%27tor%20Bloodfist\"&gt;Ag'tor Bloodfist&lt;/a&gt;, sent adventurers out to avenge both his warriors and Rockmaul's pride. They made war upon the nearby &lt;a href=\"Thalassian%20Base%20Camp\"&gt;Thalassian Base Camp&lt;/a&gt;, slaughtering the elves there and eventually killing Magus Rimtori. &lt;a href=\"Jediga\"&gt;Jediga&lt;/a&gt; was also sent here by Rockmaul as a punishment, though she made the most of this by instructing adventurers to try and find ancient Highborne tablets to sell to interested parties in the area to get out of Azshara.\nCataclysm.\nAt some point, &lt;a href=\"Gaur%20Icehorn\"&gt;Gaur Icehorn&lt;/a&gt; a traitor to his tribe, was caught stealing supplies from Valormok. Almost executed, &lt;a href=\"Spiketooth\"&gt;Spiketooth&lt;/a&gt; witnessed this and bought Gaur as a gladiator.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Cartel\"&gt;Bilgewater Cartel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s brought changes to Azshara, the outpost was moved far to the south, built among ancient &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; ruins. Most of Valormok's original inhabitants are gone, having returned to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; or accompanied Ag'tor to the new rear gate of Orgrimmar, to the point the only original inhabitant is &lt;a href=\"Kroum\"&gt;Kroum&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Chawg\"&gt;Chawg&lt;/a&gt; appears to have taken command of the camp in Ag'tor's absence and makes use of their new goblin allies. The new camp hosts several barricades, a goblin bomb wagon, and a new fire pit, as well as a legion of grunts to defend it.\nThe Horde has plans to invade &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt; and the only way to gain support from Orgrimmar is to clear a path through &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt;, seeing that the only way to do this is to drive out the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Talrendis%20Point\"&gt;Talrendis Point&lt;/a&gt; by bombarding the towers on their &lt;a href=\"wyvern\"&gt;wyvern&lt;/a&gt;s and eliminate the resistance. This of course didn't go unnoticed and the night elves retaliated on Valormok.\nLegion.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Invasions\"&gt;Legion Invasions&lt;/a&gt;, Valormok was defended by its residents.\nAfter the Fourth War.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, when &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Calia%20Menethil\"&gt;Calia Menethil&lt;/a&gt; flew from &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; to Valormok on &lt;a href=\"wyvern\"&gt;wyvern&lt;/a&gt;s. Once they arrived here, they changed their mounts to &lt;a href=\"hippogryph\"&gt;hippogryph&lt;/a&gt;s and continued to &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlthough this important staging ground has a lot of goblin explosives present, &lt;a href=\"Zekhan\"&gt;Zekhan&lt;/a&gt; plans to ask the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Council\"&gt;Horde Council&lt;/a&gt; to send help, as night elf defenders from Talrendis Point challenge the Horde for control. He fears they might succeed.\nIn the RPG.\nCamp Valormok is a small encampment with a population of 250. Is the staging point for most of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; forces in the area, and it consists of little more than a gathering of a few tents and crude walls. Still, it is better than the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; holdings, who have nothing more than a landing pad, and a couple of &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; standing around here and there."}

However, unlike the gossip about &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;'s love for the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, these rumors are likely true - though there is some doubt amongst certain scholars.\nIn his youth, during military movements in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, Proudmoore had several polite encounters with the high elf &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer\"&gt;sorceress&lt;/a&gt; Kilnar Goldensword. Those polite encounters led to a handful of discreet liaisons that inevitably brought Finnall into the world. Proudmoore had been married by that time, and Kilnar had agreed to keep the father of her baby a secret.\nKilnar was a well-respected high elf, and because of this Finnall received better treatment than most of her kind. Her mother, raised among the high elves in the wizard city of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, told her of her father's identity when she became fully grown. Having met Proudmoore several times and greatly admiring him, she decided to follow the path of her father instead of her mother and become a warrior.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; came to Dalaran, Finnall was unable to stop their destruction of her home or the murder of her mother by &lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; himself. She resolved to remain in Lordaeron and rid the continent of the Scourge, a mighty task indeed. Most of the high elves who remained after the battle embraced their magical &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; ancestry and became the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;; they would not stoop to follow a &lt;a href=\"half-elf\"&gt;half-elf&lt;/a&gt;. The humans who remained on the continent would not believe her when she claimed Proudmoore as her father.\nProudmoore attempted to convince Finnall to travel with him to &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt; to attack &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;, but she refused, claiming his place was with her to free Lordaeron from the Scourge. He tried to convince her that the continent was lost to the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;, but she rejected his reasoning and considered him a traitor to his homeland.\nWith her mother dead and father departed for easier battles (in her opinion), Finnall remains with her small band of humans and those high elves who rejected the path of the blood elves. Using guerrilla tactics, she picks off a Scourge encampment here or a caravan there. She is a strong warrior, and thinks of nothing but her goal of freeing her homeland.\nAny half-elf who encounters Finnall may wish to join with her. Fighting alongside a member of their race with such strength of body and character - who doesn't have any hang-ups concerning where she came from - is a dream come true for some half-elves.\n&lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;'s account.\nOne interesting tale I've heard is of a half-elf named Finall Goldensword. This woman is the daughter of the high elf mage Kilnar Goldensword of Dalaran and an unknown human (rumor says it was Daelin Proudmoore, though few humans believe the tale). When Dalaran and her mother fell to the Scourge, Finall tried to unite the surviving humans and high elves around her. Unfortunately, the humans mistrusted her and the disdainful high elves refused to follow a half-breed. Stung but not dissuaded, Finall refused to give up; she calculated that success would bring more people to her banner than her bloodline ever could, and has fought a guerilla war against the Scourge ever since.\nChris Metzen on Finnall.\nAt New York Comic Con 2009, &lt;a href=\"Chris%20Metzen\"&gt;Chris Metzen&lt;/a&gt; stated the following about Finnall:\nIn a subsequent interview at &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon\"&gt;BlizzCon&lt;/a&gt; 2011:\nIn 2018, after the canonization of &lt;a href=\"Tandred%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Tandred Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sean%20Copeland\"&gt;Sean Copeland&lt;/a&gt; stated that he still considered Finnall to be non-canonical in adherence to Metzen's original ruling."}

Take them away from him, then, and turn them to our own use!\nThis quest is part of the quest chain.\nObjectives.\nUse the Naturalized Ammunition to take control of the Death's Door Fel Cannons. Use them to destroy both the South Warp-Gate and the North Warp-Gate. Then, use the &lt;a href=\"Druid%20Signal\"&gt;Druid Signal&lt;/a&gt; to call out to an &lt;a href=\"Evergrove%20Druid\"&gt;Evergrove Druid&lt;/a&gt; to report your success.\nDescription.\nNow that the ammunition can affect the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, it's time for you to use it.\nThere are two warp-gates, which are used for teleportation and enhancement of the &lt;a href=\"void%20terror\"&gt;void terror&lt;/a&gt;s. One is in the south and the other in the north, and each is within range of a fel cannon.\nUse the naturalized ammunition to take control of each fel cannon and destroy the warp-gates.\nAttack the gate with artillery to begin, and be prepared to kill its defenders to keep the cannon alive if necessary.\nRewards.\nYou will receive:\nProgress.\nHave you destroyed both of the warp-gates yet?\nCompletion.\nYour prowess is staggering!\nVery well, with the warp-gates out of the picture, there's only one thing left to do.\nNotes.\nYou might have learned about destroying the Forge Camp equipment during some &lt;a href=\"Nagrand%20Forge%20Camp%20quest%20chain\"&gt;missions&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis is really a \"friend or two recommended\" quest...\nWhen you \"use\" the Naturalized Ammunition, you gain the cannon as a stationary pet, complete with pet bar. On that bar are two special abilities: Fire on the Warp Gate, and Flame Thrower. Both are\non the same timer, so any use of one prevents you from doing the other until the cooling time (about 15 seconds) is over. A pet-using class such as hunters and warlocks (and to a lesser extent, mages and druids) should note that using the cannon, it becoming a pet, will dismiss your permanent pet until you summon them back afterwards.\nIt takes 7 shots to destroy a warp gate. The moment you start firing, a series of suicide imps start emerging from the gate. They explode for perhaps 600 points each, and appear in a fairly steady stream (perhaps 2 seconds apart). Five or six of these blowing up next to your cannon will destroy it, so you must intercept them short of the cannon. They have about 500-600 HP, and will explode next to you if you aggro them. Their explosion replaces their melee attack, but does not happen when they die. This can be completed solo, and is easier for some classes than others. Rogues, for instance have the hardest time with this quest.\nThe key to victory is to stand n the way of the imps and use a low-mana instant cast spell to kill them. Another idea is to aoe them down, and depending on the range of your aoe, this may or may not be a good idea. The bigger the aoe, the better an idea it is.\nMeanwhile, some time during the process, a corehound look-alike dog wanders near the gate, becomes \"unbanished\", and attacks you. A standard mob, but he'll distract you while you are fending off the line of imps. Thus the \"friend recommended\".\nIf you're a melee class, this quest is piece of cake. Simply walk slightly backwards as you hit an imp, and they won't hit you at all. If you're a warrior, the key to victory is &lt;a href=\"Victory%20Rush\"&gt;Victory Rush&lt;/a&gt;."}
