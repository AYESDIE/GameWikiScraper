Originally loyal to &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magistrix%20Elisande\"&gt;Grand Magistrix Elisande&lt;/a&gt;, Victoire and many other members of the Duskwatch would ultimately defect to the side of the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Nightfallen&lt;/a&gt; later in the conflict. In the aftermath of the insurrection and Elisande's eventual defeat, Victoire was appointed First Blade of the Duskwatch under the new regime of &lt;a href=\"First%20Arcanist%20Thalyssra\"&gt;First Arcanist Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nNightfallen rebellion.\nVictoire was originally a member of the &lt;a href=\"Duskwatch\"&gt;Duskwatch&lt;/a&gt;, the force responsible for the maintenance of security and order in &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar City&lt;/a&gt; during its 10,000-year isolation. With the arrival of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, Suramar's leader &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magistrix%20Elisande\"&gt;Grand Magistrix Elisande&lt;/a&gt; chose to ally herself with the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s to save her people, a decision strongly resented by much of the &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt; populace. Victoire and the Duskwatch, loyal to Elisande, quickly became preoccupied with putting down &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20%28faction%29\"&gt;a rebel movement&lt;/a&gt; that sought the overthrow of Elisande and the Legion's expulsion.\nAs the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20rebellion\"&gt;Nightfallen rebellion&lt;/a&gt; continued to rage throughout Suramar, Elisande issued increasingly callous orders to the Duskwatch and her forces, largely aimed at terrorizing, starving, or otherwise forcing the citizenry to stay in line. Despite this, the Duskwatch remained steadfastly loyal to the Grand Magistrix, though many harbored reservations about the methods being employed.\nThe Nightfallen rebels continued to gain significant ground, and in response Elisande would order a wholesale massacre of the residents of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Waning%20Crescent\"&gt;Waning Crescent&lt;/a&gt; district, an area of known dissident activity. Victoire and numerous other previously-staunch supporters of the Gand Magistrix were horrified and disgusted by the slaughter, which served to finally drive many members of the Duskwatch to desertion. Victoire made contact with Nightfallen elements in the forms of &lt;a href=\"Silgryn\"&gt;Silgryn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arluelle\"&gt;Arluelle&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champion&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"First%20Arcanist%20Thalyssra\"&gt;First Arcanist Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt;, and explained her desire to switch sides and join the resistance.\nWith Victoire's help, the Nightfallen went on to identify many other members of the Duskwatch seeking to abandon Elisande's cause, and successfully urged them to desert their posts. Later, Victoire would join Silgryn and Arluelle on a mission to free citizens captured by Elisande's demon allies and transported to &lt;a href=\"Felsoul%20Advance\"&gt;Felsoul Advance&lt;/a&gt; for ritual sacrifice. Together, the Nightfallen agents managed to temporarily disable the operation and slay the Legion commander &lt;a href=\"Aargoss\"&gt;Aargoss&lt;/a&gt;. Victoire would also aid in the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Thoramir\"&gt;Thoramir&lt;/a&gt; and the raid to rescue &lt;a href=\"Vanthir\"&gt;Vanthir&lt;/a&gt; from captivity on the &lt;a href=\"Terrace%20of%20Order\"&gt;Terrace of Order&lt;/a&gt;.\nEventually, the Nightfallen gained enough of an upper to hand to lay siege to Suramar City itself, alongside their new &lt;a href=\"elven\"&gt;elven&lt;/a&gt; allies. In the main camp outside the city limits, Victoire was placed chiefly in charge of training the ragtag multitude of civilian rebels into a fighting force. Though she considered the job to be almost hopeless, she continued her efforts in preparation for an assault on the city, sending many of the fighters to &lt;a href=\"Black%20Rook%20Hold\"&gt;Black Rook Hold&lt;/a&gt; in neighbouring &lt;a href=\"Val%27sharah\"&gt;Val'sharah&lt;/a&gt; to gain experience against the resident spirits.\nNew regime.\nAt the end of the civil war, &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magistrix%20Elisande\"&gt;Grand Magistrix Elisande&lt;/a&gt; was defeated in an assault on the &lt;a href=\"Nighthold\"&gt;Nighthold&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; driven from &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"First%20Arcanist%20Thalyssra\"&gt;First Arcanist Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt;, as leader of the rebellion, would subsequently establish a new regime in the city, with the &lt;a href=\"Duskwatch\"&gt;Duskwatch&lt;/a&gt; remaining as the main security force. Victoire was appointed First Blade and leader of the Duskwatch for her service during the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20rebellion\"&gt;Nightfallen rebellion&lt;/a&gt;."}

{"id": "13212", "revid": "53725487", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=13212", "title": "Threat", "text": "Threat is a measure of an NPC's aggression towards a player. Each NPC has a threat table, and a unit toward the top of the list is usually the target of its aggression. In-game, this is known as having &lt;a href=\"aggro\"&gt;aggro&lt;/a&gt; from that particular NPC. The NPC will attack that character if possible, unless something overrides the NPC's target.\nMechanics.\nEvery unit is added to the threat table upon begining combat, and removed at the end of combat. Threat is a positive number beginning at zero upon entry to the table. (Leaving and re-entering combat starts at zero again.) Each NPC tracks opponents using their own threat table.\nThe following actions accumulate threat while combat continues:\nThe NPC &lt;a href=\"aggro\"&gt;aggro&lt;/a&gt;s to a new unit if that unit:\nModifying threat.\nSome abilities accelerate the rate of threat generation:\nMany roles also have abilities to reposition themselves within the threat table:\nFinally, many &lt;a href=\"encounter\"&gt;encounter&lt;/a&gt;s and other NPCs have abilities which modify their threat table in unique ways.\nDetailed values.\nWhen expanded, the following tables list currently-known modifiers for threat abilities:\nHistory.\nThreat management dominated gameplay during \"Classic\" and \"The Burning Crusade\", as well-geared &lt;a href=\"DPS\"&gt;DPS&lt;/a&gt; could potentially accumulate threat faster than a dedicated &lt;a href=\"tank\"&gt;tank&lt;/a&gt; who had limited options to gain it faster. This compelled other players to slow their combat and use abilities to lower their threat beneath the tank. In subsequent expansions, tanks received increasing passive boosts to threat generation -- becoming a five-fold multiplier by \"Cataclysm\" -- rendering threat relatively unimportant to modern gameplay: now a tank either has aggro or doesn't, but they can easily maintain it once they do.\nUntil \"Wrath of the Lich King\", threat was a hidden variable reverse engineered by the community and tracked using &lt;a href=\"AddOn\"&gt;AddOn&lt;/a&gt;s which predicted threat accumulation through trial and error. These addons worked by tracking a player's status and actions, and then communicating through AddOn communication channels so other players with a matching AddOn could predict their relative position on the threat table. &lt;a href=\"Patch%203.0.2\"&gt;Patch 3.0.2&lt;/a&gt; added new making threat transparent, allowing AddOns to perform this function without any special communication or synchronization.\nThe most successful addon of this kind was \"Omen\" by Xinhuan, Nevcairiel, \"et al.\" with 17 million downloads at &lt;a href=\"Curse\"&gt;Curse&lt;/a&gt; and 4 million at &lt;a href=\"WoWInterface\"&gt;WoWInterface&lt;/a&gt;. At the latter, it remains the most-downloaded \"Combat Mod\". Prior to patch 3.0.2, Omen also used the \"Threat-2.0\" library to predict and communicate threat levels with players using other AddOns."}

Plus, the return of &lt;a href=\"Rehgar%20Earthfury\"&gt;Rehgar Earthfury&lt;/a&gt;!\nPlot.\nIn Theramore, &lt;a href=\"Valeera%20Sanguinar\"&gt;Valeera&lt;/a&gt; runs into &lt;a href=\"Broll%20Bearmantle\"&gt;Broll&lt;/a&gt;'s room after she hears him crying out in his sleep and unsuccessfully tries to wake him up. In his sleep, Broll sees himself as a &lt;a href=\"storm%20crow\"&gt;storm crow&lt;/a&gt; flying near &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;, to which he has been summoned; not the physical &lt;a href=\"World%20Tree\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt; containing &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;, but its manifestation in another reality. The air itself seems to be tainted by evil, but he manages to find &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt;, who summons Broll to Darnassus with the message that Teldrassil is in peril and that some have become trapped in the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Dream&lt;/a&gt;. Broll suddenly wakes up when Valeera throws water in his face out of fear that he has become trapped in the Emerald Dream. He informs her that he needs to return home and that she can't come with him due to being a &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elf&lt;/a&gt; and because she would just be bored by attending a &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;ic gathering. Instead, she should remain with Varian and &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin&lt;/a&gt; in Theramore, as something tells Broll that Anduin may have need of her.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt;, Garona is held in chains by &lt;a href=\"Stasia%20Fallshadow\"&gt;Stasia&lt;/a&gt; and other members of the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;. She asks where &lt;a href=\"Med%27an\"&gt;Med'an&lt;/a&gt; is, but Stasia replies that they just used the boy as bait to capture Garona. The group enters the huge chamber containing the corpse of &lt;a href=\"C%27Thun\"&gt;C'Thun&lt;/a&gt; and come face to face with the Twilight's Hammer's master, &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt;. Through a crystal ball, a &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; spy informs the &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt; of the upcoming &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; peace summit at Theramore. Stasia tells her master that Garona is as deadly as her reputation, having killed most of the Twilight's Hammer company in &lt;a href=\"Duskwood\"&gt;Duskwood&lt;/a&gt; before Stasia intervened and used a control word to paralyze her. Garona begins asking about Cho'gall's motives, but the ogre simply replies that her son Med'an is the focus of an ancient prophecy and that the Twilight cult will focus his great power for their own ends; for now, however, Garona is more valuable as she will pave the way for Med'an's \"ascension\".\nIn Theramore, Broll says farewell to Varian, Valeera, Anduin, and &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina&lt;/a&gt; as he leaves for Teldrassil. Valeera is upset by his departure as she gets the feeling that he's heading into something dangerous and may not return, but Varian assures her that Broll is too tough to kill.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rehgar%20Earthfury\"&gt;Rehgar&lt;/a&gt; tells Thrall that he doesn't like the idea of bringing &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh&lt;/a&gt; with them to the summit. Thrall points out that &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh's father&lt;/a&gt; freed the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s from the &lt;a href=\"blood-curse\"&gt;blood-curse&lt;/a&gt;, but Rehgar reminds him that Grommash was also the first to drink &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt;'s blood in the first place. He further argues that Garrosh should have stayed on &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, to which Thrall shoots back that Garrosh thinks Rehgar should have stayed a gladiator master. Rehgar doesn't disagree as he considers himself a poor diplomat. Thrall argues that Garrosh is not his enemy just because his vision for the orcs differs from Thrall's own. Garrosh arrives and states that he'll be attending the summit to protect the interests of the orc people \u2014 whom he believes should control all of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 and because he's curious to see the \"impregnable fortress\" of Theramore. As Rehgar and Thrall board the &lt;a href=\"zeppelin\"&gt;zeppelin&lt;/a&gt; to Theramore, Thrall mentions that the strength of Jaina's ramparts may cause Garrosh to rethink his attitude.\nIn Ahn'Qiraj, Garona breaks free of the chains binding her to the floor and begins fighting her captors until Cho'gall uses the word to regain control of her. He instructs her that she will follow Stasia's orders as if they were his own and orders her to assassinate King Varian, with secondary targets in the form of Anduin and Thrall. He continues telling Garona that as soon as she leaves Ahn'Qiraj with Stasia and her squadron, she will forget the existence of both Ahn'Qiraj and the ogre and believe that she is performing her tasks out of free will. While Garona prepares to leave, Cho'gall turns to Stasia and explains that the Horde members of her group will attack the Alliance at the summit and vice versa. Thus, if the attack fails, the Alliance and Horde will blame each other and soon devolve into open war. Cho'gall continues that while he has put blocks on Garona's memory, such blocks can be broken with time, and thus Stasia must ensure that Garona dies one way or another after her task is done.\nIn Theramore, &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt; talks to Valeera about the departure of Broll, who has been a teacher, friend, brother, and father figure to the blood elf. Aegwynn tells Valeera that she once knew her ancestor &lt;a href=\"Relfthra\"&gt;Relfthra&lt;/a&gt;, a member of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Council of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt;. Valeera confides that she found some records of the order when she was little and wanted to grow up to be just like Relfthra, but she doesn't have his gift. The chamberlain assures the blood elf that she has her own talents, as well as her own burdens and dangers. Valeera replies that Aegwynn doesn't need to worry as she has learned the cost of dark magic after her &lt;a href=\"Kathra%27natir\"&gt;demonic possession&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Brightwood%20Grove\"&gt;Brightwood Grove&lt;/a&gt;, Med'an returns from a &lt;a href=\"boar\"&gt;boar&lt;/a&gt; hunt, which was mostly an excuse to wander the forest and search for the orc woman who rescued him and &lt;a href=\"Meryl%20Felstorm\"&gt;Meryl&lt;/a&gt;. After killing an attacking &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt;, Med'an continues to Meryl's hut and wonders what the woman could have to do with his mentor, who was born and died centuries before orcs arrived on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Med'an stops and hides a short distance away from the hut when he sees the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Koron\"&gt;Koron&lt;/a&gt; arriving on a &lt;a href=\"Snubnose\"&gt;bat mount&lt;/a&gt;, and asks the wind to let him hear Koron and Meryl's conversation. The newcomer tells Meryl that Cho'gall is alive despite rumors otherwise and has captured Meryl's \"quarry\" to send her on an assassination mission to Theramore, likely resulting in her certain death. Koron finishes by stating that his debt to Meryl is now repaid and he will spy for him no longer, since he doesn't want to risk the &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Dark Lady&lt;/a&gt;'s wrath should she find out. Med'an is shocked to learn that the orc who protected him is his mother. He quickly steals Koron's bat and flies off, hoping to reach Theramore and save Garona. When Meryl notices this, he exclaims \"Damnation!\" and says that he has long feared the boy would do something foolhardy if he learned the truth about his parentage.\nA rainstorm envelops Theramore as Jaina, Aegwynn, Valeera, Anduin, and Varian await Thrall's arrival. Aegwynn recounts Thrall's history to Valeera, while Varian confides to Anduin that he is anxious to return to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; and that it goes against his instinct to meet any orc unarmed, even one like Thrall. Not long after, Thrall, Garrosh, and Rehgar's zeppelin arrives. Thrall recounts to Rehgar how he and Jaina became friends, and Rehgar muses that Jaina is welcome to keep Theramore as the damp climate makes his old bones creak. Garrosh, however, points out that the area is rich in timber and stone; things that the orcs need.\nHigh above the clouds, Stasia, the Twilight's Hammer cultists, and the ensorcelled Garona look down on Theramore from atop &lt;a href=\"bat\"&gt;bat&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"wyvern\"&gt;wyvern&lt;/a&gt; mounts. Stasia and Garona bicker, with the latter complaining about how it's impossible to see anything due to the storm conjured by the former's spellcasters. Stasia tells Garona to begin the attack. As the half-orc drops below the clouds, she internally wonders why she agreed to the attack and remarks that it's like the assassination of &lt;a href=\"Llane%20Wrynn%20I\"&gt;King Llane&lt;/a&gt; all over again."}

The &lt;a href=\"Anglepoint%20Packing%20District\"&gt;Anglepoint Packing District&lt;/a&gt; processes them into food.\nIn the RPG.\n\"The huge, reptilian beast lumbers awkwardly on four squat legs. Its muscular neck is long and flexible, capped by a relatively small head decorated by a colorful fin. Its mouth is filled with long, rounded teeth that appear designed for chewing plants but seem equally capable of crushing armor and snapping bone.\"\nThe threshadon are &lt;a href=\"dinosaur\"&gt;dinosaur&lt;/a&gt;s.\nDescription.\nThreshadon are amphibious herbivores that typically live in freshwater lakes or marshes. Their long, flexible necks enable them to eat leaves off the tops of trees and to nuzzle down into muddy lake floors for algae and lichen. They tend to be passive creatures, preferring to graze unmoving in one spot until they are forced to seek additional sources of food elsewhere. Threshadon usually stand in medium-depth water, with the tops of their backs exposed to the heat of the sun and their long necks free to graze. When threatened, they often retreat to deeper water for protection.\nThreshadon are primarily motivated by hunger. Their huge bodies require almost constant nourishment, so they migrate frequently whenever they exhaust all edible plant life in an area. They travel in loose herds that are led by a dominant male. When grazing sites are found, the beasts scatter out in a vast circle with pairs grazing together for protection.\nTheir most dangerous natural enemies are &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt;s. Twice a year, murloc tribes engage in ceremonial hunts, prowling lakes and streams for threshadon. Murlocs prize the threshadon's back fins as material for crude shields and armor and extract a greenish mucus from the colored head fin for use by chieftains as a powerful aphrodisiac.\nThough an herbivore, a threshadon aggressively defends its territory. It attacks anything it notices. The creature is strong, fast and highly maneuverable in water, able to turn quickly and lunge at prey with its long neck. They will not hesitate to eat meat, as &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s fear them.\nInspiration.\nThe threshadon resembles a , a clade consisting of long-necked plesiosaurs that lived in the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods."}

He has a horn on his forehead and his right hand is missing and uses its stump for various weapons. &lt;a href=\"Malus\"&gt;Malus&lt;/a&gt; considers him to be the most loyal of the group.\nHistory.\nShattered Hand.\nSeveral years before the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, when Throgg was young, the ogre &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Mahrook%20clan\"&gt;Mahrook clan&lt;/a&gt; participated in battles against the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. In one such a battle, the Alliance cornered the Mahrook to a canyon. Although the ogre clan fought and killed &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarven&lt;/a&gt; soldiers, the Alliance eventually bested them and slaughtered them all, leaving only Throgg last standing. He even continued to fight when arrows hit his body, pulling them and stabbing enemies. He knew that he would die that moment, but suddenly the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Hand%20clan\"&gt;Shattered Hand clan&lt;/a&gt; entered the canyon and attacked the Alliance from behind. When the Alliance turned away from Throgg to attack the orcs, Throgg continued killing them. The ogre and the orc clan eventually defeated the Alliance.\nA Shattered Hand warrior named &lt;a href=\"Teremok\"&gt;Teremok&lt;/a&gt; offered him to join the orc clan. Both seeing themselves as great warriors, and with the Mahrook ogres being defeated, Throgg joined the Shattered Hand. The deal was sealed when Teremok cut Throgg's hand. Throgg actually didn't miss his hand much as the &lt;a href=\"blacksmith\"&gt;blacksmith&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ulmok\"&gt;Ulmok&lt;/a&gt; offered him a variety of weapons to use. Throgg then joined more attacks against the Alliance with the Shattered Hand, but his friends and brothers, Ulmok and Teremok, were eventually killed during the battles. He missed both of them because the other orcs were not his friends and didn't treat him well.\nEventually, the Shattered Hand worked with the group called the &lt;a href=\"Hidden\"&gt;Hidden&lt;/a&gt; to find &lt;a href=\"Greydon%20Thorne\"&gt;Greydon Thorne&lt;/a&gt; and his compass. It was then that he noticed &lt;a href=\"Malus\"&gt;Malus&lt;/a&gt; and Malus noticed him. When Malus was about to leave, he asked Throgg to come with him. The ogre refused, as he swore an oath to the Shattered Hand. Malus then approached &lt;a href=\"Garamok\"&gt;Garamok&lt;/a&gt; who said that no ogre can be a true Shattered Hand but that they want him for carrying supplies. Malus thus offered Garamok 30 silvers who took them and released Throgg from the oath. Throgg was furious at words of Garamok and considered he has no ogre or orc brothers so he swore an oath to his new brother Malus and to the Hidden.\nTraveler.\nHe assisted Captain Malus in an attack of the \"&lt;a href=\"Wavestrider\"&gt;Wavestrider&lt;/a&gt;\", killing &lt;a href=\"Cassius%20Meeks\"&gt;Cassius Meeks&lt;/a&gt; and destroying its mainmast. He then accompanied the group into &lt;a href=\"Feralas\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt; in search of &lt;a href=\"Aramar%20Thorne\"&gt;Aramar Thorne&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Makasa%20Flintwill\"&gt;Makasa Flintwill&lt;/a&gt;. The group tracked them and Throgg went with &lt;a href=\"Reigol%20Valdread\"&gt;Reigol Valdread&lt;/a&gt; to make the two youngsters a deal - captured &lt;a href=\"Murky%20%28Traveler%29\"&gt;Murky&lt;/a&gt; for Aram's compass. The two along with the &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thalyss%20Greyoak\"&gt;Thalyss Greyoak&lt;/a&gt; shattered Reigol's body so the ogre picked the pieces and handed them to the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;. Malus ordered Throgg as the deal was unsuccessful but as the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; learned the cause - Aram being captured by the &lt;a href=\"Gordunni%20clan\"&gt;Gordunni clan&lt;/a&gt; and brought to &lt;a href=\"Dire%20Maul\"&gt;Dire Maul&lt;/a&gt; - he stopped the hungry Throgg and ordered to bring the &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt; with them as the Hidden entered the ruined city.\nAs Malus approached &lt;a href=\"King%20Gordok\"&gt;King Gordok&lt;/a&gt;, he challenged the leader to a &lt;a href=\"mak%27gora\"&gt;mak'gora&lt;/a&gt;. The king refused, stating that only ogres can challenge, so Malus beckoned to Throgg who challenged the king. Gordok eventually accepted, yet Malus offered himself to fight as Throgg's champion. Malus killed Gordok, but Aram and his companions escaped. An ogre named &lt;a href=\"Kor%27lok%20%28Traveler%29\"&gt;Kor'lok&lt;/a&gt; then challenged Malus for leadership, acknowledging the human as King Gordok. Malus, however, appointed Throgg to fight in his stead and the one-handed ogre immediately killed Kor'lok.\nDuring these final events, Throgg was described as not being very happy with so many ogre deaths and perverting ogre laws."}

What he found was illuminating: the titanic watcher &lt;a href=\"Ra-den\"&gt;Ra-den&lt;/a&gt;, who stood guard over a powerful &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; device, the &lt;a href=\"Engine%20of%20Nalak%27sha\"&gt;Engine of Nalak'sha&lt;/a&gt;. Lei Shen claimed dominion over both. It is said that he tore out the very heart of the &lt;a href=\"Ra-den\"&gt;mogu god&lt;/a&gt;. And from that hateful act, he gained power over wind and storm.\nLei Shen, now calling himself the \"Thunder King\", declared the Thundering Mountain to be his seat of power and atop its summit he built a majestic and forbidden city. Following the Thunder King's death, the new emperor, &lt;a href=\"Dojan%20Firecrown\"&gt;Dojan Firecrown&lt;/a&gt;, moved the capital of the &lt;a href=\"Mogu%20empire\"&gt;empire&lt;/a&gt; from the barren Throne of Thunder to &lt;a href=\"Mogu%27shan%20Palace\"&gt;Mogu'shan Palace&lt;/a&gt; in the fertile &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt;.\nDungeon Journal.\n\"When Pandaria separated from Kalimdor many thousands of years ago, a veil of mist kept outsiders from discovering the newly-formed continent. The mists also hid a reminder of an ancient evil: Lei Shen's Throne of Thunder. During his rule, this fortress was the seat of the Thunder King's power. Even after his death, great swathes of corrupted energy lingered, and now, the resurrected Thunder King and the Zandalari trolls intend to harness that energy to establish the reign of Lei Shen once again.\"\nEncounters.\n\"The forces of the Zandalari have rallied in the ruins surrounding the Thunder King's island citadel.\"\n\"Beneath the foundations of the Throne of Thunder lie vast caverns, teeming with ancient horrors.\"\n\"In the horrific chambers beneath Lei Shen's citadel, the mogu conducted terrible experiments into reshaping life.\"\n\"From within his inner sanctum, the risen Thunder King plots the return of the great mogu empire.\"\nGetting there.\nFirst get to the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Isle of Thunder&lt;/a&gt; by taking a portal from the faction camps outside &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan%20Garrison\"&gt;Shado-Pan Garrison&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Townlong%20Steppes\"&gt;Townlong Steppes&lt;/a&gt;. The Alliance camp is at to the north, and the Horde camp is at to the southeast.

Formed from the head of &lt;a href=\"Grond\"&gt;Grond&lt;/a&gt;, the Throne was the location where the first &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;ish &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; learned to wield the power of the elements. Besides the furies, the Throne currently houses a handful of members of the &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe first shaman.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Grond\"&gt;Grond&lt;/a&gt; was killed by the &lt;a href=\"Sporemound\"&gt;Sporemound&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Botaan\"&gt;Botaan&lt;/a&gt;, the bulk of his corpse formed a mountain range at the edge of the region later called &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt;. Much of the stony debris that fell from the stone giant contained the primordial elements of fire, air, earth and water, and these energies gradually coalesced into pools of power from which &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt; spirits took shape for the first time in &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;'s history. The spirits were initially few in number, but their population exploded after Grond's defeat. The &lt;a href=\"Furies\"&gt;Furies&lt;/a&gt;, the four most powerful elementals on Draenor, dwelled near the remains of Grond's head. They lamented Grond's death and vowed to live in his corpse's shadow forever.\nThousands of years later, mystics from the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;ish &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20clan\"&gt;Shadowmoon clan&lt;/a&gt; frequently ventured across the world on pilgrimages, hoping to hear the will of the divine. Many of these travelers received strange dreams and visions near the mountains of northwestern Nagrand. The first Shadowmoon visitors to the location learned about the world's primordial spirits of fire, air, earth, and water. They treated these beings with the utmost respect and named the site of their discovery the \"Throne of the Elements\". The orcs flocked to Grond's remains and learned to guide the elemental spirits with a sense of harmony, and in return received astonishing powers unlike any seen by the orcs before. The Shadowmoon were the first to dedicate themselves to the elements and transformed Grond's head into a crude temple. They soon began spreading their teachings to the other clans, nearly all of which adopted the practice. Young orcs were raised to be steadfast allies of the elements, and fledgling shaman traveled to the Throne of the Elements to seek the spirits' blessing, entering trances to attune their minds to the elements. However, during this process &lt;a href=\"pale%20orc\"&gt;a few orcs&lt;/a&gt; glimpsed the realm of the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;, and what they saw drove them insane, leading them to being exiled from their clans and forced to live in seclusion in the caves beneath Nagrand. White skulls were tattooed on their faces, marking them as \"dead\" to their people. Those orcs who were welcomed by the elements returned to their clans as spiritual leaders whose counsel was highly valued.\nDomination of the elements.\nHundreds of years later, 400 years before the opening of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Gorian%20Empire\"&gt;Gorian Empire&lt;/a&gt; decided to take the power of the elements by force after witnessing the might of a powerful shaman first-hand. The ogre leader, &lt;a href=\"Imperator%20Molok\"&gt;Imperator Molok&lt;/a&gt;, sent an army to drive away the orcs from the Throne of the Elements and begin experimenting on the power there. The ogres eagerly and carelessly dissected the Throne with their &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; spellwork, ignorant to the mix of raw &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; and elemental power that lingered in Grond's remains. One day, the dissonance between the ogres' magic and Grond's residual energies ignited an explosion that blew apart the temple the orcs had carved from the giant's skull and killed every Gorian sorcerer inside the structure, leaving behind only a few standing stones that remain to this day. The incident threw the elements out of balance all across Draenor, causing great storms, but Molok simply sent more spellcasters to replace the ones that had been killed by the explosion.\nAt the next year's orcish &lt;a href=\"Kosh%27harg%20celebration\"&gt;Kosh'harg&lt;/a&gt; festival, the Shadowmoon elder shaman &lt;a href=\"Nelgarm\"&gt;Nelgarm&lt;/a&gt; pleaded for action, lest all of the clans suffer disastrous famines as a result of the elements' imbalance. The clans agreed to join together, and Nelgarm called upon the elements to bless them with their protection. The united orc army fell upon the Throne of the Elements. The Gorian sorcerers, utterly surprised by the attack, retreated with little bloodshed. However, Imperator Molok was quick to retaliate. The Gorian armies moved en masse, and total war engulfed Draenor, and now every orcish male, female and child had to be prepared to fight. The orcs gradually dismantled the ogres' land-based trade networks and pushed them back to their capital, &lt;a href=\"Goria\"&gt;Goria&lt;/a&gt;, marking the beginning of a lengthy siege. After the ogres began spreading the deadly &lt;a href=\"red%20pox\"&gt;red pox&lt;/a&gt; among the orcs, Nelgarm, and the other shaman were forced to beseech the elements to completely destroy Goria. Both parties understood that Molok would resume meddling with the Throne if the clans failed, and so Goria was ravaged by earthquakes and lightning storms over the course of hours before the earth itself wrenched open to swallow the remains of the city whole. The orcs, having suffered tremendous losses and being frightened by the elementals' wrath, went their separate ways and returned to their lands.\nBlighting of Draenor.\nCenturies later, a young orc named &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; was exiled from his clan for his physical deformity, which was seen as a bad omen. Only the clan's elder shaman took pity on him, telling him to seek out the Throne of the Elements and find his destiny. After struggling to survive in the wilds, Gul'dan journeyed to the throne and fell to his knees, offering himself up to whatever would end his torment. However, the elements sensed the darkness and fury in Gul'dan's heart and rejected him. Gul'dan was overwhelmed by sorrow, and in that moment, the demon lord &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; whispered to him, promising to grant the orc tremendous powers if he agreed to aid the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; in using the orcs as a weapon to destroy the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; race. Gul'dan agreed and was taught the ways of &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; magic, becoming the first orc &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;.\nFrom what Gul'dan told Kil'jaeden of Draenor's past, the demon learned of a time when the orcs had joined as one in response to the ogres' meddling with the Throne. If Kil'jaeden could re-create that elemental upheaval, perhaps the orc clans would repeat history. The demon lord guided Gul'dan, helping him inundate the Throne of the Elements with fel magic. The corruptive power began to weaken the world's native spirits, and the furies materialized to stop Gul'dan. However, they had never faced a warlock before, and the orc used his magic to drain the life from the furies, crippling and nearly destroying them before they were forced to flee. The fel magic threw the elements into disarray. As the seasons passed, long droughts were followed by heavy rain; floods devastated arid regions in &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Gorgrond&lt;/a&gt; and Nagrand; freak snowstorms covered portions of &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Tanaan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Terokkar%20Forest\"&gt;Terokkar&lt;/a&gt; in ice; and rivers and streams dried up, causing game like &lt;a href=\"clefthoof\"&gt;clefthoof&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"talbuk\"&gt;talbuk&lt;/a&gt; to die by the thousands. The orcs suffered immensely from disease and lack of food and water, and the shaman could offer no relief, for the tormented elemental spirits rarely communicated with the orcs anymore.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nIn the shattered realm of the &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, the Throne of the Elements still stands and is inhabited by members of the &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt; as well as the four &lt;a href=\"Furies\"&gt;Furies&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Elementalist%20Lo%27ap\"&gt;Elementalist Lo'ap&lt;/a&gt;, under the guidance of &lt;a href=\"Watoosun%20of%20the%20Water\"&gt;Watoosun of the Water&lt;/a&gt;, instructs &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to kill the destructive &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Spirit\"&gt;Lake Spirit&lt;/a&gt;s nearby and aids them with securing &lt;a href=\"Incineratus\"&gt;Incineratus&lt;/a&gt;' blessing. With the fiery essence of Incineratus himself granted to the adventurers, Lo'ap tasked his agents to set fire to &lt;a href=\"Windyreed%20Village\"&gt;Windyreed Village&lt;/a&gt;, whose inhabitants had agitated the water spirits in their efforts to create a marshland in &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, Watoosun cleansed the water spirits of their corruption; but in doing so, created a twisted spirit essence. Lo'ap sent adventurers to purge &lt;a href=\"Watoosun%27s%20Polluted%20Essence\"&gt;Watoosun's Polluted Essence&lt;/a&gt; and its offspring, the &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Surger\"&gt;Lake Surger&lt;/a&gt;s.\n&lt;a href=\"Gordawg\"&gt;Gordawg&lt;/a&gt; also directs adventurers to kill tainted &lt;a href=\"earth%20elemental\"&gt;earth elemental&lt;/a&gt;s and destroying the one responsible for their corruption: &lt;a href=\"Gurok%20the%20Usurper\"&gt;Gurok the Usurper&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Elementalist%20Morgh\"&gt;Elementalist Morgh&lt;/a&gt; also sent adventurers to slay &lt;a href=\"Murkblood%20Putrifier\"&gt;Murkblood Putrifier&lt;/a&gt;s, who have been using &lt;a href=\"dark%20shaman\"&gt;dark shaman&lt;/a&gt;ism to control air spirits.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"Children%27s%20Week\"&gt;Children's Week&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elf&lt;/a&gt; orphan &lt;a href=\"Salandria\"&gt;Salandria&lt;/a&gt; asks Horde adventurers to take her for a visit to the Throne, as she aspires to one day become a &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;, which would require knowledge about the elemental forces. During the visit, Salandria gets a little too close to Incineratus and gets zapped, but is not harmed. &lt;a href=\"Elementalist%20Sharvak\"&gt;Elementalist Sharvak&lt;/a&gt; tells the adventurer that it was foolhardy to bring a child to the Throne and that, as a blood elf, she's incapable of a deep connection to the world, but that perhaps her exposure to the elements will give her some insight into their workings.\nThe Shattering: Prelude to Cataclysm.\nShortly before the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; journeyed to Nagrand in an attempt to discover the source of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s current ailments. Upon his arrival, he met with his grandmother, &lt;a href=\"Greatmother%20Geyah\"&gt;Geyah&lt;/a&gt;, who advised him to turn to the &lt;a href=\"Mag%27har%20orc\"&gt;Mag'har&lt;/a&gt; female &lt;a href=\"Aggralan\"&gt;Aggralan&lt;/a&gt; for shamanic instruction. Despite a rough start, the two worked together and Aggra dutifully took Thrall on a vision quest in &lt;a href=\"Garadar\"&gt;Garadar&lt;/a&gt; in order for him to gain a true connection to the spirits and become a true shaman.\nLater, Thrall journeyed to the Throne to seek the counsel of the Furies, but only Gordawg was able to help him. After ingesting a small rock Thrall had brought with him from Azeroth, the Fury of Earth told the orc that Azeroth's elements were afraid of a coming shattering, a cataclysm akin to the one that had broken Draenor.\n&lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; also traveled here to witness the meeting.\nPrelude to Cataclysm.\nSince Phase 3 of the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Unrest\"&gt;Elemental Unrest&lt;/a&gt; event, the Throne of the Elements was the site of a meeting between &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Aggralan\"&gt;Aggra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gavan%20Grayfeather\"&gt;Gavan Grayfeather&lt;/a&gt;. Several &lt;a href=\"Disturbed%20Elements\"&gt;Disturbed Elements&lt;/a&gt; could be found roaming the area during this time. Every few minutes, &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Unrest%20meetings%23Phase%203.2C%20At%20the%20Throne%20of%20the%20Elements\"&gt;a conversation&lt;/a&gt; would occur."}

He now faces his greatest challenge as a force of serpentine naga and malefic faceless ones threaten to depose him, leaving his realm and its secrets ripe for the plundering.\"\nDescription.\nIt seems preposterous to think that even the armies of the naga would challenge a demigod on his home plane - and, yet, they are winning. Instead of cowering before &lt;a href=\"Neptulon\"&gt;Neptulon&lt;/a&gt;, the naga have brought forth a gigantic ally to hobble the Tidehunter...one who holds the entire Throne of the Tides in its grasp.

This &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt; realm is also inhabited by &lt;a href=\"Drust%23Variants\"&gt;strange fiends&lt;/a&gt;. The entrance to Thros is the great tree &lt;a href=\"Gol%20Inath\"&gt;Gol Inath&lt;/a&gt;. It can also be accessed through the island of &lt;a href=\"Fate%27s%20End\"&gt;Fate's End&lt;/a&gt; or through &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;al rituals.\nThros is on the precipice of a lot of confluences and has a connection to the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt; as well as to the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe ancient &lt;a href=\"Drust\"&gt;Drust&lt;/a&gt; used to live in harmony with &lt;a href=\"nature\"&gt;nature&lt;/a&gt;, their &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;ic ways preserving the balance of the wilds. When &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s started to settle &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; and the region of &lt;a href=\"Drustvar\"&gt;Drustvar&lt;/a&gt;, the Drust and their King Gorak Tul declared war on them. However, not all Drust agreed with this, and the &lt;a href=\"Thornspeakers\"&gt;Thornspeakers&lt;/a&gt; left Drust society.\nAs the war went on, the desperate Drust called onto dark powers. Unbeknownst to them, they had reached the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;. Their fallen warriors would find refuge in Thros, an offshoot of the Nightmare which they named differently as they were not aware of what the Nightmare was. Having run out of living warriors in his war, Gorak Tul began to bind his people's &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;s to stone constructs. Though the &lt;a href=\"House%20Waycrest\"&gt;Waycrests&lt;/a&gt; had wiped out the Drust, they did not succeed in killing Gorak Tul, who had escaped.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nGorak Tul, trapped within the Blighted Lands, bided his time, waiting for an opportunity to exact his revenge. After countless years, he recently corrupted the &lt;a href=\"House%20Waycrest\"&gt;House Waycrest&lt;/a&gt;, the seat of power of Drustvar, and &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Waycrest\"&gt;Lady Waycrest&lt;/a&gt; formed a group of &lt;a href=\"witch\"&gt;witch&lt;/a&gt;es known as the &lt;a href=\"Heartsbane%20Coven\"&gt;Heartsbane Coven&lt;/a&gt;. Gorak Tul and his new followers then feverishly conspired to release him from &lt;a href=\"prison\"&gt;prison&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Heartsbane conducted a ritual at the great tree, &lt;a href=\"Gol%20Inath\"&gt;Gol Inath&lt;/a&gt;. The spirit of the Drust were summoned in the physical world and were given bodies to inhabit through &lt;a href=\"wicker%20construct\"&gt;wicker construct&lt;/a&gt;s. They were however defeated by Inquisitors from the revived &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20Embers\"&gt;Order of Embers&lt;/a&gt;, and Gorak Tul was pushed back. Later, &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Waycrest\"&gt;Lady Waycrest&lt;/a&gt; provided herself the means to his return in &lt;a href=\"Waycrest%20Manor\"&gt;Waycrest Manor&lt;/a&gt;, which was built above ancient Drust ruins. Gorak Tul re-entered the physical world through the &lt;a href=\"Rupture%20%28Waycrest%20Manor%29\"&gt;Rupture&lt;/a&gt; under the manor, but he was pushed back once more, his spirit still residing within Thros.\nUnbeknownst to &lt;a href=\"Katherine%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Katherine Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, her daughter &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; had been sent off to the island of &lt;a href=\"Fate%27s%20End\"&gt;Fate's End&lt;/a&gt; as punishment, which none returned from due to being pulled into the Blighted Lands. Together with an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;Alliance emissary&lt;/a&gt;, Katherine later ventured into Thros, where &lt;a href=\"Ulfar\"&gt;Ulfar&lt;/a&gt; said Gorak Tul was most vulnerable. While in the realm, they came across five dead captives on the road; Katherine took this as evidence that the Drust were not interested in keeping their prisoners alive. They saved Jaina, and defeated Gorak Tul within his own realm, after which Jaina teleported everyone back into the physical world.\nShadowlands.\nThe Drust invade from Thros into &lt;a href=\"Ardenweald\"&gt;Ardenweald&lt;/a&gt;, part of the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;. They seek to use Ardenweald's power of rebirth to free themselves from Thros.\nSpeculation.\nGorak Tul perverted the druidic rituals of the Drust and set them upon the path of death and domination, wherein the term domination has been used in the context of the Maw. Thros has since been stated to be an intersection of the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ardenweald\"&gt;Ardenweald&lt;/a&gt;, but perhaps also connects to the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt;."}

When the sentry passes, it will fade. Continue following her down the hall, where you are spotted by an &lt;a href=\"Icebound%20Sentinel\"&gt;Icebound Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;. Assist Tarecgosa in defeating it. Keep moving to avoid its ice spike abilities. Be mindful of the &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Hunter\"&gt;Magic Hunter&lt;/a&gt;s that assist the sentinel.\nContinue following Tarecgosa down the hall. Be careful not to be killed by the steam vents. As you enter the Hall of Stasis, you will be confronted by another Icebound Sentinel. Help Tarecgosa defeat it, same drill as before. When the Sentinel falls, two more sentries enter the room.\nDown the corridor are &lt;a href=\"Imprisoned%20Wraith\"&gt;Imprisoned Wraith&lt;/a&gt;s. Chase the sentinel up the corridor into The Librarium, where you corner it in the room where you fought &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magus%20Telestra\"&gt;Grand Magus Telestra&lt;/a&gt;. When Tarecgosa enters the room, another sentinel appears. The two channel a spell that freezes Tarecgosa in her dragon form, unable to act. Any damage will distract them from channeling the spell, so kill the first sentinel by yourself, then attack the other one, gaining Tarecgosa's help in the process. Once the last sentinel falls, Tarecgosa heads out of the Librarium towards the Rift.\nYou will be attacked by &lt;a href=\"Ceredos\"&gt;Ceredos&lt;/a&gt;, an Elite. As the hound falls, the barrier is shattered- to reveal the rift, its walkway shattered and replaced with floating platforms, guarded by twilight dragons.\nJump on a Nexus Platform, and fly across the chasm, killing the twilight dragons along the way. Tarecgosa flies off to confront Thyrinar, the wyrm commanding the twilight dragons. Face off with one of the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Riftweaver\"&gt;Twilight Riftweaver&lt;/a&gt;s. Killing one will knock it off of its platform, allowing you to take it for yourself. When the Riftweaver casts Shadow Nova click one of the 4 orbs on his platform to steal a shield.\n\"When you reach the far side of the chasm, Tarecgosa will freeze the remaining Twilight dragons in ice blocks. Meet her on the platform where you once fought &lt;a href=\"Anomalus\"&gt;Anomalus&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Thyrinar\"&gt;Thyrinar&lt;/a&gt; has nearly 2 million health. For certain classes (those without self-heals?) he occasionally casts Twilight Restoration. Dispel or spell-steal it as soon as you can, or he'll quickly regain health. Thyrinar will also channel Twisting Twilight, a high-damage laser. He will also summon adds periodically.\nDefeat Thyrinar, and he will fall into the endless rift below. The rune holding Tarecgosa fades, and the Timeless Eye will appear in the center of the platform. Use the Eye to unveil the mysterious event.\nThe vision will end. Speak to Tarecgosa to end the quest.\"\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_Corinthians_13%23.22Through_a_glass.2C_darkly.22%7C\"&gt;\"Through a Glass, Darkly\"&lt;/a&gt; is a Biblical metaphor reference about seeing things clearly, in this case \"Obscure Event Witnessed\" provided you have a Timeless Eye; the glass/lense in the metaphor.

And back in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Prince Anduin&lt;/a&gt; suspects all is not as it seems with his father, King Varian.\nPlot.\nLo'Gosh, Valeera, Broll, and Thargas are making their way through the streets of &lt;a href=\"Menethil%20Harbor\"&gt;Menethil Harbor&lt;/a&gt;, with Thargas mounted on a &lt;a href=\"ram\"&gt;ram&lt;/a&gt;, Lo'Gosh riding a &lt;a href=\"horse\"&gt;horse&lt;/a&gt;, and Broll \u2014 &lt;a href=\"Travel%20Form\"&gt;transformed into a cheetah&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 carrying Valeera on his back. Thargas decides that since Lo'Gosh's mysterious enemy will likely expect him to travel from Menethil to &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; by sea or air, it'll be safer for the group to instead take the longer land route through the &lt;a href=\"Wetlands\"&gt;Wetlands&lt;/a&gt;. An old woman approaches Valeera and offers her a &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; dagger. Desperate for any energy source, Valeera touches the dagger and is overwhelmed by the sensation. Broll, however, swipes the dagger out of the old woman's grip and rushes out of the harbor, taking Valeera with him. Lo'Gosh and Thargas follow them out into the Wetlands.\nMeanwhile, in a dark room, a &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;hooded lady&lt;/a&gt; meets with the &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Vendellin%20Soulfire\"&gt;Vendellin Soulfire&lt;/a&gt; and hires him to assassinate Lo'Gosh. Vendellin requests an extremely high fee for the job, demands that he receive the entire sum at once, and reveals that he knows his employer for &lt;a href=\"Black%20dragonflight\"&gt;what she is&lt;/a&gt;. The hooded figure complies but warns him not to fail in his mission, or he \"will\" see her as she truly is.\nIn the Wetlands, Lo'Gosh's party fight off a pack of &lt;a href=\"raptor\"&gt;raptor&lt;/a&gt;s. During the evening, they cook some of the beasts' meat over a campfire, but Valeera refuses to eat. Broll tells her that even just the withdrawal effects from touching the fel dagger will be difficult. He offers her some medicinal herbs, which she refuses. At the campfire, Broll tells Lo'Gosh and Thargas that while &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; use only natural and divine magic, &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; revel in the use of &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; and lately even fel energies. Valeera will inevitably crave darker magic and experience painful withdrawal, but it might be for the best that she goes through the worst of it out in the marsh, where there are no further temptations.\nThe next morning in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;King Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; meets with King \"Varian\" and &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Highlord Bolvar&lt;/a&gt; to discuss the threat posed by the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt;, who have left their capital in &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt; and begun infiltrating the &lt;a href=\"Badlands\"&gt;Badlands&lt;/a&gt;, Wetlands, and &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Morogh\"&gt;Dun Morogh&lt;/a&gt;. Magni dismisses Bolvar's concerns about the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s who are threatening &lt;a href=\"Lakeshire\"&gt;Lakeshire&lt;/a&gt;, considering them to be no great threat, but insists that the Dark Irons are treacherous and may soon threaten &lt;a href=\"Thandol%20Span\"&gt;Thandol Span&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Lady Katrana Prestor&lt;/a&gt; enters the room and provokes Magni by mentioning his daughter &lt;a href=\"Moira%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Moira&lt;/a&gt;'s rumored relationship with &lt;a href=\"Dagran%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Dagran Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt; and asking why he hasn't gone to war against the Dark Irons. She then points out that it would be unwise for Stormwind to get involved in a personal feud between two dwarf nations, a sentiment that \"Varian\" (who has so far seemed distant and uninterested in the meeting) agrees with.\nMeanwhile in the Wetlands, Lo'Gosh's party approach the mountains and prepare to begin their climb toward Ironforge when they are suddenly ambushed by a group of Dark Irons led by &lt;a href=\"Gunnar%20Flyntrock\"&gt;Gunnar Flyntrock&lt;/a&gt;, who reveals that the Dark Irons have captured Thargas' brother &lt;a href=\"Hjalmar%20Anvilmar\"&gt;Hjalmar&lt;/a&gt; and are holding him under torture. Lo'Gosh and Thargas clash with the Dark Irons head on while Broll and Valeera try to watch each other's back. While in &lt;a href=\"Bear%20Form\"&gt;Bear Form&lt;/a&gt;, Broll is felled when a Dark Iron throws an axe in his back. After a short battle, all of the Dark Irons are slain except for Gunnar. Before expiring, he tells Thargas that Hjalmar is being held at Thandol Span and gloats that once the two brothers are dead, the Anvilmars will be no more.\nIn Stormwind Keep, Magni angrily prepares to leave the city, telling Bolvar that the Varian he knew would never have handed over his kingdom to \"some scheming tart\". Anduin overhears the conversation from his sword practice session and is knocked down by his tutor while he's distracted.\nIn the Wetlands, Lo'Gosh helps remove arrows from the injured Broll's body. Valeera notes that Broll could have shifted to his &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt; form during the battle but chose to remain in Bear Form to shield her, and that she was so nervous she couldn't throw her daggers straight. She apologizes to Broll and promises to do whatever he tells her to get better, as long as he doesn't die. Recovering, Broll shifts back to night elf form while Thargas points out that the group is still several days away from Ironforge. However, Lo'Gosh refuses to leave his old teacher Hjalmar in the Dark Irons' hands and resolves that the group will head to Thandol Span to rescue him.\nIn Stormwind, Magni and his entourage prepare to leave on the &lt;a href=\"Deeprun%20Tram\"&gt;Deeprun Tram&lt;/a&gt; when he is suddenly approached by Anduin, who confides that he too has felt something wrong with his father, before the conversation is interrupted by Varian and Katrana's arrival. A dwarf informs Magni that they've just received word that the Dark Irons have claimed control of Thandol Span from &lt;a href=\"Longbraid%20the%20Grim\"&gt;Longbraid&lt;/a&gt; and his men. Magni asks Varian if he'll finally send reinforcements now, but changes his mind and decides that the dwarves will handle the matter themselves. Magni sends for a dirigible to fly straight from Stormwind to the span. Disappointed in Varian, Magni internally resolves to seek out the \"Lo'Gosh\" that &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina&lt;/a&gt; believes in to see what he's really about.\nBack in the Wetlands, Lo'Gosh's party are stopped on their journey when Vendellin Soulfire arrives on a &lt;a href=\"dragonhawk\"&gt;dragonhawk&lt;/a&gt; and approaches Valeera, offering her fel energy. When she gets close, Vendellin afflicts her with the &lt;a href=\"Mark%20of%20Kathra%27natir\"&gt;Mark of Kathra'natir&lt;/a&gt;. He then turns to the others, afflicting Lo'Gosh and Thargas' mounts with &lt;a href=\"fear%20effect\"&gt;fear&lt;/a&gt; to cause them to run away in panic. Broll calls on the winds to sweep away Vendellin's dragonhawk, but the warlock responds by sacrificing the life essence of the grass around him to conjure a large &lt;a href=\"doomguard\"&gt;doomguard&lt;/a&gt; that attacks Thargas and Broll. Vendellin turns to Lo'Gosh and afflicts him with painful magic, but the human quickly recovers, to the warlock's shock. A few yards away, Broll summons huge roots that snare the doomguard and pull it beneath the swamp, while Lo'Gosh severs Vendellin's head from his body with a single blow from his sword.\nDuring the night, Broll attemps to comfort Valeera, whose skin has grown sickly pale and covered in fel runes. Valeera says that she can feel the curse's fel energy crawling through her soul and that she is too befouled and filthy to bear it. Crying, she begs Broll to help her, and he promises to do all he can."}

Among the ways Throw-weapons have functioned are: \nClasses.\nThrown weapons made use of the &lt;a href=\"Throw\"&gt;Throw&lt;/a&gt; ability which is known by all &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s.\nRogues.\nMost thrown weapons are intended for Rogues due to the two abilities below, and that most thrown weapons have &lt;a href=\"agility\"&gt;agility&lt;/a&gt; and other Rogue-beneficial stats on them.\nWarriors.\nWarriors can make use of a few thrown weapons.\nHunters.\nHunters are no longer able to use thrown, but benefited stat-wise from most thrown weapons when they could (as Hunters use many of the stats also used by Rogues). However, they had little use for them as thrown weapons occupy the same equipment slot as &lt;a href=\"bow\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"gun\"&gt;gun&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"crossbow\"&gt;crossbow&lt;/a&gt;s which serve as the primary weapons for a Hunter.

He will spawn next to the &lt;a href=\"moonwell\"&gt;moonwell&lt;/a&gt; in the back corner of &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Grove\"&gt;Twilight Grove&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Duskwood%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Duskwood&lt;/a&gt;.\nStrategy.\nIt is recommended that you bring at least 30 players and they should be experienced raiders.\nSoul Corruption is applied every few seconds, at irregular intervals. Soul Corruption is an area of effect spell, and it hits everyone within line of sight (360\u00b0, seems to have 40 yards range), and also knocks the person back.\nTo counter soul corruption, the entire raid needs to stay out of line of sight of the Twilight Corrupter. This fight is similar to the &lt;a href=\"Firemaw\"&gt;Firemaw&lt;/a&gt; fight in &lt;a href=\"Blackwing%20Lair\"&gt;Blackwing Lair&lt;/a&gt;. The pillar on the right side of the ramp to the portal to the Emerald Dream can be used for the raid to hide behind. Healers position themselves so that they are within line of sight with the tank(s) while staying out of line of sight with the Twilight Corrupter. Main damage done on this fight is done by ranged DPS, primarily damage over time spells. Melee DPS is somewhat dangerous as they can easily be killed if they take too much damage and you want to have 0 deaths if possible. If the raid is all healed up the melee can run in and dps between AoEs but be careful as the AoE does direct damage as well as a DoT. Ranged classes should run in to apply damage over time spells right after Soul Corruption ticks, and hide behind the pillar until the next Soul Corruption.\nAlternatively, sufficient healing and some shadow resistance will help with the DoT damage. At level 70, it is more convenient to utilize buffs, gear, and healing to endure the damage over time.\nMain Tank positioning is very important. The MT should put his back up against the side of the ramp so that the AoE knockback doesn't knock him out of position. Do not position too close to the bottom of the ramp either as the AoE can actually knock the MT up on to the ramp which will cause the Twilight Corrupter to head towards the bottom of the ramp in pursuit which also puts everyone that was behind the pillar into line of sight. This can easily be a raid wiper. Also be aware that the line of sight of the pillar does not perfectly match the shape of the pillar model. Its actually a little smaller so stand right in the middle just to be safe.\nHe will also mind control random players on his aggro list for 30 seconds, increasing damage done by 100% and attack speed by 100%. Players that get mind controlled need to be polymorphed until mind control runs out. With a smaller level 70 group it is crucial that the MC'd players be crowd controlled.\nDouble tanks are advisable, perhaps required for smaller groups, as the targetting for mind control seems to be random. However, the more people are on his threat list, the smaller the chance that Twilight Corrupter will mind control one of the tanks.\nQuotes.\nAggro:\nKilling a player:"}

With the branches in hand, they traveled the world to locations where &lt;a href=\"saronite\"&gt;saronite&lt;/a&gt; blooms had sprung to life, including a remote region of the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; that would later be known as Duskwood. The branch quickly took root, and became a new tree all its own, acting as a conduit and channeling the powers of the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; into the waking world, strengthening the nearby wildlife and scouring the saronite deposits.\nHowever, the imprisoned &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt; used the trees planted by the &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s as a doorway into the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;, spreading his corruption with the other Old Gods in the ethereal domain. This marked the beginning of what would become known as the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nMillennia later, while the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; suffered under the corruptions of the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;, Twilight Grove was guarded by the &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20of%20Nightmare%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Dragons of Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;.

Consequently, they sent the adventurers to investigate the disturbance for them, and to put an end to the strange anomalies that take place at this time of the year.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vassandra%20Stormclaw\"&gt;Vassandra Stormclaw&lt;/a&gt; performed a ritual to summon &lt;a href=\"Goldrinn\"&gt;Goldrinn&lt;/a&gt; through the dream portal, using the direct connection between Duskwood and the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; to call forth the &lt;a href=\"Ancient\"&gt;Ancient&lt;/a&gt;. During the ritual, multiple lupine spirits attacked from the dream, until finally Goldrinn appeared. &lt;a href=\"Tess%20Greymane\"&gt;Tess Greymane&lt;/a&gt; asked him then to know what it means to bear the &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; curse, to experience its rage and wield its strength. In response, the wolf god then provided the princess a vision, in which she relived the &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Gilneas\"&gt;fall of Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt;.\nTerror by Torchlight.\nIn the aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Flynn%20Fairwind\"&gt;Flynn Fairwind&lt;/a&gt; visited the grove before going to &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Hill%20Cemetery\"&gt;Raven Hill Cemetery&lt;/a&gt;, in order to glimpse something soothing before heading into the fray. They later returned here after stealing the &lt;a href=\"%3ATorch%20of%20Holy%20Flame\"&gt;:Torch of Holy Flame&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Necromancer%20%28Terror%20by%20Torchlight%29\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt; to purify it in the &lt;a href=\"moonwell\"&gt;moonwell&lt;/a&gt;, and then used it against her to save &lt;a href=\"Darkshire\"&gt;Darkshire&lt;/a&gt; from her &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; army.\nTwilight Grove digsite.\nThe Twilight Grove is a night elf &lt;a href=\"archaeology\"&gt;archaeology&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"dig%20site\"&gt;dig site&lt;/a&gt;.\nNote that the digsite map seems to show that the digsite covers only about 2/3 of the Twilight Grove, the remaining area is largely impassable.\nSpeculation.\nThe Twilight Grove and the great tree within may be the reason that Duskwood, while under the same curse that befell &lt;a href=\"Deadwind%20Pass\"&gt;Deadwind Pass&lt;/a&gt;, still teems with life despite the lack of sunlight. The tree itself was planted to purify saronite deposits in the area and continues to thrive despite the shadow curse, presenting a resilience to shadow overall. In addition, the great tree serves as a conduit between the waking world and the lifegiving energies of the dream, likely contributing to the appearance of the Twilight Grove."}

It is the location of the ancient dwarven fortress, &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;, and also houses a majority of &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer%20clan\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; settlements, working with &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;. There is a small &lt;a href=\"red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; presence. The story of the &lt;a href=\"twilight%20dragonflight\"&gt;twilight dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; unfolds in this zone.\nThe famous region of &lt;a href=\"Northeron\"&gt;Northeron&lt;/a&gt; was once the northern part of the Highlands.\nHistory.\nDesciption from the official site:\nFew places on Azeroth exemplify this ever-changing dynamic more than the \"Twilight Highlands\" of the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe highlands have undergone constant upheaval throughout their history, with races and factions thriving, collapsing, and changing seemingly without pause. The fortress-city of &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt; has played host to no fewer than three potent factions: the &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20dwarf\"&gt;Wildhammer dwarves&lt;/a&gt;, who abandoned their home after a &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Iron&lt;/a&gt; curse left it uninhabitable; the &lt;a href=\"red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, which was forced to fight for the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; in the captivity of the Dragonmaw orcs during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;; and, of course, the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw\"&gt;Dragonmaw&lt;/a&gt; themselves, who were driven from Grim Batol when the red dragonflight was finally freed from their grasp.\nThe Dragonmaw now cling to the edges of the highlands. They're no less wild and difficult to deal with than when they ruled Grim Batol, but their knowledge of dragons and warfare is of unquestionable importance, especially amidst the chaos of the Cataclysm. The Wildhammer dwarves dwell in forested outposts among the highlands' mountains; though long friendly with the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, they have only now begun to consider casting their lot in with &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; thanks to the entreaties of their cousins, the &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard%20clan\"&gt;Bronzebeard clan&lt;/a&gt;. Even the mighty red dragonflight has suffered greatly in recent months: its members have been decimated by a frenzied, newly aggressive &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; attacking relentlessly from the petrified &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Forest\"&gt;Obsidian Forest&lt;/a&gt;.\nAmidst this upheaval, a new power has come to possess the highlands.\nThough the environment has been given many names throughout its history, it's only been dubbed \"Twilight\" thanks to the dominance of its current masters. The fanatical &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; cultists appreciate the name, but there are more functional features to the swath of land they've chosen as their headquarters. It's rimmed by massive mountain peaks that scrape at the sky like fingernails, making invasion by land nearly impossible, and the highlands' black-glass beaches ensure that marine assaults are fraught with terror; ships docking on the peninsula risk running aground.\nMore important to the cult, however, is the promise of worldly extinction and change that permeates the land. In the dimness of the highlands, shadows are deeper. The sun and the rest of Azeroth seem distant. The elements themselves are more pronounced: fires burn hotter; rain forces its way into the ground; and the heaves and shudders of the land call to mind some colossal being stirring beneath the earth. This doesn't frighten the members of the Twilight's Hammer; it lulls them to sleep.\nTheir dark work is done here in a manner that could never have been realized in &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;. The devoted of the Twilight's Hammer train in the halls of mighty fortresses, not tiny compounds and outposts. They summon dangerous, mercurial elementals who loathe each other to the point of outright war but still pause their feuds momentarily to work towards the destruction of the other races. Outside the highlands, the cult is fractious and divided. Here, it is guided on its mission of destruction by some of the cruelest and bloodiest names in history, yet the names associated with this cabal belie the true extent of its leadership.\nThese dark whisperers chose the highlands as their base of operations for a reason. They can feel the presence of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt; in the air and see their victory in the darkness. The shifting landscape, battling factions, and wicked elements embody the cult's vision of what its world will become as it is finally purged of life and order. The rest of Azeroth will follow the Twilight Highlands into oblivion, one way or another. According to &lt;a href=\"Artesh\"&gt;Artesh&lt;/a&gt;, the Twilight's Hammer built their stronghold in the Highlands because of strong elemental powers in the area.\nAside from that, the native creatures in the highlands are gryphons, owls, sabreworgs, and deer. Notable creatures include the massive spirit wolf &lt;a href=\"Karoma\"&gt;Karoma&lt;/a&gt; herself, and the huge lion &lt;a href=\"Sambas\"&gt;Sambas&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Stormcaller%20Mylra\"&gt;Stormcaller Mylra&lt;/a&gt;, as of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s latest invasion the Twilight Highlands were overrun, and the Wildhammer clan had been scattered.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nAn agent of the red dragonflight, &lt;a href=\"Eryna\"&gt;Eryna&lt;/a&gt;, revealed that the &lt;a href=\"trogg\"&gt;trogg&lt;/a&gt;s dug too deep and disturbed a previously-unknown massive cache of twilight dragon eggs below &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;. Eryna claimed she could sense thousands of heartbeats below the ruined city, but had no idea how many were truly down there, or where other caches might exist.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Vermillion%20Redoubt\"&gt;Vermillion Redoubt&lt;/a&gt;, Void-Twisted twilight dragonkin surrounded &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;, though a champion and &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; arrived and helped subdue the invaders. A twilight dragon &lt;a href=\"Vexiona\"&gt;Vexiona&lt;/a&gt; was confronted in front of Grim Batol who before fleeing stated \"Your pathetic dragonflights will fall. If you will not serve the master, then I will find one who will\".\nGeography.\nTravel hubs.\nFlight paths.\n &lt;a href=\"Flight%20path\"&gt;Flight path&lt;/a&gt;s from &lt;a href=\"Gullet\"&gt;The Gullet&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=\"Flight%20path\"&gt;Flight path&lt;/a&gt;s from &lt;a href=\"Vermillion%20Redoubt\"&gt;Vermillion Redoubt&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=\"Flight%20path\"&gt;Flight path&lt;/a&gt;s from &lt;a href=\"Crushblow\"&gt;Crushblow&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=\"Flight%20path\"&gt;Flight path&lt;/a&gt;s from &lt;a href=\"Bloodgulch\"&gt;Bloodgulch&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=\"Flight%20path\"&gt;Flight path&lt;/a&gt;s from &lt;a href=\"Krazzworks\"&gt;The Krazzworks&lt;/a&gt;\nPortals.\nThe portals to and from Twilight Highlands unlock after players complete a short quest chain after reaching the Twilight Highlands, concluding with &lt;a href=\"The%20Way%20is%20Open\"&gt;The Way is Open&lt;/a&gt; for the Alliance in &lt;a href=\"Highbank\"&gt;Highbank&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Traitor%27s%20Bait\"&gt;Traitor's Bait&lt;/a&gt; for the Horde in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuests.\nSee &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Highlands%20quests\"&gt;Twilight Highlands quests&lt;/a&gt;\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;\nIntroduction quests, first quest hub and an appearance by Deathwing:"}

After being freed from his &lt;a href=\"Last%20Prison\"&gt;titan prison&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, N'Zoth began trying to tear down the veil separating Ny'alotha from the physical world in order to merge the two realities into one and thereby transform Azeroth into the Black Empire. This would also erase all that previously was.\n&lt;a href=\"Black%20Empire%20Obelisk\"&gt;Black Empire Obelisk&lt;/a&gt;s are what anchor Ny'alotha to reality, allowing its denizens and structures to manifest in the real world.

Under N'Zoth's command, the nightmarish armies of the Black Empire threaten to engulf the world and reshape it according to their master's vision. As part of the Old God's efforts to bring Ny'alotha into being, N'Zoth's minions tried to corrupt the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Origination\"&gt;Forge of Origination&lt;/a&gt; in order to reshape Azeroth into the Black Empire. The &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt; of Azeroth venture deep into the horrific realm to confront mad heralds and inscrutable horrors, and ultimately go eye-to-eyes with N'Zoth himself for one final confrontation against the Old God in a fateful battle for Azeroth's survival. N'Zoth and Ny'alotha were ultimately destroyed together when Azeroth's &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt; used the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Azeroth\"&gt;Heart of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; to fire the powers of the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Origination\"&gt;Forge of Origination&lt;/a&gt;, empowered by the &lt;a href=\"Engine%20of%20Nalak%27sha\"&gt;Engine of Nalak'sha&lt;/a&gt;, upon the corruptor.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zekhan\"&gt;Zekhan&lt;/a&gt; reported that soldiers who described the place gave two different descriptions.

The battle revolves around the \"Rot\" debuff and keeping it from overwhelming the raid. While a simple encounter on normal difficulty, the fight becomes an unforgiving raid environment on heroic and mythic, with the Infest debuff able to gradually whittle players down and putting a massive strain on healers. \nBackground.\nAdventure Guide.\n\" Nythendra was once a member of the Green Dragonflight charged with guarding the world tree, &lt;a href=\"Shaladrassil\"&gt;Shaladrassil&lt;/a&gt;.

Nythendra is now nothing more than a skeletal version of herself, swarming in pestilence, ready to devour anyone or anything foolish enough to enter her lair.\"\nOverview.\nNythendra's Infested Breath unleashes great gouts of insects and corruption, consuming 50 Energy. When Nythendra's Energy is depleted, she collapses to the ground and Heart of the Swarm begins. Once she is fully recharged, her form coalesces and she resumes her attack.\nStrategy.\nNythendra requires 2 tanks. She will cast Volatile Rot on the tank which will cause the tank to explode and deal damage to the raid, reduced the father they are away from the tank, and spread a massive amount of rot-slime around them after a set period. The group should spread out to the sides and back of the boss, keeping the area near the entrance clear so that tanks can safely run near the entrance and drop their Volatile Rot without putting anyone else in danger. \nEveryone else will periodically get hit with a debuff called Rot, which will drop a pool of slime around the player on the ground after 10 seconds. Anyone with Rot must immedietly run out towards the edge of the room to drop the Rot before running back. However, be sure to not run out of the range of the healers as the Rot will be hurting you while the debuff is up and running to the absolute edge of the arena is not necessary, just far enough away where it will not put anyone in danger. Rot will also be pulsing nature damage to anyone close-by, so players should be spread out as much as possible around the boss to avoid unnecessary damage. Nythendra also sometimes turn to face a different direction and shoots Infested Breath at a random clump of players. Players only have about 3 seconds before the cast goes off to dodge out of the way, so players must be attentive to the boss herself and not just the Rot. The breath will also drop several pools of slime in front of the boss. \nPhase 2 begins when Nythendra's energy bar is depleted. She will slump down onto the ground and not move or attack, but the Rot-slimes will now begin to move on their own towards the boss. Simply dodge out of the way of the slime. While it may be tempting to simply find a safe spot and do more DPS to the inactive boss, the insects on the ground will periodically grow to massive size and begin exploding with Burst of Corruption, dealing nature damage to anyone within 8 yards. It is not uncommon for a reckless DPS to be so focused on damaging the boss that they don't notice the bug growing to large size right next to them until it is too late. Prioritize staying alive over damaging the boss as the enrage timer should not be an issue unless too many DPS die during the encounter. Once the boss absorbs all the slimes, she becomes active again and Phase 1 begins anew. Rinse and repeat until the boss goes down. \nHeroic.\nHeroic difficulty only adds one more mechanic to the battle, but it is an impactful one. Every time a player gets hit with nature-damage (which is unavoidable due to most everyone gaining the Rot debuff at some point and taking damage from the tank's Volatile Rot), they will gain a stack of Infest. 1-4 stacks should not be a problem for a heroic-geared group, but any higher will start to put a serious strain on the healer's mana. Stacks are reset to 0 when Phase 2 ends. DPS composition is important to keep in mind here, as a group with too many melee may become a liability due to Rot pulsing nature damage immediately when it hits a player, giving multiple players 1-2 stacks of Infest if the afflicted player is not VERY quick to run away. It is advisable to set up quadrants with markers that each healer is responsible to personally take care of. Phase 2 is especially healing intensive as, in addition to people getting hit by slimes and bugs, all those abilities continue to give stacks of Infest until the very end of the phase. "}

He could be found at the core of the ship, at the &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20the%20Naaru\"&gt;Seat of the Naaru&lt;/a&gt;. O'ros was the last of the prime naaru &lt;a href=\"Xe%27ra\"&gt;Xe'ra&lt;/a&gt;'s line.\nHistory.\nRight before the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt; began, &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt; reached out to the naaru independently, both seeking aid against the dark forces amassing on &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Army of the Light&lt;/a&gt; heard their pleas but the Army's battles with the Legion were costly and ceaseless, so they could not spare soldiers to protect Outland. Instead &lt;a href=\"A%27dal\"&gt;A'dal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"M%27uru\"&gt;M'uru&lt;/a&gt;, and O'ros volunteered to help the people of Outland and arrived with &lt;a href=\"Tempest%20Keep\"&gt;Tempest Keep&lt;/a&gt; in a corner of the shattered realm called &lt;a href=\"Netherstorm\"&gt;Netherstorm&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter A'dal traveled to &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt;, leaving the other two naaru to watch over Tempest Keep, M'uru was captured and taken to Quel'Thalas by the blood elves of &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; shortly afterwards. O'ros managed to bar the elves from entering its section of Tempest Keep, hiding itself away, and so remained within the satellite structure of the \"&lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt;\".\nAs the Legion's presence on Outland steadily increased, A'dal, sensing the lingering presence of O'ros from Shattrath, recommended to Velen that he and his people attempt to commandeer the vessel in order to reach Azeroth and seek out new allies. Although the draenei successfully did so, breaking the \"Exodar\" away from the rest of Tempest Keep and escaping, they along with O'ros crash-landed on &lt;a href=\"Azuremyst%20Isle\"&gt;Azuremyst Isle&lt;/a&gt; due to the sabotage of the blood elves. Fortunately, they soon encountered the neighboring night elves of &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;, leading to the Alliance \"unanimously\" welcoming Velen and his people into their ranks.\nThe Burning Crusade.\n&lt;a href=\"Matis%20the%20Cruel\"&gt;Matis the Cruel&lt;/a&gt; stated that O'ros was sought by the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;, who apparently wanted to capture and enslave it as they recently had M'uru. O'ros was seen in visions as the &lt;a href=\"Vision%20of%20Purity\"&gt;Vision of Purity&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; traveled to the \"Exodar\" to learn from Velen about the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;. The prince of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; would spend much time with O'ros during his studies, and Anduin would later miss its presence after reminiscing about older and happier times.\nOne of &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;'s few surviving draenei children, &lt;a href=\"Dornaa\"&gt;Dornaa&lt;/a&gt;, heard about how O'ros had traveled with her people to Azeroth, and asked to be taken to see him. O'ros, sensing something very special about her and that she would grow up to be an important figure among her brethren, had the Alliance adventurer take her to &lt;a href=\"Farseer%20Nobundo\"&gt;Farseer Nobundo&lt;/a&gt;, the draenei's first shaman, who was deeply impressed by her ability to summon four elementals at the same time.\nLegion.\nO'ros participated in the Ritual of Light in the &lt;a href=\"Netherlight%20Temple\"&gt;Netherlight Temple&lt;/a&gt; to return the &lt;a href=\"void%20god\"&gt;void god&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Saraka\"&gt;Saraka&lt;/a&gt; back to its holy form, the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Saa%27ra\"&gt;Saa'ra&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; later attacked the \"Exodar\" in order to destroy O'ros so that he could not unlock the knowledge contained within &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Heart\"&gt;Light's Heart&lt;/a&gt;, the core of the prime naaru &lt;a href=\"Xe%27ra\"&gt;Xe'ra&lt;/a&gt;, his ancestor. Despite the best efforts of the draenei and their champions to defend him, O'ros was killed by &lt;a href=\"High%20General%20Rakeesh\"&gt;High General Rakeesh&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"man%27ari\"&gt;man'ari&lt;/a&gt; son of &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt;. With its death, the last naaru prime died and the Seat of the Naaru remains empty."}

As if in answer, she suddenly heard a voice say \"Yes\", even though no one else was near. The voice sounded both close and strangely distant, and made Taruka's mustache hairs stand up and her tusks ache. A gust of wind then appeared and deposited several ice crystals in the pattern of a kraken\u2014the mark of Oacha'noa\u2014at Taruka's feet, though there was no sign of wind in the surrounding area. She asked if she was to take the spear, and the wind came back to scatter the symbol it had made before stopping again. Interpreting this as a sign from the goddess, Taruka took the spear with her on her voyage. It ultimately allowed her to kill a &lt;a href=\"Beast%20of%20Lyquokk%20Strait\"&gt;sea monster&lt;/a&gt; she encountered in &lt;a href=\"Lyquokk%20Strait\"&gt;Lyquokk Strait&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpeculation.\nWhen first called forth by &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s, Oacha'noa asks them if they are working with \"the &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s of this land\", likely indicating the &lt;a href=\"Drakkari%20tribe\"&gt;Drakkari&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ice%20troll\"&gt;ice troll&lt;/a&gt;s, and wonders if they are there to kill her and take her power, likely referring to the fact that the Drakkari betrayed and killed their &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt; gods to use their powers against the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. This could mean that Oacha'noa has been regarded as a loa, or that she may be a &lt;a href=\"Wild%20God\"&gt;Wild God&lt;/a&gt; and as such could have had contact with the Wild Gods worshipped by the Drakkari, thus knowing their fate."}

The oathstones eventually went dormant. &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; believes that they fell quiet when the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt; sacrificed their powers to defeat &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;. She now believes that if the dragonflights fulfill their callings and renew all of the stones, the Aspects' powers will be restored, a necessity if they are to defeat the &lt;a href=\"Primal%20Incarnates\"&gt;Primal Incarnates&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"bronze%20dragonflight\"&gt;bronze dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; believes that the restoration of the oathstones may be dragonkind's last and best hope to reclaim their position as caretakers of Azeroth.\nThe oathstones are as follows:\nCommunication devices.\nA smaller kind of oathstones are used as signs of commitment to help the dragonflight or dragon it belongs to. They are important to dragons as bonds of agreement. It is possible to telepathically communicate through them. Oathstones are made from a dragon's scale which is turned into a gemstone. Because they are made from a dragon's scale, an oathstone is still considered part of the original dragon, and so can be used to communicate with the dragon and the dragon can even cast spells through them. The linked dragon can also see through their oathstone.\nShortly before the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Battle of Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;, the mage &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt; was given an oathstone from &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Vereesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Vereesa Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; one from &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Korialstrasz&lt;/a&gt;. Deathwing's was a small silver medallion with runes around the edge and a black gemstone in the middle, the stone having been formed from Deathwing's scale. When Rhonin was wearing it, Deathwing was able to control his body remotely if he wished. Rhonin used Deathwing's oathstone to destroy the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt;, as the Soul did not have his essence inside it and so could be destroyed by his body."}

{"id": "92578", "revid": "1965082", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=92578", "title": "Object-oriented programming", "text": "Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a relatively new concept (compared to procedural programing) which allows code to become \"objects.\" These objects can be duplicated, extended, and in some languages, be converted between relatives. Object Oriented Programming also allows for programmers to maintain organization in their programs. This is especially vital in WoW addons, as all addons share the same &lt;a href=\"execution%20environment\"&gt;execution environment&lt;/a&gt; and thus can conflict if poorly organized.\nNamespaces.\nA namespace is an object-oriented concept which allows for organization of variables, functions, and other elements of a program. A namespace encapsulates code such that to access that code, you must first reference the namespace to which you are referring. The global namespace is one such default namespace -- all global variables are considered to be in the \"global namespace.\" Programmers can create other namespaces, thus organizing code and reducing pollution of the global namespace. The following example in C++ shows a good example of how namespaces work, and why they are useful:\n namespace foo\n int a = 1; // Make an integer here\n namespace bar\n int a = 2; // Make another integer here\n cout \u00ab foo::a \u00ab \"\\n\"; // Prints 1\n cout \u00ab bar::a \u00ab \"\\n\"; // Prints 2\n cout \u00ab a \u00ab \"\\n\"; // Illegal - \"a\" is undefined.\nNamespaces maintain program organization and contain code which might other conflict. It is essentially another form of limiting &lt;a href=\"Lua_Scope\"&gt;variable scope&lt;/a&gt;, but indirectly.\nLua Namespaces.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Lua\"&gt;Lua&lt;/a&gt;, namespaces don't directly exist. However, Lua programmers typically take advantage of several key, and unique, features which are available in the language to provide a indirect mechanism which can be considered setting up a namespace. Some other programmers, unfamiliar with languages that don't allow for the creation of namespaces, may confuse these with classes, but the major difference is that only one instance of a namespace ever exists, while there can be many separate instances of a class.\nIn Lua, a function is a variable. As such, it should be noted that a reference to a function can be used wherever a variable is used. The implications of this is that functions can be stored inside tables. Furthermore, in WoW, all addons share the same &lt;a href=\"execution%20environment\"&gt;execution environment&lt;/a&gt;, therefore it is vital that some form of &lt;a href=\"Lua_Scope\"&gt;scope limitation&lt;/a&gt; is used so common variable names do not cause addon conflicts. Namespaces are one such method to organize code, thus limiting conflicts.\nCreation of a Namespace.\nThe concept of a Lua namespace is simple. A single global variable, a table, is created, which then can be used to reference all other variables, which are not global. This allows for minimal global namespace pollution, thus minimizing (but not preventing) addon conflicts due to identically named variables. The following code creates the same variable namespaces as the above C code:\n foo = {}; -- Create a foo namespace\n bar = {}; -- Create a bar namespace\n -- Remember that foo.a is equivalent to foo[\"a\"]\n foo.a = 1; -- Make an integer in foo\n bar.a = 2; -- Make an integer in bar\n DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessage(foo.a); -- Prints 1\n DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessage(bar.a); -- Prints 2\nFrom this example it can be easily seen that creating namespaces in Lua is extremely simple; more simple than is available in many other languages.\nNamespace Use.\nMany Lua programmers consider the use of Lua namespaces as an indicator of a good understanding of the language. This is because it is very organized and requires a good understanding of several language features. Encapsulating your addon within one or a few namespaces can result in allowing your addon to use a minimal number of global variables, thus minimizing its global namespace pollution. \nMany addons authors create a single namespace which encapsulates all its code. This limits the addon's exposure without limiting functionality. Instead of creating 10 global functions, for example, the addon instead has a single namespace and 10 functions which are accessible within that namespace. The following code segment provides a bad example which unnecessarily pollutes the global namespace, and then provides a functionally equivalent example, which is far more organized. It creates two functions and two variables in the namespace:\n -- Pollutes the global namespace, making 2\n -- global variables and 2 global functions\n MyAddon_A = 1;\n MyAddon_B = 2;\n function MyAddon_PrintA()\n DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessage(MyAddon_A);\n end\n function MyAddon_PrintB()\n DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessage(MyAddon_B);\n end\n -- Creates a \"MyAddon\" namespace and then creates\n -- 2 variables, 2 functions inside it\n MyAddon = {};\n MyAddon.a = 1;\n MyAddon.b = 2;\n function MyAddon.Printa()\n DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessage(MyAddon.a);\n end\n function MyAddon.Printb()\n DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessage(MyAddon.b);\n end\nAs is directly evident, the appropriate use of namespaces can cause code to be far more organized and limit conflicts. This is necessary in an environment such as WoW, where several authors will write several addons, each of whom has no idea what the other is writing, and conflicts must be avoided as much as possible.\nClasses.\nClasses are very similar to namespaces, and implemented almost identically in Lua. Many programmers consider classes to be the fundamental concept of Object Oriented Programming, and the building block upon which other concepts can be created. They, like namespaces, are containers, but containers that can be duplicated. You can have many instances of a class, even though it's only declared once. Take the following C++ example:\n class Foo\n public: \n int bar; -- Creates a variable \"bar\"\n -- The class \"Foo\" can now effectively be considered a variable type\n -- and thus we can make more \"Foos.\"\n Foo baz, quux; -- Makes two Foos\n -- We can now access the int inside our Foos:\n baz.bar = 1; -- Note that these are\n quux.bar = 2; -- two different variables\nClasses allow reuse of code and organization of blocks which could be considered one element. For example, we could create a class \"character,\" which stores the character's name, level, race, and class. Obviously all four of these are related, so putting the variables in a single class is better than creating four variables out in the open. Furthermore, we could have many characters, so instead of creating 4 variables every time, we could just create 1 (a new character) which then handles making all of the appropriate variables that are stored for that character. In the examples that follow in this section, we will use this example of storing characters in a class \"Character,\" so that we can consistently provide examples to establish a better understanding.\nLua Classes.\nLua classes are handled similarly to Lua namespaces. Like many concepts in Lua, their implementation relies on the power of Lua tables to perform their task. One thing Lua namespaces don't have to do, however, that Lua classes do, is create themselves. As stated earlier, classes need to be reproducable atomically -- that is, multiple instances of classes need to be able to be instantiated. This is done through a Lua concept called \"&lt;a href=\"metatables\"&gt;metatables&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nMetatables are a complex concept. For information regarding them, see the [&lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html\"&gt;Lua documentation&lt;/a&gt;]. It is not, however, necessary to understand their entire purpose to create a class; it is only necessary to understand how they can be employed to accomplish our goal.\nInstantiation and Construction.\nA class is constructed typically by a function. This provides a single point of creation which is very modular. Typically this function is called \"new,\" though it is not required. First, the function must create a blank table. Then, it must imbue the table with the properties of the class. This may be functions, variables, or other contents which the class must store. the following example shows a simplistic class which creates a Character instance, which stores only the name of the character.\n Character = {};\n function Character:new()\n local self = {}; -- Create a blank table\n self.name = \"Unknown\"; -- Make a name variable in the class\n return self; -- Return the instance\n end\nWe can now create multiple instances of the class very quickly:\n local player1 = Character:new(); -- Create a Character\n local player2 = Character:new(); -- Create another\n player1.name = UnitName(\"player\");\n player2.name = UnitName(\"target\");\nWe will discuss later why the name \"self\" is logical for this table we create, but it can actually be any name of your choosing. It is, however, typically seen as \"self\" because it has logical connections to the syntax used in functions, as will be discussed later.\nMember Variables.\nA \"member variable\" is a term used to identify a variable that exists in a class. Member variables are not explicitly declared in Lua, but rather they are typically created during construction (when the class is instantiated). \n function Character:new()\n local self = {};\n self.name = \"Unknown\";\n self.level = 0;\n self.class = \"Unknown\";\n self.race = \"Unknown\";\n return self;\n end\nAs you can see, the variables are created upon construction, much in the manner which you would find in a namespace. A table is created, and inside the table, variables are created and stored. That table is the new instance of the class. In this manner, Lua classes are different from many other languages, as variables can be added to a class at any time, but their initial state is always the same.\nMember Functions.\nLike member variables, member functions are simply functions that are contained within the class. Even more interestingly, as functions are variables in Lua, functions can differ between classes. Since tables can store functions, adjusting the value of one of those functions can change the operation for that one instance, but leave the other instances identical. Sometimes this is preferred. However, sometimes, we want a change to propagate to all classes. \nExplicit Function Creation.\nOne form of creating member functions is shown in the following example. Like member variables, these functions can be created during construction, and thus it can be quickly seen how each class has its own instance of a function, as well, thus they can be changed in the future if desired:\n function Character:new()\n local self = {};\n -- &lt;Create variables as above here&gt;\n self.isAlliance = function()\n if( self.race == \"Gnome\" or\n self.race == \"Human\" or\n self.race == \"Night Elf\" or\n self.race == \"Dwarf\" or\n self.race == \"Draenei\" ) \n then\n return true;\n else\n return false;\n end\n end\n return self;\n end\nSo, it is possible to create functions simply by defining variables. But there is an inherent problem with this system. Let's take the example that this class is being used in a character list of everyone you've ever seen. This list could be in the thousands, and as such, we will need to make thousands of instances of Character. That means creating thousands of copies of the exact same function. Certainly this function does not need to be unique to each instance of the class. So how do we avoid this obvious waste of memory? By using a metatable.\nMetatables.\nMetatables are defined by the Lua documentation as \"an ordinary Lua table that defines the behavior of the original value under certain special operations\" &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. We want to control one of these special operations. Specifically, we want to control how the table accesses variables that do not exist. While this may not seem immediately logical, it is a simple trick that we can use to convince Lua of functions that are defined for all instances of the class.\nFirst, let's create the function. The function is created much like you would find any other function available. Normally, a function is created using the following syntax:\n function foo()\n -- Code block\n end\nIn our case, we need the function to be a member of the class we are defining. Thus, it needs to be contained within the base table, which in our case, is called \"Character.\" For the above example \"isAllance(),\" we would want to create the function like this:\n function Character:isAlliance()\n -- Code block\n end\nNote the slight difference: We use a colon instead of a period here. This is typically used for non-static functions (functions which rely upon the state of the class, or the variables inside the instance of the class, to determine their operation). This is needed because we need to know the variable \"race\" inside our instance. This determines whether the function returns true or false. The use of this colon states that, when this function is called, a &lt;a href=\"Lua%20Scope%23Function-local%20Variables\"&gt;function-local variable&lt;/a&gt; will be created. The variable will be named \"self\" and is a reference to the instance of the class. Thus, we can use the variable \"self.class\" to determine the class of that one particular character. The Lua reference manual states the following&lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:\nWe still have one problem, though. The instance of our class. While it is created by the Character table, it is not actually Character table itself, thus if we do the following:\n local me = Character:new();\n DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessage(me:isAlliance());\nThis will fail, because me:isAlliance is undefined (me.isAlliance is never created; only Character.isAlliance). This is where metatables come in. A metatable can tell a table where to find indexes that do not exist. Thus, we can use it to help find functions which appear to not exist. Specifically, we specify that the instance should look up unknown indexes in the table \"Character,\" so that when it tries to look for me.isAlliance, and does not find it, it will proceed by searching for Character.isAlliance, which does exist.\nThis is done via the metatable's \"__index\" field (note that is two underscores, not one). The __index field states that if a variable cannot be found, it will be searched for in the table specified by __index. Thus, we can do the following during creation:\n Character = {}; -- To create a class, we must make a table\n Character.__index = Character; -- Set the __index parameter to reference Character\n function Character:new()\n local self = {};\n setmetatable(self, Character); -- Set the metatable so we used Character's __index\n -- Imbue the class\n return self;\n end\n function Character:isAlliance()\n -- Perform calculation\n end\nNow, every instance of Character also has a way to access isAlliance(). Thus, we only create one copy of the function, so we save a lot of memory, but every character has a way to access that function and use it appropriately. Even more usefully, if another addon later hooks Character.isAlliance(), you will find that all instances will use the new, hooked function. This way, we don't have to modify every instance of the class.\nExample Class.\nThis is the fully written class we have created through the above methods. It has a constructor, creates the required fields, and gives each instance two functions: isAlliance and isHorde, which returns true if the character's race is set to an Alliance or Horde race, respectively. It also has a function load(), which loads data given a Unit ID via the Blizzard API.\n Character = {};\n Character.__index = Character;\n function Character:new()\n local self = {};\n setmetatable(self, Character);\n self.name = \"Unknown\";\n self.race = \"Unknown\";\n self.class = \"Unknown\";\n self.level = 0;\n return self;\n end\n function Character:load(uid)\n if ~UnitExists(uid) then\n return false;\n end\n self.name = UnitName(uid);\n self.race = UnitRace(uid);\n self.class = UnitClass(uid);\n self.level = UnitLevel(uid);\n return true;\n end\n function Character:isAlliance()\n if ( self.race == \"Human\" or\n self.race == \"Night Elf\" or\n self.race == \"Dwarf\" or\n self.race == \"Gnome\" or\n self.race == \"Draenei\"\n then return true;\n else return false;\n end\n end\n function Character:isHorde()\n if (self.race == \"Unknown\") then\n return false;\n else\n return ~self:isAlliance();\n end\n end\nAnd we can quickly use this class to get information about our 40 raid members, and store them in a table:\n local units = {};\n for x = 1, 40 do\n units[x] = Character:new();\n units[x]:load(\"raid\"..x);\n end\nDetails.\nCalling a member function using the dot operator (.) will not implicitly pass the parent table to the function.\n local table = {\n msg = \"Hello World\",\n func = function(self, a, b, c)\n print(self.msg)\n print(a)\n print(b)\n print(c)\n end,\n table.func(1,2,3) -- Results in the error, \"attempt to index local 'self' (a nil value)\"\n table:func(1,2,3) -- Results in the expected:\n -- Output --\n \"Hello World\"\n 1\n 2\n 3"}

The goal is 102.4% to make sure that every hit is either a Block, Parry, Dodge or Miss. (dodge % + parry % + block chance % + 5 % miss base). For both classes of shield tank, Paladin and Warrior, the consensus is that for fights with mostly physical damage, reaching the CTC cap by stacking mastery is a higher priority than dodge/parry or stamina. Beyond the CTC cap, many tanks move their gemming towards stamina, rather than the other option of higher dodge/parry.\nFor high magic damage fights (heroic &lt;a href=\"Yor%27sahj\"&gt;Yor'sahj&lt;/a&gt; has more than 70% of the total damage on the tank(s) as shadow damage), tanks ignore CTC cap and wear their max stamina set of gear. Some go so far as to regem to &lt;a href=\"Effulgent%20Shadowspirit%20Diamond\"&gt;Effulgent Shadowspirit Diamond&lt;/a&gt; for that fight and taking using &lt;a href=\"Prismatic%20Elixir\"&gt;Prismatic Elixir&lt;/a&gt;, as well as wearing both [[Mirror of Broken Images}} and [[Sindragosa's Flawless Fang#Heroic]].\nShowing current CTC can be done by typing the following in-game:\ncodice_1\nA longer version of that macro can total up your avoidance and net dmg reduction from dodge/parry/block, counting a block as reducing dmg by 31%, i.e. assuming [[Eternal Shadowspirit Diamond]] and no crit block. The net damage reduction part of the macro is most useful for paladins that aren't yet block capped, and still undervalues mastery because Holy Shield uptime isn't accounted for. Also, damage reduction from armor and from talents are separate. Modifications of this macro to make it more relevant for block capped tanks, and for warriors in general, are welcome.\ncodice_2\nBefore regemming gear to aim exactly for 102.4%, remember to get the relevant buffs that affect CTC: the food buff you normally raid with, 5% all stats ([[Mark of the Wild]] / [[Blessing of Kings]] / [[Will of the Emperor]]). Strength converts to a small amount of parry rating, so you need your raid-buffed strength to know where you stand exactly.\nReferences.\n[[Category:Acronyms]]\n[[Category:Game terms]]"}

{"id": "16722", "revid": "38791128", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=16722", "title": "CTMod", "text": "CTMod is a collection of &lt;a href=\"Addon\"&gt;user interface mods&lt;/a&gt; for World of Warcraft. It was originally developed during classic \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" and maintained by Cide and TS, who were the staff of the now-defunct website WoW.WarcraftStrategy.com. Others have since maintained the addon in subsequent expansions.\nCTMod was historically very popular for raiding in Vanilla (especially the CT_RaidAssist addon), and since continues to be used for its general interface improvements. It is committed to working \"with\" the existing UI wherever possible instead of replacing it, and historically there was interaction between CTMod's development team and the WoW developers. CTMod can boast that some features originally offered by CTMod were since been incorporated partially or fully into the main WoW program.\nOrganization.\nCTMod works by having a central core mod into which other mods can be added and removed, similar to web browser plug-ins. A user may have as many or as few components of CTMod beyond the main one installed as they like. Installing a component is as simple as loading the &lt;a href=\"AddOns\"&gt;addon&lt;/a&gt; containing it, and uninstalling simply means not loading the addon anymore. Components automatically register their options and control buttons with the main CTMod interface, thus keeping all controls for CTMod in one central location.\nHistory.\nOne part of CTMod, CT_RaidAssist (CTRA), was notable in early Vanilla as a precursor to &lt;a href=\"SecureGroupHeaderTemplate\"&gt;modern raid frames&lt;/a&gt;. Other features like the \"/raready\" slash command were replaced by game's own &lt;a href=\"Ready%20check\"&gt;/readycheck&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Patch_1.11.0\"&gt;Patch_1.11.0&lt;/a&gt;. With the launch of WoW Classic in 2019, the mod continues to be developed for both classic and retail editions.\nCTMod originally had its own website, ctmod.net, until sometime in 2019 when that website stopped being maintained due to ongoing problems with domain hijackers. Those looking for the addon and subsequent updates were then strongly encouraged to visit the addon's &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/ctmod\"&gt;webpage on CurseForge&lt;/a&gt;.\nOther works.\nCide and TS also worked on another project named CTScreens, which was a database for uploading screenshots. It was free registration, but only for a low number of screenshots. If you wanted more, you had to pay for \"Epic\" or \"Legendary\" access levels.\nPreviously, the CT Crew also maintained a site named &lt;a href=\"http%3A//ctprofiles.net/\"&gt;CTProfiles&lt;/a&gt;, however, this was brought down in late spring, early summer. The site was used for custom profile; the user could create their own character and add their own choice of items to many different profiles. Cide and TS say that CTProfiles was brought down because it was consuming too much of their time, which had originally been meant for the development of CTMod."}

Vorpil and Blackheart took refuge in the deeper tunnels of Auchindoun, and the Alliance left them to their own devices once &lt;a href=\"Teron%20Gorefiend\"&gt;Teron Gorefiend&lt;/a&gt; ported the leadership echelon to the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt;.\nIronically, despite Vorpil's pledge, the Cabal was to continue consorting with dark powers and remains as much an arm of the Shadow Council as it was during the days of &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nThese cultists are said to have summoned a great evil inside Auchindoun, &lt;a href=\"Murmur\"&gt;Murmur&lt;/a&gt;, which in turn caused the explosion that destroyed Auchindoun and flattened the surrounding forest creating the Bone Wastes.\nHowever, Murmur proved too hard to control and many are now fleeing Auchindoun. Several have gathered in and around the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Tomb\"&gt;Shadow Tomb&lt;/a&gt; where they are storing artifacts of power they took from Auchindoun. Among these are the sacred &lt;a href=\"Drape%20of%20Arunen\"&gt;Drape of Arunen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gavel%20of%20K%27alen\"&gt;Gavel of K'alen&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Scroll%20of%20Atalor\"&gt;Scroll of Atalor&lt;/a&gt; which belonged to powerful &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; patriarchs of each item's respective namesake; now the Cabal are using these artifacts for dark purposes. The Cabal has also taken &lt;a href=\"Akuno\"&gt;Akuno&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Broken\"&gt;Broken&lt;/a&gt; friend of &lt;a href=\"Mekeda\"&gt;Mekeda&lt;/a&gt;, hostage within the Shadow Tomb.\nA &lt;a href=\"caravan\"&gt;caravan&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Lower%20City\"&gt;Lower City&lt;/a&gt; has recently been attacked by the Cabal and they cannot move from their position. Although &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt;'s guards have arrived to help and protect them, they still fear that the Shadow Council could send another attack. They ask adventurers for aid.\nSpeculation.\nThe many &lt;a href=\"Broken\"&gt;Broken&lt;/a&gt; serving the Cabal might be degenerated remnants of the &lt;a href=\"Auchenai\"&gt;Auchenai&lt;/a&gt; who betrayed their brethren for the ranks of the &lt;a href=\"Sargerei\"&gt;Sargerei&lt;/a&gt; instead."}

It is implied that he would have survived if he had taken the &lt;a href=\"Pack%20Form\"&gt;Pack Form&lt;/a&gt;, but because of a promise to &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; to never take that form again, he did not. This caused her to turn against Malfurion and help Arvell's friend, &lt;a href=\"Ralaar%20Fangfire\"&gt;Ralaar Fangfire&lt;/a&gt;, create the &lt;a href=\"Scythe%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Scythe of Elune&lt;/a&gt;. After the newly created worgen went feral and attacked both satyr and night elf alike, Belysra realized her mistake and delivered the Scythe of Elune to Malfurion so that he could use it to seal the worgen in the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;.\nShe later travels with many night elves to &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20peninsula\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; after sensing a wrongness there involving the &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt;. She helped &lt;a href=\"Genn\"&gt;Genn&lt;/a&gt; to control his rage and retold him her story. During the attack on &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20City\"&gt;Gilneas City&lt;/a&gt;, she fought against &lt;a href=\"Alpha%20Prime\"&gt;Alpha Prime&lt;/a&gt; only to be rescued by the recently turned worgen &lt;a href=\"Halford%20Ramsey\"&gt;Halford Ramsey&lt;/a&gt;. After they escaped the city, &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Godfrey\"&gt;Lord Godfrey&lt;/a&gt; shoots Ramsey, and leaves them for dead. She managed to extract the bullet from Ramsey's body and brought him to &lt;a href=\"Tal%27doren\"&gt;Tal'doren&lt;/a&gt; where she was helping the worgen, &lt;a href=\"Darius%20Crowley\"&gt;Darius Crowley&lt;/a&gt;, among them.\nBelysra was found by the worgen adventurer who was looking for &lt;a href=\"Bradshaw\"&gt;Bradshaw&lt;/a&gt;. She warned him that he is followed by a &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Scout\"&gt;Dark Scout&lt;/a&gt;. With her help he killed her and then he was sent to Tal'doren. After recovering the &lt;a href=\"Scythe%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Scythe of Elune&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Valorn%20Stillbough\"&gt;Valorn Stillbough&lt;/a&gt; and later from the Forsaken who stole it, she once more battled the Alpha Prime. Belysra tried to banish Alpha Prime with the Scythe of Elune but before she could do so, a &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"dark%20ranger\"&gt;dark ranger&lt;/a&gt; shot her in the arm. This caused her to drop the &lt;a href=\"Scythe%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Scythe of Elune&lt;/a&gt;, and Alpha Prime signaled for the army of Forsaken to surround them. Alpha Prime took possession of the scythe, but just as he was about to finish Belysra off with it, the &lt;a href=\"spirit%20wolf\"&gt;spirit wolf&lt;/a&gt; of Belysra's old lover \u2014 \u2014 killed Alpha Prime. With the death of their leader, the &lt;a href=\"Wolf%20Cult\"&gt;Wolf Cult&lt;/a&gt; scattered; leaving the Forsaken without their lupine allies and open to attack from the night elves and Gilneans.\nShe then aided the Gilneans in defeating the Forsaken and later brought news of the events back to Malfurion as the Gilneans join the Alliance, appearing as a &lt;a href=\"priest%20trainer\"&gt;priest trainer&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Howling%20Oak\"&gt;Howling Oak&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nAfter the events in Gilneas, Belysra and Valorn traveled with the Scythe of Elune to Duskwood to further their studies of the worgen. On orders from they brought it to the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Grove\"&gt;Twilight Grove&lt;/a&gt; in Duskwood to give it to a druid &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; traveling from the &lt;a href=\"Dreamgrove\"&gt;Dreamgrove&lt;/a&gt;. However, Valorn was attacked from behind by &lt;a href=\"Ariden\"&gt;Ariden&lt;/a&gt;, and the Scythe was stolen, putting it in the hands of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Riders\"&gt;Dark Riders&lt;/a&gt; who had coveted it for so long.

She refused to leave the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Moon\"&gt;Temple of the Moon&lt;/a&gt; and continued to try to put out the fires.\nShe survived and was later encountered by &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; champions at &lt;a href=\"Shatterspear%20Vale\"&gt;Shatterspear Vale&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;.\nDragonflight.\nBelysra is seen standing right next to her daughter &lt;a href=\"Ishala\"&gt;Ishala&lt;/a&gt;, in the main building of Belanaar, &lt;a href=\"Amirdrassil\"&gt;Amirdrassil&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuotes.\nGossip.\nMy wisdom is yours, as is my knowledge.
