The fel offers great power, but feeds on life. In contrast to the light blue glow of &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; magic, fel magic glows a sickly green, and its corrupting effects can change whole creatures this color.\nHistory.\nBonds of Brotherhood.\nA warlord of a tribe of trolls wielded the fel magic. He was invulnerable to 's magic, but the Guardian used his magic to collapse the troll temple and kill the warlord. &lt;a href=\"Quelen\"&gt;Quelen&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Azeroth\"&gt;Guardian of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; once studied the fel. He discovered that: Fel is the magic of evil; It uses life as fuel; It changes the user permanently. According to , it made Quelen worry about his own actions, every moment, turned him into a scared, bitter recluse. Medivh believed that any power, no matter how entropic, can be used to good ends.\nWarcraft.\n experimented with the fel as a youth, believing he could control it, but was eventually poisoned and slowly corrupted. The fel would eventually take possession of him, forcing him to take actions against Azeroth, although he would afterwards lack memory of these events.\nIt was the fel that caused Medivh to consort with the orc warlock , and open the to bring the to Azeroth. The fel was discovered and recognised by in the corpse of a human slain by the orcs during their first attacks on the Eastern Kingdoms, who brought the news to Medivh. Medivh was initially unable to understand how the fel had come to poison Azeroth, and set about attempting to eradicate its presence, but as the corruption took deeper hold he began to become weaker, needing longer to regenerate more frequently. \nThe fel was wielded by Gul'dan to great effect. Gul'dan believed he was the only one able to control the fel, and set about sharing its corrupting effects with the orcs of his Horde, using his control of the magic. The fel seemed to make the orcs grow larger and stronger, but at the price of the corruption of their faculties. However, the fel did not entirely corrupt them; most still held to their values, including a respect for tradition, even going so far as to rebel against Gul'dan when he failed to respect the . The orcs were turned green by their exposure to the fel, and the lands around the orc encampment in the likewise began to grow sickly.\nWhile giving them great strength, the orcs' infection with the fel also makes them vulnerable to counters to the magic, as seen when Medivh used this knowledge to destroy the party of orcs in . When confronted with this weakness Gul'dan denied it, which may indicate that his knowledge of the fel is far more limited than that of Medivh, or he may simply have been refusing to admit the downsides to his 'gift'.\nIt was the fel that years earlier had begun to destroy the orcs' homeworld of , causing the climate to grown inhospitable and the plants and animals to grow sick and die.\nAfter doing his best to combat the spread of fel on Azeroth, Medivh was eventually overcome entirely and transformed by the fel into a demonic form. After he was defeated by Khadgar and , Khadgar was able to purge the fel from Medivh and the tower of , apparently displaying a strength of will beyond that of the Guardian. With the fel purged, Medivh was returned to his former state and regained control of his actions.\nForms.\nThe fel is seen in various forms. It is chiefly seen through its influence on the corrupted orcs, their skin turned green and their forms unnaturally large and powerful. Fel energy itself is seen in the magical font in the tower of , as 's corruption pollutes it.\nAfter the orcs travel to the Black Morass, bright green pockets of fel can be seen glowing in the swamp's marshy earth. Gul'dan also keeps a huge brazier of fel fire burning constantly in his tent by the Great Gate. When plunges his arm into the fel fire as punishment for his failure, it begins to spread up to the rest of his body. The fel fire does burning like regular fire, but eats his flesh like a living thing, curling up his arm like an invading army. When Durotan severs Blackhand's arm above the fel fire, the remaining portion falls to the ground, where it abruptly crumbles into scorched chunks.\nOrigins.\nThe origins of the fel are currently unknown. &lt;a href=\"Duncan%20Jones\"&gt;Duncan Jones&lt;/a&gt; explains that this may be expanded upon in future films:"}

As all warlocks know, summoned demons (other than the &lt;a href=\"Infernal%20%28warlock%20minion%29\"&gt;Infernal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Doomguard%20%28warlock%20minion%29\"&gt;Doomguard&lt;/a&gt;...well...maybe not the Doomguard) are more cuddly and fluffy than threatening and a Warlock can often find him/herself in the open without a demon to protect himself.\nSome warlocks call this the 'Oh Crap' maneuver..."}

It acts as the &lt;a href=\"Class%20Hall\"&gt;Order Hall&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"demon%20hunter\"&gt;demon hunter&lt;/a&gt;s. Once one of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s most valuable assets, this citadel was created to spearhead Legion invasions on other worlds. It was occupied by &lt;a href=\"Brood%20Queen%20Tyranna\"&gt;Brood Queen Tyranna&lt;/a&gt; and her forces, who were tasked by &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; himself with the safeguarding of the &lt;a href=\"Sargerite%20Keystone\"&gt;Sargerite Keystone&lt;/a&gt;. When the Illidari invaded Mardum to retrieve the Keystone, they defeated the \"Fel Hammer\"'s demonic inhabitants and conquered it in the name of their master, &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nIllidari assault on Mardum.\nAfter retrieving the Sargerite Keystone, the &lt;a href=\"demon%20hunter\"&gt;demon hunter&lt;/a&gt;s returned to the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt; while the rest of the Illidari stayed behind. These left behind Illidari have dutifully held this citadel since the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Slayer&lt;/a&gt;'s departure, but they have been unable to access most of its resources - the \"Fel Hammer\" could only be activated by those bearing the mark of a Legion lord. Thankfully, the blades of the Slayer carried that very mark, and as they activate the \"Fel Hammer\", all the Illidari forces appear and bow down again before the Slayer.\nLegion reinforcements arrived soon after the main Illidari forces and the Slayer returned to the Black Temple with the Sargerite Keystone in year 26, and destroyed the portal behind them. A glorious battle then ensued. In the aftermath, the Illidari uncovered an ancient Cursed Nathrezim Forge used to create many of the Legion's most powerful weapons. They've guarded it carefully ever since.\nLegion.\nThe \"Fel Hammer\" also houses a nether crucible - more powerful than any the Illidari had crafted before. The souls of the hundreds of slain demons in Mardum have provided the nether crucible with enough power to directly observe the Legion on Azeroth.

The first thing the demons did was disable the \"Fel Hammer\"'s weapons, allowing them to board unhindered.

Afterward, S'theno travels to the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt; to lead the team searching for materials to repair the ship.

{"id": "62825", "revid": "22514", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=62825", "title": "Fel Horde", "text": "The Fel Horde is the army of &lt;a href=\"fel%20orc\"&gt;fel orc&lt;/a&gt;s who first served the pit lord &lt;a href=\"Magtheridon\"&gt;Magtheridon&lt;/a&gt; and then the &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt;. They are headquartered in &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Citadel\"&gt;Hellfire Citadel&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe prime constituents (and only example available thus far) of the Fel Horde are fel orcs and the demons that control them.\nIt is revealed by &lt;a href=\"Caza%27rez\"&gt;Caza'rez&lt;/a&gt; that the Horde is researching a method to restore the fel orcs to their original state.\nHistory.\nThe Fel Horde was created after the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; sent &lt;a href=\"Magtheridon\"&gt;Magtheridon&lt;/a&gt; to the remnants of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, now called &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, where the &lt;a href=\"pit%20lord\"&gt;pit lord&lt;/a&gt; enslaved and corrupted the orcs with his blood, shattering their wills and ensuring that their minds could do little else but obey the Burning Legion. The Fel Horde was quick to establish its home in &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Citadel\"&gt;Hellfire Citadel&lt;/a&gt; and at Magtheridon's command struck out to claim other locations with important confluence of power. Foremost among them being the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt;, which Magtheridon personally took over as the staging ground for his campaign of conquest against the remnants of Outland.\nMeanwhile the survivors of the &lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Lothar\"&gt;Sons of Lothar&lt;/a&gt;, realizing that they couldn't defeat the pit lord and his armies, vowed to slow them down. Whenever the Fel Horde ventured deep into Outland, the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; was there to carve up their flanks and pick off any stragglers. The Fel Horde and Sons of Lothar would skirmish intermittently for years.\nThe Frozen Throne.\nIn the aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Vashj\"&gt;Lady Vashj&lt;/a&gt; arrived to the shattered realm and sought to seize Outland as their own. Illidan's first action against &lt;a href=\"Magtheridon%27s%20Forces\"&gt;Magtheridon's Forces&lt;/a&gt; was to seal the &lt;a href=\"Dimensional%20Gateway\"&gt;Dimensional Gateway&lt;/a&gt;s, his &lt;a href=\"Illidan%27s%20forces\"&gt;forces&lt;/a&gt; covered him in the process. The &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; aided by a group of draenei led by &lt;a href=\"Akama\"&gt;Akama&lt;/a&gt;, who pledged his allegiance to Illidan if he helped him to defeat the pit lord, maintained the battle against the Fel Horde while Illidan closed the portal.\nWith the Dimensional Gateways closed, the Fel Horde and their demonic masters were cut off from reinforcements, as Illidan's forces laid siege to the Black Temple and claimed it as their own. The Fel Horde was subsequently absorbed into Illidan's army.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nSometime following Illidan's conquest of Outland, he had Magtheridon imprisoned within Hellfire Citadel, where he used the pit lord and &lt;a href=\"The%20Maker\"&gt;The Maker&lt;/a&gt; to forcibly corrupt more orcs to boost his growing army, many of whom are unwilling.\nThe Fel Horde went to war against the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;Invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, adventurers killed &lt;a href=\"Kargath%20Bladefist\"&gt;Warchief Kargath Bladefist&lt;/a&gt; and brought &lt;a href=\"Warchief%20Kargath%27s%20Fist\"&gt;his fist&lt;/a&gt; to their faction's leadership in order to usher in the end of the Fel Horde's reign of terror. Ultimately, the adventurers delved deeper into &lt;a href=\"Magtheridon%27s%20Lair\"&gt;Magtheridon's Lair&lt;/a&gt;. There they slew the &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Channeler\"&gt;Hellfire Channeler&lt;/a&gt;s that were holding the &lt;a href=\"Annihilan\"&gt;pit lord&lt;/a&gt; captive, and ultimately slew &lt;a href=\"Magtheridon\"&gt;Magtheridon&lt;/a&gt; himself. Without Magtheridon's demon blood to taint Outland's orcish population, Illidan could no longer create new fel orcs, but others still operated within the ranks of the Illidari, namely the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Dragonmaw, &lt;a href=\"Bonechewer%20clan\"&gt;Bonechewer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20clan\"&gt;Shadowmoon&lt;/a&gt; were among the Fel Horde clans within the Black Temple, when it came under attack by the Horde, Alliance, and &lt;a href=\"Sha%27tar\"&gt;Sha'tar&lt;/a&gt; as they invaded the citadel and slew Illidan Stormrage.\nWhile the exact status of the Fel Horde after the Invasion of Outland is unknown, the &lt;a href=\"Negotiations%20Terminated\"&gt;revelation&lt;/a&gt; that the Dragonmaw clan independently left Outland for &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, does suggest that that the Fel Horde may have disbanded.\nClans of the Fel Horde.\nThe membership of the Fel Horde is largely the remnants of the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Horde of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, which was ruled by the shaman &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; during the time of the battles of the &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Invasion of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;. It should be noted that many (perhaps all) of the clans listed below are in fact divided, and do not universally support the Fel Horde. (For example, members of the Shattered Hand clan also reside in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; as its rogue's guild and dutifully serve &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;.) The Shattered Hand orcs that live in Orgrimmar, however, left Draenor twenty years ago and are not fel orcs (they still have green skins and the such).\nFor our purposes, however, large groups of orcs from the following clans have been captured, brought to &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Citadel\"&gt;Hellfire Citadel&lt;/a&gt; and become fel orcs, and now collectively obey Warchief Kargath Bladefist. While the former leaders of these old Horde clans did not all survive, some clans such as the Bonechewer clan and the Bleeding Hollow clan still operate under the dominance of their own clan-specific Chieftain as well as Kargath.\nSpeculation.\nAlthough the term Fel Horde has been used to refer to the orcs in Hellfire Peninsula and Hellfire Citadel, mainly the Shattered Hand clan, it is believed that the Fel Horde is a new term for all orcs affected by the demonic corruption that was being siphoned out of the &lt;a href=\"pit%20lord\"&gt;pit lord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Magtheridon\"&gt;Magtheridon&lt;/a&gt; and were loyal to Illidan Stormrage and his Illidari. It may be somewhat confirmed by the appearance of the Bonechewer and Shadowmoon orcs in the Hellfire Citadel. Illidan Stormrage had gathered tens of thousand fel orcs, apparently of various clans (and not just the Shattered Hand) that would eventually be the Fel Horde."}

This boss is a &lt;a href=\"gear%20check\"&gt;gear check&lt;/a&gt; for the bosses of the upper-wing. \nBackground.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"Speculated by some scholars of the Legion to be an evolved version of the common felguard, Fel Lords serve as enforcers in the direct service of &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt;. Their cruelty is matched only by their brute force. Zakuun was set to a task that called upon both of these traits in equal measure: breaking the iron will of a stubborn and defiant of the ...\"\nDesigner notes.\n\"This Fel Lord represents a type of demon never before seen by players. We approached this encounter with the intent that it be the \u201cPatchwerk\u201d of the zone\u2014that is to say, a heavy melee bruiser without companions\u2014but of course he has a few tricks up his sleeve that will keep players on their toes.\"\nOverview.\nZakuun alternates between attacking with his axe, and flinging it to the ground to strike with his fists, modifying his abilities in the process. Throughout the encounter, Zakuun attempts to form Fel Crystals, though players may prevent this process by absorbing the energy themselves. In either case, some of Zakuun's abilities will trigger a massive explosion if they strike either a Crystal or a player with absorbed Latent Energy.\nStrategy.\nThe fight requires two tanks. Bloodlust should be saved for the third and final phase. Fel Lord Zakuun should be tanked in one of the room's corners. \nPhase One: The main mechanic of this fight is the Rumbling Fissures/Fel Crystals. The boss will periodically create about 5 Rumbling Fissures in the ground (green-black swirls). A designated group of 4 players, preferably ranged and healers, should stand in 4 of the fissures, leaving one as far away from the group as possible, or in a corner. Those who absorb fissures will be affected by a debuff that lasts two minutes called Latent Energy. This debuff is important because if a player either gets hit with one of the Wake of Destruction shockwaves or tries to absorb another pillar while the debuff is active, they will explode and cause a massive amount of raid-wide damage. The raid may be able to tank one explosion when capped off, but multiple ones will wipe the raid. Wakes will spawn when Zakuun casts Cavitation, swinging his axe either behind him or to the side and sending out multiple wakes in one direction. As those who soaked the fissures are ranged and healers, they should have enough time to move away, but an explosion will also result if one of the wakes hits the Fel Crystals. Players without Latent Energy must move and soak the wakes with their bodies if the wakes are moving towards the crystals.\nTanks will swap when the boss casts Soul Cleave, sending one tank into the void for about 15 seconds. The disembodied tank must dodge and jump over the shadows and shockwaves until the debuff wears off and he comes back. When a tank leaves the void, they leave behind a shockwave-making ball of energy where they left. Thus, when the debuff is about to expire, stand far away from where the boss is being tanked. For healers, Zakuun casts Befoul, which is a healing-absorption debuff, on several non-tank players. This can be easily be healed through, but when the debuff expires, it creates aoe-damage to anyone within 6 yards, so those with Befoul should move away from the group to be healed. \nPhase 2: Zakuun throws his axe to the ground and gains Unarmed. Despite what one would expect, Zakuun now not only hits harder and faster, but also cleaves and hits two targets at once. If two targets are not hit by his unarmed blows, Zakuun hits the one target twice ala &lt;a href=\"Patchwerk\"&gt;Patchwerk&lt;/a&gt;. Both tanks need to stack up when Zakuun throws his axe and let the boss come to them, with melee staying behind him. Ranged and healers need to stack in a circle, with those who still have Latent Energy on the inside of the circle. Seeds of Destruction will be planted on several players, creating wakes in all directions once it expires. The circle is so that those with Latent Energy are protected by those who do not have it and can be more easily healed since Zakuun's discarded axe will be radiating raid-wide damage. Those with Seeds must drop the debuff as far away from the crystals as possible and/or have the group positioned between them and the crystals. After about 30 seconds, the phase ends and transitions back to phase 1 with Zakuun picking up his axe again. \nPhase 3: The boss begins using all of his abilities from phase 1 and 2 at once. Continue the circle strategy from phase 2, but be ready to move for both Befoul and Seeds of Destruction, in addition to blocking Cavitation from hitting the crystals. With so many wakes and movement, it is likely that at least one explosion will be triggered. Activate Bloodlust and use healing cooldowns wisely to endure any potential explosions until he goes down. \nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

Malfurion's casting had done more than simply keep it embedded; roots also grew within the wound, the wood feeding from the &lt;a href=\"satyr\"&gt;satyr&lt;/a&gt;'s very &lt;a href=\"Felblood\"&gt;lifefluids&lt;/a&gt;. The roots were now so much interwined with his system that whatever they felt, so, too, did Xavius. His claws turned gnarled, becoming tiny branches with burgeoning leaves. The satyr's horns spread out, growing into thick, higher branches from which foliage then sprouted. Xavius was not so much becoming a tree-rather, his body was providing Malfurion's creation with the nutrients and building blocks to make itself. All trace of the satyr vanished as the tree that the druid had creation from the wooden shaft took full bloom. Eventually Malfurion tore the remains of Xavius from Teldrassil. The &lt;a href=\"Bough%20of%20Corruption\"&gt;Bough of Corruption&lt;/a&gt;, the one last remnant of Xavius on Teldrassil, remained to torment the night elf people and is the source of the fel moss that has tainted the gnarlpine, the &lt;a href=\"timberling\"&gt;timberling&lt;/a&gt;s, and everything else. \n&lt;a href=\"Ursal%20the%20Mauler\"&gt;Ursal the Mauler&lt;/a&gt;, chieftain of the gnarlpine tribe, used the evil powers of the Fel Moss to drive them mad.\nSource.\nThis item drops from:\nAs a quest objective.\nThis item is an objective of &lt;a href=\"The%20Woodland%20Protector\"&gt;The Woodland Protector&lt;/a&gt;.\nCorrupting Influence.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Raene%20Wolfrunner\"&gt;Raene Wolfrunner&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tarindrella\"&gt;Tarindrella&lt;/a&gt;, Fel Moss one of the agents responsible for the recent corruption of most &lt;a href=\"Furbolg\"&gt;Furbolg&lt;/a&gt; tribes."}

It is the crystallized &lt;a href=\"Felblood\"&gt;blood of demons&lt;/a&gt;, but grows on &lt;a href=\"infernal\"&gt;infernal&lt;/a&gt;s as well.\nWhen hammered, felslate gives off tremendous energy and special anvils are required for blacksmithing. When smelted with one part felslate and two parts &lt;a href=\"Leystone%20Ore\"&gt;leystone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Demonsteel\"&gt;Demonsteel&lt;/a&gt; is produced.\nPlacing felslate inside one's body allows one to mine it. According to &lt;a href=\"Felsmith%20Nal%27ryssa\"&gt;Felsmith Nal'ryssa&lt;/a&gt;, \"To mine for felslate is to seek the very blood of demons. To improve at it, you must become part demon yourself.\" And, \"...three is the magic number. You do not want any less felslate in your body...and you CERTAINLY don't want any more.\" She then hammers three very small shards of felslate into the player's arm, with the final shard going in their wrist.\nAfter placing three pieces of felslate into your arm, Nal'ryssa warns \"you may experience some stray urges to burn worlds and sow chaos for the next week or so.\"\nIf one overloads their body with felslate, they can succumb to the will of &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, and become more demon than not as they are tempted to replace more of their body with felslate. For demons, the ore can be used to replace limbs, and even act as fully-functioning organs, such as a heart and eyes."}

The servants of the Burning Legion are a myriad of darkly motivated men and women, servants of some demonic will. Most of those who have become slaves to the Burning Legion have done so by following mystical paths that are not only perilous for one's body, but also for one's soul, as warlocks may bind them to their will and they become more and more evil as time passes.\nThe fel-sworn are those who have begun to transform due to their exposure to the energies of the Burning Legion. Their bodies have warped and twisted to take on a new shape as their souls become more and more evil. While they might start out resembling normal members of their race, their demonic features develop until they are terrifying beings, half humanoid and half demon.\nSome mutations include the ability to see in the dark or breathe fire. Other fel-sworn have been known to grow wings, talons, fangs, horns, or scaly hides. Some have even grown in size. Their ranks are often formed of former warlocks or those who have been exposed to fel poison or spells using fel energy."}

Obtaining them is the objective of a series of achievements. There are 28 known containers/NPCs that contain lost treasures, although some of these will provide one of a number of possible items. Almost all lost treasures are rare gear items, while a few are other useful items such as recipes. \nThe treasures of Pandaria are very similar, but count toward a separate set of achievements. Rather than providing a powerful item, many treasures grant &lt;a href=\"poor\"&gt;poor&lt;/a&gt; quality items (most with sell prices of around ), while others simply grant gold upon interacting with them. Interacting with these treasures also grants a substantial amount of experience, which can be increased by the &lt;a href=\"rested%20bonus\"&gt;rested bonus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Guild%20Battle%20Standard\"&gt;Guild Battle Standard&lt;/a&gt;s. While some of these treasures have entertaining flavor text, none serve any purpose. \nThere are also a number of others items found throughout Pandaria that function very similarly to treasures, but which do not count toward either set of achievements.\nEach container (be it for a lost treasure, treasure or similar item) can be looted/interacted with only once per character. The containers themselves are not character-specific and will periodically respawn, but characters who have already gained credit for them will not be able to see them. All lost treasure and treasure items are either &lt;a href=\"bind%20on%20pickup\"&gt;bind on pickup&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"bind%20to%20account\"&gt;bind to account&lt;/a&gt;.\nAchievements.\nAlthough it is possible to find the same treasures on multiple characters, these achievements require the stated number of \"different\" treasures to have been found. Finding the same treasure multiple times will not therefore help to earn these achievements.\nList.\nListed below are all of the treasures and lost treasures found throughout Pandaria. Those listed under 'other items' are treasure-like items that count toward neither set of achievements.\nCoordinates marked with an asterisk (*) are approximate -- there are several spawn locations for the respective object. More details can be found on that object's article.\nTrivia.\nWhile most of the treasures correspond in some degree to the past inhabitants of the zone in which they are found, each of the lost treasures found in the &lt;a href=\"Dread%20Wastes\"&gt;Dread Wastes&lt;/a&gt; appears to belong to one of the ten awaken-able &lt;a href=\"Klaxxi\"&gt;Klaxxi&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"paragon\"&gt;paragon&lt;/a&gt;s."}

Yet that simple mechanism is employed in many different manners on the battlefield.\nWhirlwind Trebuchet.\nWhirlwind trebuchets are built around a central support pole with the axle sitting atop it on a pivot. This allows the whirlwind trebuchet to be turned in a wide arc to be quickly aimed at new targets, but also restricts it to lighter projectiles. The crew of a whirlwind trebuchet is made up of a commander and six \"runners\" who load the weapon and then pull the ropes on the far end of the lever arm to throw the projectile.\nTiger Trebuchet.\nThe tiger trebuchet was given its nickname by &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; who watched &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; projectiles tear through their fortifications in the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt; \"like unstoppable beasts.\" The lever arm of a tiger trebuchet is mounted to an axle atop a large triangular frame. After being loaded by a dedicated group of four crewmen, more than twenty-five \"runners\" pull the trebuchet's cords to fire the weapon. The legs of a tiger trebuchet are commonly set into the earth to give it additional stability, allowing it to fire heavier projectiles that can do tremendous damage.\nSiege Trebuchet.\nThe biggest siege weapon seen on the battlefield is the siege trebuchet, an enormous machine standing more than forty feet tall that can take even experienced crews several hours to assemble. A large, steel-bound box filled with several tons of earth and stones counterweights the massive projectiles thrown by the siege trebuchet, and single shots have been known to punch straight through thick city walls."}

He also had adventurers bring him troll temper from &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Farrak\"&gt;Zul'Farrak&lt;/a&gt; as he wanted to use it on his craft.\nHaving been obsessed with the sand trolls and Sul'thraze, a mythical sword made by them for years, Trenton got a crew together to go to Sandsorrow Watch and look for it after the Cataclysm. They kicked the trolls out of one of their camps and set up shop there. While there, he had help from Mazoga, working together on restoring the blade, but Mazoga betrayed him and escaped to Zul'Farrak. Realizing that his hunt for Sul'thraze has blinded him, he wanted to end his search for the blade.\nHe is also the master of the tower and has a jagged scar across his face. Some time after the Cataclysm, Trenton and his three goblin friends were visited by &lt;a href=\"Aramar%20Thorne\"&gt;Aramar Thorne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Makasa%20Flintwill\"&gt;Makasa Flintwill&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Taryndrella\"&gt;Taryndrella&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Murky%20%28Traveler%29\"&gt;Murky&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Hackle\"&gt;Hackle&lt;/a&gt;. He allowed them to sleep here. Since Aram knew a bit about blacksmithing, the two forged a new harpoon for Makasa. Trenton also gifted Aram a new iron chain for his compass, so he could replace the old, broken one. He also added a few, new iron spurs to Hackle's war club and gave a small pouch of apples to Drella.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, Trenton was visited by &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zekhan\"&gt;Zekhan&lt;/a&gt;. The troll asked him what he was doing in the desert, so far from &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;. He just scoffed and explained he spent his time searching for the blade Sul'thraze."}

The loot for Normal mode equals or surpasses 10-man &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt; drops in some slots. The loot for Heroic mode equals or surpasses 10-man Ulduar drops in some slots. Its difficulty should not be underestimated: Trial of the Champion is by no means a \"get epics quick\" scheme for under-geared players.\nBackground.\nDungeon Journal.\n\"Clouds blankets the skies of Icecrown and heroes gather beneath battle-worn banners in preparation for the coming storm. They say that even the darkest cloud has a silver lining. It is hope that drives the men and women of the Argent Crusade: hope that the Light will see them through these trying times, hope that good will triumph over evil, hope that a hero blessed by the Light will come forth to put an end to the Lich King's dark reign.\"\nBosses.\nThe dungeon progresses in a linear fashion, but with a different encounter set based on the player's faction:\nThe first encounter pits the player's party against three champions of the opposite faction:\nThe second encounter is three packs of three trash mobs, followed by one of either:\nFinally, all parties will face the 'surprise' encounter of:\nGrand Champions Encounter.\nThis encounter is done on the Argent Warhorse. To mount the warhorse the player must have a lance equipped. Lances can be found at the entrance of the Dungeon. The encounter starts with some Role Play with the herald introducing the players and the Champions. As of Patch 3.2.2, if everyone in the group has seen the event since said patch, you have an option to skip the event. The fight consists of 4 \"packs\". \nThe first three packs can be considered \"trash\" and consist of three groups of three mounted mobs of the race of the three representing Factions. The fourth pack are the three Champions.\nThe trash is handled easily by focusing on one mob at the time (mark them out). If all 5 players can charge in on the same initial target, it should go down quickly after if not already at the 5th charge because of javelins throws (2) of the first chargers. Try and focus on the same second target and the trash mobs should go down pretty easy. Make sure you keep up your shield (3 stacks) at all time during this encounter. Note that, if your mount is killed and you are dismounted, you can obtain a fresh mount provided you stay alive long enough to reach one. Positioning yourself near a fresh mount when you're about to be dismounted helps.\nWhen the three trash packs are down, the three Champions will attack your group. Basically this is the same deal: all focus on one target and they should go down. The difference is that they have more health and use more shields than the trash.\nNote that when you take down a Champion, he will try to get back on one of the mounts on the outside. You can prevent him from doing that by simply running over him with your mount. All three Champions must be downed at the same time before you can engage the Champions in normal combat. To do this agree on one person to stand on the first downed Champion, so he gets knocked down the moment he tries to get up (just standing still on a Champion is enough to knock them down again). Same goes for the second Champion.\nOnce all three are down, you are going to be dismounted. The champions will walk to their gate and reset. Now, equip your normal weapon again (important) and engage the Champions. \nNone of the Champions are susceptible to any form of &lt;a href=\"Crowd%20Control\"&gt;Crowd Control&lt;/a&gt;, except stuns and silence effects such as a Priest's &lt;a href=\"Silence\"&gt;Silence&lt;/a&gt; or a Mage's &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Counterspell\"&gt;Improved Counterspell&lt;/a&gt;.\nBy and large, the following order should be followed to ensure a smooth victory;\nArgent Champion Encounter.\nThe next phase will feature three trash packs, followed by one of either &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Confessor%20Paletress\"&gt;Argent Confessor Paletress&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Eadric%20the%20Pure\"&gt;Eadric the Pure&lt;/a&gt;. The trash packs consist of one &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Priestess\"&gt;Argent Priestess&lt;/a&gt;, one &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Lightwielder\"&gt;Argent Lightwielder&lt;/a&gt; and one &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Monk\"&gt;Argent Monk&lt;/a&gt; each.\nOn the whole, the kill order should be Priestess &gt; Lightwielder &gt; Monk - on heroic mode, the Monk will channel a spell that reduces cast and attack times by 70% when he is 'killed'. \nThis shield, and the effect, can be broken by &lt;a href=\"Mass%20Dispel\"&gt;Mass Dispel&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Shattering%20Throw\"&gt;Shattering Throw&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce all three trash packs are dealt with, the boss (whichever one you ended up with) will become hostile and attack.\nEadric the Pure.\n&lt;a href=\"Eadric%20the%20Pure\"&gt;Eadric the Pure&lt;/a&gt; needs to be controlled quickly as his passive buff, \"Vengeance\", causes his attacks to crit quite often, and he can quickly kill a healer or ranged DPS if the tank isn't quick enough picking him up. Once engaged it is a relatively simple tank-and-spank encounter. He will make use of two moves during the fight;\nOnce reduced to 1 health, Eadric will run to the center of the arena, place his loot chest, and then flee.\nArgent Confessor Paletress.\nOnce hostile, she will begin casting &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Fire\"&gt;Holy Fire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Smite\"&gt;Holy Smite&lt;/a&gt; at random party members; both of these, as well as her rather powerful &lt;a href=\"Renew\"&gt;Renew&lt;/a&gt;, can be counterspelled and interrupted, so do so when possible. Her Renew can also be dispelled from her or her summoned add, and since it ticks for 15-20k, it's advisable to do so.\nWhen she is first reduced to 50% she will knockback and stun all party members and summon an add, \"Memory of X\" - where X is a randomly selected boss from seemingly anywhere in the game, including &lt;a href=\"Ignis%20the%20Furnace%20Master\"&gt;Ignis the Furnace Master&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Edwin%20VanCleef\"&gt;Edwin VanCleef&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hogger\"&gt;Hogger&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Vashj\"&gt;Lady Vashj&lt;/a&gt; and others.\nRegardless of what the add may resemble it will have only a few basic attacks; a magical debuff (+90% cast times), a party-wide Fear (\"which can be resisted through &lt;a href=\"Berserker%20Rage\"&gt;Berserker Rage&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Fear%20Ward\"&gt;Fear Ward&lt;/a&gt;, or removed through trinkets/spells/racials, but cannot be interrupted during the casting\") and melee attacks.\nOnce summoned, all DPS should focus on killing the add and ignore Paletress, as she will throw up a shield protecting her from harm and returning 25-50% of all damage dealt to her to the caster. This shield will vanish when the add is slain and she can then be defeated.\nNote that even whilst shielded, moves such as &lt;a href=\"Taunt\"&gt;Taunt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Command\"&gt;Dark Command&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Growl\"&gt;Growl&lt;/a&gt; (from a Druid) and &lt;a href=\"Death%20Grip\"&gt;Death Grip&lt;/a&gt; will still work to direct her focus at the tank for a short while, which can help keep damage away from the rest of the group.\nAs with &lt;a href=\"Eadric%20the%20Pure\"&gt;Eadric the Pure&lt;/a&gt;, once reduced to 1\u00a0hp, she will run to the center of the arena, place her loot cache, and leave.\nThe Black Knight.\nWhen the party asks their herald to begin the fight after &lt;a href=\"Eadric%20the%20Pure\"&gt;Eadric&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Confessor%20Paletress\"&gt;Paletress&lt;/a&gt; are defeated, he will point to the edge of the arena and state \"Wait... what's that, up in the rafters?\"\nA short RolePlay session will begin where the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Knight\"&gt;Black Knight&lt;/a&gt;, atop a &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Gryphon\"&gt;Bone Gryphon&lt;/a&gt;, flies into the arena, kills the Herald (\"&lt;a href=\"Arelas%20Brightstar\"&gt;Arelas Brightstar&lt;/a&gt; for Alliance or &lt;a href=\"Jaeren%20Sunsworn\"&gt;Jaeren Sunsworn&lt;/a&gt; for Horde\") for ruining his \"grand entrance\" and engages the party in a three-phase fight. In the first two phases he will have one or more &lt;a href=\"Ghoul\"&gt;Ghoul&lt;/a&gt; pets - be aware that these can all use Explode much like the ability given to players affected by &lt;a href=\"Raise%20Ally\"&gt;Raise Ally&lt;/a&gt;, and on heroic mode this damage can be quite devastating.\nThrough the first two phases, he will lay the standard Death Knight diseases (&lt;a href=\"Frost%20Fever\"&gt;Frost Fever&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Plague\"&gt;Blood Plague&lt;/a&gt;) on his target, as well as spawning &lt;a href=\"Desecrated%20Ground\"&gt;Desecrated Ground&lt;/a&gt; periodically. The damage from this is ignorable with a good group but a slightly less geared group may wish to drag him out of it to minimise the amount of stress-related hair-loss inflicted on the healer.\nIn Phase 1, the Black Knight, returned from the dead, appears as a &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; in his old armour. He will raise the body of the slain Herald from the dead as a Ghoul which will also engage the party; the tank must be aware of this to pick him up so he doesn't kill your healer. The Ghoul is not elite, and a solid melee DPS can easily 'tank' him if needed - but all DPS should focus on it to kill it fast enough that it does not explode, especially if you want the heroic-only achievement, . Once the Ghoul is defeated, the party can then kill the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Knight\"&gt;Black Knight&lt;/a&gt;. Hm, that seemed too easy... oh, never mind, he's getting up again!\nThis guy doesn't know when to give up. In Phase 2, the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Knight\"&gt;Black Knight&lt;/a&gt; will rise as a &lt;a href=\"Skeleton\"&gt;Skeleton&lt;/a&gt; and instantly spawn an &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Dead\"&gt;Army of the Dead&lt;/a&gt;. There are two strategies here.\nYou can kill either the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Knight\"&gt;Black Knight&lt;/a&gt; or the Army first, but if you kill him first, all the remaining ghouls will explode after a short time all together, so it's advisable to AoE them down, especially if you're going for the achievement.\nOnce the Army of the Dead is dealt with and the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Knight\"&gt;Black Knight&lt;/a&gt; is dead once again, you're on to phase 3.\nThird time's the charm - the Black Knight gets back to his... er, ghostly remnants of feet and comes at you a final time. There are no adds to deal with in this final phase, but he will constantly deal damage to all party members, so spells like &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Sacrifice\"&gt;Divine Sacrifice&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Hand%20of%20Sacrifice\"&gt;Hand of Sacrifice&lt;/a&gt; will help the party or a single, particularly fragile, party member alive. One party member will also be afflicted by \"Marked for Death\" - the healer MUST keep their eyes open here as Marked for Death will increase their magical damage taken by 200% and this can very quickly result in their death if not watched for. Other than that, it is a tank-and-spank fight. When slain this third and final time, he stays dead, and you can collect your loot from the blackened orb he leaves behind like any other &lt;a href=\"Wraith\"&gt;Wraith&lt;/a&gt;.\nNote, if the &lt;a href=\"Desecration\"&gt;Desecration&lt;/a&gt; effect from Phase 2 is still present when he resurrects, move out of it quickly, as it will lay you to waste in very short order when coupled with Marked for Death.\nIf you have a Priest, Druid or Shaman healer, the easiest way to get through this phase is often to have all party members gather as close to the boss as possible and have the healer chain-cast group heals such as &lt;a href=\"Prayer%20of%20Healing\"&gt;Prayer of Healing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chain%20Heal\"&gt;Chain Heal&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Wild%20Growth\"&gt;Wild Growth&lt;/a&gt;, with the occasional focused heal for whoever's afflicted with Marked for Death.\nLoot.\nHeroic mode.\n\"On heroic mode, each encounter includes an &lt;a href=\"Emblem%20of%20Triumph\"&gt;Emblem of Triumph&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Champion%27s%20Seal\"&gt;Champion's Seal&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

Once there, use the Shrine Bauble.\nYou must speak with &lt;a href=\"Tajarri\"&gt;Tajarri&lt;/a&gt; at the shrine afterwards in order to complete the trial.\nDescription.\nFor your first trial, search the depths of Lake Elune'ara to locate a Shrine Bauble. It decays rapidly, so proceed with it to the Shrine of Remulos post haste. Use the bauble at the shrine, and then speak with Tajarri there; she is one of Moonglade's most trusted wardens.\nYou only have a set amount of time to complete the task, and you may be competing against other &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s searching for baubles themselves. Mental and physical dexterity will be critical to your success.\nGood luck, &lt;name&gt;.\nRewards.\nYou will receive:\nProgress.\nTo complete the Trial of the Lake, you must use the Shrine Bauble within the boundaries of this shrine. Until you do so, your trial remains unfinished and it is at risk of failure.\nCompletion.\nWell now, it looks like yet another druid has successfully completed the Trial of the Lake! Well done, my young friend - well done.\nAs I've said, my name is Tajarri. It is my duty and my privilege to serve as a warden for &lt;a href=\"Moonglade\"&gt;Moonglade&lt;/a&gt;, and specifically this shrine. &lt;a href=\"Keeper%20Remulos\"&gt;Keeper Remulos&lt;/a&gt; guides the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; in preservation of nature and balance, and his shrine serves as a lasting tribute to such. By using the bauble here, it serves as a nod to the importance of this place within the Circle.\nNotes.\nThe quest has a timer of 30 minutes.\nThe Shrine bauble appears as a small urn at the bottom of the lake. Its location is random, so some searching is necessary.\nAt the bottom of the lake, you will also discover bubbling fissures. While you are in the immediate area of such a fissure, you can regain your breath. It is useful, therefore, to swim down to one of these, get a full breath, then go off searching.\nThe Shrine of Remulos is to the west of the lake. You should have no problems finding it before time runs out. Tajarri is just north of the shrine."}

The next day Garithos sent an &lt;a href=\"Emissary%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;emissary&lt;/a&gt; that ordered all of Kael's cavalry, artillery and support troops to pull back to the west at the Front Line, leaving Kael and his &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Elf\"&gt;Blood Elves&lt;/a&gt; virtually defenseless. The large Undead force, commanded by the dreadlord &lt;a href=\"Dalvengyr\"&gt;Dalvengyr&lt;/a&gt;, quickly overran the Blood Elves' outlying bases; Kael and his warriors were surrounded and they didn't know what to do, but then Vashj and the Naga appeared, in desperation, Kael again entered in a pact with Vashj. With the aid of the Naga, the Blood Elves defended their last base and turned the tide against the Undead. First they recovered one of their outlying bases with a gold mine. They continued fighting the Undead and retook the other outlying bases one by one. Finally, the Blood Elves and Naga stormed Dalvengyr's base, slew the dreadlord, and obliterated his remaining forces. \nKael thanked Vashj for her aid, but feared that he had incurred the wrath of Garithos. Vashj encouraged Kael to abandon his prejudiced human commander and lead his people to a destiny of power and glory. Kael then told Vashj that ever since &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; had been destroyed, he and his people had been suffering from a strange, unexplainable hunger. Vashj explained that this hunger was brought about by their addiction to magic. Now that the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt; had been destroyed, Kael and his people had been cut off from their ancient source of power. Kael was horrified. Without a new source of magic, his people were doomed to an existence of mortality. Vashj suggested that Kael seek out demon magic. Kael balked at this idea but before they could go any further, Kael learned that Garithos was returning from the front. Kael told Vashj to leave before Garithos saw them.\nWith the bulk of the Alliance troops on his side, Garithos had been able to force the enemy into retreat; however, returning to Dalaran he and his knights spotted several Naga warriors slithering to safety, and, infuriated, he accused Kael and his men of being traitors. Kael tried to explain his actions, but Garithos ignored him and had Kael and all of his Blood Elves arrested and jailed in Dalaran's dungeons to await execution. \nLady Vashj and her Naga minions watched all this in hiding.\nLoading screen.\n\"The next day, at the Alliance base camp, Prince Kael'thas and his men ready themselves to move out.\"\nQuests.\nMain Quests.\nCrush and Destroy.\n\"From the shadows, Dalvengyr commands his Undead Scourge to surround your encampment.

While ranting that he was determined to prove his brother wrong, that he was free of the demons and powerful, a cold voice sneered at him. Illidan turned to face his taunter, and found himself facing a &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;mysterious human&lt;/a&gt; clad in ornate armour and armed with a deadly &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;runeblade&lt;/a&gt;. Illidan challenged the warrior to face him and they charged into battle. After an evenly matched duel, Illidan asked the human what he truly desired. Arthas explained that the leader of the undead in Felwood was the dreadlord, &lt;a href=\"Tichondrius\"&gt;Tichondrius&lt;/a&gt;. The dreadlord possessed an artifact known as the &lt;a href=\"Skull%20of%20Gul%27dan\"&gt;Skull of Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;, which was responsible for the corruption of the forests. Illidan surmised that Arthas wanted him to steal the artifact, which Arthas justified as serving a &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;master&lt;/a&gt; who would benefit from the Legion's downfall. Illidan asked why he should believe a word of this, to which Arthas replied that his master knew of Illidan's hunger for power and that now so much was almost in his grasp. Tempted, Illidan agreed, and Arthas departed to return to &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;.\nAssembling an army of loyal elves, Illidan fell upon the demons guarding the skull and slaughtered them all. With the skull in his possession, the demons could no longer corrupt the forest, but Illidan surmised if he were to claim the skull's power for himself, he would become more powerful than any of Archimonde's lieutenants, Illidan 'consumed' the skull's power and became a monstrous beast, half night elf, half demon and imbued with terrible demonic powers. Reassembling his army, Illidan assaulted Tichondrius's compound. The dreadlord was caught offguard by this attack, and astounded when he came under attack from the demonic beast that was Illidan. Though powerful, Tichondrius was no match for Illidan's new-found powers, and he slew the dreadlord with ease.\nIn the aftermath of the battle, Tyrande and Furion arrived at the compound. Seeing only this monstrous creature before them, Furion demanded to know what the demon had done with his brother. When Illidan revealed his true identity, it was met with horror from Tyrande and disgust from Furion. Though Illidan justified his actions with the death of Tichondrius, robbing the undead of their leader, and assuring that the forests would heal in time, Furion was outraged that Illidan had sold his soul for such power, and told him to be gone from Ashenvale and never return. With a final sneer of \"So be it...brother\", Illidan departed without a backwards glance.\nQuests.\nMain Quests.\nThe Skull of Gul'dan.\n\"You must retrieve the Skull of Gul'dan from the Demons. It is the source of Ashenvale's corruption, and its potent Warlock energies augment Tichondrius' already considerable powers.\"\nDestroy Tichondrius.\n\"If the Undead Scourge is to be stopped and the Demons' plans thwarted, the Dreadlord Tichondrius must die.

You must have completed &lt;a href=\"A%20Different%20Approach%20%28BC%20Classic%29\"&gt;A Different Approach (BC Classic)&lt;/a&gt; in order to get this quest. \nThe robot control panel is rather an user-unfriendly and tricky interface.\nObjectives.\nUse the &lt;a href=\"Robotron%20Control%20Unit\"&gt;Robotron Control&lt;/a&gt; while standing near the &lt;a href=\"Concealed%20Control%20Panel\"&gt;Concealed Command Console&lt;/a&gt; hidden in a small cluster of bushes on the rim of the needle closest to &lt;a href=\"Thalanaar\"&gt;Thalanaar&lt;/a&gt; to take command of a &lt;a href=\"Robotron%203000\"&gt;Robotron 3000&lt;/a&gt;. Pilot the robot to the western edge of &lt;a href=\"Thousand%20Needles\"&gt;Thousand Needles&lt;/a&gt; where the Alliance outpost of Thalanaar is located.

I didn\u2019t say I was going to send you to &lt;a href=\"Thalanaar\"&gt;Thalanaar&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s &lt;a href=\"moonwell\"&gt;moonwell&lt;/a&gt; out in the open with dipper and a flask.\nI\u2019ve been, err...tinkering with a product I was transporting for a client. In fact, I\u2019ve already set up a portable control console for the Robotron out near &lt;a href=\"Thalanaar\"&gt;Thalanaar&lt;/a&gt;.

Chalk up another one for good old goblin ingenuity!\nThe only problem is that it's hopelessly covered in dust!

You have to climb on the rim to use the portable control console with the concealed command console. To climb on the rim, go to the east side of it, and walk up the edge (11,18). Then follow the rim around to the console and stand near it.\nIf you have a pet, you will need to dismiss it first. While you control the Robotron, it acts as a pet, and you can\u2019t have two pets active.\nOnce you activate the portable control console (&lt;a href=\"Robotron%20Control%20Unit\"&gt;Robotron Control Unit&lt;/a&gt;), you will gain control of the Robotron. Run him over to &lt;a href=\"Thalanaar\"&gt;Thalanaar&lt;/a&gt;, climb into the &lt;a href=\"moonwell\"&gt;moonwell&lt;/a&gt;, and click on \"Gather Water,\" a move on the pet action bar. A vial with moonwell water will appear in your bags.\nOnce the timer runs out on the Robotron or right-clicking on the \u201cRobotron 3000\u201d buff (to dispel it), you will regain control of your character. Run back to &lt;a href=\"Wizlo%20Bearingshiner\"&gt;Wizlo Bearingshiner&lt;/a&gt; to complete the quest."}

It has a roughly 80% chance to contain &lt;a href=\"A%20Thoroughly%20Read%20Copy%20of%20%22Nat%20Pagle%27s%20Guide%20to%20Extreme%20Anglin%27.%22\"&gt;A Thoroughly Read Copy of \"Nat Pagle's Guide to Extreme Anglin'.\"&lt;/a&gt;, one of the needed items for &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s to acquire a hidden artifact skin for the Retribution-specialization artifact weapon, &lt;a href=\"Ashbringer%20%28artifact%29\"&gt;Ashbringer (artifact)&lt;/a&gt;.\nKnown &lt;a href=\"Spawn\"&gt;Spawn&lt;/a&gt; points:\nDM North:\nDM East:\nDM West:\nPre 1.10 Solo Method.\nThe first solo farmable tome is in the very first courtyard, when you enter DM West via the left door. Walk to the wall on your left and look North. You can check for the book using some sort of vision ability (&lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Kilrogg%20%28warlock%20ability%29\"&gt;Eye of Kilrogg (warlock ability)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mind%20Vision\"&gt;Mind Vision&lt;/a&gt;... or just buy an &lt;a href=\"Ornate%20Spyglass\"&gt;Ornate Spyglass&lt;/a&gt;). If you're using an Ornate Spyglass, press the crouch button so as to obtain a better overview. You will see two benches and three to four &lt;a href=\"Petrified%20Treant\"&gt;Petrified Treant&lt;/a&gt;s walking around (they're the little trees). Look for a small red book lying on the ground where they walk, between the deer and bear statues. Perhaps one in seven instances have a book there. (Note that Terrain Distance, under Video Options, can be an issue when using a spyglass).\nTo obtain the book, simply run across the courtyard, avoiding the patrols (this takes a bit of practice, but isn't very difficult.) Distract the four Petrified &lt;a href=\"Treant\"&gt;Treant&lt;/a&gt;s somehow\u2014AE &lt;a href=\"fear\"&gt;fear&lt;/a&gt;, pet &lt;a href=\"tank\"&gt;tank&lt;/a&gt;ing, or something along those lines\u2014loot it, and run.\nSoloing the Lethtendris book.\n\"This solo method requires you to have &lt;a href=\"stealth\"&gt;stealth&lt;/a&gt;, in other words being a &lt;a href=\"Rogue\"&gt;Rogue&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"Druid\"&gt;Druid&lt;/a&gt; helps a lot.\" \nYou start off in the \"short cut\" way in DM East. From here go straight ahead and jump up on the highened edge - do NOT jump down. Follow the edge, until you come to the place where you say goodbye to the trees and enter the &lt;a href=\"Demon\"&gt;Demon&lt;/a&gt;s whereabouts; you take the right turn when you meet the wall and sees a hallway on your right. Beware when you've come this far, there is a &lt;a href=\"Wildspawn%20Shadowstalker\"&gt;Wildspawn Shadowstalker&lt;/a&gt; patrolling the area, and he can see through your &lt;a href=\"stealth\"&gt;stealth&lt;/a&gt;. When he has passed, go right and through the door and to the far end of the room. You will see some kind of stairway going to the upper floor. Follow that, and you will soon see &lt;a href=\"Lethtendris\"&gt;Lethtendris&lt;/a&gt; and her imp, &lt;a href=\"Pimgib\"&gt;Pimgib&lt;/a&gt;. In the furthest left corner of this floor, there is a &lt;a href=\"spawn\"&gt;spawn&lt;/a&gt; point for the book. Either it's there, or you will have to reset and have another go. When finished, either empty handed or with a book of some kind, die or run out and reset the &lt;a href=\"instance\"&gt;instance&lt;/a&gt;. However, you can only be in 5 &lt;a href=\"instance\"&gt;instance&lt;/a&gt;s per hour, so beware!\nAlternate strategy.\n\"This solo method also requires you to have &lt;a href=\"stealth\"&gt;stealth&lt;/a&gt;, in other words being a &lt;a href=\"Rogue\"&gt;Rogue&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"Druid\"&gt;Druid&lt;/a&gt; helps a lot.\" \nYou start off in the \"back door\" way in DM East (via the pavilion north of Camp Mojache). Once in the first big room, hug left wall to avoid popping the warpwood pod at the tree root. Once cleared the 2 roaming lashers, strafe right to center line of the room, line up to the warpwood pod in front. The goal is to avoid popping another warpwood pod (to your left by the 3 demons) and aggroing a Shadowstalker (to your right). Once at the other 2 roaming lashers, strafe right and aim directly at the leftmost visible demon at the end of the room. The goal here is to avoid popping the warpwood pods to the left (the one you originally aimed at) and to the right (hidden behind the big tree root). Watch the lashers and avoid bumming into them. 2-3 steps before bumping into the demon you are aiming at, strafe left to aim at the tunnel. Move into the tunnel. The tunnel has 1 roaming level 56 elite (usually) Shadowstalker that you will HAVE to kill. Should be easy for any level 60 rogue or druid. Go through the rest of the tunnel and turn left into the next demon room. Aim at the center of the ramp and walk straight through the room. There are warpwood pods first to the left (between the first single demon and the first lasher) and then to the right (under the gazebo), so keep a tight line. Before the last pillar, strive right and go around the pillar. There is another roaming Shadowstalker that comes up from the circular ramp to under the Lethtendris ramp and it will aggro if you get too close. Go up the Lethtendris ramp and you should see Lethtendris and her pet imp. Check the spot at the corner of the platform for the book (visible as soon as you come up the ramp). Whether it is there or not, continue on the platform and head back the direction you came. Jump down when done and return the same way."}

It is accessed via a crack in the ice following the &lt;a href=\"Path%20of%20the%20Titans\"&gt;Path of the Titans&lt;/a&gt;. It is a raid dungeon with both 10 and 25-player normal and heroic modes.\nThe dungeon's release was delayed until patch &lt;a href=\"3.3.5a\"&gt;3.3.5a&lt;/a&gt; was released in Europe, a week after the US release, in an effort to make sure all players world-wide could access it at the same time. Even so, a large number of both US and EU realms were down for a 24-hour maintenance when the raid was opened.\nHistory.\nWhen a clutch of &lt;a href=\"twilight%20dragonflight\"&gt;twilight dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; eggs was discovered within the &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Sanctum\"&gt;Obsidian Sanctum&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Korialstrasz&lt;/a&gt; asked the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Six\"&gt;Council of Six&lt;/a&gt; to send adventurers to destroy them. The deed was done quickly, and without fanfare or acknowledgment. At first all seemed quiet, but then all communication with the guardians in the Ruby Sanctum ceased. The guards stationed at the portal were slain, and the mystic stones shattered. The implications of the Ruby Sanctum being breached are dire, and little is known of the identity of the attackers, as the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;'s numbers in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; seem too limited to have pulled off such an attack. What power would dare to attack the stronghold of the red dragonflight, and how did they get past the guards undetected?\nAs the black dragonflight attacked the sanctum in retaliation, the black dragons' targets were the red dragons' eggs.\nCataclysm.\nSome time after the &lt;a href=\"Shattering\"&gt;Shattering&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; invaded the Ruby Sanctum in order to corrupt the eggs within. Korialstrasz was forced to destroy both himself and not only this sanctum but all of them in order to stop them, leaving nothing behind except traces of the energy used to destroy them.\nThe Ruby Sanctum was eventually rebuilt and used to store the very last red dragon eggs and whelps there would ever be. This was probably done before the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt; raid, as after that the dragons became sterile. Either that, or the eggs existed before the raid in other locations and the sanctum was rebuilt to keep them safe after it became clear there would be no more.\nLegion.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Deathlord&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; travels to the rebuilt Ruby Sanctum to obtain information on &lt;a href=\"Kyranastrasz\"&gt;a great dragon skeleton&lt;/a&gt; north of &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; gives the Deathlord the option of either sparing some dragons within, or slaying them all. However, the dragons are aggressive to the Deathlord regardless.\nEncounters.\nThe &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; has assaulted the sanctum and is attempting to destroy it to facilitate &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing's&lt;/a&gt; reemergence into &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Halion\"&gt;Halion&lt;/a&gt; will be the primary encounter, along with three mini-encounters that must be completed prior to him. Unlike the &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Sanctum\"&gt;Obsidian Sanctum&lt;/a&gt;, there are no progressive hard modes from leaving up some or all of the minibosses. Loot is comparable to that of &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;The Lich King&lt;/a&gt;.

The other four activate their temporal rifts as Eregos flies past (this will not engage him). The puller hits him twice to begin the encounter, then hits time stop and hits him one more time. At this point the other four drakes should have 8-10 charges on Eregos. Now the puller activates Temporal Rift, and the other four hit him with a single shock lance (which should hit for well over 100k due to their charges). After casting their lance, they return to rifting. At this point the puller has 10 charges (from the other drakes' lances), and casts shock lance himself, which also hits for over 100k, and gives the other four drakes 10 charges. The other four then hit him as the puller rifts. Repeat this pattern until 60%. After the arcane phase, select a new drake to be the \"puller\", and start over again. Eregos dies really fast on this strategy, which is the key, because you have no healing, and no tank to evade attacks.\n-edit-\nYou have to time your time-stops correctly or Eregos will summon whelps that can overwhelm the party. Also, returning to him after Astral shift and timing a time-stop is important or this will ruin coordination and he will summon whelps.\n4 Amber Drakes, 1 Emerald Drake.\nThis strategy requires perfect group coordination to pull off.\nThis strategy is almost identical to the 5 Amber Drake method. 3 of the Amber Drakes will activate Temporal Rift. After all 3 are up, the 4th Amber Drake designated as the 'tank' will hit &lt;a href=\"Ley-Guardian%20Eregos\"&gt;Ley-Guardian Eregos&lt;/a&gt; twice, then time-stop, then hit him again. He will then immediately Temporal Rift. The other 4 drakes, after gaining 8-10 charges, will attack the boss, making sure the tank's Temporal Rift is up. Immediately after the charges are blown, the tank attacks the boss again and the other 3 Amber Drakes activate Temporal Rift. The Amber Drakes should be using their Time-Stops to stop the boss's Whelp Summons and Enrage. During this time, the Emerald Drake will keep a 3 stack on the boss, a 25%- damage debuff on the boss, and a heal on whoever needs it, mainly the tank. It is strongly recommended that the Emerald Drake prioritizes his own health before others as his death early in the encounter almost ensures a wipe. At 60%, the boss will go immune and summon orbs. During this time, all the drakes need to fly away from the orbs. Also, any Amber Drake that used Time-Stop should blow their 5 charges on any whelps that have been summoned to kill them quickly before the boss re-enters the fight. By this time, if the whelps haven't died, the Emerald Drake is going to have to stop healing and start applying 3 stacks to the whelps as he will pull threat and not be able to heal or debuff the boss since both make the Emerald Drake lose its own health. During the 2nd cycle, the Amber Drake with the most health should be the new 'tank'. The cycle repeats until the boss goes to 20%, at which point he will phase out once again and everyone has to fly away from the orbs, killing any whelps they can. At the last 20%, it is STRONGLY recommended that the Amber Drakes keep the boss in a constant Time-Stop as he is weak enough to die by the end of it. Note that diminishing returns apply so only so many can be applied, depending if you've already Time-Stopped recently. Make sure coordination is strong and Time-Stops aren't used at the same time. This is a tough strategy but easier than the 5 Amber Drake strategy."}

Although he fought on the side of &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Daelin Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; during the battle, \"his honor was without stain\" and he is remembered with honor as the one that taught &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; \"...about respect\", and being \"...a very good teacher\" in the lesson. \nThrall had first encountered Rufus at &lt;a href=\"Durnholde%20Keep\"&gt;Durnholde Keep&lt;/a&gt; during one of &lt;a href=\"Aedelas%20Blackmoore\"&gt;Aedelas Blackmoore&lt;/a&gt;'s gladiatorial tournaments. Rufus was with his &lt;a href=\"mercenary\"&gt;mercenary&lt;/a&gt; father &lt;a href=\"Morgan%20Montaine\"&gt;Morgan&lt;/a&gt; as spectators at the tournament. Rufus was impressed by Thrall and saw dignity in the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;. He wanted to know what his grandfather knew, when he fought the orcs in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;; the spirit of the orcs. His father was reluctant, and didn't want his son to fight, but was goaded into giving permission by fellow mercenaries and Blackmoore himself. He was given permission to duel with Thrall using battlesticks. Rufus bowed before Thrall before the match began to show respect to the young orc (although Thrall thought it an odd gesture). Both fighters were skilled, and the duel lasted a while, but Thrall ultimately won. Rufus smiled at Thrall as he got up, and shook Thrall's hand in respect (despite his father's disgust at the action). It was the first time anyone had ever shown Thrall that gesture and he had no idea what it meant, or what the emotion was. It was the first time anyone had ever shown him respect.\nSome time later still in his youth, he left his home and pledged his service to the Proudmoore family, after his father had gotten into shady dealings. Years later, he traveled with Proudmoore to &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; and died during when the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; besieged Theramore. He fought in a particularly fierce section of the battle in a field of tall grass. He fought against six high ranked orcs. During the skirmish he was wounded many times (though his face was unblemished), and two arrows were shot into his back. He was killed in that spot.\nHis body was later discovered on the battlefield by &lt;a href=\"Jaina\"&gt;Jaina&lt;/a&gt; and Thrall not long after the battle. Jaina recognized his crest and his reputation. She remembered him as the grandson of a Montaine that fought by her father's side during the Second war. Thrall remembered him as being the teacher who taught him respect. Thrall closed the dead knight's eyes, and they tended his body with honor."}

Its release was joined by a massive server-dependent event called the &lt;a href=\"Gates%20of%20Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Gates of Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt;. It can be found by entering the main &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt; Gate and continuing on the left path. Most of the area is mountable, however, the bug mounts from the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Temple of Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt; do not work here. If any member of your party is in combat then your entire party is in combat no matter where they are in the instance.\nIt uses a similar loot system to what &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Gurub\"&gt;Zul'Gurub&lt;/a&gt; used, via tokens dropped from bosses which are used to complete quests that give item rewards. Additionally, the quests can only be completed once a certain reputation has been reached with the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt;. The rewards are class-specific: a ring at honored, a cloak at revered and a weapon at exalted. There is a set bonus for all three.\nHistory.\nDuring the final hours of the War of the Shifting Sands, the combined forces of the night elves and the four dragonflights drove the battle to the very heart of the qiraji empire, to the fortress city of Ahn'Qiraj. Yet at the city gates, the armies of Kalimdor encountered a concentration of silithid war drones more massive than any they had encountered before. Ultimately the silithid and their qiraji masters were not defeated, but merely imprisoned inside a magical barrier, and the war left the cursed city in ruins. \nA thousand years have passed since that day, but the qiraji forces have not been idle. A new and terrible army has been spawned from the hives, and the ruins of Ahn'Qiraj are teeming once again with swarming masses of silithid and qiraji. This threat must be eliminated, or else all of Azeroth may fall before the terrifying might of the new qiraji army.\nDungeon Companion.\nDeep within the deserts of Silithus lies an ancient and powerful race of beings known as the Qiraji. One thousand years ago, the Night Elves and Bronze Dragonflight combined their considerable powers to seal the Qiraji behind the scarab wall with the help of the children of some of the aspects. This is remembered as the \"War of the Shifting Sands\".\nRecently it was discovered that some of the Qiraji were finding ways past the wall. Anachronos, the bronze dragon, helped the adventurers of Azeroth open the Scarab Wall to prevent more incursions. The mortal races have now banded together to confront the evil Qiraji in their own land. A champion has opened the gate and the Horde and Alliance have driven the armies of the Qiraji back into the ruins in retreat. It now falls to heroes to delve into the lair of the Qiraji and put an end to their masters once and for all.\nAhn'Qiraj War.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; invaded the Ruins. The collapsed sections teemed with qiraji clutches and every nightmare of the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; could drum up. As the Horde advanced, the enemy numbers increased beyond counting, and faced Kurinnaxx deep in the marrow of the hive.\nCataclysm.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Unrest\"&gt;Elemental Unrest&lt;/a&gt;, the ruins were entered by the Alliance and Horde to kill &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Sarsarun\"&gt;Prince Sarsarun&lt;/a&gt;.\nPreparation.\nMany of the mobs in the Ruins of Ahn'Qiraj use poison or nature-based attacks, so nature resistance gear would be ideal. However, nature resistance in Ahn'Qiraj seems not to be near as crucial as fire resistance to Molten Core. \nGuilds who attempt the Ruins of Ahn'Qiraj should not be required to be decked out in epic-quality equipment. \nLikewise to nature resistance gear, Greater Nature Protection potions have some potential use in Ahn'Qiraj. However, the formula for these potions is known to sell for more than Greater Fire Protection potions.\nSince the progression for the instances of this size is to go from Blackrock Spire to Zul'Gurub to the Ruins of Ahn'Qiraj, the type of gear to have would be ZG-level or above. Those wearing Tier 1 gear and above will find this instance a lot simpler. Note that since the removal of Zul'Gurub as a raid instance, players wishing to tackle AQ10 with a group of Lv. 60 players may have a harder time since this progression step is now gone.\nInside the Gates of Ahn'Qiraj there are two portals. The one on the left side is the portal to the Ruins of Ahn'Qiraj. The one on the right is the portal to the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Temple of Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt;.\nHaving at least 1 druid on your raid is not only a good idea, but essential. Entangling Roots, although unreliable, is the only form of Crowd Control that will work in AQ10. A balance Druid will shine in AQ10.\nDungeon denizens.\nEncounters.\nOne of the nice things about AQ10 is that there are only two mandatory boss encounters between the entrance line and Ossirian: Kurinnaxx and General Rajaxx. The raid can then ignore Moam in the Reservoir to skip directly to Ossirian if desired.\nLoot.\nThe loot in AQ10 comes from:\nLoot-quest system.\nAQ10 loot-quests require scarabs and idols which drop from trash mobs and Qiraji items which drop from bosses, combined with a certain level of faction with the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt;. \nPlayers must collect ten scarab items of two certain types (two lots of five), two stone idols of a certain type, and a single Qiraji item. When a player has the appropriate collection for a particular item and a certain level of reputation with the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt;, they can turn them in for the item."}

Following the fall of the kingdom, the ruins became home to the &lt;a href=\"Crushridge\"&gt;Crushridge&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s who disputed the territories for years with the &lt;a href=\"Syndicate\"&gt;Syndicate&lt;/a&gt;. During the events of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"New%20Horde\"&gt;New Horde&lt;/a&gt; took over the ruins and began to build a major base here in order to keep power over the region. They were not contested by the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, but were spied on.\n&lt;a href=\"Bro%27kin\"&gt;Bro'kin&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; alchemy supplier, can be found on top of the wall in the northern part of the ruins.\nHistory.\nSecond War.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, Alterac City was ruled by Lord &lt;a href=\"Aiden%20Perenolde\"&gt;Aiden Perenolde&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the battle at &lt;a href=\"Caer%20Darrow\"&gt;Caer Darrow&lt;/a&gt;, a number of renegade human soldiers assisting the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt; were captured. After being interrogated at &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt;, the prisoners were revealed to be from the kingdom of Alterac. &lt;a href=\"High%20Command\"&gt;High Command&lt;/a&gt; then decreed that the nation of Alterac had committed treason against the Alliance, and Alterac City was then attacked in retaliation by the forces of the other human kingdoms.\nAn Alteraci prison camp was also situated near Alterac City, containing captured &lt;a href=\"Dalaran%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; citizens. The kingdom was destroyed by the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; for their betrayal during the Second War, most of the population abandoned the ruins of their former homes.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Crushridge\"&gt;Crushridge&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s led by &lt;a href=\"Mug%27thol\"&gt;Mug'thol&lt;/a&gt; have taken up the deserted ruins, now void of human inhabitants. The former Alteraci of the &lt;a href=\"Syndicate\"&gt;Syndicate&lt;/a&gt; were now occupying outlying settlements such as &lt;a href=\"Strahnbrad\"&gt;Strahnbrad&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe ruins were visited by the adventurers of the Horde and Alliance searching for artifacts, such as the &lt;a href=\"%3ACrown%20of%20Will\"&gt;:Crown of Will&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"%3APerenolde%20Tiara\"&gt;:Perenolde Tiara&lt;/a&gt;.\nWrecked &lt;a href=\"meat%20wagon\"&gt;meat wagon&lt;/a&gt;s can be found near the northern rampart and at the gate, indicating that either the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; attacked in the previous years.\nLegion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Archmage&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Tirisgarde\"&gt;Tirisgarde&lt;/a&gt; arrived here to take back the stolen &lt;a href=\"%3ATri-Disc%20of%20Frost\"&gt;:Tri-Disc of Frost&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Ok%27rok%20Icetouch\"&gt;Ok'rok Icetouch&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"ogre%20mage\"&gt;ogre mage&lt;/a&gt; who had raided the &lt;a href=\"Dalaran%20Crater\"&gt;Dalaran Crater&lt;/a&gt; with other &lt;a href=\"Crushridge\"&gt;Crushridge&lt;/a&gt; ogres.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Battle for Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, a Horde group fled to the Ruins of Alterac. During the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the Horde planned to rebuild it as a defensible base of operations in Lordaeron. In response, Alliance sent scouts to investigate the established fortifications and determine the numbers of local forces. However, no offensive has been done to contest the control of the city by the troops of the Horde.\nGeography.\nAlterac City was less extensive than the capital cities of the other &lt;a href=\"Seven%20Kingdoms\"&gt;human kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;, but still featured several points of interest:\nThe city was defended by &lt;a href=\"ballista\"&gt;ballista&lt;/a&gt;e, whose wrecks still litter the ruins.\nIn the RPG.\nIn Lands of Conflict.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Syndicate\"&gt;Syndicate&lt;/a&gt; controlled the capital city for a time, but the &lt;a href=\"Crushridge\"&gt;Crushridge&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s drove them away. Now, what remains of Alterac City, the Ruins of Alterac, serves as the ogres' base camp and largest settlement. &lt;a href=\"Mug%27thol\"&gt;Mug'thol&lt;/a&gt;, a ferocious and crafty warlord, rules the clan from here. The Syndicate is battling the ogres in order to retake the ruined city.\nIn Dark Factions.\nNotably absent from &lt;a href=\"Syndicate\"&gt;Syndicate&lt;/a&gt; control is Alterac City. After it fell to the assault by &lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Sir Uther&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;his paladins&lt;/a&gt;, people abandoned the city. The ruins now serve as a stronghold for the &lt;a href=\"Crushridge\"&gt;Crushridge&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt; clan. Although members of the Syndicate excel at thievery and murder, they are no match for the strength of the ogres.\nEven though the Syndicate regained much of its lands and more, &lt;a href=\"Aliden%20Perenolde\"&gt;Lord Perenolde&lt;/a&gt; will not be satisfied until he takes Alterac City from the ogres, thus he has offered a great bounty to anyone who can reclaim his ancestral lands for him, though it is dubious he would honor such a bargain."}

The ruins are controlled by &lt;a href=\"Araj%20the%20Summoner\"&gt;Araj the Summoner&lt;/a&gt;, a level 61 &lt;a href=\"elite\"&gt;elite&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"lich\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt;, surrounded by &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; agents. The inhabitants are for the most part &lt;a href=\"ghoul\"&gt;ghoul&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"banshee\"&gt;banshee&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"abomination\"&gt;abomination&lt;/a&gt;s.\nMany players in WoW once regarded Andorhal as some of the most difficult (if not the most difficult) non-instance content in the game. During the pre-release beta, all of the mobs in Andorhal were &lt;a href=\"elite\"&gt;elite&lt;/a&gt;s, which practically made it an outdoor &lt;a href=\"dungeon\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt;. For several months after the original release of WoW, Andorhal was very different than it appears in-game today. Although most of the mobs lost their elite status, the city was still encircled by walls on all sides and had a much thicker infestation of undead than it does currently. Most players, even at level 60, struggled soloing Andorhal, particularly since these were times before Onyxia or Molten Core gear was commonplace. Eventually, Andorhal received a significant nerf; the walls were removed, some houses were spread out or removed, and many mob spawns were similarly curtailed.\nIn Cataclysm.\nThe Alliance have successfully taken and rebuilt part of the western sections of Andorhal, while the Forsaken have built a base in the northeastern section. Both areas appear to have an inn and a flight master. During the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Andorhal\"&gt;Battle for Andorhal&lt;/a&gt;, the Forsaken successfully claim the rest of Andorhal as their own.\nThe city is now known simply as \"Andorhal\".\nTime Distortion.\nIt is implied by Chromie that the local Scourge forces are attempting to alter the city's timeline, most likely at Araj's command. This is evidenced by the &lt;a href=\"Temporal%20Parasite\"&gt;Temporal Parasite&lt;/a&gt;s that infest the city silos. A detail of note is that the watches of Andorhal, much like the large clock on the ruins of the &lt;a href=\"town%20hall\"&gt;town hall&lt;/a&gt;, were all frozen in time at three o'clock."}

Now, all that remains of the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elven&lt;/a&gt; town are the wrecked and desolated buildings while the former docks are plunged into the sea. The inhabitants that fled founded two new settlements: the town of &lt;a href=\"Lor%27danel\"&gt;Lor'danel&lt;/a&gt; in the north, and the &lt;a href=\"Auberdine%20Refugee%20Camp\"&gt;Auberdine Refugee Camp&lt;/a&gt; in the east. Some stayed behind, however, hoping to salvage their own home. They were eventually forced out by an attack of the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; cultists and their water elementals. Many of the refugees fleeing this second attack were killed during their trek towards Lor'danel along the coast. Fatalities included the town's elder, &lt;a href=\"Thundris%20Windweaver\"&gt;Thundris Windweaver&lt;/a&gt;. The survivors were picked up by sentinels and &lt;a href=\"hippogryph\"&gt;hippogryph&lt;/a&gt;s from Lor'danel, where they were tended to by priestesses. A memorial plaque for the fallen was eventually erected within the town.\n&lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20Lendra\"&gt;Sentinel Lendra&lt;/a&gt; at the Auberdine Refugee Camp enlisted the help of adventurers to try and take back the ruins of Auberdine from the Twilight's Hammer, hoping to foil their plan of summoning the massive lightning revenant, &lt;a href=\"Aetherion\"&gt;Aetherion&lt;/a&gt;. In the process, they released the &lt;a href=\"wisp\"&gt;wisp&lt;/a&gt;s from a number of the dead townsfolk.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Thorns\"&gt;War of the Thorns&lt;/a&gt;, the ruins became a battleground, with the elven forces led by &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20Aylissa%20Silverarrow\"&gt;Lieutenant Aylissa Silverarrow&lt;/a&gt; facing &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s led by &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20Oogra\"&gt;Lieutenant Oogra&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; forces sought to raze the remnants of the town. &lt;a href=\"Fallen%20Glaive\"&gt;Fallen Glaive&lt;/a&gt;s were lying around. The &lt;a href=\"Auberdine%20Refugee%20Camp\"&gt;Auberdine Refugee Camp&lt;/a&gt; was lit on fire and abandoned by the refugees.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; sent &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt;-powered &lt;a href=\"shredder\"&gt;shredder&lt;/a&gt;s into the ruins to salvage it. Horde champions were sent there to prevent &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Spy\"&gt;spies&lt;/a&gt; from gathering information, encountering &lt;a href=\"Huntress%20Duskrunner\"&gt;Huntress Duskrunner&lt;/a&gt;.

The Alliance was also trying to rebuild the town's inn and the docks, with &lt;a href=\"Nevara%20Nightshade\"&gt;Nevara Nightshade&lt;/a&gt; commanding the elven defenses here. The long pier of &lt;a href=\"Auberdine%20Coast\"&gt;Auberdine Coast&lt;/a&gt; is patrolled by &lt;a href=\"wisp\"&gt;wisp&lt;/a&gt;s. When the Horde controlled the zone, the entire town was ruined again.\nAfter the Alliance won the Battle for Darkshore, the pier, dock, and inn were repaired."}

At some unknown point prior to the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt; the Forsaken were in the area again, and the Gilneans were shown to be mobilizing around the areas of the kingdom during the Fourth War. The Forsaken are later stated to still have troops occupying Gilnean lands years after the war is over.\nHistory.\nAncient Kalimdor.\nBelysra Starbreeze claims a group of &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; formerly known as &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Scythe\"&gt;Druids of the Pack&lt;/a&gt; lived in the vicinity of &lt;a href=\"Tal%27doren\"&gt;Tal'doren&lt;/a&gt;.\nArathor.\nDuring the first initial expansion of the &lt;a href=\"Arathor\"&gt;Arathorian Empire&lt;/a&gt; and during the &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Wars\"&gt;Troll Wars&lt;/a&gt;, Gilneas was outside its boundaries. It would not be after the war against the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20Empire\"&gt;Amani Empire&lt;/a&gt; when the Arathi would expand into the peninsula around 2,800 years ago, becoming the location of one of the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; city-states. 2,700 years ago, a group of Gilneans would leave the peninsula and arrive on an island that they would later call &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;.\nPre-Third War.\nBefore the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"King%20Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;King Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; commanded the construction of the &lt;a href=\"Greymane%20Wall\"&gt;Greymane Wall&lt;/a&gt; which once finished separated the Gilnean peninsula from the kingdom's northern lands in &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt;.\nPost invasion.\nFollowing the events of the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Gilneas\"&gt;invasion of Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;, casualties were heavy and the enemy even took the life of the prince and heir to the &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilnean&lt;/a&gt; throne, &lt;a href=\"Liam%20Greymane\"&gt;Liam Greymane&lt;/a&gt;. This forced the majority of the population to evacuate &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20peninsula\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; to seek shelter in the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elven&lt;/a&gt; lands, while the &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20Liberation%20Front\"&gt;Gilneas Liberation Front&lt;/a&gt; remained to continue fighting for the freedom of their homeland. This region quickly became one of the main fronts in the war between the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; following the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;. Alongside their new &lt;a href=\"7th%20Legion\"&gt;7th Legion&lt;/a&gt; allies, the Gilnean forces clashed with the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; armies marching beyond the ruined &lt;a href=\"Greymane%20Wall\"&gt;Greymane Wall&lt;/a&gt;.\nThrough several battles, which ended in the loss of all the Forsaken bases aside from the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken%20Front\"&gt;Forsaken Front&lt;/a&gt;, the Liberation Front ended up cutting off most of the Forsaken's support and eventually removed the Forsaken from the area completely. This was achieved through the aid from their new allies in the &lt;a href=\"Bloodfang%20pack\"&gt;Bloodfang pack&lt;/a&gt;, and 7th legion support in the form of naval soldiers and submarines (which proceed to destroy the entire Forsaken fleet in the area). The loss of the Forsaken Fleet was enough to turn the tide completely, forcing the Horde from the tattered kingdom entirely; though a small contingent was able to secure the body of Gilnean insurgent and former lord &lt;a href=\"Vincent%20Godfrey\"&gt;Vincent Godfrey&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Ashbury\"&gt;his&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Walden\"&gt;henchmen&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the Forsaken defeat in Gilneas, &lt;a href=\"Darius%20Crowley\"&gt;Darius Crowley&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the Gilneas Liberation Front, led the final assault on Silverpine Forest, attempting to retake part of the land. However, &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas\"&gt;Sylvanas&lt;/a&gt;, with Godfrey's aid, captured &lt;a href=\"Lorna%20Crowley\"&gt;Lorna Crowley&lt;/a&gt;, Darius' daughter, and used her as a bargaining chip. With no other option to save his child, Crowley ordered the retreat from Silverpine in order to save Lorna from the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;; an act that angered &lt;a href=\"Ivar%20Bloodfang\"&gt;Ivar Bloodfang&lt;/a&gt; greatly. Despite this loss, however, the timely betrayal of Sylvanas by Vincent Godfrey ended up saving the Alliance from losing their grip on Gilneas, an unintended effect on Godfrey's behalf as he did not wish to save the Alliance (especially the Gilneans who made up most of the forces). His betrayal of Sylvanas, who was killed and then resurrected by her &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt;, left her too weakened to continue the assault to rout the Alliance from Gilneas, forcing the Horde to end their assault at the border of Silverpine; leaving Gilneas in Alliance hands and allowing their forces to retreat beyond the wall.\nFollowing Silverpine.\nIn the aftermath of Silverpine, the Alliance had cemented their hold in Gilneas for a time. This allowed the Bloodfang to branch out into Hillsbrad Foothills to continue the fight against the Forsaken. With all Forsaken land bases either destroyed or recaptured by Alliance forces, the Forsaken began to launch naval assaults on the area, starting &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Gilneas\"&gt;an ongoing battle over the coastal region&lt;/a&gt; as the Alliance worked to repel the Forsaken's attempts to re-establish a land base within the peninsula.\nAside from the battles on the coast, the situation within the peninsula was relatively silent until just before the demise of &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;. It was revealed by the &lt;a href=\"Ravenholdt\"&gt;Ravenholdt&lt;/a&gt; that the Gilneans had been infiltrated by a &lt;a href=\"Black%20dragonflight\"&gt;Black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; member in disguise as an affluent noble by the name of &lt;a href=\"Hiram%20Creed\"&gt;Hiram Creed&lt;/a&gt;. Using his blood, Creed sought out to corrupt the Gilneans in secret, attempting to make them his pawns and make an army of draconically enhanced servants. Going by the name of the &lt;a href=\"Blackhowl\"&gt;Blackhowl&lt;/a&gt;, the group was seen mostly within the walls of &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20City\"&gt;Gilneas City&lt;/a&gt;, protecting Creed from Forsaken assassins while they were unwittingly corrupted into his pawns. His schemes were ended, however, by an assassin working for the uncorrupted black dragon &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt;, who had set out on a quest to kill every last black dragon on Azeroth (aside from Wrathion of course).\nWith the help of &lt;a href=\"Zazzo%20Twinklefingers\"&gt;Zazzo Twinklefingers&lt;/a&gt;, the assassin infiltrated Gilneas City and managed to kill him, freeing the Gilneans of the dragon's influence. Following the death of Creed, it is unknown what became of the Blackhowl. Seeing as though they had no knowledge of Creed's plan to subvert them, or his status as a dragonkin, the group probably continues to guard Gilneas City, as they were most likely still affiliated with the Alliance.\nAt some point after the death of Creed, both the Horde and Alliance withdrew from Gilneas' mainland for unknown reasons, leaving the only area of activity in the zone along the &lt;a href=\"Gilnean%20Coast\"&gt;coastline&lt;/a&gt; where &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Gilneas\"&gt;skirmishes were fought&lt;/a&gt;.\nBefore the Storm.\nBy the time of the end of the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20Campaign\"&gt;Argus Campaign&lt;/a&gt;, Gilneas was referred to as fallen, with nothing but \"wind, sorrow and ruin\" in the land. When Genn arrived at &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20Keep\"&gt;Stromgarde Keep&lt;/a&gt; before the events of the &lt;a href=\"Gathering\"&gt;Gathering&lt;/a&gt;, he told Anduin that both kingdoms were now in ruins, with Gilneas being home to the Forsaken and Stromgarde being overrun with criminals, ogres, and trolls.\nElegy and A Good War.\nSylvanas is cited as hoping to use the ruined status of Gilneas as an inciter among the Alliance after Teldrassil is captured. She erroneously attributes Greymane's desire to reclaim his kingdom to cloud his judgment, causing a division within the Alliance between supporters who wished to reclaim Teldrassil and those who wished to reclaim Gilneas. Unbeknownst to Sylvanas, Greymane immediately claims that Teldrassil will need to be reclaimed first, with Gilneas coming after, as a gesture to repay the debt owed to the night elves by the Gilnean people.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nGilneas was a point of interest for the Alliance and Horde forces in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; following the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Battle for Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, with the Alliance seemingly having forces in the region. The &lt;a href=\"7th%20Legion\"&gt;7th Legion&lt;/a&gt; surrounded &lt;a href=\"Shadowfang%20Keep\"&gt;Shadowfang Keep&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Tobias%20Zaren\"&gt;Captain Tobias Zaren&lt;/a&gt;, to prevent &lt;a href=\"Chief%20Plaguebringer%20Harris\"&gt;Chief Plaguebringer Harris&lt;/a&gt; from unleashing a new bio-weapon against Gilneas. At the same time, a Gilnean army marched under &lt;a href=\"Darius%20Crowley\"&gt;Darius Crowley&lt;/a&gt; to assault the Horde-controlled area of the &lt;a href=\"Sludge%20Fields\"&gt;Sludge Fields&lt;/a&gt;, which was amassing undead to assail Gilneas.\nThe Horde also moved on the &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands\"&gt;Arathi Highlands&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to destroy the new Alliance base in &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20Keep\"&gt;Stromgarde Keep&lt;/a&gt;. This was done to prevent the Alliance's full control over the Eastern Kingdoms and to use Stromgarde as a staging point for attacking Gilneas.\nShadowlands.\nAfter the creation of a new &lt;a href=\"Desolate%20Council\"&gt;Desolate Council&lt;/a&gt;, the newly appointed &lt;a href=\"Calia%20Menethil\"&gt;Calia Menethil&lt;/a&gt; sent a letter to &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; explaining that one of her first proposals would be withdrawing the Forsaken troops from Gilneas.\nStatus.\nGilneas' status is wildly speculative. This is due to the inconsistency and lack of explanation of various elements concerning the region.\nIn \"Cataclysm\", following the worgen starter zone, Gilneas is contested between the Alliance and the Horde by way of the Forsaken and their orcish reinforcements, and Gilneas and the &lt;a href=\"7th%20Legion\"&gt;7th Legion&lt;/a&gt;. This is the case until near the end of the &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt; questing experience, where Gilneas is left in Crowley and Bloodfang's hands as they retreat from Silverpine. Their forces are next seen in &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt;, where Ivar Bloodfang seems to be organizing with the &lt;a href=\"Stormpike%20clan\"&gt;Stormpike clan&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Purgation%20Isle\"&gt;Purgation Isle&lt;/a&gt;, an island easily accessible from Gilneas. This seems to corroborate with the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Gilneas\"&gt;Battle for Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; battleground, which depicts the Forsaken attempting to make another landholding within Gilneas, whilst the Alliance starts on the mainland from the &lt;a href=\"Gilnean%20Stronghold\"&gt;Gilnean Stronghold&lt;/a&gt;. To further complicate matters, the &lt;a href=\"Blackhowl\"&gt;Blackhowl&lt;/a&gt;, a group of Gilneans being secretly led by a black dragon known as &lt;a href=\"Hiram%20Creed\"&gt;Hiram Creed&lt;/a&gt;, seem to occupy &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20City\"&gt;Gilneas City&lt;/a&gt; with little concern. It is unknown if the Blackhowl had ever left the Alliance, as the Gilneans are said to not know their leader is actually a dragon.\nIn \"Mists of Pandaria\", Gilneas is not mentioned until the very end of the expansion as an off-hand quote by &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, stating the plague in the region needed to be removed so the Gilneans could rebuild. This is the first mention of the peninsula being heavily blighted, as while the Blight was used against them, all areas that were seen severely blighted in both the stating zone and during the Silverpine experience were also seen readily occupied by Alliance forces. Most noteworthy is Gilneas City, which was blight bombed heavily during the worgen starting experience, but was later occupied by both the &lt;a href=\"7th%20Legion\"&gt;7th Legion&lt;/a&gt; and the Blackhowl with little issue; thus raising the first inconsistency with Gilneas' status. During this time, &lt;a href=\"Sean%20Copeland\"&gt;Loreology&lt;/a&gt; and the \"&lt;a href=\"Ultimate%20Visual%20Guide\"&gt;Ultimate Visual Guide&lt;/a&gt;s\" clarified on Twitter that Gilneas had been abandoned by both factions and the city was in ruins. This is not given any explanation, as when the area was last seen, the Alliance held it. This also brings into question whether or not the Battle for Gilneas battleground is still ongoing.\nGilneas goes unmentioned in \"Warlords of Draenor\" and \"Legion\", though the &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20Brigade\"&gt;Gilneas Brigade&lt;/a&gt; is formed with many members of the &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20Liberation%20Front\"&gt;Gilneas Liberation Front&lt;/a&gt; as leaders within it. What this means for the Liberation front is entirely unknown. Dave Kosak once more refers to the Blight as having plagued the entire zone, despite it having only been weaponized in the northern areas of Gilneas and never having made it to the southern areas as the Forsaken ships there were destroyed by the Cataclysm. Kosak stated that there are \"pockets of safety for careful travelers\" when speaking on the level of blighting that affects Gilneas. It is unknown whether this means that the Blight has not reached certain areas of the peninsula if there are forces in the area keeping it at bay, or what regions are unblighted.\nGilneas is finally mentioned again in the book \"Before the Storm\", in which it is inconsistently referred to as being \"home to the Forsaken\" by Genn Greymane, while also being claimed to be entirely empty and abandoned. Once more, it is referred to as plagued, which is inconsistent to the idea that it is home to the Forsaken, as the undead are still susceptible to the Blight. Its status as being un-reclaimed is re-affirmed within \"Elegy\" and \"A Good War\", where Gilneas is mentioned as still having not been reclaimed or restored and Sylvanas Windrunner is relying on Genn Greymane to push for Gilneas over &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt; to be reclaimed as the former was lost first. This does not explain whether or not the region is abandoned or occupied by the Forsaken, leaving its fate once more ambiguous.\nIn \"Battle for Azeroth\", Gilneas is once more inconsistently referred to. By the beginning of the expansion, it is referred to by &lt;a href=\"Displaced%20Gilnean%20Refugee\"&gt;Displaced Gilnean Refugee&lt;/a&gt;s as something the Alliance should be focusing on, over the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Ruins of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. The Battle for Azeroth Features Trailer visibly shows the Alliance militarily spreading its influence over most of the Eastern Kingdoms, including over the Gilnean peninsula, but Gilneas has yet to be updated in-game. The &lt;a href=\"mission%20table\"&gt;mission table&lt;/a&gt; quests later in the expansion refer to several Gilnean leaders in the north attacking the Forsaken, with the &lt;a href=\"Bloodfang%20Pack\"&gt;Bloodfang Pack&lt;/a&gt; claiming &lt;a href=\"Fenris%20Isle\"&gt;Fenris Isle&lt;/a&gt; and Darius Crowley invading the &lt;a href=\"Sludge%20Fields\"&gt;Sludge Fields&lt;/a&gt; within Hillsbrad as well as the Forsaken occupying &lt;a href=\"Shadowfang%20Keep\"&gt;Shadowfang Keep&lt;/a&gt;. There, it is stated that the Forsaken are readying a blight to be used against Gilneas, inferring that the region is once again in the kingdom's hands. In addition, the Q&amp;A section for the &lt;a href=\"Warfront\"&gt;Warfront&lt;/a&gt; panel at &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon%202018\"&gt;BlizzCon 2018&lt;/a&gt; stated that &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Stromgarde\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt;'s warfront was a necessity to the Horde so they could use it as a launching point to invade Gilneas. This infers that the mission tables are canon and the Alliance holds Gilneas, but does not explain how the Forsaken lost control of Gilneas if they ever had it to begin with, the status of the Blight, which poses a risk to both factions, nor what the state of potential Alliance occupation is.\nIn addition, during their confrontation, &lt;a href=\"King%20Rastakhan\"&gt;King Rastakhan&lt;/a&gt; mockingly calls Genn a \"an exile without a homeland\", implying that during the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, Gilneas is still largely unreclaimed, or at least unsettled, perhaps due to Genn diverting the bulk of his kingdom's forces to aid their kaldorei allies in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Darkshore\"&gt;Battle for Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;, something he vowed to Anduin that he would do were he forced to choose between his kingdom and the night elves. While the Alliance managed to successfully reclaim &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt; in the conflict's aftermath, and occupied most of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; at least throughout the war, Genn Greymane has apparently remained focused on the plight of the missing Alliance leaders in the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt; rather than on his homeland.\nAlthough Gilneas's current status remains unclear, &lt;a href=\"Baradin%27s%20Wardens\"&gt;Baradin's Wardens&lt;/a&gt; retain a tenuous hold over the neighboring island of &lt;a href=\"Tol%20Barad\"&gt;Tol Barad&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Bloodfang%20pack\"&gt;Bloodfang pack&lt;/a&gt; has also successfully reclaimed &lt;a href=\"Fenris%20Isle\"&gt;Fenris Isle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shadowfang%20Keep\"&gt;Shadowfang Keep&lt;/a&gt; from the Forsaken, strengthening the worgen's control over &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt; considerably. The Alliance has also reclaimed &lt;a href=\"Southshore\"&gt;Southshore&lt;/a&gt; from the Forsaken, implying some territories in the &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt; have been returned to Alliance control as well, essentially securing parts of all four immediate neighboring regions of Gilneas - Tol Barad to its west, Silverpine and Hillsbrad to its north, and Arathi to its east. &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt;, as the new regent of Stormwind in Anduin's absence, makes mention of other holdings of the old Alliance in the continent that could be reclaimed, presumably referring to Gilneas and other lost territories in the north.\nGilneas' status was once again referred to at the end of the &lt;a href=\"Return%20to%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Return to Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; questline. After the creation of a new &lt;a href=\"Desolate%20Council\"&gt;Desolate Council&lt;/a&gt;, the newly appointed &lt;a href=\"Calia%20Menethil\"&gt;Calia Menethil&lt;/a&gt; sent a letter to &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; explaining that one of her first proposals would be withdrawing the Forsaken troops from Gilneas. This does not elaborate if the Forsaken occupied all of Gilneas, or simply had troops there that will be withdrawing. During the turn in dialogue of &lt;a href=\"Report%20to%20Greymane\"&gt;Report to Greymane&lt;/a&gt;, Genn phrases the 'return of Gilneas', though this does not elaborate if they are 'returning' Gilneas or if they would not stop the 'return of' the Gilnean people to their homeland. Calia refers to the idea as the withdrawal from Gilnean lands; thus leaving the actual level of occupation or what parts of Gilneas the Forsaken were in completely speculatory.\nGeography.\nGilneas is a large peninsula located on the southwest of the &lt;a href=\"continent\"&gt;continent&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. It lies south of &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt; and southwest of &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"Baradin%20Bay\"&gt;Baradin Bay&lt;/a&gt; to its south and east, and &lt;a href=\"Tol%20Barad\"&gt;Tol Barad&lt;/a&gt; to the west across the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt;. Storms from over the Great Sea are common, and the sun rarely shines. Gilneas was shielded from the rest of the world by its high cliffs and treacherous reefs by sea, to the point that the kingdom had no less than three &lt;a href=\"lighthouse\"&gt;lighthouse&lt;/a&gt;s.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the southwestern part of the peninsula, which included the town of &lt;a href=\"Duskhaven\"&gt;Duskhaven&lt;/a&gt;, was destroyed by an earthquake sinking the land into the sea. Some of the jagged reefs were also destroyed by the Cataclysm, paving the way for a naval invasion of the kingdom.\nQuests.\nA part of the Horde questline in &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt; happens in the Gilnean peninsula.\nIn the RPG.\nGilneas is a large peninsula that juts into the sea south of western &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt; lies to the northeast, &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; awaits across the sea to the south, and &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Dare\"&gt;Zul'Dare&lt;/a&gt; is found to the southeast. Gilneas is a cold, rainy place, mainly because the ocean surrounds the peninsula on three sides, making sea storms common. High cliffs on the shores protect the peninsula from sailors' curious eyes. &lt;a href=\"Greymane%20Wall\"&gt;Greymane Wall&lt;/a&gt; is the only evident site in the region.\nGilneas does not allow anyone in or out, and none knows what has been transpiring there for the past ten years. &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; once questioned everyone he came across, mainly &lt;a href=\"refugee\"&gt;refugee&lt;/a&gt;s, but none could offer him anything more than curses and dark looks toward Gilneas.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Lord Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt;, a brawny &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt; who must be in his seventies, has ruled &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; for decades. He offered only token support to the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; during the Second War. He never supported the Alliance and argued against its existence from beginning to end. Thus, after the war, he and his people constructed the &lt;a href=\"Greymane%20Wall\"&gt;Greymane Wall&lt;/a&gt;: a massive barrier spanning the entire northern border, and no one has heard anything from Gilneas since.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, refugees from the north camped at Greymane Wall, pleading to be let inside. The gates remained closed, and &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; patrols slaughtered the refugees.\nThough nothing hostile has come out of the peninsula, some cannot resist the allure of mystery, as perhaps something dire has befallen Gilneas. Rumors of what was transpiring there became the subject of rumors throughout the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; - the renowned explorer &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; theorized that the nation had fallen to the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; as one such example.\n&lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20dwarf\"&gt;Ironforge dwarves&lt;/a&gt;, seeking allies to help drive the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; from Lordaeron, intended to send a diplomatic party to Gilneas. &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;King Magni&lt;/a&gt; hired &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"zeppelin\"&gt;zeppelin&lt;/a&gt;s to ferry the diplomats and summoned &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"gryphon%20rider\"&gt;gryphon rider&lt;/a&gt;s as escorts. Yet, as no one knew what to expect in Gilneas, Magni hired a few trusted mercenaries to accompany his ambassadors.\nSpeculation.\nBelysra Starbreeze appears to claim the Druids of the Pack called Tal'doren home in ancient Gilneas. This is false. "}

The ruins can be flown over afterward, but getting too close to the ground will rapidly kill the player due to the blight. After the fall of the Jailer, the Forsaken, aided by adventurers of both the Alliance and Horde, utilized techniques learned in Maldraxxus to purge the blight from the ruins.\nHistory.\n\"For the lore before the ruins, see &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City%23History\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nWarcraft III.\nAfter the massacre of its citizens at the hands of the Scourge and the destruction of the city and its &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; defenders, the ruins were overseen by &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Detheroc\"&gt;Detheroc&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Varimathras\"&gt;Varimathras&lt;/a&gt;.\nSeveral months after the end of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, detachments of the surviving &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; emerged from the rubble of the Lordaeron to form a resistance against the Scourge and to protect those who fled to &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, recaptured by the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20resistance\"&gt;Alliance resistance&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Marshal%20Garithos\"&gt;Grand Marshal Garithos&lt;/a&gt;. Among them, the &lt;a href=\"Crippling%20Force\"&gt;Crippling Force&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Defenders%20of%20Justice\"&gt;Defenders of Justice&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Circle%20of%20Holy%20Light\"&gt;Circle of Holy Light&lt;/a&gt; guarded the ruined &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20palace%20gardens\"&gt;Lordaeron palace gardens&lt;/a&gt;, respectively under the command of &lt;a href=\"Dagren%20the%20Orcslayer\"&gt;Dagren the Orcslayer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Magroth%20the%20Defender\"&gt;Magroth the Defender&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Halahk%20the%20Lifebringer\"&gt;Halahk the Lifebringer&lt;/a&gt;. However, their combined efforts were not enough, as they were defeated by &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; on their return from &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, enabling the Scourge to murder the survivors and destroyed the resistance. After his victory, Arthas ousted the dreadlords of the ruined city and named himself &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;King of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; recalled Arthas to &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, Balnazzar took control over the city once again. The combined forces of Grand Marshal Garithos and Sylvanas Windrunner defeated Balnazzar, at which point Sylvanas betrayed her &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20resistance\"&gt;allies&lt;/a&gt; and took the city for herself. The &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;, which lies beneath the ruins of the city, became the capital of the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nTo this day you can still hear the moments before &lt;a href=\"King%20Terenas\"&gt;King Terenas&lt;/a&gt;' death; hushed whispers in the courtyard, the clanging of bells in the entryway, the faint cheer echoing the welcome of Prince &lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt;, and the murmur of voices in the throne room. One such sentence that is uttered says \"This kingdom shall fall, and from the ashes shall arise a new order that will shake the very foundations of the world.\" \u2014 Arthas after slaying his father, and proclaiming the Scourge's invasion and victory over Lordaeron. If you can &lt;a href=\"Detect%20Invisibility%23Invisibility%20Detection\"&gt;detect invisibility&lt;/a&gt;, you will see the &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20Citizen\"&gt;ghosts&lt;/a&gt; of the citizens of Lordaeron still haunting the castle's courtyard. Beneath the ruins now lies the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; capital &lt;a href=\"city\"&gt;city&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;, where the dark queen prepares to conquer the lands to the east and south.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;lands outside the ruins&lt;/a&gt; are no longer full of cheerful people enjoying the sun, but with demons such as &lt;a href=\"Darkhound\"&gt;Darkhound&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Duskbat\"&gt;Duskbat&lt;/a&gt;s and the Scourge lurking nearby at the borders of the &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands\"&gt;Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;.\nPrior to the start of the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt;, the gates of Lordaeron were invaded by a group of &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s led by &lt;a href=\"Highlord%20Kruul\"&gt;Highlord Kruul&lt;/a&gt;.\nA new section of this zone holding an &lt;a href=\"Orb%20of%20Translocation\"&gt;Orb of Translocation&lt;/a&gt; was added that connects the Undercity to the &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elf&lt;/a&gt; capital of &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt; for those with the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt; expansion. Additionally, an &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Lordaeron%20%28arena%29\"&gt;Arena&lt;/a&gt; was added.\nThe Horde forces led by Thrall and Sylvanas battled through the entrance against Varimathras's demons.\nCataclysm.\nThe city received an overhaul and is finally completely visible to players due to the addition of flying mounts to the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;. The architecture of the Ruins of Lordaeron as well as the Undercity was not heavily changed in Cataclysm, however, it was updated to allow flying mounts. Little Forsaken presence could be seen here until &lt;a href=\"patch%204.2.0\"&gt;patch 4.2.0&lt;/a&gt;, when the area was populated with &lt;a href=\"Undercity%20Citizen\"&gt;Forsaken Citizens&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron%20Overseer%20%28Undercity%29\"&gt;Kor'kron Overseer&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Apothecary%20Initiate\"&gt;Apothecary Initiate&lt;/a&gt;s were also added near the plague wagons.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nSince the fall of &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron%20Overseer%20%28Undercity%29\"&gt;Kor'kron Overseer&lt;/a&gt;s have left the Undercity and the Ruins of Lordaeron, and the &lt;a href=\"abomination\"&gt;abomination&lt;/a&gt;s have returned to their posts as &lt;a href=\"Undercity%20Guardian\"&gt;Undercity Guardian&lt;/a&gt;s.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nCapital City was put under &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Lordaeron\"&gt;siege&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;reignited war&lt;/a&gt; between the Alliance and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Led by &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;High King Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, the Alliance sought to reclaim the fallen capital from the Forsaken and the Horde. Though Sylvanas and the Horde put up a fierce defense, the Alliance routed the Horde from the city. Rather than let the Alliance claim Lordaeron as a stronghold, Sylvanas had rigged all of the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt; and Lordaeron Keep to be &lt;a href=\"New%20Plague\"&gt;blighted&lt;/a&gt;. In the end, the Horde was forced to abandon Capital City and the Undercity beneath it, leaving the ruins plagued and unclaimed, only occupied by the living skeletons that fell during the siege.\nBy the time of the end of the Fourth War, &lt;a href=\"Renzik%20%22The%20Shiv%22\"&gt;Renzik \"The Shiv\"&lt;/a&gt; reported that parts of the ruins of Lordaeron appear slightly less dangerous as if the blight was slowly fading, but the toxic blight will likely take a very long time to disperse completely.\nShadowlands.\nAfter retaking &lt;a href=\"Brill\"&gt;Brill&lt;/a&gt; and bringing back a &lt;a href=\"Plague%20Eater\"&gt;plague eater&lt;/a&gt; empowered by the magic of &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxus\"&gt;Maldraxxus&lt;/a&gt;, the Forsaken launched an attack on the blight spread across the Ruins of Lordaeron, unleashing the plague eaters on it. The consumed blight and the plague eaters manifested into an &lt;a href=\"Amalgam\"&gt;Amalgam&lt;/a&gt;. After its defeat, prominent leaders formed the new &lt;a href=\"Desolate%20Council\"&gt;Desolate Council&lt;/a&gt; in the courtyard of the Ruins of Lordaeron, and the Forsaken returned home.\nIn the RPG.\nLordaeron's capital city stood for centuries, a monument to humanity's might. In the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Arthas\"&gt;Prince Arthas&lt;/a&gt; slew his father &lt;a href=\"King%20Terenas\"&gt;King Terenas&lt;/a&gt; in Lordaeron's &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20chamber\"&gt;throne room&lt;/a&gt; and ransacked the city. He planned to use Lordaeron as his capital on this continent and ordered his minions to expand the catacombs beneath the city. Then the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; summoned Arthas to &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; and the work was left uncompleted.\nDuring Arthas' exodus, &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; broke free of the Lich King's control and took many &lt;a href=\"banshee\"&gt;banshee&lt;/a&gt;s and other &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; with her. With &lt;a href=\"Varimathras\"&gt;Varimathras&lt;/a&gt;' assistance she defeated the &lt;a href=\"dreadlord\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt;s that controlled the city and set her newly dubbed &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; to finish Arthas' job in the dungeons. The Forsaken carved &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt; and now rule the surrounding countryside.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

In the arena version, however, both ends are symmetrical staging areas. Also in the arena version, there is no bridge (with sewer water below) leading into the throne room, and there are no stairs on either side of the arena. Due to these differences, the arena is basically flat.\nIn the middle of the arena, there is a tomb that can be used to block &lt;a href=\"LoS\"&gt;LoS&lt;/a&gt; and to get high ground advantage.
