The Firestone increases all spell direct damage done by 1% and increases &lt;a href=\"Spell%20critical%20strike\"&gt;Spell critical strike&lt;/a&gt; by 7/14/21/28/35/42/49. They are Bind-On-Pickup, but unlike other &lt;a href=\"Conjured%20Items\"&gt;Conjured Items&lt;/a&gt;, Firestones and Spellstones do not vanish after logged out for any amount of time (Much like a Wizard Oil created by &lt;a href=\"Enchanting\"&gt;Enchanting&lt;/a&gt;).\nThe Original Firestone.\nCreate Firestone conjured a Soulbound item that added Fire damage to the Warlock's weapon and bonus Fire Spell damage. Firestones were originally held in the offhand, then held in the Wand Slot after 2.0.1. This requires wand switching, but also allows a Firestone to be used with staves or a one-hand weapon with an off-hand item, remedying a common player complaint about the Firestone's lack of utility.\nBoth the firestone and spellstone were widely unused for multiple reasons. They did not provide comparable stats to Wands and, like other conjured items, would disappear if logged out for more than 15 minutes. This was changed in &lt;a href=\"Echoes%20of%20Doom\"&gt;Echoes of Doom&lt;/a&gt;, Patch 3.0.2, to the current state. The change also included the Firestone's companion, the &lt;a href=\"Spellstone\"&gt;Spellstone&lt;/a&gt;. \nWhen active, a Firestone placed a small fireball that circles the Warlock's weapon.\nWhy anybody would use this item was a topic of debate. Since it only increased fire spell damage it was only potentially useful to destruction warlocks, and most of them prefer the crit bonus and use-effect of the &lt;a href=\"Create%20Spellstone\"&gt;Spellstone&lt;/a&gt;. The melee fire damage was mostly useless, because in any situation where a player could be meleeing, he or she would do more damage wanding. (The only exception were the magic-immune Risen Aberrations in Scholomance, which were also immune to non-holy wand damage but not the Firestone proc. This was not the case with most other magic-immune mobs, such as the mana wyrms in Karazhan, which are also immune to the proc.)\nHowever, many used its lack of utility as inspiration for several comedic videos. The most well known of these was known as &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Di1IDWqHpHds\"&gt;Project: Nerf Firestone&lt;/a&gt;."}

A single use of Create Spellstone (which uses a &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Shard\"&gt;Soul Shard&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;a href=\"reagent\"&gt;reagent&lt;/a&gt;) will create a Spellstone with 5 charges. Each charge can be only used on the weapon of the warlock who created it.\nHistory.\nOriginally, the spellstone was equipped in the off-hand slot, was consumed on use, and granted a buff that absorbed spell damage. It was almost completely unused by the Warlock community, who largely wielded staves. In the 2.0.1 patch, Spellstones were equippable by the warlock in the wand &lt;a href=\"Equipment%20slot\"&gt;slot&lt;/a&gt;, improved spell critical strike rating and could remove &lt;a href=\"Magic%20%28Dispel%20Type%29\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; debuffs. The Spellstone was considered by many warlocks to be a critical conjured item for PVP and PVE alike since the 2.0.1 patch. However, Warlocks differed over the benefit over having a spellstone equipped in place of a wand, since the cooldown on the magic-removal use was 3 minutes. The crit bonus was a &lt;a href=\"passive%20ability\"&gt;passive ability&lt;/a&gt; from equipping the stone and could be increased by &lt;a href=\"Master%20Conjuror\"&gt;Master Conjuror&lt;/a&gt;. The crit bonus was roughly equal to +1% at the level each rank is learned. The &lt;a href=\"Echoes%20of%20Doom\"&gt;Echoes of Doom&lt;/a&gt; patch changed the Spellstone to its current form."}

There is no difference between them.\n/run print(\"Hello World!\")\n\"To quickly turn scripts like this into an addon, just remove the \"/run\" part and paste it into https://addon.bool.no/\"\nCreating an AddOn.\nAn addon consists of Lua/XML files and a &lt;a href=\"TOC_format\"&gt;TOC&lt;/a&gt; file. We won't be using &lt;a href=\"XML\"&gt;XML&lt;/a&gt; since most things that are possible in XML can also be done in Lua.\nGo to your AddOns folder and create a new folder with the following files:&lt;br&gt;codice_2\nHelloWorld.lua\nprint(\"Hello World!\")\nHelloWorld.toc\n ## Interface: \n ## Version: 1.0.0\n ## Title: Hello World\n ## Notes: My first addon\n ## Author: YourName\n HelloWorld.lua\nLoad up World of Warcraft, the addon should show up in the addon list and greet you upon login.\nDevelopment tips.\n\"See also: &lt;a href=\"Lua%20Coding%20Tips\"&gt;Lua Coding Tips&lt;/a&gt;\"\nResponding to events.\nAlmost every action in the game is an &lt;a href=\"Events\"&gt;Event&lt;/a&gt; which tells the UI that something happened. For example fires when someone sends a message in a chat channel like \"General\" and \"Trade\". \nTo respond to events you create a frame with () and register the events to it.\nlocal function OnEvent(self, event, ...)\n print(event, ...)\nend\nlocal f = CreateFrame(\"Frame\")\nf:RegisterEvent(\"CHAT_MSG_CHANNEL\")\nf:SetScript(\"OnEvent\", OnEvent)\nAnother example, to play a sound on levelup with () or () you register for the event.\nlocal f = CreateFrame(\"Frame\")\nf:RegisterEvent(\"PLAYER_LEVEL_UP\")\nf:SetScript(\"OnEvent\", function()\n PlayMusic(642322) -- sound/music/pandaria/mus_50_toast_b_hero_01.mp3\nend)\nHandling multiple events.\nWhen registering multiple events it can be messy if there are a lot of them.\nlocal function OnEvent(self, event, ...)\n if event == \"ADDON_LOADED\" then\n local addOnName = ...\n print(event, addOnName)\n elseif event == \"PLAYER_ENTERING_WORLD\" then\n local isLogin, isReload = ...\n print(event, isLogin, isReload)\n elseif event == \"CHAT_MSG_CHANNEL\" then\n local text, playerName, _, channelName = ...\n print(event, text, playerName, channelName)\n end\nend\nlocal f = CreateFrame(\"Frame\")\nf:RegisterEvent(\"ADDON_LOADED\")\nf:RegisterEvent(\"PLAYER_ENTERING_WORLD\")\nf:RegisterEvent(\"CHAT_MSG_CHANNEL\")\nf:SetScript(\"OnEvent\", OnEvent)\nWhich can be refactored to this:\nlocal f = CreateFrame(\"Frame\")\nfunction f:OnEvent(event, ...)\n self[event](self, event, ...)\nend\nfunction f:ADDON_LOADED(event, addOnName)\n print(event, addOnName)\nend\nfunction f:PLAYER_ENTERING_WORLD(event, isLogin, isReload)\n print(event, isLogin, isReload)\nend\nfunction f:CHAT_MSG_CHANNEL(event, text, playerName, _, channelName)\n print(event, text, playerName, channelName)\nend\nf:RegisterEvent(\"ADDON_LOADED\")\nf:RegisterEvent(\"PLAYER_ENTERING_WORLD\")\nf:RegisterEvent(\"CHAT_MSG_CHANNEL\")\nf:SetScript(\"OnEvent\", f.OnEvent)\nSlash commands.\nSlash commands are an easy way to let users interact with your addon.

This way you can avoid leaking variables to the global environment.\nHelloWorld.toc\n ## Interface: \n ## Version: 1.0.0\n ## Title: Hello World\n FileA.lua\n FileB.lua\nFileA.lua\nlocal _, ns = ...\nns.foo = \"Banana\"\nFileB.lua\nlocal addonName, ns = ...\nprint(addonName, ns.foo) -- prints \"HelloWorld\" and \"Banana\"\nOr you can simply use a unique global variable.\nFileA.lua\nMyAddon.value = 0\nfunction MyAddon:DoSomething(increment)\n self.value = self.value + increment\nend\nMyAddon:DoSomething(2)\nFileB.lua\nMyAddon:DoSomething(3)\nprint(MyAddon.value) -- 5\nConclusion.\nYou know how to write a simple addon from scratch!

{"id": "17104", "revid": "40286632", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=17104", "title": "Creating GUI configuration options", "text": "Making a GUI Config/Options dialog for your addon is always a bit tricky, however this HOWTO will hopefully help you in such an endeavor. Since a config dialog is usually added to an existing addon, this HOWTO will use an existing addon as an example, but we encourage you to use your own addon while following this HOWTO.\nThis HOWTO is not meant to reproduce myClock in any shape or form, and you'll notice that the code has been changed in a number of places. Nevertheless this HOWTO is based on it, and if you filled in the gaps would give you a nice basic myClock like addon.\nThe TOC file.\nIn the TOC file we need to add your config dialog's .xml file. Also to have a config dialog that remembers it's settings between game sessions, you will need to use the SavedVariables directive. \nmyClock.toc: Before changes\n ## Interface: 1600\n ## Title: myClock\n ## Notes: Clock replacing day-night indicator\n myClockIndicatorFrame.xml\nWe need to:\nThis HOWTO uses &lt;a href=\"MyAddOns\"&gt;myAddOns&lt;/a&gt; to show the config dialog because it is much simpler then creating a slash command. If you wish to use a slash command, it is recommended you read as it is not covered in this HOWTO.\nmyClock.toc: After changes\n ## Interface: 1600\n ## Title: myClock\n ## Notes: Clock replacing day-night indicator\n ## OptionalDeps: myAddOns\n ## SavedVariables: myClockConfig\n myClockIndicatorFrame.xml\n myClockConfigFrame.xml\nLoad config from SavedVariables.\nUsing the SavedVariable 'myClockConfig' we declared in the .toc file, we can now load and save our addon's configuration between game sessions. Remember that SavedVariable is per-account, not per-realm and not per-character, so we will need to use tables to store individual settings.\nMain frame: .xml.\nWe will be modifying the main addon frame, in this case 'myClockIndicatorFrame.xml' which is used to display the current time.\nWe need to:\nThe OnLoad is needed to start watching the 'VARIABLES_LOADED' event (when myClockConfig will have its saved values set). Next, we use OnEvent to actually do something when the event fires.\nmyClockIndicatorFrame.xml\n &lt;Ui ...&gt;\n &lt;Frame name=\"myClockIndicatorFrame\" ...&gt;\n &lt;Scripts&gt;\n &lt;OnLoad&gt; myClockIndicatorFrame_OnLoad(); &lt;/OnLoad&gt;\n &lt;OnEvent&gt; myClockIndicatorFrame_OnEvent(); &lt;/OnEvent&gt;\n &lt;/Scripts&gt;\n &lt;/Frame&gt;\n &lt;/Ui&gt;\nMain frame: .lua.\nGlobals.\nWe need to:\nmyClockIndicatorFrame.lua\n -- Globals\n -- so we know when our configuration is loaded\n myClock_variablesLoaded = false;\n -- for configuration saving\n myClockRealm = GetCVar(\"realmName\");\n myClockChar = UnitName(\"player\");\n -- details used by myAddOns\n myClock_details = {\n name = \"myClock\",\n frame = \"myClockIndicatorFrame\",\n optionsframe = \"myClockConfigFrame\"\n -- default config settings\n local myClockConfig_defaultOn = true; -- addon enabled?\n local myClockConfig_defaultTime24 = true; -- 24 hour format?\n local myClockConfig_defaultOffset = 0; -- time offset?\nRegistering Events.\nSince we will use the VARIABLES_LOADED event to know when it is safe to use our SavedVariable,\nWe need to:\nmyClockIndicatorFrame.lua: anywhere inside\n -- OnLoad\n function myClockIndicatorFrame_OnLoad()\n -- register events\n this:RegisterEvent(\"VARIABLES_LOADED\"); -- eventually will call OnEvent\n end\nmyClockIndicatorFrame.lua: anywhere inside\n -- OnEvent\n function myClockIndicatorFrame_OnEvent()\n -- VARIABLES_LOADED event\n if ( event == \"VARIABLES_LOADED\" ) then\n -- execute event code in this function\n myClockIndicatorFrame_VARIABLES_LOADED();\n end\n end\nCustom Update Functions.\nWe now have a function that will be called when our variables are loaded.\nIt will need to:\nwithin myClockIndicatorFrame.lua\n function myClockIndicatorFrame_VARIABLES_LOADED()\n -- initialize our SavedVariable\n if ( not myClockConfig ) then \n myClockConfig = {}; \n end\n if ( not myClockConfig[myClockRealm] ) then \n myClockConfig[myClockRealm] = {}; \n end\n if ( not myClockConfig[myClockRealm][myClockChar] ) then \n myClockConfig[myClockRealm][myClockChar] = {}; \n end\n -- load each option, set default if not there\n if ( not myClockConfig[myClockRealm][myClockChar].on ) then \n myClockConfig[myClockRealm][myClockChar].on = myClockConfig_defaultOn; \n end\n if ( not myClockConfig[myClockRealm][myClockChar].time24 ) then \n myClockConfig[myClockRealm][myClockChar].time24 = myClockConfig_defaultTime24; \n end\n if ( not myClockConfig[myClockRealm].offset ) then \n myClockConfig[myClockRealm].offset = myClockConfig_defaultOffset; \n end\n -- record that we have been loaded\n myClock_variablesLoaded = true;\n -- we know other addons have been \"loaded\" now\n -- optional dependance on myAddOns, leads to our config panel\n if( myAddOnsFrame_Register ) then\n myAddOnsFrame_Register( myClock_details );\n end\n -- configuration might have changed\n myClock_ConfigChange();\n end\nSo this function is very simple, it created a new table for storing our configuration on a addon-wide, realm-wide and character basis, then checked for every config option and made sure it was loaded, if not then set it to the default. We added myAddons support, telling myAddons what our mod's name, main frame, and config frame was using a table declared in our globals. \nThe last line is interesting, we make a call to myClock_ConfigChange(). This is the function that will actually change our mod based on our settings. In the case of a clock most of those options ('time24', 'offset') are actually in OnUpdate, but we would handle the 'on' in this function.\nOur config change should:\nwithin myClockIndicatorFrame.lua\n function myClock_ConfigChange()\n -- make sure that our profile has been loaded before allowing this function to be called\n if ( not myClock_variablesLoaded ) then -- config not loaded\n myClockIndicatorFrame:Hide(); -- turn our mod off\n return;\n end\n -- make sure to use the frame's name here, cannot rely on 'this' to mean the main frame\n if ( myClockConfig[myClockRealm][myClockChar].on ) then\n myClockIndicatorFrame:Show(); -- show our mod frame\n else\n myClockIndicatorFrame:Hide(); -- hide our mod frame\n end\n end\nIt can also be useful to have a function to set everything back to defaults... here is one you might use in this case\nwithin myClockIndicatorFrame.lua\n -- reset to defaults\n function grokClock_ConfigToDefault()\n -- make sure that our profile has been loaded before allowing this function to be called\n if ( not myClock_variablesLoaded ) then -- config not loaded\n myClockIndicatorFrame:Hide(); -- turn our mod off\n return;\n end\n -- set our profile to defaults\n myClockConfig[myClockRealm][myClockChar].on = myClockConfig_defaultOn;\n myClockConfig[myClockRealm][myClockChar].time24 = myClockConfig_defaultTime24;\n myClockConfig[myClockRealm][myClockChar].offset = myClockConfig_defaultOffset;\n -- frame name used since called from various places\n -- set the location of the frame... in case they dragged it away\n myClockIndicatorFrame:SetPoint(\"TOPLEFT\", \"MinimapCluster\", \"TOPLEFT\", 122, -28);\n -- wow automatically saves the location of frames on the screen!\n -- make sure the defaults are loaded onto our mod frame\n myClock_ConfigChange();\n end\nMaking your config frame.\nNow that your mod is using your SavedVariable, and is both loading it's settings from it (or using the defaults), you need a configuration frame to allow users to modify their settings! There are many popular ways of doing this, you can create slash commands (learn more at ), a right click menu, but for now we will stay simple, and just have a frame popup when you use myAddons to display the options.\nFrom inside the game, you can hit the 'ESCAPE' key and chose the 'Addons' item to have myAddons open. From there you can click on the name for your addon, and then click the 'Options' button on the bottom right. But it won't open your options right now, because you haven't made the frame yet!\nconfig frame .xml.\nBasic Frame with Backdrop.\nLet's flesh out a basic config frame:\nmyClockConfigFrame.xml\n &lt;Ui ...&gt;\n &lt;Script file=\"myClockConfigFrame.lua\"/&gt;\n &lt;Frame name=\"myClockConfigFrame\" \n toplevel=\"true\" parent=\"UIParent\" frameStrata=\"DIALOG\" \n hidden=\"true\" enableMouse=\"true\"&gt;\n &lt;Size&gt;&lt;AbsDimension x=\"260\" y=\"280\"/&gt;&lt;/Size&gt;\n &lt;Anchors&gt;&lt;Anchor point=\"CENTER\"/&gt;&lt;/Anchors&gt;\n &lt;Backdrop bgFile=\"Interface\\DialogFrame\\UI-DialogBox-Background\" \n edgeFile=\"Interface\\DialogFrame\\UI-DialogBox-Border\" tile=\"true\"&gt;\n &lt;BackgroundInsets&gt;\n &lt;AbsInset left=\"11\" right=\"12\" top=\"12\" bottom=\"11\"/&gt;\n &lt;/BackgroundInsets&gt;\n &lt;TileSize&gt;&lt;AbsValue val=\"32\"/&gt;&lt;/TileSize&gt;\n &lt;EdgeSize&gt;&lt;AbsValue val=\"32\"/&gt;&lt;/EdgeSize&gt;\n &lt;/Backdrop&gt;\n &lt;/Frame&gt;\n &lt;/Ui&gt;\nWe now have a config frame, and if you go in-game you can see it in all it's splendor. Feel free to make it any size, and the ANCHOR point=\"CENTER\" will make sure it is dead center on the screen no matter the resolution.\nYou'll probably want some kind of title on it to say what mod's options it is, so here's some Layers info to do that:\nwithin myClockConfigFrame.xml\n &lt;Frame ...&gt;\n &lt;Backdrop ...&gt;\n &lt;/Backdrop&gt;\n &lt;Layers&gt;\n &lt;Layer level=\"ARTWORK\"&gt;\n &lt;Texture file=\"Interface\\DialogFrame\\UI-DialogBox-Header\"&gt;\n &lt;Size&gt;&lt;AbsDimension x=\"256\" y=\"64\"/&gt;&lt;/Size&gt;\n &lt;Anchors&gt;\n &lt;Anchor point=\"TOP\"&gt;\n &lt;Offset&gt;&lt;AbsDimension x=\"0\" y=\"12\"/&gt;&lt;/Offset&gt;\n &lt;/Anchor&gt;\n &lt;/Anchors&gt;\n &lt;/Texture&gt;\n &lt;/Layer&gt;\n &lt;Layer level=\"OVERLAY\"&gt;\n &lt;FontString inherits=\"GameFontNormal\" text=\"Clock Config\"&gt;\n &lt;Anchors&gt;\n &lt;Anchor point=\"TOP\" relativeTo=\"$parent\"&gt;&lt;/Anchor&gt;\n &lt;/Anchors&gt;\n &lt;/FontString&gt;\n &lt;/Layer&gt;\n &lt;/Layers&gt;\n &lt;/Frame&gt;\nAdding Close and Default Buttons.\nThat should make a small title box appear, and you'll notice the FontString's text attribute is set to \"Clock Config\" -- you can change this to anything you want. If you're doing &lt;a href=\"localization%20%28ui%29\"&gt;localization (ui)&lt;/a&gt;, maybe even a constant! You might notice that once you display your config frame, there's no way to get rid of it! Let's fix that right away by adding a `Close' button:\nwithin myClockConfigFrame.xml\n &lt;Frame ...&gt;\n &lt;Frames&gt;\n &lt;Button name=\"$parentButtonClose\" inherits=\"OptionsButtonTemplate\" text=\"Close\"&gt;\n &lt;Anchors&gt;\n &lt;Anchor point=\"BOTTOMRIGHT\"&gt;\n &lt;Offset&gt;&lt;AbsDimension x=\"-12\" y=\"16\"/&gt;&lt;/Offset&gt;\n &lt;/Anchor&gt;\n &lt;/Anchors&gt;\n &lt;Scripts&gt;\n &lt;OnClick&gt; myClockConfigFrame:Hide(); &lt;/OnClick&gt;\n &lt;/Scripts&gt;\n &lt;/Button&gt;\n &lt;/Frames&gt;\n &lt;/Frame ...&gt;\nThis button, which you'll notice is anchored at the bottom right of the config frame, simply tells our configuration frame to hide.\nWhile we're at it, let's add a defaults button in the bottom left of the frame.\nwithin myClockConfigFrame.xml\n &lt;Frame ...&gt;\n &lt;Frames&gt;\n &lt;Button name=\"$parentButtonToDefault\" inherits=\"OptionsButtonTemplate\" text=\"Defaults\"&gt;\n &lt;Anchors&gt;\n &lt;Anchor point=\"BOTTOMLEFT\"&gt;\n &lt;Offset&gt;&lt;AbsDimension x=\"13\" y=\"16\"/&gt;&lt;/Offset&gt;\n &lt;/Anchor&gt;\n &lt;/Anchors&gt;\n &lt;Scripts&gt;\n &lt;OnClick&gt; grokClock_ConfigToDefault(); &lt;/OnClick&gt;\n &lt;/Scripts&gt;\n &lt;/Button&gt;\n &lt;/Frames&gt;\n &lt;/Frame ...&gt;\nYou'll notice all we really had to do here was call our ConfigToDefault function we made in 'myClockIndicatorFrame.lua' -- it will take care of updating our addon for us! Now we should be able to undo any damage should we mess around with our mod's config settings.\nCheckboxes and Sliders.\nWith most of the graphical frame stuff out of the way, it's time to add our checkboxes, and a slider for the offset (Dropdown menus are a lot more complicated, so this HOWTO won't be covering that).\nYour basic checkbox config will look like:\nwithin myClockConfigFrame.xml\n &lt;Frame ...&gt;\n &lt;Frames&gt;\n &lt;CheckButton name=\"$parentCheckButtonOn\" inherits=\"OptionsCheckButtonTemplate\"&gt;\n &lt;Anchors&gt;\n &lt;Anchor point=\"TOPLEFT\" relativeTo=\"$parent\"&gt;\n &lt;Offset&gt;&lt;AbsDimension x=\"20\" y=\"-30\"/&gt;&lt;/Offset&gt;\n &lt;/Anchor&gt;\n &lt;/Anchors&gt;\n &lt;Scripts&gt;\n &lt;OnLoad&gt; getglobal(this:GetName()..\"Text\"):SetText(\"On\"); &lt;/OnLoad&gt;\n &lt;OnClick&gt; myClockConfigFrameOption_OnClick(); &lt;/OnClick&gt;\n &lt;/Scripts&gt;\n &lt;/CheckButton&gt;\n &lt;/Frames&gt;\n &lt;/Frame ...&gt;\nYou'll notice I'm using the '$parent' and 'this' variables here to make this code generic, able to be used anywhere. If this was the 2nd checkbox, my Anchor relativeTo would be '$parentCheckButtonOn', and so forth, so that each item in the config dialog was just a bit bellow the others. Of course you could use absolute positioning by just getting rid of the 'relativeTo' altogether.\nYou should also see that the CheckButton has a OnLoad to set its text, since this will be an automatically created FontString. Again I use 'this:GetName()..\"Text\"' to make this code generic. I've set the text to \"On\" in this case, but you can change this to whatever you want, even a &lt;a href=\"localized%20%28ui%29\"&gt;localized (ui)&lt;/a&gt; variable!\nThe OnClick simply loads a lua function, but it is important to note that we will use this function for ALL our CheckButtons. That's right, we can use the same function for all our CheckButton's!\nIn our case we'll need to repeat this CheckButton xml code twice, once for 'on' and again for 'time24'. So go ahead and try to create another checkbox. Watch out for the offset! Look at the slider example bellow for how the offset should look after the 1rst item.\nHere's what our slider code might look like:\nwithin myClockConfigFrame.xml\n &lt;Frame ...&gt;\n &lt;Frames&gt;\n &lt;Slider name=\"$parentSliderOffset\" inherits=\"OptionsSliderTemplate\"&gt;\n &lt;Size&gt;\n &lt;AbsDimension x=\"220\" y=\"16\"/&gt;\n &lt;/Size&gt;\n &lt;Anchors&gt;\n &lt;Anchor point=\"TOPLEFT\" relativeTo=\"$parentCheckButtonTime24\"&gt;\n &lt;Offset&gt;&lt;AbsDimension x=\"0\" y=\"-40\"/&gt;&lt;/Offset&gt;\n &lt;/Anchor&gt;\n &lt;/Anchors&gt;\n &lt;Scripts&gt;\n &lt;OnLoad&gt;\n getglobal(this:GetName()..\"Text\"):SetText(\"Offset\");\n getglobal(this:GetName()..\"High\"):SetText(\"12\");\n getglobal(this:GetName()..\"Low\"):SetText(\"-12\");\n this:SetMinMaxValues(-12,12);\n this:SetValueStep(1);\n &lt;/OnLoad&gt;\n &lt;OnValueChanged&gt; grokClockConfigFrameOption_OnClick(); &lt;/OnValueChanged&gt;\n &lt;/Scripts&gt;\n &lt;/Slider&gt;\n &lt;/Frames&gt;\n &lt;/Frame&gt;\nYou'll again notice that we're using the Anchor relativeTo on the last checkbox, which will be $parentCheckButtonTime24. We're again dynamically getting the FontStrings that WoW will create for us, like the 'Text' one set to \"Offset\". As well, because this is a slider, we have \"High\" and \"Low\" FontStrings, have to set the minimum and maximum values the slider has, and how many values are added or subtracted when you move the slider. What will most surprise you is that.. yes... we can still use that option function for our slider too! One function for all the basic config options!\nFrame Scripts.\nIt's also important that all our current settings are loaded into our config frame, and since they might change when we use a slash command or something, the best way would be to use a OnShow event.\nwithin myClockConfigFrame.xml\n &lt;Frame ...&gt;\n &lt;Scripts&gt;\n &lt;OnShow&gt; myClockConfigFrame_OnShow(); &lt;/OnShow&gt;\n &lt;/Scripts&gt;\n &lt;/Frame&gt;\nconfig frame .lua.\nOur lua file for the config frame then breaks down into just 2 functions, one for when the frame is shown, the other for when an option in the config frame (like a checkbox, or a slider is moved) changes.\nwithin myClockConfigFrame.lua\n -- OnShow\n function myClockConfigFrame_OnShow()\n -- make sure our profile has been loaded\n if ( not myClock_variablesLoaded ) then -- config not loaded\n this:Hide(); -- hide our config pane\n return;\n end\n -- read settings from profile, and change our checkbuttons and slider to represent them\n getglobal(this:GetName()..\"CheckButtonOn\"):SetChecked( myClockConfig[myClockRealm][myClockChar].on );\n getglobal(this:GetName()..\"CheckButtonTime24\"):SetChecked( myClockConfig[myClockRealm][myClockChar].time24 ); \n getglobal(this:GetName()..\"SliderOffset\"):SetValue( myClockConfig[myClockRealm].offset );\n end\nYou'll notice again that we have to make sure that the profile is there (or variables loaded). The code also uses the getglobal() function to construct the names of the controls, so it doesn't matter what we called our frame. After that it's a simple matter of using SetChecked() or SetValue() with our profile settings to make our config dialog look right.\nThe last part is making sure that when they change something in the config dialog, it changes the profile. Here's what that would look like:\nwithin myClockConfigFrame.lua\n -- OnClick\n function grokClockConfigFrameOption_OnClick()\n -- make sure our profile has been loaded\n if ( not myClock_variablesLoaded ) then -- config not loaded\n this:GetParent():Hide(); -- hide our config pane (this is now a checkbox)\n return;\n end\n -- read setting out of checkbox (or slider) and put into profile\n -- use this:GetName() to know which checkbox was hit.\n if ( this:GetName() == (this:GetParent():GetName()..\"CheckButtonOn\" ) ) then\n myClockConfig[myClockRealm][myClockChar].on = this:GetChecked(); -- set profile\n elseif ( this:GetName() == (this:GetParent():GetName()..\"CheckButtonTime24\" ) ) then\n myClockConfig[myClockRealm][myClockChar].time24 = this:GetChecked();\n elseif ( this:GetName() == (this:GetParent():GetName()..\"SliderOffset\" ) ) then\n myClockConfig[myClockRealm].offset = this:GetValue();\n end\n -- configuration was changed, make sure our addon changes too!\n -- notice our addon is changed right away, not when we hit 'done'.\n myClock_ConfigChange();\n end\nAgain we have a check to make sure our profile is loaded, and then a mock switch/case statement to determine which CheckButton was pressed. Once we know, it's a simple issue of using this:GetChecked() or this:GetValue() to set our profile config! At the end we make sure our main addon knows that something was changed.\nAlternatively you could leave out the 'myClock_ConfigChange();' of this function, and add it to the Done button OnClick event to make a Save/Cancel dialog. Generally speaking for a config people want to see the changes happen live so they can tweak them.\nYou're done! Hopefully this provided some concrete examples on how to make a config dialog, and much thanks to Scheid for being the ginipig! You could easily go from here to make a more complex configuration pane, using tabs, multiple pages, or even using Cosmos' Khaos (another howto someday)."}

This tutorial describes the necessary steps to add the ability to handle slash commands to your addon.\nSummary: assign a handler function to codice_1, and create codice_2, ..., codice_3 global constants containing the desired command names, where \"key\" is some unique command-specific string.\nBackground.\nSlash command handlers are typically invoked by Blizzard's FrameXML code handling the player's chat input; therefore, an addon offering a slash command must register the command by placing certain values in a location where the chat input handling code looks for them.\nAn addon must create a function that would handle the slash command (possibly parsing the argument string passed to it), and place it into the SlashCmdList table. Additionally, an addon must declare which slash commands it wishes to bind to its handler function.\nStrategy.\nHere is a simple example that can be placed anywhere in a Lua file:\n -- 1. Pick HELLOWORLD as the unique identifier.\n -- 2. Pick /hiw and /hellow as slash commands (/hi and /hello are actual emotes)\n SLASH_HELLOWORLD1, SLASH_HELLOWORLD2 = '/hiw', '/hellow'; -- 3.\n function SlashCmdList.HELLOWORLD(msg, editBox) -- 4.\n print(\"Hello, World!\");\n end\nParsing Arguments.\nIf the user types /yourcmd someargs into chat, the function handling /yourcmd is passed \"someargs\" as the first argument (the second being the edit box widget into which the slash command was typed). Your handler function can then choose to act on that argument string. For simple slash commands, comparisons to pre-determined strings may be sufficient: suppose we wanted to modify the \"Hello, World!\" example above to display a different string if the command was passed an argument (say /hiw bye):\n SLASH_HELLOWORLD1, SLASH_HELLOWORLD2 = '/hiw', '/hellow';\n local function handler(msg, editBox)\n if msg == 'bye' then\n print('Goodbye, World!')\n else\n print(\"Hello, World!\")\n end\n end\n SlashCmdList[\"HELLOWORLD\"] = handler; -- Also a valid assignment strategy\nMore complex slash commands may wish to use &lt;a href=\"Pattern%20matching\"&gt;Pattern matching&lt;/a&gt; to parse the arguments string:\n local function handler(msg, editBox)\n local command, rest = msg:match(\"^(%S*)%s*(.-)$\")\n -- Any leading non-whitespace is captured into command\n -- the rest (minus leading whitespace) is captured into rest.\n if command == \"add\" and rest ~= \"\" then\n -- Handle adding of the contents of rest... to something.\n elseif command == \"remove\" and rest ~= \"\" then\n -- Handle removing of the contents of rest... to something. \n else\n -- If not handled above, display some sort of help message\n print(\"Syntax: /yourcmd (add|remove) someIdentifier\")\n end\n end\nNotes.\n SLASH_BLAH1 = \"/blah\"\n SlashCmdList[\"BLAH\"] = function(msg, editBox)\n -- change the text on the editBox.\n editBox:Show()\n editBox:SetText(\"Blah blah blah!\")\n end\n function SomeObject:SlashHandler(msg, editBox)\n -- do stuff\n end\n SLASH_BLAH1 = \"/blah\"\n SlashCmdList[\"BLAH\"] = function(msg, editBox)\n SomeObject:SlashHandler(msg, editBox)\n end"}
{"id": "46333", "revid": "40286632", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=46333", "title": "Creating defaults", "text": "This is a basic HOWTO to help you create defaults for your addon. First, I'm going to assume you are at least familiar with how to start an addon, and make it save variables. If not, please check out &lt;a href=\"AddOns\"&gt;this page on how to start an addon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Saving%20variables%20between%20game%20sessions\"&gt;Saving variables between game sessions&lt;/a&gt;. This is required knowledge for our defaults.\nThe Basics.\nLet's begin. At the top of the page, before any functions, add this:\n local ThisAddon_Defaults = {\n [\"Options\"] = {\n [\"MasterOnOff\"] = \"On\",\n [\"version\"] = \"1.0\",\n [\"debug\"] = false,\n [\"More Random Variables\"] = Value,\n };\nNow for an explanation...\nThere we go. This is a quick and easy way to set up defaults.\nThe Next Step.\nNow let's add a bit more complexity. I mean, we have the list of defaults... Now what can we do with them?\nInitialization.\nLet's make it so when the addon starts, if the settings aren't there, the defaults will be set! So, for this, let's assume we have a options variable being saved, by the name of \"ThisAddon_Options\". All of our options settings are saved to that, and this is saved from session to session. So let's save our options!\nThe XML.\nFirst off, we need to make a function that we call when our addon has finished loading... To do that, first we need to add a line to the OnLoad section of our XML file.\n &lt;Scripts&gt;\n &lt;OnLoad&gt;\n this:RegisterEvent(\"VARIABLES_LOADED\");\n &lt;/OnLoad&gt;\n &lt;/Scripts&gt;\nThis gives our addon something to look for to see if it has finished loading. If our addon was a LoadOnDemand type of addon (not loaded until it is needed), we would want to use \"ADDON_LOADED\".\nAlso, while we're here, let's add a bit of code we'll need later. After &lt;/OnLoad&gt;, add the following:\n &lt;OnEvent&gt;\n if (event == \"VARIABLES_LOADED\") then\n ThisAddon_Loaded();\n end\n &lt;/OnEvent&gt;\nThis will tell our addon to run the ThisAddon_Loaded() function as soon as the addon has been fully loaded.\nOkay! We're done here! Let's jump back to our main code!\nThe Main Code.\nNow we can write our post-load function... This will run after the addon has been fully loaded. We do it this way, because if we call things that haven't been loaded yet, then our addon will fail, and output an error message. This way, everything will have already been loaded.\n function ThisAddon_Loaded()\n if (not ThisAddon_Options) then\n ThisAddon_Options = ThisAddon_Defaults[\"Options\"];\n DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessage(\"ThisAddon Options database not found. Generating...\");\n end\n end\nSee? We're done. Fairly simple. And if we end up changing our defaults, then we don't have to type them in again.\nThe Future....\nThe Possibilities.\nThere's even more we can do with Defaults. You'll noticed that I added [\"version\"] to the list of defaults at the top. There is an excellent reason for this.\nLet's say that I did some more work, and created a new version of the addon, Version 1.2, and I changed, removed, and added a lot of options to the defaults. Rather than tell people to delete the existing settings they have, let's write a code that will automatically update their options upon finding the version difference!\nBut first, let's add a global at the top of the page:\n ThisAddon_Version = \"1.0\";\nThis will make it easy for us to check and update the internal version number. In fact, in the Defaults, we can set \n [\"version\"] = ThisAddon_Version;\nwhich will make it even easier to check and change versions.\nBack to the Loaded Code!\nIn our function ThisAddon_Loaded() code, at the very end of it, let's add the following code:\n if (ThisAddon_Options[\"version\"] &lt; ThisAddon_Version) then\n ThisAddon_Options_temp = ThisAddon_Defaults[\"Options\"];\n for k,v in ThisAddon_Options do\n if (ThisAddon_Defaults[\"Options\"][k]) then\n ThisAddon_Options_temp[k] = v;\n end\n end\n ThisAddon_Options_temp[\"version\"] = ThisAddon_Version;\n ThisAddon_Options = ThisAddon_Options_temp;\n end\nAdvanced Default Setting Updating.\nHaving worked with this for so long now, I've developed even more advanced methods for using these defaults.\nThe first thing I've done is seperated the update code from the loading code, so it is it's own function. Another change I've made is that it can now work with tables within tables. The following can work with up to 3 levels of tables within your defaults. (Main level, 1 subtable, and a subtable within that.)\nYou will also notice that if the version you are upgrading from is below or equal to version 1.2, then an error message will be displayed using a custom message display function. (Which I won't get into here.) This is useful if you've made major database changes and don't feel like making an adaptor for the settings. A common use of this would be if you had a lot of settings, but decided to move them into a subtable. This would ensure the old settings were erased. This functionality should be used sparingly.\n function ThisAddon_OptionUpdate()\n local temp = ThisAddon_Defaults[\"Options\"];\n if (ThisAddon_Settings[\"Version\"]) and (ThisAddon_Settings[\"Version\"] &lt;= \"1.2\") then\n ThisAddon_Error_Msg(\"Your Database is Severely out of date. Some settings may not have carried over.\");\n else\n for k,v in pairs(ThisAddon_Settings) do\n if (type(ThisAddon_Settings[k]) == \"table\") then\n for k2,v2 in pairs(ThisAddon_Settings[k]) do\n if (type(ThisAddon_Settings[k][k2]) == \"table\") then\n for k3,v3 in pairs(ThisAddon_Settings[k][k2]) do\n if (ThisAddon_Settings[k][k2][k3]) then\n temp[k][k2][k3] = v3;\n end\n end\n else\n if (ThisAddon_Settings[k][k2]) then\n temp[k][k2] = v2;\n end\n end\n end\n else\n if (ThisAddon_Settings[k]) then\n temp[k] = v;\n end\n end\n end\n end\n temp[\"Version\"] = ThisAddon_Version;\n ThisAddon_Settings = {};\n ThisAddon_Settings = temp;\n end\nNow let's go through this;\nThat's the basics of this new setting. The best thing is, now in our Post-Load function, instead of writing all that out, we just call:\n if (not ThisAddon_Settings[\"Version\"]) or (ThisAddon_Settings[\"Version\"] &lt; ThisAddon_Version) then\n ThisAddon_OptionUpdate();\n end\nNow you can do even more with defaults! If you come up with something new and original, put it on this HowTo's Discussion page! I'd love to see how people use this!"}
{"id": "12398", "revid": "41446499", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=12398", "title": "Creating key bindings", "text": "Key bindings allow addons to perform actions when a user presses a specific combination of modifier keys and keyboard or mouse buttons. If the addon always offers the same set of bindings, the codice_1 file can be used to declare these in advance, and FrameXML will include these in the built-in Key Bindings UI. Alternatively, addons may create bindings manually using the and families of API functions.\nSetting key bindings is protected in combat -- addons can only change bindings in combat by using the binding-related functions present on frame handles in a &lt;a href=\"RestrictedEnvironment%23Frame%20handle%20methods\"&gt;restricted environment&lt;/a&gt;.\nUsing Bindings.xml to create static bindings.\nIf you know the exact list of actions you want to let users configure keybindings for, you can use the codice_1 file to specify static bindings. This method of creating bindings also allows you to rely on Blizzard's Key Bindings UI to allow users to customize your bindings, vastly reducing the amount of binding-handling code you'll need to write. Bindings.xml allows you to create bindings that perform one of these actions:\nNote that you may not combine these actions in a single binding -- so only the macro or click options will let you both use an item and cast a spell using one button press.\nTo use codice_1 in your addon, you should create a codice_1 file in your addon directory (relative to the World of Warcraft directory: codice_5). The WoW client will automatically load this file, so you should not list it in your .toc file. The file should contain an outer &lt;Bindings&gt; tag, which in turn should contain a &lt;Binding&gt; tag for each action you wish to use. For example:\n &lt;Bindings&gt;\n &lt;Binding name=\"SPELL Moonfire\" header=\"WOWPEDIAUIDEMO\" /&gt;\n &lt;Binding name=\"SPELL Starfire\" /&gt;\n &lt;/Bindings&gt;\nwould add bindings for casting Moonfire and Starfire to the default Key Bindings UI.\nSpecifying bindings.\nEach binding you want to create should be specified using the &lt;Binding&gt; tag, which has the following three attributes:\nIf you want to run custom Lua code, it should be placed inside the &lt;Binding&gt; tag. From within this code snippet, you may access the binding state using the codice_8 variable, which will be \"down\" when the binding is pressed, and \"up\" when the binding is released (the latter is only observable for runOnUp=\"true\" bindings).\n Bindings.xml must be valid XML in order for your bindings to appear. If you need to include the &lt; character in your custom Lua code within a &lt;Binding&gt; tag, you should to escape it as &amp;lt;, or wrap the contents of the tag in codice_9 ... codice_10.\nExample.\nSpecify the bindings in codice_1:\n &lt;Bindings&gt;\n &lt;Binding name=\"SPELL Moonfire\" runOnUp=\"true\" header=\"WOWPEDIAUIDEMO\" default=\"SHIFT-F\"&gt;\n print(\"Fooled! This print statement will never run.\")\n &lt;/Binding&gt;\n &lt;Binding name=\"REVERSEFLOWPOLARITY\"&gt;print(\"Neutron flow polarity reversed\")&lt;/Binding&gt;\n &lt;Binding name=\"ACTIVATETRANSMOGRIFIER\" runOnUp=\"true\"&gt;\n if keystate == \"down\" then\n print(\"Transmogrifier activated. Release binding to deactivate\")\n else\n print(\"Transmogrifier deactivated\")\n end\n &lt;/Binding&gt;\n &lt;/Bindings&gt;\nSpecify localized text in codice_12:\n BINDING_HEADER_WOWPEDIAUIDEMO = \"Custom Keybindings AddOn\"\n _G[\"BINDING_NAME_SPELL Moonfire\"] = \"Cast Moonfire\"\n BINDING_NAME_REVERSEFLOWPOLARITY = \"Reverse neutron flow polarity\"\n BINDING_NAME_ACTIVATETRANSMOGRIFIER = \"Activate the ransmogrifier\"\nCreate codice_13:\n ## Interface: \n ## Title: Keybindings Demo\n BindingsDemo.lua\nTo execute this example as an addon, create the codice_14 directory and place the three specified files within it.\nCreating dynamic keybindings in Lua.\nYou may also set keybindings in Lua code, which allows you to create and modify key bindings dynamically -- for instance, in response to the player's class, level, location, or configuration of your addon. However, without Bindings.xml, your addon will be responsible for presenting its own bindings configuration UI to the user.\n Setting and clearing bindings is a protected action, and cannot be performed by insecure addon code while in combat lockdown.\nFor more permanent bindings, similar in scope to those created by codice_1, you can use the family of API functions. The functions take a binding string, and arguments specifying the action to be performed. Notably, if you use this method to bind a key already bound to some action in the default Key Bindings UI, that binding will be unbound. The functions are:\nThere is no API function to create a binding to execute custom Lua code. If that behavior is desired, you can use in conjunction with an OnClick handler on your own Button widget:\n local btn = CreateFrame(\"BUTTON\", \"MyBindingHandlingButton\")\n SetBindingClick(\"SHIFT-T\", btn:GetName())\n btn:SetScript(\"OnClick\", function(self, button, down)\n -- As we have not specified the button argument to SetBindingClick,\n -- the binding will be mapped to a LeftButton click.\n print(\"You triggered the binding using\", button)\n end)\nIf you want to merely override, but not unbind, the bindings in the Key Bindings UI, you can use the family of API functions. The functions take an \"owner\" frame handle, a flag indicating priority (priority override bindings take precedence over non-priority override bindings, which take precedence over normal bindings), a binding string, and argument specifying the action to be performed. All override bindings owned by a particular frame handle can be cleared using . The functions are:\nDynamic bindings in combat.\nThe SetOverrideBindings family of functions is present in the &lt;a href=\"RestrictedEnvironment\"&gt;restricted environment&lt;/a&gt;, as the frame:SetBinding() family of functions. Addons may take advantage of this to update override bindings in combat using &lt;a href=\"SecureHandlers\"&gt;SecureHandlers&lt;/a&gt;, but only in response to a very limited number of events, including:\nFor example, this can be used to create an addon binding that only exists while the player has a hostile unit targeted:\n local frame = CreateFrame(\"Frame\", nil, nil, \"SecureHandlerStateTemplate\")\n frame:SetAttribute(\"_onstate-wpbinding\", )\n RegisterStateDriver(frame, \"wpbinding\", \"[@target,harm] on; off\")"}
{"id": "24807", "revid": "56438031", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=24807", "title": "Creating simple pop-up dialog boxes", "text": "Static popups are simple dialog boxes seen with logging off, accepting summons, sending money through the mail, renaming a pet, and so forth. This tutorial describes using StaticPopup code to insert simple dialogs to an addon.\ncodice_1 handles all of the basic UI elements (positioning, sound effects, layout).\nBasic setup.\nNew dialogs are created by adding an entry to the global codice_2 table, and populating the entry with required and optional information. Here is a simple two-button entry:\nStaticPopupDialogs[\"EXAMPLE_HELLOWORLD\"] = {\n text = \"Do you want to greet the world today?\",\n button1 = \"Yes\",\n button2 = \"No\",\n OnAccept = function()\n SendChatMessage(\"HelloWorld!\", \"SAY\")\n end,\n timeout = 0,\n whileDead = true,\n hideOnEscape = true,\nStaticPopup_Show(\"EXAMPLE_HELLOWORLD\")\nThe index into the array is an arbitrary string, but it should be unique within the array. Many elements in this example are optional, but have customary uses suitable for most addons.\nTo display the dialog, call () with the name of the entry. This function returns a reference to the static popup frame, or nil if unsuccessful (i.e. if four simultaneous static popups are already shown).\nUsually the dialog will be configured to hide itself (pressing a button, pressing escape or after a timeout), but this may also be done programmatically with (). Different addons may have concurrent popups, so it is necessary to supply arguments indicating which entry to hide.\nAdvanced configuration.\nLocalization.\nFor a simple popup in any language, use YES, NO, ACCEPT, CANCEL, DELETE, OKAY, or CONTINUE on button labels; and CONFIRM_CONTINUE for text (\"Do you wish to continue?\").\nStaticPopupDialogs[\"EXAMPLE_CONFIRM\"] = {\n text = CONFIRM_CONTINUE,\n button1 = ACCEPT,\n button2 = CANCEL,\nDialog text parameters.\nThe \"text\" field of an entry can contain formatting placeholders. When the popup is actually displayed,\nthe calling function can pass two additional arguments to codice_3. The \"text\" field and\nthese two arguments will be passed through the &lt;a href=\"API_format\"&gt;format&lt;/a&gt; function before being added to the dialog.\nFor example, the default guild invitation popup sets codice_4, and the display call is to codice_5.\nEditable text fields.\nTo add a editbox in the popup set the \"hasEditBox\" option field to true. The EditBox gets the name \"$parentEditBox\", relative to the Popup, and is also available in the popup's \".editBox\" field. (Recall that the popup dialog is the value returned from the \"StaticPopup_Show()\" function.) To get and set the value of the EditBox use the following code:\n OnShow = function (self, data)\n self.editBox:SetText(\"Some text goes here\")\n end,\n OnAccept = function (self, data, data2)\n local text = self.editBox:GetText()\n -- do whatever you want with it\n end,\n hasEditBox = true\nMore complicated usage might be to use OnShow to call codice_6 (graying out the Accept button), and then including the following in your options table to allow the Accept button to be clicked as soon as the user types something in the text field:\n EditBoxOnTextChanged = function (self, data) -- careful! 'self' here points to the editbox, not the dialog\n self:GetParent().button1:Enable() -- self:GetParent() is the dialog\n end\nUsing \"hasEditBox\"/\".editBox\" causes a small one-line text field to appear. By default this is 130 pixels wide; you can set the optional \"editBoxWidth\" key to change the width. (There used to be a \"hasWideEditBox\" boolean key that would create a \".wideEditBox\" field in the dialog; in Cataclysm these were replaced by a \"editBoxWidth\" of 260 to 350.) The editbox will respect the \"maxLetters\" field if you set it (most editbox popups used by Blizzard set this to 24 or 31).\nPassing arguments to local functions.\nIt is possible, though not immediately obvious how, to pass arbitrary user data to the local functions (e.g. OnAccept, OnCancel). Write your local function like this:\n OnAccept = function (self, data, data2)\n DoSomethingWith(data)\n end\nAnd make the call like this:\n varName = \"Some value\" -- This is the data you want to use in OnAccept\n varName2 = \"Some other value\" -- This is the data you want to use in OnAccept\n local dialog = StaticPopup_Show(\"YOUR_POPUP\") -- dialog contains the frame object\n if (dialog) then\n dialog.data = varName -- set the frame's data field to the value you want\n dialog.data2 = varName2\n end\nThe dialog's fields \"data\" and \"data2\" are passed as additional arguments to OnAccept. The \"data\" field is passed to OnCancel and OnAlt (the function called if button3 is set), but not \"data2\". They are also accessible through the dialog itself, as \"self.data\" and \"self.data2\". In this example they are strings, but they can be of any type including tables.\nNotice that you are actually setting the frame's data \"after\" you have called StaticPopup_Show. This works because popping up a dialog box does not halt script execution. The dialog box isn't even visible to the player until after the current script execution cycle completes. By the time the player clicks a button to run OnAccept/OnCancel/etc, all of this code will have long since finished.\nIf you need to manipulate any of the dialog's visual elements, most of them are directly accessible as table fields of the dialog, so you do not need to use an expensive sequence of \"getglobal(self:GetName()..\"Something\")\". For example, \"dialog.button1\" points to the first button. See the StaticPopup.xml file's various OnLoad sections for the full list.\nExample.\nAs an example, consider the pre WoW 1.11.0 \"Ready Check\" from &lt;a href=\"CTMod\"&gt;CT_RaidAssist&lt;/a&gt;, which pops up a two-button dialog box with a 30-second timeout. The CT authors implemented everything from scratch: 107 lines of XML specifying window, field, and button sizes, plus a couple lines of Lua here and there. It could be replaced with something like the following:\n StaticPopupDialogs[\"EXAMPLE_CTRA_READY\"] = {\n text = \"%s has performed a ready check. Are you ready?\",\n -- YES, NO, ACCEPT, CANCEL, etc, are global WoW variables containing localized\n -- strings, and should be used wherever possible.\n button1 = YES,\n button2 = NO,\n OnAccept = function()\n CT_RA_SendReady()\n end,\n OnCancel = function (_,_, reason)\n if reason == \"timeout\" or reason == \"clicked\" then\n CT_RA_SendNotReady()\n else\n -- \"override\" ...?\n end;\n end,\n sound = \"levelup2\",\n timeout = 30,\n whileDead = true,\n hideOnEscape = true,\nand called via\n StaticPopup_Show (\"EXAMPLE_CTRA_READY\", CT_RA_CheckReady_Person)\n(Note: the above was written before the 1.11 game patch added a builtin ready check. While ready checks no longer need\nto be implemented by addon authors, the example is simple enough to remain here.)"}

You can do it directly in your XML, or as Lua in the Scripts/OnLoad section of your , or right after you call CreateFrame in .\nExample.\nPure XML method:\n &lt;Frame name=\"YourFrame\" toplevel=\"true\" movable=\"true\" enableMouse=\"true\" hidden=\"true\"\n parent=\"UIParent\"&gt;\n &lt;Attributes&gt;\n &lt;Attribute name=\"UIPanelLayout-defined\" type=\"boolean\" value=\"true\"/&gt;\n &lt;Attribute name=\"UIPanelLayout-enabled\" type=\"boolean\" value=\"true\"/&gt;\n &lt;Attribute name=\"UIPanelLayout-area\" type=\"string\" value=\"left\"/&gt;\n &lt;Attribute name=\"UIPanelLayout-pushable\" type=\"number\" value=\"5\"/&gt;\n &lt;Attribute name=\"UIPanelLayout-whileDead\" type=\"boolean\" value=\"true\"/&gt;\n &lt;/Attributes&gt;\nPure Lua method:\n MyFrameName:SetAttribute(\"UIPanelLayout-defined\", true)\n MyFrameName:SetAttribute(\"UIPanelLayout-enabled\", true)\n MyFrameName:SetAttribute(\"UIPanelLayout-area\", \"left\")\n MyFrameName:SetAttribute(\"UIPanelLayout-pushable\", 5)\n --MyFrameName:SetAttribute(\"UIPanelLayout-width\", width) -- Custom width is not recommended.\n MyFrameName:SetAttribute(\"UIPanelLayout-whileDead\", true)\nDetailed Information.\nWoW's \"UI Panels\" system considers the screen to be divided into three areas: Left, Center and Right. That's enough space for three \"single-width\" frames side by side (or one \"double-width\" plus one \"single-width\" frame), but no more than that. Any attempt to open a 4th frame would cause another frame to close (almost always starting with the leftmost frame first (the rules are explained in-depth further below); so whichever frame is in the \"left\" panel slot at the moment will usually be closed first). Furthermore, the game automatically sorts the panels using a complex system of \"area\" values and \"pushable\"-priorities, which is all explained in detail below.\n\"UIPanelLayout-area\" tells the game which area you want your frame to reside in. The possibilities are:\n\"UIPanelLayout-pushable\" specifies the sorting and \"pushability\" of your panel, within your chosen \"area\". The \"pushability\" aspect mostly applies to the \"left\" (and in a roundabout way \"doublewide\") choices, and it works as follows:\n\"UIPanelLayout-width\" controls the effective width of the UI panel (for stacking purposes), used as an override for frame:GetWidth(). Not recommended, unless you have a very specific reason to want a different width than the frame's \"true width\". You should simply omit this value/attribute completely, in most cases.\n\"UIPanelLayout-whileDead\" specifies that the frame can be opened while the player is dead. Omit this field/attribute (or set it to nil/false if setting it via Lua, or false if setting it via XML) to prevent the player from accessing the frame while dead. Or set it to boolean true (as seen in the examples above) if you want the frame to be openable while dead.\nLastly, you'll need to always use &lt;a href=\"API%20ShowUIPanel\"&gt;ShowUIPanel&lt;/a&gt;(frame) and HideUIPanel(frame) instead of frame:Show() / Hide(), to tell blizzard's UI Panel code to handle your frame and its stacking, as desired.

{"id": "18105", "revid": "40372170", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=18105", "title": "Creating tabbed windows", "text": "= Introduction =\nAs your UI is growing more and more complex you will spend quite some time organizing your UI elements in a way that's user-friendly but still leaves enough capabilities to make use of the more advanced features in your AddOns. \nA great way to achieve this with very little effort is the use of Tabs. \nYou probably know these from the Character or Friendsframe windows in WoW. With Tabs you have the ability to store multiple windows inside of a single one. Tabs are a very important feature in UI design, since their introduction in early &lt;a href=\"Mac\"&gt;MacOS&lt;/a&gt; they became kind of a pseudo-standard in recent graphical applications, such as Mozilla Firefox. \nUnfortunately the amount of code necessary to generate even a simple tabbing system in WoW is quite large. However, the guys at Blizzard implemented an easy-to-use library that makes the task of handling tabs a whole lot more comfortable.\n= The Theory behind it =\nBlizzard's approach on Tabs is pretty straightforward: The buttons for switching between the different Tabs are simply just that, buttons! The OnClick handler of each button hides the current UI-elements and shows the ones that correspond to the selected Tab. Blizzard's library adds some eye candy to it, so that it's easier to identify which tab is active at the moment. Take a peek at some of the tabbed windows that are in the game and you'll see what i mean.\n= Getting our hands dirty =\nFirst of all: The library for Tabs is included in the UIPanelTemplates XML and LUA files. If you are unsure about how certain things work, take a look at them. For an excellent example of tabbed interface implementation, check out the source code for the CT_ExpenseHistory mod &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.ctmod.net\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\nTabs in XML.\nLet's start off with the frame that will serve as the outermost container of our tabbed interface. Inside this frame, you will embed child frames that will each define a single \"page\" of the interface, and you will write button click handlers that show a single page at a time and hide the rest.\nThis might look like a lot of code, and it is. Nature of the beast with the WoW XML UI.\n &lt;Frame\n name=\"myTabContainerFrame\"\n toplevel=\"true\"\n frameStrata=\"DIALOG\"\n movable=\"true\"\n enableMouse=\"true\"\n hidden=\"false\"\n parent=\"UIParent\"&gt;\n &lt;Size&gt;\n &lt;AbsDimension x=\"480\" y=\"325\"/&gt;\n &lt;/Size&gt;\n &lt;Anchors&gt;\n &lt;Anchor point=\"CENTER\"&gt;\n &lt;Offset&gt;&lt;AbsDimension x=\"-200\" y=\"200\"/&gt;&lt;/Offset&gt;\n &lt;/Anchor&gt;\n &lt;/Anchors&gt;\n &lt;Backdrop\n bgFile=\"Interface\\DialogFrame\\UI-DialogBox-Background\"\n edgeFile=\"Interface\\DialogFrame\\UI-DialogBox-Border\"\n tile=\"true\"&gt;\n &lt;BackgroundInsets&gt;\n &lt;AbsInset left=\"11\" right=\"12\" top=\"12\" bottom=\"11\"/&gt;\n &lt;/BackgroundInsets&gt;\n &lt;TileSize&gt;\n &lt;AbsValue val=\"32\"/&gt;\n &lt;/TileSize&gt;\n &lt;EdgeSize&gt;\n &lt;AbsValue val=\"32\"/&gt;\n &lt;/EdgeSize&gt;\n &lt;/Backdrop&gt;\n &lt;Layers&gt;\n &lt;Layer level=\"ARTWORK\"&gt;\n &lt;Texture name=\"myFrameHeader\" file=\"Interface\\DialogFrame\\UI-DialogBox-Header\"&gt;\n &lt;Size&gt;\n &lt;AbsDimension x=\"356\" y=\"64\"/&gt;\n &lt;/Size&gt;\n &lt;Anchors&gt;\n &lt;Anchor point=\"TOP\"&gt;\n &lt;Offset&gt;\n &lt;AbsDimension x=\"0\" y=\"12\"/&gt;\n &lt;/Offset&gt;\n &lt;/Anchor&gt;\n &lt;/Anchors&gt;\n &lt;/Texture&gt;\n &lt;FontString inherits=\"GameFontNormal\" text=\"My Frame\"&gt;\n &lt;Anchors&gt;\n &lt;Anchor point=\"TOP\" relativeTo=\"myFrameHeader\"&gt;\n &lt;Offset&gt;\n &lt;AbsDimension x=\"0\" y=\"-14\"/&gt;\n &lt;/Offset&gt;\n &lt;/Anchor&gt;\n &lt;/Anchors&gt;\n &lt;/FontString&gt;\n &lt;/Layer&gt;\n &lt;/Layers&gt;\n &lt;Frames&gt;\n &lt;Frame name=\"myTabPage1\" hidden=\"false\"&gt;\n &lt;Anchors&gt;\n &lt;Anchor point=\"TOPLEFT\"/&gt;\n &lt;Anchor point=\"BOTTOMRIGHT\"/&gt;\n &lt;/Anchors&gt;\n &lt;Layers&gt;\n &lt;Layer level=\"ARTWORK\"&gt;\n &lt;FontString inherits=\"GameFontNormal\" text=\"My Frame 1\"&gt;\n &lt;Anchors&gt;\n &lt;Anchor point=\"TOPLEFT\" relativeTo=\"$parent\"&gt;\n &lt;Offset&gt;\n &lt;AbsDimension x=\"20\" y=\"-30\"/&gt;\n &lt;/Offset&gt;\n &lt;/Anchor&gt;\n &lt;/Anchors&gt;\n &lt;/FontString&gt;\n &lt;/Layer&gt;\n &lt;/Layers&gt;\n &lt;Frames&gt;\n &lt;/Frames&gt; \n &lt;/Frame&gt; \n &lt;Frame name=\"myTabPage2\" hidden=\"true\"&gt;\n &lt;Anchors&gt;\n &lt;Anchor point=\"TOPLEFT\"/&gt;\n &lt;Anchor point=\"BOTTOMRIGHT\"/&gt;\n &lt;/Anchors&gt;\n &lt;Layers&gt;\n &lt;Layer level=\"ARTWORK\"&gt;\n &lt;FontString inherits=\"GameFontNormal\" text=\"My Frame 2\"&gt;\n &lt;Anchors&gt;\n &lt;Anchor point=\"TOPLEFT\" relativeTo=\"$parent\"&gt;\n &lt;Offset&gt;\n &lt;AbsDimension x=\"20\" y=\"-30\"/&gt;\n &lt;/Offset&gt;\n &lt;/Anchor&gt;\n &lt;/Anchors&gt;\n &lt;/FontString&gt;\n &lt;/Layer&gt;\n &lt;/Layers&gt;\n &lt;Frames&gt;\n &lt;/Frames&gt; \n &lt;/Frame&gt;\n &lt;Button name=\"$parentTab1\" inherits=\"CharacterFrameTabButtonTemplate\" id=\"1\" text=\"My Tab 1\"&gt;\n &lt;Anchors&gt;\n &lt;Anchor point=\"CENTER\" relativePoint=\"BOTTOMLEFT\"&gt;\n &lt;Offset&gt;\n &lt;AbsDimension x=\"60\" y=\"-12\"/&gt;\n &lt;/Offset&gt;\n &lt;/Anchor&gt;\n &lt;/Anchors&gt;\n &lt;Scripts&gt;\n &lt;OnClick&gt;\n PanelTemplates_SetTab(myTabContainerFrame, 1);\n myTabPage1:Show();\n myTabPage2:Hide();\n &lt;/OnClick&gt;\n &lt;/Scripts&gt;\n &lt;/Button&gt;\n &lt;Button name=\"$parentTab2\" inherits=\"CharacterFrameTabButtonTemplate\" id=\"2\" text=\"My Tab 2\"&gt;\n &lt;Anchors&gt;\n &lt;Anchor point=\"LEFT\" relativeTo=\"$parentTab1\" relativePoint=\"RIGHT\"&gt;\n &lt;Offset&gt;\n &lt;AbsDimension x=\"-16\" y=\"0\"/&gt;\n &lt;/Offset&gt;\n &lt;/Anchor&gt;\n &lt;/Anchors&gt;\n &lt;Scripts&gt;\n &lt;OnClick&gt;\n PanelTemplates_SetTab(myTabContainerFrame, 2);\n myTabPage1:Hide();\n myTabPage2:Show();\n &lt;/OnClick&gt;\n &lt;/Scripts&gt;\n &lt;/Button&gt;\n &lt;/Frames&gt;\n &lt;Scripts&gt;\n &lt;OnLoad&gt;\n this.elapsed = 0;\n PanelTemplates_SetNumTabs(myTabContainerFrame, 2);\n PanelTemplates_SetTab(myTabContainerFrame, 1);\n &lt;/OnLoad&gt;\n &lt;OnShow&gt;\n PlaySound(\"UChatScrollButton\");\n PanelTemplates_SetTab(myTabContainerFrame, 1);\n myTabPage1:Show()\n myTabPage2:Hide()\n &lt;/OnShow&gt;\n &lt;OnHide&gt;\n PlaySound(\"UChatScrollButton\");\n &lt;/OnHide&gt;\n &lt;/Scripts&gt;\n &lt;/Frame&gt;\nThis is a completely functional, self contained Tab Frame which you should be able to plop into any WoW XML UI file and run (as of Apr. 23, 2008). There are a lot of redundancies here. Things like the tab button properties should be templated and the logic controlling the selection of tabs is best handled by a custom function.\nThings like the tab button properties should be templated if you're going to have lots of tabs. As mentioned before, from an UI's point of view, tabs are simply some buttons at the bottom of your frame. You should define a template like this in XML, and then implement a smart click handler in Lua:\n &lt;Button name=\"myFrameTabTemplate\" inherits=\"CharacterFrameTabButtonTemplate\" virtual=\"true\"&gt;\n &lt;Scripts&gt;\n &lt;OnClick&gt;\n myButtonHandler(this:GetName());\n &lt;/OnClick&gt;\n &lt;/Scripts&gt;\n &lt;/Button&gt;\nThis will reduce the amount of code you need per tab. As an example, your first tab would be only:\n &lt;Button name=\"$parentTab1\" inherits=\"myFrameTabTemplate\" id=\"1\" text=\"My Tab 1\"&gt;\n &lt;Anchors&gt;\n &lt;Anchor point=\"CENTER\" relativePoint=\"BOTTOMLEFT\"&gt;\n &lt;Offset&gt;\n &lt;AbsDimension x=\"60\" y=\"-8\"/&gt;\n &lt;/Offset&gt;\n &lt;/Anchor&gt;\n &lt;/Anchors&gt;\n &lt;/Button&gt;\nI'll leave the implementation of myButtonHandler() as an exercise for the reader.\nWe are inheriting from the template that's used for the CharacterFrame. You can find it at the top of the CharacterFrame.XML file. By using this template we basically provide WoW with the data structure that is specified by the Tab library. If you take a look at the source of the template, you'll notice that this is quite complex.\nLet's look at our existing buttons:\n &lt;Button name=\"$parentTab1\" inherits=\"CharacterFrameTabButtonTemplate\" id=\"1\" text=\"My Tab 1\"&gt;\n &lt;Anchors&gt;\n &lt;Anchor point=\"CENTER\" relativePoint=\"BOTTOMLEFT\"&gt;\n &lt;Offset&gt;\n &lt;AbsDimension x=\"60\" y=\"-8\"/&gt;\n &lt;/Offset&gt;\n &lt;/Anchor&gt;\n &lt;/Anchors&gt;\n &lt;Scripts&gt;\n &lt;OnClick&gt;\n PanelTemplates_SetTab(myTabContainerFrame, 1);\n myTabPage1:Show();\n myTabPage2:Hide();\n &lt;/OnClick&gt;\n &lt;/Scripts&gt;\n &lt;/Button&gt;\n &lt;Button name=\"$parentTab2\" inherits=\"CharacterFrameTabButtonTemplate\" id=\"2\" text=\"My Tab 2\"&gt;\n &lt;Anchors&gt;\n &lt;Anchor point=\"LEFT\" relativeTo=\"$parentTab1\" relativePoint=\"RIGHT\"&gt;\n &lt;Offset&gt;\n &lt;AbsDimension x=\"-16\" y=\"0\"/&gt;\n &lt;/Offset&gt;\n &lt;/Anchor&gt;\n &lt;/Anchors&gt;\n &lt;Scripts&gt;\n &lt;OnClick&gt;\n PanelTemplates_SetTab(myTabContainerFrame, 2);\n myTabPage1:Hide();\n myTabPage2:Show();\n &lt;/OnClick&gt;\n &lt;/Scripts&gt;\n &lt;/Button&gt;\nNOTE: The names of these buttons \"must\" be exactly \"$parentTab1\", \"$parentTab2\", etc... otherwise the calls to PanelTemplates_UpdateTabs() will fail with an error.\nMost of the Tab management WoW does, is done by 'guessing' names based on specific naming conventions. Notice the id Attribute in the declaration. This specifies the number of your tab, so for the third tab, the id would have to be 3 and so on. Don't forget to adjust the ids for every new button!\nYou won't need any more eventhandlers in there, it's all in the template.\nSo far, so good. Now, let's step over to LUA.\nTabs in LUA.\nLook at the OnLoad code which registers our tabbed frame with Blizzard's UI code, sets which tab should be selected, and then shows and hides the appropriate pages:\n PanelTemplates_SetNumTabs(myTabContainerFrame, 2); -- 2 because there are 2 frames total.\n PanelTemplates_SetTab(myTabContainerFrame, 1); -- 1 because we want tab 1 selected.\n myTabPage1:Show(); -- Show page 1.\n myTabPage2:Hide(); -- Hide all other pages (in this case only one).\nThese lines should be executed before your frame is displayed for the first time. myFrame is the name of your frame, n is the number of tabs you specified.\nTake your time to understand what the PanelTemplates_SetTab()-function does. This is basically the whole trick behind it all. PanelTemplates_SetTab() goes some graphics magic, making the selected tab appear to be selected, while you're left to actually display the proper page.\nNow, let's take a look at the Tab_OnClick() function that we used when creating our button template. What it basically does is setting the selectedTab and then calling UpdateTabs()!\nYou know what that means, don't you? Go ahead and fire up WoW right now (you should outcomment the myButtonHandler() call in the template to avoid errors). You will notice that your tabs are already working just fine! Beside one little thing: They don't do anything yet!\nIn your Lua button handler (the one I left for an exercise), you probably already know what to do: Extract the number of the selected tab from the button's name which was passed as a parameter (this:GetID()), then show the UI elements of the new tab and hide all of the other UI elements. Shouldn't be any problem now, since all of the hard work is already done by the library. So rather than boring you with the details of the implementation, I'll close with some tips on efficient techniques for writing button handlers:\n= Conclusion =\nAs you have seen in the above sections, using tabs ain't that hard at all. As long as you're paying attention to certain naming conventions, making use of Blizzard's library is both powerful and easy to use. \nSince the OnClick-buttonhandler is specified completely independent from the rest of the library, you may also do some very weird and unexpected stuff with tabs if you wish to. \nI hope you enjoyed this tutorial and did not despair over my dessolute style of writing. I'd love to read some feedback in the discussions section and hope that many of you will benefit from the great capabilities that Tabs provide."}

Several creation myths have been &lt;a href=\"Flavor%20lore\"&gt;postulated&lt;/a&gt; by the peoples of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. A collection of these myths can be found below.\n\"Big Bang\" theory.\nSome theorize that a catastrophic cosmic explosion sent the infinite worlds spinning out into the vastness of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark\"&gt;Great Dark&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 worlds that would one day bear life forms of wondrous and terrible diversity.\nLight and Void collision.\nIt is said that in the beginning there was &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; and there was &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; and in a time long ago, the two collided in the abyss of the Great Dark. As a result, infinite worlds spiraled out into the newly forming cosmos.\nCreation God theory.\nOthers believe that the universe was created as a whole by a single all-powerful entity.\n&lt;a href=\"God\"&gt;God&lt;/a&gt; was said to have been revered in Azeroth before the first war by the &lt;a href=\"Clerics%20of%20Northshire\"&gt;Clerics of Northshire&lt;/a&gt; and references to God or a higher power can be found in Warcraft II, as well as the novels.\nCreation titans theory.\nSome believe titans created the original worlds.\nThere is a legend that three &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s ruled over the \"primal plane\" before the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s came and created &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nTitans only seeded existing worlds.\nThe titans, colossal, metallic-skinned gods from the far reaches of the cosmos, explored the newborn universe and set to work on the worlds they encountered. They shaped the worlds by raising mighty mountains and dredging out vast seas. They breathed skies and raging atmospheres into being. It was all part of their unfathomable, far-sighted plan to create order out of chaos. They even empowered primitive races to tend to their works and maintain the integrity of their respective worlds.\nSee &lt;a href=\"The%20Mystery%20of%20the%20Makers\"&gt;The Mystery of the Makers&lt;/a&gt;.\nOld Gods theory.\nMembers of the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; believe that &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt; were the creators of the world and that the titans were the corruptive, so-called shapers, that ruined the world from its original form.\nNight elf mythology.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Moon\"&gt;Temple of the Moon&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt; had frescoes and murals depicting &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt; and many other &lt;a href=\"god\"&gt;god&lt;/a&gt;s (actual gods, not &lt;a href=\"demigod\"&gt;demigod&lt;/a&gt;s) shaping the world.\nNight elves origin.\nIt is said that a primitive tribe of nocturnal humanoids (called the &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei\"&gt;Kaldorei&lt;/a&gt; in some sources) cautiously made their way to the edges of the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;. The feral nomadic humanoids drawn by the Well's strange energies, built crude homes upon its tranquil shores. Over time, the Well's cosmic power affected the strange tribe, making them strong, wise and virtually immortal. The tribe adopted or re-adopted the name Kaldorei, which meant \"children of the stars\" in their native tongue. The Kaldorei, or &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; as they would later be known, worshipped the moon goddess &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt; and believed that she slept within the Well's shimmering depths during the daylight hours.\nSome ancient texts speak that this was a small faction of &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s that broke off from the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20Empire\"&gt;Amani Empire&lt;/a&gt; and founded their own colony in the heart of the dark continent. It is said that these brave pioneers discovered the cosmic Well of Eternity which transformed them into beings of immense power. Some legends suggest that these adventurous trolls were the first night elves, though this theory has never been proven.\nNight elves tend not to believe they originated from trolls, but instead contend that they only came from Elune.\n&lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Freya\"&gt;Freya&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20of%20Ages\"&gt;Tribunal of Ages&lt;/a&gt; confirmed that the night elves evolved from trolls when asked by &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;.\nCentaur origin.\nAccording to some legends, centaur are the sons of &lt;a href=\"Zaetar\"&gt;Zaetar&lt;/a&gt;, one of &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;' sons.\nIn other legends, passed down by night elves, the original centaur were bastard off-spring of Cenarius.\nTauren mythos.\nSee &lt;a href=\"tauren%20mythology\"&gt;tauren mythology&lt;/a&gt;."}

{"id": "14983", "revid": "3400701", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=14983", "title": "Creep", "text": "Creep is a term from \"\" to designate non-affiliated (but aggressive) packs of monsters which guard certain areas from players' armies. Creeps vary depending on the current map &lt;a href=\"tileset\"&gt;tileset&lt;/a&gt;, though it is possible for creeps to appear on other tilesets than the ones they were designed for.\nThe word \"&lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;\" is more often used in \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\".\nTactics.\nThe lands of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; are not safe. Even the indigenous creatures of the wild hold peril for the unwary wanderer. Numerous monsters called creeps camp in strategic locations on the map. Creeps, unlike the harmless &lt;a href=\"critter\"&gt;critter&lt;/a&gt;s on the map, are intelligent creatures with the means and disposition to attack all players. Creeps range in power, or level, much like &lt;a href=\"Hero%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Heroes&lt;/a&gt;. Low-level creeps are simple beasts that can be easily defeated by a few &lt;a href=\"Footman%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Human Footmen&lt;/a&gt;. However, powerful creeps are formidable adversaries capable of laying low weak Heroes, and some are even immune to magic. Such powerful monsters are not to be trifled with. Luckily, they are as rare as they are mighty.\nAll creeps are indiscriminate in their hostilities and are ready to attack the units of any player on sight. However, these monsters will only pursue your units a limited distance. You can usually outrun them if you wish to avoid confrontation. Most Creeps can be found guarding &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Mine%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Gold Mines&lt;/a&gt; or neutral buildings. You can always assume that Creeps defend neutral buildings or Gold Mines unless other players have cleared them. Some positions are defended by very powerful Creeps depending on the map. Creeps are an RPG element of the game that make the game maps feel more alive and add additional options and strategy elements early and then later in the game. It also adds a method for players that are outmatched by another player to try to get back into a game by killing creeps for &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s and levels.\nCreeps give different amounts of experience, &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;, and have different chances of dropping items and have a better possibility of dropping better items. Generally the tougher the Creep is, the greater the reward.\nAny creeps with the passive Envenomed Weapons or Slow Poison will prioritize applying the status onto all hostile units in range before following normal creep aggression regardless of their level.\nCreep camps act as one unit. When one attacks, they all attack. It is possible to pull creeps apart via spells such as Entangling Roots and Sleep or blocking their movement. All Creeps will rejoin an attack if any one of them is hit. Creeps that are not in combat will ignore flying units if they have not been instructed to \"attack move\", unless the unit stops directly above the creep camp, causing any of them with anti-air capabilities to begin attacking, while ground attackers remain idle. \nThe minimap has a special ability to show Creep Camps on the map, indicating the difficulty with three different colors; a green dot indicates a weak creep camp with a total level of 1-9, a brown dot indicates a medium creep camp with a total level of 10-19, and a red dot indicates creep camp with a total level of 20+.\nCreeps have a different auto-acquire range which is usually set at a value of 500 or 200. The 200 value is frequently used as this prevents creeps from being immediately hostile from a distance.\nThe lone exception are buildings, which pulls creeps at a much longer aggression range compared to placing a unit nearby. They are very aggressive with buildings, but will retreat from defensive towers if they fall below 60% health.\nAs special units, Level 6+ Creeps also enjoy a limited magic resistance against enemy spells. Negative spells cast on a 6+ creep will last shorter compared to lower levels.\nLevel 7+ Creeps are smarter than level 1-6 Creeps. The \"smart\" Creeps behave like melee AI units. In particular, these Creeps:\nLevel 7+ Creeps all deal &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20III%20armor%20and%20attack%20types%23Chaos\"&gt;Chaos damage&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe presence of creeps makes it more difficult to scout the map or execute early attacks against other players during the day. Nearly all creeps sleep at night, and during this time can be avoided with ease. It is wise to use the cover of twilight to scout when the creeps leave wanderers undisturbed. You can recognize sleeping creeps by the animated Z over their heads and the sound of their snores. If provoked, sleeping creeps will wake to defend themselves.\nThey will be neutral to you. While a unit is sleeping your units will not auto-acquire them, so at night you can freely scout the map.\nSome Creeps do not sleep during the night, and will not have ZZZs above their head. These creeps include golems (both natural and man-made), sea elementals, adult dragons of all types, bandits and most Outland, demonic and undead creeps. Player units, if made into creeps (charmed, possessed or placed as a hostile unit), will not sleep either.\nCreeps, despite their ability to attack and even kill your troops, are a boon to any player. Every Creep you kill gives you gold. The amount of gold is displayed as a golden number floating above the Creep's corpse immediately after it dies. Some Creeps also leave treasure chests behind. Inside the treasure chests are magic items, special objects that only Heroes and units with the Backpack upgrade can carry. Despite the presence of the &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20Merchant\"&gt;Goblin Merchant&lt;/a&gt;, killing Creeps is the easiest means of acquiring treasure for your Heroes. The treasure dropped is random, but the relative power of the dropped treasure is commensurate with the level of the Creep. A level one creature will drop much less potent treasure than a level nine Creep. The corpses left behind by dead Creeps are also a treasure of sorts for the Undead commander, for these can be used by &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; units and spells.\nCreeps are not only good for treasure. They give your Heroes experience as well. Every creep killed bestows a certain amount of experience points to your Heroes. Thus, in multiplayer games, killing creeps is an effective way of leveling up your Hero without confronting other players in the early portion of the game. Lower-level monsters will give less experience than a higher-leveled one. Fighting other players does give your Hero more experience, but early in the game, defeating creeps is the best way of quickly advancing your Heroes. Once a Hero is level 5 they will not receive any experience from killing Creeps.\nCreeps will only follow you a certain distance away from their \"camp.\" If you do not wish to fight a group of Creeps attacking you, run away. Eventually, they will stop chasing and return to their camp.\nSometimes you want to use a Neutral Building but don't want to clear out the Creeps. Run in with your Hero or unit, use the building, then run away. You can also use Neutral Buildings at night to avoid the Creeps guarding them, provided that none of them are awake at night. Hiring mercenaries from a camp will immediately cause the creeps guarding it to become aggressive however.\nSpells and abilities.\nSome creeps have spells and abilities they will use in combat. These are often abilities already used by &lt;a href=\"Hero%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;heroes&lt;/a&gt; and normal military units, although generally weaker. They may or may not use some spells depending on the amount of units they are in combat with."}

I'm glad you're on our side.\nNotes.\nOn accept:\nUpon interacting with the gateway, you are transported to &lt;a href=\"Shadowgore%20Citadel\"&gt;Shadowgore Citadel&lt;/a&gt; and placed in a single-player scenario.\nStage 1: The Unseen Blade.\n&lt;a href=\"Shadowgore%20Bloodmaiden\"&gt;Shadowgore Bloodmaiden&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Shadowgore%20Stalker\"&gt;Shadowgore Stalker&lt;/a&gt;s are patrolling the citadel, while &lt;a href=\"Shadowgore%20Darkcaster\"&gt;Shadowgore Darkcaster&lt;/a&gt;s are channeling spells. Two &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Xirus\"&gt;Eyes of Xirus&lt;/a&gt; are patrolling the center ring. Their ability, \"Sight Beyond Sight\", allows them to detect &lt;a href=\"stealth\"&gt;stealth&lt;/a&gt;ed characters. If they fixate their gaze upon you for long enough, they will force you out of Stealth and inevitably cause several nearby mobs to aggro to you. It is therefore best to &lt;a href=\"crowd%20control\"&gt;crowd control&lt;/a&gt; them (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Sap\"&gt;Sap&lt;/a&gt;) or avoid them altogether.\nAs you make your way towards Akaari, she speaks to her servants.\nOnce you reach Akaari, engage her in combat. On aggro, she says:\nDuring the fight, she uses an ability that creates several illusionary copies of herself that aid her in combat.\nOnce you get Akaari to around 75% health, she will stun you with &lt;a href=\"Cheap%20Shot\"&gt;Cheap Shot&lt;/a&gt;.\nStage 2: The Key.\nWhen you awaken, you have been disarmed by the and placed in a cage by the \"Chains of the Legion\" spell. The Soulkeeper is floating right next to the cage and undergoing a \"Focused Trance\", the ability description of which reads: \"This unit is unaware of his surroundings.\"\nEnter &lt;a href=\"Stealth\"&gt;Stealth&lt;/a&gt; and use &lt;a href=\"Pick%20Pocket\"&gt;Pick Pocket&lt;/a&gt; on the Soulkeeper to obtain the &lt;a href=\"Holding%20Cell%20Key\"&gt;Holding Cell Key&lt;/a&gt;.\nStage 3: Escape Artist.\nInteract with the cage to destroy it and free yourself. Interact with the &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20Cache\"&gt;Weapons Cache&lt;/a&gt; in the northeastern part of the chamber to remove the \"Chains of the Legion\" debuff and re-equip your weapons. Then, simply head over to the &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Door\"&gt;Legion Door&lt;/a&gt; and interact with it to break it open.\nStage 4: The Eyes of the Deceiver.\nAs you break open the door, the Shadowgore Darkcaster and Bloodmaiden standing the next room flee in panic just before Xirus himself appears in the center of the chamber.\nDuring fight:\nUpon killing Xirus, he says:\nStage 5: Ascension.\n&lt;a href=\"Shadowgore%20Stalker\"&gt;Shadowgore Stalker&lt;/a&gt;s, a &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Guard\"&gt;Chaos Guard&lt;/a&gt; and several &lt;a href=\"Shadowgore%20Bloodmaiden\"&gt;Shadowgore Bloodmaiden&lt;/a&gt;s patrol both of the ramps leading up to the top of the citadel. It is easiest to sneak past all of them using Stealth.\nOnce you reach the top of the citadel, a cutscene begins.\nStage 6: A Duel of Fate.\nAggro:\nDuring fight:\nDeath:\nFinal Stage: Master of Shadows.\nThe Fangs appear above the ritual circle, floating in mid-air. After interacting with and looting them, Val'zuun's voice is heard once again as the Shadowgore Citadel begins to crumble.\nHead straight west to the western platform of the citadel and used the Twisted Gateway to return to the Underbelly Descent and exit the scenario.\nWhen you arrive back on Azeroth, Val'zuun applauds your efforts.\nReturn to the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20Shadows\"&gt;Chamber of Shadows&lt;/a&gt; in the order hall to turn in the quest."}

The world's real name is unknown as the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; invaded it and left nothing behind and, according to Velen, \"its inhabitants did not speak in ways we understand\".\nDescription.\nFanlin'Deskor had four &lt;a href=\"moon\"&gt;moon&lt;/a&gt;s, an amber atmosphere, and rock formations made from the blue-tinted ground twisting in a thousand different ways. It was inhabited by a variety of strange creatures, including a group called the &lt;a href=\"Light-Bearers\"&gt;Light-Bearers&lt;/a&gt;. Upon viewing the world, Anduin couldn't tell if the rock formations were natural or carved by the alien lifeforms. The &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; was present on the world, as strong as anywhere on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt some point the Burning Legion invaded the world, ravaging the landscape with armies of &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s before a gigantic &lt;a href=\"eredar\"&gt;eredar&lt;/a&gt; arrived through a portal and drew symbols of dread power in the dust with his finger. Similar to &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt;'s destruction of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, this created an explosion of energies that ripped the world's surface apart. After the Legion pulled back, the sky was so clouded that the moons could no longer be seen, and the rock formations had been blasted to dust. Nothing living remained.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, Velen showed a vision of the planet's destruction to Anduin in order to illustrate what was at stake in the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;. Velen stated that he did not know the world's name and that \"Fanlin'Deskor\" was simply what he called it. He added that since he doubted the Legion recorded its victims, he and Anduin were likely the only ones in the universe who knew that the planet had existed at all. This was later contradicted: the &lt;a href=\"broker\"&gt;broker&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ta%27lora\"&gt;Ta'lora&lt;/a&gt; not only knows of Fanlin'Deskor and its inhabitants but also refers to it by the same name as Velen."}

He was also part of the blood elven force sent to &lt;a href=\"Kun-Lai%20Summit\"&gt;Kun-Lai Summit&lt;/a&gt; and survived the &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; ambush; later, Fanlyr joined &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Regent Lord Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; on his trip to the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20the%20Emperors\"&gt;Valley of the Emperors&lt;/a&gt; and pleaded with Garrosh not to slay a captured mogu warlord, so he could be taken in for questioning. Garrosh stayed his hand but threatened to put Fanlyr's head on a pike outside &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; should he disrespect the Warchief again. He was then seen in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Mercantile\"&gt;Imperial Mercantile&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Two%20Moons\"&gt;Shrine of Two Moons&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%27ar%20Advance\"&gt;Garrosh'ar Advance&lt;/a&gt; while Garrosh was interrogating &lt;a href=\"Shan%20Kien\"&gt;Shan Kien&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnder orders from the Warchief, Fanlyr traveled through a portal conjured by a to transport himself and Horde champions to &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;, where the Alliance had hidden the Divine Bell. After stealing the Divine Bell, Fanlyr sent it to Silvermoon and ordered his companion(s) to go through the portal while he covered their tracks. However, despite his best efforts, &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; discovered that someone was able to circumvent her wards and later went on to expel the entire Sunreaver organization from &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is unknown what happened with him afterwards.\nQuotes.\nGossip.\nThe Divine Bell means a great deal to the Horde.\nThe Warchief is counting on us.\nSpeculation.\nWhether Fanlyr was an official member of the &lt;a href=\"Sunreavers\"&gt;Sunreavers&lt;/a&gt; or not is unclear. He spends most of his time quite overtly commanding the &lt;a href=\"Reliquary\"&gt;Reliquary&lt;/a&gt; throughout the campaign, and refers to the Sunreavers as \"they\" rather than \"we\" when discussing \"their\" involvement in the Divine Bell operation. A misconception is that Fanlyr was the one who conjured the Sunreaver portal to Darnassus, though this is incorrect: a nameless &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20Mage\"&gt;Silvermoon mage&lt;/a&gt; with the Sunreaver tabard channeled the portal Fanlyr (and the player) took to breach the city's wards, while Fanlyr himself was more of a liaison for the player. However, during the heist, he provided a charm which was referred to as Silvermoon Charm and Sunreavers' Portal-Charm.\nDuring the trial of Garrosh Hellscream, &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; described the theft of the bell. He said that a Sunreaver agent, acting on orders from Garrosh, stole the artifact with several other Horde members, although he may have gotten this information from a biased Jaina. Nazgrim referred to Fanlyr as an agent in &lt;a href=\"Insertion\"&gt;Insertion&lt;/a&gt; but not as a Sunreaver agent."}

These powerful &lt;a href=\"Shaman%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Shaman&lt;/a&gt;s are counted amongst &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;'s closest advisors and are constantly in tune with the workings and maneuverings of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Far Seers are not only tied to the elements of the earth and sky, but are also adept at foretelling the future.\nHero names.\nGar'dal Grimsight, Negal Fireye, Kazil Darkeye, Magis Coldeye, &lt;a href=\"Bale%20Bleakstare\"&gt;Bale Bleakstare&lt;/a&gt;, Gorr Grimwolf, Kag'ar Winterfang, &lt;a href=\"Nazgrel\"&gt;Nazgrel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Morg%20Wolfsong\"&gt;Morg Wolfsong&lt;/a&gt;, Kazragore, Fenris'ar Gul.\nInformation.\nThe Far Seer is a very popular hero, with players debating between him and the &lt;a href=\"Blademaster%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Blademaster&lt;/a&gt; as their starting Hero.\nThough the Far Seer is quite frail, he has good early game capability like the Blademaster. Both can solo the first few creeps alone, and can also be sent to disrupt an enemy player with promising results in the hands of a skilled player. He also has good killing capability through Chain Lightning when focusing on enemy Heroes. \nFar Sight is a late-game skill, and should be invested last. It is essentially a free Reveal for Orcs, as the level 3 version reveals an especially large amount of the map and only costs mana rather than gold. This can help in those long matches where the enemy may be hiding buildings to prevent defeat, and saves the gold that would be used on Reveal for more units or buildings. \nEarthquake is a fairly mixed skill; if the enemy has not built a lot of defensive towers, then you may want to skip this skill until level 7, as it does less damage to most buildings compared to the Lich's Death and Decay spell. Earthquake has a small AoE, though it is most effective against Human players due to the small size of their defensive towers and their likely to be clumped. Earthquake does not lower the attack speed of units caught in the quake; only their movement speed.\nSpells and abilities.\nhain Lightning.\nChain Lightning is a very powerful spell. Far Seers should research it and use it whenever possible. Use Chain Lightning especially against ranged units and spellcasters.\nChain Lightning will now jump to sleeping targets if the primary target is also asleep.\nar Sight.\nAn animation is displayed over the revealed area. This can let the enemy know you have used Far Sight; keep that in mind. It is much cheaper than Reveal, especially at level 3 where it covers a large amount of the map. If you need better map coverage than the Sentry Ward is a better choice.\nFeral Spiri.\nNotes: Casting Feral Spirit will remove previously summoned wolves.\nUse Feral Spirits at the start of the game to help you attack the Creeps.\nSend two Feral Spirits in separate directions and use them to scout enemy towns for their location and race. As the Spirit Wolf enters the town attack their buildings or workers. If the enemy isn't smart they may even teleport back to their town to defend it.\nIf cast again while the wolves are on the field, they are removed and the new ones take the place. Only use them when your current wolves are dead.\narthquake (Ultimate).\nUse Earthquakes on large groups of towers, typically created at the end of the game.\nEarthquakes can be used to clear away large sections of trees.\nEarthquake brings units to a minimum speed of 140. Earthquake does not slow air units. Earthquake's slow area is 25 (250 in-game).\nThis spell must be \"maintained\" to get the full effect. This functionality is applied to mainly mass damage area of effect spells. For example, if you cast an Earthquake spell on an enemy town, your Far Seer must stay casting the spell until the Earthquake is finished. If you give him a new order during the spell, the Far Seer will stop casting the Earthquake.\nOne of the best ways to counter Earthquake is to construct buildings with lots of space between them. Then the enemy will only be able to hit a few buildings at once. Don't build farms in big blocks if you can help it."}

In the main timeline, this was the area that was transformed into the &lt;a href=\"Netherstorm\"&gt;Netherstorm&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href=\"Garrison\"&gt;Garrison&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Garrison%20Missions\"&gt;mission&lt;/a&gt; involves sending followers in order to find Farahlon and understand where Netherstorm came from. The champions sailed northeast and returned with a &lt;a href=\"Mysterious%20Shining%20Lockbox\"&gt;Mysterious Shining Lockbox&lt;/a&gt; containing &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Vargoth%27s%20Spare%20Staff\"&gt;Archmage Vargoth's Spare Staff&lt;/a&gt;. \nIt was initially planned to be added as a &lt;a href=\"zone\"&gt;zone&lt;/a&gt; in \"\" but was ultimately scrapped.\nDevelopment.\nFarahlon was initially announced as a &lt;a href=\"zone\"&gt;zone&lt;/a&gt; in the ' expansion and appeared in the first maps revealed at &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon%202013\"&gt;BlizzCon 2013&lt;/a&gt;. The initial plan was to add the island in a later patch, similarly to the implementation of the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Isle of Thunder&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Giants\"&gt;Isle of Giants&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Timeless%20Isle\"&gt;Timeless Isle&lt;/a&gt; during '. Farahlon was later removed from the world map of the &lt;a href=\"Public%20Test%20Realms\"&gt;Public Test Realms&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring a Q&amp;A session at &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon%202014\"&gt;BlizzCon 2014&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ian%20Bates\"&gt;Ian Bates&lt;/a&gt; asked about Farahlon and whether or not players would venture there. Then-Lead Game Designer &lt;a href=\"Ion%20Hazzikostas\"&gt;Ion Hazzikostas&lt;/a&gt; explained that originally, Farahlon was meant to be used as a separate area for &lt;a href=\"Character%20Boost\"&gt;boosted&lt;/a&gt; players to start in, distinct from &lt;a href=\"Tanaan%20Jungle\"&gt;Tanaan Jungle&lt;/a&gt;, but as Tanaan became more and more fleshed out during development, the developers felt that Tanaan truly represented what the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt; was going to be about, with everyone jumping in together alongside heroes of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;. Everything was thus rolled into Tanaan Jungle, leaving Farahlon a bit up in the air.\nDuring the PTR for &lt;a href=\"patch%206.2.0\"&gt;patch 6.2.0&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; offered a legendary quest by the name &lt;a href=\"To%20Farahlon%21\"&gt;To Farahlon!&lt;/a&gt;, which required players to complete the \"Finding Farahlon\" Naval Mission and retrieve a &lt;a href=\"Pearl%20of%20Farahlon\"&gt;Pearl of Farahlon&lt;/a&gt;. The quest described the island as filled with beautiful fields and forests dotted with natural crystalline formations and roiling magical pools that made it the &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;al nexus of Draenor, but that it was nearly impossible to reach due to the frequent and unpredictable magical storms in the surrounding &lt;a href=\"Barrier%20Sea\"&gt;seas&lt;/a&gt;. However, the quest and accompanying mission did not make it to the live version of patch 6.2.\nIn July of 2014, &lt;a href=\"Cory%20Stockton\"&gt;Cory Stockton&lt;/a&gt; finally stated in an interview that Farahlon would not make an appearance in \"Warlords of Draenor\" as &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard&lt;/a&gt; felt that it didn't fit the storyline of the expansion. Stockton stated that they may return to it in the future, using the example of &lt;a href=\"Tol%20Barad\"&gt;Tol Barad&lt;/a&gt;, which was initially planned to appear in ' but didn't make it into the game until '.\nBefore they were replaced by the &lt;a href=\"infested\"&gt;infested&lt;/a&gt;, the scrapped &lt;a href=\"Primals\"&gt;plant creatures&lt;/a&gt; known as &lt;a href=\"fara\"&gt;fara&lt;/a&gt; were planned to be native to Farahlon.\nWhile the area was never fully fleshed out, the following subzones were at least partially developed: &lt;a href=\"Brawnbelly%20Barracks\"&gt;Brawnbelly Barracks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Digger%20Flats\"&gt;Digger Flats&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pits\"&gt;The Pits&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blightstone%20Quarry\"&gt;Blightstone Quarry&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Tower\"&gt;The Iron Tower&lt;/a&gt;."}

Its lower section is called Lower Mines.\nIt is a great place to work on &lt;a href=\"profession\"&gt;profession&lt;/a&gt;s and collect some much sought after raw materials. Players will probably be around level five or six when first entering the mine, but after completing all the associated &lt;a href=\"quest\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt;s, they should be around level nine. It usually takes one to one and a half hours to complete all of them. A handy tip is to make certain to carry as many &lt;a href=\"bag\"&gt;bag&lt;/a&gt;s as possible because they will fill quickly with loot. Not only will players be tasked with exploring the mine, but they will also gather large candles and gold dust from the kobolds (see quest list below).\nIn addition to the mine quests, the &lt;a href=\"Stonefield%20Necklace%20quest%20chain\"&gt;\"Lost Necklace\"&lt;/a&gt; quest chain should be worked on at the same time, as it covers the same area. This is begun by talking with &lt;a href=\"%22Auntie%22%20Bernice%20Stonefield\"&gt;\"Auntie\" Bernice Stonefield&lt;/a&gt; located at the &lt;a href=\"Stonefield%20Farm\"&gt;Stonefield Farm&lt;/a&gt;.The chain will culminate in a fight with &lt;a href=\"Goldtooth\"&gt;Goldtooth&lt;/a&gt;, a rather large kobold &lt;a href=\"Goldtooth%27s%20Den\"&gt;located right above&lt;/a&gt; the Fargodeep Mine.\nWhile running through the mine, players should watch for the kobold, &lt;a href=\"Narg%20the%20Taskmaster\"&gt;Narg the Taskmaster&lt;/a&gt;. He is a level 10 &lt;a href=\"rare\"&gt;rare&lt;/a&gt; mob who may spawn in the back of the mine.\nIn the RPG.\nGold mines once held by the orcs to fuel their war efforts, the Jasperlode and Fargo mines were retaken by the Alliance after the First War. It is spelled as Fargo Deep Mine."}

Producing various grains and foodstuffs, farms not only generated sustenance for &lt;a href=\"Peasant%20%28Warcraft%20II%29\"&gt;peasants&lt;/a&gt; and workers, but for the armies as well. The overall amount of food produced from a town's farms was vital to the number of new workers or soldiers that the community could accommodate. The &lt;a href=\"Horse\"&gt;stallions&lt;/a&gt; carrying &lt;a href=\"Knight%20%28Warcraft%20II%29\"&gt;knights&lt;/a&gt; into battle were also known to contribute precious fertilizer for the bountiful farms about Lordaeron.\nBeginning in \"\", orcish farms became known as &lt;a href=\"pig%20farm\"&gt;pig farm&lt;/a&gt;s to distinguish them from their human counterpart.\nThird War.\nHuman farm.\nVital to any human Village, the Farm provides sustenance for troops and citizens. The uncanny ability of these skilled farmers to harvest almost any landscape under the harshest conditions is highly regarded in the lands of Lordaeron. The number of troops sustainable at any village is dependent upon the amount of land harvested by the small farms.\nA common tactic, when playing humans, to prevent the enemy from easily destroying defensive towers was to place farms in front of them so that any enemy melee units would have to first destroy the farms to get to the tower. This is humorously referenced by &lt;a href=\"Topper%20McNabb\"&gt;Topper McNabb&lt;/a&gt;.\nHigh elven and blood elven farm.\nMany &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elven&lt;/a&gt; farms dotted &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; when &lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; tried to attack their capital city of &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt; in '. They produced a high quantity of food and had a unique design not seen anywhere since, not even in &lt;a href=\"Eversong%20Forest\"&gt;Eversong Forest&lt;/a&gt;. These farms couldn't be built by the &lt;a href=\"Peasant%20%28high%20elf%29\"&gt;High elf worker&lt;/a&gt; unit likely due to the limited ability of the map editor prior to the ' expansion. With the addition of The Frozen Throne expansion's map editor, it is possible to make additional groups with building orders.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; could also build farms during &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20the%20Blood%20Elves\"&gt;Curse of the Blood Elves&lt;/a&gt; campaign in The Frozen Throne but these had the same design and food quantity as the human ones.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nFarms are one of the most numerous buildings in the game, considering their design is often the base for the simple houses of each race. As such, &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; farms of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; are of the same design as normal human and Forsaken houses. Besides houses, farms can also be pumpkin patches, orchards, vineyards, plantations, &lt;a href=\"ranch\"&gt;ranch&lt;/a&gt;es, &lt;a href=\"stables\"&gt;stables&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"pig%20farm\"&gt;pig farm&lt;/a&gt;s, depending on what they produce.\nPlayers can get their own farm in &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, called &lt;a href=\"Sunsong%20Ranch\"&gt;Sunsong Ranch&lt;/a&gt;."}

Yoon refused, stating that he can't just sell his family's farm. After much hard work, with the aid of an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;, Yoon finally gains the respect of Haohan and the other members of the Tillers council and is allowed to join the Tillers, with the adventurer alongside him as his business partner.\nSoon after joining the Tiller's Union, &lt;a href=\"Nana%20Mudclaw\"&gt;Nana Mudclaw&lt;/a&gt;, the eldest member of the council and childhood friend of Old Yoon, decides to retire from her duties and chooses Farmer Yoon as her successor. Although he would have a good deal to learn, she considers him to have a good head on his shoulders and most importantly, a generous heart. Yoon decides to accept the responsibility but doesn't believe that he will be able to work his farm and be on the council at the same time. Rather than sell the family property to some stranger, he gifts it to his business partner, entrusting them to take care of it as he himself would.\nYoon can be seen at the &lt;a href=\"Celestial%20Court\"&gt;Celestial Court&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Timeless%20Isle\"&gt;Timeless Isle&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Untamed Valley.\nDuring the events of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Untamed%20Valley\"&gt;The Untamed Valley&lt;/a&gt;\", Farmer Yoon was not present, as he was planning a food-delivery contract with dwarven masons within the &lt;a href=\"Jade%20Forest\"&gt;Jade Forest&lt;/a&gt; on behalf of the Tillers' Union.\nQuests.\nYoon is involved in most of the &lt;a href=\"Tillers\"&gt;Tillers&lt;/a&gt;' quests; see the &lt;a href=\"Tillers%23Quests\"&gt;Tillers quest section&lt;/a&gt; for more information.\nQuotes.\nI've never fought much, but this is exciting!"}

Having discovered the location of the legendary &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, which was the reason for him to create the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; in the first place, Gul'dan assembled the forces loyal to him, both the &lt;a href=\"Stormreaver%20clan\"&gt;Stormreaver clan&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer clan&lt;/a&gt; which was led by his apprentice &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt;, and led them towards the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt;. Gul'dan cared little for the result of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; and sought only to find the tomb and take the power of &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; for himself.\nGul'dan and his followers betrayed the Horde during the battle at &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt;, and with this massive loss of forces Doomhammer was forced to withdraw his troops from the capital to deal with the traitors, and he sent a large contingent of Blackrock troops alongside with &lt;a href=\"Rend%20Blackhand\"&gt;Rend&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maim%20Blackhand\"&gt;Maim&lt;/a&gt; and their &lt;a href=\"Black%20Tooth%20Grin%20clan\"&gt;Black Tooth Grin clan&lt;/a&gt; to slaughter Gul'dan and every one of his followers.\nAfter arriving to the submerged Tomb of Sargeras; Gul'dan, Cho'gall, some &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Ogre%20mage\"&gt;ogre magi&lt;/a&gt; started raising the Tomb from the floor of the ocean. Meanwhile, &lt;a href=\"Torgus\"&gt;Torgus&lt;/a&gt; had already reported to Orgrim about Gul'dan treachery and Rend was going directly to battle Gul'dan. After hours of conjures Gul'dan and his followers succeeded in raising the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;, however after a few moments Rend Blackhand and his Black Tooth Grin warriors saw them and prepared for the battle.\nCho'gall detected the ships of Doomhammer's troops before they arrived to the isles. The ogre mage and most of the troops of both clans stood there to fight, they promised to Gul'dan to make everything possible to stop the Horde, meanwhile Gul'dan with some &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;s and warlocks went inside the Tomb of Sargeras.\nThe Battle.\nStrategy guide account.\nFirst Utok's unit had to establish a city on the largest of the islands to the east and north. For this purpose, they sent their warships with a flier to clear the way. Two enemy ships and a submersible had to be sunk first, then a tower; finally, the inland catapult was drawn to shore with a fast &lt;a href=\"Destroyer%23Troll%20destroyer\"&gt;destroyer&lt;/a&gt; and disassembled. While the warships waited, the &lt;a href=\"transport%20ship\"&gt;transport ship&lt;/a&gt;s were loaded with all but sappers and &lt;a href=\"peon\"&gt;peon&lt;/a&gt;s to make a landing; soon the island was theirs. While the existing structures were removed, the transports went back for the rest of the units and brought them safely to shore. From that point it was a matter of building a city from scratch, starting with a &lt;a href=\"great%20hall\"&gt;great hall&lt;/a&gt; as close to the &lt;a href=\"gold%20mine\"&gt;gold mine&lt;/a&gt; as possible without being too close to shore. With the threat of enemy &lt;a href=\"juggernaught\"&gt;juggernaught&lt;/a&gt;s coming soon, all units were moved as far inland as possible and the ships were sent to anchor at the southern tip of the island.\nAs soon as a &lt;a href=\"barracks\"&gt;barracks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lumber%20mill%23Troll%20lumber%20mill\"&gt;lumber mill&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"Blacksmith%20%28building%29\"&gt;blacksmith&lt;/a&gt; had been built, they concentrated on producing catapults. These they used to sink any enemy ships foolish enough to wander too close to the shore by directing all of them to attack at once, then moving them safely back inland. &lt;a href=\"Cannon%20tower\"&gt;Cannon tower&lt;/a&gt;s helped somewhat, but their lack of mobility got them destroyed almost as fast as they could be built. Once they had a fair-sized group of catapults to fend off ships, construction of the &lt;a href=\"shipyard\"&gt;shipyard&lt;/a&gt; and accompanying structures began on the southeast side of the island as far from enemy eyes as possible. To carry out their plan of invasion, they would need only two juggernaughts and three transports to make a landing on the main island. They loaded them with five trolls to give them a chance against flying daemons, a single worker, six ogres, and six catapults.\nThe flotilla was escorted by a zeppelin to spot enemy submersibles. It sailed west to the edge of the area before turning north and quietly passing the main island. Then it headed east to find a good landing spot south of a small barren island. The juggernaughts were sent in first to clear the shore of a tower and catapult before the troops were unloaded behind a small stand of trees. They were careful to unload the ogres first, with catapults behind, and trolls on the other side, since the enemies would come to them once the catapults started on the enemy barracks nearby. When things quieted down a bit, Utok's forces erected their own barracks and began pouring troops and catapults through it to slowly take over the island. Utok's unit blew a hole through some rocks with sappers and claimed both of the heads of an orc and ogre mage (believed to be &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt; but really being decoys) as a clear signal to all who would oppose the Horde.\nNovel account.\nDuring the battle both sides suffered heavy casualties but the difference were the numbers, the Stormreaver clan was the smallest of all and the Black Tooth Grin clan was one of the largest clans within the Horde, Gul'dan forces were outnumbered and they knew it, however they were fanatically loyal and refused to surrender, they fought until the last orc, they took many of Doomhammer's warriors with them. \nHowever, the truth is that Cho'Gall faked his own death, cutting one of the arms of the strongest Black Tooth Grin warriors as he fell, while Gul'dan went inside the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;. Finally the beach was full of corpses with only Doomhammer's forces standing, meanwhile Gul'dan continued his journey inside the Tomb. He brought some shamans, necromancers, warlocks and ogre magi with him, he frightened his warriors by killing &lt;a href=\"Urluk%20Cloud-killer\"&gt;Urluk Cloud-killer&lt;/a&gt; and they started to search for the powers of Sargeras. They found a hidden vault, protected against all &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azerothian&lt;/a&gt; races by &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt;, but Gul'dan was an orc of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; and he could open it. He looked for the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Eye of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; but only found crazed &lt;a href=\"daemon\"&gt;daemon&lt;/a&gt;s that ambushed him. His warriors abandoned him when they saw the daemons, still he continued, he evaded the guardians but then he heard a laughter, &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; was mocking Gul'dan. Gul'dan started dying because of injuries caused by the daemons, he wrote his story in runes with his own blood.\nRend Blackhand commanded the troops to make an attack against Gul'dan but when they found the tomb, the &lt;a href=\"daemon\"&gt;daemon&lt;/a&gt;s attacked them, many were paralysed by those horrible beast but others fought back.\nVideo.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

You begin with a limited number of units, and must keep your sole death knight alive.

Balthule was late checking in, and Elissa was concerned that he may have run afoul of something.\nBalthule found something, alright, and it didn't look good. It seemed that a cult of warlocks had moved into the tower. He didn't know anything about them, really, but ... warlocks... cult... couldn't be good. He had some scraps of parchment fall into his hands, but needed more in order to assess the threat they posed. And he asked you to secure them for him.\nYou relieved some of the fanatics of their parchments and returned to Balthule, who was able to put together something more about them. Specifically, they were part of the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Dark%20Strand\"&gt;Cult of the Dark Strand&lt;/a&gt;. ... About which Balthule had no real information. However, he knew someone who might: .\nIt turned out that Balthule was actually an agent of Delgren, a &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt; who was assisting the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; in destroying demonic and undead forces. (Elissa was just 'borrowing' him...)\nBalthule asked you to carry a letter to Delgren, outlining the situation at the tower. You found that it was a long, long run, from the &lt;a href=\"Tower%20of%20Althalaxx\"&gt;Tower of Althalaxx&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Maestra%27s%20Post\"&gt;Maestra's Post&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale%20Forest\"&gt;Ashenvale Forest&lt;/a&gt;.\nDelgren took the threat of the Dark Strand cultists seriously, as he had already been battling them near &lt;a href=\"Ordil%27Aran\"&gt;Ordil'Aran&lt;/a&gt;. It seemed that somewhere among the cultists was a that he believed held the secret to the cult's power. You volunteered to go retrieve it for him.\nYou killed a \"lot\" of cultists in the process of finding the gem, but found it you ded. Soul gems, as it sounded like, contained a trapped soul. Delgren shattered the gem, freeing the ghost of , who explained the situation to Delgren.\nThe freed spirit gave you the name \"\". Delgren knew this name. He was a warlock in southwestern Ashenvale, at &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Scar%20Shrine\"&gt;Fire Scar Shrine&lt;/a&gt;. He was up to his little eyeballs in this Dark Strand cult. He had to go. And you were just the person to do it.\nDespite his succubus, despite his voidwalkers, all his necromantic powers availed him naught. You returned to Delgren victorious, with in hand.\nDelgren read through the tome and related the results. It seemed that still had two soul gems, one in &lt;a href=\"Night%20Run\"&gt;Night Run&lt;/a&gt;, and one in &lt;a href=\"Satyrnaar\"&gt;Satyrnaar&lt;/a&gt;, both under the control of Satyrs. Two more souls to free.\nThose things one valued, one protected. The Satyrs defended the soul gems quite stoutly, but you were still able to free the souls and thus weaken the chief of the Dark Strand cultists, and do other Good in the process.\nUpon returning to Delgren, he declared that it was time to confront Athrikus himself. But first, he said, you should talk to and see if there had been any developments.\nYou did, and you found that yes, your work had been ... noticed. Out of the blue, as it were, there was a blinding flash from the top of the tower, followed by a lot of lightning and screams.\nGood work, that.\nYou related what you'd been up to since you last talked to him, and Balthule agreed that will never be weaker. He cautioned you, though, that there were many warlocks surrounding him, more powerful than those you'd faced before.\nAnd he was right. You fought (or perhaps snuck) your way to the top of the tower and found a veritable cloud of warlocks guarding Athrikus. The fighting was savage, but you prevailed!

Use a stun and/or slowing ability to increase the length of opportunity.\nStage 3: Challenge and Defeat Your Third Opponent.\nAsrea Moonblade will frequently leap to attack you from behind, so be quick to turn around to minimize critical hits taken.

It is the story of a young human warlock, Synapse.\nWith over 3 million views and 200 pages, the English thread is one of the longest and most-read threads throughout the WoW forums.\nThe Tribulations of a Megalomaniac Warlock.\nThe first chapter of this epic tale was posted on June 14th 2006 in the warlock section of the FR wow forums. Though already over 50 chapters and 280,000 words long, the story is still nowhere near over, and new chapters are added on a regular basis (about one chapter every 2 to 3 weeks).\nAround late June 2007, over a year after the story had begun in its original French version, the first chapters of the translated version were published in the warlock section of the English wow forums.\nAs of september 2009, &lt;a href=\"http%3A//forums.wow-europe.com/thread.html%3FtopicId%3D13071357%26amp%3Bsid%3D2%26amp%3BpageNo%3D1\"&gt;the French thread&lt;/a&gt; has close to 500,000 views 3,000 replies, and &lt;a href=\"http%3A//forums.wow-europe.com/thread.html%3FtopicId%3D299001827%26amp%3Bsid%3D1\"&gt;the English thread&lt;/a&gt;, thanks to a much broader public, is over 3,000,000 views and close to 4,000 replies long, making it one of the longest, oldest and most viewed threads of the entire WoW forum boards. The story is also published on &lt;a href=\"http%3A//wowmb.net/forums/f100/17321-tribulations_megalomaniac_warlock/\"&gt;the Warlock's Den&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"About the story itself\"\nThe tale starts by Synapse's description of how she came to Azeroth, i.e. a description of the Stormwind starting area. Quickly enough, convinced she is indeed a Goddess, she takes off on ever greater adventures, going from the Dead Mines to Black Temple.\nThe story is divided into three major parts:\nIt is also interesting to note that most of the people Synapse meets, and who eventually team up with her, have a detailed and rich background story, each one being told sooner or later.\nWho is Synapse?\nSynapse, or The Great Goddess as she is often refered to by her readers, is a human warlock on EU server Kael'thas and the writer of the amazingly popular fan fiction &lt;a href=\"http%3A//forums.wow-europe.com/thread.html%3FtopicId%3D13071357%26amp%3Bsid%3D2%26amp%3BpageNo%3D1\"&gt;Tribulations d'une d\u00e9moniste m\u00e9galo&lt;/a&gt;, or as it is called in English, &lt;a href=\"http%3A//forums.wow-europe.com/thread.html%3FtopicId%3D299001827%26amp%3Bsid%3D1\"&gt;The Tribulations of a Megalomaniac Warlock.&lt;/a&gt;\nCompanions.\nSynapse is rarely alone in her adventures, and her followers form a rather eclectic group.\nDemons.\nUnlike other warlocks, who only control one demon at a time, Synapse is followed by a whole array of very unusual demons, only one of which she actually summoned: her imp, Bizrot.\nOthers.\nSynapse's many other companions include part-demons, elves, humans, and even gnomes... Here are a couple of the more important ones.\nThe Followers of Synapse.\nThe Tribulations of a Megalomaniac Warlock are read by many, among whom some put a lot of effort into keeping the story on the first page of the WoW forums by \"UGTGGSing\" (Upholding the Glorious Tale of the Great Goddess, Synapse).\nAlso among her followers, but behind the stages, are:"}

It presented information about the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;Plague of Undeath&lt;/a&gt;. The original article, formerly located at &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/story/undeadplague.html\"&gt;http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/story/undeadplague.html&lt;/a&gt;, did not survive the overhaul of the World of Warcraft Official Website. \nThe devastating undead &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;plague&lt;/a&gt; began in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;. There, from the depths of the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; afflicted a remote human village through his will alone: a morbid test meant to gauge the plague's effectiveness. The infected villagers died, and when their zombified corpses rose soon after, they had become lumbering, mindless servants of Ner'zhul.\nThe experiment was successful, but the Lich King was interested in nothing less than perfection. He contaminated every human inhabitant of Northrend, binding them to his icy will even as he continued to fine-tune his infernal disease. \nThrough the course of his experimentations, Ner'zhul insured that the affliction would specifically target humans for \"undeath\". Though non-human races and creatures (and even the land itself) were susceptible to the plague, it was humanity in particular that Ner'zhul meant to scour from the world. As a result, infected flora and fauna reacted differently--diseased and decaying, but not truly undead, and not under the thrall of the Lich King.\nHence, while undead representatives certainly do exist among the ranks of the non-human races, these particular agents are examples of undead created through &lt;a href=\"necromancy\"&gt;necromancy&lt;/a&gt; rather than the plague.\nOnce Ner'zhul's adjustments were complete, his mind reached out to &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, to the disgruntled human, &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;. The archmage answered the call, trekking through the arctic wastes of Northrend to eventually climb the steps of the Frozen Throne*. There he pledged to act as the Lich King's lieutenant in exchange for immortality and untold power. He was then given cauldrons of concentrated plague to spread throughout the lands of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; via his acolytes in the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Cult of the Damned&lt;/a&gt;, and soon dead villagers throughout the realm began to rise and walk again, marching against the living in obedient servitude to their new master.\nAnd thus, the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; was born into an unsuspecting world.\n\"*Also, read the &lt;a href=\"Road%20to%20Damnation\"&gt;Road to Damnation&lt;/a&gt; short story.\""}

His cousin &lt;a href=\"Stephon%20Marris\"&gt;Stephon&lt;/a&gt; lived here for a time, and &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; occasionally visited Nathanos.\nAfter the fall of &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; swept over the once-great nation of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, killing all in its path and raising the fallen as cadaverous &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;. Despite his great skill, Nathanos Marris fell as well at his own house, murdered by the &lt;a href=\"abomination\"&gt;abomination&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ramstein%20the%20Gorger\"&gt;Ramstein the Gorger&lt;/a&gt;. Nathanos rose as a mindless thrall of the Scourge, bound to the will of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nAfter Sylvanas freed him and he had become a &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;, Nathanos, accompanied by his &lt;a href=\"blighthound\"&gt;blighthound&lt;/a&gt;s, returned to his old home by order of the Banshee Queen. Here he recruited &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; soldiers to fight against the threats that infested the &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands\"&gt;Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;, such as the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt;. Nathanos also collected relics from the battle of &lt;a href=\"Darrowshire\"&gt;Darrowshire&lt;/a&gt; for unknown reasons, and kept them in his home.\nNathanos' whereabouts did not go unnoticed. &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; of the received some disturbing reports of unusual Forsaken activity in the Eastern Plaguelands, and sent five agents to investigate. Only one of those agents returned, babbling incoherently about \"Nathanos\" and the word \"Blightcaller.\" &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; adventurers were asked to go investigate their disappearance. The only thing the SI:7 had to go on was that Nathanos Marris may have been slain by this \"Blightcaller,\" but the truth was far less pleasant. After investigating the grounds around the Marris Stead, the adventurers uncovered what was happening, realizing Nathanos was the Blightcaller himself, now a champion of the Banshee Queen. Once it was determined that Nathanos was the Blightcaller, &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; enlisted Alliance adventurers to gather a strike force and destroy him. Nathanos, however, managed to survive this through faking death.\nBy the time of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the Blightcaller had already been driven out of his home and had retreated to the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;.\nShadowlands.\nThe Marris Stead was empty and vacant for several years until Nathanos eventually returned following his and Sylvanas' betrayal of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and the unsuccessful attempt on &lt;a href=\"Bwonsamdi\"&gt;Bwonsamdi&lt;/a&gt;'s life. The &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; found him sitting on his front porch, not even trying to hide. He was attacked by Alliance and Horde champions alike, with &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; suddenly appearing and dealing the final blow."}

At the start of the battle for Alterac Valley, Vanndar is protected by four Marshals, one for each of the Stormpike Bunkers; each is named for his Bunker, rather than given a personal name.\nTied to their general, Marshals cannot be pulled separately from Vanndar. The only way to deprive the Stormpike General of his protectors is to destroy the Bunkers before assaulting Dun Baldar. As each Bunker is destroyed, the associated Marshal is removed from the Valley.\nEach Bunker must be protected carefully if the Expedition wishes to keep their Marshals, as there is no longer a way to gain more. Furthermore, each Marshal - and thus each Tower - represents 75 &lt;a href=\"Reinforcements\"&gt;Reinforcements&lt;/a&gt;, a full 12.5% of the initial Stormpike army. Losing all four Marshals and Bunkers means losing half of the Expedition's Reinforcements. Still, losing Bunkers may be considered acceptable losses if other objectives are archived in the meantime.\nEach Marshal is an elite of the level cap for the Valley - level 60 for 51~60 AV, level 70 for 61~70 AV. Level 60 Marshals have 61,000 health; and their level 70 counterparts have 140,000 health. Level 80 marshals have 327,500 health with no 25% more health buffs. Each generally requires his own tank and healer, so it is often advisable to destroy as many Bunkers as possible before beginning the encounter.\nPatch 2.3 changes.\nPrior to &lt;a href=\"Patch%202.3.0\"&gt;2.3&lt;/a&gt;, Marshals and their counterparts, the Frostwolf &lt;a href=\"Warmaster\"&gt;Warmaster&lt;/a&gt;s, could be pulled separately from their Generals. Additionally, the destruction of a Horde Tower would not only despawn a Warmaster but also spawn an extra Marshal - and vice versa. Now, each side will only ever have the four guards they start the battle with.\nPatch 2.4 changes.\nVanndar Stormpike's and Balinda's health have been reduced to match the total of Galvangar and Drek'Thar. Warmasters/marshals now buff each other for 25% more health and damage. This is a stackable effect and is stacked separately. So at 1 marshal, the general has 25% more health and damage, 2 marshals 56%, 3 marshals 95%, 4 marshals 144%. This is compared to the generals' base damage and health."}

However, their endeavor was not fully prepared for everything, having underestimated the savagery of Un'Goro, and ended sooner than they wished. They sought higher ground from the savage beasts of the crater once their base camps were overrun, making their escape at Marshal's Refuge.\nAt some point, the camp was visited by the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dhambeela\"&gt;Dhambeela&lt;/a&gt; and later by the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kova%20Broadhorn\"&gt;Kova Broadhorn&lt;/a&gt; and her &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt; companion &lt;a href=\"Miles%20Corebender\"&gt;Miles Corebender&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\n&lt;a href=\"Stone%20Guardian\"&gt;Stone Guardian&lt;/a&gt;s, in great numbers, invaded Marshal's Refuge and established themselves in the cave located there, killing the &lt;a href=\"kodo\"&gt;kodo&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dadanga\"&gt;Dadanga&lt;/a&gt; in the process. The expedition had to abandon the camp after the new threat came their way, forcing the expedition to move southeast and form &lt;a href=\"Marshal%27s%20Stand\"&gt;Marshal's Stand&lt;/a&gt;. Dadanga was buried in here, outside the cavern, in a grave marked as &lt;a href=\"Dadanga%27s%20Grave\"&gt;Dadanga's Grave&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Stone Guardians seem to be investigating the refuge and the &lt;a href=\"power%20crystal\"&gt;power crystal&lt;/a&gt;-filled cavern found at the back of the area. Interfering with this will cause the guardians to attack.\nIn the RPG.\nThe closest thing to a town in &lt;a href=\"Un%27Goro%20Crater\"&gt;Un'Goro Crater&lt;/a&gt; is Marshal's Refuge, the cavern in the north where Williden's people stay during their tenure in the crater. a semi-permanent home in Un'Goro. All they have are ramshackle storage sheds and a communal tent to shunt the rain away. Here these stalwart explorers live a primitive existence as they study the crater. Although among them they have the means to improve their settlement, none of them has bothered to spend the time doing so. They are too busy with their research. If you visit the place, better bring your own supplies \u2014 they only have enough to support themselves."}

After helping to lead the campaign against the &lt;a href=\"Heartsbane%20Coven\"&gt;Heartsbane Coven&lt;/a&gt;, Reade was bewitched by the Coven's leader, &lt;a href=\"Meredith%20Waycrest\"&gt;Meredith Waycrest&lt;/a&gt;, forcing his allies to slay him. After the victory over the Heartsbane, he was succeeded as Marshal by &lt;a href=\"Inquisitor%20Joan%20Cleardawn\"&gt;Inquisitor Joan Cleardawn&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nEverit was a good friend of &lt;a href=\"Lucille%20Waycrest\"&gt;Lucille Waycrest&lt;/a&gt;, as evidenced by his calling her Lucy.\nDuring the Drust incursion, Everit was doing his best to keep the situation under control. When he learned that Lucille was in peril, about to be hanged for the crime of witchcraft, he journeyed to &lt;a href=\"Hangman%27s%20Point\"&gt;Hangman's Point&lt;/a&gt; and interrupted the trial. He demanded the freedom of Lucille under threat of violence, planning to bring her back to &lt;a href=\"Highroad%20Gate\"&gt;Highroad Gate&lt;/a&gt; for her safety. However, Lucille ordered him to stand down, preferring to prove her innocence over fighting. Everit reluctantly agreed, and instructed the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;emissary&lt;/a&gt; present to kill cursed animals and place traps near the main road to buy them time and protect them from potential witch attacks.\nAs the adventurer returned with a letter to clear Lucille's name, &lt;a href=\"Sister%20Widdowson\"&gt;Sister Widdowson&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Heartsbane%20Coven\"&gt;Heartsbane Coven&lt;/a&gt; led an ambush on the humans and tried to capture Lucille. After she was brought down, the Marshal explained what was going on to the freed Lucille and told her that her father had been captured, and the Coven was gaining ground across the region. Lucille decided to take action and left with the Alliance emissary, while Everit returned to &lt;a href=\"Arom%27s%20Stand\"&gt;Arom's Stand&lt;/a&gt; and awaited her return.\nLucille later returned with an ancient tome containing magical knowledge in hand. She informed the Marshal that she believed the Coven's magic had something to do with the &lt;a href=\"Drust\"&gt;Drust&lt;/a&gt;. Though Everit harbored doubts, he agreed to help. The first order of business was to recruit men for the reformation of the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20Embers\"&gt;Order of Embers&lt;/a&gt;. From his own troops, he selected &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Joan%20Cleardawn\"&gt;Captain Joan Cleardawn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ensign%20Mace\"&gt;Ensign Mace&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ensign%20Yorrick\"&gt;Ensign Yorrick&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Falconer%20Notley\"&gt;Falconer Notley&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20Sterntide\"&gt;Lieutenant Sterntide&lt;/a&gt;. With everything in place, Everit stood alongside Lucille as she reignited the legendary Order.\nIntending to go on the offensive, Everit and the newly dubbed Inquisitors launched an attack on &lt;a href=\"Watchman%27s%20Rise\"&gt;Watchman's Rise&lt;/a&gt;. He killed his former men and ended the life of the witch controlling them. With the tower taken, he tasking their Alliance &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;ally&lt;/a&gt; with scouting ahead and assisting an injured Notley in using &lt;a href=\"Winston\"&gt;Winston&lt;/a&gt; for scouting. From this, they learned that the &lt;a href=\"blacksmith\"&gt;blacksmith&lt;/a&gt; of Corlain was still alive and sent Yorrick to free him. After he was rescued, &lt;a href=\"Angus%20Ballaster\"&gt;Angus Ballaster&lt;/a&gt; went to the basement of Watchman's Rise to begin crafting silver weapons. The Marshal had also ordered the death of &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Goodspeed\"&gt;Captain Goodspeed&lt;/a&gt; for deliberately betraying House Waycrest and joining the witches.\nTogether, the Inquisitors, Lucille and Everit took down the Barrier blocking &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Corlain\"&gt;Upper Corlain&lt;/a&gt; and charged in. After culling the witches in the area, the group advanced as one to &lt;a href=\"Waycrest%20Manor\"&gt;Waycrest Manor&lt;/a&gt;. Arriving outside the gates, they were in shock as they learned the true identity of &lt;a href=\"The%20Mother\"&gt;The Mother&lt;/a&gt;: Lady Meredith Waycrest herself.\nUsing her Drust magic, The Mother bewitched Everit and forced him to attack her daughter. Lucille begged him to fight it, but to no avail. The Waycrest daughter was forced to watch her beloved friend die in front of her. Lucille knelt in tears before a fallen Reade while the Order of Embers gave him a final salute.\nMarshal Reade's death galvanized Lucille and the others, and they would go on to defeat The Mother and purge Waycrest Manor, marking final victory over the Heartsbane Coven. In the aftermath of the battle, the Inquisitor &lt;a href=\"Joan%20Cleardawn\"&gt;Joan Cleardawn&lt;/a&gt; was chosen by Lucille to fill the role of Marshal of the &lt;a href=\"Waycrest%20Guard\"&gt;Waycrest Guard&lt;/a&gt;, and carry on the legacy of Everit Reade.\nQuotes.\nGossip.\nThis land is dangerous.

Jack reportedly laughed as he took off with the badge. Haggard blames the fact that he was tricked on the poor lighting that day. He claims later on that he is nearly blind and wears an eyepatch as well. \nIn his younger days as the leader of the Stormwind Guard, he drank at the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Raven%20Tavern\"&gt;Scarlet Raven Tavern&lt;/a&gt; with his soldiers. He knows &lt;a href=\"Tavernkeep%20Smitts\"&gt;Tavernkeep Smitts&lt;/a&gt; from there. \nWhen he moved into Elwynn forest the previous owner of his dwelling left various papers in it, one of which was a faded journal page left that details the Legend of &lt;a href=\"Stalvan\"&gt;Stalvan&lt;/a&gt;.\nSince the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, he sends adventurers to &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt;.\nRelatives.\nHe may be related to &lt;a href=\"Rose%20Haggard\"&gt;Rose Haggard&lt;/a&gt;."}

His hardened veterans will weed out those who lack the stomach to face the ravening throngs of undead.\"\nStrategy.\nJacob Alerius is a very dangerous opponent. The big thing to watch out for is his Bladestorm ability which can, very quickly, kill all non-tanks in melee range when he starts spinning. Tanks will need to be careful not to accidentally drag him into another group member because even plate dps will be killed with just a few hits and the healer will most likely be focused on keeping the tank up. It's important to note that he moves as fast as you do when he Bladestorms so running is not an option.\nThe second thing to watch for with Alerius is your threat. Because of his Intercept ability, any ranged DPS or healer who manages to pull aggro will most likely immediately die when Jacob charges and one-shots them. Best case in this situation is Jacob kills the offending group member and bee-lines back to the tank. Worst-case he one-shots your healer in time for his Bladestorm cooldown to wipe out all your ranged DPS before they can even think about hitting their aggro-dumps"}

If you attack them, you will be flagged for PvP. Once in Loch Modan, just head all the way south and you will enter the &lt;a href=\"Badlands\"&gt;Badlands&lt;/a&gt;. While you are there, be sure to pick up the flight path at &lt;a href=\"Kargath\"&gt;Kargath&lt;/a&gt;.\nMartek the Exiled can be a little difficult to find. There is a sort of mountain range dividing the &lt;a href=\"Badlands\"&gt;Badlands&lt;/a&gt; down the middle, running vertically north-south, basically made up of the north and south border and two little clumps of mountains in between. Martek the Exiled can be found on the southern slopes of the northern clump of mountains. Coordinates (41,52)."}

Given its (original) description, the shirt is likely a weapon used by &lt;a href=\"Game%20Master\"&gt;Game Master&lt;/a&gt;s for testing purposes. It is not accessible to regular players.\nThe Martin Fury Scandal.\nIn April 2009, the player Karatechop from the guild \"The Marvel Family\" on received this item, which could be used to instantly kill all enemies in the vicinity of the user, from a guild member (Leroyspeltz) who had been granted it by mistake from a &lt;a href=\"Game%20Master\"&gt;Game Master&lt;/a&gt;. The mistake was caused by the Game Master trying to restore Leroyspeltz's account which had previously been hacked. Both Leroyspeltz and Karatechop believed the item had been purposefully given as it came from Blizzard Entertainment. \nThe guild used it 14 times to one-shot raid bosses, mostly in &lt;a href=\"Ulduar%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt; but also in &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Eye of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Sanctum\"&gt;Obsidian Sanctum&lt;/a&gt;, earning the participants several achievements for killing bosses. The rapid progress was claimed to have given them some \"world firsts\" even though it wasn't their intention to do so. The guild's usage of Martin Fury was eventually discovered by Blizzard Entertainment who chose to ban every online guild member for 24 hours - regardless of whether they had been participating in the raids or not. Some of them were not even aware of the item. Most (if not all) of the players considered this to be a rather impolite and a poor solution from Blizzard Entertainment's side, given how they had been unaware of the fact that using it was illegal. Karatechop's account was permanently banned, causing him to consider quitting World of Warcraft and try \"something else\" instead.\n&lt;a href=\"WoW%20Insider\"&gt;WoW Insider&lt;/a&gt;, which documented the story, later got to interview Karatechop about it, revealing some of this information. It is likely that Blizzard changed the attributes to make sure that this sort of thing never happened again."}

They are row upon row of warriors, statues armed for a battle that never began. What treasures do they guard? And what is their tie to the titanic power buried with them here in the shadows?\"\nSpells and Abilities.\nJan-Xi and Qin-Xi.\nJan-Xi and Qin-Xi activate after 90 seconds and share a health pool.\n&lt;a href=\"Titan%20Spark\"&gt;Titan Spark&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn Heroic difficulty, when any construct dies, a Titan Sparks are released.\nStrategy.\nThe fight alternates between an add phase and a brief reprieve, indicated on normal mode with Titan Gas.\nWhile Jan-xi and Qin-xi are active, each tank will have his/her own area by the left stairs and the right stairs, leaving the majority of the fight area free for the rest of the raid to deal with adds. Healers and ranged DPS should cluster together towards the center most of the time.\nThe DPS priority for killing adds is Courage &gt; Rages &gt; Strength &gt; Jan-xi and Qin-xi. The adds come out on a timer and in a set order. Courages are top priority and must be killed before they reach their target. Rages fixate and melee hard, so they should be killed quickly while being stunned and knocked back. Strengths have a normal aggro table but no melee attack, so they can be tanked by any DPS though it is preferable for a melee DPS to do it. Tank them to the side of the room to avoid AOE stunning the ranged group and keep it occupied until there are no Rages.\nFor Titan Gas, healers and ranged should group up for heals and melee can finally move to Jan-xi and Qin-xi. This is the brief reprieve from adds that allows the raid to whittle down the bosses. However, an important part of this encounter for the tanks and melee is the Devastating Combo. Not only is it a DPS gain for people who do it right, multiple people failing and getting hit during Titan Gas will put great strain on the healers.\nDevastating Combo.\nThe attacks performed by the bosses can be 180\u00b0 Devastating Arc front, left, or right, or a smaller 360\u00b0 Stomp. Each attack has its own wind-up pose. The leg raised precedes the 360\u00b0 stomp. A pre-thrust pose precedes the front blast. If he points his sword to the left or the right, then the side the sword starts on is safe and the other side is about to get blasted. To help people know where the front, left and right are, mark the tank. There is also a visual indicator that looks like a thin blue arc showing where the strike will hit. Dodging all five strikes will give a player an extra action button called Opportunistic Strike that s/he can use on Jan-xi or Qin-xi to deal a large amount of damage.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

Its original effect allowed the player to remove all movement imparing effects and all effects that cause a loss of control - an effect identical to &lt;a href=\"PvP%20trinket\"&gt;PvP insignia trinkets&lt;/a&gt;. The racial had a 2 minute cooldown and shared this cooldown with similar effects (notably the insignia trinkets). In &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt; combat, this allowed Human players to forego the insignia, often seen as mandatory for PvP, and instead replace it with a stronger trinket. After much controversy, a brief attempt to balance the racial was made at the start of the \"\" expansion by increasing the cooldown to 3 minutes. This change was reverted soon after, with a statement from &lt;a href=\"Ghostcrawler\"&gt;Ghostcrawler&lt;/a&gt; saying they believed they had overnerfed the racial. \n&lt;a href=\"Patch%207.0.3\"&gt;Patch 7.0.3&lt;/a&gt; reworked Every Man for Himself by changing it to only remove stun effects, rather than all &lt;a href=\"crowd%20control\"&gt;crowd control&lt;/a&gt; effects, and made the effect from insignia trinkets a baseline ability to all classes, available for use in PvP combat."}

The dreadlord relishes that he has twisted Willey and other Scarlet Crusaders--who so despised the undead in life--into his unwitting pawns.\"\nStrategy.\nThe Cannon Master himself is not a very difficult foe to defeat, but reinforcements continually arrive, stand in one spot, and fire on your party. They can be killed by loading and firing the cannons beside the Cannon Master with ammo from the piles beside the Cannon Master.\nBefore the fight, designate someone to be the \"Cannon Boy\". Healers or ranged DPS are the best candidates for this. Periodically, this person should fire the cannon to kill all the reinforcements that spawn at the end of the hall, though conservation of ammo is important. Always hold on to at least one cannon ball, as Willey's death spawns a bunch of the Riflemen, which are very hard to take out by more traditional methods."}

Considering the substantial price of invitations on the Black Market, Willy is probably the cheapest and easiest way of obtaining an invitation - if you can get to him before someone else does.\nTrivia.\nWilly Wilder is a reference to , the actor who played in the 1971 film \"\". The story begins with the tale's protagonist finding himself in possession of one of the extremely rare Golden Tickets, special invites to Willy Wonka's chocolate factory."}

Although he exudes arrogance, the cunning insectoid is fiercely protective of his soldiers and enjoys fighting at their side. Mel'jarak believes the mantid are superior to all other races, convinced that his kind cannot be defeated.\"\nSpells and abilities.\nWind Lord Mel'jarak.\nHealth:\nThe Swarm.\nWind Lord Mel'jarak fights alongside his most trusted warriors.\n&lt;a href=\"Sra%27thik%20Amber-Trapper\"&gt;Sra'thik Amber-Trapper&lt;/a&gt;.\nHealth:\n&lt;a href=\"Zar%27thik%20Battle-Mender\"&gt;Zar'thik Battle-Mender&lt;/a&gt;.\nHealth:\n&lt;a href=\"Kor%27thik%20Elite%20Blademaster\"&gt;Kor'thik Elite Blademaster&lt;/a&gt;.\nHealth:\nStrategy.\nAbilities overview.\nThe Wind Lord Mel'jarak encounter is one long phase, but deals with three sets of three adds first.\nMel'jarak has his own abilities he uses, most for the entire fight. He first casts Whirling Blade at a random player in the raid, dealing a large amount of Physical damage to all players in the path from Mel'jarak to the player, and again from the player back to Mel'jarak. He also casts Rain of Blades, dealing a small amount of Physical damage to all players every half-second for six seconds.\nBelow 75% health, he starts casting Wind Bomb at a random player's position, dealing a decent amount of nature damage to players within five yards of that player. After a few seconds, the wind bomb will arm, and will deal a one-shottable amount of damage to the entire raid if any player comes within six yards of it. Wind Bombs last for the rest of the encounter or until they are detonated.\nIn normal mode, Mel'jarak's Watchful Eye limits the amount of impaling spears that can be active at any time. Before any group is killed, Mel'jarak will allow four spears to incapacitate his warriors; after the first group is killed, he allows two; and he will allow none after the second group is killed. Once a group of warriors is killed, Mel'jarak gains Recklessness, increasing his damage dealt by 50% but increasing his damage taken by 33% for the rest of the encounter. Recklessness stacks and becomes more powerful after each group is killed. He will allow four spears out at a time both in Raid Finder mode and in Heroic mode, but Heroic mode adds its own wrinkles: He will summon a new set of warriors 45 seconds after the group fell, and Recklessness only lasts for 30 seconds, but instead increases damage dealt by 100% and increases damage taken by 600%.\nSra'thik Amber-Trappers have two abilities: They will cast an Amber Prison upon random units of the raid, trapping that target until the prison is interacted with by another player. In non-Raid Finder difficulties, interacting with the prison will debuff that player with Residue, preventing that player from freeing others for 45 seconds. Amber-Trappers also cast Corrosive Resin at random players, debuffing that target with 5 stacks of Corrosive Resin. Stacks are removed by moving, but will leave Corrosive Resin Pools on the ground for some time.\nKor'thik Elite Blademasters have one ability, Kor'thik Strike, where they all focus a single player and strike it in unison, each dealing a large amount of Physical damage. At least one Blademaster must be impaled at all times, or the damage dealt by all three will one-shot most players.\nZar'thik Battle-Menders have two abilities: Mending, which is an &lt;a href=\"interrupt\"&gt;interrupt&lt;/a&gt;able 15% of total health heal, or Quickening, which stacks a +25% damage and melee speed buff on the swarm, but can be &lt;a href=\"dispel\"&gt;dispel&lt;/a&gt;led. &lt;a href=\"Mass%20Dispel\"&gt;Mass Dispel&lt;/a&gt; is useful for this.\nTactics.\nBefore the encounter begins, four players should interact with the weapon racks left along the wall to gain a bonus ability, Impaling Spear, which will &lt;a href=\"crowd%20control\"&gt;crowd control&lt;/a&gt; one mantid for 50 seconds. The spear can be reapplied as often as desired, but Mel'jarak will only let so many of his warriors be crowd controlled at a time. Depending on raid composition, raiders may wish to impale one amber-trapper, one blademaster, and two battle-menders, or some other combination. Crowd-controlling all three of one set is not recommended, as they thus cannot be killed.\nA useful macro for the CCers of this fight is:\n codice_1\nMake sure to set a focus target before the pull.\nFor Mel'jarak's abilities, to minimize damage players should spread out in a circle around him for Whirling Blade purposes and additionally stay a few yards away from each other once he starts casting Wind Bomb. Done properly, no Wind Bombs will be triggered, so players should move to the edge of the Wind Bomb activation radius in an attempt to not waste space.\nImmediately before the pull, all four impaling spear users should (re)apply the spear to the target, keeping them all on one side of the room. Let a tank pull, and hold off on DPS until the tanks have Mel'jarak and all of the active adds under control. The non-crowd controlled adds should be grouped up on top of Mel'jarak and &lt;a href=\"area%20of%20effect\"&gt;area of effect&lt;/a&gt; abilities should be used liberally. Make sure the impaling spear users keep an eye on their target and reapply the spear before it expires or if it breaks. Otherwise, interrupt the mending, break players out of the amber prisons, and top players off who are targeted by the Kor'thik strike.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

There is a ramp leading up to Highperch from the valley floor, a totem pole marks the bottom of it. Coordinates are (15,33).\nThe eggs are scattered all around Highperch.

Wind serpents seem to have a connection with &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20the%20Soulflayer\"&gt;Hakkar the Soulflayer&lt;/a&gt;. The Vale Screechers are said by &lt;a href=\"Yeh%27kinya\"&gt;Yeh'kinya&lt;/a&gt; to be \"the cousins of an old, old god, and their spirits are linked to him\" in the quest &lt;a href=\"Screecher%20Spirits\"&gt;Screecher Spirits&lt;/a&gt;. He then says that this \"old, old god\" is the \"dead god Hakkar, the Soulflayer\".\nAnother type of the wind serpent can be found in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. They have smooth, vibrant skin and alien, bony features with spikes. This is a mutation, as before &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;'s destruction they were identical to the Azerothian breed. The wind serpents of Draenor were the children of &lt;a href=\"Sethe\"&gt;Sethe&lt;/a&gt;. As Sethe's bones vanished when the &lt;a href=\"Spires%20of%20Arak\"&gt;Spires of Arak&lt;/a&gt; were destroyed during the formation of Outland, the wind serpents in Outland are seemingly leaderless.\nMost wind serpents subsist on a diet of fish, but a good hunter can offer much more interesting prey.\n&lt;a href=\"Skeletal%20wind%20serpent\"&gt;Skeletal wind serpent&lt;/a&gt;s are undead wind serpents.\nKnown species.\nWind serpents vary drastically across species.\nAs a hunter pet.\nWind Serpents are a family of &lt;a href=\"Cunning%20pets\"&gt;Cunning pets&lt;/a&gt; and are tamable by &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s starting at level 11. Wind Serpents, through the use of their &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Breath\"&gt;Lightning Breath&lt;/a&gt;, breathe lightning, increasing magic damage taken by 8% for 45 sec. There are a twelve different skins available for wind serpent pets- both with normal and spiked wings. The found in &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Drak\"&gt;Zul'Drak&lt;/a&gt; has an unique white and black skin. Wind serpents were once a popular pet, due to its easy diet, accessibility, and good skills. Wind serpents have become more uncommon as other pet families have gained useful skills as well.\nIn the RPG.\nThese serpents are sometimes found in the Barrens, and they are often revered by local tribes of savage races such as &lt;a href=\"quilboar\"&gt;quilboar&lt;/a&gt;, who see wind serpents as spirits of the sky. Wind serpents are simple &lt;a href=\"beast\"&gt;beast&lt;/a&gt;s that reach sizes of 4 to 6 feet in length and can weigh up to 50 pounds. While green is the most common color, their scales can range in any hue from dark brown to a faint orange color. Their plumage often matches their scales, but with red or yellow tips. Most wind serpents subsist on a diet of rabbits and rodents, but they will eat things as large as small wild pigs or young sheep. While not aggressive, wind serpents are territorial, tending to attack anything that comes near their nests, built high in trees. Wind serpents are predators that ambush their prey, crawling among tree branches or flying silently out from a dark nook. They attack with lightning speed, swiftly poisoning their prey to death.\nWind serpents vary drastically across species. Some are constrictors rather than vipers. Other wind serpents are in truth magical beasts instead of animals, and have an astonishing variety of magical abilities. Magical wind serpents tend to be slightly larger and tougher, than normal wind serpents. The &lt;a href=\"cloud%20Serpent\"&gt;cloud serpent&lt;/a&gt; represents one such magical variety of wind serpent, in this case one having the ability to breathe lightning. They are distantly related to &lt;a href=\"couatl\"&gt;couatl&lt;/a&gt;."}

They were used to summon &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt; nobles from the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Plane\"&gt;Elemental Plane&lt;/a&gt;.\nSince &lt;a href=\"patch%204.0.3a\"&gt;patch 4.0.3a&lt;/a&gt;, the items used to summon the elementals no longer drop, and the wind stones are now unusable.\nGeneral Information.\nIn Silithus, there are four Twilight camps. In three of the camps, there are three different kinds of stones: one Greater Wind Stone, one Wind stone, and two Lesser Wind Stones. Each of the stones summoned an Abyssal &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt;. The more powerful the wind stone, the more powerful the elemental was, and the better the loot. What they dropped depended on which one was summoned.\nUse of any of the stones required, at minimum, the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Trappings\"&gt;Twilight Trappings&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"set\"&gt;set&lt;/a&gt;*. This is a three-piece cloth armor set with a head, shoulder, and chest piece. They have no stats and the set bonus only allowed the player to interact with wind stones. Summoning a &lt;a href=\"Abyssal%20Duke\"&gt;Duke&lt;/a&gt; also required a &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Cultist%20Medallion%20of%20Station\"&gt;Twilight Cultist Medallion of Station&lt;/a&gt;, whereas summoning a &lt;a href=\"Abyssal%20Lord\"&gt;Lord&lt;/a&gt; required the medallion and a &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Cultist%20Ring%20of%20Lordship\"&gt;Twilight Cultist Ring of Lordship&lt;/a&gt;. \"* Note: These items still drop, and are not soulbound. However, the Shattering rendered the elementals unsummonable, and thus these items have no use.\"\nAttempting to use a wind stone without the appropriate gear resulted in a rather unpleasant effect: you were struck by a damaging bolt that would almost one-shot you.\nThe Twilight Trappings set pieces drop from the cultists in the camps. The &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Cultist%20Medallion%20of%20Station\"&gt;Twilight Cultist Medallion of Station&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Cultist%20Ring%20of%20Lordship\"&gt;Twilight Cultist Ring of Lordship&lt;/a&gt; were acquired via quests that required killing three lower-level &lt;a href=\"Abyssal%20Templar\"&gt;Templars&lt;/a&gt; and turning in &lt;a href=\"Large%20Brilliant%20Shard\"&gt;Large Brilliant Shard&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo summon one of the Abyssal elementals, players had to equip the appropriate equipment, then click on the wind stone. A dialog window would appear, whereupon the players would re-equip their regular armor and complete the dialog. The Abyssal elemental would appear, initially invulnerable, but five seconds later it would become attackable. It was automatically tapped by the group that summoned it. The wind stone was destroyed by the summoning, but it would respawn sometime later.\nUsing the Twilight Set, Medallion of Station, or the Ring of Lordship to activate any of the Wind stones consumed the three armor pieces, medallion, and ring. The elementals also despawned immediately upon leaving combat.\nObjects of Beckoning.\nInstead of giving your &lt;a href=\"Encrypted%20Twilight%20Text\"&gt;Encrypted Twilight Text&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt;, you may hand it in at &lt;a href=\"Hermit%20Ortell\"&gt;Hermit Ortell&lt;/a&gt;. He will decrypt the texts for you and send them to you. In the package you receive from him, you may find a scroll to create a random &lt;a href=\"Object%20of%20Beckoning\"&gt;object of beckoning&lt;/a&gt; which can then be used to choose a specific boss at the wind stones:\nThis means there are 12 different types of scrolls, and you cannot predict if you will get any specific type of scroll in the mail. Each of the scrolls require various reagents, ranging from 1-20 &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Air\"&gt;Elemental Air&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Dense%20Stone\"&gt;Dense Stone&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Firebloom\"&gt;Firebloom&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Enchanted%20Water\"&gt;Enchanted Water&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rugged%20Leather\"&gt;Rugged Leather&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Truesilver%20Rod\"&gt;Truesilver Rod&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Rune\"&gt;Dark Rune&lt;/a&gt;. \nFor more information on this topic, see &lt;a href=\"Object%20of%20Beckoning\"&gt;Object of Beckoning&lt;/a&gt; and the page on &lt;a href=\"Hermit%20Ortell\"&gt;Hermit Ortell&lt;/a&gt;.\nStones.\nLesser Wind Stones.\nThe Lesser Wind stones summon &lt;a href=\"Abyssal%20Templar\"&gt;Templars&lt;/a&gt;. Using a Lesser Wind stone requires: \nThe Lesser Wind Stones summon a Templar, a &lt;a href=\"level\"&gt;level&lt;/a&gt; 60 &lt;a href=\"elite\"&gt;elite&lt;/a&gt; that can be taken down by a group of 1-3 players. There are 4 possible Templars, one of which is randomly summoned. However, you can pick which Templar you would like to summon if you acquire the right &lt;a href=\"Object%20of%20Beckoning\"&gt;Crest of Beckoning&lt;/a&gt; and appropriate materials.\nDrops: \nNormal Wind Stones.\nThe \"normal\" Wind stones spawn &lt;a href=\"Abyssal%20Duke\"&gt;Dukes&lt;/a&gt;. Using a \"normal\" Wind stone requires:\nWearing the Set and the Medallion allows you to activate the Wind stone, which will summon a random Duke. You can specify which Duke you wish to summon by acquiring the appropriate &lt;a href=\"Object%20of%20Beckoning\"&gt;Signet of Beckoning&lt;/a&gt;. These are level 62 elites, and can be taken by a small group of players of the appropriate level (or soloed by higher level players). A tank, healer and 2 ranged DPS works great. The respawn time on the Wind stones seems to be approximately 15 minutes.\nDrops: \nQuick numbers to summon one random Duke: \nGreater Wind Stones.\nGreater Wind stones summon &lt;a href=\"Abyssal%20Lord\"&gt;Lords&lt;/a&gt;. Using a Greater Wind stone requires: \nActivating the Greater Wind stone will randomly summon one of the raid bosses listed below. Originally they required anywhere from 20-40 people to defeat! Since then, they have been significantly downgraded, and would require a much more modest group (and can even be soloed by most players at level 70). You can specify which Lord you want to summon if you have the appropriate &lt;a href=\"Object%20of%20Beckoning\"&gt;Scepter of Beckoning&lt;/a&gt;. The Greater Wind stone will respawn in 3 hours from when you summon a Lord.\nDrops:\nThe Abyssal Scepter can be used to complete the quest &lt;a href=\"Scepter%20of%20the%20Council\"&gt;Scepter of the Council&lt;/a&gt;. This yields 150 &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; Reputation and a &lt;a href=\"Chest%20of%20Spoils\"&gt;Chest of Spoils&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe Chest of Spoils contains a variety of goods. They always contain a variety of high-level potions (&lt;a href=\"Greater%20Healing%20Potion\"&gt;Greater Healing Potion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Fire%20Protection%20Potion\"&gt;Greater Fire Protection Potion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Shadow%20Protection%20Potion\"&gt;Greater Shadow Protection Potion&lt;/a&gt;, etc.) +, &lt;a href=\"Dense%20Sharpening%20Stone\"&gt;Dense Sharpening Stone&lt;/a&gt;, and they may also have a high level item or even a high level item. There is a good chance that neither an epic or a rare will drop.\nQuick numbers of total required items to summon 1 random Lord (including items to summon Dukes as precursor): \nQuotes.\nBe gone, infidel! May the power of the Abyss smite you down!\nA faint whisper is heard from within the stone...\nGreetings, little one. Do you have news for the Templar? "}

In ages past, she was a &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Titanic%20watcher\"&gt;watcher&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"sorcerer\"&gt;sorceress&lt;/a&gt; and the adopted daughter of &lt;a href=\"Keeper\"&gt;Keeper&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Odyn\"&gt;Odyn&lt;/a&gt;. When she spoke out against Odyn, he forcefully transformed her into the first of the spectral &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt;, tasked with bringing the souls of fallen vrykul to the keeper's &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Halls of Valor&lt;/a&gt; to become his &lt;a href=\"Valarjar\"&gt;Valarjar&lt;/a&gt; champions.\nThe corrupted keeper &lt;a href=\"Loken\"&gt;Loken&lt;/a&gt; eventually convinced Helya to turn against Odyn by imprisoning him and the Valarjar in the Halls of Valor. She subsequently created her own afterlife, Helheim, where unworthy vrykul souls are transformed into vengeful &lt;a href=\"kvaldir\"&gt;kvaldir&lt;/a&gt;. Helya created the &lt;a href=\"Helarjar\"&gt;Helarjar&lt;/a&gt; as a mockery of Odyn's Valarjar. The kvaldir drag the souls of the unworthy and dishonorable to Helheim for Helya, as well as raiding the coasts and taking the souls of those they kill, thus robbing Odyn of potential champions.\nBiography.\nHelya was originally a gifted &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"sorcerer\"&gt;sorceress&lt;/a&gt; who battled the forces of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s under the leadership of the keepers. After the keepers defeated the Old Gods' &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt; servants, &lt;a href=\"Ra\"&gt;Highkeeper Ra&lt;/a&gt; called on Helya to aid him in crafting the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Plane\"&gt;Elemental Plane&lt;/a&gt; as a permanent prison for the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Lord\"&gt;Elemental Lord&lt;/a&gt;s and their minions. In addition, the two crafted &lt;a href=\"%3Athe%20Highkeeper%27s%20Ward\"&gt;:the Highkeeper's Ward&lt;/a&gt; to act as a key to the pocket dimension.\nOver the ages, &lt;a href=\"Odyn\"&gt;Keeper Odyn&lt;/a&gt; came to see Helya as his adopted daughter. When the keepers decided to ask the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; to empower the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt; for their heroism against &lt;a href=\"Galakrond\"&gt;Galakrond&lt;/a&gt;, Odyn was vehemently against it, stating that only titan-forged could be trusted to defend Azeroth. The Aspects were empowered despite his objections, and so Odyn ordered Helya to magically tear off a section of &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt; and raise it into the sky, creating the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Halls of Valor&lt;/a&gt;. Odyn then told the &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; that those who died a worthy death in battle would have their spirits brought to the Halls and given new bodies to fight as his &lt;a href=\"Valarjar\"&gt;Valarjar&lt;/a&gt;, which Odyn thought would be better defenders than the dragons. In order to retrieve the spirits of the deceased, Odyn would need vrykul to volunteer to become undead and take those spirits from the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;. Since no one was willing to make this sacrifice, Odyn decided he would need to create his servants by force. Helya objected, and the argument between her and Odyn grew so heated that she threatened to return the Halls of Valor to Ulduar. Seeing Helya's disobedience as a threat to his plans, Odyn shattered her physical form, twisted her spirit into the first &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt;, and ordered her to begin ferrying vrykul souls from the Shadowlands as well as transform other unwilling vrykul into Val'kyr. Odyn would later lie to his followers that Helya's transformation had been due to her own arrogance: he claimed that during their argument, she had reached out for the power of the Shadowlands and subsequently gotten sucked into the realm, destroying her body and transforming her into a twisted wraith before he managed to pull her out and that she had subsequently apologized and begged him to make her a Val'kyr.\nHelya nursed resentment against Odyn for thousands of years, until the day &lt;a href=\"Loken\"&gt;Loken&lt;/a&gt;, a keeper who had been influenced by &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt;, reached out to her and promised to free her if she turned against her master. Helya used the same magic that had been used to lock the Elemental Plane to seal Odyn and his Valarjar army inside the Halls of Valor and then decided herself to become the caretaker of vrykul souls in her new realm &lt;a href=\"Helheim\"&gt;Helheim&lt;/a&gt;. The darkness that had long festered in her heart transformed Helheim into a dark, nightmarish place, and the vrykul souls who arrived there soon turned into &lt;a href=\"Kvaldir\"&gt;Kvaldir&lt;/a&gt;. Shortly after Helya sealed the Halls of Valor, she was found and attacked by &lt;a href=\"Ingvar\"&gt;Ingvar&lt;/a&gt;, one of the few Valarjar who had been outside the Halls at the time. Ingvar almost managed to kill Helya with his weapons, the &lt;a href=\"Warswords%20of%20the%20Valarjar\"&gt;Warswords of the Valarjar&lt;/a&gt;, but Helya overpowered and destroyed him, subsequently keeping the warswords as a memento of her victory over Odyn.\nOver millennia, Helya claimed as many souls of slain vrykul as she could, further swelling the ranks of the Kvaldir. She eventually began to go after the living as well, sending her Kvaldir to kill anyone about to learn the truth about the conflict between her and Odyn. She began raising her own champions, the &lt;a href=\"Helarjar\"&gt;Helarjar&lt;/a&gt;, and had them search Azeroth for her enemies. Eventually, a kvaldir named &lt;a href=\"Vigfus%20Bladewind\"&gt;Vigfus Bladewind&lt;/a&gt; caught Helya's attention after distinguishing himself in battle against vrykul. Helya gifted him with the Warswords of the Valarjar and committed some of her own power into the blades, increasing their lethality and making it easier for her to claim their victims' souls. Vigfus went on to serve as Helya's champion for millennia and used the swords to kill countless vrykul heroes.\nAt an unknown point in time, &lt;a href=\"Mueh%27zala\"&gt;Mueh'zala&lt;/a&gt; introduced Helya to &lt;a href=\"Zovaal\"&gt;Zovaal the Jailer&lt;/a&gt; and recruited her to &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;his side&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion's invasion of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, the Jailer sent his new ally &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; to Helheim to make a bargain with Helya for one of her artifacts, a magical lantern called the &lt;a href=\"Soulcage\"&gt;Soulcage&lt;/a&gt;. Sylvanas was to use it to take control of &lt;a href=\"Eyir\"&gt;Eyir&lt;/a&gt;\u2014the new leader of Odyn's Val'kyr\u2014and force her to deliver her Val'kyr to Helya, who would in turn corrupt them and bring them over to the Jailer's side. Helya was initially reluctant to part with the artifact, until Sylvanas pointed out that the deal would benefit her as much as it would benefit the Jailer. Helya agreed but told Sylvanas to remember their bargain and warned her not to cross her.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;order leader&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ashildir\"&gt;Ashildir&lt;/a&gt; approached Helya to release them from Helheim, Helya agreed that she would so only if they killed her champion. However when her champion &lt;a href=\"Geir\"&gt;Geir&lt;/a&gt; was slain Helya grew enraged and declared that the pair would pay for killing her darling pet. Thus despite fulfilling their end of the bargain Helya refused to fulfill hers and declared none would leave Helheim while she ruled. However, an unknown force guides the order leader and Ashildir out of Helheim to Helya's shock and rage, with Ashildir pointing out that it seemed that even Helya must honor her word.\nShe is the final boss of the &lt;a href=\"Maw%20of%20Souls\"&gt;Maw of Souls&lt;/a&gt; and escapes before she is killed, warning that the adventurers have merely survived the storm and that the seas are unstoppable.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Rockaway%20Coast\"&gt;Rockaway Coast&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Highmountain\"&gt;Highmountain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Helarjar%20Ritualist\"&gt;Helarjar Ritualist&lt;/a&gt;s tried to summon the &lt;a href=\"Vision%20of%20Helya\"&gt;Vision of Helya&lt;/a&gt;, but were stopped by the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;order leaders&lt;/a&gt; directed by &lt;a href=\"Odyn\"&gt;Odyn&lt;/a&gt;. At an unknown point in time, Helya stole the soul of &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; out of the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; and brought him to Helheim. &lt;a href=\"Xe%27ra\"&gt;Xe'ra&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt; speculate that struck a deal with Helya to get him there.\nWhen Odyn discovers that Helya's forces are able to transform his stormforged Valarjar into Kvaldir, he decides that he has had enough and sends adventurers to slay her. With her defeat, the Keeper Odyn was freed from the curse that imprisoned him within the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Halls of Valor&lt;/a&gt; and the soul of Illidan Stormrage was saved.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nWhile on &lt;a href=\"island%20expedition\"&gt;island expedition&lt;/a&gt;s, adventurers can discover a &lt;a href=\"%3ARing%20of%20the%20Reefs\"&gt;:Ring of the Reefs&lt;/a&gt; that was granted to powerful kvaldir mistweavers by Helya herself. Sensing Helya's power on the ring, the adventurers bring it to &lt;a href=\"Valdemar%20Stormseeker\"&gt;Valdemar Stormseeker&lt;/a&gt;, who claims that Helya wasn't truly defeated and that she is now growing in power, saying \"You cannot kill death!\".\nThe &lt;a href=\"kvaldir\"&gt;kvaldir&lt;/a&gt; encountered during the expeditions reference a \"she\" and \"her\", likely alluding to Helya:\nShadowlands.\nHelya returned as part of the &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt; serving &lt;a href=\"the%20Jailer\"&gt;the Jailer&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt;, claiming the Mawsworn as her own. Helya attacked &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; as they crossed a bridge over within the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt;, while taunting them that their wretched souls will feed the coming darkness. However, Jaina was unmoved and countered that she was beaten by a force of \"wretched\" champions and Thrall threw &lt;a href=\"Dra%27gora\"&gt;his axe&lt;/a&gt; at her. In outrage over all this, Helya knocked them all off the bridge and into the river of souls.\nHelya then appeared as a projection in &lt;a href=\"Bastion\"&gt;Bastion&lt;/a&gt; where &lt;a href=\"Lysonia\"&gt;Lysonia&lt;/a&gt; informed her that the &lt;a href=\"Ward%20of%20Courage\"&gt;Ward of Courage&lt;/a&gt; had been sabotaged. Helya was pleased by this information and remarked that their allies were eager to strike. She then canceled the projection, as the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Rituals\"&gt;House of Rituals&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Constructs\"&gt;House of Constructs&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxus\"&gt;Maldraxxus&lt;/a&gt; began their attack on the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Courage\"&gt;Temple of Courage&lt;/a&gt;. Later when Lysonia failed to corrupt &lt;a href=\"Chyrus\"&gt;Chyrus&lt;/a&gt;, Helya ordered her to return to the Maw, referring to her as \"my pet.\" At the &lt;a href=\"Altar%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Altar of Domination&lt;/a&gt; she urged Lysonia to drain the power from &lt;a href=\"Uther\"&gt;Uther&lt;/a&gt;, transforming her into the Paragon of Doubt.\nHelya held &lt;a href=\"kyrian\"&gt;kyrian&lt;/a&gt; captive in Gorgoa, attempting to drown them in the souls until they broke, and joined the Mawsworn's ranks. Oddly enough, she doesn't interfere when adventurers seek to liberate them from such a fate.\nSometime later, Helya and &lt;a href=\"Vyraz\"&gt;Vyraz&lt;/a&gt; convened within &lt;a href=\"Helgarde%20Keep\"&gt;Helgarde Keep&lt;/a&gt;, where they were confronted by &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Draka\"&gt;Draka&lt;/a&gt;, and the Maw Walker. She subsequently mocked Vyraz for his fear, before giving him a boon in order to deal with the trio, while she clashed with the &lt;a href=\"Primus\"&gt;Primus&lt;/a&gt;. Following Vyraz's death, the Primus banished Helya from the Maw, back to &lt;a href=\"Helheim\"&gt;Helheim&lt;/a&gt;.\nPowers and Abilities.\nHelya was known mainly for her great magical abilities, being a very talented sorceress, knowledgeable in various spells and secret rituals, including the one she used to temporarily open the veil of the Shadowlands.\nArtifacts.\nHelya is known for hoarding many powerful trinkets and artifacts brought by the souls who arrive in Helheim.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}
