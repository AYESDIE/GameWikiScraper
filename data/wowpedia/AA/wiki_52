His brother &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; mentioned that he would like to know what the relics do and what their stories are, but that they should not use them unless they are already on the brink of global catastrophe.\nGetting there.\nThere are a number of methods for entering and leaving Wintergrasp.\nAs a &lt;a href=\"PvP%20zone\"&gt;PvP zone&lt;/a&gt;, Wintergrasp must be queued for by attempting to enter the zone. Unlike battlegrounds, players are not returned to their previous location at the conclusion of the battle; rather, players can choose the 'Leave Wintergrasp' option from the button on edge of the mini-map - which has the effect of instantly using the player's &lt;a href=\"Hearthstone\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;, even if it is already on cooldown - or simply travel out of the zone by themselves. Flying mount is the preferable method for directly leaving Wintergrasp; while it is possible to travel out of the zone at numerous points along its border, due to its elevation above the surrounding zones, attempts can often prove fatal without either some method of mitigating fall damage (such as &lt;a href=\"Levitate\"&gt;Levitate&lt;/a&gt;) or great care. Probably the easiest place to attempt to exit on foot is from near the southwest graveyard, where the cliffs give players a fighting chance of surviving the descent.\nWintergrasp can be reached via portals from Dalaran, one portal for each faction. There is also a portal inside Wintergrasp's Relic Chamber that can be used by anyone who can get to it, which teleports you to the Violet Citadel. Wintergrasp can also be reached on foot, details of which can be found in &lt;a href=\"Getting_to_Wintergrasp_and_Dalaran%23Getting_to_Wintergrasp_through_Icecrown\"&gt;getting to Wintergrasp through Icecrown&lt;/a&gt; (you generally have to die at least once, this way, though). Perhaps the most convenient method is simply to fly into the zone. Players should be aware that flying into the Wintergrasp zone (even when no battle is in progress) will cause a forced dismount; players should therefore enter at a low altitude unless they have some defence against a sudden fall.\nPlayers can also fly in to or out of Wintergrasp via the flight master near the attackers' rally point. The Horde rally point is on the west side beyond the western goblin workshop (also known as the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Temple\"&gt;Broken Temple&lt;/a&gt;), and the Alliance rally point is north-east of the eastern goblin workshop (also known as the &lt;a href=\"Sunken%20Ring\"&gt;Sunken Ring&lt;/a&gt;). Entering the zone on a taxi (flying mount from a flight master NPC) lets you stay in WG even if it is full; you will NOT be ported out.\nGeography.\nWintergrasp is a frozen valley located in western-central Northrend, between &lt;a href=\"Sholazar%20Basin\"&gt;Sholazar Basin&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Borean%20Tundra\"&gt;Borean Tundra&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt;. There are a few smaller bodies of water sparsed throughout the region. It is about the same size as &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;.\nNotable characters.\nWintergrasp is home to several characters of status. Many of the commanding officers from both sides hail from the early days of &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Valley\"&gt;Alterac Valley&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20Murp\"&gt;Lieutenant Murp&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Primalist%20Mulfort\"&gt;Primalist Mulfort&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Senior%20Demolitionist%20Legoso\"&gt;Senior Demolitionist Legoso&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tactical%20Officer%20Kilrath\"&gt;Tactical Officer Kilrath&lt;/a&gt; also make a reappearance from their first trials in the Burning Crusade, hailing from &lt;a href=\"Bloodmyst%20Isle\"&gt;Bloodmyst Isle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Terokkar%20Forest\"&gt;Terokkar Forest&lt;/a&gt;, respectively.\nQuests.\nThe PvP quests in Wintergrasp yield money and honor for completing them.\nNPCs and monsters.\nLevel 80 elementals of all known kinds (earth, fire, water, air, shadow, life) wander in various areas. The side that controls Wintergrasp Keep will be able to see elemental Revenants, with roughly twice as much health as the regular elementals and a guaranteed droprate for crystallized elements. \nEach side also has NPC guards, which can be found near the vehicle shops, attacker's towers, inside the Keep, and at various points along the roadways. Killing the guards will reward credit for your faction's 'Kill Players' quest, as well as up your count for the rank. In the level 90 version of the zone, the guards are level 88; in the lower-level version, they are level 76.\nWintergrasp as a PvP zone.\nEvery 2 hours 30 minutes (on average - the exact time varies), Wintergrasp becomes a unique type of PvP battleground, and anyone in the zone will be prompted to join the battle. The faction that won the last Wintergrasp battle must defend Wintergrasp Keep for 30 minutes, while the opposing faction attacks the keep. The battle for Wintergrasp is open only to level 90 characters.\nBoth factions can take control of workshops scattered around the zone. Once players have acquired sufficient rank (from killing enemy players or NPCs) they can go to these workshops to construct &lt;a href=\"Siege%20weapon\"&gt;siege engines&lt;/a&gt;. To take the keep, the attacking faction must break down walls by causing siege damage with siege engines and items that cause siege damage, ultimately entering the Relic Chamber in the keep's innermost area to claim victory. The defending faction's task is simple; defend the keep until the battle's timer expires.\nThree towers in the southern part of the zone provide an additional objective: Destroying a tower grants a damage buff, and destruction of all three towers shortens the battle's time by 10 minutes.\nAfter Wintergrasp Keep has been captured, or successfully defended, it will be controlled by that faction for approximately 2 hours 30 minutes. The status of Wintergrasp and whether or not it is contested can be seen on the Northrend map by the appearance or absence of a faction symbol (or a PvP symbol indicating control of the keep is being contested) over the zone.\nTo find out when the next battle is starting, view the Wintergrasp zone of the World Map, which displays a countdown timer for the next battle. Prior to &lt;a href=\"patch%203.3.3\"&gt;patch 3.3.3&lt;/a&gt;, the World Map timer would not display if you hadn't been to Northrend since logging in and would display the last known time if you traveled to an area outside of Northrend.\nRanks.\nAfter killing five enemy players, defensive cannons or NPC guards during a Wintergrasp match, you are given the rank of Corporal. This allows you to create &lt;a href=\"Wintergrasp%20Catapult\"&gt;Wintergrasp Catapult&lt;/a&gt;s at Goblin Workshops. Ten enemy kills after your field promotion, you are given the rank of First Lieutenant, which allows you to create &lt;a href=\"Wintergrasp%20Demolisher\"&gt;Wintergrasp Demolisher&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Wintergrasp%20Siege%20Engine\"&gt;Wintergrasp Siege Engine&lt;/a&gt;s.\nQueuing.\nSince patch 3.2.0 you have to queue to join the battle of Wintergrasp, by attempting to enter the zone. You need to be at least Level 75 to join. The queue will accept 120 players from each faction, so a total of 240 players can join the battle. Higher level players have a higher probability to join the queue than lower level players.\nIf you want to join the Wintergrasp battle and are queued but are not called to join, there is a bypass to this. Simply take a taxi from Dalaran or some other Flightpath in Northrend to your faction's landing camp in Wintergrasp. You won't earn any rank or honor from PVP kills unless you inflict at least some damage to the target.\nIf you are in the zone, but not in queue when the battle starts, you will be teleported away to a \"safe\" area of Icecrown just north of Wintergrasp. But be warned, all players ported out will be sent to the same location, Horde and Alliance alike. Since you will still be flagged as PvP, be prepared to fight.\nSince &lt;a href=\"Patch%204.0.3\"&gt;Patch 4.0.3&lt;/a&gt;, players of both factions can only enter at a 1:1 ratio. If 10 Alliance are in the queue and 15 Horde are in the queue, only 10 from the Horde queue will enter when all 10 Alliance will enter. At that point, any future Alliance player(s) entering will be balanced with the same number of Horde player(s) entering. Because of this change, &lt;a href=\"Tenacity\"&gt;Tenacity&lt;/a&gt; is no longer applicable under normal circumstances. However if multiple players from one faction leave the battle while the other faction's players remain one may see a Tenacity buff, although very rarely and at low stacks.\nPlayer-held weapons.\nPlayers are able to inflict damage to vehicles and turrets with spells and weapons; players cannot damage walls or towers without a vehicle or weapon that deals siege damage.\nGoblin Workshops inside the keep and on the southern half of the map spawn multiple copies of &lt;a href=\"The%20RP-GG\"&gt;The RP-GG&lt;/a&gt;, which can be fired at enemy vehicles.\nEngineers have access to two schematics for explosives that deal siege damage to vehicles, walls, and towers. Goblin Engineers and Gnome Engineers can both learn to make and use &lt;a href=\"Saronite%20Bomb\"&gt;Saronite Bomb&lt;/a&gt; at 405 Engineering, and Goblin Engineers can learn to make and use &lt;a href=\"Global%20Thermal%20Sapper%20Charge\"&gt;Global Thermal Sapper Charge&lt;/a&gt; at 425 Engineering.\nVehicles.\nThe defining feature of Wintergrasp is the use of vehicles to assault buildings and towers.\nIn order to create vehicles in Wintergrasp, you must attain a rank of Corporal or better during a Wintergrasp match by killing enemy players or NPC guards. Once a vehicle has been created, any player can pilot or operate a turret on one. Vehicles are created at Goblin Workshops under your faction's control. These factories can be captured by the opposing team.\nCatapults are capable of throwing plague barrels along ballistic trajectories which cause small amounts of AoE damage to players, vehicles, and structures. They also can create a flame jet which does a cone damage in the front of the catapult to enemy players and enemy vehicles, but not buildings.\nDemolishers are capable of throwing burning boulders along a ballistic trajectory which cause medium amounts of damage to players, vehicles, and structures. They also can ram which does cone damage in front of them, and is particularly damaging to structures. Passengers are vulnerable to attack in the Demolisher but can cast offensive and defensive spells.\nSiege Engines are capable of ramming which also does cone damage in front of them and is the highest damage to structures available. They also have a cannon that can shoot boulders which do high damage along a ballistic path; the cannon requires a second player to operate. Passengers are protected from harm but cannot attack or cast spells.\nA beta version of \"Wrath of the Lich King\" included a &lt;a href=\"shredder\"&gt;shredder&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Flying%20machine\"&gt;fighter&lt;/a&gt; (one seat flying vehicle), and a &lt;a href=\"bomber\"&gt;bomber&lt;/a&gt; (two seat flier), but these were dropped before release.\nStrategy.\nWintergrasp is a classic \"assault\"-style gameplay. The objective of the attackers is to capture the keep before time runs out. The objective of the defenders is to keep them from doing so. Should the attackers capture the keep, the battle ends immediately and they gain control.\nThe objective in Wintergrasp is a large orange sphere located inside the keep itself. The Orb is instantly clickable (as of Patch 3.0.8). If this is done successfully, the attackers win.\nTo reach the relic, three levels of walls must be breached. First, the outer perimeter of the keep must be breached. This can be done in any of three different courtyards. The front courtyard is empty, other than NPCs, and the east and west courtyard contain Goblin Workshops for the defenders. The inner keep walls then must be breached which leads to a courtyard with higher-level NPC defenders. The final barrier is the door to the keep itself. Once that is down, the attackers have access to the relic inside.\nGoblin Workshops.\nThe defenders have two Goblin workshops that cannot be captured, located in the keep itself; portals nearby teleport vehicles right outside the wall directly in front of the workshop they spawned at.\nCurrently (3.2), attackers are not given Goblin Workshops that cannot be captured. The southern workshops are vulnerable to assault leading to attackers having zero allowed vehicles with defense access to 24. Obviously, this scenario leads to almost certain victory for the defending side. The workshops inside the keep cannot be captured by the attackers.\nTwo other Goblin Workshops are located nearer to the keep. They start out under the control of the defenders, but the attackers can capture them. Capturing is done in a manner similar to the towers in &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20the%20Storm\"&gt;Eye of the Storm&lt;/a&gt;; the side with more players near the workshop will eventually capture it. Holding these workshops has the dual advantage of allowing vehicles to be built closer to the keep and increasing the total number of vehicles a side is allowed to control. Workshops cannot be destroyed.\nTowers.\nThe keep has four towers as part of its design, at the corners of walls. The attackers have three towers at the southern end of the map. For each of the attacking team's towers that the defenders manage to destroy, the defenders will be rewarded with bonus honor.\nTowers feature defensive turrets which players can use to fire at enemy players and vehicles. These towers do high AoE damage (up to 5000 for a well-aimed shot) and fire quite quickly, thus are quite useful in defense. Turrets can be destroyed with vehicles or by being directly attacked by players; they respawn after some time.\nAs of &lt;a href=\"patch%203.0.8\"&gt;patch 3.0.8&lt;/a&gt;, each of the attacking team's towers provide a Tower Control buff, which is a 5% bonus to damage; this buff can stack up to 3 times for a maximum 15% bonus. If the defenders destroy a tower, that tower's bonus will be transferred to the defending team. This is intended to assist the attacking team in taking the keep, and provide a reason for defenders to leave the protection of the keep during a siege.\nIf all three towers are destroyed the duration of the battle is shortened by 10 minutes (as of Patch 3.3). If the game has less than 10 minutes left on the clock, this ends the battle. As the game starts with a 30 minute countdown, this could mean the difference between defeat or victory.\nVehicles.\nThe primary purpose of vehicles is to attack structures such walls, towers, and Goblin Workshops; they can also be used to attack other vehicles. Vehicles have a large amount of health, but are not particularly armored and thus are vulnerable to basic infantry attack. A player doing a concerted attack on a vehicle can often destroy it quicker than the same player attacking from another vehicle.\nAttacker basic strategy.\nIf you are on offense, your first goal is to take the factories near to the keep. If you have to buy vehicles from the factories in the south, it will take a very long time to reach the keep (vehicles move around regular character running speed). Once you have one or both factories, you want to concentrate on breaching the outer wall. You also may wish to fire at the cannons on the wall, as they will do a lot of damage to your vehicle if well aimed. Once you begin to have higher rank players, you should split forces between attacking the keep and attacking players. Siege Engines are the most useful against the keep, and demolishers as well. If you are using a catapult, focus on enemy players and NPCs to try and keep them off your heavier vehicles. Also you can ride along on the vehicles and if they fall under attack, hop off and kill the attacker.\nOnce the inner keep is breached, all focus needs to go to the relic. Get in there and take it. AoE fears and such to get rid of defenders are useful in here. It is just like a base capture situation in &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Basin\"&gt;Arathi Basin&lt;/a&gt;.\nDefender basic strategy.\nAs defenders you need to divide your forces. It is tempting to simply sit in the keep and repel attackers from behind the walls but this is almost certainly doomed to failure. The keep walls aren't that sturdy so even with a heavy defense, you are likely to get breached. Part of the force should stay in the keep and defend it, in particular by manning cannons, the others should go out and assault. If you can keep the attackers from capturing and holding the nearby vehicle factories, you gain a huge strategic advantage. They either need to spend a lot of forces capturing them, or drive vehicles up from the south which is slow.\nWhen you get rank 1 or 2 it can be useful to get a vehicle and try to strike at the attackers' towers. When the towers are destroyed not only does it transfer their buff to the defending team, but when all 3 towers fall the attackers lose 15 minutes off the time they have to take the keep.\nIf the attackers have breached the inner courtyard, shift forces to keep them off the keep's door while still attempting to take down the south towers if not already done. While generally running around attacking anything that can be targeted in this relatively small area is easy, grouping everyone at the courtyard entrance with healers surrounding the group away from the attackers can not only keep them out of the courtyard, but can potentially push them back out, depending on how many vehicles they're utilizing. The &lt;a href=\"Titan%20Relic\"&gt;Titan Relic&lt;/a&gt; is instantly clickable, so once the keep's door is breached, your loss is imminent.\nQuickly changing graveyards.\nAn important tactic for both Defenders and Attackers is to quickly get to the key battle point (southern towers, inner keep). Dead players who are waiting for the Spirit Healer to bring them back can ask the &lt;a href=\"spirit%20healer\"&gt;spirit healer&lt;/a&gt; to have their ghost transferred to any other graveyard currently in control of their own team. Efficient use of Graveyard teleporting can help save areas in danger of being overrun.\nTeam balance and tenacity.\nBeing a world PvP zone, it is possible to have grossly unbalanced teams in a Wintergrasp match. This is addressed by granting the smaller team a buff called &lt;a href=\"Tenacity%20%28Wintergrasp%29\"&gt;Tenacity&lt;/a&gt;. The greater the difference in the number of players, the more stacks of Tenacity the smaller team gets. Tenacity also applies to vehicles the team controls. However, vehicles only get a health increase with tenacity not a damage bonus.\nIf you have Tenacity, use it to your advantage; you and your vehicles are more powerful than normal. Acting as basic infantry and attacking enemy vehicles will lead to it being destroyed very quickly. Deploying siege engines while your team has Tenacity will allow you to batter walls down quickly.\nIf you are facing a team with Tenacity, you want to avoid direct conflict with enemy players when possible. Use your numbers to your advantage and focus fire; it will take multiple people to take enemy players and vehicles out.\nTenacity also affects the number of kills needed to advance rank. In extreme situations a single kill can advance a player from Recruit to First Lieutenant allowing the side to begin building siege vehicles from the very beginning of the battle.\nTenacity does not appear to have any effect on the capturing Goblin Workshops. A team that is significantly outnumbered may be able to survive longer and damage harder, but will still lose a workshop due to overwhelming numbers of the opposition.\nAs of March 14, 2009, \"Only players level 70 or higher can count towards the tenacity tally or obtain the tenacity buff and get credit for victory or defeat. In addition, only players level 50 or higher will be able to use the portal to Wintergrasp.\"\nAs of November 16, 2010, Tenacity is no longer applied to players during the battle. This is due to &lt;a href=\"Patch%204.0.3\"&gt;Patch 4.0.3&lt;/a&gt; and the implementation of a population balancing system that calculates on a 1:1 ratio. As an example, if there are 10 Alliance players in Wintergrasp during the battle, there will also be 10 Horde players.\nWintergrasp and PvE.\nControl of Wintergrasp affects non-PvP play as well.\nInstances and raids.\nWhen a faction controls Wintergrasp, bosses in Northrend will drop a &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Keeper%27s%20Shard\"&gt;Stone Keeper's Shard&lt;/a&gt; for that faction only. These are used to buy certain PvP gear and Jewelcrafting recipes. The controlling faction will also have access to a raid instance, the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20Archavon\"&gt;Vault of Archavon&lt;/a&gt;, within the fortress of Wintergrasp. Like other raid instances, the vault is available in both twenty-five player and ten player versions on separate raid lockouts.\nCrafting resources.\nWintergrasp has the regular mineral nodes and herbs found in Northrend, but is also a prime source of crystallized elements. Elementals of all types can be found in Wintergrasp, which have a chance of dropping their respective crystallized element. More powerful elemental revenants exist that have a guaranteed droprate of 1 element and as many as 3 elements per mob. Revenants are visible only to the side that is currently in control of Wintergrasp. &lt;a href=\"Mature%20Lasher\"&gt;Mature Lasher&lt;/a&gt;s are the life element's revenant equivalent.\nAlthough &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Lotus\"&gt;Frost Lotus&lt;/a&gt; can be collected from other &lt;a href=\"Herbalism\"&gt;Herbalism&lt;/a&gt; nodes such as &lt;a href=\"Icethorn\"&gt;Icethorn&lt;/a&gt;, Wintergrasp is the only zone that has Frost Lotus nodes.\n&lt;a href=\"Cinder%20Cloud\"&gt;Cinder Cloud&lt;/a&gt;s can be found in the &lt;a href=\"Cauldron%20of%20Flames\"&gt;Cauldron of Flames&lt;/a&gt;."}

Quests are available from &lt;a href=\"Rivern%20Frostwind\"&gt;Rivern Frostwind&lt;/a&gt; who is located at the top of &lt;a href=\"Frostsaber%20Rock\"&gt;Frostsaber Rock&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Winterspring\"&gt;Winterspring&lt;/a&gt;. \nQuests.\nTwo quests can be attained at level 58, a third one is attainable at level 60, and a fourth quest gives access to a daily quest. There is no reduced reputation from turning in these quests when they are grey (as with all reputation gains since patch 3.0.8).\nHistorical.\nThe existence of the Wintersaber Trainers used to be a cause for complaints for many players on the Horde side, seeing as there was no Horde counterpart for the Trainers and their mount. However, as of &lt;a href=\"Patch%203.2\"&gt;Patch 3.2&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Ravasaur\"&gt;Ravasaur&lt;/a&gt; trainers in Un'Goro provide a horde equivalent via &lt;a href=\"They%20Grow%20Up%20So%20Fast%20%28Horde%29\"&gt;They Grow Up So Fast (Horde)&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe old system had players paying to obtain the epic mount &lt;a href=\"Reins%20of%20the%20Winterspring%20Frostsaber\"&gt;Reins of the Winterspring Frostsaber&lt;/a&gt; after reaching Exalted, but this is now obtained through the quest &lt;a href=\"They%20Grow%20Up%20So%20Fast%20%28Alliance%29\"&gt;They Grow Up So Fast (Alliance)&lt;/a&gt; requiring 20 days worth of quests to complete. Players who already unlocked the mount the old way can still purchase the mount at any time.\nReputation.\nPlayers start at with Wintersaber Trainers. Pay attention to the bottom quest - it gets you max rep when completed (so pretty much, don't bother with the rest!)\nStrategy.\nBefore &lt;a href=\"The%20Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;The Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt; was released, the first two available &lt;a href=\"quests\"&gt;quests&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Frostsaber%20Provisions\"&gt;Frostsaber Provisions&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Winterfall%20Intrusion\"&gt;Winterfall Intrusion&lt;/a&gt;) only gave 50 reputation each, and &lt;a href=\"Rampaging%20Giants\"&gt;Rampaging Giants&lt;/a&gt; gave 75 reputation. That meant that you were to complete a total of 840 quests (746 if you included the &lt;a href=\"Rampaging%20Giants\"&gt;Rampaging Giants&lt;/a&gt; quest in each round) before you could buy this &lt;a href=\"mount\"&gt;mount&lt;/a&gt;; note that at level 60 the mobs were a lot harder to kill than at level 70 or 80. With the release of the expansion the reputation gain increased from 50 rep per quest to 75, and 100 for &lt;a href=\"Rampaging%20Giants\"&gt;Rampaging Giants&lt;/a&gt;, lowering the number of quest turn-ins to 560 (or 546 with the giants) to reach &lt;a href=\"Exalted\"&gt;Exalted&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Patch%202.3\"&gt;Patch 2.3&lt;/a&gt; increased the reputation gained with many pre-Outland factions, including the Wintersaber Trainers, boosting the first two quests to 250 reputation each and &lt;a href=\"Rampaging%20Giants\"&gt;Rampaging Giants&lt;/a&gt; to 350 reputation. This lowers the number of turn-ins to 168 (153 with the giants), making this mount far more obtainable.\nNeutral: 0/3000 to 1500/3000.\nOnly one repeatable quest will be available at first, so until 1500/3000 is reached the &lt;a href=\"Frostsaber%20Provisions\"&gt;Frostsaber Provisions&lt;/a&gt; quest should be repeated. Any Shardtooth and Chillwind mob in Winterspring will drop these when you have the quest, but not otherwise. As of patch 4.0.3a, it appears as if there is a 100% drop rate on Shardtooth and Chillwind provisions, although the drop rate used to be quite low. It will take 6 completions (6 also for Humans, putting you at 1650/3000 Neutral) for this part, requiring 30 of each meat.\nNeutral 1500/3000 to Honored.\nHalfway through neutral the &lt;a href=\"Winterfall%20Intrusion\"&gt;Winterfall Intrusion&lt;/a&gt; quest will be available. This quest requires to kill 10 Winterfall mobs in the &lt;a href=\"Winterfall%20Village\"&gt;Winterfall Village&lt;/a&gt;, just east of &lt;a href=\"Everlook\"&gt;Everlook&lt;/a&gt;. If the quest &lt;a href=\"Winterfall%20Activity\"&gt;Winterfall Activity&lt;/a&gt; has been done with the &lt;a href=\"Timbermaw%20Hold%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Timbermaw Hold&lt;/a&gt;, can drop from the Winterfall mobs. If a player wants both reputations, saving the beads until with Timbermaw Hold will result in a lot of \"free\" reputation from killing the mobs.\nThis quest can be done in groups for increased speed. Players grinding either Wintersaber Trainers or Timbermaw Hold reputation can often be found in the Winterfall Village. Even with an epic mount, the travel to and from Winterfall Village takes up much time. There are tigers among the route who may daze you, which will result in a dismount, this should be avoided (but can be hard as they'll catch up with you on a 60% mount). Usually this quest is repeated all the way to , ignoring the third quest.\nThere are fewer Shamans than Ursas in Winterfall Village. If you kill the Ursas and Denwatchers in the village, Shamans may spawn to replace them. There are about six Ursas and an occasional Shaman up on the hills behind the village. There is also a Shaman that spawns outside the village entrance and one in the cave with Chief Winterfall.\nIf you don't want to have to run all the way to the quest giver and back so much, picking up both the Frostsaber Provisions and Winterfall Intrusion quests simultaneously can save some time. Though Frostsaber Provisions takes longer, it saves a ton of traveling time per turn-in since you can go from quest giver to Winterfall Village for one and on the way back just head north to do Provisions, completing 2 quests per travel. It will take 15 turn-ins. (14 for Humans, putting you at 350/12000 Honored)\nSomething else that will save you some time is setting your Hearthstone to Everlook when doing the quest &lt;a href=\"Winterfall%20Activity\"&gt;Winterfall Activity&lt;/a&gt;. This will enable you to hearthstone down, kill the furbolgs and collect the meat on the way back to the trainer. When the hearthstone is on cooldown, you can just run and collect the meat on your way down to Winterfall Village. If you don't get enough meat on the way down, just gather them on your way back.\nHonored to Exalted.\nAt the third quest &lt;a href=\"Rampaging%20Giants\"&gt;Rampaging Giants&lt;/a&gt; is available. The quest requires the player to kill 4 Frostmaul giants and 4 Frostmaul Preservers. They are a lot harder than the Winterfall mobs and the travel lengths are quite longer. This quest is usually skipped, and instead Winterfall Intrusion is repeated. If you can handle the Frostmaul giants, it can be efficient to do both the Rampaging Giants quest and Winterfall Intrusion quest together. This cuts the number of trips back to Frostsaber Rock by more than half given that the Rampaging Giants quest gives 100 more rep than the Winterfall quest. This will take 40 turn-ins, or 66 turn-ins if you don't take the third quest. (35 and 60 for Humans, respectively)\nDue to some players grinding Timbermaw Hold reputation and doing several quests in Winterfall Village, this quest can indeed turn out to be a faster reputation reward than the Winterfall Intrusion one. Often it may be hard to find enough of one of the two types of Frostmaul required. If you kill the abundant kind, more of the other kind will usually spawn.\nThere are about two dozen Shardtooth bears on the Hyjal side of the bridge, making that part of the Provisions quest easier.\nChanges since Cataclysm.\nThis faction has changed dramatically since Cataclysm, making this grind much more accessible. Players are required to complete an introductory quest, and then complete another quest that awards the mount. The mount quest requires some gold, materials, as well as 20 items that can only be obtained from a Winterspring daily quest. Each daily quest awards a significant amount of reputation as well, so players will reach Exalted by the time they are ready to get their mount. All other quests that used to grant faction rep have been removed."}

The second rule\"...\nThe Brawler's Guild is an organization that arranges one on one battles between willing combatants, captured monsters, and other participants in gladiatorial combat. Being a &lt;a href=\"neutral\"&gt;neutral&lt;/a&gt; organization, members of the Horde and Alliance are both allowed to enter, rising through the Brawler's Guild ranks with more wins. Prizes are awarded at higher ranks. The fights are all solo &lt;a href=\"PvE\"&gt;PvE&lt;/a&gt; matches in which the players must adapt and use different strategies depending on which opponent they are currently facing, making the Brawler's Guild one of the most challenging PvE activities a player can attempt on their own.\nThe announcer will change between &lt;a href=\"Bizmo\"&gt;Bizmo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Boss%20Bazzelflange\"&gt;Boss Bazzelflange&lt;/a&gt; according to the location (respectively &lt;a href=\"Bizmo%27s%20Brawlpub\"&gt;Bizmo's Brawlpub&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Brawl%27gar%20Arena\"&gt;Brawl'gar Arena&lt;/a&gt;).\nEntry.\nOn 27 November, patch 5.1 and the Brawler's Guild went live, and &lt;a href=\"Community%20Manager\"&gt;Community Manager&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Nethaera\"&gt;Nethaera&lt;/a&gt; again confirmed how invites will be obtained. \"\"Entry into the brawler\u2019s guild is by invitation only. Invitations can be found on the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Market%20Auction%20House\"&gt;Black Market Auction House&lt;/a&gt;, by invitation from somebody within the guild, and occasionally as drops from certain Horde and Alliance NPCs.\"\" \nThe &lt;a href=\"Blood-Soaked%20Invitation\"&gt;Blood-Soaked Invitation&lt;/a&gt;, which is &lt;a href=\"Bind%20on%20Pickup\"&gt;Bind on Pickup&lt;/a&gt;, can be found when you complete \"&lt;a href=\"Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt;\" dungeons or open Emissary chests.\nUpon reaching Rank 7 with &lt;a href=\"Bizmo%27s%20Brawlpub\"&gt;Bizmo's Brawlpub&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Brawl%27gar%20Arena\"&gt;Brawl'gar Arena&lt;/a&gt; players will receive one in the mail. The pass can be traded and sold on the Auction House to other players and is the only other means to gain access to the Brawler's Guild.\nUsing either invite, the \"account\" is flagged to join the Brawler's Guild, giving all characters on a player's account access to the guild. Future expansions will not get rid of this membership. Once you're in, you're in for life!\nA nice little bonus is that once you reach rank 8, this gives you the right to go into the area for VIPs only.\nStarting fights.\nTo join the queue, speak with any bouncer at &lt;a href=\"Bizmo%27s%20Brawlpub\"&gt;Bizmo's Brawlpub&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Deeprun%20Tram\"&gt;Deeprun Tram&lt;/a&gt; for the Alliance, or &lt;a href=\"Brawl%27gar%20Arena\"&gt;Brawl'gar Arena&lt;/a&gt; for the Horde:\nSpeak to any bouncer or look at the Queued for Brawl buff tooltip to see your spot in line. Then, wait until the queue pops - a boss emote will display warning that the next turn is the adventurer's:\nThere will be no warning upon getting teleported to the arena floor. The fight lasts two minutes before the arena itself will kill adventurers who take too long.\nQueue system.\nThe queue system is built on a first come, first serve basis, with one exception: you will be placed one spot behind for your first fight for the day (current fight, next fight, and your fight). This rule is applied to all your eligible characters individually, not to your account.\nAfter the match.\nWinners will receive a &lt;a href=\"Brawler%27s%20Purse\"&gt;Brawler's Purse&lt;/a&gt; and 250 reputation with the Brawler's Guild.\nLosers will have to be resurrected.\nGladiators.\nNormally, challengers will only fight the next higher-ranked gladiator until it is defeated or the challenger throws in the towel, but the addition of &lt;a href=\"Challenge%20Card\"&gt;Challenge Card&lt;/a&gt;s gives challengers the opportunity to relive earlier fights. For the ranked fights, defeating a gladiator will unlock that gladiator's challenge card. There are also rare challenge cards, unlocked upon gaining higher ranks and completing quests that are started by items found in the world.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nSeason 4=\nHiatus.\nThe Brawler's Guild was on hiatus since the launch of &lt;a href=\"Patch%208.0\"&gt;Patch 8.0&lt;/a&gt; in preparation for \"the next big thing\".\nSeason 3=\n&lt;a href=\"Patch%207.1.5\"&gt;Patch 7.1.5&lt;/a&gt; sees the return of the Brawler's Guild, with new challenges and rewards. \nHiatus.\nThe Brawler's Guild was on hiatus between the launch of &lt;a href=\"Patch%207.0.3\"&gt;Patch 7.0.3&lt;/a&gt; before \"&lt;a href=\"Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt;\" in preparation \"for the next big thing\". The guild returned in &lt;a href=\"Patch%207.1.5\"&gt;Patch 7.1.5&lt;/a&gt;.\nSeason 2=\nAs part of keeping the Brawler's Guild fresh, &lt;a href=\"Patch%206.0.2\"&gt;Patch 6.0.2&lt;/a&gt; retuned the fights for level 100 players, putting an end to the first season of fights. When players reach level 100 they will find that their ranks have been reset to one and the fights have been changed around, with some bosses going away from the rank rotation completely and becoming &lt;a href=\"Challenge%20Card\"&gt;Challenge Card&lt;/a&gt; fights, making a max of eight ranks again. For example, &lt;a href=\"Bruce\"&gt;Bruce&lt;/a&gt; will now be a Rank 5 fight and &lt;a href=\"Hexos\"&gt;Hexos&lt;/a&gt; is removed. Players will also find new achievements for reaching the higher ranks again, the old ones being moved to the new &lt;a href=\"Legacy%20achievements\"&gt;Legacy achievements&lt;/a&gt; tab.\nLegacy fights are those that were part of Season 1, but were removed and made available only through challenge cards.\nSeason 1=\nBelow is a list of the fights in the first season of the Brawler's Guild that was for level 90 players during &lt;a href=\"Mists%20of%20Pandaria\"&gt;Mists of Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nFormer quests.\nAll of these quests and sources were removed in &lt;a href=\"Patch%207.0.3\"&gt;Patch 7.0.3&lt;/a&gt;.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

They are good people trying to do right by each other, notably by working the farms again and to get proper homes built for folks. With the support of &lt;a href=\"Cecilia%20Clessington\"&gt;Countess Cecilia Clessington&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Nobles\"&gt;House of Nobles&lt;/a&gt;, their guild was formalized to request support from the kingdom, and soon they will hold a vote to decide who should be at the helm. They use the &lt;a href=\"Saldean%27s%20Farm\"&gt;Saldean's Farm&lt;/a&gt; as their headquarters.\nHistory.\nFollowing their victory against &lt;a href=\"Count%20Clessington\"&gt;Count Clessington&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Northshire%20Valley\"&gt;Northshire Valley&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vanessa%20VanCleef\"&gt;Vanessa VanCleef&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cecilia%20Clessington\"&gt;Cecilia Clessington&lt;/a&gt; traveled to &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt; and met with the locals at the &lt;a href=\"Saldean%27s%20Farm\"&gt;Saldean's Farm&lt;/a&gt;. In order to revitalize Westfall, the farmers and workers united to form the Breadbasket Guild, an official organization with the support of Cecilia, who succeeded her late father in the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Nobles\"&gt;House of Nobles&lt;/a&gt;. While some leaders were receptive when they bargained for support, some nobles were opposed, most being those who escaped the arrests for corruption ordered by &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;.\nFor Vanessa and Cecilia, the Breadbasket Guild was a first step towards real changes in the Stormwind society, not only by uniting the voices of the people to bring a message to the leaders of the kingdom, but also to make things evolve from inside the House of Nobles. Their long-term goal being to gradually transform the House of Nobles into the \"House of the People\". Among the nobles interested in their project, &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Joran%20Tremaind\"&gt;Lord Joran Tremaind&lt;/a&gt; began to support the Breadbasket Guild, as his noble family once had a hand in the farmlands of Westfall and never would have gotten far in their affairs at &lt;a href=\"Eastvale%20Logging%20Camp\"&gt;Eastvale Logging Camp&lt;/a&gt; without the help of the good farmers.\nHowever, Vanessa refused to join the guild as an official member, as she is still a criminal in the eyes of the law, but also because her name would discredit their cause. She therefore participated in the shadows to plan and organize the actions of the guild. According to her, many corrupt nobles appeared favorable to the actions of the guild but will soon prepare their agents in the shadows to put an end to it, refusing to let the people of Westfall have power. The former Kingpin of the Defias then announced that she was there to protect the farmers from their enemies."}

Shoveltusk have been described as being \"&lt;a href=\"moose\"&gt;moose&lt;/a&gt;-like\" or as a cross between a &lt;a href=\"boar\"&gt;boar&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"stag\"&gt;stag&lt;/a&gt;.\nSometimes one can see two stags in a fight, ramming into each other with their horns. It is also not uncommon to see &lt;a href=\"worg\"&gt;worg&lt;/a&gt;s run up to and slaughter them.\nBackground.\nThe powerful and ferocious shoveltusk are easily identified by the massive curved antler which protrudes from their heads and the twin sloping tusks that extend from their jaw. The moose-like beasts use their tusks primarily to dig for food, whereas the antler makes for a fearsome ramming weapon in contests to establish dominance over other males. The shoveltusk are territorial and will protect their feeding grounds with deadly force.

But all is not as it seems as mysterious outside forces continue to hatch a plan of disruption. Could someone possibly be secretly aligned with the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;?\nPlot.\nAs the Twilight's Hammer's attack on the Theramore peace summit continues, Garona swoops towards &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian&lt;/a&gt; on her &lt;a href=\"wyvern\"&gt;wyvern&lt;/a&gt; and throws a dagger at him. However, the king grabs the blade in mid-air and uses it to kill Garona's wyvern, forcing her down on the ground. The battle becomes more chaotic as even more cultists arrive, but Varian is focused only on killing Garona, who gloats that she'll slay the king the same way she slew &lt;a href=\"Llane%20Wrynn%20I\"&gt;his father&lt;/a&gt;. Internally, Garona scolds herself for making cheap talk and realizes that making two mistakes in a single mission isn't like her, remarking that it's as if she's fighting herself as well as Varian.\nWhile &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; battles an &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin&lt;/a&gt; picks up a pistol from a dead &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; but is knocked back by the recoil when he tries to fire it. &lt;a href=\"Stasia%20Fallshadow\"&gt;Stasia&lt;/a&gt; aims a fireball at him and &lt;a href=\"Valeera%20Sanguinar\"&gt;Valeera&lt;/a&gt;, but they're saved when &lt;a href=\"Rehgar%20Earthfury\"&gt;Rehgar&lt;/a&gt; steps in and &lt;a href=\"Earth%20Shield\"&gt;shields them with earth&lt;/a&gt;. Rehgar comments that Valeera's skill has grown since he last saw her fight and tells her to teach Anduin to throw blades, since guns are unreliable.\n&lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina&lt;/a&gt; teleports into the fray and shields Thrall from another of Stasia's fire blasts. She tells him to confront the other attackers while she deals with \"the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; witch\". Meanwhile, Varian continues dueling Garona, who thinks to herself that the king fights like two men. High above the battle, &lt;a href=\"Med%27an\"&gt;Med'an&lt;/a&gt; arrives on &lt;a href=\"Snubnose\"&gt;Snubnose&lt;/a&gt;. When he spots his mother's situation, he calls down lightning to push her and Varian apart and jumps down on the ground to talk to her. Garona is distraught by the sight of her son and tells him to stay away.\nElsewhere, an &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; attack Valeera and Anduin. Valeera tells the prince to run, but Anduin is saved when Med'an jumps in to kill the orc with his axe. He explains that the attackers are his mother's foes as much as they are Anduin's. From above, Stasia spots Med'an and realizes that all of the Twilight's Hammer's plans will be foiled if the boy dies in the battle. She yells at the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Fanghorn\"&gt;Fanghorn&lt;/a&gt; to spare him. While Med'an is fighting Fanghorn, he hears his mother's voice and tries to turn around and tell her not to trust Stasia, but the tauren seizes the opportunity to slice him across the back. Stasia realizes that the cultists are losing the fight and that Med'an's presence threatens their entire plan. She decides to cut their losses and paralyze Garona to let Varian kill her while she takes the boy.\nStasia utters the control word, causing the &lt;a href=\"half-orc\"&gt;half-orc&lt;/a&gt; to freeze while Varian is charging at her. Med'an gets to his feet, kills Fanghorn, and leaps at Varian to stop him. However, the king easily throws the boy aside. Anduin tells his father that Med'an saved his life, but the king merely replies that he's not a child killer but could make an exception for \"Garona's cub\". Stasia grabs hold of Med'an, uses a spell to turn him unconscious, and then flies away with the other surviving cultists, leaving Garona behind.\n&lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh&lt;/a&gt; charges at the assassin to kill her, but Jaina freezes him in his tracks and declares that as she is the ruler of Theramore, the half-orc is her prisoner and will be taken to the dungeon for questioning. Varian accuses the orcs of sending Garona, enraging Garrosh, but Thrall tells the &lt;a href=\"mag%27har%20orc\"&gt;mag'har&lt;/a&gt; to lower his weapon and reminds Varian that the Horde were attacked as well. Varian, Thrall, and Garrosh continue to argue until the king heads to the dungeon to question the prisoner himself. Rehgar, Valeera, and Anduin agree that neither Thrall, Varian, nor Jaina would orchestrate such an attack. Thrall and Rehgar speculate that the attack could be the work of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, a returned &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Blade%20clan\"&gt;Burning Blade&lt;/a&gt;, or even the Twilight's Hammer.\nIn the dungeon, Varian tries to interrogate Garona, who is distant and unable to answer his questions. Jaina reminds him that the half-orc is her prisoner and that the king of all people should know what it's like to be magically enslaved. Varian tells Jaina to learn what she can from the prisoner while he faces the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, but afterwards he will claim for execution.\nOutside, Jaina talks to Thrall as he prepares to return to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; and warns him to keep an eye on Garrosh. Thrall boards his &lt;a href=\"zeppelin\"&gt;zeppelin&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"sorcerer\"&gt;sorceress&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"warchief\"&gt;warchief&lt;/a&gt; bid each other farewell, both sorry that the chance of an orc-human alliance has been ruined.\nWhile teaching Anduin to throw daggers, Valeera sees a group of Theramore guards transporting Garona. One of the guards comments that Valeera, being a &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elf&lt;/a&gt;, was likely in league with the Horde among the attackers. Valeera responds by throwing a dagger through the haft of the guard's spear and telling him to keep his nose out of her business and that her loyalties are personal. Garona approaches Valeera and tells her that she will risk her life to fight her ensorcellment if they save Med'an from his kidnappers.\nA short time later, Valeera relays this information to Varian and states that she wants to stay in Theramore to search for Garona's son. Anduin tells his father that Med'an wasn't on the attackers' side during the battle, and the two boys might have been friends if they had met under different circumstances. Varian replies that he still thinks that orcs, possibly Garrosh, are behind the attack. As he and Anduin board the ship back to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, the king tells Jaina that he has been attacked near a Theramore peace summit twice and will not return for a third parley. He will, however, come back for his father's murderer, and declares that no one will save Garona from the punishment she deserves."}

Killing this boss is required to access the rest of the raid. Shriekwing is a massive bestial and blind &lt;a href=\"stoneborn\"&gt;stoneborn&lt;/a&gt; who fights with claws and sonic attacks.\nAs this fight is the first in the instance, it exists to test the raid's situational/environmental awareness, with mechanics that can punish the group for a single player's mistakes.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"Tasked with guarding Castle Nathria's entry hall, the blind monster Shriekwing locates her victims with horrifying cries that reverberate off the chamber's walls. The last sound heard by trespassers in the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Walk\"&gt;Grand Walk&lt;/a&gt; is the monster's cry as she descends upon her prey.\"\nOverview.\nShriekwing will unleash Earsplitting Shrieks as she gains blood over time. Upon reaching 100 blood Shriekwing becomes protected by Blood Shroud and fills the antechamber with Echoing Sonar.\nStrategy.\nShriekwing requires two tanks. Bloodlust can be used immediately as the boss' abilities are used on a timer, not tied to health. The raid should position the boss close to one or more of the 4 pillars located in the room, ready to move behind them to break line-of-sight.\nPhase 1: The boss hits tanks with Exsanguinating Bite, reducing their healing taken and applying a nasty Bleed. Tanks should swap immediately on being hit. For healers, the boss will use Wave of Blood, an unavoidable blast of shadow damage to everyone, which simply needs to be healed through. For DPS, Shriekwing will use Blind Swipe, facing towards a random DPS and channeling for a few seconds before cleaving in that direction. Simply move out of the way. In addition, healers and DPS can be targeted by Echolocation. When this 8-second long debuff expires, a bat will fly down to that player and create a pool of blood that hurts players that stand within it. Players affected by Echolocation must move to the edge of the room to keep the blood pools away from the raid. If someone with Echolocation fails to move from the group, the bat will create a blood pool for each player struck, forcing everyone to reposition.\nThe most deadly mechanic for Phase 1 is Earsplitting Shriek. After a 10 second cast, the boss will shriek and create blood pools underneath all players in line of sight, along with a huge dot. The raid must be positioned near a pillar during Phase 1 to break line of sight with the boss. If someone is too slow to react, they could potentially drop the blood right next to- or on-top of the pillar, effectively making that pillar worthless as a spot to hide as players will be standing in blood.\nPhase 2: After she reaches 100% energy, Shriekwing will teleport to the center of the room and become invulnerable for a time. The goal of this phase is simply to survive until the phase ends and Phase 1 begins once more. Shriekwing will start by casting Echoing Sonar, firing sonic circles in different directions, each bouncing off walls and objects. The players must dodge these circles or be hit by a dot and have a bat create a pool of blood at their location. In addition, they will be untauntable and move around the room, casting Earsplitting Shriek a total of 3 times throughout the phase. The difficulty comes in dodging both the Echoing Sonar circles and keeping line of sight broken with the pillars. Creating too many blood pools around the pillars in this phase can potentially lead to a wipe as there will no longer be any safe place to stand. A common mistake is to hug the pillars even if the area is swarming with Sonar circles, causing that pillar to become coated in blood and far more dangerous to stand near. It is perfectly safe to move around the room and dodge the circles when the boss is not casting Earsplitting Shriek. After the third Earsplitting Shriek, the boss becomes vulnerable to damage and Phase 1 begins again.\nRaids will typically cycle through two Phase 1s before killing the boss on the third, depending on the strength of the group's DPS. The fight is a matter of practicing getting behind the pillars quickly, keeping the area clear of blood, and practicing dodging the Echoing Sonar circles. Once the movement aspect is mastered, this boss should go down easily."}

{"id": "319146", "revid": "46457815", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=319146", "title": "Embrace", "text": "The Embrace is an extraordinary celestial event when &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s two &lt;a href=\"moon\"&gt;moon&lt;/a&gt;s \u2014 the &lt;a href=\"White%20Lady\"&gt;White Lady&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Child\"&gt;Blue Child&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 are in an extremely rare conjunction, happening approximately once every four hundred and thirty years. It is so named because it appears that the Mother is holding the Child.\nBackground.\nMythology.\nAccording to one Azerothian legend, Embraces occur when the Blue Child reunites with her mother after spending time away from Azeroth to explore the universe. The first time the Child left, the White Lady grew fearful and angry. She first showed this by turning her face away from the world to wait for her Child's return, causing chaos on Azeroth until the Lady's friends, the stars, suggested that the Child might be lost and would return if she saw her mother's light. The Lady returned to her old position in the sky, but eventually grew fearful again and started moving closer to Azeroth until she outshone the sun, depriving Azeroth of night and once again throwing the world into turmoil. The song of a &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; mother grieving for her dying child caused the Lady to realize that she was harming Azeroth's people, including other mothers who also loved their children, and so dimmed her light and retreated.\nAfter a very long time, the Blue Child suddenly returned and leaped into her mother's embrace. The joy this caused was greater than any seen in the skies before or since, and the two moons' combined light stretched across the sky \"like the love connecting all parents and children\". The Lady realized that by going off alone, the Child had grown into a person all her own, rather than simply being a mother's daughter. She also realized that the Child would one day grow restless and leave again, but that she would always return when she was ready. Thus, most people on Azeroth will never see the White Lady embrace the Blue Child, but when they do reunite, the sky is luminous with their joy.\nThe Dragon Aspects.\nAccording to legend, the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt; were first created during an occurrence of the Embrace.\nAs the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; debated how to appoint a new Aspect of Magic to replace &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt;, one popular theory espoused that this celestial event was important to that task. Some felt it was crucial to the proper working of the magic necessary to facilitate the alteration of a normal blue dragon into an Aspect. Others simply deemed it good timing. &lt;a href=\"Arygos\"&gt;Arygos&lt;/a&gt; argued that the ability to become an Aspect may be in the blood.\nIt turned out that neither bloodline nor intellect was important to the process. During the following Embrace, Arygos acted with brashness and arrogance, while Kalecgos simply beheld the beauty of the Embrace with the other dragons. The wonderment of the Embrace came from grace and rarity rather than the offering of dominance or power. Its light shone down on those gathered at the &lt;a href=\"Nexus\"&gt;Nexus&lt;/a&gt;, causing them to glow with magic. As the radiance faded from them, it intensified around &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt;, bestowing him with the powers of an Aspect. In the same vein as the name of the celestial phenomenon, the ritual was about the heart of the blue dragonflight and what they felt.\nSpeculation.\nNeither \"&lt;a href=\"Dawn%20of%20the%20Aspects\"&gt;Dawn of the Aspects&lt;/a&gt;\" nor \"&lt;a href=\"Chronicle%20Volume%201\"&gt;Chronicle Volume 1&lt;/a&gt;\" mention the Embrace event. The legend may be a part of the cover in which the Dragon Aspects decided to hide the truth about &lt;a href=\"Galakrond\"&gt;Galakrond&lt;/a&gt; and the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Aspects\"&gt;Aspects&lt;/a&gt;. However, the fact that Kalec did indeed get his Aspect powers during the Embrace may mean there is some truth to it, even if the detail was not mentioned in \"Dawn of the Aspects\" or \"Chronicle\"."}

After her death, her soul joined the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Constructs\"&gt;House of Constructs&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxus\"&gt;Maldraxxus&lt;/a&gt; and received a mighty &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxi%20abomination\"&gt;abomination&lt;/a&gt; body, designed by &lt;a href=\"Surgeon%20Stitchflesh\"&gt;Surgeon Stitchflesh&lt;/a&gt; and the stitchmaster &lt;a href=\"Rathan\"&gt;Rathan&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=\"Body%20Banks\"&gt;Body Banks&lt;/a&gt;. Dubbed the \"Slaughter Daughter\", Emeni became a legend feared throughout the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;. Her construct was of complex design and possessed a skin impervious to mortal weapons, described by the princess herself as \"a work of art that took years to perfect\".\nEmeni, Rathan, and many other members of the House of Constructs spoke out against &lt;a href=\"Margrave%20Gharmal\"&gt;Margrave Gharmal&lt;/a&gt; when they launched their attack on &lt;a href=\"Bastion\"&gt;Bastion&lt;/a&gt;. Fearing dissent, Gharmal removed Emeni and many other souls from their constructed bodies and imprisoned them in the &lt;a href=\"Etheric%20Vault\"&gt;Etheric Vault&lt;/a&gt;, leaving them to fade away from a lack of &lt;a href=\"anima\"&gt;anima&lt;/a&gt;. The skin of Emeni's construct was taken as a souvenir by the soul amputator &lt;a href=\"Faldo%20Iscar\"&gt;Faldo Iscar&lt;/a&gt;. While imprisoned, Emeni made a list of all the constructs that had betrayed her\u201458 in total, with number one being her fellow abomination &lt;a href=\"Yardmaster%20Pralak\"&gt;Yardmaster Pralak&lt;/a&gt;.\nDespite being reduced to a disembodied spirit, Emeni managed to escape the vault and sought out the &lt;a href=\"Necrolord%20Covenant\"&gt;Necrolord&lt;/a&gt; forces at the &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20the%20Primus\"&gt;Seat of the Primus&lt;/a&gt; alongside Rathan. Rathan promised that he and Emeni would build the necrolords an army of constructs far greater than Gharmal's if the &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Walker\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt; helped them reclaim the princess' body and rescue the other souls trapped in the vault. The trio traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Stitchyard\"&gt;Stitchyard&lt;/a&gt; and, after gathering the necessary tools from the nearby Construct forces, (including reclaiming Emeni's skin from Faldo Iscar) used the assembly equipment to build a new abomination for the Slaughter Daughter's soul to inhabit. Now once again possessing a physical body, Emeni had the Maw Walker help her slaughter all of the traitors on her list and rescue her friends from the Etheric Vault. She, Rathan, and the freed souls subsequently took up residence at &lt;a href=\"Butchers%20Block\"&gt;Butchers Block&lt;/a&gt; outside the Seat of the Primus, a place where they could construct more new bodies, and pledged their allegiance to &lt;a href=\"Draka\"&gt;Baroness Draka&lt;/a&gt; and her forces.\nEmeni participated in the joint &lt;a href=\"kyrian\"&gt;kyrian&lt;/a&gt; and necrolord attack on the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Constructs%20%28subzone%29\"&gt;Construct stronghold&lt;/a&gt;. She and &lt;a href=\"Alexandros%20Mograine\"&gt;Alexandros Mograine&lt;/a&gt; led the assault on the stronghold's western gate while &lt;a href=\"Xandria\"&gt;Xandria&lt;/a&gt; and the kyrian advanced from the east. At the &lt;a href=\"Stitchyard\"&gt;Stitchyard&lt;/a&gt;, Emeni tasked Maw Walkers with clearing the skies of Margrave Gharmal's &lt;a href=\"deathroc\"&gt;deathroc&lt;/a&gt;s by using her riding hook to latch onto them and beat them to a pulp in mid-air. She claimed that she would've taken care of the birds herself if it wasn't for the fact that her body wasn't constructed for flight.\nEmeni and some of her &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Steelskin\"&gt;fellow abominations&lt;/a&gt; participated in the necrolord assault on the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Rituals%20%28subzone%29\"&gt;House of Rituals&lt;/a&gt;. When it was discovered that the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Rituals\"&gt;Ritualists&lt;/a&gt; had barricaded the only available side route into the house, Emeni declared that the \"pitiful barriers\" were no obstacle for her and insisted that the attackers push forward. Her abominations subsequently helped the Maw Walkers break through the defenses and allow the attackers to push into the &lt;a href=\"Grimoirium\"&gt;Grimoirium&lt;/a&gt;.\nEmeni joined the united covenant assault on &lt;a href=\"Desmotaeron\"&gt;Desmotaeron&lt;/a&gt; and later returned to the Seat to witness Draka's promotion to margrave. She also visited &lt;a href=\"Keeper%27s%20Respite\"&gt;Keeper's Respite&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Korthia\"&gt;Korthia&lt;/a&gt; and was excited about all the new interesting things to kill there. She asked Maw Walkers to bring her some pointy new teeth from the local &lt;a href=\"gromit\"&gt;gromit&lt;/a&gt;s and help her set up a trap for the &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt; so she could collect their body parts.\nThe princess accompanied &lt;a href=\"Secutor%20Mevix\"&gt;Secutor Mevix&lt;/a&gt; and a detachment of necrolords to &lt;a href=\"Provis%20Esper\"&gt;Provis Esper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Zereth%20Mortis\"&gt;Zereth Mortis&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Pelagos\"&gt;Pelagos&lt;/a&gt; and a Maw Walker recruited these necrolords and the other covenant forces to help fight through the Mawsworn in the &lt;a href=\"Endless%20Sands\"&gt;Endless Sands&lt;/a&gt; and breach the &lt;a href=\"Crypts%20of%20the%20Eternal\"&gt;Crypts of the Eternal&lt;/a&gt; so they could create a new &lt;a href=\"Arbiter%20%28title%29\"&gt;Arbiter&lt;/a&gt;. At the &lt;a href=\"Deserted%20Overlook\"&gt;Deserted Overlook&lt;/a&gt;, Mevix asked the Maw Walker to kill two of the Mawsworn's &lt;a href=\"Automa%23Oracle\"&gt;oracles&lt;/a&gt; to prevent them from predicting the covenants' movements, and to bring Emeni along for the task since she was eager for battle.\nSoulbind traits.\n&lt;a href=\"Necrolord%20Covenant\"&gt;Necrolord Covenant&lt;/a&gt; members can &lt;a href=\"soulbind\"&gt;soulbind&lt;/a&gt; with Emeni after completing &lt;a href=\"Never%20Had%20a%20Friend%20Like%20Me\"&gt;Never Had a Friend Like Me&lt;/a&gt;."}

After participating in the fall of &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt;, he convened with his fellow warlocks of the Council. He was partnered with &lt;a href=\"Zinnin\"&gt;Zinnin Smythe&lt;/a&gt; to go back to &lt;a href=\"Sulfuron%20Keep\"&gt;Sulfuron Keep&lt;/a&gt; and gather the power left behind by the Firelord.\nBackground.\nRitssyn was once &lt;a href=\"Kira%20Iresoul\"&gt;Kira Iresoul&lt;/a&gt;'s mentor, but as she infiltrated the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20Wake\"&gt;Argus Wake&lt;/a&gt; cult, he abandoned her. Kira has resented him ever since and can not trust him anymore, convinced that Ritssyn is interested in only one thing, power.\nHe also worked with &lt;a href=\"Ernest%20Carlisle\"&gt;Mad Ernie&lt;/a&gt; in the past.\nRitssyn was greatly burned by the flames of Ragnaros, and has a permanent mane of fire.\u00a0His eyes glow and cast eerie shadows over his burn-scarred face and thick-tusked grin. &lt;a href=\"Jubeka%20Shadowbreaker\"&gt;Jubeka Shadowbreaker&lt;/a&gt; believed that Ritssyn was so powerful he could probably instantly annihilate &lt;a href=\"Kanrethad%20Ebonlocke\"&gt;Kanrethad Ebonlocke&lt;/a&gt;. However, he would not be able to combat all the Council members together.\nLegion.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for the Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, Ritssyn and the rest of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20the%20Black%20Harvest\"&gt;Council of the Black Harvest&lt;/a&gt; sought out &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;a powerful warlock&lt;/a&gt; to take place as the Sixth member of the Council, having since lost Kanrethad. They met in the &lt;a href=\"Dalaran%20Sewers\"&gt;sewers&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; to open a portal into the deepest parts of the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; and bind a powerful demon to their will in order to grow stronger against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Things went wrong as the powerful demon they managed to summon, &lt;a href=\"Jagganoth\"&gt;Jagganoth&lt;/a&gt;, overwhelmed the Council, killed &lt;a href=\"Zelifrax%20Wobblepox\"&gt;Zelifrax Wobblepox&lt;/a&gt;, and took the others captive on his personal world, &lt;a href=\"Dreadscar%20Rift\"&gt;Dreadscar Rift&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere, Ritssyn died from his wounds but was eventually resurrected some time later by the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Sixth&lt;/a&gt; of the Black Harvest after they managed to kill Jagganoth and take control of Dreadscar Rift. Ritssyn could hardly believe his eyes: for one warlock to control an entire army of demons was beyond what he thought the Council was capable of. They decided to track down and free the others in order to reform the Council of the Black Harvest to prepare for the dreadlord &lt;a href=\"Mephistroth\"&gt;Mephistroth&lt;/a&gt;'s retaliation, who was terribly enraged since he had lost one of his most powerful lieutenants, Jagganoth, and &lt;a href=\"Dreadscar%20Rift\"&gt;Dreadscar Rift&lt;/a&gt;. With\u00a0their members scattered and Mephistroth on their heels, Ritssyn claimed that they needed the Netherlord to take leadership of the Council, and named them the First of the Council of the Black Harvest.\nTo save the other members of the Council, they enlisted the aid of Ritsynn's ex-apprentice, &lt;a href=\"Kira%20Iresoul\"&gt;Kira Iresoul&lt;/a&gt; for her knowledge of demonic gateway. After helping her with her tasks, she accepted to fulfill her part of the bargain and aid in the opening of a powerful gateway to the world of &lt;a href=\"Niskara\"&gt;Niskara&lt;/a&gt; where the Council members were being held captive by Mephistroth.\nKira led the ritual of the gateway's summoning, during which Ritssyn acknowledged that her power had grown since the last time they met. The First crossed the portal and rescued their colleagues, except for &lt;a href=\"Shinfel%20Blightsworn\"&gt;Shinfel Blightsworn&lt;/a&gt; who was nowhere to be found. This was terrible news to the Council: if Mephistroth managed to break Shinfel, he would be able to mount a devastating attack against &lt;a href=\"Dreadscar%20Rift\"&gt;Dreadscar Rift&lt;/a&gt; armed with her power and knowledge.\nThe First and Ritssyn needed to gather the tools to perform a powerful enough ritual to summon Shinfel back to Dreadscar. In order to create the anchor needed for the ritual of summoning, they needed to link something of\u00a0Shinfel's to an unclaimed soul. The soul would act like a beacon, guiding Shinfel through the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; and back to Dreadscar Rift. Shinfel's staff provided them with the link they need, but the soul was a bit harder to find: the First had to slay the &lt;a href=\"Amalgam%20of%20Souls\"&gt;Amalgam of Souls&lt;/a&gt; within &lt;a href=\"Black%20Rook%20Hold\"&gt;Black Rook Hold&lt;/a&gt; to retrieve a powerful, lost and forgotten soul.\nCreating the anchor required more power than the Council members' soul shards were able to provide, so they sent the Dreadscar troops, which are capable of amassing a large amount of soul shards when they defeat enemies, gather more. Ritssyn then harvested the soul shard supply and used it to craft the anchor.\nRitssyn thus finally bound Shinfel's soul to her staff and he, alongside Kira and the First, proceeded and summoned Shinfel. But she was dizzy, and in pain: she had been afflicted with a Curse of Doom by the Eredar Twins, &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Sacrolash\"&gt;Lady Sacrolash&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Warlock%20Alythess\"&gt;Grand Warlock Alythess&lt;/a&gt;. \nSince only the caster of a curse could remove the curse entirely, the Council decided they had to summon the powerful Eredar Twins to force them to cure Shinfel. Having lost their master demonologist, &lt;a href=\"Zelifrax%20Wobblepox\"&gt;Zelifrax Wobblepox&lt;/a&gt;, they sought out one powerful enough to help in this task. They settled on Wilfred Fizzlebang's sister &lt;a href=\"Lulubelle%20Fizzlebang\"&gt;Lulubelle&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Council then summoned the Eredar Twins and managed to enslave them using &lt;a href=\"Bloodstone%20%28quest%20item%29\"&gt;Kira's Bloodstone&lt;/a&gt;, and forced them to cure Shinfel.\nHe participated in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Exodar\"&gt;Battle for the \"Exodar\"&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"High%20General%20Rakeesh\"&gt;High General Rakeesh&lt;/a&gt;, along with Calydus.\nLegionfall.\nRitssyn was one of the order hall champions who met &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Krasus%27%20Landing\"&gt;Krasus' Landing&lt;/a&gt; to discuss the &lt;a href=\"Pillars%20of%20Creation\"&gt;Pillars of Creation&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"Assault%20on%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;second invasion of the Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, Ritssyn provides a &lt;a href=\"%3ADemonic%20Gateway\"&gt;:Demonic Gateway&lt;/a&gt; to access the &lt;a href=\"Legion%20ship\"&gt;Legion ship&lt;/a&gt; where &lt;a href=\"Mephistroth\"&gt;Mephistroth&lt;/a&gt; resides. On &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Modera\"&gt;Archmage Modera&lt;/a&gt;'s request, he also helps to stop the summoning of a &lt;a href=\"succubus\"&gt;succubus&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Agatha%20%28demon%29\"&gt;Agatha&lt;/a&gt; in Dalaran.\nAftermath.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Magni\"&gt;Magni&lt;/a&gt; called upon the champions of the &lt;a href=\"Armies%20of%20Legionfall\"&gt;Armies of Legionfall&lt;/a&gt; to draw the corruption out of the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Sword of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, Ritssyn carried the &lt;a href=\"Scepter%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Scepter of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; if the player was not a warlock, representing the Council of the Black Harvest.\nDragonflight.\nRitssyn was present at the first Azerothian &lt;a href=\"Kosh%27harg\"&gt;Kosh'harg&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Razor%20Hill\"&gt;Razor Hill&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;.

It does not purge the curse from their veins, but it tempers the fury in their hearts and eases their bloodlust. The ceremony forces you to confront your doubts and fears, the anchors that weigh you down, and overcome them. It is commonly used by worgen, but others of great rage can take it as well, such as the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; king &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilneans&lt;/a&gt; were the first to undergo the ritual, and discovered there are those who require more effort to come to grips with themselves than others. &lt;a href=\"Halford%20Ramsey\"&gt;Halford Ramsey&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Worgen%20%28playable%29\"&gt;Gilnean&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; needed to complete the ritual before they could use human form. &lt;a href=\"Darius%20Crowley\"&gt;Darius Crowley&lt;/a&gt; could not complete the ritual because he held on to the regret, and thus could not use human form. &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; was able to use human form before the ritual to keep his affliction secret, and had to attempt it more than once.\nThe ritual was given to worgen under &lt;a href=\"Tal%27doren\"&gt;Tal'doren&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Gilneas\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;, and again in a secluded clearing in &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nWar of the Satyr.\nUpon their creation, &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion&lt;/a&gt; believed the &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Scythe\"&gt;Druids of the Scythe&lt;/a&gt; had given in to his rage without the balance of rational thought, but believed they were misguided, flawed, and confused by &lt;a href=\"Goldrinn\"&gt;Goldrinn&lt;/a&gt;'s great fury. Unwilling to destroy them, and with no other options, the archdruid used the &lt;a href=\"Scythe%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Scythe of Elune&lt;/a&gt; to banish the wayward druids to the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;.\nInvasion of Gilneas.\nSome &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; had sensed &lt;a href=\"Arugal\"&gt;Archmage Arugal's&lt;/a&gt; spell pulling the &lt;a href=\"Worgen\"&gt;wolf-beasts&lt;/a&gt; from the Emerald Dream, and they had set out to Gilneas to investigate. As the worgen &lt;a href=\"Wolf%20Cult\"&gt;Wolf Cult&lt;/a&gt; began to grow in Gilneas, &lt;a href=\"Belysra%20Starbreeze\"&gt;Belysra Starbreeze&lt;/a&gt; arrived in secret to advise and help &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt;, who had been bitten while hunting worgen, and to investigate if &lt;a href=\"Ralaar%20Fangfire\"&gt;Alpha Prime&lt;/a&gt; - the first worgen - was among the worgen summoned. Together, they kept her presence and his affliction a secret from the nation, and king attempted and failed the ritual at least once. One day before the attack, two night elves were seen investigating Tal'doren. Belysra continued to teach the king about the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Satyr\"&gt;War of the Satyr&lt;/a&gt;, in turn learning the rumors of the growing Wolf Cult and grew to believe Alpha Prime was indeed in Gilneas.\nAs the Wolf Cult attacked the city, her suspicions were confirmed. She met and spoke to Alpha Prime, who was orchestrating the attack from &lt;a href=\"Greymane%20Court\"&gt;Greymane Court&lt;/a&gt;. She was saved by Halford Ramsey, who had been abducted and bitten by the Wolf Cult three days prior, and was now stuck in worgen form and struggling to maintain control. During the attack, Genn Greymane managed to stay calm, and thus maintain his human masquerade.\nAfter the attack, the human Gilneans fled to &lt;a href=\"Duskhaven\"&gt;Duskhaven&lt;/a&gt;, while Belysra took Halford Ramsey to Tal'doren. There, she convinced Halford and other worgen bitten by the Wolf Cult to take the Ritual of Balance, bringing balance to as many as possible. Even as the &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Gilneas\"&gt;Horde's invasion&lt;/a&gt; was underway, the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; performed a ceremony called the Ritual of Balance to bring harmony to many of the worgen. The Ritual of Balance also brought peace to Gilneas's divided population.\nFury of the worgen.\nSome Gilneans failed the Ritual of Balance, which drove them &lt;a href=\"Mindless%20state\"&gt;mindless&lt;/a&gt; rather than help them, and had to be put down. When they evacuated to Teldrassil, living in the woods until the summit, a secluded clearing was prepared accordingly. Genn led Varian through the same Ritual of Balance that he and other worgen had used to control their rage. It worked, and or the first time in years, Varian Wrynn felt at peace with himself.\nCeremony.\nPreparations.\nWhile in Gilneas, the ritual was performed under Tal'doren for its calming properties. While living in the forests of Teldrassil, it was performed in a clearing deep in the forest, away from the Gilnean camps. Both locations included three simple wells of &lt;a href=\"moonwell\"&gt;moonwell&lt;/a&gt; water. Each well is overseen by a druid, a friend can serve as a guide, and the ceremony must be overseen by the pack. For if the worgen fails, and goes mad with grief, they must be put down. The worgen is given a &lt;a href=\"moonleaf\"&gt;moonleaf&lt;/a&gt; to eat, a symbol of both nature and the &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Mother Moon&lt;/a&gt;. It is long and silvery and tapers at the point. Rather than bitter, it has a soft, soothing texture and is easily swallowed once chewed. These simple leaves grow around Tal'doren by &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;'s grace and are meant to help the mind understand the need for balance and the soul so permanently earn mastery over the beast.\nThe worgen must then drink from each of the wells with a small mug. The visions can be taken one at a time, or in one sitting. The &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Tranquility\"&gt;Well of Tranquility&lt;/a&gt; helps to rekindle the peace and joy of childhood. The &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Balance\"&gt;Well of Balance&lt;/a&gt; keeps the mind and body as well, enabling the worgen to stand with both parts unified for the struggle ahead. The &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Fury\"&gt;Well of Fury&lt;/a&gt; enhances the first two while helping to build the strength needed to confront and command one's rage, that which most risks the ritual ending in failure. In Gilneas and Teldrassil, these wells were kept by &lt;a href=\"Talran%20of%20the%20Wild\"&gt;Talran&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vassandra%20Stormclaw\"&gt;Vassandra&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Lyros%20Swiftwind\"&gt;Lyros&lt;/a&gt; respectively.\nThe guide sits in front of the worgen, and the pack circles around. The worgen is to focus, close their eyes, and begin by looking into their memories for points most relevant to their life, including childhood, trauma, and choices. Memories are not only remembered, but also relived. The worgen can be guided into the ritual, but how they come through it depends much upon them. To conquer yourself\u2014 your own worst foe\u2014 requires tranquility, balance, and, last and by no means easy, ultimate mastery of your fury. Three struggles, not one. The visions force you to confront your doubts and fears, the anchors that weigh you down, and overcome them.\nVisions.\nDuring the first vision if of tranquility, one might find themselves a child once again, with memories of siblings or parents. The visions will appear vivid, but events may not play out exactly as they had. Varian Wrynn relived his happy childhood, as well as the death of his father, assassinated by &lt;a href=\"Garona%20Halforcen\"&gt;Garona&lt;/a&gt;. Halford Ramsey saw long-buried memories of tragedy and childhood trauma are relived as well, such as the death of a parent or sibling. The worgen must accept what had happened, and embrace what had been before to attain tranquility.\nThe vision of balance follows the worgen into adulthood, to relive another set of memories. Varian saw the struggles and depression of his youth, and relived &lt;a href=\"Tiffin%20Ellerian%20Wrynn\"&gt;first love&lt;/a&gt;, thereby balancing out. He was forced to relive her death as well, killed by a stray rock during &lt;a href=\"Stonemasons%20Guild\"&gt;riots&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;. Halford Ramsey relived the moment he discovered his beloved sister, hanging in the barn. Again the worgen must accept both the good and the bad, and move on from it.\nThe third and final challenge, the vision of fury, hones in on the source of one's rage. What often leads to true hate, true fury, is not malice, but the loss of something wonderful; the fear of losing that which you clutch so tightly, and it is suffering that has driven countless over the millennia to lose their way. For Halford Ramsey, this was the grudge against his sister's memory, and he had to forgive her to move on. For Varian Wrynn, the fear of losing his only son, Anduin. In the ritual, the worgen must master their rage and give it purpose, harnessing it as controlled fury.\nOutcomes.\nThe ritual has a high success rate, but there are no guarantees. Some fail and go mad with grief, and are put down by the Gilneans. Others simply cannot complete it, and may attempt again later. If successful, the ritual may help a worgen control the worgen curse to a degree. It does not purge the curse from their veins, but it tempers the fury in their hearts and eases their bloodlust. Upon completion, Halford Ramsey awoke in human form. Varian awoke, no longer felt rage towards the Gilneans, and instead led the charge against &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;."}

The formula (and syntax used) varies depending on the method of searching used. &lt;a href=\"Lua\"&gt;Lua&lt;/a&gt;, the scripting language that World of Warcraft uses, does not support regular expressions. Instead, it offers a basic pattern-matching mechanism with most of the features of REs. Though since Lua doesn't implement regexes, at all, but rather \"patterns\", this can confuse more than it helps. Better refer to the official Lua documentation (which never mentions \"regular expressions\").\n\"Regexes\" (patterns) in Lua.\nLua has a few string functions that use patterns (what some people mistakenly call regexes). Among them are\nConstructing a pattern.\nSo, how do we construct a pattern?\nAt the foundation of patterns are character classes. These classes represent sets of characters. Lua's classes are\nThe upper cased version of the above reverses the meaning of said (i.e. %A --- represents all \"non\"-letters).\nAll patterns are made up of a sequence of these classes. For example, if you wanted to match the string \"###Abc\" (# designates a digit), you would use the pattern \"%d%d%dAbc\". By adding modifiers, you can change the meaning of these classes. Let x be the class we want to modify.\nThere are also four special pattern elements\nWhen ^ or $ is anywhere else in a pattern, it has no special meaning.\nPatterns may also have subpatterns. These are enclosed with () and are counted as matches are found. They can be accessed using the %n element mentioned above. Using the empty capture \"()\" will return the string position where a match is found.\nPattern Items.\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.lua.org/manual/5.0/manual.html%235.3\"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;\nExample.\nSay we're writing a function that watches the combat chat and counts the number of times a murloc dies nearby (don't we all want this? :) ). So, how do we do this? (incidentally, I have done this. It was quite satisfying)\nFor simplicity's sake, let's assume all murlocs have the word \"Murloc\" in their name. For this case, the pattern \"Murloc\" would be all we need. However, as we all know, there seem to be no end to the varieties of Murlocs. Say we want to count all the murlocs killed nearby while we're in Darkshore. Now matching each type by name exactly would work, but would result in a huge function. It becomes simpler when we notice that they all (save the named ones) are of the \"Greymist\" clan, as we can use \"Greymist\" as our pattern.\nNow these are extremely simple patterns. For a better challenge, let's go one step further. Instead of just counting the number that die, let's replace the name of whatever died with \"An unholy demon spawn\". Since the name of the mob will vary, we need a pattern that will match all of them. To do this, we can use \"^Greymist .* dies()\". This pattern will match strings that start with the word \"Greymist\" followed by any number of characters followed by the word \"dies\". Then we can just use the string.gsub function to do the replacement like so:\nstring.gsub(chatstring, \"^Greymist .* dies\", \"An unholy demon spawn dies\");\nAfterthoughts.\nHopefully this has given you a good start into how to use regular expressions. There are many many resources online regarding them, and if there's anything not covered here, you should be able to find it somewhere out there."}

{"id": "419647", "revid": "40372170", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=419647", "title": "Resource pooling", "text": "Resource pooling is an advanced tactic used by non-mana classes to make the most of their abilities. The idea is that when a limited-time bonus effect is active, the maximum amount of resources - whether &lt;a href=\"rage\"&gt;rage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"energy\"&gt;energy&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"focus\"&gt;focus&lt;/a&gt; - should be available in order to use many abilities in a row, causing them all to benefit from the bonus. This is generally used by players who have already mastered their &lt;a href=\"specialization\"&gt;specialization&lt;/a&gt;'s basic &lt;a href=\"rotation\"&gt;rotation&lt;/a&gt; of abilities and reactions to fight events, to push their effectiveness even higher.\nResource pooling could be considered a subset of the idea of \"&lt;a href=\"stack\"&gt;stack&lt;/a&gt;ing\" beneficial effects, except the \"effect\" being stacked here is \"having many resources to use abilities rapidly\".\nResource pooling is mostly a strategy for damage dealing. Tanks are not usually interested in \"spamming\" abilities in the way that pooling allows, while healers have large mana pools that normally do not require pooling.\nApplicability.\nAbilities and other effects can be roughly categorized by their synergy with other abilities and their level of \"uptime\", both of which affect resource pooling potential. Personal or raid buffs, enemy debuffs, or even encounter-specific mechanics can all be considered \"buffs\" for the purpose of resource pooling, as long as they increase the impact of other abilities. Note that pooling might turn out to be irrelevant to a buff that theoretically would benefit from it, because the specialization's &lt;a href=\"rotation\"&gt;rotation&lt;/a&gt; has higher priority concerns or is otherwise too complex for pooling to be a factor.\nSome abilities have no impact on the effectiveness of anything else, for instance simple direct damage. There is no reason to be concerned with resource pooling before using these attacks. However, such abilities may be affected \"by\" others, and some of \"those\" may benefit from pooling. In many cases, this type of ability is the mechanism by which resource pooling does its work, by allowing these \"standalone\" attacks to be used more rapidly.\nLow-cooldown buffs that enhance &lt;a href=\"white%20damage\"&gt;white damage&lt;/a&gt; or increase haste typically are desirable to keep up all the time, since white damage is dealt nearly constantly and haste speeds up the entire rotation. Because such buffs should be constant, there is no \"effectiveness window\" for which to prepare by resource pooling, and so the strategy is irrelevant. At most, a player may want to reserve enough resources to refresh the buff when necessary, but nothing more. This rule is not set in stone - it depends on whether the effect's across-the-board benefits outweigh the benefit to resource-costing abilities that could be pooled.\nIf other resource-driven abilities \"are\" the primary beneficiaries of a low-cooldown buff, then usage is simple - that buff can be applied whenever it's convenient to stockpile resources. That stockpile would then be consumed by all the abilities that benefit from the buff.\nMany &lt;a href=\"cooldown\"&gt;cooldown&lt;/a&gt;-driven abilities are desirable to use as often as possible. Therefore, players should anticipate the expiration of the cooldown and begin pooling resources beforehand. When such a cooldown becomes available, it and a large number of abilities can then be used immediately, and the cooldown can begin ticking again with no delays.\nUsage.\nIn practice, due to reaction time, lag, and the &lt;a href=\"global%20cooldown\"&gt;global cooldown&lt;/a&gt;, it is generally not realistic to wait until the absolute maximum resource cap, especially with a resource that regenerates quickly, since any delay after reaching maximum would cause potential resources to be wasted. Players may instead want to aim for a \"soft cap\" where there is still about 1-1.5 second's worth of \"room\" before hitting the maximum and wasting resources.\nIt is easiest to pool energy if a player has control over the timing of the buff period, such as one granted by an ability or on-use item, but it is also possible in response to random or timed events.\nSpecial consideration must be given to effects that increase the rate of resource regeneration, including fight mechanics that slow resource consumption, even simple movement. If the increased net rate of regeneration is likely to cause the player to hit the resource cap, then the energy should obviously not be pooled to maximum beforehand. The combinations of effects that cause this situation vary from class to class and fight to fight, and again can be affected by lag and reaction time. If the \"only\" benefit of an effect is to increase attack speed and/or resource regeneration (e.g. a &lt;a href=\"bloodlust%20effect\"&gt;bloodlust effect&lt;/a&gt;), then there is no reason for pooling, since there is no synergistic benefit to be gained and resources may even be wasted. However, since other &lt;a href=\"cooldown\"&gt;cooldown&lt;/a&gt;s are often saved for such an effect, it may well be worth pooling energy for \"those\".\nExample.\nA combat rogue's &lt;a href=\"Revealing%20Strike\"&gt;Revealing Strike&lt;/a&gt; increases the effectiveness of other abilities and lasts 24 seconds. If it is used as soon as possible, the rogue will have 0 energy after using it, and will regenerate 300 energy in the next 24 seconds (not including random energy effects), allowing the use of 300 energy worth of abilities enhanced by that single Revealing Strike. However, if a rogue stops using energy-consuming abilities briefly and waits until 100 energy to use &lt;a href=\"Revealing%20Strike\"&gt;Revealing Strike&lt;/a&gt;, 60 more energy will be available for enhanced abilities during the duration of Revealing Strike, a significant increase. This saves energy and time that would otherwise be used reapplying Revealing Strike more frequently than necessary.\nOther resources.\nMana-using classes and specializations generally have no reason to concern themselves with resource pooling, since the very nature of a &lt;a href=\"mana%20pool\"&gt;mana pool&lt;/a&gt; means they should already have all the resources desired. However, a similar strategy to traditional resource pooling may be employed if such a class finds itself low on mana. In this case, instead of casting a series of ineffective spells one at a time as soon as any mana is available for one, it may be beneficial to wait until enough mana for several spells is available, so that positive interactions between spells can occur and the scarce mana can be used as efficiently as possible.\nCharge-type resources, including the &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"rune%20system\"&gt;rune system&lt;/a&gt;, are typically too inflexible to be \"pooled\". Since there are so few possible states for them to be in, it is difficult to pool a meaningful amount of them without hitting the \"cap\" where potential recharging is being wasted. Such charges are also usually quite restricted in their generation and usage, so it would be difficult to change their timing without reducing their overall effectiveness. This limitation is reduced with more charges and more flexibility in their use - for instance the rogue &lt;a href=\"Anticipation\"&gt;Anticipation&lt;/a&gt; talent effectively doubles the number of &lt;a href=\"combo%20point\"&gt;combo point&lt;/a&gt; charges, and stops them from being completely consumed by every relevant ability, thereby turning them from a relatively predictable cyclical resource into one that can be pooled for specific uses.\nOther bar-type resources such as &lt;a href=\"Demonic%20Fury\"&gt;Demonic Fury&lt;/a&gt; may well benefit from pooling, depending on the abilities and effects available.\nOther meanings.\n\"Resource pooling\" may sometimes refer to other situations in which a buildup of resources occurs, even if they are not being specifically saved for a large expenditure as described above.\nOne reason a player may do this intentionally is to \"reserve\" resources for use when a random effect grants a charge of an ability, or for when an ability's cooldown ends. Note that unlike full resource pooling, the objective is not to maintain near-maximum levels of a resource for subsequent \"dumping\", it is only to reserve enough of it to use the anticipated ability(s).\nIt is also possible for players to unintentionally pool resources if a combination of cooldowns, random effects, or fight conditions prevents them from being used. This may look similar to strategic energy pooling, but unless such players are lucky enough to have an applicable ability ready to exploit the buildup of resources, they will likely not see any benefit, and may end up wasting resources hitting the maximum.\nList of abilities.\nThese &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt; abilities benefit from energy pooling:\nThese &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt; abilities benefit from rage pooling:\nThese feral &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt; abilities benefit from energy pooling:\nThe beast master &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt; ability &lt;a href=\"Bestial%20Wrath\"&gt;Bestial Wrath&lt;/a&gt; benefits from focus pooling.\nThe &lt;a href=\"engineering\"&gt;engineering&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"tinker%20%28engineering%29\"&gt;tinker&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Synapse%20Springs%20%28Mark%20II%29\"&gt;Synapse Springs (Mark II)&lt;/a&gt; benefits from resource pooling.\nPlayers can gain an increased effect by pooling their resources before this ability from \"other\" players:"}

Variants of this type of play are often called 'King of the Hill' or 'Domination' games. Resource race is currently the most common type of battleground, with six battlegrounds of this type available to play.\nGameplay.\nResources come in various forms, representing gold, territorial rights, or even an overall sense of victory. Whatever the form, resource races hinge on gathering these resources as fast as possible. Whichever team is first to reach the resource target - usually 1600 or 2000 points - will win the match, regardless of number of kills or martial superiority. If the time-limit expires before the target is reached, the team with the highest score will win the game.\nResources.\nResources may be accumulated from a variety of sources, depending on the battleground. Capturing bases is a common form of resource generation (&lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Basin\"&gt;Arathi Basin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Gilneas\"&gt;Battle for Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;), while other battlegrounds may reward points for possessing or controlling objects (&lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Kotmogu\"&gt;Temple of Kotmogu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Silvershard%20Mines\"&gt;Silvershard Mines&lt;/a&gt;) or even for capturing &lt;a href=\"Capture%20the%20Flag\"&gt;flags&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20the%20Storm\"&gt;Eye of the Storm&lt;/a&gt;). \nWhatever the means of generating resources, battlegrounds tend to provide multiple opportunities to do so. Unlike in &lt;a href=\"capture%20the%20flag\"&gt;capture the flag&lt;/a&gt; battlegrounds where there may be only a single critical target in play, in resource races, players are required to split their attentions between several targets. This requires a different kind of teamwork, sending players wherever they are needed most as enemy forces surge back and forth between bases, searching for a weak link in their opponents' defences.\nMany bases are claimed through actively interacting with a flag - a process easily disrupted by opponents with other thoughts in mind - while others are claimed through sheer strength of numbers, with the team with the largest number of players in the vicinity slowly gaining control of the node - with a small bonus for each honorable kill achieved in the area. Others are picked up with a simple click of the mouse, but will rapidly make the carrier a prime target for the wrath of the opposing team.\nFor more information on flags and bases, see &lt;a href=\"Battleground%23Special%20elements\"&gt;Special elements&lt;/a&gt;."}

{"id": "14738", "revid": "26060681", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=14738", "title": "Rest", "text": "Rest is a system whereby characters may accumulate a bonus modifier for &lt;a href=\"experience%20point\"&gt;experience point&lt;/a&gt; (XP) gains. Earning XP from certain sources while rested will grant additional XP, but will consume part of the rest state or bonus. The bonus is gained slowly while the character logged out, and more rapidly whenever the character is in an inn or city. A character's rest bonus is displayed along the top of their XP bar.\nThe rest bonus serves several purposes. Its presence allows players who play less often to &lt;a href=\"level\"&gt;level&lt;/a&gt; their characters at an increased rate, while its absence encourages players who are playing frequently or for prolonged periods to take a break, or level an &lt;a href=\"alt\"&gt;alt&lt;/a&gt;. It can also encourage players to return to the game after time away, and can be seen as a way of discouraging game addiction. In terms of gameplay, the rest bonus encourages players to begin and end each playing session by 'resting' their player in an inn or city, which can increase immersion in the role-playing elements of the game. It can also encourage players to spend time engaging in other aspects of play such as &lt;a href=\"trading\"&gt;trading&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe rest bonus is a useful and easily-obtained boost to the leveling process, and provides a good reason to log out in cities and inns, and to take regular breaks from play. However, even if constantly maintained, it represents only a fraction of the experience gained by a player while leveling, and should be viewed as a bonus and not a requisite for play.\nStoring up rest.\nWhile in an &lt;a href=\"inn\"&gt;inn&lt;/a&gt;, anywhere in a &lt;a href=\"capital\"&gt;capital&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"city\"&gt;city&lt;/a&gt; or at your &lt;a href=\"Garrison\"&gt;Garrison&lt;/a&gt;, your player portrait will begin to glow and your level circle will say \"zzz\", indicating that you are resting. Characters in these locations (including characters logged off in these locations) gain rest quickly. Characters can also earn rest by logging off in other locations, although they will earn rest at a quarter of the speed. \nOne bubble of rested &lt;a href=\"XP\"&gt;XP&lt;/a&gt; (5% of your current level) is earned for every 8 hours spent resting in an inn or city, or for every 32 hours spent logged off in another location. A maximum of 30 bubbles (150% of your current level) may be earned. This means that you can leave your character resting in an inn or capital city for up to 10 days (without gaining experience) before you earn the maximum amount of rest state. A fully-resting character stores up one full level of rest in 160 hours (6.67 days).\nNote that rested bonus is earned relative to the character's current level. Since lower-level characters gain levels more frequently, the rested bonus is generally consumed far more quickly at these levels. For example, a fully-rested level 1 character could easily use up their rest bonus within a few minutes, while a level 50 character's full rest bonus could last for hours of play. The rested bonus can therefore be seen to be more valuable and worthwhile at higher levels.\nThe rate of gain of rested bonus, and the maximum amount of rested bonus, are also based on your \"current\" level, not the level at which you'll be when your rested bonus is fully consumed. At certain points in the levelling process, the XP requirements for your next level can be as much as \"double\" the requirements for your current level -- e.g., it requires about half as many XP to get from level 59 to level 60 as it does to get from level 60 to level 61. If your XP bar is nearly at the end of level 59, and you log out for 10 days, your XP bonus will only stretch about 3/4 of the way through level 60. (Some mods that show your rested bonus through the next level may not take this into account, and give you overly optimistic data.)\nIt may also be possible to engage the &lt;a href=\"resting\"&gt;resting&lt;/a&gt; state while in &lt;a href=\"ghost%20form\"&gt;ghost form&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"dead\"&gt;dead&lt;/a&gt;. You also gain rested XP if you log off while on route between two flight points.\nConsuming rest.\nWhen rested, your XP bar will turn blue, and a notch will appear indicating exactly how rested you are. (If there isn't enough room to show it on your current XP bar, it will show up after you gain a level.) You will earn double XP from killing monsters, mining ore nodes, gathering herbs, collecting archaeology fragments, and opening chests while rested until your XP bar fills to the notch. At that point, the message\nwill appear and you will resume normal XP gains.\nWhen you are rested and you gain eligible XP, in the combat log it may say something like \nThis means you received a total of 120 XP: 60 XP for the action, and an extra 60 rested XP. \nThe amount of rested bonus consumed is equal to the total amount of XP gained. In the example above, 120 rested bonus would be used, not 60.\nExperience earned from exploration and quests does \"not\" consume the rested bonus. When XP is gained from these sources, the rest marker will be moved forward by as many XP as you gain from the exploration or quest, indicating that your rested reserve remains unchanged. Also if you're using the &lt;a href=\"Recruit-A-Friend\"&gt;Recruit-A-Friend&lt;/a&gt; function, the rest marker will be pushed forward and your rested XP will not be consumed.\nDisplaying rest.\nExecute the following script to display the amount of Rested XP your character has earned:\n /script p=\"player\";x=UnitXP(p);m=UnitXPMax(p);r=GetXPExhaustion();if -1==(r or -1)then t=\"No rest.\"else t=\"Rest: \"..(math.floor(20*r/m+0.5))..\" bubbles (\"if r+x&lt;m then t=t..r else t=t..\"level +\"..(r+x-m)end t=t..\"XP)\"end;DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessage(t)\nA line will be added to your chat window displaying something similar one of these: \nTips.\nWhen you are about 5th or 6th level, you will receive quests to go to another town area. This town is where the first inn is available to a new character. Put another way, until you get your first 5 or 6 levels out of the way you will not happen across an inn and so you will have to 'camp out' when you logout, accumulating rest at the slower \"wilderness\" rate. It is easy enough to get these first five levels, so it is good to finish those quests and hurry over to the inn.\nAt this inn, and at all other inns that you find, you will find an &lt;a href=\"innkeeper\"&gt;innkeeper&lt;/a&gt;, who can bind your &lt;a href=\"hearthstone\"&gt;hearthstone&lt;/a&gt; to that inn. Activating your hearthstone you will move your character to that bound inn (until you do this, the hearthstone will return you to the starting zone). This is useful for rapid or unexpected logout situations; you can activate your hearthstone and log out at the inn, gaining rest.\nBy having at least two characters, you can rest on one while playing the other! This is one benefit of having &lt;a href=\"alt\"&gt;alt&lt;/a&gt;s.\nNot required for play.\nRested bonus is nice to have and use, but it is not required. Some players have been known to stop playing their characters when they have consumed all of their rested bonus. This is fine, and it is the player's choice, but know that it is not bad to play \"without\" rested bonus. Your character is not tired, nor penalized in any way. It actually takes longer to level to &lt;a href=\"Level%20cap\"&gt;the current cap&lt;/a&gt; if you stop playing a character \"specifically to let rested bonus accrue\" because in the amount of time the bonus fills up you could easily go another level. \nIn short - if you're enjoying playing the character, just keep on going - rested or not. Just log out in an inn for a little bonus between sessions!\nWhy rest state was added.\nThe rest state was added for a number of reasons:\nIn the beta version of the original game, rest did not exist and experience was designed to prevent players from playing more than a few hours in a row. Experience gained was divided by 50% after few hours. However, beta-testers did not like it and rest was implemented, giving instead 200% of experience for few hours, which Blizzard's developers later reported as being the \"same numbers seen from the opposite point of view\"."}

He wondered what Kil'jaeden had planned for them.\nRestalaan was among those who gathered on a mountain on Argus and escaped with the Prophet and other eredar refugees - known henceforth as the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; - from &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;' corruption. When the draenei settled on &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, Restalaan became the captain of the guard in the city of &lt;a href=\"Telmor\"&gt;Telmor&lt;/a&gt;. During a routine patrol in &lt;a href=\"Terokkar%20Forest\"&gt;Terokkar Forest&lt;/a&gt;, he and his men saved two future &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; chieftains - &lt;a href=\"Durotan\"&gt;Durotan&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20clan\"&gt;Frostwolf clan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock clan&lt;/a&gt; - from an &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt; attack, and brought them to Telmor, revealing the hidden defenses of the city using a shard of the &lt;a href=\"ata%27mal%20crystal\"&gt;ata'mal crystal&lt;/a&gt; and a phrase in his native tongue.\nYears later, when the orcs began making war on the draenei, Restalaan was investigating the murders and kept informing Prophet about it.

Restalaan defeated him, but spared his life because of an earlier incident in which Durotan spared and released Velen (on his way to &lt;a href=\"Oshu%27gun\"&gt;Oshu'gun&lt;/a&gt;) from his custody. Later, Durotan - having remembered the incantation used to lower the invisibility shield that protected Telmor - was tasked by Warchief &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; to assault the city, as it was close to Frostwolf territory. Locating the crystal and speaking the words Restalaan had used, Durotan revealed the city for the orc invasion force, which proceeded to sack the city. With the city being torn apart around them, the two met again in combat, holding nothing back. In the end, Durotan defeated and killed Restalaan with his &lt;a href=\"Nightstalker%20%28wolf%29\"&gt;wolf&lt;/a&gt;'s help - a deed that, along with the events that were soon to follow, would be a heavy burden on Durotan's conscience for the remainder of his life.\nRestalaan was succeeded as Velen's lieutenant by &lt;a href=\"Larohir\"&gt;Larohir&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nAn &lt;a href=\"echo%20of%20Restalaan\"&gt;echo of Restalaan&lt;/a&gt; can be seen by the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s on &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"Bully%20Pulpit\"&gt;Bully Pulpit&lt;/a&gt;."}

They also all have a base cast time of 10 seconds (modified by &lt;a href=\"haste\"&gt;haste&lt;/a&gt;), and have no &lt;a href=\"cooldown\"&gt;cooldown&lt;/a&gt;.\nTips.\nFollowing resurrection, the character will usually require healing, to eat and/or to drink. Healing is often provided by the resurrecting player or a healer. Resurrected players will have lost all previous buffs, and so may also need to be rebuffed.\nWhen a target is resurrected, it is restored to the location of the resurrecting player when the resurrection spell was cast - not where the player's corpse is, nor where the resurrecting player is when the resurrected player accepts the resurrection.\nResurrection abilities cannot be used while in combat, and if the casting player enters combat during the spell's casting time, the spell will be cancelled. However, it is possible to temporarily leave ongoing combat by removing oneself from the battle, in order to resurrect fallen allies. In PvP, it can be useful to retreat behind a pillar or other obstruction, in order to hide and avoid ranged attacks until the resurrection can be completed.\nLike all spells, these abilities are affected by &lt;a href=\"haste\"&gt;haste&lt;/a&gt;. Players can use haste boosts from sources such as &lt;a href=\"trinket\"&gt;trinket&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"racial\"&gt;racial&lt;/a&gt;s in order to drastically reduce the cast time of a resurrection ability.\nThere are some common misconceptions involving resurrection and releasing. Players can be resurrected whether or not they release. If the dead player has not released, the resurrecting player can select the body and cast the spell. If they have released and the body is out of range, the resurrector must click the spell and mouse over the corpse since the corpse is not selectable. There are reasons not to release however. If a player releases, they will not see loot on mobs killed while the player is dead. Players who release do not receive credit if a required quest event happens while the player is dead. Players that have released do not receive achievement credit for bosses killed while they are dead. Players dead while a kill is made receive reputation but not experience (if eligible for experience).\nCasting a resurrection spell on a character who is &lt;a href=\"PvP%20flag\"&gt;flagged&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt; (impossible to determine visually) will cause the resurrecting player to also become flagged.\nNote that there is no way to tell whether or not a corpse belongs to the player's faction except by inspecting it visually. If the corpse \"does\" belong to the player's faction, it is possible to tell whether the player is still online or not by typing \"/who playername.\" A response of \"0 players found\" indicates that the player has logged off (or is of the wrong faction). A response giving the target's race, level, and class indicates that the player is still online and can be successfully resurrected. Note that landing a resurrection on an offline or cross-faction player's corpses is indistinguishable from landing one on an online player's corpse who simply declines the resurrection. In both cases, the mana is wasted, and resurrection will not take place.\nDefibrillate.\n&lt;a href=\"Engineers\"&gt;Engineers&lt;/a&gt; can use tools to attempt to \"defibrillate\" dead allies. These tools are not always successful, but when used on a resurrecting-capable class can save a party from a long run back.\nAll engineering abilities are on a shared 30 minute cooldown, have a 4 second cast time, and resurrect the target with 15% health and mana.\nCombat resurrection.\nAlso called battle resurrection or battle res. Four classes have abilities that can be used to resurrect fallen allies during &lt;a href=\"combat\"&gt;combat&lt;/a&gt;. All combat resurrections provide 60% health and 20% mana when resurrecting, but &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s can glyph their resurrections to provide 100% health instead.\n&lt;a href=\"Soulstone\"&gt;Soulstone&lt;/a&gt; can also be used preemptively, allowing players a self-resurrect for 15 minutes. While the &lt;a href=\"quilen\"&gt;quilen&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt; pet is &lt;a href=\"Exotic%20Beasts\"&gt;exclusive&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Beast%20Mastery\"&gt;Beast Mastery&lt;/a&gt; spec, &lt;a href=\"crane\"&gt;crane&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"moth\"&gt;moth&lt;/a&gt;s can be used by all hunter specs to provide a combat res.\nAfter the cap is reached, attempting to use one of the three abilities will result in an error message, reading \"You can no longer resurrect during combat.\"\nNote that there are \"no\" limits to combat resurrections during &lt;a href=\"trash\"&gt;trash&lt;/a&gt; or 5-man boss encounters. It is unknown whether this limit still applies to Vanilla and TBC raids. Also, self-resurrections such as &lt;a href=\"Reincarnation\"&gt;Reincarnation&lt;/a&gt; and are not counted in this limit.\nSelf-resurrection.\n&lt;a href=\"Shaman\"&gt;Shaman&lt;/a&gt; are able to self-resurrect on a 30 minute cooldown with their &lt;a href=\"Reincarnation\"&gt;Reincarnation&lt;/a&gt; ability, instantly resurrecting with 20% health and mana. Notably, this ability does not count toward the combat resurrection limit during a boss fight.\nAll classes may also equip a which provides a 10% chance on death to gain a reincarnation ability, also returning 20% health and mana.\nMass resurrection.\nFormerly, players in guilds could use &lt;a href=\"Mass%20Resurrection%20%28guild%20perk%29\"&gt;Mass Resurrection (guild perk)&lt;/a&gt;, a spell that resurrected all fallen allies within 100 yards for 35% health and mana. Mass Resurrection was a 10 second cast and while it had no direct cooldown, players that were resurrected this way received a debuff called \"Recently Mass Resurrected\" for 10 minutes. The debuff persisted through death and did not allow future mass resurrections via the guild perk.\nIn &lt;a href=\"patch%207.0.3\"&gt;patch 7.0.3&lt;/a&gt;, Mass Resurrection was removed as a guild perk and all healing specs were given a baseline mass resurrection ability. &lt;a href=\"Priest\"&gt;Priest&lt;/a&gt;s retained the original Mass Resurrection spell in both healing specs.\nResurrection timer.\nAfter dying there is a time in which you can not return to your body or accept the resurrection cast by another player. This is known as the \"Resurrection Cooldown\" (not to be confused with the &lt;a href=\"cooldown\"&gt;cooldown&lt;/a&gt;s on engineering, combat, and mass resurrection abilities). This timer increases with each death to a maximum of 2 minutes. This timer does not affect resurrection at a &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Healer\"&gt;Spirit Healer&lt;/a&gt; or instance portal."}

However, the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; was victorious and the entire army was destroyed.\nThe battle.\nBackground.\nAround the time of &lt;a href=\"The%20Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;The Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;, a nobleman called &lt;a href=\"Maddox\"&gt;Maddox&lt;/a&gt; decided to retake &lt;a href=\"Andorhal\"&gt;Andorhal&lt;/a&gt; for his own ambitions. His father was a rich man, and so, using his wealth, he hired a &lt;a href=\"mercenary\"&gt;mercenary&lt;/a&gt; army to attempt to retake Andorhal.\nMaddox managed to convince the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt; to help him in his battle, recruiting the entire &lt;a href=\"Chillwind%20Camp\"&gt;Chillwind Camp&lt;/a&gt;, and hiring hundreds of mercenaries. The army was to rendezvous in Chillwind.\n&lt;a href=\"Arif\"&gt;Arif&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ciarin\"&gt;Ciarin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lelior\"&gt;Lelior&lt;/a&gt; joined Maddox for unknown reasons but &lt;a href=\"Thorn\"&gt;Thorn&lt;/a&gt; joined because he wanted to free the land of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. Maddox had the bad luck of eating &lt;a href=\"Rotten%20Arakkoa%20Egg\"&gt;Arakkoa Eggs that resulted to be rotten&lt;/a&gt; and was late for the meeting. During his journey to Chillwind Camp, he meet with a farmer called &lt;a href=\"Halsand\"&gt;Halsand&lt;/a&gt;, who knew the land very well and decided to help Maddox.\nChillwind Camp.\nFinally the party arrived to Chillwind Camp but instead of finding an army of hundreds of soldiers, they just found around one hundred men ready to abort the mission.\n&lt;a href=\"Argent%20Officer%20Pureheart\"&gt;Argent Officer Pureheart&lt;/a&gt; was convinced that they would be slaughtered if they attacked but she was convinced as &lt;a href=\"Halsand\"&gt;Halsand&lt;/a&gt; told her that he knew the land and could make a strategy to defeat the Scourge. Maddox then decided to pay triple to all the men that went with him.\nHalsand drew a map of the city and Maddox decided to split the army in two, one led by himself, &lt;a href=\"Lelior\"&gt;Lelior&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thorn\"&gt;Thorn&lt;/a&gt; and the other led by another person.\nAndorhal.\nThe Scourge army hid in the buildings and in the water, awaiting for the army of Maddox. Unaware, the army entered the city with no difficulty and arrived to the middle point where the other half of the army was supposed to meet. However, a suspicious Arif illuminated a house, revealing it was full of &lt;a href=\"ghoul\"&gt;ghoul&lt;/a&gt;s who attacked. Other undead reinforcements emerged from the water and buildings.\nThorn ordered his troops to form ranks and thus the battle began, as the two armies fought, &lt;a href=\"Ciarin\"&gt;Ciarin&lt;/a&gt; was killed. Within a while, the entire Argent Dawn force from Chillwind had been destroyed, with only a few mercenaries surviving.\nMeanwhile the other half of the army was slaughtered by &lt;a href=\"Abomination\"&gt;Abomination&lt;/a&gt;s and other undead troops. When Maddox believed that he had the battle won, he came under attack. They destroyed what was left of the army and killed &lt;a href=\"Lelior\"&gt;Lelior&lt;/a&gt;. Halsand was wounded while the rest of the army, including &lt;a href=\"Arif\"&gt;Arif&lt;/a&gt;, were slaughtered. Thorn and Maddox tried to flee, taking Halsand before they left.\nIn their attempt to escape Thorn and Maddox were slain by &lt;a href=\"Skeleton\"&gt;Skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s. Halsand ignored them and continued as the only survivor but when he was crossing the bridge to leave, a skeleton knocked him off of his horse, while a ghoul attacked him. \nHe stuck his pipe in the eye of the ghoul and managed to run, but it was too late as he had drunk water contaminated with the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;Plague of Undeath&lt;/a&gt;. Halsand transformed into a ghoul but was later killed by &lt;a href=\"Jake\"&gt;his son&lt;/a&gt;."}
