His failure to stop Prince Arthas' betrayal has led him to lose his connection to the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;. He became a &lt;a href=\"mercenary\"&gt;mercenary&lt;/a&gt; for hire in &lt;a href=\"Tarren%20Mill\"&gt;Tarren Mill&lt;/a&gt; where his adventures with &lt;a href=\"Anveena\"&gt;Anveena&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Tyrygosa\"&gt;Tyrygosa&lt;/a&gt; eventually led him to reconnect with the Light and become the heroic knight he was meant to be.\nBiography.\nThe Sunwell Trilogy.\nJorad Mace was a former &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt; in the service of &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Prince Arthas&lt;/a&gt;, before Arthas' betrayal of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. When they first invaded, he had tried to stop the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; but failed. Having served the traitor prince and failing to slay him before he brought the Scourge to Lordaeron has haunted him ever since. The bitterness of his failure eventually caused him to lose his connection to the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;. He ran from the Scourge as far as he could and collapsed, nearly perishing had he not been found by a mysterious being known as &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Borel&lt;/a&gt;. Borel helped the young paladin to survive and offered Jorad a way to redeem himself. He was sent out with the promise of contacting him at a later date. Jorad killed Scourge in the meantime but it was never enough for him and as time passed on, he lost faith in himself and started to ignore Borel's summons.\nHe later ventured to the safety of &lt;a href=\"Tarren%20Mill\"&gt;Tarren Mill&lt;/a&gt; and waited. After Tarren Mill was attacked by the Scourge and the attack repelled, he agreed to assist &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalec&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Anveena\"&gt;Anveena&lt;/a&gt; find the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt; and the mage &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Borel&lt;/a&gt;, who helped him some times. During their adventures, he has grown close with Anveena and her draconic companions; especially with the blue dragon &lt;a href=\"Tyri\"&gt;Tyri&lt;/a&gt;, who he is romantically attracted to. By aiding them in their quest to safeguard Anveena from &lt;a href=\"Dar%27Khan%20Drathir\"&gt;Dar'Khan Drathir&lt;/a&gt;, Jorad believes that he has redeemed himself a little for his past failures. After battling against the Scourge in the peaks of Alterac, he ventured to Quel'Thalas and helped his companions as well as the blood elves to defeat Dar'Khan.\nShadow Wing.\nJorad Mace tried to find redemption by continuing to fight the Scourge but knew it was a fool's errand. Knowing that his chances of survival and defeating Arthas were slim to none, he turned his attention to other matters.\nSometime later, the surviving demons of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; under Lord &lt;a href=\"Kazzak\"&gt;Kazzak&lt;/a&gt;, managed to reopen the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; and reunite with their kin on &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. Jorad Mace went with the Silver Hand army to secure Outland from the demonic threat. While on a quest to deliver a message to &lt;a href=\"Honor%20Hold\"&gt;Honor Hold&lt;/a&gt;, he was reunited once again with &lt;a href=\"Tyrygosa\"&gt;Tyrygosa&lt;/a&gt;, who was under the guise of an elven mage in the Alliance army. Tyri was drawn by some familiar yet different source of magic in Outland and came there to investigate. Tyri offered to fly him to Honor Hold but during mid-flight, they were attacked by a spell from &lt;a href=\"Ragnok%20Bloodreaver\"&gt;Ragnok Bloodreaver&lt;/a&gt;, causing them to crash land and be captured by a tribe of &lt;a href=\"Broken\"&gt;Broken&lt;/a&gt;. Tyri managed to escape but Jorad remained a captive. The Broken were distrustful of outsiders and especially dragons, as a new breed of dragonflight known as the &lt;a href=\"netherwing%20dragonflight\"&gt;netherwing dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; have been hunting them. Tyrygosa eventually came back in an attempt to free Jorad with new companions: &lt;a href=\"Zzeraku\"&gt;Zzeraku&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Valoku\"&gt;Valoku&lt;/a&gt;, but was betrayed by Zzeraku. Jorad who had gained the Broken tribe's trust, managed to convince them that Tyri was not a threat before they attacked one another.\nTyri wished to learn more about the &lt;a href=\"nether%20dragon\"&gt;nether dragon&lt;/a&gt;s and investigated a nether dragon lair. Jorad and the Broken chief &lt;a href=\"Warrith\"&gt;Warrith&lt;/a&gt; accompanied her but were attacked by Ragnok's &lt;a href=\"fel%20orc\"&gt;fel orc&lt;/a&gt;s. Warrith and Jorad fell from Tyri's back, and they were again separated, leaving Warrith and Jorad to deal with their attackers. Jorad's life was saved by Warrith, who had stepped in front of an attack from a fel orc in order to protect him. Jorad's desire to protect Tyri and his friends allowed him to be found worthy by the Light again and with its power, he was able to avenge Warrith. Jorad was later transported by Valoku to the safety of Warrith's Broken tribe, to whom he recalled the events of Warrith's death and sacrifice. &lt;a href=\"Valwar\"&gt;Valwar&lt;/a&gt; had theorized that his attackers were most likely minions of Ragnok Bloodreaver, a &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt; who had created an army of enslaved nether dragons and fel orcs with the sole purpose of conquering Outland and Azeroth. With recent reports of Ragnok emerging victorious over the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt; and indicating that his forces were marching towards the Dark Portal, Jorad asked for their help in warning the Alliance forces of Ragnok's impending attack.\nHe and Valwar were dispatched to send word to an Alliance outpost, but the soldiers were skeptical of their claims and attempted to arrest Jorad for desertion. Jorad defended his absence by saying he had important matters to attend to that benefited the Alliance and demonstrated his ability to wield the Light as evidence of his honesty and continuing loyalty to the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;. Jorad's commanding officer, &lt;a href=\"Irulon%20Trueblade\"&gt;Irulon Trueblade&lt;/a&gt;, vouched for Jorad and urged &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Duron\"&gt;Commander Duron&lt;/a&gt; to put the army on high alert. The &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; armies at the &lt;a href=\"Stair%20of%20Destiny\"&gt;Stair of Destiny&lt;/a&gt; shored up their defensive lines for the oncoming battle. Horde, Alliance, and Valwar's Broken tribe met with Ragnok's forces and engaged in battle. During the battle, a wild spell by Zzeraku destroyed the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, stopping Ragnok's forces from getting a foothold in &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nJorad killed an orc on a &lt;a href=\"nether%20ray\"&gt;nether ray&lt;/a&gt; and used the ray to get on top of the nether dragon that Ragnok was fighting on and engaged Ragnok directly. Ragnok attacked Jorad with magic, but he used the protective aura of the Light to deflect the death knight's spells. Jorad figured out that Ragnok had a device that linked the control collars used to enslave the nether dragons and smashed it to pieces. Afterward, he called on the Light and became a beacon of pure Light. Jorad called on the Light to bring judgment on Ragnok and incinerated the death knight with a blast of Light. With their leader dead and losing the nether dragons' support, the Alliance and Horde armies drove off the remains of Ragnok's forces.\nFollowing the battle, Tyri took the enthralled nether dragons to the &lt;a href=\"Nexus\"&gt;Nexus&lt;/a&gt; in the hopes of freeing them from their enthrallment. When she returned to Outland, Jorad rendezvoused with Tyri again, who after her failure with the nether dragons at the Nexus, decided to remain in Outland to teach and look after the next generation of nether drakes that would hatch from a new batch of nether eggs.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt;, Jorad could be seen at the &lt;a href=\"Celestial%20Ridge\"&gt;Celestial Ridge&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Netherstorm\"&gt;Netherstorm&lt;/a&gt;, along with &lt;a href=\"Tyrygosa\"&gt;Tyrygosa&lt;/a&gt; in her &lt;a href=\"elf\"&gt;elven&lt;/a&gt; form.\nLegion.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt;, Jorad joined the reborn Knights of the Silver Hand at the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20Light\"&gt;Sanctum of Light&lt;/a&gt;, beneath &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt;."}

He was exiled to the desert for an unspecified crime and was part of the same group of outcasts as &lt;a href=\"Rakera\"&gt;Warguard Rakera&lt;/a&gt;, who saved his life from &lt;a href=\"Grozztok%20the%20Blackheart\"&gt;Grozztok the Blackheart&lt;/a&gt; when &lt;a href=\"General%20Jakra%27zet\"&gt;General Jakra'zet&lt;/a&gt;'s assassins attacked the caravan.

He gives the last of his belongings to the adventurer so that they can gain entry into the temple and search for Rakera. \nFinally, Jorak tells the adventurer that he intends to rename himself &lt;a href=\"Akunda\"&gt;Akunda&lt;/a&gt; and live out the rest of his days at the temple, and asks the hero to deliver an unknown message to &lt;a href=\"B%27wizati\"&gt;B'wizati&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt;. When the adventurer returns to the temple, Jorak\u2014now known as Akunda the Unburdened\u2014has had his painful memories removed and states that he can no longer remember the crime that sent him to Vol'dun in the first place, nor does he remember anyone by the name B'wizati. After Akunda is freed, he regains his name of Jorak, but still does not remember B'wizati.\nJorak joined the &lt;a href=\"Dragonscale%20Expedition\"&gt;Dragonscale Expedition&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;, and is seen with &lt;a href=\"Meerah\"&gt;Meerah&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nisha\"&gt;Nisha&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Forkriver%20Crossing\"&gt;Forkriver Crossing&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Ohn%27ahran%20Plains\"&gt;Ohn'ahran Plains&lt;/a&gt;.

Thus suggesting that he was amongst the orcs afflicted with the red pox and subsequently quarantined in &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt;. In time, Jorin becomes known as the &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Bleeding%20Hollow%20clan\"&gt;Bleeding Hollow clan&lt;/a&gt;.\nBy the time of the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt;, the Bleeding Hollow village was &lt;a href=\"Bleeding%20Hollow%20Ruins\"&gt;destroyed&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Boulderfist%20clan\"&gt;Boulderfist clan&lt;/a&gt; who struck the village in the dead of night. Jorin escaped certain death and arrived at &lt;a href=\"Garadar\"&gt;Garadar&lt;/a&gt; in search of aid. However &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; refused to provide any assistance, as he had fallen into pessimism and despair over the fact that &lt;a href=\"Greatmother%20Geyah\"&gt;Greatmother Geyah&lt;/a&gt; was ill and that he was being looked at to serve the Mag'har's next leader, fearful that he would commit the mistakes of &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hellscream\"&gt;his father&lt;/a&gt;. Not deterred by Hellscream's despair, Jorin sent &lt;a href=\"Kilrath\"&gt;Kilrath&lt;/a&gt; to scout the ruins of their former home and sent &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;adventurers&lt;/a&gt; to seek him out and provide assistance.\nAs adventurers clashed against the ogres, they discovered that the Boulderfist had attacked the Bleeding Hollow as a result of seeking a new home after being pushed out of Nagrand by the &lt;a href=\"Warmaul\"&gt;Warmaul&lt;/a&gt; and that the Boulderfist had a new leader; &lt;a href=\"Lantresor%20of%20the%20Blade\"&gt;Lantresor of the Blade&lt;/a&gt;. Upon being informed of this, Jorin was unimpressed and questioned if Hellscream acting as an impotent whelp was a contributing factor in the ogres' decision to attack. He subsequently informed his Horde allies that ogres were moved by one thing: Might. Thus he ordered them to deliver a message to the Boulderfist with the only message that they were capable of understanding: Brutality.\nAfter slaying a number of Boulderfist, he instructed adventurers to serve as an envoy to Lantresor and request that he pull back his ogres. After the envoy and Lantresor came to an agreement and worked together, he decided to honor Jorin's request and sent a &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Blade%20Peace%20Offering\"&gt;peace offering&lt;/a&gt;.\nDragonflight.\nJorin and his &lt;a href=\"Bleeding%20Hollow%20clan\"&gt;Bleeding Hollow&lt;/a&gt; were among the orcs that attended the first &lt;a href=\"Kosh%27harg\"&gt;Kosh'harg&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Razor%20Hill\"&gt;Razor Hill&lt;/a&gt;, with Jorin remarking that this was his first time visiting &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, &lt;a href=\"Ariok\"&gt;Ariok&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock clan&lt;/a&gt; stated his intent to question Jorin if the Bleeding Hollow had a cure for the &lt;a href=\"blood%20magic\"&gt;blood magic&lt;/a&gt; ritual that turned him into a &lt;a href=\"Dire%20orc\"&gt;Dire orc&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Assault%20on%20the%20Dark%20Portal\"&gt;incursion&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"Tanaan%20Jungle\"&gt;Tanaan Jungle&lt;/a&gt;. Though it is unknown if such a conversation took place.\nWhat is known is that as the clan leaders gathered inside of the &lt;a href=\"Razor%20Hill%20Barracks\"&gt;Razor Hill Barracks&lt;/a&gt; to pitch their clan to prospective orcish recruits; Jorin remarked on how his clan is known for performing rituals that many would consider dark, that they didn't shy away from such tools, and that they know what fate has in store them and will do what they must to survive. Upon the champion requesting to join the Bleeding Hollow, Jorin stated that he had underestimated them. He subsequently instructed them with hunting, tracking, and killing &lt;a href=\"Gor%27krosh\"&gt;Gor'krosh&lt;/a&gt;, the Long Knives, without their armor, in order to test their skills in battle. Following their success, Jorin accepted the &lt;a href=\"%22Long%20Knife%22\"&gt;\"Long Knife\"&lt;/a&gt; as a trophy on behalf of his clan.\nDuring the feast celebrating orc champions for completing the &lt;a href=\"om%27gora\"&gt;om'gora&lt;/a&gt;, Jorin sat with the clan, where he revealed to them his intention to unify the clan and move them to Azeroth, as he recognized the future of the orcs being on Azeroth. As the Kosh'harg festival neared its ends, Jorin cheered orc champions as the champion of their people.\nQuotes.\nDo you know who we are, stranger?

The jormungar have perhaps the strangest diet; they grow strong by eating the eggs of their own kind and the best eggs come from deep jormungar.\nEach brood has a spawnmother living deep underground. The jormungar are a nuisance best dealt with quickly. If given any quarter, they breed like hares and spread like fire. There are multiple stages of jormungar: The &lt;a href=\"Jormungar%20Egg%20Sac\"&gt;egg sac&lt;/a&gt;, what the &lt;a href=\"Jormungar%20Tunneler\"&gt;Jormungar Tunneler&lt;/a&gt; is, the regular jormungar (called a jormungar larva in the model flies), and the jormungar wyrm (called just a jormungar in the model files). The wyrm stage is more ruggedly featured, and partially submerged at all times (with some exceptions). Before the above bestiary entry was added, the name of the unrevealed race as a whole was \"jormungar wyrm\".\nThe infamous &lt;a href=\"saronite\"&gt;saronite&lt;/a&gt; is vulnerable to the acid of the massive Jormungar.\nAs a battle pet.\n&lt;a href=\"Giant%20Worm%20Egg\"&gt;Giant Worm Egg&lt;/a&gt; has a chance to drop from the &lt;a href=\"Beasts%20of%20Northrend\"&gt;Beasts of Northrend&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Trial%20of%20the%20Crusader\"&gt;Trial of the Crusader&lt;/a&gt;.\nInspiration.\nThe name is a reference to or inspired by the World Serpent of Nordic mythology, , which was said to be so large that its tail had to be stuffed into its mouth to prevent it growing larger than the world. was one of the three children of Loki, the mischievous Aesir God of Nordic mythology. In the quest &lt;a href=\"The%20Slithering%20Darkness\"&gt;The Slithering Darkness&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Astrid%20Bjornrittar\"&gt;Astrid Bjornrittar&lt;/a&gt; calls the jormungar the children of &lt;a href=\"Loken\"&gt;Loken&lt;/a&gt;, whose name is inspired by Loki."}

One of the largest clans of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; before passing into &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, the Bleeding Hollow achieved legendary status for their participation in the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;s, during the latter of which they were tasked with occupying the &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarven&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnomish&lt;/a&gt; lands of &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;. Under the cunning leadership of their chieftain &lt;a href=\"Kilrogg%20Deadeye\"&gt;Kilrogg Deadeye&lt;/a&gt;, the Bleeding Hollow were one of the few clans to avoid capture by the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; after the Horde's defeat and later rejoined the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;old clans&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;. Those that stayed on Azeroth were captured and put in internment camps before being freed by &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;. Following Draenor's transformation into &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, many of the remaining Bleeding Hollow who did not escape back to Azeroth were transformed into &lt;a href=\"fel%20orc\"&gt;fel orc&lt;/a&gt;s and entered the service of the &lt;a href=\"Fel%20Horde\"&gt;Fel Horde&lt;/a&gt;, while another portion of the clan have joined the uncorrupted &lt;a href=\"Mag%27har%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Mag'har&lt;/a&gt; orcs at &lt;a href=\"Garadar\"&gt;Garadar&lt;/a&gt; under the leadership of Kilrogg's son, &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jorin%20Deadeye\"&gt;Jorin Deadeye&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nOrigin.\nRoughly 800 years before the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, some of the orcs who migrated out of &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Gorgrond&lt;/a&gt; settled in the jungles of &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Tanaan&lt;/a&gt;, later known as Hellfire Peninsula. Though there was no shortage of wild game, Tanaan was tremendously perilous, filled with &lt;a href=\"Primals\"&gt;Primals&lt;/a&gt;, poisonous plants and venomous animals. Furthermore, there were dark caves and hollows that seemed to vibrate with sinister, shadowy power. Sometimes the orcs who tapped into this essence found glory, but other times they found madness. Tanaan's orcs adopted a savage, superstitious mindset. Those who kept their sanity called themselves the Bleeding Hollow clan, while those who truly lost themselves to the dark impulses of the wilds were exiled and, over time, formed another, smaller clan known as the &lt;a href=\"Bonechewer%20clan\"&gt;Bonechewers&lt;/a&gt;. The two clans were never allies, but were also rarely at war. The jungle was a dangerous enough enemy for both.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Bleeding%20Hollow%20clan%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;alternate universe&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20Eyes\"&gt;Vault of Eyes&lt;/a&gt; contains at least 39 skulls of former Bleeding Hollow chieftains, as well as the skull of an unnamed &lt;a href=\"Skull%20of%20the%20Mad%20Chief\"&gt;mad chieftain&lt;/a&gt; and the ghosts of three former chieftains: &lt;a href=\"Braknoth\"&gt;Braknoth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Durmak\"&gt;Durmak&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vargrak\"&gt;Vargrak&lt;/a&gt;.\nRise of the Horde.\nAround 11 years before the First War, the Bleeding Hollow dwelled in the remote corners of Tanaan and faced many threats, from &lt;a href=\"botani\"&gt;botani&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"genesaur\"&gt;genesaur&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"arakkoa\"&gt;arakkoa&lt;/a&gt;. These enemies pushed the clan to the brink of extinction, until &lt;a href=\"Kilrogg%20Deadeye\"&gt;Kilrogg Deadeye&lt;/a&gt; came to power by gouging out his eye and murdering &lt;a href=\"Kilrogg%27s%20father\"&gt;his sickly father&lt;/a&gt; to take control of the ailing clan. Under his leadership, the orcs stormed through the jungles and eradicated their old enemies.\nShortly after &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; was named &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, he assigned specific roles to the various clans. The Bleeding Hollow were among the clans assigned to act as scouts, raiders and auxiliary forces that could quickly move from one region of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; to another.\nLater, Kilrogg and the Bleeding Hollow launched a campaign into &lt;a href=\"Farahlon\"&gt;Farahlon&lt;/a&gt;, a lush island serving as the last bastion of the Primals and one of the few places on Draenor unsullied by &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; magic. The forests there were dense, but Kilrogg and his followers were well adapted to fighting in such terrain. As the orcs were not seafarers, the orcish forces relied on &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt; shipwrights to build vessels capable of crossing the ocean. Once in Farahlon, orc &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s leeched life from the Primals and used the stolen power to set the forests ablaze while Kilrogg and his army slaughtered every botani and genesaur they could find.\nThe First War.\nRight after the opening of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, scouts from the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Tooth%20Grin%20clan\"&gt;Black Tooth Grin&lt;/a&gt; and Bleeding Hollow clans were sent by Blackhand to survey the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Morass\"&gt;Black Morass&lt;/a&gt; on the other side of the portal.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, Kilrogg and the Bleeding Hollow led a few raiding parties into the western jungles of &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt;, as the region reminded them of their ancestral home and they had aims of claiming it for themselves. However, the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20tribe\"&gt;Gurubashi&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"jungle%20troll\"&gt;jungle troll&lt;/a&gt;s who dwelled in the jungles united to fight back against this new threat and began a guerrilla campaign against the orcs. The fighting between the two groups was unspeakably vicious. While the Bleeding Hollow seemed to outnumber the Gurubashi in every skirmish, they were still at a severe disadvantage against the trolls' knowledge of the region. The Gurubashi were willing to give up vast swathes of jungle to draw the orcs deeper into their territory, only to then launch bloody ambushes from all directions, resulting in horrific losses for the Bleeding Hollow. When Blackhand learned how many orcs were dying in Stranglethorn for no apparent gain, he ordered the Bleeding Hollow to retreat and join the fight against the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s. The Horde would deal with the trolls later.\nLater still, Blackhand ordered Kilrogg and &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; clan to lead an assault against &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; itself. After the Horde bombarded the city's walls with siege engines through the night, Kilrogg and Cho'gall launched their attack at dawn. Orcs charged the battlements while warlocks engulfed Stormwind's soldiers in fel fire, and it seemed like the city would fall by midday. However, &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt; led a charge of &lt;a href=\"knight\"&gt;knight&lt;/a&gt;s through &lt;a href=\"Elwynn%20Forest\"&gt;Elwynn Forest&lt;/a&gt; and launched an attack on the orcs' rear lines, forcing the Bleeding Hollow and Twilight's Hammer to break off their aggression and try to push back the knights. When Stormwind's gates opened and soldiers poured of the city, the orcs were forced to flee from the two-pronged assault. It was the biggest disaster the Horde had ever suffered, and Blackhand only restrained himself from executing Kilrogg and Cho'gall because he suspected their clan members would revolt. The Horde instead withdrew to the &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt; to draw up a new conquest plan.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; and Garona were fleeing from &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; toward the end of the war, they traveled through &lt;a href=\"Elwynn%20Forest\"&gt;Elwynn Forest&lt;/a&gt; and met a patrol of Bleeding Hollow &lt;a href=\"grunt\"&gt;grunt&lt;/a&gt;s. Garona managed to save Khadgar's lives by pretending he was her slave, which the grunts took as meaning his sexual slave. The patrol was later destroyed by human &lt;a href=\"knight\"&gt;knight&lt;/a&gt;s near a ruined watch tower.\nThe Second War.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, the Horde swept over the region of &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;, pushing its &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarven&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnomish&lt;/a&gt; inhabitants back to their respective capitals: &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt;. However, as the two cities themselves proved impenetrable \u2014 Ironforge due to its fierce dwarven defenders and Gnomeregan due of its iron gate \u2014 Warchief &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; eventually called off the attacks. Instead, he stationed the Bleeding Hollow outside the gates of Ironforge and Gnomeregan to keep the dwarves and gnomes &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Ironforge\"&gt;contained&lt;/a&gt;, while orcs from the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock clan&lt;/a&gt; began mining the surrounding mountains and commandeering the dwarves' forges in preparation for the invasion of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; to the north.\nKilrogg and the Bleeding Hollow continued to keep the two races confined in their mountain cities throughout the war, and were also granted the honor of overseeing the &lt;a href=\"oil%20refinery\"&gt;oil refinement&lt;/a&gt; operations in the region, such as at &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;. When the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; pushed the Horde south into Khaz Modan, Orgrim told Kilrogg and his forces to remain in the occupied lands to delay the Alliance army and prevent it from smashing into the Horde's rearguard. However, shortly afterward the Alliance soldiers poured into Khaz Modan and made short work of the Bleeding Hollow, with &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s leading hunting parties to root out the orcs and drive them from the region. In the process, Ironforge and Gnomeregan were liberated and pledged their forces to the Alliance.\nThe Bleeding Hollow did not reach &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt; in time to join Doomhammer's forces during the Horde's last stand against the Alliance, and instead witnessed the aftermath as some of the defeated Horde soldiers stumbled to the Dark Portal. The Alliance army barred Kilrogg's way toward the portal, and he chose to pull his clan back rather than risk a suicidal charge. The orcs quietly disappeared into the wilds north of the gateway to plan their next move. Some time thereafter, &lt;a href=\"Dal%27rend%20Blackhand\"&gt;Dal'rend&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Maim%20Blackhand\"&gt;Maim Blackhand&lt;/a&gt;, barricaded at Blackrock Spire, reached out to other groups of Horde survivors in an attempt to rally them under the brothers' &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Horde\"&gt;own banner&lt;/a&gt;. Kilrogg ignored them, for he knew that his destiny did not lie with their \"false\" Horde.\nBeyond the Dark Portal.\nThe Bleeding Hollow continued watching over the &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt; surrounding the Portal for any sign of the Horde's return. They were the only clan left unaccounted for, as the cunning Kilrogg managed to evade the best efforts of the Alliance to capture his clan. &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;Elven&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"scout\"&gt;scout&lt;/a&gt;s were placed on continual patrol within the Black Morass, searching for any sign of the renegade Bleeding Hollow, while an elite cadre of &lt;a href=\"elven%20ranger\"&gt;elven ranger&lt;/a&gt;s under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; attempted to hunt the orcs down.\nIn the year following that of the Horde's fracturing, &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; reopened the Dark Portal from the Draenor side. &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grommash Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; led the spear tip of the Horde's invasion force into the Blasted Lands, accompanied by &lt;a href=\"Teron%20Gorefiend\"&gt;Teron Gorefiend&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s. Kilrogg and his clan met with the invasion force and gave them invaluable information about what had happened on Azeroth after the Second War. Gorefiend ordered Kilrogg and his people back to Draenor, for they had fought for survival since the end of the war and they deserved time to rest. The Bleeding Hollow brought some &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;forest troll&lt;/a&gt;s and other Azerothian allies with them to Draenor.\nThe Bleeding Hollow did as Gorefiend commanded and rejoined the 'old clans' on Draenor. To many, the warriors of the Bleeding Hollow were considered mighty heroes for surviving their time in the human lands. Kilrogg met with Ner'zhul, who informed the Bleeding Hollow chieftain of his plan to open portals to new worlds using artifacts from Azeroth.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Lothar\"&gt;Alliance forces&lt;/a&gt; later &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;invaded&lt;/a&gt; Draenor and claimed the Dark Portal, Ner'zhul began leading most of his forces from &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Citadel\"&gt;Hellfire Citadel&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Valley\"&gt;Shadowmoon Valley&lt;/a&gt;. At the edge of the &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Wastes\"&gt;Bone Wastes&lt;/a&gt;, the orcs came under bombardment from Alliance &lt;a href=\"gryphon%20rider\"&gt;gryphon rider&lt;/a&gt;s, forcing them to retreat to the ruined tomb-city of &lt;a href=\"Auchindoun\"&gt;Auchindoun&lt;/a&gt;, which housed little-used passageways leading to Shadowmoon Valley. The gryphon riders launched a new attack, but their leader &lt;a href=\"Kurdran%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Kurdran Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt; was knocked from his mount, captured by the Horde and taken inside Auchindoun for interrogation by Kilrogg. &lt;a href=\"Danath%20Trollbane\"&gt;Danath Trollbane&lt;/a&gt;'s ground forces soon arrived, and with the help of the gryphon riders and some unexpected aid in the form of a group of &lt;a href=\"arakkoa\"&gt;arakkoa&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Grizzik\"&gt;Grizzik&lt;/a&gt;, they stormed into Auchindoun and liberated Kurdran. However, Ner'zhul was nowhere to be found. Kilrogg and the remnants of the Bleeding Hollow clan had volunteered to stay behind and occupy the Alliance while the rest of the Horde continued to the Black Temple. Kilrogg was driven to make this sacrifice not simply because of nobility, but because he knew from the ritual he had performed in his youth that Auchindoun was the place where he would die. The Bleeding Hollow fell upon the Alliance forces. In the midst of the bloody battle, Danath confronted and dueled Kilrogg until he managed to plunge his blade through the orc's throat. With their chieftain dead, the rest of the Bleeding Hollow scattered or surrendered, but Kilrogg's sacrifice had given Ner'zhul's forces enough time to safely reach the Black Temple.\nWhen Draenor began to break apart as a result of Ner'zhul's disastrous ritual, many Bleeding Hollow fled back to Azeroth via the Dark Potal just before the gateway was destroyed by &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;. Once on Azeroth, the Bleeding Hollow were rounded up by the Alliance and placed in &lt;a href=\"internment%20camps\"&gt;internment camps&lt;/a&gt; in Lordaeron alongside the other defeated clans. These orcs would later be freed by Thrall and join the modern &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, however like many clans there is no mention of the Bleeding Hollow orcs having a strong clan identity within the Horde.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nThe Bleeding Hollow orcs survived Draenor's transformation into &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; and many were eventually transformed into fel orcs, willingly or otherwise, coming into the service of the &lt;a href=\"Fel%20Horde\"&gt;Fel Horde&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt;. The stronghold of &lt;a href=\"Zeth%27Gor\"&gt;Zeth'Gor&lt;/a&gt; served as the cursed abode of the Bleeding Hollow, though both &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; forces tasked &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s with putting the bastion to the torch. &lt;a href=\"Wing%20Commander%20Dabir%27ee\"&gt;Wing Commander Dabir'ee&lt;/a&gt; told Alliance heroes to place smoke beacons at several towers in the town to direct the fire of the &lt;a href=\"gryphon%20rider\"&gt;gryphon rider&lt;/a&gt;s, while &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Darkhowl\"&gt;Captain Darkhowl&lt;/a&gt; simply asked Horde heroes to use the torches of slain Bleeding Hollow &lt;a href=\"peon\"&gt;peon&lt;/a&gt;s to set fire to several buildings. The Bleeding Hollow warlord &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Morkh\"&gt;Morkh&lt;/a&gt; was then slain by Alliance adventurers while Horde champions ensorcelled a &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Grillok\"&gt;floating eye&lt;/a&gt; of the Bleeding Hollow witch &lt;a href=\"Grillok%20%22Darkeye%22\"&gt;Grillok \"Darkeye\"&lt;/a&gt; before slaying the orc himself and bringing his eyepatch to &lt;a href=\"Zezzak\"&gt;Zezzak&lt;/a&gt;. The head of &lt;a href=\"Worg%20Master%20Kruush\"&gt;Worg Master Kruush&lt;/a&gt;, who led the worg riders of the Bleeding Hollow clan, was also brought to Darkhowl. A number of Bleeding Hollow troops can also be found in the &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Ramparts\"&gt;Hellfire Ramparts&lt;/a&gt; of Hellfire Citadel.\nMany Bleeding Hollow collected the insignias of fallen &lt;a href=\"Honor%20Hold\"&gt;Honor Hold&lt;/a&gt; soldiers and created cursed talismans from them. The forces of Honor Hold suspected that the orcs' dark magic transformed the insignias into evil charms to be used against the Alliance. &lt;a href=\"Corporal%20Ironridge\"&gt;Corporal Ironridge&lt;/a&gt; asked Alliance adventurers to acquire several of these cursed talismans so that they could be disposed of, and so that the soldiers who once owned them could be honored for their sacrifices.\n&lt;a href=\"Apothecary%20Zelana\"&gt;Apothecary Zelana&lt;/a&gt; tasked Horde adventures with delivering a sample of Bleeding Hollow blood to her colleague, &lt;a href=\"Apothecary%20Albreck\"&gt;Apothecary Albreck&lt;/a&gt;, for study. Albreck then asked the adventurers to gather more blood from the forces at Zeth'Gor, boil the liquid in the orcs' cursed cauldron and bring the final results back to him. Using the findings from these efforts, Albreck was able to put together a report to his colleague, &lt;a href=\"Apothecary%20Antonivich\"&gt;Apothecary Antonivich&lt;/a&gt;, hypothesising that the fel orcs' corruption stemmed from &lt;a href=\"Magtheridon\"&gt;a pit lord&lt;/a&gt; similar in power to &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt;, the demon who was responsible for the original &lt;a href=\"blood-curse\"&gt;blood-curse&lt;/a&gt;.\nAnother group of Bleeding Hollow, unaffected by corruption, lived in a &lt;a href=\"Bleeding%20Hollow%20Ruins\"&gt;settlement&lt;/a&gt; on the border between &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt; and southwestern &lt;a href=\"Terokkar%20Forest\"&gt;Terokkar Forest&lt;/a&gt; under the leadership of Kilrogg's son &lt;a href=\"Jorin%20Deadeye\"&gt;Jorin Deadeye&lt;/a&gt;. When the village suffered a nighttime attack by &lt;a href=\"Boulderfist%20clan\"&gt;Boulderfist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s, these Bleeding Hollow were forced to flee to &lt;a href=\"Garadar\"&gt;Garadar&lt;/a&gt;, home village of the uncorrupted &lt;a href=\"Mag%27har%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Mag'har&lt;/a&gt; orcs in &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt;. To Jorin's great frustration, the Mag'har leader, &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, refused to lend his assistance. Instead, the scout &lt;a href=\"Kilrath\"&gt;Kilrath&lt;/a&gt; was dispatched to the ruins of the village and Horde adventurers were sent to assist him. The adventurers learned from &lt;a href=\"Unkor%20the%20Ruthless\"&gt;Unkor the Ruthless&lt;/a&gt;, the ogre leader in the ruins, that the Boulderfist were being exterminated and forced out of Nagrand by a new ogre clan known as the &lt;a href=\"Warmaul\"&gt;Warmaul&lt;/a&gt;. This led to a series of events in which the Horde adventurer successfully assisted the Boulderfist leader \u2014 &lt;a href=\"Lantresor%20of%20the%20Blade\"&gt;Lantresor of the Blade&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 with creating conflict between the Warmaul and &lt;a href=\"Kil%27sorrow%20clan\"&gt;Kil'sorrow&lt;/a&gt; clans, though Garrosh was still unmoved.\nDragonflight.\nThe Bleeding Hollow clan was one of the orcish clans in attendance at the first &lt;a href=\"Kosh%27harg\"&gt;Kosh'harg&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Razor%20Hill\"&gt;Razor Hill&lt;/a&gt;, represented by the chieftain, &lt;a href=\"Jorin%20Deadeye\"&gt;Jorin Deadeye&lt;/a&gt; and a number of their members. Meanwhile &lt;a href=\"Ariok\"&gt;Ariok&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock clan&lt;/a&gt; stated his intent to question if the Bleeding Hollow had a cure for the &lt;a href=\"blood%20magic\"&gt;blood magic&lt;/a&gt; ritual that turned him into a &lt;a href=\"dire%20orc\"&gt;dire orc&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Assault%20on%20the%20Dark%20Portal\"&gt;incursion&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"Tanaan%20Jungle\"&gt;Tanaan Jungle&lt;/a&gt;, during the festival. Though it is unknown if such a conversation took place.\nWhat is known is that as the clan leaders gathered inside of the &lt;a href=\"Razor%20Hill%20Barracks\"&gt;Razor Hill Barracks&lt;/a&gt; to pitch their clan to prospective orcish recruits; Jorin remarked on how his is known for performing rituals that many would consider dark, that they didn't shy away from such tools, and that they know what fate has in store them and will do what they must to survive. Upon the champion requesting to join the Bleeding Hollow, Jorin stated that he had underestimated them. He subsequently instructed them with hunting, tracking, and killing &lt;a href=\"Gor%27krosh\"&gt;Gor'krosh&lt;/a&gt;, the Long Knives, without their armor, in order to test their skills in battle. Following their success, Eitrigg accepted the &lt;a href=\"%22Long%20Knife%22\"&gt;\"Long Knife\"&lt;/a&gt; as a trophy on behalf of his clan.\nDuring the feast celebrating orc champions for completing the &lt;a href=\"om%27gora\"&gt;om'gora&lt;/a&gt;, Jorin sat with clan, where he revealed to them his intention to unify the clan and move them to Azeroth, as he recognized the future of the orcs being on Azeroth.\nPeople and culture.\nOn Draenor, the highly superstitious Bleeding Hollow were much different than other clans and practiced dark rituals in the remote corners of Tanaan Jungle. As they were an insular clan living in one of the most hostile parts of Draenor, they had little contact with the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;. Generations of surviving in a jungle beset by the remnants of the &lt;a href=\"Evergrowth\"&gt;Evergrowth&lt;/a&gt; instilled a savage instinct into the orcs' warfare and the Bleeding Hollow embodied the unrelenting savagery required for many long years of successful orcish warfare.\nMembers of the Bleeding Hollow imbued themselves with berserk fury, slathering their weapons in hallucinogenic venom and stalking prey from the treetops, branding their victims' final moments with visions of pure horror. The clan was infamous for their use of &lt;a href=\"blood%20magic\"&gt;blood magic&lt;/a&gt;, described by &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Hunter%20Denjai\"&gt;Shadow Hunter Denjai&lt;/a&gt; as \"like &lt;a href=\"voodoo\"&gt;voodoo&lt;/a&gt; but it hurt more\". The orcs carved blood sigils into their own flesh with &lt;a href=\"Bleeding%20Hollow%20Ritual%20Blade\"&gt;curved ceremonial blades&lt;/a&gt;, created potions from the blood of their strongest warriors and used savage blood magic to transform their warriors into &lt;a href=\"dire%20orc\"&gt;hulking berserkers&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Bleeding Hollow found truth in the surety of their deaths. Upon ascension to ruler of the clan, each Bleeding Hollow chieftain undertook a &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;ic vision quest in which they sacrificed their own eye to receive a vision of their own death, but sometimes the vision would show much more. This practice allowed the chieftains to live their life without fear, for they knew the exact day of their demise. The clan is named after the &lt;a href=\"Bleeding%20Hollow%20Cave\"&gt;secret chamber&lt;/a&gt; below Tanaan where this ritual was traditionally performed. After the ritual, all chieftains would place their eye under the protection of the clan's ghosts in the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20Eyes\"&gt;Vault of Eyes&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn Warcraft II.\nChieftain: \"&lt;a href=\"Kilrogg%20Deadeye\"&gt;Kilrogg Deadeye&lt;/a&gt;\"\nClan Colors: \"Green\"\nBackground: \"The Bleeding Hollow clan was one of the largest in the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; before passing into &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Led by the aged Kilrogg, the Bleeding Hollow embodies the unrelenting savagery required for many long years of successful &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;ish warfare. In accordance with their unequaled performance in battle, they have been given the honor of safeguarding the &lt;a href=\"Oil%20refinery\"&gt;refinement&lt;/a&gt; operations in the occupied lands of &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;.

This valley is the home to &lt;a href=\"House%20Stormsong\"&gt;House Stormsong&lt;/a&gt; and is the breadbasket of Kul Tiras. These verdant highlands and foothills provide Kul Tiras with food as well as ship production. The Stormsong builds and blesses all Kul Tiran vessels, and &lt;a href=\"Tidesage\"&gt;Tidesage&lt;/a&gt;s from Sagehold board the largest ones for guidance at sea.\n&lt;a href=\"Lumber\"&gt;Lumber&lt;/a&gt; comes in from the forests north of Tiragarde Sound, and it gets floated down the Twin Rivers to Mariner's Strand, the Kul Tiras's hub of ship production. There are a number of businesses devoted to &lt;a href=\"Boat\"&gt;ship&lt;/a&gt; production on the island, most notably the Brineworks and Addington Shipyards.\nRecently, a number of events like House Stormsong's fall to &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s invasions, and aggression from the &lt;a href=\"Briarback%20tribe\"&gt;Briarback&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"quilboar\"&gt;quilboar&lt;/a&gt; have heralded a time of chaos for the inhabitants of the valley. The &lt;a href=\"Storm%27s%20Wake\"&gt;Storm's Wake&lt;/a&gt; is a militia group that has taken up arms to protect the people of Stormsong against these threats. This group is mainly based out of the largest and most central town, &lt;a href=\"Brennadam\"&gt;Brennadam&lt;/a&gt;. \nHistory.\nIt is ruled by &lt;a href=\"House%20Stormsong\"&gt;House Stormsong&lt;/a&gt;, and the people of the region are devoted to the sea with a fanatical, religious fervor. This includes the religious sect known as the &lt;a href=\"Tidesages\"&gt;Tidesages&lt;/a&gt;. It was the current Lord Stormsong's father who led the Tidesages to the valley. Stormsong Valley contributes the largest amount of ships\u2013and of the highest quality\u2013to Kul Tiras, and the Tidesages bless each ship methodically. All of its people are devoted to this singular endeavor, but recent troubles have led to a stoppage of construction. The &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; will need to get to the bottom of this to secure their new navy.\nGeography.\nStormsong Valley's southern extent is created by a range of tall, pointed mountain peaks which separate the region from Tiragarde Sound and the rest of Kul Tiras. The city of Brennadam sits just north of the Highland Pass, the region's only passable connection through these mountains. Far to the west of the pass and in the mountain foothills, Widow's Peak rises above Sprucewood, where a group of &lt;a href=\"ettin\"&gt;ettin&lt;/a&gt;s call home. Between the peak and the mountain range is the Briarback Kraul, a gorge settled by the Briarback quillboar. Beyond that, the western extent of the foothills ends with Beryl Meadow and the Roaring Highland. Here, the Kul Tirans have settled Millstone Hamlet and Seabreeze Village.\nStormsong Valley's northern extent is formed by a range of smaller peaks, comprising (from west to east) Gale's Rest, Stormwatch Peak, Tidebreak Summit, and the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20the%20Storm\"&gt;Shrine of the Storm&lt;/a&gt;. Gale's Rest is accessible via Shatterfall Pass, which leads directly to the Horde's settlement &lt;a href=\"Warfang%20Hold\"&gt;Warfang Hold&lt;/a&gt; and the Clearcut. Numerous rivers drain through the Tidebreak Foothills. Rising from the waters northeast of Kraken's Reach is the mountainous &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20the%20Storm\"&gt;Shrine of the Storm&lt;/a&gt;, known to be the seat of power for both &lt;a href=\"House%20Stormsong\"&gt;House Stormsong&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"tidesages\"&gt;tidesages&lt;/a&gt;. Its very foundations are carved into the rocky outcroppings, and the face of the &lt;a href=\"kraken\"&gt;kraken&lt;/a&gt; adorns its ancient structures.\nBetween these ranges are the verdant, boulder-strewn hills of Stormsong Valley proper. The valley is divided by the Windshorn Hills, where Brennadam is. To the west of the divide is a former bay, recently by the Kul Tirans to provide for more farmland. In its current state, the bay comprises the Briny Flats and the Drowned Lands, and in the middle is the town of Deadwash. The lev\u00e9e at Eventide Delta is protected by Fort Daelin.\nTo the east of the Windshorn Hills, rivers drain through foothills and highlands into Kraken's Reach. A shallow island called Mariner's Strand serves as Kul Tiras's primary hub for ship construction. South of the strand are the foothills which boast Rosaline's Apiary and the Mildenhall Meadery, and further southwest (in the direction of Highland Pass) are the dangerous Highland Flats and Scalespine Hill. North of Mariner's Strand is the village of Tidecross, with Port Fogtide to its east. Above the port, high in the Tidebreak Foothills, is the city of &lt;a href=\"Sagehold\"&gt;Sagehold&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe lands of Stormsong Valley are lush with green grasses and rock-strewn rolling hills. Wildlife and plant growth thrive here, fed by the inland streams and the invigorating sea air. It is a region made rich by the harmony between both land and sea. The &lt;a href=\"Highland%20Pass\"&gt;Highland Pass&lt;/a&gt; is the only land route into Stormsong Valley, but a blockade halts passage between &lt;a href=\"Brennadam\"&gt;Brennadam&lt;/a&gt; and the rest of &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;. On the western coast, &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Daelin\"&gt;Fort Daelin&lt;/a&gt; protects a levee holding back the sea from &lt;a href=\"Deadwash\"&gt;sinking the area&lt;/a&gt;. Emboldened by the soldiers neglecting their duties, the territorial &lt;a href=\"quilboar\"&gt;quilboar&lt;/a&gt; are encroaching on the south.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

You\u2019re tasked with reclaiming his family heritage... and his beer.\nIt is the brewery of &lt;a href=\"Chen%20Stormstout\"&gt;Chen Stormstout&lt;/a&gt;'s ancestors.\nBackground.\nMists of Pandaria.\nFor generations, the Stormstout Brewery has been a font of joy for the citizens of Pandaria, pumping out an endless-seeming supply of delicious and refined beverages without appearing to break stride. The Stormstout family has enjoyed and supported the Brewery's continued significance, and kept diligent watch over their recipes and the perfection of their stills \u2013 until today. In the absence of any more able Stormstout, management of the building has recently fallen to &lt;a href=\"Uncle%20Gao\"&gt;Uncle Gao Stormstout&lt;/a&gt;... to the detriment of everyone who has ever enjoyed a cold drink. On Gao's \"watch,\" loathsome &lt;a href=\"virmen\"&gt;virmen&lt;/a&gt; have broken through the brewery's massive oak doors and ravaged the Stormstout's stores of rice and barley; local &lt;a href=\"hozen\"&gt;hozen&lt;/a&gt; have also begun cracking into casks left and right, spurring a destructive revel that threatens to devastate the Valley's supply. As if that weren\u2019t enough, the brew itself has begun to spoil \u2013 in the worst way possible.\n&lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s of the Alliance and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; entered the brewery and dealt with intruders. Chen Stormstout reunited with Uncle Gao.\nVol'jin: Shadows of the Horde.\nChen Stormstout remained on Pandaria and helped with fixing up the place. Later, &lt;a href=\"Tswen-luo%20Sageflower\"&gt;Tswen-luo Sageflower&lt;/a&gt;, learning of Chen's earlier determination that &lt;a href=\"Zouchin%20Village\"&gt;Zouchin&lt;/a&gt;, with its readily available resources, would be the perfect location for a small satellite brewery of Stormstout Brewery, agreed to finance it in return for a modest profit share and a bottomless mug. After the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari troll&lt;/a&gt;s attacked the village, the Sageflowers would be among the refugees escorted by &lt;a href=\"Yalia%20Sagewhisper\"&gt;Yalia Sagewhisper&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Li%20Li%20Stormstout\"&gt;Li Li Stormstout&lt;/a&gt; to stay at Stormstout Brewery, where they would be able to learn about operating the future Zouchin brewery.\nLegion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the Brewery was infiltrated by &lt;a href=\"Varagol%20the%20Coercer\"&gt;Varagol the Coercer&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Brewmaster%20Blanche\"&gt;Brewmaster Blanche&lt;/a&gt; was murdered here. &lt;a href=\"Monk\"&gt;Monk&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Broken%20Temple\"&gt;Order of the Broken Temple&lt;/a&gt; entered it and defeated the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nDungeon Journal.\n\"When Chen Stormstout arrived in the Valley of the Four Winds, he journeyed to the renowned brewery of his namesake, hoping to connect with his relatives. What he found was his ancestral home in disarray. Under the watch of the incompetent Uncle Gao, loathsome virmen and unruly hozen have infiltrated the brewery, sparking a destructive revel that will soon devastate the region's supply of tasty beer.\"\nOverview.\nAs you enter the Brewery, you see Auntie and Chen Stormstout. Chen questions Auntie about the state of the brewery, but has little success in doing so as Auntie appears to be senile to some extent. Pressing onward, adventurers will find a party of Hozen. In order to fight the first boss Ook-Ook, players must defeat 40 partying Hozen. Doing so will trigger the fight with Ook-Ook. The next wing of the instance will feature Vermin. A few of the Vermin carry hammers that can be used a few times to make wading through their massive numbers easier. After pushing through the hordes of Vermin, the second boss, Hoptallus can be fought. Upon his defeat, the carrot blocking the path will be moved, and players can finally move to the final wing of the instance, the distillery. Here, players will fight a variety of alementals, or elementals made of beer. These alementals all have unique abilities that will be prevalent in the final boss fight, so be sure to commit these to memory. Making it to the tasting room, players will find Uncle Gao brewing up something new, creating alementals in the process. Dealing with these as normal, players will eventually be challenged by a monumental alemental named Yan-Zhu the Uncasked. Yan-Zhu summons all of the lesser alementals in the battle, so be wary of them as they appear. After Yan-Zhu falls, Gao will be confronted by Chen, who gets into a brief, and mildly humorous, confrontation with Gao. With this, the Stormstout Brewery is finally at peace.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

Originally settled by descendants of the &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20tribe\"&gt;Arathi&lt;/a&gt;, Stormwind flourished until the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt; when it was conquered and laid waste by the &lt;a href=\"Orcish%20Horde\"&gt;Orcish Horde&lt;/a&gt;. The survivors of that conflict, led by &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt;, sought refuge in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, but were able to reclaim their homeland at the end of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; with the aid of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. Since the fall of the &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;kingdom of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the kingdom of Stormwind has become the strongest bastion of humanity and the most powerful force in the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Grand Alliance&lt;/a&gt;.\nStormwind is ruled by the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Wrynn\"&gt;House of Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Azeroth\"&gt;their court&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt;. The throne is currently occupied by &lt;a href=\"King%20Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, succeeding his father &lt;a href=\"King%20Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; who died at the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;. Also aiding in the governing of Stormwind is the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Nobles\"&gt;House of Nobles&lt;/a&gt;: the bureaucracy of Stormwind's government that currently aids the king in the running of the kingdom's day-to-day affairs.\nHistory.\nFounding and prosperity.\nThe kingdom of Stormwind was originally founded 1,200 years before the First War by the descendants of the &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20tribe\"&gt;Arathi&lt;/a&gt; bloodline, who had migrated south from the nation of &lt;a href=\"Arathor\"&gt;Arathor&lt;/a&gt;. Traveling past the rocky mountains of &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;, their journey finally ended after many long seasons, and they settled in the northern region of the continent they would name &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28continent%29\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. In a fertile valley, they founded the kingdom of Stormwind, which quickly became a self-sufficient power in its own right. \nWhile it was initially the smallest and most isolated human nation, over the years it found prosperity through the farmsteads that dotted the surrounding fertile region. As Stormwind's population grew small towns sprung up nearby &lt;a href=\"Elwynn%20Forest\"&gt;Elwynn Forest&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Brightwood\"&gt;Brightwood&lt;/a&gt;, and the breadbasket of the kingdom, &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt;. Over the decades devout &lt;a href=\"cleric\"&gt;cleric&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Holy%20Light\"&gt;Church of the Holy Light&lt;/a&gt; had ventured south from Lordaeron to spread their faith. Upon reaching Stormwind the pious individuals founded the &lt;a href=\"Clerics%20of%20Northshire\"&gt;Holy Order of Northshire Clerics&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe kingdom was served loyally by the knights of the &lt;a href=\"Brotherhood%20of%20the%20Horse\"&gt;Brotherhood of the Horse&lt;/a&gt;. Secretive &lt;a href=\"conjurer\"&gt;conjurer&lt;/a&gt;s also served the kingdom, and as such &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt; had its own &lt;a href=\"Court%20Conjurer\"&gt;court conjurer&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; was also present in the kingdom, as &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt; was acquainted with their fellow wizards in the realm. \nThe constant bickering and infighting that marred the rules of the former kings of Arathor had no place in the court of Wrynn, and all had been peaceful for many generations in the kingdom until the &lt;a href=\"Gnoll%20War\"&gt;Gnoll War&lt;/a&gt;. King &lt;a href=\"Barathen%20Wrynn\"&gt;Barathen Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; ended the conflict by scattering the unified &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt; packs and bringing back peace, solidifying the rule of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Wrynn\"&gt;Wrynn dynasty&lt;/a&gt; over the entire kingdom. The great victory they had achieved \u2014 without the aid of &lt;a href=\"Seven%20Kingdoms\"&gt;others&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 further cemented a sense of independence and self-sufficiency among the population. As a result, Stormwind would continue to become even more distant from the other human nations, confident that they were capable of successfully dealing with any danger that arose to threaten their security.\nFollowing the Gnoll War, having rebuilt and repaired the parts of the nation destroyed by the war, the Kingdom of Stormwind began expanding its borders, much to the displeasure of the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20tribe\"&gt;Gurubashi&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"jungle%20troll\"&gt;jungle troll&lt;/a&gt; tribes. A series of smaller conflicts between the two factions erupted over time, largely over the territories bordering &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt; that Stormwindian settlers began expanding into. Though initially isolated, the conflict quickly escalated out of control, despite the best efforts of Stormwind's &lt;a href=\"Barathen%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Barathen Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;. The final provocation came when &lt;a href=\"Llane%20Wrynn\"&gt;Prince Llane Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; personally led a small party to strike at the Gurubashi leadership in central Stranglethorn, which succeeded in uniting the trolls against Stormwind. Though costly and close-run, the human kingdom eventually emerged victorious, largely due to the intervention of the &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;. With the entire troll army completely destroyed or routed at the gates of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"jungle%20troll\"&gt;jungle troll&lt;/a&gt;s of the south would never succeed in threatening the kingdom again. This bloody conflict was known as the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20War\"&gt;Gurubashi War&lt;/a&gt;, and the Stormwindians enjoyed nearly two decades of relative peace after emerging victorious. King Barathen was one of the casualties of the Gurubashi War, and Llane succeeded him as king in the aftermath of the war.\nAt some point, the humans established a small port called &lt;a href=\"Blackwater%20Cove\"&gt;Blackwater Cove&lt;/a&gt; in the south of Stranglethorn Vale. It was, however, overrun by jungle trolls. Eventually, the trolls were defeated by the &lt;a href=\"Steamwheedle%20Cartel\"&gt;Steamwheedle Cartel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s who took control of the port, renaming it to Booty Bay.\nThe last years before the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s arrival were considered a golden age for Stormwind. Under Llane's leadership the kingdom was peaceful and prosperous, and was now one of the mightiest human nations despite also being the youngest.\nAt the time, &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt; would host many galas for the &lt;a href=\"Nobles%20of%20Stormwind\"&gt;nobles from around Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, who came to regard &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;'s parties as exclusive high-society events. The guests were awed by the wonders of the enchanted tower, and their happiness even lifted the Guardian's mood. However, Medivh was possessed by &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; and continued to hide this corruption behind a lavish lifestyle, still inviting many nobles to party down in Karazhan. When &lt;a href=\"Arcanagos\"&gt;Arcanagos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt; confronted Medivh, this night the tower was crowded with nobles who were expecting a gala. When the son and mother started fighting, their powers were shaking the tower to its foundations and caused the would-be revelers to flee. As Aegwynn slowly gained the upper hand, Medivh resorted to draining the life of hundreds of people fleeing the tower in order to fuel his strength, leaving Karazhan a haunted tower of madness populated by ghosts. Among the victims were some of the most important nobles of Stormwind.\nStill corrupted by the Dark Titan, Medivh also cursed &lt;a href=\"Ariden\"&gt;Ariden&lt;/a&gt; and a group of charlatan &lt;a href=\"merchant\"&gt;merchant&lt;/a&gt;s who sold counterfeit artifacts. From their base at &lt;a href=\"Ariden%27s%20Camp\"&gt;Ariden's Camp&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Deadwind%20Pass\"&gt;Deadwind Pass&lt;/a&gt;, they attempted to cheat the Guardian by selling those fraudulent items. In revenge for their trickery, Medivh cursed the group to forever hunt real magical artifacts and bring them back to him at &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt;. It is not known exactly what curse Medivh placed on them, or if they are undead or not, but the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Riders\"&gt;Dark Riders&lt;/a&gt; have haunted the kingdom of Stormwind since that moment.\nFirst War.\nWhen reports of mysterious creatures lurking around the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Morass\"&gt;Black Morass&lt;/a&gt; reached Stormwind, rumors spread through the streets that they were either vengeful spirits, &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s armed with some new breed of power, or a strange race from across the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Llane%20Wrynn%20I\"&gt;King Llane&lt;/a&gt; dispatched Sir &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt; to uncover what these new creatures were. Lothar led a small force of the &lt;a href=\"Brotherhood%20of%20the%20Horse\"&gt;Knights of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; to scout the Black Morass, resulting in humans clashing with &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s for the first time in a series of bloody skirmishes. Lothar and his men scored a number of small victories, yet for every orc killed two more seemed to take its place. The humans were more outnumbered in each subsequent battle, and Lothar was eventually forced to pull back without venturing deep enough into the heavily guarded Black Morass to find the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;. Lothar informed King Llane the invaders were bringing in reinforcements from somewhere, and the kingdom readied itself for a full-scale war that became known as the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; ordered raiding parties to cut deep into Stormwind's lands and drive panic among the human populace. Entire villagers in &lt;a href=\"Brightwood\"&gt;Brightwood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt;, and the southern &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt; fell, their inhabitants either killed or forced to flee. By the time Stormwind's patrols rode to defend the villages, the orcs were already gone. They were an enemy unlike any the humans had ever faced.\nLlane had named Lothar the \"King's Champion\", the highest military rank in the kingdom, and entrusted him to end the orcish threat. Deciding to use the orcs' mobility against them, Lothar studied the pattern of targets the Horde would strike and set up ambushes along their paths of retreat. A loyal knight named &lt;a href=\"Gavinrad%20the%20Dire\"&gt;Gavinrad the Dire&lt;/a&gt; was given command of large numbers of troops by Lothar. In some cases, small units of human knights were able to bring down entire orc raiding parties without any casualties. The orcs soon realized the humans were unlike any enemy they had ever faced as well.\nTo the surprise of &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;, his battle with Aegwynn had gone unnoticed by the rest of the world. No witnesses had survived, and the deaths of so many nobles had not caused the stir that he expected, as the kingdom of Stormwind laid the mysterious disappearance of the nobles on the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s flooding out of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Morass\"&gt;Black Morass&lt;/a&gt;.\nThree years after the Dark Portal had been opened, the orcish raids on the countryside had razed farms, towns, villages, forges, and trade houses, causing ruin to Stormwind's economy. Even more dire, many sources of food supply had been destroyed or fallen into the Horde's control, threatening &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; with running out of supplies in a few months. With this knowledge in mind, Blackhand decided to bring the Horde north to conquer &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt; and from there launch an attack on Stormwind City. The Horde marched on the foothills of Redridge with little resistance and believed the humans would not attack before they reached Stormwind City, which was exactly what Lothar wanted them to think. An orc raiding party led by Blackhand went into the mountains hoping to claim &lt;a href=\"Lakeshire\"&gt;Lakeshire&lt;/a&gt;. However, Lothar and his &lt;a href=\"knight\"&gt;knight&lt;/a&gt;s suddenly charged down the slopes without warning and surrounded the orcs in a spectacular ambush. The Horde &lt;a href=\"raider\"&gt;raider&lt;/a&gt;s fought hard but almost all of them were slain. Lothar himself had almost killed Blackhand, but the two &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s accompanying Blackhand had turned the tide of battle with their fel fire and forced Lothar to withdraw. Weeks later, a larger force took Lakeshire and the surrounding land.\nAfter Brightwood, Westfall, and the Redridge Mountains had eventually fallen, the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; marched onto Stormwind City. Thousands of Horde soldiers marched through &lt;a href=\"Elwynn%20Forest\"&gt;Elwynn Forest&lt;/a&gt; and encircled Stormwind, cutting off all access except for the sea. Warchief &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; had ordered &lt;a href=\"Kilrogg%20Deadeye\"&gt;Kilrogg Deadeye&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt; to lead their &lt;a href=\"Bleeding%20Hollow%20clan\"&gt;Bleeding Hollow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; clans in the assault on Stormwind. To weaken the city's defenses, &lt;a href=\"siege%20engine\"&gt;siege engine&lt;/a&gt;s bombarded the city walls through the night, and at dawn Kilrogg and Cho'gall launched their attack. While orcs charged the battlements, &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s engulfed Stormwind's soldiers in &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; fire, resulting in staggering losses. As it seemed Stormwind would fall that day, suddenly cries of an attack came from the Horde's rear lines. Lothar and the majority of Stormwind's &lt;a href=\"knight\"&gt;knight&lt;/a&gt;s had moved around the Horde by sea. The King's Commander was now leading a charge through Elwynn Forest, catching the orcs in the rearguard completely by surprise as the knights cut through their lines. As the Bleeding Hollow and Twilight's Hammer tried to push back the knights, Stormwind's large gates opened and soldiers poured out of the city to flank the orcs in a counterattack. Outflanked on both sides and suffering many casualties, the orcs were left with no choice but to flee.\nLater a second siege of Stormwind began. While the orcs breached the city's walls and fighting took place in the streets, Stormwind's defenders were able to hold them at bay. During the fighting, King Llane was assassinated by the Horde's assassin &lt;a href=\"Garona%20Halforcen\"&gt;Garona Halforcen&lt;/a&gt;. As word of the king's death spread, morale began to fall and Stormwind was reduced to ruins. Returning from slaying the possessed &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt;, Lothar subsequently took on the mantle of regent lord and guided the &lt;a href=\"Refugee%23Exodus%20of%20Stormwind\"&gt;refugee nation&lt;/a&gt; in the name of the young prince, &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;. The city's survivors fled to &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; aboard thousands of boats. &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Mara%20Fordragon\"&gt;Lady Mara Fordragon&lt;/a&gt;, High Clerist of Stormwind, later became the patron of the refugees who fled to Lordaeron after the conflict.\nAfter its destruction, the ruins of Stormwind City were lorded over by the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Stormreaver%20clan\"&gt;Stormreaver clan&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs a result of the kingdom's destruction, the leaders of the &lt;a href=\"Seven%20Kingdoms\"&gt;seven kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; resolved to unify once again in the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;King Terenas&lt;/a&gt;, ruler of Lordaeron, agreed to support the landless Stormwindians and let them settle near the &lt;a href=\"Southshore\"&gt;Southshore&lt;/a&gt; region of the &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt;. Battle-hardened and seeking retribution for the loss of their homeland, the forces of Stormwind fought during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; among their human brethren. Under Anduin Lothar's charismatic leadership, the Alliance joined together and succeeded in defeating the Horde together.\nSecond War and reconstruction.\nThough Anduin Lothar did not live to see it, the Alliance forces were able to take back the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, and with them under human control once again and serving as a strong base of operations, the Alliance eventually wrested most of Azeroth from the Horde's grip.\nSpecial importance was placed on rebuilding the nation of Stormwind. &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;King Terenas&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;kingdom of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; had pledged to aid the fallen nation and support Prince &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;'s ascension to the throne. For some, Stormwind was a powerful symbol of humanity's future and if it could rise from the ashes, anyone could. Consequently, men returned to the ruins of Stormwind City and began to rebuild the once-great city as a testament to their own survival. However, word of Stormwind's reconstruction was met with mixed feelings by the kingdom's refugees. Many of them refused to return to their broken home as it was a reminder of everything they had lost, and so these refugees preferred to start their lives anew in the northern continent of Lordaeron. As the Supreme Commander of the Alliance of Lordaeron, &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; oversaw the repatriation of the citizens of Stormwind, and helped &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Prince Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; secure his place as Stormwind's next king by providing him with experienced ministers and advisors, as most of the nobles of the kingdom had been killed by the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile rebuilding the kingdom, the Alliance called on artisans and patrons to help fund or aid in the massive project. Many answered the call: Terenas Menethil, the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Holy%20Light\"&gt;Church of Light&lt;/a&gt; and his Archbishop &lt;a href=\"Alonsus%20Faol\"&gt;Alonsus Faol&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Stonemasons%20Guild\"&gt;Stonemasons Guild&lt;/a&gt; were all instrumental in the rebuilding process. Meanwhile, King Varian led his people in reacquiring and restoring the kingdom's lost territories. The territories reacquired split the kingdom into several unique regions, all of which have their own form of a municipality. Though the regions are granted a certain degree of independence, all lands within Stormwind are united under the Stormwind banner and have sworn fealty to the House of Wrynn. Stormwind City, being the crown jewel of the kingdom, once again became the capital of the restored kingdom of Stormwind. Under King Wrynn's visionary leadership, the southern kingdom of Azeroth grew prosperous again and re-established itself as a military power.\nThe &lt;a href=\"internment%20camp\"&gt;internment camp&lt;/a&gt;s' authorities were based at first in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;New Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Danath%20Trollbane\"&gt;Danath Trollbane&lt;/a&gt;. During the early days of the &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Invasion of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, Danath gathered all the &lt;a href=\"Mercenary\"&gt;mercenaries&lt;/a&gt; of Stormwind together and marched them to fight at &lt;a href=\"Nethergarde%20Keep\"&gt;Nethergarde Keep&lt;/a&gt;. After the &lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Lothar\"&gt;Sons of Lothar&lt;/a&gt; destroyed the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, five statues in the likeness of &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kurdran%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Kurdran Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Danath%20Trollbane\"&gt;Danath Trollbane&lt;/a&gt; were placed within Stormwind's &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Heroes\"&gt;Valley of Heroes&lt;/a&gt;, in order to commemorate their heroic deeds and to honor their ultimate sacrifice for the safety of Azeroth.\nEpicenter of humanity.\nYears later, tensions grew among the kingdoms, however, as the costs for maintaining the Alliance rose much higher than originally anticipated. Unwilling to pay the taxes, the leaders of &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt; chose to withdraw their kingdoms from the Alliance. King Varian Wrynn vowed to stand by King &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;Terenas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; and remained committed to the Alliance, just as they have done for him. Yet further disaster came when the kingdom of Lordaeron was decimated by a mysterious &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;plague&lt;/a&gt; that killed thousands of humans and converted them into undead servants of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;. Even Lordaeron's prince, &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;, was manipulated by the Lich King, leading Arthas to kill his own father, destroy his own kingdom and journey to Northrend, where he merged with his master. For the next five years, the Lich King remained in Northrend, plotting and building up his armies.\nSince the fall of Lordaeron during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the kingdom of Stormwind has become the strongest bastion of humanity and the most powerful nation within the Alliance. As one of the few remaining great human cities, it boasts a powerful &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City%20Guard\"&gt;city guard&lt;/a&gt; and a strong &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Army\"&gt;army&lt;/a&gt;. With the fall of the northern &lt;a href=\"Seven%20Kingdoms\"&gt;kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;, Stormwind is by far the most populated human city in the world. With Lordaeron and Dalaran destroyed, and Gilneas and Kul Tiras isolating themselves after the Third War, Stormwind arose as a new bastion of leadership and military might in the Alliance. This granted Stormwind immense prestige and influence on the world stage, but also made it a target. Boasting a large population of predominantly human people, Stormwind served in many ways as the cultural and trade center of the New Alliance, which was furthermore supplemented by Stormwind City's access to the sea and its formidable fleet of ships. Led by King Varian Wrynn, the people of Stormwind held fast to the principles of honor and justice as they defended their settlements and their families.\nPolitical unrest.\nThough Stormwind offered what support and resources they could to &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, they were also beset by their own internal problems. After the &lt;a href=\"Stonemasons%20Guild\"&gt;Stonemasons Guild&lt;/a&gt; spent years toiling to rebuild the glorious city, they were left broke, as their fees and salaries were left unpaid and unspoken for by the city's officials. When the time of the rightful payment came, the nobles of Stormwind couldn't because they ran up a huge debt by expanding the kingdom's military presence through &lt;a href=\"Elwynn%20Forest\"&gt;Elwynn&lt;/a&gt; and into &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn&lt;/a&gt;, and the massive debt crippled the kingdom's economy. In the shadow, &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Lady Katrana Prestor&lt;/a&gt; manipulated both sides with the &lt;a href=\"%3ADrakefire%20Amulet\"&gt;:Drakefire Amulet&lt;/a&gt; - her meddling in the rebuilding of Stormwind left the nobility unsatisfied with the craftsmanship of the guild, while the workers were enraged that the nobility despised them and were threatening to withhold payment. When the Guildmaster of the Stonemasons &lt;a href=\"Edwin%20VanCleef\"&gt;Edwin VanCleef&lt;/a&gt; spoke out, demanding restitution for their works, the Stormwind House of Nobles ordered the Stonemasons' Guild disbanded, and it turned into a heated dispute, which resulted in riots that led to the murder of Queen Tiffin.\nIn response, &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; vowed to punish those responsible and dealt with the rioters more severely. The Stonemasons, fleeing the city, hid in the rural areas of &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt; to escape prosecution. Knowing Varian's anger would never fade, many were forced to remain in hiding. The Stonemasons became the terrorist organization known as the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; and sowed anarchy and terror in the lands of Stormwind for the next decade. King Varian, shaken by his wife's death, fell into a great depression. &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Katrana%20Prestor\"&gt;Lady Katrana Prestor&lt;/a&gt; took advantage of this opportunity and used politics and sorcery to politically outmaneuver the king in the coming years. Yet in time, King Varian slowly regained his political clout, with his son &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; being his primary inspiration.\nAfter the dust had settled from the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, Varian journeyed to &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore Isle&lt;/a&gt; to speak with Lady &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; regarding the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; relations. En route, he was abducted by the Defias who had been told of his diplomatic trip through a spy rumored to live within the Kingdom of Stormwind itself. Rumors circulated that he was taken to &lt;a href=\"Alcaz%20Island\"&gt;Alcaz Island&lt;/a&gt; and was held captive there. These rumors were true, yet they were also false, for Varian was split into two people after a botched ritual to subdue Varians' will conducted by &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Onyxia&lt;/a&gt;. While one of the twins retained all of his wits, charm, and patience, the other retained his will, ferocity, and skills in battle as he was enslaved by an orc gladiatorial trainer called &lt;a href=\"Rehgar%20Earthfury\"&gt;Rehgar Earthfury&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs King Varian Wrynn went missing under suspicious circumstances, Stormwind was believed to be going through a state of disarray. Young Anduin was given the crown so that order could be preserved within the kingdom of Stormwind, at the behest of the royal councilor, Lady Prestor. &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Highlord Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; acted as the Regent of Stormwind and the Supreme Commander of Stormwind's forces on behalf of King Anduin, with Lady Prestor advising Bolvar on the proper use of Stormwind's resources. While Lord Bolvar did his best to aid King Anduin with ruling the kingdom, Lady Prestor secretly worked to sow chaos and discord within the kingdom behind the scenes, while pretending to aid the young king in public.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nWith the recent invasion of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, which left the northern &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; in ruins, the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Stormwind\"&gt;Kingdom of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; stood as the strongest bastion of human civilization. The &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; since then has been reorganized and gained new allies in the following years, with the humans of Stormwind standing resolute in their charge to maintain the honor and might of humanity. Stormwind firmly backs the Alliance with its &lt;a href=\"knight\"&gt;knight&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s; many of whom served in the three wars against the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the first &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20Invasion\"&gt;Scourge Invasion&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; attacked Stormwind City. Bolvar Fordragon later led an Alliance counterattack and recruited heroes who raided &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt; and defeated &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;. Prior to the start of the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt;, the gates of Stormwind were invaded by a group of &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s led by &lt;a href=\"Highlord%20Kruul\"&gt;Highlord Kruul&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs the second Varian fought his way across &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; to freedom, earning the nickname \u201cLo'Gosh\" (or \u201cghost wolf\") in the &lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Ring\"&gt;Crimson Ring&lt;/a&gt;, meanwhile in Stormwind, jubilant throngs of Stormwind's subjects turned out for a massive ceremony to welcome home their king. However, the &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; that returned was arrogant, frivolous, and markedly interested in Katrana Prestor. The people of Stormwind had only been informed that the Defias had ransomed the king, but in truth, he was somehow imprisoned and ransomed back by some naga. In either case, his freedom was bought and paid for by a painful new tax. Upon his return, however, Varian seemed concerned only with spending more of his people's money, leaving affairs of state by the wayside.\nEventually, Lo'Gosh, with the help of his allies fought their way back to Stormwind. Marching through the gates of Stormwind, they were halted by &lt;a href=\"General%20Marcus%20Jonathan\"&gt;General Marcus Jonathan&lt;/a&gt; under the direct jurisdiction of Katrana Prestor, who ordered their immediate arrest and execution as traitors. However, &lt;a href=\"Reginald%20Windsor\"&gt;Reginald Windsor&lt;/a&gt; succeeded in convincing Marcus of his loyalty to Stormwind, as they had previously served together under &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt;. Katrana Prestor hastily gathered soldiers only to have the false-Varian tell her that she was disobeying the chain of command and was not in charge of Stormwind. Entering Stormwind Keep, Lo'Gosh declared Katrana's masquerade was over and called her by her true name: &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Onyxia&lt;/a&gt;. Revealing her dragon form and transforming multiple guards into &lt;a href=\"dragonspawn\"&gt;dragonspawn&lt;/a&gt;, a battle began in the great hall of Stormwind Keep. The arrival of &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Highlord Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; along with &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; greatly aided them in securing the keep, but Reginald Windsor was killed moments later by Onyxia. At the end of the battle, the great black dragon snatched Anduin and teleported them to her lair; daring King Varian to follow suit. Left to grieve the loss of their son, Lo'Gosh and Varian mobilized the troops of Stormwind as the final battle would end in &lt;a href=\"Onyxia%27s%20Lair\"&gt;Onyxia's Lair&lt;/a&gt;.\nLeading a mounted charge with their forces, both Varians cut bloody swathes into Onyxia's dragonspawn ranks. Eventually, they encountered the brood mother herself, with Anduin imprisoned and held as a hostage, threatening to kill him if Varian didn't surrender Stormwind over to her. After the prince was saved by &lt;a href=\"Broll%20Bearmantle\"&gt;Broll Bearmantle&lt;/a&gt;, both Varians engaged Onyxia with all of their might. Becoming desperate to end the fight, Onyxia began casting the spell she was going to use on &lt;a href=\"Alcaz%20Island\"&gt;Alcaz Island&lt;/a&gt; to kill Lo'Gosh, but the spell was disrupted and King Varian emerged, his two halves fused back together, with his newly-fused elven sword &lt;a href=\"Shalamayne\"&gt;Shalamayne&lt;/a&gt;. After he killed the Broodmother, Varian told his allies that their long and noble deeds would be rewarded and that Stormwind had been reborn with a new hope for the future. He then decapitated Onyxia and sent her head to be hung from the ramparts of Stormwind.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nLater, Stormwind itself was attacked by the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. King Varian created the &lt;a href=\"Valiance%20Expedition\"&gt;Valiance Expedition&lt;/a&gt; to put an end to the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; and made his friend, &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt;, the commander of his forces. Under Bolvar's leadership, the Valiance Expedition battled its way to the doorstep of the Scourge, &lt;a href=\"Angrathar%20the%20Wrathgate\"&gt;Angrathar the Wrathgate&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Angrathar%20the%20Wrathgate\"&gt;Battle of Angrathar the Wrathgate&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; put aside their differences and combined their forces in a showdown between them and the Lich King. Unfortunately, &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; renegades led by &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Apothecary%20Putress\"&gt;Grand Apothecary Putress&lt;/a&gt; unleashed the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken%20Blight\"&gt;Forsaken Blight&lt;/a&gt; on living and Scourge alike in a surprise attack meant to rid themselves of all their enemies in one fell swoop. The Alliance suffered heavy casualties from this betrayal, including as far as anyone can tell, Bolvar Fordragon. King Varian personally led the manhunt for Putress to avenge his fallen friend and also to retake the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Ruins of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. Although Varian was successful in bringing Putress to justice in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Undercity\"&gt;Battle for the Undercity&lt;/a&gt;, the horrors he witnessed in the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt; and the grief of losing his friend had reignited his hatred of the Horde. As a result, Varian and his forces nearly clashed with &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; forces but were interrupted by Lady &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; who teleported Varian's forces back to Stormwind before blood could be shed.\nThough tensions remained high, the Alliance and Horde reluctantly remained focused on the Lich King for the remainder of the &lt;a href=\"War%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;campaign&lt;/a&gt;; with only skirmishes between the two factions occurring to supplement their war effort in the war. Under King Varian's leadership, the proud humans of Stormwind led the Alliance and their allies to victory against the Scourge. However, while successful, the campaign in Northrend proved costly.\nCataclysm.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Unrest\"&gt;Elemental Unrest&lt;/a&gt;, the kingdom was attacked by furious &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt;s and several citizens joined the &lt;a href=\"Doomsday%20Cult\"&gt;Doomsday Cult&lt;/a&gt;.\nThough victory was won over the dreaded Scourge, it came at a great cost. The costs of the war in the north have taxed some of the Stormwind citizens to the point of bankruptcy. The people of Westfall, who were just recovering from years of neglect and harassment from Defias bandits, fell on especially hard times after the war. Meanwhile, Stormwind City itself was attacked by the black dragon &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, whose return brought about the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Shattering&lt;/a&gt; and wrecked parts of Stormwind City. Transients who lost their homes and businesses from either Deathwing's attack or by hard times now congregate in Westfall. &lt;a href=\"Vanessa%20VanCleef\"&gt;Vanessa VanCleef&lt;/a&gt;, daughter of the late &lt;a href=\"Edwin%20Vancleef\"&gt;Edwin Vancleef&lt;/a&gt;, took advantage of the discontent to revive the Defias Brotherhood. The once natural defenses buffering the kingdom from its enemies have cracked and left openings that were taken advantage of. The &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock orc&lt;/a&gt;s have managed to sneak into &lt;a href=\"Northshire\"&gt;Northshire&lt;/a&gt; through a break in the southern Elwynn Mountains. With the guidance of the dragon &lt;a href=\"Darkblaze\"&gt;Darkblaze&lt;/a&gt;, the Dark Horde has also begun invading Redridge in force as well. Heroes of the Alliance arose to defend the kingdom and made sure these threats never threaten Stormwind again.\nWith the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; emboldening the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; to acquire new territory and resources in the name of their new &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; \u2014&lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;\u2014 Stormwind has taken measures of its own to secure its borders from their perennial enemy's brazen expansion. &lt;a href=\"Marshtide%20Watch\"&gt;Marshtide Watch&lt;/a&gt; for example, was established to debilitate the Horde outpost &lt;a href=\"Stonard\"&gt;Stonard&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20of%20Sorrows\"&gt;Swamp of Sorrows&lt;/a&gt; and to hold the line in the frontier. Meanwhile, the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20navy\"&gt;Alliance navy&lt;/a&gt; was deployed to control key trade routes through victory at sea. Their naval battles attracted the attention of &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; and their thrall &lt;a href=\"Ozumat\"&gt;kraken&lt;/a&gt; however, and many of the Alliance and Horde ships were sunk by the naga's wanton attacks. Despite these setbacks, the emergence of &lt;a href=\"Vashj%27ir\"&gt;Vashj'ir&lt;/a&gt; has piqued the interest of Hellscream, who has sent &lt;a href=\"Hellscream%27s%20Vanguard\"&gt;Hellscream's Vanguard&lt;/a&gt; to claim it as a staging ground against Stormwind. Stormwind in response has sent &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Elite%20Aquatic%20and%20Land%20Forces\"&gt;Stormwind Seals&lt;/a&gt; under the command of &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Taylor\"&gt;Captain Taylor&lt;/a&gt; to claim the island and secure Stormwind from a naval assault.\nBlood of Our Fathers.\nNot long after &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; attacked &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;, on the day of &lt;a href=\"Remembrance%20Day\"&gt;Remembrance Day&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Harbor\"&gt;Stormwind Harbor&lt;/a&gt; was full of hulls in every color, shape, and size, as the celebration always brought a host of pilgrims to honor and celebrate humanity's heroes. However, there were even more boats present than usual, as many civilians sought the protection of Stormwind following the ravages caused across &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. During the celebration, the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; cult tried to assassinate both King Varian and Prince Anduin at the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City%20Cemetery\"&gt;Stormwind City Cemetery&lt;/a&gt;; which they were lured to by &lt;a href=\"Archbishop%20Benedictus\"&gt;Archbishop Benedictus&lt;/a&gt; under the pretense of family bonding. While the Wrynns fended off the assassins, Archbishop Benedictus tried to sway the Stormwind masses to the Twilight Hammer's cause.\nLater, much to everyone\u2019s surprise, Varian arrived at the Remembrance Day Ceremony. Limping onto a stage erected for the holiday, disheveled and covered in blood, came King Varian and Prince Anduin, barely holding each other up in their fatigue. As the realization of their dire state spread, a concerned murmur arose, but Varian raised his hand in a gesture of reassurance, and the crowd grew silent. It suddenly dawned on Varian that he had never found time to prepare his Remembrance Day speech. The king paused for just a moment, trying to smile through the pain, and then realized with utmost clarity that he now knew exactly what to say. He told the people of Stormwind that though he has his faults, as their king, he has and always will have their best interests in mind. Even after Deathwing's attack, Stormwind will always remain vigilant and stand defiantly against their enemies. They will always rebuild from tragedy and continue to learn from adversity. Stormwind will continue to grow from every direction, forging a brighter future. Each day they are alive is a great day, for each generation finds its own way to become the greatest generation that has ever lived and become the heroes of tomorrow. Varian states that though in the past they relied on strength and steel to forge their destiny, it is not the only way. In order to restore the world, a time will come when leaders need to be healers instead of warriors, those who mend instead of those who break. Only then can they truly cure their deep ills and achieve a lasting peace. Varian watched with pride as his words stirred the hearts of his people. The populace cheered for King Varian and this new direction for Stormwind.\nMists of Pandaria.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore Isle&lt;/a&gt; fell, black flags were raised at Stormwind's buildings in honor of those who died there. Later on, mass construction of Alliance ships took place in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Harbor\"&gt;Stormwind Harbor&lt;/a&gt; for the upcoming global &lt;a href=\"Alliance-Horde%20war\"&gt;Alliance-Horde war&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; achieved a critical victory against the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, thwarting the plans of Garrosh to unleash the horrible powers of the &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Bell\"&gt;Divine Bell&lt;/a&gt;, the repairs of the damage caused by &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; neared completion. The front gate towers have been reconstructed, and the statue of &lt;a href=\"Danath%20Trollbane\"&gt;Danath Trollbane&lt;/a&gt; is back in place and mended to pristine condition. Stormwind now appears more beautiful than ever. However, the area where the Park stood still appears black and charred, and the surrounding walls and buildings are still in ruins, reminding everyone of the horrors of Deathwing's power. It seemed unlikely that the destroyed district will ever fully recover, due to the fact that large chunks of landmass are missing.\nAs tensions between the Horde and the Alliance exploded in &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; served as a mediator for the first time, tempering the cold tactics of war with an eye toward creating lasting peace. King Varian's leadership was tested as he successfully united the Alliance amid the pressures of war. The Horde, however, under the weight of &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s command, continued to fracture. The trolls of the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear tribe&lt;/a&gt; soon rebelled, and &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; was consequently placed on lockdown. Warchief Garrosh had sent crews into the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt; and into the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Barrens\"&gt;Northern Barrens&lt;/a&gt; in search of resources to push his war machine forward. In the Vale of Eternal Blossoms, Garrosh seized the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;desiccated heart of an Old God&lt;/a&gt; to use as a tool of war, unleashing horrors upon the sacred valley, and consequently caused tensions to reach a boiling point. This culminated in the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;invasion of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; with the help of a &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Rebellion\"&gt;Horde rebellion&lt;/a&gt;. Varian's success solidified his position as &lt;a href=\"High%20King\"&gt;high king&lt;/a&gt;, the commander of all Alliance forces.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nFollowing the events of &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; was imprisoned to be tried in &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;. Before the trial could conclude, aided by &lt;a href=\"Kairoz\"&gt;an ally&lt;/a&gt; who can manipulate the timelines, Garrosh escaped to &lt;a href=\"Draenor%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Draenor of the past&lt;/a&gt;, and prevented the orcs from ever drinking the blood of &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt;, creating an untainted &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt; under the leadership of . High King Varian Wrynn declared &lt;a href=\"War%20in%20Draenor\"&gt;war&lt;/a&gt; on the Iron Horde and formed an Alliance expedition under the command of numerous talented commanders to face the orcish menace.\nLegion.\nThe hard-working citizens of Stormwind have been hard at work rebuilding &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Park\"&gt;Stormwind Park&lt;/a&gt; where they managed to rebuild a large mass of earth that was ripped out of the land from Deathwing's attack.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; began, King Varian Wrynn personally led the Alliance's &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;counterattack&lt;/a&gt;. The brutal fighting forced both the Alliance and the Horde to retreat, and Varian sacrificed his life to allow his allies to escape. Following the death of the king at the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lion%27s%20Rest\"&gt;King Wrynn's tomb&lt;/a&gt; was displayed in a portion of the new park as well as a memorial listing the names of fallen Alliance soldiers. Consequently, &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; was officially crowned as the new king of Stormwind and leader of the Alliance.\nAt some point, some of Stormwind's citizens have been converted to the Burning Legion's cause and formed the &lt;a href=\"Veiled%20Hand\"&gt;Veiled Hand&lt;/a&gt;. These cultists sought to overthrow Stormwind but were foiled when Shadows of the &lt;a href=\"Uncrowned\"&gt;Uncrowned&lt;/a&gt; assassinated their leaders.\nAt the end of the invasion, a new &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Embassy\"&gt;embassy&lt;/a&gt; opened in the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City%20Outskirts\"&gt;captial outskirts&lt;/a&gt;, as a meeting point for the leadership of the Alliance and the kingdom's allies. Sometime after the end of the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20Campaign\"&gt;Argus Campaign&lt;/a&gt;, King Anduin Wrynn had a speech for Stormwind citizens at Lion's Rest.\nSince &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;'s ascension as king, the House of Nobles has seen great strides in rooting out corruption, mainly under the supervision of &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; of the . At the time, many reforms allowed more aid and resources to arrive at &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt;, which caused the spark of revolution in the region to fade. The young king also offered pardons and reparations for former &lt;a href=\"Stonemasons%20Guild\"&gt;Stonemasons&lt;/a&gt; and their families, who therefore left their life of banditry and returned to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nIn the aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s invasion, the citizens of Stormwind and the Alliance lost their leader, &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;High King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;. Anduin lost his father and some of his innocence as he was entrusted with the command of the Alliance's armies amidst a violent war, a task he felt woefully unprepared for. Time and again, Anduin has used diplomacy to end conflict, inspiring even his warrior father to lay down arms in pursuit of peace. But diplomacy has its limits, and some villains can't be reasoned with. As the escalating war with the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; threatens everything Anduin holds dear, he now guides his armies to seek new allies. His ultimate goal is to put an end to the bloodshed he so abhors... even if it means getting his hands dirty.\nWith the discovery of &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt; threatening to shift the balance of power in Azeroth, King Anduin has refocused the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;'s efforts to prevent the powerful mineral from falling into the wrong hands and promoting diplomacy in order to prevent future wars fueled by Azerite. Anduin attempted to reconcile the humans of Stormwind with the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; by initiating the &lt;a href=\"Gathering\"&gt;Gathering&lt;/a&gt; event in order to promote unity. However, the Gathering ended in tragedy, and &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; has used the failed reunion to further alienate the Forsaken from their human counterparts.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Thorns\"&gt;War of the Thorns&lt;/a&gt;, King Anduin ordered that the portals from &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; be constantly open throughout Stormwind City, and many night elven and Gilnean refugees arrived in the capital, filling all its quarters, and even spilling out most of the way to Goldshire. In response to the burning of &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;, the Stormwindians marched with their Alliance allies to retaliate against the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Battle for Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. The two conflicts have reignited the war between the Alliance and Horde, as they &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;battle for Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and the Azerite proliferating from their dying world.\nShadowlands.\nAfter King Anduin Wrynn's abduction by the &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; was appointed as regent and protector of the realm with the support of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Nobles\"&gt;House of Nobles&lt;/a&gt;. The nobles were keen on restoring Stormwind's defenses in the wake of the Fourth War, and Turalyon remained popular with them in the years to come.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"Death%20Rising\"&gt;Death Rising&lt;/a&gt;, the kingdom came under attack from the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. To fight against the undead, troops of the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Army\"&gt;Stormwind Army&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; were mobilized in &lt;a href=\"Elwynn%20Forest\"&gt;Elwynn Forest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Duskwood\"&gt;Duskwood&lt;/a&gt; in order to protect the regions and its inhabitants. At the end of the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;war against the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, Anduin told &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; that he couldn't return to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; yet and that he trusted Turalyon to keep Strowmind and the Alliance safe in his absence.\nDragonflight.\nWith the return of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt; met with &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; and extended the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt;' invitation to the isles. Recalling how the Aspects made great sacrifices to save Azeroth during the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the Regent of Stormwind declared that Stormwind and the Alliance would answer the call and stand together with &lt;a href=\"dragons\"&gt;dragonkind&lt;/a&gt; once again. While the &lt;a href=\"Dragonscale%20Expedition\"&gt;expedition&lt;/a&gt; was preparing to depart, Turalyon discussed with &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; about the return of the &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;s. Although he had faith in &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;'s intentions, he expressed distrust of the other dragons, citing the 's report of the damage done to the kingdom by &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Onyxia&lt;/a&gt; years ago. In order to protect the Alliance and their past years' efforts to recreate its strength, he ordered the Spymaster to enlist the expertise of the Stormwind mages to create a foolproof method to see through the \"&lt;a href=\"Dragon%23Shapeshifting\"&gt;visage&lt;/a&gt;\" that the dragons wear among mortals.\nAt some point, a disgraced noble named &lt;a href=\"Count%20Clessington\"&gt;Count Clessington&lt;/a&gt; arranged for the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; to steal the &lt;a href=\"%3ADrakefire%20Amulet\"&gt;:Drakefire Amulet&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt;. Using the artifact's powers of manipulation, and the help of a cruel bandit named &lt;a href=\"Duncon%20Ratsbon\"&gt;Duncon Ratsbon&lt;/a&gt;, he convinced the Defias to turn against &lt;a href=\"Vanessa%20VanCleef\"&gt;Vanessa VanCleef&lt;/a&gt; and march on &lt;a href=\"Northshire%20Abbey\"&gt;Northshire Abbey&lt;/a&gt;, with the aim of using it as a staging ground to pillage the city of Stormwind itself. With the help of a &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;champion of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, the Defias were defeated, Count Clessington was slain, and the Drakefire Amulet was destroyed. In order to reward them for defeating the rebellion, &lt;a href=\"General%20Hammond%20Clay\"&gt;General Hammond Clay&lt;/a&gt; promoted the Stormwind champion into a &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Royal%20Guard\"&gt;Lionguard&lt;/a&gt; and bestowed them with a new armor during a ceremony in the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Heroes\"&gt;Valley of Heroes&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Breadbasket%20Guild\"&gt;Breadbasket Guild&lt;/a&gt; was created by a gathering of &lt;a href=\"farmer\"&gt;farmer&lt;/a&gt;s, former Defias members, and war &lt;a href=\"refugee\"&gt;refugee&lt;/a&gt;s, who sought to revitalize the region and help its inhabitants. They are good people trying to do right by each other, notably by working the farms again and getting proper homes built for folks. With the help and support of &lt;a href=\"Cecilia%20Clessington\"&gt;Countess Cecilia Clessington&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Nobles\"&gt;House of Nobles&lt;/a&gt;, their organization was formalized to request support from the kingdom.\nOrganization.\nPeople and culture.\nStormwind's &lt;a href=\"Team%20color\"&gt;national color&lt;/a&gt; is blue. &lt;a href=\"Lion\"&gt;Lion&lt;/a&gt;s are a common symbol, and as such &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt; was called the \"Lion of Azeroth\".\nThe demonym used for the people of Stormwind is \"Stormwindian\".\nThose who do not take the path of an adventurer become &lt;a href=\"peasant\"&gt;peasant&lt;/a&gt;s; those who craft, sow fields, work mines, and harvest lumber. The noble humans of Stormwind are a proud, tenacious race and are driven by valor and optimism. Inspired by the heroes that have come before them, the humans of Stormwind seek to rekindle humanity's former glory and forge a shining new future.\nStormwind's coinage has traditionally been the copper penny, the silver groat, and the gold sovereign. Every citizen must pay their taxes to the kingdom, and the latters can be regulated by the king or the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Nobles\"&gt;House of Nobles&lt;/a&gt;. Even villages and settlements not affiliated with any distinct Alliance nation, but who have sworn fealty to the Alliance maintained by the monarchies of Stormwind and &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;, pay taxes to those kingdoms in order to sustain the Alliance's upkeep.\nEach year, the people of Stormwind celebrate many holidays and events, notably the &lt;a href=\"Remembrance%20Day\"&gt;Remembrance Day&lt;/a&gt;, a festival to honor the great heroes of the past, such as &lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther the Lightbringer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt;. When a year is ending, the kingdom celebrates the &lt;a href=\"New%20Year\"&gt;New Year&lt;/a&gt; by offering free drinks to its citizens and by launching &lt;a href=\"firework\"&gt;firework&lt;/a&gt;s at night. The &lt;a href=\"Feast%20of%20Winter%20Veil\"&gt;Feast of Winter Veil&lt;/a&gt; was introduced to Stormwind and the Alliance at large by &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;King Muradin Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, thus its cities are accordingly decorated for the occasion. During the &lt;a href=\"Noblegarden\"&gt;Noblegarden&lt;/a&gt;, it is customary for the &lt;a href=\"Nobles%20of%20Stormwind\"&gt;nobles and lords of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; to hide coins, candy, and the occasional treasures within special eggs painted to look like wildflowers, which are then scattered in the capital and towns for the citizenry to find. During the &lt;a href=\"Volunteer%20Guard%20Day\"&gt;Volunteer Guard Day&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Peon%20Day\"&gt;Peon Day&lt;/a&gt;, the citizens of Stormwind celebrate the hard work of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City%20Guard\"&gt;City Guard&lt;/a&gt; and their &lt;a href=\"peasant\"&gt;peasant&lt;/a&gt;s. Like in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; before the &lt;a href=\"Third%20war\"&gt;Third war&lt;/a&gt;, the human of Stormwind continued their traditional &lt;a href=\"Hallow%27s%20End\"&gt;Hallow's End&lt;/a&gt; celebrations, even though they didn't quite understand the reasons for doing so, in the hopes of a brighter future despite the losses of the three &lt;a href=\"Great%20Wars\"&gt;Great Wars&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. After their introduction, the &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; brought with them a deeper understanding of the annual event, and in particular, reintroduced the practice of burning a wickerman. During the &lt;a href=\"Day%20of%20the%20Dead\"&gt;Day of the Dead&lt;/a&gt;, the people of Stormwind gather in graveyards to celebrate and cherish the spirits of those they have lost. Many other holidays are also celebrated, such as &lt;a href=\"Love%20is%20in%20the%20Air\"&gt;Love is in the Air&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Lunar%20Festival\"&gt;Lunar Festival&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Pilgrim%27s%20Bounty\"&gt;Pilgrim's Bounty&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Children%27s%20Week\"&gt;Children's Week&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Harvest%20Festival\"&gt;Harvest Festival&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Midsummer%20Fire%20Festival\"&gt;Midsummer Fire Festival&lt;/a&gt;.\nStormwindians revere the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Holy%20Light\"&gt;Church of the Holy Light&lt;/a&gt; plays a significant role in their society. The &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt; serves as a major spiritual hub for humanity as a whole, and as the base of operations for its clergy and the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Order of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; in the kingdom, while the &lt;a href=\"Northshire%20Abbey\"&gt;Northshire Abbey&lt;/a&gt; remains dedicated to recruiting and training any &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; brave enough to help keep the peace. The &lt;a href=\"Archbishop\"&gt;Archbishop&lt;/a&gt; of the Church represents the pride of the kingdom's culture and have great popularity with the people, which manifests during festivals like the &lt;a href=\"Remembrance%20Day\"&gt;Remembrance Day&lt;/a&gt;, when the crowd was eager to hear a speech from Archbishop &lt;a href=\"Benedictus\"&gt;Benedictus&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the kingdom, &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s are considered as &lt;a href=\"Heretic\"&gt;pariahs&lt;/a&gt; that must operate in the shadows of polite society. They practice their &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20%28magic%29\"&gt;dark&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Fel\"&gt;arts&lt;/a&gt; within hidden enclaves, so that they can escape the prejudice of the public, notably in the &lt;a href=\"Slaughtered%20Lamb\"&gt;Slaughtered Lamb&lt;/a&gt;'s basement and catacombs who serve as host to the warlock community of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;. They also do not hesitate to assassinate those who would try to reveal their hiding place and activities to the public. The &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City%20Patroller\"&gt;patrollers&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City%20Guard\"&gt;Stormwind City Guard&lt;/a&gt; consider that they never bring anything good, and that it is therefore necessary to be wary and keep an eye on them, although the law does not expressly prohibit their presence in the city (if they are not enemies of the Alliance).\nUpon their arrival in the kingdom, the &lt;a href=\"Void%20elf\"&gt;void elves&lt;/a&gt; were warned by &lt;a href=\"Ambassador%20Moorgard\"&gt;Ambassador Moorgard&lt;/a&gt; that it was better for them to keep control their shadow powers, as not everyone in Stormwind was as enlightened as him. The void elf emissary &lt;a href=\"Keira%20Onyxraven\"&gt;Keira Onyxraven&lt;/a&gt; later testified that she did not receive a very warm welcome too, but that most folk were polite enough.\nPolitical structure.\nThe permanent head of government in the kingdom is the &lt;a href=\"King\"&gt;King of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; - a position entitled to male members of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Wrynn\"&gt;Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; dynasty. The &lt;a href=\"Prince\"&gt;crown prince&lt;/a&gt; - first-born son of the king and his &lt;a href=\"Queen\"&gt;queen consort&lt;/a&gt; - will be coronated king upon the death of his father. Other than the King himself, the royal family doesn't seem to hold much political power, but possesses high privileges in the society. The power of young kings who have yet to enter adulthood will temporarily be shared by a &lt;a href=\"Regent\"&gt;regent lord&lt;/a&gt;. The king's government consists of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Nobles\"&gt;House of Nobles&lt;/a&gt; including ministers, advisors, and a &lt;a href=\"Court%20Conjurer\"&gt;Court Conjurer&lt;/a&gt; previously advised the king on the matters of magic. The king can provide the House with temporary stewardship if he leaves the kingdom.\nSince &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;'s return, the Kings of Stormwind have also had a unique international position as the ultimate leader of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; - referred to as the &lt;a href=\"High%20King\"&gt;High King&lt;/a&gt;, often with leaders of other member states acting as their advisors or joining them in council meetings. Due to the kingdom having a permanent position of leadership within the greater Alliance, the foreign military politics of Stormwind has integrated almost entirely with that of the entire faction.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Army\"&gt;Stormwind Army&lt;/a&gt; is nowadays headed by the &lt;a href=\"General%20%28rank%29\"&gt;general&lt;/a&gt;, also known as the High Commander of Stormwind Defense, and whose subordinates act as the executive branch carrying out the laws of the King and his government across the entire kingdom of Stormwind. Notably, \"King's Champion\", is the highest military rank in the kingdom, but has not been used since &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt;. The king of Stormwind also employs a &lt;a href=\"spymaster\"&gt;spymaster&lt;/a&gt; to command the , a secretive military force specializing in espionage and assassination. The &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City%20Guard\"&gt;Stormwind City Guard&lt;/a&gt; are the law enforcement and protectors of the capital, keeping the peace within the city's walls, while the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Guard\"&gt;Stormwind Guard&lt;/a&gt; patrol and enforce the kingdom's law in &lt;a href=\"Elwynn%20Forest\"&gt;Elwynn Forest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Duskwood\"&gt;Duskwood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Wizard%27s%20Sanctum\"&gt;Wizard's Sanctum&lt;/a&gt; have a task to ensure the safety of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; and its lands, they wage a \"secret war\" into the \"invisible world\", notably by investigating and dealing with any magical anomalies and creatures threatening the realm and its inhabitants.\nThe kingdom of Stormwind spans several regions with local democratically elected magistrates or mayors, ruling courts, and creating laws for the local populace.\nThe kingdom's administrative justice can apply the death penalty for its criminals, the task being accomplished by an &lt;a href=\"executioner\"&gt;executioner&lt;/a&gt;, as stated by &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Spymaster Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; who attended several of these executions. The death penalty by hanging is notably applied to thieves who were caught a third time in the act by the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City%20Guard\"&gt;Stormwind City Guard&lt;/a&gt;. It was the case of &lt;a href=\"Pathonia%20Shaw\"&gt;Pathonia Shaw&lt;/a&gt; before she agreed to work as an assassin for the kingdom. &lt;a href=\"Spy\"&gt;Spies&lt;/a&gt; sent by enemies of the kingdom are also executed if they are captured. When &lt;a href=\"Garona%20Halforcen\"&gt;Garona Halforcen&lt;/a&gt; was captured at &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore Isle&lt;/a&gt;, King Varian tried to claim her, the assassin of his father, for a public execution at Stormwind City. Outside the capital, &lt;a href=\"Lakeshire\"&gt;Lakeshire&lt;/a&gt; has its own Court and Law, which mentions that aiding a criminal of the Kingdom is punishable by death. In &lt;a href=\"Duskwood\"&gt;Duskwood&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Darkshire\"&gt;Council of Darkshire&lt;/a&gt; was responsible for enforcing justice, but also for ordering death sentences by beheading, notably for those who sold the bodies from cemeteries in the region.\nFor the non-violent criminals from the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Stockade\"&gt;Stormwind Stockades&lt;/a&gt;, the policy of the kingdom indicate that they must be conscripted into the army and sent to fronts as penal legions, in order to fulfill their sentence. Those who do not respect the rules and discipline of the army are imprisoned again. It is necessary for a crew to have regulatory papers to moor at the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Harbor\"&gt;Stormwind Harbor&lt;/a&gt;. While they are usually killed on sight by the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Army\"&gt;Stormwind Army&lt;/a&gt;, in very rare cases, &lt;a href=\"pirate\"&gt;pirate&lt;/a&gt;s may obtain a royal pardon for past crimes if they manage to accomplish a mission of great importance to the kingdom. If successful, they will be allowed to moor at the harbor.\nMilitary.\nThe Kingdom of Stormwind possesses an array of military organizations:\nTerritory and outposts of Stormwind.\nFollowing the victory of the Alliance of Lordaeron over the Horde, Stormwind was reclaimed and rebuilt as New Stormwind. The kingdom is currently split into &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29%23Azeroth\"&gt;several smaller territories&lt;/a&gt;. Some villages such as &lt;a href=\"Goldshire\"&gt;Goldshire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lakeshire\"&gt;Lakeshire&lt;/a&gt;, and other territories are governed by an appointed &lt;a href=\"Marshal%20%28rank%29\"&gt;Marshal&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Army\"&gt;Stormwind Army&lt;/a&gt;, which upholds the law on behalf of the king. Other towns could be governed by a democratically elected official. &lt;a href=\"Lakeshire\"&gt;Lakeshire&lt;/a&gt;, for example, is governed by an elected magistrate \u2014 &lt;a href=\"Magistrate%20Solomon\"&gt;Magistrate Solomon&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Darkshire\"&gt;Darkshire&lt;/a&gt; appears to have appointed its own mayor, which was &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Ello%20Ebonlocke\"&gt;Lord Ello Ebonlocke&lt;/a&gt; before his betrayal, his successor is unknown. &lt;a href=\"Moonbrook\"&gt;Moonbrook&lt;/a&gt; was governed by a mayor before the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; took control of the region, no successor has been elected since.\nDuring the absence of &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, co-regent Lady Katrana Prestor managed to sow discord among the various regions of Azeroth. Her as the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragon\"&gt;black dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Onyxia&lt;/a&gt; was revealed, ending her hold over the kingdom. With Varian Wrynn's return, the Stormwind kingdom began to rebuild and slowly began to get back on top of things and maintain order. However, this brief moment of progress was temporarily interrupted with the end of the &lt;a href=\"War%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; and the recent &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; that broke the world. The kingdom faced economical issues while the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20Deathwing\"&gt;war against Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; seriously damaged the kingdom's economy. Many have become homeless and evicted forced to find work and a place to live.\nIn the years that followed, the kingdom slowly managed to regain its former glory, although it faced many threats such as the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, and conflicts with the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;. Following the death of Varian during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, his son &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; succeeded him as king and continued the work of his late father.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Antonio%20Perelli\"&gt;Antonio Perelli&lt;/a&gt;, a wandering vendor, it takes him a week on foot to complete his journey through all the regions of the kingdom, regularly passing by &lt;a href=\"Goldshire\"&gt;Goldshire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20Hill\"&gt;Sentinel Hill&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Darkshire\"&gt;Darkshire&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Lakeshire\"&gt;Lakeshire&lt;/a&gt; (in this order) to sell his goods.\nIn Warcraft II.\nLeader: \"&lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Regent Lord Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt;\"\nNation Color: \"Blue\"\nBackground: \"Before the coming of the &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Age of Chaos&lt;/a&gt; when the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Portal&lt;/a&gt; was first opened, the kingdom of Azeroth was the mightiest of all &lt;a href=\"Human\"&gt;Human&lt;/a&gt; nations. Ruled by the wise and just &lt;a href=\"Llane%20Wrynn%20I\"&gt;King Llane&lt;/a&gt;, Azeroth stood as a beacon of light and truth throughout the known world. After the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, Azeroth and all of its lands were devastated by the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. With King Llane dead, Sir Lothar took charge of the shattered armies of Azeroth and &lt;a href=\"Refugee%23Exodus%20of%20Stormwind\"&gt;led&lt;/a&gt; the survivors across the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt; to the shores of Lordaeron. &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;King Terenas&lt;/a&gt;, ruler of Lordaeron, agreed to support the landless Azerothiens. The people of Azeroth settled near the &lt;a href=\"Southshore\"&gt;Southshore&lt;/a&gt; region of Lordaeron, pledging their loyalty to the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. Battle-hardened and brave, the last of the once great armies of Azeroth now seek retribution for the loss of their homeland.\"\nIn the RPG.\nThe Kingdom of Stormwind is considered a base of magical/divine study and contemplation in Azeroth. &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; is its capital.\nAside from the rebuilt settlements, there is evidence of the constant warring of recent years after the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;s. Hard-edged debris of wartime fortresses stand softened by wind and rain. Grapevines entwine abandoned siege machines, and battlefields are carpeted in wildflowers. Wolves stalk herds of wild pigs around the stumps produced by decades of harvesting and among the saplings that now grow to take their place. Even as the humans rebuilt, much of Stormwind reverted to wilderness, closer to the world's natural state than in a thousand years. The tribes of &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;forest trolls&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"ogre%20lord\"&gt;ogre lord&lt;/a&gt;s emerge to stake claims on the wild lands, resulting in rising clashes between all races.\nStormwind firmly backs the Alliance; its &lt;a href=\"knight\"&gt;knight&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s served in the three wars against the Horde and the kingdom still exists as the strongest unified human force in the world, but enemies and wilderness now surround it.\nAfter the First War, the Stormwindians mourned their beloved King Llane who died when the capital of Stormwind fell to the Horde, and they settled near &lt;a href=\"Southshore\"&gt;Southshore&lt;/a&gt;, determined to take back their homes.\nSpeculation.\nThe term Stormwind Monarchy could be referring to the then-rulers Prince &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, Regent &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt;, and the royal councilor &lt;a href=\"Katrana%20Prestor\"&gt;Katrana Prestor&lt;/a&gt;."}

Along with the forces in the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20navy\"&gt;Alliance navy&lt;/a&gt;, Stormwind's army constitutes one of its main contributions to the military of the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Alliance\"&gt;Grand Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, of which the kingdom is central. The army has been an integral part of Stormwind's survival throughout the many events following its reconstruction after the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;. Naturally based from &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;, the army has been deployed to a great many areas across &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and beyond.\nClose to home in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;, the Stormwind Army sees active duty in regions such as &lt;a href=\"Elwynn%20Forest\"&gt;Elwynn Forest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Duskwood\"&gt;Duskwood&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20of%20Sorrows\"&gt;Swamp of Sorrows&lt;/a&gt;. In these cases, the army is mainly concerned with maintaining order and protecting the populace through the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Guard\"&gt;Stormwind Guard&lt;/a&gt;, or else expanding Stormwind's influence into new regions altogether. Within the capital's walls, the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City%20Guard\"&gt;Stormwind City Guard&lt;/a&gt; are the law enforcement and protectors of its citizens.\nIn addition, the Stormwind Army has been deployed to markedly more exotic theaters. Forces served in the frigid continent of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, the ruined world of &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, and even in as part of the war against the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt;. In recent times, Stormwind's Army &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;has engaged&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; alongside the majority of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s armies, as they battle to drive the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s from the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;, and faced once again the forces of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; across the world during the events of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;.\nDue to the army's vast nature and great responsibilities, it has taken to deputizing &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;heroes&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; to fulfill certain duties on its behalf, as well as formally inducting militia forces, such as the &lt;a href=\"Westfall%20Brigade\"&gt;Westfall Brigade&lt;/a&gt;, into the armed forces.\nHistory.\nOld era.\nThe Stormwind army successfully managed to defend the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Gnoll%20War\"&gt;Gnoll War&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20War\"&gt;Gurubashi War&lt;/a&gt;. The arrival of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, however, led to their defeat during the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;. The army stood strong and brave, but even the valiant sacrifice of the &lt;a href=\"knight\"&gt;knight&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Brotherhood%20of%20the%20Horse\"&gt;Brotherhood of the Horse&lt;/a&gt; couldn't stop its fall. The conflict also revealed several weaknesses in its ranks, such as having no flying scouting units, the lack of offensive power of the &lt;a href=\"Brotherhood%20of%20Northshire\"&gt;Northshire&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"cleric\"&gt;cleric&lt;/a&gt;s and its &lt;a href=\"conjurer\"&gt;conjurer&lt;/a&gt;s being unprepared for the rigors of warfare. When &lt;a href=\"Llane%20Wrynn%20I\"&gt;King Llane&lt;/a&gt; fell, Sir &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt; had no other choice than to declare the war lost and save what remained by gathering the tattered remnants of the army and as many civilians as he could, and lead them in a desperate retreat across the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt;. After their tumultuous escape by boats, the Stormwind &lt;a href=\"refugee\"&gt;refugee&lt;/a&gt;s eventually landed on the coast of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; and settled near &lt;a href=\"Southshore\"&gt;Southshore&lt;/a&gt;, which led to the Stormwindian army defending the &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;. The Stormwindians joined the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; and fought the Horde for the remainder of the Second War, with one of their own \u2014 Sir Anduin Lothar \u2014 acting as the Alliance's Supreme Allied Commander. The Alliance learned of the Stormwind Army failings, deploying new units such as &lt;a href=\"Gnome\"&gt;gnomish&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"flying%20machine\"&gt;flying machine&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s and battle-ready &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s against the Horde.\nAfter the end of the conflict, the forces of Stormwind traveled back to rebuild their homeland. Under King &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;'s visionary leadership, the southern kingdom of Azeroth grew prosperous again and reestablished itself as a military power. &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;General Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; of the Allianced helped rebuild Stormwind's defenses and train the new army. They defended their territories during the &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Invasion of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, but sat out mostly intact during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;. King Varian led the Stormwind army in protecting their people from raiding orc parties, orchestrating a manhunt for the assassin &lt;a href=\"Garona\"&gt;Garona&lt;/a&gt;, and helping with the restoration of the kingdom. The &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Nobles\"&gt;nobles of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; however, ran up a huge debt by expanding the kingdom's military presence through &lt;a href=\"Elwynn%20Forest\"&gt;Elwynn&lt;/a&gt; and into &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn&lt;/a&gt;. The massive debt crippled the kingdom's economy and stripped &lt;a href=\"Edwin%20VanCleef\"&gt;Edwin VanCleef&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Stonemasons\"&gt;Stonemasons&lt;/a&gt; of their promised rewards. The disagreement between the Stonemasons and the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Nobles\"&gt;House of Nobles&lt;/a&gt; set off a violent riot that led to the murder of Queen &lt;a href=\"Tiffin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Tiffin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;. In response, King Varian Wrynn vowed to punish those responsible and dealt with the rioters more severely. The Stonemasons were routed from &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;, and hid in the rural areas of &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt; to escape prosecution. Knowing Varian's anger would never fade, many were forced to remain in hiding. The Stonemasons became the terrorist organization known as the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; and sowed anarchy and terror in the lands of Stormwind for the next decade.\nModern era.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; was abducted by the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; on the orders of the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragon\"&gt;black dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Onyxia&lt;/a&gt;, who disguised herself as &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Katrana%20Prestor\"&gt;Lady Katrana Prestor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Prince Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; was crowned and reigned in his father's absence for a few years. However, Anduin was too young to exercise any real political power and the kingdom was in fact governed by his co-regents, Lady Prestor and &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Highlord Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring this time, the Stormwind Army has been criticized sharply by prominent officials within the kingdom for its apparent inability to respond to threats effectively. In particular, the regions of &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Duskwood\"&gt;Duskwood&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt; suffered significantly from the army's lack of support in the period preceding the return of their king. The inaction of the army was mainly the result of the actions of Lady Katrana Prestor who sought to weaken the kingdom as a whole and also the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; using political subversion, assassination, and sorcery. Even in occupied territories, the army had to rely on the help of &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s as its soldiers were low in numbers.\nThe blow to the army's standing was greatly magnified by the outright abandonment of certain regions of the kingdom, most notably &lt;a href=\"Duskwood\"&gt;Duskwood&lt;/a&gt;. This abandonment led to the formation of several militias, such as the &lt;a href=\"People%27s%20Militia\"&gt;People's Militia&lt;/a&gt; in Westfall and the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Watch\"&gt;Night Watch&lt;/a&gt; in Duskwood. Following the return of King Varian Wrynn, however, there has been serious reform in the actions of the Stormwind Army. Free from internal political intrigue, the army has reasserted itself in many neglected parts of the world, once more bolstering Stormwind's influence.\nIn the Kingdom.\nThe Stormwind Army is highly active throughout the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;. Serving a variety of domestic functions, the army generally focuses on maintaining law and order through the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Guard\"&gt;Stormwind Guard&lt;/a&gt;, protecting the civilian populace, and expanding the kingdom's influence while dealing with any potential threats. Its main theaters of activity are located, like the kingdom itself, in the southern reaches of the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;.\nElwynn Forest.\nForming the heartland of the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; and serving as the location of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; itself, &lt;a href=\"Elwynn%20Forest\"&gt;Elwynn Forest&lt;/a&gt; is thus a high priority for the Stormwind Army. Troops are deployed across the region to defend the numerous settlements dotting the forest. Large concentrations of troops are generally located at specific points, such as the &lt;a href=\"Westbrook%20Garrison\"&gt;Westbrook Garrison&lt;/a&gt; in the forest's west.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Goldshire\"&gt;Goldshire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Marshal%20Dughan\"&gt;Marshal Dughan&lt;/a&gt; is in charge of the security of town and its surrounding areas. In &lt;a href=\"Northshire%20Valley\"&gt;Northshire Valley&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Marshal%20McBride\"&gt;Marshal Douglas McBride&lt;/a&gt; acts as the commander of &lt;a href=\"Northshire%20Abbey\"&gt;Northshire Abbey&lt;/a&gt;'s garrison and is in charge of the defense of the valley.\nWell-garrisoned throughout Stormwind's history, Elwynn has also seen a great many problems originating from various sources, many of which have been directly confronted by the army. &lt;a href=\"Murloc\"&gt;Murloc&lt;/a&gt;s have long plagued the region and have interfered or outright threatened the lives of its &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; citizens. The army has subsequently placed bounties on murloc fins in an attempt to cull their numbers. Bounties have also been placed by the army on various other high-value targets that threaten the peace, such as the outlaw &lt;a href=\"James%20Clark\"&gt;James Clark&lt;/a&gt;, or the infamous &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt; chieftain &lt;a href=\"Hogger\"&gt;Hogger&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis system of bounties is mainly the result of the army being spread thin across the kingdom; many &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s have answered the call by completing these missions throughout Elwynn Forest. As a result, the army has frequently been known to award Deputy status upon those willing to aid in the maintenance of peace.\nThe garrisons of Elwynn Forest have been known to commission local suppliers to keep the army properly equipped, one such example being the &lt;a href=\"tailor\"&gt;tailor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sara%20Timberlain\"&gt;Sara Timberlain&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Catackysm&lt;/a&gt;, the army has been deployed to repel an invasion of &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock clan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s who have encroached upon the &lt;a href=\"Northshire%20Vineyards\"&gt;Northshire Vineyards&lt;/a&gt; and the surrounding &lt;a href=\"Northshire%20Valley\"&gt;valley&lt;/a&gt;. To help contain the threat, a detachment of the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Royal%20Guard\"&gt;Stormwind Royal Guard&lt;/a&gt; was sent to bolster the area's local defenses. With the aid of &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; heroes, they were once more successful in ending a major threat to Elwynn's security.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"Death%20Rising\"&gt;Death Rising&lt;/a&gt;, Elwynn Forest came under attack from the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; and troops of the Stormwind Army were mobilized in order to protect the region and its inhabitants.\nWestfall.\nBefore the eventual return of &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, the Stormwind Army (and the kingdom as a whole) experienced a period of decline, secretly orchestrated by the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragon\"&gt;black dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Onyxia&lt;/a&gt; disguised as &lt;a href=\"Katrana%20Prestor\"&gt;Lady Katrana Prestor&lt;/a&gt;. Under her influence, the army largely pulled out of many of the fringe regions of the kingdom, such as &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt;, to dire effect.\nOnce the breadbasket of the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, Westfall fell into rapid disrepair and desolation, with most economic and agricultural processes ruined. With the absence of Stormwind's military, the infamous &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; based itself from the region, utilizing the rampant resentment of Stormwindian authority. In an attempt to combat this threat, the &lt;a href=\"People%27s%20Militia\"&gt;People's Militia&lt;/a&gt; was formed by citizens of Westfall to maintain some semblance of order. One of their many responsibilities included suppressing the local &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt; population, ever a threat.\nFollowing the return of King Varian, Stormwind's policy of neglect towards the region shifted rapidly. Troops were once more deployed to Westfall to undertake a major campaign to rebuild the ruined region. The People's Militia were subsequently inducted into the Stormwind Army, becoming the &lt;a href=\"Westfall%20Brigade\"&gt;Westfall Brigade&lt;/a&gt;, and going on to serve in wars abroad.\nDespite this turn of events for Westfall and the army's return, much changed with the advent of the &lt;a href=\"War%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war in Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. The high cost, both in manpower and resources, proved too much for the kingdom, and the region once more began to slide towards chaos. Order began to collapse, while large amounts of &lt;a href=\"transient\"&gt;transient&lt;/a&gt;s and homeless citizens gathered. Eventually, with their tour of duty in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; finished, the Westfall Brigade returned to their homeland to discover its fate. They immediately set about reestablishing law and order, while setting up a military base at &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20Hill\"&gt;Sentinel Hill&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe army, and in particular the Westfall Brigade, proved instrumental in defeating a resurgent &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; at the time of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, which had begun to thrive on the recent neglect shown to the region by Stormwind City. Though briefly losing control of &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20Hill\"&gt;Sentinel Hill&lt;/a&gt;, the army was reinforced by a battalion of troops sent by the King. The insurrection was finally put down with the help of &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s, and the army once more established firm control over the region.\nAt the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, numerous &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Invasions\"&gt;invasions&lt;/a&gt; were launched against various zones across &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic forces of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Westfall subsequently became a primary target (possibly due to its proximity to Stormwind) and the Stormwind Army was quickly pressed into service to repel the assault. Resistance was headed by Marshal &lt;a href=\"Gryan%20Stoutmantle\"&gt;Gryan Stoutmantle&lt;/a&gt;, based from &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20Hill\"&gt;Sentinel Hill&lt;/a&gt;. Forces consisting of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Guard%20%28Legion%20Invasion%29\"&gt;guardsmen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Mage\"&gt;mages&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Gryphon%20Rider\"&gt;gryphon riders&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Knight\"&gt;knights&lt;/a&gt; were all deployed in the region, and with the aid of &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt;, the army ultimately prevailed.\nDuskwood.\nWhen the Stormwind Army began to pull out of numerous areas of the kingdom under the influence of &lt;a href=\"Katrana%20Prestor\"&gt;Lady Katrana Prestor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Duskwood\"&gt;Duskwood&lt;/a&gt; saw itself quickly and completely abandoned by Stormwind. In the void left by the army, a local militia known as the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Watch\"&gt;Night Watch&lt;/a&gt; was formed to maintain order.\nDespite the return of &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and the resurgence of the Stormwind Army, Duskwood has remained ungarrisoned by any troops. Owing to more serious demands elsewhere, as well as the sizeable task of guarding the dangerous forest, the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; has refrained from making any effort to police the region, with the Night Watch continuing these duties from their base in &lt;a href=\"Darkshire\"&gt;Darkshire&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, after a &lt;a href=\"Necromancer%20%28Terror%20by%20Torchlight%29\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt; attempted to overwhelm Duskwood with an army of undead, &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; decided to send &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Guard\"&gt;Stormwind guards&lt;/a&gt; in the region as reinforcements after the necromancer hinted that the threat was not over. During &lt;a href=\"Death%20Rising\"&gt;Death Rising&lt;/a&gt;, Duskwood came under attack from the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, and troops of the Stormwind Army were mobilized in order to protect the region and its inhabitants.\nRedridge Mountains.\nDuring the period before &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;'s return, the Stormwind Army did not pull out of the kingdom's easternmost region, the &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, as it had done with several other areas of the nation. Despite this, the army's presence in Redridge remained tenuous, with constant incursions from local &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt; forces and &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20orc\"&gt;Blackrock orc&lt;/a&gt; armies. The situation became so dire that the army was eventually forced from the position of &lt;a href=\"Stonewatch%20Keep\"&gt;Stonewatch Keep&lt;/a&gt;, falling back to protect the major settlement of &lt;a href=\"Lakeshire\"&gt;Lakeshire&lt;/a&gt;. Guards in Lakeshire were expecting the 2nd Battalion from Stormwind.\nRequests were sent by &lt;a href=\"Magistrate%20Solomon\"&gt;Magistrate Solomon&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;, describing the dismal situation and asking for additional reinforcements. General &lt;a href=\"Marcus%20Jonathan\"&gt;Marcus Jonathan&lt;/a&gt; promised that the army would help, though it is implied it took a long time and is unknown whether this aid arrived at all.\nSometime after the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, Stormwind increased Redridge's security by constructing &lt;a href=\"Tower%20Watch\"&gt;Tower Watch&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Three%20Corners\"&gt;Three Corners&lt;/a&gt; and stationing a garrison of &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Garrison%20Watchman\"&gt;Redridge Watchmen&lt;/a&gt; there. Some time later, &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt; arrived in Redridge to help the beleaguered guards and soldiers in combating the region's many threats; the greatest of which took the form of a determined &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Horde\"&gt;Dark Horde&lt;/a&gt; invasion from across the mountain range. Eventually, the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s were defeated, largely thanks to the efforts of a reformed &lt;a href=\"Bravo%20Company\"&gt;Bravo Company&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"Death%20Rising\"&gt;Death Rising&lt;/a&gt;, Redridge Mountains came under attack from the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; and troops of the Stormwind Army were mobilized in order to protect the region and its inhabitants.\nAbroad.\nThe Stormwind Army has played a major part in many of the great and deciding conflicts that have taken place outside the Kingdom over the years, often serving as the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;'s vanguard in dealing with a wide variety of threats. As such, the army has seen action across numerous continents, worlds, and even timelines.\nEastern Kingdoms.\nLordaeron.\nThe Stormwind Army rarely sent soldiers to the continent of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; with the exception of officers like &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20Farren%20Orinelle\"&gt;Lieutenant Farren Orinelle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Ashlam%20Valorfist\"&gt;Commander Ashlam Valorfist&lt;/a&gt; to maintain order and security for the few pockets of Alliance settlements still left there.\nFollowing the betrayal at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Angrathar%20the%20Wrathgate\"&gt;Battle of Angrathar the Wrathgate&lt;/a&gt; and hearing news of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; losing control of the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;, King &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; deployed the Stormwind Army to &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt; in order to aid him in bringing &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Apothecary%20Putress\"&gt;Grand Apothecary Putress&lt;/a&gt; to justice and reclaiming the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Ruins of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; for the Alliance. During the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Undercity\"&gt;Battle for the Undercity&lt;/a&gt;, King Varian's forces managed to kill Putress, but Lady &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; teleported Varian and his forces back to Stormwind before his army clashed with &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;'s Horde forces.\nSometime after the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, King Varian Wrynn ordered &lt;a href=\"Thassarian\"&gt;Thassarian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Ashlam%20Valorfist\"&gt;Commander Ashlam Valorfist&lt;/a&gt; to assemble an army and purge both the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Andorhal\"&gt;Andorhal&lt;/a&gt;, with the intention of reclaiming the town for the Alliance. During the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Andorhal\"&gt;Battle for Andorhal&lt;/a&gt;, the Alliance managed to destroy the Scourge presence but the Horde drove the Alliance out and claimed Andorhal for themselves.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt; erupted between the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, High King &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; deployed the Stormwind Army to support the Alliance in retaking the continent of Lordaeron. During the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Battle for Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, the Alliance forces managed to seize &lt;a href=\"Brill\"&gt;Brill&lt;/a&gt; and besiege the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Ruins of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. Although the Alliance forces managed to drive the Horde out of &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron Keep&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; unleashed the &lt;a href=\"New%20Plague\"&gt;New Plague&lt;/a&gt;, making the Ruins of Lordaeron inhospitable and forcing Alliance forces to be recalled to more defensible positions.\nStranglethorn.\nLying just to the south of the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;'s border, the jungles of &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt; have seen relatively little activity by the Stormwind Army. On one rare occasion, &lt;a href=\"Kurzen%27s%20Expedition\"&gt;a military expedition&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Colonel%20Kurzen\"&gt;Colonel Kurzen&lt;/a&gt; established itself just within the jungle at &lt;a href=\"Kurzen%27s%20Compound\"&gt;Kurzen's Compound&lt;/a&gt;. Before long, however, disaster struck as Kurzen himself descended into madness (the doing of the &lt;a href=\"ogre%20mage\"&gt;ogre mage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mai%27Zoth\"&gt;Mai'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;). Some members of the expedition subsequently rejected their leader's insanity and left, establishing the &lt;a href=\"Rebel%20Camp\"&gt;Rebel Camp&lt;/a&gt; not far from &lt;a href=\"Kurzen%27s%20Compound\"&gt;Kurzen's Compound&lt;/a&gt;.\nFrom here, the army rebels continued to work against their former brethren, doing so in the interests of the kingdom. Some time later, it was discovered that Kurzen himself had been executed by his followers for \"weakness\", who nonetheless continued their unhinged plans.\nSwamp of Sorrows.\nTo combat an increasing &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; presence within the &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20of%20Sorrows\"&gt;Swamp of Sorrows&lt;/a&gt; region around the time of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; deployed the army to the area. Under the command of Commander &lt;a href=\"Joanna%20Blueheart\"&gt;Joanna Blueheart&lt;/a&gt;, this Stormwindian army established a base at the port of &lt;a href=\"Marshtide%20Watch\"&gt;Marshtide Watch&lt;/a&gt;. The army's objective became the checking of Horde advances from the recently resurgent settlement of &lt;a href=\"Stonard\"&gt;Stonard&lt;/a&gt; nearby, a presence which lay perilously close to the Kingdom's borders.\nThe two sides clashed brutally upon the &lt;a href=\"Bloodmire\"&gt;Bloodmire&lt;/a&gt;, the region lying evenly between Marshtide and Stonard. The battle gradually escalated, drawing in more and more forces from both sides, and eventually involving heavy shock troops such as mounted &lt;a href=\"knight\"&gt;knight&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Stonard%20Ogre\"&gt;ogres&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href=\"siege%20weapon\"&gt;siege weapon&lt;/a&gt;s. Despite heavy losses for both sides, the Stormwind Army eventually gained the upper hand, forcing the Horde forces back to Stonard itself. A subsequent attempt to seize the settlement was fought off by Stonard's defenders, though the position remains threatened.\nBlasted Lands.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; historically maintained a constant presence at &lt;a href=\"Nethergarde%20Keep\"&gt;Nethergarde Keep&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt; in order to keep careful watch over the looming &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;. When the &lt;a href=\"Dalaran%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Magocracy of Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; was destroyed by &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"second%20invasion\"&gt;second invasion&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, Nethergarde's continued survival depended on support from Stormwind, as the keep was supplied by &lt;a href=\"Nethergarde%20caravan\"&gt;a caravan&lt;/a&gt; from the capital, and by &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;heroes&lt;/a&gt; who traveled into the Blasted Lands.\nThe Dark Portal was eventually &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal%20Opens\"&gt;reopened&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Kazzak\"&gt;Lord Kazzak&lt;/a&gt;, who ushered forth large forces of demons from the broken world of &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. A large contingent of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Marshal\"&gt;Stormwind Marshal&lt;/a&gt;s under the command of &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Marshal%20Raynor\"&gt;Lord Marshal Raynor&lt;/a&gt; was dispatched by Stormwind to aid in the defense of the region, and in pushing back the invasion.\nSimilarly to before, the army was deployed along the &lt;a href=\"7th%20Fleet\"&gt;7th Fleet&lt;/a&gt; in the Blasted Lands shortly before the onset of the &lt;a href=\"war%20in%20Draenor\"&gt;war in Draenor&lt;/a&gt;. This time, in response to the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s sacking of &lt;a href=\"Nethergarde%20Keep\"&gt;Nethergarde Keep&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Beachhead\"&gt;Shattered Beachhead&lt;/a&gt; was established north of &lt;a href=\"Shattershore\"&gt;Shattershore&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Marine%20%28Blasted%20Lands%29\"&gt;Marines&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Cannoneer%20%28Blasted%20Lands%29\"&gt;cannoneers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Sea%20Wolf\"&gt;sea wolves&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Sailor\"&gt;sailors&lt;/a&gt; were sent under the command of &lt;a href=\"Vindicator%20Maraad\"&gt;Vindicator Maraad&lt;/a&gt; to force back the &lt;a href=\"Ironmarch\"&gt;Ironmarch&lt;/a&gt;.\nKalimdor.\nFor the most part, the Stormwind Army has remained un-involved in the affairs of the continent of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. Although the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; have clashed regularly across the landmass, the forces of the Alliance have mostly been led by either the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; armies of &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; in the north and west, or by those of the city of &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Northwatch%20Expeditionary%20Unit\"&gt;Northwatch Expeditionary Unit&lt;/a&gt; around Kalimdor's &lt;a href=\"Central%20Kalimdor\"&gt;center&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Nijel%27s%20Point%20Guard\"&gt;Nijel's Point Guard&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Desolace\"&gt;Desolace&lt;/a&gt; seems to be the only distinct Stormwind garrison.\nAt some point, a contingent of Stormwind &lt;a href=\"Footman\"&gt;footmen&lt;/a&gt; and Alliance heroes followed &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;'s two halves, Lo'Gosh and a doppelganger of Varian, where they slayed the dragon broodmother &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Onyxia&lt;/a&gt; in her &lt;a href=\"Onyxia%27s%20Lair\"&gt;lair&lt;/a&gt;, in order to rescue the captive &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;PrinceAnduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe most recent direct deployment of Stormwind's army to Kalimdor occurred during the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, at the climax of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance-Horde%20war\"&gt;Alliance-Horde war&lt;/a&gt;. Working in tandem with the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Rebellion\"&gt;Darkspear Rebellion&lt;/a&gt; and other Horde factions, &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; sent a large force of Alliance troops to the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt; itself, to aid in the ongoing siege against &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"True%20Horde\"&gt;True Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Among this multi-racial force were many elements of the Stormwind Army, who were involved in spearheading the assault on &lt;a href=\"Bladefist%20Bay\"&gt;Bladefist Bay&lt;/a&gt; and pushing Hellscream's forces deeper into the city.\nOutland.\nHaving repelled an invasion by the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; through the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; pushed the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s back through to the barren world of &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. There, the mortals fought ceaselessly to secure and hold the &lt;a href=\"Stair%20of%20Destiny\"&gt;Stair of Destiny&lt;/a&gt; on the other side. Operating under &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Duron\"&gt;Commander Duron&lt;/a&gt;, the Alliance's forces consisted of troops from every one of the faction's races. Prominent among these were soldiers from the Stormwind Army, who fought alongside their fellow allies and the Horde to throw endless waves of demons back from their &lt;a href=\"Forge%20site%23Invasion%20Points\"&gt;invasion points&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo support the Alliance's armies in Outland, numerous &lt;a href=\"portal%20%28spell%29\"&gt;portals&lt;/a&gt; were opened back to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;, utilizing the kingdom's resources to further the war effort. With a connection reestablished with the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Lothar\"&gt;Sons of Lothar&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Honor%20Hold\"&gt;Honor Hold&lt;/a&gt;, the Alliance was now a firm presence on the world, and set about dealing with any and all threats.\nNorthrend.\nWhen the awakened &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Undead Scourge&lt;/a&gt; armies began to threaten the stability of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, the Stormwind Army was one of many forces deployed to defeat the undead. At the outset of the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, Scourge forces assaulted &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; itself, clashing with Stormwind's troops throughout the area. Eventually, these attacks were repelled, and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; began to prepare for a monumental expedition to the Scourge's home in the frigid continent of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Stormwind Army subsequently formed the majority of the subsequent &lt;a href=\"Valiance%20Expedition\"&gt;Valiance Expedition&lt;/a&gt; to Northrend, itself a part of the even larger &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Vanguard\"&gt;Alliance Vanguard&lt;/a&gt;. In the ensuing campaign, Stormwind's armies would see action in almost every region of the continent.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Borean%20Tundra\"&gt;Borean Tundra&lt;/a&gt; acted as one of the army's major staging points, as they operated from the base at &lt;a href=\"Valiance%20Keep\"&gt;Valiance Keep&lt;/a&gt; against both the Scourge and the expedition's Horde equivalent, the &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Offensive\"&gt;Warsong Offensive&lt;/a&gt;. Early on, the expedition's forces were successful in driving off numerous threats, including a large Scourge siege of Valiance Keep. On the other side of the continent in the &lt;a href=\"Howling%20Fjord\"&gt;Howling Fjord&lt;/a&gt;, more forces from Stormwind established a similar position at the port of &lt;a href=\"Valgarde\"&gt;Valgarde&lt;/a&gt;. Though no Scourge armies were present, the expedition still had to face highly determined attacks by the local &lt;a href=\"Dragonflayer%20clan\"&gt;Dragonflayer clan&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt;. Once again, Alliance and Stormwindian forces would clash with Horde elements in the vicinity, this time the &lt;a href=\"forsaken\"&gt;forsaken&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Hand%20of%20Vengeance\"&gt;Hand of Vengeance&lt;/a&gt; based out of &lt;a href=\"Vengeance%20Landing\"&gt;Vengeance Landing&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Stormwind Army consistently maintained a major presence within Northrend's central region of &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"High%20Commander%20Halford%20Wyrmbane\"&gt;High Commander Halford Wyrmbane&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"7th%20Legion\"&gt;7th Legion&lt;/a&gt; would operate from the large fortress of &lt;a href=\"Wintergarde%20Keep\"&gt;Wintergarde Keep&lt;/a&gt;, which would eventually be besieged by the infamous Scourge necropolis &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt;. After a long battle, the 7th Legion would ultimately succeed in breaking the siege and driving the undead back. To the west, &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Highlord Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; marshaled his armies around &lt;a href=\"Fordragon%20Hold\"&gt;Fordragon Hold&lt;/a&gt;, located just outside &lt;a href=\"Angrathar%20the%20Wrathgate\"&gt;Angrathar the Wrathgate&lt;/a&gt;, in preparation for an assault on the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;'s base in &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt;. In an unprecedented event, the Alliance and Horde forces working together to take the Wrathgate were dramatically betrayed by &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Apothecary%20Putress\"&gt;Grand Apothecary Putress&lt;/a&gt; and a rogue faction of &lt;a href=\"forsaken\"&gt;forsaken&lt;/a&gt;. The ensuing disaster cost both the Alliance and Horde dearly, and dealt a particularly heavy blow to the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, who subsequently lost one of their greatest heroes in addition to thousands of soldiers.\nEven after the setback at the Wrathgate, the army continued to take an active part in the campaign. When Azeroth's armies eventually invaded Icecrown itself, Stormwindian troops were involved in attacking and seizing parts of the region. Another large defeat was suffered at the hands of both the Horde and the Scourge, when an attack against Scourge forces holding was hit from behind by &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; elements. Personally taking part in the final assault on &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt; to defeat the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; once and for all, &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; ordered the deployment of numerous regiments of the Stormwind Army to help take control of the fortress. Alliance and Horde forces once more clashed during this engagement.\nWith the eventual defeat of the Lich King atop Icecrown Citadel, the war in Northrend came to a decisive conclusion. The majority of the Stormwind Army now returned home, having distinguished itself during the campaign. The incredible cost in lives, however, was felt dearly at home. Memorial services were held regularly for years to come in Stormwind's &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt; to honor the tens of thousands of Stormwindians who fell.\nPandaria.\nWith the rediscovery of the lost continent of &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, tensions between the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; began to flare once more. Though several major naval battles occurred between the two sides from early in the conflict, the Stormwind Army saw its first action with the launch of , . From the base at &lt;a href=\"Lion%27s%20Landing\"&gt;Lion's Landing&lt;/a&gt;, Stormwindian troops and other Alliance soldiers quickly established themselves and began working to oppose the Horde's &lt;a href=\"Dominance%20Offensive\"&gt;Dominance Offensive&lt;/a&gt; based at the &lt;a href=\"Domination%20Point\"&gt;Domination Point&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Stormwind Army played a minor role during the &lt;a href=\"Purge%20of%20Dalaran\"&gt;Purge of Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, largely supporting the efforts of &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; as she forcibly removed all traces of the Horde from the city.\nDraenor.\nWhen the future of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; was threatened once more by the arrival of the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt; from a distant timeline, the army of Stormwind was once more called into action alongside the world's other nations. Both the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; spearheaded attacks to drive back the invaders, eventually pushing them back through the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; to . Led by &lt;a href=\"Vindicator%20Maraad\"&gt;Vindicator Maraad&lt;/a&gt;, the Alliance armies that would advance into the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;ish home world contained a large Stormwindian element.\nTo establish itself on Draenor, the Alliance constructed numerous bases across the continent. The most prominent of these included &lt;a href=\"Stormshield\"&gt;Stormshield&lt;/a&gt; on the island of &lt;a href=\"Ashran\"&gt;Ashran&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Lunarfall\"&gt;Lunarfall Garrison&lt;/a&gt; of , and the position at &lt;a href=\"Southport\"&gt;Southport&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Spires%20of%20Arak\"&gt;Spires of Arak&lt;/a&gt;. In these cases, the majority of the settlements' strength was drawn from the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; and the Stormwind Army. In Ashran in particular, these forces would clash with those of the Horde, based from nearby &lt;a href=\"Warspear\"&gt;Warspear&lt;/a&gt;, over possession of the island and its valuable resources.\nAs the &lt;a href=\"war%20in%20Draenor\"&gt;war in Draenor&lt;/a&gt; gradually progressed, the battle moved to &lt;a href=\"Tanaan%20Jungle\"&gt;Tanaan Jungle&lt;/a&gt;, where the remainder of the Iron Horde had allied itself with the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Alliance forces, heavily supported by the Stormwind Army, subsequently established a base in the jungle known as &lt;a href=\"Lion%27s%20Watch\"&gt;Lion's Watch&lt;/a&gt; from which they prosecuted their campaign against the orcs and &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s based out of .\nBroken Isles.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; began following the conclusion of the &lt;a href=\"war%20in%20Draenor\"&gt;war in Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, the forces of almost every faction in &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; were subsequently marshaled to drive the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s back to save the world. Such was the gravity of the situation that the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; united their armies for a singular assault on the Legion's base of power on Azeroth, the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;. The Stormwind Army was personally led on the field by &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, and fought fiercely alongside the other races of the Alliance in the ensuing &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for the Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;.\nDespite the great size of the armies facing the Legion, the demons' numbers eventually began to overwhelm the beleaguered mortals. Having suffered heavy losses, Stormwindian forces and the rest of the Alliance and Horde fighters initiated a desperate retreat from the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;. Sacrificing himself to save his remaining forces, King Varian was ultimately slain by the &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; . The battle proved a military disaster for those resisting the Legion's invasion, though the offensive against the demons continued.\nFollowing the defeat, Alliance forces returned to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; to begin preparing for the next assault on the Broken Isles. With the death of Varian Wrynn, his son &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin&lt;/a&gt; was crowned King of Stormwind, in doing so becoming the new leader of Stormwind's armed forces. &lt;a href=\"Lion%27s%20Rest\"&gt;A memorial&lt;/a&gt; was later erected in Stormwind's former &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Park\"&gt;Park District&lt;/a&gt; in honor of Varian, as well as all those Alliance soldiers who fell during the battle.\nOrganization.\nThe Stormwind Army appears to be divided into at least three distinct sections: the domestic &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Guard\"&gt;Stormwind Guard&lt;/a&gt; that garrison and protect the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; itself, the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City%20Guard\"&gt;Stormwind City Guard&lt;/a&gt; which act as the law enforcement and protectors of Stormwind City, and the more offensive armies that are deployed abroad to defend the interests of the kingdom and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. What exactly determines one's posting in this regard is unclear, though troops fighting in the field are presumably better trained or armed than local guards serving peacekeeping functions.\nOther areas of the armed forces, such as the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Fleet\"&gt;Stormwind Fleet&lt;/a&gt;, tend to work very closely with the army to ensure success, while other organizations such as are also known to supplement the army in the field.\nThough recruits for the army are drawn from all across the kingdom, groupings within the army (such as brigades) are often organized according to the region or city of origin. The &lt;a href=\"Westfall%20Brigade\"&gt;Westfall Brigade&lt;/a&gt;, for example, is presumably composed exclusively of &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt; residents, lending the unit a sense of belonging, and the soldiers within a certain level of unity. &lt;a href=\"Unit%20Goldshire\"&gt;Unit Goldshire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Unit%20Darkshire\"&gt;Unit Darkshire&lt;/a&gt; were similarly active units during the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn time of war, the King can order all able-bodied citizens of the Alliance to report to recruiting officers. [[Stormwind Army Registrar]]s are notably in charge of recruiting new soldiers and keep records for the Stormwind Army.\nHierarchy.\n[[File:Alliance military ranks.jpg|thumb|A list of some military ranks within the [[Alliance]] and the Stormwind Army.]]\nWithin the Stormwind Army, there are numerous ranks that denote the level of authority given to a certain individual. At the very top of this chain of command is the monarch of the [[Stormwind (kingdom)|Kingdom of Stormwind]], currently his highness [[Anduin Wrynn|King Anduin Wrynn]]. \nIn the event the monarch is absent, or otherwise unable to fulfill their duties, a Regent may instead act as head of military matters, as evidenced by [[Anduin Lothar]]'s and [[Bolvar Fordragon]]'s past roles as Regents of Stormwind.\nThe Generals presumably rank next highly, although certain specific positions such as Highlord or High Commander represent a similarly high rank. Beyond this, the hierarchy follows a generally standard system, ending at the bottom with the rank of [[:Private]]. Although Private is the lowest enlisted rank, the army has been known to recruit militia troops on occasion, who likely rank even lower due to the impermanent nature of their position.\nFor the most part, promotion within the Stormwind Army functions as a meritocracy, with high ranks being given to those who prove themselves, rather than along aristocratic lines. There exist numerous examples of army members rising rapidly through the ranks to attain extremely high positions of command, as evidenced by [[Taylor|Commander Taylor]]'s rise from Captain to Admiral.\nDivisions.\n[[File:Stormwind Banner 2.jpg|thumb|upright|The banner of Stormwind, usually found wherever the army operates.]]\nReferences.\n[[Category:Stormwind Army| ]]\n[[Category:Human organizations]]\n[[Category:Stormwind (kingdom)]]"}

Stormwind's willingness to work with others to find diplomatic solutions stands out as one of its true strengths. Its citizens hold fast to the principles of honor and justice as they defend their settlements, and the Alliance, against any aggressors.\nNo city better demonstrates human determination than Stormwind. Destroyed during the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;initial invasion of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, Stormwind was painstakingly reconstructed by the &lt;a href=\"Stonemasons%20Guild\"&gt;Stonemasons' Guild&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;. Parts of the city were razed again when &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, the corrupted black Dragon Aspect, brutally attacked Stormwind, but the other undamaged districts are more beautiful than ever thanks to their hardworking inhabitants. From the magnificent &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt;, which serves as a major spiritual hub, to the awe-inspiring &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Heroes\"&gt;Valley of Heroes&lt;/a&gt;, which commemorates the sacrifices of Stormwind's loyal champions, the city truly represents the courageous heart of &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;ity, and serves as a bastion of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City%20Guard\"&gt;Stormwind City Guard&lt;/a&gt; are the law enforcement and protectors of Stormwind City, keeping the peace within the city's walls.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nThe kingdom of Stormwind was originally founded 1,200 years before the First War by the descendants of the &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20tribe\"&gt;Arathi&lt;/a&gt; bloodline, who had migrated south from the nation of &lt;a href=\"Arathor\"&gt;Arathor&lt;/a&gt;. Traveling past the rocky mountains of &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;, their journey finally ended after many long seasons, and they settled in the northern region of the continent they would name &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28continent%29\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. In a fertile valley, they founded the kingdom of Stormwind, which quickly became a self-sufficient power in its own right. It had a long and prosperous history, with the king served loyally by the knights of the &lt;a href=\"Brotherhood%20of%20the%20Horse\"&gt;Brotherhood of the Horse&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"cleric\"&gt;cleric&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Clerics%20of%20Northshire\"&gt;Holy Order of Northshire Clerics&lt;/a&gt;. Secretive &lt;a href=\"conjurer\"&gt;conjurer&lt;/a&gt;s also served the kingdom, and as such &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt; had its own &lt;a href=\"Court%20Conjurer\"&gt;court conjurer&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; was also present in the kingdom, as &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt; was acquainted with their fellow wizards in the realm.\nThe constant bickering and infighting that marred the rules of the former kings of Arathor had no place in the &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Stormwind\"&gt;court of Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, and all had been peaceful for many generations in the kingdom until the &lt;a href=\"Gnoll%20War\"&gt;Gnoll War&lt;/a&gt;. King &lt;a href=\"Barathen%20Wrynn\"&gt;Barathen Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; ended the conflict by scattering the unified &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt; packs and bringing back peace, solidifying the rule of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Wrynn\"&gt;Wrynn dynasty&lt;/a&gt; over the entire kingdom.\nFollowing the Gnoll War, the Kingdom of Stormwind began expanding its borders, much to the displeasure of the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20tribe\"&gt;Gurubashi&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"jungle%20troll\"&gt;jungle troll&lt;/a&gt; tribes. A series of smaller conflicts between the two factions erupted over time, largely over the territories bordering &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt; that Stormwindian settlers began expanding into. Though initially isolated, the conflict quickly escalated out of control, despite the best efforts of Stormwind's &lt;a href=\"Barathen%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Barathen Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;. The final provocation came when &lt;a href=\"Llane%20Wrynn\"&gt;Prince Llane Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; personally led a small party to strike at the Gurubashi leadership in central Stranglethorn, which succeeded in uniting the trolls against Stormwind. Though costly and close-run, the human kingdom eventually emerged victorious, largely due to the intervention of the &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;. With the entire troll army completely destroyed or routed at the gates of Stormwind City, the &lt;a href=\"jungle%20troll\"&gt;jungle troll&lt;/a&gt;s of the south would never succeed in threatening the kingdom again. This bloody conflict was known as the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20War\"&gt;Gurubashi War&lt;/a&gt;, and the Stormwindians enjoyed nearly two decades of relative peace after emerging victorious. King Barathen was one of the casualties of the Gurubashi War, and Llane succeeded him as king in the aftermath of the war.\nBefore the First War started, Stormwind was a city of considerable size, greater in spread than &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;. Three full sets of walls ribboned around &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt;, with lesser barriers separating the different wards. Great towers sprung from the streets and a surging river cascade had been harnessed by massive waterwheels.\nFirst War.\nWhen reports of mysterious creatures lurking around the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Morass\"&gt;Black Morass&lt;/a&gt; reached Stormwind, rumors spread through the streets that they were either vengeful spirits, &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s armed with some new breed of power, or a strange race from across the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Llane%20Wrynn%20I\"&gt;King Llane&lt;/a&gt; dispatched &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Sir Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt; to uncover what these new creatures were. Lothar led a small force of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20Stormwind\"&gt;Knights of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; to scout the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Morass\"&gt;Black Morass&lt;/a&gt;, resulting in their first clash with the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s in a series of bloody skirmishes. He informed King Llane that the invaders were bringing in reinforcements from somewhere, and the kingdom readied itself for a full-scale war that became known as the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;. Llane had named Lothar the \"King's Champion\", the highest military rank in the kingdom, and entrusted him to end the orcish threat.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Brightwood\"&gt;Brightwood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt; had eventually fallen, the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; marched onto Stormwind City. Thousands of Horde soldiers marched through &lt;a href=\"Elwynn%20Forest\"&gt;Elwynn Forest&lt;/a&gt; and encircled Stormwind, cutting off all access except for the sea. Warchief &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; had ordered &lt;a href=\"Kilrogg%20Deadeye\"&gt;Kilrogg Deadeye&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt; to lead their &lt;a href=\"Bleeding%20Hollow%20clan\"&gt;Bleeding Hollow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; clans in the assault on Stormwind. To weaken the city's defenses, &lt;a href=\"siege%20engine\"&gt;siege engine&lt;/a&gt;s bombarded the city walls through the night, and at dawn Kilrogg and Cho'gall launched their attack. While orcs charged the battlements, &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s engulfed Stormwind's soldiers in &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; fire, resulting in staggering losses. As it seemed Stormwind would fall that day, there were suddenly cries of an attack from the Horde's rear lines. Lothar and the majority of Stormwind's &lt;a href=\"knight\"&gt;knight&lt;/a&gt;s had moved around the Horde by sea. The King's Commander was now leading a charge through Elwynn Forest, catching the orcs in the rearguard completely by surprise as the knights cut through their lines. As the Bleeding Hollow and Twilight's Hammer tried to push back the knights, Stormwind's large gates opened and soldiers poured out of the city to flank the orcs in a counterattack. Outflanked on both sides and suffering many casualties, the orcs were left with no choice but to flee.\nAround the year 3 or 4, King Llane was assassinated by &lt;a href=\"Garona%20Halforcen\"&gt;Garona Halforcen&lt;/a&gt; in the keep. After his death, the city was overrun, razing it to ashes.\nAnduin Lothar took what was left of the people and led their &lt;a href=\"Refugee%23Exodus%20of%20Stormwind\"&gt;exodus&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. While there, &lt;a href=\"Alonsus%20Faol\"&gt;Alonsus Faol&lt;/a&gt; told him that he had started to raise funds to rebuilt Stormwind once they reclaimed it.\nSecond War and reconstruction.\nAfter its destruction, the ruins of Stormwind City were lorded over by the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Stormreaver%20clan\"&gt;Stormreaver clan&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s defeat during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, men returned to the ruins of Stormwind City and began to rebuild the once great city as a testament to their own survival. As the Supreme commander of the Alliance of Lordaeron, &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; helped &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Prince Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; secure his place as Stormwind's next king by providing him with experienced ministers and advisors. He also oversaw the repatriation of the citizens of Stormwind, and the construction of the &lt;a href=\"Deeprun%20Tram\"&gt;Deeprun Tram&lt;/a&gt; between Stormwind City and &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; with the help of &lt;a href=\"Gelbin%20Mekkatorque\"&gt;Gelbin Mekkatorque&lt;/a&gt;. In time, Stormwind City was painstakingly reconstructed by the &lt;a href=\"Stonemasons%20Guild\"&gt;Stonemasons Guild&lt;/a&gt;, who were contracted by Stormwind's &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Nobles\"&gt;House of Nobles&lt;/a&gt;. They restored Stormwind to its former majesty, with white stone being used for its exterior. The city was renamed New Stormwind, rebuilt on the same location as the original capital, though after that the city came to be simply called Stormwind City once again.\nThe &lt;a href=\"internment%20camps\"&gt;internment camps&lt;/a&gt;' authorities were based at first in New Stormwind under &lt;a href=\"Danath%20Trollbane\"&gt;Danath Trollbane&lt;/a&gt;. Two years after the end of the Second War, the orcs reopened the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; and a small group led by &lt;a href=\"Teron%20Gorefiend\"&gt;Teron Gorefiend&lt;/a&gt; entered the city's &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Library\"&gt;library&lt;/a&gt; to steal the &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Medivh\"&gt;Book of Medivh&lt;/a&gt;. The book, however, had been at that point already stolen by &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Alterac&lt;/a&gt; soldiers and securely placed in the mountainous country.\nDuring the early days of the &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Invasion of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, Danath gathered all the &lt;a href=\"Mercenary\"&gt;mercenaries&lt;/a&gt; of Stormwind together and marched them to fight at &lt;a href=\"Nethergarde%20Keep\"&gt;Nethergarde Keep&lt;/a&gt;. After the &lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Lothar\"&gt;Sons of Lothar&lt;/a&gt; destroyed the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, five statues in the likeness of &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kurdran%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Kurdran Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Danath%20Trollbane\"&gt;Danath Trollbane&lt;/a&gt; were placed within Stormwind's &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Heroes\"&gt;Valley of Heroes&lt;/a&gt;, in order to commemorate their heroic deeds and to honor their ultimate sacrifice for the safety of Azeroth.\nPolitical unrest.\nThough Stormwind offered what support and resources they could to &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, they were also beset by their own internal problems. After the &lt;a href=\"Stonemasons%20Guild\"&gt;Stonemasons Guild&lt;/a&gt; spent years toiling to rebuild the glorious city, they were left broke, as their fees and salaries were left unpaid and unspoken for by the city's officials. When the time of the rightful payment came, the nobles of Stormwind couldn't because they ran up a huge debt by expanding the kingdom's military presence through &lt;a href=\"Elwynn%20Forest\"&gt;Elwynn&lt;/a&gt; and into &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn&lt;/a&gt;, and the massive debt crippled the kingdom's economy. In the shadow, &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Lady Katrana Prestor&lt;/a&gt; manipulated both sides with the &lt;a href=\"%3ADrakefire%20Amulet\"&gt;:Drakefire Amulet&lt;/a&gt; - her meddling in the rebuilding of Stormwind left the nobility unsatisfied with the craftsmanship of the guild, while the workers were enraged that the nobility despised them and were threatening to withhold payment. When the Guildmaster of the Stonemasons &lt;a href=\"Edwin%20VanCleef\"&gt;Edwin VanCleef&lt;/a&gt; spoke out, demanding restitution for their works, the Stormwind House of Nobles ordered the Stonemasons' Guild disbanded, and it turned into a heated dispute, which resulted in riots that led to the murder of Queen Tiffin.\nIn response, &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; vowed to punish those responsible and dealt with the rioters more severely. The Stonemasons, fleeing the city, hid in the rural areas of &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt; to escape prosecution. Knowing Varian's anger would never fade, many were forced to remain in hiding. The Stonemasons became the terrorist organization known as the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; and sowed anarchy and terror in the lands of Stormwind for the next decade. King Varian, shaken by his wife's death, fell into a great depression. &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Katrana%20Prestor\"&gt;Lady Katrana Prestor&lt;/a&gt; took advantage of this opportunity and used politics and sorcery to politically outmaneuver the king in the coming years. Yet in time, King Varian slowly regained his political clout, with his son &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; being his primary inspiration.\nAfter the dust had settled from the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, Varian journeyed to &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore Isle&lt;/a&gt; to speak with Lady &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; regarding the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; relations. En route, he was abducted by the Defias who had been told of his diplomatic trip through a spy rumored to live within the Kingdom of Stormwind itself. Rumors circulated that he was taken to &lt;a href=\"Alcaz%20Island\"&gt;Alcaz Island&lt;/a&gt; and was held captive there. These rumors were true, yet they were also false, for Varian was split into two people after a botched ritual to subdue Varians' will conducted by &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Onyxia&lt;/a&gt;. While one of the twins retained all of his wits, charm, and patience, the other retained his will, ferocity, and skills in battle, where the latter escaped his captivity. For the past two years following his abduction, Varian was robbed of his memories and enslaved by a &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; gladiatorial trainer called &lt;a href=\"Rehgar%20Earthfury\"&gt;Rehgar Earthfury&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. \nAs King Varian Wrynn went missing under suspicious circumstances, Stormwind was believed to be going through a state of disarray. Young Anduin was given the crown so that order could be preserved within the kingdom of Stormwind, at the behest of the royal councilor, Lady Prestor. &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Highlord Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; acted as the Regent of Stormwind and the Supreme Commander of Stormwind's forces on behalf of King Anduin, with Lady Prestor advising Bolvar on the proper use of Stormwind's resources. While Lord Bolvar did his best to aid King Anduin with ruling the kingdom, Lady Prestor secretly worked to sow chaos and discord within the kingdom behind the scenes, while pretending to aid the young king in public. \nWorld of Warcraft.\nWith the recent invasion of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, which left the northern &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; in ruins, the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Stormwind\"&gt;Kingdom of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; stood as the strongest bastion of human civilization. The &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; since then has been reorganized and gained new allies in the following years, with the humans of Stormwind standing resolute in their charge to maintain the honor and might of humanity. Stormwind firmly backs the Alliance with its &lt;a href=\"knight\"&gt;knight&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s; many of whom served in the three wars against the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;.\nStormwind City is a marvel of human design and engineering. From the magnificent &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt;, which serves as a major spiritual hub, to the awe-inspiring &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Heroes\"&gt;Valley of Heroes&lt;/a&gt;, which commemorates the sacrifices of Stormwind's loyal champions, the city truly represents the courageous heart of humanity. The &lt;a href=\"Trade%20District\"&gt;Trade District&lt;/a&gt; bustles with trade from across the continent and beyond, while &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s of every sort can be found wandering the streets of &lt;a href=\"Old%20Town\"&gt;Old Town&lt;/a&gt;. Some merchants can be found carting their exotic wares on the cobblestone streets, such as those found in the &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20District\"&gt;Dwarven District&lt;/a&gt;. Another area of note is &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Harbor\"&gt;Stormwind Harbor&lt;/a&gt;, which acts as a dock for transport ships and a &lt;a href=\"shipyard\"&gt;shipyard&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20navy\"&gt;Alliance navy&lt;/a&gt;. Though the city is bustling with trade and business, Alliance citizens can also find peace and relaxation in the preserved natural local attractions of the city and the recreational activities available there. Tourists and children can be found playing and fishing around the various canals, docks, and lakes throughout the city. Many have even found tranquility outside the metropolitan districts in the more rural &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City%20Outskirts\"&gt;city outskirts&lt;/a&gt;. Racially diverse, heavily populated, an epicenter of culture and trade, Stormwind is acknowledged by many to be the very heart of the Alliance.\nPrimarily a human settlement, a fair number of high elves, Ironforge dwarves, and even a few night elves and gnomes dwell here as well. Stormwind City is the home of the &lt;a href=\"Academy%20of%20Arcane%20Sciences\"&gt;Academy of Arcane Sciences&lt;/a&gt;, the only remaining school of wizardry in the east, and the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt;, the philosophical capital for those who follow the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt; and the base of operations of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Order of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; in the kingdom. These edifices draw healers, priests, paladins, and mages to the city, all of whom bolster Stormwind's vast military. Its vigilant &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City%20Guard\"&gt;City Guard&lt;/a&gt; keep the peace within the city's towering stone walls and the elite &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Royal%20Guard\"&gt;Stormwind Royal Guard&lt;/a&gt; protect the monarchy and patrol the outlying region of &lt;a href=\"Elwynn%20Forest\"&gt;Elwynn Forest&lt;/a&gt; on horseback. The &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Wrynn\"&gt;House of Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; rules the city and kingdom from &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt;. Rumor has it that Wrynn employs a secret society of rogues known as , who are spies, assassins, and saboteurs wielding royal \"carte blanche\".\"\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; had been victim to massive mystic struggles, which tore magic currents from once stable channels, the &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Wizard%27s%20Sanctum\"&gt;Wizard's Sanctum&lt;/a&gt; struggled to determine the effects these changes had caused, and some of them feared the worst. When the flow of magic in Stormwind City and &lt;a href=\"Elwynn%20Forest\"&gt;Elwynn Forest&lt;/a&gt; was somehow altered, they sent a mage &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20Lake\"&gt;Mirror Lake&lt;/a&gt;, in order to test its water for magical properties before those who drank from it would be adversely affected.\nDuring the first &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20Invasion\"&gt;Scourge Invasion&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; attacked Stormwind City. Bolvar Fordragon later led an Alliance counterattack and recruited heroes who raided &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt; and defeated &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;.\nPrior to the start of the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt;, the gates of Stormwind were invaded by a group of &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s led by &lt;a href=\"Highlord%20Kruul\"&gt;Highlord Kruul&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Comic.\nAs the second Varian fought his way across &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; to freedom, earning the nickname \u201cLo'Gosh\" (or \u201cghost wolf\") in the &lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Ring\"&gt;Crimson Ring&lt;/a&gt;, meanwhile in Stormwind, jubilant throngs of Stormwind's subjects turned out for a massive ceremony to welcome home their king. However, the &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; that returned was arrogant, frivolous, and markedly interested in Katrana Prestor. The people of Stormwind had only been informed that the Defias had ransomed the king, but in truth, he was somehow imprisoned and ransomed back by some naga. In either case, his freedom was bought and paid for by a painful new tax. Upon his return, however, Varian seemed concerned only with spending more of his people's money, leaving affairs of state by the wayside.\nEventually, Lo'Gosh, with the help of his allies fought their way back to Stormwind. Marching through the gates of Stormwind, they were halted by &lt;a href=\"General%20Marcus%20Jonathan\"&gt;General Marcus Jonathan&lt;/a&gt; under the direct jurisdiction of Katrana Prestor, who ordered their immediate arrest and execution as traitors. However, &lt;a href=\"Reginald%20Windsor\"&gt;Reginald Windsor&lt;/a&gt; succeeded in convincing Marcus of his loyalty to Stormwind, as they had previously served together under &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt;. Katrana Prestor hastily gathered soldiers only to have the false-Varian tell her that she was disobeying the chain of command and was not in charge of Stormwind. Entering Stormwind Keep, Lo'Gosh declared Katrana's masquerade was over and called her by her true name: &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Onyxia&lt;/a&gt;. Revealing her dragon form and transforming multiple guards into &lt;a href=\"dragonspawn\"&gt;dragonspawn&lt;/a&gt;, a battle began in the great hall of Stormwind Keep. The arrival of &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Highlord Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; along with &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; greatly aided them in securing the keep, but Reginald Windsor was killed moments later by Onyxia. At the end of the battle, the great black dragon snatched Anduin and teleported them to her lair; daring King Varian to follow suit. Left to grieve the loss of their son, Lo'Gosh and Varian mobilized the troops of Stormwind as the final battle would end in &lt;a href=\"Onyxia%27s%20Lair\"&gt;Onyxia's Lair&lt;/a&gt;.\nLeading a mounted charge with their forces, both Varians cut bloody swathes into Onyxia's dragonspawn ranks. Eventually, they encountered the brood mother herself, with Anduin imprisoned and held as a hostage, threatening to kill him if Varian didn't surrender Stormwind over to her. After the prince was saved by &lt;a href=\"Broll%20Bearmantle\"&gt;Broll Bearmantle&lt;/a&gt;, both Varians engaged Onyxia with all of their might. Becoming desperate to end the fight, Onyxia began casting the spell she was going to use on &lt;a href=\"Alcaz%20Island\"&gt;Alcaz Island&lt;/a&gt; to kill Lo'Gosh, but the spell was disrupted and King Varian emerged, his two halves fused back together, with his newly-fused elven sword &lt;a href=\"Shalamayne\"&gt;Shalamayne&lt;/a&gt;. After he killed the Broodmother, Varian told his allies that their long and noble deeds would be rewarded and that Stormwind had been reborn with a new hope for the future. He then decapitated Onyxia and sent her head to be hung from the ramparts of Stormwind.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nDuring the second &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20Invasion\"&gt;Scourge Invasion&lt;/a&gt;, the city was once again attacked by the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; and later, their advance covered in mists, stormed &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Harbor\"&gt;Stormwind Harbor&lt;/a&gt;. The undead faced the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Army\"&gt;Stormwind Army&lt;/a&gt; and many &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s led by King Varian Wrynn who fought alongside &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt;. When a &lt;a href=\"Necropolis\"&gt;Necropolis&lt;/a&gt; came over them, Varian ordered his magi to create a magical shield over the city, then they cast both spells of fire and ice to create swirling winds in order to drive the flying fortress back to the ocean. At the same time, &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;King Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; sent &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s in their &lt;a href=\"bomber\"&gt;bomber&lt;/a&gt;s as reinforcements, who managed to destroy the necropolis and many &lt;a href=\"frost%20wyrm\"&gt;frost wyrm&lt;/a&gt;s. In the end, Stormwind won over the Scourge, and consequently, King Varian created the &lt;a href=\"Valiance%20Expedition\"&gt;Valiance Expedition&lt;/a&gt; to put an end to the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, as both the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; launched separate campaigns in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Battle for Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thassarian\"&gt;Thassarian&lt;/a&gt; was sent to Stormwind City to meet King Varian with a letter of &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt;. As the representative of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt;, now freed of the Lich King's control, the population of the capital treated him as an abomination, they threw projectiles, insulted, and spat on him during his walk to the king's castle. In the end, King Varian trusted Tirion's word and accepted the death knights to join the Alliance, ordering his people to treat them with due respect.\nAt some point during the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, King Varian Wrynn launched a &lt;a href=\"The%20Battle%20for%20the%20Undercity\"&gt;full assault&lt;/a&gt; on the Undercity, in order to bring &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Apothecary%20Putress\"&gt;Grand Apothecary Putress&lt;/a&gt; to justice for his crimes during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Angrathar%20the%20Wrathgate\"&gt;Battle of Angrathar the Wrathgate&lt;/a&gt;. After the Alliance forces beheaded Putress in the &lt;a href=\"Apothecarium\"&gt;Apothecarium&lt;/a&gt;, Varian Wrynn, in grief over the loss of &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt;, and enraged by proof of the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;'s sinister schemes with the &lt;a href=\"New%20Plague\"&gt;New Plague&lt;/a&gt;, lashed out at &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and exchanged blows with him before being teleported back to Stormwind City with all his troops by &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnder King Varian's leadership, the proud humans of Stormwind led the Alliance to victory in its war against the dreaded Lich King. However, while successful, the campaign in Northrend proved costly.\nStormrage.\nFollowing the fall of the Lich King, the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; invaded &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and so attacked Stormwind City. Though many inhabitants were affected by the Nightmare, some, such as &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, were able to avoid it. The king of Stormwind was asked to lead the fight against the Nightmare in the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; and the battle was successful. After which, Stormwind City began to rebuild from the chaos caused by the &lt;a href=\"War%20Against%20the%20Nightmare\"&gt;War Against the Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nA great ceremony was held in honor of the thousands who died in the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;.\nShortly before the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, a meeting of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; leaders was held in the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt; to discuss the strange natural effects that have been felt across the world. They also discussed how to deal with the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; cult, as many of their &lt;a href=\"Doomsayer%20%28Alliance%29\"&gt;doomsayers&lt;/a&gt; came to the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Town\"&gt;Old Town&lt;/a&gt;, talking about the end of the world and trying to recruit &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Citizen%20%28Elemental%20Unrest%29\"&gt;Stormwind citizens&lt;/a&gt; into the &lt;a href=\"Doomsday%20Cult\"&gt;Doomsday Cult&lt;/a&gt;. Not long after this, the city was attacked by furious elements made of Wind and Water but the attack was repelled and the city was secure.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; returned, he marked his revival by flying a trip around &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. His massive power was enough to destroy and reshape the land where he appeared, which resulted in the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;. Stormwind City got its share of the destruction when Deathwing swooped into it, crashed down on the city gates, and wrecked parts of the city. The entire &lt;a href=\"park\"&gt;park&lt;/a&gt; was blown away, and his searing heat caused the towers where he landed to glow red. Afterward, he took the head of Onyxia and flew off, something which puzzles the city guards as they are certain he would be able to destroy the entire city if he had wanted to. Unnoticed but to cats and ratcatchers, when Deathwing descended upon Stormwind all the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Rat\"&gt;rats&lt;/a&gt; beat a hasty retreat from the city. Only of late have they returned.\nBlood of Our Fathers.\nNot long after &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; attacked Stormwind City, on the day of &lt;a href=\"Remembrance%20Day\"&gt;Remembrance Day&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Harbor\"&gt;Stormwind Harbor&lt;/a&gt; was full of hulls in every color, shape, and size, as the celebration always brought a host of pilgrims to honor and celebrate humanity's heroes. However, there were even more boats present than usual, as many civilians sought the protection of Stormwind following the ravages caused across &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the celebration, the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; cult tried to assassinate both King Varian and his son, Prince Anduin, at the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City%20Cemetery\"&gt;Stormwind City Cemetery&lt;/a&gt;; which they were lured to by &lt;a href=\"Archbishop%20Benedictus\"&gt;Archbishop Benedictus&lt;/a&gt; under the pretense of family bonding. While the Wrynns fended off the assassins, Benedictus tried to sway the Stormwind masses to the Twilight Hammer's cause. Later, much to everyone\u2019s surprise, Varian arrived at the ceremony. Limping onto a stage erected, disheveled, and covered in blood, King Varian told the people of Stormwind that though he had his faults, as their king, he had and always will have their best interests in mind. Even after Deathwing's attack, Stormwind would always remain vigilant and stand defiantly against their enemies. They will always rebuild from tragedy and continue to learn from adversity. Stormwind will continue to grow from every direction, forging a brighter future. Each day they are alive is a great day, for each generation finds its own way to become the greatest generation that has ever lived and become the heroes of tomorrow. Varian stated that though in the past they relied on strength and steel to forge their destiny, it is not the only way. In order to restore the world, a time would come when leaders need to be healers instead of warriors, those who mend instead of those who break. Only then can they truly cure their deep ills and achieve a lasting peace. Varian watched with pride as his words stirred the hearts of his people. The populace cheered for King Varian and this new direction for Stormwind.\nTides of War.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore Isle&lt;/a&gt; fell, black flags were raised at Stormwind's buildings in honor of those who died there. Later on, mass construction of Alliance ships took place in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Harbor\"&gt;Stormwind Harbor&lt;/a&gt; for the upcoming global &lt;a href=\"Alliance-Horde%20war\"&gt;Alliance-Horde war&lt;/a&gt;.\nMists of Pandaria.\nAt the time of the discovery of &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Tushui\"&gt;Tushui&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Wandering%20Isle\"&gt;Wandering Isle&lt;/a&gt; made their way to Stormwind, in order to pledge their allegiance to their new 'Emperor'. Their leader, &lt;a href=\"Aysa%20Cloudsinger\"&gt;Aysa Cloudsinger&lt;/a&gt; met &lt;a href=\"King%20Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; personally, and the Tushui quickly established a presence in the capital near the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Earthshrine\"&gt;Eastern Earthshrine&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; achieved a critical victory during the &lt;a href=\"Alliance-Horde%20war\"&gt;Alliance-Horde war&lt;/a&gt;, thwarting the plans of &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; to unleash the horrible powers of the &lt;a href=\"%3ADivine%20Bell\"&gt;:Divine Bell&lt;/a&gt;, the repairs of the damage caused by &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; neared completion. The front gate towers have been reconstructed, and the statue of &lt;a href=\"Danath%20Trollbane\"&gt;Danath Trollbane&lt;/a&gt; was back in place and mended to pristine condition. However, the area where the &lt;a href=\"Park\"&gt;Park&lt;/a&gt; still appeared black and charred, and the surrounding walls and buildings were still in ruins.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"war%20in%20Draenor\"&gt;war in Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; have built a camp on a plateau behind the city walls, overlooking &lt;a href=\"Mage%20Quarter\"&gt;Mage Quarter&lt;/a&gt;, called the Overlook. A portal is situated there, which is a gateway between the camp and the &lt;a href=\"Everbloom\"&gt;Everbloom&lt;/a&gt; outpost. After losing control of the situation there, the portal allowed &lt;a href=\"Gorgrond\"&gt;Gorgrond&lt;/a&gt; overgrowth to leak through it, while the &lt;a href=\"Primals\"&gt;Primals&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Yalnu\"&gt;Yalnu&lt;/a&gt; invaded the city until they were defeated by the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Zaela\"&gt;Warlord Zaela&lt;/a&gt; took control of the &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Upper Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt; and prepared to launch a doomsday weapon targeted at Stormwind, but they were stopped by the adventurers of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nThe hard-working citizens of Stormwind worked hard to rebuild &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Park\"&gt;Stormwind Park&lt;/a&gt; into the majestic &lt;a href=\"Lion%27s%20Rest\"&gt;Lion's Rest&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; launching their &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt; of Azeroth, &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Harbor\"&gt;Stormwind Harbor&lt;/a&gt; became the launching point for the Alliance forces sent to attack the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;. However, &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; died at the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Lion%27s%20Rest\"&gt;King Wrynn's tomb&lt;/a&gt; was displayed in a portion of the new park as well as a memorial listing the names of fallen Alliance soldiers. Consequently, &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Prince Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; was officially crowned the new king of Stormwind.\nDuring the conflict, the captain in charge of the guards of Stormwind, &lt;a href=\"Melris%20Malagan\"&gt;Melris Malagan&lt;/a&gt;, joined the ranks of the &lt;a href=\"Veiled%20Hand\"&gt;Veiled Hand&lt;/a&gt;. They later attacked the city, which was consequently put under lockdown, and the cultists tried to summon &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s until they were stopped by &lt;a href=\"Garona%20Halforcen\"&gt;Garona Halforcen&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; serving the &lt;a href=\"Uncrowned\"&gt;Uncrowned&lt;/a&gt;. Afterward, &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Detheroc\"&gt;Detheroc&lt;/a&gt; in disguise) let them leave the city as they succeeded in stopping the cultists before the agents could.\nAt the end of the invasion, a new &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Embassy\"&gt;embassy&lt;/a&gt; opened in the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City%20Outskirts\"&gt;city outskirts&lt;/a&gt;. Sometime after the end of the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20Campaign\"&gt;Argus Campaign&lt;/a&gt;, Anduin Wrynn had a speech for Alliance citizens at &lt;a href=\"Lion\"&gt;Lion&lt;/a&gt;'s Rest.\nAt some point, &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; offered pardons and reparations for the former &lt;a href=\"Stonemasons%20Guild\"&gt;Stonemasons Guild&lt;/a&gt; and their families. As King Varian died against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, it became harder to carry on old grudges, and the young king's reforms allowed more aid and resources to arrive at &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt;, which caused the spark of revolution to fade. Consequently, the majority of the former Stonemasons decided to leave the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;, returning to live in the kingdom and city they once rebuilt.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Thorns\"&gt;War of the Thorns&lt;/a&gt;, King Anduin ordered that the portals from &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; be constantly open throughout Stormwind City, and many night elven and Gilnean refugees arrived at the city, filling the Cathedral of Light and its catacombs, the city's inns, the keep, and the streets, through the Valley of Heroes, spilling out most of the way to Goldshire. &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; also took the wounded &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; here to recuperate from his injuries.\n&lt;a href=\"Princess%20Talanji\"&gt;Princess Talanji&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Prophet%20Zul\"&gt;Prophet Zul&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Empire\"&gt;Zandalari Empire&lt;/a&gt; were captured and imprisoned to the Stormwind Stockades. &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; was also imprisoned there after being captured during the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Siege of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. The Horde learned about the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari troll&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Warchief Sylvanas&lt;/a&gt; sent a small force to rescue them in order to gain new allies. The Horde was successful, but their presence was revealed to the Stormwind soldiers and soon they were discovered by &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; who tried to corner the infiltrators. As the agents were trying to escape their pursuers, Zul set the city ablaze by using a torch. Fighting through the soldiers that just came from Lordaeron in Stormwind Harbor, Jaina confronted the Horde group once more but was forced to abandon them as she saw the city burning. \n&lt;a href=\"Portal%20Keeper%20Romiir\"&gt;Portal Keeper Romiir&lt;/a&gt; stationed in &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"Faction%20Assaults\"&gt;Faction Assaults&lt;/a&gt; maintained a portal to Stormwind. Similarly, several &lt;a href=\"Purified\"&gt;Purified&lt;/a&gt; soldiers were portaled from Stormwind to &lt;a href=\"Drustvar\"&gt;Drustvar&lt;/a&gt; as well.\nAnduin Wrynn later let Varok Saurfang out of prison. Horde spies stationed in Stormwind learned about Varok's escape and informed Sylvanas.\nAfter being freed from the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Prison\"&gt;Last Prison&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt; began trying to tear down the veil separating the physical world from &lt;a href=\"Ny%27alotha\"&gt;Ny'alotha&lt;/a&gt;, and created the &lt;a href=\"Vision%20of%20Stormwind\"&gt;Vision of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;. This nightmarish realm represented how the Corruptor would reshape the city as a bastion of the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; if he won the war against the mortals and revived the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Empire\"&gt;Black Empire&lt;/a&gt; on Azeroth. The &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt; of Azeroth were sent by &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt; to venture deep into the horrific realm, confronting mad heralds and inscrutable horrors, in order to learn how to fight the corruption of N'Zoth.\nShadowlands.\nAfter King Anduin Wrynn's abduction by the &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; was appointed as regent and protector of Stormwind with the support of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Nobles\"&gt;House of Nobles&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"Death%20Rising\"&gt;Death Rising&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; sent their troops to patrol the city and protect its inhabitants in case of attack by the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;. At some point in &lt;a href=\"Lion%27s%20Rest\"&gt;Lion's Rest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; informed Alliance &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt; of the return of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; and the abduction of Anduin. These champions were subsequently sent to unite with the Ebon Blade and the Argent Crusade in order to combat the returning enemy. Following the death of &lt;a href=\"Herald%20Dalora\"&gt;Herald Dalora&lt;/a&gt;, they returned to Stormwind to inform them about the events that occurred in &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;dark powers&lt;/a&gt; that Sylvanas had allied with.\nIn order for allies from Azeroth to come in the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ebon%20Blade%20Acolyte\"&gt;acolytes&lt;/a&gt; of the Ebon Blade were ordered to establish portals to access Oribos from the &lt;a href=\"Wizard%27s%20Sanctum\"&gt;Wizard's Sanctum&lt;/a&gt; in Stormwind.\nAt the end of the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;war against the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, Anduin told &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; that he couldn't return to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; yet and that he trusted Turalyon to keep Strowmind and the Alliance safe in his absence.\nDragonflight.\nWith the return of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt; met with &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; and extended the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt;' invitation to the isles. Recalling how the Aspects made great sacrifices to save Azeroth during the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the Regent of Stormwind declared that the Alliance would answer the call and stand together with &lt;a href=\"dragons\"&gt;dragonkind&lt;/a&gt; once again. While the &lt;a href=\"Dragonscale%20Expedition\"&gt;expedition&lt;/a&gt; was preparing to depart, Turalyon discussed with &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; about the return of the &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;s. Although he had faith in &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;'s intentions, he expressed distrust of the other dragons, citing the 's report of the damage done to the kingdom by &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Onyxia&lt;/a&gt; years ago. In order to protect the Alliance and their past years' efforts to recreate its strength, he ordered the Spymaster to enlist the expertise of the Stormwind mages to create a foolproof method to see through the \"&lt;a href=\"Dragon%23Shapeshifting\"&gt;visage&lt;/a&gt;\" that the dragons wear among mortals.\nAt some point, a disgraced noble named &lt;a href=\"Count%20Clessington\"&gt;Count Clessington&lt;/a&gt; arranged for the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; to steal the &lt;a href=\"%3ADrakefire%20Amulet\"&gt;:Drakefire Amulet&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt;. Using the artifact's powers of manipulation, and the help of a cruel bandit named &lt;a href=\"Duncon%20Ratsbon\"&gt;Duncon Ratsbon&lt;/a&gt;, he convinced the Defias to turn against &lt;a href=\"Vanessa%20VanCleef\"&gt;Vanessa VanCleef&lt;/a&gt; and march on &lt;a href=\"Northshire%20Abbey\"&gt;Northshire Abbey&lt;/a&gt;, with the aim of using it as a staging ground to pillage the city of Stormwind itself. With the help of a &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;champion of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, the Defias were defeated, Count Clessington was slain, and the Drakefire Amulet was destroyed. In order to reward them for defeating the rebellion, &lt;a href=\"General%20Hammond%20Clay\"&gt;General Hammond Clay&lt;/a&gt; promoted the Stormwind champion into a &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Royal%20Guard\"&gt;Lionguard&lt;/a&gt; and bestowed them with a new armor during a ceremony in the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Heroes\"&gt;Valley of Heroes&lt;/a&gt;.\nInhabitants.\nSince the fall of &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; rules as king from his throne in Stormwind Keep. However, after Anduin's abduction by the &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; was appointed as regent and protector of the realm with the support of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Nobles\"&gt;House of Nobles&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Highlord Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; once served as the former regent of Stormwind, until he was sent to command the main Alliance forces in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, where his destiny would lead him into becoming the new &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Admiral%20Jes-Tereth\"&gt;Grand Admiral Jes-Tereth&lt;/a&gt; is the officer in charge of the kingdom's fleet, while in the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Heroes\"&gt;Valley of Heroes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"General%20Hammond%20Clay\"&gt;General Hammond Clay&lt;/a&gt; stands as the commander of the defense of the capital. In the shadows, &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Master Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; served the crown as the leader of the kingdom's intelligence service, the . In the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Archbishop%20Benedictus\"&gt;Archbishop Benedictus&lt;/a&gt; used to preside over the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Holy%20Light\"&gt;Church of the Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;, but with the revelation of his betrayal that position is currently vacant.\nDistricts.\nThe city is made up of roughly rectangular districts separated by canals.\nValley of Heroes.\nStormwind is the largest of the surviving human kingdoms remaining on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Connected through both sea access and the newly-built underground railroad, Stormwind proudly swings its doors wide open for adventurers of the entire &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. Among the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s, many &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; and other races live in the capital city, making Stormwind the center of many cultures.\nStormwind City's great gates tower over the treetops of Elwynn Forest. Beyond them lies The Valley of Heroes, a beautiful natural basin spanned by a majestic bridge leading to the city's trade district. The bridge is lined with enormous statues depicting some of the greatest heroes of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 the brave men, high elves, and dwarves who stepped into the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; to bring an end to the war in the scarred land of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; itself. As &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; swept over the city during the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, he caused great damage to the Valley of Heroes, leaving massive, scorching clawmarks on the nearby towers and toppling the statue of &lt;a href=\"Danath%20Trollbane\"&gt;Danath Trollbane&lt;/a&gt; into the water below the bridge. The city's workers eventually finished repairing all of the damages to the valley during the events of the invasion on &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;.\nTrade District.\n\"It bustles with trade from across the continent and beyond.\"\nThe Trade District lies in the center of Stormwind City and is always bustling with activity. It is the place in the city where people can get most goods. Half of the city's banks, auction houses, and inns, as well as the local &lt;a href=\"gryphon\"&gt;gryphon&lt;/a&gt; master, are all located within. In addition, consumers find plenty of outlets for their coin in the various equipment shops nearby. For those with a taste for the delectable, the &lt;a href=\"Trias\"&gt;Trias&lt;/a&gt; and Gallina families run cheese and wine shops out of the Trade District as well.\nOld Town.\nTo the east of the Trade District is the Old Town, the oldest section of the capital, and many parts of it still predate the reconstruction of the city after its razing by the orcs during the events of the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;. As the district had not been badly ravaged, it had never needed true rebuilding. Consequently, it is a rustic, downtrodden place, where the streets are described as far dirtier and smellier than the other districts. It is also the residential area for most of the poor folk of the city, as beggars, thieves, and the poor can be found there. Fortunately, the Stormwind &lt;a href=\"Command%20Center\"&gt;Command Center&lt;/a&gt; is located along the edges of the quarter, and near is the headquarters of the , the kingdom's intelligence agency.\nMage Quarter.\nTo the west of the Trade District is the Mage Quarter. The &lt;a href=\"Wizard%27s%20Sanctum\"&gt;Wizard's Sanctum&lt;/a&gt; stands proudly in the center of the district, it is here that &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s train to increase their powers, while shady &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s are often drawn to the dark cellars of the &lt;a href=\"Slaughtered%20Lamb\"&gt;Slaughtered Lamb&lt;/a&gt;, where they practice their &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20%28magic%29\"&gt;dark&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Fel\"&gt;arts&lt;/a&gt; in the shadows of polite society. The rest of the district is filled with tailoring shops, warehouses storing magical artifacts and reagents, and bustling coffeehouses and bars. During the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, Stormwind utilized the services of the mysterious &lt;a href=\"conjurer\"&gt;conjurer&lt;/a&gt;s, but they no longer have any presence in the city.\nCathedral Square.\nTo the north of the Trade District is Cathedral Square, the religious center for all followers of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;. Though Stormwind Keep is the biggest structure in Stormwind City, many believe the most awe-inspiring is the Cathedral of Light. Within the cathedral are the most faithful and true &lt;a href=\"paladins\"&gt;paladins&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"priests\"&gt;priests&lt;/a&gt; of the human race. The bishops and paladins at the cathedral are on a lifelong quest to bring the light to the darkest places on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, and all are welcome within the cathedral's walls as long as their journey is one of good and not evil. Other notable locations in the square include the city's orphanage, and the &lt;a href=\"City%20Hall\"&gt;City Hall&lt;/a&gt;, where Stormwind's architects and researchers keep a census on the citizens of the kingdom, as well as finding ways to improve the quality of life for those within the city.\nDwarven District.\nTo the east of Cathedral Square is the Dwarven District, where the dwarves and gnomes of &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; carve a slice of Stormwind life out for themselves. The air is thick with smoke and sparks, and the ground trembles with the pounding of anvils, but to many it feels just like a home should. A trove of weapon and armor shops line the streets, and &lt;a href=\"blacksmiths\"&gt;blacksmiths&lt;/a&gt; create masterpieces out of common metals in the many open-air plazas. Many adventurers pass through the Dwarven District on their way to the Deeprun Tram, a marvel of &lt;a href=\"gnomish\"&gt;gnomish&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"engineering\"&gt;engineering&lt;/a&gt; and fast transport to the city of Ironforge. The massive spinning cog that frames the entrance to the tram tunnel cannot be missed. An opening by the northern end leads to the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City%20Outskirts\"&gt;Stormwind City Outskirts&lt;/a&gt;, a small rural area outside the walls of the city.\nCanals and the prisons.\nEach district is bordered by shimmering blue canals and linked by bridges spanning over them. Anglers fish from the many docks in the city, the freshwater fish within perfect quarry for the beginning fisherman. There are two fortifications that rise from the waters in Stormwind - both are prisons for the lawless and evil. &lt;a href=\"The%20Stockade\"&gt;The Stockade&lt;/a&gt; is accessible from the Mage Quarter and holds murderers, gnolls, thieves, and other enemies of the kingdom. A similar prison, the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20%28Stormwind%20City%29\"&gt;Vault&lt;/a&gt;, is surrounded by water on all sides and seems to be holding out fine - for now.\nStormwind Keep.\nFinally, the crown of Stormwind City remains Stormwind Keep. Rising high between the Dwarven District and Old Town, the keep is the seat of power of the kingdom and serves as the residence of the Stormwindian kings, currently King &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Azeroth\"&gt;royal court&lt;/a&gt; as well as some of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Nobles\"&gt;nobles&lt;/a&gt; of the kingdom are also here. The Keep offers a view of the whole city, so that the king can watch over the masses, and provide a powerful reminder of what deserves to be defended. Within the keep itself are many librarians, nobles, and representatives of the human peoples as well as the &lt;a href=\"battlemaster\"&gt;battlemaster&lt;/a&gt;s.\nStormwind Harbor.\nThe harbor is located in the most northern area bordering the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt;, with the access point set between the Park and Cathedral Square. Stormwind City towers over the harbor, with cannons stationed all along the walls. A major transportation hub, the docks are teeming with all sorts of activity. &lt;a href=\"Siege%20engine\"&gt;Siege engine&lt;/a&gt;s are also dotted throughout the area, and at the northern tip one can find a large &lt;a href=\"shipyard\"&gt;shipyard&lt;/a&gt;. If you are friendly enough, &lt;a href=\"Thargold%20Ironwing\"&gt;Thargold Ironwing&lt;/a&gt; will grant you a free aerial tour through the entire region.\nStormwind City Outskirts.\nThis area has been built as a replacement for the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Park\"&gt;Stormwind Park&lt;/a&gt;, swallowed by &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;'s assault on the city. It houses a large lake with several farmhouses, as well as an &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt;'s earthshrine, which served for &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to teleport on the fronts of the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20Deathwing\"&gt;war against Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Tushui%20Pandaren\"&gt;Tushui Pandaren&lt;/a&gt; have set up a pavilion near the earthshrine, where adventurers can travel to &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, purchase &lt;a href=\"dragon%20turtle\"&gt;dragon turtle&lt;/a&gt; mounts and contains the city's &lt;a href=\"monk\"&gt;monk&lt;/a&gt; class trainer. It shares the same beauty as the rest of &lt;a href=\"Elwynn%20Forest\"&gt;Elwynn Forest&lt;/a&gt;. Following the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, a new embassy for the &lt;a href=\"Allied%20race\"&gt;new allies&lt;/a&gt; was built in the outskirts. After the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20of%20Teldrassil\"&gt;Burning of Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;, the displaced night elves and humans of Gilneas largely took refuge in this area, with their racial vendors being located here.\nLion's Rest.\nThe hard-working citizens of Stormwind have been hard at work rebuilding &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Park\"&gt;Stormwind Park&lt;/a&gt; where they managed to rebuild a large mass of earth that was ripped out of the land from Deathwing's attack to rebuild the park upon. Following the death of King &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, his &lt;a href=\"Lion%27s%20Rest\"&gt;tomb&lt;/a&gt; is displayed in a portion of the new park as well as a memorial listing the names of fallen Alliance soldiers.\nThe Overlook.\nThis area has been claimed by the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; as a rear base for an expedition sent through a portal to the &lt;a href=\"Everbloom\"&gt;Everbloom&lt;/a&gt;. Some of the plantlife from &lt;a href=\"Gorgrond\"&gt;Gorgrond&lt;/a&gt; managed to seep through and started to grow around the portal. The area currently serves no purpose in the uninstanced version of Stormwind, but the fight against a genesaur named &lt;a href=\"Yalnu\"&gt;Yalnu&lt;/a&gt; took place there in the &lt;a href=\"Everbloom\"&gt;Everbloom&lt;/a&gt; instance.\nPhased areas.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, the Harbor and then the Keep is phased.\nFrom the quest &lt;a href=\"The%20Old%20Barracks%20%28quest%29\"&gt;The Old Barracks (quest)&lt;/a&gt;, the Old Barracks part of the city will become phased to have level 84 Cultists and in place of wandering Stormwind Guards, and critters.\nFrom the quest &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20in%20the%20Catacombs\"&gt;Cataclysm in the Catacombs&lt;/a&gt;, the Cathedral of Light is phased, with Warped and Babbling Cultists and the target of the quest, &lt;a href=\"The%20Black%20Bishop\"&gt;The Black Bishop&lt;/a&gt;, in place of the many NPCs and trainers.\nIn the RPG.\nName.\nThe city is named for the occasional sudden squalls created by a ley line pattern in the mountains around the city.\nStormwind region.\nStormwind is the name of a region (land or area.) It is a small, coastal zone west of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Steppes\"&gt;Burning Steppes&lt;/a&gt;, south of &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Morogh\"&gt;Dun Morogh&lt;/a&gt; and northwest of &lt;a href=\"Elwynn%20Forest\"&gt;Elwynn Forest&lt;/a&gt;, on the western coast of the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;. This region is the location of Stormwind City, as established in \"&lt;a href=\"Lands%20of%20Conflict\"&gt;Lands of Conflict&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20The%20Roleplaying%20Game\"&gt;Warcraft The Roleplaying Game&lt;/a&gt;\", and includes an area north of the city. Today, with the collapse of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt;, Stormwind is the brightest bastion of humanity on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe mountains around the glorious Stormwind Keep have an impressive ley line pattern that is responsible for the occasional sudden squalls that give Stormwind City its name. Wild beasts including harpies and dire wolves inhabit this area.\nThe Stormwind region itself does not go much beyond the boundaries of Stormwind City; it begins at the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Heroes\"&gt;Valley of Heroes&lt;/a&gt; and extends into the mountains to the north. The city stands firm on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28continent%29\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s northwest coast and is the capital of both the Stormwind region and &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, and contain one of the few remaining great human cities. Primarily a human settlement, a fair number of &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20dwarf\"&gt;Ironforge dwarves&lt;/a&gt;, and even a few &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;s dwell here as well.\nA reasonably &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Harbor\"&gt;large shipyard&lt;/a&gt; lies on the northwestern part of the city and provides the Alliance with naval craft. The lush valley of heroes lies south of the city and all visitors must pass through it, as it is the only entrance to Stormwind on foot. With all the rebuilding efforts in the past thirty years, the city has several notable structures. These include: the &lt;a href=\"Academy%20of%20Arcane%20Sciences\"&gt;Academy of Arcane Sciences&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pig%20and%20Whistle\"&gt;Pig and Whistle&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Stockade\"&gt;Stockade&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20%28Stormwind%20City%29\"&gt;Vault&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt;. The mighty walls surrounding Stormwind are somewhat invulnerable to small scale attacks. Crossbowmen can be stationed upon the ramparts, heavy &lt;a href=\"ballista\"&gt;ballista&lt;/a&gt;e keep watch for enemy artillery, and of course, waves of guards are willing to sacrifice their lives to defend the city.\nA grand city with new construction that still gives a nod to human and dwarven architecture of old, one can move about Stormwind on foot, rent one of many mounts or even have a small boat take them through the several canals that bisect the city. The mountains north hold some nastier sorts of beasts that will sometimes venture south to see what they can pick from the road. The passage is no stranger to &lt;a href=\"harpy\"&gt;harpy&lt;/a&gt; attacks, and even dire wolves are spotted north of the city. The locals assume the creatures have escaped from the Blackrock orcs in the Burning Steppes.\nPeople and culture.\nStormwind is the jewel of the Alliance in Azeroth. The oldest and grandest human city, it has weathered three wars, ransacking by the orcs, and invasions by the Alliance to take it back. Although mostly a human city, Stormwind does house &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"high%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;, and other Alliance races. It opens its gates to all Alliance members to participate in trade within the city limits. Most of the city's coffers are filled with the taxes taken from merchants in the busy market. Every night at sunset the Cathedral of Light rings a solitary bell whose sweet pitch reaches the entire city. This is for the night elves, who are unaccustomed to living within cities. A day of mourning is set aside for the high elves, remembering Dalaran's destruction. The ale pours free for every dwarf in the city during the holy birthday of Anvil Stormglaive. It also holds celebrations for the Third War veterans, to honor the citizens of all Alliance races who fought in the war.\nStormwind's climate is warm, the skies clear, and the seasons generally temperate. Thus, clothes in the city are composed of light fabric for the most part. Color choices usually are bold: whites, reds, blues, oranges, and yellows. Although one might assume the climate would call for as little clothing as possible, the inhabitants of Stormwind prefer light fabric, but lots of it. Humans usually wear long-sleeved tunics, billowy trousers, leather boots, and sometimes even ridiculously large, floppy hats for excessively sunny days.\nThe high elves generally copy the humans' fashions here, though there are some high elves who prefer to set themselves apart. Although Stormwind is well-defended, the city guard usually wears only light armor to handle the occasional thief or bandit. The paladins will don their full plate during ceremonies and when they ride out of the city on business defending Elwynn Forest or the surrounding areas, but around the city they wear nothing more than the breastplate that identifies them as paladins. A third force in the city is dedicated to maintaining the peace. In addition, a guild of assassins works behind the scenes with the blessings of the king and the Stormwind ruling council. When solving an \"inconvenient\" problem would go against the tenets of the Holy Light, the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Assassins\"&gt;Stormwind Assassins&lt;/a&gt; are called. They deal with matters quickly and efficiently, and few questions are asked.\nThe city's nobility strives for power while manipulating others and shrouding their sins in secrecy. A few exceptional nobles, however, do try to tend to the city the best they can. The priests, meanwhile, uphold the tenets of the Holy Light, although some have become more political than religious. The guard is generally uncorrupted and has a close relationship to the carefree citizens of Stormwind.\nOpposition to the Horde, Scourge, Burning Legion, and Shadow are near requirements to live in the city. Anyone who speaks out in support of these groups, or even suggests it, is likely to be hanged or driven out, for these beliefs are enforced like law by the will of the common man.\nMost citizens of the city are practitioners of the Holy Light, and nearly all at least respect it. The religion is tied closely to the government, for the church has enough political influence to directly impact the actions the King decides to take.\nThose criminals who survive arrest and trial reside in one of the city's two prisons. Common criminals from pickpockets to murderers stay in the Stockade. More dangerous types \u2014 demons, rogue mages, and the like \u2014 are left to rot in the Vault, which is surrounded on all sides by water.\nGallery.\nThese banners mark the entrances to the various districts of the city.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

A popular fan theory is that this tomb holds the corpse of &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;, which would explain why it contains the symbol of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. When this was asked at Blizzcon 2011, &lt;a href=\"Chris%20Metzen\"&gt;Chris Metzen&lt;/a&gt; said he's not sure if that's true or not, but it is an interesting idea.\nIt is possible it may have been intended for Varian himself when he dies, given its proximity to the grave of his wife. However, if so it'd be off for him to be buried in a grave with a Lordaeron symbol instead of a Stormwind symbol. Whether that was the plan or not, Varian was ultimately given &lt;a href=\"Lion%27s%20Rest\"&gt;Lion's Rest&lt;/a&gt; as his memorial instead.\nAlternatively, it could also be the tomb, where &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt; is buried. A Lordaeron symbol could be a symbolic representation of how Lothar was a Supreme Commander of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;."}

On the orders of &lt;a href=\"King%20Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, the guards interrupted the flow of traffic into Stormwind City and began searching for cultists hiding among the citizens. All of the cultists they captured were then taken to the Stormwind Stockade for questioning.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the guards managed to capture a &lt;a href=\"Prisoner%20%28Stormwind%20City%29\"&gt;Defias member&lt;/a&gt; and took him to the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Stockade\"&gt;Stormwind Stockade&lt;/a&gt;.

However, &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Prince Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; later discovered that Major Samuelson has been secretly working for the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;. When he was discovered, he tried to kill the king, but was overcome and slain by the hero and the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Royal%20Guard\"&gt;Royal Guards&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for the Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Gryphon%20Rider\"&gt;Stormwind Gryphon Rider&lt;/a&gt;s accompanied the &lt;a href=\"third%20fleet\"&gt;third fleet&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, but most didn't &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Gryphon\"&gt;survive&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt some point during the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Veiled%20Hand\"&gt;Veiled Hand&lt;/a&gt; infiltrated Stormwind City. Consequently, the City Guard was on high alert, and &lt;a href=\"General%20Hammond%20Clay\"&gt;General Hammond Clay&lt;/a&gt; organized them to protect the citizens, while working with the leader &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; (actually &lt;a href=\"Detheroc\"&gt;Detheroc&lt;/a&gt; in disguise) to lock down the capital. In &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Melris%20Malagan\"&gt;Captain Melris Malagan&lt;/a&gt; and a few other guards had betrayed the kingdom to join the cause of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. However, they were killed by &lt;a href=\"Garona%20Halforcen\"&gt;Garona Halforcen&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Shadow&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Uncrowned\"&gt;Uncrowned&lt;/a&gt; before they could summon &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s.\nWhen the Uncrowned agents infiltrated the to discover clues regarding the &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt; Detheroc, they encountered and fought a few Stormwind City guards.\nBefore the Storm.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; announced the &lt;a href=\"Gathering\"&gt;Gathering&lt;/a&gt; to his people, he was informed by the guards and the that there was muttering in some of the taverns and on the streets. Consequently, the City Guard had been instructed to interrupt such conversations if they verged on sedition or grew violent. They later reported that the hatred expressed was not toward the king, but for &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, and what they &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;had done to&lt;/a&gt; their loved ones.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Thorns\"&gt;War of the Thorns&lt;/a&gt;, a unit of Stormwind guards was sent to assist with the evacuations in &lt;a href=\"Howling%20Oak\"&gt;Howling Oak&lt;/a&gt;, and wherever else in &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; they could. When &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt; was burned by the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, they picked up the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; children and ran out of the &lt;a href=\"Wizard%27s%20Sanctum\"&gt;Wizard's Sanctum&lt;/a&gt; with their parents, in order to make more places for the refugees. In the capital, the rest of the guards took care of helping the refugees, bringing food and first aid supplies.\nAt some point during &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, when the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; infiltered Stormwind City to extract &lt;a href=\"Princess%20Talanji\"&gt;Princess Talanji&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Prophet%20Zul\"&gt;Prophet Zul&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Stockade\"&gt;Stormwind Stockade&lt;/a&gt;, the City Guard was on high alert alongside the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Guard\"&gt;Stormwind Guard&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Army\"&gt;Stormwind Army&lt;/a&gt;. Most of the guards could be seen on patrol, searching for the intruders.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20at%20the%20Gates%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Battle at the Gates of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, some guards in Stormwind City were against the armistice, wishing to make the Horde pay for their crimes, while others saw no point in continuing the war after &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; fled.\nDragonflight.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt; brought the &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Warders\"&gt;Obsidian Warders&lt;/a&gt; to Stormwind City after the discovery of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;, the City Guard alerted &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Spymaster Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; and protected the gates, until they were ordered to let them pass by the director of the . Nonetheless, some guards mentioned they didn't trust the &lt;a href=\"dracthyr\"&gt;dracthyr&lt;/a&gt; due to the crimes committed by &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Onyxia&lt;/a&gt; years ago, and that they were therefore not welcome.\nOrganization.\nThe Stormwind City Guard operates according to a military hierarchy, with lieutenants, officers and captains. Following the reconstruction of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"General%20Marcus%20Jonathan\"&gt;General Marcus Jonathan&lt;/a&gt; took the leadership of the guards in the city as the High Commander of Stormwind Defense. After he was killed during the &lt;a href=\"Attack%20on%20Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Attack on Theramore Isle&lt;/a&gt;, he was succeeded by &lt;a href=\"General%20Hammond%20Clay\"&gt;General Hammond Clay&lt;/a&gt;.\nAll guards wear the same gear and tabard as the soldiers of the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Army\"&gt;Stormwind Army&lt;/a&gt;. In terms of equipment, they can be seen employing swords, shields, crossbows, catch nets, and oil lamps at night. To ensure the protection of the city from the skies, some guards are &lt;a href=\"Gryphon%20rider\"&gt;riding&lt;/a&gt; white &lt;a href=\"gryphon\"&gt;gryphon&lt;/a&gt;s and work in squads.\nNot all guards are necessarily from Stormwind, at least &lt;a href=\"Battle%20at%20the%20Gates%20of%20Orgrimmar%23Stormwind%20guards%20in%20the%20Trade%20District\"&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; of them lived in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; before the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is possible for a guard to be reassigned outside the capital by their superiors, notably in a village or city affiliated with the kingdom. If their mission is well accomplished, a guard may receive a promotion, or, be reassigned by their captain when they review the personnel assignments.\nThieves and criminals arrested by the Stormwind guards are taken to the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Stockade\"&gt;Stormwind Stockade&lt;/a&gt;. After they have been sentenced, the guards can apply the death penalty to prisoners, like in the case of &lt;a href=\"Pathonia%20Shaw\"&gt;Pathonia Shaw&lt;/a&gt; who narrowly escaped being hanged after being captured a third time for theft.\nIn the RPG.\nThe Stormwind City Guard (or just the City Guard) patrols the streets and walls of the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;capital&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; keeping the public safe. This smaller unit would patrol the street during times of peace. During times of war, several of these units combine under a subcommander, who in turn operates under the auspices of a commander-in-chief. If a fighting force were to penetrate the walls of Stormwind, these smaller units would engage intruders, buying time for the army to respond. As a note, the Stormwind army can also muster together quickly and provide aerial and magical support for the city's militia during an invasion.\nSergeant &lt;a href=\"Mandred%20Grummel\"&gt;Mandred Grummel&lt;/a&gt; is a commander within the guard and &lt;a href=\"Cristof%20Dungalion\"&gt;Cristof Dungalion&lt;/a&gt; is a guard."}

Acquiring these will require two or three stacks of .\nBuff.\nCreating this item grants the character a +30 &lt;a href=\"Intellect\"&gt;Intellect&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Gift%20of%20Friendship\"&gt;Stormwind Gift of Friendship&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"buff\"&gt;buff&lt;/a&gt; for 60 minutes. The buff persists if the Gift Collection item is consumed as an ingredient. The Gift Collection buffs do not &lt;a href=\"stack\"&gt;stack&lt;/a&gt;, and any new buff from creating a city Gift Collection will overwrite an existing one.\nIngredient.\nA Stormwind Gift Collection is one of three &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; city Gift Collections which are ingredients of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Gift%20Collection\"&gt;Alliance Gift Collection&lt;/a&gt;.\nNotes.\nThis is a &lt;a href=\"conjured\"&gt;conjured&lt;/a&gt; item.

Unfortunately, that means you cannot pass these directly to an &lt;a href=\"alt\"&gt;alt&lt;/a&gt; on the same account.\nThis item is primarily useful during Love is in the Air and the seven day duration of the item is longer than the event, so is not a handicap. It does prevent you from saving these for the following year. \nThe item can be created from the ingredient items after the event is over. By combining each hierarchical layer of gifts and pledges near its expiration, it should be possible to extend the overall duration to around 21 days for the city gift collections; so anywhere within that timeframe, a city gift could be created. It is unknown whether or not the buff will proc based on the item creation or if a separate check requires the event to be in progress, but the response time for the buff to proc during the event suggests that no separate check is used. \nSee also.\nThere is a plethora of individual items that are combined in this seasonal event to form successively larger collections.

The kingdom being split into &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29%23Azeroth\"&gt;several smaller territories&lt;/a&gt;, some villages such as &lt;a href=\"Goldshire\"&gt;Goldshire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lakeshire\"&gt;Lakeshire&lt;/a&gt;, and other territories like &lt;a href=\"Northshire%20Valley\"&gt;Northshire Valley&lt;/a&gt;, are governed by appointed &lt;a href=\"Marshal%20%28rank%29\"&gt;Marshal&lt;/a&gt;s in charge of the garrisons. Their guards can be seen patrolling or guarding the regions' &lt;a href=\"scout%20tower\"&gt;scout tower&lt;/a&gt;s, assisting and protecting the citizens when needed.\nHistory.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Elwynn%20Forest\"&gt;Elwynn Forest&lt;/a&gt; was heavily patrolled by the Stormwind Guard and remained a peaceful land. Their towers stood vigilant every few miles, helping to keep the forest safe from the rampaging forces of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nBefore he retired from active duty, &lt;a href=\"Marshal%20Haggard\"&gt;Marshal Haggard&lt;/a&gt; used to lead the Stormwind Guard. At the time, they would get drinks at the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Raven%20Tavern\"&gt;Scarlet Raven Tavern&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Darkshire\"&gt;Darkshire&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nBecause of &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Lady Katrana Prestor&lt;/a&gt;'s political machinations in the kingdom, the Stormwind Guard pulled stake and abandoned &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt; when the cost of upkeep became too great. Due to the lack of military protection in Westfall, the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Edwin%20VanCleef\"&gt;Edwin VanCleef&lt;/a&gt; made the region their new refuge and sowed anarchy and terror, easily taking control of the poorly defended farmlands. At the same time, the kingdom pulled all their troops out of &lt;a href=\"Duskwood\"&gt;Duskwood&lt;/a&gt;. Left to fend for themselves, the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Watch\"&gt;Night Watch&lt;/a&gt; was established to defend against the various threats that plagued Darkshire.\nAfter years of corruption and political instability, the &lt;a href=\"Westbrook%20Garrison\"&gt;Westbrook Garrison&lt;/a&gt; lived through difficult times when they had to deal with an increasing &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt; and thief activity coming from &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt;. With the bulk of the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Army\"&gt;Stormwind Army&lt;/a&gt; abroad, they barely had enough men to keep the roads of the region safe. At some point, &lt;a href=\"Deputy%20Rainer\"&gt;Deputy Rainer&lt;/a&gt; requested more Stormwind soldiers from &lt;a href=\"Marshal%20Dughan\"&gt;Marshal Dughan&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Goldshire\"&gt;Goldshire&lt;/a&gt;, who rather sent &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s as reinforcements. With their help, the Garrison fought the &lt;a href=\"Riverpaw%20pack\"&gt;Riverpaw pack&lt;/a&gt;, who infested the woods south of the guard tower, as they couldn't handle them alone.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Northshire%20Valley\"&gt;Northshire Valley&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Marshal%20McBride\"&gt;Marshal McBride&lt;/a&gt; was concerned about the &lt;a href=\"kobold\"&gt;kobold&lt;/a&gt;s that have infested the woods and &lt;a href=\"Echo%20Ridge%20Mine\"&gt;Echo Ridge Mine&lt;/a&gt;. He consequently marshaled &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s, and other &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;recruits&lt;/a&gt; to get rid of the vermin.\nUnlike Duskwood, the Stormwind Army did not pull out of the &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. Despite this, the Stormwind Guard's presence in Redridge remained tenuous, and the situation became so dire that the army was eventually forced from the position of &lt;a href=\"Stonewatch%20Keep\"&gt;Stonewatch Keep&lt;/a&gt;. The guards in Lakeshire were expecting the 2nd Battalion from Stormwind.\nDue to the lack of resources, &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s have been hired to help the Stormwind Guard protect &lt;a href=\"Lakeshire\"&gt;Lakeshire&lt;/a&gt;, notably to fight the &lt;a href=\"Shadowhide%20clan\"&gt;Shadowhide clan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20pack\"&gt;Redridge pack&lt;/a&gt; gnolls, but also the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s who traveled from the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Steppes\"&gt;Burning Steppes&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Marshal%20Marris\"&gt;Marshal Marris&lt;/a&gt; enlisted the heroes to kill one of their leaders, &lt;a href=\"Tharil%27zun\"&gt;Tharil'zun&lt;/a&gt;, responsible for some of the attacks on Lakeshire.\nAt the time, the blacksmith &lt;a href=\"Verner%20Osgood\"&gt;Verner Osgood&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Lakeshire\"&gt;Lakeshire&lt;/a&gt; used much of his iron to keep the Stormwind Guards outfitted, to the point that he no longer had enough to supply the stable's horses with shoes.\nCataclysm.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Marshal%20McBride\"&gt;Marshal McBride&lt;/a&gt; and his guards had to deal with a full-fledged invasion by &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock clan&lt;/a&gt; orcs that have gained entry into the once secluded &lt;a href=\"Northshire%20Valley\"&gt;Northshire Valley&lt;/a&gt; through a passage in the mountains opened by the Shattering.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, Stormwind increased the &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt;'s security by constructing the &lt;a href=\"Tower%20Watch\"&gt;Tower Watch&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Three%20Corners\"&gt;Three Corners&lt;/a&gt;, then stationed a garrison of &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Garrison%20Watchman\"&gt;Redridge watchmen&lt;/a&gt; there. On the order of &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; adventurers had to report at the scout tower, as &lt;a href=\"Watch%20Captain%20Parker\"&gt;Watch Captain Parker&lt;/a&gt;'s forces have come under attack from marauding &lt;a href=\"Gnoll\"&gt;gnolls&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s.\nDespite the reinforcements, the Stormwind Guard was raided by gnolls who stole their supplies during a night, and &lt;a href=\"Marshal%20Marris\"&gt;Marshal Marris&lt;/a&gt; had to send the adventurers to recover them in the &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Canyons\"&gt;Redridge Canyons&lt;/a&gt;. He also enlisted them to slaughter the orcs in &lt;a href=\"Alther%27s%20Mill\"&gt;Alther's Mill&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Render%27s%20Camp\"&gt;Render's Camp&lt;/a&gt;, promising to reward them handsomely. In &lt;a href=\"Lakeshire\"&gt;Lakeshire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bailiff%20Conacher\"&gt;Bailiff Conacher&lt;/a&gt; posted a bounty on the &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Everstill\"&gt;Lake Everstill&lt;/a&gt;, asking &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to kill as many as they can to be rewarded.\nLegion.\nAt the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, numerous &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Invasions\"&gt;demonic invasions&lt;/a&gt; were launched across &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. The region of &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt; subsequently became a primary target of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Army\"&gt;Stormwind Army&lt;/a&gt; was quickly sent to repel the assault. Under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Gryan%20Stoutmantle\"&gt;Marshal Gryan Stoutmantle&lt;/a&gt;, a contingent of troops with Stormwind Guards was deployed. Some of them could be encountered &lt;a href=\"Injured%20Stormwind%20Guard\"&gt;injured&lt;/a&gt;, being healed by &lt;a href=\"Devoted%20Battle-Priest\"&gt;priests&lt;/a&gt;, patrolling the region, or even being &lt;a href=\"Mind%20control\"&gt;mind controlled&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt;. With the help of the &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s, the army ultimately prevailed.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt; was invaded, a few Stormwind guards were sent as reinforcements to help the &lt;a href=\"Stormpike%20clan\"&gt;Stormpike clan&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Gavin%27s%20Naze\"&gt;Gavin's Naze&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, when the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; infiltered Stormwind City to extract &lt;a href=\"Princess%20Talanji\"&gt;Princess Talanji&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Prophet%20Zul\"&gt;Prophet Zul&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Stockade\"&gt;Stormwind Stockade&lt;/a&gt;, the Stormwind Guard was on high alert alongside the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City%20Guard\"&gt;Stormwind City Guard&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Army\"&gt;Stormwind Army&lt;/a&gt;. On the orders of &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, they lock down the capital and confined the population to their homes, refusing to let anyone outside until the threat has been subdued. Some could be seen on patrol, searching for the intruders.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Vision%20of%20Stormwind\"&gt;Vision of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, the bodies of several Stormwind guards could be found in the &lt;a href=\"Trade%20District\"&gt;Trade District&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20Square\"&gt;Cathedral Square&lt;/a&gt;.\nTerror by Torchlight.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, as a &lt;a href=\"Necromancer%20%28Terror%20by%20Torchlight%29\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt; attempted to overwhelm Duskwood with an army of undead, &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; sent extra guards from Stormwind as reinforcements after the necromancer hinted that the threat was not over.\nShadowlands.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"Death%20Rising\"&gt;Death Rising&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; began attacking the &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, and the Garrison Watchmen of &lt;a href=\"Three%20Corners\"&gt;Three Corners&lt;/a&gt; had to fortify their outpost under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Guard%20Captain%20Josephine\"&gt;Guard Captain Josephine&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen Lakeshire was attacked by the Scourge, the Stormiwnd guards could be seen guarding the bridge, and some were later killed by the undead.\nDragonflight.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Breadbasket%20Guild\"&gt;Breadbasket Guild&lt;/a&gt; was established at the &lt;a href=\"Saldean%27s%20Farm\"&gt;Saldean's Farm&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt;, two &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Guard%20%28Westfall%29\"&gt;Stormwind guards&lt;/a&gt; were sent to monitor and protect the &lt;a href=\"farmer\"&gt;farmer&lt;/a&gt;s in the area.\nIn the RPG.\nThe Stormwind Guard tends to use the &lt;a href=\"Westbrook%20Garrison\"&gt;Westbrook Garrison&lt;/a&gt; as a testing ground for newly initiated &lt;a href=\"knight\"&gt;knight&lt;/a&gt;s. Due to the inability of the Stormwind Guard to protect their villages from the attacks, the people of &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt; are growing increasingly upset."}

These are combined into packages which are in turn hierarchically combined with other pledge packages for &lt;a href=\"buff\"&gt;buff&lt;/a&gt;s and rewards. \nAll of the Love is in the Air pledge gifts are non-functional as regards their name and picture. You cannot read a Stormwind Guard's Card.\nSource.\nStormwind Guard's Card is one of two pledge items (the other is ) that can be found inside a or a , given by Stormwind Guards as part of the Love is in the Air event. There is always one and only one of these two pledge items in each of these containers. (The Pledge of Friendship contains only the pledge item; the Pledge of Adoration contains functional gifts as well.) The odds of getting either pledge item appear to be about even, but in the short run you are likely to get a stack of one while trying for the other. \nYou will need one free inventory slot or a current stack of less than 20 Stormwind Guard's Cards in order to remove a Stormwind Guard's Card from its container. To remove the Stormwind Guard's Card from its container, right click the Pledge of Adoration or Pledge of Friendship to open it. \nIngredient.\nIf you have five or more Stormwind Guard's Cards in your inventory, right clicking on any of them will consume five and create a &lt;a href=\"Bundle%20of%20Cards\"&gt;Bundle of Cards&lt;/a&gt;.\nNotes.\nInventory space.\nThe Pledge of Adoration: Stormwind and Pledge of Friendship: Stormwind container items do not stack. Opening your Pledges of Friendship: Stormwind should save inventory space, since both pledge items stack 20 high. It is generally useful to NOT &lt;a href=\"autoloot\"&gt;autoloot&lt;/a&gt; a Pledge of Adoration container - the Love is in the Air event items quickly consume any available inventory space. If you have autoloot turned on, you can hold down the shift key while right clicking the Pledge of Adoration to not autoloot it. You can then remove only the items that you need at the moment. \nBe careful when combining these into packages, the Stormwind Guard's Card pledge item stacks 20 high, but the Bundle of Cards package item does not stack at all.\nStormwind Guards.\nAll of the s are &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s. For the Love is in the Air gift items given by non-guard NPCs, the race of the NPC, not the location, determines which city's gift item you get. Since all of a city's guard NPCs are the same race, the distinction does not come into play for the pledge items. \nTransferability.\nThis is a &lt;a href=\"conjured\"&gt;conjured&lt;/a&gt; item. It cannot be sold at the &lt;a href=\"Auction%20House\"&gt;Auction House&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mail\"&gt;mail&lt;/a&gt;ed nor put in a &lt;a href=\"guild%20bank\"&gt;guild bank&lt;/a&gt; tab, but it can be given, sold, or traded with other &lt;a href=\"player%20character\"&gt;player character&lt;/a&gt;s using the &lt;a href=\"trade\"&gt;trade&lt;/a&gt; window. Unfortunately, that means you cannot pass these directly to an &lt;a href=\"alt\"&gt;alt&lt;/a&gt; on the same account.\nDuration.\nThis item is &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Gift%20Collection%23Notes\"&gt;primarily&lt;/a&gt; useful during Love is in the Air and the seven day duration of the item is longer than the event, so is not a handicap. It does prevent you from saving these for the following year.\nSee also.\nThere is a plethora of individual items that are combined in this seasonal event to form successively larger collections. For details, see the main &lt;a href=\"Love%20is%20in%20the%20Air\"&gt;Love is in the Air&lt;/a&gt; article."}

{"id": "176223", "revid": "39299307", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=176223", "title": "Stormwind Harbor", "text": "Stormwind Harbor is a large &lt;a href=\"Harbor\"&gt;port&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"shipyard\"&gt;shipyard&lt;/a&gt;, consisting of a series of wharfs, dry docks, and fortifications located in the northwestern area of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;, with the access point set between the &lt;a href=\"Park\"&gt;Park&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20Square\"&gt;Cathedral Square&lt;/a&gt; districts. The harbor serves as a major strategic base for both the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Stormwind\"&gt;Kingdom of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20navy\"&gt;Alliance navy&lt;/a&gt;. Here, many &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; warships are constructed and fleets assembled; it is likely the largest and most important Alliance naval base in the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt; and potentially beyond. From a civilian perspective, transport ships regularly sail from the harbor to numerous other destinations across &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href=\"Rut%27theran%20Village\"&gt;Rut'theran Village&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Valiance%20Keep\"&gt;Valiance Keep&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe harbor has been expanded in recent years and is much safer to enter than in the past. It is heavily fortified to protect against attack, presumably by the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, whose &lt;a href=\"Horde%20navy\"&gt;navy&lt;/a&gt; is also known to operate off the western coast of the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;. To this end, there are numerous tiered plateaus leading from the harbor up to the city proper, upon which are stationed articles of heavy artillery in the form of &lt;a href=\"cannon\"&gt;cannon&lt;/a&gt;s (whether on the ground or mounted in &lt;a href=\"Cannon%20tower\"&gt;towers&lt;/a&gt;). Additionally, on the lower tiers, numerous &lt;a href=\"ballista\"&gt;ballistae&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Steam%20tank\"&gt;steam tanks&lt;/a&gt; can be found aimed out to sea.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Harbor%20Guards\"&gt;Stormwind Harbor Guards&lt;/a&gt; is a military subgroup of the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City%20Guard\"&gt;Stormwind City Guard&lt;/a&gt;, operating and patrolling the Stormwind Harbor. It is necessary for a crew to have regulatory papers to moor at the Stormwind Harbor. While they are usually killed on sight by the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Army\"&gt;Stormwind Army&lt;/a&gt;, in very rare cases, &lt;a href=\"pirate\"&gt;pirate&lt;/a&gt;s may obtain a royal pardon for past crimes if they manage to accomplish a mission of great importance to the kingdom. If successful, they will be allowed to moor at the kingdom's harbor.\nHistory.\nFirst War.\nStormwind Harbor was in existence at least by the time of the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;. When the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt; sacked the city, &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt; covered the survivors' retreat to the harbor, from where they set sail for &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, destroying most of the remaining boats to prevent the Horde from following them.\nScourge Invasion.\nImmediately proceeding the commencement of the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, Stormwind Harbor was preemptively &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20Invasion\"&gt;attacked&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; forces, including &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Wyrm%20Raptor\"&gt;frost wyrms&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Towering%20Horror\"&gt;abominations&lt;/a&gt;. The Alliance command, including &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Highlord Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt;, was set up on top of the harbor's walls, overlooking the battle below. The units on the battlefield consisted of members of the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Harbor%20Guards\"&gt;Stormwind Harbor Guards&lt;/a&gt;.\nStormrage.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"War%20Against%20the%20Nightmare\"&gt;War Against the Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;, while the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;'s mist enveloped Stormwind City, the harbor was plunged into darkness.\nCataclysm.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Unrest\"&gt;Elemental Unrest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; units were seen at the harbor.\nAt some point, &lt;a href=\"Bwemba\"&gt;Bwemba&lt;/a&gt; and her &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Warrior\"&gt;party&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear tribe&lt;/a&gt; arrived to the harbor, asking for the help of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Zandalar%20tribe\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; threat in &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt;. Consequently, a group of harbor guards led by &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Sharp\"&gt;Commander Sharp&lt;/a&gt; kept them at bay and sought the help of &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to remove them.\nBlood of Our Fathers.\nEach year during the &lt;a href=\"Remembrance%20Day\"&gt;Remembrance Day&lt;/a&gt;, the port is full of hulls in every color, shape, and size, as the celebration always brought a host of pilgrims to honor and celebrate humanity's heroes. During the Remembrance Day after &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, there were even more boats present than usual, as many civilians sought the protection of Stormwind following the ravages caused across &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;.\nTides of War.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Attack%20on%20Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;destruction of Theramore&lt;/a&gt; at the hands of Warchief &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; and the Horde, a large Alliance fleet under the command of &lt;a href=\"King%20Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; set sail from Stormwind Harbor with the intention of launching an assault on the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; city of &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; in response.\nFollowing the conclusion of the battle and the subsequent destruction of much of the fleet, it was revealed that a new armada was under construction in the harbor, the designers utilizing new and improved techniques to ensure the new ships were even better than before.\nSiege of Orgrimmar.\nDuring the final battle with Garrosh Hellscream in the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; (on &lt;a href=\"heroic%20mode\"&gt;heroic mode&lt;/a&gt;), the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;Heart of Y'Shaarj&lt;/a&gt; notably transported &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Garrosh's adversaries&lt;/a&gt; to Stormwind Harbor. This version of the harbor, however, proved to be one in a dystopian future, where the &lt;a href=\"True%20Horde\"&gt;True Horde&lt;/a&gt; has succeeded in overwhelming all opposition, with Stormwind and its harbor in ruins.\nSimilarly, the &lt;a href=\"Vision%20of%20Time\"&gt;Vision of Time&lt;/a&gt; also grants a vision of the ruined harbor in a possible future. Whether this is the same future as the one presented by the Heart of Y'shaarj is unclear, however, in both visions of Stormwind Harbor, the Alliance and Horde leaders who stood against Garrosh and his True Horde can be seen impaled upon spikes mounted on the seawall.\nLegion.\nStormwind Harbor is the launching point for the Alliance forces sent to attack the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;. Accepting puts the player into a phased version of the harbor, where the weather is always rainy and gloomy. Ships, soldiers, siege weapons, and flying machines are being prepared by all the races of the Alliance. Several things can be seen there:\nBattle for Azeroth.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20of%20Teldrassil\"&gt;Burning of Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;, many night elf and worgen refugees found haven in Stormwind and can be found on and near the northern dock. Night elf ships, including the one to &lt;a href=\"Rut%27theran%20Village\"&gt;Rut'theran Village&lt;/a&gt;, have been retired and replaced with ships from Kul Tiras under the direction of the new dockmaster &lt;a href=\"Aron%20Kyleson\"&gt;Aron Kyleson&lt;/a&gt; who is in charge of the \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Relentless\"&gt;Relentless&lt;/a&gt;\", a transport ship for diplomats coming from &lt;a href=\"Boralus\"&gt;Boralus&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe ship to &lt;a href=\"Rut%27theran%20Village\"&gt;Rut'theran Village&lt;/a&gt; was retired, with a new ship to &lt;a href=\"Boralus\"&gt;Boralus&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; taking its place.\nAfter the Alliance captured &lt;a href=\"Princess%20Talanji\"&gt;Princess Talanji&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Prophet%20Zul\"&gt;Prophet Zul&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Empire\"&gt;Zandalari Empire&lt;/a&gt;, Talanji's ship was placed within the harbor. Thus, when the Horde led a strike team into the city to rescue the captured Zandalari, they would make haste to docks. En route, they clashed with Alliance soldiers who were returning from the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Battle for Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; before ultimately being confronted by &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;. However, before a battle could commence, Zul revealed that he set Stormwind aflame. With Stormwind burning, Jaina rushed to join efforts in putting out the fires, while the Horde and Zandalari were able to make their way to Talanji's ship and escape to &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt;. Despite this, six Alliance ships followed them, but only one returned as the others were destroyed by the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Fleet\"&gt;Golden Fleet&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs the war progressed, many deceased Alliance soldiers were laid here.\nFeatures.\nLighthouse.\nA short distance from the mainland, northwest of the harbor itself, sits the lighthouse. Naturally, the lighthouse serves to guide the many ships into the harbor using its powerful light which is perpetually shining. The lighthouse is one of the key features of the harbor and is visible from almost all areas of it.\nIt has sat empty for some time, since the harbor has become much safer to enter in recent years. A &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II%23Memorial\"&gt;tombstone&lt;/a&gt;, supposedly that of a former keeper and whose inscription has faded over time, is present behind it. In truth, the &lt;a href=\"bloodied%20crown\"&gt;bloodied crown&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;King Terenas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; is buried here, likely done so by refugees of Lordaeron, or possibly by &lt;a href=\"Thoras%20Trollbane\"&gt;Thoras Trollbane&lt;/a&gt;.\nWharfs.\nStormwind Harbor contains several wharfs and jetties protruding into the bay. It is from these that the ships entering and leaving the harbor dock and launch from. The wharfs serve both a civilian and military function, as vessels associated with both are known to regularly make use of them. Notably, the southernmost dock appears to be both operated and guarded by &lt;a href=\"Darnassus%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;, it serving as the link between the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"capital\"&gt;capital&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe gate.\nThe contents behind the large gate in the harbor, which is located on its northern face, is currently unknown. Due to the similarity it shares with &lt;a href=\"Hangar\"&gt;hangers&lt;/a&gt;, it is possible that it is used to build or house Alliance &lt;a href=\"gunship\"&gt;gunship&lt;/a&gt;s. This is also supported by the fact that there are currently no known locations where these airships are made, despite the Alliance possessing at least several of them. Whatever is truly behind the gate, it must be of some great import or value, judging by its impressive security.\nDry docks.\nThe harbor is also home to a set of dry docks. These docks are responsible for the creation and maintenance of warships in the Alliance navy and can be found in the harbor's northwest, near to the lighthouse. The docks appear to be currently specializing in dealing with the powerful &lt;a href=\"Destroyer%23Human%20destroyer\"&gt;Icebreaker&lt;/a&gt; class of destroyers, which were first used in the &lt;a href=\"War%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;campaign in Northrend&lt;/a&gt;.\nHarbor fortress.\nAs part of the harbor's potent defenses, a fortress is located at the highest tier, with a commanding view of the entire port. it is located on the edge of the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City%20Cemetery\"&gt;Stormwind City Cemetery&lt;/a&gt; and boasts a range of cannons protruding from its interior. Similar to the other fortifications, the fortress' primary function appears to be to ward off any assault on the harbor - or the city - from the sea, although it may also function as a guardhouse for the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Harbor%20Guard\"&gt;harbor guards&lt;/a&gt;.\nTravel connections.\nBoat.\nNote: During the quest &lt;a href=\"Call%20of%20Duty%20%28Alliance%29\"&gt;Call of Duty (Alliance)&lt;/a&gt;, the boat to Valiance Keep is phased out and inaccessible, replaced with the mercenary ship going to &lt;a href=\"Vashj%27ir\"&gt;Vashj'ir&lt;/a&gt;. If you need a ride to Valiance Keep, either complete the Vashj'ir quest first or abandon it and reaccept it later.\nInhabitants.\n\"Excludes \"The Assurance\".\""}

There are also multiple secret passages.\nHistory.\nFirst War.\nStormwind Keep was then a grand castle, bigger than the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Citadel\"&gt;Violet Citadel&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;. Its roof was shod with blue slate and the complex had many side buildings, towers, and halls. Arching galleries spanned between the buildings. One of the towers was a &lt;a href=\"gryphon%20aviary\"&gt;gryphon aviary&lt;/a&gt;, though according to &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt; it was precisely the wrong spot for such a place because of bad crosswind. The &lt;a href=\"conjurer\"&gt;conjurer&lt;/a&gt;s of the realm had dedicated mage-chambers, one of which housed the Conjurer-Lords &lt;a href=\"Huglar\"&gt;Huglar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hugarin\"&gt;Hugarin&lt;/a&gt;. The castle had at least five levels.\nSome times after the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt; started, a rogue &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; was thought to be marauding through the city so the king and his courtiers got locked up in their quarters until Medivh investigated the problem.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Llane%20Wrynn%20I\"&gt;King Llane&lt;/a&gt;'s murder by &lt;a href=\"Garona%20Halforcen\"&gt;Garona&lt;/a&gt;, the keep was destroyed by the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt; during the final days of the war.\nSecond War.\nOnce the kingdom was retaken after the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, a new castle was raised upon the foundations of the old one. The &lt;a href=\"Horde%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Horde of Draenor&lt;/a&gt; raided the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Library\"&gt;Royal Library&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Medivh\"&gt;Book of Medivh&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt one point, Varian did battle with an assassin who had snuck into the Keep and nearly stabbed the young Anduin.\nThe Comic.\nEntering Stormwind Keep, Lo'Gosh, one half of &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, declared &lt;a href=\"Katrana\"&gt;Katrana&lt;/a&gt;'s masquerade was over and called her by her true name: &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Onyxia&lt;/a&gt;. Revealing her &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt; form and transforming multiple guards into &lt;a href=\"dragonspawn\"&gt;dragonspawn&lt;/a&gt;, Lo'Gosh and his allies began battle in the throne room of the keep. The arrival of &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Highlord Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; along with &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin&lt;/a&gt; greatly aided them in securing the keep, but &lt;a href=\"Reginald%20Windsor\"&gt;Reginald Windsor&lt;/a&gt; was killed moments later by Onyxia. Anduin, surprised by seeing two Varians, urged them to stop fighting each other and face the true threat, the brood mother Onyxia. The great dragon snatched Anduin and teleported them to her lair daring Varian to follow suit in her &lt;a href=\"Onyxia%27s%20Lair\"&gt;lair&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the death of the Broodmother, the &lt;a href=\"%3ADrakefire%20Amulet\"&gt;:Drakefire Amulet&lt;/a&gt; she used to manipulate the kingdom's leadership was locked away in Stormwind Keep, in order to prevent anyone else from using its manipulating magic.\nCataclysm.\nThe statues of the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Gallery\"&gt;Royal Gallery&lt;/a&gt; were damaged by the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;.\nStormrage.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"War%20Against%20the%20Nightmare\"&gt;War Against the Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;, the keep was initially one of the places not caught in the mists of the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;, although the horrific dreamforms of the Nightmare's victims converged on the keep, while it was defended by the keep's guards and King Varian.\nLegion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt;, the keep was infiltrated several times. First, demons disguised themselves as soldiers in the funeral ceremony for Varian Wrynn when the Alliance leaders gathered. They were exposed by their new allies, the &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt;. Later, the city was under martial law, with the keep being extra guarded. It was, however, infiltrated by the &lt;a href=\"Veiled%20Hand\"&gt;Veiled Hand&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the &lt;a href=\"Uncrowned\"&gt;Uncrowned&lt;/a&gt; who ultimately stopped the demon cult. The center of the throne room had a big demonic rune painted on the floor, and the garden had a demonic portal summoned by the traitor &lt;a href=\"Melris%20Malagan\"&gt;Melris Malagan&lt;/a&gt;. Later, a nathrezim, disguised as a guard, tried to assassinate Anduin Wrynn.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Thorns\"&gt;War of the Thorns&lt;/a&gt;, knowing their chances of fending off the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; army were slim to none, &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; ordered that the portals from &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; be constantly open throughout &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;, notably in the keep, where many &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elven&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilnean&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"refugee\"&gt;refugee&lt;/a&gt;s arrived after being evacuated.\nDragonflight.\nSome time after the discovery of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;, a disgraced noble named &lt;a href=\"Count%20Clessington\"&gt;Count Clessington&lt;/a&gt; arranged for the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; to steal the &lt;a href=\"%3ADrakefire%20Amulet\"&gt;:Drakefire Amulet&lt;/a&gt; from Stormwind Keep.\nResidents.\n\"Excludes the above areas.\"\nIn the RPG.\nThe mighty Stormwind Keep (or Stormwind castle) sits watch over &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; atop the cliffs north of the city. &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; helped construct this fine building. It houses the King himself and many of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Nobles\"&gt;city's nobles&lt;/a&gt;. It was designed with the thought of another invasion in mind: if the city fell to an army vaster than it could handle, the keep itself becomes a means of escape, with several secret tunnels entombed deep within the rock.\nFilm universe.\nStormwind Keep is depicted close to its \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" incarnation but its interior is different. It notably contains the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20room%23Film%20universe\"&gt;throne room&lt;/a&gt;."}

They are charged with protecting the ruling monarch of Stormwind and their family, and will often accompany members of the royal family (especially the king) on journeys or expeditions.\nBackground.\nThe Stormwind Royal Guard acts as a last line of defense for the monarch of &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;. While they are regularly seen to guard their sovereignty within &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;, they also frequently travel to distant lands and war zones, should the monarch's duties also bring them there. The Royal Guard also form the permanent garrison of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt;, with the majority of their number based from there.\nIn addition to safeguarding their sovereign, Royal Guards have been sent to carry out other important tasks for the monarchy, such as delivering sensitive messages.\nOrigins and First War.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Gnoll%20War\"&gt;Gnoll War&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20War\"&gt;Gurubashi War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Barathen%20Wrynn\"&gt;Barathen Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; charged into the fray twice, each time followed by his personal guards. Half of the knights died during the first conflict but were ultimately victorious, while the king died on the field of battle during the second one.\nPrior to the events of the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, they were known as the King's Honor Guard. Sir &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt; was notably a member of the force. At this time they served as the protectors of &lt;a href=\"Llane%20Wrynn%20I\"&gt;King Llane Wrynn I&lt;/a&gt;, though Llane would eventually be assassinated by the half-breed &lt;a href=\"Garona%20Halforcen\"&gt;Garona Halforcen&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the fall of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; at the end of the First War, it is unknown whether the Royal Guard continued to function; the young heir to the throne &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; at this time resided in the protection of &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt;. Nevertheless, when Varian ascended to the throne and Stormwind was rebuilt after the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, the Royal Guard returned as the bodyguards of the Stormwindian monarch once again.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nThe Royal Guard continued to operate during the time of the regency in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, guarding &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Prince Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;his father&lt;/a&gt;'s absence. The machinations of the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragon\"&gt;black dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Onyxia&lt;/a&gt;, disguised as the influential royal advisor &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Katrana%20Prestor\"&gt;Lady Katrana Prestor&lt;/a&gt;, affected even the Royal Guard itself. Many members of the force were secretly supplanted with &lt;a href=\"Onyxia%27s%20Elite%20Guard\"&gt;the broodmother's agents&lt;/a&gt;. These forces eventually revealed themselves and attempted to slay King Varian and his allies when they confronted Onyxia in the &lt;a href=\"throne%20room\"&gt;throne room&lt;/a&gt;, though they were overcome.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, members of the Royal Guard accompanied &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Lady Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; when they traveled to attend the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Tournament\"&gt;Argent Tournament&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt;. They were present with the king when he met with &lt;a href=\"Highlord%20Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Highlord Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt;.\nStormrage.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"War%20Against%20the%20Nightmare\"&gt;War Against the Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;, many of Varian's personal contingent were turned to sleep. The captain of the guard stood by Anduin when he fell to sleep.\nCataclysm.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the Stormwind Royal Guard was deployed to areas of &lt;a href=\"Elwynn%20Forest\"&gt;Elwynn Forest&lt;/a&gt;, where serious threats had begun to emerge. Mounted Royal Guards patrolled the region's roads, while another contingent was based in &lt;a href=\"Northshire%20Abbey\"&gt;Northshire Abbey&lt;/a&gt; to keep the route open and the abbey safe. The Royal Guards also issued a proclamation ordering the destruction of all &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt;s in the region of &lt;a href=\"Three%20Corners\"&gt;Three Corners&lt;/a&gt;, in the southwestern area of &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt;.\nMists of Pandaria.\nThroughout the &lt;a href=\"Alliance-Horde%20war\"&gt;conflict&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, Royal Guards periodically accompanied &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and his son &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Prince Anduin&lt;/a&gt;. The prince's two royal bodyguards would travel with him to the &lt;a href=\"Tavern%20in%20the%20Mists\"&gt;Tavern in the Mists&lt;/a&gt;, as well as to the &lt;a href=\"Timeless%20Isle\"&gt;Timeless Isle&lt;/a&gt; off Pandaria's southeastern coast. Two members of the Royal Guard were present with King Varian at the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20in%20the%20Snow\"&gt;battle&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Shimmer%20Ridge\"&gt;Shimmer Ridge&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Frostmane%20tribe\"&gt;Frostmane tribe&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s (though neither the king nor his guards saw combat).\nThe Royal Guard was finally present with King Varian and other &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; leaders throughout the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, with a large force accompanying the king himself as he addressed the new &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; upon the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Highguard%20Kailus\"&gt;Highguard Kailus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Highguard%20Tyrius\"&gt;Highguard Tyrius&lt;/a&gt; were two guards present during the conflict.\nLegion.\nAt the onset of the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"King%20Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; was killed at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; becoming the new King of &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; and thus the primary charge of the Royal Guard. During the subsequent funeral of King Varian, &lt;a href=\"Felblade%20Assassin\"&gt;demonic assassins&lt;/a&gt; infiltrated the ranks of the Royal Guard and staged an attack on the new King Anduin and the gathered &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; leaders. With the help of the real royal guards and Alliance &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt;, the ambush was a failure.\nAnother &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; assassination attempt was made on the king some time later, when a disguised &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt; attacked Anduin in the Keep. He quickly dealt with the demon, however, before the Royal Guard could even arrive, though they were ordered to sweep the Keep for any other Legion agents. The garrison of Royal Guards in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt; was later put on alert when the &lt;a href=\"Veiled%20Hand\"&gt;Veiled Hand&lt;/a&gt; and the traitor &lt;a href=\"Melris%20Malagan\"&gt;Melris Malagan&lt;/a&gt; infiltrated the fortress.\nA squad of Royal Guards would eventually accompany King Anduin as he delivered a speech at &lt;a href=\"Lion%27s%20Rest\"&gt;Lion's Rest&lt;/a&gt; officially announcing the defeat of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, King Anduin Wrynn was guarded by &lt;a href=\"Lion%27s%20Guard\"&gt;Lion's Guard&lt;/a&gt;s, however ordinary Royal Guards were still in service.\nDragonflight.\nAfter they saved the kingdom from &lt;a href=\"Count%20Clessington\"&gt;Count Clessington&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Duncon%20Ratsbon\"&gt;Duncon Ratsbon&lt;/a&gt;, who used the &lt;a href=\"%3ADrakefire%20Amulet\"&gt;:Drakefire Amulet&lt;/a&gt; to convince the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; to march on &lt;a href=\"Northshire%20Abbey\"&gt;Northshire Abbey&lt;/a&gt; and use it as a staging ground to pillage Stormwind City itself, &lt;a href=\"General%20Hammond%20Clay\"&gt;General Hammond Clay&lt;/a&gt; promoted the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champion of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; into a &lt;a href=\"Lionguard\"&gt;Lionguard&lt;/a&gt; and bestowed them with a new armor during a ceremony in the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Heroes\"&gt;Valley of Heroes&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpeculation.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Bodyguard\"&gt;Alliance Bodyguard&lt;/a&gt; might have been a member."}

{"id": "406777", "revid": "46586549", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=406777", "title": "Adherents of Rukhmar", "text": "The Adherents of Rukhmar were a religious order that ruled &lt;a href=\"arakkoa\"&gt;high arakkoan&lt;/a&gt; society with unyielding fanaticism. These flying followers of the sun goddess were based in &lt;a href=\"Skyreach\"&gt;Skyreach&lt;/a&gt;, atop the &lt;a href=\"Spires%20of%20Arak\"&gt;Spires of Arak&lt;/a&gt;, and came to power when they overthrew the beloved Talon King out of jealousy. &lt;a href=\"Sunwalker%20Dezco\"&gt;Sunwalker Dezco&lt;/a&gt; calls them \"a violent, isolationist, and decadent race\".\nAt the height of their power, the regal arakkoa plotted atop their high peaks, well out of the reach of the brutal and the &lt;a href=\"Arakkoa%20Outcasts\"&gt;wingless outcasts&lt;/a&gt; below. The arakkoa gazed out from these treacherous perches, watching their land like incarnate gods, and paying homage to the blessed sun by burning the \"low races\" alive. The Adherents had a caste system, and one's place in society was chosen before one was even given a name.\nAfter Terokk's fall, the Adherents slandered his rule, writing of it in many scrolls and tomes as a time of darkness where the tyrant Terokk had committed crimes and depraved acts. According to this false history, Terokk's tyranny was brought to an end when the Adherents rose up against him and liberated the arakkoa from oppression. Rukhmar then turned her back on Terokk, who became shriveled and maddened.\nThe Adherents were searching for &lt;a href=\"Apexis\"&gt;Apexis&lt;/a&gt; artifacts across Draenor to use their technology against the &lt;a href=\"Arakkoa%20Outcasts\"&gt;Arakkoa Outcasts&lt;/a&gt;. They claimed it was theirs by the will of Rukhmar, but in truth they had found sites such as the &lt;a href=\"Apexis%20Excavation\"&gt;Apexis Excavation&lt;/a&gt; by accident. They used this salvaged Apexis technology to create a &lt;a href=\"Breath%20of%20Rukhmar\"&gt;crystal superweapon&lt;/a&gt;, which fired beams of light down on the &lt;a href=\"Arakkoa%20Outcasts\"&gt;Outcasts&lt;/a&gt; below, setting their towns on fire.\nFollowing the player's actions in the Spires of Arak and the death of &lt;a href=\"High%20Sage%20Viryx\"&gt;High Sage Viryx&lt;/a&gt;, the remaining Adherents abandoned their fanatic hatred of the Outcasts and joined forces with them in the newly-formed &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Awakened\"&gt;Order of the Awakened&lt;/a&gt;.\nCulture.\nShadow magic is strictly prohibited in Adherent society. The punishment for crimes in Adherent society, such as owning tomes of dark magic among other things, is being tossed into the pools at the &lt;a href=\"Sethekk%20Hollow\"&gt;Sethekk Hollow&lt;/a&gt;, transforming arakkoa into a &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Sethe\"&gt;cursed&lt;/a&gt;, flightless state. This method served to create the flightless arakkoa encountered both in and later in the main timeline's &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. The Adherents fear and hate the arakkoa cursed by &lt;a href=\"Sethe\"&gt;Sethe&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Adherents pair young arakkoa together. Doing so means the fledgling members of the order can watch over each other and ensure that everyone follows the decrees of Rukhmar. If one accomplishes a great feat, both would be showered with praise. Likewise, if one transgresses, both would be punished. Flying arakkoa also carry with them dreamcatchers that are said to protect them from Sethe's curse. The dreamcatchers allegedly absorb the Curse of Sethe and then get rid of the darkness in the morning light.\nThe flying arakkoa hold a &lt;a href=\"Rukhmar%27s%20Grace\"&gt;festival&lt;/a&gt; celebrating Rukhmar during the time in the summer when the days are the longest. As well, every time a mark on a sundial is cast on by a shadow they say a prayer to their goddess.\nWhile the ancient Apexis wielded the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;, the Adherents used &lt;a href=\"solar%20magic\"&gt;solar magic&lt;/a&gt; comparable to &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s."}

The advanced target dummy looks more realistic than the standard model, as it includes better padding and realistic-looking armor. It can make random combat-like sounds (clanking metal, challenging shouts, and the like). Its weapon swings on a ball point, and it can take random steps in different directions. Finally, the padding is soaked in human sweat and pheromones, so animals are more likely to be fooled by the dummy's presence. These features greatly improve the advanced target dummy's ability to distract opponents."}

A vital hub of this shadow network is Blackrock Caverns, site of the cult's blistering forge and some of its most heinous experiments, including the transformation of cultists into twilight dragonkin.\n&lt;a href=\"End%20Time\"&gt;End Time&lt;/a&gt;.\nOne of an infinite number of potential outcomes, this timeway depicts the desolate future of Azeroth should Deathwing fail to be stopped. Nozdormu has identified a powerful anomaly that exists in this moment and bars access to the past - and hope of retrieving the Demon Soul. The powerful creature from out of time live alone amidst the time-twisted echoes of the past.\n&lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;.\nDon't be fooled by Grim Batol's humble exterior; many of this mountain fortress's desecrated chambers are buried deep in the Twilight Highlands. Once the stronghold of the Wildhammer dwarves, and later seized by orcs as a prison for Alextrasza,[sic] the city is now in the clutches of the Twilight's Hammer cult. Heroes brave enough to infiltrate the brooding depths of the stronghold must confront Deathwing's agents to thwart the mysterious evil within.\n&lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Origination\"&gt;Halls of Origination&lt;/a&gt;.\nConstructed by the great titans, the Halls of Origination are filled with ancient relics and the fearsome guardians that protect them. Rumors abound that the complex also contains a devastating weapon capable of reordering all life on Azeroth. Deathwing has moved to obtain this terrifying device through his agent, Al'Akir the Windlord. Thus far the facility's communication systems have been fully corrupted, but the weapon inside continues to elude Deathwing's grasp.\n&lt;a href=\"Hour%20of%20Twilight%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Hour of Twilight&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith the Dragon Soul retrieved from the part, the Heroes of Azeroth now prepare for the final confrontation with Deathwing. In the frozen wastes of Northrend, the towering spire of Wyrmrest Temple is under the assault of Deathwing's Twilight forces. In order to save Azeroth, Thrall must arrive safely at the temple with the Dragon Soul in hand.\n&lt;a href=\"Lost%20City%20of%20the%20Tol%27vir\"&gt;Lost City of the Tol'vir&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Lost City of the Tol'vir is the stronghold of the Neferset, a faction of the cat-like tol'vir who swore fealty to Deathwing in exchange for a cure to the curse of flesh which had turned their rocky hides to soft skin. With the affliction expunged the tol'vir have rebelled against their benefactor, although they remain irrevocably twisted and hostile due to the dark pact that they made\n&lt;a href=\"Stonecore\"&gt;The Stonecore&lt;/a&gt;.\nWithin the Temple of Earth, locked in the heart of Deepholm, lies the Stonecore. It was inside these caverns that the Twilight's Hammer toiled over Deathwing, hammering elementium plates to the Dragon Aspect's body in an attempt to hold his tormented form together. With his renewal complete, Deathwing ascended into Azeroth, shattering the World Pillar and destabilizing the region of Deepholm.\n&lt;a href=\"Vortex%20Pinnacle\"&gt;The Vortex Pinnacle&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Vortex Pinnacle exists within the elemental plane of Skywall. Its elegant structures, crowned with bronze and gold, sit atop platforms bridged by pure air. Yet behind its exterior beauty, the pinnacle harbors Neferset tol'vir, as well as Al'Akir the Windlord's merciless elemental legions. As long as the barrier between Skywall and Azeroth remains open, terror will rain down on Uldum from the skies.\n&lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20the%20Tides\"&gt;Throne of the Tides&lt;/a&gt;.\nDeep within the Abyssal Maw's fathomless expanses lies the Throne of the Tides. From here, the great elemental lord Neptulon the Tidehunter has surveyed and protected his aquatic domain for ages. He now faces his greatest challenge as a force of serpentine naga and malefic faceless ones threaten to depose him, leaving his realm and its secrets ripe for the plundering.\n&lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;.\nTen-thousand years in the past, the night elven capital city of Zin-Azshari was a magnificent sparkling metropolis. Situated on the shores of the Well of Eternity, it was here that the aristocratic Highborne first opened a portal into the Twisting Nether and invited the Burning Legion to invade Azeroth. Under the command of the night elven queen, Azshara, they now pour their energies into the portal, preparing it for the terrifying and glorious entrance of the demon god Sargeras.\n&lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt;.\nEchoes of unfulfilled vengeance linger in the one-time capital of the Amani tribe, Zul'Aman. Though the Amani trolls answered their warlord's call to arms, Zul'jin was denies his goal of restoring the empire to it's former glory. Where he failed, the Zandalar tribe will succeed. Left unchecked, the unites tribes will reclaim their lands and savor a merciless retribution.\n&lt;a href=\"Zul%27Gurub%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Zul'Gurub&lt;/a&gt;.\nZul'Gurub was the capital of the Gurubashi jungle trolls, a tribe that once controlled the vast jungles of the south. It was here that Jin'do the Hexxer summoned the savage loa Hakkar the Soulflayer into Azeroth. Of late, these efforts have begun anew amid an alliance between the Gurubashi and Zandalar trolls that seeks to establish a unified troll empire."}

Yet with the devastation wrought by the Cataclysm, the prison's integrity has been compromised. Now as the Horde and Alliance vie for supremacy on the island, the liberation of its forgotten horrors may be at hand.\n&lt;a href=\"Blackwing%20Descent\"&gt;Blackwing Descent&lt;/a&gt;.\nNefarian and his warped attempts to create a new breed of dragon were thought to be defeated after his death in Blackwing Lair, Yet tales have emerged that his father, Deathwing, has reanimated Nefarian and set him to work in Blackwing Descent. The gruesome experiments being conducted there are feared to be on a level of wickedness far surpassing Nefarian's previous crimes against nature.\n&lt;a href=\"Bastion%20of%20Twilight\"&gt;The Bastion of Twilight&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Bastion of Twilight stands as a dark symbol of the Old Gods' burgeoning power on Azeroth. Various branches of the Twilight's Hammer dwell deep beneath the towering form -- considered the cult's foremost command center -- along with their twisted leader, Cho'gall. There, he and his servants conspire to bring the Old Gods' apocalyptic visions to fruition by bleeding Azeroth of all sanity, hope and life.\n&lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20the%20Four%20Winds\"&gt;Throne of the Four Winds&lt;/a&gt;.\nAl'Akir the Windlord's personal lair, the Throne of the Four Winds, glides high among Skywall's boundless vistas. Now that the barriers of the Elemental Plane have been ruptured, Al'Akir is free to travel Azeroth's winds at his leisure. He has mustered his fiercest tempests to scour Uldum of life and seize control of the mysterious titan-forged Halls of Origination.\n&lt;a href=\"Firelands%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Firelands&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Firelands is the molten domain forged by the titans to house Ragnaros and his wayward minions. Following Deathwing's emergence into Azeroth, Ragnaros and his servants surged onto the slopes of Mount Hyjal before being driven back by the sacred mountain's valiant defenders. Now Ragnaros is rallying his loyalists to defend the Firelands from Azeroth's champions.\n&lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt;.\nForged by Deathwing during the War of the Ancients, the Dragon Soul harnessed the combined power of the dragonflights until it was ultimately destroyed. Through the Caverns of Time, Thrall and the remaining dragonflights were able to recover the powerful artifact before its destruction. Now they have rallied at Wyrmrest Temple in a desperate attempt to use the might of the Dragon Soul against Deathwing himself."}

Millennia later, members of the Twilight's Hammer cult were drawn to the temple by whispers and foul dreams. After sacrificing untold numbers of innocents, the cult was rewarded with a new task: to protect one of the Old Gods' most cherished creatures, a pet that is still in need of nurturing before he can unleash his dark powers on the world.\n&lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Depths\"&gt;Blackrock Depths&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe smoldering Blackrock Depths are home to the Dark Iron dwarves and their emperor, Dagran Thaurissan. Like his predecessors, he serves under the iron rule of Ragnaros the Firelord, a merciless being summoned into the world centuries ago. The presence of chaotic elementals has attracted Twilight's Hammer cultists to the mountain domain. Along with Ragnaros' servants, they have pushed the dwarves toward increasingly destructive ends that could soon spell doom for all of Azeroth.\n&lt;a href=\"Deadmines\"&gt;Deadmines&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is said the Deadmines' gold deposits once accounted for a third of Stormwind's treasure reserves. Amid the chaos of the First War, the mines were abandoned and later thought to be haunted, leaving them relatively untouched until the Defias Brotherhood -- a group of former laborers turned brigands -- claimed the labyrinth as a base of operations for its subversive activities against Stormwind.\n&lt;a href=\"Dire%20Maul\"&gt;Dire Maul&lt;/a&gt;.\nBuilt thousands of years ago to house the kaldorei's arcane secrets, the formerly great city of Eldre'Thalas now lies in ruin, writhing with warped, twisted forces. Competing covens once fought for control of Dire Maul's corrupted energy, but they have since settled into uneasy truces, choosing to exploit the power within their own territories rather than continue to battle over the entire complex.\n&lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt;.\nBuilt deep within the mountains of Dun Morogh, the wondrous city of Gnomeregan was a testament to the gnomes' intelligence and industry. But when the capital was invaded by troggs, the gnomish high tinker was betrayed by his advisor Sicco Thermaplugg. As a result, Gnomeregan was irradiated, and most of its inhabitants slain. The surviving gnomes fled, vowing to return someday and retake their home.\n&lt;a href=\"Lower%20Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Lower Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis imposing fortress, carved into the fiery core of Blackrock Mountain, represented the might of the Dark Iron clan for centuries. More recently, the black dragon Nefarian and his spawn seized the keep's upper spire and ignited a brutal war against the dwarves. The draconic armies have since allied with Warchief Rend Blackhand and his false Horde. This combined force lords over the spire, conducting horrific experiments to bolster its ranks while plotting the meddlesome Dark Irons' downfall.\n&lt;a href=\"Maraudon\"&gt;Maraudon&lt;/a&gt;.\nAccording to legend, Zaetar, son of Cenarius, and the earth elemental princess Theradras begot the barbaric centaur race. Shortly after the centaur's creation, the ruthless creatures murdered their father. The grief-stricken Theradras is said to have trapped her lover's spirit within Maraudon, corrupting the region. Now, vicious centaur ghosts and twisted elemental minions roam every corner of the sprawling caves.\n&lt;a href=\"Ragefire%20Chasm\"&gt;Ragefire Chasm&lt;/a&gt;.\nRagefire Chasm extends deep below the city of Orgrimmar. Barbaric troggs and devious Searing Blade cultists once plagued the volcanic caves, but now a new threat has emerged: dark shaman. Although Warchief Garrosh Hellscream recently called on a number of shaman to use the elements as weapons against the Alliance, the chasm's current inhabitants appear to be renegades. Reports have surfaced that these shadowy figures are amassing a blistering army that could wreak havoc if unleashed upon Orgrimmar.\n&lt;a href=\"Razorfen%20Downs\"&gt;Razorfen Downs&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegends state that where the demigod Agamaggan fell, his blood gave rise to great masses of thorny vines. Many quilboar have taken up residence in the largest cluster of giant thorns, the Razorfen, which they revere as Agamaggan's resting place. Recently, scouts have reported seeing undead milling about the region, engendering fears that the dreaded Scourge may be moving to conquer Kalimdor.\n&lt;a href=\"Razorfen%20Kraul\"&gt;Razorfen Kraul&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegends state that where the demigod Agamaggan fell, his blood gave rise to great masses of thorny vines.

Recently, scouts have reported seeing undead milling about the region, engendering fears that the dreaded Scourge may be moving to conquer Kalimdor.\n&lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Halls\"&gt;Scarlet Halls&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Crusade's fiercest warriors, those who have held their ground and fought to defend the monastery throughout these dark times, are rapidly preparing an army within the Scarlet Halls. These soldiers are bound by their hatred of the unliving, and they are willing to sacrifice everything for their order's righteous cause.\n&lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Monastery%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Scarlet Monastery&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Crusade's fanatical leaders direct their followers from the Scarlet Cathedral, at the heart of the monastery grounds. This heavily guarded location functions as the order's headquarters, and some of the most zealous and intolerant crusaders roam the halls of this once-hallowed place. \n&lt;a href=\"Scholomance\"&gt;Scholomance&lt;/a&gt;.\nIndividuals seeking to master the powers of undeath know well of Scholomance, the infamous school of necromancy located in the dark and foreboding crypts beneath Caer Darrow. In recent years, several of the instructors have changed, but the institution remains under the control of Darkmaster Gandling, a particularly sadistic and insidious practitioner of necromantic magic.\n&lt;a href=\"Shadowfang%20Keep\"&gt;Shadowfang Keep&lt;/a&gt;.\nLooming over Pyrewood Village from the southern bluffs of Silverpine Forest, Shadowfang Keep casts a shadow as dark as its legacy. Sinister forces occupy these ruins, formerly the dwelling of the mad archmage Arugal's worgen. The restless shade of Baron Silverlaine lingers while Lord Godfrey and his cabal of erstwhile Gilnean noblemen plot against their enemies both living and undead.\n&lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;.\nStratholme was once the jewel of northern Lordaeron, but today it is remembered for its harrowing fall to ruin. It was here that Prince Arthas turned his back on the noble paladin Uther Lightbringer, slaughtering countless residents believed to be infected with the horrific plague of undeath. Ever since, cursed Stratholme has been marred by death, betrayal, and hopelessness.\n&lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Stockade\"&gt;The Stockade&lt;/a&gt;.\nStormwind Stockade is a closely guarded prison built beneath the canals of Stormwind City. Warden Thelwater keeps watch over the stockade and the highly dangerous criminals who call it home. Recently, the inmates revolted, overthrowing their guards and plunging the prison into a state of pandemonium.\n&lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Atal%27Hakkar\"&gt;The Temple of Atal'Hakkar&lt;/a&gt;.\nThousands of years ago, the Gurubashi empire was plunged into a civil war by a powerful sect of priests, the Atal'ai, who sought to summon to Azeroth an avatar of their god of blood, Hakkar the Soulflayer. The Gurubashi people exiled the Atal'ai to the Swamp of Sorrows, where the priests built the Temple of Atal'Hakkar. Ysera, Aspect of the green dragonflight, sank the temple beneath the swamp and assigned wardens to ensure that the summoning rituals never be performed again.\n&lt;a href=\"Uldaman\"&gt;Uldaman&lt;/a&gt;.\nUldaman is an ancient titan vault buried deep within the earth. It is said the titans sealed away a failed experiment there and then moved on to a new project, related to the genesis of the dwarves. Tales of a fabled treasure containing great knowledge have enticed would-be treasure hunters to dig deeper into the secrets of Uldaman, a task made perilous by the presence of stone defenders, savage troggs, Dark Iron invaders, and other dangers lurking in the lost city.\n&lt;a href=\"Wailing%20Caverns\"&gt;Wailing Caverns&lt;/a&gt;.\nYears ago, the famed druid Naralex and his followers descended into the shadowy Wailing Caverns, named for the mournful cry one hears when steam bursts from the cave system's fissures. Naralex planned to use the underground springs to restore lushness to the arid Barrens. But upon entering the Emerald Dream, he saw his vision of regrowth turn into a waking nightmare, one that has plagued the caverns ever since.\n&lt;a href=\"Zul%27Farrak\"&gt;Zul'Farrak&lt;/a&gt;.\nZul'Farrak was once the shining jewel of Tanaris, ferociously protected by the cunning Sandfury tribe. Despite the trolls' tenacity, this isolated group was forced to surrender much of its territory throughout history. Now, it appears that Zul'Farrak's inhabitants are creating a horrific army of undead trolls to conquer the surrounding region. Other disturbing rumors tell of an ancient creature sleeping within the city--one that, if awakened, will rain death and destruction across Tanaris."}

Though it fell dormant with the rest of the Isles, it has reopened and is back under the guidance of Headteacher Doragosa. In a series of exciting, new changes the Academy is currently seeking new students from all walks of life, not just dragons, as well as volunteers to help get it back to the bustling halls of education it once was. Those who walk the Academy grounds are sure to learn something new.\n&lt;a href=\"Brackenhide%20Hollow\"&gt;Brackenhide Hollow&lt;/a&gt;.\nBrackenhide Hollow is the largest gnoll settlement in the Dragon Isles, and home to unspeakable danger. Decay seeps from the Hollow, spreading among the gnoll tribes of the Azure Span and threatening to rot away all life. In the heart of the Hollow lies the leader of the Brackenhide, and the knowledge she gleefully shares with her withered kin.\n&lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Infusion\"&gt;Halls of Infusion&lt;/a&gt;.\nDeep beneath Tyrhold lies the Halls of Infusion. Its structure was built upon an ancient wellspring, the waters of which were channeled by Keeper Tyr to feed the Life Pools of the red flight. Now that the Dragon Isles have reawakened, Primalist forces have invaded these halls. Have they come to destroy the facility... or to reveal secrets that Tyr left behind?\n&lt;a href=\"Neltharus\"&gt;Neltharus&lt;/a&gt;.\nBeneath the Obsidian Citadel lies Neltharus, home of the black dragonflight's hoard and the secrets behind their legendary forging. When the djaradin woke from their slumber, they chose Neltharus as the point of entry for their attack. Surprised to find it deserted, they quickly laid claim to its secrets for themselves... as well as the rest of the Obsidian Citadel.\n&lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Life%20Pools\"&gt;Ruby Life Pools&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs the ancestral nesting grounds for the five flights, the Ruby Life Pools is a sacred place. The Red Dragonflight, whose charge it is to nuture all life, protect these pools and the the future of all dragonkind held within them.\nHowever, Raszageth and her Primalists have come to steal that future away and infuse their own powers into the sacred pools. They must be stopped for dragonkind to thrive.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Azure%20Vault\"&gt;The Azure Vault&lt;/a&gt;.\nLong ago, Malygos created the Azure Vault as a place for Sindragosa to catalogue and store any curious magical artifacts he found. Locked away and deserted millennia ago, the Vault has since fallen into disrepair, leaving it vulnerable to attacks from without... and within.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Nokhud%20Offensive\"&gt;The Nokhud Offensive&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter Clan Nokhud captured the ancient eagle spirit, Ohn'ahra, civil war spread across the Ohn'ahran plains like wildfire. To the other clans, Ohn'ahra is more than a mere spirit: she is their goddess. Primalists summon elemental forces, and necromancers command the spirits of legendary centaur. Beset by enemies, the other Maruuk clans rally. The Nokhud tyrant, Balakar Khan, watches from afar, bellowing commands. Relentless enemy offenses will continue until his forces submit. The battlefield awaits.\nUldaman is an ancient titan facility where, long ago, allies of the heroic Keeper Tyr hid the Discs of Norgannon.\nAfter returning to the Dragon Isles, Queen Alexstrasza learned of another disc locked away within Uldaman... one that holds the memories of Tyr himself. Believing this knowledge is needed to restore the power of the Aspects, Alexstrasza has asked her mortal allies to brave the perils of Uldaman and recover Tyr's memories to secure the future of dragonkind."}

Now, as Dalaran floats above the Broken Isles as the flagship of the war against the Legion, a shadowy threat once again seeks to strike at Kirin Tor from within.\n&lt;a href=\"Black%20Rook%20Hold\"&gt;Black Rook Hold&lt;/a&gt;.\nCarved from the greatest mountain of Val'sharah by ancient elven masons, Black Rook Hold stood as a bulwark against the Burning Legion during the War of the Ancients.

Once a peaceful place of worship, corruption has turned protector into poisoner, with Mephistroth at the helm - and the powerful dreadlord has one aim: to annihilate those who seek to return the Aegis of Aggramar to its resting place.\n&lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Stars\"&gt;Court of Stars&lt;/a&gt;.\nEven as Legion troops patrol the streets, casting a pall over the grand city of Suramar, the socialites of the Nightborne nobility continue to cling to custom and routine. On this clear night, the cry of revelers echoes through the chill air, as the largest mansion in the Noble District opens its doors for the grand gala. Rumor has it that Grand Magistrix Elisande herself may be making an appearance, in an effort to reassure several of her closest allies despite recent turmoil.\n&lt;a href=\"Darkheart%20Thicket\"&gt;Darkheart Thicket&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the shadow of Shaladrassil, the Nightmare permeates every inch on the once-lush forest. Where the eldest and greatest druids once tended to the woods, meditating beneath the great world tree, corruption and madness now reign. Deep within the tangled thicket, the Nightmare Lord Xavius works to break the will of his greatest prize.\n&lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Azshara%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Eye of Azshara&lt;/a&gt;.\nAmidst outlying shoals off the coast of Azsuna, an ancient source of power lies beneath the waves. Long ago, the power of Queen Azshara extended throughout these lands, and the naga seeking the Tidestone of Golganneth still act at her behest. As clouds roll in and the air crackles with the energy of an approaching storm, Azshara's followers prepare to summon an incarnation of her Wrath to lay waste to the land.\n&lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Halls of Valor&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the clouds high above Stormheim, the titanic keeper Odyn has called the greatest vrykul warriors on Azeroth to be his Valarjar. Amidst feasting halls and hunting grounds, these ascended vrykul test themselves and prepare for the great war that is to come. Adventurers must pass through these halls and prove their worth if they hope to stand before Odyn and claim the Aegis of Aggramar.\n&lt;a href=\"Maw%20of%20Souls\"&gt;Maw of Souls&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile the greatest vrykul warriors are spirited away to the Halls of Valor to glory eternal, shiny and gold, the cursed and the damned find themselves on the shores of the Maw of Souls. Amidst fog and mist, they await the Naglfar, a fearsome ship formed from sinew and bone, which comes to deliver these poor souls to helheim, and the clutches of Helya. \n&lt;a href=\"Neltharion%27s%20Lair\"&gt;Neltharion's Lair&lt;/a&gt;.\nNeltharion, better known as Deathwing, once called these caves home. Since his fall, the drogbar that once worshipped the great dragon built their capitol within this ancient lair. Now, Dargrul, chieftain of the drogbar, rallies a massive army within these depths. If left unchecked, the mad king's army will surge from the mountainside, devastating Highmountain and all of Azeroth with it.\n&lt;a href=\"Return%20to%20Karazhan\"&gt;Return to Karazhan&lt;/a&gt;.\nFrom the moment of its mysterious creation, the purpose of this dark tower has been intertwined with the history of the Guardians of Tirisfal, once Azeroth's greatest bulwark against the Legion. It is now best known as the home of Medivh, who tragically betrayed Azeroth and brought the unbroken chain of Guardians to an end. This legacy makes Karazhan a place of particular interest for the Legion, who have descended in full force in an effort to open a new front in their way on the denizens of Azeroth.\n&lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20the%20Triumvirate%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Seat of the Triumvirate&lt;/a&gt;.\nArgus was governed from the gleaming halls of the Seat of the Triumvirate--until the eredar struck their unholy bargain with Sargeras. Enraged by Velen's defiant exodus, Kil'jaeden decreed that the Seat should be abandoned as a symbol of an irrelevant past... for the Legion had become their future.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Arcway\"&gt;The Arcway&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs vast as the city of Suramar is, the vast network of tunnels beneath the city spans an even greater reach. Nightborne society has grown to depend on the power of the Nightwell, and the Arcway delivers that lifeblood throughout the city. This labyrinthine complex was built thousands of years ago, running beneath the foundations of the city's largest buildings, and most modern citizens live their lives entirely unaware of what may lurk in the shadows beneath their feet...\n&lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20the%20Wardens\"&gt;Vault of the Wardens&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis secret Warden facility was carved into the mountainside deep in Azsuna, and sealed with magical wards both to keep intruders out, and to ensure that the terrors locked within could never escape. Many of the most dangerous foes the Wardens have encountered was locked away within the Vault, but in the aftermath of Cordana's betrayal and the Legion's attack, those creatures now roam the halls freely."}

While the power of the Nightwell preserved the city of Suramar, the surrounding lands bear the scars of that catastrophic event. But now Gul'dan has awakened the Tomb of Sargeras, and from the tauren camps in the peaks of Highmountain, to the druidic groves of Val'sharah, to vrykul settlements that dot Stormheim, the Isles live in the shadow of the Legion.\n&lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare%20%28instance%29\"&gt;The Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Emerald Dream was created by the titans as a blueprint for Azeroth itself - a verdant and perfect mirror that reflects the state of nature had it remained unspoiled by so-called civilization. For many years, the druids and keepers who are closest to nature have noticed signs of an unsettling presence stirring within the Dream. Spurred on by the Legion and Nightmare Lord Xavius, that creeping corruption has now burst forth, and will engulf all of Azeroth if it is not rooted out at its source.\n&lt;a href=\"Trial%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Trial of Valor&lt;/a&gt;.\nSince Loken's betrayal, Odyn has been trapped within the Halls of Valor as Helya plots in the shadows to claim the souls of his valarjar champions. In recent days, however, great heroes have arrived in the lands of Stormheim in the Legion's wake. Hoping that their might and determination could tip the scales and end Helya's reign, Odyn summons these champions for a final test.\n&lt;a href=\"Nighthold%20%28instance%29\"&gt;The Nighthold&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe largest structure in the Broken Isles, and among the grandest in all of Azeroth, the Nighthold stands as a testament to the achievements of the nightborne civilization. Centered around the Nightwell, the fount of arcane energy that has sustained Suramar for centuries, these grounds were built as a haven from the worries of the world. But as a felstorm churns above the former temple of Elune across the bay, and Gul'dan himself now resides within the palace's walls, those worry now begin, not end, here.\n&lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;.\nAegwynn used this sacred temple of Elune to lock away the defeated Sargeras' avatar. She hoped it would remain dormant, buried deep within the earth, but the lure of power has continued to draw foul entities to this site. When Gul'dan re-entered the tomb, he tore down Aegwynn's wards and opened a doorway for the Legion to invade. Now, the fel army tears at the vault, hoping to reclaim their master's power.\n&lt;a href=\"Antorus%2C%20the%20Burning%20Throne\"&gt;Antorus, the Burning Throne&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the core of Argus lies Antorus, the Burning Throne. From this seat of power, Sargeras drives his burning crusade to ravage the cosmos. Within the Throne's nigh-impenetrable depths, primordial powers are forged into weapons of utter annihilation. Should these forces rise to serve their master, the final hour will fall upon all of creation.\n&lt;a href=\"Invasion%20Points\"&gt;Invasion Points&lt;/a&gt;.\nFrom its stronghold on Argus, the Legion employs a vast array of portals to spread across the cosmos like a plague. Countless worlds have been plundered for resources, their inhabitants forced to serve the Dark Titan or endure a slow, agonizing death. Unless these worlds can be liberated, the Burning Crusade will consume everything it touches and leave the universe in ashes."}

This mighty ruler has formulated a bold plan to unite his scattered people and reclaim the glory of their fallen empire. With turmoil gripping Pandaria, Xin's lofty dream of conquest could become reality.\n&lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan%20Monastery\"&gt;Shado-Pan Monastery&lt;/a&gt;.\nWar has spread across Pandaria, and the destructive conflict between the Horde and Alliance has led to turmoil in the majestic Shado-pan Monastery. There, three malevolent entities--the Sha of Violence, the Sha of Hatred, and the Sha of Anger--have erupted from their prisons. Although the Sha of Anger fled the secluded monastery completely, the remaining sha have begun wreaking havoc on the site's brave Shado-pan defenders.\n&lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Niuzao%20Temple\"&gt;Siege of Niuzao Temple&lt;/a&gt;.\nNiuzao Temple extends across two fortified islands far beyond a towering wall called the Serpent's Spine. For years, tenacious pandaren defenders have protected the narrow bridges connecting the isles, staving off any would-be invaders. Yet recently, the mantid created their own bridge--a massive tree root--and seized one of the islands by surprise. Now, these brutal insectoids are poised to assault Niuzao's remaining guardians.\n&lt;a href=\"Stormstout%20Brewery\"&gt;Stormstout Brewery&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen Chen Stormstout arrived in the Valley of the Four Winds, he journeyed to the renowned brewery of his namesake, hoping to connect with his relatives. What he found was his ancestral home in disarray. Under the watch of the incompetent Uncle Gao, loathsome virmen and unruly hozen have infiltrated the brewery, sparking a destructive revel that will soon devastate the region's supply of tasty beer.\n&lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Jade%20Serpent\"&gt;Temple of the Jade Serpent&lt;/a&gt;.\nRising high above the east coast of Pandaria, the Temple of the Jade Serpent stands as a sacred monument to the legendary pandaren emperor Shao Hao's victory over the Sha of Doubt thousands of years ago. Recently, a disastrous conflict in the Jade Forest unleashed the sha, and several of the entities have raided the temple's most treasured stores of wisdom and knowledge."}

It is the homeland of the enigmatic Pandaren, a race that celebrates life to the fullest even while under siege by an ancient menace.\n&lt;a href=\"Mogu%27shan%20Vaults\"&gt;Mogu'shan Vaults&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe mogu, proud of their supremacy, kept lengthy records of their accomplishments within a great complex of vaults.

Her increasingly erratic and paranoid commands have driven the Klaxxi--the keepers of mantid culture--to take aggressive action. Because they are few in number, the Klaxxi are reluctantly willing to accept outside help in destroying the empress and purging their race of the sha's negative influence.\n&lt;a href=\"Terrace%20of%20Endless%20Spring\"&gt;Terrace of Endless Spring&lt;/a&gt;.\nStraddling the mountain range between the Jade Forest and the Vale of Eternal Blossoms, the Terrace of Endless Spring has been a sacred refuge for millennia.

The mists also hid a reminder of an ancient evil: Lei Shen's Throne of Thunder. During his rule, this fortress was the seat of the Thunder King's power. Even after his death, great swathes of corrupted energy lingered, and now, the resurrected Thunder King and the Zandalari trolls intend to harness that energy to establish the reign of Lei Shen once again.\n&lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe tensions stoked by Garrosh Hellscream's arrogance have reached a boiling point with the destruction unleashed upon the Vale of Eternal Blossoms.

They are also referred to as champions, heroes, commanders, and later as generals, order leaders, and &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Walker\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt;s. Although unnamed and numerous, it is thanks to these brave individuals that &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and worlds beyond have been saved on numerous occasions in recent times. During the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, one of each class was named leader of their &lt;a href=\"Class%20Order\"&gt;order&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nIn the aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s troubles began multiplying at a rapid pace as the malevolent &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s subtly incited chaos and local conflicts to weaken the world's nations. It was not the heroes of past wars who rose up to face the emerging threats; it was the ordinary citizens of Azeroth. Some fought for adventure or glory, while others fought for profit or the opportunity to seek vengeance against a hated faction. Some traveled alone, while others formed mighty &lt;a href=\"guild\"&gt;guild&lt;/a&gt;s to work together against the darkness. As the years passed, these extraordinary champions were called upon to do the impossible. Without them, Azeroth would surely have succumbed to evil.\nThe adventurers mostly come from the two largest factions on Azeroth, the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. Death knights are part of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; and demon hunters the &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt;, though some of them also retain their allegiance to their former faction. As such, most adventurers are from the races composing these factions. Adventurers are mostly loyal to their faction, &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, or the Ebon Blade and the Illidari, and will quickly respond when they hear the call to &lt;a href=\"Battleground\"&gt;war&lt;/a&gt;. However, some of them have also worked for other neutral organizations as well, such as the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Steamwheedle%20Cartel\"&gt;Steamwheedle Cartel&lt;/a&gt;, usually for &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; or other rewards.\nAs the skirmishes between the Horde and the Alliance continue to push the two factions to all-out war, the adventurers of the world are always on the forefront of many battlefields. While the old hatreds burn bright in the hearts of many of them, they have been willing to fight alongside one another against greater foes, as seen at the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, on many occasions.\nWhere a regiment of orc grunts or human footmen fail, the adventurers succeed. Many are one-person armies, being able to defeat a large number of enemies and become even stronger in the process. Their strength comes from slaying foes and performing tasks as well as from the magic coming from their armor, weapons, and magical items. When adventurers work together, they combine their incredible power and defeat powerful enemies.\nNearly all adventurers have a &lt;a href=\"hearthstone\"&gt;hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;, a magic stone which, through some sort of strange, arcane ritual performed by an &lt;a href=\"innkeeper\"&gt;innkeeper&lt;/a&gt;, allows the wielder to return to a specific location where the stone is bound to.\nKnown actions.\nRecent events.\nFive years after the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the adventurers saved the day numerous times in recent years. They:\nThe war on Outland.\nIn year 26, adventurers journeyed to &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, holding off the Illidari and &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; activities. They:\nThe war against the Scourge.\nIn year 27, adventurers:\nThe Hour of Twilight.\nAfter the battle-hardened adventurers of Azeroth triumphed against the Scourge, another major threat arose in year 28, the return of &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;. Adventurers thus:\nMists of Pandaria.\nImmediately after the fall of Deathwing and his servants, the adventurers' respective leaders dedicated their factions &lt;a href=\"Alliance-Horde%20war\"&gt;completely to war&lt;/a&gt;. The agents of the Horde infiltrated &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt;, resulting in its utter destruction. They later accidentally rediscovered the mythical and long-forgotten lands of &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, a continent far to the south that had until now been shrouded in magical mists and touched by the ancient malevolence known only as the &lt;a href=\"sha\"&gt;sha&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith both factions landing on Pandaria, adventurers rediscovered the ancient &lt;a href=\"Pandaren\"&gt;Pandaren&lt;/a&gt;, whose wisdom helped guide them to new destinies: the &lt;a href=\"Pandaren%20Empire\"&gt;Pandaren Empire&lt;/a&gt;'s ancient enemy, the &lt;a href=\"Mantid\"&gt;Mantid&lt;/a&gt;, and their legendary oppressors, the enigmatic &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs conflicts heated up between the Alliance and Horde, the land changed over time, with subsequent events escalating the conflict between Alliance leader &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and the increasingly unbalanced Horde Warchief &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, eventually leading to a schism within the Horde itself.\nAs civil war wracked the Horde, the Alliance and those in the Horde opposed to Hellscream's violent uprising &lt;a href=\"Escalation\"&gt;joined forces&lt;/a&gt; to take &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;the battle directly to the enemy&lt;/a&gt;, leading to direct confrontation with Hellscream and his Sha-touched allies in a concluding showdown deep within the bowels of Orgrimmar itself.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nIron March Invasion.\nMonths after Garrosh Hellscream's mysterious escape from his trial, the Dark Portal suddenly turned red and a seemingly endless and technologically advanced army of orcs calling itself the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt; poured through it into the &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt;. The combined forces of the Alliance and Horde were able to push the invasion back to the portal and break through to the other side, along with &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;, and a number of other heroes of Azeroth. On the other side of the portal they recognized Draenor - not the broken world of Outland, but a living, breathing world free of fel corruption \u2014 and an even more massive army than they imagined. Securing the immediate area, it was discovered that , &lt;a href=\"Teron%27gor\"&gt;Teron'gor&lt;/a&gt;, and were imprisoned beneath and their fel magic was powering the portal to Azeroth. In a decision that would later have dire consequences, the champions chose to release the warlocks, disabling the portal.\nAs the Iron Horde fell upon them in insurmountable numbers, the champions fled through the &lt;a href=\"Tanaan%20Jungle\"&gt;Tanaan Jungle&lt;/a&gt;. The leaders of this Iron Horde brought their forces to bear against the intruders in pursuit. Chieftains of the &lt;a href=\"Bleeding%20Hollow%20clan%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Bleeding Hollow&lt;/a&gt;, of the &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Hand%20clan%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Shattered Hand&lt;/a&gt;, of the &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20clan%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Shadowmoon&lt;/a&gt;, of the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Blackrock&lt;/a&gt; and the Warchief above them all of the &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20clan%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Warsong&lt;/a&gt; attacked the champions with their armies. In spite of the Iron Horde's defenses, the champions were able to destroy the Dark Portal on the Draenor side, buying time for leaders back in Azeroth to develop a plan to defeat the new enemies.\nNew allies.\nSurrounded by the Iron Horde, the champions fled to other parts of Draenor to find allies on the savage world, the Alliance champions to the draenei of , and the Horde champions to the orcs of &lt;a href=\"Frostfire%20Ridge\"&gt;Frostfire Ridge&lt;/a&gt; that they learned had not joined the Iron Horde. Adventurers established &lt;a href=\"garrison\"&gt;garrison&lt;/a&gt;s in the respective areas, and as they did so, it became clear that the Iron Horde may have invaded Azeroth prematurely, as they had not fully secured Draenor yet. Alliance champions broke through the siege of &lt;a href=\"Karabor\"&gt;Karabor&lt;/a&gt; while Horde champions cut off the Iron Horde's advance in &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Pass\"&gt;Thunder Pass&lt;/a&gt;. The defeat of the Shadowmoon clan in the &lt;a href=\"Defense%20of%20Karabor\"&gt;Defense of Karabor&lt;/a&gt; provided the opportunity for adventurers of both factions to push further into the &lt;a href=\"Anguish%20Fortress\"&gt;Anguish Fortress&lt;/a&gt; into the &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Burial%20Grounds\"&gt;Shadowmoon Burial Grounds&lt;/a&gt;, where they defeated the first of the mighty Warlords Ner'zhul.\nWith their new allies, both factions' champions pushed north to &lt;a href=\"Gorgrond\"&gt;Gorgrond&lt;/a&gt; in the hopes of bringing the fight to the Iron Horde's facilities in the region. The champions discovered powerful &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt; artifacts and used them to break the Iron Horde's defenses at the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Docks\"&gt;Iron Docks&lt;/a&gt; and eventually took the facility and the nearby &lt;a href=\"Grimrail%20Depot\"&gt;Grimrail Depot&lt;/a&gt;. The champions also destroyed the Kirin Tor camp in the &lt;a href=\"Everbloom\"&gt;Everbloom&lt;/a&gt;, which had been infested by the native &lt;a href=\"Primals\"&gt;Primals&lt;/a&gt; hostile to both sides.\nTalador and the arakkoa.\nThe champions continued to augment their forces with heroes from Draenor and Azeroth and expanded their garrisons to formidable fortresses for the battle ahead. Both then pushed into the heart of the continent, &lt;a href=\"Talador\"&gt;Talador&lt;/a&gt;, where they liberated from the Iron Horde's forces under the command of and Blackhand. During the battle, Blackhand killed Doomhammer for insubordination, but even as his fleet lay broken he escaped back to Gorgrond. The champions then pushed south to break the siege of by , &lt;a href=\"Teron%27gor\"&gt;Teron'gor&lt;/a&gt; and their allies who had intended to use the souls in repose there for their own ends.\nThe champions then traveled even further south to the &lt;a href=\"Spires%20of%20Arak\"&gt;Spires of Arak&lt;/a&gt; to assist the &lt;a href=\"Arakkoa%20Outcasts\"&gt;Arakkoa Outcasts&lt;/a&gt; in their insurgency against the &lt;a href=\"Adherents%20of%20Rukhmar\"&gt;Adherents of Rukhmar&lt;/a&gt;. The Adherents' leader, &lt;a href=\"High%20Sage%20Viryx\"&gt;High Sage Viryx&lt;/a&gt;, was defeated in &lt;a href=\"Skyreach\"&gt;Skyreach&lt;/a&gt;, and the Outcasts summoned the spirit of &lt;a href=\"Terokk%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Terokk&lt;/a&gt; to help the champions repel the advance of the Shattered Hand into the region. Kargath Bladefist, however, was able to defeat Terokk even as his forces were forced to retreat.\nNagrand and the Blackrock Foundry.\nThe champions then advanced west to the rolling plains of Nagrand, where they found the Warsong clan led by the fugitive Garrosh from their own world, who had forged an alliance with the &lt;a href=\"Gorian%20Empire\"&gt;Gorian Empire&lt;/a&gt; capital of &lt;a href=\"Highmaul\"&gt;Highmaul&lt;/a&gt;. The champions pushed into the Warsong capital of &lt;a href=\"Grommashar\"&gt;Grommashar&lt;/a&gt; but were subdued by Garrosh. &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; rescued the defeated champions and killed Garrosh in &lt;a href=\"mak%27gora\"&gt;mak'gora&lt;/a&gt;. The champions then turned their attention to and the &lt;a href=\"Pale\"&gt;Pale&lt;/a&gt; under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt;. The champions defeated the Pale, but Cho'gall managed to escape. The defeat of the Warsong left the Iron Horde in disarray in the area, opening an opportunity for the champions to invade Highmaul. Kargath Bladefist made a last-ditch attempt to defeat the champions, an attempt which cost him his life and became the second Warlord to fall. The defeat of Highmaul's leader &lt;a href=\"Imperator%20Mar%27gok%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Imperator Mar'gok&lt;/a&gt; brought an end to Highmaul's support for the Iron Horde, as well as an end to the ogre threat. In fury, Cho'gall also attacked the champions, but was brought down by the same champions who defeated Mar'gok.\nWith Nagrand secured, the champions returned to Gorgrond to lay siege to the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Foundry\"&gt;Blackrock Foundry&lt;/a&gt;. Deep in the bowels of the Foundry, the champions defeated Blackhand, the third Warlord to fall.\nTanaan Jungle.\nWith the Iron Horde defeated in most outlying areas, Gul'dan was able to seize control of its remaining army, now calling itself the Fel Horde. The champions then invaded the Tanaan Jungle to attack . Here they slew the last member of the original Warlords, Kilrogg Deadeye, and destroyed the mutated abomination Teron'gor had become in the aftermath of the events in Auchindoun. Further on, they defeated the newly \"cured\" &lt;a href=\"Shadow-Sage%20Iskar\"&gt;Shadow-Sage Iskar&lt;/a&gt;, rescued Grommash from the grip of the Burning Legion, struck down the revived &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt;, and ultimately stopped &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt;'s attempt to destroy the world.\nLegion.\nThe Tomb of Sargeras.\nAs &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;alternate Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; was thinking about betraying the Burning Legion in the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; like his &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;counterpart&lt;/a&gt; did, the horrific realization that all the adventurers of Azeroth would then try to kill him made him choose to stand with the demon army instead.\nBroken Isles.\nWith the advent of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, adventurers from all around Azeroth stepped forward. Those strong enough to brave the demonic army resurrected long-forgotten &lt;a href=\"Class%20Order\"&gt;class orders&lt;/a&gt; or became champions of the old. Wielding powerful legendary &lt;a href=\"Artifact\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt;, these adventurers were chosen to marshal a resistance against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Of these few, twelve champions from both the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; stepped forward to protect Azeroth, and brought together many notable heroes to serve alongside them.\nThe player-character adventurer is known among the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; itself, and their power is impressive according to &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey confronted the evils of the eredar homeworld of &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;, taking down the Legion's commanders, and defeated the titan &lt;a href=\"Argus%20%28titan%29\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt; with the aid of the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;. After &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;'s imprisonment and the of the world, the Speaker of Azeroth, &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, showed the champions how to use their &lt;a href=\"artifact\"&gt;artifact&lt;/a&gt; weapons and absorb the corrupting energy of the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Sword of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nAs Azeroth was endangered by its wounds, she and &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; declared some of the planet's worthiest heroes to be Champions of Azeroth, entrusting them each with an &lt;a href=\"%3AHeart%20of%20Azeroth\"&gt;:Heart of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Those mighty protectors sought to absorb &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt; with their medallions.\nKul Tiras.\nAn &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; emissary went with &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; to attempt to bring &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; back into the Alliance. However, both the emissary and Jaina were incarcerated upon their arrival in &lt;a href=\"Boralus\"&gt;Boralus&lt;/a&gt;, the emissary being sent to &lt;a href=\"Tol%20Dagor\"&gt;Tol Dagor&lt;/a&gt;. They were then broken from the prison by the efforts of &lt;a href=\"Taelia\"&gt;Taelia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Flynn%20Fairwind\"&gt;Flynn Fairwind&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Cyrus%20Crestfall\"&gt;Cyrus Crestfall&lt;/a&gt;, taking them back to Boralus.\n&lt;a href=\"Halford%20Wyrmbane\"&gt;Halford Wyrmbane&lt;/a&gt; specifically requested the adventurer by name. So did &lt;a href=\"Master%20Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Master Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Falstad%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Falstad Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt;.\nAdventurers were needed to kill wolves in Stormsong. In &lt;a href=\"Drustvar\"&gt;Drustvar&lt;/a&gt;, a group of children formed the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer%27s%20Society\"&gt;Adventurer's Society&lt;/a&gt; to find treasures.\nZandalar.\nA &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; adventurer accompanied an elite team in infiltrating the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Stockades\"&gt;Stormwind Stockades&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; to rescue &lt;a href=\"Princess%20Talanji\"&gt;Princess Talanji&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zul%20the%20Prophet\"&gt;Zul the Prophet&lt;/a&gt;, under orders from &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Lady Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, to add the strength of the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Empire\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Fleet\"&gt;fleet&lt;/a&gt; into the Horde's strength. Upon escaping the human city, Talanji brought them to the Zandalari capital of &lt;a href=\"Dazar%27alor\"&gt;Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt; to meet with her father, &lt;a href=\"King%20Rastakhan\"&gt;King Rastakhan&lt;/a&gt;. Rastakhan proceeded to name the adventurer Speaker of the Horde for the Zandalari.\nThe Speaker of the Horde accompanied Talanji on an expedition to &lt;a href=\"Nazmir\"&gt;Nazmir&lt;/a&gt;, in order to combat the &lt;a href=\"blood%20troll\"&gt;blood troll&lt;/a&gt; threat. They also personally slew the corrupted &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Hir%27eek\"&gt;Hir'eek&lt;/a&gt;.\nNazjatar.\nSome adventurers could choose to serve &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt; by accepting and keeping &lt;a href=\"Gift%20of%20N%27Zoth\"&gt;its gift&lt;/a&gt;.\nBlood War.\nAs a result of inner turmoil within the Horde, some adventurers chose to side with &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; and joined his rebellion, while others sided with &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; and joined the &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20loyalists\"&gt;Banshee loyalists&lt;/a&gt;.\nShadowlands.\nIn the Shadowlands, the adventurer is known as a &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Walker\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt;, based on their ability to leave the normally inescapable &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt; at will. Ironically, Sylvanas Windrunner was the first to ever escape the Maw after striking a deal with the Jailer.\nDragonflight.\nOn the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;, some refer to the adventurer as the &lt;a href=\"Dragonriding\"&gt;Dragonrider&lt;/a&gt;."}

They gave the troggs all their gold in exchange for permission to dig, but unfortunately this did not go quite as planned. They were captured until a real adventurer, sent by &lt;a href=\"Thaddeus%20%22Gramps%22%20Rifthold\"&gt;Thaddeus Rifthold&lt;/a&gt;, the grandfather of &lt;a href=\"Nigel%20Rifthold\"&gt;Nigel&lt;/a&gt;, rescued them. They were then subsequently punished and forbidden to go out for at least two months."}

At the conclusion of the &lt;a href=\"Nexus%20War\"&gt;Nexus War&lt;/a&gt;, Haleh became the last living consort of &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt;, and the first consort ever to outlive a &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspect\"&gt;Dragon Aspect&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nHaleh is the Matron Protectorate of the blue dragon lair &lt;a href=\"Mazthoril\"&gt;Mazthoril&lt;/a&gt; in the cold region of &lt;a href=\"Winterspring\"&gt;Winterspring&lt;/a&gt;. She is studious, enjoying both literature and scholarly texts, and studies any bit of knowledge or trivia that she comes across. She is also best known for altering her forms and integrating into other societies. Haleh currently prefers the form of a female &lt;a href=\"high%20elf\"&gt;high elf&lt;/a&gt;. Like all blue dragons, she is peaceful, but very territorial.\nWith Haleh on his side, Malygos searches for any magical source or artifact and protects them so that mortal races may not endanger the world with their reckless use.\n&lt;a href=\"Awbee\"&gt;Awbee&lt;/a&gt;, an injured blue whelp on the ground inside &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;, asked a group of heroes to find Haleh with one of its scales, as a message. Haleh requested their help and recruited them as her agents to make sure that &lt;a href=\"Nefarian\"&gt;Nefarian&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"chromatic%20dragonflight\"&gt;chromatic dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; were destroyed.\nHaleh also asked &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; heroes to get the blood of &lt;a href=\"Drakkisath\"&gt;Drakkisath&lt;/a&gt; to create the &lt;a href=\"Drakefire%20Amulet\"&gt;Drakefire Amulet&lt;/a&gt;, a device that might grant them access to &lt;a href=\"Onyxia%27s%20Lair\"&gt;Onyxia's Lair&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, Mazthoril fell under the control of &lt;a href=\"Umbranse%20the%20Spiritspeaker\"&gt;Umbranse the Spiritspeaker&lt;/a&gt;. Haleh moved near the entrance to Mazthoril in a small camp called &lt;a href=\"Beryl%20Egress\"&gt;Beryl Egress&lt;/a&gt; and was accompanied by &lt;a href=\"Daleohm\"&gt;Daleohm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maseel\"&gt;Maseel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zakk%20Sinon\"&gt;Zakk Sinon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jaron%20Stoneshaper\"&gt;Jaron Stoneshaper&lt;/a&gt;. She later sent the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to kill Umbranse.\nDragonflight.\nDespite the rest of her brood heading off to the Dragon Isles, Haleh herself was noted as having remained behind. This was deemed strange by the simulacrum of &lt;a href=\"Sindragosa\"&gt;Sindragosa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt;, who sought to reunite the blue dragonflight. Sindragosa, who had perished long before Malygos had taken Haleh on as a consort, had never met with Haleh before; but expressed interest in meeting with her as she was grateful for her having gone to Malygos in his time of need. Alongside an adventurer, Sindragosa ventured to Winterspring where they found Haleh still toiling away. Displaying a similar quirkiness to other isolated dragons, such as &lt;a href=\"Azuregos\"&gt;Azuregos&lt;/a&gt;, Haleh had been dutifully working towards clearing Winterspring of its myriad issues, having found dozens of cursed or otherwise harmfully enchanted artifacts in the zone. Haleh was initially surprised to see Sindragosa, rightly noting that the elder dragon was an illusion-- specifically a simulacrum.\nHaving reached a new milestone of forty days without finding a new artifact, an accomplishment for which Sindragosa expressed admiration, Haleh asked for aid on her latest investigation of relics. Despite several being deemed harmless, Haleh did indeed discover yet another bewitched artifact, disheartening her immensely. Sindragosa attempted to comfort her fellow consort, but Haleh was disheartened. Ultimately she dispatched the adventurer to locate further artifacts for evaluation, finding little relief in the kind words of her lost broodmate.\nSeeking to alleviate some of Haleh's stress, Sindragosa suggested Haleh take a break. Leading her to the &lt;a href=\"Frostfire%20Hot%20Springs\"&gt;Frostfire Hot Springs&lt;/a&gt;, Haleh immersed herself in the springs; able to relax for the first time in months. She expressed gratitude to Sindragosa and the adventurer, claiming she would consider coming back to the Isles with them stating she still intended to make Winterspring safe for their people. Haleh ultimately did choose to return with Sindragosa; choosing to aid Kalecgos in reuniting the flight.\nHaleh ultimately teamed up with the various other reunited dragons to aid Kalecgos in containing the rampant energies from Malygos and Sindragosa's discordant essences in the &lt;a href=\"Veiled%20Ossuary\"&gt;Veiled Ossuary&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Thaldraszus\"&gt;Thaldraszus&lt;/a&gt;. She worked alongside &lt;a href=\"Azuregos\"&gt;Azuregos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lanigosa\"&gt;Lanigosa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zeros\"&gt;Zeros&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Surigosa\"&gt;Surigosa&lt;/a&gt; in clearing the area. She stood beside Kalecgos and the flight reunited after Sindragosa's simulacrum resumed its rest within the &lt;a href=\"Azure%20Archives\"&gt;Azure Archives&lt;/a&gt; and was present for the passing on of &lt;a href=\"Senegos\"&gt;Senegos&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuotes.\nGossip.\nWhat is it you ask of the Blue Flight?\nIn \"Hearthstone\".\nHaleh appears as a in the \"\" mini-set for \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\". Her flavor text reads: \"Oh, how do you solve a problem like Onyxia?\""}

This does not mean that it cannot happen, however; it is possible it might happen 20 years in the future. The blood elven half is more dominant, and they have the blood elven racial traits.\nLike their blood elven parents, half-blood elves are addicted to the use of arcane magic. A half-blood elf must spend one hour each morning in meditation, resisting the distractions of their addiction, or have problems with spellcasting or spell defense for that day. Half-blood elves slake their thirst through the absorption of fel energies. If the blood elf partakes of demon's blood, the magic addiction abates for a number of days.

Half- is a prefix attached to the offspring of races sharing a mixed ancestry. Half-breed does not denote percentage of one's heritage, but rather refers to one's mixed-heritage, and thus, any &lt;a href=\"Race\"&gt;species&lt;/a&gt; or individual biologically related to at least two separate species. Half-races are so rare in the &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20universe\"&gt;\"Warcraft\" universe&lt;/a&gt; that Blizzard don't really have any established lore about their potential longevities.\nAs stated by &lt;a href=\"Huga\"&gt;Huga&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Council of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt;, rare hybrids such as &lt;a href=\"Half-elf\"&gt;half-elves&lt;/a&gt; are sometimes prodigiously talented and have great potential. However, due to their mixed heritage, half-breeds are often victims of prejudice and rejections in society.\nWhile some custom &lt;a href=\"character%20model\"&gt;character model&lt;/a&gt;s may be created for especially notable half-breeds, they are typically represented in \"World of Warcraft\" by existing models.\nIn the RPG.\nHybrid races, hybrid creatures or hybrids are creatures that resemble two different &lt;a href=\"Race\"&gt;species&lt;/a&gt; (though sometimes more) put together. Azeroth has many of such &lt;a href=\"race\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt;s. Half-breeds also known as crossbreeds, are hybrids, it is unlikely that most hybrid races formed through the coupling of their parent races. Half-breed races are true hybrid races.\nHalf-breed does not denote percentage of one's heritage, but rather refers to one's mixed-heritage. Thus, for example the offspring of a half-elf who coupled with a human, would still be considered &lt;a href=\"half-elf\"&gt;half-elf&lt;/a&gt; itself. In rare cases, an individual may be so far removed from one of their ancestral heritage, that they may be considered a full member of their parent's race. For example, &lt;a href=\"Commodore%20Jessi%20Falrevere\"&gt;Commodore Jessi Falrevere&lt;/a&gt; may have a hint of dwarven blood flowing in her veins. This would suggest, that one of her parents was distantly related to dwarfs, but had enough human blood to be considered human, rather than a hypothetical 'half-dwarf'. However, in general, since the term 'half-'\"race\"' is passed onto the offspring of a half-breed, and since mixed races tend to congregate and create their own cultures and society, it is possible for half-breeds to propagate and ensure the continuation of their 'race'. For example, the half-elves, that wanted to be given their own land, separate from the Alliance, so they could live there own way.\nThe magnataur are considered unique among the hybrid races for many reasons, including their large size. While they obviously resemble centaur, dryads and other hybrid races, they do not appear to be descendants of Cenarius."}

The term &lt;a href=\"half-orc\"&gt;half-orc&lt;/a&gt; can also be used.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Lantresor%20of%20the%20Blade\"&gt;Lantresor of the Blade&lt;/a&gt;, his kind are a rare breed, with most having been killed decades ago. Half-orc, half-draenei are reviled and scorned by both draenei and orc cultures. However, times changed under the &lt;a href=\"New%20Horde\"&gt;New Horde&lt;/a&gt;, as Lantresor and &lt;a href=\"Garona%20Halforcen\"&gt;Garona Halforcen&lt;/a&gt; were included at the first &lt;a href=\"Kosh%27harg\"&gt;Kosh'harg&lt;/a&gt; festival held on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. According to Garona, being half-blooded used to mark one as an outcast among the orcs, but she then mused that it was now a thing of the past, and that she could possibly join one of the clans.\nBackground.\nAround 99 years before the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Bladewind%20clan\"&gt;Bladewind&lt;/a&gt; orcs began raiding draenei caravans. While many draenei wanted to retaliate, their leader &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt; forbade it. Instead, he allowed the &lt;a href=\"Rangari\"&gt;Rangari&lt;/a&gt; to launch covert missions to rescue prisoners, while future caravans were well guarded, often by squads of &lt;a href=\"Vindicator\"&gt;Vindicator&lt;/a&gt;s. The Rangari managed to save a number of prisoners, but not all. These few poor souls were forced into slavery for the rest of their lives, and some of them bore half-breed children for their masters.\nMany years later, &lt;a href=\"Garona%20Halforcen\"&gt;Garona Halforcen&lt;/a&gt; was one of the few Bladewind half-breeds who survived past childhood. After she met &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;, Garona was bound to his will, and the warlock later began to secretly train her as his personal &lt;a href=\"spy\"&gt;spy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"assassin\"&gt;assassin&lt;/a&gt;. As a half-breed, she lived beneath the notice of most orcs, and those who noticed her saw only a servant of Gul'dan, held on a tight leash. She later became infamous among the humans, being the half-orc assassin of &lt;a href=\"Llane%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Llane Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, although it was not her will.\nAmong the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt; forces that invaded &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lantresor%20of%20the%20Blade\"&gt;Lantresor of the Blade&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;a href=\"blademaster\"&gt;blademaster&lt;/a&gt; of half-draenei and half-&lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; descent who served under &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; and Warchief &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt;, before returning home after the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;.\nCharacteristics.\nThe half-draenei possess the traits of both races which they inherit from their parents. However, this is not necessarily always the case, as &lt;a href=\"Lantresor%20of%20the%20Blade\"&gt;Lantresor&lt;/a&gt; looks exactly like an orc, to the point that even the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; could not tell the difference between him and another orc.\nHalf orc half-draenei may have less-pronounced draenic physical features, such as horns, tails, or hooves. &lt;a href=\"Garona%20Halforcen\"&gt;Garona Halforcen&lt;/a&gt;, and her son &lt;a href=\"Med%27an\"&gt;Med'an&lt;/a&gt;, notably show little draenei features like shiny eyes or chin spines on the latter, instead looking almost entirely orcish. When &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; met Garona for the first time, he immediately recognized her as an orc, but when he compared her to the others, he mentioned that she have a smoother skin, which have a lighter shade of green than the jade flesh of the orcs, her fangs are a bit smaller, her eyes are a bit larger and more expressive, but he could not determine if this was due to her being female or because she was a half-breed. According to Garona herself, the orcs saw her as an inferior being, considering her deformed because of her \"wrong face\", her feet almost like hooves, that she was too slender, too pale, too weak, too ugly, and because she doesn't have enough muscle for a female orc.\nAbout their &lt;a href=\"life%20span\"&gt;life span&lt;/a&gt;, Med'an was still an adolescent at the age of 23 years old, even though his father was killed \"almost thirty years\" earlier. &lt;a href=\"Meryl%20Felstorm\"&gt;Meryl Winterstorm&lt;/a&gt; suspected that this is due to Med'an's mixed blood; &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;, and \"something else\" (later revealed to be draenei). However, they are so rare that Blizzard don't really have any established lore about their potential longevities.\nIn the RPG.\nA half-draenei, or Half-orc half-draenei, is a term used to describe the &lt;a href=\"half-breed\"&gt;half-breed&lt;/a&gt; offspring of one &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; parent or half-draenei and another species such as an &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn his notes about the half-orc &lt;a href=\"Garona%20Halforcen\"&gt;Garona Halforcen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; couldn't say what her other parent was, as it would seem impossible for a human and an orc to have produced her since she was already a young woman at the time of the First War. He also mentioned that Garona may \"not\" be a half-draenei, as her features did not match those of the draenei, or any other known race."}

Most half-elves are the hybrid offspring of a &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"high%20elf\"&gt;high elf&lt;/a&gt;. Since the marriages between humans and elves are very rare in the annals of history, their half-breeds are rare in the \"Warcraft\" universe, to the point where Kalecgos cannot pass unnoticed as there aren't a lot of half-elves on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs stated by &lt;a href=\"Huga\"&gt;Huga&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Council of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt;, rare hybrids such as half-elves are sometimes prodigiously talented and have great potential. According to &lt;a href=\"Vereesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Vereesa Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, any evil seeker of magic would use the crossbreeds of a powerful wizard and a high elf for their own interests, as they have so much potential in their bloodlines.\nLike the other half-breeds, due to their mixed heritage, the half-elves may be victims of prejudice in society.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Alodi\"&gt;Alodi&lt;/a&gt; is the oldest known mention of a half-elf in history, having lived around 2,600 years before the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;. From infancy, Alodi never knew his real parents and was raised in an orphanage for magically gifted children in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;. His dubious parentage and mixed ancestry made life difficult for Alodi, as most magi pitied him, others treated him with scorn, and everyone believed he would never rise to greatness. But they were all mistaken, as in time, the orphan would become the first &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardian of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt;, one of the most powerful magi to have ever lived.\nThousands years later, &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vereesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Vereesa Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; fell in love with the humans &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt;, and respectively gave birth to the half-elves named &lt;a href=\"Arator%20the%20Redeemer\"&gt;Arator&lt;/a&gt;, then &lt;a href=\"Giramar\"&gt;Giramar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Galadin\"&gt;Galadin&lt;/a&gt;. Prior to the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zendarin%20Windrunner\"&gt;Zendarin Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; tried to kidnap his nephews for his own interests, although he despised humans, thinking them as little more than animals, and didn't have a much higher opinion of the elves that bred with them.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the spirit of Alodi was summoned on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; in order to aid the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Tirisgarde\"&gt;Tirisgarde&lt;/a&gt; in their war against the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s.\nCharacteristics.\nThe half-elven possess the traits of both races which they inherit from their parents. The twins &lt;a href=\"Galadin\"&gt;Galadin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Giramar\"&gt;Giramar&lt;/a&gt; notably inherited red hair from their human father &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt;, and the elven eyes from their mother &lt;a href=\"Vereesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Vereesa Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;. Their cousin &lt;a href=\"Arator%20the%20Redeemer\"&gt;Arator&lt;/a&gt;, the son of &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, notably shared his mother's same small nose and pointed chin.\nThey have a morphology similar to that of their parents. The only noticeable difference being the length of the ears, which seems to vary from one individual to another, with some having ears halfway between those of elves and humans, while others have ones as long as any elf. The same observation also applies to the size of the eyebrows, which can vary from one individual to another.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, the blue dragon &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; under his mortal form is not unpleasant to look at, even describing him as charming. He also has the best of both human and elven features, blue-black hair that fell to his shoulders, and blue eyes bright with purpose. About his choice of &lt;a href=\"Dragon%23Shapeshifting\"&gt;visage&lt;/a&gt; form, Kalecgos explained to &lt;a href=\"Chronormu\"&gt;Chronormu&lt;/a&gt; that while many blues chose elaborate forms, he instead wanted to be approachable and walk among mortals as a friend and equal, as someone that they can trust.\nAbout their &lt;a href=\"life%20span\"&gt;life span&lt;/a&gt;, the half-elves appear to have the same rate of growth as humans, with Arator being already considered a young adult when he was in his twenties. However, they are so rare that Blizzard don't really have any established lore about their potential longevities.\nKnown half-elves.\nIn \"World of Warcraft\", Alodi is depicted with a human model, Arator with a high elf model, and Kalec with a unique half-elf model.\nIn the RPG.\nBackground.\nThere are other races that are half-elven, but they are usually referred to by other terms. Most half-elves are the hybrid offspring of a human and a half-elf, or of two half-elf parents (a half-elf of high elf and half-elf descent is unlikely due to high elven prejudice). They usually have a combination of physical characteristics from both sides, and can be recognized as half-elves on sight.\nHumans and high elves can produce offspring, and the product of such a union is a half-elf. High elves are not prolific, especially after Quel'Thalas' destruction, and they do not look favorably upon those who couple with other races. As such, half-elves are rare. History reveals certain prejudices against half-elves. Humans are jealous of half-elves' extended life spans. Night elves are suspicious of their high elven heritage. High elves see them as proof of their race's weakening blood. In recent years this bias has waned - wars and strife show how petty such prejudices are. In large cities, which consider themselves enlightened, half-elves find little of the historic discrimination. Still, many individuals, particularly high elves, remain scornful of half-elves and may or may not attempt to hide their feelings. Tensions with the Horde and other forces strain relationships among all races, and some allow this stress to manifest itself in anger against anything different from themselves.\nThey push themselves to excel in whatever their chosen field, whether to hope that success will help them fit in or to spite those who consider them inferior. You will not find a more dedicated priest, a more loyal fighter, or a more studious mage than a half-elf. That a half-elf will ever serve in high position in the Alliance is virtually impossible, but their desire for acceptance nonetheless drives many to volunteer whenever the Alliance has a need. They always face the chance that great heroism may give them the acceptance they have wanted all their lives.\nHalf-elves are members of the Alliance. Half-elves' heritage places them in the Alliance at both ends, and many served in the First, Second, and Third Wars. Half-elves socialize with humans more than with high elves, as the former are generally more accepting \u2014 and easier to find. In their wanderings and search for self, some half-elves join the Horde or become independent. They sometimes find a home within the towns of the Horde, although the culture is so different from elf or human culture that it seldom offers a comfortable fit for long. Their high elf heritage grants half-elves a natural talent with magic-related skills. However, a half-elf does not enjoy a full high elven legacy that would otherwise bestow strong arcane abilities (and the corresponding addiction); however, a half-elves! blood does carry enough mystical heritage to offer some resistance to magic. They have limited arcane ability, drawing upon their high elf heritage, they can cast a few spells.\nPhysical appearance.\nHalf-elves have much the same build as slight humans or heavy high elves. They are more heavily built than purebred high elves. Like their high elf parents, they tend to have fair skin and hair and brilliantly colored eyes, usually blue or green. Though lacking their elven parents' longevity, half-elves still enjoy a long life span, reaching maturity at 20 years of age and living for two or three centuries on average.\nCulture.\nLanguage.\nMost half-elves speak &lt;a href=\"Thalassian\"&gt;Thalassian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Common%20%28language%29\"&gt;Common&lt;/a&gt;. Half-elves are versatile wanderers and pick up many different languages.\nNames.\nHalf-elves follow the naming practices of the culture into which they were born. Many take human first names and elven family names.\nFaith.\nLike their parents on both sides, half-elves revere the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;. Half-elves are particularly fond of the philosophy, as it links them inextricably with both their human and elf parents. They consider the Light as a way of having an identity that they may otherwise lack. Some half-elves choose to follow their elf parents in faith. Half-elves who choose &lt;a href=\"druidism\"&gt;druidism&lt;/a&gt; become &lt;a href=\"savagekin\"&gt;savagekin&lt;/a&gt;.\nDistribution.\nMany half-elves currently live in &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt;, having moved there during the Third War. Stormwind has the largest population of half-elves anywhere in the world. Few still live in Alliance settlements in Lordaeron. A few wander the Ghostlands of Quel'Thalas, learning what they can of their fallen legacy. Many become scouts just so they can spend long periods of time away from other people. Many choose to establish themselves in major cities, where prejudice is not as large a problem as it is in backwater villages. Some have become independent, and a few have joined the Horde.\nAt the point in time that the &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20RPG\"&gt;Warcraft RPG&lt;/a&gt; books take place, the half-elves of human-high elven descent number in the thousands.\nAcceptance.\nAt one time half-elves were barely accepted by the Alliance but are still dedicated to the Alliance cause. They were not fully accepted as they did not fit in with either their human or high elf societies, or even night elves (who were suspicious of their high elven ancestry), and were viewed with prejudice by both of their parent races. While they were dedicated to helping the Alliance they also held the dream of settling their own nation and asked for help from the Alliance. Others felt like taking things into their own hands and left the alliance lands setting up settlements with or without support from their allies. \nHowever, views have been changing in recent years and they are slowly being accepted by both of their parent races according to the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Player%27s%20Guide\"&gt;Alliance Player's Guide&lt;/a&gt;, as wars and strife have proven how petty such prejudice is. They are also said to be proud of their heritage, and name, though they tend to be fairly humble in nature. In many enlightened cities, half-elves find little of the historic discrimination. \nMost humans have finally accepted them into society. Because humans are more easily accepting of them, they tend to socialize more with them. However, some prejudice still exists, especially from many high elves who are scornful of them and may or may not attempt to hide such feelings.\nHalf-elves generally tend to avoid prejudice by rather blending into large cities or wandering.\nOther types of half-elves.\nWhile most half-elves are half-elves of human descent, there are other types of half-elves.\nOf these races, few, if any, exist. Due to the recent rediscovery of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, most half-night elves would be either still in infancy or very young children. Though there is only one known adult \"half-kaldorei\", &lt;a href=\"Feulia\"&gt;Feulia&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn Warcraft III.\nRangers were originally meant to be a &lt;a href=\"Hero%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;hero unit&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Human Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, but were eventually canceled. They were described as such:\n\"These fearless Half-Elven women are masters of survival and wilderness exploration. Trained to hunt down renegade &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Troll\"&gt;Troll&lt;/a&gt;s in the wildlands of both &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28continent%29\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, the Rangers are a force to be reckoned with. Being Half-Elven, the Rangers are often avoided by members of the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;High Elven&lt;/a&gt; stock. However, these crafty females make their home in the wilds and seldom feel the need for the distractions of camaraderie. Rangers are expert marksmen with the longbow and carry specially weighted &lt;a href=\"bow\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt;s and magically enhanced &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt;s.\"\nSpeculation.\nAlthough there are no recorded half-elves of blood elven parentage, it is possible that some high elven parents later became blood elves."}

Most of them are found within the &lt;a href=\"Mok%27Nathal%20clan\"&gt;Mok'Nathal clan&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe mok'nathal were considered half-breeds, lesser than true orcs, by the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt;. However, times changed under the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;New Horde&lt;/a&gt;, and their inclusion at the first &lt;a href=\"Kosh%27harg\"&gt;Kosh'harg&lt;/a&gt; festival held on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; could potentially put an end to their isolationist policy in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\n11 years before the opening of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, as the &lt;a href=\"Gorian%20Empire\"&gt;Gorian Empire&lt;/a&gt; was losing power on &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Imperator%20Kelgrok\"&gt;Imperator Kelgrok&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Bladespire%20clan\"&gt;Bladespire clan&lt;/a&gt; decided to make up for the ogres' low numbers, and ordered Bladespire &lt;a href=\"sorcerer\"&gt;sorcerer&lt;/a&gt;s to conduct cruel experiments in order to create new creatures that could be used as labor. The greatest result came from selective breeding between ogres and enslaved orcs, and the children of these forced unions were called &lt;a href=\"mok%27nathal\"&gt;mok'nathal&lt;/a&gt;, possessing the strength of ogres and the intelligence of orcs. The Bladespire kept the half-breeds in chains and bred them together to create even more. To ensure their loyalty, the ogres threatened to kill entire families if even one of the members rebelled. They were later ordered to make war on the orcs of &lt;a href=\"Frostfire%20Ridge\"&gt;Frostfire Ridge&lt;/a&gt;, rampaging the region, and seizing many tracts of resource-rich land. In the meantime, the united &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20clan\"&gt;Frostwolf clan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Whiteclaw%20clan\"&gt;Whiteclaw clan&lt;/a&gt; army fought the Bladespire and managed to capture a number of mok'nathal, including their elder &lt;a href=\"Leoroxx\"&gt;Leoroxx&lt;/a&gt;. After they learned that the mok'nathal were not willing servants but slaves, &lt;a href=\"Garad\"&gt;Garad&lt;/a&gt; and Leoroxx came to an agreement to destroy the Bladespire clan.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Bladespire\"&gt;Battle of Bladespire&lt;/a&gt;, Leoroxx had incited rebellion among his kin, and together, both the orcs and mok'nathal drove the ogres out, while Leoroxx strangled Imperator Kelgrok with the chains of his slavery. The orcs and mok'nathal had won but at the cost of many lives. Afterward, Garad offered Leoroxx and his people land in Frostfire, but Leoroxx declined because he knew the half-breeds would never truly be accepted by the orcs. The mok'nathal later settled in a remote corner of &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Gorgrond&lt;/a&gt; to live in peace.\nEventually, a force of orcs known as the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; arose on Draenor. &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; offered ogres and mok'nathal a place in the Horde to increase his numbers. After the fall of &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; considered annihilating the mok'nathal but stayed his hand. &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt;, son of Leoroxx, had joined the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt; and convinced Blackhand to spare his people.\nFollowing the reopening of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Garm%20Wolfbrother\"&gt;Garm Wolfbrother&lt;/a&gt; revealed that the mok'nathal were at &lt;a href=\"Mok%27Nathal%20Village\"&gt;Mok'Nathal Village&lt;/a&gt; within the eastern &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Blade's Edge Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, and that they were in danger. Though Leoroxx had refused to cooperate with the Old Horde he was willing to work with the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;New Horde&lt;/a&gt; Meanwhile, Rexxar discovered that the &lt;a href=\"gronn\"&gt;gronn&lt;/a&gt; were directing the ogres against the mok'nathal, and with Horde champions by his side, he eventually killed &lt;a href=\"Gorgrom%20the%20Dragon-Eater\"&gt;Gorgrom the Dragon-Eater&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Goc\"&gt;Goc&lt;/a&gt;. With their deaths, Rexxar declared the Mok'nathal free.\nAppearance.\nThe half-orcs possess the traits of both races which they inherit from their parents.\nHalf-orc half-ogres are taller than orcs due to the ogre blood in their veins, they notably average 8' tall for males and 7' for females. They also have a much-developed musculature, such as &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt;, whose half-breed's powerful legs allow him to keep up the pace as he followed his bear Misha on the run, keeping her within his sight.\nIn \"World of Warcraft\", every half-ogre has the model of the &lt;a href=\"mag%27har%20orc\"&gt;mag'har orc&lt;/a&gt;, and the idea of them being a mid-point between an orc and an ogre has stuck ever since.\nIn the RPG.\nBackground.\nBefore the existence of the Horde, the races that represent most of it today had never even heard of each other, such as half-ogres who were all but unheard of.\nHalf-ogres, whom the orcs call mok'nathal, were created in the rare unions of &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s. Orcs originally bred half-ogres to combine the power of an ogre with the intelligence and cunning of an orc. However, half-ogres proved to be more stubborn than either race, bearing a horrendous independent streak. Little could change a half-ogre's mind once set, so the project was scrapped. Shamanistic orcs honored half-ogres as noble and savage creatures of the land, but quickly the race dwindled, as few orcs would willingly breed with the gigantic ogres.\nRecently, half-ogres reappeared in the world following the exploits of &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Champion%20of%20the%20Horde\"&gt;Champion of the Horde&lt;/a&gt;, the greatest Mok'nathal to ever live. While still rare, more and more half-ogres come out of the woods each day, trying to find a place to call their own.\nEven in the presence of friends, a half-ogre is quiet and withdrawn, uncomfortable around creatures that talk back. A half-ogre would choose to be out &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunting&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"exploring\"&gt;exploring&lt;/a&gt; a new wilderness rather than take a drink at a bar, and most half-ogres exhibit signs of claustrophobia.\nThe ruling force in life for half-ogres is honor. A half-ogre's word is his life, even among the rare evil half-ogres. Once a half-ogre gives his friendship to a person, that person is a friend for life and the half-ogre will sacrifice himself for those under his protection or those he loves. Most half-ogres honor the vows of another half-ogre, and thus a person who earns the trust of one half-ogre is assured that she has earned the trust of all half-ogres.\nAppearance.\nHalf-ogres are towering creatures who vaguely resemble their orc and ogre parents. They stand as big as a &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 sometimes bigger \u2014 with broad and powerful shoulders, and thick, blunt skulls. Their eyes are small and usually black, while their massive lower jaws bear great tusks. Half-ogre skin tone is a non-metallic gold hue, with varying levels of yellow and red admixture. Most half-ogres are mistaken for small ogres, or rarely, massive orcs.\nCulture.\nFaith.\nAlmost unanimously, half-ogres revere the nature that feeds and protects them. To them, the wild is much safer and more familiar than any civilization. Some of the greatest hunters and druids among the Horde's ranks are half-ogres, who combine both physical and spiritual strength in ways only the tauren can match. Many choose to be &lt;a href=\"Beastmaster\"&gt;Beastmaster&lt;/a&gt;s.\nLanguages.\nHalf-ogres usually speak &lt;a href=\"Low%20Common\"&gt;Low Common&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Common%20%28language%29\"&gt;Common&lt;/a&gt;. Their ogre progenitors used to be part of the Horde, and some learn the languages of other savage creatures.\nNames.\nHalf-ogre names are closer to ogre than orc names. Their first names are almost always single-syllable and guttural. A half-ogre's family name, however, always bears a beast or plant symbol \u2014 which may be the closest to a family that they have. Their surnames reflect their life choices and accomplishments, and the race wears them as badges of honor. Trials of rights are fought over family names, with the victor earning the name and the loser shamed.\nRegion.\nHalf-ogres do not have a region to call their own. Solitary wanderers by nature, half-ogres are found sporadically in most woods in Kalimdor and Eastern Kingdoms. Most are found near major ogre settlements, or former settlements, leftovers from ogre aggressions and old habits of Legion-affiliated orcs.\nThe majority are affiliated with the Horde. While half-ogres prefer animals to people, they realize that they have a greater part to play in the world. Following Rexxar the champion, most living half-ogres offered their assistance to the Horde. Many half-ogres still refuse to officially join the Horde, but &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; knows that he may call upon half-ogres in times of need.\nOther types of half-ogres.\nWhile all half-ogres are of ogre or half-ogre and orc descent in the main series, in the RPG there were other types of half-ogres."}

It most often refers to a half-orc &lt;a href=\"half-human\"&gt;half-human&lt;/a&gt;, but can also be used to refer to a half-orc &lt;a href=\"half-ogre\"&gt;half-ogre&lt;/a&gt;, or half-orc &lt;a href=\"half-draenei\"&gt;half-draenei&lt;/a&gt;. Half-breeds are rare in the \"Warcraft\" universe.\nHalf-orc, half-draenei are reviled and scorned by both draenei and orc cultures. According to &lt;a href=\"Lantresor%20of%20the%20Blade\"&gt;Lantresor of the Blade&lt;/a&gt;, his kind are a rare breed, with most having been killed decades ago. In the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt;, a clan of &lt;a href=\"half-ogre\"&gt;half-ogre&lt;/a&gt; half-orc named, the &lt;a href=\"mok%27nathal\"&gt;mok'nathal&lt;/a&gt;, were considered half-breeds and thus lesser than true orcs.\nHowever, times changed under the &lt;a href=\"New%20Horde\"&gt;New Horde&lt;/a&gt;, and the inclusion of the mok'nathal at the first &lt;a href=\"Kosh%27harg\"&gt;Kosh'harg&lt;/a&gt; festival held on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; could potentially put an end to their isolationist policy in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. According to Garona, being half-blooded used to mark one as an outcast among the orcs, but she then mused that it was now a thing of the past, and that she could possibly join one of the clans.\nHistory.\nAround 99 years before the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Bladewind%20clan\"&gt;Bladewind&lt;/a&gt; orcs began raiding draenei caravans. While many draenei wanted to retaliate, their leader &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt; forbade it. Instead, he allowed the &lt;a href=\"Rangari\"&gt;Rangari&lt;/a&gt; to launch covert missions to rescue prisoners, while future caravans were well guarded, often by squads of &lt;a href=\"Vindicator\"&gt;Vindicator&lt;/a&gt;s. The Rangari managed to save a number of prisoners, but not all. These few poor souls were forced into slavery for the rest of their lives, and some of them bore half-breed children for their masters. Many years later, &lt;a href=\"Garona%20Halforcen\"&gt;Garona Halforcen&lt;/a&gt; was one of the few Bladewind half-breeds who survived past childhood.\n11 years before the opening of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, as the &lt;a href=\"Gorian%20Empire\"&gt;Gorian Empire&lt;/a&gt; was losing power on &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Imperator%20Kelgrok\"&gt;Imperator Kelgrok&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Bladespire%20clan\"&gt;Bladespire clan&lt;/a&gt; decided to make up for the ogres' low numbers, and ordered Bladespire &lt;a href=\"sorcerer\"&gt;sorcerer&lt;/a&gt;s to conduct cruel experiments in order to create new creatures that could be used as labor. The greatest result came from selective breeding between ogres and enslaved orcs, and the children of these forced unions were called &lt;a href=\"mok%27nathal\"&gt;mok'nathal&lt;/a&gt;, possessing the strength of ogres and the intelligence of orcs. The Bladespire kept the half-breeds in chains and bred them together to create even more. To ensure their loyalty, the ogres threatened to kill entire families if even one of the members rebelled. They were later ordered to make war on the orcs of &lt;a href=\"Frostfire%20Ridge\"&gt;Frostfire Ridge&lt;/a&gt;, rampaging the region, and seizing many tracts of resource-rich land. In the meantime, the united &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20clan\"&gt;Frostwolf clan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Whiteclaw%20clan\"&gt;Whiteclaw clan&lt;/a&gt; army fought the Bladespire and managed to capture a number of mok'nathal, including their elder &lt;a href=\"Leoroxx\"&gt;Leoroxx&lt;/a&gt;. After they learned that the mok'nathal were not willing servants but slaves, &lt;a href=\"Garad\"&gt;Garad&lt;/a&gt; and Leoroxx came to an agreement to destroy the Bladespire clan. During the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Bladespire\"&gt;Battle of Bladespire&lt;/a&gt;, Leoroxx had incited rebellion among his kin, and together, both the orcs and mok'nathal drove the ogres out, while Leoroxx strangled Imperator Kelgrok with the chains of his slavery. The orcs and mok'nathal had won but at the cost of many lives. Afterward, Garad offered Leoroxx and his people land in Frostfire, but Leoroxx declined because he knew the half-breeds would never truly be accepted by the orcs. The mok'nathal later settled in a remote corner of &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Gorgrond&lt;/a&gt; to live in peace.\nAfter she met &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;, Garona was bound to his will, and the warlock later began to secretly train her as his personal &lt;a href=\"spy\"&gt;spy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"assassin\"&gt;assassin&lt;/a&gt;. As a half-breed, she lived beneath the notice of most orcs, and those who noticed her saw only a servant of Gul'dan, held on a tight leash. She later became infamous among the humans, being the half-orc assassin of &lt;a href=\"Llane%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Llane Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, although it was not her will.\nAfter the fall of &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; considered annihilating the mok'nathal but stayed his hand. &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt;, son of Leoroxx, had joined the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt; and convinced Blackhand to spare his people. Among the Old Horde forces that invaded &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lantresor%20of%20the%20Blade\"&gt;Lantresor of the Blade&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;a href=\"blademaster\"&gt;blademaster&lt;/a&gt; of half-draenei and half-&lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; descent who served under Warchief Blackhand and Warchief &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt;, before returning home after the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;.\nCharacteristics.\nThe half-orcs possess the traits of both races which they inherit from their parents. However, this is not necessarily always the case, as &lt;a href=\"Lantresor%20of%20the%20Blade\"&gt;Lantresor&lt;/a&gt; looks exactly like an orc, to the point that even the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; could not tell the difference between him and another orc.\nHalf-orc &lt;a href=\"half-draenei\"&gt;half-draenei&lt;/a&gt; may have less-pronounced draenic physical features, such as horns, tails, or hooves. &lt;a href=\"Garona%20Halforcen\"&gt;Garona Halforcen&lt;/a&gt;, and her son &lt;a href=\"Med%27an\"&gt;Med'an&lt;/a&gt;, notably show little draenei features like shiny eyes or chin spines on the latter, instead looking almost entirely orcish. When &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; met Garona for the first time, he immediately recognized her as an orc, but when he compared her to the others, he mentioned that she have a smoother skin, which have a lighter shade of green than the jade flesh of the orcs, her fangs are a bit smaller, her eyes are a bit larger and more expressive, but he could not determine if this was due to her being female or because she was a half-breed. According to Garona herself, the orcs saw her as an inferior being, considering her deformed because of her \"wrong face\", her feet almost like hooves, that she was too slender, too pale, too weak, too ugly, and because she doesn't have enough muscle for a female orc.\nHalf-orc &lt;a href=\"half-ogre\"&gt;half-ogre&lt;/a&gt;s are taller than orcs due to the ogre blood in their veins, they notably average 8' tall for males and 7' for females. They also have a much-developed musculature, such as &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt;, whose half-breed's powerful legs allow him to keep up the pace as he followed his bear Misha on the run, keeping her within his sight.\nIn the RPG.\nBackground.\nSince the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, orcs have interbred with a number of species: mostly humans, but &lt;a href=\"half-ogre\"&gt;half-ogre&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"half-draenei\"&gt;half-draenei&lt;/a&gt; are not unheard of.\n&lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s can interbreed, and in this union create half-orcs. Humans and orcs have been enemies for decades and half-orcs represent something both races prefer not to think about. The half-orcs' genesis is usually the result of rape, and their appearance \u2014 too bestial to be human and too clean to be orc \u2014 reminds the parent races of the rift between them and the horrible deeds each has performed on the other. Thus, most humans and orcs ignore half-orcs. Other races are little better, as the human-orc conflict is only one facet of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; tensions upon which no one likes to dwell. Conversely, some see half-orcs as symbols of unity. Not all half-orcs are born to abused or victimized parents; some are the children of clandestine love. Perhaps half-orcs represent what could be accomplished if the races put aside their differences and lived in peace. After all, if humans and orcs, with their history of hatred and bloodshed and wildly different origins, can produce viable offspring, perhaps the races are not as different as they think.\nHalf-orcs face mixed reactions. Even more so than &lt;a href=\"Half-elf\"&gt;half-elves&lt;/a&gt;, half-orcs are the targets of rage and derision brought about by stress. &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; is a violent place and tensions thrum like taut wires. The &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; lives in recent memory, and most humans and orcs lost loved ones at the hands of the other side. Half-orcs find little welcome, though the situation is better in the larger, more enlightened settlements.\nUnlike half-elves, who prefer to wander or blend in to avoid prejudice, half-orcs are vocal, daring, and foolishly brave. A product of their parent races' pride, courage, and ferocity, half-orcs refuse to accept bias lightly. They demand attention. Half-orcs commit to audacious dares and acts of suicidal bravery to prove their worth to their parent races. Occasionally they succeed.\nAppearance.\nHalf-orcs are a bit taller and heavier than humans, standing around 6-1/2 feet in height and weighing 200 to 250 pounds. Males are noticeably taller and heavier than females. Half-orc skin ranges from light green to grayish brown; half-orc hair is coarse like an orc's and ranges from brown to black in color. The orc lineage is unmistakable, but half-orc features are not as pronounced as those of the orc parent. A half-orc's ears are not quite as large, the nose not as piggish, and the tusks just far less. Both humans and orcs view half-orcs as physically ugly, a view which infects some half-orcs with self-loathing. Half-orcs live longer than their orc parents, with life spans equivalent to a human's.\nIt appears orc traits are generally dominant when it comes to interracial breeds as evidenced by &lt;a href=\"Mok%27nathal\"&gt;Mok'nathal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Half-draenei\"&gt;Half-draenei&lt;/a&gt;, and Orc/Human hybrids.\nCulture.\nLanguages.\nHalf-orcs normally speak &lt;a href=\"Common%20%28language%29\"&gt;Common&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Orcish%20%28language%29\"&gt;Orcish&lt;/a&gt;. Half-orcs learn many languages, like their human parents.\nNames.\nHalf-orcs take the naming practices of the race in which they were raised. Half-orcs raised in human lands often take orc first names to display their heritage and vice versa.\nFaith.\nSince many half-orcs belong to the Horde, they study the &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;anistic practices of their orc forebears. They find the spirits more accepting then any race in society or in the physical plane for that matter. Half-orcs also curious about the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;, and those raised among humans may follow this philosophy.\nPerspective.\nHalf-orcs, because of their mixed-breed nature, have an outsider's perspective on events; it seems unlikely that they will see things from the inside any time soon. Their unfortunate status as human-orc crossbreeds leaves them truly belonging to neither race, and forces them to find their own places in (usually) the Horde or (more rarely) the Alliance.\nRegion.\nIf raised by humans, a half-orc most likely makes &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; his home. If raised by orcs, he probably comes from the city of &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Lands%20of%20Conflict\"&gt;Lands of Conflict&lt;/a&gt;\" mentions that about 3% of the population of &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt; is half-orc (human/orc). This means that there are roughly 450 half-orcs in the area.\nHalf-orcs of ogre descent, the mok'nathal live in the &lt;a href=\"Mok%27Nathal%20Village\"&gt;Mok'Nathal Village&lt;/a&gt; in Outland.\nOther types of half-orcs.\nThe term half-orc is usually used to describe the union between a human and an orc, however, there are other half-orc hybrids:\nIt appears that what half a character is called at any given time depends on which heritage is being focused on, as is the case of Rexxar and Garona being called \"half-orcs\" at times.\nInspiration.\nTraditionally, in classic fantasy settings such as the works of and later in , a half-orc by definition means an offspring that includes an orc and a human parent.\nThis traditional view was used when \"\" was released, &lt;a href=\"Garona%20Halforcen\"&gt;Garona Halforcen&lt;/a&gt; stating in her own words that she was the product of an and human (or &lt;a href=\"near-human\"&gt;near-human&lt;/a&gt;) union. It was later explained that Garona was a &lt;a href=\"half-orc\"&gt;half-orc&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"half-draenei\"&gt;half-draenei&lt;/a&gt;, as &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; deceived her into believing that she was &lt;a href=\"half-human\"&gt;half-human&lt;/a&gt;."}

It is also the headquarters of the &lt;a href=\"Tillers\"&gt;Tillers&lt;/a&gt;, a faction dedicated to farming. The outskirts of the town near the bottom of the hill hold granaries, a boat builder's workshop, &lt;a href=\"Sunsong%20Ranch\"&gt;Sunsong Ranch&lt;/a&gt;, and the all-important &lt;a href=\"Halfhill%20Market\"&gt;Halfhill Market&lt;/a&gt;. The town's tavern, the &lt;a href=\"Lazy%20Turnip\"&gt;Lazy Turnip&lt;/a&gt;, lies about halfway up the hill, next to a flattened plaza. The upper levels of the hill hold several more houses.

The peak of the hill is partially hollow and used as a storage facility for historical records and seeds. This storage area is accessible through a cave entrance, next to the headquarters.\nThe town has had many visitors pass through from far away locales, often stopping by the marketplace. Farmers bring their wheat to Halfhill to be processed and distributed to breweries, traded, or made into food.\nHalfhill is bordered clockwise from the north by the &lt;a href=\"Verdant%20Belt\"&gt;Verdant Belt&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Gilded%20Fan\"&gt;Gilded Fan&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Gilding%20Stream\"&gt;Gilding Stream&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Granary\"&gt;Imperial Granary&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Heartland\"&gt;Heartland&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce, the citizens of Halfhill defeat attacking &lt;a href=\"hozen\"&gt;hozen&lt;/a&gt; by flinging the hozen's excrement back at them.

Halford and his partner &lt;a href=\"Cox\"&gt;Cox&lt;/a&gt; were investigating the murders made by the so-called &lt;a href=\"Starlight%20Slasher\"&gt;Starlight Slasher&lt;/a&gt;, but in the process, he found something he did not expect: the &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nChildhood.\nHalford Ramsey had an older sister named Ana, who he admired as beautiful smart and courageous, and who lived in a house in the &lt;a href=\"Blackwald\"&gt;Blackwald&lt;/a&gt; with her two sons. During the &lt;a href=\"Northgate%20Rebellion\"&gt;Northgate Rebellion&lt;/a&gt;, she offered safe harbor to &lt;a href=\"Darius%20Crowley\"&gt;Crowley's&lt;/a&gt; rebel soldiers and sent her own sons off to war, only to see them returned to her in pine boxes. Struck with grief, Ana committed suicide, and young Halford found her later hanging in the barn. Halford cursed his sister for leaving him behind, seeing her as selfish, cowardly, and stupid for taking the path of least resistance. A grudge he held long into adulthood, becoming a hardhearted detective.\nDay one.\nFour days before the attack, Halford Ramsey, along with partner Cox, questioned &lt;a href=\"Maxwell%20Wiggins\"&gt;Maxwell Wiggins&lt;/a&gt;, the owner of a newspaper, who Halford believed to be a member of the &lt;a href=\"Wolf%20Cult\"&gt;Wolf Cult&lt;/a&gt;. During the interrogation, one guard alerted the detectives about a new victim.\nAs Halford analyzed the body, Cox was angered by little respect toward the dead, angered further when Halford tried to interrogate the young son of the victim without success or remorse. Cox confronted him and mentioned the suicide of his sister, and the two exchange blows. Halford did not apologize and instead explained his findings to Cox, which lead the two to a nearby antique shop.\nBoth burst into the store and found four men performing a ritual. The suspects fled, pursued by the detective on horseback to the &lt;a href=\"Blackwald\"&gt;Blackwald&lt;/a&gt;, where one of the suspects turned into a worgen and bit him. He awoke in a candlelit building to find he had been given the &lt;a href=\"worgen%20curse\"&gt;worgen curse&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Alpha%20Prime\"&gt;Alpha Prime&lt;/a&gt; had abducted him, but claimed the man was a guest and could leave at any time, and gave him a copy of Purity of Essence. While Halford was racked with pain in his head and shoulder, the worgen leader proceeded to retell the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Satyr\"&gt;War of the Satyr&lt;/a&gt; from his point of view. Eager to gain more evidence of the Wolf Cult, and racked with pains, Halford stayed and listened, dubious of every word.\nDay two.\nThree days before the attack, Cox reported to Genn Greymane, who mourned the disappearance of the nation's best investigator. In the Blackwald, Halford continued to fight the worgen curse slowly gripping his mind and body, while Alpha Prime spoke of the &lt;a href=\"Pack%20form\"&gt;Pack Form&lt;/a&gt;.\nDay three.\nTwo days before the attack, Halford had spent three days fighting the worgen curse. His clothes were torn, his eyes bloodshot, his body starving, and his wound healing. The more Halford fought the curse, the more difficult the transformation would be. Hours of pain had exacted a heavy toll, numbness taking over, pervading the detective to the very core. His prized intellect had crumbled. Alpha Prime offered food and claimed Halford's transformation was near. Alpha Prime left to attend a meeting with a room full of his human followers, and Halford followed, witnessing the cult leader bite an aspirant on the shoulder. Horrified, Halford ran panicked into the Blackwald, where he found Ana's old house. Discovering again the barn where he found her, memories inspired great emotion and was overcome by the worgen curse.\nDay four.\nOne day before the attack, Halford ran wild through the Blackwald as he enjoyed the speed, agility, and heightened senses of the worgen form. His blood sang, and he had never known such strength, speed, and vigor. He noted his heightened senses, including that of scent, and able to see as never before, clearer than he had ever dreamed possible. Instinct and fury warred within him, but were calmed when he encountered flowers near &lt;a href=\"Tal%27doren\"&gt;a large tree&lt;/a&gt;, where he also saw two &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;strange figures&lt;/a&gt;. A shift in the wind brought the scent of blood to his attention, and the excited worgen rushed towards the source.\nHalford followed the scent of blood and the urge to feast, he found himself in &lt;a href=\"Stormglen\"&gt;Stormglen&lt;/a&gt;, which had been attacked by the cult. He was overcome by his blood lust, and killed a tied up sheep to eat. Two worgen appeared behind him and though his instinct was to defend his kill, he saved one leg and tossed the rest to the two worgen. They fought amongst themselves for it instead of attacking him. As he walked through the deserted town, he met with Alpha Prime once more who was impressed by his display of logic and self-discipline, even as a worgen. As they walked, Alpha Prime told him the origins of the &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Scythe\"&gt;Druids of the Scythe&lt;/a&gt; and the worgen. Alpha Prime attempted to recruit Halford into the Wolf Cult, but he declined the offer. Nevertheless, Alpha Prime gave him an ultimatum to join the cult or be denied their \"blessing\" and that his answer had to be given by midday.\nHalford spent the night in the &lt;a href=\"Blackwald\"&gt;Blackwald&lt;/a&gt;, reading the \"&lt;a href=\"Purity%20of%20Essence\"&gt;Purity of Essence&lt;/a&gt;\": a manifesto by Alpha Prime. Unable to think clearly, he returned to the tree in the Blackwald that had calmed his mind. With no elves in sight, he sat down to read again. Now with his detective's intellect refocused, he realized that the book was from Wiggins' printing press, deduced that Alpha Prime and his Wolf Cult were responsible for the Starlight Slasher murders, had attacked and turned the people of Stormglen, and were planning to attack &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20City\"&gt;Gilneas City&lt;/a&gt; with a worgen army so that they could spread the worgen curse.\nDay five.\nHalford remembered Alpha Prime's words from the day before, and rushed to Gilneas. Though he was struggling with the bloodthirsty and savage nature of his worgen form, Halford was able to make it to Gilneas City and saved a woman and her young son from two worgen, though he had to fight off the worgen instinct to attack and eat them afterward. He also rescued &lt;a href=\"Belysra\"&gt;Belysra&lt;/a&gt;, who also happened to be there and was about to be killed by Alpha Prime. Alpha Prime and Halford fought for a while but before Alpha Prime could land a fatal blow, Belysra used a prayer to Elune to blast him into the moat. The two then escaped into the Southwest Gate while being pursued by a horde of worgen. Belysra again prayed to Elune to blast the horde of worgen as they were crossing the bridge. They then encountered &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Vincent%20Godfrey\"&gt;Lord Vincent Godfrey&lt;/a&gt; and a contingent of Gilnean soldiers. Though they declared to them that they were non-hostile, Halford was shot by Godfrey who showed nothing but disdain for his kind and left Belysra behind simply because she wasn't a human.\nAttack on Duskhaven.\nDays later, the Gilnean human refugees had fled to Duskhaven. Gilneans that had been bitten in the worgen attack either joined the cult, were caught by the humans in Duskhaven, joined Belysra at Tal'doren, or held up in Stormglen. Belysra took Halford to Tal'doren and was able to get the bullet out and Halford was able to survive. Halford awoke and learned of the Wolf Cult occupying the city, and the tremors making an already terrible situation worse. Halford was speaking with Belysra under Tal'doren when two more elves - Talran and Valorn - arrived with the Scythe of Elune, which had been &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Riders%20%28comic%29\"&gt;liberated&lt;/a&gt; from the worgen of &lt;a href=\"Duskwood\"&gt;Duskwood&lt;/a&gt; mere days before, and had used secret tunnels under the Greymane wall to enter the city. Halford recognized the mud on their robes, and realized Alpha Prime had been using the tunnels as well to speak with the Forsaken. Halford deduced that the worgen attack on Gilneas City and the recent &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Gilneas\"&gt;Forsaken invasion&lt;/a&gt; were no coincidence and that the two parties were in league with one another.\nAs the worgen detective debated strategy with Belysra, he encountered &lt;a href=\"Darius%20Crowley\"&gt;Darius Crowley&lt;/a&gt;, one of many Gilneans that Belysra and her night elves had been trying to help with their worgen affliction. Halford still thought of Darius as a rebel and a traitor - and responsible for the death of his sister - and attacked. The fight was broken up by Belysra who reminded them that past disputes didn't matter anymore and that they needed to put it behind them in order to preserve the future of Gilneas. Both agreed to put the past behind them and work together to capture feral worgen and make them sane again, thus building a worgen army to combat Alpha Prime's Wolf Cult and eventually, the Wolf Cult's &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; allies.\nWhile the Gilneans in Duskhaven were beset by the Forsaken, and Crowley recruited the worgen of Stormglen, Halford was shown how to control his worgen side. Halford agreed to undergo the night elf ceremony of balance, which forced him to confront his doubts and fears. Given the extent of his difficulties, he was indisposed for some time as he experienced visions of Ana, who urged him to forgive her and to move on. He did, and awoke in his human form. At last, Halford was able to bring balance to his human and worgen forms.\nThe unseen fight.\nWhile Halford was indisposed, &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; had met with Darius at Tal'doren. Both revealed themselves as worgen, the two lords worked together to unite Gilneas against the Forsaken invasion. Darius stayed behind in Tal'doren, while Greymane set off to meet survivors in &lt;a href=\"Tempest%27s%20Reach\"&gt;Tempest's Reach&lt;/a&gt;; a trap set by &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Godfrey\"&gt;Lord Godfrey&lt;/a&gt;. While Greymane was away, Halford, &lt;a href=\"Belrysa%20Starbreeze\"&gt;Belrysa Starbreeze&lt;/a&gt;, Crowley, and his Gilnean worgen were confronted by Alpha Prime, his worgen followers, and the Forsaken at &lt;a href=\"Tal%27doren\"&gt;Tal'doren&lt;/a&gt;. Belrysa attempted to use the &lt;a href=\"Scythe%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Scythe of Elune&lt;/a&gt; to seal away Alpha Prime and his Wolf Cult beneath &lt;a href=\"Daral%27nir\"&gt;Daral'nir&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;, but before she could do so, a &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"dark%20ranger\"&gt;dark ranger&lt;/a&gt; shot her in the arm. This caused her to drop the &lt;a href=\"Scythe%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Scythe of Elune&lt;/a&gt;, and Alpha Prime signaled for the army of Wolf Cult worgen and Forsaken to surround them. Halford took worgen form and attacked Alpha Prime, who told Halford he had chosen the wrong side. Alpha Prime took possession of the scythe, but just as he was about to finish Belysra off with it, the &lt;a href=\"spirit%20wolf\"&gt;spirit wolf&lt;/a&gt; of Belysra's old lover \u2014 \u2014 killed Alpha Prime. With the death of their leader, the &lt;a href=\"Wolf%20Cult\"&gt;Wolf Cult&lt;/a&gt; scattered; leaving the Forsaken without their lupine allies and open to attack from the night elves and Gilneans.\nHalford was last seen watching Genn reveal the truth about himself to his people and uniting the Gilneans, both human and worgen, for the &lt;a href=\"The%20Battle%20for%20Gilneas%20City\"&gt;Battle for Gilneas City&lt;/a&gt;. He contemplated that it was truly ironic that he had to become a beast in order to find his humanity. It certainly lacked logic, but as he learned in his adventure, much of what is important in life does exactly that.\nRelatives.\nHe may be related to &lt;a href=\"Barrett%20Ramsey\"&gt;Barrett Ramsey&lt;/a&gt;."}

As their High Commander, he led this elite special ops regiment composed of veterans in many battles, bringing victory to the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; on numerous occasions, including the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Battle of Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; at the time of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"War%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;War against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, he led the 7th Legion from &lt;a href=\"Wintergarde%20Keep\"&gt;Wintergarde Keep&lt;/a&gt;, a major &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; base in the &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt;. Following the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, he led his soldiers to Gilneas in order to reclaim the ruined kingdom from the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;. At the time of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, he led the 7th Legion's might against the Horde from the &lt;a href=\"Wind%27s%20Redemption\"&gt;Wind's Redemption&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, Halford Wyrmbane served as a &lt;a href=\"knight\"&gt;knight&lt;/a&gt; during the founding of the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Order of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;. Believing priestly orders couldn't mix with martial skills, he continued to focus only on combat training. After observing the first &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s, however, Wyrmbane became inspired by the faith and dedication of &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt;. When the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Expedition\"&gt;Alliance Expedition&lt;/a&gt; was presumed lost following the &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Invasion of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, Wyrmbane realized that &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s could also be devout followers of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;. Wyrmbane vowed to honor Turalyon's sacrifice by being both a soldier and a paladin, and later joined the ranks of the Knights of the Silver Hand.\nAt some point, he became the leader of the 7th Legion and had led his troops in crucial wars throughout recent times, timing back from the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Battle of Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, and continues to lead the 7th Legion to this day.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, Halford commanded the 7th Legion forces from &lt;a href=\"Wintergarde%20Keep\"&gt;Wintergarde Keep&lt;/a&gt;, who served as their headquarters and the main &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; base on the eastern borders of &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt some point during his campaign, he discovered the spies of the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Cult of the Damned&lt;/a&gt; among his troops, and hanged them at the entrance of the keep to serve as ghoul baits. When &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s were sent to warn him about the traitors, he announced their grim fate, before explaining the situation of the arrival of &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt; sent by the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; in response to a crushing assault led by &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Lord Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Angrathar%20the%20Wrathgate\"&gt;Angrathar the Wrathgate&lt;/a&gt;. He then directed the adventurers into freeing trapped villagers from &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;-occupied town center.\nOnce the citizens were rescued and back to work, Wyrmbane sent the Alliance heroes to meet &lt;a href=\"Cavalier%20Durkon\"&gt;Cavalier Durkon&lt;/a&gt;, one of his soldiers he had sent to investigate the town's crypt, as the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; who keep attacking the keep come from the ruins of Wintergarde and the town's crypt where the Scourge managed to send a necrolord. After the necrolord was eliminated and its tome returned to the High Commander, the latter redirected the adventurers to &lt;a href=\"Inquisitor%20Hallard\"&gt;Inquisitor Hallard&lt;/a&gt; in order to interrogate &lt;a href=\"Mayor%20Godfrey%20Goodard\"&gt;Mayor Godfrey Goodard&lt;/a&gt;, now a ghoul in the service of the Scourge, so that he could reveal his masters' plans and the content in the book. Having thus learned for the existence of the &lt;a href=\"Wintergarde%20Mausoleum\"&gt;Wintergarde Mausoleum&lt;/a&gt;, he dispatched &lt;a href=\"Duke%20August%20Foehammer\"&gt;Duke August Foehammer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ambo%20Cash\"&gt;Ambo Cash&lt;/a&gt; to the front lines in preparation for their next assault, and sent the adventurers to clear the &lt;a href=\"Wintergarde%20Mine\"&gt;Wintergarde Mine&lt;/a&gt;. He later thanked the adventurers for their efforts against the Scourge and helping to boost the morale of the troops, before sending them to report to Duke August Foehammer at &lt;a href=\"Thorson%27s%20Post\"&gt;Thorson's Post&lt;/a&gt;, in order to continue the offensive against the undead under the command of a &lt;a href=\"lich\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt;.\nHaving learned of the existence of a book called &lt;a href=\"The%20Path%20of%20Redemption%20%28Updated%20version%29\"&gt;The Path of Redemption (Updated version)&lt;/a&gt;, a journal that holds the prophetic ramblings of &lt;a href=\"Brigitte%20Abbendis\"&gt;High General Abbendis&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Onslaught\"&gt;Scarlet Onslaught&lt;/a&gt;, but also the motivations and goals of the Scarlet zealots, he accordingly requested a copy of the book from the &lt;a href=\"Onslaught%20Base%20Camp\"&gt;Onslaught Base Camp&lt;/a&gt;. Once in possession of it, he wondered about the sanity of Abbendis who said to heard the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; speak to her, but that despite her ramblings, the book gave them a glimpse of the mind of the Scarlet zealots, and that Lord Bolvar would be pleased.\nAfter coming into possession of the phylactery of the lich, Halford sent his men to accompany the adventurers and &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Lord Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; to defeat &lt;a href=\"Thel%27zan%20the%20Duskbringer\"&gt;Thel'zan the Duskbringer&lt;/a&gt;, formerly known as the treacherous &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Inigo%20Montoy\"&gt;Inigo Montoy&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Brotherhood%20of%20Light\"&gt;Brotherhood of Light&lt;/a&gt; who was responsible for stealing the &lt;a href=\"phylactery\"&gt;phylactery&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt;, which \u2014 as it was not destroyed \u2014 allowed the Archlich to regain corporeal form.\nFollowing the destruction of Thel'zan, Wyrmbane thanked the adventurers for saving Wintergarde, and also for restoring faith to Alliance forces in the region. He sent them to join the rest of their force at the Wrathgate with a special commendation, only given to those that have gone above and beyond the call of duty in the name of the Alliance.\nHe is later seen on the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Conquest\"&gt;Isle of Conquest&lt;/a&gt; battling against the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, being opposed to &lt;a href=\"Overlord%20Agmar\"&gt;Overlord Agmar&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron\"&gt;Kor'kron&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, Halford Wyrmbane led the 7th Legion forces into the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Gilneas\"&gt;Ruins of Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;, supporting the &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20Liberation%20Front\"&gt;Gilneas Liberation Front&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; in order to regain the kingdom for the Alliance. He ordered &lt;a href=\"Master%20Sergeant%20Pietro%20Zaren\"&gt;Master Sergeant Pietro Zaren&lt;/a&gt; to take and hold the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20Quarter\"&gt;Cathedral Quarter&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20City\"&gt;Gilneas City&lt;/a&gt;, and then work with &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Darius%20Crowley\"&gt;Lord Darius Crowley&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; in order to advance into enemy territories, and thus destroy their outposts and lines of communication.\nHis plan was to allow troops to attack the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken%20Forward%20Command\"&gt;Forsaken Forward Command&lt;/a&gt;, once the &lt;a href=\"King%20Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;'s armada of warships arrives on the shores of the kingdom. He also mentions that once Gilneas was secured, the Alliance would prepare to retake &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. He was later present on the deck of the &lt;a href=\"X-2%20Pincer\"&gt;X-2 Pincer&lt;/a&gt; submarine when the rest of the fleet arrived.\nFor the rest of the campaign, Halford Wyrmbane was more than likely at the head of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; forces in the region.\nLegion.\nDuring the events of Legion, Halford Wyrmbane appears when an Alliance player reaches Prestige rank 2, alongside several other wartime leaders of the Alliance. There, he can be found among the procession using a sword similar to that of &lt;a href=\"Admiral%20Taylor%27s%20Greatsword\"&gt;Admiral Taylor's Greatsword&lt;/a&gt;.\nLearning that Turalyon was alive, how the Light had sustained and transformed him, and witnessing his return to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; only strengthened Wyrmbane's resolve and devotion, feeling that his faith and his choice to become a paladin had been well placed all those years ago.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nHalford Wyrmbane greets heroes recently returned from the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Battle for Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Harbor\"&gt;Stormwind Harbor&lt;/a&gt;. He expresses melancholy over the number of Alliance soldiers lost in the fight.\nOn King &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;'s orders, the 7th Legion traveled to &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; to ensure that &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;'s mission of getting the Kul Tirans to rejoin the Alliance succeeded. Halford can be found aboard the \"&lt;a href=\"Wind%27s%20Redemption\"&gt;Wind's Redemption&lt;/a&gt;\" docked at &lt;a href=\"Boralus\"&gt;Boralus&lt;/a&gt;, where on orders from Anduin he directs the Alliance's operations to secure their position on &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt; and Kul Tiras. Once footholds are secured, he co-leads the Alliance's war effort on Zandalar alongside &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt;.\nA version of Halford appears in the &lt;a href=\"Vision%20of%20Stormwind\"&gt;Vision of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"alternate%20timeline\"&gt;alternate timeline&lt;/a&gt; where &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt; takes over Stormwind. He had been captured by &lt;a href=\"Inquisitor%20Darkspeak\"&gt;Inquisitor Darkspeak&lt;/a&gt; who attempted to break his mind and make him submit to the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;, but Halford refused to abandon the Light. Despite the adventurer slaying Halford's captor, his wounds proved too much and he died soon after, urging the adventurer to save the civilians of Stormwind with his last breath.\nQuotes.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nGossip.\nThe campaign proceeds apace, &lt;name&gt;.
