{"id": "36239", "revid": "3154973", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=36239", "title": "Argus", "text": "Argus is the original &lt;a href=\"world\"&gt;homeworld&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"eredar\"&gt;eredar&lt;/a&gt;, now located within the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;. It was once described as a utopian world whose inhabitants were both vastly intelligent and highly gifted in magic. It has since been twisted by &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic, chaotic energies and became the stronghold and homeworld of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nArgus is a no-fly zone, similar to the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Isle of Thunder&lt;/a&gt;. It is navigated with the \"&lt;a href=\"Vindicaar\"&gt;Vindicaar&lt;/a&gt;\"'s console. It features two instances, the &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20the%20Triumvirate%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Seat of the Triumvirate&lt;/a&gt; dungeon and the &lt;a href=\"Antorus%2C%20the%20Burning%20Throne\"&gt;Antorus, the Burning Throne&lt;/a&gt; raid.\nHistory.\nLike &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, Argus contains the &lt;a href=\"world-soul\"&gt;world-soul&lt;/a&gt; of a dormant &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;. The planet was abundant with a mineral called &lt;a href=\"argunite\"&gt;argunite&lt;/a&gt;, the magical properties of which helped the &lt;a href=\"eredar\"&gt;eredar&lt;/a&gt; civilization thrive.\nArgus was once ruled by the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Duumvirate\"&gt;Second Duumvirate&lt;/a&gt;, consisting of &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;. During this time, the sorcerer &lt;a href=\"Thal%27kiel\"&gt;Thal'kiel&lt;/a&gt; and his order of eredar &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s, the &lt;a href=\"Wakeners\"&gt;Wakeners&lt;/a&gt;, began using summoning magics to conjure &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s from the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;. Velen condemned Thal'kiel's new summonings and ordered him never to conjure them again. However, with the support of these entities, Thal'kiel hoped to become the sole ruler of Argus. His trusted apprentice, &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt;, informed Velen and Kil'jaeden of the planned coup. Archimonde was placed in charge of the attack on the Wakeners' hidden stronghold and decapitated his former master himself. Archimonde would later rise to rule Argus alongside Velen and Kil'jaeden, and the three eredar wisely ruled the planet for many years. &lt;a href=\"Eredath\"&gt;Eredath&lt;/a&gt; was the most sacred of the cities on Argus.\nEventually, Argus attracted the attention of &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;. He offered the eredar a deal: in exchange for their loyalty, he would give them power undreamed of by all races. Kil'jaeden and Archimonde were quick to accept the offer, but Velen had a vision of the future: the eredar would be transformed into &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s under the rule of Sargeras. His advice to Kil'jaeden and Archimonde went unheeded, and he desperately sought a solution to this dilemma. &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Nath%27raxas\"&gt;Lord Nath'raxas&lt;/a&gt; played a role in delivering Argus to Sargeras.\nEventually, Velen was contacted by a race of divine energy beings called the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt;, and he fled with his followers, renaming his people the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;, or \"exiled ones\", while Kil'jaeden, Archimonde and the rest of the eredar became the feared, insidious sorcerers and tacticians of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. As the draenei fled, the world was devoured by the Legion. After Argus fell, Sargeras ordered a temple of darkness to be built deep within the planet's core. Little is known of it, for only the titan's most devoted acolytes are given sigils that permit entrance. This might be the titanic structures that &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; buried deep within a canyon.\nFollowing the death of , ' personal hound, the &lt;a href=\"Nathrezim\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mephistroth\"&gt;Mephistroth&lt;/a&gt; believed that Goremaw could still serve the Legion. He extracted the felhound's fangs and took them to a great demon forge on the eredar homeworld of Argus. There were many challenges in preserving the fangs' dark energies. Mephistroth dared not handle the task himself. His subordinates were eager to distinguish themselves, even at great risk. But the fangs' twisted power often proved too dangerous. When it pierced their minds and inflicted unspeakable agony, the dreadlord simply discarded them, giving their souls to the demon forge and finding another servant to take their place. But in the end, their work was successful. The fangs had been sharpened to a permanent edge, their shadow powers preserved for all time. Mephistroth had created the &lt;a href=\"Fangs%20of%20the%20Devourer\"&gt;Fangs of the Devourer&lt;/a&gt;, two of the deadliest weapons the universe had ever known. He presented the daggers to Sargeras, who was greatly pleased. Goremaw had been a terror on the battlefield; in the hands of a skilled assassin, its fangs would be a terror in the shadows.\nLater, Sargeras found an eredar &lt;a href=\"tracker\"&gt;tracker&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Akaari%20Shadowgore\"&gt;Akaari&lt;/a&gt; who has proven to be worthy to wield the fangs. She was summoned to Argus and was promised to become a fearsome instrument of death, one of the deadliest creatures alive in any known realm. Akaari would need to give up her will, but she accepted. Afterward, Akaari spent centuries in secret chambers beneath the surface of Argus, where weapons were forged and wills were broken. Her essence was shaped and molded as well, intertwined with the daggers' power. The souls of other eredar assassins were sacrificed and bound to hers, granting her the experience of a hundred lifetimes and thousands of kills. When she emerged from those chambers, she did so as a remorseless construct of death, perfectly obedient to Sargeras.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nArgus has since become the stronghold of the Burning Legion, where &lt;a href=\"Azzakel\"&gt;Azzakel&lt;/a&gt; waits for an opportunity to invade other worlds. A portal was open from Argus to but was quickly closed by the planet's defenders.\nIt was also revealed that the eredar had rewritten Argus' history books to paint Velen as a traitor.\nLegion.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Exodar\"&gt;Battle for the Exodar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt; ordered the &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Chosen\"&gt;Light's Chosen&lt;/a&gt; to make the necessary preparations for their new vessel, the \"&lt;a href=\"Vindicaar\"&gt;Vindicaar&lt;/a&gt;\", to return to Argus.\nAfter defeating Kil'jaeden in the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; uses the &lt;a href=\"Sargerite%20Keystone\"&gt;Sargerite Keystone&lt;/a&gt; to open a rift between Argus and Azeroth, making Argus visible in Azeroth's sky. This made many of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;'s citizens worried, especially as &lt;a href=\"Validated%20Doomsayer\"&gt;doomsayers&lt;/a&gt; started to spread panic.\nAs Kil'jaeden died in an explosion aboard his ship near Argus, the ship crashed into the world, uncovering a cave network rich with minerals in &lt;a href=\"Krokuun\"&gt;Krokuun&lt;/a&gt;.\nReturn to Argus.\nAs the Legion's homeworld, Argus is hostile territory. Demons patrol every crag of Argus's shattered surface, and sometimes it seems as if the planet itself is out to get you.\nAt some point, the Burning Legion started torturing Argus' world-soul, called &lt;a href=\"Argus%20%28titan%29\"&gt;Argus the Unmaker&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; states the Legion harnessed his power to endlessly regenerate inside the Twisting Nether.\nOn the first return to the homeworld since the evacuation on the \"Genedar\", many draenei expressed shock, dismay, and sadness at witnessing what the Legion had wrought on the planet over the thousands of years in their absence. Though they do consider it the home they came from, it is clearly no longer feasible to think of resettling it, even if the Legion is defeated. Several, including Velen, have stated that they even look forward to leaving the shattered world behind. Only the &lt;a href=\"Krokul\"&gt;Krokul&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Argussian%20Reach\"&gt;Argussian Reach&lt;/a&gt; have expressed any desire to take back the planet.\nGeography.\nBefore the Legion.\nArgus contained various different terrain types. &lt;a href=\"Wintergrasp\"&gt;Wintergrasp&lt;/a&gt; and its chill reminded &lt;a href=\"Anchorite%20Tessa\"&gt;Anchorite Tessa&lt;/a&gt; of the stormy peaks of &lt;a href=\"Kaarinos\"&gt;Kaarinos&lt;/a&gt;. It also had deserts, forests, lush plains, frozen tundras, and other environs.\nEredath was the most sacred of the eredar's cities. According to &lt;a href=\"Maatparm\"&gt;Maatparm&lt;/a&gt;, its walkways were lined with precious minerals and the rivers glittered even in complete darkness. Eredath has also been described as having purple hills. &lt;a href=\"The%20Last%20Relic%20of%20Argus\"&gt;The Last Relic of Argus&lt;/a&gt; holds the inscription: \"I long for Eredath\". The city now floats above the planet and has mostly escaped fel corruption, giving something of an insight into what Argus was like before its corruption.\nCapital of the Burning Legion.\nArgus is saturated with the &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; energies of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. It is now bisected by a massive, hellish slash in the crust of the planet itself, where a portion of the planet has been blown into orbit. &lt;a href=\"Krokuun\"&gt;Krokuun&lt;/a&gt; lies on the edge of this rift, one of the removed portions is the city of &lt;a href=\"Eredath\"&gt;Eredath&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Antoran%20Wastes\"&gt;Antoran Wastes&lt;/a&gt; lie inside of the rift on a cliff above the core of the world.\nThe area of Argus that &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; visited during the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt; was once a beautiful place of crystalline mountains and shimmering seas, but is now cold and cruel with a sense of corruption and loss. Jagged crystal mountains hold festering corruption within that cause them to crumble, and dust devils born of the powdered gems screech down canyons of serrated rock which refract light everywhere. There is a city which looms over canyons of fractured crystal and is laid out according to complex geomantic rules. The buildings resemble those of the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; but far more grandiose. The buildings in fact act as huge machines for focusing magic: they once provided harmony and health to an entire world, but now instead create a cloud of fear and despair. At the center of the city is a mighty palace that is home to &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;. Within the palace's crystal corridors are runes which fill the mind with despair, visions of conquest, and a rage to end all things: the creed of the Burning Legion, written in fire.\nBelow the surface of Argus, there are many dark and secret chambers where weapons are forged and wills are broken. The assassin &lt;a href=\"Akaari%20Shadowgore\"&gt;Akaari Shadowgore&lt;/a&gt; spent centuries in these chambers, her essence being shaped, molded and intertwined with the power of her dreaded daggers, the &lt;a href=\"Fangs%20of%20the%20Devourer\"&gt;Fangs of the Devourer&lt;/a&gt;. The souls of other eredar assassins were sacrificed and bound to hers, granting her the experience of a hundred lifetimes and thousands of kills.\nLocation.\nArgus was originally a world of the Great Dark Beyond.\nThe \"\" novel stated that Argus is now \"located on the brink between the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;Great Dark Beyond&lt;/a&gt;\". \"&lt;a href=\"A%20Thousand%20Years%20of%20War\"&gt;A Thousand Years of War&lt;/a&gt;\", however, stated that \"Argus was within the Twisting Nether\" and \"fully shrouded within the Nether\".\nIt thus appears to be a situation similar to &lt;a href=\"Mardum\"&gt;Mardum&lt;/a&gt;, which was situated within the Nether but slowly started to appear in the Great Dark Beyond as well as its &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; energies tore the veil between the two realms down, but in reverse: Argus was in the Great Dark Beyond but as it was engulfed in fel, it has fully become part of the Twisting Nether.\nIn World of Warcraft.\nArgus could possibly be seen during the fight with &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;alternate Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; through a gigantic rift from which Gul'dan planned to summon in the Lord of the Legion, &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden%20%28Tomb%20of%20Sargeras%20tactics%29\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; fight, his ship appeared into orbit above Argus. After defeating him, Argus could be seen in the sky of many zones on Azeroth in-game. After August 8, 2017, Argus appeared for all players regardless of if they had beaten Kil'jaeden or not. With &lt;a href=\"patch%207.3.0\"&gt;patch 7.3.0&lt;/a&gt; it was added to the sky in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. This was done so it would appear over &lt;a href=\"Azuremyst%20Isle\"&gt;Azuremyst Isle&lt;/a&gt; for the new questline in the patch, and Azuremyst Isle is stored on the Outland \"continent\" in the game files.\nArgus then disappeared from the sky for those completing &lt;a href=\"Antorus%2C%20the%20Burning%20Throne\"&gt;Antorus, the Burning Throne&lt;/a&gt;, replaced by a &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20the%20Pantheon\"&gt;bright star&lt;/a&gt; shining far away in the night. After LFR Wing 4 opened in January 16, 2018, Argus definitively disappeared from the sky for everyone.\nDesign.\nArgus is featured in \"\" &lt;a href=\"patch%207.3.0\"&gt;patch 7.3&lt;/a&gt;, with different regions, quests and instances in addition to a raid and other complementary features. Argus is split into three zones: &lt;a href=\"Krokuun\"&gt;Krokuun&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eredath\"&gt;Eredath&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Antoran%20Wastes\"&gt;Antoran Wastes&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe area was designed with sandbox elements intended to be enjoyed even after you complete the main quest, with gameplay and challenges on the planet's surface reminiscent of past endgame areas such as the &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Front\"&gt;Molten Front&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Isle of Thunder&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Timeless%20Isle\"&gt;Timeless Isle&lt;/a&gt;. Argus is a no-fly zone, and an extensive network of teleportation hubs was added to compensate."}

{"id": "553918", "revid": "40581520", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=553918", "title": "Argus (titan)", "text": "Argus, \"the emerald star\", was a &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"world-soul\"&gt;world-soul&lt;/a&gt; found by &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; when he visited the planet &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt; where the &lt;a href=\"eredar\"&gt;eredar&lt;/a&gt; dwelled. The slumbering titan was tortured beyond redemption by the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; who harnessed his power to fuel the demons' infinite army, allowing them to endlessly and rapidly regenerate in the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;. The Legion's connection to the world-soul had to be severed in order to bring an end to the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt; once and for all. To do this, the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; brought Argus' soul to their &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20the%20Pantheon\"&gt;Seat&lt;/a&gt;, where he was defeated by the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. The titans then used the last of Argus' power to imprison his master &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; forever.\nWhen Argus died, his soul traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;, where it slammed into the &lt;a href=\"Arbiter\"&gt;Arbiter&lt;/a&gt; and disabled her, as the soul of a titan is not intended to be sent there. This was a result of the &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt;, secret agents of &lt;a href=\"Zovaal\"&gt;the Jailer&lt;/a&gt; who had infiltrated the Burning Legion long ago, who convinced Sargeras to let them twist Argus' soul with &lt;a href=\"Death\"&gt;Death&lt;/a&gt; magic in order to power a resurrection engine for his demonic armies. In actuality, the nathrezim had done this in order to turn Argus into a \"death titan\", using its soul as a \"maul with which to crush the Arbiter\" as part of their master's plans. \n&lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28titan%29\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; was described as a \"much more powerful\" world-soul than Argus.\n&lt;a href=\"Argus%20the%20Unmaker\"&gt;Argus the Unmaker&lt;/a&gt; is the final boss of &lt;a href=\"Antorus%2C%20the%20Burning%20Throne\"&gt;Antorus, the Burning Throne&lt;/a&gt; and the final raid encounter of \"\".\nBiography.\nThe broken world.\nLike other world-souls, Argus began his existence as an energy that spun out in the cosmos before settling near a sun. A planet\u2014which also became known as Argus\u2014formed around him, and generations of life lived and died on its surface. The fallen titan &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; eventually found Argus, and entrapped it in a prison of &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Throne\"&gt;Burning Throne&lt;/a&gt;, a titan temple located in the heart of &lt;a href=\"Antorus%2C%20the%20Burning%20Throne\"&gt;Antorus&lt;/a&gt; at the world's core. The world-soul's own memories speak of being \"betrayed\" and \"bound by something powerful\".\nThe &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt;\u2014who were secretly loyal not to Sargeras, but to the &lt;a href=\"Zovaal\"&gt;Jailer&lt;/a&gt; and the force of &lt;a href=\"Death\"&gt;Death&lt;/a&gt;\u2014suggested to Sargeras that they could create a resurrection engine that would allow the Legion's armies to resurrect instantaneously, as he was displeased by the time it took for his demons to naturally regenerate in the Twisting Nether. They would only require the necessary fuel: a world-soul infused with Death magic. In truth, this was part of Zovaal's \"gambit\": by corrupting Argus with Death, the nathrezim ensured that, upon its death, the titan's soul would be sent to the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt; and slam into the &lt;a href=\"Arbiter\"&gt;Arbiter&lt;/a&gt;. As she had been made to judge mortal souls and not something as powerful as \"the mad, hate-filled essence of a broken world\", this would cause her to break down.\nThe process of using his strength to revive fallen demons was extremely painful to the world-soul, but he could do nothing but scream in horror and pain, his only solace laying in his dreams. The corrupted titan &lt;a href=\"Aggramar\"&gt;Aggramar&lt;/a&gt; was stationed to stand guard over the world-soul within the temple, which was considered too sacred for any demons to enter. Argus was vaguely aware of the Legion's &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt; across the cosmos and of their desire to claim the much more powerful world-soul of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28titan%29\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nA Thousand Years of War.\nThe existence of Argus' world-soul was unknown to the &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Army of the Light&lt;/a&gt; before the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Xe%27ra\"&gt;Xe'ra&lt;/a&gt; had a vision of the \"emerald star\" for the first time during the &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Invasion of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, when &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; ventured into &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;; she claimed to have seen the two of them traveling through the cosmos until they reached the emerald star. Xe'ra believed that she had not been meant to see the latter, and it was only there for a flash before disappearing again. She further believed that the Legion was hiding it from prying eyes and that once they reached it, it would be key to finally destroying the Burning Legion. Xe'ra believed that this vision of the emerald star was the reason &lt;a href=\"Eradication%20%28eredar%29\"&gt;Eradication&lt;/a&gt; was sent to assassinate both Turalyon and Alleria. Turalyon would later claim to have seen the emerald star after being Lightforged by Xe'ra, saying their war with the Legion would eventually reveal it to them, and that they needed to be patient.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt;, many of Argus' demonic forces had moved to &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, leaving it undefended enough for Turalyon and Alleria to infiltrate the world. As they approached Antorus, the world-soul noticed their presence and screamed for help. He tried to communicate with Alleria, sending her visions of his prison and, in a single burst, memories of his entire lifetime. Turalyon didn't see the vision but swore to return and free the world-soul from the Legion's clutches. The world-soul's distress alerted the Legion forces on the planet to Alleria and Turalyon's presence, forcing them to retreat.\nLegion.\nWith the arrival of the &lt;a href=\"Armies%20of%20Legionfall\"&gt;Armies of Legionfall&lt;/a&gt; to Argus during the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20Campaign\"&gt;Argus Campaign&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; was able to talk to Argus' titan much like he speaks to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28titan%29\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; thanks to the &lt;a href=\"Sacred%20Stone\"&gt;Sacred Stone&lt;/a&gt; in the possession of the &lt;a href=\"Broken\"&gt;Krokul&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Krokul%20Hovel\"&gt;Krokul Hovel&lt;/a&gt;, revealing the emerald star's nature as a titan to the Army of the Light. Compared to Azeroth, Magni claimed Argus spoke in a tormented and broken voice due to his torture. Magni and an &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;order leader&lt;/a&gt; used the stone to receive visions from Argus, where it revealed to them that &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; sought to resurrect and corrupt the souls of the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; and turn them into his service, with &lt;a href=\"Aggramar\"&gt;Aggramar&lt;/a&gt; having already fallen to corruption.\nIn the heart of &lt;a href=\"Antorus%2C%20the%20Burning%20Throne\"&gt;Antorus, the Burning Throne&lt;/a&gt;, the Army of the Light and the order champions confronted the &lt;a href=\"Aggramar%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Avatar of Aggramar&lt;/a&gt;, who presided over the world-soul of Argus, before the freed spirits of the Pantheon transported the world-soul to the &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20the%20Pantheon\"&gt;Seat of the Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; in order to sever its connection to the Burning Legion. However, by Sargeras' command, Argus the Unmaker rose into his true form and confronted the order leaders, with the Pantheon providing their support. A battle that should not be winnable ensued, during the course of which Sargeras would intervene and infuse Argus with some of his power, turning the titan red. Ultimately the battle ends with the Unmaker being put out of his misery, finally freeing him from his endless torment. A trickle of Argus' blood would be taken by the champions and later shown to &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;.\nUsing the last of Argus' energies combined with their own, the Pantheon imprisoned Sargeras within the Seat of the Pantheon with &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; as his jailer, bringing an end to the Burning Crusade and to the &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt;.\nShadowlands.\nAs the nathrezim had planned, their corruption of Argus' soul caused it to travel to the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt; after he was killed at the Seat. The soul crashed into the &lt;a href=\"Arbiter\"&gt;Arbiter&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Oribos\"&gt;Oribos&lt;/a&gt; and rendered her dormant, causing all new souls entering the Shadowlands to flow directly into the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt; instead of being sorted to their rightful afterlives, which in turn set off a chain of events playing into the long-term plans of &lt;a href=\"Zovaal\"&gt;the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen a &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Walker\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt; and their allies tried to create &lt;a href=\"Arbiter%20%28title%29\"&gt;a new Arbiter&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Zereth%20Mortis\"&gt;Zereth Mortis&lt;/a&gt; by infusing an empty &lt;a href=\"vessel\"&gt;vessel&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Crypts%20of%20the%20Eternal\"&gt;Crypts of the Eternal&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Darkseer%20Corrupter\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt; infiltrator sabotaged the ritual and summoned an &lt;a href=\"Echo%20of%20Argus\"&gt;Echo of Argus&lt;/a&gt; so that the titan could take the vessel and become \"&lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Ones\"&gt;Eternal&lt;/a&gt;\". The Maw Walker and their allies managed to defeat Argus, but the nathrezim's interference succeeded in disrupting the creation of a new Arbiter until &lt;a href=\"Pelagos\"&gt;Pelagos&lt;/a&gt; volunteered his own soul for the role.\nAppearance.\nArgus was equipped with black and gold armor on his limbs and waist, while a massive helm adorned his head, vaguely in the shape of a pharaoh crown. His body was pierced in multiple areas with spikes and through his armor. Argus' glowing, deep blue skin made him distinct from the rest of his titan brethren. A close look at Argus' head reveals that he lacked lips, and his lower jaw appeared skeletal. Removing the helm geoset from his model reveals that his face lacked muscle tissue as well. These signs show that he was not entirely formed yet.\nDespite having been tortured by the Burning Legion for millennia, Argus seemed to lack the classical signs of &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; corruption, instead mainly wielding the power of Death. See &lt;a href=\"Fel%23Effects%20on%20beings\"&gt;Fel#Effects on beings&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Demon%23Characteristics\"&gt;Demon#Characteristics&lt;/a&gt;. This ultimately proved to be a result of being corrupted primarily by Death instead of fel. During the battle with the order leaders and the Pantheon, Argus would take on a red tone after he was infused with Sargeras' power. This would carry over after his death, with his soul taking a red color.\nSpeculation.\nHe was very likely to be a part of the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon%23Dark%20Pantheon\"&gt;Dark Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;."}

The draenei had completed the construction of the \"&lt;a href=\"Vindicaar\"&gt;Vindicaar&lt;/a&gt;\", a ship to transport the heroes of Azeroth to invade the Legion's homeworld. The draenei has issued a call to arms to all of Azeroth to support the counter-offensive. The &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; have answered the call, with &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Aethas%20Sunreaver\"&gt;Aethas Sunreaver&lt;/a&gt; leading the Horde reinforcements, and &lt;a href=\"Vereesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Vereesa Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arator%20the%20Redeemer\"&gt;Arator the Redeemer&lt;/a&gt; leading the Alliance reinforcements. Together, they rendezvoused at &lt;a href=\"Azuremyst%20Isles\"&gt;Azuremyst Isles&lt;/a&gt; where they boarded the \"Vindicaar\" and made preparations to regroup with the &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Army of the Light&lt;/a&gt;.\nKrokuun.\nThe battle for Argus begins.\nAfter arriving on Argus, the \"Vindicaar\" flew to &lt;a href=\"Krokuun\"&gt;Krokuun&lt;/a&gt; to rendezvous with the Army of the Light. Once the \"Vindicaar\" arrived, the Army of the Light's ship \u2014 the \"&lt;a href=\"Xenedar\"&gt;Xenedar&lt;/a&gt;\" \u2014 revealed itself. This caught the attention of the Burning Legion's forces on the ground however, and they proceeded to shoot down the \"Xenedar\". Before the Legion's forces had a chance to focus fire on the \"Vindicaar\", Prophet Velen ordered the Azerothian heroes to make landfall and commence the final battle for Argus. While the Legion's &lt;a href=\"Vehicles\"&gt;siege weapon&lt;/a&gt; was recharging, &lt;a href=\"Prophet%20Velen\"&gt;Prophet Velen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; led a vanguard of &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to the battlefront. With Velen shielding the vanguard with the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;, the vanguard went on to destroy the Legion's &lt;a href=\"Devastator\"&gt;Devastator&lt;/a&gt;s and rescued the Legion's &lt;a href=\"Krokul\"&gt;krokul&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"slave\"&gt;slave&lt;/a&gt;s. After which, the vanguard destroyed the Legion's &lt;a href=\"fel%20cannon\"&gt;fel cannon&lt;/a&gt;s, slew &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; reinforcements, and culminated the battle by defeating &lt;a href=\"Antaen%20Light-Breaker\"&gt;Antaen Light-Breaker&lt;/a&gt; (which the heroes believed to be the Legion's main siege weapon).\nAlthough the &lt;a href=\"Armies%20of%20Legionfall\"&gt;Armies of Legionfall&lt;/a&gt; emerged victorious from the battle, they've sustained heavy casualties. Velen proposed to replenish their ranks by recruiting the beleaguered krokul they just liberated from slavery. Velen tracked the krokul to a &lt;a href=\"Krokul%20Hovel\"&gt;Krokul Hovel&lt;/a&gt;, where he has a reunion with &lt;a href=\"Chieftain%20Hatuun\"&gt;Chieftain Hatuun&lt;/a&gt;. Hatuun is bitter Velen had abandoned him and all those who were stranded on Argus to the Legion but &lt;a href=\"High%20Exarch%20Turalyon\"&gt;High Exarch Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; revealed himself and urged the &lt;a href=\"Broken\"&gt;Broken&lt;/a&gt; to stand with the Azerothians to defeat the Burning Legion. Turalyon disclosed he was saved by the krokul when the \"Xenedar\" crashed but the survivors of the Army of the Light were still fighting for their lives at the crash site. After Turalyon regrouped with &lt;a href=\"Lothraxion\"&gt;Lothraxion&lt;/a&gt; and the \"Vindicaar\", Turalyon and the adventurer set out to continue their war against the Burning Legion. The Broken resistance that Chieftain Hatuun led was called the &lt;a href=\"Argussian%20Reach\"&gt;Argussian Reach&lt;/a&gt; and his collective of Broken identify themselves as Darkfallen. In order to earn the Argussian Reach's trust, Turalyon tasked adventurers with aiding in the dispatching of prominent demons that have been a thorn in the Argussian Reach's side and rescuing more &lt;a href=\"Darkfallen%20Slave\"&gt;Darkfallen Slave&lt;/a&gt;s. Finally, Turalyon led a strike against &lt;a href=\"Aggonar\"&gt;Aggonar&lt;/a&gt;, the master of the &lt;a href=\"Annihilan%20Pits\"&gt;Annihilan Pits&lt;/a&gt;. The battle nearly went poorly when Aggonar summoned &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Fiend\"&gt;Burning Fiend&lt;/a&gt;s, but &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; arrived to turn the tide of battle. The combined might of the heroes was enough to dispatch the &lt;a href=\"pitlord\"&gt;pitlord&lt;/a&gt;, and Turalyon and Alleria were not only relieved to be reunited but also sensed that their son &lt;a href=\"Arator%20Windrunner\"&gt;Arator&lt;/a&gt; was nearby and they would soon see him again. After earning the allegiance of their new Broken allies, Alleria and Turalyon traveled to the \"Vindicaar\" were they had an emotional reunion with their son.\nTuralyon and Alleria went on to rescue the &lt;a href=\"Lightforged%20draenei\"&gt;Lightforged draenei&lt;/a&gt; at the \"Xenedar\" crash site. Adventurers traveled to the \"Xenedar\" to aid &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Fareeya\"&gt;Captain Fareeya&lt;/a&gt; in salvaging supplies, aid the Lightforged draenei in fending off demon incursions, and prevent the Legion from harvesting the souls of their fallen. Eventually, the adventurers secured &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Judgment%20%28item%29\"&gt;Light's Judgment&lt;/a&gt; and teleported it to the \"Vindicaar\". Once Light's Judgement was installed on the \"Vindicaar\", the adventurers used it to clear the rubble blocking the \"Xenedar\" and to destroy their enemies. Once the path was cleared, Turalyon and Alleria rescued the dormant &lt;a href=\"Xe%27ra\"&gt;Xe'ra&lt;/a&gt; from the \"Xenedar\" and had the remainder of their troops secure the \"Xenedar\" crash site.\nMagni's visions and the assault on Nath'raxas Spire.\nWhile Alleria and Turalyon secured the \"Xenedar\", &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; revealed that he has been hearing the whispers of &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt; and believes the planet has been reaching out to him. Magni activated the Broken's revered &lt;a href=\"Sacred%20Stone\"&gt;Sacred Stone&lt;/a&gt; to witness a vision from Argus itself. Argus' vision revealed that the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Aggramar\"&gt;Aggramar&lt;/a&gt; has been corrupted by &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; and is now serving as a lord of the Burning Legion. Worse, they appear to be transforming Argus itself and utilizing it for a nefarious purpose. After relaying the news to Turalyon, Turalyon surmised that the Burning Legion was harnessing the soul of a titan in order to regenerate their fallen armies in the &lt;a href=\"Nether\"&gt;Nether&lt;/a&gt;. Turalyon believes that if they can destroy the titan, the Burning Legion's ranks will become finite and give the resistance a chance at victory. Turalyon, Illidan, Velen, and Alleria led their forces to &lt;a href=\"Destiny%20Point\"&gt;Destiny Point&lt;/a&gt; in order to raid &lt;a href=\"Nath%27raxas%20Hold\"&gt;Nath'raxas Hold&lt;/a&gt;. As &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Artificer%20Romuul\"&gt;Grand Artificer Romuul&lt;/a&gt; finished repairing his &lt;a href=\"warframe\"&gt;warframe&lt;/a&gt;, Illidan and Alleria led attacks on the demons' front while Velen sanctified their fallen and Turalyon recovered lost Lightforged armaments. Once Romuul's warframe was operational, the adventurers utilized it to decimate the demons' ranks and close the &lt;a href=\"Nath%27raxxan%20Rift\"&gt;Nath'raxxan Rift&lt;/a&gt;s. This allowed the armies of the \"Vindicaar\" to breach &lt;a href=\"Nath%27raxas%20Spire\"&gt;Nath'raxas Spire&lt;/a&gt; and ultimately slew &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Nath%27raxas\"&gt;Lord Nath'raxas&lt;/a&gt;. As the heroes celebrated their victory, Aggramar suddenly arrived. The Army of the Light and the adventurer teleported away before they had to face Aggramar's wrath. Both Turalyon and Alleria were shocked by Aggramar's immeasurable power, while Illidan grimly stated that they must destroy Argus' &lt;a href=\"World-soul\"&gt;World-soul&lt;/a&gt; in order to break the Burning Legion.\nEredath.\nObtaining the Sigil of Awakening.\nRealizing that the \"Vindicaar\"'s forces still lacked the strength to breach &lt;a href=\"Antorus%2C%20the%20Burning%20Throne\"&gt;Antorus&lt;/a&gt;, Prophet Velen has decided to form an expedition to &lt;a href=\"Eredath\"&gt;Eredath&lt;/a&gt; and gather the missing two pieces necessary to reconstruct the &lt;a href=\"Crown%20of%20the%20Triumvirate\"&gt;Crown of the Triumvirate&lt;/a&gt;. When Velen arrived at Eredath however, he was troubled to hear that the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"L%27ura\"&gt;L'ura&lt;/a&gt;'s song of war was still playing, yet distorted. Velen traveled to &lt;a href=\"Triumvirate%27s%20End\"&gt;Triumvirate's End&lt;/a&gt; and activated its defenses in order to ward off the hostile &lt;a href=\"Ghost\"&gt;spirits&lt;/a&gt;. With Triumvirate's End secured, Velen has the \"Vindicaar\" launch a &lt;a href=\"Lightforged%20beacon\"&gt;Lightforged beacon&lt;/a&gt; to their location in order to bring in reinforcements and to provide an escape for the expedition if needed. Reinforced by the Army of the Light, Velen's expedition set off to search for the &lt;a href=\"%3ASigil%20of%20Awakening\"&gt;:Sigil of Awakening&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Conservatory%20of%20the%20Arcane\"&gt;Conservatory of the Arcane&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Y%27mera\"&gt;Archmage Y'mera&lt;/a&gt; and an adventurer reactivated &lt;a href=\"Vigilant%20Quoram\"&gt;Vigilant Quoram&lt;/a&gt;, the gatekeeper of the conservatory. Quoram tasks the adventurer to undergo numerous trials in order to earn the right to obtain the Sigil of Awakening, with the last challenge being to face an &lt;a href=\"Archimonde%20%28echo%29\"&gt;echo of Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Praetorium\"&gt;Praetorium&lt;/a&gt;. After succeeding in all the challenges, the echo of Archimonde relinquished the Sigil of Awakening to the adventurer and the adventurer and Archmage Y'mera transported it back to the \"Vindicaar\".\nTalgath's fall.\nAfter securing the Sigil of Awakening in the \"Vindicaar\", Turalyon revealed that acquiring the sigil had alerted the Burning Legion and they have sent their forces to Eredath. Velen took &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Fareeya\"&gt;Captain Fareeya&lt;/a&gt; and her forces into the &lt;a href=\"Arinor%20Gardens\"&gt;Arinor Gardens&lt;/a&gt; area to search for the &lt;a href=\"%3ACrest%20of%20Knowledge\"&gt;:Crest of Knowledge&lt;/a&gt;, putting them directly behind enemy lines. Turalyon and the adventurer traveled back to the Conservatory of the Arcane in order to escort Velen's expedition back to safety. Once Turalyon arrived, he immediately rallied the Lightforged to regroup with Velen. After disrupting the Legion's forces at the Arinor Gardens, Turalyon and the adventurer found Velen at his late &lt;a href=\"High%20General%20Rakeesh\"&gt;son&lt;/a&gt;'s old bed, lamenting his son's tragic fate. After rendezvousing with Velen, the Prophet revealed that &lt;a href=\"Talgath\"&gt;Talgath&lt;/a&gt; was here and they had to find the Crest of Knowledge before he did. While Turalyon took command of Fareeya's lieutenants and escorted Velen to the Crest of Knowledge, the adventurer proceeded to close the Burning Legion's portals and whittling away Talgath's forces to clear the way for Velen's party. As the adventurer and Velen's party approached &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden%27s%20Terrace\"&gt;Kil'jaeden's Terrace&lt;/a&gt;, they saw the &lt;a href=\"Echo%20of%20Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Echo of Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; speaking with the &lt;a href=\"Echo%20of%20Talgath\"&gt;Echo of Talgath&lt;/a&gt; about how they had stored the Crest of Knowledge in the &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20the%20Triumvirate\"&gt;Seat of the Triumvirate&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, Velen's party was confronted by Talgath and they were forced to face him in battle. After Velen's group wounded Talgath, he incapacitated the party and tried to flee. Velen, however, broke free of his debilitation and bound Talgath with holy shackles. Velen gave Talgath one last chance to help them find the Crest of Knowledge before terminating him. Talgath mocked their quest and told Velen that \"Nothing will escape [from] the temple. Not even the Light itself.\" Velen finished Talgath off with holy fire, but his last words and the echoes of the past confirmed that the relic they're seeking was indeed in the Seat of the Triumvirate.\nWar of Light and Shadow.\nVelen and Turalyon led their forces back to the \"Vindicaar\" where they discussed the recent events. Velen however, suspected that &lt;a href=\"L%27ura\"&gt;L'ura&lt;/a&gt; had transformed into a &lt;a href=\"dark%20naaru\"&gt;dark naaru&lt;/a&gt; and it would be a major obstacle to the Crest of Knowledge. Just as Velen was about to lead an expedition into the Seat of the Triumvirate, Alleria Windrunner appeared to tell Velen that she had scouted the area and revealed L'ura's &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; energy had lured an army of Void creatures to the temple. Alleria had a plan to breach the Seat of the Triumvirate, but it would require the adventurer's aid. Velen endorsed Alleria's plan and she and the adventurer returned to Triumvirate's End in order to investigate the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Oronaar\"&gt;Ruins of Oronaar&lt;/a&gt;. Alleria and the adventurer found the ruins to be rife with the Void's influence. After finding &lt;a href=\"%3AFragmented%20Prayers\"&gt;:Fragmented Prayers&lt;/a&gt; and witnessing the &lt;a href=\"Echo%20of%20Arkhaan\"&gt;Echo of Arkhaan&lt;/a&gt;'s futile attempts to prevent his community from being debased by the Void, Alleria and the adventurer located the Broken &lt;a href=\"Arkhaan\"&gt;Arkhaan&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 the last uncorrupted priest of Oronaar. Alleria and the adventurer tried to restore some semblance of Arkhaan's sanity by cleansing the nearby &lt;a href=\"Void%20Manifestation\"&gt;Void Manifestation&lt;/a&gt;s and slaying the &lt;a href=\"Voidscarred\"&gt;Void-corrupted Broken&lt;/a&gt; who were once a part of his community. After recovering somewhat from his madness, Arkhaan remembered a plan that he believed would lead to his salvation. Alleria and the adventurer followed Arkhaan to &lt;a href=\"Isolon\"&gt;Isolon&lt;/a&gt;, which appeared to had been calling to Arkhaan and was filled by many Void-corrupted Broken. Arkhaan followed the voices to a &lt;a href=\"Void%20Tear\"&gt;Void Tear&lt;/a&gt;, which Alleria and the adventurer followed Arkhaan to. The Void transported Alleria, Arkhaan, and the adventurer to a Void realm, where the &lt;a href=\"Void%20ethereal\"&gt;Void ethereal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Viceroy%20Nezhar\"&gt;Viceroy Nezhar&lt;/a&gt; corrupted Arkhaan; leaving the adventurer and Alleria little choice but to slay the Void-corrupted Broken while the viceroy escaped. After Arkhaan was slain, Alleria and the adventurer were pulled back to Isolon by &lt;a href=\"Locus-Walker\"&gt;Locus-Walker&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlleria introduced Locus-Walker as her mentor in the ways of the void and he stated that he too has been investigating the &lt;a href=\"Shadowguard\"&gt;Shadowguard&lt;/a&gt;'s machinations in Argus. After Locus-Walker created a Void Tear, Alleria and the adventurer followed Locus-Walker to the &lt;a href=\"Umbra%20Hollows\"&gt;Umbra Hollows&lt;/a&gt;, where they witnessed the Void ethereals preparing to corrupt all of Argus with the Void. With the Void's invasion being imminent, Alleria decided that she should finish her training with Locus-Walker in order to master the void. Locus-Walker, Alleria, and the adventurer began to disrupt the Shadowguard's efforts by deactivating their &lt;a href=\"Void%20Harvester\"&gt;Void Harvester&lt;/a&gt;s, and culling their ranks \u2014 including &lt;a href=\"General%20Zah%27d\"&gt;General Zah'd&lt;/a&gt;. For the next step of Alleria's training, Locus-Walker tasked Alleria to slay &lt;a href=\"Nhal%27athoth\"&gt;Nhal'athoth&lt;/a&gt; and absorb the void energy of its &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Nhal%27athoth\"&gt;heart&lt;/a&gt;. After accomplishing her task, Alleria sent the adventurer to give the &lt;a href=\"%3ARemnant%20of%20Nhal%27athoth\"&gt;:Remnant of Nhal'athoth&lt;/a&gt; to Velen and to tell him of what they have learned about the void incursions. Alleria in the meantime had set off for the Seat of the Triumvirate to begin the next phase of her training. From the information that the adventurer gathered, Velen came to the conclusion that the Light and Shadow must coexist. Velen believes that the &lt;a href=\"Essence%20of%20Shadow\"&gt;Essence of Shadow&lt;/a&gt; taken from Nhal'athoth's remnants will be exactly what they need to bring balance to the &lt;a href=\"Netherlight%20Crucible\"&gt;Netherlight Crucible&lt;/a&gt; and give them the edge they need against the Legion. With the Netherlight Crucible upgraded, the weapons of the \"Vindicaar\"'s champions can thus be imbued by both the Light and the Shadow.\nAssault on the Seat of the Triumvirate.\nWith their forces ready, Velen sent an army of adventurers to aid Alleria and Locus-Walker's attack on the Void-infested Seat of the Triumvirate. As they begin their assault, the party witnessed &lt;a href=\"Void%20ethereal\"&gt;Void ethereal&lt;/a&gt;s creating Void Tears to infect the land with the Void. Alleria instructed the adventurers to exterminate the battalions of Void ethereals, &lt;a href=\"voidwalker\"&gt;voidwalker&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Voidscarred\"&gt;Voidscarred&lt;/a&gt; to put an end to the Void proliferation. The adventurers later dispatched &lt;a href=\"Zuraal%20the%20Ascended\"&gt;Zuraal the Ascended&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 the Shadowguard's first success at creating a Void-infused Broken \u2014 at the &lt;a href=\"Triad%27s%20Conservatory\"&gt;Triad's Conservatory&lt;/a&gt;. After which, Alleria used her Void magic to create a hole on a building's wall that was impeding their path, which allowed the party to breach the &lt;a href=\"Shadowguard%20Incursion\"&gt;Shadowguard Incursion&lt;/a&gt;. There, the adventurers faced off against &lt;a href=\"Saprish\"&gt;Saprish&lt;/a&gt; and his voracious pets: &lt;a href=\"Darkfang%20%28panthara%29\"&gt;Darkfang&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shadewing\"&gt;Shadewing&lt;/a&gt;. After Saprish's death, Locus-Walker teleports in to take Saprish's staff for himself. The party then power through to the temple's entrance, where they find &lt;a href=\"Viceroy%20Nezhar\"&gt;Viceroy Nezhar&lt;/a&gt; and his forces trying to break into the temple. After the party dispatched Viceroy Nezhar and his remnant forces, Alleria and Locus-Walker dissipated the Void barrier at the entrance of the temple and prepared for a final showdown with &lt;a href=\"L%27ura\"&gt;L'ura&lt;/a&gt;. Once the party entered the temple, they were forced to slay the dark naaru L'ura. After its defeat, Alleria Windrunner siphons L'ura's Void energy and becomes a &lt;a href=\"void%20elf\"&gt;void elf&lt;/a&gt;. The adventurers take the Crest of Knowledge to Velen at the \"Vindicaar\". With all relic components together, Velen takes the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Prophecy%20%28lore%29\"&gt;Eye of Prophecy&lt;/a&gt; from his staff and combined it with the Crest of Knowledge and the Sigil of Awakening; thus reconstituting the Crown of the Triumvirate. Velen then used the Crown of the Triumvirate to empower the \"Vindicaar\", coating the ship in a gold light.\nInvasion Points.\nWhile the Burning Legion focused their defenses on Argus, Illidan Stormrage tasked adventurers to take the fight to the Legion on other worlds. By sending his forces through &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20Point\"&gt;Invasion Point&lt;/a&gt;s on Argus, Illidan has engineered numerous offensives on other Legion worlds.\nRejection of the gift.\nBack at the Krokul Hovel, Magni Bronzebeard received two more visions from the Sacred Stone. The first vision was from a distressed Argus, and in this vision, Magni witnessed the Burning Legion torturing the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;. Sargeras and Aggramar noted that &lt;a href=\"Eonar\"&gt;Eonar&lt;/a&gt; has yet to be captured, however, but their discussion indicated that they plan to create a &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Pantheon\"&gt;Dark Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;. The second vision came from Eonar herself, speaking from the &lt;a href=\"Elarian%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Elarian Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; where her &lt;a href=\"Essence%20of%20Eonar\"&gt;spirit&lt;/a&gt; lies. Eonar pleaded with Magni and the adventurer to aid her; for if the Burning Legion find her, it would spell the annihilation of everything.\nBack at the \"Vindicaar\", Turalyon believed it to be the right time to revive &lt;a href=\"Xe%27ra\"&gt;Xe'ra&lt;/a&gt;. After assembling Xe'ra's components and combining them with &lt;a href=\"%3ALight%27s%20Heart\"&gt;:Light's Heart&lt;/a&gt;, Xe'ra was consequently restored. After Turalyon welcomed Xe'ra back, Xe'ra expressed its delight that they have found its Chosen One \u2014 Illidan Stormrage. Xe'ra wanted to restore Illidan to his original state, before his demonic transformation and when he had golden eyes that signified his great and prosperous future. Illidan however, was reluctant to be healed by Xe'ra's Light and become the Chosen One Xe'ra is trying to make him become. Rather, he is content with seeking the Legion's end in his own form, regardless of how demonic or grotesque it has become. Xe'ra is insistent, however, and tried to transform Illidan with its Light by force. When Xe'ra bound Illidan and attempted to impose its version of Illidan's destiny, Illidan resisted and destroyed Xe'ra with his &lt;a href=\"%3AEye%20Beam\"&gt;:Eye Beam&lt;/a&gt;. Turalyon was enraged by Xe'ra's destruction and struck Illidan with his sword. However, Illidan caught Turalyon's blow and rebuked him for his blind faith in Xe'ra's prophecy. Illidan stated to all that, \"There can be no chosen one. Only we... can save ourselves.\"\nProphet Velen sensed that Xe'ra's death had distressed Turalyon and many others and moved to uplift their spirits. Velen told Turalyon that the Light did not die with the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Naaru\"&gt;Prime Naaru&lt;/a&gt; and that it still shined within all of them. Furthermore, it was imperative that they press on as they still had a world to save. However, Velen would not let Xe'ra's passing go to waste. Velen gathered the &lt;a href=\"Vestige%20of%20Light\"&gt;essence of Xe'ra's Light&lt;/a&gt; and imbued the &lt;a href=\"Netherlight%20Crucible\"&gt;Netherlight Crucible&lt;/a&gt; with it.\nWith their forces prepared for the ultimate battle, Velen set out to create footholds in the &lt;a href=\"Antoran%20Wastes\"&gt;Antoran Wastes&lt;/a&gt; from which they can assault the &lt;a href=\"Antorus%2C%20the%20Burning%20Throne\"&gt;Burning Throne&lt;/a&gt;.\nAntoran Wastes.\nIn their initial engagements in the &lt;a href=\"Antoran%20Wastes\"&gt;Antoran Wastes&lt;/a&gt;, Illidan Stormrage led his &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt; to establish the &lt;a href=\"Veiled%20Den\"&gt;Veiled Den&lt;/a&gt; in the north while Alleria Windrunner led the Army of the Light's forces to establish &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Purchase\"&gt;Light's Purchase&lt;/a&gt; in the south. However, the two encampments have come under heavy attack and were desperately awaiting reinforcements. The \"Vindicaar\" soon arrived and established &lt;a href=\"Hope%27s%20Landing\"&gt;Hope's Landing&lt;/a&gt; as their beachhead to reinforce the two fronts. Both Alleria and Illidan believed that a direct assault on Antorus would prove too costly with such limited resources at their disposal. With Antorus too heavily defended, the two encampments could do little else but fend off the Legion through guerrilla warfare and assassinations. As the war carried on, Turalyon and Alleria reunited with &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; at the \"Vindicaar\". Khadgar proposed to have a reunion feast with the &lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Lothar\"&gt;Sons of Lothar&lt;/a&gt; once the war was won, to which Alleria and Turalyon happily agreed to; all the while jesting that it was Khadgar's turn to buy the drinks. Alleria also spoke with her sister &lt;a href=\"Vereesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Vereesa&lt;/a&gt; about their sister &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas&lt;/a&gt;'s fate. Alleria was shocked and angered to learn that Sylvanas was currently leading the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; that ravaged their people during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;. Vereesa wanted to explain to Alleria Sylvanas's &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undeath&lt;/a&gt; and other details as well, but was finding trouble finding the right words. Still, she did her best to give Alleria a proper explanation in private. Realizing they still required more resources, High Exarch Turalyon dispatched adventurers to gather &lt;a href=\"Pristine%20Argunite\"&gt;Argunite&lt;/a&gt; to prepare for their final assault on Antorus.\nThe vessels docked at &lt;a href=\"Terminus\"&gt;Terminus&lt;/a&gt; were taking on &lt;a href=\"soldier\"&gt;soldier&lt;/a&gt;s and supplies for the Legion's assaults against &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Champions of &lt;a href=\"Class%20Order\"&gt;Class Order&lt;/a&gt;s were sent to bring the vessels down. A great summoning circle in Antoran Wastes called demons from the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; back to Argus. Azeroth's champions were tasked with dismantling the circle and slowing the Legion's reinforcements.\nAntorus, the Burning Throne.\nAfter making the necessary preparations, Turalyon made the decision to begin the attack on &lt;a href=\"Antorus%2C%20the%20Burning%20Throne\"&gt;Antorus, the Burning Throne&lt;/a&gt;. With the \"Vindicaar\" empowered by the &lt;a href=\"Crown%20of%20the%20Triumvirate\"&gt;Crown of the Triumvirate&lt;/a&gt;, the \"Vindicaar\" used &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Judgment%20%28item%29\"&gt;Light's Judgment&lt;/a&gt; to burn an opening on one of Antorus's massive walls. The \"Vindicaar\" then sent an army of &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s and a contingent of its forces to storm the Burning Legion citadel. Turalyon and his Lightforged first faced &lt;a href=\"Garothi%20Worldbreaker\"&gt;Garothi Worldbreaker&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Edge%20of%20Discord\"&gt;Edge of Discord&lt;/a&gt; but they were overwhelmed and forced to retreat. The adventurers relieved Turalyon's forces and destroyed the Legion war machine. After which, Alleria led an assault on the northern front, distracting the Legion while Turalyon, his Lightforged, and &lt;a href=\"warframe\"&gt;warframe&lt;/a&gt; reinforcements teleported in the Edge of Discord to secure it and press on the attack. The \"Vindicaar\"'s champions rescued pinned troops and went on to slay the &lt;a href=\"Felhounds%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Felhounds of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Den%20of%20the%20Devourers\"&gt;Den of the Devourers&lt;/a&gt;. After which, the Army of the Light occupied the den to provide artillery fire on the bridges while adventurers assaulted &lt;a href=\"Antoran%20High%20Command\"&gt;Antoran High Command&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Gaze%20of%20the%20Legion\"&gt;Gaze of the Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe \"Vindicaar\"'s forces then went on to secure Antorus's portal networks in order to cut off the Legion's reinforcements from other worlds. After adventurers dispatched &lt;a href=\"Portal%20Keeper%20Hasabel\"&gt;Portal Keeper Hasabel&lt;/a&gt;, adventurers used the Legion's portals to travel to the &lt;a href=\"Elarian%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Elarian Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;. There they fought the Legion forces of the &lt;a href=\"Paraxis\"&gt;Paraxis&lt;/a&gt; in order to defend &lt;a href=\"Eonar%20the%20Life-Binder\"&gt;Eonar the Life-Binder&lt;/a&gt;. After successfully fending off the demon incursion, Eonar urged the adventurers to rescue the rest of the imprisoned &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;, for if &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; breaks them as he did Aggramar, no power in the universe would be able to stop him. The adventurers returned to the \"Vindicaar\" and went off to assault the &lt;a href=\"Exhaust\"&gt;Exhaust&lt;/a&gt;, the production center of the Legion's arsenal. The adventurers were met by &lt;a href=\"Imonar%20the%20Soulhunter\"&gt;Imonar the Soulhunter&lt;/a&gt;, the Legion's best bounty hunter. After defeating Imonar, the \"Vindicaar\" used his runes to bypass the Burning Throne's defenses and struck directly at the &lt;a href=\"Hallowed%20Felworks\"&gt;Hallowed Felworks&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the Hallowed Felworks, the adventurers defeated &lt;a href=\"Kin%27garoth\"&gt;Kin'garoth&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 the Legion's top inventor. After Kin'garoth's defeat, the Hallowed Felworks began to collapse. The adventurers then battled their way through the Legion's prison. One of the coven's tortured prisoners, &lt;a href=\"Varimathras%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Varimathras&lt;/a&gt;, was awaiting the adventurers at the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20Anguish\"&gt;Chamber of Anguish&lt;/a&gt;. The vindictive &lt;a href=\"The%20Coven%20of%20Shivarra\"&gt;Coven of Shivarra&lt;/a&gt; stripped away both flesh and sanity from Varimathras, leaving only a singular desire to inflict suffering upon the mortals who cost him everything. After the adventurers slew Varimathras, they proceeded to the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Anguish\"&gt;Temple of Anguish&lt;/a&gt;, where the &lt;a href=\"Coven%20of%20Shivarra\"&gt;Coven of Shivarra&lt;/a&gt; worked to subvert the Pantheon. The adventurers slew the Coven of Shivarra and freed the Pantheon's spirits from their tortured imprisonment. Magni Bronzebeard stayed with the Pantheon to help them recover from their traumatic ordeal while Velen, Illidan, and the adventurers moved to liberate Argus's &lt;a href=\"world-soul\"&gt;world-soul&lt;/a&gt;.\nArgus's world-soul was being guarded by &lt;a href=\"Aggramar%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Aggramar&lt;/a&gt;, forcing the adventurers to strike him down. With Aggramar's downfall, his essence was set free, allowing him to rejoin his uncorrupted brethren. Prophet Velen collected the &lt;a href=\"Sigil%20of%20the%20Dark%20Titan\"&gt;Sigils of the Dark Titan&lt;/a&gt; to further upgrade the \"Vindicaar\"'s power and give the ship enough strength to breach the fetid heart of Argus itself. With the Pantheon restored, they teleported Magni, Velen, Illidan, and the adventurers to the &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20the%20Pantheon\"&gt;Seat of the Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; where the Pantheon worked to sever Argus's connection to the Burning Legion and imprison Sargeras once and for all.\nAt the Seat of the Pantheon, however, Sargeras transformed Argus's world-soul into the deadly titan &lt;a href=\"Argus%20the%20Unmaker\"&gt;Argus the Unmaker&lt;/a&gt;. The Pantheon and the heroes of Azeroth fought to destroy Argus the Unmaker, and ultimately slew him, freeing him from millennia of torment, and destroying Sargeras's greatest weapon. With the Legion crippled by the loss of Argus, the Pantheon commended the mortals for saving their world and combined their powers with the last remnants of Argus's essence to forever imprison Sargeras within the Seat. Velen, Magni, and the adventurers went to the \"Vindicaar\" to return home, but Illidan stayed behind to become Sargeras's new jailer. Before Sargeras was imprisoned, however, he managed to stab &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt; with his &lt;a href=\"Sword%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;massive sword&lt;/a&gt;, injuring &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; severely.\nWith the Burning Crusade at long last ended, the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; champions returned to their respective homes to celebrate their costly victory against the Legion. However, Sargeras's last spiteful act had dire ramifications. &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; was the first to witness the power of titan blood and the wound inflicted by Sargeras caused Azeroth to hemorrhage. Both the Alliance and the Horde took a keen interest in &lt;a href=\"Azerite\"&gt;Azeroth's blood&lt;/a&gt; as a potential resource, which soon afterwards helped paved the way for an overwhelmingly devastating &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt; between the two factions.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

The amulets were then distributed among the Syndicate.\nNearly all the information about this group comes from &lt;a href=\"Decrypted%20Letter\"&gt;a letter&lt;/a&gt;, which was found by &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, and translated by &lt;a href=\"Prospector%20Stormpike\"&gt;Prospector Stormpike&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpeculation.\nJudging from the last lines of the letter, it can be implied that the Argus Wake is one of the more powerful splinter cults of the Shadow Council, reporting directly to the higher powers of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. It is unknown who or what the \"Third Host\" is, however if the Argus Wake are servants of the Burning Legion, it is possible this note refers to a third host for &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, the first two being &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn other sources of Warcraft lore, a \"host\" is also the term used for the main body of an army. So it is also likely that the Third Host is the next invading force to be sent by the Burning Legion (the first having been sent during the War of the Ancients, and the second during the Third War).\nThe name Argus Wake is likely connected to the &lt;a href=\"eredar\"&gt;eredar&lt;/a&gt; homeworld of &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;. Out of universe, Argus may instead have been named after the Argus Wake. The Argus Wake was introduced in classic \"World of Warcraft\", while Argus the planet wasn't invented until the draenei-eredar retcon of \"The Burning Crusade\".\nThe bloodstone used by the Argus Wake may result from the stealing of a &lt;a href=\"Bloodstone%20Artifacts\"&gt;Bloodstone Artifact&lt;/a&gt; sent by &lt;a href=\"Warden%20Belamoore\"&gt;Warden Belamoore&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;."}

Good raid awareness is required, as a single mishandled ability can quickly snowball into a wipe. \nAdventure Guide.\n\"Bound.

All hope would be lost, were it not for the titans...\nStage Three: The Arcane Masters.\nWhen Argus reaches 40% health, he is sufficiently weakened such that Aman'Thul is able to subdue him with a Temporal Blast. Or so it seems...\nStrategy.\nThis fight requires 2 tanks. &lt;a href=\"Bloodlust\"&gt;Bloodlust&lt;/a&gt; abilities should be saved for the final phase when Titanforging is cast on the raid. The fight's mechanics favor having more ranged DPS than melee due to there being adds at separate corners of the arena in the final phase, as well as having an easier time with Soul Blight in Phase 1 and interrupting adds in Phase 3. Throughout the fight, except for Phase 3, Argus will be causing raid-wide damage with Tortured Rage, which does high enough damage to kill players at medium-low health. \nPhase 1.\nTanks should position Argus in the center of the room and face him away from the raid. This will allow the tanks to avoid hitting the group with the boss' Sweeping Scythe, a frontal cone attack that puts a debuff on anyone it hits that increases their physical damage taken. The tanks should swap every 3-4 stacks. \nDPS and healers should stay clumped in a single group to control where Argus will hit with his Cone of Death. This ability places a large cone of Death Fog on the ground where he strikes and can be targeted at any a random non-tank player. By having everyone in the same spot and with plenty of time to dodge as Argus winds up his attack, players should be able to keep the Death Fog covering the arena to a minimum by placing the Cones of Death right next to each other. During this time, Argus will also be placing Soul Blight Orbs on random non-tank players. Once this debuff expires, it will create a large patch of Death Fog on the ground around affected player. If one explodes in the group, it is likely at least 1 person caught in the blast will die before being able to move out of the fog. The players with Soul Blight must rush to the back of the room next to the rest of the Death Fog to drop their debuffs away from everyone else. \nFinally, &lt;a href=\"Golganneth\"&gt;Golganneth&lt;/a&gt; will aid the players with Orbs of Sea and Orbs of Sky. He will place 2 debuffs on random players that will result in them dropping 2 orbs on the ground once they expire: a watery one and a lightning one. The Orb of Sea will give players increased Haste and Versatility, while the Orb of Sky gives Mastery and Critical Hit Chance. Once these orbs are out, players can walk through them to get the buff that they need more for their class. Though only 1 type of buff can be up at a time, the effects can stack each time a new set of orbs are out. It is important for the players who have the debuff to drop them close enough to the group for their fellow players to reach them, but far away enough so that orbs are not dropped onto players who do not want a certain type of buff. A few feet from the clumped up group of DPS and healers is typically sufficient. Overall, this phase is about keeping your desired buff up and stacking, while ensuring the Death Fog is covering as little of the room as possible. \nPhase 2.\nWhen the boss hits 70%, he will briefly stop casting Sweeping Scythe and Golganneth will wash away the Death Fog with a massive storm. Everyone must stack in the center of the room and just focus on hurting Argus while the storm goes on. As soon as it ends, Argus will start casting his Sweeping Scythe again and begin casting Edge of Obliteration. This ability causes energy scythes to appear in random locations around the arena and show lines across the ground where they will shoot across the room. Simply stay out of the lines to avoid the damage. \nThe boss' most impactful ability in this phase is Soulburst. Argus will place 3 Soulburst Orbs on random non-tank players that will deal deadly damage to any players who are nearby when the debuff expires. He will also cast 1 Soulbomb, which will outright kill the player it is afflicted with and anyone nearby when it expires. To survive this, &lt;a href=\"Aggramar\"&gt;Aggramar&lt;/a&gt; will give 1 tank the Avatar of Aggramar buff, giving him increased health and a small circle around him which allows anyone who stands in the circle to survive lethal damage. \nTo ensure everyone survives Soulburst, the raid should designate markers on 5 corners of the room: 1 corner for the tank without Avatar to tank Argus, 3 for the players with Soulburst Orbs to safely detonate without hurting anyone, and 1 corner for the Avatar tank and the player with Soulbomb to stack safely. So long as the raid has good awareness and pre-plans where to place the Soulbursts and Soulbomb, no one should be dying in this phase. \nPhase 3.\nAs Argus reaches 40%, &lt;a href=\"Aman%27Thul\"&gt;Aman'Thul&lt;/a&gt; will attempt to bind Argus, only to end up dividing Argus into 7 Constellar Designates. These 7 adds all need to be killed in order to move to the final phase. They normally cast Star Blast, which does negligible damage, and target random players with Cosmic Ray. Simply ensure that no other players are hit with the ray and the affected player should take similarly little damage. The true threat of these Constellar Designates is Cosmic Beacon. This is a 10-second long cast that will place a hard-hitting debuff on the entire raid. This effect stacks and even 2 stacks of Cosmic Beacon can potentially cause players to die. Thus, the raid should assign at least 1 ranged player to be on the lookout to quickly interrupt the Cosmic Beacon casts. \nAbout 10 seconds into the phase, &lt;a href=\"Norgannon\"&gt;Norgannon&lt;/a&gt; will use place a debuff onto each of the adds which causes them to take damage from a particular school of damage: &lt;a href=\"Nature\"&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fire\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ice\"&gt;Ice&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arcane\"&gt;Arcane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Holy\"&gt;Holy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shadow\"&gt;Shadow&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Physical%20damage\"&gt;Physical damage&lt;/a&gt;. For instance, a Retribution Paladin's Holy damage will be increased by 200% against the add with the Holy weakness. Use these debuffs to your class' advantage, but know that interrupting Cosmic Beacon always takes priority.\nFinally, shortly after the phase begins, two of the adds will gain weapons and begin meleeing the raid for high amounts of damage. The tanks need to immediately pick these adds up and the DPS must focus them down, regardless of what type of bonus damage they take as these adds are strong enough to seriously threaten the tanks with their melee attacks alone. \nAs with the second intermission phase with &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden%20%28Tomb%20of%20Sargeras%20tactics%29\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;, this phase poses less threat than the rest of the phases and is meant to run out the clock until Argus' berserk timer, as the DPS must be high to take down all the adds before too much time runs out. \nPhase 4.\nOnce the last Constellar Designate is killed, Argus will reform, trap the raid, and immediately kill everyone in the raid, even reviving anyone previously killed in the encounter, just to kill them once again. After a bit of RP, Eonar will allow everyone's spirits to release and run to the Gift of Eonar (a large glowing tree) to revive themselves. Once everyone is up, DPS Argus until he is almost finished with his End of All Things cast. At which point, you must interrupt him and the final phase will begin. \nBeating this phase requires understanding the Gift of Eonar and how death is used as a resource to be managed. There is no way around players dying in this phase, it will happen quite often. Releasing will let a player run around the arena in ghost form and gather Motes of Titanic Power, which will allow &lt;a href=\"Khaz%27goroth\"&gt;Khaz'goroth&lt;/a&gt; to cast Titanforging on the raid, increasing everyone's attack and healing by 50%. This helps the players safely and quickly deal with the adds in this phase, get Argus down faster, and increase survivability by increasing their healing. Hence, once a player is down, they must see where they have died and assess how easy it will be get orbs while dodging the Hungering Soul adds that wander around the spirit world. Walking to the tree once again will revive the player, but this can only be done a limited number of times before the tree begins to wither (shown by it becoming gray instead of green) and eventually die, leaving those who die with no way to come back outside of battle resurrections and the only thing to do is to gather more motes. \nArgus will continue using his Soulburst and Soulbomb debuffs from Phase 2, but this time, there is no Avatar of Aggramar to soak the bombs. Thus, the one afflicted with Soulbomb is merely going to die unless they have any immunity they can use to survive. The Soulburst players must simply move away from where Argus is being tanked and the rest of the raid to minimize raid-wide damage. If not handled well, the Soulbursts will kill players, especially when they are currently also receiving damage from Argus' Tortured Rage casts. Healers will be put to the test in this phase keeping everyone alive for as long as possible before they die. Those who run out of mana may want to consider dying and coming back if Eonar's Gift has enough energy left to spare. The raid also needs to dodge the Embers of Rage that fall from the sky in a swirl pattern. If these embers are slowing down your game's performance, turning down the particle effects in settings will help quite a bit.\nFinally, the most deadly mechanic of this phase are the Reorigination Modules, large shining orbs. These 5 orbs that spawn around the room will slowly cast Initialization Sequence, then expand an expanse of Death Fog-like blackness that does lethal damage to those who stand in it. If left unchecked, the fog will encompass the arena and everyone will die. Ranged-heavy groups have an easier time dealing with this mechanic as they can more easily hit every orb that spawns. Melee-heavy raids may want to consider watching the raid-timers on DBM and spreading out just prior to the orbs coming out, allowing them to more easily kill the nodes before they begin expanding. \nOverall, this phase has a ton of damage going out and requires very heavy healing and strong DPS to both kill the orbs and Argus before the berserk timer hits. This requires players quickly reacting to abilities as they happen and keeping Titanforging up for as long as possible. So long as the raid does not tunnel on Argus and ignore the Reorigination Modules, they will be able to keep damage high and casualties to a minimum. \nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

The millennia of exposure to the &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; changed them into &lt;a href=\"Broken\"&gt;Broken&lt;/a&gt;, and the Legion hunts down constantly, with those captured being enslaved and worked to death. They have survived this long by tunneling away from the Legion's eyes, hiding and adapting, for in their hour of need, the land still listens to their pleas. They have migrated from one hovel to the next, moving each time the Legion discovered them, and as such, they have always been low on supplies like food, tools and weapons, for they are never able to flee with their possessions.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Broxigar\"&gt;Broxigar&lt;/a&gt; leaped into Argus and confronted &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; himself before being struck down by the Dark Titan. The Broken honored the warrior with a small shrine composed of his surviving necklace, boot, and shoulder pad.\nThe Broken of Argus were first encountered by the &lt;a href=\"Armies%20of%20Legionfall\"&gt;Armies of Legionfall&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Army of the Light&lt;/a&gt; upon their arrival on &lt;a href=\"Krokuun\"&gt;Krokuun&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;order champions&lt;/a&gt; rescued a number of them from the Legion's clutches. Afterwards, Prophet Velen sought them out at Krokul Hovel in hopes that they would serve as allies in the war, only to discover &lt;a href=\"Chieftain%20Hatuun\"&gt;Hatuun&lt;/a&gt;, bitter and angry over their \"abandonment\" by the Prophet, though they were halted by High Exarch &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; before the situation could escalate into violence. To earn the trust of Hatuun and his people, Turalyon had the order leader deal with the &lt;a href=\"pit%20lord\"&gt;pit lord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Aggonar\"&gt;Aggonar&lt;/a&gt; and save the Broken at the &lt;a href=\"Annihilan%20Pits\"&gt;Annihilan Pits&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the death of &lt;a href=\"Xe%27ra\"&gt;Xe'ra&lt;/a&gt;, Hatuun requested reinforcements to the &lt;a href=\"Petrified%20Forest\"&gt;Petrified Forest&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Lead%20Rider%20Jerek\"&gt;Lead Rider Jerek&lt;/a&gt; and his wranglers required assistance in recovering their &lt;a href=\"talbuk\"&gt;talbuk&lt;/a&gt; mounts, for they stood no chance against even the smallest of the Legion's forces without them, and also requested a culling of the local &lt;a href=\"panthara\"&gt;panthara&lt;/a&gt;, as they threatened to hunt the wild talbuk down to extinction. After the Forest was secured, Hatuun requested the retaking of &lt;a href=\"Darkfall%20Ridge\"&gt;Darkfall Ridge&lt;/a&gt; in order to rescue his people from &lt;a href=\"Nath%27raxas%20Hold\"&gt;Nath'raxas Hold&lt;/a&gt;, culminating in a rescue mission conducted by &lt;a href=\"Class%20Hall%20followers\"&gt;order followers&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Argussian Reach would provide their support to the war effort for the remainder of the conflict, offering their &lt;a href=\"Krokul%20Ridgestalker%20%28item%29\"&gt;ridgestalkers&lt;/a&gt; in exchange for supplies.\nAfter the draenei won the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20Campaign\"&gt;Argus Campaign&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Lightforged%20draenei\"&gt;Lightforged draenei&lt;/a&gt; pledged themselves to the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Toraan%20the%20Revered\"&gt;Toraan the Revered&lt;/a&gt; is nowhere to be found on the \"&lt;a href=\"Vindicaar\"&gt;Vindicaar&lt;/a&gt;\", and it is unclear what has happened to the remnants of Argus as well as the Broken draenei of Argussian Reach, although Velen mentions that although they found victory, there was \"no salvation\" to be had of their fallen world. Before the \"Vindicaar\" returned to Azeroth, Velen offered Hatuun and his people to rejoin the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;, but they chose to remain on Argus. In time, they accepted the aid of &lt;a href=\"man%27ari%20eredar\"&gt;man'ari eredar&lt;/a&gt; like &lt;a href=\"Arzaal\"&gt;Arzaal&lt;/a&gt;, who sought penitence for their deeds while in service to the Legion.

From his base at &lt;a href=\"Ariden%27s%20Camp\"&gt;Ariden's Camp&lt;/a&gt; in Deadwind Pass, he and his group attempted to cheat &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt; by selling those fraudulent items. Unfortunately for the group, Medivh was possessed by &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; at the time. In revenge for their trickery, Medivh cursed the group to forever hunt real magical artifacts and bring them back to him at &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt;. It is not known exactly what curse Medivh placed on them, or if they are undead or not, but the Dark Riders have haunted the kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, and especially &lt;a href=\"Duskwood\"&gt;Duskwood&lt;/a&gt;, ever since. For years his camp in Deadwind had been left untouched, perhaps out of some remaining humanity. Ariden still kept a journal despite his curse, and is angered when others trespass into the camp.\nSome time after becoming cursed, Ariden was tempted to seek out his legacy, the dread blade &lt;a href=\"Apocalypse\"&gt;Apocalypse&lt;/a&gt;, in its hiding place in the &lt;a href=\"Badlands\"&gt;Badlands&lt;/a&gt;, despite the belief that the merchant he once was had no special bloodline. He was, in truth, the son of a deceased &lt;a href=\"Tirisgarde\"&gt;Tirisgarde&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Laith%20Sha%27ol\"&gt;Laith Sha'ol&lt;/a&gt; who once wielded the blade, but Sha'ol's ghost insisted that Apocalypse must remain buried and that Ariden could not control the unbridled wrath within.\nAriden makes his first appearance when he appears at a gathering of &lt;a href=\"Belysra%20Starbreeze\"&gt;Belysra Starbreeze&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Valorn%20Stillbough\"&gt;Valorn Stillbough&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; to steal the &lt;a href=\"Scythe%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Scythe of Elune&lt;/a&gt;, a relic the Riders had been seeking for some time. After killing Valorn and stealing the weapon, Ariden runs off with the druid in pursuit. Ariden is followed to Karazhan not only by the druid, but also by a &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Revil%20Kost\"&gt;Revil Kost&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt; who had dealt with the Dark Riders before. After they find clues as to his whereabouts at his old camp, Ariden is pursued into the Dark Riders' base of operations beneath Karazhan. He and his Dark Riders hold them off, but despite Ariden even claiming the artifacts that they are after, he is defeated.\n&lt;a href=\"Mile%20Raitheborne\"&gt;Mile Raitheborne&lt;/a&gt; writes in the &lt;a href=\"Tome%20of%20Blighted%20Implements\"&gt;Tome of Blighted Implements&lt;/a&gt; that \"there are conflicting reports about how he met his end,\" which varies depending on the class that is fighting Ariden, and the &lt;a href=\"Artifact\"&gt;Artifact&lt;/a&gt; he is wielding.

She aided her twin sister, &lt;a href=\"Gardrel%20Highmountain\"&gt;Gardrel&lt;/a&gt;, in leading the &lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20Tribe\"&gt;Highmountain Tribe&lt;/a&gt;; rather than divide the tribe or place its well-being in the wrong hands, the previous chieftain had named Gardrel, who was acknowledged to be wiser and a strong diplomat, as the new chieftain, while Arien, who was the greater warrior and had an affinity for the wilds, became the Protector of the Mountain and wielder of Talonclaw. The sisters were happy with their roles, and Arien kept the tribe safe for many years, tapping into the blessing that the &lt;a href=\"Wild%20God\"&gt;Wild God&lt;/a&gt;s had bestowed on the weapon. She was the one to first give it the name \"Talonclaw\", honoring the Wild Gods her ancestors had befriended.\nOne day, Arien and Gardrel encountered a group of &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; called the &lt;a href=\"Unseen%20Path\"&gt;Unseen Path&lt;/a&gt; and led them up the slopes of a nearby mountain. As they approached the summit, Talonclaw began to glow in Arien's hands. As she instinctively held it up to the sky, a cascade of golden energy poured from the spearhead and took the shape of a great eagle. Arien and Gardrel both remembered the lore of their tribe and knew that &lt;a href=\"Ohn%27ahra\"&gt;Ohn'ahra&lt;/a&gt; herself had blessed the site, and they knew that it should be renamed &lt;a href=\"Talon%20Peak\"&gt;Talon Peak&lt;/a&gt;. Together, the tauren and the Unseen Path built the &lt;a href=\"Trueshot%20Lodge\"&gt;Trueshot Lodge&lt;/a&gt; upon the slopes of Talon Peak, where they watched over the land and vowed to be ready for the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s potential return. The elves and the tauren learned much from each other, and Arien eventually joined the Unseen Path, becoming one of its greatest members."}

Instead, the serpent may in fact be seeking vengeance against her.\nArikara, serpent of vengeance.\nRumors have been spreading among the tauren of &lt;a href=\"Freewind%20Post\"&gt;Freewind Post&lt;/a&gt; - a strange, alien egg has been sited in the nests of the &lt;a href=\"Thousand%20Needles%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Thousand Needles&lt;/a&gt; serpents.\n&lt;a href=\"Alien%20Egg%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Alien Egg (quest)&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Hagar%20Lightninghoof\"&gt;Hagar Lightninghoof&lt;/a&gt; has heard of the alien egg, and wants to examine it himself. For this, he seeks your aid - the egg is guarded by serpents in one of their dens, and he cannot leave his post. You agree, and return the egg to him after fighting through its serpent guards.\nBut as Hagar examines the egg, it suddenly breaks apart, and a strange red serpent emerges. The serpent kills a nearby dog and then flies away, out of reach.\n&lt;a href=\"Serpent%20Wild\"&gt;Serpent Wild&lt;/a&gt;\nHagar seems shaken by this event, and makes a cryptic comment that \"Vengeance has come to Thousand Needles!\" He asks you to seek out Motega Firemane to the west for further instructions.\n&lt;a href=\"Sacred%20Fire\"&gt;Sacred Fire&lt;/a&gt;\nMotega does, in fact, know what to do. The creature is called Arikara, a serpent of vengeance, who must be killed swiftly before she gains power. To that end, Motega asks you to gather &lt;a href=\"Incendia%20Agave\"&gt;Incendia Agave&lt;/a&gt; plants from the lake near &lt;a href=\"Darkcloud%20Pinnacle\"&gt;Darkcloud Pinnacle&lt;/a&gt;, then visit &lt;a href=\"Magatha%20Grimtotem\"&gt;Magatha Grimtotem&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt;. With some trepidation, you do so, though you are plagued by steam elementals as you gather the plants.\nWhen you reveal that &lt;a href=\"Arikara\"&gt;Arikara&lt;/a&gt; is abroad, Magatha looks around suspiciously, as if she fears being overheard. She mentions that Arikara is born only to seek vengeance against those who have committed \"heinous acts\". \n&lt;a href=\"Arikara%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Arikara (quest)&lt;/a&gt;\nMotega enchants the &lt;a href=\"Incendia%20Agave\"&gt;Incendia Agave&lt;/a&gt; which you brought to her, and instructs you to throw it on the sacred fire of life in the &lt;a href=\"Grimtotem\"&gt;Grimtotem&lt;/a&gt; village of &lt;a href=\"Darkcloud%20Pinnacle\"&gt;Darkcloud Pinnacle&lt;/a&gt;. In an urgent voice, she adds that &lt;a href=\"Arikara\"&gt;Arikara&lt;/a&gt; may be stalking &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; for his alterations to tauren lore. You head out immediately for &lt;a href=\"Darkcloud%20Pinnacle\"&gt;Darkcloud Pinnacle&lt;/a&gt;.\nGathering a few trusted companions to help in the fight, you battle your way through the &lt;a href=\"Grimtotem\"&gt;Grimtotem&lt;/a&gt; tauren to the sacred fire and throw down the enchanted incendia agave. You don't have to wait long before the serpent appears. She is strong, but with your companions you manage to defeat her.\nYou bring Arikara's skin to Motega Firemane. The tauren looks confused when he hears what Magatha said - he can't understand why Arikara would have been after Cairne. Though now suspicious of the Grimtotem shaman, you gladly claim your reward from Motega, and the matter is, for now, closed.\nRewards.\nIf the player follows the entire quest chain from beginning to end, he or she will receive:"}

He later moves to &lt;a href=\"Chiselgrip\"&gt;Chiselgrip&lt;/a&gt; and finally &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Crest\"&gt;Flame Crest&lt;/a&gt;. He is the son of &lt;a href=\"Eitrigg\"&gt;Eitrigg&lt;/a&gt;.\nFor &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; players, his counterpart is &lt;a href=\"John%20J.%20Keeshan\"&gt;John J. Keeshan&lt;/a&gt;, who offers the Alliance version of his quests.\nBiography.\nAriok is a &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock&lt;/a&gt; by birth and spent a large part of his youth inside &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt;. He doesn't share their goals and objectives. He has befriended and received help from the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Thorium%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Thorium Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; more than once.\nAt some point, he met with &lt;a href=\"Thura\"&gt;Thura&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, Ariok worked closely with his father in order to prevent the Blackrock clan from invading the &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. However, while Ariok respected his father's plan, he served his own sense of justice and believed it was time to end the treachery of the Blackrock clan for good. He enlisted Horde &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to thin the herd and eliminate the leadership of the Blackrock orcs and their allies within the Burning Steppes. The Dark Horde leadership within the Burning Steppes was eliminated in the end, with the culmination of Eitrigg's and Ariok's plan seeing &lt;a href=\"High%20Warlock%20Xi%27lun\"&gt;High Warlock Xi'lun&lt;/a&gt; unable to control the &lt;a href=\"Pitlord\"&gt;Pitlord&lt;/a&gt; he summoned. The uncontrolled pitlord consequently wiped out most of the Blackrock forces.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nAriok was part of the initial Azerothian expedition to and was seen fighting &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde%20Grunt\"&gt;Iron Horde Grunt&lt;/a&gt;s alongside many others at the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tanaan%20Jungle\"&gt;Tanaan Jungle&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"Assault%20on%20the%20Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Assault on the Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, Khadgar tasked him and the adventurers with distracting the Eye of Kilrogg at the Bleeding Altar so the rest of the group could advance without being noticed. However, and the &lt;a href=\"Bleeding%20Hollow%20clan%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Bleeding Hollow Clan&lt;/a&gt; spotted them and prepared to attack the group. Ariok empowered himself with the &lt;a href=\"blood%20magic\"&gt;blood magic&lt;/a&gt; of the Bleeding Hollow and attacked the Warlord in order to buy the rest of the group time to escape.\nFury of Hellfire.\nAriok survived his encounter with Kilrogg and still remains in the form of a hulking berserker. Adventurers follow Ariok into &lt;a href=\"Zeth%27gol\"&gt;Zeth'gol&lt;/a&gt; to discover the Bleeding Hollow Clan's plans. Obtaining Kilrogg's eye would show what and where Kilrogg was, as well as anger the spirits. With Ariok distracting the restless spirits, the adventurer spies on Kilrogg and oddly enough . Kilrogg, panicking that his home is in danger and wants to pull back, is told by Gul'dan that his men need to continue searching for the &lt;a href=\"cipher%20of%20Damnation\"&gt;cipher&lt;/a&gt;. Ariok wanted to know what happened when the adventurer used the eye afterward. Enraged after he was told, he sprinted to Hellfire Citadel to end Kilrogg before he loses everything.\nAriok has been imprisoned in by Kilrogg. Succeeding in keeping him alive when fel substance is pouring into him will result in Ariok becoming a &lt;a href=\"follower\"&gt;follower&lt;/a&gt;. \nDragonflight.\nYears later, Ariok was still afflicted by the blood magic ritual despite the efforts of he and his father to find a cure, causing him to avoid contact with most of the Horde. Although uneasy, he attended the reinvigorated &lt;a href=\"Kosh%27harg\"&gt;Kosh'harg&lt;/a&gt; festival at &lt;a href=\"Razor%20Hill\"&gt;Razor Hill&lt;/a&gt;, wishing to support his father's wishes, and considered asking &lt;a href=\"Jorin%20Deadeye\"&gt;Jorin Deadeye&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Bleeding%20Hollow%20clan\"&gt;Bleeding Hollow&lt;/a&gt; in attendance for help with his form.\nAbilities.\nAs a follower.\nAriok is a Arms Warrior &lt;a href=\"Garrison%20followers\"&gt;Garrison follower&lt;/a&gt; with the following abilities:"}

Harnessing the planet's raw materials, he created these purple crystals as a potent source of &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; energy. The draenei of &lt;a href=\"Azuremyst%20Isle\"&gt;Azuremyst Isle&lt;/a&gt; were eventually able to build back up their own arkonite defense crystals during the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Arkonite%20Crystal\"&gt;Arkonite Crystal&lt;/a&gt;s are used to power everyday items in draenei society.

When the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt; almost wiped out the draenei from Draenor, Velen ordered his artificers to reinforce &lt;a href=\"Telredor\"&gt;Telredor&lt;/a&gt;'s defenses. The draenei smiths constructed a network of arkonite crystals that shrouded the temple's presence from the Horde.\nBy condensing the interstitial channels in the arkonite and by saturating the pressurized cells with &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; magic, the &lt;a href=\"lightforged%20draenei\"&gt;lightforged draenei&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Zuronar\"&gt;Zuronar&lt;/a&gt; created a device capable of expelling considerable luminescent energy when its internal bonds were compromised, which he believed the Azerothian term would be \"flashbang\".\nOn alternate Draenor.\nMost of the arkonite produced by the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; is supplied to and .

Interacting with them gives players the Arkonite Empowerment debuff, which can be then used to gain the &lt;a href=\"Charged%20Up%20%28achievement%29\"&gt;Charged Up (achievement)&lt;/a&gt; achievement.\nAn important source of arkonite is the &lt;a href=\"Jorune%20Mine\"&gt;Jorune Mine&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Talador\"&gt;Talador&lt;/a&gt;. It is also mined from below the mountains of &lt;a href=\"Tanaan%20Jungle\"&gt;Tanaan Jungle&lt;/a&gt;.\nArkonite crystals were used by the draenei in &lt;a href=\"Karabor\"&gt;Karabor&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Defense%20of%20Karabor\"&gt;Defense of Karabor&lt;/a&gt;."}

The adventurer found her in a shack under a bridge in &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar City&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"nightfallen\"&gt;nightfallen&lt;/a&gt; state, and told her the grave news of Arluin's death.\nLater, after &lt;a href=\"Elisande\"&gt;Elisande&lt;/a&gt;'s purge of &lt;a href=\"the%20Waning%20Crescent\"&gt;the Waning Crescent&lt;/a&gt;, Arluelle came to &lt;a href=\"Meredil\"&gt;Meredil&lt;/a&gt;, now restored as a healthy nightborne, mourning her brother's grave. She expressed a wish to repay their kindness and avenge Arluin's death by fighting for the resistance, and the adventurer introduced her to &lt;a href=\"First%20Arcanist%20Thalyssra\"&gt;First Arcanist Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt;, who sent Arluelle to train as a spell-fencer under &lt;a href=\"Silgryn\"&gt;Silgryn&lt;/a&gt;.\nStill later, Arluelle joined Silgryn and the &lt;a href=\"Duskwatch\"&gt;Duskwatch&lt;/a&gt; defector &lt;a href=\"Victoire\"&gt;Victoire&lt;/a&gt; on their plot to free the citizens captured by Elisande's &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt; allies and sent to &lt;a href=\"Felsoul%20Advance\"&gt;Felsoul Advance&lt;/a&gt;, and then to defeat &lt;a href=\"Thoramir\"&gt;Thoramir&lt;/a&gt; and free &lt;a href=\"Vanthir\"&gt;Vanthir&lt;/a&gt; from jail. As the elven armies of the Nightfallen, Alliance and Horde congregate outside the gates of the city at &lt;a href=\"Meredil\"&gt;Meredil&lt;/a&gt;, Silgryn is shown training Arluelle to finesse her swordplay skills.\nFollowing Elisande's demise, she and the other Nightfallen relocated to the &lt;a href=\"Nighthold\"&gt;Nighthold&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuotes.\nMeredil.\nI have learned so much from Silgryn but there is still much I have yet to master.\nI hope it will be enough when the time comes to face Elisande."}

While he is an ally to the rebellion cause he will not lend his services unless he is given equal compensation, the reasons for which are not revealed until his death. He is found within the alleyways of the &lt;a href=\"Evermoon%20Bazaar\"&gt;Evermoon Bazaar&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar City&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nArluin apparently always had a habit of not being able to stay out of trouble but remained close to his sister.\nAfter the public execution of &lt;a href=\"Margaux\"&gt;Margaux&lt;/a&gt;, a friend and sympathizer of the resistance, &lt;a href=\"Vanthir\"&gt;Vanthir&lt;/a&gt; sent the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;class leaders&lt;/a&gt; to Arluin so that he would be able to help in getting revenge for the rebellion, although it's clear the tavern owner doesn't think too highly of Arluin's apparent lack of altruism. Arluin would offer his services as an informant, but he did not come cheap, his first request being a hefty sum of &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Mana\"&gt;Ancient Mana&lt;/a&gt;.\nHis next request was a shipment of &lt;a href=\"Arcwine\"&gt;Arcwine&lt;/a&gt; meant for the &lt;a href=\"Elisande\"&gt;Grand Magistrix&lt;/a&gt;, but with the help of one of his men the adventurer is able to intercept it. His last request for the time being was to keep his stash of contraband from being taken, with the death of &lt;a href=\"Auditor%20Yvenne\"&gt;Auditor Yvenne&lt;/a&gt; preventing the location from being revealed.\nWith his compensation filled, Arluin was able to find the home of &lt;a href=\"Overseer%20Durant\"&gt;Overseer Durant&lt;/a&gt;, the murderer responsible for the death of Margaux, but the adventurer would need help taking him down so Arluin gave the names of three associates: &lt;a href=\"Cyrille\"&gt;Cyrille&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lorin\"&gt;Lorin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sylessa\"&gt;Sylessa&lt;/a&gt;. With their help, Durant was finally killed, and Margaux avenged.\nWith &lt;a href=\"Ly%27leth%20Lunastre\"&gt;Ly'leth Lunastre&lt;/a&gt; in the running to become an advisor to the Grand Magistrix in order to help the resistance, she would need undercover help as her supporters would not be enough, and so Vanthir called for Arluin's services yet again, who required an even higher payment of Ancient Mana. Arluin tasked the adventurer to deal with the two noble Houses that were the biggest threat: kill the &lt;a href=\"felborne\"&gt;felborne&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ruven\"&gt;Ruven Duskmere&lt;/a&gt;, then spread rumors among the grieving House Duskmere nobles to redirect the suspicion to &lt;a href=\"Coryn%20Stelleris\"&gt;Coryn Stelleris&lt;/a&gt;. These efforts eventually culminated in the honor duel between Coryn and Ly'leth, with the latter walking away as the new advisor.\nArluin reappears one last time to lend his services (with payment to be received afterward) to Thalyssra and the adventurer in the &lt;a href=\"Arcway\"&gt;Arcway&lt;/a&gt;, in order to create a critical surge in the leylines to feed the &lt;a href=\"arcan%27dor\"&gt;arcan'dor&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Shal%27Aran\"&gt;Shal'Aran&lt;/a&gt;. As the trio head through the tunnels to the &lt;a href=\"Nightflow%20Conduit\"&gt;Nightflow Conduit&lt;/a&gt;, Arluin picked the lock for a door that they needed to get through. When Thalyssra tries to activate the &lt;a href=\"Ephemeral%20Manastorm%20Projector\"&gt;Ephemeral Manastorm Projector&lt;/a&gt;, she realizes that its fuse, which acts as a timer, is broken. Forced to turn it on manually, Thalyssra puts up a barrier to wait out the manastorm, but over time it only begins increasing in power. Seeing no other choice, Arluin runs out of Thalyssra's protective barrier and deactivates the projector himself, the manastorm injuring him fatally. After Oculeth teleports the trio back to &lt;a href=\"Meredil\"&gt;Meredil&lt;/a&gt;, Thalyssra checks on Arluin, who is gratified to know they succeeded before he dies moments later. Through his sacrifice, the arcan'dor would get the proper arcane energy it needed, causing it to grow fruit.\nIn the event of his death, Arluin had written a last will and given it to Vanthir, which read that any rewards for his efforts were to be given to a woman named &lt;a href=\"Arluelle\"&gt;Arluelle&lt;/a&gt;, and mapped out where she could be found. Stating that Arluin had likely known what the end result of his sacrifice would mean for the nightborne, Vanthir admits that he was wrong about him.\nThe adventurer found Arluelle in Suramar City, gave her the arcan'dor fruit and explained that Arluin had given his life for it.\nInsurrection.\nArluin's sacrifice would never be forgotten. Arluelle, now a healthy nightborne, reveals herself as his sister. She joins the rebels to avenge Arluin and to repay for the new chance at life she had been given, she kneels in front of a small memorial, where her brother's body rests."}

It was originally announced that the comic would subsequently split off into two titles: one &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;-centric and the other &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;-centric. These eventually became the graphic novels \"&lt;a href=\"Bloodsworn\"&gt;Bloodsworn&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Riders%20%28comic%29\"&gt;Dark Riders&lt;/a&gt;\", respectively.\nDescription.\nThe bonus-sized epic final showdown! Will &lt;a href=\"Med%27an\"&gt;Med'an&lt;/a&gt; and the newly formed &lt;a href=\"New%20Council%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Council of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt; vanquish the evil &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;? Will the unlikely union of &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; be torn asunder?\nPlot.\nFrom within &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt;'s shattered &lt;a href=\"mage%20tower\"&gt;mage tower&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina&lt;/a&gt; teleports herself, Med'an, and the council \u2014 &lt;a href=\"Broll%20Bearmantle\"&gt;Broll&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dalynnia%20Wrathscar\"&gt;Dalynnia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hamuul%20Runetotem\"&gt;Hamuul&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vindicator%20Maraad\"&gt;Maraad&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rehgar%20Earthfury\"&gt;Rehgar&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"High%20Priest%20Rohan\"&gt;Rohan&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 to a ledge floating in the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;, where they can induct Med'an as &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Meryl%20Felstorm\"&gt;Meryl&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Valeera%20Sanguinar\"&gt;Valeera&lt;/a&gt; remain behind on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Valeera blames herself for Meryl's possession by &lt;a href=\"Kathra%27natir\"&gt;Kathra'natir&lt;/a&gt;, which prevents him from joining the council, but he comments that he has come to prefer action rather than spending the battle in protected meditation like the council will. Meryl uses Kathra'natir's power to teleport himself, Aegwynn, and Valeera to &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt; to meet up with &lt;a href=\"Garona%20Halforcen\"&gt;Garona&lt;/a&gt; and aid Med'an during the battle.\nIn the Nether, the council performs the ritual to infuse Med'an with their combined powers. The new Guardian thanks the council for their trust before teleporting to Ahn'Qiraj to face &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn Ahn'Qiraj, Cho'gall calls on his &lt;a href=\"anubisath\"&gt;anubisath&lt;/a&gt;s (who will serve as lenses for the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;'s power) and &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt;s, and orders the Twilight's Hammer to unfurl their banners and declare themselves to the world.\nA &lt;a href=\"lava%20elemental\"&gt;lava elemental&lt;/a&gt; takes up guard duty in &lt;a href=\"C%27Thun\"&gt;C'Thun&lt;/a&gt;'s chamber while Garona continues trudging through the Old God's corpse in search of the base of &lt;a href=\"Atiesh%2C%20Greatstaff%20of%20the%20Guardian\"&gt;Atiesh&lt;/a&gt;. Upon finding it, she follows Meryl's instructions and wraps it in a cloth.\nMeryl, Aegwynn, and Valeera arrive on a platform overlooking the area where Cho'gall is standing. Meryl comments that they'll need the base of Atiesh if they want to help Med'an against Cho'gall, explaining that while the object is filled with &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; energy, Med'an's blood, knowledge, and powers will overcome the taint. Meryl scries for Garona's location and notices that she's about to emerge with the base into C'Thun's chamber, which is still guarded by the elemental. Valeera immediately heads over to help, pushing Garona out of the way of the elemental's fists just as she exits C'Thun's body. The elemental proceeds to accidentally bring the chamber ceiling crashing down on itself, allowing Garona and Valeera to head outside just as Med'an arrives in front of Cho'gall. The ogre notices Garona and Valeera's presence, followed by Aegwynn and Meryl, and in typical fashion gloats at what useless allies Med'an has chosen.\nCho'gall and Med'an attack each other with magic. Cho'gall notes Med'an's increased power, which he'll channel to blast his master free after the boy has been slain. The ogre begins his great ceremony, focusing power through his anubisaths and chanting in the &lt;a href=\"Shath%27Yar\"&gt;language of the Old Gods&lt;/a&gt; while sending the elementals to attack Aegwynn and Meryl. Aegwynn tells her grandson to ignore them and focus on the anubisaths, but Med'an refuses to abandon his friends and summons blasts of lightning to destroy the elementals. This distraction gives Cho'gall time to finish his ritual, making him a conduit for his master's power and causing him to unleash devastating storms in various locations across Azeroth in an attempt to tear apart the very earth that holds the Old God prisoner.\nIn response, Med'an calls on the council's power to create a ward around Cho'gall, trapping his power in Ahn'Qiraj but also sending deadly bolts of magic ricocheting around the area. Garona and Valeera climb up to where Meryl has summoned a shield for himself and Aegwynn.\nCho'gall gloats that Med'an's ward merely concentrates his master's power. The ogre unleashes his magic against the Guardian, who throws up a shield of his own. The two adversaries reach a stalemate, but Cho'gall points out that Med'an's resources are finite and he will inevitably weaken. Hearing this, Garona wants to try to end the battle there and then and unwraps the base of Atiesh. Kathra'natir is immediately drawn to the surfeit of fel power in the object and tries to reach for it. Meryl has to focus on controlling the demon to pull him back, causing his shield to dissipate and leaving Aegwynn, Garona, and Valeera exposed to Cho'gall's magic. Moments later, Aegwynn is hit by one of the richocheting energy bolts, mortally wounding her. Meryl regains control of Kathra'natir and \u2014 in a bid to stop the &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; from claiming the artifact \u2014 offers himself as a conduit for Atiesh's power, channeling the staff's energy into Med'an. Med'an purifies the staff's magic of its fel taint and unleashes a blinding wave of energy at Cho'gall.\nHowever, Meryl collapses from the effort, releasing Kathra'natir's spirit. The dreadlord tries to reach for Med'an but finds that the boy is too strong to approach. He instead sets his sights on the stream of power flowing from the council to the Guardian and follows the torrent to its source in the Twisting Nether, where he begins to block the flow of power and absorb it into himself while the council are busy with their ritual.\nWith the council's power cut off from him, Med'an is easily knocked aside by Cho'gall, who muses that Kathra'natir has done him a great service and will be spared for last as a reward. The ogre begins conjuring a huge orb of magic to send crashing down on Med'an. The exhausted Meryl hands the base of Atiesh to Garona. Aegwynn points out that the base still glows even with its fel power gone as a result of &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;her son&lt;/a&gt; pouring a greater magic into it. Her blood tells her that it is Med'an's legacy and will answer to his touch alone. Garona heads for Med'an with the base in hand but is struck down by one of Cho'gall's bolts.\nMeanwhile in the Nether, Kathra'natir drains Dalynnia's magic from her body and tosses her corpse off the ledge.\nBack in Ahn'Qiraj, Valeera runs over to help Garona and tells Meryl to do something about Kathra'natir. Meryl laments that his arrogance brought the dreadlord into the battle and now the demon has slipped beyond his control. Aegwynn crawls over to Meryl and tells him that they need to buy time for the council to defeat the Kathra'natir. She states that she is dying and asks Meryl to channel her remaining life energy into Med'an to strengthen him until Garona and Valeera can reach him and the council can win their victory. Meryl initially refuses, but Aegwynn insists, saying that her death will atone for her old sins by striking a blow for Azeroth and saving her grandson. Meryl relents and channels Aegwynn's remaining strength into her grandson. With her last breath, the chamberlain thanks her dear friend for the deed. Med'an senses his grandmother's death and uses the influx of power to strike back against Cho'gall.\nIn the Nether, the council trap Kathra'natir by linking their powers and replicating the ward technique that Med'an used earlier. Jaina senses Aegwynn's sacrifice, but Rehgar reminds her and the other council members that they need to resume their meditations immediately.\nIn Ahn'Qiraj, Garona and Valeera are only a few steps away from Med'an when they're suddenly struck down by Cho'gall, who begins to reach for the base of Atiesh but is interrupted when Valeera jumps up on him and stabs him in the hand. He easily knocks her aside, but the brief distraction gives enough time for Med'an to grab hold of the base. In his hands, the base immediately transforms into the restored Greatstaff of the Guardian. Through it, he channels the council's combined strength to unleash a final burst of magic against Cho'gall, blasting him into a nearby structure and burying him under the rubble. Throughout Ahn'Qiraj, the anubisaths crumble into dust.\nWith the battle over, Med'an tends to Garona and the unconscious Valeera. Broll, Hamuul, Jaina, Maraad, Rehgar, and Rohan arrive through a portal from the Nether with the imprisoned Kathra'natir while Meryl arrives carrying Aegwynn's body in his arms. Jaina is devastated at Aegwynn's death, but Med'an offers comfort by saying that his grandmother will live on through him and never be forgotten. Meryl states that he is no longer Winterstorm but Felstorm and that he needs to depart soon, as his presence pollutes the council. He continues that Kathra'natir knows too much of the council to be allowed to roam the Nether. Med'an agrees and reluctantly channels the dreadlord's spirit back into Meryl. The Guardian turns to council members, thanking them for letting him see the world through their eyes and showing him how much he still has to learn, before channeling his powers back into them. Rohan states that while many council members have pressing business back home, Aegwynn was an old friend and he would see to her final rest.\nMeryl, Med'an, Jaina, Garona, Valeera, Broll, Hamuul, Maraad, Rehgar, and Rohan bury Aegwynn at &lt;a href=\"Morgan%27s%20Plot\"&gt;Morgan's Plot&lt;/a&gt; west of &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt;; when Aegwynn gave her life force to Med'an, he sensed her final wish that she be buried next to her son. After a moment of silence, Meryl tells Med'an that he'll begin his exile by hunting down the remaining Twilight's Hammer. Garona reveals that she'll be going with Meryl, until perhaps Valeera manages to convince &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian&lt;/a&gt; to call off his hunt for the &lt;a href=\"half-orc\"&gt;half-orc&lt;/a&gt;. Med'an protests, but Garona tells her son that he's best off studying the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; with Maraad. She continues that she owes Meryl more than she can ever repay him and that the Twilight's Hammer remain a threat. However, Cho'gall \u2014 the last being on Azeroth who held sway over Garona \u2014 is no more, and &lt;a href=\"Merely%20a%20setback\"&gt;for now, at least&lt;/a&gt;, they have won."}

He does not hit very hard, aside from his fire-based attacks, which can be easily avoided or interrupted.\nWhen you first engage it Armagedillo will immediately charge to melee range if you were not already within five yards of it. Even on cloth, Armagedillo only melees for about 3,000 damage. Every few seconds he will start to cast one of his fire attacks, which can be easily avoided by moving out of the way during their cast time. Flame Breath will hit for several thousand fire damage. The only attack Armagedillo has that is of any real concern is \"Dillogeddon\", where it will stand on its hind legs for four seconds before slamming back down, releasing huge gouts of flame in the area surrounding itself. Dillogeddon hits for considerable amounts of fire damage, so it is probably advisable to run out of its ten-yard radius when Armagedillo begins to cast it. Otherwise, Armagedillo is an easy kill.\nLoot.\nArmagedillo will only drop one piece of loot:\nHe can also be skinned by &lt;a href=\"Skinning\"&gt;Skinners&lt;/a&gt; of the appropriate skill level.\nIn Hearthstone.\nArmagedillo appears as for the warrior class in the \"\" expansion for \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\". In \"Hearthstone\" lore, the creature has been outfitted with advanced weaponry by &lt;a href=\"Dr.%20Boom%23In%20Hearthstone\"&gt;Blastmaster Boom&lt;/a&gt;, making it even deadlier than before. Armagedillo's flavor text reads: \"We may never know what provoked it, but we will never forget the consequences.\""}

{"id": "14823", "revid": "22514", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=14823", "title": "Armor", "text": "Armor is a term that may refer to the Armor &lt;a href=\"attribute\"&gt;attribute&lt;/a&gt;, or items which mitigate physical damage.\nArmor is a class of &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s that mitigate physical &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt; and are &lt;a href=\"equip\"&gt;equip&lt;/a&gt;ped in the different armor &lt;a href=\"slot\"&gt;slot&lt;/a&gt;s (head, shoulder, back, chest (aka body), wrist, hands, waist, legs, feet, and &lt;a href=\"Off%20Hand\"&gt;off-hand&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"shield\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt;). This sort of armor contributes to the &lt;a href=\"Attributes%23Armor\"&gt;Armor&lt;/a&gt; attribute, a numerical value that translates into physical &lt;a href=\"damage%20mitigation\"&gt;damage mitigation&lt;/a&gt; in combat. Some non-armor items may grant a &lt;a href=\"Attributes%23Defense\"&gt;Defense&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"attribute\"&gt;attribute&lt;/a&gt; bonus.\nArmor types.\nFour armor types are available for &lt;a href=\"Player\"&gt;Player&lt;/a&gt; characters to &lt;a href=\"equip\"&gt;equip&lt;/a&gt;:\nClasses can wear any tier of armor that falls below their own; for example, a level 40 Warrior can wear Plate, but can also wear Mail, Leather, and Cloth pieces.\nAdditionally, shields can be equipped by certain classes.\nArmor equipment slots.\nThere are nine core slots that a character can equip armor items into and \u2014 depending on their &lt;a href=\"class\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 a character can optionally carry a &lt;a href=\"shield\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt; in their &lt;a href=\"off-hand\"&gt;off-hand&lt;/a&gt;. The nine slots for equipping armor to are the character's , , , (aka body), , , , , and . If a shield is held in the off hand the character is limited to using weapons that require only one hand to use.\n\"Note: There are rings, necklaces, trinkets, off-hand items, and weapons that provide armor; certain spells and profession-based items can provide temporary armor bonuses as well.\"\nDamage absorption.\nArmor augments a character's health to a higher number (if the armor is positive), which represents the amount of physical damage a player can withstand. For instance, a character with 5000 health and 50% armor would be able to absorb 10000 damage before dying.\nThe formula for determining damage absorption is:\nDA = (player health) / (1 - (% &lt;a href=\"damage%20reduction\"&gt;damage reduction&lt;/a&gt; given by armor in decimal form).\nFor example, a character with 1000 health and 31.24% damage reduction would be able to absorb 1000 / (1 - .3124) = 1454 (rounded) damage.\nA character with 1000 health and 99.98 damage reduction would be able to absorb 1000 / (1 -. 9998) = 500,000 damage.\nDamage absorption only applies to physical damage.\nArmor damage reduction formula.\nAccording to the Blizzard UI elements (&lt;a href=\"http%3A//wowprogramming.com/utils/xmlbrowser/test/FrameXML/PaperDollFrame.lua\"&gt;PaperDollFrame.lua&lt;/a&gt;), the formulas for damage reduction are as follows for WoW 5.0.4 in which Attacker = either player or mob.\ncodice_1\ncodice_2\ncodice_3\ncodice_4\nSimplified, the formula becomes: codice_5\nConsider the following table which can be derived from the above formula for a lvl 70 tank taking 1000 DPS of \"raw\" damage:\nAs can be seen, the effectiveness of adding another 5k of armor is getting lower, there is a \"diminishing returns\" effect with respect to the DPS reduction. It isn't as pronounced as it may seem looking at the absolute numbers, though. The last line shows that the relative value of 5k armor drops from 33% to 13%, meaning that at the start, one point of AC will be about three times as effective in terms of DPS reduction as near the end. Thus, armor exhibits diminishing returns with respect to the total amount of healing needed to keep a tank alive.\nThe following is the same formula for a lvl 80 tank against a level 83 mob\nHowever, in terms of absolute time to live with respect to melee attacks, armor has no diminishing return effect. Given a constant melee DPS amount, each additional point of armor (whether it be from 0 to 1 or from 30000 to 30001) will increase the tank's time to live by the same effective amount. 1k additional armor increases time to live by approximately 9.47% (6.01% at level 80??), as shown by the graph. The formula for calculating time to live with respect to melee attacks is:\nWhere DR% is calculated according to the above formula. In this way, armor can be thought of as increasing the effective health of the tank with respect to melee attacks. Since DR caps at 75%, effective time to live caps at 400% of the tanks base time to live (time to live if the tank had no armor).\nPrior to hitting the cap, armor is certainly a very desirable stat for tanks, but difficult to find. Most items of similar quality and rarity have similar armor values, and extra armor can be found only very rarely.\nArmor caps.\nThe armor caps for various attackers are as follows:"}

The Sporemound was killed by the Apexis superweapon, the &lt;a href=\"Breath%20of%20Rukhmar\"&gt;Breath of Rukhmar&lt;/a&gt;, forever destroying the &lt;a href=\"Evergrowth\"&gt;Evergrowth&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nWhen the powerful &lt;a href=\"treant\"&gt;treant&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Gnarlgar\"&gt;Gnarlgar&lt;/a&gt; eventually became aware of the &lt;a href=\"arakkoa\"&gt;arakkoa&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;a href=\"Apexis\"&gt;Apexis&lt;/a&gt; civilization, it saw them as an immense affront to nature and an even greater threat than the &lt;a href=\"breakers\"&gt;breakers&lt;/a&gt;. Gnarlgar departed its home in &lt;a href=\"Terokkar%20Forest\"&gt;Talador&lt;/a&gt; in search of a weapon to use against the Apexis, and discovered a massive fossilized root - one of the last remaining intact pieces of the Sporemound &lt;a href=\"Botaan\"&gt;Botaan&lt;/a&gt;'s body. The treant returned to Talador and rallied its &lt;a href=\"botani\"&gt;botani&lt;/a&gt; followers, telling them that they would use the root to craft a new Sporemound, greater than any that had come before it, to cast the Apexis from their lofty spire. Gnarlgar planted the root deep within Talador and began a great ritual to nourish it. Thousands of botani willingly sacrificed themselves, and Gnarlgar infused their spirits into the root. Gradually, leaves and branches sprouted from the earth and grew into a mound of thorny brambles and leathery fronds. Gnarlgar named the burgeoning Sporemound Taala. Meanwhile, the primals prepared for war, awakening new &lt;a href=\"genesaur\"&gt;genesaur&lt;/a&gt; from their birthing pools while Gnarlgar channeled the &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20of%20Life\"&gt;Spirit of Life&lt;/a&gt; into the forest to gift thousands of trees with intelligence, naming them the &lt;a href=\"Gnarled\"&gt;Gnarled&lt;/a&gt;. Tens of thousands of primals gathered in Talador to await Taala's awakening.\nThe Apexis initially ignored the stirrings in Talador, believing them to be part of the war between the breakers and primals, but began to worry when the few scouts that returned described armies of living trees, botani and genesaur, as well as a monstrous creature that was already larger than a genesaur. The leaders of the Anhari and Skalaxi orders quickly mobilized the Apexis into an invasion force and struck at the heart of Talador, ignoring the other primals and focusing solely on destroying Taala. Brutal fighting erupted between the arakkoa and the primals, but despite the magic powers at their command, the Apexis could not break the primals. Gnarlgar entered a trance that allowed it to touch the minds of the primals and coordinate their movements, driving the arakkoa back into the skies. Nearly half of the Apexis forces had fallen, but the Anhar order proposed a solution. Its priests had devised an ingenious weapon, the &lt;a href=\"Breath%20of%20Rukhmar\"&gt;Breath of Rukhmar&lt;/a&gt;, that could channel the energies of the sun to devastating effect. As the Anhari began work on the device, Gnarlgar quickened Taala's maturation, ordering more botani to sacrifice themselves so that the Sporemound could be awakened before the arakkoa could regroup.\nFinally, Taala stirred. Giant fronds unfurled around it, and the Sporemound rose up to its full height, towering over the forest canopy. The monstrous thorn-skinned creature took its first step, and the forests trembled with awe. Gnarlgar entered a trance once again to reach out its mind to Taala and the other primals to order them to march upon the Apexis. The Apexis realized they could not complete their weapon in time, but a small number of Skalaxi sorcerers volunteered to assassinate the primals' leader. They shrouded themselves in shadow and stalked through the forests until they found Gnarlgar, but the treant sensed their presence and quickly disposed of them, though not before the sorcerers had managed to cast a withering curse upon the treant. Gnarlgar's roots and boughs rotted and withered until it collapsed beside its assassins. Gnarlgar's death sent the primals into disarray, and for a time they halted at the edge of &lt;a href=\"Spires%20of%20Arak\"&gt;Arak&lt;/a&gt; before resuming their march, but the delay had been enough for the arakkkoa to complete their work. Just as Taala reached the spire, the Anhari ignited the weapon. A violent tremor shook the spire as solar energies roared through it and a white-hot beam exploded from the mechanism to lance through Taala's chest, blowing it apart in a cloud of spores and ash. The Breath of Rukhmar sliced through the botani, genesaur, and Gnarled, incinerating thousands in an instant. The few that survived retreated to Talador in terror, but they were engulfed in flames by the Anhari. The forests that had crept into Arak were seared away. Once the attack was halted, blackened earth and smoldering roots stretched as far as the eye could see. The &lt;a href=\"Evergrowth\"&gt;Evergrowth&lt;/a&gt; had been annihilated forever and would never return again."}

{"id": "14988", "revid": "3154973", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=14988", "title": "Tabard", "text": "A tabard refers to a type of &lt;a href=\"clothing\"&gt;clothing&lt;/a&gt; bearing a symbol or design and worn in the tabard &lt;a href=\"equipment%20slot\"&gt;equipment slot&lt;/a&gt; over a character's chest armor. Originally a purely cosmetic item intended to add individuality to a character's look, similar to a &lt;a href=\"shirt\"&gt;shirt&lt;/a&gt;, they now often signal an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; is championing a cause and thus offer &lt;a href=\"reputation\"&gt;reputation&lt;/a&gt; for wearing one in a &lt;a href=\"dungeon\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt;.\nOverview.\nHistorically, a tabard serves both as a sleeveless shirt or coat (often over armor), and as a means of displaying heraldry (as ). For players, it can show membership in a guild or (for roleplay purposes) allegiance to a particular group, boast of deeds performed, or simply be decorative.\nThe only tabard available to players upon the release of \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" was the &lt;a href=\"guild\"&gt;guild&lt;/a&gt; tabard. The release of &lt;a href=\"battleground\"&gt;battleground&lt;/a&gt;s and the &lt;a href=\"honor%20system\"&gt;honor system&lt;/a&gt; saw a variety of new tabards introduced, identifying a player's &lt;a href=\"rank\"&gt;rank&lt;/a&gt; or standing with a particular battleground &lt;a href=\"faction\"&gt;faction&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20Invasion\"&gt;Scourge Invasion&lt;/a&gt; also added a small number of tabards. In ', each faction in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; was given its own tabard, available at status. ' continues this trend, but has lower (or no) reputation requirements and instead utilizes faction tabards in a system known as &lt;a href=\"championing\"&gt;championing&lt;/a&gt; for farming &lt;a href=\"reputation\"&gt;reputation&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Patch%203.0.2\"&gt;Patch 3.0.2&lt;/a&gt; introduced the &lt;a href=\"achievement\"&gt;achievement&lt;/a&gt; system, which includes rewards for tabard collectors. The following &lt;a href=\"Collections%20achievements\"&gt;Collections achievements&lt;/a&gt; are granted for obtaining 1, 10, 25 and 30 tabards respectively: &lt;a href=\"Represent\"&gt;Represent&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ten%20Tabards\"&gt;Ten Tabards&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Twenty-Five%20Tabards\"&gt;Twenty-Five Tabards&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thirty%20Tabards\"&gt;Thirty Tabards&lt;/a&gt;, with the Twenty-Five Tabards achievement granting the &lt;a href=\"Tabard%20of%20the%20Achiever\"&gt;Tabard of the Achiever&lt;/a&gt;. Blizzard has voiced a desire to alleviate the amount of bag space taken up by tabards as has been done with &lt;a href=\"mount\"&gt;mount&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Companion\"&gt;non-combat pet&lt;/a&gt; collections (which grant similar achievements), but has said that tabards with on-use effects are an issue. However, \"keeping\" tabards is not required for the achievement; only equipping them. You can equip and sell or delete each tabard as you get it, and it will still count toward the achievement. Some tabards can be discarded and repurchased or reacquired at a tabard vendor. These generally include rewards from non-repeatable quests and achievements (such as the &lt;a href=\"Green%20Trophy%20Tabard%20of%20the%20Illidari\"&gt;Green Trophy Tabard of the Illidari&lt;/a&gt;).\nReputation.\nThroughout ', tabards were ways to exhibit the fact that you had achieved Exalted reputation with the various factions. When ' was released, tabards changed modes. The Northrend faction tabards were purchasable at Friendly reputation and enabled players to gain reputation while defeating monsters in high-level dungeons.\nNorthrend faction tabards award reputation while defeating monsters in Northrend heroic-mode dungeons and a few normal dungeons that had been tuned for level 80 characters.\nIn \"\", the city tabards that had been introduced with the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Tournament\"&gt;Argent Tournament&lt;/a&gt; were given reputation-enhancing abilities as well. The various factions introduced with Cataclysm also had tabards which could be used to gain reputation by defeating monsters in high-level Cataclysm dungeons.\nTabard vendors.\nThere are, generally, two types of vendor that tabards can be purchased from.\nTabards associated with a faction are almost always available from the &lt;a href=\"Quartermaster\"&gt;Quartermaster&lt;/a&gt;s for that faction.\n&lt;a href=\"Visitor%27s%20Center\"&gt;Visitor's Center&lt;/a&gt;s in most major cities have tabard vendors who sell Guild tabards. They also sell:\nThese additional tabards have the same purchase restrictions and costs from the visitor's center vendor as they do from the relevant quartermaster.\nGuild tabards.\nGuild tabards can be purchased for from a &lt;a href=\"guildmaster\"&gt;guildmaster&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Visitor%27s%20Center\"&gt;Visitor's Center&lt;/a&gt; of any faction capital &lt;a href=\"city\"&gt;city&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Guild%20leader\"&gt;Guild leader&lt;/a&gt;s can customize the symbol and color scheme of the guild's tabard for .\nSee &lt;a href=\"%23External%20links\"&gt;below&lt;/a&gt; for web-based tabard design tools.\nOnce your tabard crest has been created, it will take another every time you wish to make a change to it.\nHonor rank tabards.\nHonor &lt;a href=\"Ranking\"&gt;rank&lt;/a&gt; tabards are an &lt;a href=\"honor%20reward\"&gt;honor reward&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt; fighting under the &lt;a href=\"Honor%20System\"&gt;Honor System&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"battleground\"&gt;battleground&lt;/a&gt;s).\nEnlisted tabards were available for at &lt;a href=\"Ranking\"&gt;rank&lt;/a&gt; one &lt;a href=\"Private%20%28Legacy%29\"&gt;Private (Legacy)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Scout%20%28Legacy%29\"&gt;Scout (Legacy)&lt;/a&gt;).\n&lt;a href=\"Private%27s%20Tabard\"&gt;Private's Tabard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Scout%27s%20Tabard\"&gt;Scout's Tabard&lt;/a&gt; are purchasable from all tabard vendors (except &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;'s) for . \nOfficers' tabards were available for at &lt;a href=\"Ranking\"&gt;rank&lt;/a&gt; six &lt;a href=\"Knight%20%28Legacy%29\"&gt;Knight (Legacy)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Guard%20%28Legacy%29\"&gt;Stone Guard (Legacy)&lt;/a&gt;). Somewhat more glorified, these look similar to the enlisted tabards, but are significantly more detailed.\nSimilarly, these tabards are now purchasable for .\nBattleground tabards.\nBattleground tabards can be obtained at various reputation with each faction through vendor purchase or quest completion. These tabards have a unique appearance.\n&lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Valley\"&gt;Alterac Valley&lt;/a&gt; tabards are purchasable from all tabard vendors (except Dalaran's) and the Supply Officers at the entrance to either BG for . \n&lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Basin\"&gt;Arathi Basin&lt;/a&gt; tabards are available upon attaining reputation with &lt;a href=\"League%20of%20Arathor\"&gt;League of Arathor&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Defilers\"&gt;Defilers&lt;/a&gt; and completing &lt;a href=\"Control%20Five%20Bases\"&gt;Control Five Bases&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Take%20Five%20Bases\"&gt;Take Five Bases&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Gulch\"&gt;Warsong Gulch&lt;/a&gt; tabards are purchasable from all tabard vendors (except Dalaran's) and the Supply Officers at the entrance to either BG for .\nThe &lt;a href=\"Tabard%20of%20Conquest\"&gt;Tabard of Conquest&lt;/a&gt; is awarded to players who complete the &lt;a href=\"Master%20of%20Isle%20of%20Conquest\"&gt;Master of Isle of Conquest&lt;/a&gt; achievement.\nArena tabards.\nDuring the Relentless, Furious and Wrathful seasons, arena tabards appropriate to the current season could be obtained from arena vendors upon earning a sufficiently high arena/battleground rating, and had a unique appearance. Arena tabards were removed from the game in &lt;a href=\"patch%204.1\"&gt;patch 4.1&lt;/a&gt;.\nPast event tabards.\nThese tabards were available for a limited time, and cannot be obtained currently. Some of these tabards may be reacquired from tabard vendors if the player had previously owned them.\nThe Burning Crusade tabards.\n\"Unless otherwise stated, reputation with the respective faction is needed to purchase their tabard. These faction tabards are purchased from the faction's quartermaster for , after discount.\nWrath of the Lich King tabards.\nThe Argent Tournament Tabards are available from each faction once you become their Champion. They each cost .\nWith the release of Cataclysm the faction city tabards are also available for purchase from vendors in the capital cities (for ) and enable reputation gains in dungeons.\nUnobtainable tabards.\nThese tabards are worn by NPCs but cannot be obtained by players, though some can be approximated with certain guild tabard designs."}

According to Omi, Tacha loves cursed idols and can turn soul-filled &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20golem\"&gt;golem&lt;/a&gt; eyes into \"hilarious little bombs\".\nWhen an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; arrives at the Court of Zak'rajan, Tacha asks them to investigate the &lt;a href=\"Malfunctioning%20Golem\"&gt;Malfunctioning Golem&lt;/a&gt; and discover the power source of the golems that roam the ruins. After the adventurer discovers that the golems are powered by &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; souls, Tacha is unfazed and gives the hero a soulcatcher totem to siphon the souls off of the ruin defenders. Finally, she accompanies Kenzou, Omi, and the adventurer in confronting &lt;a href=\"Zak%27rajan%20the%20Undying\"&gt;Zak'rajan the Undying&lt;/a&gt; and uses the soulcatcher totem to unleash a barrage of spirits that destroy Zak'rajan's barrier.

A former member of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;, became a high-ranking member of the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, though he remained unaware of the true scale of the atrocities committed by the Crusade.\nHis father eventually helped him see the truth during the &lt;a href=\"In%20Dreams\"&gt;In Dreams&lt;/a&gt; questline. Though Taelan was killed by &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Inquisitor%20Isillien\"&gt;Grand Inquisitor Isillien&lt;/a&gt;, his death motivated his father to reorganize the Silver Hand, eventually leading to the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nOf Blood and Honor.\nOn his 7th birthday Taelan received a toy hammer from his father. When he was young, he and his parents would often visit &lt;a href=\"Caer%20Darrow\"&gt;Caer Darrow&lt;/a&gt;. Once, &lt;a href=\"Artist%20Renfray\"&gt;Artist Renfray&lt;/a&gt; painted a family portrait.\nHe was over joyed when his father awake from his slumber after his fight with the orc &lt;a href=\"Eitrigg\"&gt;Eitrigg&lt;/a&gt;. After &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion&lt;/a&gt; sought out the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; hermit Eitrigg and conversed with him he was convinced the orc knew honor, but his wife &lt;a href=\"Karandra%20Fordring\"&gt;Karandra&lt;/a&gt; disagreed. The two then got into a fight when Tirion told their son Taelan that not all orcs were bad, and that the good ones were just harder to find. Karandra however was very stuck in the idea that orcs were evil and should all be killed, a very traditional and common view. When Tirion was eventually &lt;a href=\"Excommunication\"&gt;excommunicated&lt;/a&gt; and exiled for attacking &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; soldiers and refusing to break the promise he made to the orc, Karandra didn't go with him for Taelan's sake. Tirion left him a note. She told their son that Tirion had died, and took him to a false grave at the &lt;a href=\"Undercroft\"&gt;Undercroft&lt;/a&gt;, where Taelan buried the toy warhammer his father had given him, and the memory of this father, forever.\nFifteen years later, Taelan had become a paladin and during this time frame was noted to have become good friends with &lt;a href=\"Arden\"&gt;Arden&lt;/a&gt;. He knew about his father's trial.\nThe Ashbringer.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; swept through &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; he offered the rest of the Silver Hand's paladins shelter in Hearthglen and then joined the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; to help fight back the undead, one of the target being &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;. Blind to the atrocities committed by the Crusade, Taelan rose through their ranks under the tutelage of &lt;a href=\"Saidan%20Dathrohan\"&gt;Saidan Dathrohan&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt some point, he fought in &lt;a href=\"Northdale\"&gt;Northdale&lt;/a&gt; against the Scourge. It was there that he renounced the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Order of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Renault%20Mograine\"&gt;Renault Mograine&lt;/a&gt; was killed, Taelan was appointed Commander at the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Monastery\"&gt;Scarlet Monastery&lt;/a&gt; in his place.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nTaelan later became &lt;a href=\"Highlord\"&gt;Highlord&lt;/a&gt; and returned to &lt;a href=\"Hearthglen\"&gt;Hearthglen&lt;/a&gt;.\nEventually, with the help of &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s sent by his father, Taelan recognized the corruption that had befallen the Scarlet Crusade and defected. While escaping from Hearthglen, however, he was killed by &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Inquisitor%20Isillien\"&gt;Grand Inquisitor Isillien&lt;/a&gt; for his betrayal. &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt; was waiting nearby for his son and saw him cut down and, overcome with loss and outrage, avenged Taelan's death by killing Isillien. Grieving over his son's body, Tirion resolved to reform the Silver Hand to once more be a force of good in the world.\nTaelan's legacy.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;'s defeat, Highlord Tirion Fordring returned to the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Western Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt; and established the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt;'s base in Hearthglen. Down the road, the tower where Taelan was slain by Isillien has been christened &lt;a href=\"Taelan%27s%20Tower\"&gt;Taelan's Tower&lt;/a&gt; in his memory. In addition, &lt;a href=\"Crusade%20Commander%20Eligor%20Dawnbringer\"&gt;Crusade Commander Eligor Dawnbringer&lt;/a&gt; sends players into the Stratholme to reclaim a &lt;a href=\"Of%20Love%20and%20Family\"&gt;painting&lt;/a&gt; of Taelan and his family from the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Bastion\"&gt;Scarlet Bastion&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpeculation.\nIn the \"\" comic it is said that Taelan succeed &lt;a href=\"Renault%20Mograine\"&gt;Renault Mograine&lt;/a&gt; as a commander in the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Monastery\"&gt;Scarlet Monastery&lt;/a&gt;, after his death. But in the ceremony no title was proclaimed. It is possible that Taelan became a Commander and sometime later, he rose in the ranks becoming a Highlord and returning to Hearthglen as seen in \"World of Warcraft\"."}

A cadet of the &lt;a href=\"Proudmoore%20Guard\"&gt;Proudmoore Guard&lt;/a&gt;, Taelia is also the &lt;a href=\"squire\"&gt;squire&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Cyrus%20Crestfall\"&gt;Cyrus Crestfall&lt;/a&gt;, a former knight who was entrusted by &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Daelin Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; himself with taking care of Bolvar's child.\nTaelia serves as one of the main supporting characters in the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; storyline on &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nEarly life.\nTaelia comes from &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, and is the daughter of the former Regent Lord of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt;. When the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; hit Lordaeron, Taelia lost her mother, and her father sent her to Kul Tiras to be raised away from the war. There, Lord Admiral &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Daelin Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; tasked one of his most trusted knights, &lt;a href=\"Cyrus%20Crestfall\"&gt;Cyrus Crestfall&lt;/a&gt;, with raising the girl. Cyrus taught her how to fight, how to ride, how to sail. By the time she entered the Proudmoore Guard, she was already better trained than some of her instructors, which they didn't appreciate. He also taught her how to deal with thugs, bullies, and \"scum\" like pirates. When they hit them, they would hit back twice as hard. Even though they were apart, Bolvar still wrote letters to Taelia, \"my shining star\" as he called her, until one day they stopped coming. Taelia didn't know much about her father's fate, just that he was a Stormwind knight who gave his life fighting the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt some point, Cyrus gave Taelia a recently hatched &lt;a href=\"gryphon\"&gt;gryphon&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Galeheart\"&gt;Galeheart&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; returned on a diplomatic mission to Kul Tiras years after Daelin's death, Taelia was in the crowd that witnessed her being taken by the guards to face judgment from &lt;a href=\"Katherine%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Katherine Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; for betraying her father.\nSometime later, Taelia and the hired &lt;a href=\"Flynn%20Fairwind\"&gt;Flynn Fairwind&lt;/a&gt; helped the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;emissary&lt;/a&gt;, who had come to Kul Tiras with Jaina, to successfully escape from the prison island of &lt;a href=\"Tol%20Dagor\"&gt;Tol Dagor&lt;/a&gt; during the night. Taelia waited for Flynn and the emissary outside the prison and paddled with Flynn to reach the city of &lt;a href=\"Boralus\"&gt;Boralus&lt;/a&gt; by dawn. Upon arriving at the Tradewinds Market, Taelia gave the emissary a tour of the local amenities, introduced them to Galeheart, and then to Cyrus Crestfall. After hearing Cyrus' reasoning for aiding the Alliance, the harbormaster tasked Taelia with briefing the emissary on the three houses of Kul Tiras and their respective regions.\nShe directed the emissary seeking to venture to &lt;a href=\"Drustvar\"&gt;Drustvar&lt;/a&gt; to meet with &lt;a href=\"Cyril%20White\"&gt;Cyril White&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Fallhaven\"&gt;Fallhaven&lt;/a&gt;, and personally joined them in investigating the nearby &lt;a href=\"Stormsong%20Monastery\"&gt;Stormsong Monastery&lt;/a&gt; deeper within Boralus to discover more information about the missing Kul Tiran fleet. Met with a cold reception from the local tidesages, the search proved fruitless until encountering &lt;a href=\"Brother%20Alen\"&gt;Brother Alen&lt;/a&gt;. Learning from him that the fleet was held prisoner rather than merely lost, the eavesdropping &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20Wade\"&gt;Lieutenant Wade&lt;/a&gt; attacked the group.\nAfter slaying the traitorous &lt;a href=\"tideguard\"&gt;tideguard&lt;/a&gt;, Brother Alen directed Taelia and the emissary to meet with &lt;a href=\"Brother%20Pike\"&gt;Brother Pike&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Brennadam\"&gt;Brennadam&lt;/a&gt;. The two flew Galeheart to the border of &lt;a href=\"Stormsong%20Valley\"&gt;Stormsong Valley&lt;/a&gt; to find the entrance to the land closed. Dealing with the guards at the border and then dispersing an angry mob in Brennadam, Taelia met with Brother Pike in hope of finding answers.\nThough the tidesage lacked information regarding the fleet's disappearance and &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Stormsong\"&gt;Lord Stormsong&lt;/a&gt;'s absence, he led Taelia and the Alliance emissary to the &lt;a href=\"Addington%20Shipyards\"&gt;Addington Shipyards&lt;/a&gt; to find it in disarray; plundered by the Stormsong militia and its workers forced into servitude. Taelia asked the emissary to destroy the harvest golems being used for intimidation and bring her a mainspring, hoping to uncover who had tinkered with their innards. Discovering the spring to bear tidesage runes, she then ordered the death of the nearby &lt;a href=\"Sister%20Ava\"&gt;Sister Ava&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the Shipyards were fully cleared of corrupt Stormsong loyalists, Taelia, Brother Pike, and the rescued worker &lt;a href=\"Samuel%20Williams\"&gt;Samuel Williams&lt;/a&gt; regrouped at &lt;a href=\"Port%20Fogtide\"&gt;Port Fogtide&lt;/a&gt;. When Samuel charged into the fray seeking vengeance, Taelia sent the emissary to cull the corrupt tidesages in the area and later search for Sam within &lt;a href=\"The%20Abyssal%20Melody\"&gt;The Abyssal Melody&lt;/a&gt;. Once the ship was destroyed by Brother Pike, the next destination in their mission to liberate Stormsong Valley was the nearby &lt;a href=\"Sagehold\"&gt;Sagehold&lt;/a&gt;. As the emissary infiltrated the town and liberated whoever remained loyal to Kul Tiras, Taelia snuck ahead and later met with the emissary in order to take down the leader of the tidesages in the area, intercepting &lt;a href=\"Wavespeaker%20Reid\"&gt;Wavespeaker Reid&lt;/a&gt; as he received communications from Lord Stormsong himself.\nWith the treacherous Lord now knowing of their defiance, the recently freed &lt;a href=\"Tideguard%20Victoria\"&gt;Tideguard Victoria&lt;/a&gt; led the pair to safety along the &lt;a href=\"Path%20of%20Storms\"&gt;Path of Storms&lt;/a&gt;. Despite surviving numerous ambushes, in the end the forces summoned by Lord Stormsong proved overwhelming, forcing Victoria to sacrifice herself to buy time for Taelia and the emissary to escape, much to Taelia's dismay.\nReuniting with Brother Pike, Samuel and the rest of the &lt;a href=\"Storm%27s%20Wake\"&gt;Storm's Wake&lt;/a&gt;, Taelia joined the final push towards the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20the%20Storm\"&gt;Shrine of the Storm&lt;/a&gt;. As the group pushed up the final ascent to the Tempest Gate, she became concerned for Samuel's wellbeing, imploring him to hang in there as he began spouting the &lt;a href=\"Shath%27Yar\"&gt;Shath'Yar&lt;/a&gt; language.\nFinally reaching the summit to confront Lord Stormsong, Taelia was shocked as Samuel recklessly attacked and was subsequently transformed into an &lt;a href=\"n%27raqi\"&gt;n'raqi&lt;/a&gt; known as &lt;a href=\"Azshj%27thul%20the%20Drowned\"&gt;Azshj'thul the Drowned&lt;/a&gt; by the crazed Lord. Pleading with whatever shred of humanity may have been left within Samuel, Taelia's words failed to reach him, with Brother Pike informing her that he is lost. Although forced to put Samuel down, Lord Stormsong fled into the Shrine of the Storm with the Storm's Wake in swift pursuit. Knowing that Cyrus would like to hear of their success in protecting the valley and acquiring a valuable new ally in the reunification of Kul Tiras, Taelia flew back to Boralus atop Galeheart to inform him.\nAt the end of The Pride of Kul Tiras storyline, Taelia was introduced to &lt;a href=\"King%20Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, who explained that he knew her father and invited her to visit &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; as his guest when she had time to hear more about Bolvar.\nTides of Vengeance.\nAfter Jaina was crowned &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Admiral\"&gt;Lord Admiral&lt;/a&gt;, Taelia, with a new hammer and new armor, became a member of a five-man patrol squad implied to be part of a larger company, alongside &lt;a href=\"Carter%20Riptide\"&gt;Carter Riptide&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emma%20Swiftwind\"&gt;Emma Swiftwind&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tamara%20Barrie\"&gt;Tamara Barrie&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Edward%20Nash\"&gt;Edward Nash&lt;/a&gt;, with Galeheart accompanying her. The squad discovered the Horde attacking &lt;a href=\"Anglepoint%20Wharf\"&gt;Anglepoint Wharf&lt;/a&gt; and when they saw the enemy had &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt; explosives, realized they meant to destroy the seawall there. They joined the &lt;a href=\"Outriggers\"&gt;Outriggers&lt;/a&gt; in fighting the Horde but were eventually overwhelmed. As Galeheart was the fastest gryphon, Taelia was dispatched to warn Jaina, and she reluctantly left while the rest of the squad covered her escape.\nTaelia returned to Anglepoint with the Alliance emissary and Jaina, who reassured her that going for help was the right choice after Taelia apprised her of the situation. Accompanying Jaina to clear the south shore as it was her duty to stay with the Lord Admiral, Taelia asked the adventurer to find her squad while clearing the north shore. She would later witness the adventurer assist Jaina in destroying the Horde's attacking ships.\nShadowlands.\nTaelia was with Jaina in Boralus when the &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt; captured her. Afterward, Taelia traveled to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;. In a conversation with &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt;, and others, she learned that her father Bolvar was not only still alive, but he had actually been the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; for the last several years; she expressed great anger that Anduin had not told her. But as the &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Helm of Domination&lt;/a&gt; had recently been shattered, Bolvar was now free of that role. Taelia swore to stand by his side.\nTaelia later traveled alongside &lt;a href=\"Calia%20Menethil\"&gt;Calia Menethil&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Oribos\"&gt;Oribos&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;, the afterlife, to meet up with her father. She asked him to look into the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt; to see if their captured friends were still alive, and when Bolvar at first denied her for fear of what coming into contact with the Maw would do to him, Taelia's heartbroken second request convinced him.\nFollowing the forging of &lt;a href=\"Kingsmourne\"&gt;Kingsmourne&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Jailer\"&gt;Jailer&lt;/a&gt;'s subsequent mental assault on Bolvar via the Helm of Domination, Taelia yelled for him to resist the Jailer's will as Jaina and the Maw Walker sought to break the telepathic link between the two. With her father's safety secured by breaking the bond between him and the helm, she conversed with Calia and the recently recovered Jaina, expressing her relief at the Lord Admiral's freedom and discussing the Jailer's legacy on Azeroth.\nEternity's End.\nAfter Anduin was freed from the Jailer's &lt;a href=\"Domination\"&gt;Domination&lt;/a&gt; magic, Bolvar asked Taelia to bring the intact half of the Helm of Domination to &lt;a href=\"Zereth%20Mortis\"&gt;Zereth Mortis&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Primus\"&gt;Primus&lt;/a&gt; suggested that they should experiment with the helm to find a way to resist Domination. Taelia and Bolvar disliked the idea considering all the damage the helm had caused, but Bolvar believed it was worth the risk. A Maw Walker later learned that the &lt;a href=\"Cypher%20of%20the%20First%20Ones\"&gt;language of the First Ones&lt;/a&gt; could offer resistance to Domination, and that complex phrases from the language were contained in vaults in the &lt;a href=\"Endless%20Sands\"&gt;Endless Sands&lt;/a&gt;. Taelia, Bolvar, and the &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Darion%20Mograine\"&gt;Darion Mograine&lt;/a&gt; traveled to the Sands with the Maw Walker to obtain the phrases while the Primus worked on the rest of the plan.\nDarion stayed behind while the Fordragons and the hero fought through the &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt; occupying the area to reach the vaults. Taelia told the Maw Walker that she'd never thought she'd have the chance to fight alongside her father, but that she felt like she was in the exact place she was supposed to be. As the trio fought, father and daughter bonded, with Taelia telling Bolvar how Cyrus Crestfall had taught her to use a hammer and served as a father figure for her growing up. She also asked if Bolvar had ever thought about her and her mother during his time as the Lich King, and he replied \"Every day\". Once the phrases were gathered and imbued in the helm, the Primus asked the group to go to &lt;a href=\"Bastion\"&gt;Bastion&lt;/a&gt; to extract the memories of what had allowed Bolvar and the others to resist Domination in the past and infuse them into the helm's shards. Bolvar was the first to undergo the ritual, and Taelia cheered him on while he extracted the memories of how he'd been burned at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Angrathar%20the%20Wrathgate\"&gt;Battle of Angrathar&lt;/a&gt;. Afterward, Bolvar told the Maw Walker that he hoped Taelia would remember what she saw: that he was not a lone figure locked away, but someone who does what is necessary for the good of all. Once the shards were infused, the group traveled to &lt;a href=\"Torghast%2C%20Tower%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Torghast&lt;/a&gt; to meet with the Primus, who used the language and the memories to reforge the Helm of Domination into the &lt;a href=\"Crown%20of%20Wills\"&gt;Crown of Wills&lt;/a&gt;, an instrument allowing them all to become resistant to Domination.\nTaelia and her father returned to &lt;a href=\"Haven\"&gt;Haven&lt;/a&gt; in Zereth Mortis, where they exchanged words in private. Taelia reflected that she didn't know what she wanted to start asking of Bolvar, and that things had been much simpler when she thought he was simply a dead hero. She told him that if she'd known of his true fate and transformation into the Lich King, she would have sought him out in &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, but Bolvar insisted that this was why she hadn't been allowed to know: to keep her and the rest of Azeroth safe. Taelia retorted that this hadn't just been Bolvar's own sacrifice, but a sacrifice by everyone who loved him as well. Bolvar replied \"I know\", and told his daughter that he hoped she could one day forgive him for the pain he had caused her.\nTaelia and Bolvar attended &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;'s trial in Oribos. Afterward, Bolvar considered returning to Icecrown Citadel to prevent it from falling into the wrong hands, but Darion told him that the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; would protect the citadel and that Taelia needed her father.\nSometime later, Taelia approached Bolvar, and admitted that while she would never agree with his choice to hide the truth that he was still alive, she understand why he did so, and that he didn't mean to hurt her. Bolvar remarked that, at the time, he believed that he would be trapped forever as the Jailer of the Damned, holding the Scourge, and dared not hope for anything more. She then revealed that when the helm was broken, with his freedom came the fear, the fear that the daughter he loved with all his heart would behold him, and see only a monster. Taelia was then quick to reassure him that she only saw the hero he was and the father he could be, if he was willing. Bolvar subsequently promised that he wouldn't waste this second chance.\nThe Vow Eternal.\nA few years later, Taelia was among those who attended the wedding of &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thalyssra\"&gt;Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt;. During the reception, she spoke with &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; and revealed that &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; was unable to attend the ceremony, due to &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; dealing with &lt;a href=\"pirate\"&gt;pirate&lt;/a&gt;s. The pair were overheard by &lt;a href=\"Flynn%20Fairwind\"&gt;Flynn Fairwind&lt;/a&gt;, who inquired what flags they were flying, to see if he knew them and thus could provide aid. She then met &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt;, and told him that she was honored to meet him, as she had heard a lot about him. When she saw the Forsaken delegation, consisting of &lt;a href=\"Derek%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Derek Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Calia%20Menethil\"&gt;Calia Menethil&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Lilian%20Voss\"&gt;Lilian Voss&lt;/a&gt;, she came to welcome them warmly. Later, she expressed her surprise at not seeing &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; at the wedding, although she was certain that they were invited.\nQuotes.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nWe'll get through this together.\nThe Horde attack was swift. Anglepoint needs help now!\nNot everyone in my patrol squad made it, but many did. That's something to hold on to, isn't it?\nThank you for saving the lives you could.\nSpeculation.\nTaelia's mother could be &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Mara%20Fordragon\"&gt;Lady Mara Fordragon&lt;/a&gt;, who fled to Lordaeron and has been presumed dead since, which would match Taelia's account of losing her mother when the Scourge hit Lordaeron."}

Since &lt;a href=\"WoW%27s%2013th%20Anniversary\"&gt;WoW's 13th Anniversary&lt;/a&gt;, Taerar is available during the anniversary event.\nOverview.\nTaerar is one of the Emerald Dragons. The other emerald dragons are &lt;a href=\"Lethon\"&gt;Lethon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emeriss\"&gt;Emeriss&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ysondre\"&gt;Ysondre&lt;/a&gt;. These dragons are world spawns located in &lt;a href=\"Duskwood\"&gt;Duskwood&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Grove\"&gt;Twilight Grove&lt;/a&gt;), the &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Seradane\"&gt;Seradane&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Feralas\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Dream%20Bough\"&gt;Dream Bough&lt;/a&gt;), and &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Bough%20Shadow\"&gt;Bough Shadow&lt;/a&gt;). They have a raid level of difficulty. However, some dragons are more challenging than others. Taerar is considered to be the second easiest, probably because his abilities are hardly unique in \"World of Warcraft\". However, Taerar is the only emerald dragon which requires multiple tanks and a certain type of raid setup. \nAll four dragons share the Sleep (summoning \"Dream Fog\"), Noxious Breath, Tail Sweep, Mark of Nature and Aura of Nature abilities. Each dragon also has a few unique abilities. One of these is considered the dragon's ace move, and will be performed when the dragon loses 25 \u00b1 5% of its max life. In other words, the ace move will only be performed three times; when the dragon is at 25%, 50%, and 75% life. When it is performed, the dragon will also yell something. \nStrategy.\n&lt;a href=\"Priest\"&gt;Priest&lt;/a&gt; can Fear Ward the MT. &lt;a href=\"Shaman\"&gt;Shaman&lt;/a&gt; can use two tremor totems in the Main Tank groups. The fear is cast as a spell and a warrior tank can use Berserker Rage to avoid it. Moreover, like in the &lt;a href=\"Nefarian\"&gt;Nefarian&lt;/a&gt; fight, there should be one or two off-tanks warding against the fears as the Main Tank will have a cooldown on his abilities induced by the Noxious Breath. When he is around 75%, 50%, and 25%, off-tanks should pickup the shades. The shades will move towards healers generally because of healing aggro. It is important that when the shades spawn, Druids and Shaman stop casting heals until all the shades are picked up by a tank. If druids and shaman keep casting heals, the shades will run towards the healer and make quick work of them. Priests can fade so make sure your priests are ready to take over healing for a bit until the shades are picked up by the tanks. Resume DPS on Taerar when the adds are dead."}

After &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; was captured by a band of &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Khiragg\"&gt;Khiragg&lt;/a&gt;, Cairne fell into a deep lethargic depression, which led Tagar to unofficially take over. However, despite managing the tauren, Tagar was fearful that without the leadership of Cairne, the tauren would not last long. In time, the tauren were visited by &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rokhan\"&gt;Rokhan&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Chen%20Stormstout\"&gt;Chen Stormstout&lt;/a&gt;, who sought to rally the tauren to aid the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; in the battle against &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Daelin Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the despondent Cairne waved the group away, Tagar stepped forward and explained Baine's capture, Cairne's depression, and then implored the group to seek out &lt;a href=\"Bovan%20Windtotem\"&gt;Bovan Windtotem&lt;/a&gt; in the plains of &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt;, with the hopes that working together that they could find and rescue Baine. Baine was subsequently returned to the tauren, bringing Caine back to his former state of wisdom and courage.\nTagar also issued tasks such as the elimination of &lt;a href=\"harpies\"&gt;harpies&lt;/a&gt; hunting the village's &lt;a href=\"kodo\"&gt;kodo&lt;/a&gt; herds.\nAfter Cairne made the decision to journey with Rexxar for the &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Durotar\"&gt;fight against the Admiral&lt;/a&gt;, it was implied that Baine and Tagar were left to led the tauren in his absence.\nDragonflight.\nTagar was among the groups of tauren that decided to travel with the &lt;a href=\"Windtotem\"&gt;Windtotem&lt;/a&gt;, as they journeyed to the &lt;a href=\"Ohn%27ahran%20Plains\"&gt;Ohn'ahran Plains&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Bovan%20Windtotem\"&gt;Bovan Windtotem's&lt;/a&gt; vision from &lt;a href=\"Ohn%27ahra\"&gt;Ohn'ahra&lt;/a&gt;. However as they traversed the plains, they were attacked by &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Nokhud\"&gt;Clan Nokhud&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Primalists\"&gt;Primalists&lt;/a&gt; forces, who were convinced that the tauren were &lt;a href=\"druids\"&gt;druids&lt;/a&gt; seeking to aid the &lt;a href=\"Green%20dragonflight\"&gt;Green dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;. While Bovan and other tauren found themselves taken prisoner, Tagar was able to lead the survivors to &lt;a href=\"Toghusuq%20Village\"&gt;Toghusuq Village&lt;/a&gt;. In Bovan's absence he took up leadership of the tauren, and bared any centaur entry into the village, a fact that outraged &lt;a href=\"Scout%20Tomul\"&gt;Scout Tomul&lt;/a&gt; who was aiding &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; in his search for Bovan. However, Tagar defended this decision by citing that every centaur they had met within the plains had sought to harm them and thus in these times, they must act out of an abundance of caution. To that end, he also warned Baine to be careful when trusting Tomul.\nAfter Baine returned to the village with Bovan's corpse, Tagar reflected how decades ago he had asked Bovan to help save Baine from the centaur, Thus he had owed him a great debt and was unable to return the favor by saving him. Acknowledging that he would have to bear that for the rest of his life, Tagar declared that his only path forward was to honor his memory by protecting his people. He subsequently presided over the attended tauren and the &lt;a href=\"Maruuk%20Centaur\"&gt;Maruuk Centaur&lt;/a&gt; to honor their shared fallen.\nAs the tauren began rebuilding Toghusuq Village, he was approached by &lt;a href=\"Boku\"&gt;Boku&lt;/a&gt; who invited the tauren to remain in the plains. He responded that it was not his decision but the Windtotems' to decide when they were ready. However, he privately admitted that the plains reminded him of &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt;, of home.\nQuotes.\nWith Bovan missing, I act as the leader of the tauren here.\nWe have taken shelter in this abandoned village for now. But stay vigilant--the centaur may attack at any time."}

Unfortunately, the job is turning out to be too large for just the two of them.\n&lt;a href=\"Freedom%20for%20All%20Creatures\"&gt;Freedom for All Creatures&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Kindal%20Moonweaver\"&gt;Kindal Moonweaver&lt;/a&gt; needs help. The &lt;a href=\"Grimtotem\"&gt;Grimtotem&lt;/a&gt;s have captured a large number of sprite darters and are holding them captive in the &lt;a href=\"Grimtotem%20Compound\"&gt;Grimtotem Compound&lt;/a&gt;, below the ridge where Kindal and Jer'kai stand watch. Kindal wants to set the creatures free, and even has the key to the cage, but she needs help to do it. That's where you come in. Kindal needs you to protect her and the sprite darters while they escape.\n&lt;a href=\"Doling%20Justice\"&gt;Doling Justice&lt;/a&gt;\nNow that the sprite darters have been freed, &lt;a href=\"Jer%27kai%20Moonweaver\"&gt;Jer'kai Moonweaver&lt;/a&gt; wants you to make sure they are not captured again.

However, whether due to curiosity or concern, you decide to check back in on Kindal and Jer'kai in &lt;a href=\"Feralas\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt; - perhaps they have further need of your aid.\n&lt;a href=\"An%20Orphan%20Looking%20For%20a%20Home\"&gt;An Orphan Looking For a Home&lt;/a&gt;\nIt turns out Kindal and Jer'kai have managed to save a clutch of sprite darter eggs, though the mother died. In recognition of your service to these creatures, Kindal gifts you with one of the eggs, instructing you to seek out a kaldorei named Quentin at the &lt;a href=\"Mirage%20Raceway\"&gt;Mirage Raceway&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Thousand%20Needles\"&gt;Thousand Needles&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"A%20Short%20Incubation\"&gt;A Short Incubation&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Quentin\"&gt;Quentin&lt;/a&gt; needs some to check the health of the egg. Alchemists craft these elixirs, so you manage to get some without too much trouble. Using the elixirs, Quentin discovers that the egg is fragile but healthy, and will soon hatch. However, it will need special care, care which he is unable to provide.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Newest%20Member%20of%20the%20Family\"&gt;The Newest Member of the Family&lt;/a&gt;\nYou must hurry to bring the fragile egg to &lt;a href=\"Aerie%20Peak\"&gt;Aerie Peak&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt;, where the dwarf &lt;a href=\"Agnar%20Beastamer\"&gt;Agnar Beastamer&lt;/a&gt;, in the basement of Wildhammer Keep, can be of further assistance. Quentin knows this dwarf is wise in the ways of animals, and will be able to guide you in the final steps of the incubation.\n&lt;a href=\"Food%20for%20Baby\"&gt;Food for Baby&lt;/a&gt;\nAfter racing against the clock to reach &lt;a href=\"Aerie%20Peak\"&gt;Aerie Peak&lt;/a&gt; before it is too late, you at last speak with Agnar. The dwarf indeed knows just what the new baby will need - food, and lots of it! He sends you out to collect meat from the &lt;a href=\"Silvermane%20Stalker\"&gt;Silvermane Stalker&lt;/a&gt;s who prowl the eastern &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt;. The wolves are dangerous and crafty, but you manage to collect enough, rushing back to &lt;a href=\"Aerie%20Peak\"&gt;Aerie Peak&lt;/a&gt; laden with wolf flanks. And just in time - it appears the egg is about to hatch!\n&lt;a href=\"Becoming%20a%20Parent\"&gt;Becoming a Parent&lt;/a&gt;\nThe tiny sprite darter emerges from its egg, and you and Agnar quickly provide it with the food it needs. The creature seems to instantly take a liking to you - once it is able to fly, it begins following close behind you. Agnar tells you to keep the egg as a symbol of the relationship: you can always use it to call or send away the little Darter.\nRewards.\nIf the player follows the entire quest chain from beginning to end, he or she will receive:\n&lt;a href=\"Sprite%20Darter%20Egg\"&gt;Sprite Darter Egg&lt;/a&gt;\nNotes.\nIf planning to do the quests all at once, it would be pertinent to get the 2 needed for &lt;a href=\"A%20Short%20Incubation\"&gt;A Short Incubation&lt;/a&gt; ahead of time. These can be crafted by &lt;a href=\"Alchemy\"&gt;alchemists&lt;/a&gt;, and can sometimes be found in the &lt;a href=\"Auction%20House\"&gt;Auction House&lt;/a&gt;."}

Tauren settlements in Thousand Needles are constructed atop the tall mesas in the region, staying out of reach of the &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt; warbands that have several camps in the area. The village on the mesa's top is accessible by the employment of the ingenious wooden lifts of the tauren, although there is a series of rope bridges spanning amongst the adjacent pinnacles, gradually working their way to the top.\nThe tauren of Freewind Post work to stop the activity of the &lt;a href=\"Galak%20tribe\"&gt;Galak tribe&lt;/a&gt; centaur in Thousand Needles. &lt;a href=\"Screeching\"&gt;Screeching&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"harpies\"&gt;harpies&lt;/a&gt; pose a less dire threat to the stability of the region as well. Another large aspect of the society of Freewind Post deals with the &lt;a href=\"wyverns\"&gt;wyverns&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Highperch\"&gt;Highperch&lt;/a&gt;, where young tauren are sent to study the wyverns and to cull eggs from their ancestral nesting grounds to be raised as mounts for the Horde.\nThe Horde-aligned tauren of Freewind Post grew continually more wary of the activities of the &lt;a href=\"Grimtotem%20tribe\"&gt;Grimtotem tribe&lt;/a&gt; situated atop &lt;a href=\"Darkcloud%20Pinnacle\"&gt;Darkcloud Pinnacle&lt;/a&gt; to the northwest. The Grimtotems had been suspected to be involved in murder, kidnappings of Freewind tauren, and visits from agents of unknown (but reportedly dark) origins. The chieftain of Darkcloud Pinnacle, &lt;a href=\"Arnak%20Grimtotem\"&gt;Arnak Grimtotem&lt;/a&gt;, was largely held to be responsible for these heinous transgressions. A Freewind Post tauren, &lt;a href=\"Lakota%20Windsong\"&gt;Lakota Windsong&lt;/a&gt;, was taken against her will when she refused Arnak's advances. Her brother was slain when he came to her defense. She is also apparently close friends with &lt;a href=\"Thalia%20Amberhide\"&gt;Thalia Amberhide&lt;/a&gt;.\nClosely related to the problems with the Grimtotem was the concern surrounding a so-called \"Alien Egg\" that was rumored to have appeared near the nests of the Needles' resident &lt;a href=\"wind%20serpent\"&gt;wind serpent&lt;/a&gt;s. The Grimtotem had given supplication to the creature that hatched from the egg, &lt;a href=\"Arikara\"&gt;Arikara&lt;/a&gt;, Serpent of Vengeance, in hopes that it would aid them in their mission to depose &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; as punishment for his changes to tauren culture and tradition.\nA &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elf&lt;/a&gt; presence appeared in Freewind Post in the form of &lt;a href=\"Magistrix%20Elosai\"&gt;Magistrix Elosai&lt;/a&gt;, who was effectively an exile of &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;. Her controversial quest to seek a natural cure to the blood elves' racial addiction to the &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; led her to Freewind seeking reagents to use in her remedies, along with help from her associate, &lt;a href=\"Wizlo%20Bearingshiner\"&gt;Wizlo Bearingshiner&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Whitereach%20Post\"&gt;Whitereach Post&lt;/a&gt;.\nBy the time Cairne died, the Grimtotem attacked the post, but the attack was repelled. Its warriors aided &lt;a href=\"Baine\"&gt;Baine&lt;/a&gt; in retaking &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt;.\nFreewind Post was taken by the &lt;a href=\"Grimtotem%20tribe\"&gt;Grimtotem tribe&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;. At the base of the Post is a small group of &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; who are apparently are working in conjunction to drive away the Grimtotems.\nAt some point, Freewind has been liberated once more by tauren and &lt;a href=\"quilboar\"&gt;quilboar&lt;/a&gt; alike, who've united against the Grimtotem to retake their home. The town is currently populated by both races, who are very friendly to outsiders and open to trading, while &lt;a href=\"Elmarine\"&gt;Elmarine&lt;/a&gt; keeps the peace. Unfortunately, Freewind suffers from frequent &lt;a href=\"harpy\"&gt;harpy&lt;/a&gt; attacks after sundown, occurring once every three or four nights.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt;, the bridge connecting Freewind Post and &lt;a href=\"Darkcloud%20Pinnacle\"&gt;Darkcloud Pinnacle&lt;/a&gt; was barricaded with &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; spikes by &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zekhan\"&gt;Zekhan&lt;/a&gt; reported that the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; control Freewind Post. Whether the quilboar and Elmarine remain in the town is unknown.\nIn the RPG.\nIts population was 800.\nNotes.\nIf you plan to leave Freewind Post using the back way, watch your step, as an uneven ramp down may cause you to slip and fall to the ground below."}

Upon activating the ability, you are presented with a targeting reticule that shows the placement and radius of your trap. Once fired, it can take between one and two seconds to land, and an additional one second for the trap to arm.\nThe trap acts exactly like a trap laid by Freezing Trap.\nThis shares a cooldown with other trap abilities and &lt;a href=\"Black%20Arrow\"&gt;Black Arrow&lt;/a&gt;.\nTips and tactics.\nWhile the utility of this ability is limited against other players, it excels in &lt;a href=\"group\"&gt;group&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"solo\"&gt;solo&lt;/a&gt; questing, and is marginally useful in &lt;a href=\"instance\"&gt;instance&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt;s. Some specific situations where it can prove useful are as follows.\nAgainst groups that have a &lt;a href=\"ranged\"&gt;ranged&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"DPS\"&gt;DPS&lt;/a&gt; mob, the hunter can place the trap to &lt;a href=\"crowd%20control\"&gt;crowd control&lt;/a&gt; the ranged mob, which allows a pet or group member to &lt;a href=\"aggro\"&gt;aggro&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"melee\"&gt;melee&lt;/a&gt; mobs without fear.\nWhen a mob breaks a previous trap or crowd control unexpectedly, the hunter may fire the Arrow as desired, to re-establish CC, without disengaging from the main target being killed. This is because, unlike many other crowd-control abilities, Freezing Arrow does not require having the mob as a target or focus. This also enables more flexible chain-trapping (see Freezing Trap for more details).\nWhen &lt;a href=\"misdirection\"&gt;misdirecting&lt;/a&gt; a group of mobs to a &lt;a href=\"tank\"&gt;tank&lt;/a&gt;, cast Misdirection on the tank, then fire Freezing Arrow at the group. This traps one mob and ensures that all other mobs in the group are pulled to the tank.\nWhen in Arena, the Freezing Arrow is extremely useful. Holy paladins and casters who have to stand in one place will always fall prey to its icy grip. Even for classes who are mobile, you can still attempt to predict their path of travel and intercept them with a freezing arrow. This is extremely useful when paired with &lt;a href=\"Readiness%20%28BC%20Classic%29\"&gt;Readiness (BC Classic)&lt;/a&gt;, for two targets can be frozen at one time, or one target can be frozen back to back. This method is especially useful for paladins, who will likely blow both their &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Shield\"&gt;Divine Shield&lt;/a&gt; and PvP trinket to escape its grip.\nAn advantage over the regular Freezing Trap is that there is no need to use &lt;a href=\"Distracting%20Shot\"&gt;Distracting Shot&lt;/a&gt; to redirect the desired mob toward the trap. This is advantageous because it does not serve as a &lt;a href=\"taunt\"&gt;taunt&lt;/a&gt; and limits aggro changes.\nNote: The arrow flight time and arming time requires leading on &lt;a href=\"patrol\"&gt;patrol&lt;/a&gt;ling mobs.\nDirects aggro to the caster (might be advantageous or disadvantageous).\nAnother extremely funny thing you can do is place the trap right behind the speed buff in WSG, people always take the buff and will therefore always be frozen."}

It accompanied the &lt;a href=\"Angrathar%20the%20Wrathgate\"&gt;Wrathgate&lt;/a&gt; cinematic on the \"\" official website. The story is told from the perspective of an orc warrior who fought in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Angrathar%20the%20Wrathgate\"&gt;Battle of Angrathar the Wrathgate&lt;/a&gt;.\nText.\nThe blacksmith wiped ichor off my sword, eyed the blade, and tossed it into the pile at his feet. \"Too damaged. Get another,\" he grunted, pointing to the rack of weapons behind him. \"Next!\"\nNew blade in hand, I rechecked my armor. Scarred, but sound. More than enough for the coming battle.\nI was looking over my wolf when the order came: \"Gakarah ma!\"\nEagerly we soldiers formed ranks for our commander, Saurfang the Younger. Behind him stretched the towering shadow of Angrathar the Wrath Gate. He didn't even seem to notice. I'd never met a braver orc. From what I'd seen so far, he was truly his father's son, brown skin or not.\n\"Some of you rode here with me from Azjol-Nerub, where we pitted our strength against the rotting spider-folk. For those of you who missed it, we smashed our way into their precious kingdom and blocked off their tunnels into the Dragonblight.\" He gave us a slow and savage grin. \"Arthas won't be getting any reinforcements from them today.\"\nWe cheered, and the wind shifted, bringing with it the stench of decay. As if the Forsaken here weren't bad enough. I'd never understand why they'd been allowed to join the Horde. They might hate the Scourge, but they were still undead. Worse, they were traitors: they'd served the Alliance in life. If the Forsaken could change allegiance once, they could do it again.\n\"And the Alliance has held up its end of the agreement,\" Saurfang went on. \"Our scouts have just confirmed that Naxxramas too has been cut off.\" He raised a gauntleted hand to silence our jeers. \"Yes, Naxxramas was probably the smaller task. That was why I asked to take on Azjol-Nerub. It was only right for the Horde to claim the greater challenge and the honor that comes with it. Even so,\" and he chuckled, \"clearly the pinkskins' pride was stung. They must have set their feet on fire, racing to beat us here.\"\nA guttural war cry behind him drew his attention. Drawing his axe, he turned at last to watch the battle playing out below us. His vantage point was better than mine, but I heard a loud metallic clanking and then an unearthly roar.\nHe reacted immediately. \"Rise up, sons of the Horde!\" he shouted, and turned to face us again. \"Blood and glory await us!\"\nWhatever he'd seen, it meant trouble for the reckless humans. We ran to our wolves and mounted up.\n\"Lok-tar ogar!\" Saurfang cried as he led us down the hill.\n\"For the Horde!\" we thundered back in answer.\nHe charged deep into the fray, heading for the humans' general. The rest of us spread out and aided the Alliance forces where necessary. They were fools to have started this fight without us. They'd seen little of war, and for the past six years we had been at \"peace\". They were soft, and they were smugly certain they could win the day. It hadn't occurred to them that they might lose. They didn't really understand loss, not as we orcs do.\nI jumped off my wolf and launched myself at a ghoul. Severed its head, shrugged off the clutch of its rotting hands. Another undead reached for me, this one a skeleton in rags. Then there was another, and another after that. So many. The next one spotted my approach, and her expression changed to fear and anger. One of the Forsaken. I barely managed to halt my blade. \"Out of the way!\" I rasped, and thrust her aside impatiently.\nAfter that, I let the familiar surge of bloodlust overcome me. My sword became my world: I couldn't see anything beyond it.\nThe elders say we were a peaceful race before we came to Azeroth. Our clans kept mostly to themselves. They hunted game, planted crops, raised families, and lived in harmony with the elements.\nWhen I was a child, I wondered what Draenor must have been like. I tried to imagine these strange orcs who had a world of their own, a freedom I've never known. The few times I managed to picture such creatures, I despised them. They hadn't deserved their world, just as humans did not deserve Azeroth.\nAll too soon the Horde won the day, and Angrathar was ours. Yet the biggest task still lay ahead. The brash human general taunted Arthas and drew him out of Icecrown to confront us. Behind his spiked helm, the Lich King's eyes blazed a chilling blue. He threatened to teach us the true meaning of fear, and as he spoke, new undead clawed their way out of the ground.\nBut our bold leader had grown weary of fighting Arthas' minions. \"Enough talk! Let it be finished!\" He ran forward, axe raised.\nThe Lich King's glowing runeblade met Saurfang's axe, and the axe shattered like ice, pieces of metal flying outward. By the time Saurfang's back hit the ground, he was dead. Killed in one blow. Impossible. I stared in numb horror while Frostmourne devoured my commander's soul.\nAgain the human general blustered: \"You will pay for all the lives you've stolen, traitor.\"\nArthas' reply was interrupted by an explosive crash and screams. I looked around. A cloud of yellow-green mist was rising in the middle of the battlefield, some distance away. Hard to see what was happening.\nMalicious laughter drew my eyes upward. Silhouetted against the bright gray sky, a robed figure stood on the crags to one side of the Wrath Gate. \"Did you think we had forgotten?\" he called. \"Did you think we had forgiven?\" Catapults rolled into position on either side of him. \"Behold now the terrible vengeance of the Forsaken! Death to the Scourge! And death to the living!\"\nThey had betrayed us. Curse them and their monstrous queen.\nToo late, Horde and Alliance forces tried to scatter. We were packed tightly together, and the catapults were already firing their payload: barrels that exploded on impact and released more of the noxious-looking mist. Anyone close enough to the blasts died instantly. Others doubled over, choking, retching, clawing at their eyes, crying out in vain for aid.\nAfter the Third War, we could have defeated the humans once and for all. Instead, Thrall spoke of mercy. As if the humans had ever shown us mercy. I was born in their internment camps; they were pits of filth and despair. We were meant to die there. What would the warchief know of our suffering, the famous gladiator, the human pet? Nothing. He talked us into this. Allying with humans time and again. Bowing to their demands. Starving to death in nearly barren lands, surrounded by plenty. It was the internment camps all over again. Humans were too cowardly to exterminate us outright, but they intended to wipe us out all the same.\nWith this deadly mist, it seemed they might finally succeed. My eyes burned, and my throat was closing up. Suddenly my legs failed me, and I found myself on my knees. This was no heroic end, no glorious destiny. I'd known all along that humans, alive or undead, couldn't be trusted. I didn't deserve this.\nI could taste my own blood. Then there was only darkness and the sound of my heart as it beat its last.\nWhere are all your words now, Warchief?\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

This takes place ten years later where the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; still holds out many resistances across the land, notably &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20peninsula\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;, Upper &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20Hill\"&gt;Sentinel Hill&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Human Alliance.\nThe Human &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; has suffered great losses recently, notably &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; being sacked, &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; burning, &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; burnt, and so forth. However, they have won several victories lately such as; retaking &lt;a href=\"Pyrewood\"&gt;Pyrewood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ambermill\"&gt;Ambermill&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Shadowfang%20Keep\"&gt;Shadowfang Keep&lt;/a&gt;. Recently, King &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Graymane&lt;/a&gt; has announced himself Supreme Ruler of Humanity, with nobody to challenge his rule. This is due to the fact that all other kingdoms, aside from &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Alterac&lt;/a&gt;, have burned and/or currently defending what they have left.

This has divided the Horde in half, Gul'dan's Orcs, the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt;, and the Legion, which are fighting to defeat the &lt;a href=\"Warsong\"&gt;Warsong&lt;/a&gt;, and Doomhammer clans.

The &lt;a href=\"Fel%20Horde\"&gt;Fel Horde&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Auchindoun\"&gt;Auchindoun&lt;/a&gt; and Hellfire Citadel stand vigilant against the remaining clans. However, in the north, the growing power of the Alliance has caught Gul'dan's attention. The Archlich Gul'dan has now sided with the Amani chieftain, &lt;a href=\"Zul%27jin\"&gt;Zul'jin&lt;/a&gt;, and is dedicated to defeating Prince Arthas, &lt;a href=\"Aedelas%20Blackmoore\"&gt;Aedelas Blackmoore&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Kurdran%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Kurdran Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt;.

Once a high priestess of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;, Liadrin became disillusioned with her faith after the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"The%20Scourge%20invasion%20of%20Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;invasion&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, and spent the following years honing her martial prowess against the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; occupying the &lt;a href=\"Ghostlands\"&gt;Ghostlands&lt;/a&gt;. When &lt;a href=\"M%27uru\"&gt;M'uru&lt;/a&gt; was shipped to Silvermoon by Prince &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;, Liadrin was summoned by &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Rommath\"&gt;Grand Magister Rommath&lt;/a&gt; to partake in a radical idea the &lt;a href=\"Magisters\"&gt;magi&lt;/a&gt; had devised: the empowerment of &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;Light-wielding warriors&lt;/a&gt; by siphoning the captive &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt;'s holy energies.\nContemptuous of the Light's failure to protect her homeland in its hour of greatest need, Liadrin volunteered herself for this notion, and thus became the first of the Blood Knights, an order she rules to this day. Following Kael'thas' betrayal, Liadrin sought redemption for her people; and with the revitalization of the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;, she has rekindled a far more harmonious relationship with the Light.\nBiography.\nBefore the War.\nLiadrin's parents were slain by &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;trolls&lt;/a&gt;, creatures the high priestess developed a particular distaste for during her earlier life. She was raised by &lt;a href=\"Vandellor\"&gt;High Priest Vandellor&lt;/a&gt;, whose tutelage first inspired her passion for the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring a troll attack against the elves, Liadrin accompanied Magister &lt;a href=\"Dar%27Khan%20Drathir\"&gt;Dar'Khan Drathir&lt;/a&gt; to investigate malfunctioning &lt;a href=\"runestone\"&gt;runestone&lt;/a&gt;s, along with her apprentice &lt;a href=\"Galell\"&gt;Galell&lt;/a&gt;. The group was ambushed and captured by an Amani raiding party, and interrogated by &lt;a href=\"Zul%27jin\"&gt;Chieftain Zul'jin&lt;/a&gt; himself in a troll sacrificial chamber, who was eager to find further weaknesses in the runestones protecting the land. The ranger &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; had also been captured. By assaulting Zul'jin with a Light-based attack\u2014transferring the pain she had endured in the last few minutes back at Zul'jin\u2014Liadrin was able to create an opening for the group to escape, Dar'Khan mustering the energy to teleport them to safety. Liadrin was briefly enthralled by a tiki mask which granted her three disturbing visions of her companions: Dar'Khan as an &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;animate corpse&lt;/a&gt;, Galell in a twisted and &lt;a href=\"Wretched\"&gt;deformed state&lt;/a&gt;, and Lor'themar writhing in flame. In time, each vision would become a reality.\nShe attended several &lt;a href=\"Thalassian\"&gt;Thalassian&lt;/a&gt; ceremonial occasions, including the promotion of &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; to ranger captain and, later, ranger lord.\n&lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; cared for Liadrin, but sometimes the priestess's gentle demeanor tried her patience.\nSecond War.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Orcish Horde&lt;/a&gt; broke off the siege of Quel'Thalas, the Amani, conversely unwilling to abandon their long-coveted goal of reclaiming the land, were left in disarray. King &lt;a href=\"Anasterian\"&gt;Anasterian&lt;/a&gt; resolved to crush them once and for all. He dispatched raids of magi and priests to supplement the Farstriders and warriors, and Liadrin was made part of &lt;a href=\"Halduron%20Brightwing\"&gt;Halduron Brightwing&lt;/a&gt;'s company. Liadrin and Brightwing came across Zul'jin himself amidst the burning land set aflame by the rampant &lt;a href=\"red%20dragon\"&gt;red dragon&lt;/a&gt;s, and after cutting down the trolls, the elves captured the leader of their most hated enemy. To take revenge for the deaths he had caused, the rangers tortured Zul'jin extensively, with a brutality that unnerved even Liadrin. She suggested that Halduron put an end to it and simply finish him off, though the pair were interrupted by an Amani raiding party, who succeeded in wounding Halduron and rescuing their captured chieftain.\nThird War.\nYears later, Liadrin had become a high priestess and had watched her apprentice turn into a fine priest in his own right. She reflected on the rumored plague encompassing &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, grateful that the elves had enjoyed a relatively prosperous decade in contrast. In hindsight, Liadrin believed it was a good decision for the country to distance itself from the humans.\nQuel'Thalas's tranquillity would not last. King Anasterian's health was failing, and Liadrin believed that her king, receiving disturbing reports from his advisors, was growing greatly concerned about something else. Some time later, the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; championed by the twisted prince &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;, fresh from laying Lordaeron to waste, turned their gaze toward the high home of the elves, and &lt;a href=\"The%20Scourge%20invasion%20of%20Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;invaded the kingdom&lt;/a&gt;. Liadrin, though safely within the walls of Silvermoon, observed the phalanxes rushing through the land, and could scarcely believe her eyes. She was present when Arthas demanded the elves open their gates, offering them the gift of &lt;a href=\"undeath\"&gt;eternal servitude&lt;/a&gt; in return for their compliance, and threatening to slaughter all of their loved ones if they refuse. With Anasterian and the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt; on their side, the elves held steadfast in their opposition, though Arthas, in turn, was prepared for this possibility and planned to lay siege to the elven capital.\nLiadrin was disturbed by the sight of the fallen &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas\"&gt;Ranger-general Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, whose ghostly visage had been paraded by her killers in front of Silvermoon, and was fearful of the other atrocities the despoiler of Lordaeron would commit. Arthas began his attack, and Liadrin assisted in healing the wounded elves in the chaos. Her faith shaken by the onslaught, she barely managed to save &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Belo%27vir\"&gt;Grand Magister Belo'vir&lt;/a&gt;, who was organizing Silvermoon's defenses in the fallen ranger-general's place. The grand magister instructed &lt;a href=\"Rommath\"&gt;Archmage Rommath&lt;/a&gt; to prepare the city for evacuation and to send the soldiers to the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Isle of Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt; to protect the king and the Sunwell, acknowledging that Silvermoon was about to fall. He and Liadrin soon joined them.\nThe Sunwell's power had been bound by Dar'Khan, who had betrayed his people in favor of the Scourge. Liadrin questioned how the prince would cross the ocean, her fear of the elves' impending deaths rising by the moment. Arthas conjured his &lt;a href=\"Path%20of%20Frost\"&gt;path of frost&lt;/a&gt;, and Liadrin reunited with Vandellor. The two high priests healed Belo'vir's wounds in the ensuing battle, though the grand magister was overrun by the Scourge, mauled by Arthas, and cast aside. Against Liadrin's imploration, Vandellor rushed to heal Belo'vir, while Liadrin herself witnessed the showdown between Arthas and Anasterian which he lost. Liadrin then checked on her mentor, who was killed by an &lt;a href=\"abomination\"&gt;abomination&lt;/a&gt;. About to share in his fate, a grievously wounded Belo'vir saved Liadrin, teleporting her out of the fray with his final action. Liadrin was safely away when the Sunwell was tainted by the rebirth of &lt;a href=\"Kel%27thuzad\"&gt;Kel'thuzad&lt;/a&gt;. His mission complete, Arthas disposed of Dar'Khan and left Quel'Thalas.\nFollowing the Sunwell's compromised state and throughout the battle, Liadrin was having troubles with summoning of the Light, even when she reminded herself that she could summon it without the Sunwell. As she tried, she once failed and later with her full focus of soul and mind the connection was weak. As the invasion came to an end, she was so desperate and frenzied that she was unable to call the Light.\nWracked with guilt, Liadrin refused to beseech the Light now. She returned to the survivors in Silvermoon to report that an Amani force was preparing to secure the Sunwell from the Scourge. The newly-returned &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Prince Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; prepared for an attack on the tainted well, to put an end to the dark energies pulsating through it and to stop their enemies. Liadrin volunteered for the task, but not as a priestess; she took a weapon, and asked Lor'themar to have his men train her with it.\nAlong with a number of survivors (including some future Blood Knights), Liadrin accompanied the prince to Quel'Danas. Liadrin killed a risen Vandellor during the battle, and the group fell back after the prince and his magi destroyed the tainted Sunwell.\nAfter the battle, Kael'thas proclaimed the high elves reborn as the blood elves.\nFounding of the Order.\nFive years later, Liadrin still struggled with the guilt she felt the day the Scourge dawned on Quel'Thalas: guilt for failing to protect her country, her brethren, her mentor; guilt for the fear she had let control her, and guilt for not dying herself. Pained by the loss of the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt; and quite reliant on external sources to sate her hunger for the &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt;, Liadrin, now living in an abandoned, run-down manor in the &lt;a href=\"Ghostlands\"&gt;Ghostlands&lt;/a&gt;, etched out a living as a &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;, cutting down all &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; remnants that crossed her path. Liadrin had previously aided in the reclamation of &lt;a href=\"Eversong\"&gt;Eversong&lt;/a&gt;, though while others remained behind to rebuild, Liadrin had vowed to end the Scourge forever and ventured to the undead-infested south. There, she dealt with her rage toward the Scourge in the best way she could\u2014destroying them at every turn. Though Arthas was out of her grasp, she believed that Dar'Khan Drathir was still out there and hunted him vigorously. As she exterminated the Scourge and hunted Dar'Khan, Liadrin dreamed of the day she would exact revenge in the names of Vandellor, Belo'vir, and all the other elves who had fallen due to Drathir's treachery. During this time, she was supplied with arcane objects by an anonymous source, though she had a vague idea of her benefactor's &lt;a href=\"Galell\"&gt;identity&lt;/a&gt;.\nLiadrin was one of the few aware of the alliance between Prince Kael'thas and &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;. Though she accepted that the elves needed to sate their innate thirst for the arcane with &lt;a href=\"mana%20crystal\"&gt;mana crystal&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Mana%20Tap\"&gt;mana tapping&lt;/a&gt;, she was wary of the &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; magic that the lord of &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; was known to embrace, and Liadrin was worried that this dark influence may rub off on the prince. Liadrin's eyes had since turned a brilliant emerald-green.\nLiadrin was summoned by the regent to Silvermoon, and Halduron (who she had nearly mauled with a mace after mistaking him for an intruder) took her to the royal palace, &lt;a href=\"Sunfury%20Spire\"&gt;Sunfury Spire&lt;/a&gt;, where she reunited with Lor'themar. Liadrin could barely believe her eyes: the city had been almost completely reclaimed and felt like home again. They were interrupted by Belo'vir's successor, &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Rommath\"&gt;Grand Magister Rommath&lt;/a&gt;, who made Liadrin a unique offer: the prince had sent back a subdued &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"M%27uru\"&gt;M'uru&lt;/a&gt; to Quel'Thalas, for the elves to drain for its magic. However, Rommath, &lt;a href=\"Astalor%20Bloodsworn\"&gt;Astalor Bloodsworn&lt;/a&gt;, and several other &lt;a href=\"magisters\"&gt;magisters&lt;/a&gt; were not content with this notion\u2014they believed they had found a far better use for the holy being's power.\nRommath told Liadrin that her life was led by extremities, be it the devout priestess or the ruthless warrior. He handed her a &lt;a href=\"Blood-Tempered%20Ranseur\"&gt;Blood-Tempered Ranseur&lt;/a&gt;, a weapon that symbolized the balance between her two paths, and offered her another option\u2014one that would allow her to utilize both of her chosen paths; indeed, through this, she would never be abandoned by the Light again. He introduced Liadrin to the captured M'uru, and he and Astalor assisted her in forging a link with the being. When Liadrin channeled the Light through it, there was no warmth or love, but there was power; if not at a moral cost, then a physically challenging one. Accepting the proposal, Liadrin was infused by M'uru's power and became the first of the Blood Knights, and a &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knight\"&gt;new era&lt;/a&gt; in Thalassian history was born.\nBlood of the Highborne.\nTaking up the mantle of Blood Knight Matriarch, Liadrin began to forge her new order; however, the Blood Knights were not initially met with praise. Indeed, many elves scorned them for their method of empowerment. Overlooking her knights' training with pride, Liadrin could only feel foolish for having been so beholden to the Light; \"why be a servant, when one can be a master?\" Liadrin presided over the reclamation of &lt;a href=\"Sunsail%20Anchorage\"&gt;Sunsail Anchorage&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Wretched\"&gt;Wretched&lt;/a&gt;, instructing her knights (among them &lt;a href=\"Champion%20Vranesh\"&gt;Vranesh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cyssa%20Dawnrose\"&gt;Cyssa Dawnrose&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mehlar%20Dawnblade\"&gt;Mehlar Dawnblade&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Champion%20Bachi\"&gt;Bachi&lt;/a&gt;) to work in tandem.\nStill, despite their services to Silvermoon, the knights' reputation did not improve as much as Liadrin had hoped. Cyssa was outraged at this, though Liadrin told her to give them time. Back in the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Blood\"&gt;Hall of Blood&lt;/a&gt;, Liadrin was met with the familiar sight of her former apprentice, Galell, who had come to apply to the Blood Knight order in the hopes of reconciling with the Light. Galell, who had struggled with his arcane addiction more so than many other elves, hoped to find deliverance in the Light once more. Liadrin maintained that there was little warmth in the path the Blood Knights tread, but that it may be in his best interests to feel the Light once more, even if he has to force it to recognize him. Liadrin promised that the road will not be an easy one, that his training will be testing, and that she will expect total obedience from him as a Blood Knight.\nThe Farstriders had noted an increase in Scourge activity around the &lt;a href=\"Dawnstar%20Spire\"&gt;former residence&lt;/a&gt; of Dar'Khan Drathir, and Liadrin and a contingent of knights went to investigate. They found a trapdoor and a diary, adorned with unfamiliar symbols. Believing it to be a clue, Liadrin took it. Later, she ventured to Lor'themar's office, catching him fletching arrows. The regent told her that while he had misgivings for the creation of the Blood Knights, their formation may have been for the best. Liadrin caught an intriguing glimpse of a letter bearing the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s symbol, and Lor'themar told her of his negotiations with them. Liadrin kept an open mind about an alliance with the Horde but privately worried whether &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, who had presented herself as her homeland's strongest ally, still truly possessed the nobility and good intentions she had as its ranger-general. Lor'themar, despite his personal misgivings regarding the knights' methods, believed that the Blood Knights may yet achieve something great to esteem them in the eyes of their critics and the Horde at large.\nLiadrin and Solanar took over the vigil at Dar'Khan's residence, though Galell had gone missing. Liadrin discovered a trail of blood and entrails, following it to Galell, who was spattered in troll gore. Later, Dar'Khan's diaries were deciphered, which mentioned that an individual named \"Thadirr\" would be collecting three important artifacts created by Grand Magister Belo'vir during the &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Wars\"&gt;Troll Wars&lt;/a&gt;: the &lt;a href=\"Stone%20of%20Light\"&gt;Stone of Light&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Stone%20of%20Flame\"&gt;Stone of Flame&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Stone%20of%20Spark\"&gt;Stone of Spark&lt;/a&gt;. Liadrin mused that with these items, the Scourge could be contested, which is likely why this person was keen on acquiring them before the sin'dorei. Liadrin informed Lor'themar that she would set a trap for this Thadirr, and Halduron told the two of the apparent re-emergence of Zul'jin and the Amani from &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt;.\nLiadrin was summoned by Rommath after she saw the grisly sight of a murdered elf called &lt;a href=\"Orovinn\"&gt;Orovinn&lt;/a&gt;, who had been hanged from the &lt;a href=\"Shepherd%27s%20Gate\"&gt;Shepherd's Gate&lt;/a&gt;. Rumors abounded that one of the Blood Knights was responsible, as Galell had been seen fleeing the night before and had gone missing. Vexed, Rommath left to discuss the negotiations between Quel'Thalas and the Horde with Kael'thas, and told Liadrin to solve this before he returned. Consensus among the Blood Knights was that Galell's magic intake was off-balance, or that M'uru's voice had driven him mad.\nAs it happens, the trap laid for Thadirr\u2014an anagram of &lt;a href=\"Dar%27Khan%20Drathir\"&gt;Drathir&lt;/a&gt;, the elves quickly realized\u2014was quite the opposite. The &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; had learned of the Blood Knights' emergence and planned to take them into his service in undeath, tasking the now lich-like Dar'Khan with this mission. While Lor'themar and Halduron arrived to fight off Dar'Khan and relieve the Blood Knights, Liadrin went to find Galell. She found her old apprentice in a &lt;a href=\"Wretched\"&gt;Wretched&lt;/a&gt;-like state in the old troll sacrificial chamber, and he admitted he had murdered his dealer, having been driven to madness by his excesses. Erratic and reduced to a pitiful wreck, yelling at Liadrin that this was the only way to suppress M'uru's voice, Galell lunged at her and began attacking. Liadrin was forced to kill him, his death raising the sharp question of whether or not she was walking the right path.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nLady Liadrin resided within the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Blood\"&gt;Blood Knight headquarters&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt;, next to the subdued &lt;a href=\"M%27uru\"&gt;M'uru&lt;/a&gt;. She oversaw the training of new members of the Blood Knight order and instructed members with tasks both mundane and martial, from helping to fund the order to taking the fight against the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; into southern &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; and even the &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands\"&gt;Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;. In an attempt to assert their authority over the light to all the \"so-called &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s\" of the world, Liadrin tasked high ranking members with burning and defiling the &lt;a href=\"Alonsus%20Chapel\"&gt;Alonsus Chapel&lt;/a&gt;.\nDespite its rapidly-increasing influence, however, the Blood Knight order took a massive blow after Prince Kael'thas sold his loyalties to the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, and stole M'uru from &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;. Liadrin observed the results of this treachery herself. With the order now without its source of power, a desperate Lady Liadrin traveled to &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt; to meet with its leader &lt;a href=\"A%27dal\"&gt;A'dal&lt;/a&gt;, another naaru, to find a new source of power. In doing so, Liadrin learned from &lt;a href=\"A%27dal\"&gt;A'dal&lt;/a&gt; that M'uru had known of his fate long ago, and had allowed himself to be manipulated by the blood elves \u2014 knowing that he would be the catalyst to their ultimate redemption (see quotes below) and that &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Prophet Velen&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; had learned of it some time ago. Inspired by this knowledge, Liadrin renounced her loyalty to &lt;a href=\"Sunstrider%20dynasty\"&gt;House Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; and fought alongside the newly-formed &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Sun%20Offensive\"&gt;Shattered Sun Offensive&lt;/a&gt; to end Kael's dark ambitions on the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Isle of Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt; and finally to restoring Silvermoon to its greatness.\nIn her absence, her second-in-command &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Solanar%20Bloodwrath\"&gt;Lord Solanar Bloodwrath&lt;/a&gt; has taken on the role of training aspiring Blood Knight masters within Silvermoon. Without Liadrin personally present to put the Blood Knights' political interests on the table, &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Rommath\"&gt;Grand Magister Rommath&lt;/a&gt; represented them in &lt;a href=\"Sunfury%20Spire\"&gt;Sunfury Spire&lt;/a&gt; in her place.\nFury of the Sunwell.\nFollowing the death of Kael'thas, along with the darkened M'uru and the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;, Liadrin travels to the site of the defiled &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt; alongside &lt;a href=\"Prophet%20Velen\"&gt;Prophet Velen&lt;/a&gt;. She laments that the blood elves may never be able to atone for the sin they committed in damning M'uru to his fate, though Velen acquires the \"heart\" of M'uru, and channels it into the Sunwell. In a massive blaze of light, the font of power is restored, which Velen notes may be the start of a rebirth in the soul of a &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;nation&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the victory at the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell%20Plateau\"&gt;Sunwell Plateau&lt;/a&gt;, Lady Liadrin witnessed the rebirth of the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt; firsthand. Acknowledging the road ahead as a hard one, Liadrin has since rekindled a far more positive relationship with the light. The Blood Knight matriarch has turned her attention to freeing her people from their magical addiction once and for all, and restoring the sin'dorei to their greatness.\nIn the Shadow of the Sun.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;'s brief assault on the &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;heart of the Horde's powerbase&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Lady Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; moved to recruit the sin'dorei forces to aid in the despoiler of Quel'Thalas' downfall\u2014the Blood Knights included. After &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; committed to the war effort, the regent lord planned to have &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Rommath\"&gt;Grand Magister Rommath&lt;/a&gt; represent Liadrin's interests until she arrives. Rommath later sends word to Liadrin herself, reporting back to the regent lord with the Blood Knight matriarch's preparations for the war.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nDuring their quest to restore &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Delar\"&gt;Quel'Delar&lt;/a&gt;, adventurers were admitted access to the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Halduron%20Brightwing\"&gt;Halduron Brightwing&lt;/a&gt;. Within, Lady Liadrin was seen speaking to groups of blood elf pilgrims about the battles the sin'dorei have yet to face, and how it felt to see the Sunwell restored.\nWith her faith in the Light restored, Liadrin continued to train and teach new paladins to embrace the Light, rather than twisting it to serve their own needs.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nFollowing on from \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;The Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;'s\" &lt;a href=\"Sunwell%20Plateau%20epilogue\"&gt;epilogue&lt;/a&gt;, Liadrin is depicted as having a much more positive relationship with the Light.\nLiadrin accompanies &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and other Horde heroes to join forces with &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Archmage Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; and members of the Alliance in fighting off the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt; invasion. She is among the first to travel through the altered Dark Portal, directing the coalition against the Iron Horde forces. Liadrin is sickened by the depravity of the Iron Horde and aims to wipe them off the face of . Liadrin survives the assault in &lt;a href=\"Tanaan%20Jungle\"&gt;Tanaan Jungle&lt;/a&gt;, and can be found battling the Iron Horde and healing the wounds of Frostwolf and draenei stragglers throughout the escape attempt. She meets captured &lt;a href=\"Yrel\"&gt;Yrel&lt;/a&gt; during the battle against the and escorts her back to the group. After the is destroyed and an Iron Horde ship is procured, Liadrin and the rest of the Horde forces end up in &lt;a href=\"Frostfire%20Ridge\"&gt;Frostfire Ridge&lt;/a&gt;.\nLiadrin commands a &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knights\"&gt;Blood Knight&lt;/a&gt;-led sin'dorei force named the &lt;a href=\"Sunsworn\"&gt;Sunsworn&lt;/a&gt;. After detecting the presence of &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s in neighboring &lt;a href=\"Talador\"&gt;Talador&lt;/a&gt;, Liadrin and her forces arrive at to assist &lt;a href=\"Exarch%20Maladaar%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Exarch Maladaar&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Auchenai%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Auchenai&lt;/a&gt; in defending this most sacred of draenei precincts. Liadrin swears that not a single demon will enter the grounds on her watch, and hopes to halt the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; threat before it can engulf all of Draenor. She directs &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; members in the region to drive the Legion out and keep the spiritual well out of &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;'s hands.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Teron%27gor\"&gt;Teron'gor&lt;/a&gt; is identified as Liadrin and Maladaar's opponent and the is fought off from Auchindoun, Liadrin returns to &lt;a href=\"Sunsworn%20Camp\"&gt;Sunsworn Camp&lt;/a&gt; to plan her next move. She and &lt;a href=\"Astalor%20Bloodsworn\"&gt;Astalor Bloodsworn&lt;/a&gt; then relocate to &lt;a href=\"Retribution%20Point\"&gt;Retribution Point&lt;/a&gt; to rendezvous with Maladaar when &lt;a href=\"Leafshadow\"&gt;Leafshadow&lt;/a&gt; is recovered and Auchindoun's defenses are heightened. The two leaders depart to assist the player at the scoured &lt;a href=\"Remains%20of%20Xandros\"&gt;Remains of Xandros&lt;/a&gt;, arriving in time to battle the &lt;a href=\"pit%20lord\"&gt;pit lord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mongrethod\"&gt;Mongrethod&lt;/a&gt;; Liadrin destroys the annihilan with a &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;-based attack while Maladaar immobilizes him. Victorious, Liadrin has &lt;a href=\"Knight-Lord%20Dranarus\"&gt;Knight-Lord Dranarus&lt;/a&gt; relay their victory back to &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Warchief Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter is attacked and seized by the Shadow Council and the &lt;a href=\"Sargerei\"&gt;Sargerei&lt;/a&gt;, Liadrin moves her forces to the &lt;a href=\"Spire%20of%20Light\"&gt;Spire of Light&lt;/a&gt; to fight the invaders back alongside the Auchenai and &lt;a href=\"Sha%27tari%20Defense\"&gt;Sha'tari Defense&lt;/a&gt;. When &lt;a href=\"Exarch%20Othaar\"&gt;Socrethar&lt;/a&gt;'s lieutenants are slain, Liadrin goads the treacherous former exarch into battle and confronts him at Maladaar's side. With his death, Liadrin is confident that the Auchenai will soon be able to reclaim their city.\nShe is later seen with the other Horde leaders at the Gates of Tanaan confronting Warchief Grommash after the death of &lt;a href=\"Azuka%20Bladefury\"&gt;Azuka Bladefury&lt;/a&gt;.\nFury of Hellfire.\nAfter takes over the Iron Horde, Liadrin and her Blood Knights begin searching for a way to cure Gul'dan's &lt;a href=\"fel%20orc\"&gt;fel orc&lt;/a&gt;s. She enlists the aid of &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Hunter%20Denjai\"&gt;Shadow Hunter Denjai&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s in this endeavor. Upon hearing of renewed Shadow Council activity within Auchindoun, she and Yrel return and discover it to be under attack by the &lt;a href=\"Sargerei\"&gt;Sargerei&lt;/a&gt;. They are able to push the traitorous Draenei out and discover Teron'gor had continued devouring souls up until he was recovered by &lt;a href=\"Tyrant%20Velhari\"&gt;Tyrant Velhari&lt;/a&gt;. Teron'gor, now calling himself Gorefiend, is cut off from his feast of souls and Auchindoun is saved once again as Gorefiend leaves for .\nLegion.\nLiadrin, along with Rommath, is present in Durotar during &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt;'s funeral and &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;'s inauguration as Warchief of the Horde. After the disaster at the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, Liadrin convenes with the leaders of Azeroth's other paladin orders in Dalaran. She then travels to the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20Light\"&gt;Sanctum of Light&lt;/a&gt;, a hidden refuge located beneath &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt;, and pledges the aid of the Blood Knights to the reformed &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; and its new Highlord. Her service is recommended by &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Maxwell%20Tyrosus\"&gt;Lord Maxwell Tyrosus&lt;/a&gt;, and Liadrin becomes the Highlord's second champion.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; attack the sanctum to seize the body of &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt;, Maxwell is subdued by &lt;a href=\"Darion%20Mograine\"&gt;Darion Mograine&lt;/a&gt;, and Liadrin serves as the paladins' last line of defense before Tirion's tomb. There, she battles the new &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Deathlord&lt;/a&gt; of the Ebon Blade but is defeated. As the death knights begin their ritual to call Fordring to undeath, the Light itself intercedes and Darion's body is destroyed. Liadrin claims that the Ebon Blade were fools to have taken this course, as not even the Lich King himself has power on this holy ground. Faced with the fall of the Ebon Blade, the Deathlord and their &lt;a href=\"Four%20Horsemen\"&gt;Four Horsemen&lt;/a&gt; flee the sanctum through a hastily-conjured &lt;a href=\"Death%20Gate\"&gt;Death Gate&lt;/a&gt;, leaving with only Darion's corpse.\nIf the player is a paladin, Liadrin will accompany them during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Exodar\"&gt;Battle for the Exodar&lt;/a&gt;, along with &lt;a href=\"Maxwell%20Tyrosus\"&gt;Maxwell Tyrosus&lt;/a&gt;. She will briefly reunite with &lt;a href=\"Prophet%20Velen\"&gt;Prophet Velen&lt;/a&gt;, who is pleased at how much Liadrin had taken to the Light following the battle against the Legion at the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell%20Plateau\"&gt;Sunwell Plateau&lt;/a&gt;.\nInsurrection.\nLiadrin and her Blood Knights, accompanied by Rommath and his magisters, travel to &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt; to support the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen\"&gt;Nightfallen&lt;/a&gt; rebels in their attempt to seize the city from its Burning Legion-aligned masters. Liadrin sympathizes with the Nightfallen, drawing parallels to the blood elves and their own experiences with &lt;a href=\"Magical%20addiction\"&gt;addiction&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;betrayal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;years prior&lt;/a&gt;. She believes that the sin'dorei understand the Nightfallen's plight better than any other. Liadrin has bulletins and posters put up within Suramar City itself to spread word of the Horde's arrival, to offer hope to the Nightborne populace and show them that a future lies beyond the chaos. She allies with &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; and her forces, who had also answered the call to war, and both night and blood elves enter Suramar to scout and prepare for an attack.\nLiadrin is critical of the elven forces within the Alliance camp. Liadrin refuses to allow &lt;a href=\"Vereesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Vereesa Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; to protect the coalition's flank, stating that Vereesa is too obsessed with vengeance on the Horde to be trusted. She also does not consider Tyrande's sentinels suitable for this type of direct battlefield, believing that Tyrande should recuse her forces from the main assault and focus on scouting. Liadrin states that her Blood Knights are the only ones prepared to carry the weight of this conflict.\nWhen a council for war is called, Liadrin and Rommath meet with Khadgar and the Nightfallen leader, &lt;a href=\"First%20Arcanist%20Thalyssra\"&gt;First Arcanist Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt;. Liadrin tells Thalyssra that her people's struggle echoes the sin'dorei's own, and pledges to cleanse Suramar of the Legion. On the eve of battle, Liadrin, like Tyrande, is somewhat ashamed to admit that her forces have been exchanging offensive items and insults with the other elven camp and has adventurers clean both camps of such items before insults turn into violence.\nLiadrin and her sin'dorei join up with the Thalyssra and her shal'dorei to lead the charge into Suramar, supported by Tyrande. The combined elven army successfully breaches the city and strikes straight to the foot of the Nighthold, but the kaldorei, sin'dorei, quel'dorei, and shal'dorei are confronted by &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magistrix%20Elisande\"&gt;Grand Magistrix Elisande&lt;/a&gt; herself. When she turns to address Liadrin, the magistrix expresses some anger that the sin'dorei would oppose her, having believed that they, of all elves, might have understood the choice Elisande made to save her people.\nUsing her great powers over time magic, Elisande traps the entire elven army in a time stasis and leaves. Liadrin is able to escape when Khadgar returns to break her and Tyrande out of the spell, but the rest of their forces remain frozen in time on the steps before the Nighthold, the battle lost.\nLiadrin takes part in the siege of the Nighthold, and is present when &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; kills &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;. When Thalyssra and her advisors relocate to the site of the &lt;a href=\"Nightwell\"&gt;Nightwell&lt;/a&gt;, which has become unstable without the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Aman%27thul\"&gt;Eye of Aman'thul&lt;/a&gt;, Liadrin and Tyrande observe whether the first arcanist will save it or let it die. Liadrin is impressed when Thalyssra chooses the latter, and believes that given time, the nightborne will be able overcome the Nightwell's allure and prosper.\nPrior to &lt;a href=\"Assault%20on%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Assault on Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, she was present in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, standing at &lt;a href=\"Krasus%27%20Landing\"&gt;Krasus' Landing&lt;/a&gt; with the other representatives of the &lt;a href=\"class%20order\"&gt;class order&lt;/a&gt;s.\nArgus.\nLiadrin answers &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Prophet Velen&lt;/a&gt;'s call to war and leads the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; forces to the \"&lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt;\", sailing to &lt;a href=\"Azuremyst\"&gt;Azuremyst&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; aboard \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Sunstrider\"&gt;The Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;\". From there, she travels to &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt; aboard the draenei's new &lt;a href=\"dimensional%20ship\"&gt;dimensional ship&lt;/a&gt;, the \"&lt;a href=\"Vindicaar\"&gt;Vindicaar&lt;/a&gt;\". Once there, &lt;a href=\"Silgryn\"&gt;Silgryn&lt;/a&gt; speaks to Liadrin about how seeing Argus makes him realize the fate that almost befell &lt;a href=\"Nightborne\"&gt;his people&lt;/a&gt;. He asks how Liadrin's people found their own path forward, to which she responds that the Horde has become allies with which together the blood elves have struggled through dark times and find strength. Silgryn thanks her and says that she has given him much to ponder.\nLiadrin can also be found at &lt;a href=\"Darkfall%20Ridge\"&gt;Darkfall Ridge&lt;/a&gt; where she fights demons seeking to reach the \"Vindicaar\".\nAftermath.\nWith the war against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; finished, Liadrin attended a private victory feast in Orgrimmar along with &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar\"&gt;Lor'themar&lt;/a&gt; and the other leaders of the Horde.\nLiadrin remained close with the nightborne of Suramar following Thalyssra's successful return to power. Liadrin and Lor'themar agreed that the shal'dorei and sin'dorei kingdoms have much in common, and began making overtures to form an alliance. Liadrin suggested the nightborne as a potentially strong ally when Warchief Sylvanas summoned the Horde's leaders to recruit new members, and Sylvanas, intrigued by what Suramar's resources could bring to the Horde, approved. Liadrin then left for Thalyssra's estate, bearing an invitation to &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;, and reunited with the first arcanist. Thalyssra, who weighed the respect and compassion Liadrin and her people showed the nightborne against Tyrande's hostility and only grudging support, was already receptive to joining the Horde, and discussed the other misgivings she felt for the Alliance with Liadrin. Accepting the invitation to Silvermoon, Thalyssra then left for the blood elf capital, in whose &lt;a href=\"Sunfury%20Spire\"&gt;palace&lt;/a&gt; Liadrin formally introduced her to Quel'Thalas' regent lord. &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; was also in attendance, and exchanged pleasantries with Liadrin, having fought together recently on Argus.\nLiadrin, Lor'themar, Rommath, Alleria, and the nightborne retinue then departed for the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;. Liadrin confirmed to Alleria that its energies had been &lt;a href=\"Sunwell%20Plateau%20epilogue\"&gt;changed&lt;/a&gt; since its destruction and restoration, and now sustains their people with the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;. When Alleria (who had consumed the &lt;a href=\"void\"&gt;void&lt;/a&gt; on Argus) stepped near the well, corruption erupted and void beasts poured into the chamber, seeking to claim the Sunwell. Liadrin and the others fought off the void agents, as well as a void monstrosity, long enough for Rommath, Alleria, and Thalyssra to close the void rift before the well was lost. In the battle's aftermath, Thalyssra pledged &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt; to the Horde, and accompanied Liadrin back to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; to meet with Sylvanas.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; called upon the champions of each &lt;a href=\"class%20order\"&gt;order&lt;/a&gt; to draw the corruption out of the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Sword of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, Liadrin carried the &lt;a href=\"Ashbringer\"&gt;Ashbringer&lt;/a&gt; if the player was not a paladin, representing the Silver Hand.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nLiadrin is one of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; commanders during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Stromgarde\"&gt;Battle for Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt;, leading the forces of the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Kingdom of Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, and carrying the banner of the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knights\"&gt;Blood Knights&lt;/a&gt; once again. There appears to have been a splintering in the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Order of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;, as &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt;'s forces carry the banner of the order while Liadrin does not.\nIt is possible for her to face off against Turalyon, where he scoffs at the idea of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; being led by a &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;, questioning what has happened on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; to allow this. He then claims he will take pleasure in enacting justice from a \"misguided paladin of the Horde\". \nLiadrin alongside Lor'themar helps blood elves who are level 120 and Exalted with Silvermoon City to go through an annual ritual remembering the losses of the blood elves to the Scourge, earning their &lt;a href=\"heritage%20armor\"&gt;heritage armor&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen Horde heroes arrived on the Alliance gunship &lt;a href=\"Faction%20Assault%20on%20Zuldazar\"&gt;assaulting Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt;, Liadrin encouraged them to strike at a critical target and hold nothing back. Following the destruction of the airship, she declared that the hero earned a moment for themselves, while the soldiers continued on the fight.\nShe later attended the funeral of &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the funeral, Liadrin can be seen leaving &lt;a href=\"Pathfinder%27s%20Den\"&gt;Pathfinder's Den&lt;/a&gt; with a retinue of &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knights\"&gt;Blood Knights&lt;/a&gt; from Silvermoon. As they march into Orgrimmar, she explains that they are to root out any signs of &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;'s corruption, spare those who turned away from Sylvanas, and to keep unity and order in the city.\nShadowlands.\nIn light of a resurgence of &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, Liadrin traveled to &lt;a href=\"Oribos\"&gt;Oribos&lt;/a&gt; to recruit &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;blood elf champions&lt;/a&gt;. She then attended a meeting with &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Rommath\"&gt;Grand Magister Rommath&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Aethas%20Sunreaver\"&gt;Aethas Sunreaver&lt;/a&gt; where they learned that &lt;a href=\"Tranquillien\"&gt;Tranquillien&lt;/a&gt; was in danger of falling to the Scourge, with Aethas noting that the Scourge was too focused for it be a random attack, and voiced calling upon the Horde for aid. However, Rommath countered that they couldn't wait and had to deal with the Scourge immediately. Liadrin agreed with Rommath's assessment and was able to convince Lor'themar that it would be best to call upon those still in training to hold the line and keep Quel'Thalas safe. She subsequently tempered &lt;a href=\"Salandria\"&gt;Salandria&lt;/a&gt;, her adopted daughter and paladin trainee, excitement by informing her that it would be no easy task, that more would be expected of her than any other. Thus Salandria promised to prove herself and Liadrin ordered her to scout beyond the &lt;a href=\"Dead%20Scar\"&gt;Dead Scar&lt;/a&gt; and return to Tranquillien to report.\nLiadrin and the champion then took Rommath's portal to Tranquillien, during this time she requested that the champion keep an eye on Salandria, as while she had excelled in her training, she has yet to be tested like this. The first thing Liadrin noticed was how the Scourge were mustered in numbers like during the &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20invasion%20of%20Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Scourge invasion of Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; and called upon the champion to aid her in thinning their numbers. During this time Aethas discovered that the Scourge were under the command of the &lt;a href=\"san%27layn\"&gt;san'layn&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Vorath\"&gt;Vorath&lt;/a&gt;. With that task completed, Liadrin learned from Salandria that there were more Scourge than anticipated at &lt;a href=\"Deatholme\"&gt;Deatholme&lt;/a&gt; and that Vorath was using a crystal array, which Rommath determined was how Vorath was able to cheat death. The group then determined that the best way forward would be to imbue a weapon with the proper power in order to send Vorath to the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt; for good.\nShe then declared that the &lt;a href=\"Forged%20Ranseur\"&gt;Forged Ranseur&lt;/a&gt;, would be their instrument of the light. Remarking that ranseur needed to be empowered, Liadrin requested that they seek out the &lt;a href=\"kyrian\"&gt;kyrian&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Bastion\"&gt;Bastion&lt;/a&gt;, who are masters of ushering &lt;a href=\"Soul\"&gt;souls&lt;/a&gt; to their proper places, and the &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxi\"&gt;Maldraxxi&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxus\"&gt;Maldraxxus&lt;/a&gt;, who are intimately familiar with the trappings of death, and equally familiar with how to subvert it, to counter act against Vorath. Thus the champion departed to the Shadowlands, with Salandria by their side. The pair were successful in their mission and returned the empowered ranseur to Liadrin, who declared that it was now time to show their full might on the battlefield. She then called upon the champion to take the empowered ranseur, and cut a swath of destruction through the Scourge, which successfully trapped Vorath within Deatholme. Determined to put an end to the invasion once and for all, the blood elves stormed Deatholme, and killed Vorath. With Vorath's death, Liadrin noticed how the Scourge began to scatter and declared that the remnants could be taken care of in time.\nAfter declaring their victory, Liadrin noted that the power within the ranseur had been spent, and requested that the champion meet back in the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Blood\"&gt;Hall of Blood&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt; to celebrate their victory. As a reward, she gave them the &lt;a href=\"Elusive%20Emerald%20Hawkstrider\"&gt;Elusive Emerald Hawkstrider&lt;/a&gt;. For &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knights\"&gt;Blood Knights&lt;/a&gt;, Liadrin bestowed upon them .\nThe Vow Eternal.\nA few years later, Liadrin served as the official officiator for the wedding of &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thalyssra\"&gt;Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle with Lady Liadrin.\nHer solitude could be an underestimation of her power. Once you enter battle, her speed is immense and her attack power is high enough to take a well-geared level 70 player down in a matter of seconds. Although, with a well-geared healer and a high amount of mana per 5 seconds, you can take Liadrin down with three people. A tank, a healer, and a dps or two. Be aware that with three people it is a very long fight, around 15\u201320 minutes, but the reward is great. She drops anywhere from 60 gold to 100 gold.\nThe being &lt;a href=\"M%27uru\"&gt;M'uru&lt;/a&gt;, also in the chamber, was a friendly unit to Alliance members though would not aid in the attack, even if the beams from the magi were broken.\nPersonality.\nAs a priestess, Liadrin was devout, faithful, and pious. She took pride in her role as a preserver of life and was content, guided by King &lt;a href=\"Anasterian\"&gt;Anasterian&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;. Though not disparaging of other races, Liadrin prioritized her own people's well-being, and considered it a positive thing for the elves to have distanced themselves from the outside world prior to the Third War. Liadrin's will was tested during the Scourge invasion, in which her ability to wield the Light was hampered by the growing dread she felt at seeing the undead hordes lay waste to her kingdom. Her ability to properly channel the Light began to falter in the face of these horrors, a crisis she blamed the Light itself for.\nLiadrin was jaded and dispassionate by the Third War's aftermath. She believed the Light, in its fickleness, had failed not only her, but Quel'Thalas itself, and swore off its use. She also dealt with a great sense of guilt, having lost elves in the war (including her &lt;a href=\"Vandellor\"&gt;foster father&lt;/a&gt;) whom she had respected and loved, yet had survived herself. Vengeful, Liadrin reinvented herself as a warrior, and dedicated her life to exterminating the Scourge. &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Rommath\"&gt;Grand Magister Rommath&lt;/a&gt; believed that Liadrin's life had been led by extremities, from a pious priestess to a ruthless warrior. Liadrin found balance as the first Blood Knight, allowing her to reconcile her two walks of life on her own terms. One trait that persisted from her days as a priestess was Liadrin's strong belief in the importance of unity, which she instilled within the Blood Knights. Liadrin rekindled her passion for the Light after the restoration of the Sunwell, which now channels holy energies as well as arcane. \nThough ruthless in battle and possessing an intense hatred for most of the sin'dorei's enemies, Liadrin is not without mercy. She is a pragmatist who sees no value in excessive cruelty or brutality. \nArsenal and abilities.\nLiadrin wielded a staff while she was a priestess, and like most priests she could also invoke the Light through hand gestures and mental concentration. Though primarily a healer, Liadrin was also versed in more dangerous priest abilities, such as the ability to transfer pain from herself to another. She once attacked the Amani chieftain &lt;a href=\"Zul%27jin\"&gt;Zul'jin&lt;/a&gt; himself with such an ability.\nAfter swearing off the Light, Liadrin reinvented herself as a fighter and chose a mace as her weapon of choice, requesting some of the &lt;a href=\"Farstriders\"&gt;Farstriders&lt;/a&gt; to train her with it.

Unlike other alternate heroes, Lady Liadrin is not obtained through a microtransaction; instead, she is obtained through a special \"World of Warcraft\" promotion that includes leveling at least one \"WoW\" character to level 20, which rewards the &lt;a href=\"Fledgling%20Hero%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;Fledgling Hero of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt; achievement. Her flavor text reads: \"\"Since the restoration of the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;, the Blood Knight Matriarch's mood seems, well, sunnier!\"\"\nSpeculation.\nLady Liadrin's interactions with &lt;a href=\"Prophet%20Velen\"&gt;Prophet Velen&lt;/a&gt; (and by extension, the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt;), along with her status as a Light-wielder, have led to some speculation regarding her future: pertaining to the naaru prophecy of the &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Army of the Light&lt;/a&gt;. Velen's \"direct\" intervention to assist the blood elves and restore their &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt; as a fount of &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt; could be considered conspicuous, as Velen himself has been noted as rarely leaving the \"&lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt;\" for anything unrelated to preparations for the looming battle against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, which the Army of the Light is, according to the naaru, destined to counter.\nAs such, it is possible that the prophet intervened for more than merely an altruistic purpose: perhaps helping Liadrin and her Blood Knights find the Light again will have larger ramifications down the line. Liadrin has since developed a positive relationship with the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;, having fought beside them against the Legion on both &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and . Considering the Army of the Light now being aligned with the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; as well as Liadrin's hostile actions towards the Alliance and &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt;, the leader, it is probably no longer possible. Turalyon even condemned Liadrin for what she did in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Stromgarde\"&gt;Battle for Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt;.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

She made a pact with the &lt;a href=\"Drust\"&gt;Drust&lt;/a&gt;, seeking to use their power to save her ailing husband. \nHistory.\nMeredith disapproved of her daughter &lt;a href=\"Lucille%20Waycrest\"&gt;Lucille's&lt;/a&gt; marriage to &lt;a href=\"Alexander%20Treadward\"&gt;Alexander Treadward&lt;/a&gt; for he was a common merchant. On the day of their wedding Meredith hired &lt;a href=\"Roland%20the%20Knife\"&gt;Roland the Knife&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Hand\"&gt;Red Hand&lt;/a&gt; to assassinate Alexander.\nLucille was aware that she had a cruel streak, but like everyone else had no clue her own mother was behind Alexander's murder.\nAs matron of House Waycrest, Meredith didn't have much in the say of rule, being much more reserved when it came to political talk. This would all change when a rumor sprung up about her husband being deadly sick, with her locking herself with him in their chambers out of grief. Stricken with grief due to her ailing husband, Lady Waycrest called out to any power that could save him. The Drust king &lt;a href=\"Gorak%20Tul\"&gt;Gorak Tul&lt;/a&gt; answered her cry and promised that death would never part the couple, for a price. She started to recruit girls to her newly formed Coven and taught them in the way of Drust magic. Their ultimate goal was to bring the Drust back to the realm of the living.\nThen one day, she came out of her solitude, assuring the people that all was fine. The only thing the villagers found odd about her return is that she had taken control of the men. All seemed normal until the disappearances began and the guards were put under a spell. With Corlain under the control of the Coven, Meredith sent out her followers to recruit more witches and begin the return of the Drust king. Despite the efforts by the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20Embers\"&gt;Order of Embers&lt;/a&gt; to stop the return, the Coven were successful.\nNow calling herself 'the Mother' as head of the coven, Meredith tapped so freely into Tul's power that it emanates from the very walls of &lt;a href=\"Waycrest%20Manor\"&gt;Waycrest Manor&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the Order of Embers took down the barrier at Upper Corlain, they rushed all the way to the foot point of Waycrest Manor. Lucille and the rest were in shock, as they found out that the true identity of the Mother was quite literal in Lucille's case. Meredith also revealed that she intended on her undead husband becoming Lord of all Kul Tiras, and invited Lucille to join them. She corrupted &lt;a href=\"Marshal%20Everit%20Reade\"&gt;Marshal Everit Reade&lt;/a&gt; and left him to deal with the others. Once the Marshal was put to rest, the Order of Embers rushed to Waycrest Manor to end Meredith.\nHowever, Lady Waycrest was merely a vessel for Gorak Tul's power and her death opened the &lt;a href=\"Rupture%20%28Waycrest%20Manor%29\"&gt;Rupture&lt;/a&gt;, the doorway for the Drust to enter Azeroth. At the Rupture, Gorak Tul was able to raise his people from the dead, but he was banished back to &lt;a href=\"Thros\"&gt;Thros&lt;/a&gt; nonetheless. With his defeat, the Heartsbane Coven was broken and Drustvar was released from Gorak Tul's power."}

Sporebat adds appear in phase 3.\nLady Vashj.\nLady Vashj can be taunted.\nPhase 1 and 3 abilities:\nPhase 2 ability:\n&lt;a href=\"Enchanted%20Elemental\"&gt;Enchanted Elemental&lt;/a&gt;.\nMany of these elementals spawn continuously from the water at the foot of the stairs during phase 2.\n&lt;a href=\"Tainted%20Elemental\"&gt;Tainted Elemental&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvery 50 seconds, one Tainted Elemental spawns instead of an enchanted elemental.\n&lt;a href=\"Coilfang%20Elite\"&gt;Coilfang Elite&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvery 45 seconds one Coilfang Elite spawns in the area on top of the stairs.\n&lt;a href=\"Coilfang%20Strider\"&gt;Coilfang Strider&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvery 60 seconds one Coilfang Strider spawns on top of the stairs.\n&lt;a href=\"Toxic%20Spore%20Bat\"&gt;Toxic Spore Bat&lt;/a&gt;s.\nDuring phase 3, these bats spawn. At first they're few, but their number steadily increases.\nStrategy.\nPreparation.\nThe fight consists of three phases: Phase 1 and 3 are the same, except for the spore bat adds in phase 3. Phase 2 is the real test of a raid's ability to work together\u2014every single raid member is important, and has ample opportunity to cause a wipe.\nPositioning.\nPositioning is all-important during phase 2. In phase 1 it's only important that the raid spreads out (to minimize damage from her Static Charge). Thus it's advisable to have everybody set up close to their phase 2 positions. The phase 2 positions are:\nDuring phase 1, all healers should be in healing range of the MT.\nPhase 1.\nA standard &lt;a href=\"misdirection\"&gt;misdirection&lt;/a&gt; pull does the job. She hits rather hard, so the healers should pre-cast. This phase is rather easy, mainly a practice run for phase 3. The main goal is to keep everybody alive. The only problems are caused by her special attacks. \nStatic Charge victims must stay away from everybody else, and require some healing. If the MT gets it he moves to the middle and all other melee classes should stay away from him.\nPhase 2.\nAt 70%, Vashj runs to the middle of her platform and surrounds herself in a shield that makes her invulnerable. To take down the shield, the raid must deactivate the four Shield Generators around her by using a Tainted Core (from the Tainted Elementals) on each. Four different types of adds spawn during the entire second phase:\nThere is a brief 40-second lull at the start of phase 2, which allows everybody to get into position. There are 12 stairs; many raids divide them into four sections of 3 stairs each (N, W, S and E), and assign a team of two ranged damage dealers and one healer to each section. The enchanted elementals have rather low HP, and a single damage dealer can kill one easily before it reaches the Lady. Unfortunately they're frost immune, so frost mages must somewhat deviate from their standard practice.\nThe Coilfang Elites should be quickly grabbed by the tank, and moved to the inner circle. The melee group should kill each before the next one spawns.\nCoilfang Striders need to be &lt;a href=\"kite\"&gt;kite&lt;/a&gt;d. The usual kite path is a wide circle outside the shield generators. Everyone with the ability to cast a &lt;a href=\"DoT\"&gt;DoT&lt;/a&gt; (including the healers) should all put DoTs on the strider whenever it comes in range. Kiting is facilitated by slowing the Strider as much as possible. All classes should use all means available (mages should spam slow, shamans use frost shock, &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Exhaustion\"&gt;CoEx&lt;/a&gt; from Warlocks, Paladins can &lt;a href=\"Hammer%20of%20Justice\"&gt;Hammer&lt;/a&gt; it whenever it gets close, and Druids can use &lt;a href=\"Entangling%20Roots\"&gt;Root&lt;/a&gt;). Tailors should bring &lt;a href=\"Netherweave%20Net\"&gt;Netherweave Net&lt;/a&gt;s and use them liberally, however one must use care not to net a Strider next to a healer or tank (save applied to druids' roots). After patch 3.0.2 it's no longer required to kite them at all if you can get a druid to keep the strider rooted all the time.\nTainted Elementals.\nWhen a Tainted Elemental spawns, it is imperative that it be killed as quickly as possible because it despawns after 20 seconds. If more than two despawn, a wipe is highly probable because the extra Elites and Striders are too much. \nAfter the kill, the &lt;a href=\"Tainted%20Core%20%28item%29\"&gt;Tainted Core (item)&lt;/a&gt; must be looted. The looting player must then use it to deactivate a Shield Generator. Voice communication helps a lot in coordinating the handling of the cores.\nThe moment to switch off the last generator should be well-controlled, because the Striders and Coilfang Elites should be as low as possible when phase 3 starts. As a rule of thumb, there should be at most a half-dead Strider, a full Elite, and a nearly dead Elite left over at the start of phase 3 in order to prevent a wipe. It's safe to delay until about 10\u201312 seconds before the next Strider/Elite spawn. Don't wait longer because the Bigwigs timers can be somewhat inaccurate and the adds are actually \"up\" some time before they become visible.\nPhase 3.\nThis phase starts with a reset of the aggro table. It's basically Phase 1 with a twist - Spore Bats start to spawn. They come slowly at first, but gradually their number increases to the point where it becomes very hard to avoid the AoE poison. After about four minutes of Phase 3, raid members usually start dying from poison.\nAt first, all remaining phase 2 adds must be killed. During the first few minutes of Phase 3, a few hunters and warlocks can kill enough Spore Bats so that they don't cause a real problem. When too many Bats spawn, the Spore Bat killers should switch to Vashj. The top of the west stairs is a good position from which to kill the Spore Bats.\nIn effect, the Spore Bats are sort of an Enrage timer. Knowing how to avoid the poison patches, and having a skilled tank keeping her on the move can make quite a difference to the lethality of this \"enrage\".\nUseful Macros.\nFor netting striders and notifying the current target of the strider (also works for the Pally stun, just replace /use with /cast Hammer of Justice):\n /use Netherweave Net\n /script SendChatMessage(string.format(\"Netting %s's Strider!\",UnitName(\"targettarget\")),\"YELL\");\n /script SendChatMessage(\"Netting your Strider!\", \"whisper\",nil,UnitName(\"TargetTarget\"));\nTo facilitate the targeting and killing of Tainted Elementals, the following macro sets the Tainted Elemental as focus target and casts \"Some Spell\" on it if it is alive. If it is not alive, it keeps the current target if it is an enemy (healers shouldn't use this if they count on targeting to heal, or they can replace the last line with /targetlasttarget). If the elemental is out of range or LoS, it produces an error messages, but at least the Tainted Elemental is now the focus target so it's easier to find:\n /cleartarget\n /focus\n /targetexact Tainted Elemental\n /focus [exists, nodead]\n /cast [target=focus, exists, nodead] Some Spell\n /targetlastenemy\nTo cast some spell (usually a DoT) on the Strider, this macro assumes that the kiter remains the same and the kiters name is known:\n /assist [target=KiterName, nodead]\n /cast &lt;Some Spell&gt;\n /targetlasttarget\nSimilarly, the following can be used to heal the kiter without changing target. The [] treats the spell as a normal spell if the kiter is dead:\n /cast [target=KiterName, nodead][] Some Heal spell\nThe following two macros do the same as those above, except for using focus instead of kiter name. In order to set the kiter as focus, use the macro while pressing &lt;shift&gt;.\nDoT the kiter's target:\n /clearfocus [modifier:shift]\n /clearfocus [target=focus, dead]\n /focus [target=focus, dead][target=focus, noexists] \n /assist [target=focus, nodead] \n /cast Some DoT\n /stopmacro [target=focus, dead]\n /targetlasttarget\nThe /stopmacro allows the macro to cast the DoT normally if there's no (or a dead) focus target.\nHeal the Kiter:\n /clearfocus [modifier:shift]\n /clearfocus [target=focus, dead]\n /focus [target=focus, dead][target=focus, noexists] \n /cast [target=focus, nodead][] Some Heal\nAs before, the [] allows the heal to cast as normal if the focus is dead.\nSoloing Lady Vashj.\nThis encounter can be soloed by a high-level and decently-well-geared player. Phase 1 (100%-70%) is straightforward: just open up and nuke her. She will go immune at any point after 70%, so push hard until she actually does so.\nIn Phase 2, when she runs to the center and gains her immunity shield, stay near the center to pick off the water elementals (they only have 4,000 HP!). Keep looking around the room for the tell-tale green missile appearing from down below, run in that direction and tap the Tainted Elemental to kill it. Loot the core, run to the nearest shield generator, and interact with it to disable it. Focus down the elites and the striders, as the Hamstring from the elite and the fear from the strider will get annoying very quickly. Don't forget to keep killing the streaming water elementals!\nPhase 3 starts once the last shield generator is disabled. She will likely be at 50 stacks or more by this point, which is a 500% increase in damage dealt. That kind of damage will make a dent on level 90 players! Finish off any remaining striders and elites, then pull out all the stops to blow her down."}

Many of its ghosts are here to help. In life, the Lady in White was a Gilnean noble woman, who saw the destruction of almost all that she loved during the fall of Gilneas. As a ghost, she seeks to help the living restore all that was lost. While the activity of restless spirits has increased sharply since the arrival of the curse in the Witchwood, most seem to be petty, malignant things, content to rage against the living. Not so with the Lady in White, who has become a symbol of hope and reassurance to the citizens of Gilneas in this dark time. She tends to appear only to those in deepest despair, and to each witness, she resembles a mother, sister, wife, or friend come to offer comfort from beyond the veil. Her dress is always white, though this detail differs as well; some insist that she was wearing her wedding dress, while others say it was a noblewoman's gown or that she was a poor girl in a plain white shift. Regardless, one consistent element among reports is that the Lady in White's expression is kind, yet achingly sad, and that she seems to be searching for something. Most will never witness the Lady in White, but those who have who have received her blessing have seen their spirits lifted in a most profound way."}

This can be caused by many things: a slow internet connection, ISP troubles, power outages, highly-populated servers, etc. When you encounter lag all forms of interaction with the game world, such as fighting, &lt;a href=\"looting\"&gt;looting&lt;/a&gt;, and talking to &lt;a href=\"NPCs\"&gt;NPCs&lt;/a&gt;, will occur erratically or not at all.\nLag typically dissipates after some time. After the lag goes away any damage caused or taken by your character will occur rapidly and other characters and mobs may appear to move very quickly. Because of this, severe lag often leads to a &lt;a href=\"wipe\"&gt;wipe&lt;/a&gt;.\nA more technical disussion is available at on Wikipedia. For a detailed explanation about lag in &lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt; see this &lt;a href=\"http%3A//eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/1710231176\"&gt;blue post&lt;/a&gt;."}

The blade darkened his mind and caused him to commit many horrid acts, but after a battle with Aegwynn the spell was broken and Laith abandoned the blade in an unknown location. However, through a twist of fate, the blade would later be picked up by his son, &lt;a href=\"Ariden\"&gt;Ariden&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Riders\"&gt;Dark Riders&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt; went rogue and severed her connections with the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Council of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt;, the council members created the &lt;a href=\"Tirisgarde\"&gt;Tirisgarde&lt;/a&gt; to hunt her down and capture her. Despite the Tirisgarde's use of powerful artifacts, Aegwynn outwitted her hunters at every turn, and so the Tirisgarde finally unearthed several closely guarded relics, one of which was the dreaded &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt; blade &lt;a href=\"Apocalypse\"&gt;Apocalypse&lt;/a&gt;. These dangerous weapons were then distributed to the order's most loyal and gifted members, and Apocalypse was entrusted to Laith Sha'ol. From the very moment Laith held the sword, a darkness bloomed in his mind and would continue to fester until it consumed him entirely.\nWhile Apocalypse granted Laith great power, hatred began to taint his thoughts, and his desire to see Aegwynn brought to justice became a desire to see her dead. After narrowly missing his prey in the small human village of &lt;a href=\"Corwell\"&gt;Corwell&lt;/a&gt;, he interrogated the inhabitants and accused them of conspiring with the renegade Guardian. Though the townsfolk knew nothing of Aegwynn's whereabouts, Apocalypse began to taint their minds and infect them with paranoia and suspicion. In a fit of rage, Laith cut down the town elder, which ignited a wave of violence throughout the village in which friends and family turned on each another with bare hands, teeth and anything else that could serve as a weapon. Only Laith walked out of Corwell alive.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Historian%20Archesonus\"&gt;Royal Historian Archesonus&lt;/a&gt;' \"&lt;a href=\"%3AOn%20Plagues%2C%20Curses%2C%20and%20Blights\"&gt;:On Plagues, Curses, and Blights&lt;/a&gt;\", there is an odd period of history where there was a noticeable increase of disease, famine, and violence. Some legends associate them with a nameless horseman who carried a sinister blade and in some tales rode a pale horse, in others a black mare with flaming eyes. Due to the famine, plagues, and death that followed in the horseman's wake, he was variously named as War, Death, Famine, and Pestilence. Archesonus, however, doubts these claims and believes the legend of the horseman to have simply been a way for the people of the time to cope with phenomena beyond their control.\nWhen Aegwynn learned of Laith Sha'ol and Apocalypse, she lured the Tirisgarde member into a trap, expecting to make short work of her adversary. However, she had underestimated Apocalypse's true strength, and Laith used the blade's vampiric power to drain the Guardian's lifeforce. None of Aegwynn's spells could shield her from the sword, but just as she was about to collapse she screamed a desperate incantation that shattered the connection between Laith and Apocalypse. In that moment, the darkness vanished from Laith's mind, and he remembered everything he had done while under the sword's influence. Overcome with horror, he dropped the sword where he stood and ran without ever looking back.\nLaith eventually settled in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; and started a family. He spent his days helping those in need as a way to atone for his past. His son &lt;a href=\"Ariden\"&gt;Ariden&lt;/a&gt;, however, did not live such an altruistic life and spent his life traveling the lands of Stormwind with a group of dubious merchants, selling fake elixirs and artifacts to swindle innocent people of their gold. When the merchants attempted to sell their wares to the Guardian &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;, he saw straight through their lies and cursed them to become his servants, forced to seek out lost artifacts and bring them to him: the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Riders\"&gt;Dark Riders&lt;/a&gt;. Ariden became the Dark Riders' leader, and due to his father's history with Apocalypse he felt unnaturally drawn to the blade, eventually rediscovering the blade in the &lt;a href=\"Badlands\"&gt;Badlands&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nYears later, an &lt;a href=\"Death%20knight%23Unholy\"&gt;unholy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt; traveled with &lt;a href=\"Revil%20Kost\"&gt;Revil Kost&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Deadwind%20Pass\"&gt;Deadwind Pass&lt;/a&gt; in search of Apocalypse. After finding mentions of \"wet soil\" and \"shallow graves\" in a journal at &lt;a href=\"Ariden%27s%20Camp\"&gt;Ariden's Camp&lt;/a&gt;, the death knight began raising the corpses buried in a small graveyard in the shadow of the tower of &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt;, eventually raising Laith Sha'ol himself. After defeating the Tirisgarde's reanimated corpse, Laith's spirit appeared and urged the death knight to delve into the &lt;a href=\"Karazhan%20Catacombs\"&gt;Karazhan Catacombs&lt;/a&gt; to retrieve the sword and lift the curse. In the deepest part of the catacomb, the death knight confronted and defeated Ariden, who now wielded Apocalypse. As the blade slipped from Ariden's grasp, Laith's spirit appeared and told him that Apocalypse's power had never been his and that the sword had wielded him as a weapon, rather than the other way around. Laith then told his son that the curse was now lifted and that he was finally free. As Ariden's lifeless body collapsed on the floor, Laith's spirit faded from view."}

Feel free to watch, but it is not advised that you get involved if at all possible. The battle can be skipped to proceed onto the final boss, but it may require a &lt;a href=\"Mind%20Soothe\"&gt;Mind Soothe&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"Sap\"&gt;Sap&lt;/a&gt; on the NPC closest to the door, as well as wall-hugging.\nStrategy.\nAn ideal group for this fight is 2 ranged DPS, 1 melee DPS, 1 healer, 1 tank. At least one player should be able to cleanse diseases.\nLaj periodically spawns two lasher adds and teleports to his original position on top of the platform, thus he should be tanked where he spawns. Assign one ranged DPS to kill each spawn and continue business as usual on Laj. The spawns can be of two different types: one uses a &lt;a href=\"Mind%20Flay\"&gt;Mind Flay&lt;/a&gt; type attack, another will rapidly throw thorns. All of their attacks deal relatively large amounts of damage. They are vulnerable to both banish and fear, and the spawns are also vulnerable to rogue stuns/incapacitates (Gouge/Cheap Shot/Kidney Shot).\nLaj puts the Allergic Reaction disease on the tank that should be cleansed immediately, because it increases the damage that the tank takes. Laj will also randomly change color. When he does this, he will be resistant to certain types of magic (just like the mobs on both sides of the Botanist). The following are the colors/resistances he can change to:\nHeroic changes.\nThere are no new abilities or strategies on &lt;a href=\"heroic%20mode\"&gt;heroic mode&lt;/a&gt;. The boss does more damage and execution is more important, but the strategy is essentially the same."}
