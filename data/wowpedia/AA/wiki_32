Nefarian was obsessed with following in his father's footsteps by achieving what &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; could not, and has been experimenting with the blood of all of the various dragonflights to create a chromatic dragonflight. These experiments were largely considered failures; many &lt;a href=\"chromatic%20whelp\"&gt;whelp&lt;/a&gt;s died before hatching, and those that survived were unstable, short-lived, volatile, and/or deformed. Those that reached adulthood were artificially aged by Nefarian's twisted magics.\nHistory.\nThe history of the chromatic dragonflight began ages ago with &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, though no specimens were produced until recently, when Deathwing's son, &lt;a href=\"Nefarian\"&gt;Nefarian&lt;/a&gt;, achieved success with his magical experiments in his &lt;a href=\"Blackwing%20Lair\"&gt;lair&lt;/a&gt; at the top of &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt;. Nefarian captured whelps from the other four flights, and magically combined their traits to form the first chromatic &lt;a href=\"dragon%20whelp\"&gt;dragon whelp&lt;/a&gt;s, with the intent to bolster his forces against &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; the Firelord for control over the mountain. His experiments were horrific, brutal, and eventually effective. For years, the spawn of this new chromatic dragonflight\u2014consisting of blood from all five flights\u2014had died before hatching. Eventually, a few began to survive. Then a few more. Nefarian believed he was on the verge of ensuring their survival, and he eagerly set his minions to preparing a clutch that would hatch an entire generation of this flight. The potential within them was greater than anything he could have hoped for, but for the moment, they were still vulnerable. Only a few had reached maturity and could defend themselves. While at least &lt;a href=\"Gyth\"&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; proved hardy enough to survive being magically aged to adulthood, &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; soon breached his inner sanctum with the aid of the &lt;a href=\"red%20dragon\"&gt;red dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Vaelastrasz\"&gt;Vaelastrasz&lt;/a&gt;, killed Nefarian, and destroyed the chromatic dragonflight.\nCataclysm.\nAfter being reanimated by the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, Nefarian returned to his own experiments and forged a new generation of chromatic dragons. A few chromatic &lt;a href=\"drakeadon\"&gt;drakeadon&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Chromatic%20Prototype\"&gt;Chromatic Prototype&lt;/a&gt;s could be found within &lt;a href=\"Blackwing%20Descent\"&gt;Blackwing Descent&lt;/a&gt;. After their triumph against &lt;a href=\"Ultraxion\"&gt;Ultraxion&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt;, adventurers came into possession of the chromatic drake &lt;a href=\"Experiment%2012-B\"&gt;Experiment 12-B&lt;/a&gt;.\nThrall: Twilight of the Aspects.\nThe chromatic dragonflight played a key part in Deathwing's plot to destroy the other &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspect\"&gt;Dragon Aspect&lt;/a&gt;s. Under the direction of the mysterious &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Father\"&gt;Twilight Father&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; cultists infiltrated the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20Aspects\"&gt;Chamber of Aspects&lt;/a&gt; and replaced all of the eggs at &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt; with chromatic eggs; these eggs were destroyed when &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Korialstrasz&lt;/a&gt; discovered the cultists, and sacrificed himself to ensure their destruction. In addition, a massive chromatic dragon named &lt;a href=\"Chromatus\"&gt;Chromatus&lt;/a&gt; was created. Chromatus had five heads, one representing each of the dragonflight, and was animated by the Twilight Father using the energies of the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Eye of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; and the blood of &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt;'s son, &lt;a href=\"Arygos\"&gt;Arygos&lt;/a&gt;. Chromatus was eventually defeated by the combined might of all the Dragon Aspects with the assistance of &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, but his body proved indestructible by any known means and was locked in an arcane prison by &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, a single chromatic drake, &lt;a href=\"Chromitus\"&gt;Chromitus&lt;/a&gt;, was seen aiding the unexpectedly renewed &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Island%20Expedition\"&gt;Island Expedition&lt;/a&gt;s in gathering &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs a mount.\n&lt;a href=\"Experiment%2012-B\"&gt;Experiment 12-B&lt;/a&gt; has a very low chance to drop from in &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Normal%20mode\"&gt;Normal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Heroic%20mode\"&gt;Heroic&lt;/a&gt; difficulty.\nIn the RPG.\nThe breeding program began with &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; in ages past to replenish his own destroyed dragonflight. While Deathwing aimed to create chromatic dragons years ago (this desire constituted much of his motivation for attacking &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;), he was never able to capture enough eggs to succeed.\nNefarian currently breeds with the assistance of &lt;a href=\"Rend%20Blackhand\"&gt;Rend Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; and the rest of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Horde\"&gt;Dark Horde&lt;/a&gt;, who hope to use the dragons to overthrow &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and make the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; back into the conquering, bloodthirsty force it once was."}

{"id": "323592", "revid": "50971362", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=323592", "title": "Chromatus", "text": "Chromatus is the first and only successfully formed &lt;a href=\"chromatic%20dragon\"&gt;chromatic dragon&lt;/a&gt;. Chromatus' five heads grant him the power of all five &lt;a href=\"dragonflight\"&gt;dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;s. Though the five-headed dragon appeared dead because &lt;a href=\"Nefarian\"&gt;Nefarian&lt;/a&gt; never managed to give it the spark of life, the &lt;a href=\"Archbishop%20Benedictus\"&gt;Twilight Father&lt;/a&gt; managed to breathe life into the creature through the use of a &lt;a href=\"surge%20needle\"&gt;surge needle&lt;/a&gt;. It was later defeated by the united powers of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt; and once more rendered inanimate (neither dead, nor undead, nor alive), and its indestructible body was stored in an arcane prison.\nBackground.\nThe monstrosity was created by &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;'s son, &lt;a href=\"Nefarian\"&gt;Nefarian&lt;/a&gt;. Nefarian had tried to create a new dragonflight that would combine the powers of all five of the other flights. The experiments were considered failures as many whelps had died before hatching or were deformed in many ways. Chromatus was Nefarian's final experiment. Chromatus exemplified the pinnacle of all Nefarian had learned through his various experiments, but Nefarian was slain before he could give Chromatus the spark of life. Years later the Twilights Cultists brought the body of Chromatus all the way to &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, knowing that they needed vast stores of arcane energy to give him the spark of life.\nTo revive Chromatus the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Father\"&gt;Twilight Father&lt;/a&gt; made a pact with the blue dragon &lt;a href=\"Arygos\"&gt;Arygos&lt;/a&gt;. After being betrayed and killed, Arygos' blood was used to siphon the magic from Azeroth into the &lt;a href=\"Nexus\"&gt;Nexus&lt;/a&gt; and from the Nexus into Chromatus. Slowly, the monstrous creature began to move, each head slowly coming alive. Shortly after being animated Chromatus joined the battle against &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; and the blue dragonflight. With the immense power of Chromatus the blue dragons had to retreat. At &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt;, Chromatus became interested in the captive &lt;a href=\"Kirygosa\"&gt;Kirygosa&lt;/a&gt; and wished to mate with her so she could bear his eggs to make the first generation of stable chromatic whelps. However Kirygosa managed to escape just in time. As Kirygosa explained the situation with Chromatus to &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; and Kalecgos, Ysera realized that her vision of the &lt;a href=\"Hour%20of%20Twilight\"&gt;Hour of Twilight&lt;/a&gt; might be a result of Chromatus slaughtering the Aspects. So all three Aspects decided that Chromatus had to die before he would grow too powerful and attacked him.\nAfter learning about Ysera's vision, the Aspects decided to attack a different colored head than their Dragonflight. Ysera focused on the bronze head. Now fully Awakened, Ysera appeared to be a force to be reckoned with, her flight pattern incredibly unpredictable, and staying two steps ahead of the bronze head of Chromatus. Alexstrasza fought the most intelligent head, the blue one, and Kalecgos began fighting the red head. Suddenly, the black and green heads focused on attacking Ysera along with the bronze one. One of Ysera's forelegs was caught in a Shadowflame Attack, while the bronze head spat sand that scorched her skin, and the black head bit her wing, taking a chunk of it. Ysera pulls back to heal herself, and then all of the heads begin focusing on the green Dragon Aspect. Finally, the bronze dragons, with &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt; at their front, joined the battle. However, the first thing the Timeless One did was to urge them all to retreat, stating that if they had persisted, they all would have died. While Thrall is not a Dragon Aspect, he works as a shaman with the Earth, and offered to give his spirit of Earth in the battle with Chromatus, so that all five Spirits of the Aspects were whole once more. As he prepared a ritual to bind their spirits, the Twilight Dragonflight attacks. The four Aspects renewed their attack upon Chromatus, but this time with a much more unified power. Chromatus faltered for a moment, all of its heads reared back to attack, exposing its chest. It was in this moment that all four Aspects unleashed a pure white hue which brought Chromatus to fall. \nChromatus had been defeated. He was once again no longer alive, nor dead, or undead, either. He was in an \"in-between\" state, lacking the spark of life, with no heartbeat, but he could possibly be reanimated. His body was indestructible, and concerned that some other dark power might try to revive Chromatus after its defeat, the dragons attempted in vain to destroy the corpse. Some powerful spell, probably woven into the dark marriage of magic and technology that had animated him in the first place protected the body from all their efforts to obliterate it. The Aspects decided to create an arcane prison similar to the ones &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt; created during the &lt;a href=\"Nexus%20War\"&gt;Nexus War&lt;/a&gt;, but bigger and stronger, to hold his body, and that representatives from all the dragonflights would watch over the inanimate body of Chromatus.\nDescription.\nChromatus' body is enormous, far larger than even a Dragon Aspect's. It looks misshapen with its color of an ugly purple bruise on pale skin. In some places, bones are visible. Scales had fallen off, showing skin that was healthy and skin that was decayed. Each of the heads was a different color and seems to have something amiss with it: a missing ear or an oozing eye. In Thrall's eyes, Chromatus was not just a dragon, but such a dragon as might have been conjured by a &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;'s worst nightmare.\nEach head of Chromatus has a brain that knows all the skills of its flight, and is able to attack as separate entities or act in eerie unison, with such furor that the entire &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; had become rattled and panicky. Sometimes his wings would not bear him, yet the blue flight was unable to stand against him and the &lt;a href=\"twilight%20dragonflight\"&gt;twilight dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;. His green head fixed Ysera with an intense stare, attempting to send the green Dragon Aspect one of her own nightmares. The bronze head can breath out sand. Instead of five separate hues from five separate heads, the flames the creature can spew are dark violet and far more powerful. \nSpeculation.\nIt is possible that Chromatus was originally planned to be a boss in &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt; but was replaced by &lt;a href=\"Ultraxion\"&gt;Ultraxion&lt;/a&gt; for some reason, perhaps because animating a multi-headed dragon proved to be too difficult for the developers. Chromatus simply disappears from the story after the events of \"Twilight of the Aspects\", despite the book's ending hinting that he would return in the near future, and Ultraxion drops a &lt;a href=\"Experiment%2012-B\"&gt;chromatic drake mount&lt;/a&gt;. This could also explain why the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; are present in the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Eternity%20%28Dragon%20Soul%29\"&gt;Eye of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; in Dragon Soul, as Chromatus was imprisoned in an &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Prison\"&gt;Arcane Prison&lt;/a&gt;, technology of the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;."}

The main culprit of this remained unknown. However, it appears to be more than one as four attacks struck down her from four different locations at the same time.\nThe first assassin was &lt;a href=\"Thalas%20Vylethorn\"&gt;Thalas Vylethorn&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"satyr\"&gt;satyr&lt;/a&gt; who had infiltrated the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dragonshrine\"&gt;Emerald Dragonshrine&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s in the area couldn't sleep and had become restless. Thalas sent &lt;a href=\"Dream%20Tormentor\"&gt;Dream Tormentor&lt;/a&gt;s to disturb them from the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;. With this distraction, Thalas was able to cast a spell at Wyrmrest Temple to kill Chromie.\nThe second assassin was a &lt;a href=\"Void%20Gargantuan\"&gt;Void Gargantuan&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"void%20god\"&gt;void god&lt;/a&gt; who had infiltrated the &lt;a href=\"Azure%20Dragonshrine\"&gt;Azure Dragonshrine&lt;/a&gt;. He interfered with the &lt;a href=\"ley%20line\"&gt;ley line&lt;/a&gt;s and started to absorb their &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;al properties. With this power, the Void Gargantuan was able to cast a spell.\nThe third assassin was &lt;a href=\"Talar%20Icechill\"&gt;Talar Icechill&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"lich\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt; who had infiltrated the &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Dragonshrine\"&gt;Ruby Dragonshrine&lt;/a&gt;. He led an army of undead towards the protectors of the Dragonshrine and hid inside the tree during the commotion. With this distraction, Talar was able to cast a spell.\nThe fourth assassin was &lt;a href=\"Zorathides\"&gt;Zorathides&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt; who had infiltrated the &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Dragonshrine\"&gt;Obsidian Dragonshrine&lt;/a&gt;. He reignited the activity at the abandoned sanctum by raising the undead. With this distraction, Zorathides was able to cast a spell at Wyrmrest Temple to kill Chromie.\nAlong with an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;, a past version of Chromie was able to prevent her future death from all four.\nPast.\nIn past events where Chromie would appear, they also became compromised. This alteration of history forced present Chromie to die instantly.\nThe first anomaly came from the &lt;a href=\"Culling%20of%20Stratholme%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Culling of Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;. In the original timeline, Chromie was there to ensure that &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Arthas\"&gt;Prince Arthas&lt;/a&gt; would find the plagued grain from the infinite's disguise. While that quest appeared to be fulfilled, &lt;a href=\"Nezar%27Azret\"&gt;Nezar'Azret&lt;/a&gt; kidnapped past Chromie. &lt;a href=\"Tick%20%28drake%29\"&gt;Tick&lt;/a&gt; saw what was happening and followed them to the entrance of &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt; where he awaited for help, but it never came though. Nezar'Azret took past Chromie to the &lt;a href=\"Crusaders%27%20Square\"&gt;Crusaders' Square&lt;/a&gt; where she suffocated inside a cocoon.\nThe second anomaly originated from &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;. During a daily job for &lt;a href=\"Sethria%27s%20Roost\"&gt;Sethria's Roost&lt;/a&gt;, an adventurer was able to call upon a random character to assist on their quest. Of those characters, one was Chromie. Together, they would engage with the strongest fire elementals there ever existed. Unfortunately, one of those runs did not go smoothly (purposefully or not) and Chromie fell to the ground on the brink of death. With no one to hear her cries, a fire elemental led by a &lt;a href=\"Fiery%20Behemoth\"&gt;Fiery Behemoth&lt;/a&gt; attacked the dying dragon and sniffed out the last shambles of life inside of her.\nThe third anomaly appeared in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Andorhal\"&gt;Battle for Andorhal&lt;/a&gt;. In the original timeline, Chromie was in Andorhal during the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; occupation. There she investigated the &lt;a href=\"Temporal%20Parasite\"&gt;Temporal Parasite&lt;/a&gt;s and helped adventurers in redeeming the ghost of &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Redpath\"&gt;Captain Redpath&lt;/a&gt; during a ghostly locked in the past &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Darrowshire\"&gt;Battle of Darrowshire&lt;/a&gt;. When the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; started their campaign to retake Andorhal, Chromie escaped to Wyrmrest Temple. Or so was it thought. Unlike the original timeline, both the Alliance and Horde started a witch hunt on her and she retreated to the town hall. Both forces bombarded the building until there was nothing left but rubble. Chromie died during her last stand.\nThe fourth anomaly came from the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;. In the original timeline, Chromie arrived to ensure the acquisition of the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Demon Soul&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, &lt;a href=\"Grolethax\"&gt;Grolethax&lt;/a&gt; arrived and engulfed Chromie with fel energy. Knowing that there was nothing she could do, Grolethax went to the bronze time portals and guarded them until the last minute, making sure the dragon died before being able to escape. The dying dragon fell to the ground in her whelp form and was slowly consumed by the fel.\nAlong with an adventurer, a future version of Chromie was able to prevent her past deaths from all four anomalies."}

It is an episodic &lt;a href=\"Machinima\"&gt;Machinima&lt;/a&gt; that follows a few different Alliance characters in their attempt to complete a long-winded quest. \nPlot.\nChronicle of the Annoying Quest follows Guy, Ellers, Flayme, Kit, Hana, Deuce and Rora on their quest through Azeroth. In each episode, the characters get into mishaps, scrapes and issues that continue to deny them the prize of finishing the quest. As the episodes continued the cast met the villains of the season and began to take on a side plot, fighting off the villains. \nMain Characters (Protagonists).\nVoliostromort Guy.\nVoliostromort Guy (aka. \"Guy\", because he hates his first name) is a Human Warlock. He is voiced by Kam Uraki, the writer/director of the series. Guy is best friends with Ellers, and they often are found arguing a geeky topic. Still, the two are very close friends and neither of them would leave the other behind (Ep. 16).\nThough the quest was originally intended to be for Ellers, Guy was told he must go as well or he'd be \"Thrown in the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Stockade\"&gt;Stockade&lt;/a&gt; for collaborating with demons\". He was also the one to convince Hana to transform into a cat. His luck with keeping his body as is has also been on the downside since his soul was ejected from his body by drinking one of Deuce's experimental invisibility potions (Ep. 5). Since then guy has been not only a ghost, but also trapped in a &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Shard\"&gt;soul shard&lt;/a&gt;, undead, a series of different things both seen and unseen (Ep. 28) and also a Blood-Elf. Guy has a fear of flying brought on by being struck in the head with a Griffin dropping. He also has trouble with women, though his lucked changed as a Blood-Elf when Stephie takes notice.\nJohn Jacob Ellers.\nEllers is a Human Paladin, and a new member to the Holy Order of the Light. This did not come without a fight as it took him four times to get accepted. Ellers chose to join the order in an attempt to \"get chicks\" from a paladin-only bar known as \"The Pious Patron\". This is all unfortunate for Ellers however as the order is one of celibacy. A long running joke of the series revolves around this and it is punchlined by the fact that he does not know what celibate means. Ellers was charged by \"Higher ranking Paladins\" to 'Find a black dragon of at least 2000 years of age... amd to bring it's head back as proof'. Ellers is voice by David Christopher.\nHana.\nHana is a male Night Elf Druid. He is currently dating Kit. Hana was on a quest with Kit to retreive parts of a black dragon when they overheard Guy and Ellers discussing their need to find one. They then joined forces and made their quest one. Hana (unlike most druids) has a problem with shape shifting and has gotten stuck in cat form for a portion of the series. This was fixed in Moonglade and Hana was given a Ring of Shape Shifting. He is likely the most serious of the Alliance Characters. Hana is voiced by Adam Brannon.\nKit.\nKit is a Human Warrior. She is dating Hana and has a distaste for Hana's ex, Flayme. She and Hana joined Guy and Ellers in there quest to get the parts of a black dragon that are needed to create a powerful aphrodisiac for Hana. She attributes this to the fact that his race is no longer immortal. Kit also underwent an appearance change in Ep. 23 when she changed armor and began wielding the &lt;a href=\"Arcanite%20Reaper\"&gt;Arcanite Reaper&lt;/a&gt;. She and Flayme have also set aside their differences and are seemingly becoming friends. Kit is voiced by April Ardis.\nFlayme.\nIs a Female Night Elf Priest. She is also a Priestess of Elune. She is Hana's Ex and her introduction completes a love triangle within the series. She still has feelings for Hana, and will often point things out to him that would make him want to come back to her. Flayme's voice has changed a few times. She was first voiced by Fae Cahill, but is now voiced by Sarah Brinks.\nDeuce Ex Machina.\nIs a Male Gnome Mage. He is an alchemist and also a powerful spell caster. Deuce is very touchy about is height and once leveled an entire village of Horde for pointing it out. It was later revealed that he forced them to write \"I will not call others short.\" with their own entrails. Like most gnomes, not all of Deuce's ingenious plans work as intended. Deuce is voiced by Ian Boyle.\nRora.\nIs a Female Draenei Hunter. She saved the group from certain death toward the end of season one. It is unclear as to why she was inclined to help them, but has quickly earned the trust of the group. It has since been revealed that Rora is Dirim's spy(ep 32). Dirim referred to Rora getting her revenge, although what this entails has yet to be revealed. Tho Rora is a hunter, her pet Rebel is rarely mentioned or seen. Tho he does exist. We also meet her Aunt and Uncle in a later episode. Rora is voiced by Deuce's real life older sister, Rora Boyle.\nJames.\nIs an overly optimistic Male trapped in a sword. His kind heart was taken advantage of by his brother, Eric. He touched an enchanted sword and he and his brother became trapped within. In a mix up at the end of season one, Dirim and his crew grabbed James by mistake, and are now stuck with him. Dirim, in an effort to make James look more evil, changed his appearance shortly after getting him. James is also part iPhone. James is voiced by Shane Corey.\nEric.\nIs a pessimistic Male trapped in a sword. He tricked his brother James into helping him and they both got trapped. He, like his brother, is also part iPhone. Eric was voiced by a few people, but is being done on a more regular basis by Ian Boyle, the voice of Deuce.\nMain Characters (Antagonists).\nDirim (Dirimsinaltharian).\nIs an Undead Warlock, but was formerly a Mage. He is bent on world domination and is on a quest he started with Eric to retrieve the Artifacts of Domination consisting of three pieces with which he intends to enslave the world. He commissioned a few lackeys that all seem to have their own agendas. His true identity was hinted at in Ep. 24 when he speaks with his Sister about the Staff of Domination. In Ep. 31 it was revealed that Dirim is a black dragon Dirimsinaltharian,the son of &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; and with &lt;a href=\"Nefarian\"&gt;Nefarian&lt;/a&gt;'s demise his eldest child. Dirim is voice by Kam Uraki, the voice of Guy and the writer/director of the show.\nStephie Ilumvari.\nIs a Female Blood-Elf Mage. She is a typical valley girl and is very concerned with typical girly things. She is also enamored by Magic and finds her self very attracted to men who can use it. She's also rather obsessed on shopping, trying to find an excuse to go to a mall at any given time. In episode 22 she was planning a route to take to Orgrimmar with Dirim, but her suggestions were ultimately overruled by him, as he didn't want to waste the time on \"having her beg them to go to a mall every two seconds\". She is voiced by &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.candaceholly.com\"&gt;Candace Holly&lt;/a&gt;.\nOrgrath Axeblade.\nIs a Male Orc Warrior. He is very strongly rooted in his heritage and will be the first to say so. He is also the most easily irritated of the group, and in words of Stephie, \"totallly hates humans\". He and Hawkwynd have become friends on this journey and are doing much of their work together. Orgrath is voiced by Dan Herdegen.\nHawkwynd Bighooves.\nIs a Male Tauren Shaman. He is another strong-arm of the group. He and Orgrath intend to seize the Artifacts of Domination for themselves when they reach the &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt;. He is also often sarcastic. Hawkwynd is voiced by Cezar Guzman, who also has provided voices for &lt;a href=\"The%20Grind\"&gt;The Grind&lt;/a&gt; (Mr. Teeth) and other WoW Machinima.\nJin'zul.\nIs a Male Troll Rogue. He's the scout of the group and uses his stealth ability to its full potential. He is working the closest with Dirim as seen in Ep. 29 where he seems to know that Dirim doesn't intend to keep Orgrath, Hawkwynd, or Stephie around. Jin'zul is voiced by Shane Corey, also the voice of James.\nMinor Characters.\nGruff.\nIs a Male Dwarf, presumably a Rogue as his role in the series is to pop out of nowhere and offer advice or help to the protagonists.\nVlada Draenovich.\nIs a Female Draenei Priest and is Rora's Aunt. She is the product of a defunct podcast audio show called 'From Draenor With Love'. It is unclear what the future holds for Vlada and her irritating husband. She is also voiced by Candace Holly, the voice of Stephie.\nGoliath Rasputin Draenovich.\nIs a Male Draenei Paladin and Rora's Uncle. He is very air-headed and is often distracted by either women or other assorted things that he should not be. He is also from the show, 'From Draenor With Love'. According to his wife and niece, he crashed the Exodar. He is voiced by Rob Shepard, Mac Harbor Guy from &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.thegeekmedia.com\"&gt;The Geek Media.&lt;/a&gt;\nDirim's Sister.\nThere is very little know about this character or the nature of the scene she appears in. She is related to Dirim and is the Daughter of Dirim's father , who according to Ep. 24, will hear of her assistance to Dirim. She revealed more about Dirim.

The &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;ish &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s violent invasion of the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; stands as one of history's most tumultuous periods. Through the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s demonic machinations, the once-noble orcs were transformed into a nearly unstoppable foe and let loose upon Azeroth's unsuspecting denizens. Yet even in the face of the Horde's unparalleled fury, brave heroes risked everything to rise up in defense of the . . .\nWORLD OF WARCRAFT\nRise of the Horde.\nBefore the savage &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s began their rampage across &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, they were a proud shamanic race native to the world of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;. The cunning demon &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; saw lethal potential in the clan-based orcs, and thus he set about molding them into the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;\u2014a single, brutal force driven by an all-consuming thirst for destruction. But the foul &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic magic that granted the Horde its immense strength began consuming the orcs from within, ultimately threatening to destroy everything that they once were.\nThe Last Guardian.\nLong ago a group of magi known as the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Council of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt; was formed to fight a secret war against the sinister demons of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. To this end, the council imbued a single champion with enormous power to act as the world's guardian. &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt; was one such &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardian of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt;, and he was expected to be the greatest who had ever lived. Yet he was destined to follow a much darker path. From birth a mysterious evil had tainted the core of his being, and his subsequent struggle against the darkness within himself would precipitate the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;ish &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s invasion of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; . . . and change the world forever.\nTides of Darkness.\nDuring the First War, the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;ish &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; laid waste to the once-great human kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;. From the ashes of this terrible defeat, however, hope emerged. &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt;, Champion of Stormwind, rallied the survivors of his ruined homeland and valiantly led them to &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; in the hopes of uniting the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; nations into a mighty &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; that could stand against the Horde and its ruthless new leader, &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt;. Yet as formidable as Lothar believed the Alliance would be, many humans feared that no force would ever be capable of stopping the Horde's merciless onslaught.\nBeyond the Dark Portal.\nIn the aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s, the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, a gateway connecting &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, was destroyed. The orcs, however, did not abandon their lust for war. Led by the mysterious orc shaman &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;, a fresh wave of &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; fighters flooded into Azeroth. Even more unsettling was that small bands of orcs intent on something other than mere conquest began scouring Azeroth for powerful artifacts desired by their sinister leader. To counter the Horde's dark schemes, only one option remained for the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;: a suicide mission into the orcs' ruined homeworld of Draenor."}

One of the few exceptions is Chrono Lord Deja, who gained influence within the flight through his raw power and cunning.\"\nStrategy.\nThis is a simple fight. This boss only has 1 major ability to watch out for, an arcane blast attack that hits your group for 1000-2000 arcane damage. During the whole fight spawns will still keep coming out, what you can do is summon your dragon in between the boss portal and Medivh, he can easily take care of the whelps and allows you to focus on the boss, although if you summon your time keeper too close to the boss, the boss will immediately despawn it. However if you can have a rogue or anyone appropriate take care of the spawns on their own while everyone takes out the boss. You can even have your group redirect their DPS to the spawn for a minute, whatever works best for you really. Nothing too special about this boss.\nBefore patch 2.1 a Warrior could Spell Reflect his Time Lapse ability back onto Chrono Lord Deja but this has since been changed."}

The item allows players to \"save\" their active world buffs and re-apply them at another time of their choosing. However, the player cannot be affected by any world buff that they currently have saved.\nThough not a part of the &lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;original game&lt;/a&gt;, this consumable was introduced to allow players to continue playing their characters even after acquiring world buffs for raiding, rather than logging out of them to preserve their world buffs often for days at a time. The consumable offers additional perks, including avoiding a loss of world buffs early outside of the raid (either to unintended deaths in the world or &lt;a href=\"dispel\"&gt;dispel&lt;/a&gt;s from enemy players), and lets players save their buffs for more difficult bosses rather than having them decay on trash mobs or disappear on learning attempts.\nSource.\nChronoboon Displacer is sold for by &lt;a href=\"Chromie\"&gt;Chromie&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Western%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Western Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;. In order to purchase from Chromie, the player must have completed the quests &lt;a href=\"A%20Matter%20of%20Time\"&gt;A Matter of Time&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Counting%20Out%20Time%20%281%29\"&gt;Counting Out Time (1)&lt;/a&gt;.\nFunctionality.\nWhen a player uses a Chronoboon Displacer it immediately consumes all of their active &lt;a href=\"world%20buff\"&gt;world buff&lt;/a&gt;s, storing them in the transformed &lt;a href=\"Supercharged%20Chronoboon%20Displacer\"&gt;Supercharged Chronoboon Displacer&lt;/a&gt;. The player can then use the Supercharged item, consuming it to re-apply these stored buffs at any desired time. These buffs will be re-applied at the same duration they were stored at (if &lt;a href=\"Warchief%27s%20Blessing\"&gt;Warchief's Blessing&lt;/a&gt; had 45 minutes remaining when stored, it will have 45 minutes remaining when the player uses the Supercharged displacer).\nThe Superchaged Chronoboon Displacer is unique and bound to the player. A buff will display on the character while they possess a Superchaged displacer, showing a list of buffs being \"preserved\" and their duration, and informing the player that they cannot be affected by those world buffs that are currently held within that displacer. This prevents the item from being used as a \"back-up\" buff set, as world buffs are meant to disappear upon dying, giving them a high risk to match their substantial power.\nUnaffected buffs.\nThe following buffs cannot be stored with the Chronoboon Displacer:"}

It was humble by night elf standards but with an exceedingly fresh appearance. In the hippogryph breeding area, hippogryph eggs were meticulously cared for and the young were raised. The kaldorei living in the village worked to support their capital above, but they also hosted all kinds of celebrations, like the Midsummer.\nHistory.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nRut'theran Village originally had just one dock connected to &lt;a href=\"Auberdine\"&gt;Auberdine&lt;/a&gt; via \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Moonspray\"&gt;The Moonspray&lt;/a&gt;\" boat.\nCataclysm.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, several parts of the village were destroyed, five residents lost their lives, and the &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt; town of Auberdine was destroyed as well. Some of the services in Rut'theran were relocated to other parts of the now shattered island, and docks were added for the destinations previously reachable from Auberdine.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Thorns\"&gt;War of the Thorns&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Delaryn%20Summermoon\"&gt;Delaryn Summermoon&lt;/a&gt; arrived here to meet the night elven forces.\nRut'theran Village was then struck first by the siege weapons, its crowded docks engulfed in flames. Kaldorei civilians that did not die immediately would only drown in the surrounding waters. The village, along with the rest of Teldrassil, would be utterly destroyed within the hour of its burning.\nTravel connections.\nBoat.\nThe boat on the eastern dock is permanently berthed and doesn't go anywhere. In the \"Cataclysm\" beta, this was where &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; characters disembarked after leaving &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28starting%20zone%29\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; for the main world, but at some point it was changed to the western dock.\nIn the RPG.\nRut'theran's harbor lines the roots of the grand tree, and this humble but friendly village provides just a taste of the majestic locations held in &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;'s mighty branches. &lt;a href=\"Boat\"&gt;Boat&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"hippogryph\"&gt;hippogryph&lt;/a&gt;s carry passengers between Rut'theran and &lt;a href=\"Auberdine\"&gt;Auberdine&lt;/a&gt;. This is one of the primary breeding grounds of the hippogryphs, and eggs from all across &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; arrive here for care. Inside Rut'theran is a shimmering &lt;a href=\"portal\"&gt;portal&lt;/a&gt; that leads to Darnassus, far above."}

Rares and treasures are on the standard daily lockout.\nIn addition to the fixed reputation gains from quests, players need to gain additional reputation from turning in &lt;a href=\"Cataloged%20Research\"&gt;Cataloged Research&lt;/a&gt;-containing items:\nAt Tier 1, invest the 35 Cataloged Research into the &lt;a href=\"Trained%20Gromit%20Carrier\"&gt;Trained Gromit Carrier&lt;/a&gt; and make sure the summoned Swagsnout Gromit is out, as it will help find lootables that are not marked on the minimap. Despite what the item's tooltip implies, the gromit carrier is permanent and reusable.\nAt Tier 2, players must purchase one of each of the four keys \u2014 &lt;a href=\"Korthite%20Crystal%20Key\"&gt;Korthite Crystal Key&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Key%20of%20Flowing%20Waters\"&gt;Key of Flowing Waters&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Key%20of%20the%20Inner%20Chambers\"&gt;Key of the Inner Chambers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Key%20of%20Many%20Thoughts\"&gt;Key of Many Thoughts&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 as the four &lt;a href=\"Korthian%20Relic%20Box\"&gt;Korthian Relic Box&lt;/a&gt;es are each only lootable one time and require different keys. Players should also purchase for 100 &lt;a href=\"Cataloged%20Research\"&gt;Cataloged Research&lt;/a&gt;, which reveals hidden &lt;a href=\"Relic%20Gatherer\"&gt;Relic Gatherer&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Relic%20Gorger\"&gt;Relic Gorger&lt;/a&gt;s hidden throughout Korthia. Additionally, the all-seeing crystal also identifies randomly-spawned normal creatures that are also carrying Relic Fragments. This investment will pay for itself in a few days.\nAt Tier 3, the consumable &lt;a href=\"Teleporter%20Repair%20Kit\"&gt;Teleporter Repair Kit&lt;/a&gt; becomes available for 50 Research each, unlocking two rare-elites inside the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Teleporter\"&gt;Ancient Teleporter&lt;/a&gt;s : &lt;a href=\"Xyraxz%20the%20Unknowable\"&gt;Xyraxz the Unknowable&lt;/a&gt; inside the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20Wisdom%20%28Korthia%29\"&gt;Chamber of Wisdom&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Yarxhov%20the%20Pillager\"&gt;Yarxhov the Pillager&lt;/a&gt; inside the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20Knowledge\"&gt;Chamber of Knowledge&lt;/a&gt;. The rares usually do not drop enough relic fragments to recover the investment, so try to avoid purchasing the repair kits if possible.\nAt Tier 4, the consumable &lt;a href=\"Repaired%20Riftkey\"&gt;Repaired Riftkey&lt;/a&gt; grants access to &lt;a href=\"Rift%20%28Shadowlands%29\"&gt;The Rift&lt;/a&gt; for 15 minutes per use via &lt;a href=\"Rift%20Portal\"&gt;Rift Portal&lt;/a&gt;s. There are four &lt;a href=\"Riftbound%20Cache\"&gt;Riftbound Cache&lt;/a&gt;s hidden in the Rift each day, which contain enough Relic Fragments to make up for the purchase price. The riftkeys also allow players to access the Rift-only rare (&lt;a href=\"Observer%20Yorik\"&gt;Observer Yorik&lt;/a&gt;) and pull the Rift-hidden rares (like the &lt;a href=\"Screaming%20Shade\"&gt;Screaming Shade&lt;/a&gt;) back into the normal phase and kill them as well. Additionally, the riftkey grants access to the Maw Rift and it's three rares.\nAt Tier 5, players must purchase the required for 1,000 Cataloged Research to access the final three relics at &lt;a href=\"Phasing%20Korthian%20Shrine\"&gt;Phasing Korthian Shrine&lt;/a&gt;s. Other than that, there's no required expenses.\nGallery of relics.\nFind all twenty relics to earn the achievement &lt;a href=\"Reliquary%20Restoration\"&gt;Reliquary Restoration&lt;/a&gt;."}

Though gruff and slightly aloof, these experienced &lt;a href=\"wizard\"&gt;wizard&lt;/a&gt;s are a heartening sight upon any battlefield where the fate of humanity lies in peril.\nIn Warcraft III.\nIn \"Warcraft III\", the Archmages were introduced as &lt;a href=\"Hero%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;hero units&lt;/a&gt;, a special unit-type of the Human faction.\nThey had the following spells: Blizzard, Summon Water Elemental, Brilliance Aura, and Mass Teleport.\nThe campaign includes a number of unique archmagi.\nIn the RPG.\nArchmages can come from any arcane caster class as long as they have a sufficient level of arcana and spellcraft knowledge. They must have the ability to cast arcane spells and spells from at least five of the schools of magic at a certain level of proficiency. They must also spell focus in two schools of magic. Archmages of the Kirin Tor forbid warlocks and necromancers from their ranks.\nArchmage is a class mentioned in the Dungeons and Dragons: Warcraft: The Roleplaying Game which exists in the world of Warcraft. Though incorporated into the Warcraft RPG it is detailed only in the DMG (Dungeon Master's Guide). Characters with this class appear in \"&lt;a href=\"Lands%20of%20Conflict\"&gt;Lands of Conflict&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Shadows%20%26amp%3B%20Light\"&gt;Shadows &amp; Light&lt;/a&gt;\".\nArchmage of Kirin Tor.\nIn \"World of Warcraft: The Role Playing Game\", the generic archmage class was replaced with the Archmage of Kirin Tor prestige class, which included a Warcraft lore description. Note that the term \"Archmage of the Kirin Tor\" can and has been properly shortened to simply \"archmage\" in lore text. The term archmage can also be used to describe archmagi that are not members of the Kirin Tor.\nTypical Archmage.\nArchmagi keep the enemy on their toes, making them realize that there are more things to fear than simply the swords in their faces. Always attacking from afar, archmagi back up the combatants and either protect them or attack the enemies. Extremely powerful, they are also vulnerable, and warriors must protect them in case the enemy archers attempt to focus their \ufb01re on them. An example of a typical archmage is &lt;a href=\"Conjurus%20Rex\"&gt;Conjurus Rex&lt;/a&gt;."}

The mount's appearance changes based on specialization.\nSource.\nThis mount is a quest reward from &lt;a href=\"Dispersion%20of%20the%20Discs\"&gt;Dispersion of the Discs&lt;/a&gt;.\nMount Journal.\n\"Three elements have been fused to create this magical disc, which is attuned to your specific magical powers.\"\nHistory.\nLong before the destruction of the Dalaran during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, Antonidas was working on a secretive project with three of his close friends. Unfortunately, the project was hard to finish and would be abandoned after his death.\nIn the present day, &lt;a href=\"Invoker%20Threadgold\"&gt;Invoker Threadgold&lt;/a&gt; informs the Archmage that &lt;a href=\"Kalec\"&gt;Kalec&lt;/a&gt; wants to take to him. Kalec informs the Archmage that he had found a journal belonging to &lt;a href=\"Antonidas\"&gt;Antonidas&lt;/a&gt;. Reading the journal, Kalec finds out a project that Antonidas had been working on. A disc that could attune itself with the riders magical specialty. Unfortunately, he was unable to finish it and gave all three of the pieces to his closest friends.\n&lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Celindra\"&gt;Archmage Celindra&lt;/a&gt; was the one entrusted with the arcane piece. She is the only one that still owns her piece and gives it to the Archmage willingly.\n&lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; was the one entrusted with the fire piece. The piece was given to him when he was still at &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;'s apprentice. Since he was working &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Alturus\"&gt;Archmage Alturus&lt;/a&gt;, he might know where it is. Going to Alturus, he speaks about how he and Khadgar were studying it in his &lt;a href=\"Alturus%27%20Sanctum\"&gt;sanctum&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, &lt;a href=\"The%20Master%27s%20Cellar\"&gt;The Master's Cellar&lt;/a&gt; was taken over by the Legion and the only portal leading to the sanctum is located there. Making his way into the Cellar, the Archmage fights and sneaks around the area until he finds the portal. Going inside of it, he finds the empty sanctum with the fire piece in the middle.\n&lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Cedric\"&gt;Archmage Cedric&lt;/a&gt; was the one entrusted with the frost piece. He is currently located at the &lt;a href=\"Dalaran%20Crater\"&gt;Dalaran Crater&lt;/a&gt;. Going to him, the Archmage is informed that it was stolen by ogres. The ogres of the &lt;a href=\"Crushridge\"&gt;Crushridge&lt;/a&gt; clan stole the disc and returned to their &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Alterac\"&gt;capital&lt;/a&gt;. Going their himself, the Archmage finds the price of frost on &lt;a href=\"Ok%27rok%20Icetouch\"&gt;Ok'rok Icetouch&lt;/a&gt;. He kills the ogre and retrieves the piece.\nWith all the pieces recovered, the Archmage takes the pieces to Kalec and together they decided to try and complete the project at the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Eye of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;. Along with &lt;a href=\"Apprentice%20Lumin\"&gt;Apprentice Lumin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Apprentice%20Taskka\"&gt;Apprentice Taskka&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Apprentice%20Alena\"&gt;Apprentice Alena&lt;/a&gt;, they work together to defuse the excess energy from the pieces. Then, the Archmage removes the &lt;a href=\"Primal%20Rage%20of%20Fire\"&gt;Primal Rage of Fire&lt;/a&gt; from the fire disc, a &lt;a href=\"Primal%20Rage%20of%20Frost\"&gt;Primal Rage of Frost&lt;/a&gt; from the frost disc and a &lt;a href=\"Primal%20Rage%20of%20the%20Arcane\"&gt;Primal Rage of the Arcane&lt;/a&gt; from the arcane disc.\nWith the excess energy defused, the discs align and infuse into one."}

Weaving their intricate enchantments, these crotchety old &lt;a href=\"wizard\"&gt;wizard&lt;/a&gt;s are called upon to defend &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;ity with all the magical powers at their disposal. Mounted atop their trusty steeds, the Archmagi brandish ancient staves that serve to channel their fierce energies in battle. Though gruff and slightly aloof, these experienced wizards are a heartening sight upon any battlefield where the fate of humanity lies in peril.\nHero names.\nTenn Flamecaster, Nilas Arcanister, &lt;a href=\"High%20Sorcerer%20Andromath%23Notes\"&gt;Andromath&lt;/a&gt;, Shal Lightbinder, &lt;a href=\"Nielas%20Aran%23Trivia\"&gt;Aran Spellweaver&lt;/a&gt;, Manath Magesinger, &lt;a href=\"Landazar\"&gt;Landazar&lt;/a&gt;, Doril Magefont, Peril Spellbinder, &lt;a href=\"Conjurus%20Rex\"&gt;Conjurus Rex&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fordred%20Aran\"&gt;Fordred Aran&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dalar%20Dawnweaver\"&gt;Dalar Dawnweaver&lt;/a&gt;, Kelen the Seeker.\nInformation.\nThe Archmage is one of the most popular Human Heroes. Most Human players choose the Archmage as their first Hero because he helps out significantly with early creeping and harassment thanks to his Water Elementals and Blizzard.\nIn team matches, Brilliance Aura is especially powerful for mana-reliant units and heroes because it increases the mana regeneration of all friendly units in range, especially spellcasters like &lt;a href=\"Shaman%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Shaman&lt;/a&gt;s for their Bloodlust. Even in small or free-for-all matches, Brillance Aura allows the &lt;a href=\"Mountain%20King%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Mountain King&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Paladin%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt; extra regeneration for their spells and can save gold in the long run.\nMass Teleport allows the Archmage to teleport units anywhere around the map as long as a unit is there. This allows Human players to essentially defend any expansion if it comes under attack, and launch surprise attacks thanks due to the &lt;a href=\"Sorceress%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Sorceress&lt;/a&gt;' Invisibility if the enemy lacks the means to detect enemy units.\nWhen used for harassing, most players typically choose Blizzard because it deals enough damage, as it deals a good amount of damage towards workers, with a second cast killing them off if they do not move. Blizzard can also be used against weak ranged units like &lt;a href=\"Archer%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Archer&lt;/a&gt;s, especially at night where ranged units will have difficulty dealing with them, along with the fact that they may hide themselves if they begin taking too much damage.\nWater Elementals aren't as good at harassing the enemy compared to Blizzard. Players who typically invest into this skill first generally send the Archmage out with a few &lt;a href=\"Footman%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Footmen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Militia%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Militia&lt;/a&gt; to take a moderately strong creep camp quickly and gain extra experience. Water Elementals also deal impressive damage as they level up and provide additional damage in the long run. However, they do cost a fair amount of mana to conjure.\nBrilliance Aura should always be the Archmage's second spell learned regardless of which starting spell is given, because it helps your units and allies in battle - Shamans can cast more Bloodlust, and Necromancers can raise more skeletons, just to name a few. This aura also benefits himself; with a high-level Brilliance Aura, the Archmage can continually cast Blizzard without having to run out of mana, and also allows him to conjure more Water Elementals, which take up a considerable amount of his mana.\nMass Teleport should be unlocked when possible, as it's essentially a free Scroll of Teleport, cheaper, and faster - it saves a single inventory slot, the Archmage doesn't have to visit a shop and allows him to move anywhere across the map as long as a friendly unit is there. \nAs a low level, the Archmage should carry a single mana boosting item. This can be traded to one of your other heroes once he has a level 2 Brilliance Aura as his high Intelligence coupled with the aura's gradually increasing mana regeneration should mean he shouldn't run out of mana very quickly.\nIt usually isn't hard to kill an Archmage unless it is a large team game or the player is VERY good at controlling him. \nAs an Intelligence-based Hero, the Archmage has very little health and it should not be too hard to focus him down especially with a Mountain King or aerial units. You should try to take him down when possible, to remove his aura and offensive spells as soon as possible. \nUse &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Hunter%20%28Warcraft%20III%29%23Mana%20Burn\"&gt;Mana Burn&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Hunter%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Demon Hunter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Keeper%20of%20the%20Grove%20%28Warcraft%20III%29%23Entangling%20Roots\"&gt;Entangling Roots&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=\"Keeper%20of%20the%20Grove%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Keeper of the Grove&lt;/a&gt;, Focused Fire with &lt;a href=\"Priestess%20of%20the%20Moon%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Priestess of the Moon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Priestess%20of%20the%20Moon%20%28Warcraft%20III%29%23Searing%20Arrows\"&gt;Searing Arrows&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dreadlord%20%28Warcraft%20III%29%23Sleep\"&gt;Sleep&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=\"Dreadlord%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Dreadlord&lt;/a&gt;, Stun with &lt;a href=\"Tauren%20Chieftain%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Tauren Chieftain&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Mountain%20King%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Mountain King&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpells and abilities.\nBlizzard.\nBlizzard has a damage cap that is invoked when Blizzard hits more than 5 targets per wave.\nBlizzard will hurt your own troops so don't Blizzard your own units or allied units. Be sure to prevent your units from running into a Blizzard after your enemy steps out of it. Whenever possible aim Blizzard on low hit point units such as ranged units and spellcasters. Try to move the enemy into areas where their retreat is cut off so you can Blizzard them. Cast Blizzard on any enemy units that can't run away. If you see that you are casting Blizzard on friendly troops immediately cancel it.\nBlizzard does 50% damage to buildings. Blizzard is not that effective against buildings but it can work. \nBlizzard will not hurt units with Spell Immunity or protection.\nThis spell must be maintained to get the full effect. If the Archmage moves, the spell will not do its full damage. The ice shards will stack their effects on the area of effect. Force the Archmage to move from his location. This will stop the Blizzard. \nSummon Water Elemental.\nWater Elementals become larger and darker as the spell potency is increased.\nFor solo gameplay or 2 vs. 2s, a common strategy is Archmage and Water Elementals to start out with. This works very well with &lt;a href=\"%23Brilliance%20Aura\"&gt;Brilliance&lt;/a&gt;. Try to have enemy Creeps focus on the elemental, although this should not be done if the creep camp contains units capable of using Purge.\nIf dispellers are available use them to kill the Water Elemental, such as &lt;a href=\"Dryad%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Dryad&lt;/a&gt;s.\nBrilliance Aura (Passive).\nThis aura does increase the Mana Regeneration of the Archmage, so it is useful even when the Archmage doesn't have a lot of other spell casters under his command. This aura is especially useful in allied games because the Archmage can help regenerate mana of other heroes and spell casters.\nMass Teleport (Ultimate).\nThis spell is useful because, unlike &lt;a href=\"Scroll%20of%20Town%20Portal%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Town Portal Scrolls&lt;/a&gt;, you can teleport to any location where there is a friendly ground unit or structure. Town Portal Scrolls can only teleport you to a friendly town hall. The cooldown is fairly short, so the Archmage can teleport to a location, engage in battle, then quickly teleport to the next location.\nMass Teleport is very powerful. It can allow you to teleport all around the map responding to enemy attacks and offensively attacking the enemy. It is especially useful in FFA games and large team games. If an enemy is attacking an allied base, a player can use a teleport scroll to head there. If the enemy attack isn't strong enough and can be easily repelled, then the player can easily return to the battlefield with Mass Teleport. \nNote that the target the Archmage is focused on will be disabled for the duration of the teleport. Try not to use it on a summoned unit or a Hero, as if the former dies too fast, the teleport is cancelled, and using it on the latter will turn them into sitting ducks.\nYou can use Mass Teleport to go anywhere, and invisible units can be targeted to allow for surprise attacks. It does not work on wards for balancing reasons.\nLike the Staff of Teleportation offered by &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20Merchant\"&gt;Goblin Merchant&lt;/a&gt;s, casting Mass Teleport does not make the Archmage invulnerable. As it is a channeled spell, forcing the Archmage to move or killing him will prevent him and his units from teleporting away to safety. \nAlternatively if the Archmage is attempting to teleport an army to a location, killing the unit or destroying the building the Archmage is focused on will stop the teleport. This can be risky as there is a very small gap before the Archmage arrives with any units under his command, but can stop reinforcements from arriving if it is pulled off.\nManual description.\nThe manual description is the same than the Battle.net description, with the only difference that in the manual, it is said that their trusty steeds are \"&lt;a href=\"unicorn\"&gt;unicorn&lt;/a&gt;s\"."}

When the demon lord &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; destroyed Dalaran, the barriers were broken and Atiesh was shattered into many pieces. Dosantos left the Kirin Tor and began a search for the greatstaff which continues today.\nShe first joined the Argent Dawn in order to help prevent &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; from gaining control of Atiesh, and has since been enrolled in the Brotherhood of the Light in order to pursue this goal more aggressively.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nArchmage Angela Dosantos was originally located at &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Eastern Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;, present alongside &lt;a href=\"Eligor%20Dawnbringer\"&gt;Eligor Dawnbringer&lt;/a&gt; during a meeting with Scarlet envoys led by &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Commander%20Marjhan\"&gt;Scarlet Commander Marjhan&lt;/a&gt; in order to keep relations between the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; from turning violent, and to counter an imminent attack from &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs a Watcher of Atiesh, she had access to many of Medivh's personal writings. In them, she discovered the secret to creating the &lt;a href=\"Frostfire%20Regalia\"&gt;Frostfire Regalia&lt;/a&gt; armor set for &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s. She also uses &lt;a href=\"Core%20of%20Elements\"&gt;Cores of Elements&lt;/a&gt; in her creations, proposing to the adventurers to exchange them with her for an &lt;a href=\"Insignia%20of%20the%20Dawn\"&gt;Insignia of the Dawn&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, Angela Dosantos appeared alongside &lt;a href=\"Eligor%20Dawnbringer\"&gt;Eligor Dawnbringer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Korfax\"&gt;Korfax&lt;/a&gt; outside &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Hand\"&gt;Tyr's Hand&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Eastern Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt; to cleanse the town from the &lt;a href=\"Risen\"&gt;Risen&lt;/a&gt; who infested it with an assault force of one hundred men. Aided by adventurers, Angela and the Brotherhood were able to capture the city and eliminate the Scarlet leadership including the then undead Valdelmar himself. With this, the Scarlet Crusade definitely lost its hold over the city, which came under the control of the Brotherhood of the Light.\nSome time later she appeared alongside several other members of the &lt;a href=\"Brotherhood%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Brotherhood of the Light&lt;/a&gt; inside &lt;a href=\"Stratholme%20Service%20Entrance\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt; to aid &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s in retaking the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;-infested city.\nQuotes.\nEven in these bright days after the reign of &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'thuzad&lt;/a&gt;, after the fall of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;: the Brotherhood lives on.\nAh, a good question.\nIf you prefer hunting in the great outdoors, there are elementals here in the Plaguelands, Azshara, Burning Steppes, Felwood, Silithus, Winterspirng, and even Un'goro Crater.\nIf you are the type that laughs in the face of danger, then perhaps you should visit Dire Maul.

He created an enchanted gem to aid him in casting spells, but it only worked half the time. He intended to use it to help him cheat during his exams, but he failed them anyway. After learning that cheaters never prosper, he learned his magecraft the hard way.\nAnsirem has a daughter named &lt;a href=\"Catelyn%20the%20Blade\"&gt;Catelyn&lt;/a&gt;. Rejecting the \"boring life\" of a mage, she decided to become a pirate and joined the &lt;a href=\"Blackwater%20Raiders\"&gt;Blackwater Raiders&lt;/a&gt;. Ansirem still cares for his daughter, and has a few \"friends\" he keeps plied with gold in Booty Bay who keep him updated when things happen there.\nBy the time of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, Ansirem was a member of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Six\"&gt;Council of Six&lt;/a&gt;. Moments after the death of &lt;a href=\"Antonidas\"&gt;Antonidas&lt;/a&gt;, Ansirem was among the mages who fought outside &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; when &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; was summoning &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Rommath\"&gt;Grand Magister Rommath&lt;/a&gt; still holds Ansirem (and &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Modera\"&gt;Modera&lt;/a&gt;) in contempt for doing nothing when Grand Marshal &lt;a href=\"Othmar%20Garithos\"&gt;Garithos&lt;/a&gt; locked Prince &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt; and his followers away in the &lt;a href=\"Dungeons%20of%20Dalaran\"&gt;Dungeons of Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorld of Warcraft and the Cataclysm aftermath.\nArchmage Ansirem Runeweaver was a &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"quest%20giver\"&gt;quest giver&lt;/a&gt; located at &lt;a href=\"Dalaran%20Crater\"&gt;Dalaran Crater&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. At some point, he at least worked with &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Revilgaz\"&gt;Baron Revilgaz&lt;/a&gt;. He once visited &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn\"&gt;Stranglethorn&lt;/a&gt; and found a troll relic, a &lt;a href=\"Catelyn%27s%20Blade\"&gt;blade&lt;/a&gt;, and later gave it to Catelyn who ran with it off.\nAnsirem Runeweaver remained at the site of the crater left behind by Dalaran's literally earth-shaking exit until the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; of the world. Despite his disappearing he still served the Kirin Tor and was, in fact, a member of &lt;a href=\"The%20Six\"&gt;The Six&lt;/a&gt;.\nAnsirem, &lt;a href=\"Modera\"&gt;Modera&lt;/a&gt;, and a few other magi arrived near &lt;a href=\"Booty%20Bay\"&gt;Booty Bay&lt;/a&gt; to save his daughter Catelyn when she and her crew were under attack from the &lt;a href=\"Bloodsail%20Buccaneers\"&gt;Bloodsail Buccaneers&lt;/a&gt;. He gave her his cheating gem (having to admit where it came from as the other magi knew about it) to pay off a debt to the &lt;a href=\"Steamwheedle%20Cartel\"&gt;Steamwheedle Cartel&lt;/a&gt;, although he advised her to leave out the part of its unreliability when she sells it.\nAnsirem was present during the meetings of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Six\"&gt;Council of Six&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; who was asking for help in defending &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt; and attacking &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; called for a vote to have the Horde return to Dalaran, Ansirem was the only member of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Six\"&gt;Council of Six&lt;/a&gt; besides Jaina who voted no. They were outvoted and Jaina left, leaving Khadgar to take over.\n&lt;a href=\"Aethas%20Sunreaver\"&gt;Aethas Sunreaver&lt;/a&gt; sought to return to Dalaran after being expelled in the &lt;a href=\"Purge%20of%20Dalaran\"&gt;Purge of Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, and used the retrieval of &lt;a href=\"Felo%27melorn\"&gt;Felo'melorn&lt;/a&gt; to help convince the council. Khadgar had the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Six\"&gt;Council of Six&lt;/a&gt; take a vote. While Ansirem expressed doubt that Aethas wouldn't just betray them again, &lt;a href=\"Karlain\"&gt;Karlain&lt;/a&gt; brought up that if Aethas had any ulterior motives he would have simply given Felo'melorn to one of his &lt;a href=\"Sunreavers\"&gt;Sunreavers&lt;/a&gt;. Convinced by Karlain's words, Ansirem changed his vote to accepting Aethas back into the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;, although not as a member of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Six\"&gt;Six&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nAnsirem Runeweaver was at the time of \"&lt;a href=\"Lands%20of%20Conflict\"&gt;Lands of Conflict&lt;/a&gt;\" a leading member of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;, and was the ruler of Dalaran. He lead a conclave of fellow wizards in their vigil of the (former) dome. He constantly moved about the dome\u2019s periphery. He was a nice enough person, but said very little of what went on beneath the dome. Dressed in an elaborate violet robe, the bearded man stood with his eyes closed and his brow furrowed in concentration. He was quite tall, and, although he appeared fairly old, he stood perfectly still \u2014 reflecting a great deal of physical discipline. The man carried no obvious weaponry, but his arms were crossed in his robes, concealing both hands.\nAnsirem Runeweaver was no stranger to combat, having helped defend the magical city of Dalaran for the better part of four decades. He was confident, but not cocky, and always seemed to know where best to strike for maximum effect. Upon engaging in combat, Ansirem\u2019s first action was usually to summon additional help, immediately following with a series of offensive blasts directed at enemy spellcasters. He targeted arcane spellcasters first, then any healers or archers. If Ansirem appeared to be winning after the first few exchanges of a combat, he pressed the advantage with area-effect spells such as rain of fire or shockwave. If he thought he is losing, however, Ansirem would not hesitate to cast teleport and beat a hasty retreat back to his private sanctum in Dalaran.\nAuthorship.\nHe is also the author of various books which can be found in Dalaran:"}

{"id": "234897", "revid": "22514", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=234897", "title": "Archmage Arugal (tactics)", "text": "Archmage Arugal is a former mage of Dalaran and the final boss of &lt;a href=\"Shadowfang%20Keep\"&gt;Shadowfang Keep&lt;/a&gt;.\nStrategy.\nArugal is without a doubt the most difficult of the low level bosses. Although since the changes in patch 2.3.0, he is fairly easy to defeat by a good group. Unlike the bosses of Wailing Caverns or the Deadmines he is more than simply tank and spank/CC. Arugal has three abilities: Void Bolt, Teleport, and a werewolf control ability that transforms one of your party into a Worgen \u2014 which will then attack the rest of the party. The Void Bolts are very powerful, dealing up to 255 damage. Arugal is extremely capable of three and four-shotting party members. A tank or member with high health are the only ones who will be able to survive continuous aggro, and he will need large amounts of healing and perhaps shielding. \nArugal's room is divided: You enter it on top of a raised platform out of his aggro range. This platform goes around the right side of the room. The room is sunken down to the floor below you, where there are three Sons of Arugal. You will need to pull these. On a small raised platform across from where you enter is Arugal. At several points throughout the fight, Arugal teleports to the other raised platform. It is a good idea to \"not\" chase him, as he will teleport back in a few seconds, and melee can quickly pick up DPS when he returns. Ranged DPS should continue attacking and your healer should keep up the healing until he teleports back. A valid tactic, if you have a Priest or Warlock who is capable of doing so, is to use &lt;a href=\"Mana%20Burn\"&gt;Mana Burn&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Drain%20Mana\"&gt;Drain Mana&lt;/a&gt; on him. If you can get rid of Arugal's mana he can no longer cast Void Bolts, and his threat to the party (provided your tank is still alive) is almost eliminated. Warriors with &lt;a href=\"Shield%20Bash%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Shield Bash (Classic)&lt;/a&gt;, Rogues with &lt;a href=\"Kick\"&gt;Kick&lt;/a&gt;, Shamans with &lt;a href=\"Wind%20Shear\"&gt;Wind Shear&lt;/a&gt;, Feral Druids with &lt;a href=\"Feral%20Charge\"&gt;Feral Charge&lt;/a&gt; and other classes with interruption abilities should try to stop his casting as much as possible.\nThe other danger is the Worgen transform ability. Arugal will shout \"Release your rage!\" when casting this. Whoever is transformed will begin attacking the party - they should be Polymorphed or feared, the worgen spell only lasts for 10 seconds. There is also the chance that the transformed party member will heal Arugal. The fight is about being able to keep the party alive long enough to kill him and keeping the werewolfed person under control - Arugal has far, far more mana than your healers at this level and when your priest can no longer heal, he will still be able to use Void Bolt. Keep a few healing or mana potions as you should for any final boss of an instance.\nThough the 2.3.0 nerf has made him significantly easier, it is a hard fight if your group doesn't have high dps. Without high dps, you won't kill Arugal fast enough to avoid his more deadly attacks, resulting in quite a difficult battle."}

Horde adventurers are sent to kill him in order to return Ambermill to Azeroth, after which &lt;a href=\"Daschla\"&gt;Daschla&lt;/a&gt; will raise him and the other magi into undeath.

Once at the mercy of his emotions, Karlain had learned to master them. Few are as controlled and thoughtful as he.\nHistory.\nBefore becoming a part of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;, Karlain was a &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; of renown. One man who sought to be his apprentice attempted to rape his wife &lt;a href=\"Aredhel\"&gt;Aredhel&lt;/a&gt;. Karlain fought him off, but his anger got the better of him and he killed Aredhel as well. With his infant son Mardigan, he moved from &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Goldshire\"&gt;Goldshire&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Elwynn%20Forest\"&gt;Elwynn Forest&lt;/a&gt; and Karlain swore he would never let his anger get the better of him again.\nMoments after the death of &lt;a href=\"Antonidas\"&gt;Antonidas&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, Karlain was among the mages who fought outside &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; when &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; was summoning &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt;.\nDark Riders.\nAfter scolding &lt;a href=\"Mardigan\"&gt;Mardigan&lt;/a&gt; for his hooliganism in a bar, Karlain traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Tower%20of%20Azora\"&gt;Tower of Azora&lt;/a&gt;. There, &lt;a href=\"Theocritus\"&gt;Theocritus&lt;/a&gt; told him to protect one of his colleagues, &lt;a href=\"Tannos\"&gt;Tannos&lt;/a&gt;, who was keeping a secret artifact, later revealed to be the Hand of Azora, and keep it safe from the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Riders\"&gt;Dark Riders&lt;/a&gt; that are after it.\nKarlain arrives in &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt; where the guards of the &lt;a href=\"People%27s%20Militia\"&gt;People's Militia&lt;/a&gt; ask him to deal with an annoying priest. He is then introduced to &lt;a href=\"Revil%20Kost\"&gt;Revil Kost&lt;/a&gt;, a wandering &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt; also looking for an artifact. Considering that the Dark Riders were acquiring artifacts, Karlain proposed that they join forces as their missing artifacts may be targeted by the same group. The two were directed to the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Coast%20Quarry\"&gt;Gold Coast Quarry&lt;/a&gt; where &lt;a href=\"Tannos\"&gt;Tannos&lt;/a&gt;' patrol was located. When they rendezvoused with &lt;a href=\"Tannos\"&gt;Tannos&lt;/a&gt;, the entire party was attacked by the Defias Brotherhood. After using the Hand of Azora on the &lt;a href=\"Defias\"&gt;Defias&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Riders\"&gt;Dark Riders&lt;/a&gt; rode in, cleaving off Tannos' hand to retrieve the artifact and finishing him off by beheading him. While Revil took a horse to pursue the Dark Riders, Karlain went back to &lt;a href=\"Elwynn\"&gt;Elwynn&lt;/a&gt; to report Tannos' death to Theocritus.\nBack in &lt;a href=\"Goldshire\"&gt;Goldshire&lt;/a&gt;, he discovers his home desecrated and his son Mardigan missing. &lt;a href=\"Marshal%20Dughan\"&gt;Marshal Dughan&lt;/a&gt; informs him that Mardigan is wanted for the murder of the stranger he fought earlier. With so much damning evidence, Karlain was unsure of his son\u2019s innocence. He returned to the Tower of Azora to discuss the recent events with his friend Theocritus. With Theocritus\u2019 urging, Karlain used the Eye of Azora to discover that his son has traveled to Darkshire.\nKarlain traveled in pursuit. The &lt;a href=\"Night%20Watch\"&gt;Night Watch&lt;/a&gt; Militia he questioned revealed that his son had been in Darkshire, questioning them about the &lt;a href=\"Wolf%20Cult\"&gt;Wolf Cult&lt;/a&gt; but has disappeared while investigating his leads. Just then, the Night Watch received a report of Dark Riders at Manor Mistmantle. To Karlain\u2019s surprise, Revil has also been working with the Night Watch to catch the Dark Riders and the Wolf Cult his son is pursuing. The two investigate &lt;a href=\"Manor%20Mistmantle\"&gt;Manor Mistmantle&lt;/a&gt; and spy on the worgen there who claim to have found the &lt;a href=\"Scythe%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Scythe of Elune&lt;/a&gt;. They were then attacked in surprise by a wandering worgen but was saved by &lt;a href=\"Ambrose\"&gt;Ambrose&lt;/a&gt;, a member of the Night Watch. With his aid, the three decide to take the fight to the worgen party. After dispatching many of the vile creatures, Karlain subdues one to interrogate it for the location of his son. After discovering that Mardigan was being transported to &lt;a href=\"Roland%27s%20Doom\"&gt;Roland's Doom&lt;/a&gt;, a cave by the &lt;a href=\"Tranquil%20Gardens%20Cemetery\"&gt;Tranquil Gardens Cemetery&lt;/a&gt;. Revil killed the worgen and the three made their way to the cave but they encountered a man name &lt;a href=\"Jitters\"&gt;Jitters&lt;/a&gt; who frantically warned them to turn away. Though the man was too shaken up to give out too much details, they did discover that the Scythe of Elune had been discovered and that it is linked both to the Dark Riders and the Wolf Cult.\nAt Roland\u2019s Doom, they dispatched many worgen but Mardigan had already been turned. Mardigan was subdued and underwent a Worgen ritual. The worgen marked him with the &lt;a href=\"Scythe%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Scythe of Elune&lt;/a&gt; and was then bitten by the Worgen pack\u2019s leader. After he was bitten, his father Karlain accompanied by Revil Kost and Ambrose, rushed in to slay the worgen. The battle ended in their victory but Mardigan ran off in the woods during the battle and Ambrose was slain during the fight. As they buried Ambrose, they were attacked by a worgen that has been discovered to be Mardigan, fully transformed and rabid. He was subdued and Karlain used a rage suppressing potion on him allowing him to recognize his father. Though their relationship was still rocky, Karlain assured his son he would do everything in his power to cure him.\nLater on they drifted off to sleep but they were awoken by Revil Kost. Revil Kost was taking them to someone who knew of a worgen cure but in reality he was using them as bait for the Dark Riders. His ploy worked as the Dark Riders attacked them. Fortunately, Revil had prepared an ambush for them and had the Night Watch Militia and &lt;a href=\"Brink\"&gt;Brink&lt;/a&gt;, the rogue gnome, bolster their party. When the battle turned unfavorable for the Dark Riders, one of the Dark Riders teleported the whole party to &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt;. Revil Kost wandered off and Karlain was attacked by more Dark Riders. Mardigan savagely defended his father and Karlain did the same for his son but the floor gave in and they both fell to another floor of the tower. In this floor, Mardigan was shown a false vision of his father murdering his mother in a jealous rage. This vision enraged him to the point where he lost himself to his beastial fury and he turned to attack his father but was subdued by his magic. Revil who had rejoined them, used his Cloak of Purity to ward off the fel magic of the tower and Mardigan was able to see the true vision: Karlain defending his wife from a rapist but accidentally killing her in the process. Having seen his father\u2019s regret and sorrow for his actions, Mardigan was able to calm himself and forgive his father. With the danger passed and their family bond restored, Karlain teleported the party out of the tower. Karlain stated his intention to search for a cure for his son which will require more investigation on the Wolf Cult. Seeing as Revil looked like a man in need of a purpose, the family invites him to journey with them on their quest. Brink, who had acquired their stolen artifacts, gave Karlain back the Hand of Azora, an artifact to Revil, and the Scythe of Elune to an unknown night elf.\nTides of War.\nAt some unknown point in time after the events in &lt;a href=\"Duskwood\"&gt;Duskwood&lt;/a&gt;, Karlain was chosen to be a member of &lt;a href=\"the%20Six\"&gt;the Six&lt;/a&gt;.\nKarlain was present during the meetings of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Six\"&gt;Council of Six&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; who was asking for help in defending &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt; and attacking &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nKarlain and the rest of the Six gathered to vote for the acceptance of the Horde into the Kirin Tor. Karlain voted in favor of this. He then assisted the mages in relocating Dalaran above the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Aethas%20Sunreaver\"&gt;Aethas Sunreaver&lt;/a&gt; sought to return to Dalaran after being expelled in the &lt;a href=\"Purge%20of%20Dalaran\"&gt;Purge of Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, and used the retrieval of &lt;a href=\"Felo%27melorn\"&gt;Felo'melorn&lt;/a&gt; to help convince the council. &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; had the Council of Six take a vote. While &lt;a href=\"Ansirem%20Runeweaver\"&gt;Ansirem Runeweaver&lt;/a&gt; expressed doubt that Aethas wouldn't just betray them again, Karlain brought up that if Aethas had any ulterior motives he would have simply given Felo'melorn to one of his &lt;a href=\"Sunreavers\"&gt;Sunreavers&lt;/a&gt;. Convinced by Karlain's words, Ansirem voted yes to accepting Aethas back into the Kirin Tor.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Vargoth\"&gt;Vargoth&lt;/a&gt; is revealed to have ties with the &lt;a href=\"Empyrean%20Society\"&gt;Empyrean Society&lt;/a&gt;, Karlain reveals that he has seen Vargoth acting oddly.\nHe later traveled to &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Deadwind%20Pass\"&gt;Deadwind Pass&lt;/a&gt;."}

Modera and worked together closely, and she is also a close friend and ally of &lt;a href=\"Aethas%20Sunreaver\"&gt;Aethas Sunreaver&lt;/a&gt;. \nHistory.\nAfter the Second and Third War.\nArchmage Modera became a member of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Six\"&gt;Council of Six&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;. As a member of the council, Modera was present at the meetings of the secret council where the members discussed the possible return of &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; following the war. The council, &lt;a href=\"Krasus\"&gt;Krasus&lt;/a&gt; especially, chose Rhonin to send him on a mission to investigate whether Deathwing had really returned. The ruling mages then learned about a mysterious person known as &lt;a href=\"Daval%20Prestor\"&gt;Daval Prestor&lt;/a&gt; who was rumored to be Deathwing. Modera and &lt;a href=\"Drenden\"&gt;Drenden&lt;/a&gt; then worked to discover if it was true and thus traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt; to meet both, &lt;a href=\"Terenas\"&gt;Terenas&lt;/a&gt; and Prestor. They were unable to discover more about Prestor. Thanks to the efforts of Rhonin, Krasus, &lt;a href=\"Vereesa\"&gt;Vereesa&lt;/a&gt; and many others, Deathwing was defeated once more and Modera was present at the final meeting where the members summarized what has happened.\nShortly before the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, Modera spoke out against &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;'s use of necromancy. She was present when his experiments were discovered, accusing him that his methods would see them condemned as &lt;a href=\"heretic\"&gt;heretic&lt;/a&gt;s, and leading to his expulsion from the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;.\nModera survived the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Dalaran\"&gt;destruction&lt;/a&gt; of Dalaran and stayed in the city.\nNorthrend.\nModera took part in the defense of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; after the city found its footing above the skies of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. She and &lt;a href=\"Aethas%20Sunreaver\"&gt;Aethas Sunreaver&lt;/a&gt; defended the city from the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragon\"&gt;blue dragon&lt;/a&gt; onslaught, using their great powers to create a magical shield around the city. She, Aethas, and &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt; remained in telepathic contact throughout the attack, and joined forces to confront the treacherous &lt;a href=\"Crevan\"&gt;Crevan&lt;/a&gt;.\nModera was supportive of the blood elves being admitted as members of the Kirin Tor once more, agreeing with her Council of Six comrade &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Aethas%20Sunreaver\"&gt;Archmage Aethas Sunreaver&lt;/a&gt;'s plight to see the sin'dorei readmitted officially. Which of the two archmages was truly behind this notion proved a source of wry (and bitter) amusement for the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister\"&gt;Grand Magister of Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rommath\"&gt;Rommath&lt;/a&gt;, whose disdain for Archmage Modera and her supposed indifference during the blood elves' escape from the &lt;a href=\"Dungeons%20of%20Dalaran\"&gt;Dungeons of Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; had not been dulled by their years apart, or lessened by the Kirin Tor's status as a traditional ally to &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, Modera can be found in the Kirin Tor's capital of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, alongside , , and .

When &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; contacted Modera to ask for help, he only found her very exhausted as she, and the remaining mages of the Kirin Tor still awake in the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Citadel\"&gt;Violet Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, were doing all they could to contain the greatest of their kind from joining the Nightmare\u2019s army.\nAfter the Cataclysm.\n&lt;a href=\"Ansirem%20Runeweaver\"&gt;Ansirem Runeweaver&lt;/a&gt;, Modera, and a few other mages arrived near &lt;a href=\"Booty%20Bay\"&gt;Booty Bay&lt;/a&gt; to save Ansirem's daughter &lt;a href=\"Catelyn%20the%20Blade\"&gt;Catelyn&lt;/a&gt; when she and her crew were under attack from the &lt;a href=\"Bloodsail%20Buccaneers\"&gt;Bloodsail Buccaneers&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome time after the death of Deathwing, Modera was present during the meetings of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Six\"&gt;Council of Six&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; who was asking for help in defending &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt; and attacking &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;. She insisted that &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; is neutral and will not attack Orgrimmar.\nDiscovery of Pandaria.\nThough not visibly present during the &lt;a href=\"Purge%20of%20Dalaran\"&gt;Purge of Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, Modera was both sad and angered that the Kirin Tor's efforts to remain above &lt;a href=\"Alliance-Horde%20war\"&gt;the war&lt;/a&gt; had been ruined.\nAt some point, Modera was looking for Jaina to inform her of an urgent matter. She sent her visage to Jaina's chamber but found no one there though Jaina was there, invisible. She left her a message to come to see her and left the room.\nDuring the war against the &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20King\"&gt;Thunder King&lt;/a&gt;, Modera traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Isle of Thunder&lt;/a&gt; as a commander in &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor%20Offensive\"&gt;Kirin Tor Offensive&lt;/a&gt;, dealing with the &lt;a href=\"saurok\"&gt;saurok&lt;/a&gt; threat.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nModera appears at &lt;a href=\"Socrethar%27s%20Rise\"&gt;Socrethar's Rise&lt;/a&gt; with a small group of Kirin Tor. She assists Alliance and Horde members in dealing with the &lt;a href=\"Sargerei\"&gt;Sargerei&lt;/a&gt; threat, mentioning that while she could single-handedly wipe their village out, &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; has suggested a more subtle approach to discern their plans.\nLegion.\nStill a member of the Council of Six under Archmage Khadgar's rule, Modera can once again be found in the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Citadel\"&gt;Violet Citadel&lt;/a&gt; with her colleagues. She aids the soon-to-be new leader of the reformed &lt;a href=\"Tirisgarde\"&gt;Tirisgarde&lt;/a&gt; in obtaining &lt;a href=\"%3AFelo%27melorn\"&gt;:Felo'melorn&lt;/a&gt;, by discreetly contacting them with a message (one whose contents she states will be disavowed if she is approached about it), and helping to arrange a secret meeting with &lt;a href=\"Aethas%20Sunreaver\"&gt;Aethas Sunreaver&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Dalaran%20Crater\"&gt;Dalaran's original, long-abandoned location&lt;/a&gt;. Aethas, still banished from Dalaran for his part in the Divine Bell incident, hopes to earn his re-entry into the city by exchanging key information on the blade's whereabouts. Although Modera is willing to help her old friend, she mentions that others on the council are not as forgiving as she is.\nWhen Aethas and the champion return from Icecrown with the runeblade in tow, Modera urges the council to take this recent act into consideration when deciding whether to grant Aethas' request. After a brief discussion, the council unanimously votes to readmit Aethas into the city, urging him not to misuse this chance to make things right.\nModera then joins the Tirisgarde herself.\nModera participated in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Exodar\"&gt;Battle for the Exodar&lt;/a&gt; battling against &lt;a href=\"High%20General%20Rakeesh\"&gt;High General Rakeesh&lt;/a&gt;, alongside &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Kalec\"&gt;Archmage Kalec&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen alchemists pluck a &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Hair%20of%20Khadgar\"&gt;hair&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar's head&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Market\"&gt;Black Market&lt;/a&gt;, Modera teasingly asks him if he wants her to kiss his head when he reacts in surprise.\nQuotes.\nImage of Archmage Modera, Stars' Rest.\nGreetings, &lt;class&gt;.\nHow may I help you?\nLegion.\nGossip.\nHail, champion.\nWe won't give up without a fight.\nSpeculation.\nModera in Tides of Darkness?\nAn unnamed female member of the Council of the Six was present when Khadgar told the council the information about &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;.

At some point, he sent a report with General &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; with reports, apparently not knowing about the Alliance heroes that stayed here after the explosion of Draenor.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nThe village has survived the following years until the attack of &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; and his blood elves that killed all people in the village except himself; since he was locked up in a magical way in the &lt;a href=\"The%20Violet%20Tower\"&gt;The Violet Tower&lt;/a&gt; and guarded by &lt;a href=\"Ar%27kelos\"&gt;Ar'kelos&lt;/a&gt;. He sensed that &lt;a href=\"Ravandwyr\"&gt;Ravandwyr&lt;/a&gt;, his apprentice who he sent away with his staff during the attack, was still alive. Through his staff he worked with the adventurers to free himself.\nReturn to Azeroth.\nVargoth took up residence in the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Citadel\"&gt;Violet Citadel&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Vargoth%27s%20Retreat\"&gt;Archmage Vargoth's Retreat&lt;/a&gt;. The room is accessible only via the book &lt;a href=\"The%20Schools%20of%20Arcane%20Magic%20-%20Mastery\"&gt;The Schools of Arcane Magic - Mastery&lt;/a&gt;, from the achievement &lt;a href=\"Higher%20Learning\"&gt;Higher Learning&lt;/a&gt;. Vargoth will give you a &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor%20Familiar\"&gt;Kirin Tor Familiar&lt;/a&gt; if you talk to him.\nVargoth later sent his image to aid &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; during the quest &lt;a href=\"The%20Protectors%20of%20Hyjal\"&gt;The Protectors of Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, and then again on the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Rise\"&gt;Violet Rise&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Isle of Thunder&lt;/a&gt;.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nVargoth sent various artifacts from the main timeline into the alternate timeline of . Adventurers collected them and brought to &lt;a href=\"Zooti%20Fizzlefury\"&gt;Zooti Fizzlefury&lt;/a&gt;, Vargoth's most trusted friend and confidant, who summoned Vargoth's image to Draenor. The image then joined the adventurers as a follower in their Garrisons.\nHe notes that his image is still very \"outdated\" and that he has traded up those old robes for much better looking ones.\nLegion.\nVargoth appears in-person once more, having joined the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Six\"&gt;Council of Six&lt;/a&gt;. Vargoth voted in favor to allow the Horde into the Kirin Tor and was present when the spell to teleport Dalaran to the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt; was cast. When &lt;a href=\"Aethas%20Sunreaver\"&gt;Aethas Sunreaver&lt;/a&gt; asked the council to allow him to rejoin the Kirin Tor, Vargoth voted yes.\nVargoth is later revealed to have ties with the &lt;a href=\"Empyrean%20Society\"&gt;Empyrean Society&lt;/a&gt;, an organization of mages looking into forbidden magics such as &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; states that because Vargoth has proven his loyalty to the Kirin Tor many times in the past, he will be given the benefit of the doubt. Nevertheless, Khadgar is obligated to share the concerns about Vargoth with the rest of the Council of Six. &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Karlain\"&gt;Karlain&lt;/a&gt;, two other members of the council, also noted that they had seen Vargoth behaving oddly. As Vargoth has been absent for a while, the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Conjuror of the Tirisgarde&lt;/a&gt; takes a look through his room in the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Citadel\"&gt;Violet Citadel&lt;/a&gt; alongside Kalec and discovers his journal, within which they find notes about the &lt;a href=\"%3ANightborne%20Soulstone\"&gt;:Nightborne Soulstone&lt;/a&gt;, which can channel the power of the souls captured within it.\nThe Tirisgarde later discover that Vargoth has been possessed by &lt;a href=\"Kathra%27natir\"&gt;Kathra'natir&lt;/a&gt;. He is freed and Kathra'natir is imprisoned in the Nightborne Soulstone that he had been using to drain &lt;a href=\"Meryl%20Felstorm\"&gt;Meryl Felstorm&lt;/a&gt;. Vargoth has since been absent, not attending the Council meetings.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Magni\"&gt;Magni&lt;/a&gt; called upon the champions of the &lt;a href=\"Armies%20of%20Legionfall\"&gt;Armies of Legionfall&lt;/a&gt; to draw the corruption out of the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Sword of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, Vargoth carried &lt;a href=\"Aluneth\"&gt;Aluneth&lt;/a&gt;, representing the Tirisgarde for non-mage players.\nDragonflight.\nHe traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;, and can be found alongside &lt;a href=\"Scrollsage%20Nola\"&gt;Scrollsage Nola&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chief%20Telemancer%20Oculeth\"&gt;Chief Telemancer Oculeth&lt;/a&gt; at the quarters of &lt;a href=\"Professor%20Intinosa\"&gt;Professor Intinosa&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Algeth%27ar%20Academy\"&gt;Algeth'ar Academy&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Thaldraszus\"&gt;Thaldraszus&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuotes.\nThe night Kael'thas leveled the village, I could do nothing to help. His magic had already sealed me in the tower, exacerbating my torment by forcing me to witness the deaths of my fellows.\nAnd still the voices are calling from far away, waking me up in the middle of the night.\nGreetings &lt;class&gt;, to my humble retreat. I find this place very relaxing and I have always loved being at home in Dalaran. Sometimes though, it can be a lonely place... such a lonely place.\nLegion.\nHm, have we met before? Your face is quite familiar.\nOh! You are the hero I've been hearing so much about. You are most impressive.\nFew things merit an in-person visit such as this. But when I heard so many dragons were willing to share some of their secrets... well I just had to come.\nI have already learned so much. Like how to add smell and taste to an illusion! Just imagine it!\nIn Hearthstone.\nVargoth appears as in the \"\" expansion for \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\". His flavor text reads: \"He's an archmage, but he might want to brush up on the basics... like aiming.\"\nHe also appears as that can be encountered in the single-player experience."}

They called it Kirin'Var Village; however, shortly after they settled, Draenor was torn apart. The explosion sundered the land, and all that remains today is the &lt;a href=\"Netherstorm\"&gt;Netherstorm&lt;/a&gt;. The surviving wizards remained in their villages for 17 years.\nYears later, Prince &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;, along with his &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elf&lt;/a&gt; followers, attacked the village, wielding more power than the wizards could imagine. Archmage Vargoth ordered his comrades to retreat to the local tower; however, Kael'thas was wiser and stronger than Vargoth: In the moment that Vargoth and his men entered the tower, the Elven Prince sealed the doors with a curse to ensure that none of the wizards within could exit the Violet Tower. Despite Kael'thas' efforts, one of Vargoth's apprentices escaped. His name is &lt;a href=\"Ravandwyr\"&gt;Ravandwyr&lt;/a&gt;.\nRavandwyr saw Kael'thas' plans but was unable to warn his master. With no one at his side, Ravandwyr fled to &lt;a href=\"Area%2052\"&gt;Area 52&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; settlement. Now that the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; has been reopened once more, Ravandwyr seeks help from brave &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;ian adventurers that cross over into &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. Ravandwyr sends them to retrieve &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Vargoth%27s%20Staff\"&gt;Archmage Vargoth's Staff&lt;/a&gt; from a demon named &lt;a href=\"Ekkorash%20the%20Inquisitor\"&gt;Ekkorash the Inquisitor&lt;/a&gt;. After a short inspection, Ravandwyr notices that Ekkorash took the staff's crystalline headpiece for use in some other trinket. Infuriated, Ravandwyr sends the adventurers to collect crystals from ghosts in the north of Area 52. After collecting the crystals, Ravandwyr repairs the staff and gives it to the adventurers. He tells them to go to the Violet Tower in Kirin'Var Village and speak with Archmage Vargoth, to inform him about happenings after the encounter with Kael'thas.\nThe adventurers enter the village and contact an image of Vargoth via the staff, as the real Archmage is still imprisoned. Vargoth asks the adventurers to help him and his comrades to exit the tower. In order to escape, Vargoth asks the adventurers to obtain few relics that he brought with him to Draenor: the &lt;a href=\"Sigil%20of%20Krasus\"&gt;Sigil of Krasus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Krasus%27s%20Compendium\"&gt;Krasus's Compendium&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stone%20of%20Glacius\"&gt;Stone of Glacius&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe first item was a great boon to the Alliance in the battle against the Orcs and is held by &lt;a href=\"Spellbinder%20Maryana\"&gt;Spellbinder Maryana&lt;/a&gt;, a lieutenant of Kael'thas that stole the Sigil from Vargoth. The second item is the Spell book of &lt;a href=\"Krasus\"&gt;Krasus&lt;/a&gt;. The compendium had been stolen from Vargoth by a rebellious apprentice intent on studying necromancy. The apprentice and his followers divided and studied the text in secret, locking themselves inside their houses in the southern part of Kirin'Var Village. The adventurers kill the apprentices and retrieve the compendium; however, the compendium is magically locked because Krasus was well aware of the power of the spells recorded in the book, and he took steps to safeguard them from prying eyes. To unlock it Vargoth asks the adventurers to get the &lt;a href=\"Heliotrope%20Oculus\"&gt;Heliotrope Oculus&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Spellreaver%20Marathelle\"&gt;Spellreaver Marathelle&lt;/a&gt;, one of Kael'thas' lieutenants. The last thing the &lt;a href=\"Archmage\"&gt;Archmage&lt;/a&gt; needs is a powerful magic stone stolen by &lt;a href=\"Summoner%20Kanthin\"&gt;Summoner Kanthin&lt;/a&gt;, who is one of the most senior magistrates in the force Kael'thas sent to decimate Kirin'Var.\nWhen all the items are retrieved, only one thing remains to be done. When Kael'thas sealed the tower, he placed an arcane Golem, known as &lt;a href=\"Ar%27kelos\"&gt;Ar'kelos&lt;/a&gt;, at the bottom of the tower to guard it. Vargoth orders the adventurers to kill the Golem and enter the tower in order to assist him in making preparations for the ritual. Vargoth's freedom is near; however, Vargoth underestimated Kael'thas' magic: There is a ward that prevents the curse from being removed. The adventurers are therefore sent to locate &lt;a href=\"Apex\"&gt;Apex&lt;/a&gt; and obtain &lt;a href=\"Apex%27s%20Crystal%20Focus\"&gt;Apex's Crystal Focus&lt;/a&gt;, an item that gives the power to locate who holds the key to the ward. Using the crystal, Vargoth discovers that the key was found very near to Kael'thas, in the hands of his commander: &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Sarannis\"&gt;Commander Sarannis&lt;/a&gt;. In order to break the curse once and for all, the adventurers venture into &lt;a href=\"Tempest%20Keep\"&gt;Tempest Keep&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"The%20Botanica\"&gt;Botanica&lt;/a&gt; and retrieve . At last, after a very long time, Vargoth and his comrades regain their freedom.\nIt should also be noted that one of Vargoth's apprentices, &lt;a href=\"Naberius\"&gt;Naberius&lt;/a&gt;, is the reason for why the village remains haunted.\nIn \"Wrath of the Lich King\", you may find him in the City of Dalaran after you earn the &lt;a href=\"Higher%20Learning\"&gt;Higher Learning&lt;/a&gt; achievement. He gives you a &lt;a href=\"companion\"&gt;companion&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor%20Familiar\"&gt;Kirin Tor Familiar&lt;/a&gt;. He seems to like being alone.\nNotes and trivia.\nArchmage Vargoth states many things that are very similar to the Eagles song, \"Hotel California.\""}

He tries to acquire some more artifacts but his &lt;a href=\"Sanath%20Lim-yo\"&gt;servant&lt;/a&gt; loses them to a hero.\nLegion.\nEver since Xylem found an ancient grimoire at the &lt;a href=\"Legash%20Encampment\"&gt;Legash Encampment&lt;/a&gt; he has become \"unstable\" and locked himself away in his tower, while his apprentices have gone to ruins across Azshara to find artifacts to impress him. Xylem steals the &lt;a href=\"Focusing%20Iris\"&gt;Focusing Iris&lt;/a&gt; from the vaults of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; to become the most powerful mage of all time, and after a letter proclaiming his intentions is found on the corpse of a &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; agent at the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, he is confronted by an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; sent by &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; on behalf of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Six\"&gt;Council of Six&lt;/a&gt;.

Drained of magic, Azeroth would be ripe for destruction by his demon masters and his power would become limitless. Joanna asked that an end be put to his madness, but requested that his life be spared if possible. During the fight, Xylem came to his senses and attempted to focus the power back through the iris, and as a result the &lt;a href=\"Corrupting%20Shadows\"&gt;Corrupting Shadows&lt;/a&gt; emerged, telling Xylem that he could not defy the will of the Legion. With the Corrupting Shadows' defeat Xylem finished his spell and thanked the hero for sparing his life. The Focusing Iris's energy was returned and the ley lines restored, and Xylem returned the iris to the Kirin Tor with his apologies.\nQuotes.\nGossip.\nLovely outfit.

Yet some of the archmages survived, scarred and worn for their efforts to stop the march of evil and the destruction of the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Citadel\"&gt;Violet Citadel&lt;/a&gt;.\nThose few who lived swore an oath of vengeance. The &lt;a href=\"Archmage\"&gt;Archmage&lt;/a&gt;s of the Kirin Tor bear a deep hatred for the arts of necromancy and the servants of dark powers. Now they hide within the domed ruins of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;. Some say they plan to rid the lands of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;, destroy the remnants of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, and rebuild the Violet Citadel, restoring &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; to its former glory.\nTheir mastery of the arcane makes them potent and fearsome in aspect and power. Having learned much from their defeat, the archmages have become even more dangerous to the forces they oppose.\n&lt;a href=\"Arcanist\"&gt;Arcanist&lt;/a&gt;s following the path of the &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; are not welcome in the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, they are lucky to escape the wrath of the archmages alive."}

Since it is a multiplicative increase, the combined effect of the talents combined is an increase of 11.3% to all frost damage (after the addition of &lt;a href=\"Plus%20damage%20and%20healing\"&gt;+damage from items&lt;/a&gt;). With &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20the%20Elements\"&gt;Curse of the Elements&lt;/a&gt; applied to the target this gives an effective increase of 22.43% (25.70% with 3/3 &lt;a href=\"Malediction%20%28warlock%20talent%29\"&gt;Malediction (warlock talent)&lt;/a&gt;) to all frost damage.\nThis talent doesn't affect the damage numbers which show in the tooltips of your frost spells.\nThe damage multiplier applies to total damage, including the base damage, bonus from &lt;a href=\"spell%20damage\"&gt;spell damage&lt;/a&gt; gear, and any other damage multipliers. The following formula gives the total damage of a frost spell, E, where B is the spell's base damage, c is the spell damage coefficient, d is the amount of spell damage the mage has, and Y is the number of points in Arctic Winds. Critical strikes are not considered.\n&lt;a href=\"Piercing%20Ice\"&gt;Piercing Ice&lt;/a&gt; is a second multiplier applied in a similar way. The following formula includes X, the number of points in Piercing Ice."}

One exception is Arcurion, a formidable ice ascendant tasked to slay &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and retrieve the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt;. Should this twisted elemental being succeed, nothing will be able to stop &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; from ushering in the &lt;a href=\"Hour%20of%20Twilight\"&gt;Hour of Twilight&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nStrategy.\nArcurion's fight is mostly an awareness check for your group, all members must move out of the glyphs that appear on the ground to avoid damage. When Arcurion uses his Chains of Ice ability it is best to use an escape mechanic such as &lt;a href=\"Hand%20of%20Freedom\"&gt;Hand of Freedom&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Master%27s%20Call\"&gt;Master's Call&lt;/a&gt; to ease pressure on your healer to dispel. It is highly recommended for priests to use their &lt;a href=\"Mass%20Dispel\"&gt;Mass Dispel&lt;/a&gt; to remove chains from as many people at once.\nOccasionally Arcurion will freeze Thrall in a block of ice, when this happens all DPS should immediately switch to the ice block that is keeping Thrall stunned. If you do not the elementals will build up and throw ice boulders much more rapidly and force greater amounts of movement and healing out of you group. However, if your group has sufficiently high DPS it is a good strategy to simply burn the boss down quickly to 30% which will automatically release Thrall from the ice tomb.\nAt 30% Arcurion will cast his Torrent of Frost ability, this is a major burn phase at this time Thrall will cast &lt;a href=\"Bloodlust\"&gt;Bloodlust&lt;/a&gt; (which does not trigger the sated debuff and ignores any debuff that would normally bar benefiting from it) making it easier to finish the boss. Major AOE healing such as &lt;a href=\"Tranquility\"&gt;Tranquility&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Hymn\"&gt;Divine Hymn&lt;/a&gt; are very useful in keeping the group alive in this phase as well. If those spells are unavailable it is very important for the group to stack up to ease healer stress and use other damage reduction abilities like &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Guardian\"&gt;Divine Guardian&lt;/a&gt;."}

One of its physical properties is that it faintly glows. Imbibing even a sip causes nightborne eyes to shimmer. Children are usually considered too young for the drink, they thus receive \"mana juice\" instead that still provides nightwell infusions. However, some children were given arcwine during the rationing of Elisande. &lt;a href=\"Mananelle%27s%20Sparkling%20Cider\"&gt;Mananelle's Sparkling Cider&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arcberry%20Juice\"&gt;Arcberry Juice&lt;/a&gt; are also sold by many vendors in the city. \nBackground.\nDuring the long years of &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar City&lt;/a&gt;'s isolation, the &lt;a href=\"night%20elven\"&gt;night elven&lt;/a&gt; residents ran out of food. Faced with starvation, the choice was made to utilize the magical energies as a source of nourishment. The plan worked and the &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt; have since relied on the energies for more than casting spells or performing wondrous magical acts. \nWith the presence of the demons of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; came rationing of the supply of arcwine, under the ruse that there was a 'shortage', to keep the city's populace compliant. This action has opened the door for the growing &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20rebellion\"&gt;resistance&lt;/a&gt; to reach the very hearts of the nightborne population. The resistance increased its support to the suffering citizens and attempted to stir them to action against the regime of the Grand Magistrix and the evil of the Legion.\nThe members of the resistance inside the city stole bottles and casks from the abundance of arcwine provided to the loyalists in order to distribute it among the common populace. This was absolutely necessary to keep them from &lt;a href=\"Withered\"&gt;withering&lt;/a&gt; for another day. The thieving and delivery of the arcwine became more and more dangerous, as the loyalists were becoming more observant, and many wine thieves lost their life.\nAfter the nightborne joined the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, they apparently started exporting arcwine to the faction's other races, with &lt;a href=\"Vintner%20Iltheux\"&gt;Vintner Iltheux&lt;/a&gt; overseeing production. Shortly after the end of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; sent assistants\u2014&lt;a href=\"Micah%20Broadhoof\"&gt;Micah Broadhoof&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Boss%20Mida\"&gt;Boss Mida&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kazit\"&gt;Kazit&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Nomi\"&gt;Nomi&lt;/a&gt;\u2014to the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Vineyards\"&gt;Twilight Vineyards&lt;/a&gt; in order to speed up the process. However, this ended up having the opposite effect since Iltheux assigned the workers to roles they were completely unsuited for. In the hopes of allowing the &lt;a href=\"vulpera\"&gt;vulpera&lt;/a&gt; to join the Horde, &lt;a href=\"Meerah\"&gt;Meerah&lt;/a&gt; and the Horde &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; traveled to the vineyards and reassigned the workers to more suitable tasks. In order to make the wine appeal to the diverse palates of the Horde, Nomi made some slight changes to the ancient nightborne recipe and sent the adventurer to gather &lt;a href=\"Fermented%20Firebloom\"&gt;firebloom&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Silkwing%20Fibers\"&gt;moth fibers&lt;/a&gt; for the task. When the finished wine was brought to Iltheux, the vintner praised it and stated he could not have done better himself.\nProduction process.\nArcwine is made in the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Vineyards\"&gt;Twilight Vineyards&lt;/a&gt; of Suramar. It comes in different varieties, depending on what ingredients are used in the process such as &lt;a href=\"manafruit\"&gt;manafruit&lt;/a&gt;, nightsap, berries, and shadowberries. \nThe fruits are directly harvested from the nightborne orchards. One of them houses a species of tree that produces extra-sweet fruit. The Aging Chamber is necessary to allow the juice to ferment, as time magic inside the chamber enables the vintners to shorten the process. At the bottling facilities, each bottle is sealed with magic to prevent any of the Nightwell's essence from fading, where it is then either stored or distributed. A cask of arcwine can be safely stored for hundreds of years. The distribution facility is where the vintners arrange to send hundreds of barrels and casks of arcwine out to the city. These activities are monitored by the Magistrix herself.\nThe fruits are processed into unfortified wine in a wide vat at the juicing veranda where the juice is extracted. A vintner determines how much of the other basic ingredients are required, and once the process has begun, it is important to keep up the pace as the delicate ingredients spoil quickly. Purified water adds a little moisture to keep the taps flowing. Silver jasmine adds a little brightness to the blend, and shadefruits a sour note. When the juices need a little massaging, one has to step into the vat and jump to squish the mixture around. The produced unfortified wine is then bottled. The process is considered a failure if the arcwine or the ingredients have soured, in which case the batch is destroyed.\nThe most crucial part of the winemaking process is infusing the wine with Nightwell essence, which gives it the restorative properties the nightborne enjoy. This infusion process starts with taking up an energy vessel - a type of bowl - and using it to catch the delicate dewdrops of Nightwell energy as they fall. This is the only way one can safely manage its essence. Once the vessel is full, it is poured into a cask of unfortified wine. Infusion officially makes the wine fortified."}

When Tirion attempted to escape from Mardenholde Keep to save Eitrigg from execution, Arden confronted him in the &lt;a href=\"Stables\"&gt;stable yard&lt;/a&gt;; however, instead of stopping Tirion, he let his old master flee.\nYears later, Arden was present in a ceremony in which &lt;a href=\"Taelan%20Fordring\"&gt;Taelan Fordring&lt;/a&gt; became a paladin. The two had became good friends during the exile of Tirion. When the ceremony was over, Arden turned around only to see Tirion in disguise. He did not take any action against him, in fact, he was glad to see him.\nHis status afterwards is unknown.\nSpeculation.\nAs he hasn't been mentioned, nor is he present in the rebuilt Hearthglen, Arden may have died during the battles against the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;."}

An enchanted, mystical forest of rest and hibernation, Ardenweald is where &lt;a href=\"Wild%20God\"&gt;Wild God&lt;/a&gt;s and other spirits of nature travel upon death. Giant &lt;a href=\"dream%20tree\"&gt;dream tree&lt;/a&gt;s across the forest draw in &lt;a href=\"anima\"&gt;anima&lt;/a&gt;, which is then used by the Night Fae to rejuvenate the spirits as they slumber inside &lt;a href=\"wildseed\"&gt;wildseed&lt;/a&gt;s and prepare them to be reborn into the world of the living. At the &lt;a href=\"Grove%20of%20Awakening\"&gt;Grove of Awakening&lt;/a&gt; a portal is maintained to ferry souls back to their worlds sustained by four focuses; when it is time for a soul to be reborn, they are brought the grove to return home and begin their cycle anew. In the early days of Ardenweald, it was just &lt;a href=\"Marasmius\"&gt;Marasmius&lt;/a&gt; and the Winter Queen, but as she developed the trees, the &lt;a href=\"tirnenn\"&gt;tirnenn&lt;/a&gt; came to be alongside them and helped build the groves.\nEach dream tree has a name, and each grove has a tree. The grove of &lt;a href=\"Hibernal%20Hollow\"&gt;Hibernal Hollow&lt;/a&gt; has &lt;a href=\"Tirna%20Glayn\"&gt;Tirna Glayn&lt;/a&gt;, the grove of &lt;a href=\"Tirna%20Vaal\"&gt;Tirna Vaal&lt;/a&gt; gets its name from its tree, &lt;a href=\"Tirna%20Noch\"&gt;Tirna Noch&lt;/a&gt; fell earlier in the drought, &lt;a href=\"Tirna%20Rowen\"&gt;Tirna Rowen&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Heartwood%20Grove\"&gt;Heartwood Grove&lt;/a&gt; perished recently and has not had a wildseed for quite some time, the grove of &lt;a href=\"Claw%27s%20Edge\"&gt;Claw's Edge&lt;/a&gt; has &lt;a href=\"Tirna%20Kaithe\"&gt;Tirna Kaithe&lt;/a&gt;, the grove of &lt;a href=\"Glitterfall%20Basin\"&gt;Glitterfall Basin&lt;/a&gt; has &lt;a href=\"Tirna%20Eas\"&gt;Tirna Eas&lt;/a&gt;, the grove of &lt;a href=\"Dreamsong%20Fenn\"&gt;Dreamsong Fenn&lt;/a&gt; has &lt;a href=\"Tirna%20Fenn\"&gt;Tirna Fenn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tirna%20Scithe\"&gt;Tirna Scithe&lt;/a&gt; is particularly dangerous, and &lt;a href=\"Tirna%20Marwol\"&gt;Tirna Marwol&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Darkreach\"&gt;Darkreach&lt;/a&gt; were lost long ago prior to the drought.\nDescription.\n\"The vast forests of Ardenweald serve the natural aspects of life and death. Its wilds are a sanctuary for the great spirits of nature that seek respite and renewal before awakening to join the cycle anew.\" \"Ardenweald and the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; are opposite blooms connected to the same tree. If the Dream is the personification of &lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;Life&lt;/a&gt; in the waxing stage, then Ardenweald is life when it is waning.\"\nArdenweald serves as an afterlife for mortal souls who shared a close bond with the natural cycle, like &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;. Upon arrival, these souls can choose an animal form infused with Ardenweald's celestial magic and spend an eternity caring for the wilds. This ability is called the &lt;a href=\"soulshape\"&gt;Boon of Shapes&lt;/a&gt;, originally granted by the Winter Queen to the first mortals that the &lt;a href=\"Arbiter\"&gt;Arbiter&lt;/a&gt; assigned to Ardenweald. In exchange for this boon, souls give a part of their anima to the forest.\nArdenweald can be compared to the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;, to which it has an ancient link that has existed since before the fracturing of the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;, but where the Dream represents the spring and summer of the cycle of life, Ardenweald reflects autumn and winter. In essence, the realm is the highest expression of the relationship between endings and beginnings\u2014between &lt;a href=\"Death\"&gt;Death&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;Life&lt;/a&gt;.\nArdenweald is where the &lt;a href=\"demigod\"&gt;demigod&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt; recovered after his death during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, before returning to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;. Recently, Ardenweald has suffered more keenly from soul-drought than any other realm in the Shadowlands. For the first time in endless ages, the Night Fae's &lt;a href=\"Winter%20Queen\"&gt;Winter Queen&lt;/a&gt; must choose which of the land's formerly lush groves\u2014and which souls\u2014will be fed the last precious drops of anima and which will fade away forever. In addition, Ardenweald is also under attack by the &lt;a href=\"Drust\"&gt;Drust&lt;/a&gt;, who are invading from their realm of &lt;a href=\"Thros%2C%20the%20Blighted%20Lands\"&gt;Thros&lt;/a&gt; in order to use the rebirth mechanisms of Ardenweald as a means to escape their fate, though they had invaded before long ago. Only Marasmius and a few fae recall that the Drust had invaded before, most believing them to be legends and stories to scare young fae.\nThe waters of Ardenweald carry deep power that most have forgotten, except the tirnenn. Ardenweald is in perpetual twilight, and is illuminated by \"gormgris\" from &lt;a href=\"gorm\"&gt;gorm&lt;/a&gt; for the sake of visitors. The majority of the equipment, weapons, and tools are made in &lt;a href=\"Tirna%20Eas\"&gt;Tirna Eas&lt;/a&gt;: armor of the night fae is made from the husks of gorm that soak in the waters of the &lt;a href=\"Banks%20of%20Life\"&gt;Banks of Life&lt;/a&gt;,the weapons and tools of the night fae are made from gorm claws and stingers at the &lt;a href=\"Growthworks\"&gt;Growthworks&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Ardenmoth\"&gt;Ardenmoth&lt;/a&gt; scales are also a primary material for fae armor.\nAll of the mushrooms and fungi that spread across Ardenweald are a part of a great sentient fungus, &lt;a href=\"Marasmius\"&gt;Marasmius&lt;/a&gt;, who spans the scope of the entire zone.\nAs of &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt;'s reawakening and binding to Ardenweald, she has begun having visions of &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; being consumed by vengeance, Ardenweald's destruction, and that she has a role to play in both defending the weald and saving the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; trapped in the Maw.\nArdenweald is described as \"perpetual twilight\" and a \"moonless night\", but is also described as being in moonlight. Additionally, the zone has an \"Other Side\" accessible through the &lt;a href=\"Dream%20Catcher%20%28item%29\"&gt;Dream Catcher&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Zovaal\"&gt;Zovaal&lt;/a&gt;, Ardenweald began to recover from the anima drought, becoming a place of restoration and recovery.\nGeography.\nPortal.\n &lt;a href=\"Nazmir\"&gt;Nazmir&lt;/a&gt; (activated with &lt;a href=\"Something%20Extra%20for%20the%20Winter%20Queen\"&gt;Something Extra for the Winter Queen&lt;/a&gt;)\nDevelopment.\nAccording to art director &lt;a href=\"Ely%20Cannon\"&gt;Ely Cannon&lt;/a&gt;, Ardenweald is inspired by a piece of old, unused concept art that the art team found during the development of ' and which depicted a forest with specks of starlight on the ground. Cannon has also stated that the concept of a celestial canopy with stars originated from a brainstorming session for &lt;a href=\"Thros%2C%20the%20Blighted%20Lands\"&gt;Thros, the Blighted Lands&lt;/a&gt; in '. The developers initially wanted to include this theme as part of &lt;a href=\"Bastion\"&gt;Bastion&lt;/a&gt;, thus splitting the zone between a light, heavenly side and a dark, celestial forest side, but they eventually decided that the latter idea was unique and interesting enough to deserve its own separate zone.\nWhen designing Ardenweald, Blizzard's artists decided to not include any traditional architecture and instead focus on using the forest's natural elements to create the setting. They were partially inspired by the treetop &lt;a href=\"arakkoa\"&gt;arakkoa&lt;/a&gt; structures in \"\". However, since these areas could often make navigation and gameplay difficult for players, they strived to instead keep Ardenweald's structures and areas open-air. Since the trees and groves are what make up the villages of the Night Fae, the artists managed to avoid the necessity of typical buildings and ended up not using any real-world references, instead leaning on their love of folklore, fairy tales, and the work of fantasy artists like .\nArdenweald's connection to the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; was important to the team, who used every chance to create something similar but with different colors and shapes to convey Ardenweald's distinct purpose. While the Dream (as portrayed in \"\") is bright and vibrant, Ardenweald is somber and tranquil, with blue and purple colors and smooth, swirling shapes designed to create the feeling of a \"celestial nursery\" where nature spirits come to rest and be at peace. The cool color palette immediately reminds viewers of night time; the sky's color was based on reference photos of deep blue and purple skies taken in northern England. Ardenweald's different seasonal states\u2014like the fully deteriorated &lt;a href=\"anima\"&gt;anima&lt;/a&gt;-deprived areas and the in-between states where areas are starting to go into fall\u2014was one of the ways the artists tried to make the zone feel different from the game's other forest zones.\nFrom the beginning, the artists pictured Ardenweald as a cosmic space that combined the celestial look of galaxies with natural tree canopies, which led to the design of the towering &lt;a href=\"dream%20tree\"&gt;dream tree&lt;/a&gt;s that dominate the forest. An early discussion about the zone's ecology and the decomposition process led to the invention of the &lt;a href=\"gorm\"&gt;gorm&lt;/a&gt;, creatures which ended up becoming fairly central to the zone's storyline. Early in the design phase, the artists knew they wanted to distinguish Ardenweald's inhabitants (such as the &lt;a href=\"vorkai\"&gt;vorkai&lt;/a&gt;) from other creatures they'd designed in the past by giving them a wild feel and more animalistic features.\nThe artists normally try to ensure that a zone's environment feels natural and well-thought out, such as thinking about where a body of water is coming from or deciding if a mountain is shaped by erosion or tectonic shifts, but in Ardenweald's case they allowed themselves to include a few supernatural details, such as water pouring into a pond from a tree canopy, specifically because they wanted the zone to feel magical and outside the boundaries of the natural world. The artists created several new particle effects for the zone, including a brand new water type, weather systems where an \"anima rain\" is happening, leaf effects, as well as dust and debris effects to give the anima-starved areas a sense of disintegration and deterioration.\nThe anima branch latticework found throughout the zone was designed by environment artist &lt;a href=\"Gabriel%20Gonzalez\"&gt;Gabriel Gonzalez&lt;/a&gt;, who wanted to establish the branch-like lattice as a defining shape for Ardenweald. The lattices were designed to have some heft but also convey the elegant and magical way in which Ardenweald's inhabitants shape their environment. The shapes were inspired by jewelry and the 1982 film \"\". The zone also contains tree roots shaped together to form archways. The idea for these was that they were constructed by the &lt;a href=\"tirnenn\"&gt;tirnenn&lt;/a&gt;, who stick their arms into the ground to force roots out of the ground. The flowers of the zone are the result of the artists being allowed to create their own ideas of the perfect fairy tale flowers by combining parts from different real-world plants.\nArdenweald's soundscape was created by sound supervisor &lt;a href=\"David%20Rovin\"&gt;David Rovin&lt;/a&gt;, who wanted the sound to capture the zone's story\u2014a land of rebirth and gentleness whose magic is cool and tempered, but which turns dry and brittle when said magic is absent. Rovin gravitated to the world \"astral\", which carries connotations of contemplativeness and stillness but also spirituality. He started from organic sounds like birds, chimes, and wind, which have an innate tonality that match the zone. These sounds also help create contrast with the dead areas that have been deprived of anima and have more earthy timbres like dirt, dry winds, and twigs.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

After the &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Wars\"&gt;Troll Wars&lt;/a&gt;, he would become the ruler of the autonomous city-state of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nArdogan was an immigrant from another part of &lt;a href=\"Arathor\"&gt;Arathor&lt;/a&gt; to the growing trade outpost of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;. At the time of Arathor's expansion, Dalaran was rapidly growing in population, culture, and wealth. Occupying a place at the center of the kingdom, it was a hub of commerce and travel. The townspeople found Ardogan to be an eccentric mage, but brilliant in his endeavors. Carrying the admiration of the people, they elected him their leader.\nGovernance of pre-magocratic Dalaran.\nArdogan's administration furthered the prestige and prosperity of Dalaran throughout all of Arathor. Under his guidance, Dalaran began to acquire significant political influence, allowing the city to begin its first steps out from under the administration of the king in &lt;a href=\"Strom\"&gt;Strom&lt;/a&gt;. Ardogan deepened this political leverage after he invited the disenfranchised spellcasters of Arathor to reside in Dalaran without prejudice or wariness from its inhabitants.\nDespite the central role of the human magi in the success of the Troll Wars, the humans of Arathor looked on sorcerers with suspicion. Much of the human population looked upon mages with distrust and fear. By 2,700 BDP, the paranoia of the people sparked open conflicts between themselves and wizards. Mages began to leave population centers to reside in rural areas to escape what they saw as \"baseless paranoia.\"\nSince Ardogan, a mage, had won the support and admiration of the population, he believed they would be tolerate of others too. Ardogan pictured Dalaran as being a central haven for humanity's spellcasters. By inviting the mages to reside in Dalaran, if the Arathi leaders sought the support of the magi, they would have to deal with Dalaran. Under these conditions, Strom was forced to grant Ardogan significant autonomy to insure the continued support of Dalaran.\nAs the first &lt;a href=\"sorcerer\"&gt;sorcerer&lt;/a&gt;s arrived, Dalaran was reborn as they used their magic to craft a city of splendor: towers, terraces, libraries, and arcane repositories.\nCreation of the Magocracy.\nWith the increasingly central role of magic in the affairs of Dalaran and the rise its population of magic users, Ardogan reformed the structure of Dalaran's government by creating a central ruling council made up himself and other powerful sorcerers. This council of \"&lt;a href=\"Magocrats\"&gt;Magocratic lords&lt;/a&gt;\" were the forerunners to the future &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;. Within a few years, the skilled rule of Ardogan and the magocrats made crime virtually nonexistent and magical protection from the dangers of the wild allowed trade and industry to expand. During this time, more and more people came to Dalaran for the economic opportunities it offered."}

Damaging abilities have a cap of twenty targets, and healing abilities have a cap of six targets. For damaging abilities, from one to twenty targets, the total damage will increase linearly with each target affected. After that, the total damage output is capped and the amount of damage each individual target will take decreases proportionally.\nDetails.\nAssume a fictional AoE spell hits for 1,000 damage against a single target after all effects like &lt;a href=\"spell%20power\"&gt;spell power&lt;/a&gt; are taken into account. Thus, with an increasing amount of targets hit per cast, assuming all else is held constant, the total damage output is:\nThe damage cap is raised based on other effects that modify ability damage, such as spell power. For abilities that can land a &lt;a href=\"spell%20critical%20strike\"&gt;critical strike&lt;/a&gt;, any crits will not be affected by the cap, and the total damage output can thus exceed the nominal cap. Using the same fictional area of effect ability that hits for 1,000 damage normally, a critical strike would land for 2,000 damage, and if by some cosmic coincidence all twenty targets are critically struck at the same time, the total damage output would be 40,000 damage.\nHistory.\nFrom &lt;a href=\"Patch%203.3\"&gt;Patch 3.3&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Patch%205.2\"&gt;Patch 5.2&lt;/a&gt;, the cap was at ten targets, rather than twenty. Before patch 3.3, the damage cap was completely static based on the rank of the ability, back when abilities had fixed ranks, and increasing damage would mean that players would hit the cap against fewer and fewer targets. Thus, assuming an ability hit for 200 damage against one target, but after equipping armor it hit for 300 damage, the damage cap would still be 2,000 damage, and players would start hitting the cap at 6.67 targets.\nBefore &lt;a href=\"Patch%202.2\"&gt;Patch 2.2&lt;/a&gt;, there was no damage cap and damage output would increase linearly without limit."}

{"id": "94862", "revid": "49740203", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=94862", "title": "Supremus", "text": "Supremus is the second &lt;a href=\"boss\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt;. The fight is a &lt;a href=\"battle%20for%20survival\"&gt;battle for survival&lt;/a&gt;. After dropping this boss, the next four bosses (&lt;a href=\"Shade%20of%20Akama\"&gt;Shade of Akama&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Teron%20Gorefiend\"&gt;Teron Gorefiend&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Reliquary%20of%20Souls\"&gt;Reliquary of Souls&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gurtogg%20Bloodboil\"&gt;Gurtogg Bloodboil&lt;/a&gt;) can be killed in any order.\nOverview.\nThe gatekeeper Supremus cycles between striking a primary target while creating rivers of fel flame, and fixating on random players while littering the area with volcanic geysers.\nPreparation.\nAny standard raid composition will do. One main tank and at least one off tank with high health are needed. 2-3 healers should be on the main tank, 2 healers on the off tank(s), and the other healers on the raid.\nNo special &lt;a href=\"resistance\"&gt;resistance&lt;/a&gt; gear is required, although fire damage from the volcanoes is resistible. As the enrage timer is generous, some guilds may find it useful to stack fire resistance should their primary difficulty be people dying in volcanoes.\nPhase 1.\nDuring this phase, the fight is basic &lt;a href=\"tank%20and%20spank\"&gt;tank and spank&lt;/a&gt;. Raid members must move to avoid the molten flames. \nIn order to absorb the hateful strikes, at least one off tank (better two) should stay in melee range at all times. Since the hateful strikes can occur irregularly (and sometimes in rather quick succession), the healers must be alert and quickly bring up all tanks. The main tank should have the highest health, because if one of the off-tanks has higher base HP, it's possible that Supremus ignores that off-tank and hits someone else with a hateful strike instead.\nAs of 2.4, the hitbox of Supremus is larger than his melee range, thus melee damage dealers not designated as off tanks can hit him from outside his melee range, and be that way safe from all hateful strikes. This also increases safety from molten flames. The designated off tanks should stand closer to Supremus, to make sure they're eligible targets for hurtful strikes. The OTs should stand away from the other melee classes, so that Supremus must turn to deal a hateful strike.\nAfter 60 seconds, Supremus switches to phase 2. Melee DPS needs to run away from Supremus a few seconds before the start of phase 2 to avoid being too close in case they are the first focus of Supremus' Gaze.\nPhase 2.\nSimilar to Thaladred the Darkener at &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt;, Supremus sets his gaze on a random raid member and walks toward them at about 90% of normal run speed. If he catches his target, he melees it which usually means a one-hit kill on most raid members.\nIf the target of his gaze is within roughly 40 yards, he occasionally hits it with a ranged attack, which deals ~5k physical damage and deals a knockback (usually away from Supremus). If the gaze target is further away than 40 yards, he dashes at about five times the normal run speed until the range is about 20 yards.\nThere is insufficient room to kite him in a straight line when he's dashing, so the targets should attempt to either stay within 40 yards (to prevent dashing) or not kite him in a linear path.\nBesides the Molten Flames (which still spawn during Phase 2), small volcanoes appear randomly on top of people. The volcanoes deal substantial AoE damage even before they're fully visible, it's a good idea not to stay immobile in larger groups for a long time. &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Speed\"&gt;Minor Speed&lt;/a&gt; or one of its variations such as &lt;a href=\"Boar%27s%20Speed\"&gt;Boar's Speed&lt;/a&gt; is recommended for this fight.\nPhase 2 continues for 60 seconds, with a gaze change approximately every 10 seconds if the target does not die. The same person can be gazed twice in a row, and totems are valid gaze targets. For unknown reasons, some players may not be valid gaze targets. These players can get a gaze but Supremus switches to a different target within a second.\nWhen kiting Supremus, the large obstructions in the upper part of the area should be avoided. Players must not climb on them, and runners should give them a wide berth because it's possible for him to get stuck on the structures, which causes him to &lt;a href=\"evade\"&gt;evade&lt;/a&gt; (while still spawning volcanoes), which is a very bad state of affairs. It is also possible for him to immediately teleport anyone outside of his ability to reach to his feet, which can be very nasty. This can also happen if he knocks his gaze target up onto a wall. Travel Form and Ghost Wolf are highly recommended in this phase.\nThere is no aggro table for Phase 2, and an aggro wipe when he switches back to Phase 1. Classes with DoT spells should be careful that their DoTs have finished before the switch back to Phase 1, or they may draw aggro. A paladin tank can be helpful in picking up Supremus after the phase transition, as it is a demon and can be hit by &lt;a href=\"Exorcism\"&gt;Exorcism&lt;/a&gt; at range."}

Once a great &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elven&lt;/a&gt; settlement \u2014 though not as glorious as the capital of &lt;a href=\"Zin-Azshari\"&gt;Zin-Azshari&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 it was famously the hometown of several important night elves: &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, his brother &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion&lt;/a&gt;, their friend &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;, and the siblings &lt;a href=\"Jarod%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Jarod&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;. Today it is the home of the &lt;a href=\"Nightborne\"&gt;Nightborne&lt;/a&gt;. Suramar is built on &lt;a href=\"ley%20line\"&gt;ley line&lt;/a&gt;s, and arcane coils in the tunnel system running beneath Suramar and the surrounding areas tap into those ley lines' power. Since the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Nightwell\"&gt;Nightwell&lt;/a&gt;, the ley lines have become redundant and the arcane coils abandoned.\nHistory.\nSuramar was the location of the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Temple of Elune&lt;/a&gt;, the central place of worship for the night elves. The high priestess of &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt; lived in the temple. The &lt;a href=\"Boughs%20of%20Azshara\"&gt;Boughs of Azshara&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Izal-Shurah\"&gt;Izal-Shurah&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arauk-Nashal\"&gt;Arauk-Nashal&lt;/a&gt; were also located here.\nJust before the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Broxigar\"&gt;Broxigar&lt;/a&gt; was held captive in &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar City&lt;/a&gt; until he was freed by &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;. During the war, the Legion's efforts in the city were led by the &lt;a href=\"pit%20lord\"&gt;pit lord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ronokon\"&gt;Ronokon&lt;/a&gt;. The city was attacked and ravaged by the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Suramar was subsequently used by the &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt; in an experiment to create an army of the undead, an experiment which laid the groundwork for the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; ten thousand years later. At some point during the war, the &lt;a href=\"demon%20lord\"&gt;demon lord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sciallax\"&gt;Sciallax&lt;/a&gt; came to Suramar and offered the night elves at the time a &lt;a href=\"Orb%20of%20Sciallax\"&gt;powerful artifact&lt;/a&gt; in return for their servitude to the Legion.\nThe Burning Legion attempted to open a second portal besides the one at the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; in the Temple of Elune in order to attack the night elves on two fronts. The resident &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; used the &lt;a href=\"Pillars%20of%20Creation\"&gt;Pillars of Creation&lt;/a&gt; to close the portal and put several seals on the temple. The &lt;a href=\"Wild%20God\"&gt;Wild God&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ashamane\"&gt;Ashamane&lt;/a&gt; battled Ronokon in &lt;a href=\"Val%27sharah\"&gt;Val'sharah&lt;/a&gt; just outside Suramar and sacrificed her life to kill him. In doing so, she was able to buy the elves the time they needed to craft a shield around their city.\nMost of Suramar was blasted to the bottom of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Sundering&lt;/a&gt;. However, some of it remained above shore in the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt; due to the efforts of the resident &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt;, who crafted a magical shield that kept a section of their city together. This shield would stay up for 10,000 years, as the Highborne believed the world outside of &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar City&lt;/a&gt; had been destroyed. Under their shield they would evolve into the &lt;a href=\"Nightborne\"&gt;Nightborne&lt;/a&gt;, reliant on their source of power, the &lt;a href=\"Nightwell\"&gt;Nightwell&lt;/a&gt;. While the city was shielded, it was next to impossible for normal Nightborne to leave, though some illegally did through skillful navigation. Much later, dwarves recovered a &lt;a href=\"Highborne%20Astrolabe\"&gt;Highborne Astrolabe&lt;/a&gt; from the undersea ruins of Suramar.\nThe sunken &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Temple of Elune&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar City&lt;/a&gt; was later used by the &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt; to hold the &lt;a href=\"Avatar%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;physical remains&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jeweled%20Scepter%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Jeweled Scepter&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Eye&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, which led to the building's more familiar designation, the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, the portion of Suramar containing the Tomb of Sargeras, now known as the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, was raised up from the seafloor by &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href=\"The%20Broken%20Isles%20%28WC3%20NightElf%29\"&gt;battle&lt;/a&gt; was fought there between &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Watchers\"&gt;Watchers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Illidan%27s%20Naga\"&gt;Illidan's Naga&lt;/a&gt;. Several years later, the &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;alternate Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; was sent by the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; to act as their ambassador to the Nightborne and their &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magistrix%20Elisande\"&gt;Grand Magistrix&lt;/a&gt;, who has pledged herself and her people to the same demons she stood against in defiance of &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt; 10,000 years ago. Not all Nightborne agree with Elisande's decision, though they keep their disagreement a secret. With loyalists and demons marching together in the streets of Suramar, fear and distrust grips other elves' hearts and family turns against family. The flame of the Shal'dorei flickers and heroes must arise to re-ignite it and stir the noble hearts of this once brave night elven group.\nAt some point during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Order of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; sent their troops in the region to intercept during the night a &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt; convoy containing a large shipment of &lt;a href=\"Lumenstone\"&gt;Lumenstone&lt;/a&gt;, guarded by &lt;a href=\"Warden%20Jor%27al\"&gt;Warden Jor'al&lt;/a&gt; and some &lt;a href=\"Duskwatch%20Enforcer\"&gt;Duskwatch Enforcer&lt;/a&gt;s behind the walls of &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar City&lt;/a&gt;.\nGetting there.\nSuramar is the most central region in the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;, making it naturally accessible from almost every other zone. \nRoads lead directly into the Suramar from the neighboring regions of &lt;a href=\"Azsuna\"&gt;Azsuna&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Val%27sharah\"&gt;Val'sharah&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Stormheim\"&gt;Stormheim&lt;/a&gt; from the west, northwest, and east respectively. A small mountain path even connects from the remote area of &lt;a href=\"Highmountain\"&gt;Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; far to the north near the &lt;a href=\"Moon%20Guard%20Stronghold\"&gt;Moon Guard Stronghold&lt;/a&gt;. \nThere are three separate neutral &lt;a href=\"flight%20point\"&gt;flight point&lt;/a&gt;s located throughout the zone:\nGeography.\nSuramar is an ancient land, much like the other regions of the Broken Isles. It is strewn with lush and colorful flora, covering almost every cliff and crevice. Ancient Highborne towns cover much of the landscape, now inhabited by fouler creatures. The zone is incredibly diverse, featuring many distinguishable regions.\nThe southern portion of Suramar holds its most recognizable feature, Suramar City. Almost all of the roads in Suramar lead here, as it was once the center of Highborne civilization. Another notable feature to the south is to the west of Suramar City, &lt;a href=\"Felsoul%20Hold\"&gt;Felsoul Hold&lt;/a&gt;; a rather recent addition to the zone.\nThe western portion of Suramar is a flat and grassy area, orange and red in color. It holds two large and now abandoned towns - &lt;a href=\"Falanaar\"&gt;Falanaar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ambervale\"&gt;Ambervale&lt;/a&gt;. The great Sundering had especially affected this place, collapsing much of Falanaar. A lot of the snowmelt from &lt;a href=\"Highmountain\"&gt;Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; flows through here and into the &lt;a href=\"Sundered%20Shoals\"&gt;Sundered Shoals&lt;/a&gt;. Another feature is tucked away to the northwest, &lt;a href=\"Moon%20Guard%20Stronghold\"&gt;Moon Guard Stronghold&lt;/a&gt; - built against Highmountain in a strategic manner.\nIn the northern center of Suramar one finds perhaps the most treacherous and difficult to traverse place in the zone. &lt;a href=\"Anora%20Hollow\"&gt;Anora Hollow&lt;/a&gt; is a maze-like canyon with many precarious pathways carved throughout. On top of it is the Highborne gravesite, &lt;a href=\"Tel%27anor\"&gt;Tel'anor&lt;/a&gt;. Tel'anor's city-like fabrication on the cliffs of Anora Hollow is perhaps strategic, to prevent desecration of its heroes' tombs. That hasn't stopped the harpies, though, who have invaded over half of the ruins.\nThe last major area of Suramar is the &lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Thicket\"&gt;Crimson Thicket&lt;/a&gt;, found in its easterly portion, near &lt;a href=\"Stormheim\"&gt;Stormheim&lt;/a&gt;. Like its name, the Crimson Thicket is a forest of deep red color, and massive trees. A small path from the forest leads to &lt;a href=\"Azuregale%20Bay\"&gt;Azuregale Bay&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nIn Lands of Conflict.\nSuramar was a great &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;Kaldorei&lt;/a&gt; city ten thousand years ago. Some important night elves once called this place home: &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;brothers&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;. The ruins are now a sad reminder of ancient Kaldorei folly. In the center of the ruins, the &lt;a href=\"Boughs%20of%20Azshara\"&gt;stumps of two great aspen trees&lt;/a&gt; stand side by side. It is strange, since the climate is not right for aspens; and even if a seedling did manage to grow, it would not have had time to reach the girth of these enormous stumps. As some night elves later clarified, in ancient times, a great garden stood at Suramar's center, and at the center of this garden stood the fabled &lt;a href=\"Boughs%20of%20Azshara\"&gt;Boughs of Azshara&lt;/a&gt;. Now, these petri\ufb01ed stumps are all that remain.\nAs capital of the Kaldorei.\nSuramar was the ancient &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;Kaldorei&lt;/a&gt; capital. In the time of &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt;, the religious community of Suramar was a complicated structure intimately intertwined with the &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; community and involving nearly everyone in the city. The great arcane academies of Suramar trained entire generations of &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s.\nOnce a gleaming city of polished wood and marble, of silken banners and graceful spires, Suramar was torn asunder by the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; and was being battled over during the final stages of the war. Queen Azshara and her &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; followers climbed to the heights of power when their heedless studies of magic brought the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. The Kaldorei and the &lt;a href=\"ancient\"&gt;ancient&lt;/a&gt;s were making one last attempt to prevent the Highborne from leaping over the brink of destruction. A portion of Suramar, the temple district, was located near the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;. The city was also the location of the &lt;a href=\"Azshara%27s%20Palace\"&gt;Eternal Palace&lt;/a&gt; where Queen Azshara lived.\nSpeculation.\nThe ruins of Suramar in \"The Frozen Throne\" used the \"sunken ruins\" tileset. It is never explained why the kaldorei city of Suramar has the statuary and motifs of a seaside civilization when the city was several thousand miles inland. Moreover, the distance between Suramar and Zin-Azshari (in the War of the Ancients novels) was implied at being between a third to a half the distance from the Well of Eternity to Mount Hyjal, while the maps in \"The Frozen Throne\" show the Broken Isles to be close to the Maelstrom, and on the opposite side. It is implied in \"Lands of Mystery\" that the Broken Isles are being pulled towards the Maelstrom. One could say there might have been a big lake and Suramar was located on its shore.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

It is strewn with lush and colorful flora, covering almost every cliff and crevice. Ancient &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; towns cover much of the landscape, now inhabited by fouler creatures.\nSuramar is the realm of the &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt;, currently led by their First Arcanist, &lt;a href=\"Thalyssra\"&gt;Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt;, following the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20rebellion\"&gt;fall&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Elisande\"&gt;old regime&lt;/a&gt;. Its capital is &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar City&lt;/a&gt;, almost all of the roads in Suramar lead here.\nHistory.\nWar of the Ancients.\nThe &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; brought with it a great deal of change, both for the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; race and Elisande's Highborne. Through a desire for greater power, &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; in the capital of &lt;a href=\"Zin-Azshari\"&gt;Zin-Azshari&lt;/a&gt; allied themselves with the &lt;a href=\"demon%20lord\"&gt;demon lord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Having aided in the creation of a portal for the Legion to reach Azeroth, the queen and her retainers watched as the demons began spread across the kaldorei nation, destroying all they encountered.\nAlthough Elisande and her Highborne associates in Suramar remained loyal to Queen Azshara, they became increasingly troubled as the Legion's invasion continued. Looking to the vast destruction caused by the demons, Elisande grew to deeply distrust them, fearing that their actions were not in the night elves' best interests. Eventually, she discovered that the Legion planned to create a large gateway to the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; within Suramar itself. Elisande was horrified at this development; if the portal were opened, innumerable demon reinforcements would spill into Azeroth and quickly overwhelm the &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Resistance\"&gt;Kaldorei Resistance&lt;/a&gt; that was attempting to withstand the Legion's onslaught. It was Elisande's belief that the gateway would also destroy the city and its inhabitants in the process, and resolved to act.\nSuramar was the location of the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Temple of Elune&lt;/a&gt;, the central place of worship for the night elves. The high priestess of &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt; lived in the temple. The &lt;a href=\"Boughs%20of%20Azshara\"&gt;Boughs of Azshara&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Izal-Shurah\"&gt;Izal-Shurah&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arauk-Nashal\"&gt;Arauk-Nashal&lt;/a&gt; were also located here.\nJust before the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Broxigar\"&gt;Broxigar&lt;/a&gt; was held captive in &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar City&lt;/a&gt; until he was freed by &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;. During the war, the Legion's efforts in the city were led by the &lt;a href=\"pit%20lord\"&gt;pit lord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ronokon\"&gt;Ronokon&lt;/a&gt;. The city was attacked and ravaged by the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Suramar was subsequently used by the &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt; in an experiment to create an army of the undead, an experiment which laid the groundwork for the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; ten thousand years later. The Burning Legion attempted to open a second portal besides the one at the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; in the Temple of Elune in order to attack the night elves on two fronts. The resident &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; used the &lt;a href=\"Pillars%20of%20Creation\"&gt;Pillars of Creation&lt;/a&gt; to close the portal and put several seals on the temple. The &lt;a href=\"Wild%20God\"&gt;Wild God&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ashamane\"&gt;Ashamane&lt;/a&gt; battled Ronokon in &lt;a href=\"Val%27sharah\"&gt;Val'sharah&lt;/a&gt; just outside Suramar and sacrificed her life to kill him. In doing so, she was able to buy the elves the time they needed to craft a shield around their city.\nMost of Suramar was blasted to the bottom of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Sundering&lt;/a&gt;. However, some of it remained above shore in the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt; due to the efforts of the resident &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt;, who crafted a magical shield that kept a section of their city together. This shield would stay up for 10,000 years, as the Highborne believed the world outside of &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar City&lt;/a&gt; had been destroyed. Under their shield they would evolve into the &lt;a href=\"Nightborne\"&gt;Nightborne&lt;/a&gt;, reliant on their source of power, the &lt;a href=\"Nightwell\"&gt;Nightwell&lt;/a&gt;. While the city was shielded, it was next to impossible for normal Nightborne to leave, though some illegally did through skillful navigation or by forced exile. Much later, dwarves recovered a &lt;a href=\"Highborne%20Astrolabe\"&gt;Highborne Astrolabe&lt;/a&gt; from the undersea ruins of Suramar.\nThe sunk &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Temple of Elune&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar City&lt;/a&gt; was later used by the &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt; to hold the &lt;a href=\"Avatar%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;physical remains&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jeweled%20Scepter%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Jeweled Scepter&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Eye&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, which led to the building's more familiar designation, the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;.\nTwilight of Suramar.\nSeveral years later, the &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;alternate Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; was sent by the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; to act as their ambassador to the Nightborne and their &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magistrix%20Elisande\"&gt;Grand Magistrix&lt;/a&gt;, who has pledged herself and her people to the same demons she stood against in defiance of &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt; 10,000 years ago. Not all Nightborne agree with Elisande's decision, though they keep their disagreement a secret. With loyalists and demons marching together in the streets of Suramar, fear and distrust grips other elves' hearts and family turns against family. The flame of the Shal'dorei flickers and heroes must arise to re-ignite it and stir the noble hearts of these once brave night elven group.\nThe rebellion.\nThe rebellion was formed in opposition to the Grand Magistrix's decision to allow the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; access to &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar City&lt;/a&gt; and the sacred &lt;a href=\"Nightwell\"&gt;Nightwell&lt;/a&gt; in exchange for sparing the lives of the city's denizens.\nAlthough small initially, the rebellion began to grow in numbers and power due to both outside assistance in the form of &lt;a href=\"Class%20Order\"&gt;class orders&lt;/a&gt;, and the callous policies of Elisande. The movement was based from the underground complex of &lt;a href=\"Shal%27Aran\"&gt;Shal'Aran&lt;/a&gt; in western &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt;, and was in open conflict with the Grand Magistrix's larger forces based out of Suramar City.\nThe insurgents' ultimate goal was the overthrow of Elisande's regime, and the expulsion of all demonic forces from the city. The rebels largely used covert tactics, working to weaken the regime in Suramar from within while gaining the support of the city's populace.\nHaving secured immense gains, and enlisting the aid of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;, the rebels eventually launched an assault on the city itself, and even succeeded in laying siege to the &lt;a href=\"Nighthold\"&gt;Nighthold&lt;/a&gt;, Elisande's seat of power and location of the Nightwell. With their allies in tow, the Nightfallen staged a final assault on the citadel, seeking to end the Burning Legion's grip on Suramar permanently. Within the Nighthold, they would defeat both Elisande and , gaining full control of Suramar and finally liberating the nightborne people.\nShortly after the victory in the Nighthold, &lt;a href=\"Thalyssra\"&gt;Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt; returned to the palace to deal with the urgent question of what to do with the &lt;a href=\"Nightwell\"&gt;Nightwell&lt;/a&gt;. Accompanied by &lt;a href=\"Oculeth\"&gt;Oculeth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Valtrois\"&gt;Valtrois&lt;/a&gt;, the First Arcanist would discover that the font of power was unstable, and dying without the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Aman%27Thul\"&gt;Eye of Aman'Thul&lt;/a&gt;.\nValtrois would suggest stabilizing the Nightwell, allowing the nightborne to harness its powers once more though they were no longer addicted to them. Ultimately, however, Thalyssra decided to allow the font to die, arguing that the Nightwell belonged in Suramar's troubled past and that the future and destiny of the nightborne now lay instead with &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Witnessing the decision, &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; were satisfied by the outcome.\nIn the wake of the devastation wrought by the conflict, Thalyssra and the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Nightfallen&lt;/a&gt; established a new government over &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar City&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Nighthold\"&gt;Nighthold&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Dusk%20Lily\"&gt;Dusk Lily&lt;/a&gt; of the rebellion would become the insignia of the now-liberated nightborne race, marking a new chapter in Suramar's history.\nA group of &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s led by &lt;a href=\"Nighthuntress%20Syrenne\"&gt;Nighthuntress Syrenne&lt;/a&gt; joined the &lt;a href=\"Unseen%20Path\"&gt;Unseen Path&lt;/a&gt;.\nReformations.\nThe Legion invasion hugely changed the political scene of Suramar. With the fall of the old regime, many political decisions were made to fill the voids left.\nNew alliances.\nSince the joint elven effort to oust the Burning Legion, Thalyssra has maintained good relations with the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; through her positive interactions with &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt;, and from this has established an alliance between Suramar and &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;. Liadrin's Horde allies can be seen assisting in Suramar's rebuilding efforts.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; summoned the Horde's leaders to seek out new allies, Liadrin suggested the nightborne; Sylvanas, intrigued by what Suramar's strength and resources could bring to the Horde, approved. Liadrin and the Horde champion then travel to Thalyssra's estate to offer the first arcanist a formal invitation to &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt; on behalf of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;' ruler, &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;. While there, Liadrin and Thalyssra discuss the advantages of membership in the Horde. One of several pertinent factors for Thalyssra is to ensure her people enjoy the freedom to affect the world while upholding their traditions, which she feels is not offered by the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. Thalyssra further reflects on her comparatively sour relations with &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"kaldorei\"&gt;kaldorei&lt;/a&gt;, who while natural allies to her people on the surface, proved otherwise due to \"arrogance and mistrust.\" The first arcanist conjures a brief reenactment of her exchange with Tyrande during the events leading up to the siege of Suramar to illustrate such, and then readily accepts the invitation to Silvermoon and hopes to inquire about a place for the nightborne in the Horde.\nAccompanied by Valtrois and Silgryn, Thalyssra meets the regent lord of Quel'Thalas in his palace; she and Lor'themar quickly take to one another, each insisting that friends call one another by their first names. Lor'themar then leads the nightborne retinue to the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;, and Thalyssra observes its properties, contrasting it to the &lt;a href=\"Nightwell\"&gt;Nightwell&lt;/a&gt;. During the visit, Lor'themar's other guest, &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, inadvertently draws a group of &lt;a href=\"void\"&gt;void&lt;/a&gt; beasts to the Sunwell, who overwhelm the plateau's guardians and attempt to corrupt it. Thalyssra, Valtrois, and Silgryn join the battle, and the first arcanist adds her magical strength to that of Alleria and &lt;a href=\"Rommath\"&gt;Rommath&lt;/a&gt; to close a huge rift portal looming above the Sunwell.\nIn the battle's aftermath, Thalyssra, impressed by the regent's dedication to his people and seeing that the Horde has allowed the sin'dorei to uphold their own ancient traditions, formally pledges the allegiance of Suramar to the Horde.\nNotable leaders.\nNoble houses of Suramar.\nThe true nobility that saw the night elves secure their city from the Legion in the War of the Ancients is not totally absent from this great civilization even today with demons walking the streets freely. While there are some noble houses amongst the nightborne who support the cause against the Legion, albeit in secret and operate more sincerely and above board in their dealings with each other; there are others to contend with who use fear and coercion as their tools, and so requiring stronger responses.\nThe harp is favored by the aristocracy, a somewhat delicate instrument.\nSpeculation.\nWhether Grand Magistrix is the official title held by the kingdom's leader is unclear, as Thalyssra did not assume it after deposing Elisande; she retains her old title of First Arcanist even as Suramar's head of state. Elisande was also referred to as the nightborne queen by Thalyssra, in the vein of other Highborne rulers who bore monarchical titles, although this has not been mentioned since."}

The bay serves as the structural foundation for the &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt; city of &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt;, which is built along its coastline as well as out into the bay itself. Directly opposite the bay sits the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt; island chain, and the bay leads into, and is surrounded by, the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt;. It exists as one of the largest of its kind on the Broken Isles.\nBridges and other structures stretch across the bay, upon which a great deal of the city itself is built, including the &lt;a href=\"Nighthold\"&gt;Nighthold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Astravar%20Harbor\"&gt;Astravar Harbor&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Evermoon%20Commons\"&gt;Evermoon Commons&lt;/a&gt; district. Were all structures intact, a series of bridges would have spanned the entirety of the bay and reach &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;the temple of Elune&lt;/a&gt; on the opposite bank; the bridge extending from the Nighthold to the temple, however, was apparently destroyed with the raising of the city's shield.\nThe bay is consistently utilised by nightborne society, presumably for transport and recreational purposes, with Astravar Harbor housing a large number of the city's water-going vessels. Despite this, the nightborne maintain no war vessels to speak of in the bay, due to its relative isolation under Suramar's shield.\nHistory.\nThe bay was formed during the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt; of the ancient continent of &lt;a href=\"Old%20Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; following the conclusion of the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;. Just before the war's end and the ensuing sundering, however, Suramar City was enclosed by a powerful magical shield, which also eventually encapsulated a large portion of the bay. Thus, Suramar Bay (as it presumably became known) was cut off from the remainder of the world for over 10,000 years along with the &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt; race itself.\nWith the onset of the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the ancient shield around Suramar City was lifted, also reopening external access to the surrounding bay. During the resulting &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20rebellion\"&gt;Nightfallen rebellion&lt;/a&gt; among the nightborne people, intense fighting began to break out in and around Suramar Bay, with the Nighthold (located far into the bay itself) acting as the primary objective of the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Nightfallen insurgents&lt;/a&gt; and their allies.\nAs the conflict progressed, the bay was used for the transport of many commodities such as &lt;a href=\"arcwine\"&gt;arcwine&lt;/a&gt; (and at times even live captives) throughout Suramar City and beyond."}

Though not as glorious as the capital of &lt;a href=\"Zin-Azshari\"&gt;Zin-Azshari&lt;/a&gt;, Suramar was nevertheless one of the largest and most important cities of the ancient &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Empire\"&gt;Kaldorei Empire&lt;/a&gt;, which ruled over the majority of pre-&lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Sundering&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor%20%28landmass%29\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. The city was notably home to several important night elves including the Stormrage twins, &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion&lt;/a&gt;; priestess &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;; and siblings &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jarod%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Jarod Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe city was heavily involved in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, serving as the home of the powerful &lt;a href=\"Moon%20Guard\"&gt;Moon Guard&lt;/a&gt;, and eventually being ravaged by the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; as they pushed back the &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Resistance\"&gt;Kaldorei Resistance&lt;/a&gt;. When the Legion attempted to create a second, large gateway in the city, the resident &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; struck out and prevented it, proceeding to craft a powerful shield to preserve their city from further harm, through the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Nightwell\"&gt;Nightwell&lt;/a&gt;. During the ensuing &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt; which marked the conclusion of the war, much of Suramar was blasted to the depths of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt;, although a sizable portion remained. \nFor 10,000 years Suramar, now isolated on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt; and secured in the protection of its shield, remained cut off from the rest of the world; its residents gradually evolving into the &lt;a href=\"Nightborne\"&gt;Nightborne&lt;/a&gt; as a result of the Nightwell's energies. Upon the Burning Legion's return during their third attempt to invade &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, however, the warlock threatened them with destruction unless they allied with the demons. In an attempt to preserve her city and her people Suramar's leader, &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magistrix%20Elisande\"&gt;Grand Magistrix Elisande&lt;/a&gt;, accepted the demons' ultimatum, lowering their ancient shield and allowing the Legion into the city.\nNow Suramar has become an unstable place, as the arrival of the Legion sparks dissent among many of its citizens. The city has subsequently become a focal point for much of the conflict that currently ravages the Broken Isles in the wake of the Burning Legion's invasion.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Duskwatch\"&gt;Duskwatch&lt;/a&gt; are the primary body responsible for maintaining law and order in the city.\nHistory.\nBearing the same name as the region of &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt;, this ancient night elven city has endured for the last 10,000 years since the Sundering under the diligent stewardship of its night elven citizens, now known as the Nightborne. The city used to be protected by the &lt;a href=\"Guard%20of%20Suramar\"&gt;Guard of Suramar&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt some point, Suramar gifted to its sister city &lt;a href=\"Zin-Azshari\"&gt;Zin-Azshari&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Javelins%20of%20Suramar\"&gt;Javelins of Suramar&lt;/a&gt;, the most powerful weapons of the city, which could pierce any barrier, even one made by &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt; herself. \nJust before the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Broxigar\"&gt;Broxigar&lt;/a&gt; was held captive in Suramar City until he was freed by &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;. During the war, the Legion's efforts in the city were led by the &lt;a href=\"pit%20lord\"&gt;pit lord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ronokon\"&gt;Ronokon&lt;/a&gt;. The city was attacked and ravaged by the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Suramar was subsequently used by the &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt; in an experiment to create an army of the undead, an experiment which laid the groundwork for the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; ten thousand years later. The Burning Legion attempted to open a second portal besides the one at the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; in the Temple of Elune in order to attack the night elves on two fronts. The local Highborne and their leader &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magistrix%20Elisande\"&gt;Grand Magistrix Elisande&lt;/a&gt;, used the &lt;a href=\"Pillars%20of%20Creation\"&gt;Pillars of Creation&lt;/a&gt; to close the portal and to put several seals on the temple. The &lt;a href=\"Wild%20God\"&gt;Wild God&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ashamane\"&gt;Ashamane&lt;/a&gt; battled Ronokon in &lt;a href=\"Val%27sharah\"&gt;Val'sharah&lt;/a&gt; just outside Suramar and sacrificed her life to kill him. In doing so, she was able to buy the elves the time they needed to craft a shield around their city.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, the resident &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; crafted a magical shield to protect a portion of their city from the destruction. They used the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Aman%27thul\"&gt;Eye of Aman'thul&lt;/a&gt; to create a powerful font of magical power called the &lt;a href=\"Nightwell\"&gt;Nightwell&lt;/a&gt;. For 10,000 years, the Highborne believed the world outside of Suramar City had been destroyed. These &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; would continue mastering and perfecting their art and over time evolve a little further into the &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt;. While the city was shielded, it was next to impossible for normal Nightborne to leave, though some illegally did through skillful navigation or by forced exile.\nWhen the city faced starvation, their source of power, the Nightwell, would become more than just a font for magical spells and works, it became the principal source of nourishment in place of the exhausted food supplies. Over the long millennia of isolation, cut off from the land, the Nightborne would become addicted to the Nightwell, which in turn had a dire effect on those unable to access the nourishing energy produced from it in the form of &lt;a href=\"Arcwine\"&gt;Arcwine&lt;/a&gt;. Crimes in the city were punished by exile, and thus those exiled would suffer a horrible fate. The addictive effect withers the body without arcwine to sustain it, causing it to be unable to be sustained by anything but the energy provided in the Nightwell. Exile would deny any access to Arcwine and lead to starvation and deterioration leading to regression into &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen\"&gt;Nightfallen&lt;/a&gt; and ultimately, the fully mindless state of the &lt;a href=\"Withered\"&gt;Withered&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt some point in time before the present day, a construct named the &lt;a href=\"Arm%20of%20the%20Magistrix\"&gt;Arm of the Magistrix&lt;/a&gt; was conceived and built, the most powerful one ever attempted. The power it held in one pinky finger alone could level half of the &lt;a href=\"Nighthold\"&gt;palace&lt;/a&gt;. It ended up raging out of control and decimated an entire district before it was successfully disabled, then was stored away somewhere.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;alternate Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; came to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, he ripped open the seals in place at the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; re-opening the gateway for the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt; to pour through. The barrier that had protected the city and its &lt;a href=\"Nightborne\"&gt;Nightborne&lt;/a&gt; citizens came down with the removal of the seals. The &lt;a href=\"Nightborne\"&gt;Nightborne&lt;/a&gt; would soon discover the fate of the exiles when issued an ultimatum to their leader of joining the Legion, or being destroyed. Seeing no choice, &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magistrix%20Elisande\"&gt;Grand Magistrix Elisande&lt;/a&gt; chose to join in hopes of using &lt;a href=\"Nightwell\"&gt;the nightwell&lt;/a&gt;, albeit in a very different way, to save her people. Those who oppose her are exiled and the fear of exile is being used to keep the rest of the populace in line.\nA Nightborne resistance has formed composed of Nightborne and &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen\"&gt;Nightfallen&lt;/a&gt; along with some &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elven&lt;/a&gt; survivors from the surrounding regions. They wish to stir the populace into action and bring Elisande to justice in addition to driving out the Legion from their city. Heroes are enlisted in the effort and play a pivotal role in the zone's campaign which is ultimately to defeat Gul'dan and deny the Legion access to the powerful font of Arcane energy.\nThe city has now been pacified and has joined the ranks of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocation.\nPrior to the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, the city of Suramar was located in the mid-east of the ancient continent of &lt;a href=\"Old%20Kalimdor\"&gt;Old Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. One of the greatest cities in the &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Empire\"&gt;Kaldorei Empire&lt;/a&gt;, Suramar was almost certainly the largest east of the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; and the capital of &lt;a href=\"Zin-Azshari\"&gt;Zin-Azshari&lt;/a&gt;. In a more magical sense, the city was also strategically positioned on top of a series of &lt;a href=\"ley%20line\"&gt;ley line&lt;/a&gt;s, which were exploited to great effect and relied on heavily by the city's inhabitants before the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Nightwell\"&gt;Nightwell&lt;/a&gt;. \nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt; which tore Old Kalimdor apart, Suramar City found itself isolated on a small landmass in the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt;. This landmass\u2014the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;\u2014was among several surviving pieces of ancient Kalimdor which now formed new continents in their own right. On the Broken Isles, Suramar occupies a central position, lying along its southern coastline.\nGeography.\nLayout.\nPrior to the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, Suramar was a large city encompassing both the territory of the modern urban area and of the island of &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Thal'dranath&lt;/a&gt;, which notably featured the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Temple of Elune&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the wake of the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, Suramar City now consists of a series of concentric layers extending from a short distance inland into &lt;a href=\"Astravar%20Harbor\"&gt;Astravar Harbor&lt;/a&gt;. The outer layer, serving as the city's furthest point inland, is mostly composed of gardens, estates, and sporadic accommodation. The next and largest layer, on a lower tier to the first, comprises the vast majority of Suramar's residential and mercantile sectors, and is situated mostly on land, with parts extending into the bay. Finally, the very inner layer generally consists of the &lt;a href=\"Nighthold\"&gt;Nighthold&lt;/a&gt; (seat of the city's leaders) and several other gardens.\nLaid out on two major tiers, Suramar is also divided into numerous distinct districts. Furthest inland (working northeastwards from the south) there is the &lt;a href=\"Lunastre%20Estate\"&gt;Lunastre Estate&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Promenade\"&gt;Grand Promenade&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Menagerie%20%28Suramar%29\"&gt;Menagerie&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Vineyards\"&gt;Twilight Vineyards&lt;/a&gt;. The large lower, central area of the city is mainly divided into the &lt;a href=\"Starcaller%20Retreat\"&gt;Starcaller Retreat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Evermoon%20Commons\"&gt;Evermoon Commons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Concourse%20of%20Destiny\"&gt;Concourse of Destiny&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Midnight%20Court\"&gt;Midnight Court&lt;/a&gt; districts. In the very center of the city lies Astravar Harbor, which also lies on the large bridge extending to the city's most detached area: the Nighthold."}

By reducing mana consumption, SoL can reduce the priest's (and often therefore the group's) downtime, due to a reduced need for mana breaks. When soloing \u2013 provided &lt;a href=\"Smite\"&gt;Smite&lt;/a&gt; is being regularly used \u2013 Surge of Light can often provide all healing required by the priest, so conserving mana for offensive spells, as well as reducing downtime.\nIn PvP, Surge of Light can be very useful due to its instant cast capability, offering emergency burst healing and preventing &lt;a href=\"interrupt\"&gt;interrupt&lt;/a&gt; effects.\nHowever, as Surge of Light doesn't increase Flash Heal's healing per second (HPS), it is not always advisable to consume the buff immediately. Particularly in high-pressure situations where healing throughput is more important than efficiency, it may be better to prioritize abilities with higher HPS over SoL-boosted Flash Heal. This is most apparent in situations where multi-target healing is desired, as &lt;a href=\"Flash%20Heal\"&gt;Flash Heal&lt;/a&gt; can only heal a single target, but can also affect single-target healing. Its 10 sec duration allows for a few heals to be cast in-between without losing the buff entirely.\nThose concerned with their overall HPS may wish to examine the contribution of these free heals and balance them against their other options."}

Because of that, he refers to the Hidden's master as the &lt;a href=\"arakkoa\"&gt;arakkoa&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ssarbik\"&gt;Ssarbik&lt;/a&gt;'s master.\nMembers.\nFormer members.\nDuring the course of their journey, the following members of the Hidden chose to abandon Malus.\nGordunni.\nWith Malus killing their &lt;a href=\"King%20Gordok\"&gt;King Gordok&lt;/a&gt; and becoming the new king, the &lt;a href=\"Gordunni\"&gt;Gordunni&lt;/a&gt; clan based in &lt;a href=\"Dire%20Maul\"&gt;Dire Maul&lt;/a&gt; were proclaimed to be no more as they were Hidden now. However, they still retained their Gordunni identity.\n&lt;a href=\"Gordok%27s%20Elite\"&gt;Gordok's Elite&lt;/a&gt; was a force of the best ogres chosen from the clan to serve Malus.\nOnce the business with Aram was done, Malus lied to the &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"mercenary\"&gt;mercenary&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Throgg\"&gt;Throgg&lt;/a&gt; and told him he would stop being the king of the ogres and they would return to Dire Maul. However, he retained his title but eventually betrayed them when he sacrificed several to the &lt;a href=\"Darkstorm\"&gt;Darkstorm&lt;/a&gt;. Ultimately, Malus died, and the Gordunni returned to Feralas and Dire Maul. &lt;a href=\"Zekhan\"&gt;Zekhan&lt;/a&gt; later confirmed that Malus was no longer holding the Gordok title."}

The guild is currently led by &lt;a href=\"Hulfdan%20Blackbeard\"&gt;Hulfdan Blackbeard&lt;/a&gt;, and was once investigated by agents of &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;King Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; who arrested several of its members. During the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, Hulfdan Blackbeard and a few members of the organization joined the ranks of the &lt;a href=\"Uncrowned\"&gt;Uncrowned&lt;/a&gt;.\nTheir members are in charge of &lt;a href=\"rogue%20trainer\"&gt;training&lt;/a&gt; the apprentice thieves in Ironforge.

When the guild discovered that &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;King Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; had exhausted the quarries by extracting all their iron ore and gems, amassing more wealth than a dwarf could amass in ten lifetimes, the thieves decided to come up with a plan to steal some of his treasure. Their agent &lt;a href=\"Onin%20MacHammar\"&gt;Onin MacHammar&lt;/a&gt; was therefore sent to spy on the mining activities across &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Morogh\"&gt;Dun Morogh&lt;/a&gt;, while the newly recruited adventurer was ordered to get his situation report in time. With the help of his contacts in the east, the agent reported the precise path taken by the armored &lt;a href=\"steam%20tank\"&gt;steam tank&lt;/a&gt;s that transported the mineral resources from &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;. Satisfied with the progress of their plans, Hulfdan rewarded the new recruit with a dagger, before telling them that the organization would contact them later for phase III of the operation.\nAfter being stolen, &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Jorach%20Ravenholdt\"&gt;Lord Jorach Ravenholdt&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Assassin%27s%20League\"&gt;Assassin's League&lt;/a&gt; requested a promising rogue adventurer through his contact with Hulfdan, in order to retrieve his &lt;a href=\"Sealed%20Azure%20Bag\"&gt;Sealed Azure Bag&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt some point, Hulfdan searched everywhere for the rogue adventurer, fearing that they also have been put in irons by the soldiers of King Magni Bronzebeard. After &lt;a href=\"Hogral%20Bakkan\"&gt;Hogral Bakkan&lt;/a&gt; redirected them to Ironforge, Hulfan explained that they were discussing phase III of their heist when the guards arrived and arrested some members of the organization, with the motive of stopping their plans. As the adventurer's name came up during the interrogations, Hulfdan ordered them to leave the city and visit &lt;a href=\"Renzik%20%22The%20Shiv%22\"&gt;Renzik \"The Shiv\"&lt;/a&gt;, his contact in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, a few members of the Hidden Circle joined the ranks of the &lt;a href=\"Uncrowned\"&gt;Uncrowned&lt;/a&gt; in their war against the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s.

Some of those loyal to me brought word immediately that the caverns below Orgrimmar were in disarray now that their leaders have been slain. I even heard reports that Neeru was more than agitated.

{"id": "657315", "revid": "42014766", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=657315", "title": "Hidden citadel", "text": "The Hidden citadel is a vast fortress of the &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Xaraax\"&gt;Highlord Xaraax&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Hidden\"&gt;Hidden&lt;/a&gt;, bearing its moniker. It is inhabited by &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"arakkoa\"&gt;arakkoa&lt;/a&gt; alike.\n&lt;a href=\"Malus\"&gt;Malus&lt;/a&gt;, too reliant on the arakkoa support to go anywhere devoid of arakkoa strongholds, was stationed in the great arakkoa citadel south of &lt;a href=\"Falcon%20Watch\"&gt;Falcon Watch&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;. Both of them were searching for the &lt;a href=\"Diamond%20Blade\"&gt;Diamond Blade&lt;/a&gt; and its &lt;a href=\"Voice%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; in order to unleash the &lt;a href=\"Darkstorm\"&gt;Darkstorm&lt;/a&gt; upon &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nHidden by hills, it is divided into a lower section and an upper section. The big castle's upper section contains a &lt;a href=\"prison\"&gt;prison&lt;/a&gt;, and it looked like a series of caves, being laid out in concentric rings of brambles and stone, rising higher and higher, ending in a black gate that guarded the entrance to the highest ring which contained a cavernous chamber, the vaunted sanctuary of Xaraax, a twisted rock chamber as tall as a cathedral, with gold and green lights casting shadows along the thin windows. Behind his throne and altar stood the balcony. The altar was a stone base for a purple mass of liquid shadows, moving and whispering dark secrets of the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere are also a war room and a chamber for Malus which had a &lt;a href=\"portal\"&gt;portal&lt;/a&gt; with its other side containing Malus' items. In the center there is a massive, open-air fortress, the ceiling made up entirely of tightly knit brambles and branches. Arakkoa and demon nests dotted the palace, the armies of Xaraax practiced their torture methods in the rotunda below. According to the &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Throgg\"&gt;Throgg&lt;/a&gt;, it smelled of &lt;a href=\"bird\"&gt;bird&lt;/a&gt; droppings and sulfur from the demonic pits below. It has several entrances.\nIts denizens counted &lt;a href=\"imp\"&gt;imp&lt;/a&gt;s (at least one female), &lt;a href=\"felhound\"&gt;felhound&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"shivarra\"&gt;shivarra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"felguard\"&gt;felguard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jailer%20%28demon%29\"&gt;jailer&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"felbat\"&gt;felbat&lt;/a&gt;s.\nHistory.\nAt some point after the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, Malus on the \"&lt;a href=\"Inevitable\"&gt;Inevitable&lt;/a&gt;\" attacked and destroyed the \"&lt;a href=\"Wavestrider\"&gt;Wavestrider&lt;/a&gt;\", taking its captain, his own brother, &lt;a href=\"Greydon%20Thorne\"&gt;Greydon Thorne&lt;/a&gt; captive. He imprisoned him in the stronghold's prison, holding and torturing him for nearly two months.\nAfter Malus became King Gordok, leader of the &lt;a href=\"Gordunni\"&gt;Gordunni&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s and established &lt;a href=\"Gordok%27s%20Elite\"&gt;Gordok's Elite&lt;/a&gt;, he told &lt;a href=\"Ssarbik\"&gt;Ssarbik&lt;/a&gt; to open a portal to the citadel in order to reach his ship, the \"Inevitable\", sailing to &lt;a href=\"Gadgetzan\"&gt;Gadgetzan&lt;/a&gt;. However, the two remained in the citadel for almost a week, before getting to the \"Inevitable\".\nA few weeks later, Malus managed to capture &lt;a href=\"Aramar%20Thorne\"&gt;Aramar Thorne&lt;/a&gt; as well, putting him in a cell next to his father. Afterward, Malus remained here and was guarded by a dozen Gordunni ogres. Later, Throgg hurried to tell him that an arakkoa &lt;a href=\"scout\"&gt;scout&lt;/a&gt; witnessed an army marching on the citadel. The demons and arakkoa began battling the &lt;a href=\"Woodpaw%20clan\"&gt;Woodpaw&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Feral%20Scar\"&gt;Feral Scar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"yeti\"&gt;yeti&lt;/a&gt;s in front of the citadel. Eventually, &lt;a href=\"Makasa%20Flintwill\"&gt;Makasa Flintwill&lt;/a&gt;'s main companions signaled the &lt;a href=\"Everstill%20murlocs\"&gt;Everstill murlocs&lt;/a&gt; who swarmed the demons in the citadel. They were soon joined by &lt;a href=\"One-Eye\"&gt;One-Eye&lt;/a&gt; and her &lt;a href=\"wyvern\"&gt;wyvern&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Elmarine\"&gt;Elmarine&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Telagos\"&gt;Telagos&lt;/a&gt; who used his frost &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;, summoning a cone of frost that hardened, sealing off demons from retreating, and making it difficult for enemies to leave the citadel. Makasa, &lt;a href=\"Murky%20%28Traveler%29\"&gt;Murky&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hackle\"&gt;Hackle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Galena%20Stormspear\"&gt;Galena&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Reigol%20Valdread\"&gt;Reigol Valdread&lt;/a&gt; then continued inside, with Makasa and Reigol hurrying to deal with Malus while the others found and freed Greydon and Aram.\nIn the meantime, Malus came to Xaraax to his sanctuary, but the nathrezim &lt;a href=\"demon%20lord\"&gt;demon lord&lt;/a&gt; turned on him and attacked because he ran out of its usefulness. He took the hilt of the Diamond Blade from his body and proceeded to get the Hidden to the top of the citadel. There, Makasa and Reigol made their way and fought against Throgg and &lt;a href=\"Karrga\"&gt;Karrga&lt;/a&gt; but lost. The two ogres dragged the family into the chamber behind them where Xaraax and the Hidden awaited them. &lt;a href=\"Zathra\"&gt;Zathra&lt;/a&gt; approached Makasa to retrieve the blade. As she took it, she quickly dropped it because it was too hot for her. Soon, the hilt from the demon lord's hands soared to the blade, the weapon reforging itself and becoming whole. A shocked Throgg dropped Makasa who leaped at the weapon. With the weapon and &lt;a href=\"Voice%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Voice of the Light&lt;/a&gt; in her hands and head, she charged at Xaraax. The Highlord, however, had a weapon on his own, a &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; sword matched the Diamond Blade, knocking it from Makasa's hands. Immediately, Ssarbik enveloped her with &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20%28magic%29\"&gt;shadow magic&lt;/a&gt;, and Xaraax went to drop his fel blade and grab the Diamond Blade. He corrupted the hilt, and the dark power started to creep upon the blade.\nXaraax, preparing to destroy the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; and release the &lt;a href=\"Darkstorm\"&gt;Darkstorm&lt;/a&gt; upon Azeroth, did not expect that the broken Malus would hurry to take the dropped fel sword and stab Xaraax into his back and through his chest. Losing the Diamond Blade, Malus tossed the impaled dreadlord into the altar that swallowed the Highlord, hoping it would send him into the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;. Malus kept the demon blade and ordered Ssarbik to summon him ogres and &lt;a href=\"imp\"&gt;imp&lt;/a&gt;s to feed the Darkstorm while they will wait for Greydon to feed it. Throgg shouted in protest, but the fel-corrupted Malus ignored him. Soon, the Gordunni in shadowy shackles were brought to Malus by a &lt;a href=\"Jailer%20%28demon%29\"&gt;jailer&lt;/a&gt;. A portal, the swirling vortex of the Darkstorm, emerged and sucked them and the imps, stunning Karrga in shock. She had been holding Valdread, but now the Forsaken slipped her and kicked the Diamond Blade towards Makasa. She quickly grabbed the weapon of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; and blocked Malus' attack. The twisted &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; now called reinforcements and continued fighting. As fel and Light clashed, the roof exploded, the black vortex of the Darkstorm growing quiet for a moment.\nAt that moment, the freed Aram and the other friends managed to get to the chamber, witnessing a great battle against the Hidden and &lt;a href=\"felbat\"&gt;felbat&lt;/a&gt; demons. Karrga and Throgg turned on their former colleagues, fighting against the winged demons, with Telagos joining in as well. Aram found Makasa's former weapons and gave them to Greydon to fight. Zathra and her &lt;a href=\"scorpid\"&gt;scorpid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Skitter%20%28scorpid%29\"&gt;Skitter&lt;/a&gt; faced Greydon and Hackle - as Skitter was about to sting the gnoll, Thorne warned him, allowing Hackle to dodge the attack, but, ironically, the scorpid hit the &lt;a href=\"Farraki%20tribe\"&gt;Sandfury&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"sand%20troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; who succumbed to the poison immediately. Reigol threw a small dagger at Malus but soon redirected his target at Ssarbik, enacting his revenge upon his enemy by throwing a dagger into the arakkoa's heart. His sister, &lt;a href=\"Ssavra\"&gt;Ssavra&lt;/a&gt; tried to flee the chamber but was stopped by Galena's magic that rooted her.\nSoon, the tide turned in favor of the &lt;a href=\"child\"&gt;child&lt;/a&gt;ren, defeating most of the Hidden and the demons. The two &lt;a href=\"Thorne\"&gt;Thorne&lt;/a&gt; brothers faced each other, with Malus almost gaining the upper hand, but ultimately it was Makasa with her Diamond Harpoon, and with the assistance from Aram, that ultimately faced Malus - the defeated Malus gathered his last strength to toss his fel sword at Makasa, but Aram used his new-found &lt;a href=\"Nature\"&gt;druidic&lt;/a&gt; power to blast the blade away, giving Makasa the opening to leap and strike Malus fatally. The roiling black vortex that was the Darkstorm raged for a moment before it dissipated completely. With that, the Azerothians noticed Karrga and Throgg leaving together, and they let them. On their way out, Throgg whacked Ssavra, and she shrieked and clawed at the thorny roots holding her. Down below them, triumphant horns sounded when the enemies in the citadel's valley were defeated. With most felbats also defeated, the rest of the winged demons fled from the citadel at their master's demise. The Thornes, Makasa, and the others then left the citadel as well."}

While she is a mage, she is notably attired in the warlock's &lt;a href=\"tier%204\"&gt;tier 4&lt;/a&gt; set &lt;a href=\"Voidheart%20Raiment\"&gt;Voidheart Raiment&lt;/a&gt;, likely due to the fact that she transforms into a massive &lt;a href=\"voidwalker\"&gt;voidwalker&lt;/a&gt; towards the end of her fight.\nAbilities.\nPhase One: High Astromancer Solarian.\nIn the \"\" encounter, Solarian uses her original (classic) abilities during phase one. She also has her original 4,552,500 health pool (nearly twice the value of her health after &lt;a href=\"patch%202.1.0\"&gt;patch 2.1.0&lt;/a&gt;).\nPhase Two: Solarium Reinforcements.\nEvery 50 seconds Solarian disappears, summons 12 non-elite agents, and returns in 15 seconds with two elite priests.\nLevel 69 - 70, ~28,000-30,000 health.\nLevel 72 Elite, 54,243 health.\nPhase Three: Solarian Transformation.\nAt 20% health, High Astromancer Solarian transforms into a massive Voidwalker, increasing her armor and replacing her arcane abilities with shadow. Adds are no longer summoned when this phase begins.\nStrategy.\nThe strategy outlined below is for the reworked version of this encounter, and should not be used for the \"\" encounter.\nRaid composition and gear.\nSince most of the damage dealt to the raid is arcane, some arcane resistance will help. It's a good idea if everybody brings their &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Badge\"&gt;Violet Badge&lt;/a&gt;. Players should not &lt;a href=\"nerf\"&gt;nerf&lt;/a&gt; themselves to obtain high amounts of resistance though.\nMelee damage dealers are very effective as Solarian cannot dodge while she is continuously casting spells. During the adds phase, the tanks have to control 15 mobs, thus strong &lt;a href=\"AoE\"&gt;AoE&lt;/a&gt; tanking is required. A good paladin tank can be quite valuable here.\nPhase One.\nDuring this phase, all ranged classes (healers and damage dealers) should stand close together on one spot. This makes it easier for people with the bomb debuff to get clear of everyone else, and AoE heals are more effective. During this phase and up until phase Three, she has no aggro table.\nThis is the main reason for wipes here. In irregular intervals, Solarian casts this debuff on a random raid member. The affected player immediately deals continuous AoE damage to others for 6 seconds, and then explodes. The AoE damage is a fixed amount, distributed evenly to all targets in range (thus if many raid members are close, they take only low damage). The explosion deals 5400-6600 arcane damage to everyone in a 10 yard radius, and throws everybody affected by it high enough into the air for about 90% falling damage. Upon landing, the person with the debuff is protected against falling damage, while everybody else is usually killed. Raid members receiving the debuff must immediately get clear from all other raid members. This is the single most important aspect of this fight. \nSince &lt;a href=\"Patch%202.3.0\"&gt;Patch 2.3.0&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cloak%20of%20Shadows\"&gt;Cloak of Shadows&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Shield\"&gt;Divine Shield&lt;/a&gt; no longer trigger the explosion instantly, so using these abilities is perfectly safe.\nMost of the time, Solarian busies herself with spamming Arcane Missiles. Since they deal a substantial amount of damage, it's important that healers react quickly when a raid member is about to receive it. 2-3 healers should be dedicated to the task of keeping the arcane missile targets up. They can set up a macro to cast a quick heal on Solarians current target. It's rather risky to use slow heals here.\nShamans should keep up four totems at all times, since the arcane missiles do target them, and pop &lt;a href=\"Heroism\"&gt;Heroism&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Bloodlust\"&gt;Bloodlust&lt;/a&gt; early.\nPhase Two.\nEvery 50 seconds, Solarian disappears and 12-15 non-elite adds spawn from three \"light portals\". After 15 seconds, she re-appears together with two elite priest adds, and Phase 1 starts again.\nDuring the 15 seconds of phase 2, the whole raid should concentrate in the center of the room, and start all-out AoE. People need to be very quick here, because Solarian starts her usual phase 1 routine right after she reappears.\nThis need for high speed puts the AoE damage dealers at a high risk - they cannot allow a lot of time for the tanks to build aggro (but still need to do so, else they'll die right away).\nAfter 15 seconds, Solarian and two priest adds spawn from the beams of light. It's possible to determine from which beam the boss spawns - it's the one which is exactly on the circular border, whereas the two other beams which are not exactly aligned with the border spawn priests.\nThe priest adds will begin casting either Holy Smite or a healing spell on themselves or Solarian. Two tank+rogue groups can split off on the priest adds and have the tank handle the damage from Holy Smites while the rogue uses &lt;a href=\"Kick\"&gt;Kick&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Kidney%20Shot\"&gt;Kidney Shot&lt;/a&gt; on any upcoming heals.\nPhase Three.\nWhen Solarians health hits 20%, the fight turns into a simple \"tank and spank\" style combat (even if only a few raid members are alive the fight is usually won at this stage). She turns into a massive armored voidwalker and stops all of her former attacks. In that form, she has substantially increased armor, an void bolt attack and fears people in melee range. This fear can be avoided by the usual measures (&lt;a href=\"Fear%20Ward\"&gt;Fear Ward&lt;/a&gt;, stance dance, tremor totem).\nQuotes.\nSound files.\nSee \"&lt;a href=\"PlaySoundFile%20macros%20-%20Outland%20instance%20sounds%23.C2.A0High%20Astromancer%20Solarian\"&gt;Sound files of Tempest Keep: High Astromancer Solarian&lt;/a&gt;\"\nIn Hearthstone.\nSolarian appears as for the mage class in the \"\" expansion for \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\". Upon death, she shuffles back into the player's deck as , depicting her as she appears when transformed into a &lt;a href=\"voidwalker\"&gt;voidwalker&lt;/a&gt;. Solarian's flavor text reads: \"\"Loyal to &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;, this blood elf mage sought arcane power in the Void. Did she find it... or did IT find her?\"\""}

He appears to be a &lt;a href=\"herbalist\"&gt;herbalist&lt;/a&gt; and is probably in charge of the experiments the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; are conducting on the plants in the Botanica. It seems he at some point had time to write a comprehensive botany guide; &lt;a href=\"Botanist%27s%20Field%20Guide\"&gt;Botanist's Field Guide&lt;/a&gt;.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"Mere minutes after entering the Botanica, Freywinn began conducting reckless experiments in order to unlock the power hidden among the native plant life of Outland.\"\nSpells and abilities.\nPlant Seedling.\nHigh Botanist Freywinn plants a seedling every 5 seconds which sprouts into a blue, green, red or white seedling.\nNature's Will.\nHigh Botanist Freywinn transforms into a tree, begins to cast Tranquility and calls upon 3 Frayer Protectors to defend him.\nFight.\nOnce engaged, Freywinn spawns a small seedling elemental every few seconds. The seedlings have a low amount of health (~750) and need to be killed in order to avoid their special abilities, which vary based on their color: short freeze (white), direct damage (red), root (green). Allocate one DPS to deal with them. Anyone with good burst damage can do the job.\nAbout every 30 seconds, he will transform into a treant (much like a druid's &lt;a href=\"Tree%20of%20Life%20Form\"&gt;Tree of Life Form&lt;/a&gt;), spawn three lashers, and start channeling &lt;a href=\"Tranquility\"&gt;Tranquility&lt;/a&gt;, which heals himself and the lashers. When Freywinn is in treant form, he is invulnerable and will keep channeling &lt;a href=\"Tranquility\"&gt;Tranquility&lt;/a&gt;. The Lashers also deal a thrown \"Thorn\" attack that hits for around 800-1000 damage. Only when all the three lashers are dead he will stop channeling Tranquility and return to the normal blood elf form.\nNOTE: This fight can go on indefinitely if Freywinn is allowed to continue to heal himself with the lashers. Kill them as fast as possible. \nThere are several strategies to deal with the treant form phase:\nLine of sight strategy.\nThe easiest strategy is to have the WHOLE group (including healer and ranged DPS!) to move immediately out of line of sight of the lashers when they spawn. This is easily done by tanking the boss on the bridge during normal blood elf phase, and everyone run and hide behind the left corner to the bridge when he changes to treant form. If done correctly, the lashers will follow the group around the corner, out of Tranquility's range. Tank should use their AOE skills (e.g. Thunderclap, Consecration, AoE taunt, etc.) to aggro the lashers as quickly as possible. Start dps the lashers only when you are sure they are out of Tranquility. Damage dealers should target tank's target to reduce the chance of pulling aggro. When all three lashers are dead, the tank should run back to the boss and pull him back to the bridge. DPS can resume attacking the boss when the tank has grabbed aggro.\nGroups that fail to use this method may have made the following mistakes:\nFear strategy.\nFor those who failed with the above strategy, you can try fearing the lashers when they spawn, if you have a warrior, priest or warlock. Fear caused the adds to get out of Tranq range very quickly. DPS the lashers down one by one then.\nFocus fire strategy.\nFor groups that cannot perform the line-of-sight strategy properly, and do not have fear, it is possible to kill the lashers one at a time even when they are within Tranq range, if all DPS focus on one target at a time. It is vital to kill the lashers quickly, thereby preventing the Botanist from healing himself out of control. Therefore, this strategy requires good DPS and the ability for everyone to focus on one target.

The Overlord forces Cliffwalker to watch as a goblin hot-air balloon, carrying a bomb specifically intended for wiping out Thal'darah Grove, completes its ghastly mission; the grove is left as little more than a smoking crater.\nAt that point, Warchief &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; arrives from &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, having learned of Krom'gar's dishonorable tactics. Sickened by the Overlord's actions, Garrosh \"dismisses\" Krom'gar from service by dropping him from the edge of Cliffwalker Post to his death. When the Warchief turns to the player, preparing to do the same, Cliffwalker intercedes, setting the facts straight on the player's involvement and begs the Warchief to show mercy. Garrosh, surprised that the chieftain would ask for such a thing after the murder of his mate and son and the destruction of his home, relents, and spares the player's life.\nCliffwalker then proclaimed that he will lay Masha to rest and stay by the crater to begin its healing.\nQuotes.\nWell met.\nSpeculation.\nInterestingly enough, the title High Chieftain is used by the (united) &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"taunka\"&gt;taunka&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20tauren\"&gt;Highmountain tauren&lt;/a&gt; tribe main leaders such as &lt;a href=\"Cairne\"&gt;Cairne&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Roanauk%20Icemist\"&gt;Roanauk Icemist&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mayla%20Highmountain\"&gt;Mayla Highmountain&lt;/a&gt;.

Abbendis hoped that Pureblood would survive and rally the survivors.\nShortly before the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Battle for Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; sent his forces to counter the anticipated Scarlet army from &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt; and Hearthglen, and Pureblood's legions were defeated by the death knights. Nothing is known of the High Commander's fate."}

He is the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; version of &lt;a href=\"Great-father%20Winter\"&gt;Great-father Winter&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nThe term \"Winter Veil\" is said to stem from a supernatural being referred in many cultures to as Greatfather Winter. As he would walk the land late in the seasons, winter itself would be his billowing cloak. In his wake was the blanketing of the land in snow, and thus it is said that Greatfather Winter would cast his wintry veil over the land. As Greatfather Winter walked Azeroth, it is said he would provide a bounty for those who welcomed his presence. Though parts of Azeroth may lie in snow, it gives the land time for rebirth and renewal. As such, the idea of feasting during the winter veil would bring together communities as they shared whatever they had. Typically, a single day of merriment and feasting welcomed the change, all in anticipation of the land's renewal. \nThe image of Greatfather Winter is sometimes used, as a harbinger of commercial exploit rather than as a supernatural titan. Greatfather Winter visits the great cities of Ironforge and Orgrimmar - courtesy of the fine folks of Smokywood Pastures and he spreads cheer in celebration for the Feast of Winter Veil. But, all the cheer-spreading makes Greatfather Winter hungry, and he looks for adventurers to get him his daily fix of milk and cookies.&lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/events/winterveil/\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\nGreatfather Winter is now seen as a kind old &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarf&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;, who brings presents to everyone. Although many people, such as lorekeepers, have their thoughts about this commercializing of him by the &lt;a href=\"Smokywood%20Pastures\"&gt;Jinglepocket&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s, it is a nice idea nonetheless.\nI Got What Yule Need.\nDuring one Winter Veil celebration, he got drunk and had to be replaced by the goblin &lt;a href=\"Krizz\"&gt;Krizz&lt;/a&gt;. He would also be involved (if not drunk) in Dark Iron's plans as having traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20Airfield\"&gt;Ironforge Airfield&lt;/a&gt; and using Reindeer Dust on a giant robot that would take presents for delivery. However, in those gifts were treasures from the vaults of &lt;a href=\"Explorers%27%20League\"&gt;Explorers' League&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Treasury\"&gt;Royal Treasury&lt;/a&gt; stolen by the Dark Irons. Thanks to Krizz, the plan was foiled.\nAt the end of the story, a being who is presumably the real Greatfather Winter watches the Winter Veil festivities of people across Azeroth. He appears ethereal, as if he is made out of the blowing snow around him.\nQuotes.\nA wondrous Winter Veil to you... uh... little girl. Good children get special, um, discounts at any local Smokywood Pastures vendor. Yum.\nIn the RPG.\nDwarves have a winter festival where they tell stories about Greatfather Winter; in recent years, more and more humans have been participating in this event.\nSpeculation.\nIt is possible that &lt;a href=\"Hodir\"&gt;Hodir&lt;/a&gt; is the original Greatfather Winter (which goblins later commercialized) as he has been referred as \"father figure\" (see &lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Hodir\"&gt;Sons of Hodir&lt;/a&gt;) and connected to ice and snow. He also refers to the veil of winter in &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt; and previously resided in the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Winter\"&gt;Temple of Winter&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, since it appears that the story of Greatfather Winter started with the dwarves and since the dwarves are descended from cursed &lt;a href=\"Earthen\"&gt;Earthen&lt;/a&gt; (see &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Flesh\"&gt;Curse of Flesh&lt;/a&gt;), one could argue that the Greatfather Winter story is just passing the story of Hodir to future generations with small changes over time erasing his name.\nGreatfather Winter may alternatively be somehow related to &lt;a href=\"Ardenweald\"&gt;Ardenweald&lt;/a&gt;. Ardenweald is an afterlife containing the power of rebirth, just as Greatfather Winter is said to cast snow across the world that in turn brings rebirth and renewal. Moreover, Ardenweald is associated with autumn and winter and is led by the &lt;a href=\"Winter%20Queen\"&gt;Winter Queen&lt;/a&gt;."}

Formerly of the &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20clan\"&gt;Frostwolf clan&lt;/a&gt;, she was the mate of one chieftain (&lt;a href=\"Garad\"&gt;Garad&lt;/a&gt;), the mother of another (&lt;a href=\"Durotan\"&gt;Durotan&lt;/a&gt;), and the grandmother of the previous &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nLegends: A Warrior Made 1.\nGeyah was present at the showing of newly-born &lt;a href=\"Draka\"&gt;Draka&lt;/a&gt;. She told young &lt;a href=\"Durotan\"&gt;Durotan&lt;/a&gt; to give Draka a blessing.\nLords of War.\nLong before the opening of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, Geyah would hunt &lt;a href=\"clefthoof\"&gt;clefthoof&lt;/a&gt; along with the other members of her clan. One time, she was bitten by a &lt;a href=\"drift%20lurker\"&gt;drift lurker&lt;/a&gt; which caused her to enter a deep sleep. While her middle son, &lt;a href=\"Ga%27nar\"&gt;Ga'nar&lt;/a&gt;, wanted to leave her, Durotan didn't. After Ga'nar left, Durotan and her companion, &lt;a href=\"Stormfang\"&gt;Stormfang&lt;/a&gt; remained and tended to her for several days. At some point a pack of &lt;a href=\"garn\"&gt;garn&lt;/a&gt; attacked. She awoke only to see Durotan lost in &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Fury\"&gt;bloodlust&lt;/a&gt;. When she spoke to him, he found out he also killed Stormfang. She told him she would rather die than to know that her son had become a beast.\nThe red pox.\nIn the years before the rise of the Horde, a virulent plague known as the &lt;a href=\"red%20pox\"&gt;red pox&lt;/a&gt; spread throughout the clans. Geyah, rather than abandon the afflicted, established a quarantined settlement in the region of Nagrand, hoping to care for the victims while limiting exposure. She named it &lt;a href=\"Garadar\"&gt;Garadar&lt;/a&gt;, after her late husband. Among Geyah's patients were the children of several chieftains, including &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jorin%20Deadeye\"&gt;Jorin Deadeye&lt;/a&gt;. As the clans gave the settlement a wide berth, the orcs therein were not forced into joining the Horde or the blood pact with &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt;. From afar, Geyah watched in disgust as the brown skin of the Horde turned a sickly green and once-verdant lands died. However, Geyah and those in the village, sickened though they were, remained \"Mag'har\", uncorrupted.\nAfter the Frostwolf clan was exiled, Durotan and Draka visited Geyah and Draka told her that she was pregnant. Durotan added he would be named as Go'el.\nBefore &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; crossed the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, he had Geyah and the other elders of Garadar hide his son &lt;a href=\"Dranosh%20Saurfang\"&gt;Dranosh&lt;/a&gt; away so the orcish warlocks would not find him, due to a promise made to his mate before her death.\nShortly before &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;'s destruction, Geyah was visited by &lt;a href=\"Kargath%20Bladefist\"&gt;Kargath Bladefist&lt;/a&gt;, who had stumbled upon the village by accident and demanded that every able-bodied warrior come to his aid in assisting Ner'zhul's nefarious plans. Geyah, naturally, refused to aid her corrupted brethren, not that she could have anyway, as most of the village was still suffering from the Red Pox.\nGeyah has taken the role of a clan mother and thus &lt;a href=\"Kashur\"&gt;Kashur&lt;/a&gt; speaks to her in her dreams.\nGo'el's return.\nAfter completing a large series of quests in Nagrand players are sent to Geyah to help communicate with the spirits of the land and heal them. Once this quest line is complete she will converse with the player about Garrosh and his fitness to lead. She will state the player reminds her of her son Durotan. Upon hearing this name your conversation will then tell her of Durotar and of the leader of the horde, Durotan's son, Thrall.\nAfter the Mag'har joined the new Horde, Geyah instructs the player to \"go to my grandchild\", Warchief &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, and inform him \"his blood is here \u2014 in this shattered world\", and that \"his father's legacy lives on.\" Thrall sends the player back to her, to \"tell her that her grandson comes\".\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20the%20Mag%27har%23Transcript%20from%20final%20cutscene\"&gt;cutscene&lt;/a&gt; of his visit to &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt;, Thrall sat down with the Greatmother and she revealed the name his parents intended to give him - Go'el.\nThe Shattering: Prelude to Cataclysm.\nJust before the &lt;a href=\"Shattering\"&gt;Shattering&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, Thrall, hoping to save Azeroth, returned to Garadar to learn more of the ways of the elements from Geyah. Geyah, being advanced in years, instead instructed &lt;a href=\"Aggra\"&gt;Aggra&lt;/a&gt;, one of her students, with the task of teaching her grandson. Aggra expressed her disapproval of Geyah's decision, as she considered Thrall to be a traitor with a \"horrid slave name\". Geyah mused that she assigned Aggra the task for no other reason that it would amuse her to see the two interact with each other.\nAfter some time spent in the company of both Aggra and Geyah, Thrall asked his grandmother why she put up with Aggra's sharp tongue and disrespect, and Geyah responded that she would be a fool to surround herself with people who did not challenge her way of thinking. Geyah then played a minor role in Thrall's vision quest and looked on as Thrall and Aggra came to care for each other.\nQuotes.\nHello, young &lt;race&gt;.\nAlternate timelines.\nAn alternate &lt;a href=\"Greatmother%20Geyah%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Geyah&lt;/a&gt; is present in the alternate in the past during the &lt;a href=\"war%20in%20Draenor\"&gt;war in Draenor&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Geyah%20%28film%20universe%29\"&gt;Geyah&lt;/a&gt; from a separate timeline appears in the &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20film%20universe\"&gt;movie continuity&lt;/a&gt;."}

Recently, the &lt;a href=\"Grimtotem%20tribe\"&gt;Grimtotem tribe&lt;/a&gt; has attacked and destroyed the tauren loyal to the Horde in the region, burning &lt;a href=\"Camp%20Aparaje\"&gt;Camp Aparaje&lt;/a&gt; to the ground and murdering most of the inhabitants. Horde agents have been sending &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s into the vale to assault the Grimtotems there.\nIn the Stonetalon Mountains, the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; entered an alliance of convenience with the tauren of &lt;a href=\"Grimtotem%20Post\"&gt;Grimtotem Post&lt;/a&gt;. The Alliance was forced to agree to supply the Grimtotem there with weapons in exchange for protection from the Horde and free reign to move freely through their territory. Together, the Grimtotem and the Alliance beat back the Horde and slay four of the Horde's most fearsome generals at the battle for Greatwood Vale.\nIn the RPG.\nThis vale is one of the primary sources of &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; activity in the &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. Two separate tauren villages are found here, the &lt;a href=\"Grimtotem%20Village\"&gt;Grimtotem Village&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Camp%20Aparaje\"&gt;Camp Aparaje&lt;/a&gt;. Both are inhabited by the &lt;a href=\"Grimtotem\"&gt;Grimtotem&lt;/a&gt; tauren, a tribe of dissidents who do not share &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;'s ideals of uniting the clans and instead focus on seeking retribution for the wrongs imposed on them in recent history. This approach is not popular enough to gain the support of the more numerous tauren in the &lt;a href=\"Sun%20Rock%20Retreat\"&gt;Sun Rock Retreat&lt;/a&gt;, but nevertheless the Grimtotem tribe has been successful in their initial attempts to \"cleanse\" the other races from the land."}

{"id": "229083", "revid": "34702620", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=229083", "title": "Frost Wyrm (Warcraft III)", "text": "In ages past, the ancient &lt;a href=\"Dragon\"&gt;Dragon&lt;/a&gt;s who were near death flew to the land of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; to die. To this day there are entire Dragon graveyards that are littered with massive petrified bones and skulls. When &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; took control of Northrend, he used his powerful magics to raise the ancient Dragon skeletons from the dead. Now the skeletal Dragons radiate cold power and think of nothing other than serving their dark master. Frost Wyrms have a cold-based breath weapon that can do shattering damage to enemies both on the ground and in the air. \nInformation.\nFrost Wyrms are one of the ultimate Undead units. Frost Wyrms are similar to &lt;a href=\"Chimaera%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Chimaera&lt;/a&gt;s in terms of damage, but they attack much slower and are also capable of attacking air units. Only their ground attacks cause splash damage - the air attack does not. \nFrost Wyrms are a late-stage Undead unit and it can take quite a bit of work to build up to them, because an Undead economy is fairly slow at the start, along with both the Frost Wyrms and the Boneyards they come from costing a hefty amount of gold. If the player's aim is to quickly produce Frost Wyrms, it's recommended to scour the map of creep camps and quickly set up expansions to harvest additional gold. The wood generally comes from a Goblin Shredder. If necessary, defensive towers around your base and expansions can help.\nBeing &lt;a href=\"Blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;undead blue dragons&lt;/a&gt;, Frost Wyrms still possess their former dragonflight's chilly breath, and units hit by them are slowed significantly in both their attack rate and movement speed. Like dragons, it also has a splash effect, though it does not work against aerial units.\nFrost Wyrms may learn the Freezing Breath ability which causes their attacks to literally freeze enemy buildings. Frozen buildings act as if they are stunned - they cannot attack, and any actions it is performing is halted until thawed. One Frost Wyrm coupled with Bloodlust or Unholy Frenzy is generally enough to keep the building continually frozen. Though this doesn't make them essential building killers, as they run within defensive tower ranges and only deal magic damage, which does greatly reduced damage to buildings. They're there to keep the towers off of your units who are busy destroying them. \nAs a heavy aerial unit, Frost Wyrms are extremely slow despite their massive health pool. Night Elf and Undead players can use &lt;a href=\"Hippogryph%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Hippogryph&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Gargoyle%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Gargoyle&lt;/a&gt;s are generally the strongest counter, because they can deal a heavy amount of damage, have enough health to take several hits and can also hunt down any fleeing wyrms. Human players can use &lt;a href=\"Dragonhawk%20Rider%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Dragonhawk Rider&lt;/a&gt;s, as they can easily wrangle a Frost Wyrm down with Aerial Shackles. Orc players, unfortunately, don't have much in the way of taking Frost Wyrms down other than focused fire with &lt;a href=\"Wind%20Rider%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Wind Rider&lt;/a&gt;s, since it takes three &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Batrider%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Troll Batrider&lt;/a&gt;s to kill a single Frost Wyrm.\nOn the ground, &lt;a href=\"Dryad%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Dryad&lt;/a&gt;s are the strongest counter due to their passive spell immunity which also makes them immune to magic-type attacks. &lt;a href=\"Siege%20Engine%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Siege Engine&lt;/a&gt;s are another alternative but require Endurance and Unholy Aura to catch up to them, but will greatly assist in taking out any Gargoyle escorts.\nSpells and abilities.\nFreezing Breath (Passive).\nThis upgrade is must have because it allows you to assault enemy towns and towers."}

The two types do not get along, and the only thing they hate more than anything else is each other. The creature is seemingly humanoid, but rides on a ball of blue-colored energy rather than walking on two feet. A frost revenant wears flowing dark blue robes under scale mail armor and carries a heavy mace and large metal shield emblazoned with a single white-colored image of an eyeball. Etched into the shield, radiating from the eye out to the shield's edges, are yellow beams. The eye sockets of the creature's metallic helm shines with a menacing, brilliant white light. Its arms appear to be ice crystals held together by blue energy.\nFrost revenants are just as territorial, though they tolerate the presence of other cold-based creatures and even enjoy the presence of &lt;a href=\"ice%20revenants\"&gt;ice revenants&lt;/a&gt;. Otherwise, frost revenants attack all intruders on sight, though they are much more patient and calculating in their methods. They may not be very intelligent, but they know how to fight. It's pretty much the only thing they do know well. Frost revenants work better in packs more than any other type of revenant. They coordinate the use of their blizzard spells to maximize damage on the weakest, less agile foes. They prefer to retreat when confronted, and continue casting blizzard from range. Once solidly engaged in melee, a frost revenant is quick to begin hammering foes with its mace.\nKnown.\nThe only known frost revenant found in the \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" is the &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Warder\"&gt;Frost Warder&lt;/a&gt;s found in &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20Archavon\"&gt;Vault of Archavon&lt;/a&gt;.

They hope to \"accept the Lich King's gift\" and be transformed into &lt;a href=\"val%27kyr\"&gt;val'kyr&lt;/a&gt;. Those who are judged worthy here by the Lich King will become Val'kyr.

Vargul are a more standard form of undead.\nIt is unknown if all, or any, ymirjar were frost vrykul to begin with, or gain that form upon undeath. Non-frost vrykul, such as &lt;a href=\"Halfdan%20the%20Ice-Hearted\"&gt;Halfdan the Ice-Hearted&lt;/a&gt;, are \"judged\" by the Val'kyr, but are not shown to change into anything.\nThough the ymirjar seem to serve the Lich King exclusively, the hyldnir serve Thorim and believe those live in Valkyrion are traitors.

These reanimated vessels of destruction do not fear death; they dispense it.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; killed &lt;a href=\"storm%20drake\"&gt;storm drake&lt;/a&gt;s in order to raise them as frost wyrms, including the powerful &lt;a href=\"Daumyr\"&gt;Daumyr&lt;/a&gt;.

The powerful &lt;a href=\"red%20dragon\"&gt;red dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kyranastrasz\"&gt;Kyranastrasz&lt;/a&gt; was also found and raised by the Ebon Blade.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, another &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href=\"Danir%20Emberlight\"&gt;Danir Emberlight&lt;/a&gt; tried resurrecting a &lt;a href=\"green%20dragon\"&gt;green dragon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vadekius\"&gt;Vadekius&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nIn ages past, venerable dragons nearing death flew to the land of Northrend to die. To this day there are entire dragon graveyards littered with massive petrified bones and skulls. When &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;, the Lich King, took control of Northrend, he used his powerful magics to raise the ancient dragon skeletons from the dead. These skeletal dragons radiate cold power and think of nothing other than serving their dark master.\nFrost wyrms have a cold-based breath weapon that can shatter entire buildings and enemies both on the ground and in the air. They are also quite fond of devouring their hapless enemies whole. Ner'zhul's vicious frost wyrms hold the frosts of Northrend within their skeletal hearts. By inhaling a great deal of air, frost wyrms can expel blasts of freezing cold so extreme, that they pull all the moisture from the air around a building and freezes it solid. The &lt;a href=\"boneyard\"&gt;boneyard&lt;/a&gt; is the home of the frost wyrms. They have a crippling ability to cast their freezing breath onto enemy forces and buildings. In large numbers, frost wyrms present a truly dominating force.\nNecromancy and esoteric binding rituals combine to bend them to their riders' will. The most relentless of all frost wyrms are the &lt;a href=\"Frostbrood\"&gt;Frostbrood&lt;/a&gt; vanquishers, which are raised from the depths of &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt;. When it is determined that a frost wyrm died a particularly gruesome death, it is dubbed a \"&lt;a href=\"Reins%20of%20the%20Bloodbathed%20Frostbrood%20Vanquisher\"&gt;Bloodbathed Vanquisher&lt;/a&gt;\". Many believe that some frost wyrms were forced to fight their own kind for others' amusement during their early lives, giving them a particularly combative temperament in undeath.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, there was at least one frost wyrm raised by the &lt;a href=\"ghoul\"&gt;ghoul&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ichor\"&gt;Ichor&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Orb%20of%20Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Orb of Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; awoke from his long dormancy, he journeyed to &lt;a href=\"Sindragosa%27s%20Fall\"&gt;Sindragosa's Fall&lt;/a&gt; where he raised the ancient dragon &lt;a href=\"Sindragosa\"&gt;Sindragosa&lt;/a&gt;, the first consort to &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt;, as a frost wyrm. His final desecration of Sindragosa was to tear the spirits of her lost &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20whelp\"&gt;whelps&lt;/a&gt; into undeath in front of her skeletal form, as a final affront to the great dragon, and then ordered her to lead the Frostbrood into war. The Scourge reanimated a few particularly ancient and powerful &lt;a href=\"proto-dragon\"&gt;proto-dragon&lt;/a&gt;s to become members of the Frostbrood as well.\nNotable.\nFrost wyrms often receive a new name upon being raised into undeath. On occasion, however, they retain the names they had in life.\nIn the RPG.\nThese creatures have the skeletal forms of great dragons, and wicked intelligence gleams in their eyes. Now, these once-noble beasts serve Ner'zhul and seek to expand the Lich King's rapidly growing empire. They have no memories of their previous lives nor of the world beyond death. They are intelligent beings, quite capable of strategy, tactics, and deception, but they have no understanding of their past dragon heritage. They are &lt;a href=\"withered%20creature\"&gt;withered creature&lt;/a&gt;s."}
