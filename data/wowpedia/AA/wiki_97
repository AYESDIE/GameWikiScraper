In his preferred mortal guise, he is known as Kalec and appears as a &lt;a href=\"half-human\"&gt;half-human&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"half-elf\"&gt;half-elf&lt;/a&gt; with blue-black hair, a form that appeals to him because it represents a melding of two worlds, just as Kalec himself feels that he is a blend of the worlds of dragons and humans. Due to the blues being most in tune with &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; magic of all the dragonflights, Kalec has the powers of a sorcerer and the strength of a warrior. Even after losing his Aspect abilities, he is one of the greatest mages in Azeroth's present and past, with &lt;a href=\"Kinndy%20Sparkshine\"&gt;Kinndy Sparkshine&lt;/a&gt; describing him as likely being superior to any of the mages from the short-lived Azerothian races.\nPrior to the &lt;a href=\"Nexus%20War\"&gt;Nexus War&lt;/a&gt;, Kalecgos was Malygos' investigator and became involved in the search for residual energies of the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;. He opposed Malygos' war against mortal spellcasters and became the blue dragonflight's ambassador to the &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Accord\"&gt;Wyrmrest Accord&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the events of the &lt;a href=\"War%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;War against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, Kalec decided to not stand with Malygos. He allied himself with &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; and the Wyrmrest Accord to help stop his former master.\nWith the rise of &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, Kalecgos was named the new Aspect of Magic and aided his fellow Aspects and the mortal &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s in the battle with the Aspect of Death. After his defeat, the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragon\"&gt;blue dragon&lt;/a&gt;s went their separate ways; Kalec joined the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; and took up residence in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; to pursue a relationship with &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;. Though Jaina left Dalaran at the onset of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;invasion of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, Kalecgos remained, becoming a member of the &lt;a href=\"Tirisgarde\"&gt;Tirisgarde&lt;/a&gt; as well as the ruling &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Six\"&gt;Council of Six&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nKalecgos was put in charge of &lt;a href=\"Tarecgosa\"&gt;Tarecgosa&lt;/a&gt;'s protection and education when she was but a hatchling. Over the millennia, they forged a special bond. Their affinity for one another became well known within the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue flight&lt;/a&gt;.\nChronormu's visage.\nAt some point, Kalecgos' good friend, the &lt;a href=\"bronze%20dragon\"&gt;bronze dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Zidormi\"&gt;Zidormi&lt;/a&gt;, arranged for a meeting between him and &lt;a href=\"Chronormu\"&gt;Chronormu&lt;/a&gt;, who could not make up his mind on what mortal form to choose during his upcoming &lt;a href=\"Visage%20Day\"&gt;Visage Day&lt;/a&gt; ceremony. The two met in &lt;a href=\"Coldarra\"&gt;Coldarra&lt;/a&gt; and Chronormu asked how Kalecgos had chosen his mortal form. The blue surprised the bronze by revealing that his visage was that of a humble &lt;a href=\"half-elf\"&gt;half-elf&lt;/a&gt;. Kalecgos explained that while many blues chose elaborate forms, he instead wanted to be approachable and walk among mortals as a friend and equal. When Chronormu asked about his visage's blue hair, he replied \"It suits me\". Before the bronze left, Kalecgos suggested that he should think about a nickname to use in his mortal form\u2014like how Kalecgos went by \"Kalec\"\u2014and seek out the advice of someone with a different perspective on dealing with mortals.\nKalec attended Chronormu's Visage Day at &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt;, where the bronze held a speech about how he'd realized that a visage was not only about how others perceived them but about how they perceived themselves, and subsequently transformed into the female &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt; Chromie. Amidst the subsequent festivities, Kalec told Chromie that he felt that she was the one who had taught them all a lesson. When he asked why she'd chosen to become female, Chromie smiled, replied \"It suits me\", and gave him a long hug.\nThe Sunwell.\nYoung Kalecgos was sent as an investigator by Malygos to &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; to locate what appeared to be residual energies from the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;, believed to have been destroyed by the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; some time before. What he found - after being severely injured by the dwarven dragon hunter &lt;a href=\"Harkyn%20Grymstone\"&gt;Harkyn Grymstone&lt;/a&gt; and his band - was a strange young human named &lt;a href=\"Anveena%20Teague\"&gt;Anveena Teague&lt;/a&gt;, who lived with her parents outside &lt;a href=\"Tarren%20Mill\"&gt;Tarren Mill&lt;/a&gt;. As they evaded Harkyn's band of hunters as well as the occasional agent of the Scourge, Kalec and Anveena teamed up with Kalec's intended, &lt;a href=\"Tyrygosa\"&gt;Tyrygosa&lt;/a&gt;, and the human paladin &lt;a href=\"Jorad%20Mace\"&gt;Jorad Mace&lt;/a&gt;. While in Tarren Mill, they were confronted by the Scourge led by the elven traitor &lt;a href=\"Dar%27Khan%20Drathir\"&gt;Dar'Khan Drathir&lt;/a&gt;, who sought the power of the Sunwell for himself. He believed it may have been the dragonling &lt;a href=\"Raac\"&gt;Raac&lt;/a&gt;, hatched from an egg found in the ruins of Anveena's home, but later events prove this false.\nWhile seeking a way to remove Dar'Khan's enchanted collars from around his neck (which trapped him in humanoid form) and Anveena's, Kalec traveled to the Hinterlands - and in the process, battling the forces of both the Scourge and the Forsaken &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Valimar%20Mordis\"&gt;Baron Valimar Mordis&lt;/a&gt; - and it was there that he discovered that Anveena possessed great power, demonstrated by saving him from a potentially fatal fall from the cliffs below the Baron's castle. As she was trying to slow Kalec's fall, Anveena was captured by Dar'Khan, and taken to Quel'Thalas.\nKalec, Tyri, and Jorad gave chase, traveling to the ruined elven kingdom themselves and first being captured, then aided, by &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;, his lieutenant &lt;a href=\"Halduron%20Brightwing\"&gt;Halduron Brightwing&lt;/a&gt;, and their band of rangers. Kalec discovered that Anveena was, in fact, the avatar of the Sunwell, and aided in the final battle that led to Dar'Khan's defeat. Afterward, the previously-enslaved &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Korialstrasz&lt;/a&gt; - Prime Consort to &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;, the red Aspect - explained that he had created the illusion that was Anveena, in order to prevent the Scourge from obtaining her power. When Lor'themar pledged himself to keep Anveena safe, Kalec decided to remain behind as well as her protector. It is heavily implied that Kalec and Anveena became romantically involved shortly thereafter.\nNexus Point.\nWhen a group of &lt;a href=\"nether%20dragon\"&gt;nether dragon&lt;/a&gt;s attack the &lt;a href=\"Nexus\"&gt;Nexus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tyrygosa\"&gt;Tyrygosa&lt;/a&gt; contacted Kalec in a desperate try to save the home of the blue dragonflight. In the end, however, Kalec arrived too late; Malygos had awoken, and in his insanity he absorbed the nether dragons into himself.\nFury of the Sunwell.\nKalecgos, true to his word, remained Anveena's protector while she assisted the blood elves in the reconstruction of their homeland. Not long after however the traitorous Prince Kael'thas, fresh from his defeat in &lt;a href=\"Tempest%20Keep\"&gt;Tempest Keep&lt;/a&gt;, suddenly reappeared in Quel'Thalas, along with the forces of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Before Kalec could react, the Legion captured Anveena, hoping to use her to bring their master, the demonlord &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Kalecgos, along with his companion &lt;a href=\"Madrigosa\"&gt;Madrigosa&lt;/a&gt;, attempted to foil Kil'jaeden's plans, but in the process Kalecgos became possessed by the &lt;a href=\"Nathrezim\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sathrovarr%20the%20Corruptor\"&gt;Sathrovarr the Corruptor&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the Sunwell Plateau raid, the encounter with Kalecgos is on two fronts, literally. The \"physical\" front is the one players engage the blue dragon head-on, in the physical world, but soon after encountering Kalecgos, portals open up to a much darker, spiritual world called the Inner Veil, where it is found that Kalec is battling against &lt;a href=\"Sathrovarr%20the%20Corruptor\"&gt;Sathrovarr the Corruptor&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s simultaneously aided Kalec in killing Sathrovarr the Corruptor, while subduing Kalecgos' dragon form, in order to set him free.\nKalecgos later aided the adventurers in the fight against &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;, where Anveena sacrificed herself to keep the demonlord from breaking through to Azeroth.\nGrim Batol and after.\nFollowing the loss of Anveena, Kalec returned home and became brooding and depressed, finally being sent away from the Nexus on an errand to investigate Grim Batol after starting more than one fight with his fellow blues. Kalecgos was not only upset by losing Anveena, but also by his lord Malygos' more recent stance on mortals and their handling of magic, one he appears to disagree with. At Grim Batol, Kalecgos encountered the red dragon &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Korialstrasz&lt;/a&gt;. At first, Kalec's attitude towards the consort of Alexstrasza was bitter and antagonistic; he blamed Krasus for his constant interference, and particularly for giving Anveena the illusion of life knowing how it would end.\nIn Grim Batol's halls, Kalec and Krasus discovered the black dragon &lt;a href=\"Sintharia\"&gt;Sintharia&lt;/a&gt;, now known as Sinestra, creating a new flight of dragons. Working together, oftentimes begrudgingly, the two dragons with the assistance of &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vereesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Vereesa Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rom\"&gt;Rom&lt;/a&gt;, the draenei priestess &lt;a href=\"Iridi\"&gt;Iridi&lt;/a&gt;, and the nether dragon &lt;a href=\"Zzeraku\"&gt;Zzeraku&lt;/a&gt;, they overcame Sintharia and her creation, the twilight dragon &lt;a href=\"Dargonax\"&gt;Dargonax&lt;/a&gt;. Iridi perished in the final battle, and Kalec took it upon himself to return her body to &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. When asked by Krasus if Malygos would allow him to go to Outland, Kalec replied that - permitted or not - he was going anyway; to see Outland once more was Iridi's dying wish, and she deserved to be buried there.\nIt is not known where Kalecgos went after that, nor the stance he takes during the &lt;a href=\"Nexus%20War\"&gt;Nexus War&lt;/a&gt;. However, it is likely he chose to not follow Malygos' orders - his distaste for the Aspect's decision to purge all mortal spellcasters was made clear to Korialstrasz.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, Kalecgos became the ambassador of the blue dragonflight to the &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Accord\"&gt;Wyrmrest Accord&lt;/a&gt;, and appeared in Alexstrasza's chamber at &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt;, standing next to &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Itharius\"&gt;Lord Itharius&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the questline to restore &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Delar\"&gt;Quel'Delar&lt;/a&gt;, Kalec stepped forward as &lt;a href=\"Krasus\"&gt;Krasus&lt;/a&gt; spoke to the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;. He questioned the wisdom of reforging the blade, feeling that the mortals would not be powerful enough to wield it, and remembered that &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;powerful weapons&lt;/a&gt; crafted by dragonkind had been turned against them in the past. He pledged not to interfere if the mortals reforge the blade, but warned that he will keep a close watch.\nDuring their assault of &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s destroyed &lt;a href=\"Sindragosa\"&gt;Sindragosa&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Frostwing%20Halls\"&gt;Frostwing Halls&lt;/a&gt;. Rather than leave her to suffer again in some form, they took her &lt;a href=\"Crystalline%20Essence%20of%20Sindragosa\"&gt;crystalline essence&lt;/a&gt; to Kalecgos at &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt;, where she could truly be laid to rest. Upon receiving the essence, Kalec stated \"So much suffering, so much needless destruction. These have not been kind times for my brothers and sisters. But thanks to your efforts, brave adventurers, this darkened yet still noble soul may find peace at last. Rest now, Sindragosa. You are home...\"\nCataclysm era.\nAt some point Kalec relocated to &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt;, fearing that the death of &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt; was a sign of weakness on the part of the blue dragonflight, and that &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; would send agents to assassinate the rest of the flight. This held true, as the black dragonflight invaded Azshara to hunt down &lt;a href=\"Azuregos\"&gt;Azuregos&lt;/a&gt;. Kalec can be found in &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Harbor\"&gt;Bilgewater Harbor&lt;/a&gt;, where he and Azuregos &lt;a href=\"Azshara%20storyline%23Azuregos%20quest%20chain\"&gt;help low-level Horde players to repel the invasion&lt;/a&gt;.\nA Legendary Engagement.\nMeanwhile, the blue dragonflight struggled with the issue of appointing a new leader. Its members were torn between Kalecgos and &lt;a href=\"Arygos\"&gt;Arygos&lt;/a&gt;, the two likeliest successors. Arygos believed that his kind should withdraw from the world and forge a new path while Kalecgos believed that they should play an active part in the world's affairs. Ultimately, the flight agreed to meet during the &lt;a href=\"Embrace\"&gt;Embrace&lt;/a&gt; in hopes that one of them would be selected as the new Aspect.\nArygos, who was secretly allied with &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, attempted to have Kalecgos assassinated to ensure his own succession. However, his plan failed when &lt;a href=\"Tarecgosa\"&gt;Tarecgosa&lt;/a&gt; sacrificed herself to save Kalecgos, and Arygos flew off, leaving Kalecgos to become the new Blue Aspect.\nThrall: Twilight of the Aspects.\nKalecgos and Arygos were present during the meeting with Alexstrasza and Ysera in Wyrmrest Temple, when they were attacked by the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Father\"&gt;Twilight Father&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Dragonflight\"&gt;Twilight Dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;. When the sanctums exploded, killing the young inside, Kalecgos was stunned to learn that Korialstrasz was responsible for the action by using a suicide attack, who he later learned did so in order to prevent all the whelps from becoming chromatic dragons.\nBeing instructed by &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; arrived to the Nexus as the blue dragonflight was discussing on how to appoint a new aspect. Unwillingly to allow Thrall in Arygos initially ordered him killed but was forced to back down after it was revealed that Thrall had the blessing of two aspects. Unwillingly to let a \"lesser race\" to be present for the &lt;a href=\"Embrace\"&gt;Embrace&lt;/a&gt; it took the threat of Kalecgos leaving the Nexus with his followers for Arygos to relent and allow Thrall to be present. During this time Kalecgos and Thrall became friends.\nEnraged that his flight has chosen Kalecgos over himself, Arygos summoned the twilight dragonflight to assault the assembled blue dragons. Kalecgos' newfound powers proved too strong for the &lt;a href=\"twilight%20dragon\"&gt;twilight dragon&lt;/a&gt;s, however, and they retreated back to their base at &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt;. Kalecgos and the rest of the blue dragonflight pursued them, where they were met by the powerful &lt;a href=\"chromatic%20dragon\"&gt;chromatic dragon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chromatus\"&gt;Chromatus&lt;/a&gt;. This abomination proved too powerful even for the newly-empowered Blue Aspect, and Kalecgos and the surviving blues were forced to flee back to the Nexus.\nKalecgos' next battle would be alongside not only his own flight, but the red and green including their Aspects Alexstrasza and Ysera. The three Aspects led an assault at the Twilight's Hammer cult, specifically Chromatus. However Chromatus was too powerful even with the combined attacks of the three aspects, they would have surely died if not &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt; and his flight didn't show up and ordered a retreat. With little time they had, the four aspects joined hands with &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; as he led a ritual to combine the essences of the aspects, Thrall taking place as the earth-warder. The four aspects with their newfound power breathed white-gold flames at Chromatus and defeated him.\nRage of the Firelands.\nKalecgos was present at both the meeting of restoring &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt; and the wedding of &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Aggra\"&gt;Aggra&lt;/a&gt;.\nCharge of the Aspects.\nWhen discussing how to defeat Deathwing, Kalec made a comment to &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt; about needing a weapon \"like none that has come before it.\" Later, pondering these words, the &lt;a href=\"Green%20Dragonflight\"&gt;Green Aspect&lt;/a&gt; was struck with inspiration; they would use the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt; to unmake Deathwing. Kalec seized upon the idea and started work on engineering a way to turn the Dragon Soul against Deathwing, whom previously it could not harm. He theorized that use of arcane magic could modify it to work upon the Aspect of Death. Shortly afterward, Ysera and Kalecgos come up with an idea of retrieving the Dragon Soul from the past to vanquish Deathwing. After telling Alexstrasza, the Dragonqueen departs to tell Nozdormu. The aspects work out a plan which involves going to the future to defeat Murozond and open the timeways to allow them to retrieve the Dragon Soul during the War of the Ancients. The aspects then ask Thrall to wield the Dragon Soul for no dragon can use it without causing themselves harm. Thrall agrees but asks if the short-lived races can assist him. Alexstrasza agrees. Not long afterward, Kalecgos brings up the fact that the Titans blessed the aspects for a reason, to stop the Hour of Twilight, but what would become of them afterward. The aspects establish that they are intended to preserve the gifts they were given, for time, life, nature, and magic last forever.\nHour of Twilight.\nAfter the Dragon Soul was brought to the present, it had to be transported by Thrall and mortal heroes to &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt;, a place of great power connected to the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20the%20Aspects\"&gt;Chamber of the Aspects&lt;/a&gt;, where the artifact was originally imbued. Since Deathwing learned of their intent, he and his minions converged on the temple to waylay them at all costs. At Wyrmrest the Aspects infused it with their essences once again, making it more potent than it ever was. Kalecgos altered the Dragon Soul's properties so that it would affect Deathwing. But the artifact was imbued with the essences of the four Aspects and Deathwing never imparted his into it. To use the weapon to defeat him, they had to infuse it with the power of the Earth-Warder. Thrall possessed a portion - however small - of that exact thing: the essence of Azeroth itself. After the death of the twilight dragon &lt;a href=\"Ultraxion\"&gt;Ultraxion&lt;/a&gt;, Thrall unleashed the Dragon Soul upon its creator. Wounded, Deathwing fled, attempting to return to the relative safety of &lt;a href=\"Deepholm\"&gt;Deepholm&lt;/a&gt;, through the Maelstrom. Thrall, the Aspects, and the adventurers gave chase, riding a gunship after the Aspect of Death, battling his personal escort along the way.\nAfter catching up, the adventurers leapt onto &lt;a href=\"Spine%20of%20Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing's back&lt;/a&gt; and began prying the elementium plates from his back, eventually making a big enough opening for Thrall to blast Deathwing with the Dragon Soul. Deathwing was blasted out of the sky and crashed into the Maelstrom. The defenders of Azeroth briefly rejoiced at having rid themselves of the Destroyer, but Deathwing rose from the Maelstrom. Without his armor, his molten form began to mutate, granting him a form far more terrifying than before. The &lt;a href=\"Madness%20of%20Deathwing\"&gt;final battle for Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; began in earnest, until one final blow from the Demon Soul infused with the complete essence of each Aspect completely obliterated Deathwing. After the death of &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, the Aspects had fulfilled their duty, and their ancient powers had been expended in order to destroy their former brother, and thus, the remaining Aspects became mortal.\nJaina Proudmoore: Tides of War.\nSome time after Deathwing's demise, Kalec became worried about the future of the blue dragonflight as they were leaving the Nexus. There, Kalecgos looked to &lt;a href=\"Kirygosa\"&gt;Kirygosa&lt;/a&gt; for her advice, but was interrupted by &lt;a href=\"Narygos\"&gt;Narygos&lt;/a&gt; who told them that the Focusing Iris was stolen. Two days ago, Kalec and the blue dragonflight decided to move the &lt;a href=\"Focusing%20Iris\"&gt;Focusing Iris&lt;/a&gt; into the Frozen Sea, off the coast of Coldara, to protect its power, but the dragon escort was killed and the Focusing Iris taken. After Kirygosa confirmed that the escort was killed, Kalecgos went after the Iris because of his position as former Aspect. First, he visited &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt;, who sent him to the human &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; for help.\nKalecgos traveled to &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore Isle&lt;/a&gt; where Jaina and her trusted advisers were helping him to locate and acquire knowledge about the Focusing Iris. During that time, Kalecgos and Jaina became friends as they were speaking about their past. Yet their problems were compounded when news reached them of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; conquering &lt;a href=\"Northwatch%20Hold\"&gt;Northwatch Hold&lt;/a&gt; and was seeking to target Theramore next. After Kalec and Jaina discovered the spell that kept them from finding the Focusing Iris, Kalecgos set out to retrieve it. He left Theramore, telling Jaina not to go to Northwatch Hold. With his departure, Jaina realized that she was missing his presence. Kalec was following the trail of the Iris all around Kalimdor, though he was unsuccessful. He also noticed the ruins of destroyed Northwatch and the army of the Horde. Discovering that the thieves were somehow able to rapidly change the location of the Focusing Iris, he decided to return to aid Jaina and later pick up the Iris' trail when he discovers a way to keep the thieves from toying with him. Back in Theramore, he found Jaina organizing her advisers and offers his services to her in the defense of Theramore. He remained with her and listened to her conversation with Varian through a magical mirror, while staying out of the mirror's field of view to hide his presence from the king.\nThe Horde moved in to attack Theramore Isle; planning to blow it up with a massive mana bomb of unseen dimension and fueled by the power of the Focusing Iris. Kalecgos' attempts to defend the city failed, leveling the entire island. Jaina, in fury, attempted to flood &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; with a tidal wave formed from the Focusing Iris, but Kalecgos managed to calm her down where even Thrall could not.\nAfter stopping her from almost drowning an entire city, Kalec and Jaina brought the Focusing Iris to &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; for safe-keeping. The few remaining blue dragons went their separate ways, dissolving the blue dragonflight. Kalec, abolishing his previous position, stayed in Dalaran as a member of the Kirin Tor, and began a romance with Jaina.\nHowever, after a while, he saw distrust from other magi, so he often found excuses to be away from the city.\nTheramore's Fall.\nKalecgos, along with &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, are present inside the &lt;a href=\"mage%20tower\"&gt;mage tower&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Theramore%27s%20Fall\"&gt;Theramore's Fall&lt;/a&gt;. He will aid Jaina, if she is attacked by the Horde.\nDawn of the Aspects.\nAs tradition Kalecgos joined the other former aspects at the &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt; during a particular cycle of the two moons of Azeroth. However, during the meeting, Kalecgos found himself surprised with how his fellow former aspects preferred to leave the defense of Azeroth to others and grew distressed when they decided to end the Accord a month from the day. In disbelief as the others left the temple, Kalecgos took flight and as he began to leave he senses a magical artifact, which he acquired from the remains of &lt;a href=\"Galakrond\"&gt;Galakrond&lt;/a&gt;. However soon after claiming the artifact, a &lt;a href=\"Spark%20of%20Tyr\"&gt;Spark of Tyr&lt;/a&gt;, Kalecgos found himself falling into visions of the past and seeing them through Malygos' eyes.\nWhile these visions allowed him to see the beginning of the Aspects when they were &lt;a href=\"proto-dragon\"&gt;proto-dragon&lt;/a&gt;s and fought against Galakrond and the &lt;a href=\"Not-living\"&gt;Not-living&lt;/a&gt;, Kalecgos found that he would wander aimlessly in human and dragon form. Unable to separate himself from the Spark of Tyr Kalecgos decided to attune it to the Nexus in order to ensure no one else would fall prey to it. An action would put the Nexus on lockdown, which shocked Jaina Proudmoore when she tried to check in on him. As Kalecgos further witnessed the threat that Galakrond and the Not-living posed, he found himself growing increasingly mad with at one point becoming convinced he was Malygos.\nUltimately Kalecgos bore witness to the destruction to Galakrond and was subsequently freed by Jaina who discovered that the Spark of Tyr was driving Kalec mad and used her spell work to break the wards around the Nexus. With &lt;a href=\"Tyr\"&gt;Tyr&lt;/a&gt;'s artifact in hand Kalecgos called for the former Aspects to gather and used it to remind the others that they were capable of great things together even before they had their powers and that they could still do so again in this new age. Agreeing with him they decided to continue moving forward to help the world in the new age. They also revealed that they encouraged the myth about Galakrond being the father of dragons in order to prevent others from following down his dark path and swore Kalecgos to secrecy.\nWar Crimes.\nKalecgos accompanied Jaina, Vereesa and the Alliance leaders to the trial of &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;. He stayed with Jaina throughout the trial but tension grew between them as he couldn't bring himself to deal with her rancor and he felt that she was clinging to her hatred. These tensions begin to fracture their relationship until during the final days of the trial in which Jaina, finding some measure of peace, prevented Kalec from leaving and kissed him in front of everyone present renewing their faith in one another. After Garrosh's escape, chaos erupted in the arena. Kalec battled against the mad Kalecgos from an alternate timeline. Kalec defeated his crazy counterpart by saying that it was not his fault that in his world he was not able to stop Jaina from destroying Orgrimmar that erupted into total war which killed all the blue dragons and the alternative Kalecgos' Jaina. Able to convince his counterpart to listen and contemplate his words caused the Mad Kalecgos to vanish. After the battle, he quickly went to dying Jaina and watched her resurrection by &lt;a href=\"Chi-Ji\"&gt;Chi-Ji&lt;/a&gt; and they immediately hugged one another.\nLegion.\nWhile Jaina has left Dalaran, Kalec has remained and become a member of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Six\"&gt;Council of Six&lt;/a&gt;, the six rulers of the city, taking Jaina's place on the council. He first appeared as part of the Council when moving Dalaran from above Deadwind Pass to the Broken Isles. He later votes yes to re-accepting &lt;a href=\"Aethas%20Sunreaver\"&gt;Aethas Sunreaver&lt;/a&gt; back into the Kirin Tor. Kalec then joins the &lt;a href=\"Tirisgarde\"&gt;Tirisgarde&lt;/a&gt;. He sends his &lt;a href=\"Image%20of%20Kalec\"&gt;projection&lt;/a&gt; to various missions.\nKalec also directs adventurers seeking &lt;a href=\"Artifact\"&gt;weapons of power&lt;/a&gt; to now-abandoned Nexus, where the blue dragonflight locked it away after the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; entrusted it to them several years before. They discover that the &lt;a href=\"ethereal\"&gt;ethereal&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Ethereum\"&gt;Ethereum&lt;/a&gt; seek the blue dragons' artifacts to become &lt;a href=\"void\"&gt;void&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Vargoth\"&gt;Vargoth&lt;/a&gt; is revealed to have ties with the &lt;a href=\"Empyrean%20Society\"&gt;Empyrean Society&lt;/a&gt;, a group of mages researching &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt;, Kalec notes that he has seen Vargoth behaving oddly. As Vargoth has been absent for a while, the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Conjuror of the Tirisgarde&lt;/a&gt; takes a look through his room in the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Citadel\"&gt;Violet Citadel&lt;/a&gt; alongside Kalec and discovers his journal, within which they find notes about the &lt;a href=\"Nightborne%20Soulstone\"&gt;Nightborne Soulstone&lt;/a&gt;, which can channel the power of the souls captured within it.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Azsuna\"&gt;Azsuna&lt;/a&gt;, Kalecgos helps &lt;a href=\"Senegos\"&gt;Senegos&lt;/a&gt; empower adventurers' artifacts with the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Zin-Azshari\"&gt;Heart of Zin-Azshari&lt;/a&gt;.\nKalec participated in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Exodar\"&gt;Battle for the Exodar&lt;/a&gt; battling against &lt;a href=\"High%20General%20Rakeesh\"&gt;High General Rakeesh&lt;/a&gt;, alongside &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Modera\"&gt;Archmage Modera&lt;/a&gt;.\nDeaths of Chromie.\nSeeking leads on who wants her dead, &lt;a href=\"Chromie\"&gt;Chromie&lt;/a&gt; asked Kalecgos if he's noticed anything suspicious and he mentions that he has felt ley-line disturbance at the &lt;a href=\"Azure%20Dragonshrine\"&gt;Azure Dragonshrine&lt;/a&gt;.\nBefore the Storm.\nOn one late evening, Kalec walked through the streets of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;. During his stroll, Kalec recalled the events that caused his love, &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, to leave the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; and also end their relationship. Though he could have demanded an explanation or confronted her about her sudden departure, he loved and respected her enough to understand that she needed time to work through her issues. In the meantime, Kalec distracted himself with the affairs of the Kirin Tor. Though he could have traveled to see old friends like &lt;a href=\"Kirygosa\"&gt;Kirygosa&lt;/a&gt;, he wanted to remain in Dalaran in case Jaina returned. To Kalec's surprise, Jaina met with him during his visit to the &lt;a href=\"Antonidas%20Memorial\"&gt;Antonidas Memorial&lt;/a&gt;. Kalec was glad to see her and Jaina congratulated Kalec on becoming a member of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Six\"&gt;Council of Six&lt;/a&gt;. Kalec thanked her for her commendation but said he would gladly abdicate his office if she returned to Dalaran. However, Jaina refused. Though Jaina admitted she didn't know where else to go, she knew that she didn't belong in the Kirin Tor anymore. Jaina stated she didn't agree with the Kirin Tor's decision to readmit the Horde and that was the type of person the Horde has made her. As Kalec moved to comfort Jaina, Jaina confessed that she didn't like how hate has changed her but she doesn't know if she can be anything else anymore. Though her experiences have taught her what to hate and not want, she also has no idea what calms her anymore or have any positive aspirations. Jaina thinks that all she's done since &lt;a href=\"Theramore%27s%20Fall\"&gt;Theramore's Fall&lt;/a&gt; was reacting and she feels frustrated that she can't seem to get herself out of that rut. Kalec apologized for being unable to help her in her struggles but Jaina admitted that only she can help herself. Jaina told Kalec she wasn't leaving because of the vote, but rather to figure out how to be true to her own nature. Kalec told her she'll work out her issues and that she'll find that when she rediscovers herself again, he's certain she won't find anything ugly or cruel. Kalec told Jaina that peace is a noble goal for the world but it is also a noble goal for one's self. Kalec promised her that should she ever need him, he'll be there. Kalec and Jaina kissed each other goodbye before Jaina portalled herself away.\nKalecgos later sent a message to &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; about Jaina's visit to him and informed him she will be unavailable for the foreseeable future. He also noted that he believes she will be calmer and well balanced when she returns from her retreat.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"green%20dragonflight\"&gt;green dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; called for aid to protect the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; against terrible creatures of the void, Kalecgos sought to recruit &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20Heart\"&gt;Chamber of Heart&lt;/a&gt;. He remarked to them that by aiding &lt;a href=\"Merithra%20of%20the%20Dream\"&gt;Merithra of the Dream&lt;/a&gt; against this threat, she would, in turn, empower the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Azeroth\"&gt;Heart of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; with the strength of the green dragonflight.\nWith the Heart of Azeroth empowered by the powers of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black&lt;/a&gt; and green dragonflights by &lt;a href=\"Ebyssian\"&gt;Ebyssian&lt;/a&gt; and Merithra, Kalecgos was convinced that it was only a matter of time before the other dragonflights helped empower the Heart of Azeroth. Thus to that end, he reached out to the other aspects and found it odd when &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; remained silent while these powers had manifested. Fearing that she was in trouble, Kalecgos directed champions to come with him to the &lt;a href=\"Vermillion%20Redoubt\"&gt;Vermillion Redoubt&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Highlands\"&gt;Twilight Highlands&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter Kalecgos discovered that Alexstrasza and the &lt;a href=\"red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; were under attack by &lt;a href=\"twilight%20dragonflight\"&gt;twilight dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Vexiona\"&gt;Vexiona&lt;/a&gt;, he and his allies joined the fight against the twilight dragons. As the twilight dragons were beaten back, Vexiona sought to flee but was ultimately confronted outside of &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt; by Alexstrasza, Kalecgos, and the champion. During the fight, Vexiona implored Alexstrasza and Kalecgos to join her and in the face of their rejection, Vexiona trapped them in stasis. However, the champion was able to free the former aspects and subsequently forced Vexiona to flee from the battlefield. With the red dragonflight now saved Kalecgos bore witness to Alexstrasza's vow to empower the Heart of Azeroth.\nDeciding it was time to empower the Heart of Azeroth with the essence of the blue dragonflight, Kalecgos revealed to champions that the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; had discovered the &lt;a href=\"Charged%20Scale%20of%20the%20Blue%20Aspect\"&gt;Charged Scale of the Blue Aspect&lt;/a&gt; atop of the &lt;a href=\"Nexus\"&gt;Nexus&lt;/a&gt;. After champions claimed the scale, Kalecgos revealed that dragonflight trusted them with this power because they believe that the champions shall be the ones to save Azeroth. Kalecgos then joined Merithra, Alexstrasza, Ebyssian, and &lt;a href=\"Chromie\"&gt;Chromie&lt;/a&gt; in empowering the Heart of Azeroth.\nSometime after &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt; was freed, Ebonhorn nearly succumbed to its whispers and would have been killed by MOTHER without Magni's intervention. Seeking to save Ebonhorn, Magni called on heroes to venture to the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20Heart\"&gt;Chamber of Heart&lt;/a&gt;. Under the advice of Kalecgos, the hero sought out &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt; in order save Ebonhorn. Though unable to meet with Wrathion, heroes did acquire a potion of his creation that they used to save Ebonhorn.\nThe Vow Eternal.\nKalec was among those who attended the wedding of &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thalyssra\"&gt;Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt;. During the reception he was informed by &lt;a href=\"Taelia%20Fordragon\"&gt;Taelia Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina&lt;/a&gt; was unable to attend as a result of &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; dealing with pirates, he also spoke briefly spoke with &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt;. Following Wrathion's confrontation with the wedding crasher &lt;a href=\"Kurog%20Grimtotem\"&gt;Kurog Grimtotem&lt;/a&gt;, who Kalec briefly held Wrathion back from fully attacking, Kalec sought out Wrathion in order to reassure him that he was in the right. The pair then spoke with one another about their respective flights past, how neither were &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt;, and Kalec expressed regret at his decision to disband the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;. After experiencing a mysterious malaise, the pair ventured to &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt; for answers, where she informed them that the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt; had awakened.\nDragonflight.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Raszageth\"&gt;Raszageth&lt;/a&gt; was freed from her imprisonment on the &lt;a href=\"Forbidden%20Reach\"&gt;Forbidden Reach&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt; went to inform the Aspects and asked who she was. &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; explained that she was one of the &lt;a href=\"Primal%20Incarnates\"&gt;Primal Incarnates&lt;/a&gt;, ancient enemies of the Aspects from long ago who wish to wipe the world clean of the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s' \"stain\", and was now seeking to free her fellow Incarnates from their prison. After learning this information, Kalec traveled to &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt; to inform &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;, who agreed to rally the mortal races.\nKalecgos traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Azure%20Span\"&gt;Azure Span&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;, seeking to reactivate the &lt;a href=\"Azure%20Oathstone\"&gt;Azure Oathstone&lt;/a&gt;, the symbol of the blue dragons' vow to protect magic. There he met a simulacrum of &lt;a href=\"Sindragosa\"&gt;Sindragosa&lt;/a&gt;, who asked him where the rest of the flight was, and Kalec explained how the flight was disbanded and they had all gone their separate ways. After helping the local &lt;a href=\"tuskarr\"&gt;tuskarr&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Iskaara%20Tuskarr\"&gt;Iskaara tribe&lt;/a&gt; fight off the Brackenhide gnolls, then spending time with them and seeing how they celebrate the lives of the dead instead of mourning them, Kalec put out a magical call to any blue dragons who were listening to gather at the Azure Span. The dragons arrived just in time to save Kalecgos from Raszageth who had planned to destroy the Azure Span's &lt;a href=\"ley%20line\"&gt;ley line&lt;/a&gt;s, and as Kalec restored the Azure Oathstone he declared the blue dragonflight - his family - renewed.\nFollowing this, Kalecgos traveled to &lt;a href=\"Valdrakken\"&gt;Valdrakken&lt;/a&gt; within &lt;a href=\"Thaldraszus\"&gt;Thaldraszus&lt;/a&gt; in order to inform the other aspects of what had transpired. In the subsequent meeting, Kalecgos revealed that while Raszageth was fended off her storms still persisted around the &lt;a href=\"Vakthros\"&gt;Vakthros&lt;/a&gt;' tower. In return, &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; voiced her confusion on the matter as the other Primal Incarnates were not imprisoned within the &lt;a href=\"Azure%20Span\"&gt;Azure Span&lt;/a&gt; and wondered what else she could be after, turning to &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt; for insight. However, he revealed that his vision was still clouded and remarked that for all he knew, the &lt;a href=\"Primalists\"&gt;Primalists&lt;/a&gt; could be within &lt;a href=\"Valdrakken\"&gt;Valdrakken&lt;/a&gt;. Thus the aspects decided that they had to protect their home and search out any Primalists within the city. A wise precaution as &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Drine\"&gt;Captain Drine&lt;/a&gt; and the adventurer discovered that Primalists had infiltrated into the city and were seeking to create discontent against the Aspects.\nSometime later Alexstrasza decided to show their mortal allies the &lt;a href=\"%3ASilver%20Scale\"&gt;:Silver Scale&lt;/a&gt;, that &lt;a href=\"Tyr\"&gt;Tyr&lt;/a&gt; had left in their possession long ago, which served as a symbol of unity and friendship to the dragonflights. However, as she revealed to it, he noted that it pulsed with magic, which was a surprise to her and Nozdormu, who thought it was an example of the scale simply changing in their absence. However, Alexstrasza believed that their return to the Dragon Isles had awakened the scale, that Tyr had left them on the last enigma for them to investigate. Thus she directed &lt;a href=\"Watcher%20Koranos\"&gt;Watcher Koranos&lt;/a&gt; and adventurers with venturing to &lt;a href=\"Tyrhold\"&gt;Tyrhold&lt;/a&gt; for answers.\nAs the pair investigated, they ultimately awaken the magic within Tyrhold by placing the scale within and subsequently used the scale to draw out the secrets about the place. They ultimately created a spark, whose creation was felt by Kalecgos, who shared it with his fellow aspects, and the trio departed from Valdrakken to join the pair at Tyrhold. After witnessing a memory of Tyr's departure from the original five aspects, Kalecgos reflected that he didn't know about their races' history and that the scale Tyr had left behind was powerful. After Alexstrasza expressed her hope that Tyr would be proud of their accomplishments and that \"dragonkind thrives\", the group would be stunned when the spark reacted to that statement and revealed a message from Tyr directing them to reactivate the forge within Tyrhold, while revealing that the Silver Scale was the key. Following this deed being done, the silver scale was placed within the forge, where to the shock of all present it had forged a new lifeless body of Tyr, himself. Though noting that the body didn't have the spark of life, Alexstrasza couldn't help but be overcome with gratitude that a long-lost friend had been returned to them, and expressed that they must do what they could to restore his true self.\nAfter Raszageth broke into the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20the%20Incarnates\"&gt;Vault of the Incarnates&lt;/a&gt; to free her fellow Primal Incarnates, Kalecgos, &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;, and adventurers were sent into the vault to stop her by Alexstrasza, while she and Nozdormu planned for whatever was to come. While the group was able to kill Raszageth, they were unable to prevent her from freeing her siblings, and the group was forced to flee, with Kalecgos and Khadgar immediately returning to Valdrakken. After they had shared what transpired, Nozdormu found that his vision was still clouded but sensed a dark future was coming, which causes Alexstrasza to reflect that Raszageth's reckless haste had caused her death and that the other Incarnates would not make the same mistake. Khadgar noticed that they were particularly concerned with &lt;a href=\"Iridikron\"&gt;Iridikron&lt;/a&gt;'s release over the others, causing the pair to reveal that while &lt;a href=\"Fyrakk\"&gt;Fyrakk&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vyranoth\"&gt;Vyranoth&lt;/a&gt; were loyal to the Primalists ideals, it was Iridikron who had truly devoted himself to the war, striking dark bargains to do so. However, Kalecgos rallied them together by reminding them that only together do they have a chance at victory. Thus the group vowed to move forward together as one against the Incarnates and were determined to protect Azeroth.\nEmbers of Neltharion.\nAfter the Incarnates opened the way into the &lt;a href=\"Zaralek%20Cavern\"&gt;Zaralek Cavern&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; called upon &lt;a href=\"Ebyssian\"&gt;Ebyssian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sabellian\"&gt;Sabellian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt;, and the adventurer to enter and deal with &lt;a href=\"Fyrakk\"&gt;Fyrakk&lt;/a&gt;. During this meeting, Kalecgos noticed that Alexstrasza was unsettled and remarked that it a rare to see her as such. He also stated that it was the best chance they had to continue growing their ranks and stated his belief that there were still members of the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;his flight&lt;/a&gt; out in Azeroth. He was present when the group returned and learned that Fyrakk had consumed &lt;a href=\"Shadowflame\"&gt;Shadowflame&lt;/a&gt; and bore witness to Alexstrasza initially barring the black dragonflight from returning, unwillingly to risk losing them, before Ebyssian convinced her that they had the strength to resist what lies below.\nMeanwhile, as he continued to search for the remaining members of the flight, he and Alexstrasza had decided the time to come to put the essences of &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sindragosa\"&gt;Sindragosa&lt;/a&gt; to rest at the &lt;a href=\"Veiled%20Ossuary\"&gt;Veiled Ossuary&lt;/a&gt;, and sent adventurers to help &lt;a href=\"Senegos\"&gt;Senegos&lt;/a&gt; in cleaning up the area beforehand. As they departed he recalled how the pair had suffered violent deaths and that putting their remaining essences to rest was the least they could do. After they arrived, Alexstrasza gave him the honor of putting them to rest, only to then witness their memories reanimate. After the memories manifested, Kalecgos found himself walking towards the last &lt;a href=\"Memory%20of%20a%20Master\"&gt;Memory of a Master&lt;/a&gt; and declared that both Malygos and Sindragosa deserves better. He and Alexstrasza left the area leaving the task of dealing with the memories to Senegos and &lt;a href=\"Stellagosa\"&gt;Stellagosa&lt;/a&gt;, while he continued the hunt for the rest of his flight. After the memories were dispelled, the pair returned to Kalec at the &lt;a href=\"Azure%20Archives\"&gt;Azure Archives&lt;/a&gt;, where more of the flight had arrived in their absence. Kalecgos further confirmed that many others had informed him of their plans to make their way to &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;the Isles&lt;/a&gt;, but was concerned that &lt;a href=\"Azuregos\"&gt;Azuregos&lt;/a&gt; had ignored all his attempts to contact him. Thus he, the simulacrum of Sindragosa (who was able to the distance due to &lt;a href=\"Azure%20Oathstone\"&gt;the oathstone&lt;/a&gt; being empowered) and adventurers traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Nexus\"&gt;Nexus&lt;/a&gt;, where they were met with a rude welcome as memories were attacking all over the place.\nAzuregos quickly pulled back and apologized to Sindragosa, while learning that she knew of him from Kalecgos. Curious as to how he had been described, Kalec revealed that he had informed Sindragosa that he was a recluse, stubborn, and prone to cutting ties with any who slight him, but trusted him to aid him into being the Aspect the blue dragons deserve. He then pointed out how he had repeatedly called him and while Azuregos may never believe in him, he stated that he needed him to believe in the flight and help them find those who were missing. Azuregos promised to do what he could and aided the group in putting down the memories that had spawned in the area. After the deed was done, Azuregos revealed that he had created a method to find the other dragons.\nThe group then returned to the Archives, where Kalecgos used the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Locator\"&gt;Dragon Locator&lt;/a&gt; to help the missing members of the flight, and sent adventurers to provide them aid so they could rejoin the rest of the flight. During this time he personally came with them when it came to locating and aiding &lt;a href=\"Kirygosa\"&gt;Kirygosa&lt;/a&gt;, who ultimately refused to return to the flight as she was truly happy at &lt;a href=\"Dawn%27s%20Blossom\"&gt;Dawn's Blossom&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Jade%20Forest\"&gt;Jade Forest&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Surigosa\"&gt;Surigosa&lt;/a&gt;, who had traveled the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt; while investigating a sect of &lt;a href=\"Hedge%20wizard\"&gt;rogue mages&lt;/a&gt; known as the &lt;a href=\"Sullied%20Banner\"&gt;Sullied Banner&lt;/a&gt;. Though knowing that Azuregos had set off to aid Surigosa, he decided to accompany them in order to provide his aid. The group discovered that the Sullied Banner were attempting to create the &lt;a href=\"Mana%20bomb\"&gt;Mana bomb&lt;/a&gt; that had destroyed Theramore and called for the mages to be subdued instead of killed, which surprised Azuregos who noted that he believed that the encounter with &lt;a href=\"Raszageth\"&gt;Raszageth&lt;/a&gt; would have relieved him of that impulse. However, Kalecgos was adamant and pointed out how every time Malygos intervened in the affairs of mortals, mages died which just continued a cycle of destruction that he had no desire to perpetuate. Though disagreeing with his methods, his fellow dragons agreed to follow his lead. When Azuregos continued to argue the point, Kalec revealed that the Sullied Banner flew the flag of Theramore and were grieving, fearing for their lives, and expressed hope that they could be reasoned with.\nAfter the leader of the mages, &lt;a href=\"Turi%20Flickerflame\"&gt;Turi Flickerflame&lt;/a&gt;, was apprehended he questioned her motives, and learned that she and the Sullied Banner were trying to find a means to protect themselves and Turi personally blamed the blue dragonflight for allowing the destruction of Theramore and loss of life that happened. Kalecgos admitted that she was right as they failed to protect the &lt;a href=\"Focusing%20Iris\"&gt;Focusing Iris&lt;/a&gt; and Theramore and had failed. He admitted that while nothing he can say can bring back the fallen nor express the regret he feels, he couldn't condone her instructions. However, he offered the chance to move forward and be better than those who came before. He then admitted to wanting to speak with her further about the future she wanted to build for her fellow mages. Following this, he returned to the Archives and once the rest of the blue dragonflight had arrived he declared that they could go back to caring for &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; and making sure its power isn't abused. He then started to give a speech speaking of the blue dragonflight as a family, when he was interrupted by a projection of Azuregos who revealed that the memories of Sindragosa and Malygos were destroying the Veiled Ossuary. He subsequently opened a portal, allowing adventurers and other members of the flight to deal with the latter, while he remained behind to monitor the situation.\nRecognizing that the violent deaths that Malygos and Sindragosa experienced had left them stranded in their final moments, Azuregos and the others recovered their essences and brought them back to Kalec at the Azure Archives. Kalecgos subsequently thanked the group for their efforts and revealed that he and the simulacrum of Sindragosa had devised a plan, though it was a dangerous one. Working together as one, the blue dragonflight used the &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; energy within the Azure Archives to break the loop of death that Malygos and Sindragosa had found themselves trapped in, where Kalecgos subsequently found himself fighting Malygos, while adventures clashed against Sindragosa. After being defeated, the pair were properly soothed and released from their torment, and Malygos formally apologized to Kalecgos and declared that the burden as Aspect should not be his to bear. However, Kalec countered that Malygos hadn't left a burden but a brilliant legacy that he and the flight will carry onward. After witnessing the spirits peacefully pass on to the afterlife, Kalec was approached by the simulacrum who revealed that her work was done, for now, and vanished as well, causing him to formally thank her for everything.\nIn the aftermath, Senegos decided that the time had come for his long life to end at last and the blue dragonflight watched as he gave one last flight. When Stellagosa asked what they were to do now, Kalec responded that they would strengthen the bonds of their flight by celebrating all those who came before and that the Archives were their new home. He further declared that he would be there for them, if they ever had need of him. Adventures wielding &lt;a href=\"Dragonwrath%2C%20Tarecgosa%27s%20Rest\"&gt;Dragonwrath, Tarecgosa's Rest&lt;/a&gt;, were then approached by Kalec who recalled how he had bound the soul of &lt;a href=\"Tarecgosa\"&gt;Tarecgosa&lt;/a&gt; to the staff to prolong her time on Azeroth. However, he knew that the time had come to give Tarecgosa her final rest place. Thus, the pair enacted a ritual to siphon her essence from the staff and shared a final goodbye with Tarecgosa as she departed.\nIn the aftermath of Ebyssian being selected as the new Aspect of the black dragonflight, Alexstrasza declared that the threat of &lt;a href=\"Aberrus%2C%20the%20Shadowed%20Crucible\"&gt;Aberrus, the Shadowed Crucible&lt;/a&gt; had been quailed and had made them grow stronger, while declaring that soon Azeroth would welcome a &lt;a href=\"The%20Sisters%27%20Tear\"&gt;symbol hope&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; and that they would protect it. After this declaration, Kalec reflected that while their troubles were far from over, but for the first time since the &lt;a href=\"Primal%20Incarnates\"&gt;Primal Incarnates&lt;/a&gt; were released, he felt hope that they would succeed. He further stated that his family was more than just his flight, but also his fellow Aspects, their flights, and even the adventures themselves.\nIn time, &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt; felt the energy that transcends time in the Silver Scale and believed that this would enable them to collect memories that Tyr did not implement on the scale. Thus Kalecgos accompanied him to &lt;a href=\"Tyrhold\"&gt;Tyrhold&lt;/a&gt;, where they would send adventurers and &lt;a href=\"Watcher%20Koranos\"&gt;Watcher Koranos&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Tyr\"&gt;Tomb of Tyr&lt;/a&gt; to acquire whatever memories were present. After obtaining memories and witnessing Tyr's final moments, they returned to the Aspects and uploaded the memories. However, the copy of Tyr only briefly moved before shutting down once more. While Nozdormu was dismayed at this, Kalec believed that their still avenues to explore and that a new path would become clear to them.\nQuests.\nHe provides the quest providing attunement to &lt;a href=\"Heroic%20mode\"&gt;heroic&lt;/a&gt; Magisters' Terrace. The quest chain is available at reputation with the &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Sun%20Offensive\"&gt;Shattered Sun Offensive&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuotes.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nMagisters' Terrace.\n(As he flies over from Sunwell Plateau) \nCataclysm.\n&lt;a href=\"Dragonwrath%2C%20Tarecgosa%27s%20Rest\"&gt;Dragonwrath, Tarecgosa's Rest&lt;/a&gt;.\nAhh, it is good to see you again, &lt;race&gt;.\nThere is no time to waste, friend.\nMy flight is in disarray and is in desperate need of leadership.\nLegion.\nGood to see you, friend.\nOur chances against the Burning Legion are grim at best.

After Garrosh Hellscream escaped from his trial, the mad Kalecgos was teleported to the Temple and immediately began attacking everyone he could see. He lacked any strategy. At one moment he targeted Baine Bloodhoof only to be stopped by Kalecgos from the main universe as he draw his attention to him. The two dragons fought, the mad dragon wanting to be killed, but eventually, the main universe Kalecgos was able to explain his alternate self that the deaths was that had erupted after Jaina destroyed Orgrimmar wasn't his fault but Jaina's as well as Anveena's decision. With this knowledge, the mad Kalecgos' face relaxed and returned to his timeline. According to Baine, Kairoz selected the most broken and darkest versions.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

This highly technical fight takes place in two different realms at the same time. In the normal realm the players face &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; the dragon, while in the spectral realm &lt;a href=\"Sathrovarr%20the%20Corruptor\"&gt;Sathrovarr the Corruptor&lt;/a&gt; and Kalec, Kalecgos' half-elf form, fight for control over the dragon. The battle is won when Sathrovarr and the dragon are both subdued, and it is lost when Sathrovarr kills Kalec. Roughly every 30 seconds, an opportunity presents itself for players to change realm. A solid rotation has to be worked out on who switches when to the spectral realm. Even after the HP reduction of patch 3.0.2, Kalecgos is not a trivial fight.\nAbilities.\nKalec.\nThis is Kalecgos' half-elf form in the spectral realm.\nPreparation.\nThe whole raid basically needs Tier 6 (BT/MH) quality gear. All raid members should have 10k HP or more. Some amount of arcane resistance (about 120 buffed, e.g. &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Badge\"&gt;Violet Badge&lt;/a&gt; plus &lt;a href=\"Cloak%20of%20Arcane%20Evasion\"&gt;Cloak of Arcane Evasion&lt;/a&gt; with enchant) helps to control the damage from Arcane Buffet. Tanks need a good supply of &lt;a href=\"Ironshield%20Potion\"&gt;Ironshield Potion&lt;/a&gt;s. Melee damage dealers can use &lt;a href=\"Elixir%20of%20Demonslaying\"&gt;Elixir of Demonslaying&lt;/a&gt;, as dealing high damage to Sathrovarr is crucial.\nStrategy.\nPortal rotation.\nThe key to this fight is to set up a proper portal rotation routine. Due to the enrage mechanic, Sathrovarr and Kalecgos need to be brought down nearly simultaneously. Usually, Sathrovarr's health drops slower than Kalecgos, therefore it's crucial to make good use of the portals.\nThe basic idea is to divide the raid into either three or four logical groups, and if any member of one of these groups gets ported by the dragon, all other members of that group follow immediately. Additionally, one tank or an extra healer usually go with each group. The portal groups should consist of an even mix of DPS and healers, and each group must contain at least one decurser.\nIn theory, each portal can be used by up to 10 players before it expires. Due to practical problems, it's better to reduce the group size while learning the encounter to 5, so that only 6 people have to use each portal - this results in four groups. With practise, it's possible to increase the group size (and thus the damage dealt to Sathrovarr) so that 8 people use each portal, resulting in three groups.\nBecause the teleports take place in a random fashion, it's not possible to assign the tanks (and the free agent) to fixed groups. Depending on which raid members get ported, the assignment of tanks to portal groups is dynamic. If any raid member not assigned to a portal group (e.g. a tank) gets ported, one of the groups without the debuff must react quickly and follow, else that portal is lost, the raid takes increased damage from Arcane Buffet, and DPS on Sathrovarr are low (such a situation usually eventually leads to a wipe).\nThe three tanks set up their own rotation:\nIn principle, tanks go to the spectral realm whenever they can, and each tank which enters a new realm immediately takes over the mob there. The only exception is that the 3rd tank passes on the 2nd portal.\nFour group setup.\nUsing a four group strategy is simplified by using the five man group structure. There are four portal groups of 5 raid members each, while the last group consists of three tanks, one \"free agent\" and one raid member who joins the group which takes the second portal. The free agent should be a healer who tries to balance healing across realms, going where healing is needed most (usually this results in spending as much time as possible in the spectral realm). The last raid member should join the group using the 2nd portal because that one is not used by a tank.\nOne member of each of the four portal (= non-tank) groups can get a raid icon, to simplify identification. Whenever a raid member is ported, he calls out on Teamspeak which group should use the portal. A sample four group setup can look like this:\nThree group setup.\nWhen using this strategy, three groups of 7 raid members each are pre-designated, the three tanks and one extra healer remain unassigned. The first portal is used by one tank and one of the groups, the second portal by the extra healer and one group, the third portal the third tank and the third group. From this point on, group composition doesn't change anymore, because on each portal only one group doesn't have the spectral exhaustion debuff and thus can go to the spectral realm.\nPositioning.\nAfter pulling, the tank should turn Kalecgos around and move him a little, to make sure that no other raid members stand in the frontal cone. Although the raid takes damage continuously, the primary focus of all healers is the tank.\nThe logical groups which use the same portal each get a general area assigned (like \"top left\", \"close in\", etc.), and stand loosely (8 yards apart) in that area. When one group member gets ported, this setup makes sure that all other group members are close to the portal and don't have to search for it. Pay attention to keep enough distance between raid members so the blast damage doesn't hurt anybody (most boss mods have a proximity warning built in).\nIn the spectral realm, the raid should set up in a tight circle around Sathrovarr. This serves to reduce the damage from Shadow Bolt Volley, while keeping everyone close enough to Kalec for the Revitalize buff, and within &lt;a href=\"Chain%20Heal\"&gt;Chain Heal&lt;/a&gt; range.\nDecursing.\nSince the curse never goes away (it only switches target), more and more raid members are afflicted in the course of the fight. After some time, it is active in both realms, sooner or later, decursers do nothing but bounce curses around. Tanks should always be decursed immediately, while other raid members should keep the curse for about 15 seconds.\nEnd of combat.\nWhen either mob reaches 10%, they both enrage and progressively increase the damage they deal. If either mob reaches 1%, it is banished (subdued) and stops all actions. If Kalecgos is banished, no more portals open up, in that case Sathrovarr has to be brought to 1% by the raid members currently in the spectral realm alone. The fight ends with victory only if both mobs are banished.\nIn summary, it's a very good idea to keep their health close together, so that they reach 10% at the same time. At that point, Sathrovarr should be brought down to 1% first, and then Kalecgos.\nWipe recovery.\nThe fight ends in failure and Kalecgos despawns for 20 seconds if any of the following conditions are met:\nFor wipe recovery, it's necessary to despawn Kalecgos. The best method to achieve this is to misdirect him to a target standing in the gazebo. A more messy method is to have one mounted player gain aggro and then run towards the gazebo, with healers in the gazebo trying to get healing aggro. After the dragon has despawned, rezzers can run in and each rez exactly one target. Rezzing two doesn't work, because the rez target doesn't have enough time to run to safety before Kalecgos respawns.\nAt level 80.\nIdeal Raid Composition: 4 healers, 2 tanks, 19 dps\nAt level 80, the Enrage mechanic will not do nearly enough substantial damage to a tank for it to be a concern anymore (this does not apply to healers or dps). If you kill Kalecgos' dragon form before you kill Sathrovarr he will become immune and no longer cast portals to the spirit realm. Therefore, it is required that the majority of the raid concentrates on entering the spectral realm (through the debuff (Spectral Blast) or the portal(s) created thereafter) and make quick work of Sathrovarr's hit points (which will banish him for the remainder of the encounter) and then focus on Kalecgos in the Physical Realm.\nIn other words:\n\"Notes: As with other dragon bosses, avoid his tail or his frontal cone if you are a dps or healer. Kalecgos' Frost Breath can be dispelled but not necessary.\""}

Ashildir eventually died in battle, and the minions of &lt;a href=\"Helya\"&gt;Helya&lt;/a&gt; sought her remains in the hopes of bringing her soul to &lt;a href=\"Helheim\"&gt;Helheim&lt;/a&gt;. Only Ashildir's loyal shieldmaiden &lt;a href=\"Shieldmaiden%20Iounn\"&gt;Iounn&lt;/a&gt; stood against them, and she managed to carry the Valkyra leader home to &lt;a href=\"Stormheim\"&gt;Stormheim&lt;/a&gt; to lay her to rest. Ashildir's spirit ascended to forever serve as the queen of the Valkyra. Iounn had been badly injured by Helya's minions and died shortly after, but her spirit was raised to continue serving at her queen's side.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Bonespeakers\"&gt;Bonespeakers&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Stormheim\"&gt;Stormheim&lt;/a&gt; stole &lt;a href=\"Ashildir%27s%20Bones\"&gt;Ashildir's Bones&lt;/a&gt; to prevent &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;mortal outsiders&lt;/a&gt; from receiving her judgment and completing the Trial of Valor. Under the direction of Shieldmaiden Iounn, the outsiders recovered the bones, crippled the Bonespeakers, and destroyed the ritual stones that weakened her spirit. All through this, Ashildir's fragmented spirit caught glimpses of the hero who saved her, and thusly gained her trust. Through a &lt;a href=\"Rune%20of%20Reformation\"&gt;Rune of Reformation&lt;/a&gt;, Ashildir's spirit was returned to her bones in order to communicate with her. In order to fully free her spirit, Ashildir and the heroes, alongside her Valkyra, battled with the leader of the Bonespeakers, &lt;a href=\"Runeseer%20Faljar\"&gt;Runeseer Faljar&lt;/a&gt;. Faljar, however, proved to be too powerful for them, and as a result, they were all collectively banished to Helheim.\nSeeking to escape, Ashildir directed the heroes to the altar of Helya, who was currently making a deal with the Banshee Queen, &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;. Helya angrily berated the heroes after they requested to leave Helheim, fragmenting their soul. However, she claimed she would allow them to leave Helheim if they could entertain her by defeating her champion, &lt;a href=\"Geir\"&gt;Geir&lt;/a&gt;, a task she thought impossible. Using a &lt;a href=\"Helheim%20Waylight\"&gt;Helheim Waylight&lt;/a&gt;, Ashildir and the heroes prepared to face the Eternal Nemesis by collecting the fragmented pieces of their soul and freeing the drowning Valkyra from Helheim's fiends. In accordance with their deal, Ashildir and the heroes defeated Helya's pet, much to her chagrin. To Helya's shock and despite her furious protests, the fact that the ruler of Helheim promised that they could leave if her terms were met actually meant that she would be powerless in keeping them there. With Helya's mighty shriek of defeat, Ashildir, the Valkyra, and the heroes were returned to the world above.\nLater, when heroes sought to enter the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20Eyir\"&gt;Vault of Eyir&lt;/a&gt;, Ashildir appeared to them once more in a bright flash of light. Knowing full well their worthiness, Ashildir allowed them passage, but warned them that &lt;a href=\"Eyir\"&gt;Eyir&lt;/a&gt; may not regard them in the high regard that she did.\nAshildir later assisted &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; and the adventurer in empowering their artifact.\nQuotes.\nGossip.\nWe face a formidable foe, but we must not let Helya win.\nSpeak your piece.\nStatue at Skold-Ashil.\nBefore you stands a statue depicting the leader of the Shieldmaidens in Skold-Ashil.\nHer features look familiar..."}

As well as the usual assortment of brutes and warriors, the Ashmaul clan is notable for its pyromancers, flamespeakers and magma casters, summoning fire elementals and hurling flame at enemies. The Ashmaul can usually be found gathered around large fires, channeling energy from, or perhaps to, the flames. The Ashmaul clan also includes stoneshapers, and use vicious beasts to bolster their might.\nThe Ashmaul appear to have a rivalry with the &lt;a href=\"Gor%27vosh%20clan\"&gt;Gor'vosh&lt;/a&gt;, a clan of necromantic ogres found in &lt;a href=\"Ashmaul%20Burial%20Grounds\"&gt;Ashmaul Burial Grounds&lt;/a&gt; in northeastern Ashran. Slaying enemies in Brute's Rise has a chance to grant players the \"Ashmaul Vengeance\" buff, increasing damage dealt to enemies in the Burial Grounds as well as increasing their chance of dropping &lt;a href=\"Artifact%20Fragment\"&gt;Artifact Fragment&lt;/a&gt;s. The sentiment is apparently reciprocated by the Gor'vosh, whose \"Gor'vosh Vengeance\" buff grants similar bonuses toward the slaying of enemies in Brute's Rise.\nThe Ashmaul also appear to control the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Conquest\"&gt;Ring of Conquest&lt;/a&gt; in western Ashran. Their presence in multiple areas and apparent previous control of the Ashmaul Burial Grounds suggests that the Ashmaul are, or at least were, the ruling ogre clan of Ashran.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Ashmaul%20Pearl\"&gt;Ashmaul Pearl&lt;/a&gt; can be gathered from the Ashmaul Clams, found on the beach below Brute's Rise."}

Ashra struggles between his feelings for his lover, &lt;a href=\"Isilra\"&gt;Isilra&lt;/a&gt;, and his devotion to the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;. Isilra's father apparently disapproves of the relationship, forcing them to meet in secret.\nBiography.\nAshra has fought in &lt;a href=\"Ragefire%20Chasm\"&gt;Ragefire Chasm&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Blackfathom%20Deeps\"&gt;Blackfathom Deeps&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Shadowfang%20Keep\"&gt;Shadowfang Keep&lt;/a&gt;, and once stormed the gates of &lt;a href=\"Deatholme\"&gt;Deatholme&lt;/a&gt; to avenge a fallen comrade's honor. During the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, many of his brethren were killed by &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Apothecary%20Putress\"&gt;Grand Apothecary Putress&lt;/a&gt;' &lt;a href=\"New%20Plague\"&gt;New Plague&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Angrathar%20the%20Wrathgate\"&gt;Wrathgate&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, Ashra was chosen by the blood elven leadership to represent the blood elves in the new Horde militia, the &lt;a href=\"Garad%27kra\"&gt;Garad'kra&lt;/a&gt;. Before leaving, he conferred with Isilra, promising to return home to her soon. She gave him a handmade cord to remember her by, which Ashra is highly protective of. While he was drinking at the &lt;a href=\"Wyvern%27s%20Tail\"&gt;Wyvern's Tail&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, a few drunken orcs made jokes at his expense and tried to steal the cord, causing the Blood Knight to fly into a rage, beat up the orcs, and threaten to kill them.\nLater, when the Garad'kra commander &lt;a href=\"Shagara\"&gt;Shagara&lt;/a&gt; gathered her team in the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Honor\"&gt;Valley of Honor&lt;/a&gt;, Ashra challenged her to &lt;a href=\"mak%27gora\"&gt;mak'gora&lt;/a&gt;, as he took issue with the idea that the whole militia was led by orcs and argued that leadership of the Garad'kra should be chosen by martial skill rather than race. He did not know the rules of mak'gora (including the fact that the duel is fought to the death), nor did he care to hear them. Shagara won the duel and nearly killed him, but left him alive and allowed him to be healed by &lt;a href=\"Targnak\"&gt;Targnak&lt;/a&gt; with the intent of humbling him. Ashra continued to bicker with &lt;a href=\"Felgrim\"&gt;Felgrim&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ironhoof\"&gt;Ironhoof&lt;/a&gt; during the Garad'kra's assembly in the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Ring of Valor&lt;/a&gt;, until Shagara reminded him of her authority.\nAshra accompanied his team on their first mission of dealing with &lt;a href=\"Aratas\"&gt;Aratas&lt;/a&gt;' &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt; army. During their first confrontation with the centaur in the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Barrens\"&gt;Northern Barrens&lt;/a&gt;, Ashra used his skills as healer and warrior to watch Felgrim's back against the &lt;a href=\"perfect%20ones\"&gt;perfect ones&lt;/a&gt;. After the battle, Ashra healed an injury to Felgrim's arm with the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; (causing the Forsaken extreme pain in the process). Ashra tried to kill the centaur &lt;a href=\"Dorthar\"&gt;Dorthar&lt;/a&gt; upon first spotting him, but the orc &lt;a href=\"Malgar\"&gt;Malgar&lt;/a&gt; intervened, allowing Dorthar to explain that he'd been abandoned by his kin. Following information from Dorthar, the Garad'kra set out on a &lt;a href=\"zeppelin\"&gt;zeppelin&lt;/a&gt; journey to &lt;a href=\"Desolace\"&gt;Desolace&lt;/a&gt; to strike at Aratas' army directly. During the voyage, Ashra learned that Felgrim had been unwittingly involved in Putress' betrayal at the Wrathgate, infuriating the Blood Knight. As the journey continued, the Garad'kra helped Dorthar learn how to fight, knitting the team closer together and training them to work as a unit.\nOn arrival in Desolace, Ironhoof and Shagara formed a plan to stop the centaur army by killing Aratas, even if it meant their own deaths, while Malgar and Dorthar would free the orc slaves. In the ensuing battle, the Garad'kra started to lose against Aratas' perfect ones until Malgar joined them and turned the tide. Rada'jin died from one of Aratas' spears meant for Malgar, and the khan retreated into &lt;a href=\"Maraudon\"&gt;Maraudon&lt;/a&gt; with the unconscious Shagara to sacrifice her to his &lt;a href=\"Aratas%27%20father\"&gt;elemental father&lt;/a&gt;.\nRada'jin's death caused the Garad'kra to immediately fall back into disagreements until Malgar declared that he was going after Shagara, which convinced the others to follow him. Inside Maraudon, Aratas summoned his \"father\", and the Garad'kra stopped to fight it while Malgar followed the centaur. The elemental proved to be impervious to all of Ironhoof, Ashra, and Felgrim's attacks, and the battle seemed lost until Malgar and Shagara returned with Aratas' spear, the elemental's only weakness. Shagara handed the spear to Ashra, and after the others used their abilities to create an opening, the Blood Knight used the spear to destroy the elemental.\nBack at the Wyvern's Tail in Orgrimmar weeks later, Ashra told Felgrim that he had misjudged him. Felgrim disagreed, stating that there was no excuse for his role in creating the plague. Ashra replied that he forgave the warlock nevertheless. The two of them then hurried to join the others and witness Dorthar joining the Horde.\nAppearance and personality.\nAshra is a well-built blood elf with a custom suit of Blood Knight armor; in \"&lt;a href=\"Bloodsworn\"&gt;Bloodsworn&lt;/a&gt;\", his battle gear is a mixture of both red and blue. He wears a long blue cape and often sports a hood, the latter somewhat reminiscent of a recolored &lt;a href=\"Hateful%20Gladiator%27s%20Scaled%20Helm\"&gt;Hateful Gladiator's Scaled Helm&lt;/a&gt;. His body glows with holy energy when he undergoes a spell or &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;-based attack. His preferred weapons are a sword-and-shield combo.\nThough often brusque, curt, and blunt, Ashra holds good intentions and does not see value in the racial inequality plaguing some of the Horde's members. He is highly proud of his status as a &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knight\"&gt;Blood Knight&lt;/a&gt;; he is also a strong believer in the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;, and feels just as strongly for his lover, &lt;a href=\"Isilra\"&gt;Isilra&lt;/a&gt;."}

{"id": "386114", "revid": "3154973", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=386114", "title": "Ashran", "text": "Ashran is a level 100 instanced cross-realm \"end game\" &lt;a href=\"world%20PvP\"&gt;world PvP&lt;/a&gt; zone found in . The name also refers to the greater Ashran zone, including the Alliance and Horde capitals, which are set outside of the PvP zone itself.\nThe zone has a cap of 40 players per side, with multiple Ashran instances for each server. When a player enters the zone, they will either be invited to join the battle, or if all instances of the zone are already at the cap for their faction, placed in a queue to join. Players who are not currently part of the battle will be teleported back to their faction staging area after a few seconds. Queued players will be invited to join the battle through a summons which will teleport them into an instance of the zone. Entering Ashran will automatically &lt;a href=\"PvP%20flag\"&gt;flag&lt;/a&gt; players for &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt; combat, regardless of server type, and players will remain PvP flagged as long they are in the zone.\nFound off the north east coast of 's &lt;a href=\"Tanaan%20Jungle\"&gt;Tanaan Jungle&lt;/a&gt;, Ashran is the same island that held &lt;a href=\"Deathwing%27s%20Lair\"&gt;Deathwing's Lair&lt;/a&gt; shortly after the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; in the main universe.\nWith &lt;a href=\"patch%208.0.1\"&gt;patch 8.0.1&lt;/a&gt; the battleground was temporarily removed, leaving the zone accessible but devoid of all former battleground NPCS. In &lt;a href=\"patch%208.2.0\"&gt;patch 8.2.0&lt;/a&gt; Ashran was re-added as a &lt;a href=\"battleground\"&gt;battleground&lt;/a&gt;, though its open world form is still entirely empty.\nHistory.\nThe island of Ashran was once home to a mighty ogre empire, apparently ruled at some point by &lt;a href=\"Kor%27lok\"&gt;Kor'lok&lt;/a&gt;. While apparently now in ruin, the island features signs of a once great settlement, including towers, arenas and extensive mines. Given the dominant presence of the &lt;a href=\"Ashmaul\"&gt;Ashmaul&lt;/a&gt; ogre clan, it may be inferred that the Ashmaul were either the controlling ogre power on the island prior to its fall into dilapidation, or else have descended from that power. Alternatively the Ashmaul may have conquered the island more recently, with earlier empires having ruled before the clan's rise to power. Ashmaul culture appears to revolve around fire magic, with the clan's ranks including pyromancers, flamespeakers and magma casters, as well as the support of a host of summoned fire elementals.\nThe smaller &lt;a href=\"Gor%27vosh\"&gt;Gor'vosh&lt;/a&gt; ogre clan, found only in the southeast of the island, appear to be the less dominant clan. Making their home in the &lt;a href=\"Ashmaul%20Burial%20Grounds\"&gt;Ashmaul Burial Grounds&lt;/a&gt;, these ogres practice &lt;a href=\"necromancy\"&gt;necromantic&lt;/a&gt; arts, and have raised a number of undead ogres from the remains in the area, presumably belonging to ogres from the Ashmaul clan, given the area's name. The two clans appear to be locked in a bitter rivalry.\nThe island is of great importance to both the Alliance and the Horde due to the presence of ancient artifacts which hold great power. The &lt;a href=\"Artifact%20Fragment\"&gt;fragments of artifacts&lt;/a&gt; found scattered across the isle are valued by both factions, as well as by the , while organizations such as the &lt;a href=\"Reliquary\"&gt;Reliquary&lt;/a&gt; keenly seek larger and more intact specimens from which to gain understanding and power, with the remarkable effects witnessed in the intact &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Artifact\"&gt;Ancient Artifact&lt;/a&gt;s occasionally found on the island demanding further investigation. The Alliance's investigations are headed up by &lt;a href=\"Harrison%20Jones\"&gt;Harrison Jones&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href=\"Belloc%20Brightblade\"&gt;Belloc Brightblade&lt;/a&gt; leads the Horde's efforts.\nThe Alliance is seeking a specific, large artifact, theorized by Harrison Jones to have powers rivaling that of &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; technology. The artifact appears to have military applications, with the possibility of using it or the knowledge gained from it against the Horde. The Horde are aware of the Alliance's search, and are attempting to find it first in order to defend themselves, breaking their treaty with the other faction and attacking it in the process. The artifact is in &lt;a href=\"Rukmaz%27s%20Vault\"&gt;Rukmaz's Vault&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Reliquary claim to wish to study the artifacts in order to give the Horde the upper hand in the war, in which pursuit they have come into conflict with the &lt;a href=\"Steamwheedle%20Cartel\"&gt;Steamwheedle Cartel&lt;/a&gt;, who have taken possession of quantities of the artifacts for their own commercial interests, and have a very different idea of the true meaning of the word \"priceless\". Apparently the goblins have begun selling Ashran \"souvenirs\", stringing together &lt;a href=\"Artifact%20Fragment\"&gt;Artifact Fragment&lt;/a&gt;s and selling them as jewelry.\nSince arriving on the island, each faction has established control of an entrance to the main mines beneath the island, subsequently blocking access even to revered adventurers due to \"work\" going on inside, and posting guards at the barricaded entrances. Harrison Jones believes the artifact sought by both factions to be located inside the mines, and according to Horde spies, the Alliance is currently building machinery used to drill through rocks. Not to be outdone, the blood elves had already discovered \"something big\" in the mines, supposedly a part of the artifact for which the Alliance have been searching.\nDescription.\n\"Off the coast of Tanaan Jungle lies an island home to an ancient Ogre civilization. An ancient artifact has been rumored to be somewhere within Ashran. If claimed, will be a devastating weapon to uphold.\"\nGetting there.\nAccess to Ashran is achieved primarily through flightmasters, who will fly Alliance and Horde players into their respective faction capitals of &lt;a href=\"Stormshield\"&gt;Stormshield&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Warspear\"&gt;Warspear&lt;/a&gt;, respectively, found somewhat outside the PvP zone. There are no flightpaths within the PvP zone itself, but it can accessed easily by ground from the capitals.\nThe ocean surrounding the island is not deep enough to incur &lt;a href=\"fatigue\"&gt;fatigue&lt;/a&gt;, and as such it is completely possible to reach Ashran from mainland Draenor and vice-versa.\nGeography.\nThe island is located in the &lt;a href=\"Barrier%20Sea\"&gt;Barrier Sea&lt;/a&gt;, not far from &lt;a href=\"Tanaan%20Jungle\"&gt;Tanaan Jungle&lt;/a&gt;'s eastern coast.\nGameplay.\nAshran is a large-scale world PvP zone which combines hectic 200-strong PvP combat with strategic elements such as capturable bases and recruitable NPCs, and PvE elements involving gathering resources from mobs, slaying enemy captains and fighting massive raid boss-style faction guardians and generals. As a result, the zone features PvP and PvE experiences from across both spectrums, ranging from fringe &lt;a href=\"world%20PvP\"&gt;world PvP&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"battleground\"&gt;battleground&lt;/a&gt; style zerging, and from raid-style PvE encounters to mob farming similar to the completion of dailies. Through diverse mechanisms all of these elements contribute toward a single driving goal: the defeat of the enemy faction.\nBattle in Ashran takes place in regular \"stages\" or mini-battles. After each stage is completed - with either the Alliance or the Horde the victors - there is a short intermission, usually 30\u201360 seconds, before the next battle begins. At this time capture points and certain other features are reset, allowing for a fresh attempt in the next battle. However, features such as the Ogre King, &lt;a href=\"Artifact%20Fragment\"&gt;Artifact Fragment&lt;/a&gt; stores and the players themselves are not reset in any way, allowing success in one battle to roll over into the next to some degree.\nWhile ultimately a PvP-oriented zone, Ashran represents a substantial amount of PvE, including the gathering of &lt;a href=\"Artifact%20Fragment\"&gt;Artifact Fragment&lt;/a&gt; from mobs in secondary areas; constant engagement with lesser faction NPCs; frequent engagement with challenging above-player level NPCS; and regular engagement with raid boss-level NPCs such as faction guardians and generals. Fighting to recruit &lt;a href=\"Kor%27lok\"&gt;Kor'lok&lt;/a&gt; or defeating rare elites in the secondary areas requires a small group similar to a dungeon instance. Artifact Fragment gathering provides a more similar experience to questing or the completion of dailies, while also providing the potential for &lt;a href=\"world%20PvP\"&gt;world PvP&lt;/a&gt;-style encounters.\nThe regular engagement with not only players but NPCs provides reward for &lt;a href=\"tank\"&gt;tank&lt;/a&gt;ing &lt;a href=\"specialization\"&gt;specialization&lt;/a&gt; players, with their damage absorption and taunting abilities extremely useful for preventing these NPCs from one-shotting other players.\nThe diverse range of potential activities in the zone provides the opportunity for substantial strategy, but also allows players to take their own approach to involvement in the battle. Some may prefer to fuel the war effort through farming NPCs and summoning guardians, while others may want to simply dive straight into the central zerg, with little concern for overarching strategies. The most strategic players will be willing to switch their role to respond to the needs of the situation, one moment fighting in the central lane to seize control of the next Tower, the next riding out to the secondary areas to farm Fragments in order summon the faction guardian before the opponent's can drive the players all the way back to their own gates. Versatile players will be ready to switch from dealing DPS to push forward the assault and defeat enemy players, to tanking a boss-level general before it can wipe out the player's team, to a healing spec to keep an ailing guardian alive. True mastery of the strategic options of the zone require players assuming each of these roles, with the need for each varying as the battle surges and sways.\nObjectives.\nUnlike &lt;a href=\"battleground\"&gt;battleground&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"PvP%20zone\"&gt;PvP zone&lt;/a&gt;s, Ashran has no time limit or ultimate conclusion, and no singular objective or way to permanently \"win\" the battle. While victory in the current battle is achieved by reducing the enemy's reinforcements to zero, each completed battle is followed shortly by the beginning of the next, allowing the enemy to rally and wreak vengeance upon their opponents.\nInstead, Ashran features a wide range of personal and faction objectives, including both PvP and PvE activities. Each player is free to decide for themselves where they will dedicate their actions, and combine different types of play as they see fit.\nWhile many objectives can be achieved within a single battle, some, such as the invasion of the enemy base, require consistent effort over several battles, as well as the concerted effort of the team.\nFaction leaders.\nPerhaps the ultimate goal of the zone, each faction's leader - &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Marshal%20Tremblade\"&gt;Grand Marshal Tremblade&lt;/a&gt; for the Alliance, &lt;a href=\"High%20Warlord%20Volrath\"&gt;High Warlord Volrath&lt;/a&gt; for the Horde - awaits enemy players at the heart of their stronghold. Defeating them requires invading the enemy base, and either slaying or at least surviving the onslaught of the dozens of surrounding guards and NPCs. \nAs invading the base is only feasible once all other Towers have been conquered, this represents the culmination of a complete domination of the zone. Fittingly, defeating the enemy faction leader will therefore reset the zone. Once the enemy faction leader has been defeated, there is a short interval to allow for looting, finishing off skirmishes, and freeing prisoners. A temporary flightmaster NPC will spawn at the base for the conquering faction to allow players to fly back to their own base before the reset. After 10 minutes, the zone will be reset.\nFaction leaders drop substantial rewards, in the form of the &lt;a href=\"Gleaming%20Ashmaul%20Strongbox\"&gt;Gleaming Ashmaul Strongbox&lt;/a&gt;, which always contains a piece of Combatant or Gladiator gear. However, they do not drop Conquest Points - for these players should seek out the &lt;a href=\"%23Secondary%20area%20events\"&gt;secondary area events&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe faction leaders also serve as elite conquest gear vendors, as well as providing &lt;a href=\"Enchant%20Illusion%20%E2%80%93%20Glorious%20Tyranny\"&gt;Enchant Illusion \u2013 Glorious Tyranny&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Enchant%20Illusion%20%E2%80%93%20Primal%20Victory\"&gt;Enchant Illusion \u2013 Primal Victory&lt;/a&gt; to players with a rating of 2400 or higher in Rated Battlegrounds, and 3v3 or 5v5 Arenas.\nEnemies slain.\nIn addition to the main thrust of PvP combat itself, during the main battle each faction has an Enemies Slain quota. The quota can be filled through slaying enemy players and NPCs, with larger targets providing a larger gain. Filling the current quota will cause the faction to spawn a random faction Captain (see below).\nThe quotas required by each faction vary, depending on various factors. If a faction loses a Tower on their own side of the Road of Glory, their quota will be reset to 50. Each time a faction successfully meets their quote and summons a Captain, their total will be reset, and their current quota will be doubled. The current quota is displayed at the top of the screen while within the Road of Glory or currently contested base.\nCaptains.\nCaptain are elite faction-specific NPCs which spawn to fight for their faction, in response to filling the current Enemies Slain quota. Each faction has a number of possible Captains, with each paying tribute to a well-known personality from \"World of Warcraft\" culture, such as &lt;a href=\"John%20Swifty\"&gt;John Swifty&lt;/a&gt; for the Alliance, and &lt;a href=\"Mindbender%20Talbadar\"&gt;Mindbender Talbadar&lt;/a&gt; for the Horde.\nEach Captain has a class and specialization, and uses an appropriate set of abilities. Captains have large amounts of health and hit fairly hard.\nFor a list of possible captains, see &lt;a href=\"%23Notable%20NPCs\"&gt;below&lt;/a&gt;.\nArtifact Fragments.\n&lt;a href=\"Artifact%20Fragment\"&gt;Artifact Fragment&lt;/a&gt; is a form of currency obtainable while in Ashran, gained primarily from looting mobs and the corpses of enemy players who possessed them. Fragments can be turned in through special NPCs at the faction base in order to activate special features for the player's faction, such as sending powerful NPCs to attack the enemy, or activating special warlock gateways to instantly transport players between areas of Ashran. \nTurning in Artifact Fragments for these purposes is the aim of a number of repeatable quests, rewarding 3 &lt;a href=\"Honor%20Points\"&gt;Honor Points&lt;/a&gt; and 5 reputation with the respective faction for each 1 Artifact Fragment turned in. However, the main goal is to further the faction's progress within the current battle.\nWhile Artifact Fragments stack to 100,000, it may not be wise to hold onto them for too long. If the player dies they will lose half of all their current Artifact Fragments, with enemy players able to loot the lost Fragments from their corpses. This deters players from hoarding Fragements, and forces them to balance time wasted running from secondary areas to their faction base while farming with the ever-present risk of being slain by the enemy.\nEvents.\nIn each &lt;a href=\"%23Secondary%20areas\"&gt;secondary area&lt;/a&gt;, a special event plays out, at random intervals. Competing in these events requires the faction to achieve a specific task before the opposite faction, and offer rewards to participating players. The faction that loses an event will gain a stacking buff, increasing their damage and healing. For more information, see &lt;a href=\"%23Secondary%20area%20events\"&gt;Secondary area events&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpecial items and buffs.\nAshran features a variety of special items for use within the zone. These come from several sources. Many can be purchased from quartermasters in each faction's base, while others can be acquired through looting certain mobs or even interacting with special objects found in the zone. Different secondary areas offer their own special buffs and items, for those who know where to look. Others are random drops, such as the class-specific tomes which grant players special abilities for 1 hour.\nQuartermaster items.\nThese items can be purchased from &lt;a href=\"Dazzerian\"&gt;Dazzerian&lt;/a&gt; (Horde) or &lt;a href=\"Crafticus%20Mindbender\"&gt;Crafticus Mindbender&lt;/a&gt; (Alliance) in their respective faction bases. Some items require reaching certain reputations with &lt;a href=\"Wrynn%27s%20Vanguard\"&gt;Wrynn's Vanguard&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin%27s%20Spear\"&gt;Vol'jin's Spear&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlchemist items.\nPlayers can turn in 10 &lt;a href=\"Artifact%20Fragment\"&gt;Artifact Fragment&lt;/a&gt; to their faction alchemist - &lt;a href=\"Gimlet%20Ginfizz\"&gt;Gimlet Ginfizz&lt;/a&gt; for Alliance, &lt;a href=\"Tyra%20Silverblood\"&gt;Tyra Silverblood&lt;/a&gt; for Horde - in exchange for the below potions:\nClass tomes.\nClass tomes are class specific consumables which modify existing abilities or in some cases grant entirely new ones. Class tomes have a chance to drop from the rare elite mobs found in the zone's &lt;a href=\"%23Secondary%20areas\"&gt;secondary areas&lt;/a&gt;.\nScrolls and wands.\nThese items can be obtained as random zone drops. Some are single-use, while others have 3 charges each. Players can usually carry up to 5 of each single-use item at the same time, but only one of each charge-bearing item. Scrolls take several seconds to use, while wands tend to be instant.\nOf special note is &lt;a href=\"Scroll%20of%20Invoke%20Yu%27lon%2C%20the%20Jade%20Serpent\"&gt;Scroll of Invoke Yu'lon, the Jade Serpent&lt;/a&gt;, used to summon the Jade Serpent &lt;a href=\"Yu%27lon\"&gt;Yu'lon&lt;/a&gt;. Similar to &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Wyrm%20Egg\"&gt;Frost Wyrm Egg&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nesingwary%27s%20Lost%20Horn\"&gt;Nesingwary's Lost Horn&lt;/a&gt;, this summons Yu'lon to fly along the Road of Glory, healing all friendly targets to full health and removing all Magical, Poison, and Disease effects from them. Yu'lon travels from the friendly base along the road in the direction of the enemy base.\nSecondary area buffs and items.\nEach of these buffs and items can be obtained through objects or mobs found in a specific secondary area.\nAncient Artifact.\n&lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Artifact\"&gt;Ancient Artifact&lt;/a&gt; is a 30-minute buff obtained in Ashran through interacting with the Ancient Artifact object, which appears sporadically at a variety of locations throughout the zone. It is easily the most powerful buff in the zone, granting the player a remarkable 200% increased damage or healing, and an extra 100% maximum health. The possessing player is indicated with with a striking visual effect, highlighting them to other players, often from across the zone.\nInteracting with the object takes several seconds, and despawns the object, granting the player the buff. Dying loses the buff and after a set period respawns the object, allowing another player to claim the buff for the remaining duration.\nFollowing hotfixes on July 20, the Ancient Artifact only appears when each team has more than 20 players, and now has a respawn timer.\nFrost Wyrm Egg.\n&lt;a href=\"Frost%20Wyrm%20Egg\"&gt;Frost Wyrm Egg&lt;/a&gt; is a usable item obtained as a random zone drop in Ashran. It summons a large &lt;a href=\"Frostwyrm%20%28Ashran%29\"&gt;Frostwyrm&lt;/a&gt;, who will fly down the &lt;a href=\"Road%20of%20Glory\"&gt;Road of Glory&lt;/a&gt; toward the enemy base, using its Deep Breath ability to freeze all enemies as it passes, stunning targets for 8 seconds.\nNesingwary's Lost Horn.\n&lt;a href=\"Nesingwary%27s%20Lost%20Horn\"&gt;Nesingwary's Lost Horn&lt;/a&gt; is a usable item obtained through defeating rares in the zone's secondary areas. Using it summons a herd of &lt;a href=\"Hemet%20Nesingwary\"&gt;Hemet Nesingwary&lt;/a&gt;'s 'pets', which will stampede from the friendly faction base across the zone before running directly into the enemy faction base. These stampeding creatures will deal a small amount of damage to nearby hostile players and punt them high up into the air. Their punting range is quite large, and will affect any hostile player in the nearby area. Abilities like &lt;a href=\"Levitate\"&gt;Levitate&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Slow%20Fall%20%28ability%29\"&gt;Slow Fall (ability)&lt;/a&gt; can be used to prevent damage from the fall back to earth, although this is less than would normally be experienced.\nSpecial objects and loot.\nA number of special objects can be looted during Ashran faction combat, including a number of keys. These objects have a chance of being looted from enemy player corpses.\nPrison keys can be used to unlock the cages of prisoners in the enemy base.\nSupply chest keys can be used to open faction supply chests, found at faction-controlled capture nodes along the &lt;a href=\"Road%20of%20Glory\"&gt;Road of Glory&lt;/a&gt;.\nLayout.\nThe zone centers around the &lt;a href=\"Road%20of%20Glory\"&gt;Road of Glory&lt;/a&gt;, the main lane between the Alliance and Horde bases - &lt;a href=\"Stormshield%20Stronghold\"&gt;Stormshield Stronghold&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Warspear%20Outpost\"&gt;Warspear Outpost&lt;/a&gt; - found at the south and north of the zone, respectively. Between the two bases lie five Towers, which can be claimed by each faction to push the battle toward the enemy gates. Around the central lane are four unique secondary areas, each with its own selection of elite and non-elite mobs. The central Market Graveyard can also be captured for 15 minutes at a time.\nDefensive buffs.\nPlayers closer to their faction base gain buffs to their damage dealing and healing done, making it a little tougher to push across the zone. These buffs are only gained while within the local area of the base or Tower.\nTowers.\nFive Towers line the &lt;a href=\"Road%20of%20Glory\"&gt;Road of Glory&lt;/a&gt;, each defended by an ever-replenishing pool of faction NPCs. At the start of each battle, the two closest to each base belong to that faction, while the central Tower is immediately contested. The term \"Tower\" is a reference to \" games\", the subgenre upon which Ashran is widely considered to be based - Ashran's \"Towers\" are in fact small clusters of buildings through which the Road of Glory passes. Each Tower is marked on the map, along with an indication of which faction currently controls them.\nEach Tower can belong to either the Alliance or Horde, or can be contested. Only one Tower can be contested at a time. In order to advance across the zone, players can capture the contested Tower for their faction. After a moment, the next most advanced Tower will become contested, with players able to progress to capture that Tower in turn. Battle NPCs such as guards and the far larger &lt;a href=\"Fangraal\"&gt;Fangraal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kronus\"&gt;Kronus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kor%27lok\"&gt;Kor'lok&lt;/a&gt; will also advance (or retreat) automatically to the currently contested Tower.\nOnly the currently contested Tower can be wrested from the enemy - those belonging to either faction cannot be directly captured, without first capturing the contested Tower and in turn making the next Tower along contested. The current conflict point is listed at the top of the screen while within the zone.\nOnce all Towers have been claimed by a given faction, after a short interval the enemy faction base itself will become contested. In addition, the dominant faction's Sentinels or Headhunters will eliminate the enemy Gladiators, rendering the enemy base vulnerable. Attacking players then have a 10 minute window in which to assault the base and defeat the enemy faction leader, after which the base's NPCs will respawn, and the previous Tower will revert to neutral; attacking players will then need to capture it again in order to get another shot at assaulting the enemy base. Should the attacking faction succeed in slaying the enemy faction leader, the battle will be won, and after a moderate interval for looting, the zone will be reset, with control of the Towers reverting to the initial configuration. A special NPC also spawns to allow attacking players to fly back to their own base before the guards respawn.\nPlayers can gain control of a Tower through a tug-of-war player presence mechanism similar to that seen in bases in &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20the%20Storm\"&gt;Eye of the Storm&lt;/a&gt;. Once a Tower is seized, NPCs of the controlling faction will begin to spawn there, and enemy NPCs will despawn, strengthening the faction's push toward the enemy base. In addition &lt;a href=\"Kor%27lok\"&gt;Kor'lok&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fangraal\"&gt;Fangraal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kronus\"&gt;Kronus&lt;/a&gt; automatically center around the currently contested Tower.\nCapture of Towers is important for providing the opportunity to assault the enemy base; to protect your own base from attack; and to open up areas of the map for your faction to travel in relative safety. Because players must remain at a Tower for a period of time in order to capture it, it is often necessary to fall back to a Tower in order to capture it, allowing for the next to be opened up to assault. This is especially important when the faction guardians or Kor'lok are active, as leaving the last Tower uncaptured will cause their presence to be wasted, with the titans left far behind the front lines.\nThe Towers from north to south:\nMage Towers.\nSituated overlooking the zone's second and fourth Towers, the Horde and Alliance Mage Towers house special Tower Guardian NPCs, powerful \"mini-bosses\" which act as additional barriers to progress across the zone. Currently, the Guardians act to bombard enemy players in the nearby Towers with their magics, but are not required to be defeated in order advance in the zone. However, their aerial attacks hit extremely hard, and can target players a significant distance in any direction from the Tower, reaching almost to &lt;a href=\"Crossroads%20%28Ashran%29\"&gt;The Crossroads&lt;/a&gt;. Players can seek shelter by staying very close to the Tower itself, or else must move well outside the area to avoid suffering damage.\nThe Guardians themselves are situated atop the physical towers of the first and fifth Tower areas - the Horde &lt;a href=\"Emberfall%20Watch\"&gt;Emberfall Watch&lt;/a&gt; and the Alliance &lt;a href=\"Crestfall%20Rise\"&gt;Crestfall Rise&lt;/a&gt; - and can be accessed by ascending those towers, although combating them is not something which should be engaged in lightly. Special secondary objectives and rewards are offered for defeating the opposing faction's Tower Guardian.\nGuardians can also be spoken to by friendly players, to whom they will provide an unending supply of &lt;a href=\"Conjured%20Mana%20Fritter\"&gt;Conjured Mana Fritter&lt;/a&gt;.\nFaction bases.\nAt the north and south of the zone lie the faction bases: the Horde's &lt;a href=\"Warspear%20Outpost\"&gt;Warspear Outpost&lt;/a&gt;, and the Alliance's &lt;a href=\"Stormshield%20Stronghold\"&gt;Stormshield Stronghold&lt;/a&gt;. Separated from the main island by a small bridge, each base features a graveyard and a variety of NPCs, including some well-defended Generals and several special NPCs which can assist the player in activating features within the battle. Each base is well-defended by level 100 Elite guards. Behind each faction base lies entry to that faction's Staging Area and capital city, outside the PvP zone itself. Entering the Staging Area will cause the player to leave the battle.\nEach base contains three Marshals or Warlords, serving as Honor, Conquest and Elite Conquest Quartermasters. These can be slain by the enemy, depriving players of the ability to acquire PvP gear. The Generals are found inside the main faction building, surrounded by guards.\nEach base features four NPCs who in exchange for &lt;a href=\"Artifact%20Fragment\"&gt;Artifact Fragment&lt;/a&gt; will provide special features to aid the faction in battle. Each requires a certain amount of Fragments in order to activate their special feature. However, this total can be provided cumulatively over time and by multiple players, with each NPC informing the player of the number gathered so far.\nThere are four types of battle NPCs:\nPrisoners.\nEach base features a number of prisoners from the opposite faction. Trapped within cages, these can be released using &lt;a href=\"Stormshield%20Prison%20Key\"&gt;Stormshield Prison Key&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Warspear%20Prison%20Key\"&gt;Warspear Prison Key&lt;/a&gt;, which have a chance to be looted from enemy players' corpses. Not yet implemented, releasing prisoners will provide players with special rewards.\nPrisoners can be found in specific locations within &lt;a href=\"Warspear%20Outpost\"&gt;Warspear Outpost&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stormshield%20Stronghold\"&gt;Stormshield Stronghold&lt;/a&gt;. The main location for prisoners is the opposing faction's prison, an underground chamber defended by a Prison Guard. Each base has three freeable prisoners situated in the main chamber, as well as one or two who appear slightly less concerned about their incarceration, located inside freely openable cells.\nThe prisons also serve as target destinations for paladins wielding &lt;a href=\"The%20Jailer%27s%20Libram\"&gt;The Jailer's Libram&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Horde Prisoners are mostly found in the Warspear Outpost prison, located beneath the relief hut on the left as you enter the base. A lone &lt;a href=\"Prison%20Guard%20%28Horde%29\"&gt;Prison Guard&lt;/a&gt; will need to be tackled to reach the cages themselves. &lt;a href=\"Field%20Marshal%20Kerwin\"&gt;Field Marshal Kerwin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Jobby%20Shortsight\"&gt;Commander Jobby Shortsight&lt;/a&gt; can be freed from cages here, while &lt;a href=\"Mya%20Springbloom\"&gt;Mya Springbloom&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Helda%20Thunderbraids\"&gt;Helda Thunderbraids&lt;/a&gt; can be found pacing up and down inside cells, apparently happy to remain in place for the time being. &lt;a href=\"Marshal%20Andrea%20DeSousa\"&gt;Marshal Andrea DeSousa&lt;/a&gt; can be found above ground, just to the right of the entrance to the relief hut.\nThe Alliance Prisoners are all found in the Stormshield Stronghold prison, found beneath the central chamber that houses the Alliance generals. A &lt;a href=\"Prison%20Guard%20%28Alliance%29\"&gt;Prison Guard&lt;/a&gt; guards the prison, where the freeable &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Jugan\"&gt;Warlord Jugan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Marshal%20Lyrdrea%20Daybreaker\"&gt;Marshal Lyrdrea Daybreaker&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"General%20Lizzie%20Heartbane\"&gt;General Lizzie Heartbane&lt;/a&gt; can be found. &lt;a href=\"Eska%20Sharphorn\"&gt;Eska Sharphorn&lt;/a&gt; stands in a separate cell, apparently resigned to this fate.\nAccessing prisoners generally happens under one of two circumstances: while the enemy base is populated by its defenders; or while the enemy base is under attack, with its defenders either engaged in battle or slain. In the latter case, players can access the prisoners relatively easily, although the Prison Guard may still be alive. In the former case, players will need to find a way past the numerous elite and rare elite NPCs that stand between the opposing faction and their prisoners.\nTwo main options for this exist: combat, or evasion. The first requires defeating or engaging dozens of elite NPCs, and usually coincides with the overrunning of the base as a whole. The second is an option only possible for classes with stealth abilities, or players with access to special items such as &lt;a href=\"Phantom%20Potion\"&gt;Phantom Potion&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Jailor%27s%20Law%20Book\"&gt;Jailor's Law Book&lt;/a&gt; can also be found and read here.\nHallowed Ground.\nEach faction's graveyard grants the Hallowed Ground buff to all characters of that faction that stand within the designated area. The buff makes the player immune to all damage.\nThe purpose of the buff is to provide a safe haven for players resurrecting during the invasion of their base. It also serves as a convenient safe spot for players wishing to take a minute away from the computer without fear of attack. However, while intended for defense, players with the Hallowed Ground buff are free to attack, apply buffs and debuffs and otherwise make use of their abilities. Any player of the correct faction can also enter and reenter the area as often as they like, each time becoming immune to all damage. Because of this, players may choose to enter the area to avoid attack; or to remain within the area while attacking nearby enemies. Players cannot gain the buff through occupying the enemy graveyard.\nThrone of the Ogre King.\nEast of the zone's center waits &lt;a href=\"Kor%27lok\"&gt;Kor'lok&lt;/a&gt; the Ogre King, along with his two bodyguards. Apparently the spirit of a mighty ogre, this NPC is willing to enter the fray as a powerful ally for the faction who wins his grudging respect - and a fearsome enemy for the other. \nThe Ogre King's assistance must be won through defeating one of his bodyguards in combat. &lt;a href=\"Gaul%20Dun%20Firok\"&gt;Gaul Dun Firok&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Muk%27Mar%20Raz\"&gt;Muk'Mar Raz&lt;/a&gt; are the Alliance and Horde champions, respectively, and the opposite faction champion must be defeated in order to recruit him. Once recruited Kor'lok will /yell his approval of the faction's efforts, and leaps into the fray as a boss-like level 102 NPC that will fight for that faction.\nUpon being recruited Kor'lok will leap high into the sky, crashing down at the furthest capture point the faction has advanced to, where he will begin to attack any hostile characters, including NPCs. However, by default he is stationary and with a relatively small aggro radius can be circumnavigated by players not wishing to engage him in battle. Once attacked he will follow his foe, and can be easily pulled away his capture point spawn if desired. However, if pulled too far he will evade and return to his spawn point, although his health does not appear to reset.\nKor'lok deals melee damage and uses warrior-type attacks, including Bladestorm, Shockwave and a kind of damage-oriented Heroic Leap with a long cast time. A number of his abilities appear to be designed to deal area of effect damage, although his single-target damage is formidable.\nKor'lok is targetable, buffable and healable by friendly players. Keeping him alive is likely worthwhile, given his potential for substantial damage-dealing. The longer the Ogre King goes undefeated, the more susceptible to damage he becomes, through the stacking Curse of Kor'lok debuff.\nDefeating Kor'lok causes a zone wide /yell announcing that the Ogre King slumbers once more. After a short while, another /yell will announce that he has awakened, reflecting that he is once again available for recruitment.\nBodyguards.\n&lt;a href=\"Gaul%20Dun%20Firok\"&gt;Gaul Dun Firok&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Muk%27Mar%20Raz\"&gt;Muk'Mar Raz&lt;/a&gt; are the Alliance and Horde champions respectively, with only the opposite faction champion attackable by players. The champions wield the same abilities used by Kor'lok, namely Bladestorm, Shockwave and a kind of damage-oriented Heroic Leap with a long cast time. However, they also possess special abilities resembling &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Nova\"&gt;Frost Nova&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Death%20Grip\"&gt;Death Grip&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Psychic%20Scream\"&gt;Psychic Scream&lt;/a&gt;, making it harder for ranged classes to kite them. If all attacking characters die, the champion will evade and return to his original position, although his health will not be reset.\nDefeating either faction champion will cause the other to despawn, preventing the other faction from quickly re-recruiting the Ogre King. Upon Kor'lok's defeat and subsequent reawakening, both champions will respawn with full health.\nWith around 3.3 million health and formidable abilities, the champions usually require a party of players to bring down under the best of circumstances, but when players of both factions are involved, things can become a little more complex. Whichever faction defeats their bodyguard first will gain the favor of Kor'lok, while the other bodyguard will despawn, preventing the opposition from reclaiming control. The result is a race between the factions, with each aiming to defeat their bodyguard before the enemy faction is able to do the same. While this can be achieved simply by defeating their own bodyguard first, players can take a more underhanded approach. Each bodyguard is healable by the friendly faction, making them excellent targets for heals and useful buffs, undermining the enemy faction's efforts. &lt;a href=\"Crowd%20control\"&gt;Crowd control&lt;/a&gt; can also be usefully employed upon parties of enemy players, either to simply slow their assault on their bodyguard, or, with good timing, to prevent players from escaping their bodyguard's high-damage area of effect attacks.\nSecondary areas.\nAround the central lane are scattered several unique secondary areas, featuring elite and non-elite mobs and special interactable features, such as boulders to throw at enemies and grappling hooks to scale down to the beach below. These are the main gathering places for &lt;a href=\"Artifact%20Fragment\"&gt;Artifact Fragment&lt;/a&gt;, gained from slaying mobs in the area. Each area also plays host to a special secondary event (see below) and challenging unique rare mobs, which drop extra rewards with a chance of &lt;a href=\"%23Class%20tomes\"&gt;class tome&lt;/a&gt;s.\nUpon initially entering a secondary area, the player will be presented with a list of bonus objectives, chiefly involving slaying various mobs in the area. Completing these objectives will earn the player Artifact Fragments and other bonus rewards, including 150 &lt;a href=\"Honor%20Points\"&gt;Honor Points&lt;/a&gt;. Players can complete these objectives over the course of several visits to the area without losing progress. Players can complete bonus objectives once a day.\nIn addition to serving to provide Artifact Fragments, each secondary area features a unique collectable item, buff or other special opportunity. These effects are usually quite powerful, and once acquired can be used to boost the player's abilities while back in the main battle. This encourages players to gather these resources in order to bolster their power on the battlefield, rewarding preparation and the exploration of the secondary areas.\nClockwise from north, the secondary areas are:\nAs a result of long-standing feuds between the inhabitants of the zones in the northwest (Amphitheater of Annihilation) and southeast (Molten Quarry), and in the northeast (Brute's Rise) and southwest (Ashmaul Burial Grounds) areas, slaying Fragment-yielding mobs in each of these areas will grant a 30-minute stacking buff that increases damage done to mobs in the opposite area, as well as increasing the amount of Fragments gained from them. The buffs improve both figures by 20% per stack, and can stack at least 5 times.\nWhile these buffs offer bonuses for swapping from base to base, the position of these zones means that one of each pair will be close to the enemy faction base, making farming Fragments there a particularly risky proposition.\nFarming in these areas while they are behind the enemy front lines grants the Fortune Favors the Bold buff, increasing the amount of Fragments gathered by 100%.\nSecondary area events.\nSet in the outlying areas of Ashran are seven unique events. These are special time-limited events which take place at random intervals, offering rewards in the form of reputation, PvP gear, 100 &lt;a href=\"Conquest%20Points\"&gt;Conquest Points&lt;/a&gt;, and possibly &lt;a href=\"Honor%20Points\"&gt;Honor Points&lt;/a&gt; for the first faction to complete a specific secondary objective. Rewards are provided in the form of Strongboxes, with varying contents. \nEvents can be completed by any player in the area. Events can take place during the main battle, or in-between battles. At regular intervals, an event is selected at random to occur, and the coming event is announced zone-wide. Events are displayed on the map similarly to &lt;a href=\"vignette\"&gt;vignette&lt;/a&gt;s with a crossed swords icon, and can only be completed while active. \nClockwise from north, the events are:\nEvent loss buffs.\nWith &lt;a href=\"Patch%206.2\"&gt;Patch 6.2&lt;/a&gt;, if a faction repeatedly loses at an Ashran event, they will receive a buff that increases their damage, healing, and damage absorption by 5% per stack, stacking up to 10 times. A stack of the buff will be removed each time the losing faction wins an event. Defeating the opposite faction's leader also counts as winning an event.\nThe buff is currently invisible, but a visible buff effect may be added with a future patch.\nFaction NPCs.\nEach faction has a range of NPCs which appear in various areas of the zone, providing both offensive and defensive benefits. Defeating them will contribute to the Enemies Slain quota.\nIn addition to specific combat NPCs, all base NPCs including vendors and Artifact Fragment NPCs will also join the battle if provoked.\nThe presence of so many NPCs in the battle adds a substantial PvE element to proceedings. Tanks are highly useful for combating the more powerful NPCs; these are often capable of one-shotting lighter-armored players and will respond to threat generation from healers as well as their actual attackers. Tanks can therefore greatly improve the odds against these NPCs and accelerate progression across the zone. Other specs can and should make use of taunt abilities to prevent healers from being annihilated.\nFaction guardians.\n and are the Alliance and Horde Guardians, powerful boss-like NPCs summoned through spending &lt;a href=\"Artifact%20Fragment\"&gt;Artifact Fragment&lt;/a&gt; at appropriate battle NPCs. Once summoned they will who spawn at the currently contested Tower or base, attacking any hostile characters they encounter. When the currently contested Tower or base changes, these NPCs will immediately transfer to that location, even if there are no friendly players yet in that area.\nThese NPCs are substantial opponents, with the health of raid bosses and powerful melee attacks. They also have some special abilities, such as Kronus' \"Stone Empowerment\" debuff, granted to all nearby enemies, which causes slain enemies to grant him a 3% damage reduction buff, stacking up to 30 times. Fangraal roots nearby attackers.\nWhile these NPCs are not necessary in order to assault the enemy base, their presence is a massive advantage in countering both enemy players and enemy NPCs. In the current build, it is generally recommended to keep the faction guardian active at all times. Once one faction has their guardian active, it is generally extremely hard for the opposing faction to regain control of the zone without summoning their own. Summoning the guardian can easily turn the tide of battle, even if the enemy was about to storm the base. Fangraal or Kronus can easily single-handedly fight back whole raids of players, especially with the help of players and other NPCs.\nWhen both guardians are active, they can and will fight each other. However, their massive health pools mean that this is usually a long, slow war of attrition. Even with forty players, it may take several minutes of continuous and concerted damage-dealing to bring down a guardian.\nCritically, guardians can be healed and buffed. Any healer should make an effort to ensure the guardian stays at high health, and dispel any powerful debuffs. Through regular healing, a guardian can become almost unbeatable. The opponents then have to deal with the healers first, while trying to avoid being swatted by the guardian. In this case, the only good option is to summon their own guardian.\nWhile active, the current position of the player's faction guardian is marked on the map.\nRewards.\nPlayers participating in Ashran will be able to earn:\nAshran features an additional 200 Conquest Point cap, allowing players to earn an additional 200 points per week from Ashran on top of what they are able to earn from other sources. Players are able to earn the full cap solely through Ashran if they choose.\nNotable NPCs.\nFor a list of mobs found in secondary areas, see individual pages.\nDevelopment.\nFor a list of developments and changes to Ashran over the course of the \"&lt;a href=\"Warlords%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Warlords of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;\" beta, see &lt;a href=\"Warlords%20of%20Draenor%20beta%20timeline\"&gt;Warlords of Draenor beta timeline&lt;/a&gt;.\nOne reason for the lack of a zone similar to Ashran prior to \"Warlords of Draenor\" was technological constraints, while another was the lack of the design resources required to make it.\nThe battle NPCs such as &lt;a href=\"Fangraal\"&gt;Fangraal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kronus\"&gt;Kronus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kor%27lok\"&gt;Kor'lok&lt;/a&gt; and the Captains were partly introduced to add variety to the central lane battle of the zone, breaking up the purely player on player zerg otherwise common in that area of Ashran.\nUntil almost 2 months after the zone's release, Ashran did not feature any form of faction balancing. Players were able to enter regardless of faction, until that faction's population cap was reached. Below the cap, faction balance was intended to be achieved through specifically matching servers with opposite faction ratios. However, due in part to prolonged problems with server matching, and bugs preventing players from entering the zone, 'forced' faction balancing was eventually introduced.\nThe design for Ashran presented at &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon%202013\"&gt;BlizzCon 2013&lt;/a&gt; stated that players would be able to \"build and commandeer siege vehicles\", some of which might be constructed over the course of multiple days. Players would be able to build these through gathering materials, and when the vehicle was finished would be able to take it into battle to \"rampage\". They were also designed to interact with the zone's planned destructible buildings, with vehicles able to \"reduce the enemy base to rubble\". A range of vehicles were planned to be available, and players would also be able to gain control of Iron Horde vehicles in the area. Vehicles included the \"Incinerator\", and the \"Blade Mortar\", which would rain down \"old weapons\" and other deadly shrapnel.\nThe zone itself underwent substantial iteration and development over the course of the alpha and beta. The Kor'lok's Throne, originally named the Throne of the Ogre King, was once housed beneath the enormous skeleton of a giant, while the Amphitheater of Annihilation, originally named The Stadium, was once home to what appears to have been an &lt;a href=\"ogre%20mound\"&gt;ogre mound&lt;/a&gt;. The player cities also underwent substantial development.\nFor promotional images from the zone's initial presentation and iterative changes to its layout during alpha, see the Gallery, below. For screenshots of the zone during its beta and later development, see &lt;a href=\"Warlords%20of%20Draenor%20beta%20timeline\"&gt;Warlords of Draenor beta timeline&lt;/a&gt;.\nConflict avoidance.\nIn the weeks following the introduction of Ashran, a pattern emerged in the players tackling the zone: rather than seeking out conflict with the opposing faction, and struggling for control of the central lane, an \"implicit truce\" emerged which allowed players to maximise their Conquest Point and gear gains, while avoiding any encounters with other players. The convention led to all Alliance players gathering to push the central lane and repeatedly defeat the opposing faction leader; while all Horde players would gather in a roving party, visiting each secondary area in turn to win the events that took place there. While this was successful in allowing players to gain Conquest Points and upgrade their gear as quickly as possible, it also avoided most of the gameplay potential in the zone, and prevented players who wished to genuinely experience the zone from doing so; since each faction stayed gathered in a single group, seeking conflict with the opposite faction meant venturing off solo or in a small group to tackle the entire opposite faction at once, generally leading to almost instant death.\nIn late January the developers sought to address this through increasing the length of time after a faction leader kill before the zone reset to 30 minutes. &lt;a href=\"Zarhym\"&gt;Zarhym&lt;/a&gt; explained that the intention behind this change was to encourage the faction which had defeated the faction leader (by convention, the Alliance) to venture into the zone's other areas during those 30 minutes. As a result, Alliance players may vie for the secondary area events, which may in turn lead to Horde players returning to the central lane. Thus, it was hoped that more direct PvP encounters would result, with the consequence that faction presence in the zone was evened out.\nHowever, by late February it was clear this change had not achieved the desired results. In &lt;a href=\"http%3A//us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/16411211961%235\"&gt;a post&lt;/a&gt; on the forums, &lt;a href=\"Brian%20Holinka\"&gt;Brian Holinka&lt;/a&gt; explained that the zone's problems were due in part to the design of the reward system; players were able to obtain equal rewards through two primary and quite separate means: faction leaders and secondary area events. As a result, players quickly found that they could earn their rewards far more easily and reliably through avoiding conflict than through seeking it. Holinka cited this as a design failure, stating \"This setup does not encourage competition. It encourages collusion.\"\nIn order to dissolve this truce and encourage the occupants of the zone to return to less peaceful relations, in &lt;a href=\"Patch%206.1.0\"&gt;Patch 6.1.0&lt;/a&gt; Conquest Points were removed from the faction leaders. As a result, the designers hope that in order to acquire Conquest Points, Alliance players will once again seek out success in the secondary area events; in turn driving the Horde to return to the central lane, where they would have a chance to even the score for the event rewards stolen from them by the returning Alliance players. The interim period of 30 minutes was also reduced to 10 minutes, encouraging central lane participation.\nLess critically, the patch brought refinements and a number of simplifications to the zone. Several scrolls and wands were removed from the game, as were the &lt;a href=\"Ashmaul%20Pearl\"&gt;Ashmaul Pearl&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ghost%20Truffle\"&gt;Ghost Truffle&lt;/a&gt;s which were previously found in certain areas of the zone, the alchemist potions once awarded in exchange for their collection now made available for Artifact Fragments. More importantly, 6.1 also saw changes to the queueing problems which had plagued the zone since its launch on live servers, with the aim of substantially reducing waiting times.\nNew area, new buffs, new quests.\n&lt;a href=\"Patch%206.2\"&gt;Patch 6.2&lt;/a&gt; saw substantial developments to the zone, most obviously in the form of the first expansion to the zone, with the addition of the Ashran Excavation secondary area. Prior to this, each faction's mine entrance had been boarded up \"while work goes on inside\", with guard NPCs posted outside. NPC discussions has also hinted at expansion in the mines. \nThe patch also saw some more fundamental adjustments: the capacity of the zone was reduced to 40, with additional instances added to compensate; and new buffs were added, granting increasing benefits whenever a faction repeatedly loses at an event. In addition, players were for the first time automatically placed in a raid group upon joining the area. This was a notable change, following the repeated intentions of the developers since the expansion's beta to have players experience the zone in a freer, less structured way, and without the pressure to engage in a common goal they felt would result from an automatic raid group. Prior to this patch, players would commonly request invitations in /1, with a substantial amount of communication and distraction necessary in order to manage the group's membership, and many players engaged in battle without being part of a group. The zone also frequently saw multiple groups for each faction.\nOther changes came in the form of related quests, as part of a continued effort to encourage more direct engagement between the two factions within the zone. In &lt;a href=\"http%3A//us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/18194814924%3Fpage%3D3%2343\"&gt;a forum post&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Brian%20Holinka\"&gt;Brian Holinka&lt;/a&gt; admitted that \"there hasn't been enough fighting in Ashran\", explaining that the availability of the same rewards through various means, in combination with the tendency to find the quickest and easiest route to a reward, had led players to engage in PvE activities instead of the more challenging PvP alternatives. To counter this, Conquest Points were made available only through two new quests - one for killing the enemy faction leader and completing four events, the other for killing 200 players - both activities forcing players into fairly direct conflict with the opposite faction.\nThe new buffs were also aimed to encourage engagement, specifically aiming to counter the tendency of a faction following defeat to give up on the battle and \"go their separate ways\", avoiding engaging the opposite faction. The buffs were intended to help rebuild confidence following repeated losses, as well as the numbers necessary to compete in the larger battles.\nIn reference to a common perception by Horde players of being outnumbered, Holinka pointed out that the zone was strictly faction balanced, with precisely matching numbers of players from each faction in the zone at all times, but noted that as of June 2015, there were \"a lot more\" Alliance players queuing to enter Ashran.\nJuly 2015 saw the Ancient Artifact hotfixed to only appear when there are more than 20 players on each team. It was also given a respawn timer, instead of immediately reappearing. The former change specifically tackled the disproportionate importance of the Artifact in small groups, with possession of it often considered to determine control of the zone, especially in instances with as few as 5 players on each side.\nRemoved features.\nZone drops.\nThe following zone drops were removed with &lt;a href=\"Patch%206.1.0\"&gt;Patch 6.1.0&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlchemists' ingredients.\nUntil &lt;a href=\"Patch%206.1.0\"&gt;Patch 6.1.0&lt;/a&gt;, players could not directly purchase the &lt;a href=\"Vintage%20Free%20Action%20Potion\"&gt;Vintage Free Action Potion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Phantom%20Potion\"&gt;Phantom Potion&lt;/a&gt;, but instead had to gather special ingredients from around Ashran, which could then be traded with each faction's alchemist - &lt;a href=\"Gimlet%20Ginfizz\"&gt;Gimlet Ginfizz&lt;/a&gt; for Alliance, &lt;a href=\"Tyra%20Silverblood\"&gt;Tyra Silverblood&lt;/a&gt; for Horde - in exchange for the potions."}

In essence, to get the most out of this Trinket, it is desirable to have short cast times coupled with high crit. chance.\nThe formula for calculating how much Spell Haste one can expect from this trinket on average is as follows:\n E = 145 * (6 / (t / (0.5 * c)))\nWhere...\n E = effective +spell haste\n t = cast time\n c = critical strike chance\nThe following Java program can be used to obtain a table of expected +haste for different cast times:\n public static void main(String[] args)\n float crit;\n float time;\n float effective;\n for(time = 1; time &lt; 3.5f; time += 0.5f)\n for(crit = 20; crit &lt; 55; crit += 5)\n effective = 145 * (6 / (time / (0.5f * (crit / 100))));\n System.out.println(\"&lt;tr&gt;\");\nAn important thing to note is that given a high enough Critical Strike chance, coupled with a low enough Cast Time, it is possible that the time required to proc this trinket is shorter than it's duration, in which case the Trinket is perpetually up - in the tables above, such a state is represented by the effective +Haste being &gt;= 145."}

In \"Warcraft III\", Akama's tribe had the appearance of Lost Ones. It consists of the most vicious and bloodthirsty individuals, handpicked by &lt;a href=\"Akama\"&gt;Akama&lt;/a&gt; himself. Akama relays his orders through &lt;a href=\"Oronu%20the%20Elder\"&gt;Oronu the Elder&lt;/a&gt;. These orders include looting the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Baa%27ri\"&gt;Ruins of Baa'ri&lt;/a&gt; and further corrupting the environment of &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Valley\"&gt;Shadowmoon Valley&lt;/a&gt;.\nAshtongue Deathsworn.\nThe Ashtongue Deathsworn are a subdivision of the Ashtongue tribe, ostensibly the vilest and most brutal of the tribe. In actuality, the evil members of the Ashtongue \"are\" amongst the most evil Broken known, but only as a front to maintain the facade that the Deathsworn need to present to Illidan. The Deathsworn know of Akama's true intentions.\nFate.\nWhile the evil members are presumably slaughtered, Akama frees several non-Deathsworn members of the tribe from Illidan's control after the &lt;a href=\"Shade%20of%20Akama\"&gt;Shade of Akama&lt;/a&gt; is killed. They take over the central platform of the &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary%20of%20Shadows\"&gt;Sanctuary of Shadows&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen a &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; infiltrates Black Temple to hunt down the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20the%20Black%20Harvest\"&gt;Council of the Black Harvest&lt;/a&gt;, Ashtongue workers can be seen working on the broken siege engines in the large courtyard that once housed &lt;a href=\"Supremus\"&gt;Supremus&lt;/a&gt;. It is unclear if the Broken are dismantling or repairing the machines.\nAkama tells the warlock that though they are working on it, it will be many years before the Temple is restored from the destruction of &lt;a href=\"Magtheridon\"&gt;Magtheridon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Illidan\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe broken draenei now refers to themselves as the Ashtongue Brotherhood.\nA group of Ashtongue were summoned to &lt;a href=\"Mardum\"&gt;Mardum&lt;/a&gt; during the events of \"The Burning Crusade\" to help Illidan's elite demon hunters procure the &lt;a href=\"Sargerite%20Keystone\"&gt;Sargerite Keystone&lt;/a&gt;. Remaining on Mardum afterwards, they were never made aware of Akama's rebellion and remain loyal to the Illidari aboard &lt;a href=\"The%20Fel%20Hammer\"&gt;The Fel Hammer&lt;/a&gt;. Akama himself later rejoins the Illidari."}

The largest of its kind in &lt;a href=\"Tiragarde%20Sound\"&gt;Tiragarde Sound&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"foundry\"&gt;foundry&lt;/a&gt; produces most of the &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt; weapons and ammunition that the Company have recently begun smuggling into the capital or arming &lt;a href=\"pirate\"&gt;pirate&lt;/a&gt;s with. It is also responsible for supplying the &lt;a href=\"Ashvane%20Chemist\"&gt;Ashvane chemists&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Bridgeport\"&gt;Bridgeport&lt;/a&gt; with Azerite to continue researching the substance.\nHistory.\nThe Ashvane Foundry today serves as the Company's main manufacturing plant on &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;, with large forges and warehouses for the processing of many products. With the emergence of &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt;, the foundry's focus was quickly shifted to the strange and powerful substance. Lady &lt;a href=\"Priscilla%20Ashvane\"&gt;Priscilla Ashvane&lt;/a&gt; directed all efforts towards harnessing this power, and Azerite weapons and explosives were soon being churned out of the factory on a large scale. This was done without the knowledge of the authorities of &lt;a href=\"House%20Proudmoore\"&gt;House Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the time, &lt;a href=\"Forgemaster%20Farthing\"&gt;Forgemaster Farthing&lt;/a&gt; directly oversaw weapons and munitions production, while &lt;a href=\"Taskmaster%20Williams\"&gt;Taskmaster Williams&lt;/a&gt; ensured that all workers were kept in line by any means necessary. Workers were forced to work exhausting hours, and attempts at strike action were brutally suppressed. Even children were employed as laborers in the foundry, snatched from the streets of Boralus and deported to the plant. Much of the processed Azerite was sent on to the Company's chemical workshops in Bridgeport, where it was further refined and researched.\nAs more Azerite was shipped to the Ashvane Foundry for further processing, the weapons produced were smuggled through &lt;a href=\"Bridgeport\"&gt;Bridgeport&lt;/a&gt; and on to destinations across &lt;a href=\"Tiragarde%20Sound\"&gt;Tiragarde Sound&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href=\"Boralus\"&gt;Boralus&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Irontide%20Raiders\"&gt;Irontide&lt;/a&gt; pirates of &lt;a href=\"Freehold\"&gt;Freehold&lt;/a&gt;. In this way, the foundry provided much of the armaments for the eventual coup planned by Lady Ashvane. The weapons used by pirates to breach &lt;a href=\"Daelin%27s%20Gate\"&gt;Daelin's Gate&lt;/a&gt; some time later were Ashvane-produced in the foundry.\nEventually, an investigation led by &lt;a href=\"Taelia\"&gt;Taelia&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Proudmoore%20Guard\"&gt;Proudmoore Guard&lt;/a&gt;, along with &lt;a href=\"Flynn%20Fairwind\"&gt;Flynn Fairwind&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;emissary&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, uncovered the work going on at the Ashvane Foundry. Having infiltrated the facility, they slew the Forgemaster and Taskmaster, rescued many of the urchins being forced to work, and determined Lady Ashvane's plans for the Azerite. This information would ultimately lead them to Bridgeport, and then Freehold to the south.\nAfter Ashvane's attempted coup in Boralus failed, the Ashvane Foundry was ordered to cease all weapons production by the &lt;a href=\"Proudmoore%20Admiralty\"&gt;Proudmoore Admiralty&lt;/a&gt;. After the decree was ignored, Alliance agents were sent to the site to forcibly halt production, and further disrupted the operation there.\nKul Tiran forces under the command of &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Serafina\"&gt;Captain Serafina&lt;/a&gt; eventually managed to kick the Ashvanes out. Later, the Horde attacked the Kul Tiran garrison for their uniforms."}

The company involves itself in a large number of ventures, including weapons manufacturing, shipping, security, smuggling, and piracy, among others. Characterized by its ruthless business practices and disregard for moral and lawful conduct, the Ashvane Company sits atop a vast criminal empire, hoarding power and profit on a grand scale.\nThe beginning of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt; and the appearance of &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt; have both presented major opportunities for the organization. Under the leadership of Lady &lt;a href=\"Priscilla%20Ashvane\"&gt;Priscilla Ashvane&lt;/a&gt;, the company allied with the &lt;a href=\"Irontide%20Raiders\"&gt;Irontide Raiders&lt;/a&gt; and other &lt;a href=\"pirate\"&gt;pirate&lt;/a&gt;s, while secretly plotting a coup against &lt;a href=\"House%20Proudmoore\"&gt;House Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;. This would culminate in the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Boralus\"&gt;Siege of Boralus&lt;/a&gt;, which saw the company and its allies defeated. Despite these setbacks, the Ashvane Company retains numerous holdings across Kul Tiras and beyond.\nHistory.\nIt is unknown when exactly the Ashvane Trading Company was founded, though by the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; it was a major producer of weapons and ammunition for the Kul Tiran navy.\nBy the time of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the Ashvane Company enjoyed a monopoly on many areas of &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;'s economy, particularly within &lt;a href=\"Boralus\"&gt;Boralus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tiragarde%20Sound\"&gt;Tiragarde Sound&lt;/a&gt;. This was advanced by Lady &lt;a href=\"Priscilla%20Ashvane\"&gt;Priscilla Ashvane&lt;/a&gt;'s personal relationship with Lord Admiral &lt;a href=\"Katherine%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Katherine Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, which granted the company political influence and the ability to act with impunity. The company took a strong interest in the newly-discovered &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt;, which it researched and quickly weaponized for its own ends.\nWhen Lady &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; returned to Kul Tiras on behalf of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, it was Priscilla Ashvane who pushed for a sentence of death for high treason. With Katherine Proudmoore's consent, the Ashvane Company took Jaina into custody, eventually delivering her to pirates to be shipped to &lt;a href=\"Fate%27s%20End\"&gt;Fate's End&lt;/a&gt;. Members of Jaina's party were also taken and sent to &lt;a href=\"Tol%20Dagor\"&gt;Tol Dagor&lt;/a&gt;, a private offshore prison operated by the Ashvane Company. These inmates would later be liberated in a prison revolt.\nAt the same time, in secret, Lady Ashvane planned to use the wealth and power of the company to eventually seize control of Boralus. She secretly allied her organization with the &lt;a href=\"Irontide%20Raiders\"&gt;Irontide Raiders&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Harlan%20Sweete\"&gt;Harlan Sweete&lt;/a&gt;, based in &lt;a href=\"Freehold\"&gt;Freehold&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"pirate\"&gt;pirate&lt;/a&gt;s were armed with company-made Azerite weapons and sent against the &lt;a href=\"House%20Proudmoore\"&gt;House Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; defenders in the region. Though Ashvane and her company worked to undermine her power, Lord Admiral Katherine and the wider populace remained largely oblivious to this treachery.\nAn investigation, headed by &lt;a href=\"Taelia\"&gt;Taelia&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Proudmoore%20Guard\"&gt;Proudmoore Guard&lt;/a&gt;, Captain &lt;a href=\"Flynn%20Fairwind\"&gt;Flynn Fairwind&lt;/a&gt;, and an &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;emissary&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; slowly uncovered the Ashvane Company's dealings, as well as their plans to seize power. Together, they seriously disrupted operations at the &lt;a href=\"Ashvane%20Foundry\"&gt;Ashvane Foundry&lt;/a&gt; and struck at the pirates of Freehold. They also discovered that Lady Ashvane had hired the Irontide to assault &lt;a href=\"Daelin%27s%20Gate\"&gt;Daelin's Gate&lt;/a&gt; and break into Tiragarde Sound. With the company's new Azerite weaponry, the pirates easily breached the gate's defenses, but were fought off by Kul Tiran forces.\nArmed with evidence of the treachery of Lady Ashvane and her company, Taelia and her allies returned to Boralus to warn the Lord Admiral. Confronting Priscilla before an assembly in &lt;a href=\"Unity%20Square\"&gt;Unity Square&lt;/a&gt;, Taelia revealed the gathered evidence, causing Ashvane herself to flee. Lady Ashvane escaped the scene, as company loyalists and city guards clashed throughout the area. In the wake of the incident, Lady Ashvane prepared for her next move against Boralus. Possibly due to its power and influence, the Ashvane Company itself was not shut down outright; it was, however, ordered to cease all weapons production, an order which it blatantly ignored.\nLater, Katherine Proudmoore ordered the offices of the company within Boralus to be raided, in search of information on her missing daughter, &lt;a href=\"Jaina\"&gt;Jaina&lt;/a&gt;. As Katherine ventured to the &lt;a href=\"Blighted%20Lands\"&gt;Blighted Lands&lt;/a&gt; to rescue Jaina, the Ashvane Company gathered its strength for a major attack on Boralus itself. The Lord Admiral and her daughter arrived back in the city to find it under siege by Company and pirate forces. With the help of Alliance &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;heroes&lt;/a&gt;, the city's defenders cut through their enemies and drove them from Boralus. A second wave of ships, led by Lady Ashvane herself, soon advanced on the &lt;a href=\"Boralus%20Harbor\"&gt;harbor&lt;/a&gt;. Too weak to fend off another assault, Boralus's final hope lay with Jaina, who successfully summoned the &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiran%20fleet\"&gt;Kul Tiran fleet&lt;/a&gt; home in time to confront the Ashvane armada.\nOutnumbered and outgunned, Lady Ashvane and her forces surrendered, decisively ending their plans on Boralus. Despite the loss of their leader and much of their strength, the Company remained active in &lt;a href=\"Tiragarde%20Sound\"&gt;Tiragarde Sound&lt;/a&gt;, particularly in harvesting Azerite from open wounds in the region. The Alliance and Kul Tiran forces seized many of the Azerite weapons for their own usage.\n&lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; later ordered the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; to free Lady Ashvane from prison \u2014 presumably to work out some sort of alliance. Her loyalists joined together at &lt;a href=\"Freehold\"&gt;Freehold&lt;/a&gt;. Lady Ashvane however, eventually revealed she had aligned herself with &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt; and had been supplying her &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt; weapons. Although she was protected by Azshara from the wrath of the Horde and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, Azshara turned &lt;a href=\"Priscilla%20Ashvane\"&gt;Priscilla Ashvane&lt;/a&gt; into a sea monster and she was eventually slain during the adventurers' raid on Azshara's &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Palace\"&gt;Eternal Palace&lt;/a&gt;.\nPresence.\nThe Ashvane Trading Company maintains offices and installations across &lt;a href=\"Tiragarde%20Sound\"&gt;Tiragarde Sound&lt;/a&gt; and beyond, with its headquarters located in the &lt;a href=\"Ashvane%20Company%20Yards\"&gt;Ashvane Company Yards&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Boralus\"&gt;Boralus&lt;/a&gt;.

She wielded the sacred staff called &lt;a href=\"T%27uure%2C%20Beacon%20of%20the%20Naaru\"&gt;T'uure&lt;/a&gt; until her death at the hands of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Shar%27gel\"&gt;Battle of Shar'gel&lt;/a&gt;, where she and seventy other defenders sacrificed themselves to stall the Legion's onslaught and allow their kin to flee to safety.\nBiography.\nOn &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;, homeworld of the &lt;a href=\"eredar\"&gt;eredar&lt;/a&gt;, Askara lived in &lt;a href=\"Eredath\"&gt;Eredath&lt;/a&gt;. An echo of her can still be found there at the &lt;a href=\"Circle%20of%20Aspirants\"&gt;Circle of Aspirants&lt;/a&gt;, watching a &lt;a href=\"jed%27hin\"&gt;jed'hin&lt;/a&gt; match. She comments on how there is no need to worry about the wrestlers' heads, for only males with the thickest crests choose to compete and the current competitors are the best Eredath has to offer.\nAskara lost her entire family in the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;'s flight from Argus, but she found a new one with the draenei &lt;a href=\"refugee\"&gt;refugee&lt;/a&gt;s aboard the \"&lt;a href=\"Oshu%27gun\"&gt;Genedar&lt;/a&gt;\". Seeing the draenei as her brothers and sisters, she vowed to do whatever she could to protect them. While she lacked physical strength or a talent for forging armaments, her mastery over the holy magic of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; became so great that the draenei leader himself, the &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Prophet Velen&lt;/a&gt;, gave the holy artifact known as &lt;a href=\"%3AT%27uure%2C%20Beacon%20of%20the%20Naaru\"&gt;:T'uure, Beacon of the Naaru&lt;/a&gt; to her. Askara spent her every waking hour studying the artifact to unlock its extraordinary potential. During this time, she received a vision of the future, showing her people finding peaceful sanctuary from the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; on a new world, but strangely, she did not see herself there.\nAs the Legion continued to relentlessly pursue the draenei, never allowing them a safe haven, many of the refugees began to fall prey to depression and pessimism. Askara sought them out and spoke to them of their troubles, T'uure casting an aura of holy energy around her that lifted her kin's spirits.\nThe Battle of Shar'gel.\nThe draenei eventually reached a world called &lt;a href=\"Shar%27gel\"&gt;Shar'gel&lt;/a&gt;, believing that they had finally found a safe place to settle. However, they had barely set foot on the planet before demonic portals opened all around them, cutting off their retreat to the \"Genedar\". Askara planted herself between her people and the demons and held T'uure high, unleashing a storm of light that blinded the Legion's minions and shielded the draenei from their blades. As the draenei battled their way to the \"Genedar\", T'uure grew brighter and brighter until it shone \"like a second sun on Shar'gel\". During the battle, Askara realized that she was destined to die on Shar'gel so that her people could escape to one day find a new home. Along with seventy other draenei, the priestess volunteered to stay behind and distract the Legion while the rest of their kin escaped the world. Despite hundreds of demons smashing into the seventy-one defenders, none of them ever gave ground, and every time a draenei teetered on the brink of death, Askara charged through the battle lines and mended their wounds with T'uure. The Battle of Shar'gel is today remembered as one of the greatest instances of self-sacrifice in draenei history.\nAfter the battle, T'uure fell into the hands of the Legion, who attributed Askara's immense power to the artifact she wielded. Legion forces squabbled over control of the relic until &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; decreed that it would go to &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Calindris\"&gt;Lady Calindris&lt;/a&gt;, an eredar priestess with an intimate knowledge of T'uure and the holy magics of the draenei."}

Any talents that affected Aspect of the Hawk or Aspect of the Monkey also affected Aspect of the Dragonhawk.\nNotes.\nAspect of the Dragonhawk was meant to be a replacement for both &lt;a href=\"Aspect%20of%20the%20Hawk\"&gt;Aspect of the Hawk&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Aspect%20of%20the%20Monkey\"&gt;Aspect of the Monkey&lt;/a&gt;. Because hunters often switched from Aspect of the Hawk to Aspect of the Monkey when they engaged in melee combat, the intent of this new skill was to remove the &lt;a href=\"global%20cooldown\"&gt;global cooldown&lt;/a&gt; penalty by merging these two aspects into a single one. \nAspect of the Dragonhawk replaced Aspect of the Hawk completely for PVE use - rank 1 of Dragonhawk was an upgrade to the highest rank (8) of Aspect of the Hawk.\nTips and tactics.\nIn any situation where Aspect of the Hawk or Aspect of the Monkey would normally be used, Aspect of the Dragonhawk will replace both. Instead of having to cycle between three Aspects in a PVP encounter, you can now use Aspect of the Dragonhawk continuously until mana regeneration is needed, at which point you should use &lt;a href=\"Aspect%20of%20the%20Viper\"&gt;Aspect of the Viper&lt;/a&gt;."}

He was blinded while in captivity, but he and his surviving friends were later freed by &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Walker\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt;s and chose to stay in Maldraxxus for a time to help the Maw Walkers' allies in the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20the%20Chosen\"&gt;House of the Chosen&lt;/a&gt; before returning home to &lt;a href=\"Bastion\"&gt;Bastion&lt;/a&gt;.\nThales serves as a &lt;a href=\"quest%20giver\"&gt;quest giver&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxus%20storyline\"&gt;Maldraxxus storyline&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nAlongside many other kyrian, Thales was captured during the House of Constructs and &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Rituals\"&gt;House of Rituals&lt;/a&gt;' attack on the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Courage\"&gt;Temple of Courage&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Bastion\"&gt;Bastion&lt;/a&gt; and taken to the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Constructs%20%28subzone%29\"&gt;Construct stronghold&lt;/a&gt; in Maldraxxus. Most of the other aspirants were dismembered on arrival, but the lead surgeon decided that the only thing worth taking from Thales were his eyes. After being blinded, Thales was left to rot in a pile of corpses in the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Chains\"&gt;Hall of Chains&lt;/a&gt;. After allowing themselves to be captured by the Constructs and brought to the Hall of Chains as well, a &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Walker\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt; encountered Thales and helped him free his fellow survivors, of which there were only four left\u2014the Ascended &lt;a href=\"Kynthia\"&gt;Kynthia&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"steward\"&gt;steward&lt;/a&gt;s &lt;a href=\"Hipokos\"&gt;Hipokos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kou\"&gt;Kou&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Koa\"&gt;Koa&lt;/a&gt;\u2014as well as &lt;a href=\"Secutor%20Mevix\"&gt;Secutor Mevix&lt;/a&gt;, the Maw Walker's ally from the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20the%20Chosen\"&gt;House of the Chosen&lt;/a&gt;. Thales and the Maw Walker subsequently dispatched the three individuals overseeing the Constructs' experiments on kyrian bodies before meeting up with Mevix and stewards. While Mevix wanted to thin the enemy's numbers, Thales simply wanted to spare his fallen kin from being turned into &lt;a href=\"abomination\"&gt;abomination&lt;/a&gt;s and sent the Maw Walker and the stewards to gather nearby kyrian corpses so he could send them off.\nWith the help of &lt;a href=\"Salvaged%20Praetor\"&gt;a praetor&lt;/a&gt; repaired by Hipokos, the Maw Walker and Mevix broke into the &lt;a href=\"Flesh%20Stitchery\"&gt;Flesh Stitchery&lt;/a&gt; and killed &lt;a href=\"First%20Apprentice%20Malkrex\"&gt;First Apprentice Malkrex&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sharrex%20the%20Fleshcrafter\"&gt;Sharrex the Fleshcrafter&lt;/a&gt; while they were working on a &lt;a href=\"Soulfused%20Construct\"&gt;Soulfused Construct&lt;/a&gt; made out of kyrian bodies. Mevix wanted to destroy the abomination, but Thales intervened as he could sense that the souls of his fellow kyrian still existed within the construct. The group instead climbed up on the construct's back, with Thales soothing the souls within while the Maw Walker directed the abomination's actions to wreak havoc on the House of Constructs\u2014including by killing &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Halis\"&gt;Baron Halis&lt;/a&gt;\u2014and then escape to &lt;a href=\"Spider%27s%20Watch\"&gt;Spider's Watch&lt;/a&gt;, where the Maw Walker's display of power awakened the &lt;a href=\"Rune%20of%20Might\"&gt;Rune of Might&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Blade%20of%20the%20Primus\"&gt;the runeblade&lt;/a&gt; they carried. Afterward, Thales thanked the hero for showing him what courage is and stated that he and his friends would recuperate at Spider's Watch until they found a way to return to Bastion.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20the%20Primus\"&gt;Seat of the Primus&lt;/a&gt; was attacked by the forces of &lt;a href=\"Vyraz\"&gt;Baron Vyraz&lt;/a&gt;, Thales, the stewards, and the Soulfused Construct helped defend it alongside the Maw Walker's &lt;a href=\"Necrolord%20Covenant\"&gt;necrolord&lt;/a&gt; allies. After the battle was won, Thales and the stewards relocated inside, with the aspirant stating that he hoped the taking of the Seat would give both Bastion and Maldraxxus time to heal.\nThales was later present for the kyrian and necrolord attack on the House of Constructs. After the battle of &lt;a href=\"Desmotaeron\"&gt;Desmotaeron&lt;/a&gt;, the aspirant and the other former Construct captives returned to the Seat of the Primus to witness &lt;a href=\"Draka\"&gt;Draka&lt;/a&gt;'s promotion ceremony. During the event, Thales could be seen seemingly tending to one of the &lt;a href=\"Liberated%20Forsworn\"&gt;Liberated Forsworn&lt;/a&gt; that heroes had brought from Desmotaeron.\nThe aspirant and his friends finally returned to Bastion. They were present in &lt;a href=\"Elysian%20Hold\"&gt;Elysian Hold&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Kyrestia%20the%20Firstborne\"&gt;the Archon&lt;/a&gt;'s announcement of the new &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Devotion\"&gt;Temple of Devotion&lt;/a&gt;. During &lt;a href=\"Adrestes\"&gt;Adrestes&lt;/a&gt;' promotion ceremony at the &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20the%20Archon\"&gt;Seat of the Archon&lt;/a&gt;, Thales thanked the Maw Walker for saving him from Maldraxxus and for inspiring him not to give up. He also stated that he had bonded with Hipokos (whom &lt;a href=\"Mikanikos\"&gt;Mikanikos&lt;/a&gt; had taken on as his apprentice) and that he would likely continue to serve as the mute steward's voice, just as Hipokos would serve as Thales' eyes."}

When his &lt;a href=\"Visage%20Day\"&gt;visage day&lt;/a&gt; came, he chose the form of an earthen and he saw it fitting for a fledgling chronosmith. He also had &lt;a href=\"Ironormu%27s%20Vault\"&gt;a storage vault&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Passage%20of%20Time\"&gt;Passage of Time&lt;/a&gt;. As &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;sundered&lt;/a&gt;, Ironormu left &lt;a href=\"Chronosmith%27s%20Forge\"&gt;his forge&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Eon%27s%20Fringe\"&gt;Eon's Fringe&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Thaldraszus\"&gt;Thaldraszus&lt;/a&gt; as he departed the Dragon Isles. Over the next millennia, Ironormu traversed the &lt;a href=\"Alternate%20timeline\"&gt;timeways&lt;/a&gt;, carrying out his charge as a chronosmith. After the first &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; emerged from &lt;a href=\"Uldaman\"&gt;Uldaman&lt;/a&gt;, Ironormu realized he missed his earthen friends. After they established the &lt;a href=\"kingdom%20of%20Ironforge\"&gt;kingdom of Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;, Ironormu took on a dwarven form, left the chronosmiths in good order, and decided to retire in &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; where he remained for years to come, until the Dragon Isles reawakened and called the dragons home.\nWhen he came back, Ironormu flew over his vault in the mountains and saw it in disarray due to creatures from time rifts from alternate timelines. &lt;a href=\"Temporal%20Investigator%20Tempo\"&gt;Temporal Investigator Tempo&lt;/a&gt; requested Ironormu to assist him with the problems at Eon's Fringe, but Ironormu did not return to Tempo. When he arrived at his workshop, he found it locked under a time-lock that prevented entry and taken over by &lt;a href=\"fire%20elemental\"&gt;fire elemental&lt;/a&gt;s. At the same time, the &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Finduin%20Wryngrrlgulgll\"&gt;Finduin Wryngrrlgulgll&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Azmerloth\"&gt;Azmerloth&lt;/a&gt; came to him requesting help to repair his sword, &lt;a href=\"Seashellamayne\"&gt;Seashellamayne&lt;/a&gt;, and an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; sent by Tempo was to find the bronze dragon. In order to aid him and break the timelock, Ironus asked the adventurer to recharge his Chronohammer by defeating time-displaced creatures and destroying &lt;a href=\"Time%20Rift%20Arch\"&gt;time rifts&lt;/a&gt; at the Passage of Time. Since they were heading that way, Ironus also requested they bring him &lt;a href=\"Ironus%27s%20Prized%20Possessions\"&gt;his possessions&lt;/a&gt; from the vault. Once the time rifts would be dealt with, he planned to return them back to his vault. The adventurer returned back with the charged Chronohammer, and Ironormu calculated that it should be them to break the timelock. As the adventurer did it, the &lt;a href=\"Time-Locked%20Forgespawn\"&gt;forgespawn&lt;/a&gt; trapped there emerged and took Finduin's sword out of its hands and flew to the roof of &lt;a href=\"Everywhen%20Inn\"&gt;Everywhen Inn&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href=\"Slagnaros\"&gt;Slagnaros&lt;/a&gt; threatened to destroy Eon's Fringe below. As Ironus entered his workshop, he found &lt;a href=\"Extinguished%20Timeforge\"&gt;his timeforge extinguished&lt;/a&gt;, its core taken by Slagnaros.\nWith the workshop back in his possession, but the timeforge non-functional, Ironus had one last request - to get both, &lt;a href=\"%3AThe%20Heart%20of%20the%20Timeforge\"&gt;:The Heart of the Timeforge&lt;/a&gt; and Seashellamayne, from the elementals. The adventurer was successful in defeating the forgespawn and Slagnaros, and retrieving both items. With the Heart, Ironus restored his &lt;a href=\"timeforge\"&gt;timeforge&lt;/a&gt; and then repaired Seashellamayne. Grateful, Finduin invited Ironus and the adventurer to Azmerloth, but the dragon kindly refused. With his sword restored, Finduin left for Tempo, and Ironormu gave the &lt;a href=\"Kabluey\"&gt;last remaining fire elemental&lt;/a&gt; to the adventurer and granted them access to his old patterns.\nQuotes.\nGossip.\nGreetings, &lt;race&gt;.\nBy &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt;'s chin hair, why is there a timelock on me forge?\nFirst Finduin's sword gets swiped, and now the heart of me timeforge is gone! What a mess.\nDon't forget to check out me wares, &lt;name&gt;. I've got a few spare tools and several timelost patterns.\nBy Nozdormu's chin-hair, why is there a Time-Vortex surrounding my forge?!"}

Caught unaware and semi-drunk, the \"Sea King\"'s crew was easily defeated and tied. The \"Orca\" left with its loot and Ironpatch came to deal with the crew. He immediately executed &lt;a href=\"Adashe%20Flintwill\"&gt;Adashe Flintwill&lt;/a&gt;, captain of the \"Sea King\". Seeing this, his two tied brothers charged at the orc. Although they knocked him, the rest of the \"Killmongers crew bested them. Ironpatch then killed them as well.

This connection is what the Jailer sought to exploit, with what he was doing with the Sepulcher cascading outward from one Zereth to the next, until all were &lt;a href=\"Domination\"&gt;dominated&lt;/a&gt; by his power, the heart of the Shadowlands acting as a doorway to the heart of each cosmic force in turn, one after another bound to his will. His worry is that if the Jailer's actions left behind even the most imperceptible of cracks in the cosmic pattern of the First Ones, that it might grow, until the balance is prone to be shattered by another, seventh force."}

It is the process of creating movies about the game by capturing &lt;a href=\"gameplay\"&gt;gameplay&lt;/a&gt; and putting it together with music with editing software.\nNote: Recording gameplay (for example &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt; videos from \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\") isn't considered machinima. Machinima implies that a movie editing program has been used at some point.\nProduction.\nTo make WoW movies, one needs a couple of programs (most of them can be downloaded for free), a bit of time, and some creativity.\nFirst, you need to get some video capturing software from Fraps.com, Wegame.com (I prefer this one because it works well and its free), or Planetgamecam.com. For Mac OSX, you don't need separate software since video capture is built into the game. The next step to making your own WoW movie is the video editing software which, if you are using Windows XP, you already have and is called Windows Movie Maker. Or you can use &lt;a href=\"WoW%20Model%20Viewer\"&gt;WoW Model Viewer&lt;/a&gt;. For Mac OSX, you can use iMovie, which comes standard with your Mac.\nNow you have the software you need, next come up with an idea, capture some game play, edit it down, and add some music or voice overs. Next, upload your new WoW movie to sites like YouTube.com, Warcraftmovies.com, Machinima.com, or Google Video and you will be on the way to stardom.\nExternal links.\nBlizzard &amp; Machinima Law"}

At any time, you can have 120 macros that are available to all your characters on all servers within one &lt;a href=\"account\"&gt;account&lt;/a&gt;, and 18 other macros that are available to each specific character, for a total of 138 macros that each character has access to; since &lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;version 3.0&lt;/a&gt;, those \"native\" macros may be stored server-side. Additionally, addons may enable you to specify and use additional macros.\nA macro may also refer to some automated method (programmed keystrokes and/or mouse movements) to fight or repeat some action. Macros, if performed \"outside of the standard game client\" may be considered &lt;a href=\"cheating\"&gt;cheating&lt;/a&gt;. Don't be afraid though: Everything you can do with in-game macros is ok.\nIn the navigation box at the top right of this page, you will find links to macros deemed useful by the community for specific classes, as well as more general information concerning macro creation. The &lt;a href=\"UI%20Beginners%20Guide\"&gt;UI Beginners Guide&lt;/a&gt; may be a good place to start if you require a general introduction to the area; more macro-specific information can be found at &lt;a href=\"Macro%20API\"&gt;Macro API&lt;/a&gt;.\nEditing macros outside of WoW.\nNote: Macros are now held on the servers so this method may no longer have the desired effect.\nYou can edit macros outside of the game by editing the codice_1 and codice_2 files, containing account-wide and per-character macros respectively. Note that the macros should probably be numbered starting with 1 and continue to 36 on the account-wide macros; and starting with 16777217 and continue to 16777234 for your character-specific macros. They don't need to be in order from the beginning of the file. It is probably best to save at least one account-wide and one character-specific macro in the game before you create your own macro file, to be familiar with macro file structure and to be sure of the numbering of macros. When editing your macros outside the game, be sure to use a simple text editor that can save in the format, otherwise, you may run into formatting/character issues."}
{"id": "68909", "revid": "22514", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=68909", "title": "Macro (1.0)", "text": "\"\"'NOTE: This page is archived. The material herein was valid in pre-B.C. WoW; but most, if not all, has been discontinued, changed, or protected. For valid macro information, refer to &lt;a href=\"Making%20a%20macro\"&gt;Making a macro&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Useful%20macros\"&gt;Useful macros&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"UI%20beginner%27s%20guide\"&gt;UI beginner's guide&lt;/a&gt;.\n=Spells=\nCasting spells no longer requires the (Rank x). So you can now have a macro that says: codice_1, and it'll cast your highest rank of Holy Light. This macro will always cast the highest rank spell, and you will not be able to cast it on lower-level targets.\nSelf Cast Any Spell (without losing your target).\n /script CastSpellByName('Holy Light', 1)\nCasting Buffs.\nAdapted from the above code, this is designed to cast buffs. If an enemy is selected, you will cast the buff on yourself, if nothing is selected, you will cast the buff on yourself, if you are selected, you will cast the buff on yourself but if your ally is selected they will be buffed.\nExample\nThis macro will cast buffs on you unless an ally is selected (Mark of the Wild):\n /script if (UnitIsFriend(\"player\", \"target\") ) then CastSpellByName(\"Mark of the Wild\")\n else CastSpellByName(\"Mark of the Wild\", 1); end\nCast a spell based on target's class.\nYou'll need to target the person you want to buff first. Here's an example for a paladin to use; note that it should all be on one line:\n /script class = UnitClass(\"target\"); if ( ( class == \"Rogue\" ) or ( class == \"Warrior\" ) ) then\n CastSpellByName(\"Blessing of Might\"); else CastSpellByName(\"Blessing of Wisdom\"); end\nCast a spell based on target's level.\nYou'll need to target the person you want to buff first. Here's an example for a priest to use on an English language server. You have to alter the spell name according to the spell you want to cast and change i=6 by the number of ranks you currently have for that spell; note that it should all be on one line:\n /script Pre=\"Power Word: Fortitude(Rank \" Sp={1,2,14,26,38,50} if (UnitLevel(\"target\") ~= nil and UnitIsFriend(\"player\",\"target\")) then\n for i=6,1,-1 do if (UnitLevel(\"target\") &gt;= Sp[i]) then CastSpellByName(Pre..i..\")\") return end end end\nCast a healing spell on nearby friends.\nThis will target all your nearby friendly player characters in turn and cast a heal on the first one it comes to with a health level that is below a certain percentage of maximum (in this example 70%). Repeated calls to the macro will step through all nearby friends needing heals until it targets you. The macro checks the health of up to 40 nearby friendly player characters. If a call to this macro casts no heal then neither nearby friendly player characters nor yourself have a health level below the threshold of 70% of maximum.\n /script for i=1,40 do TargetNearestFriend(); \n if UnitHealth(\"target\")/UnitHealthMax(\"target\") &lt; 0.7 then\n if UnitIsPlayer(\"target\") then CastSpellByName(\"Lesser Healing Wave\") end end end; TargetLastEnemy();\nAnnouncing spells and targets to your party.\nGood for healing and crowd control spells. Example with a healing spell (Party member must be targeted first to make the party announcement work):\n /cast Healing Touch\n /party Healing %t in 3.5 seconds\nCast a spell on party member based on his location in party.\nThis will target the \"first\" member of your party, cast a healing spell on him, then return you to your previous target. To use on 2nd member of party change \"party1\" to \"party2\".\n /script TargetUnit(\"party1\")\n /cast Flash Heal\n /script TargetLastTarget()\nCast multiple buffs with smart buff recognition.\nThis script checks whether the target has a buff, if not you cast it, if so you cast a different buff.\n /script i=1;m=0;while(UnitBuff(\"target\",i)~=nil) do \n if(strfind(UnitBuff(\"target\",i),\"Regeneration\")~=nil) then m=1; end;i=i+1;end; c=CastSpellByName; \n if(m==1) then c(\"Mark of the Wild(Rank 10)\");else c(\"Thorns(Rank 10)\");end;\nModify the spell names to change the buff.\nFind Spell Number.\nSometimes using the &lt;a href=\"API%20CastSpellByName\"&gt;CastSpellByName&lt;/a&gt; function causes the script to exceed the 255 character limit. In such cases, it may be useful to reference the spell number as found within your spellbook and abilities. This script allows you to poke around looking for the spell number associated with a given spell. \nSpells are numbered beginning with all pages found in your general abilities, followed by all pages of your first talent tree then all pages of the second talent tree etc. If you learn new spells and have referenced spells by their number in a script, you may need to revisit this script to ensure you are casting the correct spell and rank.\nLine breaks (carriage returns or &lt;Enter&gt;) have been added for legibility only. When copied into WoW, make sure the script is one line only.\n /script SpellNumber=26; SpellName,SpellRank=GetSpellName(SpellNumber,\"spell\"); \n M=format(\"Spell %d: %s %s\",SpellNumber,SpellName,SpellRank); DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessage(M);\nOnce you have the spell number, use CastSpell(spellnumber,0) to cast it. For example if Inner Fire was spell number 17 in your spellbook (as determined using the script above), you could use /script CastSpell(17,0) to cast it. \nIf you want to ensure that it casts only on yourself, use /script CastSpell(17,0,1).\nImmediate Cast non-global cooldown Spell.\nSome spells, such as Amplify Curse and Divine Favor, don't activate the global cooldown, so it's possible to immediately follow them with another spell. However, the user interface waits for confirmation of the spellcasting action before allowing you to cast a second spell, which can result in a pause if your connection has some lag. This macro avoids the need for a confirmation by following up with SpellStopCasting, so you can cast a second spell immediately, regardless of lag. Note that if you don't have the listed spell (Divine Favor, in this example) in your spellbook, running this script will hang your client.\n /run --CastSpellByName(\"Divine Favor\")\n /run local a,i,s,t,j=CastSpellByName,0,\"spell\",\"Divine Favor\"repeat\n i=i+1;j=GetSpellName(i,s)until(j==t)j=GetSpellCooldown(i,s)if(j==0)then\n a(t)SpellStopCasting()end\nThe reason for the first line is so that the icon will show the current cooldown state for the spell correctly.\nThis macro can be easily modified to allow following it with another spell - append ;CastSpellByName(name_of_spell), and change the starting CastSpellByName to match so\nyou get the cooldown and in-range information for the final spell.\n /run --CastSpellByName(\"Curse of Agony\")\n /run local a,i,s,t,j=CastSpellByName,0,\"spell\",\"Amplify Curse\"repeat\n i=i+1;j=GetSpellName(i,s)until(j==t)j=GetSpellCooldown(i,s)if(j==0)then\n a(t)SpellStopCasting()end;CastSpellByName(\"Curse of Agony\")\n= Inventory/Items =\nEquip an item.\n /script PickupContainerItem(bag, slot); \nbag goes from 0 to 4, and slot from 1 to 20 (depending on bag size).\nFor more information, go to &lt;a href=\"Item%20equipping\"&gt;Item equipping&lt;/a&gt; to see how to use items from backpacks, etc., and information on how to prevent accidental vendoring of items due to macros.\nChange your boots to Globin Rocket Boots (by Gk-s2-).\nA really simple script made by myself who changes your boots anyboot you are using to Globin Rocket Boots.\nNote: Change the MainHandBag and MainBagSlot to where your item are located\nNote: This macro should be on one line.\n /script if ( not CursorHasItem() ) then PickupContainerItem(MainHandBag, MainBagSlot);\n PickupInventoryItem(8); PickupInventoryItem(8); PickupContainerItem(MainHandBag, MainBagSlot); end\nQuick Self-Bandage (by Domandred).\nPost-Patch 2.0\nConsult &lt;a href=\"Useful_macros%23Use_a_Bandage\"&gt;Use a Bandage&lt;/a&gt;.\nPre-Patch 2.0\n /target [Player Name]\n /script UseContainerItem(#, #);\n /script TargetLastEnemy();\nUse: Really nice macro for duels or 1v1 pvp. You can stun/fear your enemy, press this and it'll automatically bandage you without losing your target.\nProblem with macro above is losing combo points for rogues. This one will do the same thing without making you lose your combo points\n /script UseContainerItem(#, #)\n /script SpellTargetUnit(\"player\")\nAnother quick self-bandage from me, Kingoomie. Remember, one line.\n /script if (not GetContainerItemLink(x,x)) then OpenBag([same bag number as before]); else\n TargetUnit(\"player\");UseContainerItem(3,15);TargetUnit(\"playertarget\");if (UnitIsPlayer(\"target\"))\n then ClearTarget() end end\nChecks for an item in the slot, opens the bag if there isn't one, uses the item (bandage, in this case) on you, targets your last target, or targets nothing if you either didn't have a target or were targeting yourself.\nQuick Self-Bandage (by sjefen6).\nPost-Patch 2.0\nConsult &lt;a href=\"Useful_macros%23Use_a_Bandage\"&gt;Use a Bandage&lt;/a&gt;.\nPre-Patch 2.0\n /script TargetUnit(\"Player\")\n /script UseAction(ActionID);\n /script TargetLastEnemy();\nFor the ActionID, check out the table on the bottom of this chapter.\nIn Basic this does the same as \"Quick Self-Bandage by Domandred\", but finds the player automatically and uses ActionID instead of ContainerItem.\nUse a Bandage.\nPost-Patch 2.0\nIt is no longer necessary to reference consumables directly from bag and bag slot numbers. All that is required is for you to provide the name of the item by either manually typing it or linking it (Shift+Click). \nPre-Patch 2.0\n /script UseAction(ActionID, 0, 1); \n /script if( SpellIsTargeting() ) then SpellTargetUnit(\"player\"); end \nBandage must be placed in the action bar at the slot given by ActionID. ActionID is a number from 1 to 120. Slot1-ActionBar1 is ActionID1, Slot12 is ActionID12, Slot1-ActionBar2 is ActionID13 and so on up to Slot12 of ActionBar10. This will bandage your target, or yourself if your current target is not a friendly target.\nHere's a different version courtesy of post by &lt;a href=\"Sarf\"&gt;Sarf&lt;/a&gt; on the forums. This one will always self-bandage, even if you have a friendly player targeted. It will also re-target your original target. Note that this must all be on one line, its just split up for readability:\n /script p=\"player\";t=\"target\";if(not UnitCanAttack(t, p))then ot=UnitName(t);TargetUnit(p);else ot=nil;end;UseAction(ActionID);if(SpellIsTargeting())then SpellTargetUnit(p);end if(ot) then TargetByName(ot);end\nFollowing is another example of self bandaging that does not use scripting. THIS WILL WORK FOR COSMOS USERS ONLY. Shift-clicking on the bandage (or other item in inventory) while editing your macro will insert its name into your macro. Placing the \"target\" command after the \"use\" command maintains your primary target and also maintains your combo points for that target if you're a Rogue.\n /use Heavy Linen Bandage\n /target player\n /script for b=0,4 do for s=1,GetContainerNumSlots(b) do if (string.find(GetContainerItemLink(b,s) or \" \", \"Heavy Runecloth Bandage\")) then TargetUnit(\"player\"); UseContainerItem(b,s, onSelf); TargetUnit(\"playertarget\") b=4 break end end end\n\"Note: As of WoW UI version 1300, when you use the /target command use player not \"player\" to target yourself. Script command /target does NOT require Cosmos mod, but the /use command does.\"\nYou may experience problems with the script above, because it uses non-standard commands. If you place your Heavy bandage in the second ActionBar slot 5 you can use this small macro to use the bandage on your self. This works regardless of whether Cosmos (or any other mod) is installed.\n /script TargetUnit(\"player\");\n /script UseAction(17);\nYou have to use 17, because it is 2nd Actionbar and 5th slot ((2-1)*12+5=17).\nReference ActionID's:\n Actionbar \"Slot number\" \n 1: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12\n 2: 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24\n 3: 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36\n 4: 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48\n 5: 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60\n 6: 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72\nUse a Trinket/Item.\n /script UseInventoryItem(13)\nUse: Pops the trinket you have equipped in the first trinket slot. This way if you have several \"on use\" trinkets you can control any of them with a single button instead of creating multiple buttons for each trinket, as long as the trinket is in the appropriate slot. \nSharpen / Apply Poison to Weapon (by Arag).\n /script UseContainerItem (#,#);\n /script PickupInventoryItem (16);\nUse: Simply press a button and use a Sharpening or Weight stone, or apply a poison. Example: Press a button, sharpen your weapon. Change the 16 or 17 to do it for a secondary weapon. For the #'s on the first line, please refer to \"Understanding Location\" in section 6.\nSell all the poor items in your bags (by Haw).\nThis macro will sell your poor items, when used at a vendor.

One way to help your computer is to adjust the video settings to improve performance. You can put these macros into hot bars and bind to keys for easy switching, e.g. Shift-\\, \\, and Ctrl-\\ for High, Medium, and Low Res. These don't change the actual resolution of the screen, only the level of detail. low res is very good for the Auction House / Bank areas. Also, if your UI needs reset (the rendering isn't working), just switch from one to another.\n HighRes:\n /z SetFarclip(777)\n /z SetWorldDetail(2)\n /z SetBaseMip(1)\n MediumRes:\n /z SetFarclip(477)\n /z SetWorldDetail(1)\n /z SetBaseMip(1)\n LowRes:\n /z SetFarclip(177)\n /z SetWorldDetail(0)\n /z SetBaseMip(0)\nFull-screen to windowed mode.\nI found this handy for working on macros/scripts while having reference material next to me (ie these web pages and others ;). This will switch your game between full-screen, full-colour, and a smaller windowed mode. There are some assumptions, you need to replace the index numbers for your own setting - for me, I run WoW in 1600x1200 32bit full anti-aliasing when full-screen, 1024x768 16bit 1xanti-aliasing when in window. The index numbers can be calculated by going to video options and counting the items on the drop-down.\nNote: The bit between \"/script\" and \"/console\" must all be on one line (ie there should be a line starting \"/script\" and a line starting \"/console\" and that's it), it's broken up for readability.\n SwitchMode:\n /script currentRes = GetCurrentResolution(); if (currentRes == 3)\n then SetScreenResolution(15); SetCVar(\"gxWindow\", 0); SetMultisampleFormat(16);\n else SetCVar(\"gxWindow\", 1); SetScreenResolution(3); SetMultisampleFormat(1); end;\nReplace the \"15\" in SetScreenResolution with your selected high-res index, the \"16\" in SetMultisampleFormat with your selected colour depth/anti-aliasing, and the \"3\" in Set/GetScreenResolution with your preferred windowed res. To finish this one off, drop it into a popup button and go to key bindings, link in \"alt-enter\". That way, alt-enter will alternate between windowed and full-screen. You can also work in any of the above Farclip etc calls to further alter the settings between windowed and full-screen, depending on how your machine behaves - experiment and see.\nNote also, I'm using GetCurrentResolution. I'd rather use GetCVar(\"gxWindow\"), but I got very unreliable results from that - not sure why.\nToggle Name Display.\nI like to shut off player names when I take screen shots, so here is what I use:\n /script if ( GetCVar(\"UnitNamePlayer\") == \"1\" ) then SetCVar(\"UnitNamePlayer\",0) else SetCVar(\"UnitNamePlayer\",1) end\nAnd for shutting off the NPC names I use this:\n /script if ( GetCVar(\"UnitNameNPC\") == \"1\" ) then SetCVar(\"UnitNameNPC\",0) else SetCVar(\"UnitNameNPC\",1) end\nGlobal Tell Variable.\nIf you have multiple scripts that send tells (\"Sheeping Lynk\", \"Heal Lynk\", etc.) it may be useful to have each script reference a global variable that is changed by a single script. Kind of a \"click once, change em all\" scenario.\nThis script sets a global variable PR (Party/Raid) to an appropriate channel based on raid, party or solo membership.\nLine breaks (carriage returns or &lt;Enter&gt;) have been added for legibility only. When copied into WoW, make sure the script is one line only.\n /script if (GetNumRaidMembers() &gt; 0) then PR = \"Raid\"; elseif (GetNumPartyMembers() &gt; 0) \n then PR = \"Party\"; else PR = \"Say\"; end;\nIn your scripts, transpose \"Say\", \"Raid\", \"Party\" for PR.\n /script SendChatMessage(\"Lynk is a noob\",PR);\n\"Lynk - Gilneas\"\n= Combat =\nSelect and Auto-attack nearest enemy.\nThis macro is useful for all melee classes. Useful for selecting and auto attacking nearest target, equivalent of pressing Tab, then T by default key bindings with just one key stroke. Hit it multiple times to switch between engaged enemies. It's useful enough to rebind Tab or Space bar to it.\n /script AttackTarget();\n /script TargetNearestEnemy(); \nHelp Tank Character.\nIf you are in a group and fighting a larger group of enemies, and your group tank character is already fighting an enemy, you may not want to attack one which did not have Aggro yet. Select your group tank via key [F] and execute the following macro.\n /assist %t \n /script AttackTarget();\nIf you're a beginning macro user the above is ok, Better to skip the 'F' key\nand type in the player name in the above. Not sure the AttackTarget();\nis safe.\nA more advanced method of this is to pre-select a player as the \"main assist\" and have your macro assist that player throughout the duration of the party. The simple method is to replace %t with the name of that player and edit your macro when needed.\nMain assist also works for everyday group play, but editing a macro and typing in a player's name may not be possible in all situations. If you are willing to sacrifice two macros and action bar slots, you can automate things with the following two macros:\n ---- Set Main Assist ----\n /script LeaderPlayerName = UnitName(\"target\") or UnitName(\"party1\") or \"\";\n /script DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessage(\"######## Set main assist to: \" .. LeaderPlayerName);\n ---- Assist Main Assist Player ----\n /script AssistByName(LeaderPlayerName or UnitName(\"party1\") or UnitName(\"player\"));\n /script DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessage(\"######## Assisting \".. LeaderPlayerName .. \" with target \" .. (UnitName(\"target\") or \"NO TARGET\"));\nUse the \"Set\" macro when you have your main assist player selected and want to switch your assist macro to use that player. If no player is selected and you are in a party, the first other party member will be selected. If you are not in a party and not target is selected, you will assist yourself, which is somewhat redundant, but harmless.\nTo save macro and action bar space, you can combine the two macros in the following script. To set the main assist player, hold down the control key while activating this macro. The version that fits into a 255 character macro is given below and it is somewhat obfuscated:\n\"/script p=PAsi or\"\"u=UnitName;t=\"target\"c=IsControlKeyDown()if(c)then p=u(t)or u(\"party1\")or\"\"else AssistByName(p)end;DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessage(\"######## \"..(c and(\"Set assist: \"..p)or(\"Assisting \"..p..\" with \"..(u(t)or\"NO TARGET\"))))PAsi=p\nHere's the same script with extra spacing and punctuation added for clarity:\n ---- Main Assist Utility (Version 1.0.1 by Tiga) ----\n /script\n p=PAsi or\"\";\n u=UnitName;\n t=\"target\";\n c=IsControlKeyDown();\n if(c) then\n p=u(t) or u(\"party1\") or \"\"\n else\n AssistByName(p)\n end;\n DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessage(\"######## \"..\n (c and\n (\"Set assist: \"..p)\n or\n (\"Assisting \"..p..\" with \"..(u(t) or \"NO TARGET\"))));\n PAsi=p;\nAssist Main Tank/Main Assist.\nPre-Patch 2.0\nThis script sets your Main Tank or Main Assist for assists and assists the MT/MA all-in-one.\n /script if (IsAltKeyDown() and UnitIsFriend(\"player\",\"target\")) then MT=UnitName(\"target\");\n DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessage('MT Set: ['..MT..']'); elseif (MT ~= nil) then AssistByName(MT);\n else DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessage('Set MT Noob!'); end;\n\"Lynk - Gilneas\"\nPost-Patch 2.0\n\"Lynk - Gilneas\"\nTarget Memory.\nPre-Patch 2.0\nThe following macro memorizes players and mobs by name. Remembering mobs by name can be a problem if there are several with the exact same name in the area (you will often target the wrong mob). Because of this, this macro should only be used in PvP and when you are fighting a unique boss mob with unique sidekicks.\nTo have multiple memorized targets, edit the Tg1 variable name in the three places where it is mentioned. Note that the short version below uses \"ChatFrame1\" instead of \"DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME\" to save a few characters to allow for longer spell and skill names than Polymorph. The human-readable version is given below the compact/obfuscated version.\n\"/script t=Tg1 or\"\"c=IsControlKeyDown()if(c)then t=UnitName(\"target\")or\"\"else TargetByName(t)if(IsShiftKeyDown())then CastSpellByName('Polymorph')end end ChatFrame1:AddMessage(\"######## \"..(c and(\"Tg1 set to: \"..t)or(\"Targeting: \"..t)))Tg1=t\n ---- Target Memory Utility (Version 1.0.1 by Tiga) ----\n /script\n t=Tg1 or\"\"\n c=IsControlKeyDown()\n if(c) then\n t=UnitName(\"target\")or\"\"\n else\n TargetByName(t)\n if(IsShiftKeyDown()) then\n CastSpellByName('Polymorph')\n end\n end\n DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessage(\"######## \"..\n (c and\n (\"Tg1 set to: \"..t)\n or\n (\"Targeting: \"..t)))\n Tg1=t\nPost-Patch 2.0\nThis was tested on players and a pair of level 65 Ironforge Guards. There did not appear to be any confusion as to which target had been defined as the point of focus. \nConsistency of this macro varied between using the keyboard exclusively and keyboard mouse combinations dealing specifically with default bindings (e.g. ActionBar 1, Slot 4 using SHIFT+4 would switch you to ActionBar 4 and not execute the macro). \nAdjust the use of Control (CTRL), Alternate (ALT) and Shift (SHIFT) keys (not case sensitive) for your environment.\nKill totems.\nThis can be used to destroy any totem, and is obviously designed for &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s. Naturally you can change the last line to codice_2 which is especially good for someone with a wand. Whether it will fit in the same macro or not, I'm not certain, but you might also want to add lines to target Dark Iron Dwarf mines as well. I can't think of anything else like it. The following is from &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.livejournal.com/users/talashandy/\"&gt;Talashandy&lt;/a&gt;, cited by Alex &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.cosmosui.org\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.\n /target Totem\n /cast Moonfire(Rank 1)\nHere is a bit more programmy way of doing the same thing. Remember to remove the lines breaks.\n /script u=UnitName;\n s=strfind;\n t=\"target\";\n for i = 1,10,1 do TargetNearestEnemy()\n if (not UnitCanAttack(\"player\",t))then \n break;\n end;\n if ((s(u(t),\"Totem\") or s(u(t),\"Ward\")) and not s(UnitCreatureType(t),\"Human\")) then \n CastSpellByName(\"Shoot\");\n break;\n end;\n end;\nTimer.\nSimple script to track the time elapsed from a set point in time. \nIf you click the script without holding the Alt key first, you will receive an interface error. If you log off for whatever reason, your timer will be erased. Change \"Say\" to whatever channel you want \"Party\", \"Raid\", \"Guild\", etc.\nAbout script variables:\n= Pets =\nPet Attack.\n /script PetAttack();\nA useful extension of this is to have your pet begin assisting your main tank with one button. You could also add a fourth line that casts one of your spells so that you begin fighting too.\n /target player\n /assist\n /script PetAttack();\nAttack with Dash: \n /script PetAttack(); CastPetAction(4);\nPet Passive.\n /script PetPassiveMode();\nThis is really useful in a Scatter Shot macro:\n /script PetPassiveMode(); \n /cast Scatter Shot\nIf you use above macro when 5 mobs are attacking your pet at the same time, you pet just comes running to you, so all the mobs will be out of gun/bow range.\nIf you use the following macro, your pet will start attacking the first mob that attacks him (not the scattershotted one) and he should stay virtually in place.\n /script PetPassiveMode(); \n /cast Scatter Shot\n /script PetDefensiveMode();\nSummary of Commands.\n /script PetAggressiveMode();\n /script PetDefensiveMode();\n /script PetPassiveMode();\n /script PetFollow();\n /script PetAttack();\n /script PetStopAttack();\nand\n /script CastPetAction(X);\nwith X being a number on the pet's action bar (1, 2, 3...)\n= Miscellaneous =\nLocal Server time.\n /script hour,min=GetGameTime()\n /script DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessage(format(\"Server time is %s:%s\",hour,min));\nLocation.\n /script px,py=GetPlayerMapPosition(\"player\")\n /script DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessage(format(\"[ %s ] %s , %s\",GetZoneText(),px,py));\n\"Value will be between 0,0 (Top Left corner of current map) and 1,1 (Bottom Right)\n\"A variant that gives a value between 0 and 100, and reduces it to 1 decimal place:\n /script px,py=GetPlayerMapPosition(\"player\")\n /script DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessage(format(\"%s: %.1f, %.1f\",GetZoneText(),px*100,py*100));\nChange Action Bar Page.\n /script CURRENT_ACTIONBAR_PAGE = X;\n /script ChangeActionBarPage();\nUse: Replace \"X\" with the action bar page number, and by pressing this, it'll automatically change. Example: You have two of these, both set on the \"=\" on page 1 and 2, and have page 1's set to change to page 2, and vice versa. Whenever you press \"=\", it'll toggle between page 1 and 2.\nThe below macro one does the same thing as the one above, but without the need for two separate macros. It will just switch back and forth between action bar 1 and action bar 4.\n /script if (CURRENT_ACTIONBAR_PAGE == 1) then CURRENT_ACTIONBAR_PAGE = 4; else CURRENT_ACTIONBAR_PAGE = 1; end; ChangeActionBarPage();\nSay Quest Objectives.\n /script i = GetNumQuestLeaderBoards(); for j = 1, i, 1 do a1, a2, a3 = GetQuestLogLeaderBoard(j); SendChatMessage(a1, \"PARTY\"); end;\nUse: Sends your current quest objectives to your party. This way, you don't have to constantly type to party members how many of each creature you need to complete a quest.\nTurn In Quest Items.\n /script SelectGossipAvailableQuest(1); CompleteQuest(); GetQuestReward();\nUse: This is usable at almost any quest giver with a blue question mark. It's especially useful for doing &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20Residue\"&gt;Dark Iron Residue&lt;/a&gt; turn ins for &lt;a href=\"Thorium%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Thorium Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; faction. Some of these quest givers offer multiple quests. To have the macro select a quest besides the first one, simply change the number in the parentheses.\nGo to &lt;a href=\"Macros\"&gt;Macros&lt;/a&gt;\nGo to &lt;a href=\"Interface%20Customization\"&gt;Interface Customization&lt;/a&gt;"}

Whatever was left of Neltharion the Earth-Warder is long gone, his mind and soul corrupted and devoured by his &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt; masters. All this monstrous being desires is destruction, annihilation, and the end of all things.\"\nDescription.\nBefore the final fight, Deathwing will crash into the Maelstrom. The final stage of the raid begins when Deathwing\u2019s deformed body rises out of the Maelstrom to face off against the players in the final showdown with many phases. The first phase is moving around the isles around the Maelstrom. Players will have to fight his claws, wings, tail alone and the tentacles. Traveling around the isles is similar to the fight in the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20the%20Four%20Winds\"&gt;Throne of the Four Winds&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the second phase, the four dragon aspects will arrive and use their specific abilities to assist players to battle Deathwing. Players need to decide which aspect will help as they will not help at random. For example, &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt; can create a time-warp field to slow down Deathwing's molten missile attack. &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; can annihilate the small tentacles Deathwing calls upon. &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; both have their own abilities. And, &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; will use the artifact, the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt;, to join the battle. There is a certain amount of strategy to how you use their abilities, too, so they\u2019re not just a backdrop \u2014 it\u2019s actually a fairly critical mechanic in the fight.\nAbilities.\nThe Madness of Deathwing encounter carries a hard 15-minute &lt;a href=\"enrage%20%28boss%29\"&gt;enrage&lt;/a&gt; timer.\nStage One: The Final Assault.\nDeathwing assaults his enemies as long as he is attached to the platforms by his twisted limbs.\nStage Two: The Last Stand.\nAt 20% remaining health, Deathwing falls forward onto &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera's&lt;/a&gt; platform.\nAspects.\nThe Dragon Aspects assist in the fight against Deathwing. Each aspect channels Expose Weakness on their respective Limb Tentacles when Deathwing begins to cast Cataclysm. Expose Weakness increases the damage done to the Tentacle by 100%.\nEach Aspect also channels Concentration after the players destroy their respective tentacle, preventing the Aspect from assisting the players with their presence and their special powers. The Aspects resume assisting the players when Stage Two begins.\nStrategy.\n\"This fight is all about add control, raid DPS check, and planning out which platform you wish to start on, as once you kill the disformed part of Deathwing on any platform, you lose the buffs granted by the Dragon Aspect on that platform until the start of Phase Two. From left to right, the platforms are: Alexstrasza, Nozdormu, Ysera, and Kalecgos. The raid encounter is identical no matter which platform you encounter Deathwing on, thus the strategy is split into two parts: The dragon aspect strategy, and the raid strategy. Use a standard raid setup with 2 tanks, DPS, and heals appropriate for 10/25-player variations.\"\nThe Aspects.\nThere are two dragon aspect orders that are the most effective:\nYsera is the platform Thrall is on at the start of the encounter.\nTo change platforms, reach the edge (just like with Throne of the Four Winds) and you will leap automatically. To avoid any bugs, do not cast any movement skills (such as Blink or Rocket Jump) during a platform leap.\nThe Raid.\nEach platform starts identically, with a disfigured limb of Deathwing. You have a short period before the first add spawns, so start DPS right away. Shortly after Deathwing assaults the platform, he spawns a Mutated Corruption, which a tank should pick up right away. All DPS should switch to it (while keeping DoTs on the Limb as well). The Mutated Corruption does an ability called Impale, which does a high amount of damage to the tank. While you have Ysera's Damage Reduction Cooldown, tanks should take turns in taking an Impale while using her Cooldown. Use the while it lasts; after defeating the limb tentacles on her platform, you lose its use until phase 2. The next add that spawns is an Elementium Bolt, which emerges from Deathwing's mouth and travels to an area on the platform that is indicated by a visual effect. All players should instantly move away from the area, as it will do an insane amount of damage should you stand right next to it when it lands.\nWhile Nozdormu is active, he slows the travel speed of these bolts, making it easy to destroy once they move into attack range. All DPS should immediately switch to it, saving the raid from unnecessary damage.\nOnce the Nozdormu platform is done and you have lost the slowing effect for the bolt, it extremely unlikely that the raid will be able to destroy the bolt before it impacts the platform. For this reason, the raid should quickly group up out of the blast radius and use both personal and raid survival cooldowns. The raid takes a substantial amount of damage; healers should be ready for aggressive healing.\nWhen the Elementium Bolt hits, the raid must destroy it as quickly as possible to avoid further damage. Afterwards, proceed in finishing off the Mutated Corruption then go back to DPSing the Limb.\nSome time after the Elementium Bolt, Deathwing will spawn several Regenerative Bloods. Their attacks apply a stacking damage debuff to the tank, and they have an energy bar that starts at 0 and quickly fills. If it reaches 90, the Regenerative Blood will heal back to full health.\nThe Limb Tentacle will spawn Blistering Tentacles at every quarter of the limb's health. Although these adds are immune to all AoE and cleaves, they are not immune to the power of a Dragon Aspect; Alexstrasza will immediately kill these for you while active. Once her platform has been cleared, all DPS must switch to single-targeting them down.\nWhile Kalecgos is up, these adds can all be nuked with AoE and cleaves. If you time it right, simply allow them to refresh their heal once they get close to the refresh, have everyone begin their AoE so that when they refresh, all your AoE is in place and continue to AoE them, and they should go down. If you have left Alexstrasza as the last aspect, DPS can ignore the adds and focus on the last Tentacle. Simply have one tank pick them all up, and have the tanks take turns holding the adds, This may require tank cooldowns and big heals on the tank,\nIn Heroic Mode ,shortly after the Mutated Corruption spawns and 1 minute after that in each platform during phase 1, Deathwing places in a random Non-tank Player a Corrupting Parasite,which will deal high amount of fire damage(roughly 300000) over 10 sec and once the debuff runs out,the parasite detach from its host.The infected player must move inside Nozdormu's Time Zone as quick as possible and no raid member must be close to him as the parasite deals massive amount of damage to players within 10 yards of the host once it detach.Shortly after that,the parasite will start to cast Unstable corruption,which deals after 10 sec of cast(15 sec if the parasite is inside the Time Zone) 10% of the remaining HP of the parasite as AoE damage to the Whole raid,thus players must DPS the parasite once it spawns and kill him(or bring it low enough in HP so his remaining 10% at the end of the cast isn't deadly, also, if the raid still have Alexstrasza's Buff,she will be able to damage a small amount of the total hp of the Parasite). The Parasite has roughly 3M hp in 10 man raids and 9M in 25 man.\nIt must be noted than once Nozdormu's Platform is clear,infect players will have to instead move next to the Mutated Corruption(while making sure no one is within 10 yards of them) so melee DPS with Cleaves can damage both the parasite and the Mutated Corruption to bring it low on hp(without Nozdormu's Time Zone,the cast time of Unstable Corruption will be shorter and the raid will have less time to damage him before the cast ends).\nWhen Phase 2 begins, Deathwing's head will slump onto Ysera's platform where you can attack it directly. Any remaining adds should be taken there and killed as quickly as possible.\nPhase 2 has three new adds to deal with \u2014 Elementium Fragments, Elementium Terrors and Congealing Bloods \u2014 all of which must be killed as soon as possible. Elementium Fragments are tentacles that target random party members with a debuff, then attack them for an absurd amount of damage. Should a fragment target you, use Ysera's Damage Reduction Cooldown. Use a personal cooldown if you become targeted a second time. \nTanks must pick up the Elementium Terrors and tank them in Nozdormu's Time Zone. They apply a stacking DoT to the tanks, so must be killed quickly.\nThe last add is the Congealing Bloods, which spawn only on &lt;a href=\"Heroic%20mode\"&gt;Heroic difficulty&lt;/a&gt; and will heal Deathwing if they reach him. For this reason, killing these adds should be the raid's highest priority.\nIf you can manage the adds well, you should burn through the last 20% with raid cooldowns past 10%, as his AoE gets deadlier every 5% he loses.\nSolo strategy.\nSave cooldowns until the last phase. Talk to Thrall to start the encounter, then jump to another platform (either Nozdormu's on the far right, or Alexstrasza's on the far left). Just walking off the edge of the island is enough to get launched toward the next island.\nOn that platform, the main damage target is the Wing Tentacle until the Mutated Corruption tentacle starts attacking the Aspect. The Mutated Tentacle must die, or it will cause problems for the rest of the encounter. If an Elementium Bolt spawns, focus on it. Don't worry about the Blistering Tentacles - they're immune to AoE, barely do any damage, and will despawn when the wing tentacle dies.\nOnce the Wing Tentacle is dead, jump to the next platform and repeat. Once all four Wing Tentacles are dead, get to Ysera's platform (second from the right). There, Deathwing himself falls forward onto the platform. Pop cooldowns and focus him down. If any Congealing Bloods spawn, kill them before they reach Deathwing, as he heals each time one gets to him.\nLoot.\nLike many final bosses of raid instances, the item levels of the gear from Deathwing are higher than gear from the rest of the instance - in this case, six item levels higher. \nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

He despises everyone, especially the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, and though still alive - unlike many of his kin - he prefers the company of the dead rather than the living. His hatred of the Lich King stems from his belief that &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; creatures should always be under mortal control \u2014 anything else is an abomination. \nMael offered his services to &lt;a href=\"Blarus%20Whitrick\"&gt;Blarus Whitrick&lt;/a&gt;, a Forsaken undead, who readily accepted. They settled in &lt;a href=\"Gaval%20Moch\"&gt;Gaval Moch&lt;/a&gt;, a ruined castle in &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt;, with a number of &lt;a href=\"acolyte\"&gt;acolyte&lt;/a&gt;s. Mael only pretended to serve Blarus however, as his beliefs concerning undead extended to the free-willed Forsaken, whose use of magical arts repelled him. The nerubian also despised Blarus's (supposed) servant, the dreadlord &lt;a href=\"Ganthrifal\"&gt;Ganthrifal&lt;/a&gt; who he consider to have moved in on his territory. Mael often entertained the thought of murdering the cunning dreadlord. Much like Ganthrifal, he only pretended to serve Blarus as he believed he could use him in his own schemes; though he would have slayed him if given the opportunity. For a long time, Mael had felt that joining forces with a hated Forsaken was a poor idea, though he had not been able to determine how to extricate himself from the situation. Though he believes that he is a surpassingly competent necromancer, the truth is the Lich King, dimly aware of a remote threat, granted Mael a small amount of power to combat Blarus' plans.\nHis magic allows him to animate minor undead creatures \u2014 &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s \u2014 that did routine work around Gaval Moch but were useless in combat. They performed routine maintenance, repairing the doors and strengthening the walls of Gaval Moch. He also convinced (making liberal use of the Command Undead spell) a local &lt;a href=\"ghost\"&gt;spectre&lt;/a&gt; to join him, and the creature serves him unquestioningly. When a roving &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt; band attacked Gaval Moch, hoping to use the ruins for its own purposes, Blarus's forces drove the ogres away and Mael Shelub attempted to reanimate the corpses of the ogre dead to replace the acolytes lost in the attack. He knew the possibility was remote since &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s, being &lt;a href=\"giant\"&gt;giant&lt;/a&gt;s, were extremely difficult to resurrect. Much to his surprise, they rose from the ground.\nWhen a group of heroes invaded Gaval Moch in order to destroy Blarus's plans, Mael leapt at the chance to take command. He offered to join forces with the heroes and once they had served their purpose, turned on them. However, he was wounded in the ensuing battle; avoiding death by teleporting away. Some time later, Mael Shelub's twenty children came looking for their father...\nThe creature is currently found operating in Lordaeron. His alignment is towards chaotic evil and he is most certainly not to be trusted."}

It is located in the middle of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt; which subsequently filled the void. The water churns constantly in a dizzying storm of tidal and &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; energy that seems to have no end. The capital city of the &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Empire\"&gt;Kaldorei Empire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zin-Azshari\"&gt;Zin-Azshari&lt;/a&gt;, was dragged under creating &lt;a href=\"Nazjatar\"&gt;Nazjatar&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Ship\"&gt;Ship&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"zeppelin\"&gt;zeppelin&lt;/a&gt; routes go out of their way to avoid the Maelstrom, for fairly obvious reasons.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nAs the aftershocks from the Well's implosion rattled the bones of the world, the seas rushed in to fill the gaping wound left in the earth. Nearly eighty percent of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;'s landmass had been blasted apart, leaving only a handful of separate continents surrounding the new, raging sea.\nAt the center of the new sea, where the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; once stood, was a tumultuous storm of tidal fury and chaotic energies. This terrible scar, known as the Maelstrom, would never cease its furious spinning. It would remain a constant reminder of the terrible catastrophe and the utopian era that had been lost forever.\nThird War.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;'s fleet crashed and they made an emergency landing on &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Islands\"&gt;an island&lt;/a&gt; near the Maelstrom, where they found a group of &lt;a href=\"jungle%20troll\"&gt;jungle troll&lt;/a&gt;s fighting desperately against &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; colonists and &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt; invaders. The island was destroyed by &lt;a href=\"Zar%27jira\"&gt;Zar'jira&lt;/a&gt;, with Thrall and his allies barely escaping.\nCataclysm.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; used the Maelstrom to re-enter &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s physical plane from &lt;a href=\"Deepholm\"&gt;Deepholm&lt;/a&gt;, he triggered the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; was later present here on behalf of the &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt;, and was trying to maintain the rift with other key shaman members, alongside &lt;a href=\"Muln%20Earthfury\"&gt;Muln Earthfury&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Farseer%20Nobundo\"&gt;Farseer Nobundo&lt;/a&gt; who made their camps here. At some point, &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt; found Thrall here and sent him to a journey to aid the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Madness%20of%20Deathwing\"&gt;final battle&lt;/a&gt;, Deathwing attempted to flee to Deepholm and the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s faced him before he could usher forth the final cataclysm. Even after the death of the Destroyer, the shamans of the Earthen Ring were still healing the world.\nLegion.\nWith the disastrous results of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Battle%20for%20Broken%20Shore%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Battle for Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the elders of the &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt; called an emergency council at the Maelstrom. While there, the Earthen Ring and a shaman &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; pushed back an attack led by the &lt;a href=\"fel%20lord\"&gt;fel lord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Geth%27xun\"&gt;Geth'xun&lt;/a&gt;. After the shaman adventurer reclaimed an &lt;a href=\"artifact\"&gt;artifact&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"Class%20Hall\"&gt;Order Hall&lt;/a&gt; was established at the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Azeroth%20%28Class%20Hall%29\"&gt;Heart of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nJust northeast of the Maelstrom, a titan vault known as the &lt;a href=\"Primordial%20Observatory\"&gt;Primordial Observatory&lt;/a&gt; can be found.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt; wound erupted at the Maelstrom, which caused rampaging &lt;a href=\"Azerite%20elemental\"&gt;Azerite elemental&lt;/a&gt;s to strike at the Earthen Ring in their attempts to claim the Azerite. Soon after, &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; arrived to secure the wound. To that end, Magni directed his ally with quelling the rampaging elements, liberating the trapped shaman and using the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Azeroth\"&gt;Heart of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; to seal up the wounds. With the Maelstrom secured, an overjoyed Magni revealed that the damage was stopped before it could become worse. He further remarked that the Maelstrom would always be a place of great history and pain for Azeroth but that any healing done in the area made things better.\nAfter the war, the Earthen Ring continue to look after the Maelstrom.\nIn Warcraft III.\nFrom the \" manual:\nIn World of Warcraft.\nThe Maelstrom can be seen on the world map of \"World of Warcraft\", where it sits between &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;. This depiction of the Maelstrom, as well as evading ships/zeppelins, was continued in the following expansions which elaborated the map and added more travel routes.\nThe Burning Crusade and Wrath of the Lich King.\nThe two first World of Warcraft expansions, ' and ', included minor depictions of the Maelstrom:\nIn Cataclysm.\nIn the third expansion, \"\", players became able to visit the Maelstrom. As far as game mechanics are concerned, the Maelstrom is a &lt;a href=\"sanctuary\"&gt;sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, where PvP combat is disabled. The zone can be reached through the quests which lead the player to Deepholm from &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;. Once the player enters Deepholm, the Maelstrom cannot be revisited.\nPlayer mobility in the Maelstrom is limited: mounting is disabled, and an invisible wall does not allow movement outside of Thrall and &lt;a href=\"Aggra\"&gt;Aggra&lt;/a&gt;'s piece of land. As a result, players cannot venture over via flight or swimming to visit &lt;a href=\"Kezan%20%28starting%20zone%29\"&gt;Kezan&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Isles\"&gt;Lost Isles&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nThe Maelstrom is an ancient vast storm whirl of &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; energy swirling with magical power and located in the middle of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt;. It makes seagoing travel between &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;eastern continents&lt;/a&gt; dif\ufb01cult, but its &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; winds hide secret mysteries. This vortex also forms the northern boundary of the &lt;a href=\"South%20Seas\"&gt;South Seas&lt;/a&gt;, and south of it are several tropical islands.\nThe center of the Maelstrom is called the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20%28Maelstrom%29\"&gt;Eye&lt;/a&gt;. There is not much on the surface, but beneath the waves, on the ocean's \ufb02oor, there are giant sea monsters, underwater volcanoes and thermal vents, as well as the capital of both the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"makrura\"&gt;makrura&lt;/a&gt; civilizations, &lt;a href=\"Nazjatar\"&gt;Nazjatar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mak%27aru\"&gt;Mak'aru&lt;/a&gt; respectively. The Maelstrom creates a vortex below it, forming a massive whirlpool that leads into the depths of the Eye, creating a wall of swirling water, nearly impassable, beneath the surface. Accessing the Eye is no mean trick.\nHistory.\n10,000 years ago, when the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; collapsed during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, it created a raging magical vortex, enormous in size, that still exists today. Indeed, it shows no sign of dissipating. This vortex came to be known as the Maelstrom, and it occupies the center of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt;.\nFor as long as the eastern and western continents have existed, the Maelstrom has made sea travel between the two dif\ufb01cult. Both the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; lost numerous ships to the &lt;a href=\"Drowned%20Reaches\"&gt;Drowned Reaches&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20%28Maelstrom%29\"&gt;Eye&lt;/a&gt; during the exodus to &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, during &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;'s expedition, he was shipwrecked on &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Islands\"&gt;one lone island&lt;/a&gt; somewhere in the &lt;a href=\"South%20Seas\"&gt;South Seas&lt;/a&gt; which was probably close to the Maelstrom. It was here that he met the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe Maelstrom is just northwest of the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt; and it is too close. The vortex's magical storms lash the Broken Isles, making for near constant winds and rainfall and, occasionally, something stranger. The Maelstrom's proximity makes the isles unstable. It is implied the Maelstrom is slowly eroding and damaging the artificially-raised Broken Isles, and soon the storm will prove too much and the islands will sink back into the sea.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

She was captured within the dread citadel Naxxramas, where she gives birth to her brood. She feasts on those foolish enough to enter the &lt;a href=\"necropolis\"&gt;necropolis&lt;/a&gt;, feeding her spawn with their corpses and producing spider after spider that &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; uses to his own foul ends.\nAbilities.\nMaexxna has approximately 2.5 million health in 10 player, and 7.6 million health in 25-player.\nStrategy.\n25-player strategy.\nThis is a quick encounter that will be over in 2\u20133 minutes and hinges almost entirely on keeping the tank alive through web spray. You will need one tank. The tank should pull Maexxna near a wall and face her towards the center of the room, the raid should position themselves behind Maexxna. Ranged DPS classes will be on killing cocoons. At the 30 second mark Mages will need to be on top of Maexxna to frost nova the Maexxna spiderlings. At this point the raid needs to AoE them down within 10 seconds before Web Spray. If any are left alive it is likely they will kill someone during it as they attack very quickly. Healers will need to apply abolish poison and all of their heal over time effects on the tank just before Web Spray. It is advisable to stop DPS at ~33% and wait for a Web Spray then blow all cooldowns to kill Maexxna so that she never does a Web Spray while frenzied which will likely kill the tank.\n10-player strategy.\nThe tank will want to pull Maexxna to the leftmost suspended block, and then turn her around so she faces the opposite block. Melee DPS should stand behind her and the ranged DPS and healers will stand further away. When the fight starts, make sure shamans set poison cleansing totems down, otherwise the other healing classes need to dispell the poisons Maexxna casts. Designate 1 or 2 DPS to monitor when she casts Web Wrap and to subsequently shoot the players out of the webs. Designate another DPS to snare the spiderlings she summons, either use a mage with frost nova, or something like a death knight to aggro the spiderlings as they come. Make sure the spiderlings are killed quickly as Maexxna casts web spray just after summoning her adds. Healers need to watch for poisoned targets, as well as topping the raid off before web spray is cast. She soft enrages at 30% and is easily killed after that.\nSolo strategy.\nThe ability that wins or loses this fight is Web Wrap, cast at the 20-second mark. Unless players can direct their pets to attack the Web Wrap, players will get sent to the wall during the first cast and stay there for the remainder of the fight. To defeat Maexxena before she casts web wrap, players must deal at minimum 125K damage per second in 10-player mode, or 380K damage per second in 25-player mode. More DPS than this minimum will be required, considering ramp-up time at the beginning of the fight.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;\nExternal links.\n "}

Ideal DPS is around 20% per rotation.\nAt roughly 5 seconds (35 seconds into the cycle) before the Web Spray, healers should put all Heal over Times (and PW:Shield) on the MT and max rank heal to ensure that the tank is at full health before Web Spray is cast. It is ESSENTIAL that the MT has an &lt;a href=\"Abolish%20Poison\"&gt;Abolish Poison&lt;/a&gt; on him before Web Spray is cast. The Necrotic Poison will negate all the HoTs that were put on the tank unless it is cleansed off.\nIf the MT is fully buffed, and receives the appropriate, timely heals and cleanse, then he should survive the 8 seconds of Web Spray without dying. This forces the MT to generally be the best geared Warrior in the raid, with a very high health total and gear equivalent to full Wrath equipment.\nDuring Maexxnas Enrage, have the warrior shield wall for the web wrap. If you need to go into a second enraged web wrap, I recommend the warrior blowing &lt;a href=\"Last%20Stand\"&gt;Last Stand&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lifegiving%20Gem\"&gt;Lifegiving Gem&lt;/a&gt;. It's also a good idea for the warrior to pop a &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Stoneshield%20Potion\"&gt;Greater Stoneshield Potion&lt;/a&gt; about halfway through the fight. It should last for the rest of the encounter. Make certain Demoralizing Shout and some type of melee slow (Thunderfury or Thunderclap) is on Maexxna at all times.\nLoot.\nMaexxna drops two &lt;a href=\"Tier%203\"&gt;Tier 3&lt;/a&gt; tokens per kill.\nYou receive 100 reputation with the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt; at all reputation levels."}

Using the &lt;a href=\"Vision%20of%20Time\"&gt;Vision of Time&lt;/a&gt;, Kairozdormu transported himself and the former Warchief to an alternate Draenor \u2014 a Draenor where Garrosh was never born \u2014 with the hope of constructing a new Horde. After murdering Kairoz with the Vision, Garrosh traveled to the nearby village to seek the alternate version of his father, Grommash.\nGarrosh managed to convince Grommash to rally the orc clans of this alternate world into an Iron Horde, an army free from demonic influences who would ravage &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"iron%20star\"&gt;iron star&lt;/a&gt; technology Garrosh had brought with him.\nWhen Gul'dan summoned the clans to the to drink the blood of &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt;, Grom refused and slew the &lt;a href=\"pit%20lord\"&gt;pit lord&lt;/a&gt;. Gul'dan and his agents were shackled beneath the to power the gateway between worlds.

Grommash refused, but , Warlord of the , accepted, delivering the Iron Horde into the hands of the Legion. Gul'dan used his fel magic to twist and corrupt the Iron Horde's stronghold of Hellfire Citadel, and within he successfully summoned &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; the Defiler.\nNew beginnings.\nWith &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt;'s death and the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Legion's&lt;/a&gt; defeat in , proclaimed the victory and the freedom of Draenor to the gathered soldiers. Grommash, &lt;a href=\"Yrel\"&gt;Yrel&lt;/a&gt;, and turning their attention to rebuilding their world. The &lt;a href=\"Mag%27har%20orc\"&gt;orcs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; worked together to drive the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; from Draenor, and they lived together in peace for years. The Mag'har orcs also subdued Draenor's remaining &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"clan\"&gt;clan&lt;/a&gt;s.\nTyranny of the Light.\nBut without demons to fight, the draenei became fixated upon the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; then compelled them to spread their influence among the orcs. A few were converted willingly, while others had the Light &lt;a href=\"Lightbound\"&gt;forced upon them&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Lightbound\"&gt;Lightbound&lt;/a&gt; accuse the Mag'har of killing the planet, while the Mag'har, in turn, accuse the Lightbound of causing it.\nAzeroth.\nAfter arriving on Azeroth, the Mag'har pledged their loyalty to the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; under the command of &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;. They subsequently claimed the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20the%20Brave\"&gt;Hall of the Brave&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Honor\"&gt;Valley of Honor&lt;/a&gt; as their new impromptu home. Throughout the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, several Mag'har clan members participated in the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20War%20Campaign\"&gt;War Campaign&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Darkshore\"&gt;Battle for Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Faction%20Assault%20on%20Stormsong%20Valley\"&gt;Faction Assault on Stormsong Valley&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the Horde split between the revolutionaries of &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; and the loyalists of Sylvanas Windrunner, the Mag'har sided with the Warchief. During the conflict, Saurfang challenged Sylvanas to a &lt;a href=\"Mak%27gora\"&gt;Mak'gora&lt;/a&gt;, which ended in his death and Sylvanas' abandonment of the Horde. In light of Sylvanas's betrayal, the Mag'har bent the knee to Saurfang's revolutionaries, and were given amnesty.\nAfter the fall of &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;, the Horde formed a &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Council\"&gt;council style leadership&lt;/a&gt; in place of a Warchief, with &lt;a href=\"Overlord%20Geya%27rah\"&gt;Overlord Geya'rah&lt;/a&gt; representing the Mag'har orc clans.\nClans.\nThe Blackrocks are a disciplined, organized, and militaristic clan who boast expert\u00a0&lt;a href=\"smith\"&gt;smith&lt;/a&gt;s\u00a0and metalworkers. Well armored, they utilize brute strength and weaponry to destroy their foes. The first of the orc clans to master the art of shaping their\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Ore\"&gt;namesake metal&lt;/a&gt;, the Blackrocks prefer to wield blunt weaponry in battle to honor their ancestors. On Draenor, the clan studied the earth around them, developing their knowledge of metallurgy and smithing. Once they learned the secrets of the unique &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Ore\"&gt;blackrock ore&lt;/a&gt; scattered throughout Gorgrond, the orcs were able to create astonishing tools and weapons.\nThe clan is named after the &lt;a href=\"Bleeding%20Hollow%20Cave\"&gt;hidden chamber&lt;/a&gt; in which the chieftains sacrificed an eye to receive a vision of their death. They are a fanatical and crude clan who fight with a berserker fury and gain the boon of prophecy from their elders, who sacrifice an eye to see into the future, founding truth in the surety of their deaths. They imbue themselves with berserk fury, slather their weapons in hallucinogenic venom, and stalk prey from the treetops, branding their victims' final moments with visions of pure horror. As they were an insular clan living in one of the most hostile parts of Draenor, they had little contact with the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;. Generations of surviving in a jungle beset by the remnants of the &lt;a href=\"Evergrowth\"&gt;Evergrowth&lt;/a&gt; instilled a savage instinct into the orcs' warfare. The clan was infamous for their use of &lt;a href=\"blood%20magic\"&gt;blood magic&lt;/a&gt;, described by &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Hunter%20Denjai\"&gt;Shadow Hunter Denjai&lt;/a&gt; as \"like &lt;a href=\"voodoo\"&gt;voodoo&lt;/a&gt; but it hurt more\". The orcs carved blood sigils into their own flesh with &lt;a href=\"Bleeding%20Hollow%20Ritual%20Blade\"&gt;curved ceremonial blades&lt;/a&gt;, created potions from the blood of their strongest warriors and used savage blood magic to transform their warriors into &lt;a href=\"Dire%20orc\"&gt;hulking berserkers&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe clan was primarily known for their deadly &lt;a href=\"blademaster\"&gt;blademaster&lt;/a&gt;s. These skilled swordsmen could focus their warrior energies to become living cyclones of rage, spinning their blades faster than the naked eye could see, or channel their potent powers in one focused strike to cause even greater damage. One of the blademasters' more mystical abilities was to create duplicate phantom images of themselves to confuse their enemies, and they were so adept and agile that they could move so quickly they appeared to be invisible to the naked eye. Though they were masters of stealth and guile, the blademasters valued personal honor above all else. Once they had passed their final tests in the &lt;a href=\"Masters%27%20Cavern\"&gt;Masters' Cavern&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Blade%20Ruins\"&gt;Hallvalor&lt;/a&gt;, blademasters were given the honor of wearing the Burning Blade's banner. The clan was also known for its &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;, who primarily focused on &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt; fire magic. These \"&lt;a href=\"Burning%20Flameseer\"&gt;flameseers&lt;/a&gt;\" were known to use summoning components consisting of a powdery material mixed with something that sparkled. The Burning Blade forged a unique relationship with Draenor's ancient elementals and were able to work with iron and flame in ways poorly understood by outsiders. Many legendary Burning Blade weapons owed their existence to a &lt;a href=\"Flamebender%27s%20Tome\"&gt;Flamebender's Tome&lt;/a&gt;, an iron-bound sheaf of writing apparently passed down through generations.\n&lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20Orcs\"&gt;Frostwolf clan&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn Draenor, the proud members of the Frostwolf clan were exceptional fighters but nonetheless lived in harmony with the land, believing that they should adapt to the environment rather than seeking to dominate it. The noble ideals of family and community were highly valued. The Frostwolves prided themselves on suppressing their rage and &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Fury\"&gt;bloodlust&lt;/a&gt;, for they knew that those who succumbed to the beast within became their own greatest enemy. The Frostwolf clan derived its symbol and name from its kinship with &lt;a href=\"Frostfire%20Ridge\"&gt;Frostfire Ridge&lt;/a&gt;'s native &lt;a href=\"Frost%20wolf\"&gt;frost wolves&lt;/a&gt;, whom the orcs hunted alongside, befriended and even tamed as companions. The clan spent a lot of time in Frostfire Ridge but migrated seasonally to .\nOn Azeroth, notably, members of the clan participate in the &lt;a href=\"Brewfest\"&gt;Brewfest&lt;/a&gt; festivities, selling their Warpath ale.\n&lt;a href=\"Laughing%20Skull%20Orcs\"&gt;Laughing Skull clan&lt;/a&gt;.\nManiacal, volatile, and bloodthirsty, the orcs of the Laughing Skull clan were capable of extreme brutality. Other clans believed them to be mad and considered them to be dangerous and unpredictable, much like &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Gorgrond&lt;/a&gt; itself, and the clan had a reputation for being treacherous. Rather than flinching in the face of death, the Laughing Skulls prided themselves on laughing at it instead, and they chortled whenever they collected a &lt;a href=\"Humerus%20Bone\"&gt;humerus bone&lt;/a&gt; from a fallen enemy. This violent mindset stemmed from their environment. The Laughing Skulls struggled to maintain their ancestral territory, but the brutality of being constantly assaulted by Gorgrond's warring &lt;a href=\"Breakers\"&gt;Breakers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Primals\"&gt;Primals&lt;/a&gt; forged them into bloodthirsty savages and forced them to \"match savagery with savagery\". The Laughing Skulls always burned their dead in order to prevent the bodies from being raised and &lt;a href=\"infested\"&gt;infested&lt;/a&gt; by the botani. Members of the clan wore distinctive skull-like masks. These were more than fancy facewear; with a mask and \"some proper incentive\", anyone could be made into a Laughing Skull. The Laughing Skulls had long learned a few secrets of the &lt;a href=\"botani\"&gt;botani&lt;/a&gt; that they could use to grow their own plants. There was no such thing as a hungry Laughing Skull for this reason. With a dash of a few secret ingredients, one could feed an army with the food grown from the pollen carried by the botani's &lt;a href=\"Ravager%20wasp\"&gt;wasps&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ravager\"&gt;ravagers&lt;/a&gt;, if one knew \"the secret ways\".\nThe Shadowmoon were known to be the most spiritual of all the orc clans and were relatively peaceful compared to other orcs. Fascinated with the starry sky, the Shadowmoon believed they could glean the future from stellar movements. They were a deeply mystical people, and they developed traditions and rituals centered around astrology and ancestor worship. A key source of the Shadowmoon clan's power came from their understanding of the stars and their omens. For centuries, they recorded the patterns of the stars and their interpretations. They had a history of &lt;a href=\"Astromancy\"&gt;astrology&lt;/a&gt;, having always spoken the language of the stars and the earth. A key source of the clan's power came from their understanding of the stars and their omens. For centuries, they recorded the patterns of the stars and their interpretations. They were profoundly linked to the spiritual world and had many &lt;a href=\"seer\"&gt;seer&lt;/a&gt;s, astrologers, and speakers of the dead among their ranks.\nShadowmoon mystics often inscribed secret runes into their flesh using ceremonial bone needles to more clearly speak to their ancestors and the elemental spirits. Consultation with the spirits of previous generations was considered essential to Shadowmoon shaman whenever an important decision was to be made. Talismans and other relics that were important to an ancestor during life provided a more clear spiritual conduit for shaman to speak to them in the afterlife. The clan's shaman frequently journeyed to the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20the%20Elements\"&gt;Throne of the Elements&lt;/a&gt; to commune with the elemental spirits.\nFollowing the symbolic severing of one's hand from the chains binding him in order to earn freedom, as himself desperately demonstrated while he was chained under the &lt;a href=\"Highmaul\"&gt;Highmaul&lt;/a&gt; arena, these former slaves have been drawn together through a macabre joy of pain both self-inflicted and imposed upon others. It is through this pain that they believe they gather strength, and their reputation as relentless and dirty fighters is well-earned. The Shattered Hand were sadistic warriors who maimed their bodies, perhaps in a show of solidarity, or perhaps because they simply enjoyed the pain, which they claimed strengthened them. The clan celebrated victory in battle with self-mutilation. Their most celebrated warriors were covered with scars and piercings, and it became increasingly difficult with age to tell which were inflicted by enemies or by the triumphant orc.\nTaking their namesake literally, warriors of the Shattered Hand would ritualistically smash their own left hand before cutting it off as a way to demonstrate their loyalty to the clan. The stump was cauterized and replaced with one of many varieties of crude tools or weaponry. Heavily weighted blades resembling simple butcher's cleavers were used to make a single clean cut at the wrist.\nAll incarnations of the Shattered Hand appear to be known for using &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt; and assassin units. It seems to be common for Shattered Hand assassins to retain both hands.\nThunderlords valued acts of bravery and valor above all others and sought to dominate the land rather than adapting to their environment. They roamed the frozen wastes of Frostfire Ridge in huge packs, often embarking on dangerous adventures to hunt Frostfire's fearsome &lt;a href=\"gronn\"&gt;gronn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"magnaron\"&gt;magnaron&lt;/a&gt;. A single gronn kill could sustain them for weeks, but when a hunt failed, the orcs would suffer great hardship. A brave and cunning people, the Thunderlords' culture was greatly focused on synergy, and they derived strength from their togetherness, though there were still those who strived to become like &lt;a href=\"Brakor\"&gt;Brakor&lt;/a&gt; and other such ancestral heroes of legend. The Thunderlords relied on their numbers and spent their days training to hunt as a team, but as individuals they were weak. The Frostwolf chieftain claimed that the Thunderlords were willing to lose ten orcs for every gronn they killed and that they considered no sacrifice too great in the pursuit of victory.\nThe Thunderlords were the greatest big game hunters in all of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;. For centuries they used riding beasts and coordinated assaults to slay game and gronn alike. Known for their mastery of beasts, the clan used numbers and tactics to conquer animals of all types, from raising &lt;a href=\"Rylak\"&gt;rylaks&lt;/a&gt; as air support and wrangling &lt;a href=\"clefthoof\"&gt;clefthoof&lt;/a&gt; for pack animals to shackling and subjugating &lt;a href=\"boar\"&gt;boar&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"bird\"&gt;bird&lt;/a&gt;s, and even gronn.\nThe Warsong roamed the prairies of &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt; as nomads, rarely staying in the same place for more than a few months. The riders of the Warsong were always on the move. In camp, a family's tent was marked with a long pike thrust into the ground, often adorned with the skulls of defeated enemies and sometimes branded with the names of key battles.\nRelying on shock and awe to overwhelm their enemies, the Warsong earned their name from their fearsome battle cries and thunderous drum marches. Ripping into every combat crying epic battle-hymns of blood and death, they were the most distinguishable of the Draenor clans. A bullroarer is an arm-length piece of rigid wood affixed to the end of a long rope and spun over the wielder's head to generate a droning noise capable of traveling long distances. The bullroarers used by the Warsong were grooved to emit a high-pitched whistling noise rather than the low hum used by most other clans. Holes carved into Warsong weapons caused them to howl and wail when swung through the air. This is notably the case with &lt;a href=\"Gorehowl\"&gt;Gorehowl&lt;/a&gt;, the famous axe of the &lt;a href=\"Hellscream\"&gt;Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; family. It is expected that members of the Warsong wear the bones of his or her first kill, and inscribe them with personal runes. Members of the Warsong long hunted the &lt;a href=\"Bloodhoof%20Bull\"&gt;bloodhoof clefthoof&lt;/a&gt; to user their crimson-hued skin for battle standards.\nPopulation.\nSeveral decades passed on after the &lt;a href=\"war%20in%20Draenor\"&gt;war in Draenor&lt;/a&gt; ended. Relations between Mag'har orcs and draenei warmed up, with draenei scholars teaching orc children how to read and write. For the Mag'har, the memory of green, &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt;-corrupted orcs became a faint memory. But peace only lasted until the naaru arrived. After that, &lt;a href=\"Yrel\"&gt;Yrel&lt;/a&gt; and her &lt;a href=\"Lightforged%20draenei\"&gt;Lightforged draenei&lt;/a&gt; fought against the Mag'har orcs.\nDuring the Mag'har orc race &lt;a href=\"Allied%20race%20recruitment%20quests\"&gt;unlock questline&lt;/a&gt;, when &lt;a href=\"Eitrigg\"&gt;Eitrigg&lt;/a&gt; asks for troops from , he was about to send some of his troops to help the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; until &lt;a href=\"Yrel\"&gt;Yrel&lt;/a&gt;'s unprovoked attack. According to , whole &lt;a href=\"Lightbound\"&gt;Lightbound&lt;/a&gt; army comes to attack on Mag'har. When the Mag'har escape to Azeroth there isn't much forces in-game, this is because of the game mechanics. According to &lt;a href=\"Steve%20Danuser\"&gt;Steve Danuser&lt;/a&gt;, a lot of orcs got caught up in that teleport spell and Mag'har have a significant fighting force along with a fair number of \"guests\" (&lt;a href=\"gronn\"&gt;gronn&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"gronnling\"&gt;gronnling&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"ogron\"&gt;ogron&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"garn\"&gt;garn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"goren\"&gt;goren&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"botani\"&gt;botani&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"saberon\"&gt;saberon&lt;/a&gt;).\nTechnology.\nThe foundation of the Mag'har technology is the &lt;a href=\"iron%20star\"&gt;iron star&lt;/a&gt;: a coal-fired centrifugal engine which can be used to turn wheels, belts, and chains, allowing for the construction of crude vehicles and siege weapons including &lt;a href=\"tank\"&gt;tank&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Mag%27har%20Turret\"&gt;cannons&lt;/a&gt;, and chariots. They use all of the technology previously used by the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlongside these weapons, the Mag'har make use of warbeasts. Tamed by the Thunderlord clan, these beasts range from massive &lt;a href=\"clefthoof\"&gt;clefthoof&lt;/a&gt;, who were bred as both packbeasts and weapons of war, and the mighty &lt;a href=\"gronn\"&gt;gronn&lt;/a&gt;, who have been wholly subjugated by the time of their introduction to the Horde. Alongside them, ogres work as servants, adding to the Mag'har's already formidable arsenal of weaponry.\nEven after their exodus to Azeroth, the Mag'har are capable of replicating their technology using Azeroth's materials. As a result, Mag'har weaponry has been quickly adopted by the Horde since their introduction, such as on the siege of &lt;a href=\"Norwington%20Estate\"&gt;Norwington Estate&lt;/a&gt;, invasions on &lt;a href=\"Tiragarde%20Sound\"&gt;Tiragarde Sound&lt;/a&gt;, as a flagship in &lt;a href=\"Nazmir\"&gt;Nazmir&lt;/a&gt;, and as a full invasion force in &lt;a href=\"Stormsong%20Valley\"&gt;Stormsong Valley&lt;/a&gt; as a few examples.\nSpeculation.\nDue to the appearance of &lt;a href=\"Swellthrasher\"&gt;Swellthrasher&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Drustvar\"&gt;Drustvar&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20War%20Campaign\"&gt;Horde War Campaign&lt;/a&gt;, the recruitment of the Mag'har Clans into the Horde may have, lorewise, happened before the Horde invaded &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;. Alternatively, it could mean that some &lt;a href=\"Laughing%20Skull%20Orcs\"&gt;Laughing Skull Orcs&lt;/a&gt; returned to Azeroth with the Horde forces after the &lt;a href=\"war%20in%20Draenor\"&gt;war in Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, as hinted at by the &lt;a href=\"War%20Drummer\"&gt;War Drummer&lt;/a&gt;s and a few other orcs wearing &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20Orcs\"&gt;Frostwolf Orcs&lt;/a&gt; gear."}

Later, he can be found aboard the \"&lt;a href=\"Vindicaar\"&gt;Vindicaar&lt;/a&gt;\" after the &lt;a href=\"Lightforged%20draenei\"&gt;Lightforged draenei&lt;/a&gt; join the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nEncountered at the &lt;a href=\"Conservatory%20of%20the%20Arcane\"&gt;Conservatory of the Arcane&lt;/a&gt; in search of the &lt;a href=\"%3ASigil%20of%20Awakening\"&gt;:Sigil of Awakening&lt;/a&gt;, Vigilant Quoram was found &lt;a href=\"Deactivated%20Conservatory%20Vigilant\"&gt;turned off&lt;/a&gt;, inactive for a long while, perhaps as long as &lt;a href=\"Eredath\"&gt;Eredath&lt;/a&gt; had floated above &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Y%27mera\"&gt;Archmage Y'mera&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href=\"class%20order\"&gt;order&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champion&lt;/a&gt; managed to jolt the gatekeeper awake with magic.\nUpon coming to life, the Vigilant told \"Exile\" Y'mera that Conservatory resources were not available to one of her status. Having never liked Quoram's smug superiority and knowing she would not get any where with him, she asked the order champion to do the talking instead. When asked about the Sigil, Vigilant Quoram explained that the Sigil was the Conservatory's highest honor. Only &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt;'s chosen could pursue this accolade. He was also obligated to inform them that the master created trials specifically for this purpose, but also that he was required to allow the uninitiated to participate.\nAt the opposite end of the Conservatory, explained Quoram, they would find a large structure. Once inside, their goal for the Trial of Tenacity would be to overcome all the obstacles placed before them. Emerging unscathed would force the gatekeeper to consider their will strong enough to proceed.\nThe path to Quoram's left would take them to a set of three statues, that they would use by solving a puzzle to collect a Mark of Cunning for the Trial of Cunning. If they, by some miracle, happened to succeed, Quoram would formally recognize their \"brilliance\".\nQuoram also told the champion to find what remained of Archimonde's greatest pupils for the Trial of Mastery. These three once held such power in their own disciplines that the Conservatory remembered them still. Their echoes would try to kill them, besting all three with all their limbs intact and Quoram would recognize their strength.\nAfter passing the three trials, Quoram told the champion that their deeds did qualify them to seek the Sigil. The greatest of their challenges still lay ahead: going to the &lt;a href=\"Praetorium\"&gt;Praetorium&lt;/a&gt; and facing Archimonde himself. Only by defeating the master of the Conservatory would one be worthy of the Sigil. Few had ever overcome this obstacle however, noted Quoram.\nAfter the Legion's defeat at &lt;a href=\"Antorus\"&gt;Antorus&lt;/a&gt;, Quoram relocated to the \"&lt;a href=\"Vindicaar\"&gt;Vindicaar&lt;/a&gt;\" above &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, apparently being given a \"new prime directive\" related to the &lt;a href=\"Lightforged%20draenei\"&gt;Lightforged draenei&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Army of the Light&lt;/a&gt; after watching over the Conservatory was no longer deemed an effective use of the vigilant's time.\nQuotes.\nIf it interests you to know, I was once the keeper of the Conservatory's keys, custodian to all of its locks and gates.\nTo halt the ravages of time, I placed my soul inside this construct. And so it is that I watch over the Conservatory for all eternity.\nIt will forever be my burden to deal with the likes of you.\nI suppse you are wondering what I am doing here.\nSuffice it to say that I have been given a new prime directive. Apparently standing watch over the Conservatory was not an efficient use of my time.\n&lt;Sigh&gt; Tenure no longer means what it once did.\nDo you require something? As you can see, I am quite busy."}

Like all other &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;forest troll&lt;/a&gt;s, the Vilebranch allied themselves with the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27jin\"&gt;Zul'jin&lt;/a&gt;, a famous troll hero from the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani tribe&lt;/a&gt;. When the Horde was soundly defeated, Zul'jin disappeared, and the forest trolls abandoned their &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;ish allies.\nFurious at the orcs' failure to live up to &lt;a href=\"Doomhammer\"&gt;Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt;'s promise, the Vilebranch trolls returned home to their capital city of &lt;a href=\"Jintha%27Alor\"&gt;Jintha'Alor&lt;/a&gt;. They also had a small settlement on the &lt;a href=\"Altar%20of%20Zul\"&gt;Altar of Zul&lt;/a&gt; and on the &lt;a href=\"Shaol%27watha\"&gt;Shaol'watha&lt;/a&gt; ruins. The Vilebranch trolls eventually discovered that the &lt;a href=\"Revantusk\"&gt;Revantusk&lt;/a&gt; tribe had moved into the area, and decided that the small Revantusk tribe would be an easy source of victims for rituals. The Revantusks fought back with strength and cunning, and the Horde began sending reinforcements to aid the Revantusk tribe.

Dark vessels of his tainted blood radiated the foul magic, woven by Vile Priestess Hexx, empowering the Vilebranch and also driving them to madness. &lt;a href=\"Patch%201.7\"&gt;When Hakkar is returned in Zul'Gurub&lt;/a&gt;, the Vilebranch sent an &lt;a href=\"ambassador\"&gt;ambassador&lt;/a&gt; to Zul'Gurub.\nCataclysm.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the Vilebranch trolls took over the &lt;a href=\"Agol%27watha\"&gt;Agol'watha&lt;/a&gt; ruins, but lost the Shaol'watha ruins to the Revantusk and &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20Clan\"&gt;Wildhammer Clan&lt;/a&gt;. They also took over the formerly &lt;a href=\"Witherbark%20tribe\"&gt;Witherbark&lt;/a&gt; temple of &lt;a href=\"Shadra%27Alor\"&gt;Shadra'Alor&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Vilebranch used to drink the blood of Hakkar, but now drink the blood of &lt;a href=\"Shadra\"&gt;Shadra&lt;/a&gt;, the spider &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt;.

The word is also sometimes used as a verb for selling to a vendor, e.g., \"I'm just going to \"vendor\" this axe, since I can't use it.\" For quick use as a verb, sometimes only \"V\" is used to mean \"vendor it\" or \"V?\" for \"vendor it?\" Items that have no use other than selling to a vendor are called &lt;a href=\"vendor%20trash\"&gt;vendor trash&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is noteworthy that while most profession and food vendors are essential, most armor and weapon merchants are only as valuable as their repairs. The items they sell are expensive, have no stats, and are almost always completely inferior to items of the same level. They have little to no use after around level 10, when drops and quest rewards become better.\nRepairing.\nSome vendors can &lt;a href=\"repair\"&gt;repair&lt;/a&gt; armor &lt;a href=\"durability\"&gt;durability&lt;/a&gt; damage (usually vendors who sell armor and weapons, but often those who sell blacksmithing and engineering supplies).\nAs of &lt;a href=\"patch%202.3\"&gt;patch 2.3&lt;/a&gt;, your pointer changes when you move it over a repair-capable NPC:\nAccessing a repair NPC, the icons below allows the user to do the repairs to their equipped items. Repairing items will cost .\nBuyback.\nIf you sold an item, you can buy it back for the same price at which it was sold by clicking the Buyback tab and right-clicking the item or dragging it back to your bag. You can repurchase up to 12 items that you have sold to a vendor. The items (up to 12) since you last logged in will persist. When your character leaves the game or zones to a different area, this list of items will be cleared, so if you have accidentally sold something, don't wait to buy it back.

This is very useful as it saves a lot of time to not have to return to a stationary vendor every time you have to sell and in some cases buy something. Examples of portable vendors are:\nNotice that portable vendors, while most sought for as convenient buyers of useless things that players don't need, often offer a somewhat meager choice of items that players may buy for self-usage, such as: materials used in various &lt;a href=\"profession\"&gt;profession&lt;/a&gt;s; food; and, in rare cases, equipment.

{"id": "14998", "revid": "38791128", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=14998", "title": "Vendor trash", "text": "Vendor trash is a term for &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s which will most likely not be sold to any player and have little or no function in the game except to be sold to an &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"vendor\"&gt;vendor&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"money\"&gt;money&lt;/a&gt;, hence the term \"vendor trash\", also known as \"&lt;a href=\"Junk\"&gt;Junk&lt;/a&gt;\" to some players. The term is somewhat subjective, but generally, most players agree that &lt;a href=\"poor\"&gt;poor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"quality\"&gt;quality&lt;/a&gt; or \"gray\" items fall into this category. &lt;a href=\"Common\"&gt;Common&lt;/a&gt; quality or \"white\" weapons and armor are often considered to be vendor trash as well. \nThe key factors here are useless items have no demand and should be vended (non-equipable poor quality items are almost all useless) and low quality weapons and armor have low demand, but have high markup in the auction house, and are too expensive and require too much effort to sell, thus should be vended. Common items (with a white name) other than weapons and armor do have \"some\" purpose to someone; trade item, consumable, quest item, etc. These have demand and so these are not generally considered to be vendor trash. Uncommon items and better have better properties and are rarely trash; uncommon or better weapons and armor that are not &lt;a href=\"bind\"&gt;bound&lt;/a&gt; can be disenchanted if they are not needed. Still, the effort to sell an item defines the subjective definition of what is trash. Some items are for quests available only to the opposing faction, and so on, and are too much effort to sell. \nGenerally, as a character progresses, the subjective definition of what is trash broadens. It becomes too costly in terms of time to deal with lesser items when there are better items available. For instance, players with the appropriate skills can make use of the meat dropped by defeated animals (&lt;a href=\"Hunter\"&gt;Hunter&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"Cook\"&gt;Cook&lt;/a&gt;s especially), the cloth dropped by defeated humanoids (&lt;a href=\"Blacksmith\"&gt;Blacksmith&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Doctor\"&gt;Doctor&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"Tailor\"&gt;Tailor&lt;/a&gt;s especially), or other items. Players without those skills, however, may consider these items vendor trash. It becomes an issue of relative worth of items you can acquire and carry.\nTo those that are not &lt;a href=\"enchanting\"&gt;enchanters&lt;/a&gt;, who cannot &lt;a href=\"disenchant\"&gt;disenchant&lt;/a&gt;, most soulbound items are vendor trash, unless they have a specific need for the item. Even a &lt;a href=\"rare\"&gt;rare&lt;/a&gt; item with great stats that do not suit your character (+int for a &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt;) can be useless, and may even have a low vend value. If you aren't going to use it and you can't sell it to another player, and you can't make it something else, it is clutter in your inventory, and you might as well vend it for what you can get, regardless of what it is hypothetically worth to the right character type. A great weapon or armor of a type you can never equip, earned in a quest, would be an example of this. Hence, think before you roll on an item that someone else can use. Boss drops tend to bind, and many vend for very little relative to their real worth.\nSome items do not even have a sell price. Among these are average drops, but also there are &lt;a href=\"quest%20Item\"&gt;quest-only items&lt;/a&gt; that you might get too many of, and since you can't sell them, you have to trash them. There are a few 4-slot quest reward bags that have no vend value when you outgrow them. These items are technically not vendor trash, since you can't even sell them, but can be classified as &lt;a href=\"junk\"&gt;junk&lt;/a&gt;. These must be destroyed when you need to clear them from your inventory.\nOne use of vendor trash is by enchanters who apply level-inspecific enchants such as &lt;a href=\"Fiery%20Weapon\"&gt;Fiery Weapon&lt;/a&gt; to them. Since they are rarely &lt;a href=\"BoP\"&gt;BoP&lt;/a&gt; items, they can be used repeatedly by &lt;a href=\"alt\"&gt;alt&lt;/a&gt;s or sold at the auction house. They are mainly useful for allowing new or low-level alts to quickly run through early content.\nJunk items are marked with the in the &lt;a href=\"bag\"&gt;bag&lt;/a&gt;s when at a vendor.\nNotes.\n\"Vendor Trash\" is also the name of a &lt;a href=\"WoW%20Radio\"&gt;WoW Radio&lt;/a&gt; show by Slanik. The shows logo is of a &lt;a href=\"Goblin\"&gt;Goblin&lt;/a&gt; gun vendor in &lt;a href=\"Booty%20Bay\"&gt;Booty Bay&lt;/a&gt;. The show ended on July 11th 2008, as Slanik could no longer host it."}

Its purpose was to increase damage, and thus &lt;a href=\"threat\"&gt;threat&lt;/a&gt;, for tanks in order to compete with the increased DPS gained in later tier end-game content. It did this by granting a percentage of damage taken as &lt;a href=\"attack%20power\"&gt;attack power&lt;/a&gt; for a limited period.\nVengeance was a bonus provided to all tanking &lt;a href=\"specialization\"&gt;specialization&lt;/a&gt;s, ie Blood &lt;a href=\"Death%20knight\"&gt;Death knight&lt;/a&gt;s, Guardian &lt;a href=\"Druid\"&gt;Druid&lt;/a&gt;s (in &lt;a href=\"Bear%20Form\"&gt;Bear Form&lt;/a&gt;), Brewmaster &lt;a href=\"Monk\"&gt;Monk&lt;/a&gt;s, Protection &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt;s and Protection &lt;a href=\"Warrior\"&gt;Warrior&lt;/a&gt;s (in &lt;a href=\"Defensive%20Stance\"&gt;Defensive Stance&lt;/a&gt;).

Changing to a different form (with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Cat%20Form\"&gt;Cat Form&lt;/a&gt;) or stance would prevent additional Vengeance from being gained, but not cancel the existing stacks of Vengeance. However &lt;a href=\"Cat%20Form\"&gt;Cat Form&lt;/a&gt; was a specific exception to this and would cause the Vengeance effect to be cancelled.\nClass-specific abilities.\nEach tanking spec had its own version of Vengeance:"}
