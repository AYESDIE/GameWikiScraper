Some of them are the result of &lt;a href=\"infernal\"&gt;infernal&lt;/a&gt; rubble and &lt;a href=\"Infernal%20Debris\"&gt;debris&lt;/a&gt;' corruption seething into the ground in the &lt;a href=\"Shatter%20Scar%20Vale\"&gt;Shatter Scar Vale&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Felwood\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt;, although the fel taint there is slowly diminishing. They can also be found in other fel-influenced areas.\nIn the RPG.\nEntropic beasts were once &lt;a href=\"fire%20elemental\"&gt;fire elemental&lt;/a&gt;s that have since been tainted with the corruption of &lt;a href=\"Felwood\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt;. Their flames form vaguely man-like shape that advances angrily, blazing with a greenish fire that hints of corruption. Driven mad by their exile, they now seek to destroy all living things. Entropic beasts resemble fire elementals in all but their greenish tint. As they haunt areas of severe destruction, such as the &lt;a href=\"Shatter%20Scar%20Vale\"&gt;Shattered Vale&lt;/a&gt;, they may be tied to such areas in some way. If they detect an intruder in the broken landscape, they attack without question until they or the invader are destroyed. Although they do not attack each other or other fire elementals, entropic beasts do not communicate or cooperate, unless they happen to be wandering in the same area at the same time some unlucky traveler happens across them. Entropic beasts blaze up to 12 feet high and weigh 300 pounds. They may once have been able to speak or understand Kalimag, but do so no longer. Entropic beasts savagely attack anything that intrudes on their domain except other entropic beasts, entropic horrors, or fire elementals. They seem to delight particularly in setting creatures afire and watching them burn to death.\nAn entropic horror looks exactly like an entropic beast and is just as insane. Its true nature becomes evident only when it engages in combat, for the unnatural fire that burns within it drains the life from its opponents. Like entropic beasts, entropic horrors attack any living thing they encounter, ruthlessly and without remorse."}

The sentries patrol the northwest part of the Isle, so if the area near the harbor has too may players, move farther west."}

However, it may also belong to &lt;a href=\"Darion%20Mograine\"&gt;Highlord Darion Mograine&lt;/a&gt; (see below).\nIn Icecrown Citadel.\nFury also appears at &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Light's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, standing behind Highlord Mograine; like other NPCs in the room, the horse will charge to attack enemies in range, like &lt;a href=\"the%20Damned\"&gt;the Damned&lt;/a&gt; attacking Light's Hammer. It will also occasionally join players in attacking mobs in the next room, such as the awakened &lt;a href=\"Deathbound%20Ward\"&gt;Deathbound Ward&lt;/a&gt;s.\nConfusion: Who is Fury's rider?\nFury's presence in Icecrown Citadel has led to some confusion, as it was implied that &lt;a href=\"Iydallus\"&gt;Iydallus&lt;/a&gt;, who appears in the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Vanguard\"&gt;Argent Vanguard&lt;/a&gt;, was Mograine's deathcharger, and that Fury belonged to Salanar. If Fury \"was\" the steed of Salanar, it is unclear how Mograine was able to obtain it. However, if Fury was in fact Mograine's steed, it brings Iydallus' status into question. It's possible that Iydallus was simply used by Mograine in his guise as &lt;a href=\"the%20Ebon%20Watcher\"&gt;the Ebon Watcher&lt;/a&gt;, and that Fury is in fact his \"normal\" steed, however, Iydallus may have been actually Fury, as the Ebon Watcher was Darion Mograine. There has been no official explanation behind this inconsistency, so any reasoning is speculative at best. It is also possible that Fury was accedentally placed as Darion's horse in Icecrown Citadel as an oversight by developers. It is also possible that Mograine has two horses, one of which may or may not have been Salanar's."}

His partner was sent to investigate some strange things near &lt;a href=\"Shield%20Hill\"&gt;Shield Hill&lt;/a&gt; when they were attacked by the undead. He wants you to find what became of his partner &lt;a href=\"Orfus%20of%20Kamagua\"&gt;Orfus of Kamagua&lt;/a&gt;, last seen near the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Lift\"&gt;Ancient Lift&lt;/a&gt;.\nYou find Orfus near the Ancient Lift. He tells you that the path just to the east was a hunting trail. However the hunters have been returning, saying that the dead have risen and are out for blood. Orfus asks for someone to brave the undead and find out what happened at Shield Hill, and why.\nYou venture southeast from the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Lift\"&gt;Ancient Lift&lt;/a&gt; to Shield Hill south of &lt;a href=\"New%20Agamand\"&gt;New Agamand&lt;/a&gt;, near the southernmost point of the peninsula. There you find that someone has been ransacking graves. The dead took exception to that, and have been roaming the area, some of them fairly powerful.\nYou find:\nBetween them, it's blatant that a crew of pirates has been here, looting and plundering. You return to Orfus with the bad news.\nUndercover among the pirates.\nWhat need be done is obvious: recover and return the artifacts. While he bundles up the items you recovered, he tells you about the Kalu'ak's war against the &lt;a href=\"Northsea%20Freebooters\"&gt;Northsea Freebooters&lt;/a&gt;. If anyone can help, it is &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Atuik\"&gt;Elder Atuik&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Kamagua\"&gt;Kamagua&lt;/a&gt;.\nFortunately, Kamagua is just a short ride away. \"Short\" being a relative term. In this case, it refers to a ride from the top of a huge cliff to an island some distance out to sea aboard a rickety gondola on an ancient lift.\nWaiting in the village at the bottom of the lift is Elder Atuik. Orfus had reported in previously about the ghosts, and is glad to hear that progress has been made. Looking over the debris you brought back, he tells you about the defenses the pirates at &lt;a href=\"Scalawag%20Point\"&gt;Scalawag Point&lt;/a&gt; have set up.\nFortunately, one of the pirates deserted upon seeing the effects of the artifacts, and has been exchanging information (and passing \"mis\"information back to the pirates) in exchange for food and supplies. &lt;a href=\"Grezzix%20Spindlesnap\"&gt;Grezzix Spindlesnap&lt;/a&gt; has anchored nearby, and he can get you in with the pirates.\nGrezzix is happy to help you, as long as he doesn't have to go back, or ... do any real work. He has &lt;a href=\"Lou%20the%20Cabin%20Boy\"&gt;Lou the Cabin Boy&lt;/a&gt; row you to Scalawag Point. (Once you see the size of Lou's arms, you know you don't want to arm wrestle him. All that rowing has really bulked him up!)\nFollowing Grezzix's directions, you contact &lt;a href=\"%22Silvermoon%22%20Harry\"&gt;\"Silvermoon\" Harry&lt;/a&gt; a human who has an obsession with the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;. And the first thing he does is give you fashion tips. But then, since you're actually trying to blend in a bit here, it's not entirely out of line.\nHarry tells you that everyone who has come into contact with the artifacts has ended up dead, missing, or both. Almost like they were cursed or something...\nHarry is willing to help you, but only on two conditions. First, that you find and bring back his &lt;a href=\"sin%27dorei\"&gt;sin'dorei&lt;/a&gt; scrying crystal, and second, that if you find the artifacts, you don't bring them back.\nThe crystal, he tells you, has been fed to one of the &lt;a href=\"orca\"&gt;orca&lt;/a&gt;s in the bay, named . Well, that much is clear enough at least. You swim out into the bay, and locate an orca fitting the description of Scoodles, and perform the crystalectomy without anaesthetic. (Sadly, the patient died before the procedure.)\nYou bring the crystal back, and Harry ... well, it's plain that he's not all there. Still, he describes as much detail as he can about where the artifacts went. And repeats that no, he doesn't want you to bring them back to camp!\nFinding the artifacts: the Armor, the Heart, and the Staff.\nThe armor was being brought back to Scalawag Point when the ship was attacked by a Forsaken Destroyer. Harry was on that ship. (What he doesn't say is that the ship turned tail and fled, being brought down after a long stern chase ... headed East, away from reinforcements.) The Forsaken boarded the vessel, looted it, and beached it offshore from &lt;a href=\"Baelgun%27s%20Excavation%20Site\"&gt;Baelgun's Excavation Site&lt;/a&gt;, Southeast of the &lt;a href=\"Stonewall%20Lift\"&gt;Stonewall Lift&lt;/a&gt;.\nYou don't have to trek all the way over there on foot, though. Harry offers the use of his &lt;a href=\"Harry%27s%20Bomber\"&gt;bomber&lt;/a&gt; (!) to get there and back. You talk to &lt;a href=\"Alanya\"&gt;Alanya&lt;/a&gt; and find out more than you care to about Harry's obsession, but you do get that promised ride.\nWhen you get there, the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; are long gone, but &lt;a href=\"Kvaldir\"&gt;Kvaldir&lt;/a&gt; ghosts are everywhere. You dodge most of them (and are forced to engage a few) in searching the shipwreck for the armor. Sure enough, it is in the back of the cargo deck, surrounded by ghosts. Wiping off ectoplasm, you grab the armor and make good your escape. And hey, Harry's bomber is still there for a ride back to Scalawag point.\nHarry tells you that &lt;a href=\"%22Mad%22%20Jonah%20Sterling\"&gt;\"Mad\" Jonah Sterling&lt;/a&gt; was driven insane by &lt;a href=\"The%20Frozen%20Heart%20of%20Isuldof\"&gt;Isuldof's frozen heart&lt;/a&gt;. He left the rest of the pirates and holed up in a cave on the north side of the island. Harry tells you that Jonah threw the heart in the back of the bear den, with &lt;a href=\"Hozzer\"&gt;Hozzer&lt;/a&gt;. Well protected, if you can call it that, but the damage to Jonah's sanity was already done by then.\nYou beard Jonah in his lair. Or more properly, when he finds you there he flies into a rage and attacks. The ensuing duel was mighty. Both were experts... Well, not expert enough. You beat Jonah back enough that he leaps into the bear pit. Instead of defending him, though, Hozzer simply devours Jonah. You realize \"(whether you're after the spyglass or not)\" that to get to the heart, you have to go through Hozzer. You bind your wounds and rest up; Hozzer is happy to sleep off his recent meal. But having taken care of the master, you make even shorter work of the beast, and claim the frozen heart from its place in the den.\nThe ship that was carrying &lt;a href=\"the%20Staff%20of%20Storm%27s%20Fury\"&gt;the Staff of Storm's Fury&lt;/a&gt; was abandoned off the coast of the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Spears\"&gt;Isle of Spears&lt;/a&gt;, north of Scalawag Point. The only person left on the ship is &lt;a href=\"Abdul%20the%20Insane\"&gt;Abdul the Insane&lt;/a&gt;, and he didn't come by his ekename trivially. He seems to have taken on some of the power of the staff in exchange for his sanity.\nYou go to &lt;a href=\"Iskaal\"&gt;Iskaal&lt;/a&gt; on the Isle of Spears, and board the boat. Perhaps you manage to avoid Abdul entirely, sneaking into the hold of the ship. Perhaps you challenge him, and defeat him, possibly in a duel, more likely in as unfair a fight as you can manage. Either way, you retrieve the staff, all the while hoping to hold onto your own sanity...\nFinding the artifacts: The Shield.\nUnlike the other artifacts, Harry doesn't know right were to find the shield. But he knows who to ask. That'd be &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Ellis\"&gt;Captain Ellis&lt;/a&gt;, captain of the &lt;a href=\"Sister%20Mercy\"&gt;Sister Mercy&lt;/a&gt;. Only thing is... the whole crew of the Sister Mercy were killed about a month ago. Yep. All full of ghosts.\nThere's a small island that the ship stops at between Scalawag Point and &lt;a href=\"Sorlof%27s%20Strand\"&gt;Sorlof's Strand&lt;/a&gt;, where they take on more souls for the ship's crew. You wait for a visit of the ship and step aboard.\nCaptain Ellis tells you that yes, he had been bringing the shield back, but the giant &lt;a href=\"Sorlof\"&gt;Sorlof&lt;/a&gt; (of Sorlof's Strand, of course) took it. To take it back, you'll need to help them kill Sorlof and take his booty. For that, though, he needs blasting powder run up from belowdecks. Why? The gunners have mutinied, and they have the powder stores. It seems that even on a ship crewed by zombie pirates, you can't get good help.\nYou take on the task, and kill a number of &lt;a href=\"Mutinous%20Sea%20Dog\"&gt;skeletal pirates&lt;/a&gt; and relieve them of their &lt;a href=\"Barrel%20of%20Blasting%20Powder\"&gt;blasting powder&lt;/a&gt;. \nReturning to the deck, Captain Ellis has you man &lt;a href=\"the%20Big%20Gun\"&gt;the Big Gun&lt;/a&gt;, a gargantuan cannon at the bow of the Sister Mercy. The crew has secured it to fire to starboard, where they'll be passing Sorlof. The ship pauses while you fire The Big Gun (and the rest of the crew fires other guns). It takes several shots to knock the &lt;a href=\"stone%20giant\"&gt;stone giant&lt;/a&gt; to pieces, but his treasure is waiting when you do.\nCaptain Ellis hands you the &lt;a href=\"The%20Shield%20of%20the%20Aesirites\"&gt;Shield&lt;/a&gt;, and you head back to &lt;a href=\"Orfus%20of%20Kamagua\"&gt;Orfus&lt;/a&gt;.\nRepairing the damage.\nAs you bring each item to Orfus, he reminds you that all four need to be returned if the ghosts are to be appeased. Finally, though, you have all four of them.\nOrfus returns the bundle of artifacts to you, to return to the graves. Return them, you do, but it is too late. The spirits have been called, and the doom may not be averted. The Kalu'ak people are even now beset in the &lt;a href=\"Borean%20Tundra\"&gt;Borean Tundra&lt;/a&gt;, but that's a different story.\nOrfus asks you to warn his people about the oncoming attacks. You take the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Lift\"&gt;Ancient Lift&lt;/a&gt; back to &lt;a href=\"Kamagua\"&gt;Kamagua&lt;/a&gt;, and return to &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Atuik\"&gt;Elder Atuik&lt;/a&gt;.\nElder Atuik thanks you for your warning, and starts the battle preparations.\nRewards.\nCompleting this quest chain will give you 5,420 reputation with the &lt;a href=\"Kalu%27ak\"&gt;Kalu'ak&lt;/a&gt;, enough to catapult you from to , very nearly to .\nThe final quest also awards you your choice from among:"}

It is surrounded by hostile forces, most notably the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Deatholme\"&gt;Deatholme&lt;/a&gt;. Resources are therefore in perennial short supply, and communications from &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt; are at best infrequent.\nTranquillien is populated by both &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;. The two races have formed a &lt;a href=\"faction\"&gt;faction&lt;/a&gt; that is overseen by &lt;a href=\"Dame%20Auriferous\"&gt;Dame Auriferous&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"High%20Executor%20Mavren\"&gt;High Executor Mavren&lt;/a&gt;, along with their lieutenants, &lt;a href=\"Advisor%20Valwyn\"&gt;Advisor Valwyn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Deathstalker%20Maltendis\"&gt;Deathstalker Maltendis&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, as the Scourge advanced upon Silvermoon City and the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; were forced to abandon Tranquillien. The town soon fell into disrepair, but was recently retaken by a coalition of blood elves and Forsaken. The two races now use Tranquillien as their base of operations from which they launch attacks aimed at retaking the Ghostlands.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;war against the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, the town came under attack by the Scourge once again.\nLayout and services.\nTranquillien is small, with only limited services available. There are only two &lt;a href=\"profession%20trainer\"&gt;profession trainer&lt;/a&gt;s present - &lt;a href=\"blacksmithing\"&gt;blacksmithing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"cooking\"&gt;cooking&lt;/a&gt;. Equipment such as armor and weaponry are in short supply and available from only one source. However, there are &lt;a href=\"class%20trainers\"&gt;class trainers&lt;/a&gt; for every Blood Elf class located inside the inn.\nA road divides Tranquillien into an eastern and western half. On the eastern side is an inn run by &lt;a href=\"Innkeeper%20Kalarin\"&gt;Innkeeper Kalarin&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Magistrix%20Aminel\"&gt;Magistrix Aminel&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"apothecary\"&gt;apothecary&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Terellia\"&gt;Terellia&lt;/a&gt;, a general goods vendor, are both found on the second floor. At the entrance to the inn is a mailbox and nearby are &lt;a href=\"Master%20Chef%20Mouldier\"&gt;Master Chef Mouldier&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"cooking\"&gt;cooking&lt;/a&gt; trainer and supplier, and &lt;a href=\"Blacksmith%20Frances\"&gt;Blacksmith Frances&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"blacksmith\"&gt;blacksmith&lt;/a&gt; trainer who tends the local anvil and forge.\nCertain vendors are located north and south of the inn. Most notable among these is &lt;a href=\"Provisioner%20Vredigar\"&gt;Provisioner Vredigar&lt;/a&gt;. He will sell items to players, based on their reputation.\nOpposite the inn is a tower where you can find the offices of Dame Auriferous and High Executor Mavren. North of Dame Auriferous' and High Executor Mavren's headquarters, on a slight rise surveying the Dead Scar, is the flight master &lt;a href=\"Skymaster%20Sunwing\"&gt;Skymaster Sunwing&lt;/a&gt;.\nReputation and rewards.\nAs a &lt;a href=\"reputation\"&gt;reputation&lt;/a&gt; faction, Tranquillien is fairly easy to earn favor with. Players start at with it, and reputation gains are abundant when questing through the &lt;a href=\"Ghostlands\"&gt;Ghostlands&lt;/a&gt;. Most Tranquillien-related quests give 1,000 reputation, and one quest\u2014&lt;a href=\"The%20Traitor%27s%20Destruction\"&gt;The Traitor's Destruction&lt;/a&gt;\u2014offers a tidy sum of 8,000 reputation.

These players are also probably sick of waiting in queues to get into their realm because it's full! Transferring for this reason leads to faster gameplay for an entire guild.\nReliability.\nSome guilds formed on an older server that had persistent problems due to older, un-upgraded hardware. So, these guilds try to identify a newer hardware server in the assumption performance and reliability will be better. This reason is very similar to faster gameplay, but includes reliability. There is nothing worse than a server crash in the middle of a long 40-man raid instance run.\nBringing Friends Back Together.\nMany players in the World of Warcraft have created new players and leveled them up, only to discover that they have real life friends playing on a different server! Of course, now they can just transfer their characters to another realm and join them. But who's server should they transfer to? When a large group of players have this situation in common, they may decide to all transfer to a new server to eliminate this confusion. A transfer guild is formed.\nTo be the new \"Top Dogs\".\nAnother reason (that few guilds will admit to) is for a lower ranked guild (in regards to Raid progression) to become the TOP-ranked guild on a newer server. This guild will have weapons and armor that no one has even heard of on these servers. This can make a guild feel very good. For this reason alone, many players in WoW look down upon transfer guilds because they feel like they are being given unearned respect.\nTo Be Forgotten.\nFor whatever reason, a guild may have achieved a bad reputation on their realm. By transferring their guild, they have a chance to start fresh and either change their ways and be liked, or act in the same way. The character transfer service gives them a chance to start over.\nYour guild moved without you.\nSo one day, you log on only to find that you are suddenly guildless. If this was because your guild changed faction or realm, you will receive the following letter from Customer Support:\nThe link will open your web browser to log into your &lt;a href=\"Battle.net\"&gt;Battle.net&lt;/a&gt; account's Character Transfer page so you may transfer your character. If you don't know \"where\" your guild has gone, you can click the links to visit the World of Warcraft site to search for your guild, or a guild member's name. If you still cannot find anyone, do not want to pay the requested fee, or find that they moved somewhere undesirable for you (including moving at all), perhaps parting ways was, in the end, for the best."}

Valid items whose appearance the player has not yet collected are highlighted in their tooltips. All soulbound items are automatically added to the player's transmog collection, as well as all quest rewards from completed quests, even if the player did not choose that reward.\nBy visiting special NPCs, players can browse all available transmogs for any item currently equipped, and replace its appearance with the chosen transmog. Transmogrifying an item costs a variable sum of gold, but can be reverted for free. Hiding armor is also free.\nTransmogrification has a number of restrictions, and not all items or pairings can be transmogged. Most importantly, the character must be able to equip both items, armor must be of the same &lt;a href=\"Armor%23Armor_types\"&gt;armor type&lt;/a&gt;, and weapons must use the same &lt;a href=\"%23Weapon%20compatibilities\"&gt;attack style&lt;/a&gt;.\nTransmogrifying.\nTo transmogrify gear, visit a transmogrifier NPC:\nThe &lt;a href=\"Deployable%20Attire%20Rearranger\"&gt;Deployable Attire Rearranger&lt;/a&gt; also allows cheap and portable transmogrification services.\nRight-click on the NPC. You will be presented with the transmogrification interface, which shows your current equipment, similar to the standard character equipment window. Selecting any item will display in the right hand pane all alternate appearances collected for that item. Appearances selected will be immediately previewed in the character pane.\nOnce you are happy with the appearance, press 'Apply' to apply all selected transmogs (and/or reversions), for the stated price in gold.\nThe cost to transmogrify any item is its vendor value, with a minimum of at level 90. Lower-level characters have an adjusted minimum cost.\nIf you don't want to perform the transmogrification, simply close the window or walk away.\nObtaining transmogs.\nSubject to certain restrictions, gear from nearly any source can be used to transmogrify, such as: world drops, quest rewards, badge vendors, and crafting.\nCollecting appearances is one reason to run old content such as raids. World events often reward special items intended for transmog, as do various game elements such as professions. The auction house is also a good source, though desirable items may command high prices.\nFor the dungeon sets 1 and 2 from Vanilla, which are no longer obtainable, you can buy replicas from vendors at the &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Faire\"&gt;Darkmoon Faire&lt;/a&gt;. These items were specifically made available for transmogrification.\nTransmogrification rules.\nWeapon compatibilities.\nIn general when transmogrifying weapons, target and source have to be of the same type. However, this restriction has been relaxed in certain ways since the introduction of Transmogrification. As stated at the beginning of the article, the player in question must be able to use the source and the target; this also includes being the appropriate level for using an item. For example, a druid can equip a polearm or a staff, and transmog one into the other. However a mage cannot transmog their staff into a polearm because they cannot equip polearms.\nWeapon types that can be transmogrified to each other:\nThis leaves daggers, fist weapons, wands, shields and off-hand items as incompatible to other weapon types.\nHidden transmog.\nThere are items that are unlocked by default in the transmogrification UI that can be used to hide a specific piece. It is not possible to hide the Legs slot, out of a desire by Blizzard to \"keep it classy\".\nTransmogrification set.\nA transmogrification set or transmog set, more broadly categorized as a &lt;a href=\"vanity%20set\"&gt;vanity set&lt;/a&gt;, is a group of items of the same &lt;a href=\"armor%20type\"&gt;armor type&lt;/a&gt; designed with the same visual style and spanning at least two armor slots. A character wearing the set or a transmogrification of the set will tend to have a consistent appearance, so they are often collected purely for this purpose. They should not be confused with gameplay-affecting &lt;a href=\"armor%20set\"&gt;armor set&lt;/a&gt;s, which grant &lt;a href=\"set%20bonus\"&gt;set bonus&lt;/a&gt;es when worn together.\n\"Transmog set\" may also refer to \"any\" group of items to which a player has (or had, or intends to have) his or her gear transmogrified. This may range from a true vanity set designed by Blizzard artists, a mix of items custom selected to achieve an unusual in- or out-of-universe look, or a simple grab-bag of preferred items with little regard given to matching or composition."}

Some items in-game are only obtainable through transmutation.\nRequirements.\nAll transmutations require the alchemist to have a &lt;a href=\"Philosopher%27s%20Stone\"&gt;Philosopher's Stone&lt;/a&gt; or any of the variants of the &lt;a href=\"Alchemist%20Stone\"&gt;Alchemist Stone&lt;/a&gt; equipped or in their inventory.\nMost transmutations are on a shared &lt;a href=\"cooldown\"&gt;cooldown&lt;/a&gt;.

Given that a single transmute can result in up to 5 items, long stretches of \"no additional results\" may result.\nBecoming a transmutation master prevents you from being a &lt;a href=\"Potion%20Master\"&gt;Potion Master&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Elixir%20Master\"&gt;Elixir Master&lt;/a&gt;, however you can switch at any time by speaking with the Alchemy trainer in Orgrimmar or Stormwind:\nRecipes.\nArtisan.\nAt 250 Alchemy, &lt;a href=\"Alchemist%20Pestlezugg\"&gt;Alchemist Pestlezugg&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Tanaris\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt; sells and .

When a &lt;a href=\"breath\"&gt;breath&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"fatigue\"&gt;fatigue&lt;/a&gt; meter reaches 0, the player takes damage every few seconds, until they surface or leave the high pressure area. \n&lt;a href=\"Druid\"&gt;Druid&lt;/a&gt;s have an &lt;a href=\"Aquatic%20Form\"&gt;Aquatic Form&lt;/a&gt; that protects them from drowning, and increases their swimming speed by 50%, raising their swim speed to be level with normal run speed. In addition, &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; spells and Elixirs of (Greater) Water Breathing allow you to breathe underwater, and &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s may also cast a spell to allows them to walk on water. &lt;a href=\"Rogue\"&gt;Rogue&lt;/a&gt;s can now use a minor &lt;a href=\"Rogue\"&gt;Rogue&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Glyph\"&gt;Glyph&lt;/a&gt;s: &lt;a href=\"Glyph%20of%20Blurred%20Speed\"&gt;Glyph of Blurred Speed&lt;/a&gt; that allows them to walk on water during &lt;a href=\"Sprint\"&gt;Sprint&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; have a racial ability which helps them last longer underwater, increasing their breath by 300%. In addition, &lt;a href=\"engineer\"&gt;engineer&lt;/a&gt;s at level 230 can create &lt;a href=\"Deepdive%20Helmet\"&gt;Deepdive Helmet&lt;/a&gt;s to breath permanently underwater.\nThere is also a trinket called &lt;a href=\"Hook%20of%20the%20Master%20Angler\"&gt;Hook of the Master Angler&lt;/a&gt;, one of the prizes for being the winner in the &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Fishing%20Extravaganza\"&gt;Stranglethorn Fishing Extravaganza&lt;/a&gt;. It turns the user into a fish, increasing their swim speed by 100% as well as allowing underwater breath, though the effect cancels upon strike, which in a sense makes druid aquatic form more desirable in some scenarios.\n&lt;a href=\"Warlocks\"&gt;Warlocks&lt;/a&gt; can now use a minor &lt;a href=\"Warlock\"&gt;Warlock&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Glyph\"&gt;Glyph&lt;/a&gt;s: &lt;a href=\"Glyph%20of%20Unending%20Breath\"&gt;Glyph of Unending Breath&lt;/a&gt; that increases the swim speed of targets affected by the spell by 20%.\nTeleportation.\nDeath.\nUpon dying, your character will be teleported to the nearest graveyard. You can either run back to your body and choose a place to resurrect nearby or just ask the &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Healer\"&gt;Spirit Healer&lt;/a&gt; to resurrect you at the &lt;a href=\"graveyard\"&gt;graveyard&lt;/a&gt;.\nDark Iron Mole Machine.\nDark Iron dwarf &lt;a href=\"Mole%20Machine%20%28racial%29\"&gt;Mole Machine (racial)&lt;/a&gt; summons a &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20Mole%20Machine\"&gt;Dark Iron Mole Machine&lt;/a&gt; allowing transportation to certain areas. More can unlocked by finding them in the world."}

When stealth isn't an issue and time is abundant, the trap thumper is the best way to check a hallway, door or lock to trigger any countermeasures left for the unwary.\nThe trap thumper resembles a spring-loaded, 3-foot-tall, heavy leather bag with two short feet. The device also has an armature probe for checking locks. Winding the trap thumper sets it into one of three modes.\n\"Thumping:\" When set in this mode, the clumsy leather creation hops up and down, traveling forward at a speed of 10 feet to a preset distance (up to 100 feet, decided on by the activator). This pattern sets off any pressure plates, triggers or pit traps that may be in the tumper's path.\n\"Probing:\" In this mode, the device extends the armature and pokes the end of it into a lock or hole to see if there are any traps within. A leather pad indicates pinbricks or bites, and a small, soft, felt tip on the end of the probe becomes damp when exposed to poison. The \"finger\" of the trap thumber will probe up to 10 times before requiring a replacement pad.\n\"Baiting:\" This is the most innovative mode. The thumper crawls forwards at a speed 30 feet to a preset distance (up to 100 feet, decided on by the activator). Once at its destination, the leather-clad trap thumper moves back toward its point of origin while making noise to draw attention to its motion."}

A skilled brewer and very powerful &lt;a href=\"monk\"&gt;monk&lt;/a&gt;, Chen enjoys taking life easy as he travels from place to place. He truly made a name for himself when he joined &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rokhan\"&gt;Rokhan&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"The%20Founding%20of%20Durotar\"&gt;The Founding of Durotar&lt;/a&gt;, helping the new nation defend against a &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tiran&lt;/a&gt; invasion force led by &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Daelin Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;. Chen continued his travels while staying mostly out of major affairs for several years until &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; was revealed to the rest of the world. With his niece &lt;a href=\"Li%20Li%20Stormstout\"&gt;Li Li&lt;/a&gt;, he joined the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; in exploring the rediscovered continent. Chen serves as a major character during Pandaria's storyline and the subsequent &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Rebellion\"&gt;Darkspear Rebellion&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nChen Stormstout was born and raised alongside his brother, &lt;a href=\"Chon%20Po%20Stormstout\"&gt;Chon Po Stormstout&lt;/a&gt;, on the &lt;a href=\"Wandering%20Isle\"&gt;Wandering Isle&lt;/a&gt;, a massive landmass on the back of the giant turtle &lt;a href=\"Shen-zin%20Su\"&gt;Shen-zin Su&lt;/a&gt;. They belong to the Wandering Isle branch of the Stormstout family. The main branch of his family remained in the ancestral homeland of &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;. On the Wandering Isle, he developed his superior fighting skills and the desire to explore and discover new lands (and new ingredients for his legendary brews) like the traveling pandaren who left Pandaria thousands of years past. Chen often visited the &lt;a href=\"Wood%20of%20Staves\"&gt;Wood of Staves&lt;/a&gt; to get inspiration. The brothers would also be told about how their ancestors &lt;a href=\"Mab%20Stormstout\"&gt;Mab Stormstout&lt;/a&gt; and her son &lt;a href=\"Liao%20Stormstout\"&gt;Liao Stormstout&lt;/a&gt; left Pandaria for the turtle.\nDuring his days training as a fighter, Chen was close friends with &lt;a href=\"Strongbo\"&gt;Strongbo&lt;/a&gt;. The two both knew that someday they would challenge each other to decide who would be the master of the Wandering Isle's martial arts school, taking the position of \"Geomaster\". However, over time Chen grew a sense of wanderlust and would often laze about daydreaming. Bo attempted to tell him that all they would need was at their home. They had an argument, and on the day of their challenge Chen did not appear - he had left the island, leaving behind his friends and family. Chon Po felt as if he'd been abandoned, as leaving the island caused Chen to miss his brother's wedding, as well as other important events.\nThe Brewfest.\nAt some point, most likely before traveling to Durotar, Chen found his way to &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Morogh\"&gt;Dun Morogh&lt;/a&gt; and the famous &lt;a href=\"Grimbooze%20Thunderbrew\"&gt;Grimbooze Thunderbrew&lt;/a&gt;, challenging the dwarf to a drinking contest to decide who was the better brewer. In the end, when the two were nearly passed out, Chen declared Grimbooze to be superior. However, Grimbooze liked Chen's beer more. After a brief and lighthearted argument, the two decided to hold a contest in Dun Morogh for all dwarves to taste their drinks and decide. &lt;a href=\"Coren%20Direbrew\"&gt;Coren Direbrew&lt;/a&gt; whined his way into getting a position in the contest as well. In the end, Chen and Grimbooze were neck-in-neck where Coren only had two votes, one from himself and one from Chen out of pity. The Dark Iron attacked then in anger, and Chen fought him off. Grimbooze's brew was declared the victor by a single vote. This contest Chen helped to establish was the origin of &lt;a href=\"Brewfest\"&gt;Brewfest&lt;/a&gt;. When Chen traveled onward, he left behind his &lt;a href=\"Jug%20of%20a%20Thousand%20Cups\"&gt;Jug of a Thousand Cups&lt;/a&gt; with Grimbooze.\nHe fought alongside King &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; for at least part of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; and was declared a friend of &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Founding of Durotar.\nChen's journeys eventually brought him to the land of &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;, and his latest brew had a plethora of strange ingredients that he feared would be too hard to acquire. He almost lost hope for his recipe when he was met by &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt; the traveling &lt;a href=\"mok%27nathal\"&gt;mok'nathal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"beastmaster\"&gt;beastmaster&lt;/a&gt;. Chen asked Rexxar to retrieve the ingredients for his brew - a &lt;a href=\"Keg%20of%20Thunderwater\"&gt;barrel of Thunderwater&lt;/a&gt;, the egg of a thunder phoenix, and a sprig of &lt;a href=\"thunderbloom\"&gt;thunderbloom&lt;/a&gt;.\nChen was overjoyed when Rexxar returned with the ingredients, and then mixed his special brew and offered some to Rexxar, who nearly toppled over from the shock of the volatile beverage! Then &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt; asked if Chen was trying to kill him, probably in the rhetorical sense but possibly not.\nChen surmised that he would have to further examine the recipe, having completed one phase of his journey, Chen decided to pause his brewing and join Rexxar's adventure, so that he might better appreciate this beautiful, rugged land he had found himself in.\nChen and company went on a secret mission to &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore Isle&lt;/a&gt; to help the Horde find out why the humans were attacking them. They met with Jaina Proudmoore, who decided to help them out, after seeing what her father had done. Chen helped Rexxar to defend &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and Durotar from &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; incursions. When the Horde was prepared they launched an attack that ended with the death of &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Admiral\"&gt;Grand Admiral&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;. While some called Chen a hero of the Horde for his role at Theramore, the brewmaster's own later memories of the event painted the situation in a more complex light.\nAfter the battle, Chen spent some time in Durotar teaching the brewmaster ways to the mentor of &lt;a href=\"Brewmaster%20Drohn\"&gt;Brewmaster Drohn&lt;/a&gt; before traveling on. No one knows where he left afterwards, but several of his empty kegs have been found scattered throughout the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt;. Like the rest of his people, he maintained his independence, joining neither the Horde nor the Alliance.\nMore adventures.\nSome time later, Chen was on a boat departing from &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; that was attacked by a group of privateers. They found him sleeping below deck, though when attempting to rob him Chen fought them off swiftly. However, what Chen did not see was a small box in his possession being stolen by a gnome in the privateer crew. The box held a slip of paper reading \"Thunderbrew\", the vote he originally would have cast during the drinking contest before deciding to vote for Coren Direbrew instead.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, Chen went off searching for a rare ingredient, &lt;a href=\"indellium\"&gt;indellium&lt;/a&gt; hops, for his brews. He came across goblin machines clear-cutting a swath of destruction through the valley forest where the last of the indellium grew. With the help of a &lt;a href=\"Keeper%20of%20the%20Grove\"&gt;Keeper of the Grove&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Keeper%20Orremin\"&gt;Keeper Orremin&lt;/a&gt;, Chen fought the goblins off but the damage had been done: only two clusters of the hops had survived. Orremin offered a handful of hops in return for saving them, but as it was so rare Chen declined taking it from the valley.\nChen would come across an orc &lt;a href=\"blademaster\"&gt;blademaster&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Rahjak\"&gt;Rahjak&lt;/a&gt;, who was looking for great fighters. Chen won the fight, but little did he know how it would come back to haunt him. Humiliated, Rahjak ventured to &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; and drank demon blood, becoming a &lt;a href=\"fel%20orc\"&gt;fel orc&lt;/a&gt; so he could have the power to win next time.\nOnce, Chen was held captive by three &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s who argued if he would taste like bear, rabbit, or crow. Chen suggested they each go hunt one of those animals to have the tastes fresh in their minds for when they ate Chen, and he would also brew beer for them. The ogres did so, cooking their meals, and Chen brewed their beer. After a night of eating, drinking, and partying, Chen - as the only sober one in the group - got up and walked away to freedom.\nHe once participated in a drinking contest with five dwarves at &lt;a href=\"Aerie%20Peak\"&gt;Aerie Peak&lt;/a&gt;. At some point he visited the land formerly known as southern &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20of%20Sorrows\"&gt;Swamp of Sorrows&lt;/a&gt;, now called the &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt;, indicating that he may have wandered the land even before the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;.\nChen once visited &lt;a href=\"Sholazar%20Basin\"&gt;Sholazar Basin&lt;/a&gt; where he encountered the &lt;a href=\"Oracles\"&gt;Oracles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Frenzyheart%20Tribe\"&gt;Frenzyheart Tribe&lt;/a&gt;.\nOther stories told by Chen about his journeys include tricking &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt;s into making themselves into a stew and teaching &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Avatar\"&gt;ice avatars&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"frost%20giant\"&gt;frost giant&lt;/a&gt;s to dance.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nChen's existence is hinted at when &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; players find any of the many &lt;a href=\"Chen%27s%20Empty%20Keg\"&gt;Chen's Empty Keg&lt;/a&gt; scattered around the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt;. Finding one of these kegs can start a player on the short &lt;a href=\"Chen%27s%20Empty%20Keg%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Chen's Empty Keg (quest)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"quest\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt; chain (3 quests) from &lt;a href=\"Brewmaster%20Drohn\"&gt;Brewmaster Drohn&lt;/a&gt; who also gives a few bits of lore.\nHe will also send the player a letter containing the &lt;a href=\"Pandaren%20Monk\"&gt;Pandaren Monk&lt;/a&gt; pet if they purchased it.\nIt would be revealed years later that, towards the end of the events of &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt;, Chen also traveled to &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. There, he met the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;, and spent some time there before eventually returning to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nLi Li's Travel Journal (Part 1-4).\nChen's letters to his niece, &lt;a href=\"Li%20Li%20Stormstout\"&gt;Li Li Stormstout&lt;/a&gt;, are what spark her desires to explore her home, and eventually beyond.\nPearl of Pandaria.\nAfter following in Chen's tracks, his niece &lt;a href=\"Li%20Li%20Stormstout\"&gt;Li Li&lt;/a&gt; was kidnapped by &lt;a href=\"Rahjak\"&gt;Rahjak&lt;/a&gt; and brought to an island where &lt;a href=\"Zhahara%20Darksquall\"&gt;Zhahara Darksquall&lt;/a&gt; demanded to know where she could find the &lt;a href=\"Pearl%20of%20Pandaria%20%28item%29\"&gt;Pearl of Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;. Miraculously, Chen appeared out of nowhere on a &lt;a href=\"X-53%20Touring%20Rocket\"&gt;X-53 Touring Rocket&lt;/a&gt; just in time to save his old friend Bo from dying to Rahjak's sword. Bo was bleeding heavily from his torso, but Rahjak and Chen dueled, climaxing with Chen's &lt;a href=\"Storm%2C%20Earth%2C%20and%20Fire\"&gt;Storm, Earth, and Fire&lt;/a&gt; spell against the Blademaster's &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20Image\"&gt;Mirror Image&lt;/a&gt;. Chen was able to steal the orc's sword at just the right moment, throwing it to spear Zhahara through the chest to save Li Li from her. Rahjak attempted to attack Chen from behind, but he was stabbed by Bo.\nBo and Chen greeted each other after many years apart, but Bo was dying and knew it. He asked Chen to take Li Li home to the Wandering Isle, and the two left on Chen's rocket he had come to the island on as his old friend died watching the sunrise. Chen greeted his brother Chon Po and the rest of the Wandering Isle's citizens as he returned home for the first time in years. Li Li asked if someday they would go looking for &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, and Chen decided that for the time being he was just happy to be home.\nQuest for Pandaria.\nPart 1.\nHaving returned to his homeland for the first time in many years, Chen went about settling into his first permanent home. A small cottage with comfortable furniture, pans hanging over the stove and shelves full of dishes, scrolls, and decorations, he was happy and satisfied to begin this, to him, \"new adventure.\" Ever the brewmaster Chen spent his time with experimental brewing projects, even though there isn't a diversity or variety of brewing ingredients on the Wandering Isle.\nHaving been invited over for dinner at &lt;a href=\"Chon%20Po\"&gt;Chon Po&lt;/a&gt;'s home, an argument erupted between Chon Po and Li Li over &lt;a href=\"Pearl%20of%20Pandaria\"&gt;past adventures&lt;/a&gt;. When Chen tried to tactfully end the argument, Chon Po stated that if Li Li had not run off, Bo would still be alive, upsetting her. At Chon Po insisting that nothing ever bad happened when one stayed put on the Wandering Isle, Chen cited &lt;a href=\"Xiu%20Li%20Stormstout\"&gt;Xiu Li's&lt;/a&gt; drowning as a fact that that wasn't true at all. As Chen and Chon Po spoke more on the back porch, Chen realized that Chon Po didn't so much disapprove of Li Li, as he was transferring his frustration about Chen leaving years ago onto her. Li Li would later come to Chen's cottage and expressed her desire for them to go adventuring together. Chen at first refused, saying that his home on the Wandering Isle was more of an adventure to him because he never had a home of his own. When she left in frustration, Chen couldn't help but smile, nothing that their family was a \"hard-headed bunch.\"\nWhen the long thought dead &lt;a href=\"Wanyo\"&gt;Wanyo&lt;/a&gt; suddenly reappeared, Chen was among the elders who spoke to him. When Li Li ventured off the island for another adventure with the Pearl of Pandaria, Chen was confronted by Chon Po and informed that Li Li had left a letter. Although he agrees with his brother that he should find Li Li due to her youth, Chen warned him that he would not force her to return against her will. He then prepared to depart as soon as possible in order to catch up with his niece.\nPart 2.\nChen found Li Li at &lt;a href=\"Stonefire%20Tavern\"&gt;Stonefire Tavern&lt;/a&gt;, where he learned that she had the Pearl of Pandaria and her vision. Chen then made the decision Li Li in finding Pandaria. where she was startled by her uncle's appearance. She told him about the pearl and the vision.\nAfter Li Li looked through the pearl and saw a &lt;a href=\"Booty%20Bay\"&gt;Ramshackle wooden jetties and houses were arranged in a U shape around the bay&lt;/a&gt;. Chen and Li Li took the &lt;a href=\"Deeprun%20Tram\"&gt;Deeprun Tram&lt;/a&gt; south to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;. With the , Li Li barely knew of &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; but Chen did. \nAfter reaching Booty Bay the two became acquainted with &lt;a href=\"Catelyn%20the%20Blade\"&gt;Catelyn the Blade&lt;/a&gt;, where she and Li Li bounded over difficulties with their respective fathers. However, it didn't long for the pandaren to realize that Catelyn had stolen the Pearl of Pandaria. After confronting Catelyn and her crew a fight broke between the forces before the arrival of the &lt;a href=\"Bloodsail%20Buccaneers\"&gt;Bloodsail Buccaneers&lt;/a&gt; made both parties enter to an alliance against the pirates and &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Koslov\"&gt;Captain Koslov&lt;/a&gt;. While losing reinforcements would come in the form of Catelyn's father &lt;a href=\"Ansirem%20Runeweaver\"&gt;Ansirem Runeweaver&lt;/a&gt;, who brought other mages of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; with him.\nWith the pirates soundly beaten and Koslov fleeing the battlefield, Chen, Li Li, and Catelyn thanked her father for saving them. After mending her relationship with her father, Catelyn returned the pearl to the pandaren. Furthermore, as a thanks for aiding them against the Bloodsails, Catelyn offered to bring them to &lt;a href=\"Gadgetzan\"&gt;Gadgetzan&lt;/a&gt;, an offer that the two pandaren accepted.\nPart 3.\nAfter landing in &lt;a href=\"Tanaris\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt; the pair made their way towards &lt;a href=\"Ramkahen\"&gt;Ramkahen&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Uldum\"&gt;Uldum&lt;/a&gt;. After arriving in the city, the pair noticed &lt;a href=\"King%20Phaoris\"&gt;King Phaoris&lt;/a&gt; reading charges against prisoners, survivors of the &lt;a href=\"Neferset%20tribe\"&gt;Neferset tribe&lt;/a&gt;, and declaring that sentencing would be passed after the High Council had finished discussing it. During this time the two learned about the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Flesh\"&gt;Curse of Flesh&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Felyae\"&gt;Felyae&lt;/a&gt;, who also witnessed the event.\nThe pair would later overhead &lt;a href=\"Menrim\"&gt;Menrim&lt;/a&gt; pleading for the lives of the Neferset prisoners to be spared. As Menrim departed from the King and High Council Chen quietly commended him for having the courage to advocate mercy towards who wronged the tol'vir. In response, Menrim thanked him and then offered to host the pandaren, while they remained in the city. As they dined with Menrim, he revealed that he once belonged to the Neferset tribe, and told them how the other Neferset had thrown their lot in with &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Al%27Akir\"&gt;Al'Akir&lt;/a&gt; in order to remove the Curse of Flesh. He also informed that his own brother, &lt;a href=\"Bathet\"&gt;Bathet&lt;/a&gt;, is one of the prisoners at Ramkahen.\nLi Li would later learn that her uncle had visited Bathet in prison in order in order to see what could drive somebody to make the choice that the tol'vir did. While talking with Li Li Chen learned that Menrim worked with priests to maintain the titan devices and thus barely saw Bathet. As such Li Li theorized that Bathet came to resent his brother and ultimately joined Deathwing in order to have a place to belong to. Chen was stunned to learn from Li Li that &lt;a href=\"Strongbo\"&gt;Strongbo&lt;/a&gt; had become resentful and angry over his leaving the Wandering Isle years ago, although he did let it go before he died, and realizes that Chon Po still feels the same way. Hearing this Chen decided to come clean to Menrim about visiting his brother and suggested that he apologize in order to make for any negative feelings Bathet may hold towards him.\nLater on, the pandaren witnessed the sentencing of the Neferset prisoners, where King Phaoris allowed them the chance to speak in order for the citizens of Ramkahen to understand why King and Council came to their decision on their sentence. Chen was struck by how Bathet regretted nothing and voiced that he was with his true brothers and both pandaren left to find Menrim once the death penalty was announced. However, after meeting Menrim exploded on Chen for having the gall to demand that he apologize to someone who should be thanking him for trying to save his life.\nAfter witnessed of the prisoners both Pandaren desired to leave the city, with Li Li wondering why the Pearl would even direct them to the place. However, the pair was stopped by Menrim where the tol'vir apologized for exploding at Chen and explained that he tried to apologize to Bathet but his brother just blamed him and that he himself became so angry in turn. As they talked Menrim eventually began weeping why wondering how everything had come to this.\nMenrim then thanked the pandaren for trying to help and gave them his family boat, as he wished them luck in finding what they sought. In turn, Chen wished him peace and both pandaren later began to write a letter home. After having witnessed what resentment can do even to families, Chen opened with:\nPart 4.\nWhile traveling to &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; a storm forced Li Li over the boat and separated her from her uncle. A saddened and worried Chen would soon after be picked up by the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. After coming aboard the \"&lt;a href=\"Warchief%27s%20Fist\"&gt;Warchief's Fist&lt;/a&gt;\" Chen would be recognized by &lt;a href=\"Karrig\"&gt;Karrig&lt;/a&gt; who declared the pandaren a hero of the Horde, and was quick to inform his captain of Chen's exploits during Theramore, all those years ago. As such &lt;a href=\"Aldrek\"&gt;Aldrek&lt;/a&gt; viewed Chen's presence as a sign from the spirits and informed him of the ship's true purpose - that is being on a reconnaissance mission for the &lt;a href=\"Tides%20of%20War\"&gt;upcoming battle against Theramore&lt;/a&gt;. An uneasy Chen then preceded to play along as if he agreed with them.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Baenan\"&gt;Baenan&lt;/a&gt; arrived to serve as a diplomat, with &lt;a href=\"Nita\"&gt;Nita&lt;/a&gt; going to the Alliance, the dwarf was made a prisoner at Aldrek's command. Chen would later free Baenan and attempt to escape only to be stopped by Karrig who called Chen a traitor. However, his attempt to kill the pair was thwarted by &lt;a href=\"Talithar%20Swiftwind\"&gt;Talithar Swiftwind&lt;/a&gt;; Karriq was furious that Talithar had betrayed his duty. Talithar reiterated his proud loyalty to the Horde, though also said that the Horde does not claim all of it. He detonated all the gunpowder ammunition for the ship's cannons in the munitions hold with his fire-based magic, giving Chen and Baenan a chance to flee in the ensuing chaos. \nThe two quickly headed over to the \"&lt;a href=\"Elwynn%20%28ship%29\"&gt;Elwynn&lt;/a&gt;\" and saw &lt;a href=\"Marco%20Heller\"&gt;Marco Heller&lt;/a&gt;'s body being thrown overboard, the two preceded to aid their families against those attacking them. In the aftermath of the \"Elwynn\" sinking into the sea Baenan, Trialin, Lintharel, Atropa, and Nita found themselves moving towards land, and Chen and Li Li returning on their quest to reach Pandaria. This would come to an end when the pandaren finally landed on Pandaria and while Li Li was excited all of their friends could now come with the &lt;a href=\"Mists%20of%20Pandaria%20%28lore%29\"&gt;mists&lt;/a&gt; departed, Chen quickly realized that \"everyone\" could now come to the continent.\nLi Li's Travel Journal (Part 5-11).\nAfter landing in the Jade Forest, the Chen and Li Li wandered through the forest and stumbled upon the &lt;a href=\"saurok\"&gt;saurok&lt;/a&gt; who were terrorizing the region around the Serpent's Heart. After arriving to the Temple of the Jade Serpent, &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Sage%20Rain-Zhu\"&gt;Elder Sage Rain-Zhu&lt;/a&gt; gave them a tour around the temple's areas for helping to fend off the saurok and returning stolen jade that was being used for &lt;a href=\"Yu%27lon\"&gt;Yu'lon&lt;/a&gt;'s statue. Before leaving, Li Li gave him the Pearl of Pandaria and she rode on a cloud serpent for a while. For three weeks the two were wandering in the forests before entering the Valley of the Four Winds.\nAfter clearing the mess in the brewery, Gao informed Chen and Li Li about other Stormstouts who had gone to fight the mantid behind the Great Wall. He also showed them the shrine of Mab and Liao in front of the brewery and told them about Stoneplow, the birthplace of Liu Lang. After repelling the mantid invasion, Chen and Gao spent some time brewing new ales and Li Li used it to go to explore Krasarang Wilds where she wanted to find the spot where Liu Lang had set off from atop Shen-zin Su. \nWhile Li Li would have her own adventures, Chen would at some point make the journey to the &lt;a href=\"Serpent%27s%20Spine\"&gt;Serpent's Spine&lt;/a&gt; and send &lt;a href=\"Messenger%20Fishtail\"&gt;Messenger Fishtail&lt;/a&gt; to bring Li Li to his location. Upon arriving Li Li discovered that Chen had asked the &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan\"&gt;Shado-Pan&lt;/a&gt; monk &lt;a href=\"Min\"&gt;Min&lt;/a&gt; to guide her to him. However en route the duo were attacked by &lt;a href=\"mantid\"&gt;mantid&lt;/a&gt; forcing Li Li to climb down the wall, where she would eventually find her uncle and the rest of the Stormstouts.\nMists of Pandaria.\nChen Stormstout appears in, and narrates, the opening cinematic of the expansion, in which he interrupts a battle at the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Fellowship\"&gt;Shrine of Fellowship&lt;/a&gt; between a shipwrecked orc warrior and a human sea captain whose vessels had annihilated each other off the coast of Pandaria. Using his superior martial prowess he forces them to team up against him and ultimately makes them realize the beauty of their surroundings, putting an end to the conflict.\nWhen Chen arrived to Pandaria, the Temple of the Jade Serpent was attacked by saurok. Chen, alongside &lt;a href=\"Li%20Li\"&gt;Li Li&lt;/a&gt;, arrived to the temple and he helped the local pandaren by driving back enemy &lt;a href=\"saurok\"&gt;saurok&lt;/a&gt;'s forces, defeating their leader and returning stolen jade. All what he asked in return was a serpent ride for Li Li. He also traded stories, won a drinking contest and a brawl outside the &lt;a href=\"Drunken%20Hozen\"&gt;Drunken Hozen&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Dawn%27s%20Blossom\"&gt;Dawn's Blossom&lt;/a&gt;. After these events, they moved on to the Valley of the Four Winds.\nChen is particularly involved in the beginning quests of the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20the%20Four%20Winds\"&gt;Valley of the Four Winds&lt;/a&gt;, where he is visiting Pandaria for the first time with his niece, &lt;a href=\"Li%20Li\"&gt;Li Li&lt;/a&gt;, his distant family's brewery, &lt;a href=\"Stormstout%20Brewery\"&gt;Stormstout Brewery&lt;/a&gt; as well as the dungeon encompassing the building. Other than exploring Pandaria, Chen's goal appears to be to reestablish contact with the Pandaria Stormstout branch, having been separated when &lt;a href=\"Shen-zin%20Su\"&gt;Shen-zin Su&lt;/a&gt; stopped returning to the mainland. As he and Li Li are visiting farms in the valley they met a pandaren called &lt;a href=\"Mudmug\"&gt;Mudmug&lt;/a&gt;, from whom they learned about the Stormstout Brewery. Chen visits the brewery but found &lt;a href=\"Uncle%20Gao\"&gt;Uncle Gao&lt;/a&gt; who seems to be jealous of Stormstouts. After having defeated the enemies in the brewery, Chen returned to Li Li and Mudmug and set out to &lt;a href=\"Halfhill\"&gt;Halfhill&lt;/a&gt;, from where the trio and an adventurer created a new ale. After this, Chen declared Mudmug to be his \"beer brother\" and headed towards the Stormstout Brewery. However, the brewery was filled by alementals and &lt;a href=\"hozen\"&gt;hozen&lt;/a&gt;. After clearing the entrance, Chen himself headed into the brewery.\nAt the very conclusion of the Valley of the Four Winds storyline, the Shado-Pan face the invasion of the &lt;a href=\"Mantid\"&gt;Mantid&lt;/a&gt; who break through the &lt;a href=\"Serpent%27s%20Spine\"&gt;Serpent's Spine&lt;/a&gt;. When all hope seemed lost, it was Chen Stormstout who saved the day. Chen was instrumental in the defense of &lt;a href=\"Stoneplow\"&gt;Stoneplow&lt;/a&gt; village. Alongside Mudmug and his niece Li Li, Chen had successfully rallied not only the scattered pandaren population of the Valley of the Four Winds, but also managed to unite, albeit temporarily, a group of Night Elf Sentinel Castaways with a cadre of Tauren Sunwalkers to cooperate and work together to defend Stoneplow Village from the invasion of the Mantid. This marked the first time Alliance and Horde forces had fought together side by side for a common cause since the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Angrathar%20the%20Wrathgate\"&gt;Battle of Angrathar the Wrathgate&lt;/a&gt;. \nWhile having a drink at &lt;a href=\"The%20Lazy%20Turnip\"&gt;The Lazy Turnip&lt;/a&gt;, Chen was also asked by the adventurer on behalf of &lt;a href=\"Ella\"&gt;Ella&lt;/a&gt; to taste her brew. Chen liked it and recommended that Ella could speak with Uncle Gao about joining the Stormstout Brewery. Chen and Li Li are also present during the &lt;a href=\"Wanderer%27s%20Festival\"&gt;Wanderer's Festival&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Turtle%20Beach\"&gt;Turtle Beach&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Krasarang%20Wilds\"&gt;Krasarang Wilds&lt;/a&gt; after Li Li found its location during one of her adventures.\nAfter hearing that the rest of the Stormstouts on Pandaria had traveled beyond the &lt;a href=\"Serpent%27s%20Spine\"&gt;Serpent's Spine&lt;/a&gt; to fight the mantid, Chen went after them. &lt;a href=\"Big%20Dan%20Stormstout\"&gt;Big Dan Stormstout&lt;/a&gt; was found sleeping at the &lt;a href=\"Sunset%20Brewgarden\"&gt;Sunset Brewgarden&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Dread%20Wastes\"&gt;Dread Wastes&lt;/a&gt;. Chen then found the body of &lt;a href=\"Evie%20Stormstout\"&gt;Evie Stormstout&lt;/a&gt;, who was slain by the mantid. Taking her body to a secluded grove by the northern cliffs, Chen had a short funeral for the young girl.\nChen then finds &lt;a href=\"Han%20Stormstout\"&gt;Han Stormstout&lt;/a&gt; encased in amber beneath &lt;a href=\"Kor%27vess\"&gt;Kor'vess&lt;/a&gt;. Assuming him dead within the amber, Chen drags the amber block to the Sunset Brewgarden.\nHe later finds &lt;a href=\"Mama%20Stormstout\"&gt;Mama Stormstout&lt;/a&gt; in a chamber beneath the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Fear\"&gt;Heart of Fear&lt;/a&gt; being mind-controlled by the mantid.\nChen can be found near the grave of Evie Stormstout, along with &lt;a href=\"Big%20Dan%20Stormstout\"&gt;Big Dan Stormstout&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mama%20Stormstout\"&gt;Mama Stormstout&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Han%20Stormstout\"&gt;Han Stormstout&lt;/a&gt; and Li Li.\nLandfall.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Binan%20Village\"&gt;Binan Village&lt;/a&gt;, Chen is seen taking care of &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; after the events of the &lt;a href=\"Dagger%20in%20the%20Dark\"&gt;Dagger in the Dark&lt;/a&gt; scenario. He tasks the player with gathering needles to help Vol'jin deal with the poison in his body, and afterwards takes the troll to &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan%20Monastery\"&gt;Shado-Pan Monastery&lt;/a&gt; to recuperate.\nShadows of the Horde.\nAfter saving Vol'jin and bringing him to the &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan%20Monastery\"&gt;Shado-Pan Monastery&lt;/a&gt;, Chen watched his friend heal alongside a human named &lt;a href=\"Tyrathan%20Khort\"&gt;Tyrathan Khort&lt;/a&gt;, who he also brought to the monastery, while helping the Shado-Pan with daily chores, such as sweeping snow off the monastery's steps. During this time he was told that he could not bring any more people to the monastery by &lt;a href=\"Taran%20Zhu\"&gt;Taran Zhu&lt;/a&gt; and was able to address &lt;a href=\"Yalia%20Sagewhisper\"&gt;Yalia Sagewhisper's&lt;/a&gt; concern about Vol'jin and Khort possibly fighting each other while at the monastery.\nAs a result of his presence at the Shado-Pan Monastery, he and Yalia grew close with one another to the point that they shared their life stories with another on the way to &lt;a href=\"Zouchin%20Village\"&gt;Zouchin Village&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, upon reaching the village Chen was able to convince Yalia to reunite with her family and found himself bonding and becoming an instant hit with her family as well. Such joy was not meant to last, as Vol'jin, Khort, and a group of Shado-Pan came to defend the village after realizing that the Zandalari were going to attack. Though wanting to stay and defend the village that had become a home for him, Chen understood that the villagers would need the leadership of a pandaren to lead them to safety with Yalia and his niece by his side.\nAfter ensuring that villagers would be safe and instructing his niece to stay with them to help protect them, Chen traveled back to monastery where he joined Vol'jin, Khort, and a small group of Shado-Pan monks as they traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt; in order to prevent the Zandalari from resurrecting &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Kao\"&gt;Warlord Kao&lt;/a&gt;, a general of the &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen\"&gt;Thunder King's&lt;/a&gt;. However, the group ended being captured by the Zandalari, bore witness to the resurrection of Warlord Kao, and were imprisoned by the Zandalari on the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Isle of Thunder&lt;/a&gt;. However, with Vol'jin's help, Khort, Chen, and &lt;a href=\"Brother%20Cuo\"&gt;Brother Cuo&lt;/a&gt; were able to escape the isle and returned to the Shadow-pan Monastery.\nAfter returning from the Isle of Thunder, Chen joined &lt;a href=\"The%20Thirty-three\"&gt;The Thirty-three&lt;/a&gt; in order to defend the monastery from the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt;. It was while preparing traps for that enemy that Yalia and Chen admitted their feelings, kissed, and stated their desire to start a family. After successfully repealing the Zandalari onslaught Chen and Yalia parted ways with him promising to return that he &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Rebellion\"&gt;helped&lt;/a&gt; Vol'jin and Yalia promised to wait for him while she helped the Shado-Pan.\nEscalation.\nChen joins Vol'jin when the Darkspear Chieftain returns to &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt; and begins the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Rebellion\"&gt;Darkspear Rebellion&lt;/a&gt;. After reuniting with &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, Sen'jin Village becomes attacked by &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Hellscream's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron\"&gt;Kor'kron forces&lt;/a&gt;. As the fighting erupts, Chen and Thrall work together, as &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s help push back the assault. With the Kor'kron invasion failing Vol'jin then rallies his forces for an attack on &lt;a href=\"Razor%20Hill\"&gt;Razor Hill&lt;/a&gt;. While Thrall journeys to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; to find dissidents against Hellscream, Chen decides to aid the Darkspear in taking Razor Hill for the rebellion. After the people of Razor Hill join the rebellion, Chen joins Vol'jin at the &lt;a href=\"Razor%20Hill%20Watchtower\"&gt;Razor Hill Watchtower&lt;/a&gt; and directs any adventurer helping the shadow hunter to &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; to help an &lt;a href=\"The%20Old%20Seer\"&gt;old sage up a mountain&lt;/a&gt;.\nTimeless Isle.\nChen can be found in the Celestial Court on the Timeless Isle with Li Li.\nLegion.\nChen and Li Li were at the &lt;a href=\"Peak%20of%20Serenity\"&gt;Peak of Serenity&lt;/a&gt; in Kun-Lai, instructing a group of children when the monastery was attacked by the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. With the aid of a &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;master monk&lt;/a&gt;, they fight against the demons and deliver the children to safety. After the Peak is destroyed, Chen returns with the survivors to the Wandering Isle, where he plays a part in the formation of the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Broken%20Temple\"&gt;Order of the Broken Temple&lt;/a&gt;.\nChen and Li Li later enter a competition held by &lt;a href=\"Xuen\"&gt;Xuen&lt;/a&gt; to gain &lt;a href=\"The%20Fist%20of%20Ra-den\"&gt;The Fist of Ra-den&lt;/a&gt;. They battle &lt;a href=\"Rehgar%20Earthfury\"&gt;Rehgar Earthfury&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Farseer of the Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt; for it. It is revealed that Chen has a rivalry with Rehgar.\nChen participated in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Exodar\"&gt;Battle for the Exodar&lt;/a&gt; battling against &lt;a href=\"High%20General%20Rakeesh\"&gt;High General Rakeesh&lt;/a&gt;, along with &lt;a href=\"Li%20Li\"&gt;Li Li&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpring Balloon Festival.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Spring%20Balloon%20Festival\"&gt;Spring Balloon Festival&lt;/a&gt;, Chen can be found at the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Shandaral\"&gt;Ruins of Shandaral&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=\"Crystalsong%20Forest\"&gt;Crystalsong Forest&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; where he offers &lt;a href=\"Chen%27s%20Balloon\"&gt;balloon&lt;/a&gt; rides for groups of three. During the ride, he admitted that despite his fond memories of traveling in Northrend, he never spent much time in Crystalsong Forest and that he met the &lt;a href=\"gorloc\"&gt;gorloc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Oracles\"&gt;Oracles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"wolvar\"&gt;wolvar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Frenzyheart%20tribe\"&gt;Frenzyheart tribe&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Sholazar%20Basin\"&gt;Sholazar Basin&lt;/a&gt;, who he found to be strange creatures. He then encouraged his guests to share their stories as he focused on making sure that he didn't crash the balloon into &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nUpon hearing word that &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"clan\"&gt;clan&lt;/a&gt;s set their sights on the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt;, Chen and his niece Li Li were among those who came to defend the Vale. To their shock, they discovered that the mogu had overtaken the plains of &lt;a href=\"Kun-Lai%20Summit\"&gt;Kun-Lai Summit&lt;/a&gt;. Chen deduced that the mogu saw the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Lotus\"&gt;Golden Lotus&lt;/a&gt;'s focus on &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt; as a perfect time to strike the Vale. Thus seeking to stop them, Chen, Li Li, and &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Azeroth's champion&lt;/a&gt; mounted &lt;a href=\"Chen%27s%20Kite\"&gt;Chen's Kite&lt;/a&gt; in order to scout their numbers. However, during their mission, the three came under fire and were forced to the ground, and Chen was injured and the kite reduced to a big ball of flames. With his head hurting from his injuries, Chen declared that the only solution would be for his allies to bring the abandoned brew caravan and save the brew. Chen was confident that not only would this bring him back to full strength, but it would do wonder for the morale of those fighting in the Vale. To that end, the &lt;a href=\"yak\"&gt;yak&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mobi\"&gt;Mobi&lt;/a&gt; was rescued from the mogu who had conquered the &lt;a href=\"Chow%20Farmstead\"&gt;Chow Farmstead&lt;/a&gt; and used to deliver the brew to Chen.\nWhile Chen focused on the brew, Li Li called upon her allies to strike against the mogu in the hopes of thinning out their numbers to make their escape easier. As apart of this, she also tasked them with taking out the mogu commanders in the hopes that it would slow down and distract the mogu armies. With the mogu thinned, Chen, Li Li, and the Azeroth's champion used the yak to head back to the safety of the &lt;a href=\"Gate%20of%20the%20August%20Celestials\"&gt;Gate of the August Celestials&lt;/a&gt;. Determined to further thin the mogu ranks before they invaded the Vale, Li Li used the brew as a weapon against them, much to her uncle's melancholy. Deciding to look on the bright side, Chen happily noted that they were fewer mogu to contend with. Knowing that they did all they could, the group headed off to &lt;a href=\"Mistfall%20Village\"&gt;Mistfall Village&lt;/a&gt; in order to inform the &lt;a href=\"Rajani\"&gt;Rajani&lt;/a&gt; of what they were up against.\nIn the aftermath, the Stormstouts came to reside in Mistfall Village where they appear to be aiding the Shado-Pan &lt;a href=\"Taoshi\"&gt;Taoshi&lt;/a&gt; in the defense of the vale.\nDragonflight.\nChen traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;, where he could be discovered fishing in the &lt;a href=\"Waking%20Shores\"&gt;Waking Shores&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe later received word from &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; of the death of &lt;a href=\"Bovan%20Windtotem\"&gt;Bovan Windtotem&lt;/a&gt; and subsequently traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Ohn%27ahran%20Plains\"&gt;Ohn'ahran Plains&lt;/a&gt; to meet with him. After arriving at &lt;a href=\"Toghusuq%20Village\"&gt;Toghusuq Village&lt;/a&gt;, he also reunited with &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rokhan\"&gt;Rokhan&lt;/a&gt; who had also traveled to the village after hearing of their old friend's passing. After the trio decided to help with the restoration of the village, Chen stated that as far as he traveled there were some sights that are not forgotten easily, and that returning Baine to his father was one of those sights. He then mentioned how the relief and joy in Cairne's eyes that day still brightened his heart, and that he was happy to have played a part in that moment. He then recalled how Bovan had a much larger role in that, as without his keen sight, he would not have witnessed the memory that he still treasured.\nAs he gazed upon the beauty of the Ohn'ahran Plains, Chen expressed his hope that wherever Bovan's travels take him now, it was done so with him at peace.\nQuotes.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nAt &lt;a href=\"Crystalsong%20Forest\"&gt;Crystalsong Forest&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"Spring%20Balloon%20Festival\"&gt;Spring Balloon Festival&lt;/a&gt;.\nHappy Balloon Day! Interested in a balloon ride?\nBattle for Azeroth.\nWell, this is a fine mess. But not one that has to doom us.\nDragonflight.\nI have traveled near and far, and seen many things, but there are some sights you do not easily forget.\nReturning Baine to his father was one of those sights. The relief, the joy... it still brightens my heart. I'm happy to have played a small part in bringing that moment to pass.\nBovan was a much larger part of it all. Without his keen sight, I would not have witnessed the memory that I still treasure to this day.\nThese lands are beautiful, aren't they? No wonder Bovan sought them out. Wherever his travels take him now... I hope he is at peace.\nIn Heroes of the Storm.\nChen is a in \"&lt;a href=\"Heroes%20of%20the%20Storm\"&gt;Heroes of the Storm&lt;/a&gt;\".\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

The raid plays a sort of chess match against &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlthough the analogy to chess is usable (Daemons are \"stronger\" than Footmen for example), it's not very strict. The pieces from the event behave very differently from real chess pieces, in particular the pieces autoattack enemy pieces they face, automatically cast their spells (but do not move) when not controlled by a player, and the Kings are actually the strongest pieces in the game. In order to start the event, a player has to take control of the King piece of their own faction. The objective is to kill the enemy King without losing one's own King. If the game is won, a &lt;a href=\"Dust%20Covered%20Chest\"&gt;Dust Covered Chest&lt;/a&gt; appears with loot. If the game is lost, the pieces reset, and another game may be attempted.\nAfter a victory, the pieces are reset and it is possible to play a friendly game within the raid. Whenever a game is going on, there is a silence debuff in the chess room to prevent clearing the trash mobs leading to &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Malchezaar\"&gt;Prince Malchezaar&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is possible to reset the event by talking to the Echo of Medivh.\nUnlike other bosses, there is no reputation reward.\nChess Piece Abilities and Control.\nAfter the event begins, raid members can control any currently uncontrolled piece of their own faction by talking to it. Upon taking control of a piece the player character is teleported onto a platform at the side of the chess field. The player gains the \"control piece\" buff, his viewing perspective changes to that of the controlled piece, and their action bar is replaced. It is possible to release control of a piece by removing the control buff (right-click it). This incurs a 15 sec debuff, during which time it is not possible to take control of another piece.\nThe action bar for controlling a chess piece has the following layout:\nThe abilities can either be activated by clicking on the action bar, or by using keys 1 through 4. It's faster to use the key shortcuts, particularly because the movement controls have a timeout. Each chess piece auto-attacks if it faces an enemy. While pieces can move diagonally, they can only face towards four directions. After a diagonal move, pieces turn 45\u00b0 clockwise to realign themselves. \nMovement and rotation share a common cooldown of 5 seconds, and the special abilities have another shared cooldown of 5 seconds. If an ability has a cooldown of more than 5 seconds, the other ability is only affected by the 5 second cooldown.\nWarning: Medivh Cheats!\nMedivh cheats at random intervals during the game. Although on paper the effects look tough, in reality they usually have little effect on the course of the event.\nStrategy.\nThe king is quite strong and thus should be used in an offensive way \u2014 he is in fact similar to a DPS tank (be cautious though). A reasonable kill order is to deal with the enemy healers first, then drop the queen, and finally the king. If king and queen work together efficiently, and have good support from the bishops, the combats on the remainder of the board are less important. The friendly healers should move only very little, and concentrate on keeping the king and the queen at top health.\nOne simple strategy is to have each player chose one non-pawn piece which they want to control later. Then, each player moves the pawn in front of their piece as far as needed, releases control and takes over their \"real\" piece. As soon as holes in the pawn line appear, attack with the player controlled pieces. This is an excellent strategy for higher-levels trying to complete this event in a five-man or other smaller raid. By having a few players concentrate, at the start, on moving pawns and 'unplayed' pieces forward, these pieces are in range to auto-engage combat. \nA more sophisticated strategy has four players initially controlling the four central pawns, and four other players on the king, the queen and both knights. The two remaining raid members should take the bishops. This allows to move the offensive pieces more quickly.\nThis event can be beaten with one person. First, move as many pawns one square ahead as possible, to give the back row of pieces room to move from the fire when the Echo of Medivh inevitably cheats. As soon as fire appears under a piece, control it and move it out of the way. Then play the queen piece and focus on damaging the opponent's king from range. Switch to a bishop to heal the king if necessary.\nMacro.\nA macro can be used to gain a slight speed edge over using mouse clicks to gain control of / cancel control of pieces. This is especially recommended for soloing, since multiple pieces will need to be swapped between, and the player will need to react to Medivh's cheating quickly. The following macro cancels control with a modified click / keypress (i.e. with alt, control, or shift), or takes control of a piece that has been spoken to with a simple click / keypress. Players will still need to right-click on a piece they wish to control.\n /cancelaura [mod] Control Piece\n /run SelectGossipOption(1);\nAlternatively, a player may split this into two macros. Since the encounter does not involve any traditional combat, players are free to swap macros into their action bar in any convenient location (although the 1-9 keys will still be replaced with the unit's control keys, so should not be used).\nQuotes.\nTo pass beyond my Hall, you must defeat me in a game of skill! Control your king when you are ready to begin..."}

He was still only a child when the &lt;a href=\"red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; destroyed Grim Batol along with the Dragonmaw, and was one of the few too weak to evade capture by the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; when the rest of the clan escaped into the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Highlands\"&gt;Twilight Highlands&lt;/a&gt;. What he knew of his clan he had learned from stories recounted by veterans of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, and from the dreams that plagued his restless nights. Koak would eventually be one of the countless orcs freed from the &lt;a href=\"Internment%20camps\"&gt;internment camp&lt;/a&gt; by then &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Warchief Thrall&lt;/a&gt;. When the Dragonmaw clan rejoined the Horde after the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, Koak found that he was unable to rejoin them due to a feeling he dishonored himself and the Dragonmaw by being kept in captivity.\nWhile on a &lt;a href=\"zeppelin\"&gt;zeppelin&lt;/a&gt; it would come under attack by an Alliance &lt;a href=\"gunship\"&gt;gunship&lt;/a&gt; and Koak was the only known survivor of the crash. When he awoke, a dying &lt;a href=\"cloud%20serpent\"&gt;cloud serpent&lt;/a&gt; was discovered due to the zeppelin crash, and Koak was surprised to find out that the serpent remained in order to protect its egg. In the mother's dying moments, the egg hatched and it expressed its desire for Koak to care for its &lt;a href=\"Steel%20%28Cloud%20serpent%29\"&gt;hatchling&lt;/a&gt;. While initially reluctant, Koak ultimately agreed to the dying mother's request and soon found himself struggling to keep himself and the serpent alive while waiting for a rescue party, that he suspected wouldn't be sent.\nAfter witnessing members of the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Cloud%20Serpent\"&gt;Order of the Cloud Serpent&lt;/a&gt; flying their cloud serpents, Koak was reminded of what he'd heard of them and decided to seek them out in order to put the Serpent (the name he's been calling the young cloud serpent) in their care and securing a flight to the nearest Horde outpost. When he arrived at the &lt;a href=\"Arboretum\"&gt;Arboretum&lt;/a&gt; however he was convinced to remain in order to train the serpent, after seeing the hatchling as an opportunity to prove himself to the Dragonmaw.\nEarly on, having learned of the Dragonmaw's subjugation of the red dragons (and the inevitable aftermath), &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Anli\"&gt;Elder Anli&lt;/a&gt; recognized that Koak had not made a connection between the folly of the Dragonmaw's actions and their downfall. Taking him alone to the farthest spire across &lt;a href=\"Windspire%20Bridge\"&gt;Windspire Bridge&lt;/a&gt;, they discussed the Dragonmaw's ways and how Order founder &lt;a href=\"Jiang\"&gt;Jiang&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lo\"&gt;Lo&lt;/a&gt; formed a bond through compassion and trust. After Koak still opined that chains were still better than giving a choice, she stepped off the spire to his shock and reappeared on her onyx cloud serpent. On him questioning her choice had her serpent allowed her to fall to her death, she asked him a simple question: \"Do you know the difference between steel and iron?\" Perplexed, he replied that any competent warrior knew that steel was stronger, to which she agreed before riding away.\nWhile trying to train his serpent, Koak would find himself struggling with using the Order's ways and what he knew of the Dragonmaw ways of training. This would come to a head when after learning that the Horde was fracturing into &lt;a href=\"True%20Horde\"&gt;civil&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Rebellion\"&gt;war&lt;/a&gt; that Koak decided to force his serpent to obey him; an action that saw the Cloud Serpent feeling betrayed and confused before it let fled from Koak. The orc, feeling immense guilt for his actions sought out the cloud serpent he had been taking care of for months in order to apologize.\nAfter finding the serpent at the old nest, Koak opened up about his past and revealed that he had felt that he would be a \"Dragonmaw orc\" due to growing up in an internment camp and ultimately realized that he really knew nothing about what a Dragonmaw was: he was looking for the strength to regain control. After pouring out his heart his serpent began to trust him once more, and the next morning, Anli found them and led the two to the top of the spire by the old nest. She reminded Koak of her question about steel and iron, and explained that the Order of the Cloud Serpent is a &lt;a href=\"blacksmith\"&gt;blacksmith&lt;/a&gt; that forges the strongest steel through love, folding it hundreds upon hundreds of times with the utmost care, whereas the Dragonmaw (though not directly naming them) was like how a blacksmith treats iron, heating and hammering the metal until it is forced into the desired shape, which becomes blackened and brittle when it cools. The end result may seem strong for a time, but the iron will inevitably break when one needs it the most. On Koak asking what the smith should do on making a mistake, Anli answered that he needed to correct it \"while the metal is still hot,\" and perhaps it was time for him to start giving his cloud serpent a choice.\nKoak decided he would give his cloud serpent the ultimate choice, and once he had its attention, stepped off the spire before it could stop him. Though the serpent dove after him to his happiness, he at first panicked when he realized they had no saddle or reins to grab onto, but when the serpent locked its gaze with him, he saw strength. Koak understood that he needed to relinquish control, and when he relaxed the serpent swooped under him to catch him on its back. Flying together for the first time, Koak gave the cloud serpent his heartfelt thanks. With this act, Koak was inspired to bestow the name 'Steel' on the serpent and after passing overhead of the pleased Order members at the Arboretum, journeyed directly to the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Two%20Moons\"&gt;Shrine of Two Moons&lt;/a&gt; in order to aid &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;his people&lt;/a&gt; by joining the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Rebellion\"&gt;Darkspear Rebellion&lt;/a&gt;."}

They are not particularly intelligent and are notoriously cowardly, preferring to keep their distance from other, larger races. Kobolds are famous for being obsessively protective of the candles they wear upon their heads and which help them light their way through the dark tunnels they call home.\nA race of arctic kobolds known as &lt;a href=\"snobold\"&gt;snobold&lt;/a&gt;s make their home in the frozen wastes of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; has theorized that kobolds evolved from &lt;a href=\"trogg\"&gt;trogg&lt;/a&gt;s. Around the year 2,700 &lt;a href=\"BDP\"&gt;BDP&lt;/a&gt;, kobolds were among the threats that early &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; settlers faced in the &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the construction of the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;ish city of &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; workers under the command of &lt;a href=\"Gazlowe\"&gt;Gazlowe&lt;/a&gt; started dredging out tunnels beneath the city in search for underground wells. However, in doing so, they accidentally dug straight into a kobold den, and before long the \"rat-freaks\", as Gazlowe called them, overran the goblin tunnels. &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt; helped the goblins seal up the kobolds by escorting &lt;a href=\"goblin%20sapper\"&gt;goblin sapper&lt;/a&gt;s to the tunnels' support beams.\nHighmountain kobolds.\nThe kobolds of &lt;a href=\"Candle%20Rock\"&gt;Candle Rock&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Highmountain\"&gt;Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; lived in peace until the &lt;a href=\"drogbar\"&gt;drogbar&lt;/a&gt; took their caverns. But the drogbar were swallowed whole by the &lt;a href=\"Devouring%20Darkness\"&gt;Devouring Darkness&lt;/a&gt;, and the cavern became theirs again, as the kobolds were protected from the Darkness by their candles.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Spiritwalker%20Ebonhorn\"&gt;Spiritwalker Ebonhorn&lt;/a&gt;, the Darkness the kobold fear is &lt;a href=\"Uul%27gyneth\"&gt;Uul'gyneth&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiology and culture.\nKobolds are not particularly bright and are considered more an annoyance than a true danger, but they also breed like rabbits and are always found in large numbers wherever they dwell. They are only four feet tall at best, and though they have excellent vision in low-light conditions, in the darkest recesses of mines and caves they still need a source of light in order to be able to see, hence their reliance on candles. When a group of kobolds is agitated, their tails whip back and forth, and they stink horribly, regardless of whether they are alive or dead. It is said that \"For every kobold you see, there are a hundred more.\"\nKobolds are slovenly, cowardly, and pathetic by nature, though they can be riled to action when backed into a corner. Fearful of other races and possessing of limited intelligence, they usually try to stay away from populated areas where other, larger races dwell. They are fearful and skittish, and don't trust what lies beyond their noses. Kobolds are perhaps best known for their penchant for digging and their underground excavations. Even younglings are accomplished miners, able to quickly and carefully dig a tunnel large enough to allow several kobolds to pass. Hunger, panic and cave &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt;s are some of the dangers kobolds face when digging underground.\nThe kobold clans of &lt;a href=\"Highmountain\"&gt;Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; use skulls to designate their leadership, and they are unintelligent enough to believe a non-kobold to be their leader as long as they're wearing a skull. Kobolds outside the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt; appear to instead identify leaders based on who has the longest candle.\nKobolds do not honor their ancestors in the way that other intelligent races do. When a kobold die, members of their clan paw their fur and brush their cheeks against the deceased's.\nKobolds of the &lt;a href=\"Whiskersnoot%20clan\"&gt;Whiskersnoot clan&lt;/a&gt; call the &lt;a href=\"sun\"&gt;sun&lt;/a&gt; the Wickless Candle and believe it to be an enormous yellow flame that needs neither wick nor wax, hanging from a gigantic blue ceiling. If a kobold dies while under the sun, their spirit would rest and travel beneath its warm light. Those who have never left the underground caves believe it to be a myth.\nEveryday before going to sleep, young kobolds - called tenderfoots - gather to listen to bedtime stories.\nKobolds make necklaces from shiny rocks strung together.\nGlowing mushrooms adorn kobold tunnels. Mushrooms are also used in kobold cuisine, like in mushroom cakes eaten with syrup.\nCandles.\nDespite living underground, kobolds do not have keen nocturnal sight, and rely on candles to traverse the mines they call home. If there is one thing every kobold dread, it is darkness, considered a manifestation of &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt; itself and the biggest threat in the tunnels: cave-ins.\"The darkness took them\" or \"the darkness snuffed them out\" are common euphemisms used for death. However, kobold legends also speak of a dark, devouring presence deep in the caverns of Highmountain, which is the reason that the kobolds fear the dark. The &lt;a href=\"Bluewax\"&gt;Bluewax&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Candle%20Rock\"&gt;Candle Rock&lt;/a&gt; frequently mention that if a kobold's candle goes out, or if they lack a candle altogether, \"the darkness\" will \"eat them\". The Bluewax historian &lt;a href=\"Kipp%20Brightwick\"&gt;Kipp Brightwick&lt;/a&gt; tells how the Bluewax were once forced out of their home by a group of &lt;a href=\"drogbar\"&gt;drogbar&lt;/a&gt; who claimed the cave as their own. However, the drogbar did not have candles, and so \"the darkness\" began to follow them, until it finally \"swallowed them whole\", allowing the kobolds \u2014 safe with their candles \u2014 to move back in. Additionally, a &lt;a href=\"Kobold%20Candle%20%28object%29\"&gt;circle of six large candles&lt;/a&gt; can be found in the eastern part of Candle Rock. If an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; extinguishes the flames of all six candles, a large &lt;a href=\"voidwraith\"&gt;voidwraith&lt;/a&gt; called \"&lt;a href=\"Devouring%20Darkness\"&gt;Devouring Darkness&lt;/a&gt;\" will appear and attack them. However, the true Darkness they feared is &lt;a href=\"Uul%27gyneth\"&gt;Uul'gyneth&lt;/a&gt;, the herald of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt;.\nFresh ear wax is the best material to create candles. Kobolds also use wax to wax off extra hairs or make \"drip baths\".\nCompanions.\nThe Bluewax kobolds are known to keep &lt;a href=\"rat\"&gt;rat&lt;/a&gt;s as both pets and as a source of food. The critters are not afraid of the darkness the kobolds fear and they make good diggers, or \"good dinner if not\", as well as good friends, unless they bite, in which case they instead make a good meal. Additionally, they are apparently both tastier and easier to catch than &lt;a href=\"rabbit\"&gt;rabbit&lt;/a&gt;s.\nMagic.\nKobolds are simple creatures and most are only capable of earth magic. A few of them have perfected a \"rather nasty\" fireball, but little else, though their ranks are also known to contain &lt;a href=\"pyromancer\"&gt;pyromancer&lt;/a&gt;s.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"geomancer\"&gt;geomancer&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Tunnel%20Rat\"&gt;Tunnel Rat&lt;/a&gt; group, a colony loyal to the &lt;a href=\"Axis%20of%20Awful\"&gt;Axis of Awful&lt;/a&gt;, managed to figure out some kind of parlor trick which allowed them to enslave a large amount of &lt;a href=\"trogg\"&gt;trogg&lt;/a&gt;s. They were able to do this because the troggs are ultimately considered creatures of the earth.\nMost kobolds are warriors, skilled with their mining picks. Their style of fighting involves attacking with as many allies as possible, and beating the offending person(s) to death with the aforementioned mining picks. According to &lt;a href=\"Lasan%20Skyhorn\"&gt;Lasan Skyhorn&lt;/a&gt;, kobolds are very poor at mining.\nRelations.\nKobolds are frequently enslaved by &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt;s, who force the rat-like humanoids into an existence of neverending drudgery. Since their enslavement, the historically meek kobolds have grown bitter and aggressive toward any creature that meddles with their ceaseless labor.\nIncredibly, kobold clans have successfully forged ties with the vicious &lt;a href=\"harpy\"&gt;harpies&lt;/a&gt;. In Highmountain, some kobolds offer stolen and scavenged trinkets, oftentimes items that would be broken and worthless to anyone else, and the harpies provide protection for their offerings of obedience, whereas other kobolds simply trade \"shinies\" to the harpies in exchange for fresh ear wax to make more candles.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, the giant &lt;a href=\"magnataur\"&gt;magnataur&lt;/a&gt; have become strangely tolerant of the arctic kobolds or \"&lt;a href=\"snobold\"&gt;snobold&lt;/a&gt;s\", who follow the magnataur herds for safety and mutual benefit during long hunts.\nEver since the theft of the &lt;a href=\"Hammer%20of%20Khaz%27goroth\"&gt;Hammer of Khaz'goroth&lt;/a&gt;, the kobolds of &lt;a href=\"Highmountain\"&gt;Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; have become very prolific and have now become a noticeable nuisance to the &lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20tauren\"&gt;Highmountain tauren&lt;/a&gt;, who once thought them to be nothing more than overgrown rats. The Bluewax have begun raiding the &lt;a href=\"Sepulcher%20of%20the%20Sky\"&gt;Sepulcher of the Sky&lt;/a&gt; and even infiltrating &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Totem\"&gt;Thunder Totem&lt;/a&gt; itself to steal ceremonial drums while the &lt;a href=\"Skywhisker%20tribe\"&gt;Skywhisker&lt;/a&gt; have allied themselves with the &lt;a href=\"Crawliac\"&gt;Crawliac&lt;/a&gt; harpies assaulting &lt;a href=\"Skyhorn\"&gt;Skyhorn&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuotes.\nSome common kobold utterances include:\nIn the RPG.\nIntroduction.\nKobolds are little humanoids afraid to venture into the light for fear of their own shadows. Still, they fight ferociously to the death once backed into a corner.\nKobolds are &lt;a href=\"rat\"&gt;rat&lt;/a&gt;-like &lt;a href=\"humanoid\"&gt;humanoid&lt;/a&gt;s that dwell in underground tunnels and spend their lives mining, primarily for &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;. They are cowardly, cringing folk who live in fear of larger races and rarely venture outside their tunnels. However, while not powerful individually, they congregate in large numbers and can prove a nuisance and occasionally a danger.\nKobolds live in tunnels going deep into the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. Kobolds are most at home in the dark underground, as bright light causes them discomfort. As they cannot, however, see perfectly in the dark, kobolds also have a great affinity for candles.\nKobolds are cowardly and flee from most combat. Nonetheless, they are tenacious and fierce when cornered, so when their lairs (or candles) are threatened, they attack with abandon. Unfortunately for them, they are not particularly intelligent and their tactics leave much to be desired: though they are naturally stealthy, they use this ability for escape more than ambush, and they usually try to overwhelm opponents with large numbers rather than defeat them using strategic cunning. Further, kobolds are sometimes so cowardly that they refuse to help their friends when they fall under attack nearby \u2013 these craven creatures will simply go about their business (sweating in fear all the while) and hope that the troublesome adventurers will leave them alone.\nKobolds trade the gold and other &lt;a href=\"mineral\"&gt;mineral&lt;/a&gt;s they unearth to &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s and other patrons for all the goods they need to survive; occasionally they purchase protection as well. They will take over abandoned mines and scavenge equipment whenever they can do so safely.\nAppearance.\nKobolds stand between three and four feet in height and weighing between 70 to 100 pounds. The wiry creatures bear as much of a resemblance to a rat as it does to a humanoid and move with a rapid, hunched gait. Its nervousness is evident in its large, rodent-like eyes. This small, rat-like humanoid has a long snout. White hair pokes from beneath a ragged cap, on which perches a dribbling white candle. It hoists a leather pack over its left shoulder and a mining pick over its right. Its eyes glitter with wariness.\nCulture.\nSociety.\nKobolds form loose clan lineages based on bloodline. There is nothing like marriage. Young individuals migrate between nests or between larger warrens. Kobolds of all ages prefer to sleep in large groups. While there is no overt structure of government, kobolds organize in loose groups to plan out digs and scavenging. While not particularly bright, kobolds have keen senses and a good ability to read situations.\nOne of their significant accomplishments is their alliance with the harpies. Kobolds offer equipment they scavenge in return for information. The two races protect one another by proximity. Kobolds first try to avoid combat if at all possible. Traps are used to gather small food animals and protect their warrens. When pressed, kobolds will flood over a target, looking to bite at vulnerable points. When facing a significant threat, they will abandon their nests and young. The race's knack with stealth and comfort in underground environments makes it well-suited to the rogue and scout classes.\nMany kobolds wear helmets that sport lit candles. These serve as more than just light sources, for kobolds develop an attachment to their candles and the light they shed. When a kobold wears or holds a lit candle, it gains morale. However, it doesn\u2019t take much to extinguish one of these candles.\nLanguage.\nKobolds speak &lt;a href=\"Low%20Common\"&gt;Low Common&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Common%20%28language%29\"&gt;Common&lt;/a&gt;. Kobolds occasionally learn the languages of their big, scary neighbors.\nRelations.\nKobolds prefer to remain among their own kind. Many have a fear of the world above ground and of the races that live there. They are comfortable with their existence in the mines, chipping away with their picks and admiring each other\u2019s candles. Kobolds must deal with a frightening number of enemies, being generally weak, and gifted kobold fighters who are able to protect their people rise quickly to the fore. These leaders are usually rogues, warriors, or healers. Rarer are the exceptional kobolds that leave their tunnels behind, striking out on a life of adventure. Most of these have a wanderlust they cannot otherwise sate; others feel the pull of riches more keenly than their brethren, and realize that adventure may be the best way to get what they need. Friendly kobolds are possibly raised by night elves or some other race. Though ruled by fear, heroic kobolds emerge from time to time.\nSpeculation.\nThe importance of kobold candles is typically seen as a humorous source of morale for kobolds. However, the &lt;a href=\"Bluewax\"&gt;Bluewax&lt;/a&gt; use their candles as a barrier against the &lt;a href=\"Devouring%20Darkness\"&gt;Devouring Darkness&lt;/a&gt; in proximity to the dormant &lt;a href=\"C%27Thrax\"&gt;C'Thrax&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uul%27gyneth\"&gt;Uul'gyneth&lt;/a&gt;. Considering &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s crust has historically been infested by the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt;, the practice of using candles may have come from a legitimate method of keeping the power of the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; at bay."}

{"id": "15254", "revid": "3154973", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=15254", "title": "Kodo", "text": "The kodo or kodo beast (sometimes pluralized as kodos) is a large omnivorous herd animal native to the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; hold these reptilian creatures in high esteem, and breed them as &lt;a href=\"mount\"&gt;mount&lt;/a&gt;s. They are also used extensively as pack animals by both the &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; as a whole. The &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock clan&lt;/a&gt; are also known to use &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20War%20Kodo\"&gt;war kodos&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nKodo are massive reptiles with hardly visible scales and thick leathery skin that ranges in color from sandy brown to black. Most kodo have a large horn that sprouts from their nose, and some are even covered in woolly hair. Kodo range across &lt;a href=\"central%20Kalimdor\"&gt;central Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, but are particularly prevalent in &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt;, after they were brought there by tauren during the Third War, where the rolling grassy plains are particularly suited to their omnivorous nature. Wild kodo are normally herbivorous, however, and will not attack unless threatened. In the waning years of their lives, kodo instinctively trek to the &lt;a href=\"Kodo%20Graveyard\"&gt;Kodo Graveyard&lt;/a&gt; in the center of Kalimdor, where they spend their last hours. At the Kodo Graveyard there are even &lt;a href=\"Kodo%20Spirit\"&gt;Kodo Spirit&lt;/a&gt;s that have passed over to the spirit realm.\nTauren legends abound regarding the great horned kodos of Kalimdor\u2019s Barrens. Some myths tell of rare kodos that are bound to the spirits of the sky and storm, thus allowing the colossal beasts to harness the powers of lightning itself. While kodos are generally considered gentle by nature, they are fierce opponents when threatened and have occasionally been known to devour their enemies whole.\nThe green, great brown, great gray, &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt; and great golden kodos were considered alpha members of the herds in &lt;a href=\"Desolace\"&gt;Desolace&lt;/a&gt;.\nA kodo can eat its own weight in grass each day, but a lot comes out the other end.\nKodos of the Horde.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s received a pack of tamed kodo beasts as a gift from &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; in return for Thrall's generosity. The colossal kodo beasts of the Kalimdor plains then became valued allies of the orcish Horde. The mighty beasts were charged with carrying the orcs' pounding war drums into battle. The huge kodos, serving as symbols of orcish might and valor, also use their enormous size and strength to scatter enemy forces. When enraged, kodos are fond of devouring their enemies whole. The orcs now &lt;a href=\"The%20Wolf%20and%20The%20Kodo%23Notes\"&gt;tell fables about the kodos&lt;/a&gt;.\nMonths after the Battle of Mount Hyjal, kodos in Mulgore were killed by Stonetalon harpies and their meat was left to rot. They were avenged by &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt; sent by &lt;a href=\"Tagar%20%28tauren%29\"&gt;Tagar&lt;/a&gt;.\nBred for their aggressive, unpredictable demeanor by the &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron\"&gt;Kor'kron&lt;/a&gt; stablemasters, the &lt;a href=\"Black%20War%20Kodo\"&gt;Black War Kodo&lt;/a&gt;s' trumpeting call signifies that blood will soon be shed.\nBesides the Horde, &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari troll&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; used kodos in the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;. It's not stated whether they were native or brought from elsewhere by the trolls.\nAs a mount.\nKodos are the racial mount of the &lt;a href=\"tauren%20%28playable%29\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt;. Swifter and slightly smaller than their wild cousins, kodo mounts nevertheless demonstrate the same resilience and fearlessness found in their untamed brethren, traits that serve them well when bearing their equally resolute riders. The epic kodo mount can be bought at &lt;a href=\"Bloodhoof%20Village\"&gt;Bloodhoof Village&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt; kodo is the &lt;a href=\"Black%20War%20Kodo\"&gt;Black War Kodo&lt;/a&gt;. Epic kodo, unlike their slower cousins, have two &lt;a href=\"rhino\"&gt;rhino&lt;/a&gt;-like horns on their snout instead of just one. They also carry war drums that hang from the sides of their saddles, as they did when they served the orcs in battle. The &lt;a href=\"Great%20Brewfest%20Kodo\"&gt;Great Brewfest Kodo&lt;/a&gt; was the first kodo mount available to &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; players.\nAs a hunter pet.\nKodos are tamable by &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s as part of the &lt;a href=\"Scalehide\"&gt;Scalehide&lt;/a&gt; family, along with &lt;a href=\"ankylodon\"&gt;ankylodon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mushan\"&gt;mushan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"stegodon\"&gt;stegodon&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"thunder%20lizard\"&gt;thunder lizard&lt;/a&gt;s.\nIn the RPG.\nThe giant, slow-moving kodo of the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt; are one of the most intriguing species of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. Though gentle and ponderous by nature, these mighty beasts become fierce enemies when threatened or attacked. Many kodo hold a special bond with the benevolent tauren race. It is said that some rare kodo are bound to the spirits of the sky and storm. Thus, the tauren have legends about those they call &lt;a href=\"lightning%20lizard\"&gt;lightning lizard&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"salamander\"&gt;salamander&lt;/a&gt;s (not the &lt;a href=\"flamewaker\"&gt;flamewaker&lt;/a&gt; creatures), &lt;a href=\"thunder%20lizard\"&gt;thunder lizard&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"storm%20walker\"&gt;storm walker&lt;/a&gt;s. Whether or not these behemoths actually have supernatural powers remains to be seen. If one \"is\" discovered, it should be approached with extreme caution. It is said that these thunder lizards are much more hostile than their more common cousins and will attack without provocation.\nGiant grey reptilian quadrupeds, the kodo beasts wander the plains in thunderous herds. They graze primarily on quick-growing grasses, but will eat the leaves of shrubs and trees they encounter. Like many herd animals, kodo beast groups are composed of mothers and young, led by a single powerful male or female. A few younger males may be present, but they are eventually driven out to establish their own herds. Though terrifyingly large and powerful, kodo beasts are by nature quiet, lumbering animals. They are content simply to wander away from potential threats. One notable exception is when they are protecting eggs or yearlings, which are small enough to be threatened by most predators. Kodo beasts form rings around the young, barring attack with simple mass. Sufficiently annoying opponents are charged and swallowed whole. More significant threats, particularly those too large to swallow, are run down. Kodo beasts are key to tauren culture. Tauren hunt and use every part of kodos for their equipment, clothing, and food. Kodo beasts can be trained and are used as beasts of burden by the tauren and as mounts for orcs."}

The founding leader (&lt;a href=\"Khan\"&gt;Khan&lt;/a&gt;) of the Kolkar was , an alleged son of and and first of the centaur Khans. Later the clan was led by &lt;a href=\"Khan%20Dez%27hepah\"&gt;Khan Dez'hepah&lt;/a&gt; and his officers, until his death. The clan, or what remains of it, is currently led by &lt;a href=\"Khan%20Leh%27Prah\"&gt;Khan Leh'Prah&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Kolkar clan holds no alliance with their brother tribes, and constantly warring with the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and other centaur alike.\nHistory.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; struggle to reclaim their ancestral lands of &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt; leading up to the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the Kolkar of the Barrens were the main aggressor preventing the nomads from reaching their homeland. It is also likely that the &lt;a href=\"Galak\"&gt;Galak&lt;/a&gt; clan fought against the tauren during these same events. After the tauren and their &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; allies' victory over the hostile centaur, the Khans were left with nothing more than further hate towards these invading enemies, throwing all three races into an endless struggle to maintain the land.\nAround the time of the &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Durotar\"&gt;Invasion of Durotar&lt;/a&gt;, Kolkar &lt;a href=\"Khan%20Gragtor\"&gt;Khan Gragtor&lt;/a&gt; tore an orc village in &lt;a href=\"Dustwallow%20Marsh\"&gt;Dustwallow Marsh&lt;/a&gt; asunder and took several orcs as unwilling slaves to do his bidding. &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt; found the centaur camp and orc captives locked in cages. Rexxar razed the centaur camp to the ground and cut khan to pieces.\nCataclysm.\nWhen the demons that have been pouring into the area forced the &lt;a href=\"Magram%20clan\"&gt;Magram clan&lt;/a&gt; from their land in the south, the Magram moved north and defeated the Kolkar clan taking the land for their own. Only a few Kolkar centaur survived, though most that did were captured by the Magram. Khan Leh'Prah was left for dead near the border to village, which is now known as &lt;a href=\"Magram%20Territory\"&gt;Magram Territory&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome time after the Cataclysm, the Kolkar and other clans of centaur joined under the new &lt;a href=\"Aratas\"&gt;High Khan&lt;/a&gt;.\nTerritories.\nThe Barrens.\nThe Kolkar have a presence in all three oases in the Barrens: &lt;a href=\"The%20Stagnant%20Oasis\"&gt;The Stagnant Oasis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lushwater%20Oasis\"&gt;Lushwater Oasis&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"The%20Forgotten%20Pools\"&gt;The Forgotten Pools&lt;/a&gt;. Command tents and small camps can be found scattered all over the edges of the lush overgrowth surrounding these pools, identifiable by their large tribal flags. Patrols of centaur and semi-domesticated &lt;a href=\"hyena\"&gt;hyena&lt;/a&gt; control the perimeters of these settlements.\nDesolace.\nThe Kolkar clan also has representation in the traditional home of the centaur, Desolace. is the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Kolkar%20Village\"&gt;Kolkar Village&lt;/a&gt; located in the eastern parts of the zone near the mountain range bordering Mulgore. It is likely this was historically the first Kolkar settlement, founded by Khan Kolk, due to its size and proximity to &lt;a href=\"Maraudon\"&gt;Maraudon&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe restless spirit of Khan Kolk can still be found wandering the halls of Maraudon.\nDurotar.\nThe Kolkar have recently set up a small forward outpost in the orcish region of &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kolkar%20Crag\"&gt;Kolkar Crag&lt;/a&gt;, which serves as headquarters for planned assaults against the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Trials\"&gt;Valley of Trials&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sen%27jin%20Village\"&gt;Sen'jin Village&lt;/a&gt;, and even the capital city of &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;.

His oversized proportions, including a pair of massive arms, allow Kologarn to easily crush any intruders who attempt to reach the inner sanctum.\"\nAdventure Guide.\n\"Loken commanded Ignis the Furnace Master to fashion this towering giant to guard the Shattered Walkway. His massive arms allow Kologarn to pulverize any intruders attempting to reach the inner sanctum.\"\nOverview.\nKologarn's arms can be destroyed, restricting his ability to use abilities. When Kologarn's Right or Left arm are destroyed Rubble will appear.\nStrategy.\nThe fight with Kologarn is a battle for survival, not a DPS race. The stuns, Eyebeams, tank debuffs, and massive AoE damage all conspire to gradually pick off raid members until the raid cannot keep itself alive. That said, high DPS on the Right Arm is useful to ensure that it does not cast Stone Grip more than once before it is destroyed, and that it quickly drops its victims when it does cast Stone Grip.\nComposition and assignments.\nAs a battle for survival, beginning 25-man raids can bring four tanks and eight healers. At least three healers should be priests or shamans, capable of group heals to recover from AoE damage. Assign two or three healers to care for the tanks and two healers to keep the victims of Stone Grip alive. In 25-man raids, at least half of the damage-dealers should be capable of ranged AoE effects.\nThe healing and tanking requirements of the 10-man fight are considerably less severe than the 25-man, but three or four healers and two tanks are best.\nPositioning.\nKologarn remains completely stationary in this encounter at all times. He cannot be turned or range tanked. If his aggro target is not in melee range, he casts Petrifying Breath on the raid, which causes a wipe. His arms do not need to be offtanked, but can be separately targeted and hit within Kologarn's hitbox. Since their hitbox overlaps with Kologarn's, melee attackers should face his torso, not the arm itself.\nMelee, position under the Left Arm (on the right side) for 25-man. Any position is OK for 10-man. Face the torso.\nIn 25-man, two or three tanks on the torso, position front and center. Only one is required for 10-man.\nOne Rubble tank, position under the Right Arm (on the left side).\nRanged damage-dealers and healers, position in a line across the middle of the room. Stay out of melee range to avoid spell interrupts. Make sure that there is room to the back wall, and there is nobody directly behind you.\nThe fight.\nFor 25-man, two to three tanks establish a taunt rotation on Kologarn. Every 10\u201315 seconds, he casts \"Overhead Smash\". This applies Crunch Armor, which reduces the tank's armor by 25% per stack and lasts 45 seconds. Once it gets to two stacks, a tank without the debuff taunts the boss and takes over. Keeping all tanks alive is vital in order to rotate the debuffs.\nFor 10-man, Crunch Armor expires quickly, so no taunt rotation and only one tank is required on the boss.\nAll damage-dealers, attack the Right Arm until it is destroyed. Destroying it damages the torso, and eventually kills the boss.\nKilling an arm spawns a pack of Rubble earth elementals, which are picked up by a tank and killed immediately. In 25-man mode, the Rubble elementals have a point-blank AoE damage spell called Stone Nova which quickly kills any nearby characters that are not tanks. Keep away from the the Rubble and kill them with ranged AoE effects while melee attackers hit the body or the Left Arm. In 10-man mode, the Rubble can be dragged to the center and hit by melee attackers. Once all the Rubble are dead, attack either the Left Arm or the body, depending on the strategy. The Right Arm respawns 60 seconds after it is destroyed. When it respawns, all damage-dealers attack it again.\nKilling an arm four times generally does enough damage to kill the boss. Raids may wish to kill the Right Arm four times, or kill the Right Arm three times, then kill the Left Arm once.\nKolgogarn regularly casts his Focused Eyebeams at a random member of the raid, generally preferring a character who is not at close melee range. The Eyebeams slowly follow the target, kicking up stone chips and inflicting massive damage on any character they touch. Targets of the Eye Beams should run to the back of the room, then out the door and down the stairs, until Kologarn stops casting the Eyebeams. Anyone in this path must get out of the way.\nNotes.\nThe hole that holds Kologarn is in fact a hole. Do not fall in.\nThe hit box for the boss and his arms is huge and shared. Melee can hit an arm from nearly the opposite side of the room. AoE attacks that hit one of the three targets always hit and damage all three of them. Therefore, abilities like Multishot and Divine Storm are very useful for inflicting extra damage on the boss.\nHealers caught in Stone Grip or running from Eyebeams cannot heal. They should call out to let the other healers know who will need extra healing.\nStone Grip, Eyebeams, and Shockwave can all kill raid members quickly. Keep everyone a full health at all times. If you are having trouble keeping everyone topped off, bring in more group healers.\nKologarn is typically the fourth boss faced in Ulduar (after Flame Leviathan, XT-002 Deconstructor, and Razorscale). He outputs much more damage than any other raid boss seen before him. Healers may be in for a nasty shock, as they must work harder than they ever have before.\nOverhead Smash can miss or be dodged or parried to avoid an application of Crunch Armor. This delays the time at which the next tank must take over and may allow Crunch Armor to expire. Therefore, avoidance gear is preferred over stamina gear on this boss.\nDo not use AoE taunts on the Rubble elementals if you are not in melee range of the boss. Taunting the boss while out of melee range results in him casting Petrifying Breath on the raid.\nThe Right Arm is the primary target because Stone Grip, while it does less damage, is more dangerous than Shockwave. Stone Grip, in 25-man fights, can randomly stun multiple healers, leading to deaths and eventually a wipe. Also, continually attacking the Right Arm causes it to release Stone Grip victims much more quickly. Shockwave, while nasty, is at least predictable and can be managed with group heals.\nInexperienced raids tend to wipe due to Eyebeams. Avoiding them is everyone's highest priority, period. If the Eyebeams target you, run directly out the door. Do not dodge other players. It is their responsibility to get out of your way, and there should be nobody in the doorway anyway. If you see Eyebeams on someone else, make sure that you are not standing between them and the door.\nHunters and Shamans can and should put up &lt;a href=\"Aspect%20of%20the%20Wild\"&gt;Aspect of the Wild&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Nature%20Resistance%20Totem\"&gt;Nature Resistance Totem&lt;/a&gt;s to substantially decrease the damage from Shockwave and Eyebeams. This helps tremendously in keeping the raid alive, and is well worth the loss of damage output on the boss. The hunters or totems should be placed so that the auras cover the entire room.\nThe first Right Arm tends to die quickly and easily, but things can get messy after that. Use &lt;a href=\"Bloodlust\"&gt;Bloodlust&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Heroism\"&gt;Heroism&lt;/a&gt; when the second Right Arm appears, to keep it from casting Stone Grip more than once.\nRelated achievements.\nKologarn does not have a hard mode.\nQuotes.\nSound files.\nSee \"&lt;a href=\"PlaySoundFile%20macros%20-%20Ulduar%23.C2.A0Kologarn\"&gt;Sound Files of Ulduar: Kologarn&lt;/a&gt;\"\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

In life, Koltira was a valiant defender of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, and took to the field during the brutal &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20invasion%20of%20Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;invasion&lt;/a&gt;. He was killed in battle by Thassarian, and was promptly reanimated as a powerful death knight under the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;'s sway. Despite Thassarian being his killer, Koltira came to develop a strong bond with the human, the two placing inordinate amounts of value on the safety of the other (for ruthless death knights of the Scourge), and considering each other brothers in death.\nAlong with many other death knights, Koltira broke away from the Lich King's grasp when his free will was restored to him at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Battle for Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt;, and he joined the newly-formed &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Highlord%20Darion%20Mograine\"&gt;Highlord Darion Mograine&lt;/a&gt;.

Merriel was quickly slain and Faltora charged Thassarian directly, only to be quickly beaten. Koltira noticed, however, that Thassarian hesitated in killing him. While attempting to flee, Faltora was killed by an &lt;a href=\"abomination\"&gt;abomination&lt;/a&gt;, but Koltira managed to escape.\nSeveral hours later, Koltira followed and ambushed Thassarian. Feeling the conflict inside Thassarian, he offered Thassarian the choice to turn away from the Scourge and join him. Thassarian refused but spared his life until the next time they meet. The next day, the &lt;a href=\"elfgate\"&gt;elfgate&lt;/a&gt;s failed and the Scourge entered &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt; where Koltira and Thassarian continued their duel. Thassarian emerged victorious and took Koltira's life. Koltira was then raised as a &lt;a href=\"Darkfallen\"&gt;Darkfallen&lt;/a&gt; and another death knight of the Scourge. Despite being his murderer, Thassarian and Koltira developed a bond during their service under Arthas and came to see each other as brothers.\nYears later, Koltira and Thassarian were ordered by the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; to join &lt;a href=\"Darion%20Mograine\"&gt;Highlord Darion Mograine&lt;/a&gt;'s forces in crushing the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt; using the necropolis . Thassarian, Koltira, and &lt;a href=\"Orbaz%20Bloodbane\"&gt;Orbaz Bloodbane&lt;/a&gt; were stationed at . Their first mission was to go behind enemy lines and find out what they could about the &lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Dawn\"&gt;Crimson Dawn&lt;/a&gt;. During the process, Koltira got captured and Thassarian was willing to break the Scourge code concerning the weak to free him.\nAt the close of the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Battle for Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt;, in a confrontation with the Lich King, &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt; cleansed the &lt;a href=\"Ashbringer\"&gt;Ashbringer&lt;/a&gt; and freed the Knights of the Ebon Blade from the Scourge. Koltira and Thassarian parted ways, with Thassarian joining the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and Koltira unable to decide if he should join the majority of his people, now the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, or follow Thassarian into the Alliance. After Thassarian told him to go with his people, Koltira decided to join the Horde, enlisting at &lt;a href=\"Agmar%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Agmar's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Overlord%20Agmar\"&gt;Overlord Agmar&lt;/a&gt;. He was allowed to stay but he realized that he is being hunted by shadows.\nDespite their parting, Koltira and Thassarian still consider each other brothers, and Thassarian said that if Koltira ever asked him for help, he would help him.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, Koltira journeyed to the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; fortress of &lt;a href=\"Agmar%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Agmar's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt;, where he charged Horde members with powering his runeblade and striking against the local &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; threats. Later, he was aiding the Horde while on &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Orgrim's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;, dispensing missions against the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;'s power bases in the area.\nBeing a former Scourge minion, he knew many things about the Scourge and sent random soldiers to gather information about the cult, find flesh giant spines, neutralizing plague cauldrons, and kill important Scourge members. His efforts and those of &lt;a href=\"Thassarian\"&gt;Thassarian&lt;/a&gt; allowed the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; forces to break through , and , each made almost entirely of &lt;a href=\"saronite\"&gt;saronite&lt;/a&gt;, near indestructible, and manned by massive Scourge constructs, as it was the sole way for any kind of force to invade &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe later appeared with Thassarian and their brethren of the Ebon Blade in the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Darkness\"&gt;Cathedral of Darkness&lt;/a&gt;, arriving in time to battle &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; himself and relieve the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusaders&lt;/a&gt; of their unfavorable predicament. After Tirion destroyed what remained of the Lich King's heart, Arthas was temporarily wounded, and Koltira was in favor of finishing him off on the spot, however, Darion was more in favor of patience and everyone pulled back through a &lt;a href=\"%3ADeath%20Gate\"&gt;:Death Gate&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; began fighting with each other and the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; over control of &lt;a href=\"Andorhal\"&gt;Andorhal&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Western Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;. The Alliance, led by Thassarian, took control of the western portion of the town while the Horde, led by Koltira Deathweaver, took control of the eastern portion. Over the course of the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Andorhal\"&gt;Battle for Andorhal&lt;/a&gt;, Koltira sent Horde heroes to deal with the remaining Scourge forces and, after defeating them, Thassarian and Koltira entered a truce. Despite this apparent ceasefire, however, some time afterward, human farmers formed a militia and launched a sneak attack on Koltira's Forsaken forces. Koltira began to fend the Alliance forces off, and instructed the player to locate &lt;a href=\"Lindsay%20Ravensun\"&gt;Lindsay Ravensun&lt;/a&gt;, whose input Koltira had been somewhat dismissive of earlier.\nUpon meeting Ravensun, it was revealed that she was, in fact, none other than the &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Dark Lady&lt;/a&gt; herself in disguise. She sent Horde agents and &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt; to assault the Alliance forces and turn the battle around. After the Alliance was defeated, Sylvanas confronted Koltira about the truce with Thassarian, and scolded him for being weak. A portal to the Undercity was opened, and Koltira was pulled through by a hooked chain, where Sylvanas would attempt to purge him of his compassion for Thassarian and make him more of a servant of the Horde - more specifically, a servant of Sylvanas and the Forsaken.\nLegion.\nOver the years since Koltira was imprisoned, the Ebon Blade made several attempts to negotiate with Sylvanas for his release, but she refused them all. Whether he knew of this of not, Koltira never gave up hope that his order was trying to free him.\nWith the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; threatening all of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thassarian\"&gt;Thassarian&lt;/a&gt; made a personal request of the order's new &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Deathlord&lt;/a&gt; to help him rescue Koltira from the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;. Koltira is successfully broken out of the &lt;a href=\"Apothecarium\"&gt;Apothecarium&lt;/a&gt; after the Deathlord assisted Thassarian in fighting through the guards. Afterward, he remarks that he'd rather not talk about his captivity, and wants to focus on the invasion instead.\nShadowlands.\nThassarian and Koltira Deathweaver have made their way to &lt;a href=\"Oribos\"&gt;Oribos&lt;/a&gt; and are looking at the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt;. He later patrolled the interior and protected it from the &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuests.\nWhile in the service of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;:\nQuotes.\nGossip.\nWith the death of the Lich King, all I have left is my duty. There is no family, there are no friends... there is only this.\nWar.\nSpeculation.\nWhy Koltira would find himself fighting for his \"queen,\" &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Lady Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, is curious, as his stated reason for joining the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; was to reconcile with his people, now calling themselves the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;, and to fight once more for &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;. Though not directly addressed as of yet, one of the following may have been a factor:\nIt is also unknown if Koltira still considers himself a member of the Forsaken after his imprisonment in the Undercity.\nSince Thassarian is canonically the character who completed the quest &lt;a href=\"Where%20Kings%20Walk\"&gt;Where Kings Walk&lt;/a&gt;, Koltira may be the one who completed the Horde equivalent, &lt;a href=\"Saurfang%27s%20Blessing\"&gt;Saurfang's Blessing&lt;/a&gt;.\nVideo.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

At some point, he came into possession of the ancient &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;ish axe &lt;a href=\"Serathil%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Serathil&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nKor'gall was a formidable &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt; who was a member of the Stonemaul ogre clan. When the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt; was defeated at the end of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, Kor'gall is starting to hate the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orcs&lt;/a&gt; and thinks that they're too weak and soft to be their allies. For unknown reasons, the Stonemaul clan separated in two with one group remained in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; and the other group traveled to &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, where Kor'gall was among them. Kor'gall soon managed to conquered the clan and rule it for an unspecified amount of time. &lt;a href=\"Crol%27ka\"&gt;One ogre&lt;/a&gt;, whose brothers were killed by Kor'gall, knew that he was leading the clan to ruin and sought help from the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; during the events of the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Durotar\"&gt;invasion of Durotar&lt;/a&gt;.\nKor'gall was soon approached by &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"mok%27nathal\"&gt;mok'nathal&lt;/a&gt;. Rexxar demanded to join the clan and Kor'gall agreed, but only if he were to pass the Trial of Strength through the Gauntlet, a valley full of many &lt;a href=\"beast\"&gt;beast&lt;/a&gt;s. Rexxar and his friends survived the Gauntlet, and Kor'gall was impressed enough to allow Rexxar to join. Rexxar's first request was to aid the Horde against &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Admiral Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, but Kor'gall had no intention of ever honoring their former allies again. Frustrated, Rexxar exercised his right to challenge Kor'gall for leadership of the clan in the Trial of Blood. Kor'gall decided to entertain the request but warned that he was not as slow-witted as Rexxar first guessed.\nRexxar realized he underestimated Kor'gall's skills, however, he had the beasts of the wilderness to aid him as well as his skills as a hunter. Rexxar beat Kor'gall and slew him. As Kor'gall died, the last words on his ears were his men cheering for Rexxar.\nIn the RPG.\nTheir leader, the tyrannical Kor'gall, had discovered the ancient orcish axe Serathil and used the artifact to control the clan. He forced Rexxar to undergo the Trial of Strength, running a monster-filled gauntlet, to join. Rexxar succeeded, but Kor'gall still refused to help the Horde. Rexxar sensed the corruption within Kor'gall and slew the ogre chieftain in the Trial of Blood, earning Serathil and assuming control of the clan to lead them against the Alliance."}

This made his parents suggest to him that he may want to become a &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;, but he knew that &lt;a href=\"mining\"&gt;mining&lt;/a&gt; would have been his life's goal. This made him become one of the greatest miners of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Growing older, he built a family and had a daughter, &lt;a href=\"Rhona%20Irongrin\"&gt;Rhona&lt;/a&gt;.\nSecond War.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, Carrick lived in a village in &lt;a href=\"Northeron\"&gt;Northeron&lt;/a&gt;. During a &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw&lt;/a&gt; attack on top of &lt;a href=\"red%20dragon\"&gt;red dragon&lt;/a&gt;s, his village was raided and destroyed. Carrick watched from a hill afar but was not able to reach them in time. His daughter was one of the casualties and he wasn't unable to speak with stone from that day on. He would eventually force everyone away.\nThe Jade Hunters.\nFollowing his time in the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Highlands\"&gt;Twilight Highlands&lt;/a&gt;, he would spend his time in &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; next to the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Forge\"&gt;Great Forge&lt;/a&gt;. One the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;Council of Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt; members decided to place him on a team with &lt;a href=\"Fenella%20Darkvire\"&gt;Fenella Darkvire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fendrig%20Redbeard\"&gt;Fendrig Redbeard&lt;/a&gt;in order to help rebuild the &lt;a href=\"Jade%20Serpent\"&gt;Jade Serpent&lt;/a&gt; statue found in the &lt;a href=\"Jade%20Forest\"&gt;Jade Forest&lt;/a&gt;. Carrick accepted the task, if only because he felt his reputation was at stake. \nAfter arriving on &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; and aiding in the reconstruction, &lt;a href=\"Foreman%20Raiki\"&gt;Foreman Raiki&lt;/a&gt; would organize a &lt;a href=\"%3Ajade\"&gt;:jade&lt;/a&gt; hunt to make up for lack of jade present. During this the hunt, the three dwarves would be tricked by &lt;a href=\"Fei\"&gt;Fei&lt;/a&gt; into going into the same mine, a fact that pleased none of them. As the three ventured deeper into the cave Carrick decided to strike a &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; statue that blocked their way. However, after doing so he began to hallucinate and the statue's face morphed into a Dragonmaw orc. He furiously stroke it once again but the stone was too thick. Even though, he didn't stop, and before long memories of &lt;a href=\"Northeron\"&gt;Northeron&lt;/a&gt; came to mind.\nCarrick remembered the burning of his village and how he tried to reach his home. This time was different as his daughter Rhona approach him. The dwarf hugged her tight but in some corner of his mind, he knew that was not real. He had dreamed so many times about that moment, and she never approached him. This time though, it felt so real to him. The girl asked what he was trying to do and he told her he was trying to reach home in time. Rhona replied it was already too late while the father insisted it was different that time. She innocently laughed, stating it was the same. That made Carrick very angry replying her not to say that but she then backed away with tears in her eyes. Feeling guilty, Carrick apologized and asked her for forgiveness. She agreed only if he promised her something. Rhona hugged his father one last time and then Carrick stopped smelling the hill daisy pollen. Instead, the pungent odor of death and burning flesh enveloped him while his daughter said there was nothing left for him there. She then kissed him on the cheek and danced away. A feather she was holding was blown away and she chased it down the hill while laughing. Carrick tried to stop her but he was then brought back to reality.\nThe other dwarves asked what had happened as he was screaming and hitting the stone with his bare hands. Carrick thought of sending them away but realizing how he was now, sitting in the dusty floor, bloodied and without fire in his veins, he felt there was no hiding how pathetic and useless he had become. Carrick felt so exhausted that when he began talking he couldn't stop himself and explained his past. In the end, though, he managed to recover and talk with the stones, successfully opening the path.\nAfter briefly resting and with Fendrig opening the next path, the three dwarves found a cave full of gems and when Fenella ordered her pet &lt;a href=\"golem\"&gt;golem&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Koveth\"&gt;Koveth&lt;/a&gt;, to dig, it caused the ceiling to fall down. When running for the exit he and Fendrig would be forced to fight off spiders until Fenella rescued them and sacrificed Koveth to give them enough time to escape. While looking around the room they ran into, they found a great amount of jade and the &lt;a href=\"Scrolls%20of%20the%20Celestials\"&gt;Scrolls of the Celestials&lt;/a&gt;. Reading the scrolls gave the three dwarves insight which allowed them to realize they could still do great things, even after they believed that they couldn't.\nAs such when the three left the cave as friends, their prior animosity forgotten, and brought forth the jade they found to the foreman. Uncaring that the contest was already over, the three decided to thank &lt;a href=\"Fei\"&gt;Fei&lt;/a&gt; for getting them together, only to be shocked when she ran away. After chasing her to a hill Fei then turned into the &lt;a href=\"Jade%20Serpent\"&gt;Jade Serpent&lt;/a&gt; and flew into the sky, leaving the dwarves speechless."}

Nasty, three-pronged mandibles make up at least a third of that length. The mandibles and underside are grayish-blue and its hard carapace is bright red. These insects prefer to make their homes near rich sources of carrion, thriving especially near graveyards. They feed only on the flesh of the dead. Carrion beetles bury the body of a slain victim and leave it there for several days before burrowing back down to begin eating. Several more days may pass for a fully grown carrion beetle to consume a corpse completely, and nothing remains when it's done.\nA carrion beetle will occasionally lay its larvae within a buried corpse instead of consuming it. The larvae later hatch and eat their way out of the body and then consume whatever remains. They then eat each other until only the strongest carrion beetle remains. The winner burrows its way to the surface and begins its own endless quest for dead flesh. Carrion beetles attack in a simple, mindless assault whether alone or in a swarm.\nCarrion beetles often form a symbiotic relationship with the &lt;a href=\"stranglethorn\"&gt;stranglethorn&lt;/a&gt; plant, living in burrows at the vine's base. There they help break down the remains of the plant's victims and lay eggs which in the decomposing corpses. The beetles are considered food by other predators, and lure the creatures to the vine's reach."}

They are especially living in the &lt;a href=\"scourge\"&gt;scourge&lt;/a&gt;d zones of Loradaeron.\nThese worms are notable for rarely dropping &lt;a href=\"Larval%20Acid\"&gt;Larval Acid&lt;/a&gt;.\nNote that sometimes this model is used for the young of other creatures that are not carrion grubs.\nBiology.\nThe meat of a carrion grub is suitable for consuming. While rather bland in taste, it can easily be preserved to last for months.\nIn the RPG.\nCarrion grubs are disgusting &lt;a href=\"larva\"&gt;larva&lt;/a&gt; that roam the &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands\"&gt;Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt; searching for corpses to consume. They devour prey by gripping it in acid-coated mandibles, dissolving it, and sucking it up through their relatively tiny mouths. If they cannot find dead or dying creatures to feed upon, any living flesh will do. Carrion grubs prefer mammals, but will dine on reptiles or fish \u2014 they are voracious eaters that can consume close to half their body weight in a day. They cannot digest vegetable matter. Carrion grubs roam only, and have appeared the Plaguelands there only in recent years. It is unclear if they are the result of horrible experiments by overzealous necromancers, or simply a mutation created by the Scourge. Since they pursue undead flesh as readily as the living, it seems unlikely anyone created them on purpose. It is a fat, sickly, human-sized yellow worm that undulates its way along the ground, a trail of sizzling slime in its wake. Smallish pincer-like mandibles, dripping with green ichor, extend and retract from a tiny sucker-like mouth.\nCarrion grubs move about haphazardly, constantly seeking food. If they detect suitable prey with their blindsense, they move to investigate, attacking rapaciously if the prey proves edible. If the food source moves out of blindsense range, the grub continues moving in the same direction until it catches up, comes to an obstacle, or detects another food source. Although grubs are stupid, their blindsense is quite acute and they will not, for example, pursue prey over the edge of a cliff. If confronted by a foe that cannot be attacked, such as flying archers, the grub escapes by burrowing. A carrion grub can wriggle its way only into soft earth, sand, or materials of a similar consistency. Most carrion grubs are six to eight feet long and weigh three hundred to five hundred pounds, although much larger specimens exist. Carrion grubs attack the nearest source of food, although particularly juicy targets draw more attention. Thus, a grub goes after a human before a gnome and a tauren before a night elf. Particularly large or overweight individuals might also become preferred targets. If a large enough source of food is available (such as a corpse), a grub stops attacking while it dissolves and digests the offering. However, if attacked while feeding, it defends itself. If possible, a carrion grub charges and overruns a foe if the size difference between them is not too great. If the grub successfully overruns, the target is automatically subjected to an acidic slime attack. When slain, a carrion grub bursts apart, releasing a shower of acid similar to an acid spray."}

Soon enough they were split into various different groups, with the most powerful of these known as the cartels. However, as the battles raged on and it became clear no one was actually winning, the cartels realized it was in their mutual interests to broker a truce. Despite this, the conflict would never really end, as the goblins now turned to trade, doing battle in the economic arena. For years to come the cartels were rivals, constantly outshining and outsmarting each other as they continued in their quest for wealth and power.\nGoblin cartels often compete with other cartels, such as in the &lt;a href=\"Trade%20Wars\"&gt;Trade Wars&lt;/a&gt;.

When a mob was looted for money by any guild member, a percentage of that money was created and placed directly into the guild bank. The player did not lose any gold from looting mobs. Rank 1, available at guild level 5, generated 5% additional money. Rank 2, at guild level 16, generated 10%.\nThe perk essentially allowed guilds to generated gold simply by having active members, and while this likely contributed to some degree to guild generosity such as free repairs, it also fueled some \"degenerative player behavior\". &lt;a href=\"Ion%20Hazzikostas\"&gt;Ion Hazzikostas&lt;/a&gt; blamed the perk for the slew of guild invites received by many players upon creating an alt, due to guilds wanting to gain as much income from players as possible. The result was that players were bombarded with invites to guilds, in order to generate gold and levelling benefits for the guild which were for the most part not passed on to the players themselves. The perk was therefore removed along with guild advancement in &lt;a href=\"patch%206.0.2\"&gt;patch 6.0.2&lt;/a&gt;."}

However the system can also be used by some scam artists if close attention is not paid.\nThe C.O.D system allows the sender to specify an amount of &lt;a href=\"money\"&gt;money&lt;/a&gt; needed for the recipient to place the attached item into their inventory. \nTo send a C.O.D item, simply go to a &lt;a href=\"mailbox\"&gt;mailbox&lt;/a&gt;, and select the \"Send Mail\" tab. Next, drag or right-click the item to be sent from your inventory into the message. Lastly, and most importantly, \"don't forget to select the C.O.D option and to set a price before sending the message.\"\nKeep in mind that all items sent via mail will take one (1) hour to arrive at the recipient. This does not count for mail to characters on your own account; such mail will arrive instantly. This also counts for members of your &lt;a href=\"guild\"&gt;guild&lt;/a&gt;, due to the perk &lt;a href=\"Guild%20Mail\"&gt;Guild Mail&lt;/a&gt;.\nC.O.D. scams.\nAmong the features of World of Warcraft are the ability to sell items through the in game mail system using a Cash on Delivery (C.O.D) payment system, and the ability to &lt;a href=\"Wrapping%20Paper\"&gt;wrap gifts&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, there are those dishonest sorts out there who have figured out that these features, when used together, can be abused.\nWrapped C.O.D scam.\nSome players used send in-game mail C.O.D with a &lt;a href=\"Wrapping%20Paper\"&gt;gift-wrapped&lt;/a&gt; item, pretending to be from an &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt;. New players would sometimes confuse the C.O.D as a reward and end up paying a high price for the item. The body text of these mails varied, but the item was usually a trash gift, such as a drop or a low copper value item (examples included &lt;a href=\"Skinning%20Knife\"&gt;Skinning Knife&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Blacksmith%20Hammer\"&gt;Blacksmith Hammer&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard&lt;/a&gt; advised players not to open such mail, and to report suspected C.O.D. scams to a &lt;a href=\"Game%20Master\"&gt;Game Master&lt;/a&gt;.\nC.O.D expiration scams.\nSome dishonest players leverage the mail system's 3-day return mechanism in order to keep competition for high-price items off of the &lt;a href=\"Auction%20House\"&gt;Auction House&lt;/a&gt;, or to &lt;a href=\"grief\"&gt;grief&lt;/a&gt; other players. The player will ask for the victim to C.O.D the item to them and never accept it, leaving the item inaccessible to the victim for three days while they sell a like item on the Auction House. Unfortunately there is nothing that can be done to combat this."}

He relinquished whatever funds he left in the bank when he and his Sunreaver kind betrayed us.\nRewards.\nYou will receive: \nProgress.\nHe went to the &lt;a href=\"Bank%20of%20Dalaran\"&gt;Bank of Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, in the north.\nCompletion.\nI suppose it wasn't enough for him to be a coward and a backstabber... he had to be a greedy thief as well.\nHmph.
