It was created eons ago by the &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt; for the purpose of imprisoning most of Azeroth's &lt;a href=\"earth%20elemental\"&gt;earth elemental&lt;/a&gt;s, including &lt;a href=\"Therazane%20the%20Stonemother\"&gt;Therazane the Stonemother&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; recovered here after his defeat at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Battle of Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt; until his re-emergence into &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn \"World of Warcraft\", Deepholm is the largest visitable zone of the Elemental Plane. The storyline mainly revolves around aiding the &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt; forces stationed in the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Earth\"&gt;Temple of Earth&lt;/a&gt; in their efforts to mend the wound Deathwing opened. The two main enemy forces players fight against are the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; and a large tribe of &lt;a href=\"stone%20trogg\"&gt;stone trogg&lt;/a&gt;s. The zone holds a 5-man dungeon, the &lt;a href=\"Stonecore\"&gt;Stonecore&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nTo keep &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; safe from these threats, the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s imprisoned the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt; underground and banished the savage &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt;s to the titan-constructed &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Plane\"&gt;Elemental Plane&lt;/a&gt;, a secure dominion where the elementals could dwell without harming Azeroth. Four domains were created within this primordial realm to serve as ideal environments for each type of elemental. One of the Elemental Plane's domains, a rough domain known as the Deepholm, is home to the &lt;a href=\"Earth%20elemental\"&gt;Earth elemental&lt;/a&gt;s. With the elementals' departure, nature calmed, and the world settled into a peaceful harmony. A variety of stone and crystalline creatures live within Deepholm, including familiars such as &lt;a href=\"stone%20drake\"&gt;stone drake&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"shale%20spider\"&gt;shale spider&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Gyreworm\"&gt;Gyreworm&lt;/a&gt;s composed entirely of stone and minerals.\n&lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; had been to Deepholm several times, and the forces of Therazane knew him. He arrived once after being banished there by &lt;a href=\"Huln%20Highmountain\"&gt;Huln Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"%3AHammer%20of%20Khaz%27goroth\"&gt;:Hammer of Khaz'goroth&lt;/a&gt;. Deepholm was also the place where Deathwing was nursed back to health after the events of \"&lt;a href=\"Day%20of%20the%20Dragon\"&gt;Day of the Dragon&lt;/a&gt;\".\nCataclysm.\nWhen Deathwing regained his health, he ruptured out through the middle section of Deepholm above the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Earth\"&gt;Temple of Earth&lt;/a&gt;, which housed the &lt;a href=\"World%20Pillar\"&gt;World Pillar&lt;/a&gt;. Following Deathwing's &lt;a href=\"Shattering\"&gt;Shattering&lt;/a&gt; of the World Pillar in Deepholm and his destructive re-emergence into Azeroth, the Elemental Plane collided with the physical realm and resulted in drastic geographical upheaval, causing chaotic elementals to pour out into the world of Azeroth. After witnessing the devastation Deathwing and his followers caused her realm, Therazane treats all outsiders with open hostility.\nFor a while, the temple was the main base of operations for &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;, but after the rupture the &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt; took control of the temple in an attempt to stabilize the fractured &lt;a href=\"World%20Pillar\"&gt;World Pillar&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Gunship\"&gt;Gunship&lt;/a&gt;s of both &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; entered Deepholm, however the Horde gunship, \"&lt;a href=\"Storm%27s%20Fury%20Wreckage\"&gt;Storm's Fury&lt;/a&gt;\", has been shot down. In the middle of Deepholm lies the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Earth\"&gt;Temple of Earth&lt;/a&gt;, which also holds the Stonecore. Inside the temple is a stone called the World Pillar. It bore the weight of all elemental and magnetic forces in Deepholm. However, it was shattered when Deathwing broke through into Azeroth. The quest progression in Deepholm will mainly focus on locating the missing fragments of the World Pillar in order to restore it and prevent Azeroth from collapsing into Deepholm. After the heroes convinced Therazane that they will indeed leave Deepholm once the World Pillar has been repaired, a battle takes place between the Twilight Cultists and Therazane's earth elementals. Ultimately with the help of the elementals of the earth, the World Pillar was repaired.\nLegion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, many shaman of the &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt; noticed &lt;a href=\"Therazane\"&gt;Therazane&lt;/a&gt; was not present during negotiations with the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Lord\"&gt;Elemental Lord&lt;/a&gt;s, and rumors began spreading of a new threat in Deepholm. On a recent expedition to Deepholm, one of the Earthen Ring teams recorded strange seismic activity that they deemed not ordinary tremors. The &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; are also still present, led by &lt;a href=\"Burglosh%20the%20Earthbreaker\"&gt;Burglosh the Earthbreaker&lt;/a&gt; and being responsible for the death of the &lt;a href=\"Stone%20drake\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Zeryxia\"&gt;Zeryxia&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nEven several years after the Cataclysm, the elementals of Deepholm still hold ire toward the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; because of Deathwing destroying the &lt;a href=\"World%20Pillar\"&gt;World Pillar&lt;/a&gt;. At the time of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ma%27haat%20the%20Indomitable\"&gt;Ma'haat the Indomitable&lt;/a&gt; traveled from Deepholm to &lt;a href=\"Highmountain\"&gt;Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; in order to gather an essence of the black flight and keep it from the black dragon &lt;a href=\"Ebyssian\"&gt;Ebyssian&lt;/a&gt;.\nDragonflight.\nAfter the reawakening of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;, many earth elementals were called forth by the &lt;a href=\"Primalists\"&gt;Primalists&lt;/a&gt;, who summoned them as their reinforcements through elemental gateways linked to Deepholm.\nGeography.\nPortals.\nThe portals to Deepholm in the Eastern and Western Earthshrines of Stormwind and Orgrimmar unlock after players complete the first two quests leading through the &lt;a href=\"Maelstrom\"&gt;Maelstrom&lt;/a&gt; and land inside the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Earth\"&gt;Temple of Earth&lt;/a&gt;. Return portals also exist in the Temple as soon as players get there.\nQuests.\nAs mentioned, Deepholm's main storyline revolves around repairing the &lt;a href=\"World%20Pillar\"&gt;World Pillar&lt;/a&gt;, destroyed by Deathwing's destructive return to Azeroth. Other notable events will be proving your worth to &lt;a href=\"Therazane\"&gt;Therazane&lt;/a&gt; and her lieutenants, and to help a group of friendly &lt;a href=\"earthen\"&gt;earthen&lt;/a&gt; fight back against the vicious &lt;a href=\"stone%20trogg\"&gt;stone trogg&lt;/a&gt;s.\nIn the RPG.\nThe &lt;a href=\"continent\"&gt;continent&lt;/a&gt; of Deephome is the domain of &lt;a href=\"earth%20elemental\"&gt;earth elemental&lt;/a&gt;s and is one of the four domains of the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Plane\"&gt;Elemental Plane&lt;/a&gt;. The Elemental Plane is spherical and has a sole continent surrounded by water. The land itself is slightly larger than &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, while the seas are about the same width in all directions. The Elemental Plane is a three-tiered realm where the domain of Air sits atop the middle layer, which supports both the Water and Earth domains. Beneath these lies a third layer of Fire and molten rock.\nThe surface is rough, covered with fissures and craters, and it regularly quivers with earthquakes. When the realm of fire beneath breaks through, massive volcanoes form, until &lt;a href=\"Therazane\"&gt;Therazane&lt;/a&gt;'s earth elementals can put a halt to the incursion.\nDeepholm is lined with caves, tunnels, and endless passageways. Worms, burrowing animals, and other subterranean creatures abound. Gems and jewels of all kinds, including those not known to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, can be found within, though they are considered the property of Therazane herself. No mining efforts are permitted in her realm. Some sages believe that a few of the precious stones possess strong innate magical powers, but the truth of this speculation may never be verified.\nThe surface of this land is not pleasant to live on, but hardy plants and animals do eke out an existence here. Life for them is short and vicious, but &lt;a href=\"Therazane\"&gt;Therazane the Stonemother&lt;/a&gt; nurtures them when she can. Striking at those she considers her \"children\" is the quickest way to earn her enmity.\nIn a few rare places, the surface of Deepholm resembles a rocky, deserted section of Azeroth. Visitors to the Elemental Plane can find some measure of rest here, although the ground does shake and tremble with frightening regularity. Underground, travelers face not only quakes but also cave-ins, rockslides and other dangers.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

When you exit the Deeprun Tram instance, the Deeprun Rats disappear. \nThe Deeprun Rat Roundup only requires you to have five Deeprun Rats enthralled when you turn the quest in, but you can use the flute to enthrall far more; they will all follow you around. They all disappear when you turn the quest in, and you get nothing extra. \nThe Rat Catcher's Flute disappears when you turn the quest in, so the only time you can tame the Deeprun Rats is during the quest."}

And easy to complete whilst waiting for the tram you just missed.\nObjectives.\nCapture 5 s by using the &lt;a href=\"Rat%20Catcher%27s%20Flute\"&gt;Rat Catcher's Flute&lt;/a&gt;. Lead the rats back to Monty. Don't forget to turn in the flute when you're finished.\nItem Needed:\nDescription.\nAvast ye scallywag. Arrrr... Arrrr ye looking fer work? We gots a serious rat problem down here an' not enough hands on the poop deck.\nWhat do ye say? All ye needs to do is take this here rat catchin' flute and play the melody around the vermin. They'll follow ye to the ends of the world!\nJust capture five of the little buggers and bring em back here. We needs em alive.\nArrrrr... \nProgress.\nYarrr... Swabby, what be takin' ye so long?\nCompletion.\nThese'll werk nicely, matey. Me brother needs em still tickin' and kickin,' else they go sour... Ye don't want to taste no sour rat kabob.\nNotes.\nDeeprun rats can be found near the Ironforge Deeprun Tram Depot, and nowhere else. \nThe mechanics of a Deeprun Rat with the flute can be a bit tricky. Left click a Deeprun Rat to select it; if you right click, you will attack the Deeprun Rat and kill it instead. The Rat Catcher's Flute has limited range, you have to be close to the rat while you play the flute to charm it. Using the Rat Catcher's Flute to charm a Deeprun Rat takes a brief time, and the rat can travel out of range while you are playing the flute to cast the enthrallment, causing it to fail, so use the flute on a stopped Deeprun Rat or on a Deeprun Rat that is approaching you. If the Deeprun Rat is running away, you will probably fail to charm it. \nYou have to tame five Deeprun Rats, but you do not have to have five tamed when you turn the quest in. WoW tracks your number of rats tamed, to five, and should you tame a few, get a notion to play with the Rat Catcher's Flute elsewhere, and come back to complete the quest months later, you only have to catch the few more you are missing. You can tame more, and can have many Deeprun Rats following you, but you can only get credit for five, so you gain nothing extra for turning in more.\nThe Rat Catcher's Flute is non-functional elsewhere. The Rat Catcher's Flute must be carried in your inventory when you turn in the quest.\nWhen done the quest tracker will say that Monty is at Lordamere Internment Camp in Alterac Mountains. This isn't correct, Monty is still at the Deeprun Tram."}

The service is fast and smooth, and is provided free of charge to travelers between the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;-aligned cities of &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;. There is also a &lt;a href=\"quest\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt; here that starts on the Ironforge side and ends on the Stormwind side that involves catching &lt;a href=\"rat\"&gt;rat&lt;/a&gt;s.\nTo keep the tram running smoothly and safely, there are gnomes that work on it daily. As such, any problems with it can be quickly addressed. The underwater section of the tram is, in fact, a subterranean lake.\nHistory.\nIn the aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;kingdom of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; began the grueling task of rebuilding the war-torn lands surrounding their battered kingdom. In those days, the bonds of brotherhood that cradled the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; were still at their strongest, and the &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; were quick to lend aid to their human allies. &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;King Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; was frustrated, however, at the sluggish pace with which his country's aid was being delivered to Stormwind, and eager as well to establish a means of reinforcing the human kingdom with dwarven soldiers should the need arise. To address these two concerns, King Bronzebeard turned to Azeroth's most esteemed engineer, &lt;a href=\"High%20Tinker\"&gt;High Tinker&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Gelbin%20Mekkatorque\"&gt;Gelbin Mekkatorque&lt;/a&gt;, who immediately began drafting designs for a grand subterranean railway system that would link the cities of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;. His plans would eventually include making a scale mock-up out of pie tins, which still exists in &lt;a href=\"Sector%2017\"&gt;Sector 17&lt;/a&gt;, his quarters in &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt;.\nDespite problems with a subterranean lake and a &lt;a href=\"rat\"&gt;rat&lt;/a&gt; invasion, in the end, Mekkatorque's vision became reality, and the newly-built Deeprun Tram developed into an indispensable link between the two great capitals, providing swift and safe transportation for thousands of their citizens, and bolstering military cooperation between the armies of these two proud Alliance strongholds.\nShortly after the petrification of Magni, &lt;a href=\"Moira%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Moira Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt; invaded Ironforge and closed the tram, isolating the dwarves in the city. Some time later, &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; led an elite strike team of agents through the tram into Ironforge to liberate the city and rescue his son. After the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bizmo%27s%20Brawlpub\"&gt;Bizmo's Brawlpub&lt;/a&gt; was opened under the tram, in Stormwind's station.\nPost-Cataclysm.\nBefore entering the tram from Stormwind, a short ramp was added in &lt;a href=\"patch%204.0.3a\"&gt;patch 4.0.3a&lt;/a&gt;. When inside the actual Tram and looking back through the instance portal you just came through, you could see the old entrance without the newly-added ramp. This was fixed in a later patch.\nIn the RPG.\n&lt;a href=\"Gnomish%20inventor\"&gt;Gnomish inventor&lt;/a&gt;s organize into pairs, an odd crazy-guy/sane-guy relationship. One is always trying to push the limits of his devices to unknowable extremes while the other does everything he can to keep the invention from becoming disastrous. It was two pairings of just this type that created the underground railroad that connects &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt;."}

Set in the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20the%20Four%20Winds\"&gt;Valley of the Four Winds&lt;/a&gt;, the objective of the battleground is to be the first to generate 1600 resources. It was &lt;a href=\"Deepwind%20Gorge\"&gt;redesigned&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"patch%208.3.0\"&gt;patch 8.3.0&lt;/a&gt;.\nOfficial overview.\nDeepwind Gorge is the site of a combative gold rush battle between Horde and Alliance. Throughout the match, each team tries to capture and hold &lt;a href=\"mine\"&gt;mine&lt;/a&gt;s that provide gold when controlled. \nEach team stores their accumulated gold in mine carts located at their faction\u2019s base. These carts can be interfered with \u2013 and even brought back to your own base to \u2018steal\u2019 a portion of enemy gold.\nWhile defending the mines you\u2019ve captured, you\u2019ll also want to prevent your enemies from controlling mines. Whichever team controls more mines is going to accumulate gold faster, so keep an eye on your resources. When one team reaches 1600 gold, the match is over, and that team wins.\nCarts.\nCarts appear at each faction\u2019s base, and there they stay\u2026until they\u2019re grabbed. If you can steal an enemy cart from their base, you\u2019ll remove as much as 200 gold from their stores. If you can then drag that cart back to your faction\u2019s base, you\u2019ll earn 200 gold for your team. Beware: if your enemies slay you before you bring their cart to your base, they can recapture it \u2013 and earn back the gold you stole. \nSeriously, beware: they\u2019ll be trying to steal your carts as well. A successful cart theft can truly change the direction of the game. Simply click on any cart that\u2019s not currently being held to interact with it\nMines.\nThe three mines of Deepwind Gorge are located at fixed points in the Battleground: centrally, north (the \u2018pandaren\u2019 mine) and south (the \u2018goblin\u2019 mine). You can see the locations of these mines on your map. \nTo control a mine, you need to right-click on it and \u2018channel\u2019 \u2013 spend a short period of time uninterrupted, without moving. If you\u2019re interrupted (for example, by an attack) you won\u2019t capture the mine and you\u2019ll need to try again. You lose control of a mine when the enemy team captures it \u2013 hence, killing enemy players and establishing numerical superiority around a mine is important. \nMines provide your team with accumulating amounts of gold over time, not instantly \u2013 so the length of time you hold a mine, not simply that you held it, is important. When either team attempts to control any mine, you\u2019ll see a message that indicates which mine is under attack.\nGraveyards.\nEach team has staked out a northern and southern graveyard near their home base \u2013 when you\u2019re slain, you\u2019ll return at one of your faction\u2019s graveyards. Dying on the northern half of the map results in re-spawning at your faction\u2019s southern graveyard (and vice versa).\nDescription.\n\"In the new Battleground situated in the Valley of the Four Winds, the Alliance and Horde continue their war for Pandaria's precious resources. While the two factions battle for control over mines, they must also protect their own resources from being stolen and turned against them!\"\nGameplay.\nBuffs.\nDeepwind Gorge features the Berserking and Restoration buffs.\nBerserking.\nIncreases all damage caused by 30% and all damage taken by 10%. Also increases the player's size, and grants a flaming visual effect to the player's hands. Duration 1 minute. This power-up resembles a screaming skull.\nRestoration.\nRestores health and mana. Duration 10 seconds. Taking sufficient damage will cancel the effect. This power-up resembles a large green leaf, and adds a nature healing spell visual effect to the player."}

This rickety contraption is used to collect and store recently slain corpses from the field of battle. At any time, corpses can be pulled from the Meat Wagon and raised into undead warriors. The Meat Wagon can also 'fling' diseased corpses at enemy units by use of a crude catapult device. An invaluable support vehicle for the Scourge, the Meat Wagon strikes fear and woe into the hearts of even the most resolute defenders.\nInformation.\nThe Meat Wagon functions similarly to the Night Elven &lt;a href=\"Glaive%20Thrower%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Glaive Thrower&lt;/a&gt; and Orcish &lt;a href=\"Demolisher%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Demolisher&lt;/a&gt;s as long-range mechanical siege units, and as such are effective against heavily fortified enemies where a simple head-on attack would be unfeasible. However, despite this use, they're fairly uncommon due to their lack of versatility compared to other siege units (Demolishers have Burning Oil for DoT, Mortar Teams can be affected by spells and Glaive Throwers can multihit), along with the fact that they only help Necromancer-heavy setups.\nUnlike its other counterparts, the Meat Wagon is also designed to hold corpses - up to eight at any given time. The Meat Wagon preserves the corpses held inside them, so they will never decay. This makes it particularly useful for &lt;a href=\"Death%20Knight%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Death Knight&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Necromancer%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt;s. While it is unlikely that there will be many high-level creeps on any given map, the Meat Wagon may hold onto them for the Death Knight to reanimate, temporarily giving players powerful assistants for their side. Necromancers also enjoy the benefit of the Meat Wagon by quickly summoning &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20Warrior%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Skeletal warrior&lt;/a&gt;s and/or &lt;a href=\"Skeletal%20Mage%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;mages&lt;/a&gt; as soon as they enter the battlefield for additional assistance. However, their long attack range means the summoned skeletons must be directed to attack enemies as they will be too far to acquire targets. This can be remedied by bringing the Meat Wagons closer to the Necromancers.\nThe Meat Wagon doesn't automatically pick up corpses unless set on automatic - they collect the nearest corpses. If Exhumed Corpses has been researched, then the Meat Wagon automatically supplies itself with corpses like the &lt;a href=\"Graveyard%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Graveyards&lt;/a&gt;, making the process of collecting corpses unnecessary. Meat Wagons can also benefit from the Disease Cloud research as their attacks become capable of spreading disease onto enemies.\nIf destroyed with corpses inside, all of the corpses will spill out of the Meat Wagon."}

Meathook has grown stronger, more toxic and more agile than the others. Smarter was never the goal of the &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt;s who created Meathook, but it only takes a base cunning to do what he does best.\"\nStrategies.\nOn both Normal and Heroic, the boss is a simple Tank and Spank. The zombies that surround it may trouble the healer, but should be easily tanked. Healing consumables for the DPS or use of a backup healer may be necessary in case the healer cannot keep up with the damage output of the boss, although this is far from certain. The DPS and tank must be aware of the possibility that the healer will be hit by constricting chains, and thusly unable to heal. The encounter may be simplified by tanking the boss against the wall, with the healer out of line of sight, and thus unable to be hit by the chains.\nRogue anesthetic poison will not remove Meathook's Frenzy.\nConstricting Chains.\nIt has been confirmed that the Constricting Chains on &lt;a href=\"Heroic%20Mode\"&gt;Heroic Mode&lt;/a&gt; will hit the party member with the least amount of aggro on the boss. If your healer is light on threat then they will always be hit and thus makes the fight extremely difficult. &lt;a href=\"Hunters\"&gt;Hunters&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rogues\"&gt;Rogues&lt;/a&gt; can misdirect threat onto the healer when it is safe and will not cause them to pass the tank, or various &lt;a href=\"DPS\"&gt;DPS&lt;/a&gt; can use a &lt;a href=\"cooldown\"&gt;cooldown&lt;/a&gt; to wipe aggro and take the bottom to soak the chains.\nConstricting Chains seems to be linked to both threat and distance. Threat alone does not seem to dictate who he will chain."}

Creations of the &lt;a href=\"titanic%20watcher\"&gt;titanic watcher&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mimiron\"&gt;Mimiron&lt;/a&gt;, they are the ancestors of the &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt; race, having been transformed into them after falling victim to the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Flesh\"&gt;Curse of Flesh&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nOrigin.\nThe mechagnomes were created by &lt;a href=\"Mimiron\"&gt;Mimiron&lt;/a&gt; (also referred to as \"The Grand Architect\") within &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt;, apparently as servants and caretakers much like the &lt;a href=\"earthen\"&gt;earthen&lt;/a&gt;. When their creator was struck down by the corrupted &lt;a href=\"Keeper\"&gt;Keeper&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Loken\"&gt;Loken&lt;/a&gt;, the mechagnomes scrambled to save his fading soul by transplanting it upon a giant mechagnome body, though they could do nothing to help his deteriorated mental state. Alongside the earthen, a number of mechagnomes left Ulduar and became caretakers of the facility of &lt;a href=\"Uldaman\"&gt;Uldaman&lt;/a&gt;.\nLike the rest of the &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt;, the mechagnomes were struck with &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Flesh\"&gt;Curse of Flesh&lt;/a&gt;, though the ones at Northrend appear to have been unaffected. The mechagnomes of Uldaman, however, suffered the full brunt of the Curse 3,000 years in the past, where they degenerated into fleshy beings which would later become simply known as &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;s. Physically and mentally debilitated, these creatures lost all sense of purpose, abandoning the halls of Uldaman and fleeing into the surrounding caverns and mountain peaks. Only a handful of mechagnomes remained in the facility, still driven by their titan-forged imperative.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"Borean%20Tundra\"&gt;Borean Tundra&lt;/a&gt;, while a crew of the &lt;a href=\"Fizzcrank%20Airstrip\"&gt;Fizzcrank Airstrip&lt;/a&gt; was siphoning oil off the &lt;a href=\"Fizzcrank%20Pumping%20Station\"&gt;Fizzcrank Pumping Station&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Geyser%20Fields\"&gt;Geyser Fields&lt;/a&gt;, they found a bunch of strange mechanical parts stuck in their pipelines. Since no &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt; can turn down a puzzle, they figured out that all those parts belonged together, and they rebuilt them into a robot that looked like a giant gnome. It turned on, called itself &lt;a href=\"Gearmaster%20Mechazod\"&gt;Gearmaster Mechazod&lt;/a&gt;, and claimed to have been built by the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s. He informed all the gnomes that they were flawed beings, mechagnomes who had been tainted by the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Flesh\"&gt;Curse of Flesh&lt;/a&gt;, and then kidnaped any gnomes he could find in order to convert them into cyborg monstrosities, which took control of the station. Because of his deranged crusade against organic life, both &lt;a href=\"Greatmother%20Taiga\"&gt;Greatmother Taiga&lt;/a&gt; of the Horde and &lt;a href=\"Fizzcrank%20Fullthrottle\"&gt;Fizzcrank Fullthrottle&lt;/a&gt; of the Alliance have placed a bounty on his head. Fizzcrank lost several people to being turned into angry little robots before Mechazod got stopped by &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAs Keeper &lt;a href=\"Loken\"&gt;Loken&lt;/a&gt; fell completely to the whim of &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt;, the mechagnomes of the &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Peaks\"&gt;Storm Peaks&lt;/a&gt; became his servants and allies of the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt;, and were predominantly found around the &lt;a href=\"Inventor%27s%20Library\"&gt;Inventor's Library&lt;/a&gt;. Within &lt;a href=\"Ulduar%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt;, a number of mechagnomes guarded the outer defenses of the facility, protecting the path to the &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Leviathan\"&gt;Flame Leviathan&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith the death of Loken, the cleansing of Mimiron's mind, and the defeat of Yogg-Saron, the mechagnomes were freed from the influence of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s and once again serve as loyal servants of the titanic watchers. However, despite the defeat of both &lt;a href=\"Loken\"&gt;Loken&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt;, there were still many iron troops throughout Northrend. Consequently, both &lt;a href=\"Thorim\"&gt;Thorim&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mimiron\"&gt;Mimiron&lt;/a&gt; were looking for a way to \"fix\" them.\nLegion.\nBy the time of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, the mechagnomes have been once more integrated into Ulduar's defensive systems, serving the &lt;a href=\"Keeper\"&gt;Keeper&lt;/a&gt;s alongside the &lt;a href=\"iron%20vrykul\"&gt;iron vrykul&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"frost%20giant\"&gt;frost giant&lt;/a&gt;s, the &lt;a href=\"earthen\"&gt;earthen&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Dwarf\"&gt;iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt;. When &lt;a href=\"Odyn\"&gt;Odyn&lt;/a&gt; attempted to unify the titan-forged, they were defending Ulduar against the demons.\nAppearance.\nMechagnome bodies consist of metallic plates and screws, marked by runic tracks of light. Some of them have mustaches and similar hair-fragments on their heads, also made out of metal. They are all masculine in terms of features, implying female mechagnomes are either non-existent or simply unseen. Being machines, they are likely genderless anyway.\nThe sounds they make resemble the voices of normal gnomes, just in a \"metallic\" fashion. Mechagnomes come in various sizes but are usually at the size of a normal gnome. They have three fingers on each hand.\nTraits.\nMechagnomes are &lt;a href=\"immortal\"&gt;immortal&lt;/a&gt;. This does not mean they are invulnerable, just that they can't die from aging. They can, however, malfunction. When they do, they require someone else to repair them. Additionally, mechagnomes can be taken apart without being permanently damaged (as long as they are put back together properly).\nMatching their appearance, mechagnomes act very robot-like; their behavior is marked by a pragmatic, objective, and sometimes commanding way of thinking, and they seem to have a habit of meticulously analyzing their surroundings.\" While this trait often may seem odd to the mortal races, it often makes it very easy to understand mechagnomes and pick up the information they give. When performing an action or a choice, mechagnomes often utter their reasoning out loud. From what they are saying, the minds of mechagnomes are clearly much similar to a computer program, processing variables and executing commands.\nApparently, they have a connection to what could be \"titan databanks\" - they can sometimes be observed \"accessing\" these databanks in order to retrieve the information they need. This can be done either directly through the &lt;a href=\"Databank\"&gt;Databank&lt;/a&gt;s or through nothing at all, as seen when &lt;a href=\"Attendant%20Tock\"&gt;Attendant Tock&lt;/a&gt; attempts to contact them when &lt;a href=\"The%20Armor%27s%20Secrets%23Notes\"&gt;analyzing a piece of strange metal&lt;/a&gt;.\nMechagnomes possess the convenient ability of going into standby-mode. They often do this after completing or being released from a task. Most likely they will stand in standby-mode until their master gives them a new order, as they have little reason to do anything else. It is unknown how long a mechagnome can remain in this state.\nThey have also been seen riding &lt;a href=\"mechanostrider\"&gt;mechanostrider&lt;/a&gt;s. The only ones doing this reside at the &lt;a href=\"Inventor%27s%20Library\"&gt;Inventor's Library&lt;/a&gt;, but they seem to have quite a bit of them. The model they use seems to be &lt;a href=\"White%20Mechanostrider%20Mod%20B\"&gt;White Mechanostrider Mod B&lt;/a&gt;. They adopted these inventions from the gnomes, for their own mysterious purposes. Other mounts used by mechagnomes are &lt;a href=\"Flying%20machine\"&gt;flying machines&lt;/a&gt;.\nAmazingly, normal (fleshy) gnomes today still possess the robotic heritage of their ancestors. Normal gnomes can be reverted back into being mechagnomes, despite those gnomes having been flesh for generations. This is not done by merely adding a supplementary spell on normal gnomes in order to transform them, but oppositely by injecting them with something that \"removes\" the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Flesh\"&gt;Curse of Flesh&lt;/a&gt;. Likewise, gnomes who have been turned into mechagnomes may be reverted back to their original fleshy form by injecting them with something that 'reverses the reversion' of the curse. The player has to revert several newly \"mechanized\" gnomes back to their former self in the quest &lt;a href=\"Re-Cursive\"&gt;Re-Cursive&lt;/a&gt;. After being mechagnomes, most of these gnomes were apparently not fond of having been so. Then again, some of the gnomes felt that being mechanized had \"perfected\" them.\nEngineering.\nEngineers can craft a number of different mechagnomes to perform various services for a limited time.\nBlingtrons.\n&lt;a href=\"Blingtron\"&gt;Blingtron&lt;/a&gt;s are a series of diamond-encrusted mechagnome-like robots invented by &lt;a href=\"Gnopetto%20Bizzfuse\"&gt;Gnopetto Bizzfuse&lt;/a&gt;, known for their tendency to give out gifts to nearby adventurers."}

The history of these forgotten people was buried beneath the land. Evidence of two different civilizations appear, with one having been &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; in origin and the other appears to have been &lt;a href=\"tortollan\"&gt;tortollan&lt;/a&gt;s. A very old &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elven&lt;/a&gt; ring was also found, creating more questions about who lived here. It seems &lt;a href=\"pirate\"&gt;pirate&lt;/a&gt;s were also active around the area. \nFoundation of Mechagon.\nKing Mechagon was once the king of the &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan%20%28nation%29\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;s, who 400 years ago led his followers in search of a mystical land of technology. He left no clues where he was headed and over time his tale became a legend to the gnomes. In truth, King Mechagon managed to find this land and claimed it as his own. Since then, Mechagon Island has become the lost home of the &lt;a href=\"Mechagon%20mechagnome\"&gt;mechagnome&lt;/a&gt;s. Under the guidance of &lt;a href=\"Walton%20Cogfrenzy\"&gt;Walton Cogfrenzy&lt;/a&gt;, the gnomes erected the mighty underground marvel of &lt;a href=\"Mechagon%20City\"&gt;Mechagon City&lt;/a&gt;. Under King Mechagon, the gnomes began to convert themselves into partially mechanical versions of themselves; thus removing the problems of age upon their society.\nRediscovery.\nCenturies later, King Mechagon decided that the time had come to remove the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Flesh\"&gt;Curse of Flesh&lt;/a&gt; from all &lt;a href=\"Titan-forged\"&gt;titan creations&lt;/a&gt;. He was busy creating the &lt;a href=\"Mechoriginator\"&gt;Mechoriginator&lt;/a&gt;, a machine he'd been perfecting in order to achieve his goal. Not wanting to see his father's plan come to fruition, &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Erazmin\"&gt;Prince Erazmin&lt;/a&gt; began to secretly plan a revolt against him. His plans were unfortunately discovered when the elderly gnome adventurer, &lt;a href=\"Kervo%20Cogpipe\"&gt;Kervo Cogpipe&lt;/a&gt;, single-handedly found his way to the legendary lost island and told the king of his betrayal. With no other choice, Prince Erazmin fled to &lt;a href=\"Rustbolt\"&gt;Rustbolt&lt;/a&gt; with all those who supported him, leading to a civil war between the &lt;a href=\"Rustbolt%20Resistance\"&gt;Rustbolt Resistance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Arcforged\"&gt;Arcforged&lt;/a&gt; loyalists.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nIgnorant of this conflict, forces of the Alliance and Horde had heard of a vault being discovered at the &lt;a href=\"Abandoned%20Junkheap\"&gt;Abandoned Junkheap&lt;/a&gt;. An expedition under &lt;a href=\"Tinkmaster%20Overspark\"&gt;Tinkmaster Overspark&lt;/a&gt; were the first to arrive and were able to open the vault. Inside, they managed to activate a message by &lt;a href=\"King%20Mechagon\"&gt;King Mechagon&lt;/a&gt;, which unfortunately was followed by the activation of a scanning device that killed all those who were not gnomes. It only stopped when &lt;a href=\"Gila%20Crosswires\"&gt;Gila Crosswires&lt;/a&gt; was scanned.\nAs the Alliance forces left the vault, a group led by &lt;a href=\"Gazlowe\"&gt;Gazlowe&lt;/a&gt; had learned of the vault as well and had just arrived as they were leaving. With Overspark's departure, the Horde invaded the vault and killed all except for one gnome. Just as the Alliance did, the Horde activated the message and suffered the same fate until Gazlowe got the idea of using the captured gnome to stop the sequence.\nArriving on the island, Overspark and Gazlowe were greeted by Prince Erazmin who explained the situation. Both sides agreed that despite being at &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;war&lt;/a&gt;, they would help the rebellion. With everything settled, Erazmin gave a tour of the island. He explained that Rustbolt was recently ransacked and he will need help to launch an assault to rescue his supporters. With help from both sides, the prince attacked &lt;a href=\"Junkwatt%20Depot\"&gt;Junkwatt Depot&lt;/a&gt; to free his captured allies and also regain &lt;a href=\"Pascal-K1N6\"&gt;Pascal-K1N6&lt;/a&gt;.\nBefore leaving, the prince decided to deliver a message to his father by damaging the &lt;a href=\"HK-8%20Aerial%20Oppression%20Unit\"&gt;HK-8 Aerial Oppression Unit&lt;/a&gt;. Arriving back at Rustbolt, he informed both forces that there was much to be done before advancing onto the next phase. When preparations were complete, the allied forces launched , leading to the tyrant King Mechagon's end.\nAlternate universe.\nIn an alternate universe, just as everything seemed to go well for the rebellion, &lt;a href=\"Bondo%20Bigblock\"&gt;Bondo Bigblock&lt;/a&gt; sold them out. In exchange for full mechanization, Bondo built giant bots and attacked Rustbolt. Soon after the successful invasion, a hologram of King Mechagon appeared in the middle of the base and declared victory. Following his triumph, he activated the &lt;a href=\"Mechoriginator\"&gt;Mechoriginator&lt;/a&gt; and destroyed all life on Azeroth. In the aftermath, Christy Punchcog and Izira Gearsworn were some of the few who survived. Izira's legs were destroyed, so Christy with the help of an adventurer was able to create a new set of legs for her.\nAfter getting back on her feet, Izira decided to go after &lt;a href=\"Bondo%20Bigblock\"&gt;Bondo Bigblock&lt;/a&gt; as revenge and killed him. On her journey, she found her old prince Erazmin, transforming into nothing more than a &lt;a href=\"The%20Rusty%20Prince\"&gt;rusty bot&lt;/a&gt;. Putting him to rest gave Izira an idea. Inside a &lt;a href=\"Armored%20Vaultbot\"&gt;Armored Vaultbot&lt;/a&gt; nearby, there was a &lt;a href=\"Visual%20Holo%20Sphere\"&gt;Visual Holo Sphere&lt;/a&gt;, which held secrets to defeat King Mechagon.

They span a variety of different types. The higher-caste gnomes live in an advanced society inside a huge vault, where they previously dedicated themselves to their ruler &lt;a href=\"King%20Mechagon\"&gt;King Mechagon&lt;/a&gt;. Under King Mechagon's society, the more robot parts one has, the higher one's social standing is.\nHaving lived for centuries in relative peace, a group of mechagnomes rejected King Mechagon's vision of a mechanical world as his ambitions turned from invention and advancement to mechanizing the entire planet. Known as the &lt;a href=\"Rustbolt%20Resistance\"&gt;Rustbolt Resistance&lt;/a&gt;, this group was led by Mechagon's own son, Erazmin. Setting up in the outside &lt;a href=\"Junker%20Wastes\"&gt;Junker Wastes&lt;/a&gt;, they were beset by death robots and other mechagnomes who sought to end the resistance one way or another. The Rustbolt had fewer mechanical parts and tended to be partially deteriorating. As the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; arrived on Mechagon, they befriended the group in an effort to break into the mechagnomes' city and stop King Mechagon.\nFollowing , the mechagnomes re-joined &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan%20%28nation%29\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt; under High Tinker &lt;a href=\"Gelbin%20Mekkatorque\"&gt;Gelbin Mekkatorque&lt;/a&gt; and joined the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. Following the ascension of Gelbin Mekkatorque as King of Gnomes with &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Erazmin\"&gt;Prince Erazmin&lt;/a&gt; as his advisor, the goal of the Mechagnomes shifted from mechanization and removal of flesh to finding harmony between flesh and metal. \nCulture.\n&lt;a href=\"King%20Mechagon\"&gt;King Mechagon&lt;/a&gt; saw the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Flesh\"&gt;Curse of Flesh&lt;/a&gt; as a condemnation to obsolescence for &lt;a href=\"Gnome\"&gt;gnomanity&lt;/a&gt;. His people originally mechanized themselves to escape the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s' corruption and restore the &lt;a href=\"Mechagnome\"&gt;perfection&lt;/a&gt; of their original &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt; design. Mechanization is accomplished through surgical removal of a body part and replacement with a desired mechanical equivalent. Within Mechagon, this process has been streamlined so that it can largely be automated with machines and completed within a short period of time. At least when it comes to arms or legs, no form of sedation or anesthesia is bothered with presumably because such replacement pretty much takes no time at all. However, that doesn't mean that the patient doesn't experience any pain - far from it, in fact.\nSome mechagnomes seem to have a &lt;a href=\"mechanocat\"&gt;mechanocat&lt;/a&gt; racing and customizing subculture inspired by the American , complete with sweet pompadours.\nBased on the dialogue between Mechagnomes, their speech patterns are less casual than other races. They often speak imperatively, akin to stereotypes concerning robots in fiction. Their society has an extreme emphasis on upgrading and innovating, similar to regular gnomes.\nAppearance.\nMechagnomes were originally physically similar to their &lt;a href=\"Gnome\"&gt;gnomish&lt;/a&gt; brethren, but they heavily mechanized themselves over time. It is now usual for them to have replaced all their limbs and most of their sensory organs with upgraded robotic replacements.\nDue to these replacements, mechagnomes are virtually immortal, or at least ageless. &lt;a href=\"Lynnish%20Hardmode\"&gt;Lynnish Hardmode&lt;/a&gt; considered herself \"80 years young\"."}

The elves are also aided by a large number of demons serving the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, Kael'thas' new ally.

There may be items that help remove this effect (if this happens as part of a Polymorph, see &lt;a href=\"%23Polymorph\"&gt;Polymorph&lt;/a&gt; for more), and these would of course be usable in this situation.\nDamage Reduction.\nThe damage dealt by every melee attack you make is reduced. There is to my knowledge no way to remove this mechanic specifically, although the debuff that causes it is usually either a &lt;a href=\"Dispel%20Type%23Curse\"&gt;Curse&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"Dispel%20Type%23Magic\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt;-type debuff, which can be removed in the usual way.\nDaze.\nYou move slowly. This is a lot like the Snare mechanic, although it has the added effect of knocking you off your mount, if you're on one to begin with. These effects are usually very short-duration. A Blizzard post to the official forums indicated that it is intentionally impossible to remove a Daze other than by waiting it out. There was once a bug (appeared in patch 1.6; fixed in patch 1.7) that allowed &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt;s' &lt;a href=\"Paladin%23Blessings\"&gt;Blessing of Freedom&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Druid\"&gt;Druid&lt;/a&gt;s' &lt;a href=\"Druid%23Forms\"&gt;Shapeshifting&lt;/a&gt; to remove Daze, but this was a mistake.\nFear.\nYou run uncontrollably away, out to a certain radius, then mill about randomly, also uncontrollably. PvP trinkets for many classes remove this effect, as does Will of the Forsaken.\nIncapacitate.\nYou cannot move and cannot use abilities, however the effect is broken when you take damage.\nThere is some debate over whether the &lt;a href=\"expansion\"&gt;expansion&lt;/a&gt; cat &lt;a href=\"Druid\"&gt;Druid&lt;/a&gt; ability &lt;a href=\"Maim\"&gt;Maim&lt;/a&gt; is an incapacitate debuff. It does break when the afflicted takes damage, but not when they take damage from periodic damage (such as damage from &lt;a href=\"rake\"&gt;rake&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"rip\"&gt;rip&lt;/a&gt;). Currently, incapacitates do break when hit by damage from &lt;a href=\"DoT\"&gt;DoT&lt;/a&gt;s.\nPeriodic Damage.\nYou continue to take damage every few seconds for the duration of the effect. The amount of damage depends on the effect, as does how often the damage occurs. There are items (such as the mighty &lt;a href=\"Luffa\"&gt;Luffa&lt;/a&gt;) that remove &lt;a href=\"School%23Physical\"&gt;physical&lt;/a&gt; Periodic Damage mechanics, which are known as Bleed effects.\nPolymorph.\nThis is basically a combination of a &lt;a href=\"%23Confuse\"&gt;Confuse&lt;/a&gt; effect and a &lt;a href=\"%23Transform\"&gt;Transform&lt;/a&gt; effect. The reason why it's a separate mechanic from those other two is that there are items (for example, the PvP trinkets) and class abilities (such as the &lt;a href=\"Druid\"&gt;Druid&lt;/a&gt; ability to shapeshift) that remove both components of a Polymorph effect.\nPossession.\nYou are under the control of a mob or another player.\nRoot.\nYou are frozen in place, attached to the ground. The &lt;a href=\"Gnome\"&gt;Gnome&lt;/a&gt; racial ability &lt;a href=\"Racial%20Traits%23Gnome\"&gt;Escape Artist&lt;/a&gt; can remove most Root effects.\nSilence.\nYou are unable to cast spells. This may be from a Magic-type debuff, in which case a Priest or Paladin ally could remove it from you, although you couldn't do so yourself.\nSleep.\nYou are asleep. Your character stands still, head bowed, with \"Zzz\" above his/her head. Very similar to Incapacitate; you cannot move or take any actions, but the effect will break if taken damage.\nSnare.\nYou move more slowly than normal. Escape Artist can remove some Snare effects.\nSpeed.\nYou move more quickly than normal. Debuffs can remove some Speed effects.\nStun.\nYou are unable to move, cast spells, or use items, with the exception of those which allow you to break free of stun effects, of course. Some of the PvP trinkets will remove this.\nTransform.\nYou look like something else. When imposed upon you by another, this is usually combined with a Confuse mechanic, but not necessarily -- several items and effects in the game will transform you, but the only confusion they cause is in the minds of onlookers.\nHorror.\nExample: &lt;a href=\"Death_Coil_%28warlock_ability%29\"&gt;Warlocks|Death Coil&lt;/a&gt;\nCauses you to run in horror for short time. So far, Warlocks Death Coil is only ability that can inflict Horror-type debuff. Horror is very similar to &lt;a href=\"Fear\"&gt;Fear&lt;/a&gt;, but counter-fear items nor abilities cant break Death Coil."}

{"id": "65123", "revid": "41171629", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=65123", "title": "Mechano-Lord Capacitus", "text": "Mechano-Lord Capacitus is an optional &lt;a href=\"arcane%20titan\"&gt;arcane titan&lt;/a&gt; boss in the &lt;a href=\"Mechanar\"&gt;Mechanar&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Tempest%20Keep\"&gt;Tempest Keep&lt;/a&gt;. He is likely involved in the process of creating the &lt;a href=\"manacell\"&gt;manacell&lt;/a&gt;s in the Mechanar.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"It takes a tremendous amount of skill and precision to harvest the power of the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt;'s manacells. These talents can easily be turned upon any intruders.\"\nStrategies.\nKeep Capacitus far away from the group - this is primarily a ranged DPS fight. This is especially true for rogues as your healer needs to focus on healing the Main Tank and the bombs that spawn will deal high damage. If possible, save your healer headaches and mana by using your ranged weapon. However, this is not always possible in Heroic mode if your group is heavy on melee DPS, as the fight is timed.\nYour tank should be prepared to move Capacitus from side to side to avoid the bombs. Ranged should be wary of bombs approaching them.\nThe bombs themselves spawn and then move around slightly before pulsing two or three times then exploding. They are easy enough to spot and easy to avoid if everyone keeps their distance. When the boss dies, the bombs do not despawn, but will all explode!\nStrategy 1: Using the stairs for positioning.\nUse the stairs to decrease the number of bombs that hit ranged party members. This strategy still requires vigilance on all players' parts\u2014the reflective shields the boss places will still wipe the group if ignored.\nStrategy 2: Kiting.\nAnother strategy is to use the stairs on the right side of the instance to kite Capacitus. You should engage him when he is at his furthest point away from the stairs.\nStrategy 3: Using melee DPS.\nIt is possible for melee to DPS to be useful in this fight, and while an offhealer helps, it can be done by the main healer. The tank should hold Capacitus on the glass floor that he patrols. If the tank stays in the small indent near the front-center of the glass floor and keeps Capacitus in the middle of the room, two things happen:\nAt this point, only two things need to happen for successful melee DPS: they need to stop attacking when he glows red (the tank should too\u2014do your healer a favor!), and they need to keep one eye on any bombs and move out of the way if necessary. Melee should also run up off the glass and bandage so the healer can focus on the tank.\nHeroic.\nIn heroic mode, Capacitus hits harder, but releases fewer bombs (although they hit for higher damage). He neither changes colors nor reflects damage/magic. Instead, Capacitus has an ability called Polarity Shift, which is similar to the &lt;a href=\"Thaddius\"&gt;Thaddius&lt;/a&gt; fight in &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt;. After three minutes, Capacitus becomes enraged and it will be nearly impossible to kill him.\nPolarity Shift.\nApproximately 30 seconds into the encounter and every 30 seconds thereafter, Capacitus casts Polarity Shift on all members of the party. Each person gets either a positive or negative charge, which is visible to yourself and others as a debuff icon.\nThe charges themselves do nothing if you are standing alone. If two people with opposite polarity stand close together, this causes damage to both members at 2,000 damage per tick and can easily cause a wipe. However when two people with the same polarity stand close together, the charge becomes beneficial and increases both members' damage output by 100% each.\nWhen you are correctly positioned with like-charged party members, the polarity icon is multiplied to indicate the increase in damage output.\nStrategy.\nDetermine before the encounter starts, where ranged/casters should stand once Polarity Shift is in effect (for example, positives on the right and negatives on the left). Polarity Shift is a cast, so make sure that each pending shift is called out to the party. Everyone should take a moment to check their new polarity and move immediately to the predetermined location, switching back and forth as necessary.\nBecause the tank cannot move, rogues may need to move away if they are oppositely charged from the tank. As long as members are grouped correctly, damage output is increased so substantially that even feral-specced (but non-tanking) druids can shift out and cast damage spells (thus allowing them to stand away from the tank).\nPriests: If you use your &lt;a href=\"Shadowfiend\"&gt;Shadowfiend&lt;/a&gt; while your polarity is stacked, you will do more damage and return more mana.\nThis fight goes VERY quickly if you properly stack charges, and can easily be finished even if a party member goes down early.\nNotes.\n\"Enslaved Drill Master\": A warlock can enslave a drill master when you're one pull away from the boss. When you have a drill master enslaved it casts a debuff that stacks on the boss reducing its armor by 100% and increasing effective DPS.\nThis tactic is only functional in NON-HEROIC DIFFICULTY."}

They were invented by a young &lt;a href=\"Gelbin%20Mekkatorque\"&gt;Gelbin Mekkatorque&lt;/a&gt;, launching the young gnome's fame and setting him on the path of leadership as &lt;a href=\"High%20Tinker\"&gt;High Tinker&lt;/a&gt;.\nGnomes.\nThe gnomes' revolutionary mechanostrider represents yet another marvel of their &lt;a href=\"engineering\"&gt;engineering&lt;/a&gt; prowess. Each strider is specifically designed with the individual rider in mind. They are constructed using state-of-the-art steam compression, servo-motor dynamics, and duro-steel plating. This offers the rider a reliable and durable means of transportation. Some claim that the mechanostrider's lack of true sentience makes for a very dumb mount. However, the gnomes counter that under a skilled rider, the mechanostrider is more responsive than even the best trained live mount.\nHistory.\nA young Gelbin Mekkatorque envisioned the first mechanostrider in &lt;a href=\"Sector%2017\"&gt;Sector 17&lt;/a&gt;, his &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt; quarters, which had allowed his diminutive people to match pace with the mighty &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Horse\"&gt;chargers&lt;/a&gt;. This creation was the one that launched his fame and set him on the path to leadership and the position of &lt;a href=\"High%20Tinker\"&gt;High Tinker&lt;/a&gt;. Mekkatorque's first working prototype still exists, stored as the centerpiece of his trophy case in Sector 17. All end models still echo the avian gait and kettle-bellied form of the prototype. These features are referred to as the Mekkatorque designs.\nMechagnomes.\nIt is interesting to note that &lt;a href=\"mechagnome\"&gt;mechagnome&lt;/a&gt;s, some of whom would become progenitors of the gnomish race, have been found in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, and riding what appears to be &lt;a href=\"White%20Mechanostrider%20Mod%20B\"&gt;White Mechanostrider Mod B&lt;/a&gt;'s. The enigmatic mechagnomes have adopted Gelbin Mekkatorque's invention for their own mysterious purposes. Mekkatorque considered it to be quite flattering that a race of machines would see fit to use his machine to get around.\nMechanostrider mounts.\nMechanostrider mounts are available to all Alliance races, while they're initially for gnomes, gaining exalted status with &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt; will allow players to buy and use them. Most can be purchased at &lt;a href=\"Steelgrill%27s%20Depot\"&gt;Steelgrill's Depot&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe following does not require exalted status with Gnomeregan and is sold at the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Tournament%20Grounds\"&gt;Argent Tournament Grounds&lt;/a&gt;.\nPatch 3.0.8.\nIn &lt;a href=\"patch%203.0.8\"&gt;patch 3.0.8&lt;/a&gt;, the racial size restriction on mounts was lifted, with the mechanostrider becoming available to all Alliance races when exalted with &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt;. Before this, only gnomes and &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; were allowed to ride mechanostriders due to the physical size of these races. The RPG information for these mounts was probably an inspiration for making such a restriction in the first place.\nIn the RPG.\nThe mechanostrider is a &lt;a href=\"construct\"&gt;medium onstruct&lt;/a&gt; which vaguely resembles a mechanized &lt;a href=\"tallstrider\"&gt;tallstrider&lt;/a&gt;. Small oval lamps replace its eyes, while great mufflers extend where its tailfeathers should be.\nWhen gnomes set out to explore the world once again after their city's fall, they soon realized that they needed reliable mechanical mounts because they were mocked for their short stature and slow land speed. Tired of being mocked, the gnomes developed these revolutionary modes of travel. One ingenious gnome spied a flock of tallstriders and remarked upon their grace and strength. Soon after was born the mechanostrider, which quickly became a favorite mount of all gnome-kind. Using steam compression and duro-steel plating, the finest gnomish tinkers created these ostrich-like striders to use as mounts. The mechanostrider can move at speeds up to 30 mph.\nAll gnome tinkers agree that the striders are only available for small humanoids. Although some &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s have purchased striders for themselves, most of these striders have only proud gnomish passengers. This mechanostrider represents an older model and, while outdated, is a viable and cheaper vehicle. The current model is mechanostrider v. 2.0.\nThey have a final build dimension of six feet and 300 pounds.\nCombat.\nA mechanostrider fights only when ordered to or threatened, lashing out with its sharp beak and claws, or simply hammering at the dnage with its heavy metallic head."}

However, any race that is \"not\" descended from the &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt; (for example goblins, trolls, elves, or alien races) would be eradicated completely.

Those who were partially mechanized like herself and Erazmin survived, although many were killed or converted in the ensuing battle.\nInterestingly, despite Erazmin initially believing that a big danger of mechanization is losing one's emotions and sense of being, this is not true with &lt;a href=\"Bondo%20Bigblock\"&gt;Bondo Bigblock&lt;/a&gt; who makes a deal to be completely mechanized, and he clearly recognizes the adventurer.

She gave birth following her assassination of King &lt;a href=\"Llane%20Wrynn\"&gt;Llane Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; and, fearing that she may again be compelled to kill those closest to her, gave him up to &lt;a href=\"Meryl%20Felstorm\"&gt;Meryl Winterstorm&lt;/a&gt;, a millennia-old &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; and member of the original &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Council of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt;.\nMeryl raised Med'an as his adopted son in the war-torn region of &lt;a href=\"Duskwood\"&gt;Duskwood&lt;/a&gt;, while Garona secretly watched over him from afar. Taking up residence in &lt;a href=\"Brightwood%20Grove\"&gt;Brightwood Grove&lt;/a&gt;, Meryl taught Med'an armed combat and, as the youth grew closer to adulthood, helped guide him in his mastery of &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;ic and &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; magic.\nLearning the truth.\nWhile gathering firewood one night, not long after King &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn's&lt;/a&gt; victory over &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Onyxia&lt;/a&gt;, Med'an and Meryl fell under attack from a band of &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer%20clan\"&gt;Twilight Cultists&lt;/a&gt;. Dispatched by the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; mage &lt;a href=\"Stasia%20Fallshadow\"&gt;Stasia Fallshadow&lt;/a&gt;, who had witnessed Med'an in a &lt;a href=\"Pools%20of%20Vision\"&gt;vision&lt;/a&gt; relating to an ancient prophecy, the cultists gained the upper hand until Garona emerged from the shadows, swiftly killing the assailants and giving Meryl and Med'an a chance to escape.\nMed'an recognized Garona as a woman who had once protected him as a child, and hearing an utterance of &lt;a href=\"Eredun\"&gt;Eredun&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 the language of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 went back to help her. Upon returning to the scene of the ambush, however, he found that she had disappeared. In truth, Garona had been Stasia's target, Med'an the bait to lure her out of hiding, and the demonic phrase a control word once used by Gul'dan to magically ensorcell her.\nEager to find the woman responsible for his rescue and unsure of why Meryl would hide her identity, Med'an listened in on a conversation between Meryl and &lt;a href=\"Koron\"&gt;Koron&lt;/a&gt;, a Forsaken spy. Learning that she was actually his mother and that the &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the Twilight's Hammer clan, had captured her with the intent of sending her to &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt; to assassinate King Varian Wrynn and others at an upcoming peace summit, Med'an stole Koron's &lt;a href=\"vampire%20bat\"&gt;vampire bat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Snubnose\"&gt;Snubnose&lt;/a&gt;, and set out alone to rescue her.\nTheramore peace summit.\nMed'an managed to track down Stasia and his mother to an island off the coast of &lt;a href=\"Dustwallow%20Marsh\"&gt;Dustwallow Marsh&lt;/a&gt; and there observed them from a safe distance. Awakening the next morning to sounds of an argument, Med'an discovered that Garona was being magically controlled and the mental programming was beginning to wear off, but Stasia was planning on killing her after completing the task. The cultists disembarked and Med'an took flight after them, but by the time he arrived in Theramore the peace summit had already become a battlefield.\nAmid the chaos, Med'an found Garona in a furious battle with Varian Wrynn, who desired vengeance for the murder of his father. Med'an attempted to aid his mother, saving &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin's&lt;/a&gt; life and getting injured by &lt;a href=\"Fanghorn\"&gt;Fanghorn&lt;/a&gt; in the process. Sensing that her forces were being defeated, Stasia spoke the command word to paralyze Garona, leaving her to be killed by the king. Med'an lept to her defense but was tossed aside by Varian, only to be captured by a retreating Stasia.\nEscape from Ahn'Qiraj.\nWhile his mother was detained for questioning as a prisoner of Theramore by &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, and the Alliance and Horde prepared for the coming &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, Med'an was taken into the depths of &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt;. There, Cho'gall hung him on the corpse of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"C%27Thun\"&gt;C'Thun&lt;/a&gt;, where he would be tormented by the Old God's mad whisperings, and began making preparations for its resurrection.\nIn Theramore, &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn's&lt;/a&gt; sorcery helped Garona break through a mental barrier to reveal the location of her son, just as Meryl arrived. &lt;a href=\"Valeera%20Sanguinar\"&gt;Valeera Sanguinar&lt;/a&gt; reluctantly joined the undead mage and the two teleported into Ahn'Qiraj, where they did battle with the Twilight Cult and killed Stasia. Making their way further into the ruined temple, they confronted the increasingly hideous Cho'gall, mutated by the power of the Old God.\nTogether they managed to recover Med'an, but were intercepted by &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt;. Unable to fend off Cho'gall and with Meryl knocked unconscious, Valeera grew desperate and offered her body willingly to to the &lt;a href=\"dreadlord\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kathra%27natir\"&gt;Kathra'natir&lt;/a&gt; in order to use his power to fend off Chog'all. This gave Med'an enough time to revive Meryl who was able to teleport them all away to a secure location. It was there that Kathra'natir coveted Med'an's body and power and tried to possess Med'an's body in order to take his powers for his own. Med'an however, was able to reject the demon through his own will. In order to lure the demon away from Valeera, Meryl was forced to become its host. The trio teleported to Theramore, where Aegwynn immediately recognized the youth as her grandson but remained silent. Med'an was taken to see his mother, only to find that Garona had escaped. Meryl used his sorcery to determine her location, the now vacant &lt;a href=\"Onyxia%27s%20Lair\"&gt;Onyxia's Lair&lt;/a&gt;, and Valeera set out alone to recover her \u2014 with Med'an following close behind.\nFamily reunions.\nMed'an arrived at Onyxia's Lair to find his mother preparing to leave on Valeera's wyvern while Valeera fought her rescuer, the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Vindicator%20Maraad\"&gt;Vindicator Maraad&lt;/a&gt;. In their brief reunion, Garona revealed to Med'an that he was part-draenei and that Maraad was his great uncle. Unwilling to put her son at risk while she still remained subject to Cho'gall's magic, she asked Med'an to stay behind with Maraad and Meryl, and to tell Jaina everything that had happened.\nIn the cavern Med'an separated Maraad and Valeera, telling them that they weren't enemies and that Garona had departed. Though he did not know it at the time, she secretly traveled to Ahn'Qiraj. Med'an then again fell victim to the whisperings of C'Thun, but Maraad channeled the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt; to help him. As the group teleported back to Theramore, Med'an asked Maraad if he could be taught to use the Light, and Maraad agreed to teach him what he could if he was willing to dedicate himself to years of discipline.\nNew Council of Tirisfal.\nIn Theramore, Med'an and his newfound allies discussed the threat of Cho'gall and the Twilight's Hammer. With the armies of the Horde and Alliance now focused on the war in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, Meryl and Aegwynn decided that it was time for the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Council of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"New%20Council%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;begin anew&lt;/a&gt;.\nMed'an began training with Maraad to use the Light, showing a natural affinity for it and quickly grasping the basics to help drive away the Old One's continued whispers. Meanwhile, it was decided that the re-formed council must also include practitioners of &lt;a href=\"nature\"&gt;nature&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"holy\"&gt;divine magic&lt;/a&gt;, a result of the on-going &lt;a href=\"Nexus%20War\"&gt;Nexus War&lt;/a&gt; and the actions of &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos the Spellweaver&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Aspect\"&gt;Aspect&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;. To that end, the group prepared to travel to &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Morogh\"&gt;Dun Morogh&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; to seek out noteworthy candidates.\nAs Jaina returned from &lt;a href=\"Razor%20Hill\"&gt;Razor Hill&lt;/a&gt; with the shaman &lt;a href=\"Rehgar%20Earthfury\"&gt;Rehgar Earthfury&lt;/a&gt;, Theramore came under attack from a &lt;a href=\"Faceless%20One\"&gt;Faceless One&lt;/a&gt; that had been awakened by &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt;. During the battle, Med'an intuitively wove together arcane and shamanic magic to defeat the ancient creature, then healed Valeera by simultaneously calling upon the power of the Light and the earth. Unaware that he had done anything special, he remarked simply that he had only done what others had taught him, and that he still had much to learn.\nRealizing that Med'an must be chosen as the new &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardian of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt; and that he would not be safe on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, it was decided that he would travel with Maraad to &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt;, beyond the reach of the Old God. Aegwynn also came to the conclusion that she should not burden her grandson with &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh's&lt;/a&gt; legacy and asked Meryl to keep his father's identity a secret. Even so, that night Med'an was visited by a vision of his father, beckoning him to &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt;.\nJourney to Outland.\nUnwilling to face the truth \u2014 that he was the son of the hated man who opened the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; and brought ruin to both Azeroth and &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 Med'an traveled to Outland with his great uncle. There he was shown the &lt;a href=\"Path%20of%20Glory\"&gt;Path of Glory&lt;/a&gt; and the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Auchindoun\"&gt;Auchindoun&lt;/a&gt;, causing Med'an to feel even more shame in his orcish ancestry.\nIn Shattrath, however, Med'an learned from &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;, who had once served his father and worked alongside Garona, that the two had been doomed even before birth, victims of &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; and Gul'dan. Even so, he says that for Med'an to have been born they must have fought against their fate, and through him the demonic forces may yet be undone. Before returning to Azeroth with &lt;a href=\"Dalynnia%20Wrathscar\"&gt;Dalynnia Wrathscar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"A%27dal\"&gt;A'dal&lt;/a&gt; urged Med'an to meditate on his decisions, cautioning that his choices could lead him to become a weapon against evil or a bringer of doom.\nInto Karazhan.\nReturning through Dark Portal, Med'an decided that he must hear what his father has to tell, and teleported to the nearby tower of Karazhan, following his father's voice. There he met not his father, but an avatar of Medivh's remaining power, which had waited for years to deliver him a message. The avatar magically transported Medivh to a gigantic &lt;a href=\"Chess%20Event\"&gt;chess board&lt;/a&gt; where they, along with Garona, Llane, Aegwynn, Khadgar, and &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt;, played the roles of chess pieces.\nAtop the board, Medivh told Med'an of his life, possession by Sargeras, rebellious affair with Garona, eventual death at the hands of Khadgar and Anduin, and redemptive return to the world as the Last Guardian, guiding the denizens of Azeroth to victory at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Battle of Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;. Declaring that he wished for Med'an to have the freedom that he himself was deprived of, Med'an was magically granted armor and Medivh's power to do with whatever he chose.\nIn an instant the chess board was transformed, with Med'an's own allies taking place of the chess pieces, and Cho'gall and an army of &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt;s appearing as his opponents. Deciding that he would fight the ogre, he issued a challenge and then teleported to Theramore. There he found the city under siege by a \"real\" army of elementals, summoned from the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Plane\"&gt;Elemental Plane&lt;/a&gt; by Cho'gall to wreak havoc on Azeroth.\nJoining battle alongside the new order \u2014 now counting &lt;a href=\"High%20Priest%20Rohan\"&gt;Rohan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hamuul%20Runetotem\"&gt;Hamuul Runetotem&lt;/a&gt; as members \u2014 Med'an wielded his powers to try and free the elementals from the Old God's control. Meryl, who had recently returned from a meeting in Ahn'Qiraj with Garona, during which he tasked her with finding the &lt;a href=\"base%20of%20Atiesh\"&gt;base of Atiesh&lt;/a&gt;, was forced to rely again upon the power of the demon Kathra'natir, and a hasty attempt to infuse Med'an with the powers of the council failed and knocked him unconscious, but &lt;a href=\"Broll%20Bearmantle\"&gt;Broll Bearmantle&lt;/a&gt;'s arrival paved the way for a victory.\nGuardian of Tirisfal.\nUpon awakening, Med'an was informed by Aegwynn that the council, now complete, was preparing a formal investiture ceremony. He explained to her that he had traveled to Karazhan and there had been granted knowledge and power by his father. Concerned that some of the other members of the council might not accept him as Guardian were they to know his heritage, she wished for him to keep it a secret, but tired of secrets and lies, Med'an stated that they would have to accept him for who he is if they wanted him as their Guardian.\nEntering the meeting, Med'an requested that the members offer him their power so that he could fight Cho'gall and fulfill the prophecy by bringing about peace. Aegwynn, Maraad, and Meryl explained his particular parentage and upbringing, while Rehgar and Hamuul offered support, saying that his mixed heritage made him an ideal choice. Broll, Dalynnia, and Rohan agreed, should he wish to accept the role, though Meryl noted that he could not join the Order, since the demon within him could not be allowed access to the group.\nAs the members of the Order prepared to transport themselves to the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;, where they could safely perform the necessary rites upon Med'an, Meryl set out for &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt; with Valeera and Aegwynn, eager to rejoin Garona and lend their aid to the new Guardian when the time for battle arrived.\nReturn to Ahn'Qiraj.\nIn the Twisting Nether, the council performed the investiture ceremony and Med'an thanked them for their trust and shared power, vowing to use it wisely before teleporting to Ahn'Qiraj. There he joined his allies and did battle with Cho'gall, who revealed to him that his plan was to sacrifice Med'an and use his potent magical power to resurrect C'Thun. Cho'gall began performing the rites and channeled a great deal of energy, but Med'an was able to contain it within a ward around the ogre.\nIn Meryl's following attempt to have Med'an cleanse the Base of Atiesh of its demonic taint, however, Meryl lost his hold over Kathra'natir and the demon traced the flow of Med'an's magical energy into the Twisting Nether, attacking the Council and weakening Med'an. At Aegwynn and Meryl's behest, Valeera and Garona delivered the now-purified base of Atiesh to Med'an, while an injured Aegwynn gave up her life so that Meryl might channel her remaining energy into her grandson. In the Twisting Nether, the surviving Council members managed to restrain the dreadlord using their combined powers.\nRestoring &lt;a href=\"Atiesh%2C%20Greatstaff%20of%20the%20Guardian\"&gt;Atiesh, Greatstaff of the Guardian&lt;/a&gt; to its rightful state, Med'an focused the powers of the council through it to defeat Cho'gall. Following the battle, the Council mourned the death of Aegwynn, but Med'an offered them comfort, saying that she willingly gave her life and will live on through him. With the battle over, Med'an returned the powers to the Council, thanking them for letting him see the world through their eyes and showing him how much he has yet to learn.\nAt &lt;a href=\"Morgan%27s%20Plot\"&gt;Morgan's Plot&lt;/a&gt;, west of Karazhan, the Council laid Aegwynn to rest, near Medivh. Meryl, having regained control over Kathra'natir, renamed himself Meryl Felstorm and went into exile with Garona, vowing to hunt down and destroy what remained of the Twilight's Hammer. The rest of the Council parted ways while Med'an remained under the care and tutelage of his uncle, Maraad.\nRecent activities.\nMed'an stepped down from his position as Guardian after defeating Cho'gall and the New Council has yet to choose a successor. No one has seen Med'an following Maraad's return to the \"&lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt;\", leading some to believe that he has traveled to a new world or plane to continue his training. By the time of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt;, Med'an is out adventuring in the universe, doing important things that will one day come to fruition.\nCanonicity.\nAt &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon%202016\"&gt;BlizzCon 2016&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alex%20Afrasiabi\"&gt;Alex Afrasiabi&lt;/a&gt; stated that \"\"Med'an as Guardian isn't considered canon in Warcraft lore, which is why in the last five years you haven't seen a reference to him\" but that it \"doesn't mean that there can't be a story for Med'an, it's just not like it was laid out in the comics.\"\" Afrasiabi later reconfirmed that the character himself and the comic series are still canon, but him being Guardian isn't.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Chronicle%20Volume%203\"&gt;Chronicle Volume 3&lt;/a&gt;\" listed Med'an as being mentioned on page 404, a non-existing page number which is a reference to the browser code. Med'an not being a Guardian was reinforced when \"Chronicle\" recounted the events of the Comic without mentioning Guardian Med'an, and in \"&lt;a href=\"Harbingers\"&gt;Harbingers&lt;/a&gt;\" where Khadgar states that after Medivh's death, it was decided that \"none could resist the temptation of the Guardian's powers\" implying that there has been no Guardian after Medivh.\nSpeculation.\nAs &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Draenor%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;alternate Draenor&lt;/a&gt; uses Atiesh, Med'an may have given it to the archmage. However, it is hinted that Atiesh remained in Med'an's hands by the time of the end of the &lt;a href=\"War%20in%20Draenor\"&gt;Draenor campaign&lt;/a&gt;.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

In a &lt;a href=\"Tablets%20of%20Baa%27ri\"&gt;long quest line&lt;/a&gt; beginning with the &lt;a href=\"Aldor\"&gt;Aldor&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Scryers\"&gt;Scryers&lt;/a&gt; (depending on the player's faction), the player is sent to the Ata'mal Terrace, located on the Temple's northern battlements, to obtain the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Fury\"&gt;Heart of Fury&lt;/a&gt;, one of the shards of the &lt;a href=\"Ata%27mal%20crystal\"&gt;Ata'mal crystal&lt;/a&gt;. Akama places the Heart of Fury into the empty socket of his Medallion of Karabor and instructs the player to bring it to A'dal (&lt;a href=\"Akama%27s%20Promise\"&gt;Akama's Promise&lt;/a&gt;). Afterwards, a Broken named &lt;a href=\"Seer%20Olum\"&gt;Seer Olum&lt;/a&gt; is opened up in &lt;a href=\"Serpentshrine%20Cavern\"&gt;Serpentshrine Cavern&lt;/a&gt;, where he reveals that the &lt;a href=\"Ashtongue%20Deathsworn\"&gt;Ashtongue's&lt;/a&gt; secret - their intent to overthrow Illidan - has been uncovered by &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Vashj\"&gt;Lady Vashj&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;. Then under orders from Illidan himself, Akama's Ashtongue are sent to &lt;a href=\"Tempest%20Keep\"&gt;Tempest Keep&lt;/a&gt; to slay &lt;a href=\"Al%27ar\"&gt;Al'ar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"phoenix\"&gt;phoenix&lt;/a&gt;. Lastly, the players travel to the very gates of the Temple itself and do battle with Illidari demons, allowing Akama and &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; to enter the Temple to later aid you in the battle against Illidan. The naaru &lt;a href=\"Xi%27ri\"&gt;Xi'ri&lt;/a&gt; will then give you the Medallion.\nThe Medallion of Karabor presumably works like a similar necklace-attunement, the &lt;a href=\"Drakefire%20Amulet\"&gt;Drakefire Amulet&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Onyxia's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Onyxia%27s%20Lair\"&gt;Lair&lt;/a&gt;), in that you must have it in your inventory but not necessarily be wearing it, in order to enter the Black Temple.\nAfter completing the quest &lt;a href=\"The%20Fall%20of%20the%20Betrayer\"&gt;The Fall of the Betrayer&lt;/a&gt;, the Medallion becomes the which, prior to patch 2.4, allowed entry into the Black Temple. It also allows the player to teleport directly to the doorstep of Illidan's fortress. The medallion is no longer needed to enter the Black Temple.\nA &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Medallion%20of%20Karabor\"&gt;Broken Medallion of Karabor&lt;/a&gt; was retrieved by the &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"demon%20hunter\"&gt;demon hunter&lt;/a&gt;s to &lt;a href=\"Back%20in%20Black\"&gt;infiltrate&lt;/a&gt; the Ashtongue-held Black Temple."}

The organization mostly consists of &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s, with members of the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"jungle%20troll\"&gt;jungle troll&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; races. It is named after &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Circle has many posts, but their main home is the town of &lt;a href=\"Nighthaven\"&gt;Nighthaven&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Moonglade\"&gt;Moonglade&lt;/a&gt;. Druids learn to teleport to Nighthaven at level 10, but anyone else will have to wait until they can make it to &lt;a href=\"Felwood\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt; and find a way through the &lt;a href=\"Timbermaw%20Hold\"&gt;Timbermaw Hold&lt;/a&gt; tunnels. Other alternatives include receiving a summon from a Warlock and two other players, 2-man flying mount, or waiting for the &lt;a href=\"Lunar%20Festival\"&gt;Lunar Festival&lt;/a&gt;, which coincides with Chinese New Year, and complete a simple quest from any pre-BC capital to receive the &lt;a href=\"Lunar%20Festival%20Invitation\"&gt;Lunar Festival Invitation&lt;/a&gt;. This is a &lt;a href=\"Travel%20guide%20for%20special%20occasions\"&gt;special occasion&lt;/a&gt; that should not be missed!\nThe Circle's other major presence is in &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;, where they combat the &lt;a href=\"silithid\"&gt;silithid&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"qiraji\"&gt;qiraji&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Hold\"&gt;Cenarion Hold&lt;/a&gt; serves as their base in the hostile land, and offers many opportunities to adventurers seeking to aid the druids. They fight the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; alongside the other &lt;a href=\"Class%20Order\"&gt;class orders&lt;/a&gt; during the demons' &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Cenarion Circle operates outside of &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;'s authority, and is apparently currently co-led by &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;, along with several Archdruids including &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hamuul%20Runetotem\"&gt;Hamuul Runetotem&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nCurse of the Worgen.\nNamed in honor of the demigod Cenarius, the Cenarion Circle ensures the protection of nature and its creatures. Furthermore, the members of this faction act as keepers of ancient lore and pay particular attention to the traditional ways of the druids. In their role of protectors of nature, the men and women of the Cenarion Circle also strive to maintain the fragile balance within the world.\nThe faction was founded by Malfurion Stormrage, named after Cenarius. Initially, the Cenarion Circle was created to combat the growing threat of the &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt;. Malfurion trained the first druids to join the group, but soon appealed to &lt;a href=\"Remulos\"&gt;Remulos&lt;/a&gt;, one of the sons of Cenarius, for help. Remulos played a major role in forming the group and he taught young druids all the secrets they would need to master.\nLong Vigil.\nSome of the druids, along with other units, rallied under &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Shifting%20Sands\"&gt;War of the Shifting Sands&lt;/a&gt;. Though they suffered heavy casualties in pushing the &lt;a href=\"qiraji\"&gt;qiraji&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"silithid\"&gt;silithid&lt;/a&gt; back, the night elves were successful in temporarily ending this threat to &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the war, they established &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Hold\"&gt;Cenarion Hold&lt;/a&gt; to guard the imprisoned &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"C%27Thun\"&gt;C'Thun&lt;/a&gt; and its forces.\nThird War.\nUpon being roused from their sleep, the &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Talon\"&gt;Druids of the Talon&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Claw\"&gt;Druids of the Claw&lt;/a&gt; participated in the defense against the Burning Legion's invasion of Kalimdor. Led by Malfurion, they assisted the &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt; and tried to find the &lt;a href=\"Wild%20God\"&gt;Wild God&lt;/a&gt;s but were unsuccessful. They ultimately fought in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Battle of Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; where they assisted Malfurion with his plan to sacrifice Nordrassil's ancient power in order to defeat the Legion.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nWith the passing years, the organization grew to include tauren, who shared similar views, as well as members of other races, until it reached its present form. The Cenarion Circle now includes many more members than it did originally, though its total numbers are still few. Its agents are active throughout Azeroth but are especially present on Kalimdor. Men and women from both the Alliance and the Horde are now welcomed in the Cenarion Circle, but the majority of its members are still night elf men.\nThe Cenarion Circle is not without conflict. Fandral Staghelm, taking the mantle of archdruid after &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; entered the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;, objected to the introduction of the tauren into the order. He also embarked upon the creation of a new &lt;a href=\"World%20Tree\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;, despite the objections of Remulos.\nThe Cenarion Circle in Darnassus was looking for seasoned adventurers to lend them aid in a vital research project. Arch Druid Staghelm was spearheading this research. Similarly, the same research was also spearheaded in Thunder Bluff by Hamuul Runetotem.\nOver the years, many druids of the Circle joined or created various subgroups. After the reopening of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, the Circle sent an expeditionary force called the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Expedition\"&gt;Cenarion Expedition&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. Although it began as a small venture controlled directly by the Cenarion Circle, the Expedition eventually grew into a large and fairly autonomous group, although it still relied on its parent organization's support. After learning of the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;'s plans to drain the waters of &lt;a href=\"Zangarmarsh\"&gt;Zangarmarsh&lt;/a&gt;, the Expedition asked for aid from the Circle. Although affairs in &lt;a href=\"Moonglade\"&gt;Moonglade&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt; had kept the Circle members occupied, the Circle promised to send the necessary resources to the Expedition's forces.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Druids%20for%20the%20Ethical%20and%20Humane%20Treatment%20of%20Animals\"&gt;Druids for the Ethical and Humane Treatment of Animals&lt;/a&gt;\u2014a radical splinter group of the Cenarion Expedition\u2014appeared in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; to make war on the famed &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Hemet%20Nesingwary\"&gt;Hemet Nesingwary&lt;/a&gt; and stop his decimation of wildlife.\n&lt;a href=\"Fhyron%20Shadesong\"&gt;Fhyron Shadesong&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rayne\"&gt;Rayne&lt;/a&gt; also appeared in Northrend.\nThe Shattering.\nAfter the defeat of the Lich King, the night elves broke off all trade ties with the Horde due to the events of the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20the%20Wrath%20Gate\"&gt;Battle of the Wrath Gate&lt;/a&gt;. While &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; advocated aggression as a way to obtain necessary resources for Orgrimmar and Durotar, Archdruid &lt;a href=\"Hamuul%20Runetotem\"&gt;Hamuul Runetotem&lt;/a&gt; suggested he use his personal friendships with the kaldorei to find a more peaceable way to resolve their differences, arguing that even the night elves would likely take no pleasure in the suffering of Horde children, which Thrall and Cairne both fully supported. Despite initial reluctance and tension, Hamuul managed to arrange a meeting with his old friend &lt;a href=\"Elerethe%20Renferal\"&gt;Elerethe Renferal&lt;/a&gt;, both accompanied by a group of other Cenarion Circle druids. However, all of the gathered druids, with the sole exception of Hamuul, were ambushed and slain by the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; disguised as Horde members, destroying their attempted peace process, and further worsening Alliance-Horde relations. This event subsequently led to the death of &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; after he challenged Garrosh to &lt;a href=\"mak%27gora\"&gt;mak'gora&lt;/a&gt;, believing him responsible for authorizing the unprovoked attack on the Circle members, and his son &lt;a href=\"Baine\"&gt;Baine&lt;/a&gt; succeeded him as leader of the tauren.\nCataclysm.\nAfter the war against the Lich King, members of the Cenarion Circle partnered with the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; to help heal the &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands\"&gt;Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;. When the forces of &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros the Firelord&lt;/a&gt; attacked Mount Hyjal, the mountain was defended by an alliance between the Cenarion Circle and the &lt;a href=\"green%20dragonflight\"&gt;green dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; known as the &lt;a href=\"Guardians%20of%20Hyjal\"&gt;Guardians of Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;. Unconcerned with the Guardians' defensive maneuvers, another group called the &lt;a href=\"Avengers%20of%20Hyjal\"&gt;Avengers of Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; was later formed to end the threat of the Firelord once and for all by invading Ragnaros' own realm, the &lt;a href=\"Firelands\"&gt;Firelands&lt;/a&gt;.\nTraveler.\nThe tauren druid &lt;a href=\"Galena%20Stormspear\"&gt;Galena Stormspear&lt;/a&gt;, accompanied by the &lt;a href=\"blue%20drake\"&gt;blue drake&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Telagos\"&gt;Telagos&lt;/a&gt;, reported the events of the battle at the &lt;a href=\"Hidden%20citadel\"&gt;Hidden citadel&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; to the Cenarion Circle in the &lt;a href=\"Moonglade\"&gt;Moonglade&lt;/a&gt;. The druids were impressed that Galena had convinced Telagos to meet with them. The drake spent several days studying the druids, and the druids studied him.\nLegion.\nThe Cenarion Circle moves the bulk of its forces to the &lt;a href=\"Dreamgrove\"&gt;Dreamgrove&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Val%27sharah\"&gt;Val'sharah&lt;/a&gt;, the ancient forest where Malfurion first learned druidism under the tutelage of Cenarius. There they battle the forces of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; across the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;, but most predominately &lt;a href=\"Xavius\"&gt;Xavius&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Cenarion Circle lost nearly all its members in Silithus with the destruction of &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Hold\"&gt;Cenarion Hold&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; sent more members of the Circle there and, with the &lt;a href=\"Sisters%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Sisters of Elune&lt;/a&gt;, the druids planned to build &lt;a href=\"moonwell\"&gt;moonwell&lt;/a&gt;s in an attempt to heal and stabilize Azeroth's wound. &lt;a href=\"Hamuul%20Runetotem\"&gt;Hamuul Runetotem&lt;/a&gt; voiced his hopes of building a new Hold in the region as well as renewing cooperation with the Alliance through the Circle, but the Warchief &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; was much less receptive to his suggestions.\nBattle for Azeroth and aftermath.\nThe Cenarion Circle sent several &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle%20Druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s, including Broll and Hamuul, to &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;, and joined the &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; to help heal the wound left by &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, but initially their efforts seemed to be having little effect.\nWhile Malfurion Stormrage and other druids actively participated in the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the Cenarion Circle and its sub-groups seemed to have largely remained neutral, with &lt;a href=\"Tholo%20Whitehoof\"&gt;Tholo Whitehoof&lt;/a&gt; remaining on &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt; and fighting alongside &lt;a href=\"Anren%20Shadowseeker\"&gt;Anren Shadowseeker&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the Fourth War, just like the Earthen Ring, the druids in Moonglade noted disturbances in the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;spirit world&lt;/a&gt;. \nTyrande, Malfurion, the Sentinels and their people returned to &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, making it their new temporary home in the wake of &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;'s destruction. The tauren druid &lt;a href=\"Tiala%20Whitemane\"&gt;Tiala Whitemane&lt;/a&gt; was mentioned as still guarding the World Tree, and with her assistance, &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt; member &lt;a href=\"Yukha\"&gt;Yukha&lt;/a&gt; was able to temporarily negotiate safe passage to &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Council\"&gt;Horde Council&lt;/a&gt; leaders, leading to a tense meeting between them and the night elves.\nAfter the war, the Cenarion Circle vowed to repair the damage done to &lt;a href=\"Staghelm%20Point\"&gt;Staghelm Point&lt;/a&gt;, and they planted the Sentinel Tree in memoriam of the defenders lost here, including &lt;a href=\"Ralo%27shan%20the%20Eternal%20Watcher\"&gt;Ralo'shan&lt;/a&gt;.\nShadowlands.\nThe Cenarion Circle makes its appearance in the druid section of the &lt;a href=\"Training%20Hall\"&gt;Training Hall&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Barracks%20%28Orgrimmar%29\"&gt;Barracks&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"Amaria%20Wildthorn\"&gt;Amaria Wildthorn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mithlos%20Falconbriar\"&gt;Mithlos Falconbriar&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Telotha%20Pinegrove\"&gt;Telotha Pinegrove&lt;/a&gt; as druid trainers.\nDragonflight.\nSeveral druids of the Cenarion Circle traveled to &lt;a href=\"Shady%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Shady Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Ohn%27ahran%20Plains\"&gt;Ohn'ahran Plains&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;, including Hamuul, Zen'tabra, and Celestine.\nWar of the Shifting Sands.\nThe Circle's main concern is currently combating the threat of the Silithid and Qiraji. From the official World of Warcraft &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/basics/factions/cenarion/\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; Reputation page:\n\"War is brewing in the distant lands of Silithus. All over the world, men and women are gearing up for one final push into the heart of the Qiraji empire to end the threat which has been lying in wait, barely contained behind the barrier erected by the Night Elven druids and the mighty dragon Anachronos during the climactic battle at the end of the War of the Shifting Sands. Ever since that fateful day, the members of the Cenarion Circle have kept a close watch on the wastes from their base at Cenarion Hold at the center of northern Silithus. There, the Night Elven and Tauren disciples of the magnificent demigod Cenarius have been waiting for the time when a hero would step forward to unleash the might of all the mortal races against the sinister Qiraji and their innumerable legions of Silithid minions. But the druids have not been idle during their long watch; they have crafted formidable weapons, armors and enchanted ornaments to assist all those who will brave the terrors of Ahn'Qiraj. Adventurers who have proven their worth in battle against the Qiraji forces beyond the Scarab Wall will be granted access to the ancient order's arsenal.\n\"At last, the long watch has ended - the hero has risen, to mend that which was broken, to unite those who were divided. But the true test is yet to come. When the gates of Ahn'Qiraj open, will the mortal races stand united once again and face the onrushing terror, or will they fade silently into the darkness that has risen once again in the distant lands of Silithus?\nCulture.\nThe Cenarion Circle refer to themselves as a brotherhood. All druids are welcomed to the sacred lands of Moonglade that offer knowledge and solace. Every year the druids of Moonglade hold a &lt;a href=\"Lunar%20Festival\"&gt;celebration&lt;/a&gt; of the great triumph over an &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;ancient evil&lt;/a&gt;.\nTeachings and power.\nThe druids of the Circle devote themselves to protecting the wilds and natural balance of Azeroth. The Circle embraces druids regardless of the places they come from, similar to the &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt;. In their eyes, all are connected to the Great Cycle. In the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;, druids gain insight and oneness with the Great Cycle.\nCenarion druids rely on the wisdom and power of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Bear%20Spirit\"&gt;Great Bear Spirit&lt;/a&gt; to fuel their purpose. \nAnimals and plants are the Circle's friends as well as charges. They choose to devote their lives as preservers of balance for their sakes as well as the Circle's own. &lt;a href=\"Dryad\"&gt;Dryad&lt;/a&gt;s are considered sacred to the Circle.\nCenarion druids have power over poison since &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt; blessed them with the ability to purge even the most foul of poisons with a mere incantation. Druids are able to enchant and carve branches with glyphs into the bark. With one such branch, the druids in Darnassus and Thunder Bluff obtained valuable information on the extent of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;'s plague in the &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands\"&gt;Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;. Druids can also peer into crystals and unlock their mysteries.\nThe druids in Darnassus used the water of the &lt;a href=\"moonwell\"&gt;moonwell&lt;/a&gt;s of Teldrassil, and their moonwell had to be replenished from time to time.\nTraining.\nBefore entering the Emerald Dream, young students must make preparations. Mentors teach how to interpret not only what the spirits communicate to the druids, but also the complexities and secrets of the Emerald Dream. As they learn and grow in power, they will learn more of the sleeping trance. Druids of the Circle in the past were put through pre-planned trials. Young druids undergo first lessons into the role as a protector of balance. One of the first steps is to learn of the ways of the &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Claw\"&gt;bear&lt;/a&gt;, and to learn strength of body and heart. The wise and noble Great Bear Spirit serves as a tutor and mentor into the first true natural understanding of the nature of the bear for all druids.\nAs the students grow in power and develop themselves as valued protectors of nature, they learn about the other animal aspects that Cenarius has blessed them with the ability to change into, including the aquatic form that affords the command and mastery of the water. To earn it, one must overcome two trials overseen by &lt;a href=\"Dendrite%20Starblaze\"&gt;Dendrite Starblaze&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tajarri\"&gt;Tajarri&lt;/a&gt;:\nIn the first trial, the aspiring druid searches the depths of &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Elune%27ara\"&gt;Lake Elune'ara&lt;/a&gt; to locate a Shrine Bauble that decays, and they need to quickly proceed with it to the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Remulos\"&gt;Shrine of Remulos&lt;/a&gt;. It may turn into a competition with other druids, and mental and physical dexterity are critical to success. The shrine serves as a lasting tribute to the preservation of nature and balance. By using the bauble here, it serves as a nod to the importance of this place within the Circle.\nThe second trial consists of creating the &lt;a href=\"%3APendant%20of%20the%20Sea%20Lion\"&gt;:Pendant of the Sea Lion&lt;/a&gt; from two halves. &lt;a href=\"Half%20Pendant%20of%20Aquatic%20Agility\"&gt;One half&lt;/a&gt; draws power from the agility of the sea lion aspect, gliding through water; &lt;a href=\"Half%20Pendant%20of%20Aquatic%20Endurance\"&gt;the other&lt;/a&gt; draws power from the incredible endurance of the sea lion aspect. Druids draw on both these traits equally to embody the aspect of their aquatic form. Each task in acquiring the pendant shows that both agility and endurance are necessary to act in harmony with what you desire to do underwater. Neither can exist without the other, and both cannot be done without your willingness to embrace the aspect of the sea lion. The student needs to remember these lessons well, and count on them after gaining the aquatic form. After completing the trial, the students deliver the pendant to their trainers who then teach the aquatic form.\nReputation and quests.\nMembers of the Cenarion Circle offer a large number of quests in the game. Moonglade includes three questlines for druids at level 10, 14 and 16, as well as higher-level quests for all &lt;a href=\"Player%20character\"&gt;characters&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dire%20Maul\"&gt;Dire Maul&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Hold\"&gt;Cenarion Hold&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Valor%27s%20Rest\"&gt;Valor's Rest&lt;/a&gt; serve as the quest hub for Silithus and both wings of &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, representatives of the Circle in &lt;a href=\"Desolace\"&gt;Desolace&lt;/a&gt; offer quests for &lt;a href=\"Maraudon\"&gt;Maraudon&lt;/a&gt;.\nExpedition into Outland.\nUpon the reopening of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, the Cenarion Circle dispatched an expeditionary force - joint night elf/tauren, much like the Circle itself - to explore the uncharted new world. Over time the Cenarion explorers grew more autonomous and became their own faction within Outland, separate and yet connected to the Cenarion Circle. This faction is known as the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Expedition\"&gt;Cenarion Expedition&lt;/a&gt;, which awards its own reputation apart from that granted by the Circle.\nRewards.\nWhen the Gates of Ahn'Qiraj open on your server, new NPCs give quests for class-specific weapons and armor. These include both &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Ahn%27Qiraj%20Quest%20Loot\"&gt;Ruins of Ahn'Qiraj Quest Loot&lt;/a&gt; and rewards from the &lt;a href=\"Field%20Duty\"&gt;Field Duty&lt;/a&gt; quest lines.\nNighthaven offers many unique vendors, including a special Dress Master NPC.\nThere is no one faction quartermaster for the Cenarion Circle. Instead, there are vendors focused on various professions:\nAdditionally, inside the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ruins of Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt;, if Andorov survives the event, he also sells a few limited-quantity recipes:\nIn the RPG.\nIts members are dedicated to protecting nature and restoring the damage done to it by malevolent forces.\nMost of this faction's members are either night elves or tauren. The Cenarion Circle, however, accepts men and women of any race; druids are members by definition, but other characters must prove themselves to the Cenarion Circle before becoming accepted. Fervently dedicated to protecting the wilderness, the operatives of the Cenarion Circle consider their duties above the petty wars and futile disputes of the Alliance, the Horde, and any other faction, race, family, or group. They are, after all, trying to save the world from those who would unwittingly destroy it; they allow no distractions."}

Players start at 0/3000 Neutral, except for &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s, who start at 2000/3000 neutral and will be Friendly after completing the early class quests at level 16.\nBefore \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;The Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;\" expansion, the usual way of gaining reputation was to run &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ruins of Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt; raids regularly to get access to reputation rewards and recipes. Since the expansion, however, Silithus and Ahn'Qiraj get much fewer visitors, since Outland gear is generally better and requires less effort. \nHowever, many people still like the old regions and instances. With &lt;a href=\"Patch%202.3\"&gt;Patch 2.3&lt;/a&gt;, the reputation gains for the Cenarion Circle have been greatly increased, to make it easier for new players who usually will not spend that much time in the old content.\nThere are various methods of gaining reputation: killing mobs belonging to the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight Hammer&lt;/a&gt; in Silithus, doing repeatable quests (both solo and group quests), non-repeatable quests and, of course, AQ10.\nAlso, with the release of 1.12, you can now gain Cenarion Circle reputation by participating in the World PvP in Silithus. Turning in one Silithyst Dust gives you 20 reputation points for Cenarion Circle.\nWith patch 3.0.2 and the Achievement system, the &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Cenarius\"&gt;Guardian of Cenarius&lt;/a&gt; title requires players to reach Exalted with both the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Expedition\"&gt;Cenarion Expedition&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe release of patch 4.0.x saw the removal of the repeatable quests involving the Twilight Cultist clothing sets and summoning Abyssal mobs. The Cultist sets still drop, but serve no purpose other than vendor trash, as they are not disenchantable. To replace the potential reputation loss, the patch saw the introduction of Cenarion Circle faction quests in Desolace, Western Plaguelands and other zones. \nReputation.\nThe fastest way to grind reputation at level 90 is to grind through all the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight Hammer&lt;/a&gt; cultists in &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;. Each one gives 10 reputation and drop &lt;a href=\"Encrypted%20Twilight%20Text\"&gt;Encrypted Twilight Text&lt;/a&gt;s, which are required for the repeatable quest &lt;a href=\"Encrypted%20Twilight%20Texts\"&gt;Encrypted Twilight Texts&lt;/a&gt;. It is possible to grind all the way through to in less than four hours doing this.\nNOTE: &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Prophet%20%28Silithus%29\"&gt;Twilight Prophets&lt;/a&gt; drop 7 - 10 &lt;a href=\"Encrypted%20Twilight%20Text\"&gt;Encrypted Twilight Text&lt;/a&gt;s.\nQuests: The Ruins of Ahn'Qiraj.\nSeveral quests are available in outside the AQ10 instance portal for class-specific armor sets. The sets consist of a ring, a cloak, and a weapon. The ring requires Honored reputation with Cenarion Circle, the cloak requires Revered and the weapon requires Exalted. See the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Ahn%27Qiraj%20Quest%20Loot\"&gt;Ruins of Ahn'Qiraj Quest Loot&lt;/a&gt; page for more info. There are no quests available to any class added after \"\".\nQuests: Field Duty.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Field%20Duty\"&gt;Field Duty&lt;/a&gt; quest chain gave substantial rewards (including epics at the end) from a series of quests introduced in Patch 1.9. These quests were not available until the Gates of Ahn'Qiraj opened and the 10-hour Opening Event had been completed. These quests were removed with the release of Cataclysm.\nNon-Repeatable Quests.\n&lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Eastern Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;:\n&lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;:\n&lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt;:\n&lt;a href=\"Moonglade\"&gt;Moonglade&lt;/a&gt;:\nLunar Festival.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Lunar%20Festival\"&gt;Lunar Festival&lt;/a&gt; there are additional quests to gain reputation."}

The area remains a hub for &lt;a href=\"druid%20trainer\"&gt;druid trainer&lt;/a&gt;s.\nBelow-ground, a secretive &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt; guild can be found if one knows where to look within the westernmost bough. Darnassus's &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s also come to the Cenarion Enclave to train in the easternmost tree, while the skill and means to ride &lt;a href=\"nightsaber\"&gt;nightsaber&lt;/a&gt;s can also be obtained at the foot of the Enclave tree.\nThe Cenarion Enclave is located in the northwest of the city, accessible from the &lt;a href=\"The%20Temple%20Gardens\"&gt;Temple Gardens&lt;/a&gt; to the south, &lt;a href=\"Craftsmen%27s%20Terrace\"&gt;Craftsmen's Terrace&lt;/a&gt; to the east, and the &lt;a href=\"Howling%20Oak\"&gt;Howling Oak&lt;/a&gt; to the north. Tall trees \u2014 oaks and ashes especially \u2014 lined the enclave. Each tree bore mystic runes shaped from the very bark. Within the circular grove, a handful of unique structures molded both from living wood and carefully-shaped stones represent the usual gathering place for convocations. The largest of these structures served as the residence of Fandral Staghelm.\nHistory.\nJust as the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Moon\"&gt;Temple of the Moon&lt;/a&gt; serves as the center of &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;ly activity in the city, so too has the Cenarion Enclave traditionally housed &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s. This sect was initially led by &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Archdruid Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt;, who himself resided in this portion of the city. Since then &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; returned to and once more took up the role of druidic leadership, though he can be found in the Temple of the Moon with his wife &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; rather than in the Cenarion Enclave.\nShortly before the &lt;a href=\"War%20Against%20the%20Nightmare\"&gt;War Against the Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Broll%20Bearmantle\"&gt;Broll Bearmantle&lt;/a&gt; secretly arrived here and stole the &lt;a href=\"Idol%20of%20Remulos\"&gt;Idol of Remulos&lt;/a&gt;. Later, &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; power defeated &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hamuul%20Runetotem\"&gt;Hamuul Runetotem&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Naralex\"&gt;Naralex&lt;/a&gt; and imprisoned them here. Not soon after, &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; arrived here to confront Fandral, finding and releasing the prisoners through a spell. Joined by other druids, Malfurion defeated a shadow that impersonated Fandral's long-dead son Valstann. That sent Fandral into a state of shock. Fandral's sanctum was ruined but Malfurion sensed something casted a spell and reshaped the sanctum revealing a portal to the Emerald Dream, secretly created by Fandral. Now, Alexstrasza resolved to defend it while Malfurion went to form a plan against the Emerald Nightmare. He entered a trance and gathered an army from various parts of Azeroth. When he was done and the army moved to the Dream, suddenly, Keeper Remulos teleported here and urged Malfurion to follow him into a certain location in the Nightmare. Broll and Hamuul remained in the Enclave coordinate the events and watch over the druid bodies.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Morthis%20Whisperwing\"&gt;Morthis Whisperwing&lt;/a&gt; was sent to scout the disastrous event and when he returned he met with Malfurion in the Enclave.\nAt the time of the campaign in &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; managed to recover an ancient, powerful, and dangerous &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; artifact known as the &lt;a href=\"%3ADivine%20Bell\"&gt;:Divine Bell&lt;/a&gt; from the continent. The Bell was subsequently taken to Darnassus for safe keeping, and was kept underground beneath the Cenarion Enclave. With the aid of &lt;a href=\"Aethas%20Sunreaver\"&gt;Aethas Sunreaver&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; would mount an infiltration of the city, and successfully steal the Bell from its vault. The repercussions of this event would eventually culminate in the infamous &lt;a href=\"Purge%20of%20Dalaran\"&gt;Purge of Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;."}

Additional Expedition outposts are located in &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Terokkar%20Forest\"&gt;Terokkar Forest&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Blade's Edge Mountains&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Druid organization &lt;a href=\"Druids%20for%20the%20Ethical%20and%20Humane%20Treatment%20of%20Animals\"&gt;D.E.H.T.A.&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; is also aligned with the Cenarion Expedition, and their quests give reputation with this faction.\nAt some point, the Cenarion Expedition requested help from the &lt;a href=\"Omenai\"&gt;Omenai&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Telhamat\"&gt;Temple of Telhamat&lt;/a&gt;, in order to study what happened in the region and help reverse any damage possible. &lt;a href=\"Amaan%20the%20Wise\"&gt;Amaan the Wise&lt;/a&gt; accepted and later sent the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s in support.\nReputation.\nNeutral to Honored.\nAs soon as you reach Level 62, head to &lt;a href=\"Zangarmarsh\"&gt;Zangarmarsh&lt;/a&gt; and look for Darkcrest and Bloodscale Naga (and their slaves) to grind. Run &lt;a href=\"Slave%20Pens\"&gt;Slave Pens&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Underbog\"&gt;Underbog&lt;/a&gt; whenever you can; a good instance run with a capable group will get you more reputation faster than soloing mobs outside the instance.\nAlternatively, at level 60, you can start turning in . Every time you complete a turn-in, &lt;a href=\"Lauranna%20Thar%27well\"&gt;Lauranna Thar'well&lt;/a&gt; will give you a . These packages have the chance to contain an , an item which begins a repeatable quest. Each Uncatalogued Species you hand in gives 500 reputation. Save these for later, as they continue to give reputation after reaching Honored. The more of these you can turn in, the more chance you will have of getting an Uncatalogued Species, which will make it a shorter grind to /. \nThis quest is no longer available once you reach Honored, so make the most of it while you can. Ideally, you will want to do this quest 36 times, turning in 360 Unidentified Plant Parts (last turn-in can be done at 5999/6000 ). You may even want to avoid &lt;a href=\"Slave%20Pens\"&gt;Slave Pens&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Underbog\"&gt;Underbog&lt;/a&gt; runs before you reach , to make sure you can have all the 36 turn-in, so that the chance of getting is maximized. It is possible to get as many as 7 or 8 if you are lucky. This can save you a few &lt;a href=\"Steamvault\"&gt;Steamvault&lt;/a&gt; reputation runs later. (Together with the other reputation quests, it is even possible to reach Revered without a single instance reputation run!)\nIf you are an herbalist, and interested in &lt;a href=\"Sporeggar\"&gt;Sporeggar&lt;/a&gt; faction, you may want to grind the Bog Lords which can be found in each of the corners of Zangarmarsh (Northeast, Southeast, Southwest). Their bodies can be \"picked\" by herbalists and often yield Unidentified Plant Parts, while every kill yields 15 reputation with &lt;a href=\"Sporeggar\"&gt;Sporeggar&lt;/a&gt;.\nBetween running &lt;a href=\"Slave%20Pens\"&gt;Slave Pens&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Underbog\"&gt;Underbog&lt;/a&gt; and handing in Unidentified Plant Parts, it is very easy to reach Honored.\nHonored to Exalted.\nOnce you are running Slave Pens and most of Underbog on normal mode will no longer grant reputation.\nNow is the best time to do the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Expedition%20quests\"&gt;Cenarion Expedition quests&lt;/a&gt;. There are quests in &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zangarmarsh\"&gt;Zangarmarsh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Terokkar%20Forest\"&gt;Terokkar Forest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Blade's Edge Mountains&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Netherstorm\"&gt;Netherstorm&lt;/a&gt;. \nIt is also the time to turn in any &lt;a href=\"Uncatalogued%20Species\"&gt;Uncatalogued Species&lt;/a&gt; you have found. Doing this should get you part of the way into Honored.\nApart from quests and Uncatalogued Species, you have multiple options for reaching :\nRewards.\nEarly rewards include a decent leather chest with agility and stamina, a one-handed healer's mace, and a melee staff with stamina and run speed bonus, all available at with Cenarion Expedition and usable at level 62. These rewards provide a good reason to grind to Honored early. Additionally, at , players can purchase , one of the best pre-Karazhan tanking necklaces, as well as , one of the best pre-Karazhan cloth healing helms.\nAmong the notable rewards at is , a high-stamina ring with solid &lt;a href=\"spell%20hit\"&gt;spell hit&lt;/a&gt; appropriate for all dps casters, as well as , a level-70 two-handed mace with armor and damage in feral forms. The armor bonus makes the mace an excellent tank-weapon replacement for and . High-level crafting patterns focus on Nature Resistance.\nWhen you hit exalted with Cenarion Expedition, you will be able to buy a flying mount for after discount.\n&lt;a href=\"Arcanist%20Xorith\"&gt;Arcanist Xorith&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Haldor%20the%20Compulsive\"&gt;Haldor the Compulsive&lt;/a&gt; will sell specialized &lt;a href=\"Flasks\"&gt;Flasks&lt;/a&gt; only usable in raid zones to players who are exalted with Cenarion Expedition, the Sha'tar and the respective faction (Scryer or Aldor).

The town was originally founded by the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt;, who came to &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; to study the local flora and fauna. Their presence became so large in outland, that the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Expedition\"&gt;Cenarion Expedition&lt;/a&gt; was formed as Outland's sub-faction of the Cenarion Circle.\nThe city is fully functional, with a mailbox, an inn, a general goods vendor, trade goods vendor, armor repair, cooking and fishing trainers, as well as many quests. However, Cenarion Refuge does NOT have a flight master; Alliance players can fly to nearby &lt;a href=\"Telredor\"&gt;Telredor&lt;/a&gt; and Horde players to &lt;a href=\"Swamprat%20Post\"&gt;Swamprat Post&lt;/a&gt; instead. Players start out at neutral with the Expedition, but reputation gains are very generous. There is a repeatable turn-in quest to help players progress from neutral through honored by turning in &lt;a href=\"Unidentified%20Plant%20Parts\"&gt;Unidentified Plant Parts&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Lauranna%20Thar%27well\"&gt;Lauranna Thar'well&lt;/a&gt;.\nNotes.\nIf traveling to the town and below 70, be warned that the guards may not always protect you. Specifically, ranged attacks can be performed further away than the guards' aggro range. For example, hunters can shoot you from far enough away that they will not aggro the guards. This occurs frequently in front of the inn. Also a popular method for killing lower levels is to have a priest enter combat and fear away all the guards, leaving lower levels relatively defenseless at the hands of level 70's."}

Prior to this patch, hippogryphs would simply hover at ground level (with a speed reduction as with all flying mounts), much like &lt;a href=\"nether%20ray%20%28mount%29\"&gt;nether ray&lt;/a&gt;s."}

Worshipped by the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; since their early history, the Son of &lt;a href=\"Malorne\"&gt;Malorne&lt;/a&gt; taught the elves to be druids and embrace nature, as opposed to the arcane-inclined &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; and the religiously-inclined &lt;a href=\"Sisterhood%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Sisterhood of Elune&lt;/a&gt;. He served as a commander of the forces of Kalimdor in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; after the death of his father. He continued serving as a teacher and protector of the elves and their forests for 10,000 years until he was killed by the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ically corrupted orcs led by &lt;a href=\"Grom%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grom Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;.\nSeveral years later, he was brought back into the world with the awakened &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt; through the &lt;a href=\"Gates%20of%20Sothann\"&gt;Gates of Sothann&lt;/a&gt; to aid in defending &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; and the resurgent &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;. He now serves as a leader of the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nBirth and children.\nAs the son of &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;, goddess of the moon, and the demigod &lt;a href=\"Malorne\"&gt;Malorne&lt;/a&gt;, Cenarius inherited a deep connection to the world of Azeroth and its creatures. The &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; have &lt;a href=\"tauren%20mythology\"&gt;a myth&lt;/a&gt; that purportedly relates the story of Cenarius's conception. Elune birthed Cenarius, but gave him up to Malorne because Cenarius was more a creature of the mortal world and could not be with her. When Cenarius's birth sent a ripple through the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt; took an immediate interest in him. Guiding him into the Dream, she taught him much of its secrets and became a foster mother of sorts to him. In fact, the affectionate understanding that she and Cenarius shared has led many of Azeroth's elder races to mistake the pair for mother and son. Malorne knew that he could not properly care for his son, but Ysera took Cenarius as her own. Cenarius grew to love the lush forests of Ysera's verdant realm. He could often be found treading its infinite dreamways, either watching over Azeroth and its creatures, or simply hoping for all that they might yet become.\nThe demigod grew into a powerful and cunning being, the union of the heavens and the earth. He has many powers over nature, which he inherited from his father Malorne. He fathered many children. His daughters are known as the fey &lt;a href=\"dryad\"&gt;dryad&lt;/a&gt;s and his sons as the wise &lt;a href=\"Keeper%20of%20the%20Grove\"&gt;Keepers of the Grove&lt;/a&gt;, or simply \"keepers\", including &lt;a href=\"Keeper%20Remulos\"&gt;Keeper Remulos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ordanus\"&gt;Ordanus&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Zaetar\"&gt;Zaetar&lt;/a&gt;. According to one night elf legend, the &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt; were Cenarius's bastard children, but they were actually descended from Cenarius's son Zaetar and &lt;a href=\"Princess%20Theradras\"&gt;Princess Theradras&lt;/a&gt;, making Cenarius their grandfather. According to &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"magnataur\"&gt;magnataur&lt;/a&gt; are also descended from Cenarius. Cenarius claims kinship with the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; as well, but has never said in what way.\nThe tauren.\nAt some point during the height of the &lt;a href=\"mogu%20empire\"&gt;mogu empire&lt;/a&gt;, an intelligent bovine race known as the &lt;a href=\"yaungol\"&gt;yaungol&lt;/a&gt; dwelled with Cenarius on the plains of central &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor%20%28landmass%29\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, the yaungol grew weary of having to share their hunting grounds with the &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s and migrated south, despite Cenarius's wishes. In the south, the yaungol were enslaved by the &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; until they joined several other slave races in &lt;a href=\"Pandaren%20revolution\"&gt;overthrowing&lt;/a&gt; their oppressors. After the revolution, many yaungol migrated back north, and one group, known thereafter as the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt;, reunited with Cenarius and rediscovered their lost traditions. Those who studied with Cenarius learned the &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;ic magic of the natural world. &lt;a href=\"Xarantaur\"&gt;Xarantaur&lt;/a&gt; was presumably taught by Cenarius during this time.\nThe night elves.\nWhen the night elves first developed around the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;, their curiosity led them to meet and befriend a number of powerful entities, including Cenarius, who claimed kinship with the night elves, though he never explained in what way. The demigod became fond of the night elves, and he spent a great deal of time teaching them about the natural world in &lt;a href=\"Val%27sharah\"&gt;Val'sharah&lt;/a&gt;, his home and the birthplace of night elven druidism. Under his guidance, the night elves developed a strong empathy for the living forests of ancient Kalimdor and reveled in the harmonious balance of nature. Some night elves became so transformed by the teachings of the demigod that they never left his realm, choosing to remain by Cenarius' side as his defenders. These few would cease to be elves and became woodland guardians physically altered forever. Over time, however, the night elves were increasingly drawn to the cosmic energies of the Well. Furthermore, the rapid growth of the night elf civilization led inevitably to the creation of new buildings and roads. Large tracts of forest vanished. Tranquil woodlands turned into sprawling cities, and great trees were warped and twisted into shapes that would better serve as night elf dwellings. The night elves were losing touch with nature.\nThe number of night elves pursuing their studies with the demigod dwindled, and Cenarius was grieved to realize that all his work had been for naught. Reluctantly he departed night elf lands. He resolved that he would respect their choice, however much he disagreed with it. From that point forward, Cenarius retreated into the wilds of the world and avoided most sentient races until they came to doubt his very existence.\nThe first druid.\nMillennia later, &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; came across several legends that referenced the mysterious Cenarius. Malfurion had always had great reverence for the natural world, although the night elves as a race had long since abandoned any interest in such matters. He shared these legends with his twin brother, &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, and their mutual friend, &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;. The three night elves decided that it would be an exciting adventure to search for Cenarius, though in truth they no more believed in the demigod than the rest of their people did. It wasn't long before scattered plants and animals of Azeroth brought tidings of these three night elves to Cenarius. Surprised and intrigued, Cenarius located the night elves and looked into their hearts. He saw great promise in Malfurion, a promise that made up Cenarius's mind.\nThe laughing trio was shocked into silence when Cenarius stepped out of a shadowed thicket. He introduced himself and offered to teach them the druidic arts. They accepted eagerly and began to train in Val'sharah. Malfurion proved a quick and talented student, but his brother was clumsy and quickly grew impatient. For her part, Tyrande was already a novice in the &lt;a href=\"Sisterhood%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Sisterhood of Elune&lt;/a&gt; and so had dedicated herself to the goddess above all others. Cenarius knew that Malfurion alone would go on to become a druid. Under the tutelage of wise Cenarius, Malfurion would become the first mortal druid on Azeroth.\nInvasion of the Burning Legion.\nMalfurion made significant progress in his studies before he was assailed by a disturbing vision. He watched helplessly as the Highborne inside the palace abused the Well of Eternity's magics. The vision gave him the strong conviction that &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt; and her high-ranking spellcasters would cause a catastrophe unless someone intervened. Malfurion brought his concerns to Cenarius, at the time dwelling in the sacred &lt;a href=\"Moonglade\"&gt;Moonglade&lt;/a&gt;, who was greatly worried. Even so, the night elves realized what was happening too late. &lt;a href=\"Demon\"&gt;Demon&lt;/a&gt;s poured out of the royal palace and began to slaughter everything in their path. The &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; had begun. As the crisis unfolded, Cenarius taught Malfurion all he could and then sought out the other demigods of Azeroth. They were unaccustomed to the idea of working together; as a result, it took much persuasion from Cenarius before they finally agreed on a course of action. They rode to the battlefront and found that the war was well underway. Quickly Cenarius assessed the situation and then led the other demigods to the leader of the night elf army, Captain &lt;a href=\"Jarod%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Jarod Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;. The astonished captain readily accepted the demigods' offer of assistance, and the tide of battle seemed to shift.\nDuring a battle in &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt;, Cenarius granted his blessing to &lt;a href=\"Huln%20Highmountain\"&gt;Huln Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; so that &lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20tauren\"&gt;his people&lt;/a&gt; would forever have his favor. This transformed Huln and his people's horns into the Horns of Eche'ro, moose-like antlers that would forever mark them as blessed.\nMalorne's death and the Great Sundering.\nReacting to the new and powerful threat, the vast demonic army refocused its attacks on the demigods, who were soon overwhelmed. Cenarius was badly wounded and completely surrounded by the time &lt;a href=\"Malorne\"&gt;Malorne&lt;/a&gt; charged up and drove back his son's attackers with a few sweeps of his massive antlers. The night elves scrambled into action, pulling the unconscious Cenarius to safety. Malorne easily held the demons off for a time. Then &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; came forth and engaged the giant stag in single combat, ultimately snapping Malorne's neck. Malfurion was furious and grieved; he called roots out of the ground to attack the demon lord. As the plants tightened their stranglehold on the demon's massive form, Archimonde was forced to teleport away in order to escape.\nYsera was sad to learn of Malorne's death, and her dragonflight carefully helped Cenarius enter the Emerald Dream, where the green dragons ministered to his injuries. Despite his sorrow and the lingering effects of his wounds, Cenarius emerged from the Dream not long after the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, for he could feel the land cry out for healing. To his horror, he discovered that Illidan Stormrage had created a &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity%20%28Hyjal%29\"&gt;second Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;. Jarod Shadowsong left Illidan's punishment to Malfurion, who felt it would be the height of folly to leave Illidan free to continue his reckless pursuit of power. Thus, with Cenarius's help, Malfurion sealed Illidan within a vast underground barrow prison, there to remain chained and powerless until the end of time.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Dreamweavers\"&gt;Dreamweavers&lt;/a&gt; are powerful druids in Val'sharah who grew under Cenarius's tutelage after the Great Sundering.\nCurse of the Worgen.\nWhen Malfurion discovered the lupine &lt;a href=\"Pack%20Form\"&gt;Pack Form&lt;/a&gt;, the blind rage of &lt;a href=\"Goldrinn\"&gt;Goldrinn&lt;/a&gt; overwhelmed him and he attacked Cenarius. Cenarius sealed Malfurion away underneath &lt;a href=\"Daral%27nir\"&gt;Daral'nir&lt;/a&gt; within the Emerald Dream where his rage was calmed. Malfurion then banned all druids from using the Pack Form.\nLater, when &lt;a href=\"Ralaar%20Fangfire\"&gt;Ralaar Fangfire&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Scythe\"&gt;Druids of the Scythe&lt;/a&gt; became the first &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt;, Malfurion asked Cenarius for advice on how to handle the fallen druids. Cenarius responded that Malfurion was a shan'do himself now, and couldn't always ask Cenarius for answers. With Cenarius's blessing, Malfurion and a number of other druids met in &lt;a href=\"Moonglade\"&gt;Moonglade&lt;/a&gt; and established the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; to face Alpha Prime.\nSeclusion of the night elves.\nTyrande Whisperwind, now high priestess of Elune, implemented sweeping changes throughout night elf society. She organized a new all-female army, the &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt;, and decreed that it would be directed by the &lt;a href=\"Sisterhood%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Sisterhood of Elune&lt;/a&gt;. Nobility and sorcery were now considered the relics of a decadent and shameful past. Nevertheless, a group of &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Dath%27Remar%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Dath'Remar Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; refused to give up practicing arcane magic. After discussing the matter at length, Tyrande and Malfurion made the difficult decision to exile their defiant kin. In the wake of the group's departure, the remaining night elves deliberately withdrew from the rest of the world. A veil of mist descended upon their entire continent, shrouding its presence from passing sailors.\nMeanwhile, Cenarius remained nearby in the &lt;a href=\"Moonglade\"&gt;Moonglade&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;. His male offspring, the keepers of the grove, kept close watch on the night elves and regularly helped the Sentinels maintain peace in the land. Even Cenarius's shy female descendants, the &lt;a href=\"dryad\"&gt;dryad&lt;/a&gt;s, appeared in the open with increasing frequency. Cenarius taught the night elves the ways of the forest, and druidism became widespread among the males. Following the druids' entrance into the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; Cenarius helped Tyrande and the &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;s during the &lt;a href=\"Long%20Vigil\"&gt;Long Vigil&lt;/a&gt;. He and his children, the Keepers of the Grove and their dryad sisters, helped to patrol the woodlands from the &lt;a href=\"Moonglade\"&gt;Moonglade&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe shared the duty of defending &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt; and the second Well of Eternity with the night elves.\nThe invasion of Kalimdor.\nTime passed, and a new race arrived on Azeroth: the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s, who originated on the planet &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;. Under the deception of demons, the orcs had changed from a shamanic society into the bloodthirsty &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. They waged war upon the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; and killed countless other creatures during the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;s. Cenarius and the night elves did not emerge from their seclusion to intervene, for they knew nothing of any events that occurred outside &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. The Second War ended badly for the orcs, and the Horde was shattered. Just before the Third War, a new orc warchief emerged: &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, who reformed the Horde and led his people across the sea to establish their own homeland on Kalimdor.\nDeath by the hands of the orcs.\nThe orcs, who had fled the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; had received a vision, landed on Kalimdor. Thrall, who had encountered &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grommash Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; battle a group of humans, ordered the orc chieftain and his &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20clan\"&gt;clan&lt;/a&gt; to gather wood for the construction of an outpost. Grom reluctantly complied and headed deeper into Ashenvale to begin cutting swathes of forest and killing the local night elves who attempted to protect the land.\nDespite no longer having warlocks in their ranks, the orcs still carried within them the unmistakable mark of the Burning Legion upon their very souls. Cenarius, as a being so attuned to nature that he can sense the slightest corruption, assumed that the orcs in Ashenvale were scouts of the Legion. Cenarius became certain that the orcs had returned to their warlike ways. He led a group of night elves and treants against a large group of the orcish intruders.\nGrom and the Warsong clan were overpowered by the demigod's powers, their weapons having little to no effect against him. When all hope seemed lost, several trolls sensed a mystical fountain nearby which would give them the power necessary to do so. After dispatching the local inhabitants along the way, Grom and his clan drank from the fountain, despite what Thrall had taught them. The fountain had been previously tainted by Mannoroth and led to the reestablishment of their connection to the potent fel magics that first bound them to the Legion.\nOvercome with supernatural hate and rage, Grom and his warriors retaliated against Cenarius and his allies. The strength of the demon blood mixed in the fountain allowed Grom and his orcs to fight Cenarius on equal footing, and they eventually killed the demigod after an intense battle. Mannoroth appeared before Hellscream and his troops moments later and enslaved them, since by drinking his blood they had made themselves susceptible to his control once again. The night elves and many other creatures, including Ysera, mourned Cenarius's tragic death. The death of Cenarius at the hands of the orcs, demon-tainted or not, enraged the night elves, cementing their view of the savage, green-skinned (although red-skinned at that moment) creatures as their enemies. When Malfurion considered the possibility of allying with Jaina's and Thrall's forces, observing that they fought against the undead as well, Tyrande vehemently rejected the idea and cited the fact Cenarius had been killed by them as proof that they were the enemy.\nSpirit within the Emerald Dream and the Shadowlands.\nCenarius's spirit returned to the Emerald Dream after his defeat, and within it, he was able to sense the events of the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Battle of Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;. Cenarius saw the orcs defend Nordrassil hand-in-hand with the night elves and humans, and developed a growing respect for them. Cenarius saw that, despite their fel taint, they were allies against the Legion and defenders of the land (noting Garrosh\u2019s father\u2019s victory over his former enslaver in particular), so when both he and the Horde returned to Hyjal to defend the World Tree once again, Cenarius saw the orcs and their allies in a new light.\nA clue to Cenarius's activities came from a conversation his son &lt;a href=\"Keeper%20Remulos\"&gt;Remulos&lt;/a&gt; had with the spirit of &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; when players completed a particular quest. It explained that Cenarius was helping Malfurion fight against the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; that was disrupting the Emerald Dream, causing the corruption of &lt;a href=\"The%20Four%20Dragons\"&gt;The Four Dragons&lt;/a&gt; among other things.\nAfter his death, Cenarius recovered in &lt;a href=\"Ardenweald\"&gt;Ardenweald&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt; before returning to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20Deathwing\"&gt;war against Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; and his allies on &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, Cenarius was summoned from the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; through a portal at the &lt;a href=\"Gates%20of%20Sothann\"&gt;Gates of Sothann&lt;/a&gt; to fight the forces of the returned Firelord, &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt;. He assists in defeating Ragnaros along with an adventurer, Malfurion, and Hamuul.\nAssault on the Molten Front.\nCenarius appears at the &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary%20of%20Malorne\"&gt;Sanctuary of Malorne&lt;/a&gt; if the adventurer has completed the entire Hyjal storyline, otherwise he will not appear. Along with &lt;a href=\"Hamuul%20Runetotem\"&gt;Hamuul Runetotem&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, he helps defeat &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros%20%28Firelands%20tactics%29\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Firelands%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Firelands&lt;/a&gt; on heroic difficulty.\nLegion.\nCenarius lies unwaking at the &lt;a href=\"Grove%20of%20Cenarius\"&gt;Grove of Cenarius&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Val%27sharah\"&gt;Val'sharah&lt;/a&gt;, afflicted by the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Tears%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Tears of Elune&lt;/a&gt; can save him, but they are stolen from the nearby temple by &lt;a href=\"Xavius\"&gt;Xavius&lt;/a&gt; before they can be used. As Cenarius becomes corrupted by the Emerald Nightmare, an enraged Malfurion pursues Xavius into the depths of the forest.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Malorne\"&gt;Malorne&lt;/a&gt; becomes trapped in an &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; recreation of his death at the hands of &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt;, a figment of Cenarius is seen battling demons during the War of the Ancients.\nCenarius is a boss in the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare raid&lt;/a&gt;, where he believes he is defending the forests from the Nightmare's incursion and does not wish to fail his father, Malorne. With Malfurion aiding in the battle, they are able to get through to Cenarius and, while he is defeated, he is only unconscious and not killed. As Malfurion focuses all his power into cleansing his teacher, the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s journey to the &lt;a href=\"Rift%20of%20Aln\"&gt;Rift of Aln&lt;/a&gt; to confront Xavius. After Xavius is defeated, the purified Cenarius is found within the Emerald Dream alongside the spirits of those deceased that the Nightmare had corrupted, welcoming the adventurers into the Emerald Dream and thanking them for cleansing the Nightmare.\nLegionfall.\nCenarius and &lt;a href=\"Jarod%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Jarod Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; lead &lt;a href=\"Assault%20on%20Val%27sharah\"&gt;the defense&lt;/a&gt; of Val'sharah during the &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Assaults\"&gt;Legion Assaults&lt;/a&gt;.\nDragonflight.\nYears later, when the &lt;a href=\"Primal%20Incarnate\"&gt;Primal Incarnate&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Fyrakk\"&gt;Fyrakk&lt;/a&gt; assaulted the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream%20%28zone%29\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;, Cenarius traveled there and was seen in the &lt;a href=\"Central%20Encampment\"&gt;Central Encampment&lt;/a&gt; beneath &lt;a href=\"Amirdrassil\"&gt;Amirdrassil&lt;/a&gt;.\nChildren.\nThe descendant of the &lt;a href=\"demigod\"&gt;demigod&lt;/a&gt; Cenarius have quadruped bodies with &lt;a href=\"humanoid\"&gt;humanoid&lt;/a&gt; torsos. They are known as the children or the ilk of Cenarius.\nAppearance.\nStanding tall above many at well over ten feet of height, the Lord of the Forest resembles in appearance a cross between a vigorous &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; and a magnificent stag. Cenarius' upper body is broad and muscular, by the dark skin tinted in the emerald hues of the wilds and arms that end in gnarled talons of aged wood, whilst his lower half vaunts four nimble hooves that move with the swiftness of the wind. From his head flows a thick moss-green mane, crowned by a pair of giant, glorious antlers that shade over his eyes of pure gold and his stern, yet fatherly visage. From it grows a long, rich beard, endowed by living leaves and twigs.\nHis great voice is like the thunder and his booming laughter inspires joy in the natural world around him.\nHowever, Cenarius' appearance differs in a number of artworks and models: In the \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft%20Trading%20Card%20Game\"&gt;World of Warcraft Trading Card Game&lt;/a&gt;\" he is shown as having no beard, with black hair, green eyes, tattoos on his chest and antlers that vary between those of an elk and some that vaguely resemble those of a stag. This appearance is largely consistent with his depictions in the \"&lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20the%20Worgen\"&gt;Curse of the Worgen&lt;/a&gt;\" comics and \",\" even down to the changing shapes of his antlers between images in the same source material. The latter also portrays Cenarius with pale blue eyes and a black beard during the events of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;. In his &lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt; models, he was originally shown as having golden eyes and no beard in &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, while in &lt;a href=\"Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt; he was updated to have one, though he has also gained new markings on his face, cyan eyes and a horse tail.\nDespite these designs repeatedly portraying Cenarius as black-haired through the years, in his hair and beard are shown as turquoise instead.\nIn the RPG.\nCenarius's home was originally the &lt;a href=\"Stormrage%20Barrow%20Dens\"&gt;Barrow Dens&lt;/a&gt; in the north-eastern corner of the &lt;a href=\"Moonglade\"&gt;Moonglade&lt;/a&gt;. The giant creature's body resembles a cross between the lower portion of an elk and the upper torso of male night elf. Standing perfectly motionless on four heavily muscled legs, the creature exudes an air of serene confidence. Its body glows with a soothing green light that strangely contrasts with the stern look on its face.\nCenarius's children are literally the offspring of the &lt;a href=\"demigod\"&gt;demigod&lt;/a&gt; Cenarius. &lt;a href=\"Centaur\"&gt;Centaur&lt;/a&gt;s are his bastard children, while &lt;a href=\"dryad\"&gt;dryad&lt;/a&gt;s are his daughters and &lt;a href=\"keeper%20of%20the%20grove\"&gt;keepers of the grove&lt;/a&gt; are his sons. They share the culture of the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;, although most live apart from the kaldorei as wardens of nature. Cenarius's bastard children have upper bodies closer to a &lt;a href=\"humanoid\"&gt;humanoid&lt;/a&gt; and lower bodies more like a &lt;a href=\"horse\"&gt;horse&lt;/a&gt;, while Cenarius' favored children are similar except they have an upper torso more similar to night elves and a lower body more like a &lt;a href=\"deer\"&gt;deer&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"stag\"&gt;stag&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuotes.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nLegion.\nYour triumph restores the Dream and safeguards your world. The allies of Xavius will never relent, but this road, at least, is closed to them.\nDragonflight.\nWelcome to the Dream, champion.\nIn Hearthstone.\nCenarius appears as for the druid class in \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\". His flavor text reads: \"Yes, he's a demigod. No, he doesn't need to wear a shirt.\"\nIn the TCG.\n&lt;a href=\"Cenarius%2C%20Lord%20of%20the%20Forest\"&gt;Cenarius, Lord of the Forest&lt;/a&gt; appears as a monster hero and a druid demigod.\nOther unique cards referencing Cenarius include &lt;a href=\"Arisella%2C%20Daughter%20of%20Cenarius\"&gt;Arisella, Daughter of Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sumi%27jin%2C%20Guardian%20of%20Cenarius\"&gt;Sumi'jin, Guardian of Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Will%20of%20Cenarius\"&gt;Will of Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;.\nCenarius is also mentioned in the quotes of Arisella, &lt;a href=\"Kanga%20the%20Primal\"&gt;Kanga the Primal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arturius%20Hathrow\"&gt;Arturius Hathrow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Laetho%20Moonbranch\"&gt;Laetho Moonbranch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Renshol%2C%20Herald%20of%20Nature\"&gt;Renshol, Herald of Nature&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Savina%20Greysky\"&gt;Savina Greysky&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stargazer%20Ronal\"&gt;Stargazer Ronal&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Blessing%20of%20Cenarius%20%28Scourgewar%29\"&gt;Blessing of Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpeculation.\nIn the \"Well of Eternity\" novel, it is said that in ancient times, &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; who met Cenarius were so transformed by the demigod's teachings that they chose to remain by his side. These disciples ceased to be elves and became woodland guardians physically altered forever. Though no specific mention is made of what form these elves took, by considering the physical likeness between the night elves and Cenarius' children, it may be theorized that these followers became the first &lt;a href=\"Keeper%20of%20the%20grove\"&gt;keepers of the grove&lt;/a&gt; and the first &lt;a href=\"dryad\"&gt;dryad&lt;/a&gt;s.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

{"id": "33075", "revid": "39299307", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=33075", "title": "Centaur", "text": "The centaur (sometimes pluralized as centaurs) are a warlike &lt;a href=\"humanoid\"&gt;humanoid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"race\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;-like upper bodies and the lower bodies of &lt;a href=\"horse\"&gt;horse&lt;/a&gt;s. Two discrete centaur civilizations exist. The first, the &lt;a href=\"Maruuk%20Centaur\"&gt;Maruuk Centaur&lt;/a&gt;, date back to before the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; and rule the &lt;a href=\"Ohn%27ahran%20Plains\"&gt;Ohn'ahran Plains&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;, where they worship the wind god &lt;a href=\"Ohn%27ahra\"&gt;Ohn'ahra&lt;/a&gt; and hunt the wild game of the region. Although split into many different &lt;a href=\"clan\"&gt;clan&lt;/a&gt;s ruled by various &lt;a href=\"khan\"&gt;khan&lt;/a&gt;s, they share a single culture. The Maruuk's ancestors forged a pact with the &lt;a href=\"green%20dragonflight\"&gt;green dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, but were cut off from the rest of the world when the Dragon Isles were hidden after the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;.\nMillennia later, a separate, more cruel and primitive centaur civilization was born on &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; from the union of &lt;a href=\"Zaetar\"&gt;Zaetar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Theradras\"&gt;Theradras&lt;/a&gt;. These centaur roam the plains of &lt;a href=\"Central%20Kalimdor\"&gt;Central Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; (primarily &lt;a href=\"Desolace\"&gt;Desolace&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt;) and are the mortal enemies of the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt;, whom they hunted for centuries until the arrival of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Although their clans have historically warred among themselves, Horde and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; efforts to unite the tribes against &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Blade%20clan\"&gt;common foes&lt;/a&gt; have met with some success.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nDragon Isles.\nThe earliest known centaur lived on &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor%20%28landmass%29\"&gt;ancient Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; prior to the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;. Their origin has not been explained.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; invaded &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, the ancient centaur clans fought and died until the hero &lt;a href=\"Maruuk\"&gt;Maruuk&lt;/a&gt; emerged and slaughtered the invaders. However, the other clan leaders feared Maruuk's strength and betrayed him, leading to him and his partner &lt;a href=\"Teera\"&gt;Teera&lt;/a&gt; rejecting the clans and setting out across Kalimdor in search of a new home. Many centaur were inspired by their honor and followed them, forming a new clan. &lt;a href=\"Ohn%27ahra\"&gt;Ohn'ahra&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Wild%20God\"&gt;Wild God&lt;/a&gt; of the Wind, guided the centaur on their journey until, after months of wandering, they reached what is now the &lt;a href=\"Ohn%27ahran%20Plains\"&gt;Ohn'ahran Plains&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;. Maruuk died, and his people renamed themselves the &lt;a href=\"Maruuk%20Centaur\"&gt;Maruuk centaur&lt;/a&gt; in his honor.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Gardens\"&gt;Emerald Gardens&lt;/a&gt; bordering the plains were already inhabited by the &lt;a href=\"green%20dragonflight\"&gt;green dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, who were initially hostile toward their new neighbors and fought with the centaur over territory. Teera\u2014who had taken up leadership of the Maruuk\u2014met the dragons' leader &lt;a href=\"Merithra\"&gt;Merithra&lt;/a&gt; in battle, but they soon realized that they were evenly matched and instead allied with each other against hostile &lt;a href=\"proto-dragon\"&gt;proto-dragon&lt;/a&gt;s that threatened both of their peoples. Teera and Merithra then made a pact, promising that the Maruuk and the dragons would stay out of each others' way but come to the aid of the other in times of need, a vow symbolized by the &lt;a href=\"Horn%20of%20Drusahl\"&gt;Horn of Drusahl&lt;/a&gt;. Afterward, the centaur hunted the plains while the dragons tended the gardens. The green dragons left the Isles after the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, leaving the Maruuk to develop their culture in isolation.\nIt is presumed that the other centaur clans that refused to follow Maruuk to the Dragon Isles had perished.\nKalimdor.\nMillennia after the Sundering, a separate centaur civilization arose on &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; as a result of the relationship between &lt;a href=\"Zaetar\"&gt;Zaetar&lt;/a&gt;, son of the &lt;a href=\"Wild%20God\"&gt;Wild God&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Theradras\"&gt;Princess Theradras&lt;/a&gt;, daughter of the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Lord\"&gt;Elemental Lord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Therazane\"&gt;Therazane&lt;/a&gt;. 1,100 years &lt;a href=\"BDP\"&gt;BDP&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; accidentally awakened Theradras from her slumber beneath the plains of &lt;a href=\"Desolace\"&gt;Mashan'she&lt;/a&gt; in western Kalimdor. She immediately drained Mashan'she's life energies to restore her power, turning the region into a barren desert later called &lt;a href=\"Desolace\"&gt;Desolace&lt;/a&gt;. Zaetar emerged from the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; to investigate this immense loss of life, but when he encountered Theradras, he fell in love with her and became her mate. From their forbidden union, the centaur of Kalimdor were born. As such, the race has shared ancestry with other descendants of Cenarius and have been called the \"cursed cousins\" of &lt;a href=\"dryad\"&gt;dryad&lt;/a&gt;s. The first of Zaetar and Theradras' children were &lt;a href=\"Kolk\"&gt;Kolk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gelk\"&gt;Gelk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Magra\"&gt;Magra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maraudos\"&gt;Maraudos&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Veng\"&gt;Veng&lt;/a&gt;, who became the first five &lt;a href=\"khan\"&gt;khan&lt;/a&gt;s. The &lt;a href=\"%3ACloven%20Hoof\"&gt;:Cloven Hoof&lt;/a&gt; artifact is said to come from the time of the centaur's creation.\nBecause of the unnaturalness of their parents' relationship, the centaur were born cursed, misshapen, and hateful. Upon seeing his children, Zaetar immediately realized his sin. He tried to connect with his offspring, but the centaur saw the disgust in their father's eyes. This drove them into a blind rage, and they lashed out and murdered him. A heartbroken Theradras harshly chastised them for their actions. Realizing that they had wounded their beloved mother, the centaur begged for forgiveness and promised to always revere their late father. Theradras entombed Zaetar's spirit in her lair, which the centaur named &lt;a href=\"Maraudon\"&gt;Maraudon&lt;/a&gt; and would forever treat as holy ground. The centaur quickly proliferated and spread out across Kalimdor, driving the tauren of Desolace from their homes and igniting a long and dark period of war between the two races. The centaur essentially had sole control of Desolace after the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; left the region.\nRivalry with the tauren.\nFor over a thousand years, the centaur and tauren were at war. &lt;a href=\"Tauren%20mythology\"&gt;Tauren mythology&lt;/a&gt; tells of how the centaur emerged like a plague from the \"black lands of the west\" and pushed the tauren out of their ancestral home of &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt;, forcing them to forever roam the plains of the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt; as nomads. The centaur ceaselessly terrorized central Kalimdor by raiding the settlements of other indigenous peoples, such as the &lt;a href=\"quilboar\"&gt;quilboar&lt;/a&gt;. They hunted the tauren for sport and launched intermittent attacks on the latter race. This took a heavy toll on both sides, as the tauren made the centaur pay for every unprovoked attack. However, the tauren had no love for war and always opted to find a new home rather than throw their lives away whenever the horse-men appeared. As such, they lived in a constant state of upheaval, and a year of peace was always followed by a year of war.\nBy the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the centaur were threatening to drive the tauren to extinction. The tauren were saved by the arrival of the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;ish &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, as the tauren chieftain &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Bloodhoof%20tribe\"&gt;Bloodhoof tribe&lt;/a&gt; befriended the Horde's &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;. Their two peoples joined forces and their combined power crashed down on the centaur warbands, sending the horse-men limping out of the Barrens in defeat. This allowed the tauren to permanently settle in Mulgore, ending their existence as nomads. Most of the centaur retreated to their homeland of Desolace. The Horde harshly punished any centaur who defied their borders, which kept them in check for several years with some exceptions: during the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Durotar\"&gt;invasion of Durotar&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Kolkar%20clan\"&gt;Kolkar clan&lt;/a&gt; enslaved an orc village in &lt;a href=\"Dustwallow%20Marsh\"&gt;Dustwallow Marsh&lt;/a&gt;, while another group led by the &lt;a href=\"khan\"&gt;khan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Khiragg\"&gt;Khiragg&lt;/a&gt; threatened the tauren in Mulgore and kidnapped Cairne's son &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine&lt;/a&gt; until he was rescued by &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nThe respite created by the Horde's defeat of the centaur didn't last long. &lt;a href=\"Theradras\"&gt;Princess Theradras&lt;/a&gt;, who loved the centaur, worried that the Horde's rise to power might eventually drive them to extinction. She acted to save her children by infusing them with her power, driving their warbands to storm out of Desolace and claim new territories. In &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;, the Kolkar plotted to take over the orc lands. In the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt;, new leaders rallied the disorganized Kolkar and turned them into a real threat against the Horde. &lt;a href=\"Regthar%20Deathgate\"&gt;Regthar Deathgate&lt;/a&gt; led Horde operations against them. In the &lt;a href=\"Thousand%20Needles\"&gt;Thousand Needles&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Galak%20tribe\"&gt;Galak&lt;/a&gt; increased their attacks on tauren caravans. &lt;a href=\"Cliffwatcher%20Longhorn\"&gt;Cliffwatcher Longhorn&lt;/a&gt; reported that they were more of an annoyance than a real threat, but that there were rumors of centaur clans uniting.\n&lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; sent Horde &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to Desolace to handle the centaur threat. They quickly discovered that the centaur were slaughtering each other just as much as they were attacking outsiders. When they investigated further, they met &lt;a href=\"Warug\"&gt;Warug&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Magram%20clan\"&gt;Magram clan&lt;/a&gt;, who told them of Theradras' recent actions and that Desolace had been corrupted. The Horde allied with the Magram\u2014who held no loyalty to Theradras, unlike the other clans\u2014and helped them suppress the other tribes in Desolace: the Kolkar, &lt;a href=\"Gelkis%20clan\"&gt;Gelkis&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Maraudine%20clan\"&gt;Maraudine&lt;/a&gt;. The adventurers then entered Maraudon and defeated Theradras, ending the spreading corruption in Desolace and easing the centaur's violent bloodlust. This also freed the captive spirit of &lt;a href=\"Zaetar\"&gt;Zaetar&lt;/a&gt;, but he chose to remain in Maraudon since he believed that the centaur had need of their father, despite their crimes against him. With the Horde's blessing, Warug and the Magram became the rulers of the united centaur and led them to an age of tranquility. Yet none knew how long they would stay on the path of peace.\nSeparately, an exile called the &lt;a href=\"Centaur%20Pariah\"&gt;Centaur Pariah&lt;/a&gt; wanted adventurers to help him craft an &lt;a href=\"%3AAmulet%20of%20Union\"&gt;:Amulet of Union&lt;/a&gt;, which would make him powerful enough to unite the centaur into one great tribe and reform them into being \"as our ancestors wanted us to be\".\nAt some point before the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, a centaur warband attacked and burned down &lt;a href=\"Camp%20Narache\"&gt;Camp Narache&lt;/a&gt; in Mulgore. The &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt; rescued the camp's survivors and tried to put out the fire, but were forced to flee from the centaur after the elements refused to aid them. Soon after, the centaur were massacred by the rogue &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Shotoa\"&gt;Shotoa&lt;/a&gt;.\nBloodsworn.\nIn the wake of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, Maraudon saw the emergence of a &lt;a href=\"Aratas%27%20father\"&gt;powerful earth elemental&lt;/a&gt; who held Azeroth's mortal races responsible for the Cataclysm. He created a new, \"pure\" race of centaur called the &lt;a href=\"perfect%20ones\"&gt;perfect ones&lt;/a&gt;, free of the flaws of the \"older breed\", who would spread over the world and reclaim it from those who had \"defiled\" it. Their leader, the High Khan &lt;a href=\"Aratas\"&gt;Aratas&lt;/a&gt;, united the &lt;a href=\"Kolkar%20clan\"&gt;Kolkar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Magram%20clan\"&gt;Magram&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maraudine%20clan\"&gt;Maraudine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gelkis%20clan\"&gt;Gelkis&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Galak%20tribe\"&gt;Galak&lt;/a&gt; tribes into a massive army in Desolace with the promise that he would usher in a new age in which the centaur would claim the lands that were rightfully theirs from the \"mongrel\" races and reign over Azeroth. The perfect ones discriminated against the older centaur by forbidding them from entering Maraudon and, in at least &lt;a href=\"Dorthar\"&gt;one case&lt;/a&gt;, trying to kill a member of the older breed who was deemed too weak to fit in Aratas' vision of a strong, \"pure\" race.\nThe centaur capitalized on the Cataclysm and began to attack Horde settlements all over Kalimdor, enslaving large numbers of orcs in the process, in order to keep the Horde distracted until Aratas could invade and destroy the Horde capitals of &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; with slave-built siege weapons and the power of his elemental father. The Horde sent its newly-formed &lt;a href=\"Garad%27kra\"&gt;Garad'kra&lt;/a&gt; militia to counter the threat. They received help from the drifter &lt;a href=\"Malgar\"&gt;Malgar&lt;/a&gt; and from the centaur outcast &lt;a href=\"Dorthar\"&gt;Dorthar&lt;/a&gt;, who informed them of Aratas' plans. Together they attacked Maraudon, defeated the perfect ones, and killed Aratas and his father, giving the Horde enough time to move their forces into position and break up the centaur army. Dorthar subsequently became the first centaur to join the Horde.\nCataclysm.\nAfter the Cataclysm, the Kolkar continued to encroach on the Horde in the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Barrens\"&gt;Northern Barrens&lt;/a&gt;. In the &lt;a href=\"Thousand%20Needles\"&gt;Thousand Needles&lt;/a&gt;, the Galak centaur survived the flooding of the region by moving to the &lt;a href=\"Splithoof%20Heights\"&gt;Splithoof Heights&lt;/a&gt;, which happened to be rich in &lt;a href=\"oil\"&gt;oil&lt;/a&gt;. The inhabitants of &lt;a href=\"Fizzle%20%26amp%3B%20Pozzik%27s%20Speedbarge\"&gt;Fizzle &amp; Pozzik's Speedbarge&lt;/a&gt; tried to trick the Galak into giving them pumping rights, then resorted to taking the oil and land by force after negotiations failed.\nIn Desolace, the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Blade\"&gt;Burning Blade&lt;/a&gt; cult and their &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; masters pushed the Magram clan out of &lt;a href=\"Magram%20Village\"&gt;their home&lt;/a&gt; and renamed it &lt;a href=\"Shok%27Thokar\"&gt;Shok'Thokar&lt;/a&gt;. The Magram, in turn, defeated the Kolkar clan and took over &lt;a href=\"Magram%20Territory\"&gt;their lands&lt;/a&gt;. The Kolkar leader &lt;a href=\"Khan%20Leh%27Prah\"&gt;Khan Leh'Prah&lt;/a&gt; escaped to &lt;a href=\"Karnum%27s%20Glade\"&gt;Karnum's Glade&lt;/a&gt; to ask for help from adventurers. Leh'Prah had seen visions of the future and believed that centaur lands would be corrupted forever if the Burning Blade weren't stopped. Through shows of force, adventurers convinced &lt;a href=\"Khan%20Kammah\"&gt;Khan Kammah&lt;/a&gt; of the Magram and &lt;a href=\"Khan%20Shodo\"&gt;Khan Shodo&lt;/a&gt; of the Gelkis to join forces with Leh'Prah and the Kolkar against their common enemy. Together, the three clans attacked the Burning Blade at Shok'Thokar, and the three khans killed the &lt;a href=\"annihilan\"&gt;pit lord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Agogridon\"&gt;Agogridon&lt;/a&gt; to win the day. Leh'Prah, Kammah, Shodo, and their clans then took up residence in the reclaimed Shok'Thokar as united \"sons of &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarion&lt;/a&gt;\".\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20Campaign\"&gt;Argus Campaign&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; traveled to Desolace to warn the centaur about &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28titan%29\"&gt;the world-soul&lt;/a&gt;'s distress and the emergence of &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt;.\nDragonflight.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt; reawakened, the &lt;a href=\"Maruuk%20Centaur\"&gt;Maruuk&lt;/a&gt; centaur of the &lt;a href=\"Ohn%27ahran%20Plains\"&gt;Ohn'ahran Plains&lt;/a&gt;\u2014who had been isolated since the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;\u2014became embroiled in the conflict between the &lt;a href=\"dragonflight\"&gt;dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;s and the &lt;a href=\"Primalists\"&gt;Primalists&lt;/a&gt;. Shortly after the &lt;a href=\"green%20dragonflight\"&gt;green dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; and their leader &lt;a href=\"Merithra\"&gt;Merithra&lt;/a&gt; returned to their &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Gardens\"&gt;Emerald Gardens&lt;/a&gt;, Primalists led by &lt;a href=\"Koroleth\"&gt;Koroleth&lt;/a&gt; attacked the area in an attempt to reach the dragons' portal to the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;. The dragons repelled them, and the Primalists resorted to recruiting the help of the centaur of &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Nokhud\"&gt;Clan Nokhud&lt;/a&gt; and introducing them and their power-hungry khan, &lt;a href=\"Balakar%20Khan\"&gt;Balakar&lt;/a&gt;, to forbidden storm magic. The Primalists tried to recruit at least &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Shikaar\"&gt;Clan Shikaar&lt;/a&gt; as well, but this was unsuccessful.\nAdventurers traveled to the Ohn'ahran Plains and established diplomacy with the centaur so that they could cross their lands, reach the Emerald Gardens, and help Merithra and her flight empower the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Oathstone\"&gt;Emerald Oathstone&lt;/a&gt;. They befriended the Clan Shikaar and accompanied them to &lt;a href=\"Maruukai\"&gt;Maruukai&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Khural\"&gt;Khural&lt;/a&gt; gathering, where the clans planned to discuss the dragons' return. The green flight itself sent an emissary, &lt;a href=\"Gemisath\"&gt;Gemisath&lt;/a&gt;, to the Khural to ask &lt;a href=\"Khanam%20Matra%20Sarest\"&gt;Khanam Matra Sarest&lt;/a&gt; to uphold her ancestor &lt;a href=\"Teera\"&gt;Teera&lt;/a&gt;'s pact with the dragons by providing military aid against the Primalists. Sarest agreed to do so, but the gathering was disrupted by Balakar Khan and the Nokhud, who revealed their alliance with the Primalists, killed Gemisath, and launched an attack on Maruukai, starting off a war between them and the other clans. This was unlike any conflict the Maruuk had seen for generations. While &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Ukhel\"&gt;Clan Ukhel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Kaighan\"&gt;Clan Kaighan&lt;/a&gt; sided with Balakar, the other clans sided with Khanam Matra Sarest.\nWhile Balakar marshaled his army to conquer the entirety of the Ohn'ahran Plains, Sarest planned to blow the &lt;a href=\"Horn%20of%20Drusahl\"&gt;Horn of Drusahl&lt;/a&gt; to answer the green dragons' call for an alliance. However, with the Nokhud's aid, the Primalists were able to capture Ohn'ahra herself. With Ohn'ahra as their captive, the Primalist and Nokhud were able to blow the horn in order to lure the green dragonflight into a trap. However they failed in their objective in killing Merithra and the other centaur were able to prove they had no part in Clan Nokhud's betrayal. Rallying together the green dragonflight and the centaur were able to thwart the Primalists and kill their leader, &lt;a href=\"Koroleth\"&gt;Koroleth&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith Koroleth's death, Balakar retreated to &lt;a href=\"Nokhudon%20Hold\"&gt;his stronghold&lt;/a&gt; with the captive Ohn'ahra, even as he had his raiders storm across the plains to wreak havoc, with the remaining Primalists in the region aiding him in his endeavors, and &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Ukhel\"&gt;Clan Ukhel&lt;/a&gt; (one of the only centaur clans to have sided with him) using their necromantic magics to resurrect their ancestors Maruuk and Teera to serve as tools of war against their enemies. However as the centaur clashed against one another on the field, adventures struck out against Balakar's allies, defeating the Primalists, soothing the angered ancestors (who had swiftly killed the necromancer responsible for their rebirth), and ultimately invaded the stronghold, killing Balakar and freeing Ohn'ahra.\nAppearance.\nA centaur appears as a creature with a horse's body and legs and with a humanoid's torso, arms, and head. Their equine lower bodies give them great speed that is unmatched upon the plains, while their burly humanoid torsos give them incredible physical strength.\nKalimdorian centaur are considered very ugly by other races and are notorious for their stench. Bony protrusions and growths mar their every visage. They commonly adorn themselves with body paint of henna and thick dried mud, signifying their social role, rank, or the clan they hail from. Many of their &lt;a href=\"khan\"&gt;khan&lt;/a&gt;s have large tusks on the sides of their mouths, and the women always wear veils covering the lower part of their face.\nThe centaur of the Ohn'ahran Plains look somewhat more &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;- or &lt;a href=\"elf\"&gt;elf&lt;/a&gt;-like with cleaner features. None of them have tusks, but some of them have a distinctly larger and heavier build, with shaggier fur and deeper voices.\nCulture.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Maruuk%20Centaur\"&gt;Maruuk&lt;/a&gt; centaur of the &lt;a href=\"Ohn%27ahran%20Plains\"&gt;Ohn'ahran Plains&lt;/a&gt; are a society of hunters, nomads, and storytellers. They are a proud and territorial people who do not suffer insult lightly. They are organized into many individual &lt;a href=\"clan\"&gt;clan&lt;/a&gt;s, led by chieftains known as &lt;a href=\"khan\"&gt;khan&lt;/a&gt;s. Though each clan has its own strengths and weaknesses, they share a single culture and all consider themselves Maruuk. Clans rise and fall in power, and it is commonplace for clans to seize territory and power from their rivals by force, but they maintain relative peace among themselves and with the neighboring &lt;a href=\"green%20dragonflight\"&gt;green dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;. Each season, clans large and small gather in the city of &lt;a href=\"Maruukai\"&gt;Maruukai&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Khural\"&gt;Khural&lt;/a&gt;, a time of truce and discussion during which they share resources and stories. The Maruuk frequently trade with the &lt;a href=\"tuskarr\"&gt;tuskarr&lt;/a&gt;, with whom they share many values and hobbies.\nIn contrast, the centaur of Kalimdor are nomadic marauders known for their brutality, savagery, and cruelty. According to &lt;a href=\"Regthar%20Deathgate\"&gt;Regthar Deathgate&lt;/a&gt;, most of them are \"low, brutish creatures\", and they cannot \"focus their rage\" as the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s can. However, a few of them have the intelligence and vision required to lead. Centaur leadership relies on a core of disciplined warriors to keep the others in line and prevent them from killing each other out of jealousy, rage, and personal conflict. Their camps are often littered with important communications, but these can look more like barely-legible, angry scrawls than war plans. In battle, centaur tend to use simple tactics and attack their enemies head first. A great show of respect among centaur is smacking a fist on one's own chest. Like the centaur of the Ohn'ahran Plains, the horse-men of Kalimdor are organized into clans (or &lt;a href=\"tribe\"&gt;tribe&lt;/a&gt;s) led by khans, but they are much more fractured than the Maruuk. Each clan has its own agenda, and the things they share are a hatred for their progenitors, a hatred for the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt;, and an all-consuming hatred for other centaur clans. The clans would be an unstoppable threat if united into a single force, but most of the time they instead bicker and war among themselves. &lt;a href=\"Cliffwatcher%20Longhorn\"&gt;Cliffwatcher Longhorn&lt;/a&gt; observed that \"nothing could penetrate the pure hatred [the centaur] have... even of each other\".\nCentaur children are called \"foals\". They refer to other humanoid races as \"two-foot\" or \"two-legs\". Maruuk centaur wear horseshoes, and farriers are found in many of their settlements. The Maruuk have skilled weavers who make soft and elaborate rugs and quilts from &lt;a href=\"argali\"&gt;argali&lt;/a&gt; wool and the vivid natural dyes found in the Ohn'ahran Plains.\nSome Kalimdor centaur show fascination for advanced technology. When the &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Salzhigh\"&gt;Salzhigh&lt;/a&gt; created a &lt;a href=\"penguin\"&gt;penguin&lt;/a&gt; squeak-toy, the centaur (who had never seen a penguin before) purchased them as idols and worshipped them at altars. &lt;a href=\"Warug\"&gt;Warug&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Magram%20clan\"&gt;Magram clan&lt;/a&gt; considered &lt;a href=\"Target%20Dummy\"&gt;target dummies&lt;/a&gt; and other &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnomish&lt;/a&gt; inventions to be strange and entertaining.\nCompanions.\nThe Maruuk keep a variety of domesticated animals:\nThe Kalimdor clans use domesticated &lt;a href=\"hyena\"&gt;hyena&lt;/a&gt;s (often called \"packhounds\") as pets. \nCuisine.\nThe Maruuk mainly eat game meat from the various wildlife of the Ohn'ahran Plains. They also eat fish, cheese and milk from &lt;a href=\"argali\"&gt;argali&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"bruffalon\"&gt;bruffalon&lt;/a&gt;s, and sweets like tarts, puddings, and sliced honey plum with chilled cream. Centaur prefer their meat and fish roasted to the point of being charred black and drenched in so much spice that it numbs the tongue. Even foals have plenty of spice on their food. That said, the centaur of &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Teerai\"&gt;Clan Teerai&lt;/a&gt; can also enjoy a hearty fish stew like their &lt;a href=\"Iskaara%20Tuskarr\"&gt;Iskaara&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"tuskarr\"&gt;tuskarr&lt;/a&gt; neighbors. Some, but not all, tuskarr dislike centaur cooking, arguing that it dishonors the fish and that eating blackened fish with so much spice is akin to \"eating ash\".\nKalimdor's centaur hunt for meat whenever they are not at war. Excess meat is crudely dried and stored to allow them to fight for longer between hunts. Unlike the Maruuk, they are also &lt;a href=\"cannibalism\"&gt;cannibals&lt;/a&gt; who cook and eat humanoids they capture. They consider &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; meat to be tastier than tauren.\nSpirituality.\nMaruuk.\nThe Maruuk worship the eagle spirit &lt;a href=\"Ohn%27ahra\"&gt;Ohn'ahra&lt;/a&gt;, the Windmother. She originally guided the Maruuk's ancestors to the Ohn'ahran Plains during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, and has watched over them ever since. Foals with an innate connection to Ohn'ahra leave their clans to join the mystics of &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Ohn%27ir\"&gt;Clan Ohn'ir&lt;/a&gt;, who interpret her songs to advise the other centaur. Ohn'ahra does not speak in language but instead through the winds themselves, and the Ohn'ir are trained to feel her presence and interpret her messages. &lt;a href=\"Windsong%20Rise\"&gt;Windsong Rise&lt;/a&gt; is considered hallow ground for the Maruuk, being the place where their connection to the wind and Ohn'ahra is strongest. The Maruuk make a sharp distinction between \"wind magic\" and \"storm magic\". Storms are considered an affront to Ohn'ahra's gift and her most dire omen, and storm magic is therefore viewed as a sacrilege to her gift of winds.\nThe Maruuk believe that the spirits of dead centaur live with Ohn'ahra in the sky and run alongside her on the winds. When a mystic of Clan Ohn'ir dies, a sacred &lt;a href=\"ohuna\"&gt;ohuna&lt;/a&gt; known as a Child of Ohn'ahra carries their spirit to Windsong Rise, were they may become one with the wind and sky. The ancestors always walk beside their living descendants, guiding and protecting them, to the point where the &lt;a href=\"Khural\"&gt;Khural&lt;/a&gt; is considered a gathering for not only the living Maruuk, but the dead as well. The Khural begins when &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Teerai\"&gt;Clan Teerai&lt;/a&gt; invite the ancestors to Maruukai by giving them an offering in the form of a meal. They intentionally overchar and overspice the food to ensure that the scent is strong enough to reach the spirits in the sky.\nMaruuk tales are handed down through the generations through storytellers, a sacred role rooted in tradition. They tell these stories to pay respect to the ancestors and remind themselves of what's important.\nKalimdor.\nAmong Kalimdor's centaur, the females tend to use a dark, perverted form of &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;ism, while magic use among males is quite rare. All Kalimdorian clans have practitioners of air magic, often called \"stormers\" or \"windchasers\". The &lt;a href=\"Gelkis%20clan\"&gt;Gelkis clan&lt;/a&gt; specializes in earth magic. The centaur view the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt;'s traditions of shamanism and ties to nature as weak.\nThe centaur of Desolace consider the temple of &lt;a href=\"Maraudon\"&gt;Maraudon&lt;/a&gt;\u2014the resting place of their father &lt;a href=\"Zaetar\"&gt;Zaetar&lt;/a&gt;\u2014to be holy and protect it with their lives. It is used as a combination of ancient centaur &lt;a href=\"Funerary%20practices\"&gt;burial grounds&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a primal temple dedicated to the elemental earth. Only spirits and the most sacred priests and priestesses are allowed to enter its halls. At least one centaur, &lt;a href=\"Khan%20Shodo\"&gt;Khan Shodo&lt;/a&gt; of the Gelkis, acknowledges the &lt;a href=\"Earth%20Mother\"&gt;Earth Mother&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Galak%20tribe\"&gt;Galak&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Splithoof%20Heights\"&gt;Splithoof Heights&lt;/a&gt; worship an &lt;a href=\"air%20elemental\"&gt;air elemental&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Whrrrl\"&gt;Whrrrl&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe centaur claim that a white &lt;a href=\"kodo\"&gt;kodo&lt;/a&gt; is a harbinger of doom.\nMarriage.\nThe Maruuk practice betrothal. There are various traditions associated with marriage, but different individuals and clans seem to hold different views of them. &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Odgerel\"&gt;Elder Odgerel&lt;/a&gt; believes that it's irrelevant if partners love each other and that it is more important to keep to tradition, which involves giving sweets to a matchmaker who will find a partner for the bachelor, an exchange of offerings between families, and many other ceremonies. &lt;a href=\"Matchmaker%20Osila\"&gt;Matchmaker Osila&lt;/a&gt; believes that true compatibility between lovers comes from seeking guidance from one of the ancestors and asking them to bless the relationship. According to &lt;a href=\"Ohn%20Arasara\"&gt;Ohn Arasara&lt;/a&gt;, tradition suggests that the centaur making the proposal should gift sweets to their intended partner's family. These sweets are then shared with the rest of the clan. Tradition also dictates that the proposer should receive a blessing from both their own and their intended partner's clan before they make their proposal.\nClans.\nMaruuk.\nThe Maruuk centaur of the Ohn'ahran Plains are split into many different clans, but there are four who hold the most power:\nIn addition, there are various minor clans:\nKalimdor.\nThe centaur of Kalimdor are split into five &lt;a href=\"clan\"&gt;clan&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"tribe\"&gt;tribe&lt;/a&gt;s, each corresponding to one of the original five &lt;a href=\"khan\"&gt;khan&lt;/a&gt;s born of &lt;a href=\"Zaetar\"&gt;Zaetar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Theradras\"&gt;Theradras&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn addition, a faction called the &lt;a href=\"Centaur%20Marauders\"&gt;Centaur Marauders&lt;/a&gt; appears in the &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Kalimdor\"&gt;Invasion of Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; campaign in \"\", and an &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20centaur\"&gt;unnamed group&lt;/a&gt; appears in the &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt; in the mission &lt;a href=\"Where%20Wyverns%20Dare%20%28WC3%20Orc%29\"&gt;Where Wyverns Dare&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nCentaurs are savage and brutal, and they often take prisoners. These prisoners are usually eaten. However, rumors tell of centaurs dragging humanoids of all sorts off to become slaves, forcing them to work in hardscrabble opal mines. &lt;a href=\"Opal\"&gt;Opal&lt;/a&gt;s are used to make crude &lt;a href=\"trinket\"&gt;trinket&lt;/a&gt;s or are thrown into sacrificial offerings to the spirits. Young tauren have made something of a game out of this tradition, snatching away the centaur's offerings and leaving insulting totems in their place. They must be swift, lest they be caught by the centaur, who leave their gutted remains as a warning to others who would consider doing the same.\nFilthy creatures, centaurs are always followed by swarms of flies, which are attracted by the centaur's repellent odor. Centaurs have no qualms about leaving piles of dung strewn about their encampments, and no concept of privacy.\nEach of the five tribes in Desolace had their own unique tribal color: black, brown, green, red, and yellow. Members used the colors to mark their weapons and their faces. These colors are literally the names of centaur tribes fathered by Zaetar, but likely refer to the five main centaur tribes (Kolkar, Magram, Maraudine, Gelkis, and Galak). The Red tribe for example lived in &lt;a href=\"Spearhold\"&gt;Spearhold&lt;/a&gt;.\nOrigin.\n\"Long, ago, the kaldorei god Cenarius bore three children, the centaur, the dryad, and the keeper of the grove. However, one son, the centaur, grew to despise his beautiful siblings, then all other creatures of the world, and challenged Cenarius. The centaur believed that he was the strongest of the three children, and that Cenarius refused to love him and instead doted on his other children.\nIn embracing his hatred and savagery, he struck his father in blind rage, trying to force his father to love him above all other creatures. In retort, the god cursed the centaur, stripping him of his beauty and powers, leaving him only with his hatred and anger. The centaur fled in rage, and swore a blood feud on all the creatures of the world. He reserved most of his hatred for Cenarius' favored children, and thus the night elves drew his ire as well. We &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; too drew his anger, as he was jealous of our strength and power with the world, the same power he lost.\nHis children carry his anger, and destroy everything they touch, bearing their father's hatred of all things of the world.\nLanguages.\nCentaurs speak &lt;a href=\"Low%20Common\"&gt;Low Common&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Common%20%28language%29\"&gt;Common&lt;/a&gt;. The Krenka clan speaks &lt;a href=\"Krenkese\"&gt;Krenkese&lt;/a&gt; and Low Common. A few centaurs learn the languages of their enemies, including &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20%28language%29\"&gt;Goblin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Orcish%20%28language%29\"&gt;Orcish&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Taur-ahe\"&gt;Taur-ahe&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Zandali\"&gt;Zandali&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Taur-ahe\"&gt;Taur-ahe&lt;/a&gt; is learned as a secondary language, though a few centaur primarily speak &lt;a href=\"Taur-ahe\"&gt;Taur-ahe&lt;/a&gt;.\nInspiration.\ns are half-man, half-horse creatures from Greek mythology, known for their wild and untamed nature.\nThe culture of \"Warcraft\"'s centaur is loosely based on that of , such as the and . This is evident in their use of the title \", of architecture that resembles s, the design of their armor, and\u2014arguably\u2014their extensive use of archery and storm-based shamanism."}

A common marauder has squat features. \nThe herds highly prize weapons of steel. Having no way to forge these weapons, most of the herd use bone, stone and horn to make their weapons. These include tooth or bone arrowheads, obsidian arrowheads (very sharp but chips easily), and blunted arrowheads (used to stun or subdue prey). Stone clubs and axes are the most common weapons among the herds. \nThey make their clothing out of &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; hide."}

Central Kalimdor is the new home of the &lt;a href=\"New%20Horde\"&gt;New Horde&lt;/a&gt;, but controlling the regions they have claimed proves a daunting task. The Horde's numbers have thinned since their exodus from &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;; and while the orcs have found new allies in the trolls, the tauren and the Forsaken, they continue to be pressed by threats from all sides, as well as internal conflicts. The Alliance's power here has waned since the Third War, and a handful of new &lt;a href=\"dwarven\"&gt;dwarven&lt;/a&gt; excavation sites and &lt;a href=\"night%20elven\"&gt;night elven&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"camp\"&gt;camp&lt;/a&gt;s are the best refuge an &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; member can hope for outside the &lt;a href=\"city\"&gt;city&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt;. Theramore was once the Alliance's ray of hope in Kalimdor, but its brightness has diminished since the death of &lt;a href=\"Admiral%20Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Admiral Daelin Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;. The weight of his fall still hangs heavy over the people of Theramore, and the coming of the massive &lt;a href=\"black%20dragon\"&gt;black dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Onyxia&lt;/a&gt; places the Alliance's settlements in mortal danger. \nCentral Kalimdor is one of the most war-torn regions on the &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;globe&lt;/a&gt;, with the &lt;a href=\"zone\"&gt;zone&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Desolace\"&gt;Desolace&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt; already reduced to little more than ash and rubble by the constant fighting among numerous factions. While the Alliance and Horde struggle with each other here, it is other groups such as the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Venture%20Company\"&gt;Venture Company&lt;/a&gt; that threaten to reduce this entire section of the continent to an uninhabitable wasteland. Adventurers continue to work toward restoring peace and tranquility to the land, but their numbers are few, and there is much work yet to be done."}

Calculating and methodical, Denathrius is ancient beyond measure and one of the most powerful beings in all the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;. He created the venthyr in his likeness, forging them from the &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;s of the redeemed. The first venthyr were born directly from Denathrius' will, such as &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Renathal\"&gt;Prince Renathal&lt;/a&gt; who considers him his father. He is also the creator of the &lt;a href=\"Nathrezim\"&gt;Nathrezim&lt;/a&gt;, cruel and cunning beings with the purpose to be the greatest spies and infiltrators in all of reality, in order to spread the influence of &lt;a href=\"Death\"&gt;Death&lt;/a&gt; throughout the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;cosmos&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn a midst of a rebellion caused by the anima drought that\u2019s swept over the Shadowlands, rumors suggested that Denathrius may no longer be fit for the role of Master of Revendreth. Crowning a new Sire could return the plane to its former glory, or leave it mired in the same decadence and sin it is charged with cleansing. Consequently, Denathrius beseeched &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt; to help him quell the rebellion led by Prince Renathal, which threatened to destroy the venthyr way of life, but not all was as Denathrius claimed.\nIn truth, Denathrius has been corrupted by the very sins Revendreth swore to punish. Cooperating with &lt;a href=\"Zovaal\"&gt;Zovaal the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, he wished to rule all the Shadowlands and to free the Jailer from his bonds by channeling massive amounts of anima into the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt;. Although he accomplished his plan, he was later defeated by the &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Walker\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt;s in his own castle, while his essence was absorbed by his &lt;a href=\"Animated%20object\"&gt;sentient blade&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Remornia\"&gt;Remornia&lt;/a&gt;. At &lt;a href=\"Dawnkeep\"&gt;Dawnkeep&lt;/a&gt;, Denathrius was placed under the watch of the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Z%27rali\"&gt;Z'rali&lt;/a&gt; to fulfill his repentance, until he was freed by the nathrezim who infiltrated Revendreth.\nAs the one behind the drought of anima that plagues the Shadowlands, he is one of secondary antagonists and the final boss of &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Nathria\"&gt;Castle Nathria&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nAncient times.\nLike his fellow &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Ones\"&gt;Eternal Ones&lt;/a&gt;, Denathrius was forged by the &lt;a href=\"First%20Ones\"&gt;First Ones&lt;/a&gt; in their realm of &lt;a href=\"Zereth%20Mortis\"&gt;Zereth Mortis&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Prototype%20of%20Absolution\"&gt;Prototype of Absolution&lt;/a&gt; is an incomplete prototype of him. In the beginning of &lt;a href=\"Revendreth\"&gt;Revendreth&lt;/a&gt;, Sire Denathrius created the first &lt;a href=\"venthyr\"&gt;venthyr&lt;/a&gt; from his own will at &lt;a href=\"Sinfall\"&gt;Sinfall&lt;/a&gt;, naming them his &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Harvesters\"&gt;Court of Harvesters&lt;/a&gt; and giving each a Medallion with great power that ultimate was tied to his own being in order to help redeem souls and prevent them from damnation in the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt;. First among these was &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Renathal\"&gt;Prince Renathal&lt;/a&gt;.\nAges ago, just after the first venthyr were sired, Denathrius created another race known as the &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt; to infiltrate the other &lt;a href=\"Magic%23The%20cosmic%20forces\"&gt;cosmic forces&lt;/a&gt; and spread the influence of &lt;a href=\"Death\"&gt;Death&lt;/a&gt;. Their infiltrations went mostly unnoticed, but the nathrezim who infiltrated the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; were discovered. In revenge, the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; and their forces assaulted Revendreth and set the &lt;a href=\"Ember%20Ward\"&gt;ward once held by the nathrezim&lt;/a&gt; ablaze. Revendreth was defended by the &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Legion\"&gt;Stone Legion&lt;/a&gt;, and though they were successful in pushing the naaru back the losses they suffered caused the &lt;a href=\"Stonewright\"&gt;Stonewright&lt;/a&gt; to blame the nathrezim for the loss of so many of her children, as the Light's attack was ultimately their fault. In order to end the conflict between nathrezim and venthyr, Denathrius agreed to exile the nathrezim to a world beyond the Shadowlands: &lt;a href=\"Nathreza\"&gt;Nathreza&lt;/a&gt;.\nLong ago, Denathrius worked with the other Eternal Ones to banish their traitorous brother &lt;a href=\"Zovaal\"&gt;Zovaal&lt;/a&gt;, later called the Jailer, to the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt;. He ambiguously told the defeated Zovaal that he \"could have sought another way\" and that they could've accomplished great things together. However, Renathal wonders how long Denathrius was actually working for the Jailer. At some point, Denathrius willingly offered his &lt;a href=\"sigil\"&gt;sigil&lt;/a&gt; over to the Jailer. &lt;a href=\"General%20Draven\"&gt;General Draven&lt;/a&gt; even reveals that Denathrius had ordered him to hide a blood mirror in Bastion and secretly sabotage the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Forge\"&gt;Eternal Forge&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"kyrian\"&gt;kyrian&lt;/a&gt;s long ago, which Prime Forgelite &lt;a href=\"Mikanikos\"&gt;Mikanikos&lt;/a&gt; affirms is the reason why the &lt;a href=\"Forsworn\"&gt;Forsworn&lt;/a&gt; so easily took control of their infrastructure. The &lt;a href=\"Night%20Fae%20Covenant\"&gt;night fae&lt;/a&gt; of Ardenweald always perceived him to be a cruel leader.\nFollowing &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;'s defeat during the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, Denathrius recruited him to Zovaal's side and supplied him with &lt;a href=\"anima\"&gt;anima&lt;/a&gt; to aid the cause.\nShadowlands.\nUpon arriving in Revendreth, the &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Walker\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt; is tricked by Denathrius into helping him trap &lt;a href=\"The%20Accuser\"&gt;The Accuser&lt;/a&gt;, empowering them with the &lt;a href=\"Medallion%20of%20Dominion\"&gt;Medallion of Dominion&lt;/a&gt;. After declaring her to be banished in the &lt;a href=\"Ember%20Ward\"&gt;Ember Ward&lt;/a&gt; after participation in the Penitent Hunt in the &lt;a href=\"Forest%20Ward\"&gt;Forest Ward&lt;/a&gt;, she manages to gain the &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Walker\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt;s trust and reveals to them Denathrius's true allegiance and plans. While the Arbiter is indeed broken, Revendreth had been hoarding all their reserve anima that should have been given to the other realms in times of need, saved up for &lt;a href=\"the%20Jailer\"&gt;the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter releasing Prince Renathal and others from the Maw and gathering the remaining forces, Renathal insists on directly confronting Denathrius. This confrontation fails and Denathrius triggers an explosion, hemorrhaging anima out of &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Nathria\"&gt;Castle Nathria&lt;/a&gt; through the &lt;a href=\"Menagerie%20of%20the%20Master\"&gt;Menagerie of the Master&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe is ultimately defeated by &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Renathal\"&gt;Prince Renathal&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Walker\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt;, and their forces, but is absorbed by &lt;a href=\"Remornia\"&gt;Remornia&lt;/a&gt; in a last bid to save her master. She fails to escape to the Maw and ask Zovaal to restore him, instead finding herself trapped along with Denathrius in &lt;a href=\"Dawnkeep\"&gt;Dawnkeep&lt;/a&gt; to be re-educated by the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Z%27rali\"&gt;Z'rali&lt;/a&gt; for eons until he repents.\nIt is later revealed Denathrius had given the Medallion of Dominion to &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; and that he had been conspiring with him. This partnership then attempted to be seized by &lt;a href=\"the%20Tithelord\"&gt;the Tithelord&lt;/a&gt;. With enough anima, Kel'Thuzad could not only control all venthyr with the Medallion of Dominion, but could also alter the fabric of the Shadowlands. In fact, he successfully manages to open a rift to the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Rituals\"&gt;House of Rituals&lt;/a&gt; and lets one of the creatures enter Maldraxxus, once again demonstrating the depravity Denathrius had planned for all.\nThough defeated, Denathrius's will can still exert itself through the Medallions, and things empowered by them, such as the new Crown of the Harvesters. Upon regaining his Medallion, Renathal once again is tempted by Denathrius's will through it, but once again rejects it.\nWhen Sylvanas asked the Jailer about their plan to recover Denathrius after his defeat and capture, the Jailer indicates having no further use for him, simply stating that every soul has a purpose and Denathrius has fulfilled his.\nWith the Jailer in possession of four of the five necessary sigils to open the &lt;a href=\"Sepulcher%20%28Shadowlands%29\"&gt;Sepulcher&lt;/a&gt;, the nathrezim revealed their infiltration of Revendreth and rescued their master by having &lt;a href=\"Kin%27tessa\"&gt;Kin'tessa&lt;/a&gt; grabbing Remornia away.\nSince the &lt;a href=\"The%20Jailer%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;defeat&lt;/a&gt; of Zovaal against the &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Walker\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt;s, the status and location of Denathrius are still unknown.\nPersonality.\nIn the past, Renathal described Denathrius as being a heroic and charismatic leader, responsible for the redemption of countless souls due to his intricate understanding of mortal sins. But when the players meet him, the Sire is a corrupt and prideful despot, willing to go to any length to sate his lust for power and further his own plans. This included allowing all of existence to be bound to the Jailer's will to rule alongside his corrupt brother.\nDenathrius typically shows a calm and confident persona. Proud of his own power and abilities to the point of arrogance, he seems to regard all those around him as utterly beneath him. The one exception to this is his &lt;a href=\"Animated%20object\"&gt;living sword&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Remornia\"&gt;Remornia&lt;/a&gt;, whom he seems to genuinely enjoy speaking to, his cunning wit contrasting with her bloodthirsty directness. In battle, Denathrius commands Remornia as he would a loyal servant, and the sword obeys him with sadistic joy. He wields impressive physical and magical abilities, focused around &lt;a href=\"anima\"&gt;anima&lt;/a&gt;, conjuring &lt;a href=\"manifestation\"&gt;manifestation&lt;/a&gt;s of others' sins, and battling directly, either unarmed or with Remornia in-hand. The sadistic glee he displays in battle shows he enjoys abusing his abilities to inflict pain, rather than guiding one to atonement, as was his original mission.\nHis greatest point of pride, however, is his intelligence. Denathrius has shown to be able to create numerous long-term plans to steal anima, play his enemies against each other, and spread the influence of &lt;a href=\"Death\"&gt;Death&lt;/a&gt; (him specifically) across the cosmos. The greatest example of this are his &lt;a href=\"dreadlord\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt;s, an entire race of master infiltrators and spies that would answer directly to him. He even had a plan in place to save himself should he be imprisoned. It is only when his plans begin to go awry that the Sire shows any amount of distress, such as when he was pushed into a murderous rage in the final stage of his boss fight.\nIn Hearthstone.\nDenathrius is the central character of the \"Hearthstone\" expansion \"\". In the story of the expansion, Denathrius invited several of his allies and enemies from other realms to a dinner party at Castle Nathria to address the rumors that he had been hoarding anima, only for the Sire to be found mysteriously dead at the start of the soir\u00e9e. Players need to work with the &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt; detective to determine who among the guests is the culprit.\nDenathrius personally appears in the set as . His flavor text reads: \"History has a way of altering villains so that we can no longer see ourselves in them.

Dentarg and his master were present when the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; was destroyed by the Alliance at the end of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;. After Ner'zhul was wounded by the blast, Dentarg was quick to gently gather his master in his arms and bring him to the rest of the &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20clan\"&gt;Shadowmoon clan&lt;/a&gt;, so that he could heal from his wounds.\nTwo years later, &lt;a href=\"Teron%20Gorefiend\"&gt;Teron&lt;/a&gt; explained to Ner'zhul his plan to gather Azeroth's artifacts and leave &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;. Dentarg sent emissaries to the surviving clans of Draenor, resulting in the &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20clan\"&gt;Warsong&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Hand%20clan\"&gt;Shattered Hand&lt;/a&gt; clans coming to Ner'zhul's side. Grom Hellscream aided Dentarg by sending his own emissaries as well. Once Dentarg returned from his mission, he reported that the &lt;a href=\"Whiteclaw%20clan\"&gt;Whiteclaw clan&lt;/a&gt; was clan no more. Dentarg then became Ner'zhul's enforcer, the &lt;a href=\"Clan%23Orcish%20clan%20system\"&gt;clans&lt;/a&gt; of Draenor back in line when they opposed his absolute rule.\nDentarg later joined Ner'zhul when the elder shaman journeyed to the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt; in order to perform the ritual to open the portals that would allow the Horde to invade other worlds. Upon learning that &lt;a href=\"Kargath%20Bladefist\"&gt;Kargath&lt;/a&gt; and his clan were to remain behind to hold off the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, Dentarg remarked to Ner'zhul that the &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Hand%20clan\"&gt;Shattered Hand&lt;/a&gt; could not win. Ner'zhul replied that they just had to buy time for the ritual. Dentarg was surprised when Ner'zhul ordered him to remain behind in the Hellfire Citadel and aid Kargath; he believed that his place should be by Ner'zhul's side. After learning about the magi employed by the Alliance and that Teron Gorefiend would be present at Ner'zhul's side at the Black Temple, Dentarg reluctantly remained behind but promised that he would journey to the Black Temple should he survive.\nDuring the battle with the &lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Lothar\"&gt;Sons of Lothar&lt;/a&gt;, Dentarg entered into a duel of magic with Archmage &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;. Dentarg's magic couldn't strike through Khadgar's defenses, and when Dentarg sent his most powerful spell, Khadgar merely absorbed it into his palm and was refreshed by it. Accepting his defeat against a more powerful sorcerer, Dentarg bowed his head and Khadgar decapitated him.\nWarcraft II: Beyond the Dark Portal.\nSome of Dentarg's most famous exploits include retrieving the &lt;a href=\"Skull%20of%20Gul%27dan\"&gt;Skull of Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; from a &lt;a href=\"Bonechewer%20clan\"&gt;Bonechewer clan&lt;/a&gt; captain, employing both the &lt;a href=\"Thunderlord%20clan\"&gt;Thunderlord clan&lt;/a&gt; and a group of &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Hand%20clan\"&gt;Shattered Hand clan&lt;/a&gt; warriors. He also personally oversaw the defeat of the Bonechewers and Thunderlords during an uprising before the second crossing into &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, as the two clans refused to follow Ner'zhul's orders.\nWarcraft Adventures: Lord of the Clans.\nIn the canceled \"\", &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grommash Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; had one of Dentarg's skulls inside his hideout at the &lt;a href=\"Ork%20Reservation\"&gt;orcish reservation&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Singe\"&gt;Singe&lt;/a&gt; told &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; that Dentarg and the &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20clan\"&gt;Shadowmoon clan&lt;/a&gt; betrayed the &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20clan\"&gt;Warsong clan&lt;/a&gt; before the humans destroyed the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;second Portal&lt;/a&gt;."}

Dentarg is often called upon to rally support from wayward &lt;a href=\"Clan%23Orcish%20clan%20system\"&gt;clans&lt;/a&gt; and put them back in line should they oppose Ner'zhul's absolute rule.\nSpells.\nThe Ogre-Mage creates a free-floating apparition in the form of a disembodied Eye that he can then direct through the air to look down upon enemy forces and encampments. Named for the great leader of the &lt;a href=\"Bleeding%20Hollow%20clan\"&gt;Bleeding Hollow clan&lt;/a&gt;, this ever vigilant Eye transmits its view to the caster, giving him the knowledge of both the lands it wanders and those creatures who live there. The Eye will vanish after a time, leaving the Ogre-Mage with the knowledge of the terrain.\nThis enchantment is used to instill an insatiable lust for blood into a fellow warrior, causing him to enter into a savage, berserk rage. A fighter who feels this Bloodlust deals more damage to his opponents than normally could be done.

When these Runes explode, they cause massive damage to anyone standing over them as well as all those in adjacent areas. Those who are diligent and watchful will catch a glimpse of the Rune as they approach it. The chaotic forces that make up this enchantment can not discern between ally or enemy and will kill a friend as surely as a foe. Heed these warnings well, as even staying near these Runes can be hazardous - for when the dwoemer dissolves, they explode as if their &lt;a href=\"Magic\"&gt;magiks&lt;/a&gt; had been triggered."}

However, it would take a while before all the clans had gathered. Not having heard from the Prophet in three days, Thrall began to worry. Even more troubling was that &lt;a href=\"Grom%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grom Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; hadn't been seen in some time. Thrall established a base in preparation for the Horde's arrival.\nHowever, just as the base was finished, a group of human footmen from a nearby &lt;a href=\"Southshore\"&gt;Alliance Naval Base&lt;/a&gt; approached and ordered the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s to surrender. The &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"captain%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;captain&lt;/a&gt; informed the orcs that the they had already captured one of their leaders - &lt;a href=\"Hellscream\"&gt;Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;. Determined to rescue his friend, Thrall and his warriors slew the human attackers and launched an attack on the internment camp. The orcs fought their way through the camp's defenses, rescuing many captured orcs in the process. Eventually, Thrall and his warriors located Hellscream, but before they could free him, they had to destroy three guard towers protecting the area. When this was done, Thrall released Hellscream.\nHellscream hadn't been hurt (with the exception of his pride) and was eager to leave the human lands. He showed Thrall some human ships docked at the camp. Seconds later, the rest of the clans arrived and the Horde assembled, the orcs commandeered the ships and set sail for Kalimdor. While they were sailing Medivh watches the Horde and tells that in Kalimdor is the only place where their salvation is assured."}

If you can bring him back to us alive, we can attempt to reverse the Cult's brainwashing.\nProgress.\nDarnavan has been among the Cult for so long now that there is no telling how he will react. He is a well-trained warrior, so be on your guard!\nCompletion.\nThank you, &lt;name&gt;!\nI owe you a debt of gratitude for rescuing a friend whom I had thought forever lost to the clutches of the Cult. And the Argent Crusade owes you a debt for the invaluable intelligence Darnavan brings with him from his time walking the halls of this Citadel as one of the Cult.\nPlease, take this as a token of this appreciation, and may the Light bolster you as you carve a path through this terrible place.\nNotes.\nDarnavan will randomly spawn with one of the first add waves. He will need to be off-tanked the entire fight in order to complete the quest. Success has been reported with using a DPS plate wearer to tank him, or using a hunter's pet to tank him.\nDeath Knights make better DPS tanks for him, since they have &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Presence\"&gt;Frost Presence&lt;/a&gt; to increase threat, hp, and armor, and &lt;a href=\"Chains%20of%20Ice\"&gt;Chains of Ice&lt;/a&gt; to slow him down when not whirlwinding. They simply need to hold him near the middle of the room during Phase 2, while in Phase 1 the Off-Tank holds him in roughly the same position, keeping in range of heals at all time.\nCrowd Control spells do not work, with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Entangling%20Roots\"&gt;Entangling Roots&lt;/a&gt;. Taking him to the back stairs and then casting entangling roots on him will reduce the amount of damage done to him and free up a player to work on the waves of adds.\nEvery so often when he breaks CC Darnavan will jump into the raid and do a &lt;a href=\"Whirlwind\"&gt;Whirlwind&lt;/a&gt;. While he is spinning he is immune to CC.\nTanks or whoever is tanking him should be careful and avoid doing large amounts of damage to him. He doesn't have that much health and even a tank can kill him accidentally over the course of the fight. A good strategy involves a main tank picking him up, pulling him out of the way, doing a few attacks, and then letting him just hit the tank for the duration of the fight. If the tank needs to eventually tank the boss, then Darnavan can be safely taunted off of one tank, and rinse and repeat.\nWhile tanking the boss the tank who is on the debuff cooldown needs to tank him. No one else can damage him since the tank will have reduced threat. When the OT is needed to tank Deathwhisper the MT should taunt Darnavan off him. If damage shields, Area of Effect spells, or cleave effects make it necessary to keep Darnavan away from Deathwhisper, it is sometimes possible to taunt-tank/kite-tank the boss for a short while, allowing her to be single tanked while the normal off-tank holds Darnavan at a safe distance. (&lt;a href=\"Diminishing%20returns\"&gt;Diminishing returns&lt;/a&gt; will eventually make Deathwhisper immune to taunting.)"}

It resembles a telescope on a tripod and points in direction of a nearby find. A colored light indicates how far away the find is.\nIf you survey within 8 yards of the find, the find itself will appear.\nEach successful survey run will gain you:\nNotes.\nThe theodolite aim can be off by as much as 30 degrees. While that isn't much when the find is within 50 yards, it can be substantial at longer distances. Still, it serves as a good approximation.\nAs a quick rule of thumb, a red light shows that mounting up will probably be worthwhile. You will probably want to run for about 5 seconds. You probably will want to stop short on a green light.\nSurvey results will only be gatherable for a few seconds before it disappears. If you are unsure you will be able to collect it immediately (because of interfering hostile mobs - or on PvP servers, hostile players), you will want to slay the mob (or discourage the player) before surveying. If players can stay in the same spot where the find appeared, survey again and it will reappear without counting against the total for that dig site.\nIf you survey at a dig site without exhausting it, then survey at a different dig site before returning to the first, the location of the next find at that first dig site will have been reset.\nIt is currently (early December 2010) possible for a find to be located within/on a wall steep enough that it cannot be reached from above or from below. In this case, reset the find location by going to a different dig site, digging, and returning.\nThere are also cases where the target location is outside the bounds you are allowed to use the Survey ability. For these cases, it may be possible to succeed by sidling along the boundary, surveying every few feet. If that does not work, or you lack the patience for it, you can also avoid this by going to another dig site and returning as above.\n&lt;a href=\"Priests\"&gt;Priests&lt;/a&gt; can use survey while floating over water using &lt;a href=\"Levitate\"&gt;Levitate&lt;/a&gt;, however, the surveying equipment will not appear on the surface of the water - it will appear on the bottom of the body of water the priest is standing on."}

While most gnomes who have been in contact with the radiation for a long time, the team is always willing to do their best to remove it from their patients before it overtakes them. While their main objective is to evacuate the survivors, they also seek to reduce the &lt;a href=\"leper%20gnome\"&gt;leper gnome&lt;/a&gt;s as a way of clearing to reclaim the halls of the city and to protect the survivors.\nThey use &lt;a href=\"Target%20Acquisition%20Device\"&gt;Target Acquisition Device&lt;/a&gt;s to keep the radiated leper gnomes at a distance. They also use teleport beacons to bring them and the survivors out of Gnomeregan, but they are for emergencies only. Their final piece of technology is the &lt;a href=\"Sanitron%20500\"&gt;Sanitron 500&lt;/a&gt;, which is used to clean the irradiated.\nA section in their organization is called the G-Team.

Founded at the time of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, most of its citizens are &lt;a href=\"Refugee\"&gt;refugees&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Gilneas\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; who came to the area after &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Gilneas\"&gt;losing&lt;/a&gt; their home, following the dream of an idealistic &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Marl%20Wormthorn\"&gt;Marl Wormthorn&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpon their arrival, Wormthorn believed that the &lt;a href=\"Tainted%20Scar\"&gt;Tainted Scar&lt;/a&gt; could be healed, and attempted to grow it back by creating the great tree &lt;a href=\"Maldraz\"&gt;Maldraz&lt;/a&gt; with his power. At first, it was a success and the forest was restored, allowing the refugees to build Surwich where the Tainted Scar was once present. However, it also lured the majority of &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s still present in the scar, and some &lt;a href=\"Nathrezim\"&gt;dreadlords&lt;/a&gt; took the opportunity to corrupt the great tree and the Gilnean druid, leading to the birth of the &lt;a href=\"Tainted%20Forest\"&gt;Tainted Forest&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt some point, a large number of Gilnean &lt;a href=\"ship\"&gt;ship&lt;/a&gt;s sailed towards Surwich, with only civilians aboard. However, the inhabitants of &lt;a href=\"Nethergarde%20Keep\"&gt;Nethergarde Keep&lt;/a&gt; reported that after a few days a storm brought some ships back to the &lt;a href=\"Shattershore\"&gt;Shattershore&lt;/a&gt;, revealing that they had sunk for unknown reasons and that their drowned occupants now haunt the coast.\nUnder the orders of &lt;a href=\"Charlton%20Connisport\"&gt;Mayor Charlton Connisport&lt;/a&gt;, Alliance &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s brought their aid by reducing the number of demons threatening Surwich and the forest. In order to halt the corruption, Marl Wormthorn was secretly eliminated, as the morale of the citizens was already low. It is unknown how they later reacted to his death, as they clung so tightly to the druid's dream.\nYears later, when the &lt;a href=\"Ironmarch\"&gt;Ironmarch&lt;/a&gt; entered &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; through the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, the village was still active and was spared from being attacked by the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt;."}

However, complications prevented them from leaving. Thomas, the future &lt;a href=\"Headless%20Horseman\"&gt;Headless Horseman&lt;/a&gt;, would come to the conclusion that a storm destroyed the last ship fleeing to Kalimdor.\nIn time, the Thomson's hiding spot from the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; would come under attack by the paranoid and zealous humans of the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt;.

Three adds appear and channel a spell holding the party member in place. \nYou have approximately 8 seconds to kill all the adds before the sword reaches the altar and kills the sacrifice target. &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Block\"&gt;Ice Block&lt;/a&gt; can be used to avoid the sacrifice, it is unknown whether other abilities also work. These abilities do not remove the sacrifice on Heroic Mode.\nHeroic - The adds have much more health and apply a dot to any player who casts a direct damage spell on them.

Among its murk-ridden marshes stand settlements built by the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s, as well as the ancient &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"temple%20of%20Atal%27Hakkar\"&gt;temple of Atal'Hakkar&lt;/a&gt;.\nOverview.\nFar distant from civilization, the Swamp of Sorrows is a stagnant marshland of sucking bogs and weeping trees. The ocean seeps into the fen, making the water brackish and ideal for &lt;a href=\"alligator\"&gt;alligator&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"crocolisk\"&gt;crocolisk&lt;/a&gt;s. Salt deposits encrust fallen logs and protruding rocks. &lt;a href=\"Bog%20beast\"&gt;Bog beast&lt;/a&gt;s slog through the interior. Despite these dangers, the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; has taken advantage of the region's distance from &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; to establish a colony in the zone. A flight of green dragons guards the Lost Temple, or &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Atal%27Hakkar\"&gt;Temple of Atal'Hakkar&lt;/a&gt;, an ancient troll edifice that channels demonic energy and drives living creatures to madness and violence.\nThe Swamp of Sorrows stands on the eastern side of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28continent%29\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, east of &lt;a href=\"Deadwind%20Pass\"&gt;Deadwind Pass&lt;/a&gt;, north of the &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt; and south of the &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. Most of the swamp is dominated by nature. Wild beasts like &lt;a href=\"crocolisk\"&gt;crocolisk&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20Jaguar\"&gt;jaguars&lt;/a&gt; hunt for prey, while aggressive &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"gilblin\"&gt;gilblin&lt;/a&gt; tribes populate the coast and nearby caves. &lt;a href=\"Draenei\"&gt;Draenei&lt;/a&gt; led through the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; years ago, driven mad due to homesickness and transformed into &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Ones\"&gt;Lost Ones&lt;/a&gt;, have settled in the northern swamps.\nThe orc outpost of &lt;a href=\"Stonard\"&gt;Stonard&lt;/a&gt;, built during the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt; and rebuilt under &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;'s rule, was until recently the only civilized town in the swamp. Though isolated from other Horde settlements, it has served as an important base of operations for the Horde's presence in this section of the continent, especially since the re-opening of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; in the nearby &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt;. Alarmed by the increased presence of Horde so close to their towns and cities, the Alliance have set up the outpost of &lt;a href=\"Marshtide%20Watch\"&gt;Marshtide Watch&lt;/a&gt; to directly combat the Horde and push them out of the swamp.\nPreviously there were only two roads in, from &lt;a href=\"Duskwood\"&gt;Duskwood&lt;/a&gt; (via Deadwind Pass) and the Blasted Lands. With the newly settled goblin resort town of &lt;a href=\"Bogpaddle\"&gt;Bogpaddle&lt;/a&gt; in the northeast, a road was built along the Redridge Mountains, allowing for fast transport from the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Steppes\"&gt;Burning Steppes&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nOriginally, the Swamp of Sorrows was the northern part of an enormous swampland called the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Morass\"&gt;Black Morass&lt;/a&gt;. After the fall of the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20Empire\"&gt;Gurubashi Empire&lt;/a&gt;, a renegade faction of trolls, the &lt;a href=\"Atal%27ai\"&gt;Atal'ai&lt;/a&gt;, fled into the swamp and built a large temple, the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Atal%27Hakkar\"&gt;Temple of Atal'Hakkar&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt; of the green dragonflight learned of their evil plans, drowned the temple into the largest bog, and sent several members of her flight to guard the ruins. \nFirst War.\nYears later, in the southern part of the Morass, the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; was opened, and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; invaded the area. The orcs built two settlements and an outpost in the Swamp of Sorrows, respectively &lt;a href=\"Rockard\"&gt;Rockard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stonard\"&gt;Stonard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kyross\"&gt;Kyross&lt;/a&gt;. These towns, and later &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt; farther north, were the Horde's main bases during the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt; against the humans. During the war, Rockard and Kyross were destroyed and Stonard was severely damaged. \nSecond War.\nWith the implosion of the Dark Portal during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, the southern part of the morass was separated and transformed into the barren &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt;. The implosion left some groups of &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; on Azeroth, forever changed by the disaster. Most of them went mad from homesickness and the separation from their land, transforming into the hostile &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Ones%20%28organization%29\"&gt;Lost Ones&lt;/a&gt;. A small group, calling themselves &lt;a href=\"Broken%20exiles\"&gt;Broken exiles&lt;/a&gt;, managed to escape that fate and struggle along.\nThe northern part of the Black Morass was named the Swamp of Sorrows, in honor of those who had died during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, and the southern part was named the Blasted Lands. \nWorld of Warcraft.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, assumed command of the Horde, the old outpost of &lt;a href=\"Stonard\"&gt;Stonard&lt;/a&gt; was rebuilt by the orcs to its former glory. Researchers have come to study and exploit ancient magical artifacts, as well as the abundant flora and fauna of the swamp.\nFollowing the crash of the &lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt;, some draenei arrived to help their broken cousins, staying neutral towards the Horde and building the small village of &lt;a href=\"The%20Harborage\"&gt;The Harborage&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Shattering\"&gt;Shattering&lt;/a&gt;, two new settlements were founded in the swamp: The resort town of &lt;a href=\"Bogpaddle\"&gt;Bogpaddle&lt;/a&gt; in the northeast run by goblins from &lt;a href=\"Gadgetzan\"&gt;Gadgetzan&lt;/a&gt;, and the human outpost of &lt;a href=\"Marshtide%20Watch\"&gt;Marshtide Watch&lt;/a&gt;, set up to combat the increasing Horde presence in the area. The Alliance have begun taking an aggressive stance against the local Horde, starting by pushing for the destruction of &lt;a href=\"Stonard\"&gt;Stonard&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"The%20Harborage\"&gt;The Harborage&lt;/a&gt; at some point became hostile towards the Horde.\nGeography.\nThe swamp is aptly named, as water from the ocean estuary encrusts fallen logs and rocks with salt deposits. The road rises mere inches from the water, painstakingly built to allow travel through this wretched area. This stagnant land is made worse by the jaguars, the hulking bog beasts and the crocolisks, many-toothed beasts that lurk at the water\u2019s edge waiting for travelers.\nThe Swamp of Sorrows contains no raid dungeons or battlegrounds. The &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Atal%27Hakkar\"&gt;Temple of Atal'Hakkar&lt;/a&gt; (aka the Sunken Temple), an instanced dungeon for adventurers levels 50-60, can be found in the eastern part of the zone. &lt;a href=\"Bogpaddle\"&gt;Bogpaddle&lt;/a&gt;, north of the Sunken Temple, is a &lt;a href=\"neutral\"&gt;neutral&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;-operated town. The Horde's outpost of &lt;a href=\"Stonard\"&gt;Stonard&lt;/a&gt; can also be found in this zone, as well as the Alliance's recently built &lt;a href=\"Marshtide%20Watch\"&gt;Marshtide Watch&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Harborage\"&gt;Harborage&lt;/a&gt; is a small village of draenei &lt;a href=\"broken\"&gt;broken&lt;/a&gt; who pre-&lt;a href=\"Shattering\"&gt;Shattering&lt;/a&gt; used to deal with both the Horde and the Alliance, but have since become hostile to the Horde.\nMaps and subregions.\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//wow.gamepressure.com/map.asp%3FID%3D4\"&gt;Topographic map of pre-Cataclysm Swamp of Sorrows&lt;/a&gt;\nQuests.\nNeutral Intro.\nChapter 1: Bogpaddle.\nAdventurers of both factions were initially sent to &lt;a href=\"Bogpaddle\"&gt;Bogpaddle&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Steamwheedle%20Cartel\"&gt;Steamwheedle Cartel&lt;/a&gt; settlement established shortly after the &lt;a href=\"Shattering\"&gt;Shattering&lt;/a&gt; located on the northeastern edge of the region. After arriving in Bogpaddle, the leader of the settlement &lt;a href=\"Trade%20Baron%20Silversnap\"&gt;Trade Baron Silversnap&lt;/a&gt; sent the adventurer on a variety of errands to maintain and secure the Cartel's presence there. After Bogpaddle's immediate security was ensured, Silversnap sent the adventurer to assist &lt;a href=\"Crazy%20Larry\"&gt;Crazy Larry&lt;/a&gt; in determining who attacked their ships and retaliating. Larry asked the adventurer to kill the &lt;a href=\"gilblins\"&gt;gilblins&lt;/a&gt; that attacked their crew and return anything of value from the corpses of the fallen and their ship still parked in the bay.\nChapter 2: Temple of Atal'Hakkar.\nAfter returning, Larry told the adventurer that Silversnap had dropped by and asked him to send the adventurer to their herbalist &lt;a href=\"Baba%20Bogbrew\"&gt;Baba Bogbrew&lt;/a&gt; Baba told the adventurer that the murlocs and other aquatic creatures of the swamp seemed to be behaving strangely. The adventurer put some of the murlocs down and traced the strange behavior to a &lt;a href=\"Faceless%20One\"&gt;Faceless One&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Hr%27nglth%20the%20Lost\"&gt;Hr'nglth the Lost&lt;/a&gt; in a nearby cave. After the aberration was defeated, Baba sent the adventurer to speak to the green dragon &lt;a href=\"Itharius\"&gt;Itharius&lt;/a&gt; who had visited her recently and was investigating the encroaching &lt;a href=\"wind%20serpent\"&gt;wind serpent&lt;/a&gt;s from the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Atal%27Hakkar\"&gt;Temple of Atal'Hakkar&lt;/a&gt;. Itharius lamented that the &lt;a href=\"Atal%27ai\"&gt;Atal'ai&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s could easily corrupt and enslave him as they had corrupted other members of the &lt;a href=\"Green%20Dragonflight\"&gt;Green Dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;. Because the mortal would not be susceptible to their methods, Itharius tasked the hero with recovering artifacts the the trolls used to corrupt the other dragons, which he would use to communicate with the adventurer inside the temple. Itharius directed the adventurer through the temple to slay the leaders of the Atal'ai. While &lt;a href=\"Jammal%27an%20the%20Prophet\"&gt;Jammal'an the Prophet&lt;/a&gt; escaped, the defeat of the others provided Itharius the necessary security to enter the temple personally.\nAlliance Fork.\nChapter 3: Battle of the Bloodmire.\nAfter the events in the Temple, Itharius asked the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; adventurer to warn their faction's nearby settlement &lt;a href=\"Marshtide%20Watch\"&gt;Marshtide Watch&lt;/a&gt; of the threat still posed by the remaining &lt;a href=\"Atal%27ai\"&gt;Atal'ai&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s. Upon arriving at the fort, the adventurer was informed by &lt;a href=\"Joanna%20Blueheart\"&gt;Joanna Blueheart&lt;/a&gt; that there were more pressing matters--the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; was rebuilding the town of &lt;a href=\"Stonard\"&gt;Stonard&lt;/a&gt; to the South and the Alliance needed to remove the town from area. The adventurer was immediately sent off to the ongoing battle, killing many &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"grunt\"&gt;grunt&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"peon\"&gt;peon&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAs the battle escalated, the orc &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s began to summon in &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s to assist their war effort. Blueheart ordered the adventurer to thin the ogres' numbers and close the gateways the orcs used to summon them to the battlefield. Because of this, the humans gained the upper hand and were able to push into Stonard itself. The adventurer assisted the attack, crippling Stonard's defenses. Blueheart did warn the adventurer, however, that their goal was to cripple the village to make the orcs surrender, not slaughter and raze out of bloodlust or desire for revenge.\nChapter 4: The Harborage.\nAfter the battle, the &lt;a href=\"broken\"&gt;broken&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Holaaru\"&gt;Holaaru&lt;/a&gt; asked the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; adventurer to slay some of the &lt;a href=\"lost%20one\"&gt;lost one&lt;/a&gt;s that had formed a village nearby and gather the valuable crystals they were hoarding. Upon returning, Holaaru asked the adventurer to deliver the crystals to the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"anchorite\"&gt;anchorite&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Anchorite%20Avuun\"&gt;Avuun&lt;/a&gt; in the broken village of &lt;a href=\"The%20Harborage\"&gt;The Harborage&lt;/a&gt; nearby. Avuun had come to find a way to cure the broken of their affliction but was now watching over a sick friend and, Holaaru suspected, might be able to heal him with the crystals. The crystals proved little use, so Avuun asked the adventure to gather a variety of reagents from the swamp to save his friend &lt;a href=\"Magtoor\"&gt;Magtoor&lt;/a&gt;.\nUltimately, however, none of these remedies was successful and Magtoor's condition worsened. In Magtoor's final moments, the Prophet &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt; arrived through a portal from the &lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt; to comfort him and the grieving anchorite. Avuun was taken aback by the prophet's compassion to not only visit a single broken in his dying moments but to do so when the Prophet likely had so many other pressing matters to attend to. Avuun swore to continue his research in Magtoor's memory as Magtoor passed into the Light.\nHorde Fork.\nChapter 3: Battle of the Bloodmire.\nAfter the events in the Temple, Itharius asked the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; adventurer to warn their faction's nearby settlement &lt;a href=\"Stonard\"&gt;Stonard&lt;/a&gt; of the threat still posed by the remaining &lt;a href=\"Atal%27ai\"&gt;Atal'ai&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s. Upon arriving at the town, the adventurer was informed by the town's military leader &lt;a href=\"Dispatch%20Commander%20Ruag\"&gt;Ruag&lt;/a&gt; that there were more pressing matters--the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; was attacking Stonard unprovoked! The adventurer was immediately sent off to the ongoing battle, killing many &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"footmen\"&gt;footmen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"peasant\"&gt;peasant&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAs the battle escalated, the human &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s began to summon in &lt;a href=\"knight\"&gt;knight&lt;/a&gt;s to assist their war effort. Ruag ordered the adventurer to thin the knights' numbers and close the portals the humans used to summon them to the battlefield. Nonetheless, the humans gained the upper hand and were able to push into Stonard itself. The adventurer assisted the defenders in driving the humans back, but the victory was likely only temporary. Ruag suspected a new offensive would come soon and asked the adventurer to gather a report from his scout &lt;a href=\"Neeka%20Bloodscar\"&gt;Neeka Bloodscar&lt;/a&gt; that might help in preparing for the next siege.\nChapter 4: Splinterspear Junction.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; adventurer found Neeka at &lt;a href=\"Splinterspear%20Junction\"&gt;Splinterspear Junction&lt;/a&gt; to the Northwest in deathwatch over her mate &lt;a href=\"Helgrum%20the%20Swift\"&gt;Helgrum&lt;/a&gt;, evidently gravely wounded in a recent &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; attack. Neeka begged the Horde adventurer to gather a variety of reagents from the swamp to make Helgrum's last moments less painful.\nAfter returning with these, Neeka asked one additional favor of the adventurer: to put down the beast &lt;a href=\"Duskfang\"&gt;Duskfang&lt;/a&gt; which Helgrum had sought to hunt in life but never had the opportunity to. If Helgrum's death was inevitable, the Beast's death would grant him to the opportunity to hunt it in the next world. After doing so, the adventurer watched Helgrum insist Neeka be strong for him as he died. Neeka resolved to be strong for his sake and sent the adventurer back to Ruag with her report on the situation in the East, but omitted any mention of the tragedy her mate had suffered out of desire to not burden Ruag with additional worries.\nIn Warcraft III.\nOnce a tribe of &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt;s stubbornly held its own against foul creatures invading the swamp. Unfortunately, they weren't able to hold out long. The tileset is called \"Felwood\".\nIn the RPG.\nThe Swamp of Sorrows is not for the faint of heart. Monsters thrive in this smelly bog, making travel difficult and unrewarding. There are few settlements and a lot of stagnant water with thriving beasts. This swamp is a hunter's paradise. A person could make a sack full of gold with the hides, teeth and organs he finds in this area. Of course, separating these items from their owners is the trick.\nFar distant from civilization, the Swamp of Sorrows is a stagnant marshland of sucking bogs and weeping trees. The ocean seeps into the fen, making the water brackish and ideal for alligators and crocolisks. Salt deposits encrust fallen logs and protruding rocks. Bog beasts slog through the interior. Despite these dangers, the Horde has taken advantage of the region\u2019s distance from Stormwind to establish a colony on the continent. A group of draenei, displaced from their homeworld, also has a settlement here and routinely sends assassins and saboteurs against the orcs. A flight of green dragons guards a ruin called the Lost Temple, an ancient troll edifice that channels demonic energy and drives living creatures to madness and violence.\nHistory.\nThe Swamp of Sorrows is largely left out of Azeroth's histories, at least those written by the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. Its proximity to the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; and its remote location from the Alliance, the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; make it a suitable place for the &lt;a href=\"Lost%20One\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s to settle. The &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; had to trek through the southwestern corner during their rampage across the continent and felt the need to set a stronghold there, &lt;a href=\"Stonard\"&gt;Stonard&lt;/a&gt;. The draenei discovered that the northern swamp's remoteness suited them so they built &lt;a href=\"Fallow%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Fallow Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe only notable event that happened in the past is the amazing creation of the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Atal%27Hakkar\"&gt;Lost Temple&lt;/a&gt;, the watertight demonic temple that houses something terrible. The &lt;a href=\"Green%20dragonflight\"&gt;Green dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; guards it closely to protect others from falling to corruption.\nA fledgling &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;'s spell went awry and attracted the swamp's monsters, as well as some of the demons wandering north of the Blasted Lands, to Stonard. The draenei heard of the orcs' vulnerability and attempted to take advantage of this opening. Stonard was under siege, and the orcs needed all the assistance they could get to survive. Thy even accepted Alliance help if it was offered respectfully.\nAt some point, &lt;a href=\"Duncan%20Pike\"&gt;Duncan Pike&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zul%27armon\"&gt;Zul'armon&lt;/a&gt; were in the swamps.\nPeople and culture.\nThe people in this area, when you can find them, are different from most regions. While you know what to expect from the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s, the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; and even the orcs, surprises await in the swamp.\nThe orcs here are not only more reasonable than the ones you can find in the Burning Steppes, but they also seem smarter. &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; had ordered them to make peace with the Alliance but since they did not welcome orcs in that continent, peace was difficult, but they did what they could. To the north you can find the vicious draenei who sequester themselves from outsiders, and the corrupt green dragons are to the east. The quiet marshes are apparently dangerous for reasons other than the sucking mud and the monsters.\nGeography.\nThe swamp lies along &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28continent%29\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s eastern coast, bordered by the &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Deadwind%20Pass\"&gt;Deadwind Pass&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt;. No main roads run through the sodden lands, and there are few reasons to visit the place. Its sparse inhabitants include &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s of a different ilk than those from the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Steppes\"&gt;Burning Steppes&lt;/a&gt;; some vile &lt;a href=\"green%20dragon\"&gt;green dragon&lt;/a&gt;s; and the &lt;a href=\"Lost%20One\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;, mortal enemies of the orcs who also call themselves the &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Ones%20%28organization%29\"&gt;Lost Ones&lt;/a&gt;. Their home on Azeroth lies within the Swamp of Sorrows, though some have begun to travel beyond the Swamp's borders in recent times.\nThe murky region is humid and rains nearly all the time, almost as if it is a displaced part of &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt;. The ocean seeps into the swamp, making it a salty marsh. Massive, drippy trees rise from the swamp and encourage the air to hold in more moisture, making it as miserable as a rainforest. The swamp is aptly named, as the water from the ocean estuary encrusts fallen logs and rocks with salt deposits. The road rises mere inches from the water, painstakingly built to allow travel through this wretched area. This stagnant land is made worse by the &lt;a href=\"jaguar\"&gt;jaguar&lt;/a&gt;s, the hulking &lt;a href=\"bog%20beast\"&gt;bog beast&lt;/a&gt;s and the &lt;a href=\"crocolisk\"&gt;crocolisk&lt;/a&gt;s, manytoothed beasts that lurk at the water's edge waiting for travelers.\nSettlements are few in this region, as the Swamp of Sorrows is a mostly forgotten area. The settlements that do survive here are populated with hardy people who wish not to be disturbed."}

Unfortunately, most of them were driven mad due to homesickness, and attack all on sight. They routinely send assassins and saboteurs against the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe orc outpost of &lt;a href=\"Stonard\"&gt;Stonard&lt;/a&gt;, built during the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt; and rebuilt under &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;'s rule, is the only civilized town in the swamp. It serves as a base for the Horde. While being rather isolated from other Horde settlements, it has gained new interest with the re-opening of the Dark Portal.\nMost of the swamp is dominated by nature. Wild beasts like crocolisks and &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20Jaguar\"&gt;jaguars&lt;/a&gt; hunt for prey, and ancient bog beasts wander through the land. Aggressive &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt; tribes populate the coast and nearby caves.\nThe Swamp of Sorrows stands on the eastern side of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28continent%29\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, east of &lt;a href=\"Deadwind%20Pass%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Deadwind Pass&lt;/a&gt;, north of the &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt; and south of the &lt;a href=\"Badlands%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Badlands&lt;/a&gt;. The only established foot route to it is through &lt;a href=\"Duskwood%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Duskwood&lt;/a&gt;, then &lt;a href=\"Deadwind%20Pass%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Deadwind Pass&lt;/a&gt;, although it is also possible to gain entry from &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt; by climbing through the peaks south of &lt;a href=\"Render%27s%20Valley\"&gt;Render's Valley&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nOriginally, the Swamp of Sorrows was the northern part of an enormous swampland called the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Morass\"&gt;Black Morass&lt;/a&gt;. After the fall of the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20Empire\"&gt;Gurubashi Empire&lt;/a&gt;, a renegade faction of trolls, the &lt;a href=\"Atal%27ai\"&gt;Atal'ai&lt;/a&gt;, fled into the swamp and built a large temple, the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Atal%27Hakkar\"&gt;Temple of Atal'Hakkar&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt; of the green dragonflight learned of their evil plans, drowned the temple into the largest bog, and sent several members of her flight to guard the ruins. \nYears later, in the southern part of the Morass, the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; was opened, and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; invaded the area. The orcs built two settlements and an outpost in the Swamp of Sorrows, respectively &lt;a href=\"Rockard\"&gt;Rockard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stonard\"&gt;Stonard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kyross\"&gt;Kyross&lt;/a&gt;. These towns, and later &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt; farther north, were the Horde's main bases during the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt; against the humans. During the war, Rockard and Kyross were destroyed and Stonard was severely damaged. \nWith the implosion of the Dark Portal during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, the southern part of the morass was separated and transformed into the barren &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt;. The implosion left some groups of &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; on Azeroth, forever changed by the disaster. Most of them went mad from homesickness and the separation from their land, transforming into the hostile &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Ones%20%28organization%29\"&gt;Lost Ones&lt;/a&gt;. A small group of &lt;a href=\"Broken%20exiles\"&gt;Broken exiles&lt;/a&gt; managed to escape that fate and struggle along.\nThe northern part of the Black Morass is now called the Swamp of Sorrows and the southern part is the Blasted Lands.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, assumed command of the Horde, the old outpost of &lt;a href=\"Stonard\"&gt;Stonard&lt;/a&gt; was rebuilt by the orcs to its former glory. Researchers have come to study and exploit ancient magical artifacts, as well as the abundant flora and fauna of the swamp.\nBattle.net map.\nOnce a tribe of &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt;s stubbornly held its own against foul creatures invading the swamp. Unfortunately, they weren't able to hold out long. The tileset is called \"Felwood\".\nGeography.\nThe swamp is aptly named, as water from the ocean estuary encrusts fallen logs and rocks with salt deposits. The road rises mere inches from the water, painstakingly built to allow travel through this wretched area. This stagnant land is made worse by the jaguars, the hulking bog beasts and the crocolisks, many-toothed beasts that lurk at the water\u2019s edge waiting for travelers.\nThe Swamp of Sorrows contains no raid dungeons or battlegrounds. The &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Atal%27Hakkar\"&gt;Temple of Atal'Hakkar&lt;/a&gt; (aka the Sunken Temple), an instanced dungeon for adventurers levels 50-56, can be found in the eastern part of the zone. &lt;a href=\"Sorrowmurk\"&gt;Sorrowmurk&lt;/a&gt;, east of the Sunken Temple, is a micro-dungeon full of elite &lt;a href=\"dragonspawn\"&gt;dragonspawn&lt;/a&gt;. The orc outpost, &lt;a href=\"Stonard\"&gt;Stonard&lt;/a&gt;, can also be found in this zone, and is a &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; travel hub (their nearest one to the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;), and the location of the master alchemist trainer. &lt;a href=\"Harborage\"&gt;Harborage&lt;/a&gt; is a small village of draenei &lt;a href=\"broken\"&gt;broken&lt;/a&gt;, who deal with both the Horde and the Alliance.\nAlthough the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; has no travel hub in this zone, both &lt;a href=\"Darkshire\"&gt;Darkshire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nethergarde%20Keep\"&gt;Nethergarde Keep&lt;/a&gt; are valuable alternatives as their locations lets one run to the Swamp without encountering any enemies on the way.\nNotable characters.\nSwamp of Sorrows is home to several characters of note. At Stonard, &lt;a href=\"Fel%27zerul\"&gt;Fel'zerul&lt;/a&gt; seeks aid in the battle against the Atal'ai. Near the entrance to the Blasted Lands, the &lt;a href=\"Fallen%20Hero%20of%20the%20Horde\"&gt;Fallen Hero of the Horde&lt;/a&gt; attempts to cleanse the corruption that stems from a grand demon to the south. And southeast of Stonesplinter Junction, &lt;a href=\"Watcher%20Biggs\"&gt;Watcher Biggs&lt;/a&gt; sends bold adventurers into the swamp in search of his lost shipment.\nQuests.\nQuests in the Swamp of Sorrows are few and far between, stretched out across level 35-55. A few quests in this zone lead to the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Atal%27Hakkar\"&gt;Temple of Atal'Hakkar&lt;/a&gt;, and so merit a visit. For the most part, however, this zone is seldom seen as a prime questing area.\nInspiration.\nThe name Swamp of Sorrows is most likely an homage to The Neverending Story's The Swamp of Sadness, where Atreyu loses his horse Artax."}

The original teleport spire remains in the game, but is no longer accessible due to it being underground.\nAll original quests remained in game until &lt;a href=\"Patch%204.0.3a\"&gt;Patch 4.0.3a&lt;/a&gt;, two years after the removal of original Naxxramas. Only &lt;a href=\"Echoes%20of%20War\"&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; quest remained completable. No new quests were added.\nThe &lt;a href=\"attunement\"&gt;attunement&lt;/a&gt; requirement, and quest, have been removed.\nInstance center.\nRather than the four instance portals, the area that is the summoning stone currently used to be part of the instance. The holes you fly through to reach the stone were windows that allowed you to look at Plaguewood below Naxx. A video of the teleport spire and inside lower middle section can be found here (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWox11uu9OY).\n&lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Tarsis%20Kir-Moldir\"&gt;Archmage Tarsis Kir-Moldir&lt;/a&gt; has been removed.\nYou formerly could not zone out of Naxx upon entering.\nUntil &lt;a href=\"patch%203.3\"&gt;patch 3.3&lt;/a&gt;, you could not zone out of &lt;a href=\"Frostwyrm%20Lair\"&gt;Frostwyrm Lair&lt;/a&gt; upon entering.\n&lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; did not voice the death of &lt;a href=\"Mr.%20Bigglesworth\"&gt;Mr. Bigglesworth&lt;/a&gt;, however, you could still read the /yell emote which remains unchanged.\nThe original version of Naxx offered &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt; reputation for those who were not yet exalted. The new version offers no reputation for any faction.\nGeneral changes.\nAll gear has been updated from level 60 to level 80. Some new gear use updated models based off their original counterparts.\nMobs have been updated from level 60-63 to 80-82.\n&lt;a href=\"Construct%20Quarter\"&gt;Construct Quarter&lt;/a&gt; had no name, but was called \"Abomination Wing\" by players. It should also be noted that the music files for this quarter were titled \"Abomination Wing\" which is likely what gave it the unofficial name of Abomination Wing.\n&lt;a href=\"Military%20Quarter\"&gt;Military Quarter&lt;/a&gt; had no name, but was called \"Death Knight Wing\" by players. Although unlike the other three wings, there was no sound files with the name \"Death Knight Wing\", but rather the name \"Walking\", so it can be assumed \"Death Knight Wing\" was purely player created.\n&lt;a href=\"Arachnid%20Quarter\"&gt;Arachnid Quarter&lt;/a&gt; had no name, but was called \"Spider Wing\" by players. It should also be noted that the music files for this quarter were titled \"Spider Wing\" which is likely what gave it the unofficial name of Spider Wing.\n&lt;a href=\"Plague%20Quarter\"&gt;Plague Quarter&lt;/a&gt; had no name, but was called \"Plague Wing\" by players. It should also be noted that the music files for this quarter were titled \"Plague Wing\" which how players came up with the original name. Unlike the other ones the \"Plague\" part of the title was unchanged by Blizzard.\n&lt;a href=\"Word%20of%20Thawing\"&gt;Word of Thawing&lt;/a&gt; no longer drops off trash mobs.\n&lt;a href=\"Wartorn%20Scrap%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Wartorn Scrap&lt;/a&gt;s no longer drop off trash mobs.\n&lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Rune\"&gt;Frozen Rune&lt;/a&gt;s have been removed.\n&lt;a href=\"Splinter%20of%20Atiesh\"&gt;Splinter of Atiesh&lt;/a&gt; have been removed.\nOuter Ring mobs were not mobs from said wing, but rather mobs from every wing (&lt;a href=\"ghoul\"&gt;ghoul&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Death%20Knight%20%28mob%29\"&gt;death knights&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"shade\"&gt;shade&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"skeletal%20mage\"&gt;skeletal mage&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"plaguehound\"&gt;plaguehound&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt;s, etc.).\nBosses often yelled more emotes. Some of the emotes they yelled have been removed from the new version (Example: Kel'Thuzad: I will freeze the blood in your veins.).\nAOE tanking would often result in a wipe, unless a pull was designed for it (Such as the Poisonous Skitterers).\n&lt;a href=\"Master%20Craftsman%20Omarion\"&gt;Master Craftsman Omarion&lt;/a&gt;, a crafting recipe teacher, has been removed from his prison in the Death Knight Wing. He did not reappear in the game until after the Cataclysm. \nA general note, all that \"unused\" area in the outer rings originally had frozen runes in them, giving guilds a reason to clear those areas (As well as extra trash mobs which dropped war-torn scraps needed for Tier 3 gear)\nModel changes.\n&lt;a href=\"Death%20Knight%20%28mob%29\"&gt;Death Knight&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Deathknight%20Captain\"&gt;Deathknight Captain&lt;/a&gt;s did not use Dwarf/Troll/Human/Forsaken and Tauren/Night Elf/Blood Elf models respectively, but rather male cultist human models.\n&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Touched%20Warrior\"&gt;Dark Touched Warrior&lt;/a&gt; (Whirlwind guys) used a light armored forsaken model carrying buckets.\n&lt;a href=\"Necro%20Knight\"&gt;Necro Knight&lt;/a&gt;s used the pre-BC skeleton mage model (Like the ones in Plaguewood).\nAll mounted Deathknights used the Baron Rivendare model.\nGhouls in the Plague Quarter/Wing used the pre-wrath ghoul model.\nNoth's adds \"Plagued Warriors\" used the standard skeleton model, like what you get when you use Noggenfogger.\nNoth's adds \"Plagued Champions\" used the pre-BC skeletal warrior model (Armored skeletons that you see throughout various areas in the Plaguelands).\nNoth's adds \"Plagued Guardians\" used the standard necro mage model (See Necro Knight).\n&lt;a href=\"Plague%20Beast\"&gt;Plague Beast&lt;/a&gt;s used the \"Bog\" or \"Moss\" Beast model, and also had a dark green haze around them.\n&lt;a href=\"Mutated%20Grub\"&gt;Mutated Grub&lt;/a&gt;s used the standard maggot model.\n&lt;a href=\"Naxxramas%20Acolyte\"&gt;Naxxramas Acolyte&lt;/a&gt;s &amp; &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas%20Cultist\"&gt;Naxxramas Cultist&lt;/a&gt; wore a red and purple robe that was less elaborate looking.\n&lt;a href=\"Stitched%20Giant\"&gt;Stitched Giant&lt;/a&gt;s: Originally looked like standard abominations with the purple color scheme. They also changed their name which was originally (&lt;a href=\"Stitched%20Spewer\"&gt;Stitched Spewer&lt;/a&gt;).\nAdded and removed mobs.\nAdded mobs.\n&lt;a href=\"Marauding%20Geist\"&gt;Marauding Geist&lt;/a&gt;: Runs in packs of around 8-10, will jump on to the 1st target they see.\n&lt;a href=\"Stitched%20Colossus\"&gt;Stitched Colossus&lt;/a&gt;: Very large abominations before Thaddius' room, they do an AOE knockback.\n&lt;a href=\"Venom%20Stalker\"&gt;Venom Stalker&lt;/a&gt;: Spiders that travel in pairs and apply a poison DOT.\n&lt;a href=\"Vigilant%20Shade\"&gt;Vigilant Shade&lt;/a&gt;: Invisible shades that patrol the Outer Ring. Does an AOE shadowbolt.\n&lt;a href=\"Baron%20Rivendare\"&gt;Baron Rivendare&lt;/a&gt;: Replaced Highlord Mograine, more info in The Four Horsemen section.\nRemoved mobs.\n&lt;a href=\"Highlord%20Mograine\"&gt;Highlord Mograine&lt;/a&gt;: Replaced by Baron Rivendare, more info in The Four Horsemen section.\n&lt;a href=\"Death%20Touched%20Warrior\"&gt;Death Touched Warrior&lt;/a&gt;: Lightly armored dwarf enemies wielding hammers.\nAppeared around the forge area. I don't remember if they did anything special.\n&lt;a href=\"Doom%20Touched%20Warrior\"&gt;Doom Touched Warrior&lt;/a&gt;: Trainee Deathknights in the Military Quarter. They were attacking the training dummies you see (The ones before Instructor Razuvious). They would do amusing emotes such as /flex or /chicken to other NPCs in the area.\n&lt;a href=\"Death%20Lord\"&gt;Death Lord&lt;/a&gt;: A very powerful version of the Deathknight Cavalier. Had a stacking deadly unholy aura and needed to be seperated from the main group. Came in packs with Deathknight Cavaliers.\n&lt;a href=\"Deathknight%20Vindicator\"&gt;Deathknight Vindicator&lt;/a&gt;: Essentially a weaker version of the Death Lord. They traveled in packs of 2.\n&lt;a href=\"Necro%20Knight%20Guardian\"&gt;Necro Knight Guardian&lt;/a&gt;: An AOE happy Necro Knight. Used lots of AOE's (Flamestrike, Blast Wave, Frost Nova, Cone of Cold, Arcane Explosion, as well as blink).\n&lt;a href=\"Necro%20Stalker\"&gt;Necro Stalker&lt;/a&gt;: Replaced by the Venom Stalker. Back in pre-BC their poison DOT was far more deadly. They patrolled the Outer Ring in pairs.\n&lt;a href=\"Necropolis%20Acolyte\"&gt;Necropolis Acolyte&lt;/a&gt;: These guys used the Acolyte model you see in places like Stratholme (Inside the Ziggurats). They did an AOE shadowbolt among other things. They patrolled the Outer Ring.\n&lt;a href=\"Plagued%20Gargoyle\"&gt;Plagued Gargoyle&lt;/a&gt;: The same as the Stoneskin Gargoyle, they patrolled in pairs around the Outer Ring.\n&lt;a href=\"Spirit%20of%20Naxxramas\"&gt;Spirit of Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt;: Uses the shade model and patrolled the Outer Ring and had stealth detect, NOT the Vigilant Shade.\n&lt;a href=\"Plagued%20Deathhound\"&gt;Plagued Deathhound&lt;/a&gt;: A Plaguehound that appeared in the Outer Ring. Did an AOE knock back howl.\n&lt;a href=\"Risen%20Deathknight\"&gt;Risen Deathknight&lt;/a&gt;: Like the Dark Touched Warrior, they looked like lightly armored forsaken, except they used a pitchfork instead of a bucket.\n&lt;a href=\"Stitched%20Spewer\"&gt;Stitched Spewer&lt;/a&gt;: Abominations that appeared before Grobbulus, they shot Slime Bolts and would also do an uppercut that would knock you up in to the air and cause you to take considerable fall damage (The more players in melee range, the lower you got shot up).\nTrash mob changes.\nAll trash was more dangerous.\nPlague trash ability changes.\n&lt;a href=\"Infectious%20Ghoul\"&gt;Infectious Ghoul&lt;/a&gt;: They had a short-ranged stun. Wrath gave them a rend and disease debuff but lost the stun.\n&lt;a href=\"Plague%20Slime\"&gt;Plague Slime&lt;/a&gt;: Hit harder, kiting was recommended.\n&lt;a href=\"Stoneskin%20Gargoyle\"&gt;Stoneskin Gargoyle&lt;/a&gt;: Timer on Stoneskin was harder to beat. Healed to 100%. The first gargoyle in the Plague Wing did not have Acid Volley. \nThe hallway before Heigan was a gauntlet (i.e., constantly respawning yard trash), and Heigan would engage the moment you stepped inside his room.\nAbomination trash ability changes.\n&lt;a href=\"Patchwork%20Golem\"&gt;Patchwork Golem&lt;/a&gt;: Did a dangerous 360-degree cleave, in addition, the cleave would cause chain damage (such as C'Thuns Eye-Beam) in addition to the stun.\n&lt;a href=\"Bile%20Retcher\"&gt;Bile Retcher&lt;/a&gt;: Bile Vomit was actually dangerous and shouldn't face the raid. They did a chain-targeting knockback that dumped aggro.\n&lt;a href=\"Stitched%20Spewer\"&gt;Stitched Spewer&lt;/a&gt; has been replaced with &lt;a href=\"Stitched%20Giant\"&gt;Stitched Giant&lt;/a&gt;. The original version shot Slime Bolts and would also do an uppercut that would knock you up in to the air and cause you to take considerable fall damage (The more players in melee range, the lower you got shot up).\nThe lightning totems that the &lt;a href=\"Living%20Monstrosity\"&gt;Living Monstrosity&lt;/a&gt; (Wights) placed needed to be killed ASAP or they would deal immense damage.\nSpider trash ability changes.\nThe poisons and curses you got from trash mobs needed to be cured ASAP, or the target would likely die due to massive poison damage or reduced healing from the curse.\nSpider's still had the deathgrip mechanic, so you needed to pull carefully (1 tank getting pulled in had a good chance of dying if the rest of the raid was behind).\n&lt;a href=\"Necro%20Stalker\"&gt;Necro Stalker&lt;/a&gt; has been replaced with &lt;a href=\"Venom%20Stalker\"&gt;Venom Stalker&lt;/a&gt;.\nDeath knight trash ability changes.\nDeathknight: They would raise any dead humanoid or undead corpses nearby in to a skeleton called \"Deathchill Servant\", in addition, they would do an AOE fear then target the highest threat non-feared player and do a single target fear on them. They also put a curse on targets that nullifies direct healing spells. They didn't use Blood Presence, Death Coil, or Hysteria that the new version does.\n&lt;a href=\"Deathknight%20Captain\"&gt;Deathknight Captain&lt;/a&gt;: Did a dangerous whirlwind that usually spelled death for non-tank melee, they also charged targets.\n&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Touched%20Warrior\"&gt;Dark Touched Warrior&lt;/a&gt;: Dropped aggro every few seconds.\n&lt;a href=\"Deathknight%20Cavalier\"&gt;Deathknight Cavalier&lt;/a&gt;: Would do a 360 degree cleave, would also fear a raid member. Had an unholy aura that stacked damage. They did not dismount when low on life like the new ones do.\n&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Touched%20Warrior\"&gt;Dark Touched Warrior&lt;/a&gt;: Major change, as stated, they were not the armored fighting DKs we see today, but rather weak forsaken wielding a bucket. They would run and try to call for aid from the Skeletal Steeds.\n&lt;a href=\"Bony%20Construct\"&gt;Bony Construct&lt;/a&gt;: Would do a melee chain cleave (Like C'Thuns eye-beam, except only melee ranged). Did an AOE knockback instead of brutal strike.\nBoss changes.\nAll bosses dealt more damage, scaled to level (So, for example, if in Naxx 80 a boss hit a tank for like 20%, it would probably be 60% in the old one).\n&lt;a href=\"Patchwerk\"&gt;Patchwerk&lt;/a&gt;.\nHit MUCH harder (Well, scaled to level).\nEnrage timer was very difficult to make and required very high (For the time) DPS to beat.\nThe fight tested all 3 roles. Tanks needed to be geared enough to survive the hateful strikes, healers needed to be geared enough to keep the tanks up due to the massive damage, and DPS needed to be geared enough to beat the tough enrage timer.\nEnrage timer was 7 minutes instead of 6 (But was harder to beat).\n&lt;a href=\"Grobbulus\"&gt;Grobbulus&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt was normally better to dispel the poison to save the healers some mana (remember going oom was actually an issue then), which means the person infected would actually have to move to reach to a specific spot, in addition, dispelling the poison dealt less damage then waiting it out.\n&lt;a href=\"Gluth\"&gt;Gluth&lt;/a&gt;.\nGluth was not tauntable (Mortal Wound still existed though).\nDid an AOE fear every 20 seconds.\nZombies healed him for about 10% instead of 5%.\nFrenzy needed to be tranq shotted ASAP, or the tank would take a large amount of damage, potentially killing them.\nFaster berserk enrage.\nMore zombies.\n&lt;a href=\"Thaddius\"&gt;Thaddius&lt;/a&gt;.\n~&lt;a href=\"Stalagg\"&gt;Stalagg&lt;/a&gt; &amp; &lt;a href=\"Feugen\"&gt;Feugen&lt;/a&gt;~\nStalagg would always cause crushing blows.\nStalagg would randomly get a power surge buff increasing attack speed by 200%.\nFuegan had an AOE mana drain ability.\nBoth Stalagg and Feugen had a warstomp ability causing moderate damage.\n~Encounter &amp; Thaddius~\nStalagg and Feugen would throw the tanks wherever they were facing, not directly to the opposite platform.\nThe tank switch would dump aggro.\nThaddius hit hard and had a somewhat hard to beat enrage (5 minutes).\nDue to the enrage timer, it was imperative all raid members lived.\nOne person crossing on the polarity shift could potentially cause a wipe.\nPolarity ticks happened faster.\n&lt;a href=\"Anub%27Rekhan\"&gt;Anub'Rekhan&lt;/a&gt;.\nAdds had a cleave ability, as well as Mortal Strike.\nAdds needed to be tanked swapped to avoid the poison DoT stacking too high.\nAdds would web players preventing them from moving (This would hurt with cleave). \nCorpse scarabs were actually dangerous, so if you had more then 1 or 2 people dead, it was pretty much a wipe.\nInsect swarm had a larger range and dealt more damage (Scaled to level of course).\nInsect swarm could be cast quicker, requiring the tank to be more active in moving.\nRaid needed to spread out to avoid too many people getting knocked up from impale.\n&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Widow%20Faerlina\"&gt;Grand Widow Faerlina&lt;/a&gt;.\nRain of fire was far more deadly, as was the poison.\nTanking through the enrage was impossible.\nAdds needed to be MC'ed to dispell the enrage buff.\nCouldn\u2019t AOE tank all the adds.\n&lt;a href=\"Maexxna\"&gt;Maexxna&lt;/a&gt;.\nPoison reduced healing done by 90%.\nShe cocooned more people on average, and the cocoons were more difficult to destroy.\nAoE web stun lasted 8-10 seconds.\n&lt;a href=\"Noth%20the%20Plaguebringer\"&gt;Noth the Plaguebringer&lt;/a&gt;.\nHis curse would instantly kill the raid if everyone was not cured before the time ran out. Curse affected 20 players.\nMore skeletons were raised.\nSkeleton adds were actually competent and needed to be tanked and CCed.\nPlagued Guardians could stun raid members.\n&lt;a href=\"Heigan%20the%20Unclean\"&gt;Heigan the Unclean&lt;/a&gt;.\nHeigan pulled directly when you entered the room.\nDance phase was faster.\nHeigan had an AOE mana burn that would deal damage equal to the amount of mana burned.\nDuring the entire fight, 3 random raid members would be ported to the gauntlet before Loatheb, and needed to get back while evading maggots and eye beam lasers. When reaching the end, one could not run back quickly due to dance mechanics instant killing you.\n&lt;a href=\"Loatheb\"&gt;Loatheb&lt;/a&gt;.\nRather then a 3 second healing window every 20 seconds, Loatheb put a debuff on you that allowed you only 1 heal per minute. The fight required a large amount of consumables as well as effective use of them to beat as most heals needed to be saved for the tank.\nAfter 7 or so minutes, Loatheb would apply his shadow AOE at a MUCH faster rate, which would kill the raid quick, so essentially it was an enrage timer.\nSeeing as he had an \u201cEnrage timer\u201d, using the spores to their full effect was very important.\nSpores would spawn on the opposite side of the room as Loatheb, and raid members needed to be stacked there before they spawned.\nLoatheb would constantly decurse himself.\n&lt;a href=\"Instructor%20Razuvious\"&gt;Instructor Razuvious&lt;/a&gt;.\nInstructors shout used to drain up to 5k mana and dealt damage equal to double the amount of mana drained, needed to be LoSed.\nAfter a MC ended, the understudy would have a debuff preventing them from being MCed for awhile.\nAll 4 understudies needed to be rotated because of the above mechanic.\nUnderstudies used shield wall instead of bone shield.\n&lt;a href=\"Gothik%20the%20Harvester\"&gt;Gothik the Harvester&lt;/a&gt;.\nUndead adds were immune to magic.\nAdds needed to be CCed and taken out in a slow and steady order, to prevent 1 side from building up more, faster.\nAdds actually needed to be tanked and were not AOE fest.\nEven though he only had about 350k HP, his soul harvest stacking debuff applied quick and was very dangerous, so you needed to burn that 350k down very fast.\nAdds would likely still be up when Gothik ported down.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Four%20Horsemen\"&gt;The Four Horsemen&lt;/a&gt;.\nHighlord Mograine was there instead of Baron Rivendare.\nMarks stacked faster and hit harder.\n8 tanks were needed to tank this fight.\nTanks would often need a spell hit rate trinket so that taunt wouldn\u2019t miss.\nIf taunt missed, it would drastically increase a chance of wiping, doing so most of the time.\nAll 4 were \u201cloose\u201d and needed to be tanked in the 4 corners (The 2 in the back wouldn\u2019t stay in the back in other words).\nThe 4H would not move to the 4 corners on their own, they needed to be pulled there.\nAll 4H shield walled at 50% and 20% HP for 20 seconds.\nMarks lasted 75 seconds before removing.\nLady Blaumeux's Void Zones did much more relative damage (2 shotting any non-tank, 3 shotting a tank).\nAfter death, their ghost remains still applying marks.\nMograine dropped the Corrupted Ashbringer.\n&lt;a href=\"Sapphiron\"&gt;Sapphiron&lt;/a&gt;.\nFrost Aura did considerably more damage and all raid members needed very high frost resist.\nDrain Life dealt very high damage, very fast, and healed Sapphiron for a lot more, and needed to be dispelled ASAP.\n&lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;.\nAdd phase was about 2 minutes longer.\nAdds were overall more dangerous.\nKel'Thuzad could not be taunted.\nFrost Blast dealt 130% damage instead of 104%.\nFrostbolt Single would be an instant kill and always needed to be interrupted.\nFrostbolt Volley took more of your average DPS/Healers HP.\nShadow Fissure only had about 3 second warning time instead of 5.\nChains of Kel'Thuzad MCed more people, and also dropped all aggro, and also purposely MCed the MT.\n&lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Icecrown\"&gt;Guardians of Icecrown&lt;/a&gt; dumped aggro every 15 seconds and got a stack of blood tap every time they changed targets.\n5 Guardians of Icecrown came, instead of 4.\nGuardians of Icecrown hit hard, and you could not tank more than 1 without dying.\nGuardians of Icecrown needed to be CCed. You needed to shackle 3, but doing a 4th would cause Kel'Thuzad to dispel all 4 shackles.\nKel'Thuzad was replaced by a new voice actor."}

{"id": "44912", "revid": "4133", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=44912", "title": "Changing a button's action slot ID", "text": "Sometimes you would like to control the action a button will start when it is clicked. Maybe you want to add extra buttons, maybe you just want to control the behavior of existing ones. I will tell you in a moment how to do that, but first you should know something about how the default UI handles its buttons.\nIMPORTANT: Recommendations involving changing ActionButton_GetPagedID do not work after WoW 2.0\nButton Handling in the Default UI.\nWorld of Warcraft supplies the player with 6 action bars, each having 12 buttons. Some classes, like warriors, rogues and druids have a few more bars due to their stances. have you ever noticed that the lower left bar changes its actions when you go in stealth or in battle stance? When changing stances, there are no buttons hidden or shown. Whatever stance you are in, the buttons remain tight at their position. What's actually changing are the action slot IDs of the buttons. You can read a bit more about this here: &lt;a href=\"ActionSlot\"&gt;ActionSlot&lt;/a&gt; API Type. Two buttons having the same action ID means they are twins. If you drag an action onto one of them, the other one will adopt this action, too. This is because the potions, spells, abilities, macros, etc. on your buttons are not bound to the button itself, but to its action ID.\nSo, how does a button know its action ID? Let's look at Blizzard's ActionButton.lua, which you can obtain by downloading the Blizzard Interface Customization Tools here: http://www.blizzard.com/support/wow/?id=aww01669p (after installing this, you can find ActionButton.lua in \"/Blizzard Interface Data/FrameXML\"). The functions in this file handle the behaviour of (guess what?) buttons. But not of any buttons. The methods there are used by the action buttons on your bars.\nIn the ActionButton.lua file, every time a function (i.e. &lt;a href=\"API_UseAction\"&gt;API_UseAction&lt;/a&gt;) needs to know the action ID of a specific button, it calls \n id = ActionButton_GetPagedID(button)\nI wouldn't recommend looking at the code of this method, because your brain may explode (unless you are good at reading uncommented and foreign code in Lua), but I will summarize the method for you. Every Blizzard UI button has an ID, specified in the corresponding XML File:\n &lt;Button name=\"SomeName\" ...someOtherValues... id=\"2\"&gt;\n ...some Code\n &lt;/Button&gt;\nThis ID can be obtained by calling button:GetID(). Unfortunately, this ID ranges from only 1-12, and is then offset based on the type of button or action page page, so it's not very convenient if you want to create your own button. \nLuckily, the blizzard code recognizes that AddOns need to create their own buttons so it provides special behaviour if you set the id of your Button to 0, using the \"action\" attribute of the button.\nControlling a Button's Action Slot ID.\nTo make your own action button with a specific slot you simply have to set your button's ID to 0 (which is the default if you dont specify, but I recommend you set it anyway), and set the button's \"action\" attribute. You can do this in the XML, or in lua code afterwards.\nXML:\n &lt;CheckButton name=\"customButton\" inherits=\"ActionBarButtonTemplate\" id=\"0\"&gt;\n &lt;Attributes&gt;\n &lt;Attribute name=\"action\" value=\"101\"/&gt;\n &lt;/Attributes&gt;\n &lt;/CheckButton&gt;\nLUA:\n customButton:SetAttribute(\"action\", 101);"}
