Once you have found the robot, you are offered a quest to rescue it. These rescues involve following the robot to a point where it can take off on its own:\nEach time, the robot will be attacked twice or three times by groups of 3 or 4 (depending on the particular ambush) mobs. Also, the robot will attract the attention of any wandering mobs along the way.\nComplete all 3 escort and beacon missions, and &lt;a href=\"Oglethorpe%20Obnoticus\"&gt;Oglethorpe Obnoticus&lt;/a&gt; will reward you with a &lt;a href=\"Mechanical%20Chicken\"&gt;scale model&lt;/a&gt; of the OOX robot...

The reason for this hostility is revealed to &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; adventurers who visit him to learn Gnome Engineering. According to Oglethorpe, he was ostracized by the rulers of Gnomeregan because they considered him an \"intellectual threat.\" Indignant, he left Gnomeregan for good, which likely led to his residence in Booty Bay. Oglethorpe tells the player that because of the way the ruling faction of Gnomeregan treated him, it lost one of the greatest gnome engineers alive. He particularly does not like &lt;a href=\"Tinkmaster%20Overspark\"&gt;Tinkmaster Overspark&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhat really happened was that, after creating an unbeatable robot for a friendly competition of &lt;a href=\"Gnomish%20inventor\"&gt;inventors&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sicco%20Thermaplugg\"&gt;Sicco Thermaplugg&lt;/a&gt; stole his blueprints and created the &lt;a href=\"Crowd%20Pummeler%209-60\"&gt;Crowd Pummeler 9-60&lt;/a&gt;. Thermaplugg set it loose in &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt;, and the ruling council of the Gnomes banished Oglethorpe, believing him to be responsible.\nWhile in Booty Bay, he assisted adventurers in restoring a chicken, turning it into a mechanical one.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, Oglethorpe appeared in &lt;a href=\"Rustbolt\"&gt;Rustbolt&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Mechagon%20Island\"&gt;Mechagon Island&lt;/a&gt;. Seeking to prove that his inventions are better than Overspark's, he released countless mechanical chickens across this island to analyze the technology on the island, adopt it, and evolve their own circuitry. He hoped one of them would become his ultimate battle chicken. His plans were disrupted when the local &lt;a href=\"trogg\"&gt;trogg&lt;/a&gt;s started bashing and stealing the chicken to eat them, so he sent adventurers to collect mechanical parts and repair &lt;a href=\"OOX-Bomber/MG\"&gt;OOX-Bomber/MG&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuotes.\nGossip.\nHello there lad...the name's Oglethorpe and I may be responsible for one of the amazing gnomish devices you might possess!

Descendants of the various stone giants known as &lt;a href=\"Breakers\"&gt;Breakers&lt;/a&gt;, the ogres were originally enslaved by their progenitors, the &lt;a href=\"ogron\"&gt;ogron&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, the ogre hero &lt;a href=\"Gorgog%20the%20Gronnslayer\"&gt;Gog the Gronnslayer&lt;/a&gt; showed that it was possible to kill the &lt;a href=\"gronn\"&gt;gronn&lt;/a&gt;, which both ogres and ogron revered as godlike beings, and he became the founder of the &lt;a href=\"Gorian%20Empire\"&gt;Gorian Empire&lt;/a&gt; that would come to rule much of Draenor for centuries until the arrival of the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;. Over the years, ogre influence gradually waned across the world as they were slowly surpassed by their &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; descendants and the draenei as the dominant races of the world. The ogres eventually accompanied the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt; through the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; to participate in the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;s.\nFollowing the Second War, the ogre clans scattered across Azeroth. Shortly after the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Stonemaul%20clan\"&gt;Stonemaul clan&lt;/a&gt; joined the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;New Horde&lt;/a&gt; after the half-ogre &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt; killed &lt;a href=\"Kor%27gall\"&gt;their chieftain&lt;/a&gt;. After the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Dreadmaul\"&gt;Dreadmaul tribe&lt;/a&gt; was partially re-enslaved by Horde forces, while the &lt;a href=\"Dunemaul%20clan\"&gt;Dunemaul clan&lt;/a&gt; was brought into the Horde by &lt;a href=\"Megs%20Dreadshredder\"&gt;Megs Dreadshredder&lt;/a&gt;.\nOgre society is based on a clan structure in which physical strength is greatly respected, and besting a rival is usually the only way to advance within the clan. Though ogres are generally seen as unintelligent brutes, the ancient Gorian Empire was ruled by a succession of powerful sorcerers, and during the Second War, many more two-headed &lt;a href=\"ogre%20mage\"&gt;ogre magi&lt;/a&gt; came into existence due to the magical intervention of the orc &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;. These ogre magi often enjoy an elevated position among the clans.\nOn the , the Gorian Empire, ruled by , allied themselves with the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nOrigins and early history.\nOgres can trace their lineage back to &lt;a href=\"Grond\"&gt;Grond&lt;/a&gt;, the enormous stone giant created by the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Aggramar\"&gt;Aggramar&lt;/a&gt; to defeat the &lt;a href=\"Evergrowth\"&gt;Evergrowth&lt;/a&gt; and the plant-like &lt;a href=\"Sporemound\"&gt;Sporemound&lt;/a&gt;s. As Grond and the Sporemounds fought, pieces of the battling leviathans fell to the earth and gave rise to the &lt;a href=\"colossal\"&gt;colossal&lt;/a&gt;s, children of Grond, and the &lt;a href=\"genesaur\"&gt;genesaur&lt;/a&gt;, children of the Sporemounds. After Grond's death, the colossals continued fighting the Sporemound &lt;a href=\"Botaan\"&gt;Botaan&lt;/a&gt; and its minions, but over time many of the stone giants succumbed to their foes. From the colossals' remains, new creatures known as &lt;a href=\"magnaron\"&gt;magnaron&lt;/a&gt; emerged. After the colossals sacrificed themselves to destroy Botaan in a massive explosion, spores from the plant creature's body, teeming with the &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20of%20Life\"&gt;Spirit of Life&lt;/a&gt;, drifted back to Draenor's surface and clung to the hides of the magnaron, weakening their bodies. Some of the magnaron devolved into beings called &lt;a href=\"gronn\"&gt;gronn&lt;/a&gt;, and due to the lingering effects of the spores, a small number of gronn continued degenerating into the &lt;a href=\"ogron\"&gt;ogron&lt;/a&gt;. Over thousands of years, the residual spores transformed a number of ogron into the ogres. The ogres were smaller than their progenitors, and many of them would become enslaved to the ogron. Finally, from the ogres arose yet another race: the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s. The &lt;a href=\"ogre%20lord\"&gt;ogre lord&lt;/a&gt;s are the only ogres known to retain some of the physical traits of their gronn progenitors, such as the bony, calcified protrusions on their head and back, as well as a portion of the gronn's immense size and strength. The ogres themselves would later claim that they were born \"at the beginning\", and that when the great &lt;a href=\"Forgers\"&gt;Forgers&lt;/a&gt; squeezed the light from the ball of fire that would become Draenor, they also shaped the ogres from the same smoking clay, granting them dominion over stone and earth. Thus, the ogres consider themselves the rightful rulers of Draenor.\nThe first great technological innovation in ogre society was the concept of attaching a rock to the end of a very long stick to smash your enemies, rather than attempting to bash them with a rock held in your hand. The schism this innovation created amongst ogre society resolved itself only when the now-forgotten tribe broke into the &lt;a href=\"Warmaul\"&gt;Warmaul&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Boulderfist%20clan\"&gt;Boulderfist&lt;/a&gt; clans.\nBy the time the &lt;a href=\"arakkoa\"&gt;arakkoa&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;a href=\"Apexis\"&gt;Apexis&lt;/a&gt; empire fell, the children of stone had grown in number and spread across the land. The ogres and orcs quickly learned to fear the ogron's attention. The best fate a conquered ogre clan could hope for was to be sent into battle as disposable combatants against other ogron tribes, while their sick, weak, and elderly clan members were typically offered as living sacrifices to appease the mighty gronn and keep them from attacking ogron territories.\nThe Gronnslayer.\nOne day, a group of arakkoa led by &lt;a href=\"Yonzi\"&gt;Yonzi&lt;/a&gt; sought to claim a ruined Apexis settlement in &lt;a href=\"Terokkar%20Forest\"&gt;Talador&lt;/a&gt;, a place now occupied by ogron. Attempts to bribe or barter with the ogron ended violently, leading the arakkoa to instead begin teaching the ogron's ogre slaves the arts of &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; in the hopes that they would rebel against their masters. One of the first to master this new power was named &lt;a href=\"Gorgog%20the%20Gronnslayer\"&gt;Gog&lt;/a&gt;. He strode forth, empowered, but not to fight the ogron: instead, he targeted the gronn, whom all ogres revered and feared as deities. Though stunned, the arakkoa could not argue with the results. Gog did not only kill one gronn with his magic but several. By his fifth, stories of his deeds were known to all captive ogres on Draenor, erasing their fear of both gronn and ogron. The ogres rose up together against their ogron overlords, igniting a bloody war. In the end, nearly every ogron tribe fell to their captives. When the arakkoa attempted to move in to search for Apexis artifacts, Gog quickly put a stop to it. He declared himself \"Gorgog\" (King Gog) and renamed the city to \"&lt;a href=\"Goria\"&gt;Goria&lt;/a&gt;\" (Throne of the King). He commanded the arakkoa to leave on pain of death, but the arakkoa soon returned to launch a surprise attack in the dead of night. However, Gog and his apprentice arcanists fought back, defeating the arakkoa and killing Yonzi in a slow, gruesome manner. Despite the promise of undiscovered Apexis crystals, further arakkoa incursions into Gorian lands were few and far between afterward.\nOver generations, the &lt;a href=\"Gorian%20Empire\"&gt;Gorian Empire&lt;/a&gt; slowly expanded across the world. Though the ogres were not focused on conquest, wide swaths of land fell under their control. Ogron and gronn were hunted down wherever they were found, and cities and outposts such as &lt;a href=\"Highmaul\"&gt;Highmaul&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bladespire%20Hold\"&gt;Bladespire Hold&lt;/a&gt; sprang up throughout &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;'s continents. An advanced trade network crossing land and sea was established to link Goria to the distant strongholds. Goria itself remained the capital and a distinguished place for apprentices to train in the arcane arts.\nThe ogres' practice of sorcery and exposure to raw arcane magic had some unexpected side effects. Very rarely, children would be born with two heads. It soon became clear that these two-headed ogres were exceptional spellcasters, and their appearance was seen as a good omen. In time, Goria's arcanists even developed spells to replicate this phenomenon, causing normal ogres to grow a second head and increasing their intelligence and magical aptitude.\nDuring the early decades of the &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Order\"&gt;Age of Order&lt;/a&gt;, a sly ogre chieftain decreed that disputes in his clan would be settled via proxy in one-on-one combat between &lt;a href=\"gladiator\"&gt;gladiator&lt;/a&gt; slaves. The mortality rate amongst the ogres plummeted, leading to a golden age of expansion.\nThe destruction of Goria.\nThe orcs soon rose to prominence across Draenor, living on the outskirts of the Gorian Empire. The ogres had little interest in (or fear of) the orcs and saw their practice of &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;ism as little more than quaint trickery, but when they witnessed the power of a shaman first-hand they decided to take this power by force. &lt;a href=\"Imperator%20Molok\"&gt;Imperator Molok&lt;/a&gt; sent an army to drive away the orcs from the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20the%20Elements\"&gt;Throne of the Elements&lt;/a&gt; and begin experimenting on the power there. One day, the dissonance between the ogres' magic and the residual energies lingering in the remains of Grond, from whose head the Throne had been formed, caused an explosion that blew apart the orcish temple at the site. The incident threw the elements out of balance all across Draenor, causing great storms, but Molok simply sent more spellcasters to replace the ones that had been killed by the explosion.\nAt the next year's orcish &lt;a href=\"Kosh%27harg\"&gt;Kosh'harg&lt;/a&gt; festival, the &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20clan\"&gt;Shadowmoon&lt;/a&gt; elder shaman &lt;a href=\"Nelgarm\"&gt;Nelgarm&lt;/a&gt; pleaded for action, lest all of the clans suffer disastrous famines as a result of the elements' imbalance. The clans agreed to join together, and Nelgarm called upon the elements to bless them with their protection. The united orc army took back the Throne of the Elements with little bloodshed, but Imperator Molok was quick to retaliate. The Gorian armies moved en masse, and total war engulfed Draenor, and now every orcish male, female, and child had to be prepared to fight. The ogres imagined that this merciless tactic would strike terror into the hearts of the orcs, but the clans rose to the challenge and small, mobile groups of raiders slowly dismantled the Gorian Empire's network of fortresses and outposts, pushing the ogre armies back to their capital, Goria.\nThe orcs kept their distance on the hills surrounding the city, content to starve their enemy out. As the siege progressed and the ogres found maintaining their empire to be increasingly unsustainable, Molok and his sorcerers revisited their Apexis crystals, searching for a way to break the siege. In time, they discovered the arakkoan legend about the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Sethe\"&gt;Curse of Sethe&lt;/a&gt; and began experimenting with ways to create a similar affliction among the orcs. They succeeded, and soon the so-called &lt;a href=\"red%20pox\"&gt;red pox&lt;/a&gt; spread like wildfire through the orcs' encampments, culling vast amounts of the orcish combatants. Nelgarm and his fellow shaman, realizing that the pox was an unseen attack from the ogres and that the siege was now doomed to fail, beseeched the elements to destroy Goria. The orcs and the elemental spirits both understood that Molok would resume meddling with the Throne of the Elements if the orcs failed, and so the spirits unleashed their fury upon Goria. Over hours, lightning, fire and earthquakes ravaged the ogre capital until nothing but ash and rubble remained, before the earth itself wrenched open like a giant maw to swallow Molok and the remains of his great city whole.\nOnly whispers of the event would reach the other Gorian cities, but those whispers were enough to discourage further tampering with the elements. The orcs were victorious, but they had suffered massive losses and witnessed a destructive power they never wanted to see again. Nelgarm and the other shaman were particularly frightened by the elementals' wrath and said that the need for a unified orc army had passed. There was little argument, and the orc clans returned to their lands. The Gorian Empire never recovered. The other ogre fortresses \u2014 particularly Highmaul and Bladespire Hold \u2014 secured their own territories, gradually growing more akin to individual city-states than a unified nation. The orcs began to seize ogre lands by force, gradually surpassing them as the most advanced, dominant race on the world.\nArrival of the draenei.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; arrived on Draenor roughly 200 years later, the ogres watched them carefully and sent Highmaul scouts to observe their expansion across &lt;a href=\"Terokkar%20Forest\"&gt;Terokkar Forest&lt;/a&gt;. When the draenei began to construct the great city of &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath&lt;/a&gt; upon the ruins of Goria, there was an explosion of anger within Highmaul. It was seen as an unforgivable insult for these small, weak newcomers to build a city on the bones of the Gorian Empire's great capital, but Shattrath's sleek construction and otherworldly defenses gave the ogres pause. Nothing like their technology had ever been seen on Draenor before, and even their weakest apprentices had more refined and effective magical techniques than even the most advanced ogre sorcerers.\n&lt;a href=\"Imperator%20Hok%27lon\"&gt;Imperator Hok'lon&lt;/a&gt; seized control of Highmaul and declared that he would reclaim Shattrath from the \"usurpers\". He promised that Highmaul would become the center of a new, enlightened Gorian Empire once the draenei had been slaughtered. Highmaul's aristocracy threw their support behind Hok'lon, and the ogre army marched on Shattrath. Despite the ogres' greater numbers, the city's defenses easily repelled their first \u2014 and only \u2014 attack. As the ogres regrouped, the draenei launched surprise attacks from multiple directions, killing Hok'lon and his generals and leaving the ogres in disarray. The draenei then immediately returned to Shattrath as their leader, &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt;, appeared on the city's ramparts and told the ogres \"Go home, and you will not be harmed\". The ogres fled, and the grandiose war that was meant to revive the Gorian Empire had fallen after one attack. The Highmaul ogres never attempted a frontal assault on the draenei again.\nRise of the Horde.\n11 years before the opening of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, the orcish &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20clan\"&gt;Warsong clan&lt;/a&gt; engaged in a constant battle with the Highmaul ogres, their wolf riders using hit-and-run tactics to raid ogre settlements. The Warsongs eventually shattered Highmaul's hold on the region, seizing much of it for themselves and pushing the ogres back within the walls of their stronghold. The Warsong chieftain, &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grommash Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, became a legend among the clans. This was only the beginning of Highmaul's woes. The ogres had a long history of enslaving orcs and forcing them to fight each other in brutal arenas for entertainment. One slave named &lt;a href=\"Kargath%20Bladefist\"&gt;Kargath&lt;/a&gt; led an uprising within Highmaul, tearing off his own hand to escape his chains and challenging his fellow slaves to do the same. Those who did join Kargath as he rampaged through the city and spilled the blood of his masters. Kargath and the former slaves established the &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Hand%20clan\"&gt;Shattered Hand clan&lt;/a&gt; and settled in the &lt;a href=\"Spires%20of%20Arak\"&gt;Spires of Arak&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Gorgrond&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock clan&lt;/a&gt; had long clashed with ogre populations. By the time of 11 years before the Dark Portal, the Blackrocks had crushed their brutish enemies and driven most of them from the region. The highly superstitious &lt;a href=\"Bleeding%20Hollow%20clan\"&gt;Bleeding Hollow clan&lt;/a&gt; similarly clashed with ogres in their home of &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Tanaan Jungle&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Frostfire Ridge&lt;/a&gt;, tensions were increasing between the local orc clans and the &lt;a href=\"Bladespire%20clan\"&gt;Bladespire&lt;/a&gt; ogres. The Bladespire leader, &lt;a href=\"Imperator%20Kelgrok\"&gt;Imperator Kelgrok&lt;/a&gt;, was greatly troubled by the waning of ogre influence across Draenor and was determined to keep his hold on Frostfire Ridge. Ever since the Gorian Empire's fall, the ogre population had remained relatively low, so the Bladespire sorcerers conducted cruel experiments to create new creatures for labor. The most promising results came from the &lt;a href=\"mok%27nathal\"&gt;mok'nathal&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 half-breeds created through selective breeding between ogres and orcs. Kelgrok unleashed the mok'nathal as the bulk of the Bladespire army that marched across Frostfire, leading the &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20clan\"&gt;Frostwolf&lt;/a&gt; orc chieftain &lt;a href=\"Garad\"&gt;Garad&lt;/a&gt; to unite with the &lt;a href=\"Whiteclaw%20clan\"&gt;Whiteclaw clan&lt;/a&gt; to fight back and capture several mok'nathal, including their elder &lt;a href=\"Leoroxx\"&gt;Leoroxx&lt;/a&gt;. When Garad learned from Leoroxx that the mok'nathal were not willing servants but slaves, the Frostwolves, Whiteclaws and mok'nathal decided to unite against the Bladespire. Leoroxx returned to &lt;a href=\"Bladespire%20Hold\"&gt;Bladespire Hold&lt;/a&gt; and incited the mok'nathal to rise up against their masters as the Frostwolves and Whiteclaws crashed into the hold's outer defenses. The &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Bladespire\"&gt;Battle of Bladespire&lt;/a&gt; dragged on for a full bloody day before the ogres were driven out, with Leoroxx having strangled Imperator Kelgrok in the heart of the fortress. Garad offered the mok'nathal land in Frostfire to make a new home, but Leoroxx declined and instead chose to settle his people in a remote corner of Gorgrond, knowing that the orcs would never truly accept half-breeds.\nA few years later, the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Orcish Horde&lt;/a&gt; marched across Draenor. &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; offered ogres and mok'nathal a place in the Horde to increase his numbers. Later, Chieftain &lt;a href=\"Kilrogg%20Deadeye\"&gt;Kilrogg&lt;/a&gt; led a Bleeding Hollow campaign against the &lt;a href=\"Primals\"&gt;Primal&lt;/a&gt;-controlled island of &lt;a href=\"Farahlon\"&gt;Farahlon&lt;/a&gt;, but as the orcs were not seafarers they had to rely on ogre shipwrights to build vessels capable of crossing the ocean. Meanwhile, Chieftain Grommash of the Warsong clan and the ogre &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; clan toppled Highmaul, both of them relishing the opportunity to slay ogres. Cho'gall, eager to exact vengeance upon those who had exiled him from Highmaul, sought out &lt;a href=\"Imperator%20Mar%27gok\"&gt;Imperator Mar'gok&lt;/a&gt;, magically bound him to his own throne and burned him alive. Elsewhere, Warchief Blackhand tasked the Frostwolf, Thunderlord, and Whiteclaw clans with wiping out Draenor's gronn, ogron, and magnaron, as well as the ogres that had refused to join the Horde. Apart from Highmaul, most ogres had already joined, but Blackhand had no interest in winning the loyalty of the few remaining holdouts \u2014 he had given them a chance to join him, and now he wanted the brutes dead. The Frostwolves and Whiteclaws saw no honor in hunting the giants down and held most of their warriors back, but Chieftain Fenris and his Thunderlords did not shy away from the task and reveled in the slaughter of their ancient enemies. One of the few gronn to escape the onslaught was named &lt;a href=\"Gruul%20the%20Dragonkiller\"&gt;Gruul&lt;/a&gt;, who lorded over a small number of ogres and gronn in Gorgrond, and from his remote lair in the mountains he fended off multiple Thunderlord assaults. Casualties grew so great that Fenris eventually abandoned the attacks.\nThe First War.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, ogres ventured through the Dark Portal to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, but for the most part did not participate in the war, instead favoring lands not frequented by the orcs. The ogre &lt;a href=\"Turok\"&gt;Turok&lt;/a&gt;, lover of Blackhand's daughter &lt;a href=\"Griselda%20Blackhand\"&gt;Griselda&lt;/a&gt;, led an outlaw band of ogres who took refuge in the &lt;a href=\"Deadmines\"&gt;Deadmines&lt;/a&gt; until they were killed on Blackhand's orders.\nAt least &lt;a href=\"Mai%27Zoth\"&gt;one ogre&lt;/a&gt; fought in &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"jungle%20troll\"&gt;jungle troll&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe Second War.\nThe ogres were brought through the Dark Portal by the orc &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; after the First War to act as enforcers in an effort to quell needless infighting between the orc clans. They also had the difficult task of keeping in check the demented warriors of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Blade%20clan\"&gt;Burning Blade clan&lt;/a&gt;. Besides this role of enforcer, the ogres also generally took part in many of the major battles of the war and &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; himself had a bodyguard of loyal ogre warriors. However, the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; effectively countered the ogres with mounted &lt;a href=\"knight\"&gt;knight&lt;/a&gt;s, a strategy that served them well throughout the war.\nFollowing the Horde's conquest of &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;, Doomhammer planned to build a fleet of ships and launch a surprise attack in the heart of &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;ity's territories. Many orcs had reservations about this, for they were not a seafaring people and most of the superstitious clans feared the open sea. However, Gul'dan and his &lt;a href=\"Stormreaver%20clan\"&gt;Stormreaver clan&lt;/a&gt; urged their allies that it was the best course of action, and in a bay tucked in the southwestern &lt;a href=\"Wetlands\"&gt;Wetlands&lt;/a&gt; Orgrim oversaw the construction of the fleet. While the orcs knew little of shipbuilding, some of their ogre allies had maritime knowledge and helped construct the immense &lt;a href=\"juggernaught\"&gt;juggernaught&lt;/a&gt;s \u2014 heavily armed and armored floating fortresses that soon came to be feared across the seas of Azeroth for their unrelenting onslaught.\nLater, Gul'dan and his followers chiseled away at one of the &lt;a href=\"high%20elf\"&gt;high elven&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"runestone\"&gt;runestone&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; to create structures known as the &lt;a href=\"Altar%20of%20Storms\"&gt;Altars of Storms&lt;/a&gt;. Gul'dan then turned to the ancient arcane rituals that were once used by the Highmaul ogres to create highly intelligent two-headed &lt;a href=\"ogre%20mage\"&gt;ogre magi&lt;/a&gt;. Few living ogres knew of this technique, but Gul'dan's follower Cho'gall was one of them. He handpicked the ogres who would undergo the transformation and oversaw the rituals himself. Before long, ogre magi emerged from the altars, and they were just as powerful as Gul'dan had hoped, and more importantly, they secretly swore their loyalty to him.\nDespite having been raised to hate them and having fought against them for most of his life, Doomhammer also grew respect for the ogres during the war, to the point that he created his own elite guard of ogre warriors. These ogres were loyal to him and him alone, admiring Doomhammer's strength and courage, seeing him as a small ogre himself. He, in turn, had come to respect their strength and relied upon their support. He knew they would die for him if necessary, and was surprised to realize he would give his life for them as well.\nThe Third War and beyond.\nFollowing the defeat of the Horde at the end of the Second War, the ogre clans dispersed in all directions. Some escaped through the Dark Portal back to Draenor, but others had no intention of remaining near the orcs or their bloodlust. Some ogres made the difficult journey across the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt; to the distant continent of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, where they found plenty of space to inhabit, while others remained in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; and were ruthlessly hunted by Alliance patrols. During the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, many of the ogre lords rallied the remnants of their scattered people for some unknown purpose. A group of ogres living near &lt;a href=\"Hearthglen\"&gt;Hearthglen&lt;/a&gt; descended from the hills, looking for a fight.\nThe ogres played no part in defeating the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; during the Third War, but after the war the mok'nathal &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt; traveled to the home of the &lt;a href=\"Stonemaul%20clan\"&gt;Stonemaul clan&lt;/a&gt; to recruit their aid against &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Daelin Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;'s forces. As the Stonemaul chieftain &lt;a href=\"Kor%27gall\"&gt;Kor'gall&lt;/a&gt; stubbornly refused to join the Horde, Rexxar was forced to kill him in order to rally the Stonemaul. In the &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands\"&gt;Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;, the ogre &lt;a href=\"Mug%27thol\"&gt;Mug'thol&lt;/a&gt; and his followers were enslaved by &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, but he later broke free of her control using the &lt;a href=\"%3ACrown%20of%20Will\"&gt;:Crown of Will&lt;/a&gt;.\nOther ogre tribes continue to exist on &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, the ruined remnants of Draenor. Up to &lt;a href=\"Krol\"&gt;Krol&lt;/a&gt;'s disappearance, the &lt;a href=\"Boulderfist%20clan\"&gt;Boulderfist clan&lt;/a&gt; ruled over them, but most of them ended up enslaved to the gronn of the Blade's Edge Mountains, worshipping Gruul as a deity and answering to &lt;a href=\"High%20King%20Maulgar\"&gt;High King Maulgar&lt;/a&gt;, and being in conflict with each other and other races over the diminishing resources of the shattered world. By this time, Gruul's \"small amount\" of ogres he ruled during the Horde's rise seems to have expanded, now including clans that were once among the Gorian Empire such as the Bladespire clan. The &lt;a href=\"Ogri%27la%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Ogri'la&lt;/a&gt;, a group of ogres who have been granted increased intellect by the &lt;a href=\"Apexis%20Crystal\"&gt;Apexis crystals&lt;/a&gt;, have freed themselves from their demi-god oppressors and are trying to forge a new, more peaceful existence for their race.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; on Azeroth, &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt; re-emerged and brought ogre legions into the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;. He attempted to recruit the &lt;a href=\"Gordunni\"&gt;Gordunni&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Feralas\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt;, an effort that was discovered and intercepted by the &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt; and the Stonemaul clan. In &lt;a href=\"Loch%20Modan\"&gt;Loch Modan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ashlan%20Stonesmirk\"&gt;Ashlan Stonesmirk&lt;/a&gt; and an Alliance adventurer halted the efforts of the Twilight's Hammer-loyal &lt;a href=\"Mo%27grosh\"&gt;Mo'grosh&lt;/a&gt; ogres, while the &lt;a href=\"Glopgut\"&gt;Glopgut&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Highlands\"&gt;Twilight Highlands&lt;/a&gt; were prevented from joining the Twilight cult by Horde adventurers sent by the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw&lt;/a&gt; orcs. In &lt;a href=\"Tanaris\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Dunemaul%20clan\"&gt;Dunemaul&lt;/a&gt; were recruited into the Horde by &lt;a href=\"Megs%20Dreadshredder\"&gt;Megs Dreadshredder&lt;/a&gt;, while a portion of the &lt;a href=\"Dreadmaul\"&gt;Dreadmaul&lt;/a&gt; ogres were enslaved by the &lt;a href=\"Okril%27lon\"&gt;Okril'lon&lt;/a&gt; forces in the &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt;.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nOn the , the &lt;a href=\"Gorian%20Empire\"&gt;Gorian Empire&lt;/a&gt;, led by , was forced to ally with the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt;, supplying them with knowledge of &lt;a href=\"magic%20breaker\"&gt;magic breaker&lt;/a&gt;s in exchange for their lives. As a result, the forces of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; raided the ogre capital of &lt;a href=\"Highmaul\"&gt;Highmaul&lt;/a&gt;, slaying Mar'gok and many other high-ranking members of the Empire.\nThe Dreadmaul ogres of Azeroth were recruited by the &lt;a href=\"Ironmarch\"&gt;Ironmarch&lt;/a&gt; forces during the Iron Horde's invasion of the Blasted Lands and laid waste to the Horde fortress of &lt;a href=\"Dreadmaul%20Hold\"&gt;Dreadmaul Hold&lt;/a&gt;.\nSeveral ogres can also be found among the ranks of the .\nThe ogres of Highmaul are referred to as high ogres.\nAfter the end of the war, the united &lt;a href=\"Mag%27har%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Mag'har clans&lt;/a&gt; subdued Draenor's remaining ogre &lt;a href=\"clan\"&gt;clan&lt;/a&gt;s. When the group of Mag'har led by &lt;a href=\"Geya%27rah\"&gt;Geya'rah&lt;/a&gt; entered Azeroth via the &lt;a href=\"Vision%20of%20Time\"&gt;Vision of Time&lt;/a&gt;, they were joined by a group of ogres.\nAppearance and culture.\nOgres are large, heavily built humanoids with round ears and a single horn on their forehead. Their skin tones range in color from shades of peach to red, to deep blues and ashen black. Male ogre heights range from 6' to 12' with an average of 8' while the females stand at anywhere between 6' and 10'. The smallest of ogre children tend to stand at around 5 feet tall.\nOgres can stand still for hours when required, as motionless as statues. The &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; had often wondered if they had somehow evolved from rocks, unknowingly being right about their &lt;a href=\"Breakers\"&gt;Breaker&lt;/a&gt; heritage.\nWhile most ogres are born with two eyes, a handful in every generation regress and are born with a single eye. All but a few clans recognize these ogres are exceptional and destined for great things due to their similarity to the &lt;a href=\"ogre%20lord\"&gt;ogre lord&lt;/a&gt;s of yore.\nOgres have many of the same hairstyles as orcs and can grow hair on the chin and upper lip, even full beards.\nThe most important ogre physical attribute is size. One &lt;a href=\"Ogre%20Figurine\"&gt;sculpture&lt;/a&gt; from Draenor summarizes this idea and depicts an ogre holding a &lt;a href=\"clefthoof\"&gt;clefthoof&lt;/a&gt; above their head, displaying strength, while the subject's robust waistline symbolizes great wealth. Preferring to show off their physique, ogres eschew garments that cover too much skin. In order to look more fearsome to their enemies, they adorn their bodies with warpaints created using mortars and pestles.\nSociety.\nOgre society is based on a clan structure, each clan acting independently of the others. Chieftains rule small bands of ogres with an iron fist, and are never short on challengers. Ogres greatly respect strength in combat, and besting a rival is usually the only way to advance within the clan. Disagreements usually end in violence..\nAt least one clan is divided into classes - the &lt;a href=\"Gordunni\"&gt;Gordunni&lt;/a&gt; clan has an upper class of ogres, known as the Gordok. Members of the Gordunni who wish to become king must simply proclaim themselves as such and then destroy all who might disagree, after which they always take on the name \"&lt;a href=\"King%20Gordok\"&gt;King Gordok&lt;/a&gt;\".\nOgres favor crude stone huts and caverns known as &lt;a href=\"ogre%20mound\"&gt;ogre mound&lt;/a&gt;s for their dwellings. They are often built around steam vents, implying that ogres seem to prefer dark and hot areas. During the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, ogres would congregate at mounds to enhance their endurance, strength, and speed, engaging in contests involving the hurling and crushing of giant rocks to increase their already formidable strength and resilience. Wealthier citizens in &lt;a href=\"Highmaul\"&gt;Highmaul&lt;/a&gt; were known to ornament their mound-homes with trophies from dead enemies. The more brutish ogres tend to be very destructive to the environments they inhabit, destroying any forest and wildlife nearby and leaving only useless muck in their wake. Any area that they have lived in for some time can be distinguished by the piles of waste and excrement that they leave in plain view. Often, the dismembered remains of enemies and prey are hung on meat hooks, strewn about the ground, or otherwise left out for all to see.\nBesides their own tribes, ogres are often found employed as &lt;a href=\"Mercenary\"&gt;mercenaries&lt;/a&gt;, especially by the &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; cartels.\nUnlike their orc relatives, ogres are skilled seafarers. The people of &lt;a href=\"Goria\"&gt;Goria&lt;/a&gt; thought themselves able to outlast any siege thanks to their ocean port, but the city's ships were burned down when the city was destroyed by the elements. During the rise of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, the orcs had to rely on ogre shipwrights to build vessels capable of crossing the ocean to &lt;a href=\"Farahlon\"&gt;Farahlon&lt;/a&gt;, while during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, the ogres helped construct the immense &lt;a href=\"juggernaught\"&gt;juggernaught&lt;/a&gt;s.\nMagic and two-headed ogres.\nDue to the ogres' distant descent from the primordial stone giant &lt;a href=\"Grond\"&gt;Grond&lt;/a&gt;, a creature empowered by the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Aggramar\"&gt;Aggramar&lt;/a&gt;, they are naturally attuned to the &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt;. They hold a special affinity for the earth, able to use arcane power to shape and bend rock and stone to their will. When the &lt;a href=\"arakkoa\"&gt;arakkoa&lt;/a&gt; first began to teach the ogres in the ways of magic, they were surprised and delighted by this discovery, for they had never seen new spellcasting techniques be developed so effortlessly. The ogre &lt;a href=\"geomancer\"&gt;geomancer&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Frostfire%20Ridge\"&gt;Frostfire Ridge&lt;/a&gt; pride themselves on harnessing the elements, but sometimes they overreach, as with &lt;a href=\"Forgemaster%20Gog%27duh\"&gt;Forgemaster Gog'duh&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"slag%20elemental\"&gt;slag elemental&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Magmolatus\"&gt;Magmolatus&lt;/a&gt;.\nDue to the ancient ogres' practice of sorcery and exposure to raw arcane magic, ogre children would very rarely be born with two heads. It soon became clear that these two-headed ogres were exceptional spellcasters, and their appearance was seen as a good omen. In time, &lt;a href=\"Goria\"&gt;Goria&lt;/a&gt;'s arcanists even developed spells to replicate this phenomenon, causing normal ogres to grow a second head and increasing their intelligence and magical aptitude.\nAt the height of the &lt;a href=\"Gorian%20Empire\"&gt;Gorian Empire&lt;/a&gt;, the entire system of ogre rule and justice had been codified in support of magic and the sorcerer kings, or \"imperators\". Imperial ogres jealously guarded the secrets of magic in order to keep their status among the ruling class. The wealthiest among them adorned themselves with magically-enhanced jewelry and other wearable artifacts.\nIn ages past, ogre magi built six &lt;a href=\"Ogre%20Waygate\"&gt;Ogre Waygate&lt;/a&gt;s all over Draenor, creating a travel network for the ogres. Their potency has not diminished over the millennia and they are ready to be activated again. \nBy the time of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, few living ogres knew of the techniques used by the Highmaul to create ogre magi, but &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt; was one of them. Using the &lt;a href=\"Altar%20of%20Storms\"&gt;Altars of Storms&lt;/a&gt; created from &lt;a href=\"high%20elf\"&gt;high elven&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"runestone\"&gt;runestone&lt;/a&gt;s, many powerful ogre magi were created to serve &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;. In the modern day, ogre magi often enjoy an elevated position among the clans.\nAs shown by &lt;a href=\"Torkus\"&gt;Torkus&lt;/a&gt; and his children \u2014 &lt;a href=\"Torkus%20Jr.\"&gt;Torkus Jr.&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tork\"&gt;Tork&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Torki\"&gt;Torki&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 the offspring of a two-headed ogre will also have two heads.\nSome two-headed ogres seem to have compound names which would be the combined names of their two heads. This is the case of the ogre mage &lt;a href=\"Beeble%27phod\"&gt;Beeble'phod&lt;/a&gt;, which is named after his heads &lt;a href=\"Beeble%27s%20Head\"&gt;Beeble&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Phod%27s%20Head\"&gt;Phod&lt;/a&gt;, as well as his comrade &lt;a href=\"Za%27brox\"&gt;Za'brox&lt;/a&gt;, which is named after his heads &lt;a href=\"Za%27s%20Head\"&gt;Za&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Brox%27s%20Head\"&gt;Brox&lt;/a&gt;. When &lt;a href=\"Or%27Dac\"&gt;Or'Dac&lt;/a&gt; is defeated, &lt;a href=\"Head%20of%20Or\"&gt;Or&lt;/a&gt; refers to &lt;a href=\"Head%20of%20Dac\"&gt;Dac&lt;/a&gt; and vice-versa. Three non-canon sources also feature that idea: the &lt;a href=\"Ogre%20%28April%20Fools%29%23Naming%20conventions\"&gt;playable ogre race April Fools&lt;/a&gt;, the RPG books and the \"&lt;a href=\"Heroes%20of%20the%20Storm\"&gt;Heroes of the Storm&lt;/a&gt;\" game, the latter two in which &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt; is said to be named after his heads Cho and Gall. Some other probable cases would be &lt;a href=\"Dagg%27um%20Ty%27gor\"&gt;Dagg'um Ty'gor&lt;/a&gt;, a compound of &lt;a href=\"Dagg\"&gt;Dagg'um&lt;/a&gt; and Ty'gor, and &lt;a href=\"Imperator%20Mar%27gok\"&gt;Imperator Mar'gok&lt;/a&gt;, a presumable compound of Mar and Gok.\nNon-magical two-headed ogres.\nIn \"\", all ogres were depicted as two-headed and seemingly natural. Instead of making them smarter, being two-headed actually made them \"stupider\" due to the constant bickering between the two heads.\nMost of the &lt;a href=\"ogre%20mage\"&gt;ogre mage&lt;/a&gt;s, with a few exceptions like &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt; who was described as learning magic through studying, were not said to be smarter because of some natural affinity for the arcane, but because they were infused with the energies of dead &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s from a ritual at the &lt;a href=\"Altar%20of%20Storms\"&gt;Altar of Storms&lt;/a&gt;. As a result, they spoke more eloquently and argued much less than regular two-headed ogres. While originally it was said many of the newly-created ogre mages were as such extremely cunning and insidious, serving the Horde only as they saw fit, in the new lore, many ogre mages were completely loyal to Gul'dan due to him having shaped them and formed a bond between them.\n\"\", all visible ogres are again two-headed regardless if they are magi or not, though its expansion \"The Frozen Throne\" introduced a &lt;a href=\"Stonemaul%20Ogre%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;one-head ogre variant&lt;/a&gt; for the campaign. The non-canon \"&lt;a href=\"Heroes%20of%20the%20Storm\"&gt;Heroes of the Storm&lt;/a&gt;\" also depicts all ogres in the game as two-headed.\nThough uncommon, \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" occasionally depicts two-headed ogres who are not ogre magi, such as the &lt;a href=\"Splinter%20Fist%20Enslaver\"&gt;Splinter Fist Enslaver&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stonard%20Ogre\"&gt;Stonard Ogre&lt;/a&gt; mobs, similar to the RTS games. \"\" shows two-headed and non-magi ogres too, in addition to a one-headed ogre mage.\nCombat.\nOgres are straightforward in combat and often suffer as much punishment as they dish out, relying on their strength and stamina to carry them to victory. There is proof that at least one ogre had all of his teeth knocked out and lived to fight another day. They are vicious opponents, with the strength to rip off a warrior's limbs should they so choose. The ogres favor huge, spiked clubs that they use to bash in the skulls of their enemies and to bring down the large prey they hunt.\nMost ogres focus on the path of the &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"ranger\"&gt;ranger&lt;/a&gt;, but a small percentage choose a life of sorcery as ogre-magi.\nSlavery and gladiators.\nOgres have a long history of enslaving orcs, forcing their captives to fight each other in brutal arenas for entertainment. The tradition of gladiatorial slavery began during the early decades of the &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Order\"&gt;Age of Order&lt;/a&gt;, when a sly ogre chieftain decreed that disputes in his clan would be settled via proxy in one-on-one combat between slaves, leading to a plummet in the mortality rate amongst the ogres. Examples of ogre arenas include the &lt;a href=\"Highmaul\"&gt;Highmaul&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Coliseum\"&gt;Coliseum&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Stonemaul%20Arena\"&gt;Stonemaul Arena&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"the%20Maul\"&gt;the Maul&lt;/a&gt;, the , the and the &lt;a href=\"Circle%20of%20Blood\"&gt;Circle of Blood&lt;/a&gt;. Rather than using clasps and locks, ogres bind their slaves using unbroken stone circlets. Their centuries of manipulating earth elements lets them simply shrink the manacles tightly around the slave's ankles, wrists, or neck.\nFemale ogres.\nOgre women have yet to appear in a \"Warcraft\" game, but they were just as common as male ogres when &lt;a href=\"Aramar%20Thorne\"&gt;Aramar Thorne&lt;/a&gt; visited &lt;a href=\"Dire%20Maul\"&gt;Dire Maul&lt;/a&gt; and are mentioned in passing in \"&lt;a href=\"Code%20of%20Rule\"&gt;Code of Rule&lt;/a&gt;\". The few ogre females mentioned in lore include the unnamed wife of &lt;a href=\"Tharg\"&gt;Tharg&lt;/a&gt;, who died by the claws of the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Gug%27rokk%27s%20Grandmother\"&gt;Gug'rokk's Grandmother&lt;/a&gt;; an &lt;a href=\"ogre%20girl\"&gt;unnamed young female&lt;/a&gt; who served &lt;a href=\"King%20Gordok\"&gt;King Gordok&lt;/a&gt; in Dire Maul; and &lt;a href=\"Karrga\"&gt;Karrga&lt;/a&gt; of the Gordunni. The mysterious island of &lt;a href=\"Ogrezonia\"&gt;Ogrezonia&lt;/a&gt; is said to be inhabited by giant female ogres who are rumored to perform horrible rituals on men who happen upon their island.\nAn &lt;a href=\"Ogre%20Female%20Mask\"&gt;Ogre Female Mask&lt;/a&gt; is available during &lt;a href=\"Hallow%27s%20End\"&gt;Hallow's End&lt;/a&gt;.\nLanguages.\nOn &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, the ogres spoke their &lt;a href=\"Ogre%20%28language%29\"&gt;own brutish tongue&lt;/a&gt;, but in the current day most appear to speak &lt;a href=\"Orcish%20%28language%29\"&gt;Orcish&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Common%20%28language%29\"&gt;Common&lt;/a&gt;. While the written word is mostly used as an instrument for the upper echelons of imperial ogre society, occasionally an ordinary ogre will try his hand at making a story immortal, such as by creating pictogram carvings.\nComparing a female ogre's hair to a &lt;a href=\"clefthoof\"&gt;clefthoof&lt;/a&gt;'s shaggy coat is a term of great endearment.\nQuotes.\nQuotes from \"World of Warcraft\":\nFor quotes from ' and ', see &lt;a href=\"Quotes%20of%20Warcraft%20II%23Ogre\"&gt;Quotes of Warcraft II#Ogre&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Quotes%20of%20Warcraft%20III/Neutral%23Ogre\"&gt;Quotes of Warcraft III/Neutral#Ogre&lt;/a&gt;, respectively.\nIn the RPG.\nOgres were one of the last races of &lt;a href=\"Colossal\"&gt;Draenor's giants&lt;/a&gt;. Many ogre clans were enslaved by the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt;, rather than the Gronn. These enslaved clans were often used in experiments. According to the RPG books, there are about 6350 ogres on Azeroth (Although certain tribes are not factored in). Still, they can be a significant and furious army if marshaled.\nRegular ogres and two-headed ogres are not spellcasters; the &lt;a href=\"Ogre%20mage\"&gt;ogre magi&lt;/a&gt; make up the smarter, spellcasting versions of ogres.\nSociety.\nMany assume the ogres are insensate brutes, liking nothing more than destruction. Ogres have changed since the days of the Horde, however, possibly also due to their freedom from the influence of demons. More cunning than most give them credit for, ogre tribes keep somewhat at a distance from the other races as they have built a civilization. Villages are established in foothills, allowing ogres access to plains and forested areas.\nThe new civilization of ogres has somewhat of a patchwork quality to it. Tribes are experimenting with different approaches, observing the other races as they seek to find their own way. Some groups are nomadic, while others have started small agrarian communities. All hunt, either as a primary or supplementary source of food. While rivalries and conflicts occur, ogres place great stock in listening to elders and allowing moderation of disputes. There is a loyalty to the race and at least some respect for the other races, though ogre interests are always addressed first and foremost.\nOgres value endurance and insight more than simple strength. As strong as they are, they know that something out there is always stronger. &lt;a href=\"Ranger\"&gt;Ranger&lt;/a&gt;s are common among ogres, combining skill with the knowledge of the land.\nOgres test unfamiliar groups to determine their power and possible intentions. They try to avoid conflict, often by having ogre warriors make displays of aggression, smashing the ground and shouting at opponents, out of range of whatever weapons the opponents possess. As a last resort, ogres have some skill in formation fighting and will use a combination of charges and withdrawals to try to surround enemies. Ogres will throw spears at a distance in waves combined with the use of clubs, with possible magical support from ogre magi. When committed to a fight, these giants are completely dedicated, only breaking from an engagement if their leader commands it.\nDespite their size and ferocious appearance, ogres are curious about the wider world and often seek to spread a more positive understanding of ogre culture. At the very least, an ogre hero can gain resources and allies for her tribe.\nLanguage.\nOgre linguists are rare, but a few exceptionally intelligent ogres learn the languages of their new friends. Some ogre tribes know orcish as one of their primary languages.\nAppearance.\nThere is a great variety in the ogre species. Ogres average between 6 feet and 7 feet in height at adulthood but continue to grow two inches to a foot at a time through a portion of their lives, as well as continuing to put on weight. A fully grown ogre would be between 8 feet and 25 feet; the average for the larger ogres is 15 feet, though some ogres are small, barely larger than 6 or 7 feet.\nTwo-headed ogres.\n\"Some ogres have two heads.

The ogre's name would be a combination of the two player names, the example being JonnyBob. The players would have a separate \"body\" channel where they could discuss things amongst themselves, but whenever each player spoke it would appear as if coming from the two-headed ogre character as a single entity. One player would control the left half of the ogre and another would control the right, meaning the players would have to cooperate to succeed in the game. Whenever one player was logged off, its head would appear asleep.\nAfter the impracticality of this play model was analyzed by the community, and once they realized the timing of the joke, fans laughed this off as another of Blizzard's silly (but quite creative) pranks.\nTwo-headed Ogres.\nChoosing the Two-headed Player Race.\nBy selecting the Two-headed Ogre race, you are selflessly choosing to share your existence in World of Warcraft with another player. That is, you are staking claim to one half of the Ogre whole. As a Two-headed Ogre, you will have control of one head and one arm at all times. Your other half will be controlled by a second player automatically and permanently paired with you upon character creation. Each player residing in the Ogre body will be free to choose his or her own character class at creation, so for example, it is possible to have a Two-headed Ogre who is half Mage and half Warrior. It is also possible to have two halves of the same character class, depending on the random pairing. Two-headed Ogres serve the Horde, and in keeping with the theme of their inherent duality, their starting zone will be located near the Crossroads, which resides in the Barrens region of Kalimdor. The classes available to Two-headed Ogres are: Mage, Warrior, Priest, Druid, and Warlock. Sharing a single body with another player can produce an mutually enlightening, symbiotic relationship or a constricting, insanely frustrating experience depending on the player you are randomly matched with. Good luck to you!\nInter-Ogre Communication.\nWhen the bond between two players is forged within a single Ogre body, that bond is permanent for better or worse. You and your second head will naturally be spending a lot of time together, and you may find one of your biggest challenges to be learning to cooperate and coexist with your lifelong soul mate. While you have full and absolute control of your head and its associated arm, both players will have simultaneous control of equipment and inventory management, both legs, and character locomotion. This can make it somewhat difficult to travel anywhere in particular if that particular destination at all differs in the mind of either player. Thus, good communication and well-defined roles are essential to the successful Two-headed Ogre. To facilitate this communication, each Two-headed Ogre will get its own [/body] channel so that both heads can better make personal decisions and confer privately about things like what quest to do next, what monster to target, and what direction to move in.\nDouble the Heads Means Double the Fun.\nIf both players are logged in at the same time, they are automatically added to the same party. While both heads share the same hit-point bar, each has a separate bar for mana, rage, etc., depending on class. Due to their girth and compact sturdiness, the total HP for a Two-headed Ogre is a combination of the HP values for each character class; when one head levels up, its additional HP are simply added to the Ogres total HP. The heads level up independently, so if one half of the Ogre is adventuring online more than the other, its likely that that head could move far ahead of the other head in level. When attacked by a monster, the body as a whole takes damage, and when the shared HP are depleted, both heads die. It is possible, however, for each head to receive individual buffs and debuffs. In addition to the standard abilities toolbar, each Two-headed Ogre player will have a secondary toolbar showing the spells/abilities of his or her other half. While one head cannot use the spells/abilities of the other, seeing this secondary toolbar allows the players to observe each other's usage habits and make suggestions. Clicking on any of the icons on this secondary toolbar will automatically spam the [/body] channel with a tip to use that particular spell or ability. The player of the other head can then weigh this suggestion and act appropriately. When one player is offline, that players head appears slumped and sleeping. The offline head will automatically do the /snore emote into the [/body] channel periodically. Also, your Two-headed Ogre will walk with a limp, as if the whole side of the body controlled by the offline head is asleep.\nNaming conventions.\nEach player will be given the opportunity to uniquely name his or her half of the Two-headed Ogre at character creation. However, outside of inter-Ogre communications, the world at large will see your character by a single name. This full name will be the combination of your Ogre's two uniquely named heads. For example, if one particular Ogre's left head is named \"Jonny\" while the right head is named \"Bob,\" the full name of the Two-headed Ogre and the name attached to communications with the outside world will be \"JonnyBob.\" Since both heads speak with this single name, there is no way for other players to know which of the heads within one body is speaking. Thus, it is important to discuss these external communications internally first to avoid appearing schizophrenic.\nTwo-headed Ogre Origins.\nThe Two-headed Ogres of Azeroth are a Horde-born byproduct of the Second War. Created as mutations of natural Ogres by Gul'dan, the massive Two-headed Ogres of the Horde quickly became known (and feared) for their ability to do a large amount of physical and magical damage in a short amount of time. Like the Orcs, Ogres originally entered Azeroth from Draenor, bringing with them a strong sense of tribal loyalty as well as a natural inclination toward one-upmanship. With the addition a second personality within one body, these traits were compounded in the two-headed variety of Ogre: they're fiercely loyal to the Horde, and they're fiercely competitive with themselves, with one head always trying to outdo the other."}

These rumours were quashed upon &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard&lt;/a&gt;'s announcement that the new race would be the &lt;a href=\"Draenei\"&gt;Draenei&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe Ogre Rumour.\nOgres, orcs and Draenei are the three original races from outland. \"The Draenei are one of the three primary races native to Draenor (the others being the Orcs and the Ogres).\" (source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draenei#Draenei )The Horde appear to have minimal association with the Ogres in modern times- Horde friendly Ogre settlements are rare. Ogres are largely scattered throughout the World, splintered into many, \"many\" tribes, not unlike the &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s.\nOne of the rumours held belief that if an Ogre race was to be implemented, their capital would be in Kalimdor, perhaps residing within one of the largely mountainous areas in &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. This rumour was most likely fuelled by the apparently ill-balanced placement of the current Capital cities in regard to Kalimdor and The Easter Kingdoms.\nIn the build up to TBC, Blizzard announced the new Horde race of Blood Elves before the Alliance counterpart. The Blood Elf's apparent attractive, non-brutish appearance possibly caused certain watchful members of the fan base to consider that if the Horde (typically considered 'ugly') were to get an 'attractive' race, that the Alliance may get an 'ugly' race to balance. \nFor the sake of faction balance within realms, it was considered that if the Horde were going to get a slender, attractive model for their new race, that the Alliance would get a rugged, ugly model for theirs. This would aid to solve any balance issues caused by players rolling new characters after the release of TBC to try out the new races.\n \nWithin the discussions, people argued that ogres would be too tall to be a playable race; mentioning that either doors would have to be resized, or the ogres themselves would have to be smaller than the NPC or Mob model. However upon release of TBC, smaller, Tauren sized ogres have appeared throughout the World and Outland.\nDue to there being a number of quests wherein the player assumes to body of an Ogre, ogres have /eat /kneel /sit /laugh /point /wave /fish and mounting animations. This again fuelled the Ogre rumour, with supporters stipulating that the existence of these animations meant Blizzard would not have to create new ones if the Ogres were chosen as a new Race.\nOnce slaves of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt; it could be assumed that modern world, 'Free Ogres', under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt;, would like to exact revenge upon their once oppressors. The effective way of acting upon their detest for The Horde would be to ally with The Alliance. This theory helped to support the Ogre Rumour.\nLaughing Skull Theory.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Laughing%20Skull%20Clan\"&gt;Laughing Skull Clan&lt;/a&gt; once allied with the Alliance in exchange for dominance of the &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Blade's Edge Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. With the Bestiary on the Burning Crusade website, two new monsters have been revealed: the &lt;a href=\"Gronn\"&gt;Gronn&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Rock%20Flayers\"&gt;Rock Flayers&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Gronn\"&gt;Gronn&lt;/a&gt; are malevolent ogre demigods, that have possibly been causing the big guys some trouble. The &lt;a href=\"Rock%20Flayers\"&gt;Rock Flayers&lt;/a&gt;, like the &lt;a href=\"Laughing%20Skull%20Clan\"&gt;Laughing Skull Clan&lt;/a&gt;, are also from the &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Blade's Edge Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, and it's not hard to believe they are causing the ogres trouble as well. These two threats may encourage the ogres, specifically those of the &lt;a href=\"Laughing%20Skull%20Clan\"&gt;Laughing Skull Clan&lt;/a&gt;, to seek out their old, temporary allies in the Alliance.\nStrength Bonus Theory.\nBefore TBC, The Horde lacked a race that had naturally high &lt;a href=\"Intellect\"&gt;Intellect&lt;/a&gt;. Similarly, the Alliance lacked a race with heightened &lt;a href=\"Strength\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt;. Upon the announcement of the Blood Elves, and their magical past and inclination, it was considered that they would fill the intellect void on the Horde side and so convincing some that the Alliance's race would have heightened Strength. Given their size, Ogres were an obvious answer."}

Other unique characteristics possessed by the ogre lords are their intelligence and reasoning abilities, which are more acute than those of their ogre cousins. This combination of brute strength and increased intellect make the ogre lords worthy of both respect and fear. Being born with a single eye as a regular ogre is believed to be a mark of greatness due to the similarity to the ogre lords of yore.\nOgre lords are considered to be rare. Some of the more notable ones include &lt;a href=\"Cho%27war%20the%20Pillager\"&gt;Cho'war the Pillager&lt;/a&gt;, who founded the &lt;a href=\"Warmaul\"&gt;Warmaul&lt;/a&gt; clan by driving out the gronn from the &lt;a href=\"Warmaul%20Hill\"&gt;Warmaul Hill&lt;/a&gt; region; &lt;a href=\"Rom%27ogg%20Bonecrusher\"&gt;Rom'ogg Bonecrusher&lt;/a&gt;, who piqued the interest of the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; cult with his merciless treatment of the ogres and who then oversaw the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20Incineration\"&gt;Chamber of Incineration&lt;/a&gt;; and &lt;a href=\"High%20King%20Maulgar\"&gt;High King Maulgar&lt;/a&gt;, right hand of &lt;a href=\"Gruul%20the%20Dragonkiller\"&gt;Gruul the Dragonkiller&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Bladespire%20clan\"&gt;Bladespire clan&lt;/a&gt; was once among the weakest ogre clans in the &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Blade's Edge Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, lacking the numbers of the &lt;a href=\"Bloodmaul%20clan\"&gt;Bloodmaul&lt;/a&gt; or the physical strength of the &lt;a href=\"Boulderfist%20clan\"&gt;Boulderfist&lt;/a&gt;. The birth of Maulgar changed their fate forever. Stronger and hardier than any other ogre of his age, he swiftly drew the attention of the previous High King due to his prowess in battle. When the king demanded a demonstration of Maulgar's might, Maulgar snapped the king's neck where he stood, thereby shifting the balance of power from the Boulderfist to the Bladespire and drawing the attention of Gruul himself. Fanatically loyal to the gronn, Maulgar came to serve as Gruul's right hand and the guardian of the gronn lord's &lt;a href=\"Gruul%27s%20Lair\"&gt;lair&lt;/a&gt;. Maulgar surrounded himself with only the most powerful of his clan and led these elite few into battle, commanding them to augment his tremendous fighting abilities with their potent &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;. With such powerful allies at his side and the rest of the Bladespire clan at his command, Maulgar had become the most dangerous ogre in all of Outland.\nRank.\nOgre lords are large, two-headed ogres or or ogres in unique armor. Many of the ogre lords rallied the remnants of their people that were scattered when the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt; fell. Though their plans were unknown, there was no doubt that these powerful, deceptively intelligent warriors would gather their forces once more. Using their immense bulk to terrorize their lesser ilk into service, ogre lords were often encountered guarding &lt;a href=\"gold%20mine\"&gt;gold mine&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Fountain%20of%20Health\"&gt;healing pools&lt;/a&gt; and other valuable locations. Although they did not cast spells, ogre lords made up for their lack of magic with pure brawn, blasting their tree-trunk sized clubs into their enemies' skulls with unequaled fury.\nIn the RPG.\nOgre lords emerged to stake claims on the wild lands of the region of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, resulting in rising clashes between all races in the region."}
{"id": "134164", "revid": "3154973", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=134164", "title": "Ogre mage", "text": "Ogre magi, ogre-magi, or ogre-mages (singular: ogre mage, ogre-mage, or ogre magus) are two-headed &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt; spellcasters who are typically larger and more intelligent than their one-headed brethren. They often enjoy an elevated position among the ogre clans.\nHistory.\nThe early ogres' practice of sorcery and exposure to raw &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; magic had some unexpected side effects. Very rarely, children would be born with two heads. It soon became clear that these two-headed ogres were exceptional spellcasters, and their appearance was seen as a good omen. In time, &lt;a href=\"Goria\"&gt;Goria&lt;/a&gt;'s arcanists even developed spells to replicate this phenomenon, causing normal ogres to grow a second head and increasing their intelligence and magical aptitude.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; and his followers chiseled away at one of the &lt;a href=\"high%20elf\"&gt;high elven&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"runestone\"&gt;runestone&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; to create structures known as the &lt;a href=\"Altar%20of%20Storms\"&gt;Altars of Storms&lt;/a&gt;. Gul'dan then turned to the ancient arcane rituals that were once used by the Highmaul ogres to create two-headed ogres. Few living ogres knew of this technique, but Gul'dan's follower &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt; was one of them. He handpicked the ogres who would undergo the transformation and oversaw the rituals himself. Before long, ogre magi emerged from the altars, and they were just as powerful as Gul'dan had hoped, and more importantly, they secretly swore their loyalty to him.\nBiology.\nTwo-headed ogre magi are noted as being larger and stronger than their non-magical brethren, and having slightly different proportions; shorter arms, less bowed legs, and carrying themselves with greater alertness. The ritual to create ogre magi also creates an extra head.\nTwo heads.\nOne especially notable feature of some ogre magi is that their twin heads act, think, and speak independently of one another. The most notorious example of this is &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt;, whose right head is shown to be more well-spoken and reserved while his left head is louder and more fanatical. Another notable example is &lt;a href=\"Warbringer%20O%27mrogg\"&gt;Warbringer O'mrogg&lt;/a&gt;, whose two heads have always struggled to agree on even the simplest matters. Two years ago, O'mrogg began a twelve-step plan to develop a synergy between his warring personalities. His heads have yet to decide on which step to start with.\nHowever, this is not always the case: the twin heads of &lt;a href=\"Dentarg\"&gt;Dentarg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Torkus\"&gt;Torkus&lt;/a&gt;, and all speak in unison (although the former two refer to themselves as \"we\" rather than \"I\"). In fact, Mar'gok is puzzled when one of his heads begins to get dizzy after having stared out across &lt;a href=\"Highmaul\"&gt;Highmaul&lt;/a&gt; for hours, as he notes that his two brains have always worked together in much the same way two legs should. Directly thereafter, the imperator ponders how it would be to experience the world like one of his one-headed, one-brained, two-eyed subjects, and muses that it would be impossible to rule that way, as he would have to focus his entire gaze and all his thoughts on a single point at a time, and everything would seem blurry.\nSome sources like the novel, \"&lt;a href=\"Tides%20of%20Darkness\"&gt;Tides of Darkness&lt;/a&gt;\" and ' depict all shown two-headed ogres as ogre magi with implications that all two-headed ogres are ogre mages. Other materials like \"&lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20II\"&gt;Warcraft II&lt;/a&gt;\" and ' show most ogres as two-headed. \"Warcraft II\" distinguished ogre magi from regular two-headed ogres by runic markings, greater intelligence, and better teamwork, \"Warcraft III\" identified ogre magi by giving them blue skin.\nAs shown by Torkus and his children \u2014 &lt;a href=\"Torkus%20Jr.\"&gt;Torkus Jr.&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tork\"&gt;Tork&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Torki\"&gt;Torki&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 the offspring of a two-headed ogre magi will also have two heads and presumably magical abilities.\n\"\" also depicts non-magi two-headed ogres, with \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" rarely showing the same like &lt;a href=\"Stonard%20Ogre\"&gt;Stonard Ogre&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Splinter%20Fist%20Enslaver\"&gt;Splinter Fist Enslaver&lt;/a&gt; mobs.\nAdditionally, \"Warlords of Draenor\" and \"Warcraft III: Reforged\" depict one-headed ogre mages on rare occasions.\nIn the RPG.\nHistory.\nOgre magi came into existence in the Second War, when the orc warlock &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; carved up the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;elven&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"runestone\"&gt;runestone&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Caer%20Darrow\"&gt;Caer Darrow&lt;/a&gt; and used its mystic powers to imbue Ogre enforcers with the ability and intelligence to cast &lt;a href=\"spell\"&gt;spell&lt;/a&gt;s. The experiment was a success, with the only noticeable side effect the fact that it turned the ogres' skin blue. A small price to pay for the power they wield \u2014 indeed, blue skin is now a sign of cunning, potential and might among ogres.\nOther sources of history state that the ogre magi race was created by the magics of the &lt;a href=\"Altar%20of%20Storms\"&gt;Altar of Storms&lt;/a&gt; and that Cho'gall was the first to be changed, having been a normal ogre before hand.\nFollowing the Second War Ogre magi have become a lot more common. It is speculated that they can breed to produce their own kind (confirmed by &lt;a href=\"Torkus\"&gt;Torkus&lt;/a&gt; and his many sons), while others think that some ogre magi \u2014 or darker forces \u2014 have developed a way to create more of them. Whatever the case, though ogre magi don\u2019t appear in the numbers they did in the Second War, they are still a part of Azeroth. Because of their intelligence, and the fact that they often desire to search for arcane knowledge to enhance their spellcasting abilities, ogre magi are more likely to adventure than other ogres. Many remain with their own kind and have become advisors to the chieftains of their tribes or leaders in their own right. Their spells, combined with their physical might, make them self-sufficient. Adventuring ogre magi are uncommon, and meet with stares or violence in civilized towns, but they possess the smarts necessary to talk their way out of many volatile situations. Ogre magi allied with the &lt;a href=\"Stonemaul%20clan\"&gt;Stonemaul clan&lt;/a&gt; are welcome in any Horde settlement, but the Alliance views all ogres as savages and enemies.\nIn many ways, ogre magi are similar to their less intelligent brethren. They belong to the same society. Because of their intellects and magic powers, ogre magi are often in leadership positions in an ogre clan. However, because they focus on developing their spellcasting potential, they are often not as strong physically as other ogres, and ogre chieftains and warlords are usually mighty barbarians or warriors instead of magi. However, such a leader usually has one or more ogre magi advising and assisting him.\nLike normal ogres, some ogre magi have two heads. Their heads usually get along with each other. A two-headed ogre mage is not different from a one-headed ogre mage having the same characteristics, including equal intelligence.\n&lt;a href=\"Half-ogre%20mage\"&gt;Half-ogre mage&lt;/a&gt; is the term for the theoretical &lt;a href=\"half-breed\"&gt;half-breed&lt;/a&gt; offspring between ogre magi and &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s. However, the ogre magi refused to mate with orcs for the purpose of creating &lt;a href=\"mok%27nathal\"&gt;mok'nathal&lt;/a&gt;. Their existence is rare if unlikely.\nCulture.\nOgre magi are less chaotic than their brethren. Their intellect creates an awareness of power structures and allows them to understand political machinations. Ogre magi respect power; thus they served Gul'dan in the Second War. Most ogre magi are ambitious and seek to secure both political and magic power. These ogre magi have since become the spiritual leaders of the ogre tribes. They provide spells and magical items to protect the tribes from more established civilizations. Magi are the healers, record-keepers, and advisors to the chieftains. A given tribe will have ogre magi, usually one for every ten individuals. That is a twenty-member tribe will have two ogre magi or one ogre magus. Occasionally a chief will be an ogre magus, but this is rare. They favor the sorcerer class, though healers, shamans, and warlocks are common. A few rare ogre magi become wizards, but the need for writing materials can limit their pursuit of magic.\nLanguage.\nOgre magi speak &lt;a href=\"Common%20%28language%29\"&gt;Common&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Low%20Common\"&gt;Low Common&lt;/a&gt;. Ogre magi enjoy learning other languages including &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20%28language%29\"&gt;Goblin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Orcish%20%28language%29\"&gt;Orcish&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Taur-ahe\"&gt;Taur-ahe&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Zandali\"&gt;Zandali&lt;/a&gt;.\nAppearance.\nIn addition to gaining intelligence, a newly created ogre mage\u2019s skin turns blue. Those who pursue the path of the warlock develop a blue tinge to their skin, a side-effect of wielding necromantic energies."}

They are often built around steam vents, implying that ogres seem to prefer dark and hot areas.\nFirst War.\nWhile not an ogre mound, an abandoned part of the &lt;a href=\"Deadmines\"&gt;Deadmines&lt;/a&gt; was used as a refuge by &lt;a href=\"Turok\"&gt;Turok&lt;/a&gt;'s rogue band of ogres during the times of the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;. Ogres could only be found in other similar &lt;a href=\"dungeon\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt;s-style maps.\nSecond War.\nAfter being trained in the rudiments of combat at the &lt;a href=\"Barracks%20%28WC2%20Orc%29\"&gt;barracks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ogre%20%28Warcraft%20II%29\"&gt;ogres&lt;/a&gt; congregated at these crude, stone huts to enhance their endurance, strength and speed. These two-headed titans increased their great strength by engaging in contests which involved the hurling and crushing of giant rocks. This served to increase their already formidable strength and resilience - and those that did escape the pounding delivered by their brethren found themselves the quicker for it. Even the half-witted &lt;a href=\"Peon%20%28Warcraft%20II%29\"&gt;peons&lt;/a&gt; dared not come near this place, for stray boulders tended to find the heads of inattentive visitors.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nOgre mounds can be found all throughout &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; - an ogre mound is usually found anywhere ogres are living, but the ogres are capable of also creating more sophisticated dwellings. The citizens of the &lt;a href=\"Gorian%20Empire\"&gt;Gorian Empire&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Draenor%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;alternate Draenor&lt;/a&gt; lived in elaborate cities of stone during the height of their civilization.\n&lt;a href=\"Glubtok\"&gt;Glubtok&lt;/a&gt; is said to have burned his own ogre mound."}

They take place in &lt;a href=\"Silithus%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Winterspring%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Winterspring&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Un%27Goro%20Crater%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Un'Goro Crater&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Azshara%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt;.\nOfficial description.\nReports of elemental incursions in different parts of Kalimdor are increasing. Every few days, a new wave of elementals blasts its way into the regions of Silithus, Un'Goro Crater, Azshara, and Winterspring - ostensibly, for the sole reason of seeing just how far into these territories they can penetrate before being beaten back by the forces of the Horde or the Alliance. Investigate these regions and aid your allies in countering these mysterious invasions.\nWhat happens during an invasion?\nAt the beginning of an elemental invasion, portals will open to the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Plane\"&gt;Elemental Plane&lt;/a&gt; and invaders will begin to pass through. Thus, during an invasion, you will find two to three times as many elementals in the area, usually slightly higher in level than the standard ones found there.\nAt some point during the invasion, the elemental leader will appear and begin yelling challenges that can be heard by all in the area. While the elemental leaders are alive, more and more invaders will spawn. Once the leader has been destroyed, no new invaders will appear, although those already present will remain until they are killed.\nHow often do invasions happen?\nNo timetable has yet been determined, though some rumors suggest once every three days.\nIt has been shown that at least &lt;a href=\"Princess%20Tempestria\"&gt;Princess Tempestria&lt;/a&gt; can spawn within a 40-48 hour period.\nTypes and locations of invaders.\nBlazing Invaders.\n&lt;a href=\"Blazing%20Invader\"&gt;Blazing Invader&lt;/a&gt;s appear at the &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Plume%20Ridge\"&gt;Fire Plume Ridge&lt;/a&gt; volcano in &lt;a href=\"Un%27Goro%20Crater%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Un'Goro Crater&lt;/a&gt;. Visually, they look similar to regular fire elementals but are green-yellow in color. When you approach the volcano and see glowing blue-green portals floating slightly off the ground, you know an invasion is in progress.\n&lt;a href=\"Baron%20Charr\"&gt;Baron Charr&lt;/a&gt; leads the Blazing Invaders. He heralds his invasion with a challenge: \"Hear me, denizens of the crater! I come to burn this land of its impurity!\" While he is patrolling, Charr frequently yells, \"Where are the so-called heroes of this world? Too frightened to come out and play?\" When he vanishes, he yells a final taunt, \"You have not seen the last of me fools! All will be consumed in the end!\"\nThundering Invaders.\n&lt;a href=\"Thundering%20Invader\"&gt;Thundering Invader&lt;/a&gt;s appear in northeast &lt;a href=\"Azshara%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt; on the upper part of the crescent of land. Visually, they look virtually indistinguishable from regular rock elementals. Fighting the thundering invaders is especially hazardous, as they wander the same area as the elite giants, and the unwary adventurer can often find himself beset on all sides.\nThe Thundering Invaders are led by &lt;a href=\"Avalanchion\"&gt;Avalanchion&lt;/a&gt;. Although immensely powerful, he seems to be significantly less intelligent than either Charr or Tempestria, yelling out taunts like \"Where you hiding? Me find you!\"\nWatery Invaders.\n&lt;a href=\"Watery%20Invader\"&gt;Watery Invader&lt;/a&gt;s appear on &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Kel%27Theril\"&gt;Lake Kel'Theril&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Winterspring%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Winterspring&lt;/a&gt;. When you near the lake and see glowing blue holes floating above the ice, you know an invasion is in progress.\n&lt;a href=\"Princess%20Tempestria\"&gt;Princess Tempestria&lt;/a&gt; leads the Watery Invaders. She and Baron Charr are definitely the most intelligent of the invasion leaders. Tempestria imperiously demands, \"This frozen land shall suffice for a start. Come to me, mortals - and I shall give you a quick and painful death.\"\nWhirling Invaders.\n&lt;a href=\"Whirling%20Invader\"&gt;Whirling Invader&lt;/a&gt;s appear in Northwest &lt;a href=\"Silithus%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;, and resemble silver-black versions of regular air elementals, crackling with blue-green electricity. Look for greenish white shimmery portals as a sign of their invasion.\nThe Whirling Invaders are led by &lt;a href=\"The%20Windreaver\"&gt;The Windreaver&lt;/a&gt;, who travels with his four guards throughout the Dust Stormer area of Silithus. Those unfortunate enough to see him appear receive dire warnings: \"The Windreaver and his invading forces appear amidst a tumultuous conflagration in the northwest of Silithus.\""}

Their purpose was to keep the world of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; in a perpetual state of chaos, thriving in such a state. In primordial &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, they were defeated and enslaved as part of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Empire\"&gt;armies&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s.\n\"Note: Not all \"lords\" found among elementals are Elemental Lords (capital). For example, there are many &lt;a href=\"firelord\"&gt;firelord&lt;/a&gt;s, but only one fire Elemental Lord, Smolderon.\"\nHistory.\nPrimordial Azeroth.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Elemental\"&gt;elemental spirits&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; became more and more erratic as the fifth element, &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20of%20Life\"&gt;Spirit&lt;/a&gt;, became less available. The slumbering &lt;a href=\"world-soul\"&gt;world-soul&lt;/a&gt; consumed much of it, rendering the elements of Azeroth extremely violent and destructive.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"elemental%20wars\"&gt;elemental wars&lt;/a&gt;, the elementals raged freely on primordial &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, waging war upon one another for endless millennia, and the four Elemental Lords reigned supreme over innumerable lesser spirits. &lt;a href=\"Al%27Akir\"&gt;Al'Akir&lt;/a&gt; used to send his minions to spy on his enemies and sow distrust to weaken them. &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; embraced brute force, seeking to boil the seas, reduce mountains to slag, and choke the skies with ash. &lt;a href=\"Therazane\"&gt;Therazane&lt;/a&gt; was reclusive, entrenching herself behind towering mountain ranges before attacking her exhausted foes. &lt;a href=\"Neptulon\"&gt;Neptulon&lt;/a&gt; fought strategically, allowing the forces of the other elements to clash, before crushing his divided rivals.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s plummeted down from the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;Great Dark Beyond&lt;/a&gt;, they slammed into Azeroth's surface and embedded themselves in the continent of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor%20%28landmass%29\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. For the first time in history, the four Elemental Lords banded together in an attempt to fight the Old Gods' fledgling empire. Though the elementals were mighty, they could not stand against the constant swarm of &lt;a href=\"n%27raqi\"&gt;n'raqi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"aqir\"&gt;aqir&lt;/a&gt;, and they were enslaved by the Old Gods. Without the native spirits of Azeroth to counter the Old Gods' influence, the borders of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Empire\"&gt;Black Empire&lt;/a&gt; crept over much of the world.\nThe &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt; armies of the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; would eventually come to assault the Old Gods, defeat them and sealing them deep beneath the surface of the planet, after having imprisoned the elemental armies in the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Plane\"&gt;Elemental Plane&lt;/a&gt;, divided into four regions: the &lt;a href=\"Abyssal%20Maw\"&gt;Abyssal Maw&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Firelands\"&gt;Firelands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Deepholm\"&gt;Deepholm&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Skywall\"&gt;Skywall&lt;/a&gt;.\nElemental Sundering.\nEven while locked within the Elemental Plane, the Elemental Lords continued to war with each other. The &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Sundering\"&gt;Elemental Sundering&lt;/a&gt; was a 5,000 year-long battle at the core of Azeroth. The Lieutenants of Ragnaros, &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Geddon\"&gt;Geddon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Garr\"&gt;Garr&lt;/a&gt;, perpetrated the betrayal against &lt;a href=\"Thunderaan\"&gt;Thunderaan&lt;/a&gt;, Prince of Air, who was caught unaware. The Firelord's advances were wholly unknown to Thunderaan, and before he could react, &lt;a href=\"Sulfuras%2C%20Hand%20of%20Ragnaros\"&gt;Sulfuras&lt;/a&gt;, legendary hammer of Ragnaros, struck an unmerciful blow, and Thunderaan fell, utterly defeated.\nThe Firelord feasted upon the essence of Thunderaan but was unable to consume him entirely. He stored what little remained of Thunderaan's essence within a talisman of elemental binding. Ragnaros then shattered the talisman in two flawless pieces, called the &lt;a href=\"Bindings%20of%20the%20Windseeker\"&gt;Bindings of the Windseeker&lt;/a&gt;, and assigned them to his lieutenants.\nWar of the Three Hammers.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;War of the Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt;, 230 years before the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, Ragnaros the Firelord was summoned to the &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer-Thane%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Sorcerer-Thane Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt;. It was his intent to use the Firelord for domination of the other dwarf clans. Ironically, however, Ragnaros enslaved them for his own purposes. His violent entry into the world scarred the surrounding area, creating &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Steppes\"&gt;Burning Steppes&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Searing%20Gorge\"&gt;Searing Gorge&lt;/a&gt;.\nRecent events.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, Ragnaros and his fire elemental armies were locked in a war for control of Blackrock Moutain with the black dragon &lt;a href=\"Nefarian\"&gt;Nefarian&lt;/a&gt;.\nNeptulon, then at war with &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt;, seemed to use mostly mortal races to weaken the forces of the other three Elemental Lords. His agent, &lt;a href=\"Duke%20Hydraxis\"&gt;Duke Hydraxis&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the &lt;a href=\"Hydraxian%20Waterlords\"&gt;Hydraxian Waterlords&lt;/a&gt;, sought to bring others to his side. He sent &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s into the &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Core\"&gt;Molten Core&lt;/a&gt; to fight against the Firelord. Another agent, &lt;a href=\"Tsunaman\"&gt;Tsunaman&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Sun%20Rock%20Retreat\"&gt;Sun Rock Retreat&lt;/a&gt;, also sought to destroy Ragnaros's elementals in the &lt;a href=\"Charred%20Vale\"&gt;Charred Vale&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; entered Azeroth from &lt;a href=\"Deepholm\"&gt;Deepholm&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"World%20Pillar\"&gt;World Pillar&lt;/a&gt; was shattered, causing the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Plane\"&gt;Elemental Plane&lt;/a&gt; to collapse onto Azeroth, and parts of it to manifest in the real world. While &lt;a href=\"Al%27Akir\"&gt;Al'Akir&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; accepted &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;'s offer of sowing destruction, &lt;a href=\"Neptulon\"&gt;Neptulon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Therazane\"&gt;Therazane&lt;/a&gt; refused to do so.\nRagnaros's armies launched a full-scale assault on &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt the World Tree &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Guardians%20of%20Hyjal\"&gt;Guardians of Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hamuul%20Runetotem\"&gt;Hamuul Runetotem&lt;/a&gt; along with the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; pushed his minions back into the &lt;a href=\"Firelands\"&gt;Firelands&lt;/a&gt;, where he was slain.\nNeptulon the Tidehunter was attacked by the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"n%27raqi\"&gt;n'raqi&lt;/a&gt; that worked with the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer%20cult\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer cult&lt;/a&gt;, while Therazane was also at odds with the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; that had intruded in &lt;a href=\"Deepholm\"&gt;Deepholm&lt;/a&gt;.\nAl'akir called the &lt;a href=\"Conclave%20of%20Wind\"&gt;Conclave of Wind&lt;/a&gt;, ancient wind elementals nearly as powerful as Al'Akir himself, to aid in the elemental invasion of his former home. \nHe assisted Deathwing's efforts at reclaiming the ancient re-origination device and lent his elemental forces at crushing &lt;a href=\"Uldum\"&gt;Uldum&lt;/a&gt;'s native defenders and his old enemy, the &lt;a href=\"Tol%27vir\"&gt;Tol'vir&lt;/a&gt;. One of his first acts after the Cataclysm was destroying the inhabitants of &lt;a href=\"Orsis\"&gt;Orsis&lt;/a&gt; in revenge for having refused Deathwing's offer of curing their &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Flesh\"&gt;Curse of Flesh&lt;/a&gt;. The armies and strongest minions of Al'Akir resided within the &lt;a href=\"Vortex%20Pinnacle\"&gt;Vortex Pinnacle&lt;/a&gt;, training in formation and torturing tol'vir as they prepared to lash out yet again at Uldum. At some point prior to his death, Al'Akir ensnared and twisted &lt;a href=\"Hagara%20the%20Stormbinder\"&gt;Hagara the Stormbinder&lt;/a&gt; with new powers for trying to bind elementals to her will.\nDwelling in the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20the%20Four%20Winds\"&gt;Throne of the Four Winds&lt;/a&gt;, Al'Akir was slain in his home plane, the &lt;a href=\"Skywall\"&gt;Skywall&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt; managed to make the four Elemental Lords band together against the Legion. Shaman and elementals worked actively to fight the Legion off the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;. They also helped new ones to replace Ragnaros and Al'Akir: &lt;a href=\"Smolderon\"&gt;Smolderon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thunderaan\"&gt;Thunderaan&lt;/a&gt; respectively.\nAfter deciding that the power of the &lt;a href=\"Doomstone\"&gt;Doomstone&lt;/a&gt; was too great, all four elemental lords agreed that the Earthen Ring should keep the artifact under their watch at the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Azeroth%20%28Class%20Hall%29\"&gt;Heart of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20Ragnaros\"&gt;Cult of Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; comprised of dark iron dwarves began attempting to revive him, preferring his rule to the rule of &lt;a href=\"Moira%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Moira Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt;. During this time Smolderon went missing.\nNeptulon was present in &lt;a href=\"Nazjatar\"&gt;Nazjatar&lt;/a&gt; during the Alliance and Horde's efforts against &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt;, though the &lt;a href=\"Tidestone%20of%20Golganneth\"&gt;Tidestone of Golganneth&lt;/a&gt; kept him from being able to help much.\nDragonflight.\nFollowing &lt;a href=\"Fyrakk\"&gt;Fyrakk&lt;/a&gt;'s alliance with the &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Flame\"&gt;Druids of the Flame&lt;/a&gt; and entry into the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;, Smolderon has been shown to throw his lot in with the Primal Incarnate with the intention of expanding his domain and appears in the assault on &lt;a href=\"Amirdrassil\"&gt;Amirdrassil&lt;/a&gt;. However, despite his power, Smolderon failed to defeat the World Tree's defenders, leading to his death. The last of his flames would be absorbed by Fyrakk to empower himself to breach into Amirdrassil's core.\nElemental powers.\nElemental Lords have the power to take control over specific elementals of their own type, but only when those elementals are within the area of its divine presence. This ability does not work on primal or elder elementals. All smaller elementals will obey their Lord unquestioningly. Larger ones usually do also, but should they wish to resist the Lieutenant's commands, they may attempt to do so, but it is unlikely for that to happen. The Elemental Lord can also break another being's control of a summoned or enchanted elemental; those who have control over the elemental will have a difficult time maintaining control. Should the controller maintain command of the elemental, the Elemental Lord may not make another attempt to control or command that elemental for one full day.\nWhenever a spell is cast of the same magic type within the area of the Lord's presence, it becomes instantly aware and can take control of the magic as he wishes. The spell can be countered, transferred to another target or area, or reflected back at the caster. This ability also functions against elemental spell-like abilities employed by other creatures, elementals or otherwise, with the sole exception of those used by creatures more powerful than the Elemental Lord. In much the same vein, the Elemental Lords can exert their control over magical items which employ spell or spell-like abilities, with the sole exception of those imbued within major artifacts.\nSpeculation.\nElemental lords.\nAmphitheater of Anguish.\nLords which can be found in the &lt;a href=\"Amphitheater%20of%20Anguish\"&gt;Amphitheater of Anguish&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;\":\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

The &lt;a href=\"prison\"&gt;prison&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"plane\"&gt;plane&lt;/a&gt; consists of four interlinked domains, each representing one of the major elements - &lt;a href=\"Skywall\"&gt;Skywall&lt;/a&gt; (air), &lt;a href=\"Deepholm\"&gt;Deepholm&lt;/a&gt; (earth), the &lt;a href=\"Abyssal%20Maw\"&gt;Abyssal Maw&lt;/a&gt; (water) and the &lt;a href=\"Firelands\"&gt;Firelands&lt;/a&gt; (fire). &lt;a href=\"Highlord%20Demitrian\"&gt;Highlord Demitrian&lt;/a&gt; described it as \"the core of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;this world&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThe four domains of the Elemental Plane are featured in the \"\" expansion.\nBackground.\nCreation.\n&lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s native elementals wreaked havoc across the world while they served as the lieutenants of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s. After defeating them, the &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt; chose not to destroy the elementals, since they were bound to Azeroth and would manifest again. Instead, the titan-forged chose to imprison them in a pocket dimension. Four domains were created within this primordial realm to serve as ideal environments for each type of elemental - The &lt;a href=\"Skywall\"&gt;Skywall&lt;/a&gt; (air), &lt;a href=\"Deepholm\"&gt;Deepholm&lt;/a&gt; (earth), The &lt;a href=\"Abyssal%20Maw\"&gt;Abyssal Maw&lt;/a&gt; (water) and The &lt;a href=\"Firelands\"&gt;Firelands&lt;/a&gt; (fire). &lt;a href=\"Ra\"&gt;Highkeeper Ra&lt;/a&gt;, one of the Keepers, and &lt;a href=\"Helya\"&gt;Helya&lt;/a&gt;, a titan-forged, created the Plane for the titans and used &lt;a href=\"The%20Highkeeper%27s%20Ward\"&gt;The Highkeeper's Ward&lt;/a&gt; to seal off the Elemental Plane from Azeroth. For ages since, the elementals of air, water, earth, and fire have engaged in endless strife with each other, waging titanic battles in the confines of their realm. The greatest of their battles was the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Sundering\"&gt;Elemental Sundering&lt;/a&gt;. With the elementals' departure, nature calmed, and the world settled into a peaceful harmony.\nWar of the Three Hammers.\n300 years before the opening of the Dark Portal, &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; the Firelord who commanded the &lt;a href=\"Firelands\"&gt;Fire domain&lt;/a&gt; in the plane, was summoned by &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt; to battle their enemies in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;War of the Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt;. The catastrophic summoning blasted the land and immolated the Dark Irons, and Ragnaros sunk into the depths of &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt; to prepare his return.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nRecently the elementals have learned to open portals to start &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Invasions%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Elemental Invasions&lt;/a&gt;. At the beginning of an elemental invasion, portals will open to the elemental planes and invaders will begin to pass through. Thus, during an invasion you will find two to three times as many elementals in the area, usually slightly higher in level than the standard ones found there.\nCataclysm.\nShortly before the Cataclysm, &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Rift\"&gt;Elemental Rift&lt;/a&gt;s spawned in nearly every zone on Azeroth. Following &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;'s Shattering of the &lt;a href=\"World%20Pillar\"&gt;World Pillar&lt;/a&gt; in Deepholm and his destructive re-emergence into Azeroth, the Elemental Plane collided with the physical realm and resulted in drastic geographical upheaval, causing chaotic elementals to pour out into the world of Azeroth. The boundary between the mortal planes and the elemental plane was severely damaged and the elemental plane domains can now be reached through various means by the heroes of Azeroth.\nThe Abyssal Maw is accessed at the bottom of &lt;a href=\"Vashj%27ir\"&gt;Vashj'ir&lt;/a&gt; through the &lt;a href=\"Abyssal%20Breach\"&gt;Abyssal Breach&lt;/a&gt; and hosts the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20the%20Tides\"&gt;Throne of the Tides&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Firelands appear through portals in &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"flamegate\"&gt;flamegate&lt;/a&gt;s leading to four isolated locations.\nDeepholm is accessible from going into the &lt;a href=\"Maelstrom\"&gt;Maelstrom&lt;/a&gt; and from portals at the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Earthshrine\"&gt;Eastern&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Western%20Earthshrine\"&gt;Western Earthshrine&lt;/a&gt;. Deepholm hosts the &lt;a href=\"Stonecore\"&gt;Stonecore&lt;/a&gt; and is the home of the &lt;a href=\"Therazane%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Therazane&lt;/a&gt; faction.\nSkywall is reachable from &lt;a href=\"Uldum\"&gt;Uldum&lt;/a&gt; with portals to the &lt;a href=\"Vortex%20Pinnacle\"&gt;Vortex Pinnacle&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20the%20Four%20Winds\"&gt;Throne of the Four Winds&lt;/a&gt; in the air elemental domain.\nLater in Mount Hyjal, a portal is opened in &lt;a href=\"Nordune%20Ridge\"&gt;Nordune Ridge&lt;/a&gt; leading to an open area of the Firelands the &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Front\"&gt;Molten Front&lt;/a&gt;, and through &lt;a href=\"Sulfuron%20Spire\"&gt;Sulfuron Spire&lt;/a&gt; a raid is led into the &lt;a href=\"Firelands%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Firelands' inner sanctums&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nSome time after &lt;a href=\"Al%27Akir\"&gt;Al'Akir&lt;/a&gt;'s death, when &lt;a href=\"Typhinius\"&gt;Typhinius&lt;/a&gt; obtained the &lt;a href=\"Fists%20of%20the%20Heavens\"&gt;Fists of the Heavens&lt;/a&gt; and returned to the Skywall, he immediately set out to end the air elementals' civil war. He flung the spirits of those who had opposed him into the other elemental realms. Alone, they could not stop their natural enemies from finishing them off in a slow and agonizing fashion.\nDragonflight.\nThe elementals that the &lt;a href=\"Primalists\"&gt;Primalists&lt;/a&gt; summoned as their reinforcements through elemental gateways on the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt; were from the Elemental Planes.\nLocations in-game.\nThe Elemental Plane is featured in open world &lt;a href=\"zone\"&gt;zone&lt;/a&gt;s and in &lt;a href=\"instance\"&gt;instance&lt;/a&gt;s:\nIn the RPG.\nDuring the several millennia, the elementals grew attached to their adopted home. Then, the summoners of Quel'thalas and the human magocracy learned to command the elementals, inadvertently opening momentary pinholes between Azeroth and the Elemental Plane. Elementals are sometimes called back to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; for short periods of time, but most are eager to return to their world when the spell that summoned them ends.\nGeography.\nThe Elemental Plane is described as \"a prison plane in the Twisting Nether\". The Elemental Plane was fashioned by the titans as a separate plane within the Twisting Nether to hold their old foes. The plane the titans created is spherical and comparatively small \u2014 about the size of a single world. It is a three-tiered realm. The domain of Air sits atop the middle layer, which supports both the Water and Earth domains. Beneath these lies a third layer of Fire and molten rock.\nThe sphere of the plane itself is curved in a curious way that tends to baffle creatures of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s reality. As befits the plane's prison function, escaping through ordinary movement is impossible. A creature attempting to move out of the sphere simply curves inexorably around, moving toward the other side. Thus, if one were to sail across the ocean in a boat, he would eventually arrive on the exact opposite side of the plane's sole continent. The land itself is slightly larger than &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, while the seas are about the same width in all directions. The continent is known as &lt;a href=\"Deepholm%23In%20the%20RPG\"&gt;Deephome&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; appears to agree with Highlord Demitrian as he thinks that \"atop of the Elemental Plane sat the mortal, material &lt;a href=\"planet\"&gt;worlds&lt;/a&gt;\". It would look like any other world to an outsider \u2014 at least, when looked upon from above or on the ground: one large continent surrounded by water, with a yellow sun burning above. A casual visitor, arriving on the surface, might even believe he is on an ordinary \u2014 if somewhat violent \u2014 planet. A glowing yellow orb, casting forth light and heat, hovers near the top point of the globe, acting as the \"sun\" for the entire plane.\nTraits.\nCommunicating with elementals is difficult, and they have provided little information about the nature of their realm. But it is known, that lava flows, earthquakes, windstorms, and tsunami are common, making the Elemental Plane a very dangerous place to visit. Normal levels of gravity pull physical objects toward the bottom of the sphere, where the realm of fire lies. The four elements that make up the plane are constantly in opposition and tend to shift and tear at each other, sometimes violently. Volcanoes rip through the solid mantle, assaulting both the land and sea realms wherever they can. The air swirls in unpredictable storms, producing whirlwinds and hurricanes that rake the surface. The elemental beings can alter the plane with a thought. The landscape shifts on its own from time to time. Spells and spell-like abilities with the air, earth, fire and/or water descriptor are empowered and enlarged in all regions of the Elemental Plane.\nAzeroth's denizens have few dealings with the Elemental Plane, though they can access it with magic. It can also be accessed with \"transit nodes\", which are specific locations in Azeroth that connect with the Elemental Plane; these transit nodes exist only in specific elemental-based locations, such as within a volcano, underneath deep oceans or lakes, and the like.\nCreatures.\nEach of the realms is filled with life of various types, although the Abyssal Maw is mostly populated by elementals. The native creatures are just as dangerous, as the world plays home to angry elemental creatures of all types. A few natural animals can also be found, including some creatures never seen on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. These creatures have adapted to survive in the environment, and the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Lord\"&gt;Elemental Lord&lt;/a&gt;s take special care to protect them. The basic &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt; types can be found in the plane, and there are examples of &lt;a href=\"elemental%20conglomerate\"&gt;elemental conglomerate&lt;/a&gt;s as well."}

Ultimately, Ragnaros prevailed over the Prince of Air and fed on his essence as planned. The Firelord stored what remained of Thunderaan in the &lt;a href=\"%3ABindings%20of%20the%20Windseeker\"&gt;:Bindings of the Windseeker&lt;/a&gt;.\nThunderaan would be successfully summoned on Azeroth from the bindings by mortals in a later age.\nHistory.\nIn the years preceding the arrival of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and the subsequent &lt;a href=\"Rise%20of%20the%20Black%20Empire\"&gt;rise of their Black Empire&lt;/a&gt;, the world was inhabited by the &lt;a href=\"elemental%20lord\"&gt;elemental lord&lt;/a&gt;s. These powerful beings each represented one of the primal forces of the world (earth, air, fire, and water) and largely fought among themselves for eons.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"First%20Age%20of%20Creation\"&gt;First Age of Creation&lt;/a&gt;, the lord of fire, &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt;, harbored the goal of slaying one of his counterparts' heirs\u2014&lt;a href=\"Prince%20Thunderaan\"&gt;Prince Thunderaan&lt;/a&gt;, the Prince of Air\u2014and thus further developing his own power and influence. Despite the magnitude of the Firelord's ambitions, Thunderaan remained totally unaware of the threat and was not prepared for the attack.\nUltimately, it proved to be Ragnaros's &lt;a href=\"lieutenant\"&gt;lieutenant&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Geddon\"&gt;Geddon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Garr\"&gt;Garr&lt;/a&gt;, who betrayed Prince Thunderaan. Before Thunderaan could even react to the situation, Ragnaros himself struck him down with his legendary hammer, &lt;a href=\"Sulfuras%2C%20Hand%20of%20Ragnaros\"&gt;Sulfuras&lt;/a&gt;. Having triumphed, Ragnaros proceeded to feast upon the fallen lord's very essence, absorbing his power, although he was unable to consume Thunderaan's being entirely. As such, the Firelord stored what remained of the essence within a talisman of elemental binding.\nTo complete the process, Ragnaros finally shattered this talisman into two &lt;a href=\"Bindings%20of%20the%20Windseeker\"&gt;separate, flawless pieces&lt;/a&gt;, which he assigned to each of his two lieutenants.\nAftermath.\nThunderaan's defeat at Ragnaros's hands, though it did not kill him, ensured that he would never appear on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; again for millennia to come. Far in the future, mortal adventurers would eventually reforge the talisman containing the essence of Thunderaan after raiding Ragnaros's &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Core\"&gt;Molten Core&lt;/a&gt;. These mortals were successful in resummoning Thunderaan and defeat him once more to claim &lt;a href=\"Thunderfury%2C%20Blessed%20Blade%20of%20the%20Windseeker\"&gt;his fabled weapon&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith the advent of the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, Prince Thunderaan was finally fully resurrected by members of the &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt;, who enlisted his aid as the restored Windlord in battling the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;."}

The event culminated in elementals attacking &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt;. Players defeating these elementals and freeing trapped citizens within their entire city were granted access to two special boss encounters. Until the name Elemental Unrest was used by a Blizzard employee on the official forums, the community generally referred to this event as the Elemental Invasion. This alternative name persists in the community, however, and is used by many other fan sites to refer to the same event.\nThis event ended with the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, implemented in &lt;a href=\"patch%204.0.3a\"&gt;patch 4.0.3a&lt;/a&gt;.\nPrelude.\nStarting with the release of &lt;a href=\"patch%203.3.0\"&gt;patch 3.3.0&lt;/a&gt; (8 December 2009 for US realms), earthquakes begin in Azeroth. They are very infrequent and of mild intensity. Many players failed to notice they were even occurring.\nStarting with the release of &lt;a href=\"patch%204.0.1\"&gt;patch 4.0.1&lt;/a&gt; (12 October 2010 for US Realms) the random earthquakes begin to occur more frequently and with much greater intensity. They now have an accompanying sound effect and are very obvious when they occur. In response, the faction leaders of the Alliance and Horde &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Unrest%20meetings\"&gt;have gathered&lt;/a&gt; in Stormwind and Orgrimmar respectively to deal with this turn of events. stands at the entrance of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"throne%20room\"&gt;throne room&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn 16 October 2010 the earthquakes have longer durations. Whenever there are earthquakes near the Orgrimmar or Stormwind Auction houses, or the bank in Ironforge, dust comes down from the ceilings. \nOn 27 October the earthquakes become more frequent.\nPhase 1.\nThis phase was released on the 1st of November, 2010. The day the phase started, &lt;a href=\"Zarhym\"&gt;Zarhym&lt;/a&gt; stated \"There are four stages of the event. We're on the first.\"\nThe following changes are made to the world:\nGeneral.\nRifts have begun to form randomly in all questing zones, spawning elementals; the spawn timers are erratic, and not tied to the beginning of the hour. The first phase of the quest chains are now active. Earthquakes are now felt around the world, and not just in capital cities. Doom-preaching cultists and mysterious devices have appeared in Orgrimmar and Stormwind.\nTo obtain the &lt;a href=\"Feat%20of%20Strength\"&gt;Feat of Strength&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tripping%20the%20Rifts\"&gt;Tripping the Rifts&lt;/a&gt;, players must obtain a buff from each type of elemental portal that spawns in &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; (Earth, Fire, Water, and Wind). Players do not have to kill rifts of their level to qualify for the achievement. The daily quests &lt;a href=\"Hammering%20It%20Out\"&gt;Hammering It Out&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"A%20Natural%20Occurrence\"&gt;A Natural Occurrence&lt;/a&gt; are obtained from the mysterious devices left after the portals have been defeated. Player level must be within typical honor/experience granting range to receive the quest.\nSee &lt;a href=\"Prophecies%20Of%20Doom\"&gt;Prophecies Of Doom&lt;/a&gt; to begin the quest chains.\nFor a full list of Elemental Rift spawn locations, see .\nPhase 2.\nThis phase was released on the 8 November 2010 and simply opened up a few more quests in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;.\nPhase 3.\nThis was phase released on 12 November 2010.\nPhase 4.\nThis phase was released on 15 November 2010. The &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Rift%20%28Cataclysm%29\"&gt;elemental rift&lt;/a&gt;s in Kalimdor and Eastern Kingdoms now spawn with very high frequency, about every 10\u201315 minutes.\nPreparing for the invasion.\nBefore every invasion event starts, city guards will yell, warning players and citizens about incoming danger. , s, s, and will periodically spawn in buildings of their respective cities and run to the main entrance or nearest Evacuation Portal (the portals won't actually appear until the invasion begins, though the citizens will continue to spawn after it does. After 5 minutes have elapsed, the battle against the invasion begins.\nCombating the invasion.\nWhen the attack begins, all NPCs and interactable objects within the city will despawn. This means &lt;a href=\"flight%20master\"&gt;flight master&lt;/a&gt;s, signposts, fires, mailboxes, bankers, auctioneers, trainers, quest givers, and more will be inaccessible for the duration of the attack. In Stormwind and Ironforge, the &lt;a href=\"Deeprun%20Tram\"&gt;Deeprun Tram&lt;/a&gt; cannot be entered. Instance portals to &lt;a href=\"The%20Stockade\"&gt;The Stockade&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ragefire%20Chasm\"&gt;Ragefire Chasm&lt;/a&gt; are also unavailable, as are the two-way portals in Stormwind's &lt;a href=\"Wizard%27s%20Sanctum\"&gt;Wizard's Sanctum&lt;/a&gt; (evacuation portals exist within the Sanctum, so those inside and those teleporting to Stormwind can get out, but there is no direct path to the outside while the invasion is active), and all portals to the &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt;. City guards will be replaced with level 80 versions (regular city guards are level 75), and additional guards will spawn at key choke points. Boxes containing (Stormwind), (Thunder Bluff), (Ironforge), or (Orgrimmar) will appear throughout the city as well. At this time, players are instructed to grab barriers from stockpiles around their city (marked by green arrows) and place them in the designated regions (marked by red arrows). \ns also spawn through the city. Speaking to one of them, players can obtain an . Each city also provides an avenue of rapid escape in the form of &lt;a href=\"Evacuation%20Portal\"&gt;Evacuation Portal&lt;/a&gt; maintained throughout the city by (among the first orc mages seen before Cataclysm) in Orgrimmar, &lt;a href=\"Forsaken%20Mage%20%28Elemental%20Unrest%29\"&gt;Forsaken Mages&lt;/a&gt; (undead) in Thunder Bluff, s (gnome and dwarf- among the first dwarf mages that aren't Dark Iron dwarves seen before Cataclysm) in Ironforge, and s (human) in Stormwind. These Evacuation Portals can be used to teleport directly outside the main entrance to the city. Low-level players and those unwilling to defend the city are advised to evacuate through an Evacuation Portal. Although low-level players are able to participate in the event, the invading elementals have area-of-effect attacks that will likely instantly kill less powerful players if they are caught within them. Alliance and Horde heroes will appear in some districts as well.\nDuring the invasion, Stormwind and Thunder Bluff are hit by powerful rainstorms as they are invaded by Air and Water elementals. Orgrimmar and Ironforge are set ablaze as they are invaded by Fire and Earth elementals. During the initial phase, the elementals will attack any player, or city defender in range. Unlike the elemental invasions outside of the major cities, the elementals attacking the cities are not subject to immunities or resistances. The elementals will sometimes trap their targets in place. When this happens, an must be used to free the player or NPC (or simply wait the stun out). Freeing players and NPCs in combat will grant the First Responder buff, and will not place you in combat. Each target within the area of effect of the totem will apply one stack of the buff, so freeing several targets at once will apply multiple stacks. When all barriers are in place, the second phase of the invasion begins.\n&lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Rift\"&gt;Elemental Rift&lt;/a&gt;s appear in each of the major districts of the cities, with each Rift spawning new elite elementals. Elite elementals that are killed are replaced with new ones by the rift. Every elite elemental has about 320,000 HP and every rift will spawn elite elementals until 32 are destroyed. As with elemental rifts outside the cities, only kills in which a player participates will count for damaging the rift (guards cannot close the rifts by themselves). The elite elementals are passive to players unless attacked; however, their area of effect abilities are still hazardous to nearby players and can one-shot lower-level characters. Any elementals remaining from the previous phase will still attack any player it sees unless already engaged in combat. Numerous s are in need of rescue within the attacked districts and must be freed using the . Freeing citizens will also grant the First Responder buff. On the top of the screen, the player can see how many districts in the city are still under attack, how many rifts remain in the current district, and how many civilians remain trapped in the current district. The zone map will also display flags in the districts that haven't been cleared yet and Horde/Alliance symbols in the ones that have.\nAfter players defeat 32 elementals surrounding a rift, the rift will close and a buff will be applied to all nearby players within line of sight:\nThese buffs \"do\" count for .\nPlayers must clear the city of every rift and rescue every citizen within an hour in order to win the event.\nSummary of Invasion.\n\"These tables are somewhat incomplete. Some numbers may be higher than recorded. The quote lists below are also incomplete.\"\nAfter the invasion.\nIf an hour has elapsed since the start of the event, Earthen Ring Defenders will intervene and suddenly halt the invasion, removing all elementals from the city. However, players will not benefit and will have to wait until the next event occurs.\nIf players successfully secure a major city, two types of portals to special boss encounters open up for thirty minutes. The portals are always paired with their counterparts. In Orgrimmar, immediately upon victory, Garrosh will lead a counter attack, running directly into the portals. The NPCs and objects then respawn and the city continues to function as normal until the next attack. (The city leader also appears at his normal spot in addition to his appearance in the dungeon.)\nThese encounters are also available via the &lt;a href=\"Dungeon%20Finder\"&gt;Dungeon Finder&lt;/a&gt; for the same period of time. Inside, players find the leader of the city that has been secured and one boss representing the elementals that have been banished:\nThe leader offers a non-repeatable quest to kill the boss and then report back to the capital city with news. However, the boss can be killed as often as desired during the thirty minute window for a chance at item level 251 epic loot.\nThere were multiple bugs with the event on many realms, particularly in Thunder Bluff and Ironforge. Bugs included Trapped Citizens being out-of-phase and unable to be freed, duplicate NPCs and chat messages, Trapped Citizens remaining visibly trapped even after being freed, Elemental Rifts no longer spawning elementals but not closing. These bugs would occur during some invasions but leave others untouched. Often the bugged invasions would make it impossible to access the bosses. These bugs may have been the reason the portals were later \"locked\" into being permanently open on November, 22, 2010 (the final day before &lt;a href=\"the%20Shattering\"&gt;the Shattering&lt;/a&gt;).\nLoot.\nAll of the elemental bosses drop items of level 251, equivalent to ICC10 loot.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

By the time of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Ascendant%20Council\"&gt;Ascendant Council&lt;/a&gt; members have long forgotten their existences as mere mortals. From their wicked sanctum, they oversaw the selection of new ascension candidates.\nElemental ascendant, or Twilight ascendant, are the highest echelon of Twilight's Hammer cultists who become one with the elements. The Twilight Cultists hope that they will one day become elemental ascendants. During a dark ritual they are infused with elemental powers, transforming them into monstrosities. The ascension process seems to involve draining something from other elementals or demigods.\nMists of Pandaria.\n&lt;a href=\"Lava%20Guard%20Gordoth\"&gt;Lava Guard Gordoth&lt;/a&gt; and his allies had hoped to mimic the creation of elemental ascendants in the Twilight's Hammer cult.

Instead, the explosive influx of power drove Gordoth insane and mutated his body into a hideous form.\nHowever, it seems that some shaman &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s \"have\" mastered a more co-operative, though temporary, form of &lt;a href=\"Ascendance\"&gt;ascension&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, an ascendant named &lt;a href=\"Alexor\"&gt;Alexor&lt;/a&gt; joined the &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Azeroth%20%28Class%20Hall%29\"&gt;Heart of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.

Alexor also mentioned that the ritual of ascension is not to be requested lightly, and that the Ascended cannot be commanded, only unleashed.\nSubsequently, some ascendants could be seen in the Hearth of Azeroth, and were sent on missions by the Farseer.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"7th%20Legion%20Ascendant\"&gt;ascended shaman&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"7th%20Legion\"&gt;7th Legion&lt;/a&gt; were present in &lt;a href=\"Bonetrail%20Gulch\"&gt;Bonetrail Gulch&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Vol%27dun\"&gt;Vol'dun&lt;/a&gt;, where they attacked some &lt;a href=\"vulpera\"&gt;vulpera&lt;/a&gt; caravans who were carrying supplies for the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, mentioning during their fight that the elements have answered their call."}

They can attain raw physical form and become &lt;a href=\"Elemental\"&gt;elementals&lt;/a&gt;. Every world has its own elements, its own powers to call upon.\nThe elemental spirits are primitive and chaotic beings of fire, earth, air, or water. They were some of the first sentient creatures to inhabit the nascent worlds of the waking universe. The elemental spirits appear in an almost infinite variety of shapes and sizes. Each of these creatures has a distinct personality and temperament, traits that are heavily influenced by a spirit's elemental nature. The presence of the fifth element\u2014&lt;a href=\"Spirit%20%28lore%29\"&gt;Spirit&lt;/a&gt;\u2014also affects the disposition of these elemental beings. A world with an overabundance of Spirit may give rise to native elementals who are passive and lack physicality. Conversely, a world with too little Spirit may birth elementals who are highly aggressive and incredibly destructive.\n&lt;a href=\"Shaman%23Culture\"&gt;Shamanism&lt;/a&gt; and a few other professions are about communing with these elements.\nBackground.\nThe elements of fire, air, earth, and water serve as the basic building blocks of all matter in the physical universe. &lt;a href=\"Shaman\"&gt;Shaman&lt;/a&gt;ic cultures have long sought to live in harmony with, or assert dominion over, the elements. To do so, they called upon the primordial forces of &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20%28lore%29\"&gt;Spirit&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Decay\"&gt;Decay&lt;/a&gt;. Those who seek to bring balance to the elements rely on Spirit (sometimes referred to as the fifth element by shaman, or &lt;a href=\"chi\"&gt;chi&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt;). This life-giving force interconnects and binds all things in existence as one. Decay is the tool of &lt;a href=\"Dark%20shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; seeking to subjugate and weaponize the elements themselves.\nElemental duality.\nElements can influence a variety of emotionally positive and negative states:\nOn Azeroth.\nAs &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; formed elemental spirits roamed the surface. As time went by these spirits became more erratic and destructive. The burgeoning &lt;a href=\"world-soul\"&gt;world-soul&lt;/a&gt; was so vast that it consumed much of the fifth element, Spirit. Without this primordial force to create balance, Azeroth's elemental spirits &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20wars\"&gt;descended into chaos&lt;/a&gt;. With the &lt;a href=\"rise%20of%20the%20Black%20Empire\"&gt;rise of the Black Empire&lt;/a&gt; the Elemental Lords were enslaved as the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s lieutenants. After the &lt;a href=\"war%20between%20the%20titans%20and%20the%20Old%20Gods\"&gt;war between the titans and the Old Gods&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"keeper\"&gt;keeper&lt;/a&gt;s imprisoned elementals in the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Plane\"&gt;Elemental Plane&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn Azeroth, each element is associated with one of the four cardinal points, to which they are strongly linked:\nWildlife evolution.\nCreatures had emerged from Azeroth's elemental past of their own free will. When the keepers had sealed off the Elemental Plane, some stragglers had escaped banishment. The fury of these spirits had ebbed over time, and they had become creatures of flesh and blood. It was from these former elementals that some forms of wildlife, such as &lt;a href=\"proto-dragon\"&gt;proto-dragon&lt;/a&gt;s, came to be.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt; are a lush and primal place bursting with primal elemental energies and the life energies of Azeroth.\nOn Draenor.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Aggramar\"&gt;Aggramar&lt;/a&gt; came across &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; in his travels, he was intrigued by the world but foresaw doom for the planet if the &lt;a href=\"Evergrowth\"&gt;Evergrowth&lt;/a&gt; was allowed to grow unchecked, as it would eventually consume everything on the world, including the elemental spirits. Once that happened, the Evergrowth would devour itself, and Draenor would be left a wasteland devoid of life. Aggramar's natural affinity for order compelled him to take action, but he did not wish to completely destroy Draenor's plant life, only to temper it. Thus, he would need to neutralize the &lt;a href=\"Sporemound\"&gt;Sporemound&lt;/a&gt;s, the heart of the Evergrowth's power and he did that by creating &lt;a href=\"Grond\"&gt;Grond&lt;/a&gt;.\nMythology.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"tauren%20mythology\"&gt;tauren mythology&lt;/a&gt;, the elements befriended &lt;a href=\"An%27she\"&gt;An'she&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mu%27sha\"&gt;Mu'sha&lt;/a&gt;, the children on the &lt;a href=\"Earth%20Mother\"&gt;Earth Mother&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nElemental spirits are the source of &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"geomancer\"&gt;geomancer&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"pandaren%20transcendent\"&gt;trancendents&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"brewmaster\"&gt;brewmaster&lt;/a&gt;s powers and the origin of much of their knowledge. The spirits of the elements are the shaman's to command.\nElemental spirits are by nature chaotic and destructive, but also capable of reasoning and clever actions. The &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt; was actually formed to keep the elemental spirits in check. They work to prevent the elemental forces from wreaking havoc on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, otherwise, the world would be in danger. The group works hard to keep the elementals pacified, by talking to and dealing with them, thus ensuring they do not cause trouble in the world. Its main goal is to maintain the balance between the world and the elementals that dwell upon it. In this manner, the Earthen Ring prevents elementals from engaging in the chaotic destruction that would otherwise ensue. The &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; venerate the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s and study the elemental spirits under them. They work to anger the elementals and embolden them. The Earthen Ring believes they are not only unwise but also a great threat to Azeroth and their most dire enemy. Anyone who seeks to maintain the fragile balance of nature by keeping the elemental forces in check an ally. \nOrcs and tauren take a more symbolic approach to spirits. The spirits they encounter on the wild plains of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; are less specific, cover a wider range, and are more likely to be spirits of earth and fire than the essences of trees or animals. Orcs and tauren believe that plant-spirits, nature-spirits, and earth-spirits exist and that everyone must treat these spirits with respect. One who denies the reality of nature spirits severs her connection with the earth.\nOrc culture.\nOrcs have a less organized philosophy than Tauren; they see all spirits as individuals connected in a greater whole, like members of a great clan. The shamans of the orcs find their power in the spirits of nature, forming an intimate connection with the very world that surrounds them. This awareness has led to even more revelations of their race's true nature, as the orcs realize that they live more in harmony with the world itself than many of the races of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; who would claim otherwise. The earth and elemental spirits desire to aid and protect those who speak to them. Orc shamans have the power of nature in their fists, and earth, wind, and fire come to their call.\nTauren culture.\nTauren live in careful balance with their environment. They worship the spirits and elements of the plains on which they live. Instead of negotiating with individual spirits, tauren carve representative imagery on their totems and draw power from acting in a particular spirit's name.\nTauren revere a spirit they call the &lt;a href=\"Earth%20Mother\"&gt;Earth Mother&lt;/a&gt;. The Earth Mother is the tauren ideal of all the spirits of nature. The Earth Mother lives in the rivers, trees, plains, and mountains of Azeroth. She is the embodiment of nature. All lesser nature spirits come from the Earth Mother and return to her upon death. While individual spirits represent a particular location, animal or object, such as the spirit of a single tree, or the spirit of a valley, the Earth Mother represents the land. River-spirits, sea-spirits, tree-spirits, rock-spirits and animal spirits all reflect one facet of the Earth Mother. She is everywhere life and nature are. The only spirits separate from the Earth Mother are the spirits of sentient creatures. When a tauren says life is sacred, he's talking about a kind of spiritual energy that permeates the natural world. The Earth Mother represents that big spirit, and little spirits all inhabit rocks, trees and the like. That's why the tauren don't like mining and deforestation; it disrupts all those spirits and disrupts the Earth Mother.\nPandaren culture.\nPandaren veil their beliefs in the trappings of a mystical and ancient method called geomancy. Geomancy is shamanistic. Geomancy teaches that the land is a reflection of the spirits, but that spirits are also a reflection of the land. The fierce powers of the elemental spirits are for the transcendents and brewmasters to gain and command. They learn to channel the power of elemental spirits. Tales say that spirits and energies are at work in the cosmos \u2014 spirits and energy that define the essence of reality, and from these vital sources all things are formed. This is one of the central philosophies of pandaren geomancy, and no one is more intimate with these energies than the pandaren transcendent.\nWhen the pandaren transcendent uses one of these abilities, her appearance changes to match the spirit she channels. For example, when she uses channel earth, her clothing becomes brown and she moves with slow and stately grace; when she uses channel wind, her clothing turns light blue and her movements are swift and airy. Many other possibilities exist. Upon attaining the power of the transcendent body, the pandaren transcendent finally learns to master the elemental spirits and energies under her control. Transcendents swear no loyalty other than to serve the pandaren and the spirits of their people.\nQuilboar culture.\n&lt;a href=\"Quilboar\"&gt;Quilboar&lt;/a&gt; thornweavers call upon vengeful spirits of nature, eschewing the peaceful spirits and the gentle side of the Earth Mother that most tauren revere."}

{"id": "646751", "revid": "39299307", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=646751", "title": "Elemental wars", "text": "The elemental wars were apocalyptic battles between the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Lord\"&gt;elemental lords&lt;/a&gt; which raged for untold millennia on ancient &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Dominion over the planet constantly shifted between factions, each striving to remake the world in their own image. Yet to the elementals the victory was secondary as they wished to continue their endless cycle of chaos.\nPrelude.\nAs Azeroth formed, &lt;a href=\"elemental%20spirit\"&gt;elemental spirit&lt;/a&gt;s roamed its surface. As the vast, burgeoning &lt;a href=\"world-soul\"&gt;world-soul&lt;/a&gt; was consuming much of the fifth element, &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20%28lore%29\"&gt;Spirit&lt;/a&gt;, the elemental spirits descended into chaos. Without this primordial force to create balance, they became more violent and erratic.\nFire, earth, air, and water reveled in unending strife, keeping the face of Azeroth in constant elemental flux. Four elemental lords reigned supreme over the innumerable lesser spirits.\nTactics.\nOf the elemental lords, none could match the ruthless cunning of &lt;a href=\"Al%27Akir\"&gt;Al'Akir&lt;/a&gt; the Windlord. He often sent his elusive tempest minions to spy on his enemies and sow distrust among their ranks. Using feints and ruses, he would pit the other elementals against each other, only later to unleash the full fury of his servants on his weakened foes. The winds would howl and the skies would darken with storms at his approach. As lightning blasted the world's surface, Al'Akir's whirlwind elementals would come screaming from the heavens, enveloping his foes in monstrous cyclones.\n&lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; the Firelord despised Al'Akir's cowardly ways. Compulsive and brash, the Firelord embraced brute force to annihilate his enemies. Wherever he went, volcanoes would burst through the world's crust, spewing forth rivers of fire and destruction. Ragnaros longed for nothing more than to boil the seas, reduce the mountains to slag, and choke the skies with ember and ash. The other elemental lords fostered a deep hatred of Ragnaros for his brazen and devastating assaults.\n&lt;a href=\"Therazane\"&gt;Therazane&lt;/a&gt; the Stonemother was the most reclusive elemental ruler. Ever protective of her children, she raised towering mountain ranges to ward off her enemies' assaults. Only after they had worn themselves thin against her impenetrable fortifications would the Stonemother emerge, wrenching open giant chasms in the earth and swallowing entire elemental armies whole. Those who survived would meet oblivion at the fists of Therazane's most powerful servants: walking mountains of unforgiving crystal and stone.\nThe wise &lt;a href=\"Neptulon\"&gt;Neptulon&lt;/a&gt; the Tidehunter was careful not to fall for Al'Akir's schemes or to commit, his minions to fruitless attacks against Therazane's citadels. As the armies of fire, air, and earth clashed across the face of Azeroth, the Tidchunter and his elementals would divide and conquer their rivals in brilliant routs. When his foes fled, Neptulon would crush them beneath tidal waves that dwarfed even Therazane's highest mountain holdings.\nAftermath.\nOnce defeated and united under servitude by the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s, the elemental lords later participated in the &lt;a href=\"War%20between%20the%20titans%20and%20the%20Old%20Gods\"&gt;war between the titans and their new masters&lt;/a&gt;. Then they were defeated again and imprisoned in the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Plane\"&gt;Elemental Plane&lt;/a&gt;, where they could at last resume their endless, chaotic civil war in the form of the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Sundering\"&gt;Elemental Sundering&lt;/a&gt;."}

All sources say that the Old Gods are evil, that the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s defeated them when they first came to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, and that the elementals, even lords like &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thunderaan\"&gt;Thunderaan&lt;/a&gt;, are mere servants of these mighty beings. The Twilight's Hammer seeks to emulate the elementals who once served the Old Gods. &lt;a href=\"Fire\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt; and lightning answer the cultists' call.

In fact, elementium isn\u2019t native to Azeroth, and is found only near high concentrations of elemental creatures because they bring it from the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Plane\"&gt;Elemental Plane&lt;/a&gt; where it is actually quite common. The unique properties of elementium allow it to absorb and channel elemental forces. Skilled smiths temper elementium in blistering forges, adding to the quality of the item.

To make the nightmares stop, Renault traveled to Brill and smashed Elena's gravestone with his hammer, declaring that he was a man now and didn't need her anymore. He then told the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet&lt;/a&gt; soldiers who had accompanied him to burn down the Mograine homestead.

She had brought with her a simple, ceramic goblet that was glazed blue and etched with runes which had survived the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;. It was filled with water from the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Temple of Elune&lt;/a&gt; and then presumably drunk from by at least some if not all the attendees.\nStormrage.\nShortly before the &lt;a href=\"War%20Against%20the%20Nightmare\"&gt;War Against the Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt; called for a convocation and Elerethe was invited there alongside &lt;a href=\"Naralex\"&gt;Naralex&lt;/a&gt;. They were partners in regret, even if the reasons for each were different.\nElerethe had sought to save the flora and fauna of Alterac Valley during the last war between the Alliance and the Horde, but had been unable to prevent the carnage caused by not only two fighting armies, but an orc shaman. After the war, she had sworn to restore the valley. Even after several years, she was still trying. She was present during the wedding of &lt;a href=\"Malfurion\"&gt;Malfurion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tyrande\"&gt;Tyrande&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Shattering: Prelude to Cataclysm.\nArchdruid Elerethe Renferal was one of the night elf druids Hamuul Runetotem reached out to in an attempt to mend relations between the Alliance and the Horde following a brutal attack on &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;. She was present at the meeting with Hamuul alongside four other night elf druids, and four other tauren druids in &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;, and though the meeting initially began well, she was killed by &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s from the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; who were deliberately disguised as members of the Horde.\nAfter she had shifted to &lt;a href=\"cat%20form\"&gt;cat form&lt;/a&gt; and disemboweled one orc, another had impaled her to the ground with a &lt;a href=\"polearm\"&gt;polearm&lt;/a&gt;, ending her life, and ruining the attempted reconciliation. She died believing that Hamuul had some hand in leading her and the other elven druids into an ambush. The true nature of the attack was eventually discovered, although it is not known how or when this happened.\nLegion.\nAfter she died, Elerethe's consciousness apparently resided in the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;, trapped in an existence of endless fear, confusion, and hatred. Twisted and broken, she believed anyone who crosses her path to be responsible for her tragic end. Trapped in this cycle of madness, she set her sights on the adventurers fighting against &lt;a href=\"Xavius\"&gt;Xavius&lt;/a&gt; and the corruption of the Nightmare. She was fought within a &lt;a href=\"Nightmare%20Mulgore\"&gt;twisted nightmare version of Mulgore&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter Xavius is killed, Elerethe's redeemed spirit is found within the Emerald Dream.\nQuotes.\nAlterac Valley.\nMy faith guides my actions, &lt;race&gt;. I know that Ivus will come.\nThe Shattering: Prelude to Cataclysm.\n\"Renferal whirled for just an instant to affix Hamuul with a stare of fury and loathing that pierced his heart as surely as any spear. \"We came in good faith!\" was all she said before she transformed into a cat and launched herself on the nearest orc.\"\nLegion.\nYou pulled me from a storm of madness and I am forever in your debt, &lt;name&gt;.

The founders of Azeroth's most magical and advanced civilization which at its peak spanned the breadth of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor%20%28landmass%29\"&gt;ancient Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, the night elves came into a horrific conflict with the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; and achieved a pyrrhic victory that &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;sundered&lt;/a&gt; Kalimdor's landmass into the continents of the present age. The devastation wrought by their conceit fractured the kaldorei into several isolated groups that would characterize themselves based on magical usage. The main group that came to join the Alliance eventually, would abandon the ways of arcane magic usage entirely, and craft a radically different society centered around the worship of &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;, harmony with the natural world and its denizens and &lt;a href=\"Druidism\"&gt;Druidism&lt;/a&gt;. The other 2 main groups of Kaldorei, the Quel'dorei of Eldre'thalas and the Shal'dorei of Suramar would be cut off from nature by a demon in the first group and by an impenetrable magical barrier in the second group for 10,000 years.\nQuel'dorei, the Highborne.\nThe magocratic society that the night elves developed split into two castes: a body of the majority of the &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei\"&gt;Kaldorei&lt;/a&gt; and the elite caste, the &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt;, known as the &lt;a href=\"quel%27dorei\"&gt;quel'dorei&lt;/a&gt; (\"noble children\", \"highborne\", or \"high elves\"). These were the favorites of and most loyal to the beautiful &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt;, queen of the elves. They sought to understand the energies of the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;, gaining exhilarating power from the arcane energy siphoned from the Well's depths.\nThe night elves (and in particular the quel'dorei) would go on to expand across ancient &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, shattering the empires of the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20Empire\"&gt;Gurubashi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Amani%20Empire\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s in the process and inspiring awe in those who witnessed their might. However, the arrogance and carelessness of the quel'dorei would spell doom for their civilization, attracting the attention of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Azshara and some Highborne closest to her, opened a portal from the Well of Eternity into the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;, enabling the demons to enter into Azeroth and wreak havoc upon Kalimdor. Some of these Highborne of Zin'Azshari grew terrified of Queen Azshara's undying loyalty to &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; and the demons of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Quickly, they escaped to aid the rest of the night elven civilization in banishing the demons back into the Twisting Nether in a catastrophic war now called the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, ending in the implosion of the Well of Eternity and the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt; of Kalimdor. These Highborne would later depart to form their own separate society, however other groups of Highborne from other regions survived the Sundering in isolation have only recently emerged. The Kaldorei have 2 main groups of Quel'dorei from different parts of their former empire around today. The larger group of these Highborne night elves are the &lt;a href=\"Shen%27dralar\"&gt;Shen'dralar&lt;/a&gt; ancients that have survived since the Sundering from the city-state region of &lt;a href=\"Eldre%27Thalas\"&gt;Eldre'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; (now known as &lt;a href=\"Dire%20Maul\"&gt;Dire Maul&lt;/a&gt;). Another group are unliving ghosts in the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt; ruined city of &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Nar%27thalas\"&gt;Nar'thalas&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Azsuna\"&gt;Azsuna&lt;/a&gt; and are known as the &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Farondis\"&gt;Court of Farondis&lt;/a&gt; who have endured in a cursed state since Azshara, in a terrible display of power punished them for disobeying her before the Sundering took place.\nShal'dorei, the nightborne.\nThe nightborne were once &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt; blasted most of Suramar to the bottom of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt;, although some of it remained above shore in the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt; due to the efforts of the resident &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt;, who crafted a magical shield that kept the center of their city together. This shield would stay up for 10,000 years, as the night elves believed the world outside of Suramar had been destroyed. Under their shield they would evolve into the &lt;a href=\"Nightborne\"&gt;Nightborne&lt;/a&gt;, reliant on their source of power, the &lt;a href=\"Nightwell\"&gt;Nightwell&lt;/a&gt; for nourishment. The shal'dorei are a newly discovered group of Kaldorei. Though they vary slightly in appearance with the rest of the night elves, they retain the customs and characteristics of the night elves of the pre-sundering era and dwell in the ancient city of &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt; they have stewarded diligently with their magical resource for the last 10,000 years.\nQuel'dorei, the high elves.\nAmongst the main group of night elves that triumphed over Queen Azshara and her Legion allies, the Highborne of Zin'Azshari that rebelled against Queen Azshara led by Dath'remar Sunstrider had been instrumental in frustrating the machinations of the Queen and giving the time needed for the night elves to ultimately triumph in their fight. However due to the role of the &lt;a href=\"Zin-Azshari\"&gt;Zin'Azshari&lt;/a&gt; Highborne indirectly bringing the demons to Azeroth, despite their brave heroics they were never fully trusted by the rest of the night elves who had abandoned magic to pursue druidism. The surviving night elves would end up banishing the Quel'dorei for the acts leading to the Sundering as well as more wanton waving of arcana. These &lt;a href=\"Zin-Azshari\"&gt;Zin'Azshari&lt;/a&gt; quel'dorei were forced into exile and eventually settled in Quel'Thalas. Becoming known as \"&lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt;,\" they rejected the culture and lifestyle of their kin, taking the night out of night elf and took up a diurnal cycle instead of nocturnal. Over time, their skin became a pale color instead of their former purple-dark/grey hues. They rebuilt a new Elven society, one not based on the worship of the moon goddess or moon and star themes, but on the Sun and the Light, where they would freely practice and excel in magic. They succeed in building their dream blending both nature and arcane magic with a found faith in the Holy Light and would endure as a shining bastion of civilization powered by their arcane font &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;The Sunwell&lt;/a&gt; for 7,000 years. So they would live free from the distrust of their former kin to practice magic they would shield from demonic eyes until betrayal from within would lead to devastating invasion from the undead &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; would fracture their society and change them forever.\nSin'dorei, the blood elves.\nBlood elves are &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; who changed their name after the &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20invasion%20of%20Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Scourge invasion of Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; in memory of those who had fallen in the siege, and later allied themselves with the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnder the leadership of their regent, &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; (in turn working under the directive of &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Prince Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt;, last of the &lt;a href=\"Sunstrider%20dynasty\"&gt;royal bloodline&lt;/a&gt;), the blood elves retook much of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; and looked to reuniting with their prince on &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. Fate had other ideas, however, and the prince -- twisted by demonic energies -- was killed after betraying his people to the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nThough biologically and physiologically high elves, blood elves have glowing emerald-green eyes, courtesy of their exposure to the &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; magic in place around &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; and Quel'Thalas. Like the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s, high elven physiology undergoes a visible reaction when exposed to fel magic, though evidently one not quite as all-encompassing. \nDarkfallen, the undead elves.\nThe Darkfallen are &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; elves once raised by Arthas Menethil following the invasion of Quel'Thalas, prowling the lands as either &lt;a href=\"dark%20ranger\"&gt;dark ranger&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"Blood%20magic\"&gt;blood mages&lt;/a&gt; for the Scourge. When the Lich King slowly began to lose his power after &lt;a href=\"Illidan\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt;'s failed attempt to kill him in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, many Darkfallen had their conscious will restored. They later joined &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; and her &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;, as elite agents and personal guards of the Banshee Queen.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Thorns\"&gt;War of the Thorns&lt;/a&gt;, the Forsaken raised fallen &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; as dark rangers, creating a new generation of Darkfallen.\nDarkfallen mostly retain the builds of their still-living kin. Their once lustrous skin is now pale and lifeless, the glow of their eyes displaced by a seething rage of crimson.\nSan'layn, the darkfallen.\nThe San'layn are a sect of vampiric darkfallen, once under the command of the &lt;a href=\"Blood-Queen%20Lana%27thel\"&gt;Blood-Queen Lana'thel&lt;/a&gt;. They were introduced to the Scourge army after Arthas' second visit to &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; when he killed the &lt;a href=\"Sunfury\"&gt;Sunfury&lt;/a&gt;, blood elves seeking to avenge their fallen brethren by helping &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;'s attempt to destroy the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey also retain the builds of their still-living kin. However, their flesh appears necrotic and, though universally pale, ranges from fleshy pinks and red to gray and light green, and they tend to have either white, blond, red or dark hair. Their eyes have white, yellow, green, blue, or black glows. Some San'layn have clawed fingers and ears more closely resembling those of a bat, and a few have developed wings.\nRen'dorei, the void elves.\nVoid elves are a &lt;a href=\"Allied%20race\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt; of Void-infused elves. A group of blood elf scholars led by &lt;a href=\"Magister%20Umbric\"&gt;Magister Umbric&lt;/a&gt; was exiled from &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt; for their experimentation with the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;. After an altercation with &lt;a href=\"void%20ethereal\"&gt;void ethereal&lt;/a&gt;s, Umbric and his brethren were transformed into void elves. &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, the first mortal to succeed at mastering the Void, came to the aid of her kin and taught the void elves how to control the shadows.\nThe void elves seek to utilize their great but dangerous powers for the sake of defending &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, and to prove those who doubt or judge their abilities wrong, all the while resisting the Void's call to madness. They have the ability to metamorphose into a Void form.\nAnatomy and physiology.\nThe Well of Eternity's arcane energies are the primary reason for the existence of the elves, and the night elves are described as having an arcane essence, so it makes sense that they and all elves derived from them would be magical in nature. All elves are exceptionally long-lived and, at one point, were immortal, though the main races of elves have lost their immortality. Further, all elves possess glowing eyes, a sign of the use of great spells \u2014 a being of any race can exhibit glowing eyes while focusing or casting a particularly powerful spell, but the trait is innate in only a few races, most of which are demons or undead.\nElves have several characteristics in common. All have unusually acute senses and are able to see clearly even in low-light conditions. As a general rule, elves are also slim, athletic, and graceful. Furthermore, they all have large pointed ears that tend to be greeted with admiration or mockery by other races. Typically, night elves have longer ears than high/blood elves, whereas the latter's point upward rather than backward.\nA characteristic of elves on Azeroth are their unusual eyebrows, which extend beyond their faces, resembling whiskers or antennae. There has been no official coverage of this anatomical oddity, despite it being present in all official artwork.\nRaces and groups.\nOriginally, all elves were &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;, and over time an aristocratic subgroup within the Kaldorei was established, the &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt;, called the Quel'dorei.\nDuring the events of the Sundering, many Quel'dorei were turned into &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; and continued to be led by &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt;. Some Quel'dorei were turned into &lt;a href=\"satyr\"&gt;satyr&lt;/a&gt; by Sargeras and led by &lt;a href=\"Xavius\"&gt;Xavius&lt;/a&gt;. Xavius, along with many of the demonic satyr, eventually began serving the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s as &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20satyr\"&gt;Shadow satyr&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Quel'dorei of &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt; sealed themselves away behind a magical barrier and eventually became the &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt;, the Shal'dorei, led by &lt;a href=\"Elisande\"&gt;Elisande&lt;/a&gt;. If any went against her rule, they would be exiled, and their magical addiction would lead them to become &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen\"&gt;Nightfallen&lt;/a&gt; and eventually &lt;a href=\"withered\"&gt;withered&lt;/a&gt;. Some exiled however attempted to create an &lt;a href=\"Arcan%27dor\"&gt;Arcan'dor&lt;/a&gt; to cure them of this addiction and its side-effects, but an attempt failed and created the &lt;a href=\"fal%27dorei\"&gt;fal'dorei&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe non-Quel'dorei night elves retained their Kaldorei identity and established Darnassus, led by &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Shen%27dralar\"&gt;Shen'dralar&lt;/a&gt; managed to barely survive and remained night elves as well. Some night elf druids eventually became &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Scythe\"&gt;Druids of the Scythe&lt;/a&gt;. Others, during &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; sided with &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Lord\"&gt;Elemental Lord&lt;/a&gt;s, and became &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Flame\"&gt;Druids of the Flame&lt;/a&gt;.\nBut the Quel'dorei under &lt;a href=\"Dath%27Remar%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Dath'Remar Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; were exiled. These &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; established Quel'Thalas. During the events of the &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Wars\"&gt;Troll Wars&lt;/a&gt;, the high elves trained 100 humans of the Empire of &lt;a href=\"Arathor\"&gt;Arathor&lt;/a&gt;, eventually leading to the formation of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, and likewise the intermingling of humans and elves to establish the &lt;a href=\"Half-elf\"&gt;half-elves&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href=\"Arator\"&gt;Arator&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alodi\"&gt;Alodi&lt;/a&gt;.\nEventually during the &lt;a href=\"the%20Scourge%20invasion%20of%20Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;the Scourge invasion of Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; by Arthas Menethil, 90% of the high elf population was destroyed along with the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;, with some having been spared due to not being in the area at the time, such as the high elves of Dalaran. In the wake of this genocide, &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; decided to rename the high elves of Quel'Thalas into &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;, the sin'dorei.\nHowever, Arthas raised many of the fallen elves for his &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. One such group of elves continued existing as &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; elves, becoming the &lt;a href=\"Darkfallen\"&gt;Darkfallen&lt;/a&gt;, or as ghostly &lt;a href=\"banshee\"&gt;banshee&lt;/a&gt;s under the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;, originally led by &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;. Though they died high elves, some like &lt;a href=\"Velonara\"&gt;Velonara&lt;/a&gt; identify as blood elves even in undeath. Another group of undead elves are due to the &lt;a href=\"Sunfury\"&gt;Sunfury&lt;/a&gt; attempting to avenge their people alongside Kael'thas, leading to their being raised as &lt;a href=\"vampyr\"&gt;vampyr&lt;/a&gt;ic Darkfallen, and later organized as the &lt;a href=\"San%27layn\"&gt;San'layn&lt;/a&gt;, a undead sect led by &lt;a href=\"Blood-Queen%20Lana%27thel\"&gt;Blood-Queen Lana'thel&lt;/a&gt;.\nEventually in desperation, Kael'thas began to work with &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, and with &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Rommath\"&gt;Grand Magister Rommath&lt;/a&gt; integrated the use of &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; into blood elf society due to the loss of the Sunwell. Without the Sunwell, the addiction to magic caused blood elves to deteriorate into &lt;a href=\"wretched\"&gt;wretched&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis eventually led to a series of events that caused the blood elves to join the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;; the high elves of Dalaran and other &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; kingdoms rejected this, leading to the establishment of the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Covenant\"&gt;Silver Covenant&lt;/a&gt; within &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; for the high elves that chose to retain loyalty to the Alliance, led by &lt;a href=\"Vereesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Vereesa Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;.\nSimultaneously, Illidan had decided to integrate only elves into the &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt;, taking on trainees from Kael'thas's forces and night elves who had chosen to follow him. However, Kael'thas had in actuality betrayed Illidan and was collaborating with &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;, who offered &lt;a href=\"felblood\"&gt;felblood&lt;/a&gt; to the blood elves, creating the &lt;a href=\"felblood%20elf\"&gt;felblood elves&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the Illidari re-integrated into Azerothian society to help with the Legion. A large portion of the nightborne, especially among the aristocracy, went along with Elisande and sided with the Legion, creating the &lt;a href=\"Felborne\"&gt;Felborne&lt;/a&gt;.\nDue to the restoration of the Sunwell with &lt;a href=\"M%27uru\"&gt;M'uru&lt;/a&gt;'s heart, it is sensitive to &lt;a href=\"void\"&gt;void&lt;/a&gt;. When &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; re-appeared during the third invasion, she tried to go visit but the Sunwell reacted badly to her. She discovered other blood elves had begun investigating the void like she had, but were exiled from Quel'Thalas for their research. She managed to rescue them and bring them into the Alliance, as the &lt;a href=\"void%20elf\"&gt;void elves&lt;/a&gt;, the ren'dorei.\nAfter the events of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, some night elves had been raised into undeath as well, creating a new generation of Darkfallen.\nNotable.\nA number of elves have played a significant role in the lore of \"Warcraft\".\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

In the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, during the &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20invasion%20of%20Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Scourge invasion of Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ranger-general%20of%20Silvermoon\"&gt;Ranger-General&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; boasted to &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; that the gates were imbued with potent magics. However, the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; led by Arthas slaughtered the high elf defenders and villagers and destroyed the first gate.\nThe second gate was larger, and could only be opened by the &lt;a href=\"Key%20of%20the%20Three%20Moons%20%28item%29\"&gt;Key of the Three Moons&lt;/a&gt;, a magical item that had been split into three separate mooncrystals. The Key of the Three Moons deactivated a field made of magical energies known as &lt;a href=\"Ban%27dinoriel\"&gt;Ban'dinoriel&lt;/a&gt;, the Gatekeeper. Thanks to the traitor &lt;a href=\"Dar%27Khan%20Drathir\"&gt;Dar'Khan Drathir&lt;/a&gt;, Arthas was told of the location of each of the three mooncrystals. &lt;a href=\"Altar%20of%20Kings\"&gt;Altars of Kings&lt;/a&gt; on intersections of ley lines at &lt;a href=\"An%27telas\"&gt;An'telas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"An%27daroth\"&gt;An'daroth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"An%27owyn\"&gt;An'owyn&lt;/a&gt;, heavily protected by high elf defenders. With the help of some &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; mercenaries (which were omitted in ), Arthas and his undead army destroyed the three bases and recovered the Key of the Three Moons. After that, they opened the last gate, the now-destroyed gates of Silvermoon, and marched into &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sunwell%20Plateau\"&gt;Sunwell Plateau&lt;/a&gt; was protected by three other great gates: &lt;a href=\"Agamath\"&gt;Agamath&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rohendor\"&gt;Rohendor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Archonisus\"&gt;Archonisus&lt;/a&gt;. \nSpeculation.\nThe first Elfgate that was destroyed during Arthas' invasion could be the gate at &lt;a href=\"Thalassian%20Pass\"&gt;Thalassian Pass&lt;/a&gt;. However, this does not match the description from \"Blood of the Highborne\" where the &lt;a href=\"An%27daroth\"&gt;An'daroth&lt;/a&gt; temple was said to be located southwest of the outer gate. Similarly, the term Ghostlands was said to apply to area south of the place where the outer gate once stood.

His mother died during his birth.\nAfter Eli arrived at his father's new &lt;a href=\"shop\"&gt;shop&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Booty%20Bay\"&gt;Booty Bay&lt;/a&gt;, he discovered that his father had grown greedy during his time in the &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; town and he had to help him when Nori was drunk. While Eli helped him in trade, his heart was never in it. One day an &lt;a href=\"elf\"&gt;elf&lt;/a&gt; entered Nori's shop to make an order. Eli was suspicious of the elf, for he asked for a discreet midnight transaction, but Nori simply rebuffed Eli. At the meeting, Nori handed the blade to the elf and was given his payment, then Eli saw who the blade was for; a merciless &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; bandit named &lt;a href=\"Havoc%20the%20Heartless\"&gt;Havoc the Heartless&lt;/a&gt;. Eli tried to compel Nori to stop him from taking his blade, but Nori responded coldly \"It's none of my business.\" \nThe next day Eli left, being disgusted with how greedy Nori had become. He chastised his father for selling his weaponry to those who would use them for evil. Nori grew angry, and in his anger, took his blade away from Eli and gave him a rusted weapon in return. Eli followed Havoc's trail to a trail connecting &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Elwynn%20Forest\"&gt;Elwynn Forest&lt;/a&gt;, and found Havoc and a group of &lt;a href=\"bandit\"&gt;bandit&lt;/a&gt;s about to kill a poor farmer. Eli killed the bandits (including the elf), and battled Havoc, but in the end Eli's rusted sword broke, and he was killed by Havoc. The farmer returned the body of Eli to Nori, who swore revenge upon Havoc, but it would take three years before he succeeded in finding Havoc. During that time, Nori reclaimed every blade he had ever sold, either by re-paying the people who he had sold the weapons to, or by killing them if they refused; noting that those with noble intentions had always handed over their weapons without question. Nori eventually tracked Havoc down, killing his remaining men and eventually Havoc himself using a rusted blade similar to the one he'd given his son, avenging Eli. \nAfter Havoc was defeated, Nori set Havoc and himself ablaze, ending both of their lives."}

At the time of the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, Maximillian left Un'Goro Crater to fight the Burning Legion on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;, he was later recruited as a champion of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Order of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; by its &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Highlord&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nCataclysm.\nComing all the way from &lt;a href=\"Northshire%20Abbey\"&gt;Northshire Abbey&lt;/a&gt;, Maximillian came to &lt;a href=\"Un%27Goro%20Crater\"&gt;Un'Goro Crater&lt;/a&gt; seeking to eliminate the evils of the land and have an adventure. When arriving to the land, he set up camp and searched for a squire. He was willing to take anyone, even a member of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. After finding a random traveler, the paladin took them under his tutelage and trained them in the ways of the squire. For their first mission, he announced that they were going to kill fifteen malignant \"dragons\" in the crater, considering that these dragons were not the offspring of &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza the Dragon Queen&lt;/a&gt;, but vicious creatures direly in need of a hero's blade. When their squire tried to convince him that there were no dragons in the crater, he refuted everything and explained that he knew much better what a dragon was, even after &lt;a href=\"Spark%20Nilminer\"&gt;Spark Nilminer&lt;/a&gt; told him that they were \"&lt;a href=\"dinosaur\"&gt;dinosaur&lt;/a&gt;s\", which is exactly the same thing in his eyes.\nAfter they finished, Maximillian warned his squire that his \"paladin's instinct\" told him that there were more than \"dragons\" in the crater, and that maidens near them needed their help. Although his heart was for Doloria, his chivalric code ordered him to save any damsel in danger. Together they managed to find the three \"damsels in distress\" in the region, the first being a &lt;a href=\"Dweller%20in%20the%20Cliffs\"&gt;busy female human&lt;/a&gt; on a high cliff, Maximillian tried to save her by throwing her to his squire, but the latter couldn't catch her in time and the paladin blamed them for her death. The second was actually a &lt;a href=\"Dweller%20by%20the%20Shore\"&gt;male blood elf&lt;/a&gt; who dropped his &lt;a href=\"Dweller%27s%20Crate\"&gt;crate&lt;/a&gt; in the nearby lake, Maximillian returned his crate and mistook him for a woman, before he resumed his journey without giving the elf time to specify that he was a man. The last was a &lt;a href=\"Dweller%20of%20the%20North\"&gt;female goblin&lt;/a&gt; \"attacked\" by a &lt;a href=\"Squawky\"&gt;\"pheonix\"&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Screaming%20Reaches\"&gt;Screaming Reaches&lt;/a&gt;, in reality it was the latter's parrot and she was shocked to see her pet get killed. After they had finished \"rescuing\" everyone, Maximillian remarked that the damsels were less than gracious, with the exception of the elf by the lake, but that they would have better luck tomorrow with damsels whose thankfulness would be equal to their beauty.\nThe paladin then explained, in a moment of \"seriousness\", that they now had a quest of great importance before them, to eliminate the mother of all \"dragons\" in order to end the threat they are in the crater. But before he could go to battle, Maximillian considered it was necessary to seek the help of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;, and that he had seen its manifestation as spirits on the shores of &lt;a href=\"Golakka%20Hot%20Springs\"&gt;Golakka Hot Springs&lt;/a&gt;. In reality, they were very angry &lt;a href=\"steam%20elemental\"&gt;steam elemental&lt;/a&gt;s that tried to kill him when he approached them to pray and ask for their help, so the squire had to protect the knight while he performed his prayers. When he was satisfied with their \"blessings\", although he did not understand why his squire had to destroy them, they returned together to his camp to prepare for their last and dangerous quest.\nOnce ready, Maximillian and his squire traveled to confront the &lt;a href=\"Devilsaur%20Queen\"&gt;Devilsaur Queen&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Terror%20Run\"&gt;Terror Run&lt;/a&gt;, both on the back of &lt;a href=\"Pimento\"&gt;Pimento&lt;/a&gt;. The knight attempted a heroic charge against the brood mother, but they had no choice but to flee through the crater when the latter, much larger than expected, pursued them to devour them. During the escape, Maximillian panicked and ordered his squire to throw everything they could find to defeat the monster, like stones, and even the very armor of the paladin which managed to kill the dinosaur. At the end of their journey, Maxwell gave his squire a life lesson, he then promoted them from squire to fledgling knight, and gave them one of his remaining equipment before saying their goodbyes.\nAfter replacing his armour, Maximillian journeyed to &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, where helped the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to defend &lt;a href=\"Sethria%27s%20Roost\"&gt;Sethria's Roost&lt;/a&gt; against the minions of &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros the Firelord&lt;/a&gt;.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20in%20Draenor\"&gt;war in Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, Maximillian could be found in &lt;a href=\"Frostwall%20Tavern\"&gt;Frostwall Tavern&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lunarfall%20Inn\"&gt;Lunarfall Inn&lt;/a&gt;, where he warned the &lt;a href=\"Garrison\"&gt;Garrison&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Commanders&lt;/a&gt; that dragons have settled within the hallowed halls of &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;, and that they \"kidnapped\" a distressed damsel, the latter actually being &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Zaela\"&gt;Warlord Zaela&lt;/a&gt; who took control of the mountain at the head of the &lt;a href=\"Ironmarch\"&gt;Ironmarch&lt;/a&gt;. As their squires, he sent them to find evidence of the dragons' presence, so he wouldn't waste his time and heroism on a dragonless quest. When they returned with evidence, he announced that he would go to the spire to kill no less than twenty of these great beasts in the name of &lt;a href=\"Doloria\"&gt;Doloria&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome time later, he once again met with the commanders, and told them that he had heroically approached the gates of Blackrock Spire with the intention of ending the reign of the dragons within. However, at the last moment, his mind drifted to thoughts of Lady Doloria's fair face and to his own painfully unsatisfied desires, and so his sword arm fell limp at his side. He then decided to send his squires once again to look for evidence that dragons were present at &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Upper Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;, and when they returned with evidence, he announced that this time he would go to kill no less than thirty of these great beasts in the name of Doloria.\nLegion.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, Maximillian aided the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s in defending southern &lt;a href=\"Tanaris\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s during the &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Invasion\"&gt;Legion Invasion&lt;/a&gt;s. He was accompanied by several of Un'Goro's &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Guardian%20%28Legion%20Invasions%29\"&gt;Stone Guardians&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Golem%20%28Tanaris%29\"&gt;Stone Golems&lt;/a&gt;, and still deluded as ever, thought everything that happened in the area was the fault of \"dragons\".\nLegionfall.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Armies%20of%20Legionfall\"&gt;Armies of Legionfall&lt;/a&gt;'s assault on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, Maximillian sent a &lt;a href=\"Letter%20from%20Maximillian\"&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Highlord&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;, in which he announced that he had returned from the depths of &lt;a href=\"Un%27Goro%20Crater\"&gt;Un'Goro Crater&lt;/a&gt;, and that his fleet has made landfall on the beaches of the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;. He invited them to join him at his fortifications, where he mentioned he was getting ready to break through the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s lines and to send them back into the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;. In reality, Maximillian was actually alone and undressed on a beach on the northern coast of &lt;a href=\"Highmountain\"&gt;Highmountain&lt;/a&gt;, and was surprised that the Highlord was his squire as he did not immediately recognize them. He then proudly announced that he had built his camp after securing the beach from \"demons\", whose bodies he showed were those of two crabs. Despite an attempt to convince him that they were not demons, he refuted everything and explained that he was far more experienced in the field than anyone.\nBefore they began their journey together once more, Maximillian asked the Highlord to kneel and made them his squire once again. Afterwards, he explained that his journey to the Broken Isles was perilous, as he met many \"demons\" that he had to overcome, but it cost him his armor, his sword, and his mount. Consequently, he sent his squire to retrieve all of his equipment, promising to promote them to the rank of \"Squire, First Class\". The armor of Maximillian was found in several &lt;a href=\"Sack%20of%20Armor\"&gt;sacks&lt;/a&gt; in the coastal waters, and the paladin explained that he had removed it in order to avoid sinking if his ship had had an accident at sea. His sword &lt;a href=\"Excaliberto\"&gt;Excaliberto&lt;/a&gt; and his mount &lt;a href=\"Pimento\"&gt;Pimento&lt;/a&gt; were found in the possession of the &lt;a href=\"Swamprock\"&gt;Swamprock&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"Shipwreck%20Cove\"&gt;Shipwreck Cove&lt;/a&gt;, according to Maximillian they were stolen from him by these \"demons\" while he was scouting the coast. When they had accomplished their mission, the knight kept his word and promoted them to the rank of \"Squire, First Class\".\nOnce ready for their journey, Maximillian revealed that he was not only here to repel the demonic invasion, but also to seek after his beloved &lt;a href=\"Doloria\"&gt;Doloria&lt;/a&gt;, for he had a vision that she had been kidnapped and taken to a floating city in the sky. He then ordered his squire to join him in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, and together they managed to find Doloria in the &lt;a href=\"Legerdemain%20Lounge\"&gt;Legerdemain Lounge&lt;/a&gt;. Unexpectedly, Doloria turned out to be a female &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; who was surprised that Maximillian managed to find her so far. She secretly explained to the Highlord that Maximillian had no chance of being with her, but because his heart was in the right place, she couldn't muster the courage to tell him and preferred to run away, hoping that he would gave up on her. However, and to her great regret, he always managed to find her. She then had the idea to send them to kill \"Hill Bandits\", in reality &lt;a href=\"Hill%20Ettin\"&gt;Hill Ettin&lt;/a&gt;s at &lt;a href=\"Sylvan%20Falls\"&gt;Sylvan Falls&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Highmountain\"&gt;Highmountain&lt;/a&gt;, in order to recover jewels so that she could be freed from her kidnappers. The knight accepted this mission, and with his squire they left to defeat their adversary, however, when they returned, they could not find Doloria who had \"disappeared\", as she had hidden herself behind a mask and changed her name for \"Doloris\".\nDesperate, Maximillian asked the Highlord to help him search for Doloria by asking questions to the customers present in the inn. While the Highlord helped Doloria not to be discovered, Maximillian searched in every corner and even asked &lt;a href=\"Bonegrim\"&gt;Bonegrim&lt;/a&gt; a few questions. Still deluded as ever, he failed to find his beloved and accepted that she had been abducted once again, he then told the Highlord that they would not rest until they found her, asked them to join him as a follower to lead his troops, and that they would accomplish the missions he would give them. In reality, it is Maximillian who joined the ranks of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Order of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; as a Champion in the service of its Highlord.\nDragonflight.\nA few years later, Maximillian visited the &lt;a href=\"T%26amp%3BW%20Trading%20Post\"&gt;T&amp;W Trading Post&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; to buy a sword, however, &lt;a href=\"Tawny%20Seabraid\"&gt;Tawny Seabraid&lt;/a&gt; pointed out he was already carrying one. Surprised, he claimed that he had indeed forgotten about it, and when Tawny mentioned that she was joking and that they had many swords for sale, he told her that he already had a sword and resumed his journey, leaving the dwarf in disbelief.\nAbilities.\nAs a follower.\nMaximillian is a Protection Paladin &lt;a href=\"Class%20Hall%20followers\"&gt;Class Hall champion&lt;/a&gt; with the following abilities:\nHe can also be assigned as a bodyguard with the following ability:\nQuotes.\nGarrison.\nWhat ho, squire?\nLegion.\nHighmountain.\nWhat ho!

She accompanied Baine during his meeting with &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; just prior to the return of &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;, and was ultimately seated on the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Council\"&gt;Horde Council&lt;/a&gt; as the Highmountain tauren representative.\nBiography.\nA Mountain Divided.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; returned to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spiritwalker%20Ebonhorn\"&gt;Spiritwalker Ebonhorn&lt;/a&gt; called a meeting between the leaders of the tauren tribes \u2014 &lt;a href=\"Ulan%20Highmountain\"&gt;Ulan Highmountain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jale%20Rivermane\"&gt;Jale Rivermane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lasan%20Skyhorn\"&gt;Lasan Skyhorn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Torok%20Bloodtotem\"&gt;Torok Bloodtotem&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 as well as the &lt;a href=\"Underking\"&gt;Underking&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"drogbar\"&gt;drogbar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dargrul\"&gt;Dargrul&lt;/a&gt;. When Mayla arrived at the meeting, she told the gathered leaders of the crushing defeat suffered by the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; forces at the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;. However, she also pointed out that the survivors were still holding the Legion's attention, possibly granting the people of Highmountain more time to prepare. When Spiritwalker Ebonhorn described a vision he had received of &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;outsiders&lt;/a&gt; wielding the power of the &lt;a href=\"Hammer%20of%20Khaz%27goroth\"&gt;Hammer of Khaz'goroth&lt;/a&gt; against the Legion, Dargrul and the three lesser tauren chieftains were outraged, as in their eyes, the hammer belonged to Highmountain's people alone. Mayla asked the spiritwalker if he was certain, to which he replied that he was. High Chieftain Ulan then stated that the &lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20Tribe\"&gt;Highmountain Tribe&lt;/a&gt; would obey the spirits, to which the other chieftains reluctantly agreed. Dargrul, however, did not. Without warning, he leapt forward and grabbed the hammer while his hooded bodyguard summoned spikes from the earth to lock Jale, Lasan and Torok in place. Mayla attempted to strike Dargrul with her spear but was stopped by one of the spikes. When she called the Underking an idiot for starting a war between their two peoples, the drogbar replied by saying that he was not starting a war, but ending it \u2014 the Legion could not be reasoned with, and he knew that he would have to take control of his people's own fate when the tauren refused to act. While Mayla fought and killed Dargrul's bodyguard, the Underking used the hammer's power to instantly murder High Chieftain Ulan before fleeing.\nAs Mayla knelt over her father's corpse, she asked the other chieftains how many they could spare to hunt down the Underking. However, the Rivermane, Skyhorn and Bloodtotem chieftains had no intention of lending any aid, saying that they were powerless against the hammer and had to return to their own lands to defend them against the drogbar's assault. As Jale, Lasan and Torok departed from Thunder Totem, Mayla picked up her father's totem, telling herself that Highmountain would fall if the tribes did not stand together, and that if the hammer was what was required to reunite her people, then she would get it back.\nLegion.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s first arrive in Highmountain to aid the Highmountain tauren, Mayla greets them and briefly explains the situation before sending them to help the &lt;a href=\"Rivermane%20tribe\"&gt;Rivermane&lt;/a&gt; farmers and fishermen at &lt;a href=\"Earthmother%27s%20Bounty\"&gt;Earthmother's Bounty&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Whitewater%20Wash\"&gt;Whitewater Wash&lt;/a&gt;. After the Rivermane have been assisted and recruited to the Highmountain Tribe's cause, Mayla directs the adventurer to the &lt;a href=\"Bloodtotem%20tribe\"&gt;Bloodtotem tribe&lt;/a&gt; (who instead join the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, causing the &lt;a href=\"Stonedark%20tribe\"&gt;Stonedark&lt;/a&gt; drogbar to join instead), the &lt;a href=\"Skyhorn%20tribe\"&gt;Skyhorn tribe&lt;/a&gt; (who once again declare their allegiance to Mayla, much like the Rivermane) and finally to &lt;a href=\"Ebyssian\"&gt;Spiritwalker Ebonhorn&lt;/a&gt;. After showing the champion a series of visions of the ancient tauren hero &lt;a href=\"Huln%20Highmountain\"&gt;Huln Highmountain&lt;/a&gt;, Ebonhorn heads west with Mayla to the &lt;a href=\"Path%20of%20Huln\"&gt;Path of Huln&lt;/a&gt; in order to perform a ritual to aid in Mayla's ascension to the title of High Chieftain. Mayla herself does not see the point of this and protests that traditions can wait until the search for the Hammer of Khaz'goroth is over. Ebonhorn, however, is adamant, and leads Mayla and the adventurer, who has been assigned as Mayla's champion for the ritual quest, into the ancient &lt;a href=\"Neltharion%27s%20Vault\"&gt;vault&lt;/a&gt; of the former Earth Warder &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Neltharion&lt;/a&gt;. Together, the chieftain, the spiritwalker and the hero witness several visions depicting Huln Highmountain using the Hammer of Khaz'goroth to banish the corrupted Earth Warder from Highmountain. Before entering the final vision, Ebonhorn says that the tauren need a leader like Huln, who has the strength and courage to face any obstacle, and that there is one final vision Mayla must see before she is ready to become High Chieftain.\nIn the vision, Huln uses the Hammer of Khaz'goroth to purify a single &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragon&lt;/a&gt; egg, which hatches into a &lt;a href=\"dragon%20whelp\"&gt;whelp&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Ebyssian\"&gt;Ebyssian&lt;/a&gt;, who Huln then proceeds to name \"Ebonhorn\". As the vision ends, Spiritwalker Ebonhorn transforms into a full-grown black dragon and reveals himself to be the very same dragon, having watched over Huln's bloodline for the past ten millennia. Mayla is shocked at this revelation, but Ebyssian assures her that he is still the same spiritwalker she has known her entire life, before at last pronouncing her as High Chieftain. Mayla and the adventurer journey back to Thunder Totem, with the former saying that she now understands what Ebonhorn has been trying to tell her for some time: that the tauren do not need a hammer, but a leader willing to stand against any threat. After all of the allies of Highmountain have been rallied, Mayla leads the counterattack against Dargrul's forces, who have invaded the &lt;a href=\"Snowblind%20Mesa\"&gt;Snowblind Mesa&lt;/a&gt;. Despite the combined efforts of Highmountain, Rivermane, Skyhorn and Stonedark, Dargrul succeeds in destroying &lt;a href=\"Snowmane%20Village\"&gt;Snowmane Village&lt;/a&gt; and escaping into &lt;a href=\"Neltharion%27s%20Lair\"&gt;Neltharion's Lair&lt;/a&gt;, forcing the adventurers to use a hidden side entrance to infiltrate the drogbar capital and finally kill Dargrul.\nLegionfall.\nDuring the campaign on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Armies%20of%20Legionfall\"&gt;Armies of Legionfall&lt;/a&gt;, Mayla led a charge against the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s at the foot of the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; alongside &lt;a href=\"Lasan%20Skyhorn\"&gt;Lasan Skyhorn&lt;/a&gt; and many &lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20Warbrave\"&gt;Highmountain Warbrave&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Rivermane%20Shaman\"&gt;Rivermane Shaman&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Skyhorn%20Interceptor\"&gt;Skyhorn Interceptor&lt;/a&gt;s.\nShe also participated in &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Assaults\"&gt;Legion Assaults&lt;/a&gt;, directing the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;class order leaders&lt;/a&gt;.\nJoining the Horde.\nAfter corresponding with Chieftain &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; in the aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20Campaign\"&gt;Argus Campaign&lt;/a&gt;, Mayla Highmountain accepted an invitation to attend a feast in &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt;. Yet when Baine and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champion&lt;/a&gt; greeted their Highmountain tauren guests, &lt;a href=\"Spiritwalker%20Ebonhorn\"&gt;Spiritwalker Ebonhorn&lt;/a&gt; was tormented by the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods%27%20forces\"&gt;Old Gods' forces&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Uul%27gyneth\"&gt;Uul'gyneth&lt;/a&gt; attempting to corrupt him, and he and Mayla were forced to retreat back to &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Totem\"&gt;Thunder Totem&lt;/a&gt; while Baine and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; champion defended Thunder Bluff from Uul'gyneth's invasion force. Apparently, the wards Ebonhorn had been maintaining in &lt;a href=\"Highmountain\"&gt;Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; weakened just enough to let the Darkness seep through.\nLater on, Baine and the Horde champion traveled to Thunder Totem to offer their aid to mend Ebonhorn, who has been fighting unconsciously to keep a darkness from consuming him. Mayla sent the Horde champion to &lt;a href=\"Spiritwalker%20Graysky\"&gt;Spiritwalker Graysky&lt;/a&gt;, who has the Horde champion undergo &lt;a href=\"Spiritwalker\"&gt;Spiritwalker&lt;/a&gt; rituals to walk in the memories of &lt;a href=\"Igrul%20the%20Scalebane\"&gt;Igrul the Scalebane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Oenia%20Skyhorn\"&gt;Oenia Skyhorn&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Huln%20Highmountain\"&gt;Huln Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; in order to restore the wards that kept the dark corrupting forces at bay. After restoring the wards, Ebonhorn regained consciousness and revealed Uul'gyneth sought to return and conquer Highmountain. Baine, Mayla, the Horde champion, and Ebonhorn left to join &lt;a href=\"Lasan%20Skyhorn\"&gt;Lasan Skyhorn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Aviash\"&gt;Aviash&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Jale%20Rivermane\"&gt;Jale Rivermane&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20Summit\"&gt;Highmountain Summit&lt;/a&gt; to thwart the &lt;a href=\"Necrodark\"&gt;Necrodark&lt;/a&gt;'s ritual to incarnate Uul'gyneth and restore the final ward. They failed, however, and Uul'gyneth was summoned into the physical realm, leaving the Horde champion little choice but to vanquish Uul'gyneth the Darkness. After the battle, Mayla expressed her gratitude for rescuing her people from the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt;. Impressed by the strength and courage of the Horde, Mayla and Baine traveled to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; to pledge the Highmountain tauren to the Horde.\nRemarking that a new age dawns upon Highmountain, Mayla encouraged &lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20tauren%20%28playable%29\"&gt;Highmountain tauren adventurers&lt;/a&gt; with demonstrating their strength to the Horde. She then sent them off to meet with &lt;a href=\"Ambassador%20Blackguard\"&gt;Ambassador Blackguard&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar%20Embassy\"&gt;Orgrimmar Embassy&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. After they brought honor to the Highmountain through their long sojourn, Mayla called them home to Thunder Totem to present them with &lt;a href=\"Heritage%20of%20Highmountain\"&gt;the armor of their people&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nMayla joined the other leaders of the Horde in attending Talanji's coronation.\nWhen Baine was arrested and &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Zelling\"&gt;Zelling&lt;/a&gt; was killed for their parts in freeing &lt;a href=\"Derek%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Derek Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; from Horde captivity, Mayla questioned if her people should ever have left Highmountain if the Horde was willing to imprison those who act with compassion and honor.\nMayla joined &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;'s revolution against &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;. After the revolutionaries and Alliance secured the &lt;a href=\"Dranosh%27ar%20Blockade\"&gt;Dranosh'ar Blockade&lt;/a&gt;, Saurfang ordered Mayla to defend Thunder Bluff in case Sylvanas launched a counterattack. During the conflict, Saurfang challenged Sylvanas to a &lt;a href=\"Mak%27gora\"&gt;Mak'gora&lt;/a&gt;, which ended in his death and Sylvanas's abandonment of the Horde. A stunned Lor'themar ordered for &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt; to report what had transpired to Baine. After learning what occurred, Mayla journeyed to Orgrimmar to attend Saurfang's funeral. Mayla reflected that there were times during the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;war&lt;/a&gt; where she wondered if joining the Horde was a mistake, but that the Horde Saurfang fought for was Horde her people joined, the Horde that they must strive to be, and that there was no better way to Saurfang's memory than by continuing that journey.\nMayla was later seen with Baine in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt;, observing the meeting between &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt;.\nShadows Rising.\nAt some point after its creation, Mayla joined the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Council\"&gt;Horde Council&lt;/a&gt;. While remaining within &lt;a href=\"Highmountain\"&gt;Highmountain&lt;/a&gt;, Mayla sent a dignitary or ambassador to represent the interests of her people to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;. When the council convened with &lt;a href=\"Talanji\"&gt;Queen Talanji&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Empire\"&gt;Zandalari Empire&lt;/a&gt;, the implication that &lt;a href=\"Lilian%20Voss\"&gt;Lilian Voss&lt;/a&gt; was the only missing council member for most of said meeting implied that Mayla or her chosen representative was present. Mayla was not present at the meeting when &lt;a href=\"Zekhan\"&gt;Zekhan&lt;/a&gt; was sent to &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt; nor at the congregation that ended in favor of &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ji%20Firepaw\"&gt;Ji Firepaw&lt;/a&gt; meeting with &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting that she, like &lt;a href=\"Rokhan\"&gt;Rokhan&lt;/a&gt;, was out of the city at the time of the meeting, presumably at &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Totem\"&gt;Thunder Totem&lt;/a&gt;.\nDeath Rising.\nMayla was with Baine in &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt; when the &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt; attacked and captured him.\nMayla alongside her &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Council\"&gt;fellow council members&lt;/a&gt; convened atop of &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hold\"&gt;Grommash Hold&lt;/a&gt; where they informed Horde &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Death%20Rising\"&gt;return of the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; and the abduction of &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;. They also learned from &lt;a href=\"Valeera%20Sanguinar\"&gt;Valeera Sanguinar&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; had also been abducted, and that an attempt was made on &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;, who neutralized her attackers. These champions were subsequently sent to unite with the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; in order to combat the returning enemy. Mayla reflected on how much Baine endured much during the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, how he did all he could to make the Horde strong, while fighting to reclaim its heart, its honor. She thus viewed Baine's captured as a cowardly attack that was all Sylvanas had left. Though admitting that Baine meant a great deal to her, she acknowledged that the fear their people were gripped by ensured that it was not the time for her to leave them. Thus she implored champions to fight to save Baine, as he had fought to save the Horde.\nFollowing the death of &lt;a href=\"Herald%20Dalora\"&gt;Herald Dalora&lt;/a&gt;, the champions returned to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; to inform the council about the events that occurred in &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;dark powers&lt;/a&gt; that Sylvanas had allied with.\nThe Vow Eternal.\nMayla, with Baine as her date, was among those who attended the wedding of &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thalyssra\"&gt;Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt;. During the reception, they spoke with &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt; and discovered that &lt;a href=\"Kurog%20Grimtotem\"&gt;Kurog Grimtotem&lt;/a&gt; had crashed the wedding. After Kurog caused a scene with Wrathion, Mayla informed Thalyssra how the Grimtotem was the aggressor. Thalyssra subsequently ordered Kurog to leave and Mayla bore witness to Wrathion choosing to depart as well.\nDragonflight.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Ebyssian\"&gt;Ebyssian&lt;/a&gt; brought &lt;a href=\"Scalecommander%20Cindrethresh\"&gt;Scalecommander Cindrethresh&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Talons\"&gt;Dark Talons&lt;/a&gt; to Orgrimmar, they were met by hostile guards at the city gates, before Mayla arrived and diffused the situation. She then guided Ebyssian and Cindrethresh to the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Council\"&gt;Horde Council&lt;/a&gt;, where Ebyssian presented the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt; invitation to visit the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;. After the council accepted, she and &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; met with Ebyssian and Cindrethresh, where Ebyssian explained how the isles held great wonder and many perils and that &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; would not abide conflict on their shores. In response, Mayla declared those who answer the call will face whatever challenges may come and formally invited Cindrethresh and the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Talons\"&gt;Dark Talons&lt;/a&gt; into the Horde, to which the &lt;a href=\"dracthyr\"&gt;dracthyr&lt;/a&gt; accepted.\nSometime after this, Mayla made her way towards the &lt;a href=\"zeppelin%20tower\"&gt;zeppelin tower&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Dranosh%27ar%20Blockade\"&gt;Dranosh'ar Blockade&lt;/a&gt;, where she seemed prepared to see the expedition depart. However, she noticed that Baine was distracted and questioned if he was troubled by the news brought by the dragons. In response, Baine confessed that seeing how both the Horde and Alliance had answered the dragon's call caused Baine to remember absent friends. He then revealed that &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; had kindly responded to his letter, revealing that while there had been sightings of &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, none could be verified. Baine then reflected that with all Anduin had suffered in the Shadowlands, he was simply not ready to come home. Mayla responded by reminding Baine that the &lt;a href=\"Earth%20Mother\"&gt;Earth Mother&lt;/a&gt; guides everyone along the path they need to walk, and encouraged Baine to be patient as she feels that one day his friend will return when his feet guide him back to those who love him. A grateful Baine thanked Mayla for the reminder and her kindness.\nAfter Baine traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Ohn%27ahran%20Plains\"&gt;Ohn'ahran Plains&lt;/a&gt; on a personal mission to find the missing &lt;a href=\"Bovan%20Windtotem\"&gt;Bovan Windtotem&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Windtotem\"&gt;Windtotem tribe&lt;/a&gt;, Mayla traveled to &lt;a href=\"Valdrakken\"&gt;Valdrakken&lt;/a&gt; in order to recruit adventurers to aid Baine in his mission, as well as soothe over any possible tensions between the tauren and &lt;a href=\"Maruuk%20Centaur\"&gt;Maruuk Centaur&lt;/a&gt; due to the bloody history between the tauren and &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. Following the discovery of Bovan's death, the rescue of the Windtotem, and the shared funeral between the tauren and Maruuk, Baine sent word to Mayla over all that had transpired.\nMayla later personally traveled to the Ohn'ahran Plains, where she aided the Maruuk and &lt;a href=\"green%20dragonflight\"&gt;green dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; in combating &lt;a href=\"Fyrakk\"&gt;Fyrakk&lt;/a&gt;'s forces at &lt;a href=\"Fyrakk%20Assaults\"&gt;Suffusion Camp: Cinderwind&lt;/a&gt;. During the fighting, she admitted that the Maruuk had earned her respect and reminded her of how she fought for her lands during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. She further stated that in times of conflict, no one should have to stand alone.\nQuotes.\n\"Note: Mayla has different click-on quotes depending on whether or not the player has completed &lt;a href=\"An%20Ancient%20Secret\"&gt;An Ancient Secret&lt;/a&gt;. Prior to completing the quest, she has the following quotes:\n\"After completing the quest, she instead has the following quotes.

The &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonspawn\"&gt;blue dragonspawn&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"General%20Colbatann\"&gt;General Cobaltann&lt;/a&gt; guards it and the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragon\"&gt;blue dragon&lt;/a&gt; matron &lt;a href=\"Haleh\"&gt;Haleh&lt;/a&gt; oversees it.\nThe traditional home of the blue dragonflight is &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, but more and more dragons migrate to the caverns of Mazthoril in &lt;a href=\"Winterspring\"&gt;Winterspring&lt;/a&gt;. This migration occurs for two main reasons: first, because of the growing concern about another imminent attack on the &lt;a href=\"World%20Tree\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt;; and second, to retreat from the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, which some dragons see as a threat the dragonflight is not prepared to conquer. In both locations, the dragons inhabit massive tunnel systems, where they study &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; and prepare for battle against the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, the Scourge and other dangers.\nHistory.\nThe loss of most of his children and mates to &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; and the black dragonflight drove &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt; out of his mind, though his presence in the world diminished more and more over time. Perhaps Malygos's last sane act was aiding in the creation of the World Tree over the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity%20%28Hyjal%29\"&gt;second Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; and placing many of his surviving dragons nearby in the caverns of Mazthoril to hold eternal vigil over the sacred site. Although the tree is watched over by four of the &lt;a href=\"dragonflight\"&gt;dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;s, it is the blue dragonflight that is particularly devoted to this cause, and while their numbers here are not large, they guard the tree from lower on the mountainside in their caverns.\nThe blue dragons in, are near Hyjal, are primarily on watch for activity from the black dragonflight, although there have recently been concerns that the blue dragonflight will be needed to assist the dragons at the Summit if the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"Darkwhisper%20Gorge\"&gt;Darkwhisper Gorge&lt;/a&gt; attack. Since Deathwing's disappearance after the &lt;a href=\"battle%20of%20Grim%20Batol\"&gt;battle of Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;, the black dragonflight's members have been busy fighting each other for dominance, notably two of Deathwing's children \u2014 &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Onyxia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nefarion\"&gt;Nefarion&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 and could be a considerable threat. To this end, the blue dragonflight organizes an army here, led by the dragonspawn General Cobaltann, to protect the world from the increasing threat of the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragon\"&gt;black dragon&lt;/a&gt;s. Specifically, Cobaltann focuses on the protection of dragon eggs, which are being stolen by the blacks for some evil purpose.\nThe &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Everlook\"&gt;Everlook&lt;/a&gt; recently discovered a new mine to the south of their city, not far from the dragon caves of Mazthoril. This mine is valuable due to a large amount of &lt;a href=\"arcanite\"&gt;arcanite&lt;/a&gt; within it, but thus far it proves inaccessible. While not part of the blue dragon's cave complex, the dragons are territorial, and so the goblins are looking for a hero that can find a way to convince the blue dragonflight to allow them access to the mine, in exchange of a nice reward of course.\nIn Warcraft: The Roleplaying Game.\nWithin these caverns lies the true stronghold of the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragon\"&gt;blue dragon&lt;/a&gt;s, the forces of &lt;a href=\"General%20Colbatann\"&gt;Cobaltann&lt;/a&gt;. Guarding this stronghold is an entire legion of &lt;a href=\"dragonspawn\"&gt;dragonspawn&lt;/a&gt; sworn to protect Mazthoril. &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;Night elven&lt;/a&gt; forces - including those rare few who can tame the feral &lt;a href=\"frostsaber%20cat\"&gt;frostsaber cat&lt;/a&gt;s - often clash with the dragonspawn legion, using blade and fang in an attempt to rid themselves of the malevolent dragons."}

The fight involves several adds (similar to &lt;a href=\"High%20King%20Maulgar\"&gt;High King Maulgar&lt;/a&gt;), and is a &lt;a href=\"battle%20for%20survival\"&gt;battle for survival&lt;/a&gt; which is made much easier by high DPS. After killing Karathress, , his prisoner is freed and adventurers can now talk to him.\nRaid composition.\nThe group with the Tidalvess (Shaman) tank should contain a shaman, who keeps &lt;a href=\"Grounding%20Totem\"&gt;Grounding Totem&lt;/a&gt; up at all times, to negate Tidalvess' Frost Shock.\nDue to the mechanics of Fathom-Lord's Cataclysmic Bolt, &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt; tanks are not advisable for this fight. Damage caused by this ability to a tank with ~18-20k health is very difficult to heal through and can easily cause a &lt;a href=\"wipe\"&gt;wipe&lt;/a&gt; for entire raid.\nKill Order.\nSince Blessing of the Tides is a rather evil buff for the boss, it's reasonable to kill the adds first. The priest is the easiest add to control and should be killed last. Whether the shaman or hunter has to be killed first is a matter of choice. The hunter drains mana, the shaman deals the most damage - if the two main tanks both have good gear, it may be better to kill the hunter first. The following kill order minimizes the damage taken by the raid:\nEvery time an add dies, Karathress gains a new ability (similar to the Anubisath Mobs in the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Temple of Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt;):\nPositioning.\nFirst the entire room and the patrol in the next passageway must be cleared. Tanks list:\nThe shaman and the priest both have a 45 yard AoE spell. After the shaman's dead, Karathress gains that ability from the shaman. Thus the best setup would be to have the boss, the shaman and the priest all 45 yards apart from everybody else. Unfortunately such a setup has not been found so far, so usually the priest add gets a small group in one corner, the boss is tanked near his initial position, while the hunter and the shaman are killed away from the other mobs.\nOn the pull, &lt;a href=\"Misdirection\"&gt;Misdirection&lt;/a&gt; is best used on the Shaman add (to prevent him from taking out the Karathress tank with a damage burst), on all other mobs it's optional.\nSpitfire Totem.\nDuring the whole fight, the spitfire totem is a major source of raid damage. While adds are still up, it's absolutely necessary to bring it down ASAP when it spawns. All ranged damage dealers should have a macro to quickly target it i.e. /target Spitfire Totem. When only Karathress remains, it's possible to ignore the totem and simply heal through the damage.\nCaribdis Group.\nOne warrior off-tank, a rogue and a shaman healer is the smallest group able to control Caribdis. Adding a warlock, a mage or an additional healer makes the job easier, but also slows down the killing of the other adds and/or makes raid survival more difficult.\nThe purpose of the priest add group is to interrupt all her heals. The rogue should use &lt;a href=\"Numbing%20Poison\"&gt;Numbing Poison&lt;/a&gt;. When the two melee classes are frozen, the shaman healer must pay extra attention to be ready and use rank 1 &lt;a href=\"Earth%20Shock\"&gt;Earth Shock&lt;/a&gt; when she starts a heal.\nAdding more melee damage dealers to this group is pointless, it only increases the load on the healer. If heals keep getting through, a warlock may keep &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Tongues\"&gt;Curse of Tongues&lt;/a&gt; active on her, and if the warrior or rogue die frequently it helps to have a second healer paying attention to this group. The healer's job is easier if this group can stay 45 yards away from all other mobs, so that the random damage spells from the other mobs don't interfere.\nSoloing Fathom-Lord Karathress.\nFathom-Lord Karathress is one of the most annoying encounters that ramps up in difficulty (due to Fathom-Guard Sharkkis summon a pet every now and then) until Fathom-Guard Carabidis is killed. It can take quite a few tries to master. In addition, without a reliable interrupt ability on a short cooldown such as &lt;a href=\"Mind%20Freeze\"&gt;Mind Freeze&lt;/a&gt;, this encounter is impossible to solo due to incoming Healing Waves.\nStart the encounter by attcking Caribidis. You must kill her before you can kill any of the other members of the group. When her health starts to dip towards 300k, she will cast a Healing Wave (1.5 second cast, 15 second cooldown), which heals for a little more than 100k health. You have to keep interrupting that to kill her. In addition, she summons a Whirlwind that moves around the room. You will have to kite the group away from it. You can get very easily caught in the Whirlwind as one of the group members constantly knock you back, reducing your control over movement. When that happens, you will be out of range to interrupt Caribidis' Healing Waves should she cast it.\nIf your damage is high enough, to work around the healing Caribidis does, attack one of the pets that Sharkkis summons and bring it down to near 50% health. Caribidis will always heal the target with the least percentage of health, thus, she will heal the pet. Still, it is advisiable to keep interrupting her. (Every interrupt will thus not require you to damage a pet) as the longer you take to kill her, the higher the rate of damage taken (due to increasing numbers of summoned pets).\nOnce Caribidis is killed, start killing all the pets that Sharkkis has summoned. Once all the pets and Carabidis are dead, the fight becomes very easy. Even when Karathress has the Blessing of the Tides and all guards dead, conferring him new abilities, he is still a pushover. Next up, kill Sharkkis, followed by Tidalvess and finally the Fathom-Lord himself.\nHe drops 250 gold, 3 &lt;a href=\"Tier%205\"&gt;Tier 5&lt;/a&gt; tokens and 1 epic item."}

{"id": "16655", "revid": "46586549", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=16655", "title": "Fatigue", "text": "Fatigue is a condition that affects any character travelling through or over water that is too deep, such as the oceans surrounding the &lt;a href=\"continent\"&gt;continent&lt;/a&gt;s.\nClose to land, the ocean floor is generally not very far below sea level, and it can usually be seen from the surface; at greater distances from the shore, the floor recedes deeper and deeper. When the depth of the water reaches a certain point, &lt;a href=\"swim\"&gt;swim&lt;/a&gt;ming in the region causes a Fatigue bar to appear, which displaying a player's weariness. It behaves similar to the &lt;a href=\"Breath\"&gt;Breath&lt;/a&gt; bar; the bar will deplete over time (the Fatigue bar depletes much faster than the Breath bar, it matches the rate at which the Breath bar originally depleted), and will deal damage to the player when it reaches zero. The Fatigue bar and Fatigue damage occurs regardless of the player's depth. (i.e. swimming on the surface, diving, &lt;a href=\"Water%20Walking\"&gt;water walking&lt;/a&gt; or even &lt;a href=\"flying\"&gt;flying&lt;/a&gt; over a Fatigue region will cause this). Players may swim back toward shallower waters to refill the fatigue bar and avoid death. &lt;a href=\"Hunter%20pet\"&gt;Hunter pet&lt;/a&gt;s seem to be affected by Fatigue as well; however, they display no Fatigue bar to show their weariness. The Fatigue damage can be seen in the &lt;a href=\"Combat%20Log\"&gt;Combat Log&lt;/a&gt;.\nFatigue also affects players in &lt;a href=\"Death%20%28gameplay%29\"&gt;ghost form&lt;/a&gt;, as the player who is attempting to navigate as a ghost will simply die once more as a ghost (and inflict a second durability penalty) and have to return to their body or resurrect at the &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Healer\"&gt;Spirit Healer&lt;/a&gt;. This quirk can be useful for exploration, as the second \"death\" as a ghost breaks the ghost's association with its current graveyard and instead binds the player to the graveyard closest to the point where the ghost \"died\" of fatigue. It can be used, for example, to access graveyards that are meant to inaccessible without a flying mount.\nFatigue exists to prevent players from straying too far from land and reaching areas that are unfinished. It also serves as a natural boundary enclosing zones. You can see a Fatigue region when the ocean floor seems to slope downward endlessly. Don't bother trying to reach the absolute bottom of the ocean, as even if you survive the Fatigue damage long enough to get reach it, there is a barrier at a certain depth below sea-level (except in &lt;a href=\"Vashj%27ir\"&gt;Vashj'ir&lt;/a&gt;) which kills all characters, similar to the death barriers you encounter whilst falling off the edges in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;.\nFatigue is not associated with time spent swimming. Because of fatigue mechanics, there are a few \"normal\" areas in the World of Warcraft where fatigue erroneously occurs, such as one small strip of the &lt;a href=\"Vile%20Reef\"&gt;Vile Reef&lt;/a&gt;. Fatigue never occurs in inland lakes, or rivers, no matter how long you swim. Fatigue zones can be easily identified by a darker color on the surface of the water than surrounding areas (also visible in the &lt;a href=\"minimap\"&gt;minimap&lt;/a&gt;. If swimming an unusual route (for example, from &lt;a href=\"Zoram%20Strand\"&gt;Zoram Strand&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Shadowprey%20Village\"&gt;Shadowprey Village&lt;/a&gt;) you must tightly hug the shoreline in places to prevent fatigue, although you may save some time by swimming through the Fatigue area, provided you can be sure to clear it before the bar is depleted.\nMana regeneration.\nWhile in a Fatigue zone, &lt;a href=\"mana\"&gt;mana&lt;/a&gt; regeneration, both regular and while casting (&lt;a href=\"mp5\"&gt;mp5&lt;/a&gt;) will cease, meaning it is almost impossible to survive in Fatigue water indefinitely. Some spells and abilities, as well as &lt;a href=\"potion\"&gt;potion&lt;/a&gt;s may still be useful to regenerate mana while Fatigued, but the easiest way to regain mana is to enter safer water.\nBefore this mechanic was in place, low level characters, who have low health pools, high health regeneration (proportional to their total health), and very powerful and mana-efficient heals (again, proportional to their total health), could swim indefinitely in Fatigue water, as their mana regenerated entirely in the time it took for Fatigue to do damage equal the amount healed. The mechanic also increases the difficulty of higher level characters who try to swim through Fatigue.\nDamage done.\nThe damage done is equal to 20% of your max &lt;a href=\"HP\"&gt;HP&lt;/a&gt; every 2 seconds. It is possible to reduce the damage of every tick by removing any gear or buffs that grant bonus HP or &lt;a href=\"stamina\"&gt;stamina&lt;/a&gt;, but this often comes at the cost of losing mana required for healing through the Fatigue itself.\nFatigue-negating techniques.\nThe fastest way to move over fatigue areas is a flying mount.\nAlthough the fatigue timer cannot be slowed, players may extend the distance they swim through various means: &lt;a href=\"Swim%20Speed%20Potion\"&gt;Swim Speed Potion&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Aquatic%20Form\"&gt;Aquatic Form&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Water%20Walking\"&gt;Water Walking&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Path%20of%20Frost\"&gt;Path of Frost&lt;/a&gt; can increase the speed at which players travel through or over water. With 2/2 &lt;a href=\"On%20a%20Pale%20Horse\"&gt;On a Pale Horse&lt;/a&gt;, a Death Knight can make a mounted run between Teldrassil and Darkshore without dying from fatigue. See &lt;a href=\"Swim%23Methods%20to%20increase%20swim%20speed\"&gt;Swim#Methods to increase swim speed&lt;/a&gt; for the full list.\nDying resets the fatigue bar, so players may use a &lt;a href=\"Soulstone\"&gt;Soulstone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Reincarnation\"&gt;Reincarnation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Resurrection\"&gt;Resurrection&lt;/a&gt; or other means to continue traveling further out to sea. \nDamage done by fatigue can be healed, though the means of healing are limited by the mana regeneration restrictions mentioned above. Potions can supplement the limited healing received while Fatigued, but their cooldowns are too long to rely on the potions alone for survival.\nNote that swimming between continents is impossible even without fatigue as &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Azuremyst%20Isles\"&gt;Azuremyst Isles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; exist in different \"instances\". For example, a player swimming from Kalimdor due east would reach the end of the Kalimdor map and weird emptiness beyond, not the Eastern Kingdoms or into other areas where they aren't wanted.\nFatigue-negating techniques were actually \"required\" to travel to &lt;a href=\"South%20Seas%20islands\"&gt;the Islands&lt;/a&gt; south of &lt;a href=\"Land%27s%20End%20Beach\"&gt;Land's End Beach&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Tanaris\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt; before they were destroyed in &lt;a href=\"Patch%204.0.3a\"&gt;the Shattering&lt;/a&gt;.\nFatigue \"Plagued\" Shortcuts.\nThere are some places in the game in which someone with the fastest flying speed could beat the Fatigue meter in order to create a shortcut for themselves if need be. \nFor instance, the ocean north of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; can be flown over to make a straight line to &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Morogh\"&gt;Dun Morogh&lt;/a&gt; in time. \nAlso, someone could fly from &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt; and beat the Fatigue meter easily (an important aspect for Horde players who wish to either get achievements that require them to go to &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; cities or to raid &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt;).\nFinally, the westernmost tip of &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Morogh\"&gt;Dun Morogh&lt;/a&gt; can be flown from to reach the flight master in &lt;a href=\"Vashj%27ir\"&gt;Vashj'ir&lt;/a&gt;, and it's possible to reach the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Gilneas\"&gt;Ruins of Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; from the northern coast of Dun Morogh.\nIn each of these instances, a Fatigue meter will show, but a player can easily beat it, making them handy shortcuts for the player wishing to save time (or to plan world PvP strategies).\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

{"id": "15291", "revid": "40389549", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=15291", "title": "Fear effect", "text": "Fear effects are a form of &lt;a href=\"crowd%20control\"&gt;crowd control&lt;/a&gt; that makes a victim to run in random directions, unable to perform most actions for a period of time. Feared creatures have a chance to break Fear when damaged. Any Fear, no matter the duration listed, will last a maximum of 8 seconds when used against players in &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt;, and fear is affected by &lt;a href=\"diminishing%20returns\"&gt;diminishing returns&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Undead\"&gt;Undead&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mechanical\"&gt;Mechanical&lt;/a&gt; monsters are generally immune to Fear. &lt;a href=\"Boss\"&gt;Boss&lt;/a&gt; monsters, including lesser bosses of pre-70 instances, and some &lt;a href=\"Elite%20creature\"&gt;elite&lt;/a&gt; monsters are immune to Fear and other &lt;a href=\"crowd%20control\"&gt;crowd control&lt;/a&gt; effects. \nFear, among all &lt;a href=\"crowd%20control\"&gt;crowd control&lt;/a&gt; types, is unique in that the victim runs around, sometimes quite a distance before the effect ends. Players affected by it may run into awkward areas (though they will not fall off cliffs) or into more enemy monsters or players that may attack. Monsters affected by Fear may also run into groups of monsters, alerting their friends which then come running into the fight. This often makes fear effects dangerous at best in PvE, especially when used in crowded areas. However, most player fear effects can be modified with glyphs to instead cause their targets to tremble in place, making them viable for use in PvE.\nFear effects have a damage limit, which appears to be based on level. Once the target takes a certain amount of damage, the fear effect will be broken, regardless of any remaining duration. This can allow you to deal a fair amount of damage to the target before it does so. Melee targets will also have to run back to the caster in order to resume attacking them, allowing ranged classes more time to deal damage. Ranged types may therefore wish to decide how far to allow melee targets to run before attacking, ideally leaving them with a long run back.\nAll Fear effects also increase the afflicted target's run speed by 25%, making it harder to catch feared targets. When using Fear effects on flag carriers in &lt;a href=\"battlegrounds\"&gt;battlegrounds&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Gulch\"&gt;Warsong Gulch&lt;/a&gt;, this can occasionally have the effect of accelerating their progress across the field. Fear effects do not inherently dismount players, meaning mounted players can ride a long way while feared.\nMany Fear effects are magical and can be dispelled or reflected; many are &lt;a href=\"Shadow\"&gt;Shadow&lt;/a&gt; and are affected by Shadow &lt;a href=\"Resistance\"&gt;Resistance&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"boss\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt;es cause Fear to the entire raid. Losing your fear before the &lt;a href=\"tank\"&gt;tank&lt;/a&gt; does can be hazardous to your health as you may be acquired as the mob's target.\nPlayer abilities that cause the fear effect.\nThe &lt;a href=\"paladins\"&gt;paladins&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Turn%20Evil\"&gt;Turn Evil&lt;/a&gt; functions very similarly to fear effects, but is considered a \"turn\" effect for the purpose of immunities, etc.\nFear counters and blocks.\nCounters.\nWays to remove Fear effects:\nHostile counters:\nFear prevention.\nSome abilities that help prevent or make you immune to Fear:\nSilences, stuns and interrupts.\nAnother method of preventing Fear would be preventing the caster from using a Fear through your own &lt;a href=\"crowd%20control\"&gt;crowd control&lt;/a&gt; or anti-spellcasting abilities. Some examples are listed below. For fuller listings and discussion see &lt;a href=\"interrupt\"&gt;interrupt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"silence%20effect\"&gt;silence effect&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"crowd%20control\"&gt;crowd control&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlso dealing fatal damage, a high shadow resistance, or avoiding the range or area the user can hit with fear are all viable ways to stop the Fear from happening."}

It involves using the &lt;a href=\"Fear\"&gt;Fear&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"spell\"&gt;spell&lt;/a&gt; on an enemy, casting damaging spells on the enemy and then, when the fear runs out, casting Fear on them again to repeat the process. This technique allows the Warlock to use &lt;a href=\"damage%20over%20time\"&gt;damage over time&lt;/a&gt; spells or spells with long &lt;a href=\"cast%20time\"&gt;casting times&lt;/a&gt; that he/she normally would not be able to when in close combat. A skilled Warlock can keep an opponent \"feared\" so that the opponent can't even get one hit in.\nThis technique does have its limitations though, particularly in &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt;. The opponent may use a &lt;a href=\"trinket\"&gt;trinket&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"racial%20trait\"&gt;racial trait&lt;/a&gt; to undo the fear effect or may have a spell which has given them &lt;a href=\"resistance\"&gt;resistance&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"immunity\"&gt;immunity&lt;/a&gt; to fear. Also in &lt;a href=\"patch%202.2.0\"&gt;patch 2.2.0&lt;/a&gt; Banish, Seduction, Enslave Demon and Fear duration against PvP targets has been reduced to 10 seconds.\nIn PvE an enemy that is feared that runs too close to another enemy that is allied with it will cause the extra enemy to attack the warlock. This is particularly deadly in instances. A very skilled warlock can use Curse of Recklessness to avoid this by casting it on a feared enemy that is nearing an ally to make it temporarily immune to fear. The enemy will come running back to the warlock, averting disaster. Once the enemy is close again a different curse can be placed on the target, replacing the curse of recklessness and making it run away in fear again."}

The &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; seems to flow through its wielder from the weapon, and despite it coming from a vastly different culture, Baine felt a kinship through its power towards &lt;a href=\"An%27she\"&gt;An'she&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mu%27sha\"&gt;Mu'sha&lt;/a&gt; when Anduin first gave it to him. The mace was given to then-Prince &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;King Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; during the prince's visit to that city shortly before the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;. Anduin eventually gave the weapon as a gift to &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; to assist him in reclaiming &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Magatha%20Grimtotem\"&gt;Magatha Grimtotem&lt;/a&gt;, but Baine returned the hammer before the &lt;a href=\"Attack%20on%20Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;fall of Theramore&lt;/a&gt; as he did not feel worthy to wield it. Fearbreaker remained in Anduin's possession for several years, finding its place in the &lt;a href=\"War%20Room\"&gt;War Room&lt;/a&gt;, until Magni reclaimed it to combat the return of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\n\"Gleaming as bright as the day it was made although it was quite old. The head was silver, wrapped in intersecting bands of gold that had runes etched into it. Small gems dotted it here and there. It was altogether a thing of beauty and power.\"\nHistory.\nThe Shattering.\nFearbreaker was a family heirloom of the &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard%20clan\"&gt;Bronzebeard clan&lt;/a&gt; and had been passed down in Magni's &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard\"&gt;family&lt;/a&gt; for many hundreds of years. It had been used in both &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring Prince &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;'s visit to the &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarven&lt;/a&gt; capital of &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;, King &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; gave Fearbreaker to him and explained a little of its history. As Magni related it to Anduin, \"it's known the taste o' blood and in certain hands has been known to also stanch blood\", which implies that the weapon is imbued with healing powers. Indeed, when Anduin (and later Baine) took up the weapon, the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; seemed to flow through them from the weapon, showing that the weapon \"liked\" them.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Moira%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Moira Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt; held the city hostage with her &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;Dark Iron&lt;/a&gt; forces, Anduin hid the weapon, believing Moira would not appreciate that he had been given a family heirloom. When he later escaped by &lt;a href=\"%3Ahearthstone\"&gt;:hearthstone&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore Isle&lt;/a&gt;, he took the weapon with him, and while meeting Baine, was inspired to give it to the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; to assist him in reclaiming &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Magatha%20Grimtotem\"&gt;Magatha Grimtotem&lt;/a&gt;, after checking that the mace would accept him as it had Anduin. Baine subsequently wielded the hammer during the &lt;a href=\"battle%20for%20Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;battle for Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt; and personally struck Magatha with it, forcing her to yield.\nBaine's weapon.\nBaine wielded the mace when he was attacking &lt;a href=\"quilboar\"&gt;quilboar&lt;/a&gt;s and rescuing &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;. It shone brightly like the Light.\nSome time after &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; was killed, the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; led an attack on &lt;a href=\"Northwatch%20Hold\"&gt;Northwatch Hold&lt;/a&gt; and from there planned on &lt;a href=\"Attack%20on%20Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;destroy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore Isle&lt;/a&gt;. Baine sent &lt;a href=\"Perith%20Stormhoof\"&gt;Perith Stormhoof&lt;/a&gt; to warn &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; in advance, and also had Perith deliver Fearbreaker with the request that Anduin take it back, as Baine did not feel he was worthy enough of holding the weapon.\nWhen Jaina returned to the ruined Theramore for the last time, she found the mace, undamaged. She took it with her when she left, and would later give it back to Anduin.\nWar Crimes.\nDuring the trial of Garrosh Hellscream, Anduin was seen with the mace at the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Rise\"&gt;Violet Rise&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Isle of Thunder&lt;/a&gt;, where the &lt;a href=\"Wrynn\"&gt;Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;s stayed for the duration of the trial.\nWhen Garrosh Hellscream escaped, a King Anduin Wrynn from an &lt;a href=\"alternate%20timeline\"&gt;alternate timeline&lt;/a&gt; appeared in the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20White%20Tiger\"&gt;Temple of the White Tiger&lt;/a&gt;, clutching Fearbreaker in his hands. The Prince Anduin took the glowing mace when the king was overwhelmed and began fighting a hunter Vol'jin from another timeline. Enraged, Vol'jin threw his &lt;a href=\"glaive\"&gt;glaive&lt;/a&gt; at the prince but he quickly drew the mace, knocking the tossed weapon aside. After the king died, the prince took the weapon and continued fighting and defending himself. What happened with the alternate weapon is unclear, but it is likely that it was returned to King Anduin's timeline.\nBefore the Storm.\nThe recently appointed King Anduin had the mace by his side during the ceremony at &lt;a href=\"Lion%27s%20Rest\"&gt;Lion's Rest&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20Campaign\"&gt;Argus Campaign&lt;/a&gt;. When not in use, Anduin's &lt;a href=\"Servant\"&gt;manservant&lt;/a&gt;\u2014&lt;a href=\"Wyll%20Benton\"&gt;Wyll Benton&lt;/a&gt;\u2014would mount Fearbreaker on a hook on Anduin's bedroom wall so that the king could easily access it just in case.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nAt the end of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, Speaker Magni asked Anduin if he could get his weapon back, as its power would be needed in the days to come upon the return of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;. Anduin guided the dwarf to the weapon in the war room and confessed relief that Magni was taking the weapon back, reiterating how he and Baine didn't feel worthy of it. Although Magni stated he wouldn't have bestowed it to Anduin in the first place if he wasn't, Anduin believed it belonged in the hands of a &lt;a href=\"mountain%20king\"&gt;mountain king&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpeculation.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"War%20Crimes\"&gt;War Crimes&lt;/a&gt;\", it was not clearly stated if the Fearbreaker seen in King Anduin's hands was from his alternate timeline or from the main timeline. If the latter, the weapon shouldn't have been in the temple as weapons were forbidden during the trial and the combatants were given weapons by the &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; when the chaos erupted. When King Anduin died and returned to his own timeline, the weapon did not vanish with him but was instead taken up by Prince Anduin. However, it's possible that it vanished back to its own timeline at a later point."}

It is used to transport prisoners \u2014 especially dangerous prisoners \u2014 from one location to another and, occasionally, as a permanent jail (housing prisoners on a ship reduces the possibility of escape). The Fearsome Yacht is an amalgamation of traditional shipbuilding and crazy goblin technology. Metal plates are bolted to the wooden walls, floors and ceilings at random places. The ship runs on both steam power, via a large boiler and a pair of waterwheels, and wind power, via two masts. The Yacht includes three levels: the deck, the mid level, and the bottom level.\nIt was sent to &lt;a href=\"Tol%20Barad\"&gt;Tol Barad&lt;/a&gt; in order to imprison there an &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href=\"Dak%27mal\"&gt;Dak'mal&lt;/a&gt; who had been causing trouble on &lt;a href=\"Kezan\"&gt;Kezan&lt;/a&gt;. In their way there, Dak'mal used magic to make a tribe of murlocs attack and wreck the ship. Luckily, the goblins managed to get out in a lifeboat. A group of adventurers who was passing nearby decided to help the goblins and went into the wrecked ship while a storm begun to form. They fought the murlocs, and defeated the orc companion, a &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"runemaster\"&gt;runemaster&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href=\"Umber%20Goonrock\"&gt;Umber Goonrock&lt;/a&gt;. After finding out Dak'mal was working with the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt;, the adventurers confronted him and either killed or imprisoned the orc. Afterwards they returned with the goblins who sent them to Kezan where the &lt;a href=\"trade%20prince\"&gt;trade prince&lt;/a&gt;s would pay them for their efforts. Once there, if the heroes had captured Dak'mal and had also repaired the yatch, they were rewarded with a great amount of gold."}

And throughout Azeroth, it is the season to be jolly!\"\nInfo from the official site.\n&lt;poem&gt;'Twas the feast of Great-Winter\nAnd all through the land\nAll the races were running\nWith snowballs in hand.\nThe cooks were all frantic\nAnd for those \"in the know\"\nSwoops and owls were crashing\nLike new-fallen snow.\nCookies and eggnog\nWere consumed by all\nAs the snowballs flew freely\nAnd drunks smashed into walls.\nMay your feast of Great-Winter\nBe one merry and bright\nAnd from all here at Blizzard\nWe wish you a fun night!&lt;/poem&gt;\nThe Feast of Winter Veil is upon us, and &lt;a href=\"Greatfather%20Winter\"&gt;Greatfather Winter&lt;/a&gt; is busy spreading holiday cheer in major cities across the land! Here are a few holiday treats players can now experience in-game:\nOrigins.\nThe later seasons of Azeroth are marked as a time of change in many cultures. The dwarves and the tauren especially look to the legend of the coming Winter Veil - the blanketing of the land in snow, thus heralding a time of renewal - as a time for celebration. Though the understanding of the legends that the races of Azeroth share are not dissimilar, the ways they choose to acknowledge them are as diverse as the races themselves. The term \"Winter Veil\" is said to stem from a supernatural being referred in many cultures to as &lt;a href=\"Greatfather%20Winter\"&gt;Greatfather Winter&lt;/a&gt;. As he would walk the land late in the seasons, winter itself would be his billowing cloak. In his wake was the blanketing of the land in snow, and thus it is said that Greatfater Winter would cast his wintry veil over the land. Though parts of Azeroth may lie in snow, it gives the land time for rebirth and renewal.\nEver consumed with the research of their origins, the dwarves choose to celebrate the season as a recognition of &lt;a href=\"Greatfather%20Winter\"&gt;Greatfather Winter&lt;/a&gt; himself. They consider him to be the personification of one of the ancients of Azeroth - the &lt;a href=\"Titans\"&gt;Titans&lt;/a&gt;. Much as they claim lineage in one degree or another to these mystical beings, they consider their snowy home of Dun Morogh as the prime example of Greatfather Winter's blessings. The holiday was introduced to the Alliance at large by &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; and their shamanistic understanding of winter, along with their recent emergence into druidic endeavors, fit in well with the legend of Winter Veil. They focus almost entirely on the renewing aspects of the lore, however, leaving legend worship to those races (as they view it) less in tune with the nature of things. Many tauren choose this time as the right time to give thanks for the blessings of their new home in Mulgore.\nPresents.\nNear the end of the Feast of Winter Veil (starting on December 25 to the end of the event), various gifts are available underneath the trees near &lt;a href=\"Greatfather%20Winter\"&gt;Greatfather Winter&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Great-father%20Winter\"&gt;Great-father Winter&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile some of the gifts are available to all, you must be at least a certain level to receive others.\nHoliday-only items.\nThere are several special items and plans that are only available during the Feast of Winter Veil.\nToys.\nThirty-eight &lt;a href=\"Toy%20Box\"&gt;toys&lt;/a&gt; are available, most of which are exclusive to Winter Veil:\nSeven toys are sold by vendors year-round:\nThere are other toys available during the event:\nThis year's gifts are: &lt;a href=\"Falling%20Star%20Catcher\"&gt;Falling Star Catcher&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Falling%20Star%20Flinger\"&gt;Falling Star Flinger&lt;/a&gt;.\nPrevious-year gifts are only found in the &lt;a href=\"Stolen%20Present\"&gt;Stolen Present&lt;/a&gt; (daily):\n&lt;a href=\"Scroll%20of%20Storytelling\"&gt;Scroll of Storytelling&lt;/a&gt; has a chance to drop from the &lt;a href=\"Stolen%20Present\"&gt;Stolen Present&lt;/a&gt;.\nPets.\nEleven pets are available during Winter Veil:\nOne pet spawns as a battle pet in the &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Snow%20Globe\"&gt;Giant Snow Globe&lt;/a&gt;s:\nOne pet is sold by toy vendors year round and is also rarely found in the &lt;a href=\"Stolen%20Present\"&gt;Stolen Present&lt;/a&gt;:\nFour pets are only found in the &lt;a href=\"Stolen%20Present\"&gt;Stolen Present&lt;/a&gt; (daily):\nOne of four pets is found in the &lt;a href=\"Gaily%20Wrapped%20Present\"&gt;Gaily Wrapped Present&lt;/a&gt; (one-time per character each year, requires level 20):\nOne pet is rarely found in &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Mound%20%28Frostfire%20Ridge%29\"&gt;Snow Mounds&lt;/a&gt; in the quest area of &lt;a href=\"Frostfire%20Ridge\"&gt;Frostfire Ridge&lt;/a&gt;:\nCrafting recipes.\nSent in a letter from Greatfather Winter, players with &lt;a href=\"Cooking\"&gt;Cooking&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Leatherworking\"&gt;Leatherworking&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Tailoring\"&gt;Tailoring&lt;/a&gt; skills will receive:\nVendors sell the following recipes:\nInside the &lt;a href=\"Ticking%20Present\"&gt;Ticking Present&lt;/a&gt; (from December 25 to January 2) or the &lt;a href=\"Smokywood%20Pastures%20Special%20Gift\"&gt;Smokywood Pastures Special Gift&lt;/a&gt; (quest reward from saving Metzen), players may find:\nGeneral goods.\nVendors in Alliance and Neutral cities have the Red Winter Clothes pattern available for sale, while vendors in Horde cities have the Green Winter Clothes pattern. (Note: It is possible to acquire the other faction's winter clothes pattern because the associated vendors are &lt;a href=\"neutral\"&gt;neutral&lt;/a&gt; to all players, but be prepared to die multiple times due to &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt; attacks and city guards.)\nWinter Hats.\nDuring the Feast of Winter Veil, some bosses now have a festive holiday hat equipped with a chance of dropping that hat. An extension to this, the winter hats also have an extremely low chance to drop from any &lt;a href=\"humanoid\"&gt;humanoid&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuests.\nThere are three sets of quests available during Winter Veil. First, a quick intro to the holiday itself and a short fetch quest:\nAnother quest series reveals some of the history of Winter Veil, and awards some reputation with the home city.\nThe last set introduces the daily boss up in &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Abominable%20Greench\"&gt;The Abominable Greench&lt;/a&gt;:\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

He disapproves of Li Li following in Chen's footsteps.\nHistory.\nLi Li's Travel Journal.\nAfter Li Li destroyed the book Book of the Turtle, Chon Po's punishment was to write the lyrics of Song of Liu Lang thousand times.

He ordered her to spend a week of training with Strongbo.\nPearl of Pandaria.\nChon Po did not agree with Li Li's views that life was an adventure, and was very strict in keeping her away from letters written by his brother. After one incident in which Li Li fell asleep during a &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Festival\"&gt;Spirit Festival&lt;/a&gt; musical in which she was meant to perform, she ran away from the Wandering Isle in search of Chen. Chon Po asked the martial arts master &lt;a href=\"Strongbo\"&gt;Strongbo&lt;/a&gt;, an old friend of his bother's, to find Li Li and bring her home.\nWhen Li Li returned home at the end of her journey, Chon Po was much more happy than upset.\nQuest for Pandaria.\nDuring dinner with his children and brother, Chon Po got into an argument with Li Li about the events of \"Pearl of Pandaria\". When Chen tried to tactfully end the argument, Chon Po stated that if Li Li had not run off, Bo would still be alive, upsetting her. As he and Chen spoke more, Chen realized that Chon Po didn't so much disapprove of Li Li, as he was transferring his frustration about Chen leaving years ago onto her.\nWhen the long thought dead &lt;a href=\"Wanyo\"&gt;Wanyo&lt;/a&gt; suddenly reappeared, Chon Po was among the pandaren elders who spoke to him. Li Li then escaped once more and he sent Chen to bring her back. He was very saddened by his daughter's leaving but &lt;a href=\"Mei\"&gt;Mei&lt;/a&gt; tried to soothe him by reminding him of Xiu Li and telling him the last words &lt;a href=\"Strongbo\"&gt;Strongbo&lt;/a&gt; said to Li Li and Chen before he died.\nLegion.\nChon Po and his son &lt;a href=\"Shisai%20Stormstout\"&gt;Shisai&lt;/a&gt; appear in the &lt;a href=\"Laughing%20Crane\"&gt;Laughing Crane&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Mandori%20Village\"&gt;Mandori Village&lt;/a&gt; after the monks of the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Broken%20Temple\"&gt;Order of the Broken Temple&lt;/a&gt; relocate from the destroyed &lt;a href=\"Peak%20of%20Serenity\"&gt;Peak of Serenity&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;.

If multiple Participants refer the same friend, the Participant whose email brings the referred friend to the site will receive the 50 Tokens for the referral.

A Participant already logged into the Website will automatically earn Tokens as seen on the Participant's Account History page.\nDistribution Availability to Canada.\nWhile it would seem that it would have been simple to add Canada into the distribution, this is not the case. Health Canada, through the Canadian Food and Drugs Act, prohibited the sale of caffinated soft drinks other than cola; a caffinated Mountain Dew was classified as a natural health product and branded \"Dew Fuel\", produced until 2007. Thus, regular Mountain Dew sold in Canada at that time was actually the United States' \"Caffeine-Free Mountain Dew\". Game Fuel has caffine in it, and producing a non-caffinated version for a limited time promotion would likely not have been cost-effective.\nIn March 2010, the ban on synthetic caffeine in non-cola beverages was lifted and in March 2012 new recipes containing caffeine replaced regular Mountain Dew, \"Mountain Dew Citrus Charge\". A \"Mountain Dew White Out\" and \"Mountain Dew Code Red\" are also available, all as regular or diet drinks and slurpee flavors. The new flavors have a caffine content of 51 mg per serving, compared to the US's content of 54 mg.\nIt should be noted however that this does not mean that Game Fuel promotions will be available to Canada in the future. The limited-edition \"Mountain Dew Dark Berry\" for \"The Dark Knight Rises\" film, released on June 18, 2012 for eight weeks, was only available in the US.\nExternal links.\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.mountaindewgamefuel.com/wow/incoming_earn.php%3Fe%3D51%26amp%3Br%3D918140837575\"&gt;Mountain Dew Game Fuel Sign-Up Page&lt;/a&gt;"}

{"id": "20756", "revid": "30741107", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=20756", "title": "Choosing a class", "text": "Choosing what &lt;a href=\"class\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt; you want to be in \"World of Warcraft\" is probably the most important choice you will make about your character. Unlike races - which can be changed for a fee - classes are permanent, and cannot be changed once a character has been created. Well, what exactly is a class? A character's class determines what &lt;a href=\"ability\"&gt;abilities&lt;/a&gt; and powers are available to them; what &lt;a href=\"Equipment\"&gt;weapons and armor&lt;/a&gt; they will use; what combat &lt;a href=\"role\"&gt;role&lt;/a&gt;s they can fulfil; and to a significant extent their strengths, weaknesses and playstyle. Your choice of class will affect how you play your character, and how you play with others, and each class has something very different to offer. \nChoice of class is limited by your choice of race: each race can only play certain classes, and vice versa. A mage is a class, a warrior is a class, a dwarf is not a class, it's a &lt;a href=\"race\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt;! For a table of possible class/race combinations, &lt;a href=\"%23Class%2C%20race%20and%20class%20role\"&gt;see below&lt;/a&gt;. For more help on how to choose a race, see the &lt;a href=\"Choosing%20a%20race\"&gt;Choosing a race&lt;/a&gt; page.\nYou should try to choose a class that's capable of fulfilling the &lt;a href=\"role\"&gt;role&lt;/a&gt;/s you find appealing. For instance, if you like helping others, supporting the team and keeping others alive, you might want to choose a class with healing capabilities. If leading the party into battle and protecting your allies by taking the brunt of enemies' attacks is your thing, then you might want to choose a class that is capable of tanking. If you'd prefer to be the one dishing out the damage, you might consider whether you want to be standing toe-to-toe with your enemies, or smiting them from afar.\nIt also helps to choose a class with a playstyle you think you will enjoy playing. For example, if you like the idea of striking from the shadows, assassinating targets with pin-point precision and slipping away into the night, you might enjoy playing a &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt; or a feral &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;. On the other hand, if you like being in the middle of the fray, charging into battle and tearing your enemies apart with massive weapons, you might prefer a &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;. Each class has its own, very different style.\nLore can also affect choice of class. Do you like the thought of being a stalwart &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;, champion of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;? A wise &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt; seeking to restore nature's balance? A meditative &lt;a href=\"monk\"&gt;monk&lt;/a&gt; seeking inner peace and enlightenment? Or a dark &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; delving deep into demonic powers? Choosing a class whose background you enjoy can add a lot to playing your character.\nIn addition to the choice of class, each class has three different &lt;a href=\"specialization\"&gt;specialization&lt;/a&gt;s or 'specs' (druids have four, demon hunters have two). Each specialization represents a very different approach to playing the class, offering numerous new abilities and often changing the combat role the character is most suitable for. Each class can therefore be considered to have three (or four) major variants, each with its own skill-set, strengths and playing-style.\nNote that there is no reason not to experiment with any and every class you want to. Many players will try a class for a while, then be drawn to try another, and then another after that. It's alright to keep changing around, especially if you're still looking for that class that really clicks. Keep trying new classes until you find something you really enjoy, or just keep switching between characters as the mood takes you. Players can create up to 50 characters on a single account, so you should feel free to jump in and try out any class you feel like.\nNew players should also remember that a class's strengths and character may not be obvious until later levels (particularly 40+). Sometimes all you need is a single spell that changes your gameplay from maddeningly difficult to extremely fun. Playing a certain class might seem particularly difficult during early levels, but the class may suddenly change after learning a new ability or talent, increasing the fun and excitement of playing it by several notches. Having a source of advice on playing your desired class, from the beginning until the level cap, can also be helpful if you're having trouble getting to grips with a class.\nFinally, it should be noted that \"World of Warcraft\" is a constantly-evolving game. Any given class or &lt;a href=\"specialization\"&gt;specialization&lt;/a&gt;'s potency may vary dramatically from &lt;a href=\"patch\"&gt;patch&lt;/a&gt; to patch. The class descriptions below intentionally minimize references to class balance and specific abilities for this very reason.\nCan't decide which class to choose?\nWhen choosing a class, it's certainly worth reading about the different options that appeal to you, and doing a little research before jumping right in. If you already have a character, speak to friends and guild mates about their classes, and what it's like to play them. Bear in mind everyone has their own perspective on classes. Also, watch others play, and decide what looks like fun to you.\nHowever, one of the best ways to explore a class is simply to roll a character of that class. The character and playstyle of a class will usually become quite clear over the first 10 or 15 levels; spending a short while playing a class will usually give you a fair idea of whether you want to continue with it. Remember you can always leave or delete a character if that class turns out to be not for you, or if you change your mind about your character's name or race. Do remember though that classes develop significantly on their way to max level: there's really no way to know what it's like to play a class at max level until you get there! Also, unless you need to delete a character for a specific reason, it's better to simply leave them be: some day you might decide to try that class again, and save yourself a lot of trouble!\nAlso, remember that you can roll a character of any and every class. There's really no need to choose a single class; many players have one or more characters of each class. Whatever class you choose, you can always choose to leave that character for a while and start a new one: you can come back to it later or just keep trying new classes until you find one you really enjoy! Many players roll multiple characters, and switch frequently between them as they level, while others will find a single class they love and play it to the exclusion of all others.\nClass and race.\nChoice of class is limited by choice of &lt;a href=\"race\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt;, with certain classes only available to certain races.\nClass roles.\nThere are three main &lt;a href=\"role\"&gt;role&lt;/a&gt;s in group play: &lt;a href=\"tank\"&gt;tank&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"healer\"&gt;healer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"damage%20dealer\"&gt;damage dealer&lt;/a&gt; (DPS). &lt;a href=\"Tank\"&gt;Tank&lt;/a&gt;s protect their allies by absorbing damage and drawing enemies' attacks toward themselves; &lt;a href=\"healer\"&gt;healer&lt;/a&gt;s keep their allies alive by healing their wounds and protecting them from harm; &lt;a href=\"damage%20dealer\"&gt;damage dealer&lt;/a&gt;s (DPS) focus on the critical task of dealing damage to the party's foes. Role is largely determined by &lt;a href=\"specialization\"&gt;specialization&lt;/a&gt;, with each specialization designed to perform a specific role. The tank role is almost entirely limited to &lt;a href=\"PvE\"&gt;PvE&lt;/a&gt; encounters, with healers more common in &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt;.\nEach class has different capabilities in terms of which roles they can fulfill, and if you have strong ideas about which role or roles you'd like to play, it can be a good idea to choose a class that can perform that role.\nPure or hybrid class.\nIn choosing a class one has to determine if they want to be able to fulfill one or more &lt;a href=\"role\"&gt;role&lt;/a&gt;s for their character. Pure classes are only able to fulfill one role and that is always a &lt;a href=\"damage%20%28role%29\"&gt;DPS&lt;/a&gt; role. Those classes are &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s. All other classes are hybrid classes and can perform either 2 roles or all 3 roles of DPS, tank, or healer.\nThe hybrid classes are classes which are able to fill different roles in the game. The hybrid classes are &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"monk\"&gt;monk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"demon%20hunter\"&gt;demon hunter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;. Monks, paladins and druids are able to fulfil any of the roles - dealing damage, tanking or healing - while shamans are good at dealing damage (caster or melee) or healing. Death knights, demon hunters and warriors are able to deal melee damage or tank, while priests are good at healing (with two healing specs) or casting damaging spells. \nPure and 2-role classes tend to be the simplest for new players to get to grips with. They have only one purpose - to defeat their enemies. These classes usually have few healing and taunting options, with all of their abilities focused on direct engagement with the enemy. In contrast, 'true' hybrid classes (those capable of performing all three roles) have all the types of abilities that a pure class has, as well as abilities for healing and tanking. This adds a lot of versatility to these classes, but can make it harder to decide how to handle encounters. Do you charge straight in with melee attacks, or stand back and smite them with spells? Do you assume a defensive posture in order to survive their blows, or focus on dealing damage as quickly as possible? Do you conserve mana to use for healing yourself, or use your mana to quickly defeat the enemy before they have the chance to harm you? These options can make hybrid classes less straightforward when first learning the class.\nOn the other hand, some players prefer hybrid classes for precisely this reason. While all classes will find each of their specializations to offer a different style of play, hybrid classes can switch role entirely. Get sick of DPS at level 40 and want to try healing instead? Tired of healing and want to try out tanking? Simply switch spec and you can! Levelling a hybrid class means you'll have at least two different roles to explore. Some also claim that levelling hybrid classes with healing abilities requires less downtime, due to their ability to heal themselves between fights.\nTank.\nThe &lt;a href=\"tank\"&gt;tank's&lt;/a&gt; job is to take all the damage for the group. They are often the first ones in and the last ones out in a fight. They must stand proud, keeping all the monsters' attention (&lt;a href=\"threat\"&gt;threat&lt;/a&gt;) while their party members deal the damage and kill the monsters. They usually make up the smallest percentage of players. Classes that can become tanks are &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"monk\"&gt;monk&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"paladins\"&gt;paladins&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"warriors\"&gt;warriors&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s. The tanking role is for the most part limited to &lt;a href=\"PvE\"&gt;PvE&lt;/a&gt;, although tanks can be effective in &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"capture%20the%20flag\"&gt;capture the flag&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"battleground\"&gt;battleground&lt;/a&gt;s.\nTanks are vital members of any group or raid as they have to pull the enemies' attention to themselves, so as to not let the DPS or healers get harmed. This is achieved through dealing damage, using special abilities called &lt;a href=\"taunt\"&gt;taunt&lt;/a&gt;s, and generally earning the hatred of the enemies. If mobs begin to attack other players, it is the tank's responsibility to 'pull' them back to the tank. For this reason, tanks can expect to take the vast majority of all damage in any fight. Tanks therefore have extremely large health pools and high damage mitigation which they need to be able to withstand bosses' attacks. Tanks deal less damage than DPS, trading their damage output for survivability.\nTanks are usually expected to lead the group through the dungeon or raid. This means that tanks have to research bosses beforehand to learn all the bosses' special attacks and strategies to take them down. Tanks need to know the &lt;a href=\"boss\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt; through and through as they are the ones who will be taking most of the bosses' damage, and are often expected to teach other members things to note about the boss.\nAll in all, being a tank is a big responsibility as their death usually means the end of the fight and a wipe for the party. A healer can tell if a tank's damage mitigation is good or bad while a DPS can tell if tanks pull threat well or not. A tank who fails to pull enough aggro will lead to other players getting attacked, while a tank who cannot withstand the incoming damage will quickly perish in the face of the enemy, or drain the healer's mana until the whole group is left without healing. A good tank holds enough aggro for the DPS to deal their damage, and handles damage well enough for the healer to keep them and the rest of the party alive.\nAnyone looking to be a tank must be generally patient, have good leadership and also able to learn from their mistakes fast. If a tank dies or makes a serious mistake, the whole group will usually die. New tanks will experience a lot of criticism and need to learn from what they are doing wrong. Once they become proficient at how to tank, tanking will become the easiest role to play.\nHealer.\nThe &lt;a href=\"healer\"&gt;healer's&lt;/a&gt; job is to keep everyone alive. In &lt;a href=\"PvE\"&gt;PvE&lt;/a&gt; this primarily means focusing on the &lt;a href=\"tank\"&gt;tank&lt;/a&gt;, while in &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt; healers need to switch rapidly between targets. Healers support the group through the use of healing spells and abilities, and also tend to be responsible for removing harmful debuffs. Healers are the least common class role after tanks. The classes that can become healers are &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"monk\"&gt;monk&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;s. \nHealers keep the group alive through anticipating incoming damage, and need to be aware of the health of multiple targets at all times, and respond quickly whenever their abilities are needed. Healers typically spend their time watching the health bars of the other group members, while keeping aware of the boss in order to anticipate their special abilities. \nHealers use a range of healing and damage mitigation spells, including direct heals such as &lt;a href=\"Flash%20Heal\"&gt;Flash Heal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"heal%20over%20time\"&gt;heal over time&lt;/a&gt; (HoT) effects such as &lt;a href=\"Rejuvenation\"&gt;Rejuvenation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"area%20of%20effect\"&gt;area of effect&lt;/a&gt; and multiple-target heals such as &lt;a href=\"Chain%20Heal\"&gt;Chain Heal&lt;/a&gt;, damage reduction abilities such as &lt;a href=\"Pain%20Suppression\"&gt;Pain Suppression&lt;/a&gt;, and protective abilities such as . Healers also tend to have several direct healing options, ranging from very fast but extremely inefficient, to very efficient but extremely slow. Knowing when to use the right type of healing spell is critical to being a healer.\nUnlike other roles, the prime challenge of a healer is usually not that of simple capability, but one of efficiency and longevity. Most well-geared healers are capable of healing targets through the heaviest of onslaughts, but doing so without rapidly depleting their limited &lt;a href=\"mana\"&gt;mana&lt;/a&gt; reserves requires forethought, anticipation and a thorough knowledge of their skills and cooldowns. Healers who simply use their fastest and most powerful heals will quickly find themselves out of mana, powerless to aid themselves or their allies. Healers must therefore strike a fine balance between speed and efficiency, often risking the lives of their charges in order to ensure their mana will last the fight.\nIn the heat of battle, healers also have the unenviable responsibility of triage, making split-second decisions as to who will live, and who must die. It is often not possible to save every target, and there are times when even the best healer must allow one of their charges to perish, in order to save the others. Tanks in poor gear may blame the healer for not keeping them alive, and DPS may refuse to &lt;a href=\"stay%20out%20of%20the%20fire\"&gt;stay out of the fire&lt;/a&gt;, and blame the healer for their deaths. Healers are rarely thanked for their efforts, and when everything goes wrong, the healer may be held responsible for not miraculously saving the group. However, experienced players know the difference between their own mistakes and those of the healer, and anyone who has served in the role knows the challenges of healing a tough encounter. A healer must know their limits, and that they cannot single-handedly keep their allies alive if they do not watch out for their own survival.\nHealing requires quick reflexes and constant vigilance for that spike of damage that can suddenly wipe out the party. In exchange, the healing role offers great satisfaction for those who enjoy helping and supporting others, managing and watching over the group, and knowing that their skill, focus and anticipation have single-handedly kept the group alive through all that has been thrown at it. Those who enjoy healing tend to enjoy keeping multiple plates spinning at the same time, multi-tasking and managing a number of shifting priorities while responding to unpredictable events with calm determination and a cool head. Healing is the one role which doesn't address the character's enemies, but rather their allies. For this reason, the satisfaction of playing a healer can be a bit more internal than the obvious glory of personally killing the big monster - the healer gets to sit back and know that they were indispensable in making the group's success possible.\nBeing a healer is quite possibly the most stressful and most under-appreciated role of all. Nonetheless, it offers a unique challenge. A good healer is capable of turning around any encounter, creating an indomitable team of adventurers who can take on anything. As the person most directly responsible for their team's survival, a skilled healer can single-handedly save their party, their quick-thinking and mastery of their abilities sweeping their group from humiliating defeat to jubilant triumph. A good healer may stand in the shadows, but they alone are capable of raising their team into the glorious light of victory.\nFor more information, see &lt;a href=\"Healer\"&gt;Healer&lt;/a&gt;.\nDamage dealer.\nThe role of &lt;a href=\"damage%20%28role%29\"&gt;damage dealer&lt;/a&gt; (commonly referred to as &lt;a href=\"Damage%20%28role%29\"&gt;DPS&lt;/a&gt;) is perhaps the most obvious of all: they focus on dealing damage to the party's targets. While the tank holds the attention of the enemy and healers keep everyone alive, it is up to the DPS to actually deal the damage which will result in victory for the party. Every class is capable of performing the DPS role, using the right specialization.\nCompared to players in other roles and specs, DPS can deal damage very quickly and sustainably. However, good DPS must learn not only how to deal damage, but how to do so without drawing the fire of the target; dealing too much damage too quickly may lead the target to turn its wrath upon the DPS, leading to a stressed tank, a mana-drained healer, or simply a dead DPS. Most DPS specs have aggro control abilities which can help with this, but must still take care not to exceed the &lt;a href=\"tank\"&gt;tank&lt;/a&gt;'s capabilities for holding &lt;a href=\"aggro\"&gt;aggro&lt;/a&gt;. DPS often have additional responsibilities within the group, such as &lt;a href=\"interrupt%20effect\"&gt;interrupting&lt;/a&gt; critical abilities and applying &lt;a href=\"crowd%20control\"&gt;crowd control&lt;/a&gt;, and may also be called upon to assist with healing or &lt;a href=\"off-tank\"&gt;off-tank&lt;/a&gt;ing. \nDPS tends to be the most numerous role in any group, with at least half of the group typically being DPS, and is usually also the least critically responsible. A tank who fails to taunt quickly enough, or a healer who fails to notice a target taking damage can quickly lead to the death of members of the group; the DPS usually have a greater degree of latitude in performing their role. \nHowever, the DPS must still pay close attention to the fight; not only are they often responsible for critical interrupts and other situational elements, but should the DPS fail to deal sufficient damage in a period of time, the group will usually wipe, whether because of a boss's &lt;a href=\"enrage\"&gt;enrage&lt;/a&gt; timer or the healers simply running out of mana. It is therefore the responsibility of the DPS to deal damage quickly enough for the group to triumph.\nThe DPS role is available to characters of all specs, and these specs are often chosen for use while levelling, since they deal damage more quickly than the others. DPS is by far the best way to begin experiencing group play. Its limited responsibility allows players to find their feet before taking on a more critical role, and the basic experience gained in this way is vital for performing either of the other roles.\nFor more information, see &lt;a href=\"Damage%20%28role%29\"&gt;DPS&lt;/a&gt;.\nMelee and ranged.\nIn addition to the three basic roles, characters tend to be considered a melee or ranged type. This mainly refers the distance at which the spec is able to operate, but also reflects certain strengths and weaknesses. Most specs are one type of play or the other, while some such as monks mix the types by combining melee and ranged abilities.\nBrief overview of classes.\nEach class in \"World of Warcraft\" is played in a distinct manner in many ways from the other classes available (and there are often considerable variations even within the same class), but certain broad generalizations about play styles can be made. See the following sections for a more complete description of each class.\nClasses.\nDeath knight.\nThe &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt; is a plate-wearing melee class and \"World of Warcraft\"'s first hero class. Compounding the survivability of the &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;, the raw frontal damage of a &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt;, and the damage over time that would make a &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; proud, they are a force to be reckoned with.\nIn PvE play, a death knight can be used as a tank, like the paladin and warrior. Unlike these classes, however, the a death knight \"cannot\" use shields. While this dramatically hampers their apparent defensive ability, they have three presences to choose from that function almost exactly like a warrior's stances. Blood Presence increases the death knight's stamina a considerable amount, improves his armor by a whopping 60%, and greatly augments his threat generation. This last part is one of the most important aspect of death knight tanking: they do not have the reactive threat a paladin specializes in, and also don't have the wide array of high threat skills a warrior can use. They are forced to generate threat through sheer damage (something death knights are very, very good at).\nDeath knights are among the best solo-playable classes available, second only to hunters and warlocks. This is especially true for Blood-Specced knights, who have a very prominent life-stealing/regenerating theme as well as high damage output. Death knights are capable of tremendous damage mitigation, combining Blood Presence with numerous mitigation talents. Unholy knights have the Ghoul, which through focusing on Unholy becomes their own minion-type ally that follows them wherever they go. They also have numerous Area of Effect damage abilities through certain talents, and are excellent at defeating many enemies in a hurry.\nBlood death knights regenerate life almost as fast as they lose it in combat, making them monstrously efficient, and have skills like Rune Tap and Vampiric Blood, as well as fast runic power generation, but (curiously) no real runic power dump besides Dancing Rune Weapon. Frost knights focus on keeping the flow of battle under control with the vicious &lt;a href=\"Howling%20Blast\"&gt;Howling Blast&lt;/a&gt;. Unholy emphasises diseases more than the other trees, as well as containing a very powerful utility skill in Anti-Magic Zone, along with a Ghoul pet and serious Runic Power dumps such as Gargoyle and an improved Death Coil. All of the trees provide speedy, efficient kills, little downtime, and a very active and energetic experience.\nIf you prefer a quick and active combat style with durability, power, and a wide variety of ways to defeat your victims enemies, and the aesthetics of being a fallen hero turned walking engine of ruinous power, the Death Knight may be a perfect fit.\nDruid.\n&lt;a href=\"Druid\"&gt;Druid&lt;/a&gt;s are a shapeshifting &lt;a href=\"Hybrid\"&gt;Hybrid&lt;/a&gt; class. Unlike other hybrid classes, Druids do not fulfill several roles at once (e.g., both healing and melee at the same time), but can choose which role to take by shifting into one of their forms.\nIn their normal form, they are healers and casters, with a wide array of heal over time spells and some offensive spells. In &lt;a href=\"Bear%20Form\"&gt;Bear Form&lt;/a&gt;, they gain considerable toughness and a Rage bar, allowing them to act as a tank. The &lt;a href=\"Cat%20Form\"&gt;Cat Form&lt;/a&gt; gives them an Energy bar and Rogue-like abilities for a high damage output, while their &lt;a href=\"Moonkin%20Form\"&gt;Moonkin Form&lt;/a&gt; (balance talent) allows them to gain extra armor equal to plate, give their group a spell crit aura, and cast potent damage spells on par with a Mage. They also have 3 travel forms: &lt;a href=\"Travel%20Form\"&gt;Travel Form&lt;/a&gt; for land, &lt;a href=\"Seal\"&gt;Aquatic Form&lt;/a&gt; for Water, and &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Crow\"&gt;Flight Form&lt;/a&gt; for air, which dramatically increases their speed, and therefore often survival. \nThe Druid gains more from stats than any other class (e.g. 20 Agility = %1 Critical hit &amp; 1% Dodge, etc.). This allows them to be moderately sufficient in all roles. If a Druid concentrates all of their equipment to suit one of the Druid branches and uses the correct talents, they can be as efficient as any class for a given role. While Druids can only wear &lt;a href=\"Leather%20armor\"&gt;Leather armor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cloth%20armor\"&gt;Cloth armor&lt;/a&gt;, this is offset by their Bear, Moonkin, and tree forms, which increase their armor by a large percentage (180% (Bear), 200% (improved tree), or 370% (Moonkin and Dire Bear) increase on top of base armor); this makes high-level Druids with the right gear the class with the highest armor in the game. Druids are also the only class to have a resurrection spell which may be used in combat, &lt;a href=\"Rebirth\"&gt;Rebirth&lt;/a&gt;. However, unlike the other resurrection spells, it can only be used fairly infrequently (5 minute cooldown) as a trade-off to its combat-usability. This, in addition to their heals, tanking and &lt;a href=\"Innervate\"&gt;Innervate&lt;/a&gt;, makes a well-played Druid able to save a group from what would otherwise be a guaranteed wipe.\nIn end-game raiding, Druids historically were expected to heal. This has been changed with the talent change in 2.0 and increased gear supporting the Feral talent tree. Nowadays feral Druids can spend their talent points in such a way that they can be both a melee-damage-dealer (Rogue-type) in cat form and a tank in bear form. No other class offers that much versatility (DPS and tanking in one single talent build), though the two roles require two different sets of gear. Beyond that, Druids can still specialize to become a healer or a DPS caster.\nIf you enjoy fulfilling multiple roles, the Druid class might be for you.\nHunter.\nThe &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt; is the only class in the game that can deal effective damage with bows, crossbows, and guns. These are available to other classes, but only do token damage and are chiefly used for ranged &lt;a href=\"pulling\"&gt;pulling&lt;/a&gt;, while they are the Hunter's main weapons. A Hunter's &lt;a href=\"DPS\"&gt;DPS&lt;/a&gt; and ranged attack rating scale as they increase in level, much like a Warrior's attack power scales with melee weapons. In addition, Hunters gain many special abilities with ranged weapons that either cause extra damage or help control the enemy in some way (slowing, stunning, increased miss chance, etc.). \nBy contrast, hunters do not gain significant attack abilities with melee weapons. While certainly more deadly in melee combat than most spellcasters, the Hunter will be outmatched in a serious swordfight (or axefight, fisticuffs, etc.). Close-range combat is not a strength for Hunters and is avoided as much as possible. Before patch &lt;a href=\"2.3\"&gt;2.3&lt;/a&gt; there was a minimum range for the use of ranged weapons referred to as the \"dead zone\". This referred to an area that lay just beyond melee range and just before ranged attack range where the hunter was unable to attack. It was often exploited in PvP combat and has since been removed.\nThe Hunter is able to tame many animals from the wild and use them as pets, a central aspect of the class. They are the only class allowed to name their pets, but note that names are semi-permanent and need not be assigned right away, so choose carefully (to change a pet's name, you will need a ).\nThe Hunter class is the most well adapted class for solo play, and is often considered to be the easiest and fastest leveling class. In solo play, the Hunter will send the pet to engage the enemy and shoot the enemy from a distance during the fight. Keeping the enemy focused on the pet, rather than running back to the hunter, is a balancing act Hunters must master to play effectively. Hunters can keep pets throughout the life of the character if desired; pets level with the Hunter and can be trained in new abilities as the Hunter learns them. Specializing in &lt;a href=\"Exotic%20Beasts\"&gt;Exotic Beasts&lt;/a&gt; can ultimately give the pet considerable destructive power.\nHunters also have the ability to lay &lt;a href=\"hunter%20trap\"&gt;trap&lt;/a&gt;s, which can either damage or &lt;a href=\"crowd%20control\"&gt;crowd control&lt;/a&gt; the target. Hunters are often expected to use their freezing trap in group situations to help with &lt;a href=\"crowd%20control\"&gt;crowd control&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn groups, Hunters are usually considered damage dealers, using their normal \"modus operandi\" to hit the target (pet engages, hunter shoots). In instances, the skilled Hunter can often be very useful at &lt;a href=\"pulling\"&gt;pulling&lt;/a&gt;, as the Hunter has the ability to cancel the encounter using the &lt;a href=\"Feign%20Death\"&gt;Feign Death&lt;/a&gt; ability, presuming it is not resisted and the group is far enough away. It should be noted however that Hunters must be practiced at controlling their pets in instances for reasons of &lt;a href=\"aggro\"&gt;aggro&lt;/a&gt; control, knowing when and how to keep the pet restrained so as not to interfere with other group members' duties.\nIn PvP, Hunters have traditionally specialized in ranged damage (&lt;a href=\"Marksmanship\"&gt;Marksmanship&lt;/a&gt;) and traps (&lt;a href=\"Survival\"&gt;Survival&lt;/a&gt;), but this has been turned around thanks to the changes made to the talent trees and pet skills in \"Wrath of the Lich King\". &lt;a href=\"Beast%20Master\"&gt;Beast Master&lt;/a&gt; tends to be a caster-killer build, thanks to all the pet damage boosts. Survival is more of a heavy-armor killer, since the powerful and dangerous &lt;a href=\"Explosive%20Shot\"&gt;Explosive Shot&lt;/a&gt; deals pure fire damage and ignores armor. Marksmanship is the middle ground, but still dangerous thanks to &lt;a href=\"Silencing%20Shot\"&gt;Silencing Shot&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chimera%20Shot\"&gt;Chimera Shot&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf you think you would enjoy controlling a pet, using crowd control, generating high powered burst damage, and tackling difficult encounters by yourself, the Hunter may be a great choice.\nMage.\nThe &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; is the archetypal ranged DPS spell-caster. Mages arguably cause the most straightforward damage in the game, and have the biggest arsenal of &lt;a href=\"instant%20cast\"&gt;instant cast&lt;/a&gt; offensive spells of all the ranged classes, allowing them to inflict great &lt;a href=\"burst%20damage\"&gt;burst damage&lt;/a&gt; when combined with long-casting spells.\nMages are famous for their &lt;a href=\"area%20of%20effect\"&gt;area of effect&lt;/a&gt; spells (AoE), such as &lt;a href=\"Blizzard\"&gt;Blizzard&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Explosion\"&gt;Arcane Explosion&lt;/a&gt;, that cause damage to all enemies in a given area simultaneously. When used improperly, this will result in a small army assaulting the mage directly and the mage's sudden death. When used judiciously, however, AoE spells shorten fights, save group members' lives, and make certain encounters easy that might otherwise be very tough.\nMages have other useful abilities besides their destructive spells. They have a quite useful crowd-control spell called &lt;a href=\"Polymorph\"&gt;Polymorph&lt;/a&gt; which temporarily turns an enemy into a sheep, pig, turtle, or even a penguin. This comes in very handy when facing multiple opponents, and in PvP also provides comic relief. Mages are also popular for their ability to open &lt;a href=\"Portal%20%28spell%29\"&gt;Portal&lt;/a&gt;s for their party to use to travel to a capital city (Orgrimmar, Ironforge, etc.), and their ability to conjure &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"food\"&gt;food&lt;/a&gt; for faster regeneration of mana and health between fights. \nMages have particular weaknesses that offset their strengths. Their greatest weakness is that they are limited to &lt;a href=\"cloth%20armor\"&gt;cloth armor&lt;/a&gt; and cannot long survive melee combat, which they should avoid more than any other class. Their other chief weakness is their total reliance on mana, which limits the sustainability of their damage. Mages cannot do significant damage with melee or ranged weapons, so if they run out of mana they are relatively powerless (Wands might be useful for pumping out more damage while waiting for Mana to regenerate, but their DPS is pathetic compared to nearly all other weapons of the same level). As a result, Mages can be considered, in terms of play style, unforgiving with mistakes. Timing and awareness play a huge part in survival. In fact, while the Warlock and the Hunter are considered by some to be overpowered, the Mage is hardly mentioned, due to the Mage having among the lowest survivability in the game.\nIn PvE groups, the Mage should never engage the enemy immediately; instead they should allow the &lt;a href=\"tank\"&gt;tank&lt;/a&gt; and other classes to wear the enemy down and build up sufficient &lt;a href=\"threat\"&gt;threat&lt;/a&gt;. Once the enemy is suitably focused on the tank, the Mage will unleash a torrent of damage that quickly ends the fight. Knowing when to start attacking and how much damage to do is one of the main skills a Mage must master.\nIn solo play and in PvP, the Mage relies on spells that slow or freeze the enemy in place so it cannot approach within melee range. They have several escape abilities (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Blink\"&gt;Blink&lt;/a&gt;) that can help if they are losing a fight. \nIf high-powered ranged combat and mass carnage suit your tastes, the Mage is a good choice.\nMonk.\n&lt;a href=\"Monk\"&gt;Monk&lt;/a&gt;s are the newest class in \"World of Warcraft\", and this shows in their design. Set apart from the other classes, monks have a unique combat system, combining &lt;a href=\"energy\"&gt;energy&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"mana\"&gt;mana&lt;/a&gt; with the combo point-like &lt;a href=\"chi\"&gt;chi&lt;/a&gt;, and a range of &lt;a href=\"monk%20stance\"&gt;stances&lt;/a&gt; to define their current role. Students of ancient &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; martial arts techniques, monks embody the skill, focus, meditativeness and deadly effectiveness of a skilled Kung Fu master, battering enemies with a flurry of punches or flying kicks, incapacitating enemies with an intimate knowledge of nerve centers and acupressure points, and using their inner calm and connection to the universe to heal and restore balance to their allies. \nA true hybrid class, monks can perform a melee DPS, tank or healing role, and similar to paladins tend to provide a little healing in any spec. However, unlike paladins, these students of enlightenment wear only light armor, and can roll or spin out of harm's way, dodging blows and disarming foes. Monks have a number of hybrid abilities that combine damage and healing, and also make use of stationary statues and a range of herbal brews to empower their abilities. \nMonks are a uniquely mobile class, and are affected by their physical location more than other classes. They can generate Health and Chi Spheres, special objects which must be passed into in order to gain their benefits. This creates a mobile battlefield, with monks quickly rolling and soaring across the arena to restore health before leaping back into the fray. All monks are melee types - even the healers - and need to be up close to make the most of their abilities.\nBrewmaster monks are perhaps the most unusual tanks in the game. With a stumbling gait easily confused for simple intoxication, these mighty tanks utilize the style of the drunken master to absorb and stagger damage, while relying on potent brews to restore their vitality. Devoted masters of ale, these curious but undeniably effective defenders hurl kegs of brew at their enemies, setting them alight with their &lt;a href=\"Breath%20of%20Fire\"&gt;flaming breath&lt;/a&gt;, and use &lt;a href=\"Purifying%20Brew\"&gt;purifying concoctions&lt;/a&gt; to wash away harm. Evading their assailants' blows apparently by accident, these elusive brawlers sway and stagger across the arena, &lt;a href=\"Provoke\"&gt;provoking&lt;/a&gt; their attackers with drunken taunts. Brewmaster monks do not use shields, preferring to leave both hands free for drinking. And for swiping at enemies, of course.\nMistweavers are also unusual, combining the healing power of their mastery of chi with skilful strikes to generate healing for their allies. Using &lt;a href=\"mana\"&gt;mana&lt;/a&gt; instead of the other specs' &lt;a href=\"energy\"&gt;energy&lt;/a&gt;, Mistweavers can channel their chi to envelop allies in a protective bubble, or retreat into a deep meditation to redirect their allies' damage toward themselves. Steadily restoring targets using a variety of surging, soothing and renewing mists, Mistweavers gently uplift groups and detoxify them of harmful effects. Like Discipline priests, Mistweavers can also derive healing from dealing damage, and are often to be found in the thick of battle, rather than standing on the sidelines.\nWindwalkers are the classic martial artists, melee DPS who eschew weapons to pummel foes with fist and foot. With lightning reflexes these indefatigable fighters leap and roll across the battlefield, using their martial prowess to overpower opponents with a combination of speed and deadly accuracy. Similar in some ways to rogues, these agile fighters conserve their chi to build to devastating special moves, stunning targets with &lt;a href=\"Blackout%20Kick\"&gt;Blackout Kick&lt;/a&gt;s and pummeling foes with their &lt;a href=\"Fists%20of%20Fury\"&gt;Fists of Fury&lt;/a&gt;.\nAside from combat, monks also enjoy some interesting abilities like &lt;a href=\"Zen%20Pilgrimage\"&gt;Zen Pilgrimage&lt;/a&gt;, and a daily quest to train with the monks at the &lt;a href=\"Peak%20of%20Serenity\"&gt;Peak of Serenity&lt;/a&gt;, slowly teaching the player how to engage in more advanced battle tactics, as well as serving to accelerate their rate of &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; gain.\nIf you're looking for a different class which features some rapid melee action, the monk might be for you. The Brewmaster with its Staggered damage offers a slightly different type of tanking experience, while the Windwalker presents a classic martial arts style of play, and the Mistweaver offers a refreshingly hands-on approach to healing. If you like the idea of hidden pressure points, flying kicks and fists of fury, it might be worth your time trying a monk.\nPaladin.\n&lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt;s are plate-wearing holy knights. With the soul of a priest and the brawn of a warrior, paladins combine Holy magic with powerful weapons and stout armor. Like the knights of legend, paladins fight the good fight, smiting enemies with divine wrath and bringing allies back from the brink of death with the power of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;. A true hybrid class, paladins can fulfil any role, and can usually do a little of all three, thanks to their combination of damaging, healing and protective abilities.\nPaladins are especially well-known for their supreme survivability. Abilities like &lt;a href=\"Hand%20of%20Protection\"&gt;Hand of Protection&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Shield\"&gt;Divine Shield&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lay%20on%20Hands\"&gt;Lay on Hands&lt;/a&gt; enable them to render a player all but invulnerable at any time, or instantly heal them back up to full health just when defeat seems inevitable. In PvP, this can make paladins one of the most frustrating classes to play against, with groups of players sometimes joining forces to try to bring a Protection paladin down.\nPaladins are also well-known for their range of buffs and support spells, and are arguably the strongest support class in the game. Paladins can grant a number of different &lt;a href=\"hand%20%28spell%29\"&gt;hand&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"blessing\"&gt;blessing&lt;/a&gt;s to fit any occasion, and use a range of &lt;a href=\"seal\"&gt;seal&lt;/a&gt;s to grant them specific benefits each time they attack. Paladins tend to combine self-heals with damage dealing, effortlessly maintaing their health bar while focusing on bringing their targets down. Paladins execute their abilities through a combination of &lt;a href=\"mana\"&gt;mana&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Power\"&gt;Holy Power&lt;/a&gt;, a kind of combo point system which allows them to build to a powerful burst of healing or damage.\nHoly paladins are dedicated healers. Specializing in single-target healing, Holy paladins also have some damage absorption effects and multi-target heals. More heavily armored than any other healing spec, Holy paladins can take a hit or two and can also dish out some respectable Holy damage.\nProtection paladins are well-respected tanks. Their substantial &lt;a href=\"AoE\"&gt;AoE&lt;/a&gt; damage and multi-target attacks allow them to effortlessly hold the attention of a crowd of mobs, and sometimes to single-handedly defeat them, too. Protection paladins draw great strength from being attacked, and are at their best when surrounded by enemies. \nRetribution paladins rely on melee combat supplemented by magic buffs. With a fighting style that mirrors that of a &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;, the paladin uses similar types of skills to deal both physical and &lt;a href=\"Magic%20schools%23Holy\"&gt;Holy&lt;/a&gt; damage to their opponents. When geared properly, a Retribution paladin is a very durable and damaging melee fighter and is deceptively powerful in all types of play.\nThe paladin is a true hybrid class, with all three specs capable of respectable healing, as well as providing their allies with a range of buffs, and enjoying an incomparable level of survivability. With a combination of Holy magic and good old fashioned combat, if you want to be a holy knight slaying your enemies and protecting and healing your allies, the paladin is the class for you.\nPriest.\nDevout followers of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s are a cloth-wearing caster class. Traditionally masters of healing, the priest's knowledge of the Light also grants them control of the darker powers of the Shadow. Discipline and Holy priests are powerful &lt;a href=\"healer%20%28role%29\"&gt;healers&lt;/a&gt;, while Shadow priests are potent damage-dealers comparable to Affliction warlocks. However, whether blasting their enemies with Holy Light or sinister &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Word\"&gt;Shadow Word&lt;/a&gt;s, all priests combine some of each school, and are capable of performing beyond their main role.\nDiscipline priests specialise in damage mitigation, using a range of powerful shields to magically protect their charges. Excelling at single-target healing, Discipline priests can keep a single target alive for a long time, thanks to spells like and a solid range of healing options. Discipline priests can also heal through dealing damage, using their attacks to take care of their allies' needs during quiet periods or gaps in their rotation. Disc is a great and strong spec to play, with its protective abilities granting breathing room in PvP, and its healing/damage-dealing combination adding fun to PvE encounters.\nHoly priests are the archetypal pure healer. They have an extensive range of healing options for all situations, exchanging the Discipline priest's anticipatory damage absorption effects for good old fashioned healing power. Holy priests use a combination of direct heals, &lt;a href=\"heal%20over%20time\"&gt;heal over time&lt;/a&gt; (HoT) effects, and &lt;a href=\"AoE\"&gt;AoE&lt;/a&gt; and multi-target heals to respond to any situation. They also possess some unique abilities like &lt;a href=\"Lightwell\"&gt;Lightwell&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20Spirit\"&gt;Guardian Spirit&lt;/a&gt;. Holy priests are far more vulnerable in PvP than the other specs, but are excellent at keeping groups of players alive thanks to their healing versatility. Holy focuses on healing even more than Discipline, boasting sheer healing output which is hard to beat.\nShadow priests represent an entirely different approach to the class. These masters of darkness apply &lt;a href=\"damage%20over%20time\"&gt;damage over time&lt;/a&gt; (DoT) effects to their enemies and slowly drain the life from them with &lt;a href=\"Mind%20Flay\"&gt;Mind Flay&lt;/a&gt;. Shadow priests offer some similar gameplay to Affliction warlocks, keeping a number of DoTs active on targets at all times while filling the rotation with lighter attacks and bonus procs. However, the Shadow priest lacks the complexity of the Affliction warlock's range of options, having a much simpler and tighter rotation. Capable of dealing good burst damage, the Shadow priest really shines when they can place DoTs on multiple targets, dealing massive amounts of damage without lifting a finger. \nThe telltale sign of a Shadow priest is &lt;a href=\"Shadowform\"&gt;Shadowform&lt;/a&gt;, an altered state that renders the priest a dark shadow of themselves, and improves their play as a DPS. The one limitation to this is that it prevents the priest from casting most healing spells. However, the priest is still capable of dropping briefly out of Shadowform to heal themselves or their allies, providing extra utility and survivability when needed. Shadow priests can also provide a good amount of group healing through &lt;a href=\"Vampiric%20Embrace\"&gt;Vampiric Embrace&lt;/a&gt; and hybrid damage/healing abilities available to all priests. However, a Shadow priest cannot be relied upon to maintain healing, as their mana pool will rapidly run dry.\nWhen levelling, many priests choose the Shadow spec, since it deals damage far more quickly than the other specs. However, the healing specs are quite capable of facing mobs alone, and benefit from far greater survivability than the DPS-oriented Shadow spec. Both specs are capable of switching quickly from healing to damage when the situation demands it, with Disc generating healing all the while. This versatility allows priests of any spec to bring a little extra support when it's needed, and to experiment with their preferred playstyle. For example, a Shadow priest might choose focus entirely on DPS while their allies die, or may take a sideline in support, yanking friends out of the fire with &lt;a href=\"Leap%20of%20Faith\"&gt;Leap of Faith&lt;/a&gt; and throwing out a quick for a beleaguered tank, or even going all-in as a temporary healer to save the day when the main healer dies.\nAnother string to the priest's bow is their range of dispel abilities. Powerful abilities like &lt;a href=\"Dispel%20Magic\"&gt;Dispel Magic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mass%20Dispel\"&gt;Mass Dispel&lt;/a&gt; make priests some of the most powerful dispellers in the game, with Disc and Holy priests excelling in this role. They also have some fun spells like &lt;a href=\"Levitate\"&gt;Levitate&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mind%20Control\"&gt;Mind Control&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mind%20Vision\"&gt;Mind Vision&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe main weakness to the priest class is their cloth armor, making them very weak to melee attacks. Priests have abilities like &lt;a href=\"Psychic%20Scream\"&gt;Psychic Scream&lt;/a&gt; for when things get out of hand, but need to stand back from the fray if they wish to show their true potential, and are more dependent on help from other players than some classes. In PvP this can make lower-level play more challenging, as their armor offers little protections from attackers, and stout protectors may be hard to come by until higher levels. Even at higher levels, it often pays to stay out of sight, or at least to try to avoid drawing the attention of several enemies at once, since the priest's armor offers limited protection to heavy attacks. However, when they are able to focus on applying their talents, priests have some of the most impressive outputs for their roles. \nOverall, the priest is a great class with room for a variety of playstyles. If you enjoy healing and supporting others, keeping a target (or several) alive through thick and thin, and being the supporting backbone of the team, Disc and Holy offer a great and powerful healing experience. If you like being a sinister shadow master, destroying targets with a suffocating mass of dark plagues and mental torments, keeping a steady wall of DoTs chipping away at targets' health, and steadily draining your enemy's life while they stand powerless to oppose you - you might enjoy playing a Shadow priest. \nRogue.\nSinister masters of the night, &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt;s are a lightly-armored class which uses &lt;a href=\"Stealth\"&gt;Stealth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"poison\"&gt;poison&lt;/a&gt;s and sharp blades to dispatch enemies without a sound. Focusing exclusively on DPS, the rogue represents a counterpoint to the warrior's brash guts and glory approach to battle, preferring to strike from the shadows and &lt;a href=\"Vanish\"&gt;Vanish&lt;/a&gt; without a sound, their only code of honor the contract on their target's life. Valuing dexterity over muscle, rogues wear leather armor that leaves them free to move swiftly through the night, and usually wield light weapons in each hand. \nRogues rely on their rapidly-regenerating pool of &lt;a href=\"energy\"&gt;energy&lt;/a&gt; to deal damage, granting &lt;a href=\"combo%20points\"&gt;combo points&lt;/a&gt; to build toward devastating &lt;a href=\"finishing%20move\"&gt;finishing move&lt;/a&gt;s. Rogues are one of the most infamous classes in &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt;, capable of incapacitating opponents for extended periods with a variety of &lt;a href=\"poisons\"&gt;poisons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"bleed\"&gt;bleed&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"stun\"&gt;stun&lt;/a&gt;s and other disabling effects, while they slice and dice their helpless target. Rogues have excellent access to &lt;a href=\"Stealth\"&gt;Stealth&lt;/a&gt;, able to sneak around undetected by enemies and pounce upon their prey with special opening attacks, and have a range of evasive abilities for escaping combat when the odds turn against them. Rogues can also &lt;a href=\"lockpicking\"&gt;pick locks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Detect%20Traps\"&gt;Detect Traps&lt;/a&gt;. With the ability to incapacitate foes, high burst damage, many spell interrupts, and strong evasion abilities, rogues are formidable opponents.\nEach rogue spec focuses on DPS, but has its own way of achieving this. Assassination rogues use poisons and &lt;a href=\"finishing%20move\"&gt;finishing move&lt;/a&gt;s to deal bursts of damage to their targets; Subtlety rogues are dark stalkers, leaping from the shadows to ambush foes before slipping back into the night; Combat rogues are the exception, cunning swashbucklers who use agility and dirty tricks to stand toe-to-toe with enemies. \nThe &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt; class has two primary strengths that are ironically in opposition to each other: they are tremendous damage dealers, yet they are also the best at avoiding combat in the first place.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Stealth\"&gt;Stealth&lt;/a&gt; skill is the rogue's best friend. Rogues have stealth-enhancing talents that can allow them to travel nearly anywhere in the game by themselves, even to the extent of exploring high level instances solo without ever engaging in combat. They can even grab a few extra coins on their way by picking pockets, though this is not a significant source of income. If you enjoy control, and prefer to pick your fights, the rogue is a very enjoyable class.\nOnce in combat, rogues are very potent damage dealers. The rogue is a class that \"fights dirty\" (which is shown through their large arsenal of Stealth abilities, as well as their multiple Stuns and other CC abilities), and they are frequently found at the top of damage-monitoring statistics during endgame raids, although it is common to find rogues sacrificing some of their damage (still leaving it very high) to incapacitate the target through the use of other abilities. Through the use of the combo point system, rogues have many abilities that can either stop an enemy in its tracks or slay it quickly. Like warriors, they need close proximity combat to be effective. They are limited to leather armor and can withstand much less damage than warriors; a rogue will be outmatched if suddenly made the attention of multiple enemies. However, stealth often allows them to escape this situation, either to get away completely or to restart the fight under better circumstances.\nIn PvP rogues are one of the most feared classes because of their stealth capabilities, high burst damage and stunlocks, letting a rogue kill an enemy player without them being able to fight back. This can be very satisfying if you enjoy lying in wait, then pouncing from the shadows to deal huge amounts of damage to the incapacitated enemy, before swiftly slipping away. Subtlety rogues excel at this type of combat. However, in levelling and PvE play, this approach can become slow and repetitious, causing many rogues to favour Assassination or Combat specs for steady combat.\nSeveral of the rogue's most useful combat abilities (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Cheap%20Shot\"&gt;Cheap Shot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ambush\"&gt;Ambush&lt;/a&gt;) require the rogue to be in Stealth, which means that in solo play they can only be used at the start of a fight. In groups, &lt;a href=\"Vanish\"&gt;Vanish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Preparation\"&gt;Preparation&lt;/a&gt; can allow more chances, while in PvP, combat fades after 5 seconds without fighting, allowing you to re-stealth. \nIf you enjoy a class that provides a high-octane, quick-reflex environment, the rogue is for you. Win or lose, fights as a rogue are often over quickly. Take care: if you are prone to committing mistakes, your rogue will become an easy and vulnerable target. But with a cool head and knowledge of the weapons of your disposal - cheap tricks, lethal poisons, an iron grasp of martial arts, and a dozen ways to control your opponent - a well-played rogue will take you far.\nShaman.\n&lt;a href=\"Shaman\"&gt;Shaman&lt;/a&gt;s are mortal mediators between the very elements themselves. Spiritual leaders of their communities, these powerful practitioners commune with the ancestors and seek to balance the raging elemental forces, and can call upon them in battle to scorch and blast their enemies, or to strengthen and heal their allies. Shamans can enhance their weapons with elemental effects, smite enemies with lightning strikes and bursts of lava, and summon powerful elementals to do their bidding. Shamans can also grant themselves and their allies powerful elemental boons, and call upon the ancestors to assist them, transforming into a &lt;a href=\"Ghost%20Wolf\"&gt;Ghost Wolf&lt;/a&gt; or using &lt;a href=\"Reincarnation\"&gt;Reincarnation&lt;/a&gt; to return from the dead. Shamans can also use a selection of stationary &lt;a href=\"totem\"&gt;totem&lt;/a&gt;s to gain a wide variety of effects, from restoring mana and automatically healing allies to snaring foes and attacking the shaman's enemies. Shamans are versatile and formidable opponents, able to respond to any situation with a range of unique abilities.\nShamans are able to specialize in offensive spellcasting, melee damage dealing, or healing. Elemental shamans are powerful spellcasters, fulfilling a caster DPS role to blast and scorch enemies from afar; Enhancement shamans are melee damage dealers, smiting opponents with elementally-empowered weapons; Restoration shamans are versatile healers well suited for any situation.\nShamans can wield most melee weapons and shields, and can wear &lt;a href=\"Cloth%20armor\"&gt;Cloth armor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Leather%20armor\"&gt;Leather armor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mail%20armor\"&gt;Mail armor&lt;/a&gt; at level 40. Shamans can use a range of totems to fit the situation, and can summon elementals and spirit wolves as temporary pets or guardians. They can provide excellent raid buffs through totems and abilities such as &lt;a href=\"Bloodlust\"&gt;Bloodlust&lt;/a&gt;, wreak havoc in PvP with their burst damage, and can provide &lt;a href=\"wipe%20recovery\"&gt;wipe recovery&lt;/a&gt; for the group through &lt;a href=\"reincarnation\"&gt;reincarnation&lt;/a&gt;. Shamans are also known for their multi-target spells such as &lt;a href=\"Chain%20Heal\"&gt;Chain Heal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chain%20Lightning\"&gt;Chain Lightning&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith the better armor protection, shamans are more survivable than the cloth wearers, but need it because they generally lack aggro-reducing abilities. In PvP, Elemental shamans are often considered \"turrets\" since they pretty much just sit and spam their ranged spells, turning when needed, while Enhancement shamans feature a hectic playstyle, dual-wielding elementally-augmented weapons to frantically smite their foes.\nWarlock.\n&lt;a href=\"Warlock\"&gt;Warlock&lt;/a&gt;s are a &lt;a href=\"cloth%20armor\"&gt;cloth&lt;/a&gt;-wearing &lt;a href=\"damage%20%28role%29\"&gt;DPS&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"caster\"&gt;caster&lt;/a&gt; class, known for their wide range of &lt;a href=\"debuff\"&gt;debuff&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"damage%20over%20time\"&gt;damage over time&lt;/a&gt; effects. Warlocks are also recognisable by their demonic &lt;a href=\"warlock%20minion\"&gt;minion&lt;/a&gt;s, used to deal damage to foes, as well as to provide both offensive and defensive utility. Warlocks have a number of &lt;a href=\"crowd%20control\"&gt;crowd control&lt;/a&gt; options, and a wide range of utility spells, which can be used to benefit the entire group. Warlocks also have an interesting relationship with health, capable of converting their health into mana, sacrificing their minions to save themselves, and even trading their own blood in exchange for powerful effects, and possess numerous dark methods for restoring their health, including draining the life from their enemies, and bringing themselves or their allies back from the dead through &lt;a href=\"Soulstone\"&gt;Soulstone&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe warlock is one of the more eccentric classes in the game. Masters of dark demonic forces, these former mages and shamans use their powers to inflict terrible suffering upon their enemies, corrupting and draining the very life from their victims, immolating and incinerate attackers, and summoning great and terrible demons to serve them in battle. Warlocks deal damage from afar using spells and DoTs, while using their pets to tank, incapacitate or devour their enemies. Warlocks are similar to mages, except they have a &lt;a href=\"Demon\"&gt;Demon&lt;/a&gt; minion, and tend to focus more on &lt;a href=\"Damage%20over%20Time\"&gt;Damage over Time&lt;/a&gt; (DoT) spells than &lt;a href=\"Direct%20Damage\"&gt;Direct Damage&lt;/a&gt; (DD) spells. \nAll warlocks fulfil a caster DPS role. However, each warlock &lt;a href=\"specialization\"&gt;specialization&lt;/a&gt; offers a different approach to the class. Affliction warlocks are the masters of damage over time, draining their targets' health with an array of powerful curses and DoTs. They tend to focus on maintaining a formidable array of debuffs to cripple their enemies, using their unparalleled range of DoTs to deal slow but unstoppable damage. Demonology warlocks are the hardiest and most hands-on of the warlocks. Focusing upon their demonic powers, these warlock benefit from empowered minion abilities and access to the &lt;a href=\"Doomguard%20%28warlock%20minion%29\"&gt;Doomguard&lt;/a&gt; minion. Most importantly, these warlocks use &lt;a href=\"Metamorphosis%20%28warlock%20ability%29\"&gt;Metamorphosis (warlock ability)&lt;/a&gt; to regularly shift into a demon form, where they have access to an altered range of abilities and tank-like armor. Destruction warlocks are more similar to mages, using potent burst damage and Fire spells to sear and incinerate enemies. With a range of powerful nukes, these warlocks focus on direct damage and can rapidly reduce unprepared opponents to a pile of cinders. Each spec also has its own special &lt;a href=\"resource\"&gt;resource&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to &lt;a href=\"mana\"&gt;mana&lt;/a&gt;, used to empower their spells, further defining their unique playstyle.\nProbably the most iconic part of being a warlock is their minions, each of which has different abilities and is useful in different situations. Warlocks can summon a range of demons to serve them as their permanent and controllable pet, including the seductive &lt;a href=\"succubus%20%28warlock%20minion%29\"&gt;succubus&lt;/a&gt;, the tank-like &lt;a href=\"voidwalker%20%28warlock%20minion%29\"&gt;voidwalker&lt;/a&gt;, the fireball-hurling &lt;a href=\"Imp%20%28warlock%20minion%29\"&gt;Imp&lt;/a&gt; and the horrific &lt;a href=\"Felhunter%20%28warlock%20minion%29\"&gt;Felhunter&lt;/a&gt;. These can be used to control targets, to prevent incoming damage, to counter enemy spell casters or simply to burn the enemy to a crisp. In addition, warlocks can summon temporary demons like the mighty &lt;a href=\"Infernal%20%28warlock%20minion%29\"&gt;Infernal&lt;/a&gt; for powerful bursts of damage, while at higher levels &lt;a href=\"Grimoire%20of%20Supremacy\"&gt;Grimoire of Supremacy&lt;/a&gt; allows warlocks to summon a new range of demons, with improved abilities and fearsome new forms. Minions are fully controllable, and can be commanded by the warlock to attack targets and use their special abilities to great effect. Similar to the hunter, this means the warlock is rarely alone, and adds an additional element to play. \nWarlocks have several potent forms of crowd control (&lt;a href=\"Fear\"&gt;Fear&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Seduction\"&gt;Seduction&lt;/a&gt;), and a warlock's DoTs will drain their opponent's life away, regardless of whether the warlock himself survives. In comparison to the other cloth classes, the warlock can be involved in multiple fights without having to take a break, thanks to their life-draining abilities.\nA well-played warlock is arguably the busiest &lt;a href=\"DPS\"&gt;DPS&lt;/a&gt; class in the game: there is plenty of debuffing to be done to help the group, a pet to control, &lt;a href=\"crowd%20control\"&gt;crowd control&lt;/a&gt; to be handled, all the while trying to maintain a high damage output. If you enjoy playing a less straight-forward spellcaster and seeing your enemies suffer, the warlock might be for you. \nWarrior.\n&lt;a href=\"Warrior\"&gt;Warrior&lt;/a&gt;s are melee fighters highly trained in the arts of weaponry. They are strong and quick on the battlefield. Clad in &lt;a href=\"plate\"&gt;plate&lt;/a&gt; armor and wielding mighty weapons, they can deal large amounts of damage and are capable of withstanding large amounts of damage to protect other party members. &lt;a href=\"Warrior%20abilities\"&gt;Warrior abilities&lt;/a&gt; are fuelled by &lt;a href=\"rage\"&gt;rage&lt;/a&gt;. Rage is generated through damage being dealt to and by the warrior and is capped at 100. Warriors have many abilities capable of aiding rage generation. &lt;a href=\"Druid\"&gt;Druid&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"Bear%20Form\"&gt;Bear Form&lt;/a&gt; are much akin to warriors. Arms and Fury warriors are fearsome melee DPS, while Protection warriors are indomitable tanks. \nWarriors can change between three combat &lt;a href=\"warrior%20stances\"&gt;stances&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Stance\"&gt;Battle Stance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Defensive%20Stance\"&gt;Defensive Stance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Berserker%20Stance\"&gt;Berserker Stance&lt;/a&gt;. Each stance provides different bonuses, allowing the player a variety of responses to any given &lt;a href=\"PvE\"&gt;PvE&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt; situation. Warriors can wear any type of armor, preferring &lt;a href=\"plate\"&gt;plate&lt;/a&gt; (available at level 40). They are able to use &lt;a href=\"shield\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt;s and can wield any weapon except &lt;a href=\"wand\"&gt;wand&lt;/a&gt;s. The primary warrior attributes are &lt;a href=\"Attributes%23strength\"&gt;strength&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Attributes%23stamina\"&gt;stamina&lt;/a&gt;. Warrior gear focuses on strong armor and devastating weapons. Warriors tend to be more dependent on the quality of their gear than other classes.\nBecause warriors use &lt;a href=\"rage\"&gt;rage&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 which is built up during combat \u2014 instead of mana or energy, there is relatively little downtime between fights. In &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt; play, warriors suffer the disadvantage of having to be near an opponent to deal damage. All classes have a weakness in PvP though, and warriors certainly have the strengths to compensate for this. Abilities like &lt;a href=\"Charge\"&gt;Charge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Heroic%20Leap\"&gt;Heroic Leap&lt;/a&gt; allow warriors to close the gap, while abilities like &lt;a href=\"Hamstring\"&gt;Hamstring&lt;/a&gt; help them ensnare enemies once they do.\nWarriors are usually to be found leading the &lt;a href=\"Charge\"&gt;Charge&lt;/a&gt; into battle, tearing across the battlefield and using furious shouts and terrifying banners to rally their allies and intimidate their enemies. Whether striking down opponents with mighty two-handed weapons, tearing into packs of enemies in a whirlwind of steel, or standing firm in the face of death itself, warriors excel at battle with a range of powerful attacks and battlefield manoeuvres, masters of both skillful strikes and devastating blows. \nPlaying a warrior means action, and lots of it. Warriors love the thrill of close-combat and are usually found in the thick of battle, battling crowds of enemies in a &lt;a href=\"Whirlwind\"&gt;Whirlwind&lt;/a&gt; of steel. DPS warriors have a lot of powerful damage-increasing cooldowns, and often focus around combining these to provide devastating bursts of damage, while snaring and running down their enemies. If you enjoy the thought of smashing foes with massive weapons, carving your opponents to pieces with a sword or axe in each hand, or being an immovable bulwark of steel facing down death itself, the warrior may be for you."}
{"id": "251914", "revid": "22514", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=251914", "title": "Choosing a race", "text": "If you're new to the game, you're faced with a lot of choices. The most important of these choices is without a doubt what &lt;a href=\"class\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt; you want to be. Then, along with choosing a &lt;a href=\"faction\"&gt;faction&lt;/a&gt;, you must choose a &lt;a href=\"race\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe race you choose for your character determines their looks, voice, starting location, classes available, some racial traits, and the faction he or she will belong to. All these subjects are covered in more detail in this article.\nOne thing you should know before starting this process is that, unlike a class, your race and faction are not set in stone. For a reasonable fee, players can change the race of a character, using the &lt;a href=\"Race%20Change\"&gt;Race Change&lt;/a&gt; service if the new race is of the same faction, or the &lt;a href=\"Faction%20Change\"&gt;Faction Change&lt;/a&gt; service if it is not. Although players are free to make use of this service repeatedly, the operation may take a while to complete, and the price alone should deter most players from choosing their character's race too lightly. See the &lt;a href=\"Faction%20Change\"&gt;Faction Change&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Race%20Change\"&gt;Race Change&lt;/a&gt; pages for more in-depth information on the two services.\nWhat playable races are there?\nIn World of Warcraft, there are two factions: the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Each faction currently has 11 race options to them.\nThe races for the Alliance are the &lt;a href=\"dwarf%20%28playable%29\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"gnome%20%28playable%29\"&gt;gnomes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"human%20%28playable%29\"&gt;humans&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"night%20elf%20%28playable%29\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"draenei%20%28playable%29\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Worgen%20%28playable%29\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lightforged%20draenei%20%28playable%29\"&gt;lightforged draenei&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Void%20elf%20%28playable%29\"&gt;void elf&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf%20%28playable%29\"&gt;Dark Iron Dwarf&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiran%20%28playable%29\"&gt;Kul Tiran&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"pandaren%20%28playable%29\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe other races for the Horde are the &lt;a href=\"orc%20%28playable%29\"&gt;orcs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"tauren%20%28playable%29\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"troll%20%28playable%29\"&gt;trolls&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"undead%20%28playable%29\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf%20%28playable%29\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"goblin%20%28playable%29\"&gt;goblins&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20tauren%20%28playable%29\"&gt;Highmountain tauren&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nightborne%20%28playable%29\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mag%27har%20orc%20%28playable%29\"&gt;Mag'har Orc&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll%20%28playable%29\"&gt;Zandalari Troll&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"pandaren%20%28playable%29\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe &lt;a href=\"pandaren%20%28playable%29\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; are currently the only neutral race in the game, playable by both factions. Pandaren characters start the game without faction, and must choose between the Horde and the Alliance when they complete their starting storyline on the &lt;a href=\"Wandering%20Isle\"&gt;Wandering Isle&lt;/a&gt; (around level 10-12). Once made, this choice cannot be changed (except through the paid &lt;a href=\"Faction%20Change\"&gt;Faction Change&lt;/a&gt; service). All other races are tied to their respective factions from the time of creation.\nClick on an individual link for in-depth information on each specific race.\nChoosing a race.\nThere are many reasons to choose one race over another. While some dedicated players may select their race purely in order to gain a slight advantage in high-end play, others may choose their race based on looks, lore or personality.\nFrom tiny gnomes to towering tauren, each race looks and feels very different. Each race and gender has its own model, with a range of styling options; its own animations and movements; and its own emotes (such as the &lt;a href=\"jokes\"&gt;silly&lt;/a&gt; slash commands). Each race (and gender) also has its own voice, which the player will generally hear quite frequently in error message, emotes and other noises (such as when taking damage, or wielding a weapon). The way each race looks, feels, moves and sounds is quite unique, and it's worth taking the time to find one you really enjoy.\nLore and background can also be a substantial factor in race selection. From the shadowy &lt;a href=\"undead%20%28playable%29\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; to the Light-worshipping &lt;a href=\"draenei%20%28playable%29\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;, the racial background of each race is quite distinct, many including a several thousand year-old backstory involving ancient civilizations, wars and distant realms. There is however a great amount of room for players to decide for themselves their character's place among their kind, and a range of possible interpretations of such lore.\nOne of the most critical factors in race selection is the range of classes available to each race. While most races can play as most classes, there are numerous combinations that are not available in-game. Some classes are available to all races, while others may be restricted only to a few. Choosing a class is a very big decision which cannot be changed later - see &lt;a href=\"choosing%20a%20class\"&gt;choosing a class&lt;/a&gt; for details.\nAnother important feature of race selection is each race's &lt;a href=\"faction\"&gt;faction&lt;/a&gt;. Only the pandaren are able to choose their faction after creation; all other races are specifically aligned with one faction or the other, and this cannot be changed. Characters can only talk, group, and create guilds with players from their own faction. Certain zones and cities in the world are also friendly to one faction while hostile to the other. The majority of the levelling experience will be determined by the character's faction, with different quests, NPCs and areas for each faction. Faction also determines a substantial amount of play: characters will fight the opposite faction in &lt;a href=\"battleground\"&gt;battleground&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"world%20PvP\"&gt;world PvP&lt;/a&gt;; work to raise their reputation and earn the praise of the heroes of their faction; complete quests to aid their faction's efforts, and frequently fight against the other faction's NPCs; and generally spend the majority of their time in their faction's cities and surrounded by other members of their faction. Although many choose to play characters of each faction, some players develop a strong sense of &lt;a href=\"faction%20pride\"&gt;faction pride&lt;/a&gt;, often leading to varying degrees of sparring and rivalry between players who identify with each faction.\nEach race also has a selection of unique &lt;a href=\"racials\"&gt;racial traits&lt;/a&gt; or 'racials'. These may be active or passive, and may grant small bonuses or powerful new abilities. While usually not game-changing in their importance, these can at times be fun, helpful or even life-saving. Power-players will want to choose the optimum race for their chosen class in order to gain every possible advantage. Additionally, each race starts with slightly varying &lt;a href=\"stat\"&gt;stat&lt;/a&gt;s, but these are generally considered to be unimportant beyond the early levels.\nThere are some other minor consequences of choosing your race: each race has its own starting area, which will determine your playing experience for the first few levels; some races have their own languages which only they are capable of comprehending (such as &lt;a href=\"gutterspeak\"&gt;gutterspeak&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"draenei%20%28language%29\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; (although this is usually limited to occasional NPCs); and each race has its own racial &lt;a href=\"mount\"&gt;mount&lt;/a&gt;. Racial mounts are ultimately available to all members of that faction, but only after a lengthy &lt;a href=\"reputation\"&gt;reputation&lt;/a&gt; grind.\nIn general, it is usually most important to find a race that you enjoy playing. Whether for its looks, voice or personality, creating a character that you like makes a huge difference to the fun of playing. If you're really stuck trying to decide, simply starting a character and playing it for a few levels is a great way to get a feel for that race, and whether you'll want to play that race all the way to the end-game. You can always delete the character afterwards, and make it again with a different race.\nClass and race.\nChoice of class is limited by race. The table below indicates which classes are available to play for each race, as well as displaying the base starting stats for each race. Icons indicate the expansion in which that race/class combo was introduced. \nFor further details on how different races influence different classes, see the article of each &lt;a href=\"race\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"class\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs of &lt;a href=\"Patch%207.3.5\"&gt;patch 7.3.5&lt;/a&gt;, new &lt;a href=\"Allied%20race\"&gt;allied races&lt;/a&gt; have been added to each &lt;a href=\"faction\"&gt;faction&lt;/a&gt;, adding new &lt;a href=\"race\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt; options to several &lt;a href=\"Class\"&gt;classes&lt;/a&gt;. More allied races have been confirmed to be added during \"\".\nStarting areas.\nThe &lt;a href=\"zone\"&gt;zone&lt;/a&gt; you begin in depends on your race (unless you are a &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"demon%20hunter\"&gt;demon hunter&lt;/a&gt;). Except for &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt;, any race can level in any starting zone of the same faction, you'll just have to hoof it over there. You'll probably want to reach level 5 where you start and then travel to the new zone.\n&lt;a href=\"Allied%20race\"&gt;Allied races&lt;/a&gt; don't have their own starting zone, but start at level 20, which means they don't need to level through a particular starting zone, and are free to choose between a variety of zones and &lt;a href=\"dungeon\"&gt;dungeons&lt;/a&gt; appropriate for their level.\nRacial traits.\nAs mentioned above, different races have different &lt;a href=\"racials\"&gt;racials&lt;/a&gt;. These include passive bonuses and powerful abilities. While racial bonuses should not be game-changing, they can at times prove invaluable, and many dedicated players will choose their character's race solely for the purpose of finding the optimum build for high-end play. For most players, the enjoyment of a character is far more important than their racials, but they can still be useful and fun. For a full list, see &lt;a href=\"Racial%20traits\"&gt;Racial traits&lt;/a&gt;."}

On September 26th, 2023, Metzen was promoted to full time Executive Creative Director of the \"Warcraft\" universe.\nBiography.\nMetzen grew up as \"an RPG kid,\" and was particuarly invested in RPG sourcebooks.\nMetzen began his career in &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard Entertainment&lt;/a&gt; as an artist in 1994, at the age of 19. He began working on ' late in the game's development. Storyline was left to &lt;a href=\"Allen%20Adham\"&gt;Allen Adham&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ron%20Millar\"&gt;Ron Millar&lt;/a&gt;. In ' he took a bigger role as the designer of the story, but also made artwork and voice acting. In ' Blizzard Entertainment outsourced Cyberlore Studios to do the game and Metzen was in charge of storyline consultation and editions. He served as the creative director of '.\nIn the 2000s, Metzen came up with the concept of \"strike teams\" that were not assigned with any of Blizzard's numerically-designated development teams, in order to provide feedback and keep the company's culture intact.\nMetzen worked with Blizzard's cinematic team, and gave feedback on its storyboards. He was also credited as creative director for \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20franchise\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;\".\nHis style characterized the earlier \"Warcraft\", \"&lt;a href=\"StarCraft\"&gt;StarCraft&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;\" series and he eventually became art director. His position in creative development gave him the reins over lore and storylines created for the games of the Blizzard franchises, the foundations of which were laid by previous designers. Metzen later served as co-producer of the 2016 \"&lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20%28film%29\"&gt;Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" film, and wrote the story for both the film's prequel novel ' and . The last \"Warcraft\" project Metzen worked on before his retirement was the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Azeroth%20cinematic\"&gt;intro cinematic&lt;/a&gt; for '.\nRetirement.\nIn September 2016 Metzen announced his retirement, at the age of 42, after nearly 23 years at Blizzard. In &lt;a href=\"http%3A//us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20749157269%23post-1\"&gt;a special post&lt;/a&gt; on all Blizzard forums Metzen shared the story of his entry into the games industry, his experience working at Blizzard, and the importance of friendship in gaming, describing Blizzard as a \"tribe\" and a \"second family\". He explained that he chose the word \"retire\" to reflect that he was not moving onto new projects, but stepping back from all projects, saying it was \"time to slow it down\" and to focus on \"the one thing that matters most to me in all the world\u2014my family\", including his newly arrived third child.\nThe announcement saw a large response on the forums and social media from players and coworkers alike, and was reported across the gaming media and beyond. \"World of Warcraft\" Systems Designer &lt;a href=\"Russ%20Petersen\"&gt;Russ Petersen&lt;/a&gt; remarked, \"One man's contributions to a large project are sometimes overstated. Not so for Chris Metzen and Warcraft. It wouldn't be, without him.\" Metzen later confirmed on Twitter that he would continue to voice &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;.\nReturn.\nOn December 15, 2022, &lt;a href=\"John%20Hight\"&gt;John Hight&lt;/a&gt; announced that Chris Metzen had joined the \"Warcraft\" Leadership Team as Creative Advisor, with an initial focus on \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" and planned involvement in other projects for the franchise. On September 26, 2023 he was promoted to a full-time role as Executive Creative Director of the \"Warcraft\" universe, focused on helping the leadership of the \"World of Warcraft\" team and shape the future stories that will be told over the next few years."}

{"id": "23540", "revid": "39299307", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=23540", "title": "Chromaggus", "text": "Chromaggus is a two-headed dragon beast creation of &lt;a href=\"Nefarian\"&gt;Nefarian&lt;/a&gt;, who acts as a dutiful protector of &lt;a href=\"Blackwing%20Lair\"&gt;Blackwing Lair&lt;/a&gt;. Despite his canine appearance, he's actually a &lt;a href=\"dragonkin\"&gt;dragonkin&lt;/a&gt; (more specifically a &lt;a href=\"drakeadon\"&gt;drakeadon&lt;/a&gt;).\nChromaggus is a boss coming after &lt;a href=\"Flamegor\"&gt;Flamegor&lt;/a&gt; and before &lt;a href=\"Nefarian%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Nefarian&lt;/a&gt;. One of the most challenging aspects to Chromaggus is the randomness of his abilities. Chromaggus shimmers in a variety of colors, which relate to his current abilities. These abilities are determined upon instance creation, and will only be reset with the instance timer. He drops the &lt;a href=\"Tier%202\"&gt;Tier 2&lt;/a&gt; shoulders for all classes.\nCataclysm.\nChromaggus is now tameable and is categorized as a beast. When tamed, he is considered a &lt;a href=\"core%20hound\"&gt;core hound&lt;/a&gt;. Taming him can be dangerous because of his breath attacks, so use extreme caution. Like other core hounds, he requires the 31 point &lt;a href=\"Exotic%20Beasts\"&gt;Exotic Beasts&lt;/a&gt; talent to tame.\nAbilities.\nBreath attacks.\nChromaggus' breaths are unique in that they do not only affect the front of Chromaggus, but hit everything within &lt;a href=\"Line%20of%20sight\"&gt;LoS&lt;/a&gt; of Chromaggus. In each new instance, Chromaggus will use two of five possible breaths. This combination will stay with him for the remainder of the instance timer.\nA breath is cast every 30 seconds, and the 2 breaths alternate.\nBrood afflictions.\nIn addition to his two breaths, Chromaggus also radiates Brood Afflictions which debuff everyone in the zone, not just those in line of sight. They include:\nIt is extremely important that the raid is constantly cured of these debuffs as they not only hinder the players, but can result in a wipe if any player gets all five of the debuffs. This part of the fight is simplified by the &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt;'s Cleanse; otherwise you will have to assign one or two of the various healer classes along with &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;Mage&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Warlock\"&gt;Warlock&lt;/a&gt;s' Felhunters to handle each type of debuff. Bronze affliction can only be removed with &lt;a href=\"Hourglass%20Sand\"&gt;Hourglass Sand&lt;/a&gt;, which drops off the trash packs leading up to Chromaggus. (Mages can also activate &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Block\"&gt;Ice Block&lt;/a&gt; to cancel it). Only healers, tanks, and &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s should need to remove bronze affliction. All other classes can live with it and must adapt to the frequent stuns.\nWhen a player gets all five afflictions, they will turn into an elite Drakonoid. This mutation cannot be dispelled. The only way to deal with this situation is by polymorphing or killing the mutant player. When the player dies, Chromaggus is healed for a significant amount of health, prolonging the encounter. Attempting to chain polymorph the player may become complicated by the immense magical resistance that the player gains from the debuff. As such, it is best to keep these debuffs from ever stacking past 3. It also helps to keep a Restorative Potion handy in case the main dispellers are running low on mana. Mages can use iceblock to remove afflictions, however they cannot ice block out of the mutation.\nEnrage and frenzy.\nChromaggus &lt;a href=\"Frenzy\"&gt;frenzies&lt;/a&gt; every ten to fifteen seconds throughout the fight and must be kept tranquilized by hunters. The frequency of these frenzies is much greater than those of &lt;a href=\"Magmadar\"&gt;Magmadar&lt;/a&gt; but not quite as often as &lt;a href=\"Flamegor\"&gt;Flamegor&lt;/a&gt;. Nevertheless, frenzy must be kept off or the tank will die very quickly.\nAt 20% health, Chromaggus will enter a hard Enrage &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.thottbot.com/%3Fsp%3D28747\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that lasts the duration of the fight. He can still &lt;a href=\"frenzy\"&gt;frenzy&lt;/a&gt;, which makes it even more important for hunters to stay on top of their &lt;a href=\"Tranquilizing%20Shot\"&gt;tranquilizing shots&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, healers who were taking time lapse breath should stop at this point and focus solely on keeping the tank up.\nShimmer.\nChromaggus' skin can \"shimmer\", changing his vulnerability to a particular school of magic. If you have &lt;a href=\"CTMod\"&gt;CTRA&lt;/a&gt; it will help you know when his vulnerability changes and identify it when it is found.\nSeasons of Mastery.\nDuring the Season of Mastery, Chromaggus has the use of all five breath attacks. He uses them in a random order, and they are no longer affected by line of sight (with one exception; see below). In addition, cleansing the Brood Affliction debuffs will cause an additional effect:\nStrategy.\nThe Chromaggus fight is all about line of sight.\nThere are several possible positions where he can be tanked effectively:\nFind somewhere that suits your raid and that you are happy with.\nAs described above, Chromaggus has different breaths. This fight is a long one, and the trick to it is to move &lt;a href=\"OOS\"&gt;OOS&lt;/a&gt; when &lt;a href=\"CTMod\"&gt;CTRA&lt;/a&gt; gives a breath warning. All other than the MT should move &lt;a href=\"OOS\"&gt;OOS&lt;/a&gt;. Healing should intensify on the MT during this period as he will be taking heavy damage from whichever breath Chromaggus uses. The breaths are cast alternately so once you know which breaths he is using you can prepare appropriately.\nDuring the fight Chromaggus will shimmer. This means his resistances have changed. He will become extremely vulnerable to one type of magic and extremely resistant to others allowing for a boost in DPS (or allowing DPS to slow for a time to allow tanks to keep ahead on aggro).\nThe one difference to this tactic is the &lt;a href=\"Time%20Lapse\"&gt;Time Lapse&lt;/a&gt; breath. Commonly called 'hard mode' Chromaggus, &lt;a href=\"Time%20Lapse\"&gt;Time Lapse&lt;/a&gt; is a breath attack that stuns. The stun is a binary spell which can be resisted with arcane resistance. Much like &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Onyxia&lt;/a&gt; when she does her fear attack, Chromaggus will target the person highest on his &lt;a href=\"aggro\"&gt;aggro&lt;/a&gt; list who is not stunned. \nIn order to deal with Time Lapse the tactic in theory is simple, but in practice is harder. \nA warlock can leave an imp on the ideal tank spot so that it is easy for the off tank and MT to get the positioning perfect.\nFor all who can decurse, it is important to be on the ball due to the Brood Affliction debuffs as described above. Especially on the main tank.\nIt is vital that hunters keep tranquilizing shot up on this boss as he causes three times as much damage when frenzied. The blue and bronze afflictions can prevent hunters from tranquilizing. That's a recipe for a dead tank and a wipe, so &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s and paladins must place the highest priority on removing the blue affliction from hunters, and the hunters should each carry two &lt;a href=\"Restorative%20Potion\"&gt;Restorative Potion&lt;/a&gt;s and five &lt;a href=\"Hourglass%20Sand\"&gt;Hourglass Sand&lt;/a&gt;s per attempt.\nAs this is a very long fight, it's not a good idea risking death to stay in the line of fire of a breath attack until the last moment. Get into a safe spot early. The breath attack is instant. Once you see the breath animation start, it's over. So, it's safe to move back into line-of-sight as soon as that appears.\nLoot.\nChromaggus drops two &lt;a href=\"Tier%202\"&gt;Tier 2&lt;/a&gt; shoulders and two non-set items.\nSpeculation.\nChromaggus is similar to a &lt;a href=\"core%20hound\"&gt;core hound&lt;/a&gt;, and it is possible that they are related, possibly by feeding or injecting dragon blood from various dragons from all dragonflights.. &lt;a href=\"The%20Beast\"&gt;The Beast&lt;/a&gt; is a huge core hound found in the nearby &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Upper Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;, captured by the black dragonflight (probably stolen from the &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Core\"&gt;Molten Core&lt;/a&gt;). Most likely The Beast is included in Nefarian's experiments with the &lt;a href=\"chromatic%20dragonflight\"&gt;chromatic dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, which Chromaggus may be a result from. Interestingly, as core hounds (at least the ones found in Molten Core) are the servants of &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; and therefore the enemies of Nefarian and his dragons (see &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt;), Chromaggus may be an attempt by the black dragonflight to gain their enemies' strength."}

While &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; aimed to create chromatic dragons years ago (this desire constituted much of his motivation for attacking &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;), he was never able to capture enough eggs to succeed. His son, &lt;a href=\"Nefarian\"&gt;Nefarian&lt;/a&gt;, has recently succeeded to an extent, creating dozens of these chromatic dragon whelps \u2014 young &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;s with the properties of all five &lt;a href=\"dragonflight\"&gt;dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;s. Raised in captivity, they know only servitude; although highly intelligent, none of these &lt;a href=\"whelp\"&gt;whelp&lt;/a&gt;s has the power or cunning to break Nefarian's grasp on their minds.\nChromatic dragon whelps are fearless in combat, not having learned the value of their own lives. They rotate through their breath weapons in hopes of finding a weakness in their enemies, using their claws to attack in between breaths.\nChromatic whelps speak &lt;a href=\"Draconic\"&gt;Draconic&lt;/a&gt;, and some speak &lt;a href=\"Common%20%28language%29\"&gt;Common&lt;/a&gt; as well."}
