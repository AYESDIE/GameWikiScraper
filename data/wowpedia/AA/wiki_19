Along the way, dive deeper into the mysteries of the Black Dragonflight, meet new allies and foes, discover treasures and rewards, and more.\nAberrus, the Shadowed Crucible Raid.\nMillennia ago, &lt;a href=\"Neltharion\"&gt;Neltharion&lt;/a&gt; carved deep places in the earth where he conducted world altering experiments. After his death, these sites were lost to time, until now. Forces seeking to claim the Earth-Warder's legacy raid his dominion in search for powerful artifacts. Now the champions of Azeroth must venture into darkness and ensure the crucible's dangerous power doesn't fall into the wrong hands.\n&lt;a href=\"Aberrus%2C%20the%20Shadowed%20Crucible\"&gt;Aberrus, the Shadowed Crucible&lt;/a&gt; features nine boss encounters: &lt;a href=\"Kazzara%2C%20the%20Hellforged\"&gt;Kazzara, the Hellforged&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Amalgamation%20Chamber\"&gt;The Amalgamation Chamber&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Forgotten%20Experiments\"&gt;The Forgotten Experiments&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Assault%20of%20the%20Zaqali\"&gt;Assault of the Zaqali&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rashok%2C%20the%20Elder\"&gt;Rashok, the Elder&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Vigilant%20Steward\"&gt;The Vigilant Steward&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zskarn\"&gt;Zskarn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Magmorax\"&gt;Magmorax&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Echo%20of%20Neltharion\"&gt;Echo of Neltharion&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Scalecommander%20Sarkareth%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Scalecommander Sarkareth&lt;/a&gt;.\nCrucible Class Armor Set.\nCollect the Crucible armor set for unique bonuses to your class abilities by conquering Aberrus, the Shadowed Crucible raid bosses, through the Great Vault, or by converting armor pieces via the Revival Catalyst the week of June 13.\nDragonflight Season 2.\n\"Dragonflight\" Season 2 begins the week of May 9. Players will be able to gather their allies and breach Neltharion's secret laboratory in Normal, Heroic, and Mythic difficulty.\nThe new season also brings a new PvP Ladder, increased item level gear, and new rewards: Arena title: \"Obsidian Gladiator\", Rated Solo Shuffle title: \"Obsidian Legend\", a new weapon illusion, tabard, cloak, pennant, weapon appearances, Obsidian Gladiator's Slitherdrake mount, new dragonriding appearance, and new Vicious mounts\u2013Alliance and Horde-themed Snails.\n\"Dragonflight\" Season 2 Mythic+ brings new and adjusted affixes, and new dungeons to the Mythic+ rotation: &lt;a href=\"Brackenhide%20Hollow\"&gt;Brackenhide Hollow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Infusion\"&gt;Halls of Infusion&lt;/a&gt;, , &lt;a href=\"Neltharus\"&gt;Neltharus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Freehold\"&gt;Freehold&lt;/a&gt; (Battle for Azeroth), &lt;a href=\"The%20Underrot\"&gt;The Underrot&lt;/a&gt; (Battle for Azeroth), &lt;a href=\"Vortex%20Pinnacle\"&gt;Vortex Pinnacle&lt;/a&gt; (Cataclysm), and &lt;a href=\"Neltharion%27s%20Lair\"&gt;Neltharion's Lair&lt;/a&gt; (Legion).\nThe new seasonal rewards for Mythic+ include the two new titles \"the Smoldering\" and \"the Smoldering Hero\", dungeon teleports, and a new coloration of the Mythic+ Armoredon mount. \nMythic+ Affixes.\nAt the beginning of Season 2 (May 9 in this region), Keystones will drop 9 levels in addition to any normal weekly reduction that may have occurred. Here's what that might look like:\nCross-Faction Guilds.\nPlayers who have been enjoying Cross-Faction Instances now have the ability to join the same guild as their opposite-faction friends and benefit from conveniences like shared chat and guild repairs.\nGuilds are still affiliated with either the Horde or the Alliance, depending on the faction of the guild leader. Guild achievements and guild vendors, for example, will still reflect the guild's primary faction. Opposite faction members may benefit from unlocked shared perks but may be unable to contribute to certain achievements (e.g. we would not expect Alliance members of a Horde guild to be able to contribute progress towards the \"&lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Slayer\"&gt;Alliance Slayer&lt;/a&gt;\" guild achievement).\nNew Upgrade System.\nA new upgrade system will replace many of the various upgrade systems currently in place, such as Valor and Storm Gear, with a single system that covers most of the game.\nThe basics of this system are simple: you'll earn a new currency called &lt;a href=\"Flightstones\"&gt;Flightstones&lt;/a&gt; from just about anything you do\u2014 complete a world quest, kill a unique creature, run a Mythic Keystone dungeon, kill a raid boss, etc. You'll also get items called &lt;a href=\"Shadowflame%20Crest\"&gt;Shadowflame Crest&lt;/a&gt;s (or fragments of them), which come in four varieties from different content difficulty levels. Shadowflame Crests and their fragments will also come from a wide range of content, including outdoor gameplay, Mythic+ dungeons, and raids. You\u2019ll be able to upgrade almost any item in \"Dragonflight\": Season 2's max-level gameplay ecosystem, whether it comes from a World Quest or a Heroic raid boss, by spending Flightstones and Shadowflame Crests.\nDungeons and Raids.\nThe Vortex Pinnacle.\nNew Ability: Biting Cold \u2013 Altairus' presence chills the air around him, inflicting Frost damage to all players every 3 seconds."}
{"id": "761005", "revid": "1965082", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=761005", "title": "Patch 10.1.0/API changes", "text": "Private Auras.\nA new private aura system has been added through which the UI can display buffs and debuffs active on units without exposing information on the auras to addons. This works as a separate system to the existing buff and debuff display and must be configured through a set of new APIs.\nThe following example configures a private aura anchor in the center of the screen for the first private aura applied to the player. A cooldown frame is configured to represent the duration, and the icon is displayed in the center of the frame. A textual duration will be displayed in a fontstring below the icon.\nMultiple anchors for a single aura can be created by addons with their own independent settings. The function returns an ID which can be later supplied to to remove the aura display from the UI.\nlocal PrivateAuraFrame1 = CreateFrame(\"Frame\", UIParent)\nPrivateAuraFrame1:SetPoint(\"CENTER\")\nPrivateAuraFrame1:SetSize(32, 32)\nlocal auraAnchorID = C_UnitAuras.AddPrivateAuraAnchor({\n unitToken = \"player\",\n auraIndex = 1,\n parent = PrivateAuraFrame1,\n showCountdownFrame = true,\n showCountdownNumbers = true,\n iconInfo = {\n iconWidth = 32,\n iconHeight = 32,\n iconAnchor = {\n point = \"CENTER\",\n relativeTo = PrivateAuraFrame1,\n relativePoint = \"CENTER\",\n offsetX = 0,\n offsetY = 0,\n },\n durationAnchor = {\n point = \"TOP\",\n relativeTo = PrivateAuraFrame1,\n relativePoint = \"BOTTOM\",\n offsetX = 0,\n offsetY = 0,\n})\nA sound alert can be configured to be played upon application of an aura. This works through spell IDs rather than aura indices. The function returns an ID which can be later supplied to to disable the sound effect being played.\nlocal auraSoundID = C_UnitAuras.AddPrivateAuraAppliedSound({\n unitToken = \"player\",\n spellID = 12345,\n soundFileName = \"Interface\\\\AddOns\\\\MyAddOn\\\\Alert.ogg\",\n outputChannel = \"SFX\",\nFinally, a raid message style alert can be configured to display text when a private aura is applied. Unlike the previous APIs this is a global resource; individual addons cannot configure their own raid message displays for private auras.\nC_UnitAuras.SetPrivateWarningTextAnchor(UIParent, {\n point = \"CENTER\",\n relativeTo = UIParent,\n relativePoint = \"CENTER\",\n offsetX = 0,\n offsetY = 0,\nAddon Compartment Changes.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Addon%20compartment\"&gt;Addon compartment&lt;/a&gt; has been updated to support automatically registering dropdown entries for addons from &lt;a href=\"TOC%20format\"&gt;TOC&lt;/a&gt; fields. The following TOC fields have been added.\nThe example below demonstrates the use of these TOC fields.\nMyAddOn.toc\n ## Interface: \n ## Title: My Addon\n ## Notes: Does something neat\n ## Author: Your Name\n ## AddonCompartmentFunc: MyAddOn_OnAddonCompartmentClick\n ## IconTexture: Interface\\Icons\\TEMP.blp\n MyAddOn.lua\nMyAddOn.lua\n function MyAddOn_OnAddonCompartmentClick(addonName, buttonName)\n print(\"Hello from the addon compartment!\")\n end\nAddon Chat Links.\nA new &lt;a href=\"Hyperlinks%23addon\"&gt;addon&lt;/a&gt; link type has been added to the chat frame infrastructure to better support addon-created chat links. This new link type is local-only and cannot be sent in chat messages. This serves as a replacement for &lt;a href=\"Hyperlinks%23garrmission\"&gt;garrmission&lt;/a&gt; links without needing to rely on their current implementation details to avoid taint.\nEventRegistry:RegisterCallback(\"SetItemRef\", function(_, link, text, button, chatFrame)\n local linkType, addonName, linkData = string.split(\":\", link, 3)\n if linkType == \"addon\" and addonName == \"SomeAddon\" then\n print(\"Link clicked: \", linkData)\n end\nend)\nChatFrame1:AddMessage(\"|cFFFFFF00|Haddon:SomeAddon:hidden-data|h[Some Clickable Message]|h|r\")\nScroll Templates.\nA new ScrollFrame template named &lt;a href=\"https%3A//github.com/Gethe/wow-ui-source/blob/6eca162dbca161e850b735bd5b08039f96caf2df/Interface/SharedXML/SecureUIPanelTemplates.xml%23L92\"&gt;ScrollFrameTemplate&lt;/a&gt; has been added. This serves as a replacement for many old scrolling related templates that are now deprecated as of this patch. This template can be used as a simpler alternative to ScrollBox views, and automatically creates and configures a scrollbar for use with the frame. An Lua example can be found below to demonstrate the use of this new template.\nlocal ScrollFrame = CreateFrame(\"ScrollFrame\", nil, UIParent, \"ScrollFrameTemplate\")\nScrollFrame:SetSize(300, 300)\nScrollFrame:SetPoint(\"CENTER\")\nlocal ScrollChild = CreateFrame(\"Frame\")\nScrollChild:SetSize(300, 600)\nlocal ScrollTexture = ScrollChild:CreateTexture(nil, \"OVERLAY\")\nScrollTexture:SetAllPoints(ScrollChild)\nScrollTexture:SetColorTexture(1, 0, 0, 1)\nScrollTexture:SetGradient(\"VERTICAL\", CreateColor(1, 0, 0, 1), CreateColor(0, 0, 0, 1))\nScrollFrame:SetScrollChild(ScrollChild)\nFor XML use cases, refer to the following example.\n&lt;ScrollFrame name=\"MyAddon_ScrollFrame\" inherits=\"ScrollFrameTemplate\" parent=\"UIParent\"&gt;\n &lt;Size x=\"300\" y=\"300\"/&gt;\n &lt;Anchors&gt;\n &lt;Anchor point=\"CENTER\"/&gt;\n &lt;/Anchors&gt;\n &lt;ScrollChild&gt;\n &lt;Frame&gt;\n &lt;Size x=\"300\" y=\"600\"/&gt;\n &lt;Layers&gt;\n &lt;Layer level=\"OVERLAY\"&gt;\n &lt;Texture setAllPoints=\"true\"&gt;\n &lt;Color r=\"1\"/&gt;\n &lt;Gradient orientation=\"VERTICAL\"&gt;\n &lt;MinColor r=\"1\"/&gt;\n &lt;MaxColor r=\"0\"/&gt;\n &lt;/Gradient&gt;\n &lt;/Texture&gt;\n &lt;/Layer&gt;\n &lt;/Layers&gt;\n &lt;/Frame&gt;\n &lt;/ScrollChild&gt;\n&lt;/ScrollFrame&gt;\nThe following key values pairs can be assigned via XML to customize the creation of the scrollbar.\nDeprecated Templates.\nThe following templates have been deprecated and will be removed in a future patch. Many of these can be replaced by ScrollFrameTemplate with minimal changes required.\nThe &lt;a href=\"https%3A//github.com/Gethe/wow-ui-source/blob/0b5d4526f16f56a4c652d0d472620d6591a20f7d/Interface/SharedXML/SecureUIPanelTemplates.lua%23L67\"&gt;ScrollFrame_OnLoad&lt;/a&gt; function was renamed to &lt;a href=\"https%3A//github.com/Gethe/wow-ui-source/blob/6eca162dbca161e850b735bd5b08039f96caf2df/Interface/SharedXML/SecureScrollTemplates.lua%23L52\"&gt;UIPanelScrollFrame_OnLoad&lt;/a&gt;, however the old function name was reused and now refers to an entirely new and different function.

Its current planned release date is on 11 July 2023.\nWhile adventurers breach Neltharion's secret laboratory in &lt;a href=\"Aberrus%2C%20the%20Shadowed%20Crucible\"&gt;Aberrus, the Shadowed Crucible&lt;/a&gt;, the next content update is making its way onto the PTR, including a whole new specialization for dracthyr Evokers, a new mega-dungeon\u2014Dawn of the Infinite\u2014and much more.\nNew Mega-Dungeon: Dawn of the Infinite.\nThe Infinite Dragonflight, long-standing enemies of the Bronze dragonflight, have worked hard to see their ultimate goal of triggering the transformation of &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt;, the Aspect of Time, into Murozond. This eight-boss Mythic-only mega-dungeon will take players across the timeways to stop the Infinite Dragonflight from succeeding. You'll face Iridikron, among others, as you work to sustain Azeroth's timeline and put things to rights once more.\nNew Evoker Specialization: Augmentation.\nEmberthal and Ebyssian are working together to release the Black dragonflight essence that had been siphoned from the Dracthyr during their long stasis, unlocking memories and powers forgotten to them. All Evokers now can choose to explore Azeroth as a new specialization: Augmentation. Evokers can play \"&lt;a href=\"Our%20Destiny\"&gt;Our Destiny&lt;/a&gt;\" quest to try out their new specialization and what it means to the dracthyr at large. \nAugmentation is a damage dealer role that uses the essence of the Black and Bronze dragonflights to amplify the abilities of nearby allies. Their playstyle centers on empowering allies to increase their damage output, and using the Evoker's direct damage spells to improve these empowerments' effects. Augmentation's core capabilities will feel familiar to Evoker players, such as spending Essence, casting empower spells, and using their mobility to navigate the battlefield. However, the specialization also introduces many new tools for the Evoker to manipulate the environment in their favor, and assist their allies.\nTime Rifts.\nThe time streams have become increasingly more unstable with recent events. As the boundaries between the timelines weaken, minions from other timelines begin pouring through into the Dragon Isles.\nTeam up with other players to push back against the waves of minions, enter the &lt;a href=\"Time%20Rifts\"&gt;Time Rifts&lt;/a&gt;, and plug the hole by taking down the bosses in alternate timelines to set the timeways straight again. Collect artifacts and take them back to &lt;a href=\"Soridormi\"&gt;Soridormi&lt;/a&gt; to complete quests.\nOn completion, each Time Rift has a chance to grant a reward based on what timelines you've encountered, and you can never obtain the same reward twice! Acquire an &lt;a href=\"Encapsulated%20Destiny\"&gt;Encapsulated Destiny&lt;/a&gt; and use it to guarantee yourself a reward from the next Time Rift you complete. Not getting what you want? No sweat! Everything is available on the corresponding timeline's vendor in exchange for the Time Rift currency, &lt;a href=\"Paracausal%20Flakes\"&gt;Paracausal Flakes&lt;/a&gt;.\nEon's Fringe.\nWhile the timeways are unstable, undertake new repeatable content in Eon's Fringe in Thaldraszus, located near the Temporal Conflux.\nNozdormu knows his time is coming and can feel things are going awry. Due to these disruptions, episodes in Azeroth's history are going astray, and players must access Eon's Fringe to set things right. Work to settle the timeways and solve the problems brought about by their instability and reap the rewards of a job well done.\nWhelp Daycare.\nThe dragons have more eggs than they can handle, so they've called in the crew at the Little Scales Daycare to help. The crew quickly finds itself overwhelmed and so has asked for a little help from their friends\u2014you. You'll guide five dragon whelps as they grow and learn about the dragon flights, collect new pets, achievements, and more.\nNew Bonus Event: Kalimdor Cup.\nRediscover Kalimdor's skies with a new dragonriding racing event arriving to Azeroth and running from August 15\u201328. Challenge 16 races across Kalimdor in Normal, Advanced, and Reverse variations to earn Riders of Azeroth Badges to exchange for rewards from Maztha.\nThe Warlock Class Expands to New Races.\nThe Warlock class is now available to Night Elves, Draenei, Lightforged Draenei, Pandaren, Kul Tiran, Tauren, Highmountain Tauren, Mag'har Orcs, and Zandalari Trolls. You'll also be able to undertake a new Warlock-specific questline and use the Barbershop to customize your pets.\nPlayer vs. Player.\nDruid.\nRestoration"}

Every 30 minutes, a major Waking Dream portal will open in the affected zone as a group event. While active, that zone will be granted Dreaming Winds\u2014a 25% increase to experience for players leveling in that area.\nChampions must work together to defeat the onslaught by defeating the Druids of the Flame, destroying their altars, and dragonriding through their reinforcements circling above. Once complete, prepare for a fight with a Flame Lieutenant who drops &lt;a href=\"Charred%20Elemental%20Remains\"&gt;Charred Elemental Remains&lt;/a&gt; once he is defeated. During a Dreamsurge, minor Waking Dream portals are also found scattered across the affected zone; these can be defeated by solo players or small groups.\nEvery 30 minutes while the event is active, a new buff will be selected for that region. Those participating in the event can vote to shape the incoming Dreamsurge, so players will have various useful, powerful, or chaotic buffs to help them defend the zone.\nHeroic Dawn of the Infinite.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Infinite%20dragonflight\"&gt;Infinite Dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, long-standing enemies of the &lt;a href=\"Bronze%20dragonflight\"&gt;Bronze dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, have worked hard to see their ultimate goal of triggering the transformation of &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt;, the Aspect of Time, into &lt;a href=\"Murozond\"&gt;Murozond&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Dawn%20of%20the%20Infinite\"&gt;This mega-dungeon&lt;/a&gt; will split into two Heroic difficulty dungeons that will take players across the timeways to stop the Infinite Dragonflight from succeeding.

New questlines will be available for both races to undertake and gain armor variations to add to their collection. Please note that Forsaken will need to complete the Return to Lordaeron storyline before they can begin their Heritage armor quests.\nForsaken will also gain five new skin color variations, and the night elves can adorn themselves with additional choices of face markings and body tattoos. \nEastern Kingdoms Cup.\nOn October 4 through October 17, soar through the skies of the Eastern Kingdoms with the dragonrider racing event, &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms%20Cup\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms Cup&lt;/a&gt;.\nChallenge sixteen races across Eastern Kingdoms in Normal, Advanced, and Reverse variations to earn &lt;a href=\"Riders%20of%20Azeroth%20Badge\"&gt;Riders of Azeroth Badge&lt;/a&gt;s to exchange for rewards with &lt;a href=\"Maztha\"&gt;Maztha&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Valdrakken\"&gt;Valdrakken&lt;/a&gt;.

The edges and central fill of the rendered texture can be configured to either tile or stretch across their respective dimensions.\nThis system is recommended to be used in new code going forward as a replacement for both the deprecated &lt;a href=\"BackdropTemplate\"&gt;Backdrop&lt;/a&gt; system and the script-based NineSlice panel layout utility. One of the advantages of this new system is that it only requires a single texture object to render the grid, whereas both the old systems required nine separate objects. This system is fully compatible with custom texture assets and does not require the use of atlases.\nTo use this system from Lua the method should be called to specify the pixel margins that represent the edges of the underlying asset. The method controls whether or not the central portion of the texture and its surrounding edges will be tiled or stretched, with the default being stretched. The below example demonstrates the usage of these APIs.\nlocal SliceDemo = CreateFrame(\"Frame\", nil, UIParent);\nSliceDemo:SetPoint(\"CENTER\");\nSliceDemo:SetSize(256, 256);\nSliceDemo:SetResizable(true);\nSliceDemo.Texture = SliceDemo:CreateTexture();\nSliceDemo.Texture:SetTexture(&lt;a href=\"interface/soulbinds/soulbindsconduitpendinganimationmask\"&gt;interface/soulbinds/soulbindsconduitpendinganimationmask&lt;/a&gt;)\nSliceDemo.Texture:SetTextureSliceMargins(24, 24, 24, 24);\nSliceDemo.Texture:SetTextureSliceMode(Enum.UITextureSliceMode.Tiled);\nSliceDemo.Texture:SetAllPoints(SliceDemo);\nSliceDemo.Texture:SetVertexColor(0, 1, 0);\nSliceDemo.ResizeButton = CreateFrame(\"Button\", nil, SliceDemo, \"PanelResizeButtonTemplate\");\nSliceDemo.ResizeButton:SetPoint(\"BOTTOMRIGHT\");\nSliceDemo.ResizeButton:Init(SliceDemo, 64, 64, 512, 512);\nThe following new elements in XML can be supplied when defining a Texture object to configure this functionality.\n&lt;Texture file=\"interface/soulbinds/soulbindsconduitpendinganimationmask\"&gt;\n &lt;TextureSliceMargins left=\"24\" right=\"24\" top=\"24\" bottom=\"24\"/&gt;\n &lt;TextureSliceMode mode=\"Tiled\"/&gt; &lt;!-- Can be \"Tiled\" or \"Stretched\" --&gt;\n&lt;/Texture&gt;"}

In the massacre's aftermath the warlocks of the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt; seized the structure and gave it a new name: the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; invaded &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, the orc shaman &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; hastily opened several &lt;a href=\"Dimensional%20gateway\"&gt;dimensional portals&lt;/a&gt; in order to escape. The resulting magical backlash ripped the world apart. Drawn by these portals, the pit lord &lt;a href=\"Magtheridon\"&gt;Magtheridon&lt;/a&gt; arrived in what had come to be known as &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; and took the temple as his seat of power.\nHis dominion over Outland remained unchallenged until the arrival of &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan the Betrayer&lt;/a&gt;. The pit lord proved no match for the wielder of the &lt;a href=\"Twin%20Blades%20of%20Azzinoth\"&gt;Twin Blades of Azzinoth&lt;/a&gt;. Today Illidan occupies the temple, awaiting any and all who would challenge his rule.\nDruid Epic Flight Form Introduced.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Druid\"&gt;Druid&lt;/a&gt; Epic flight form will be available through a series of quests, similar to the &lt;a href=\"Warlock\"&gt;Warlock&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt; Epic mount quests before it. This quest series will also open up a new boss in &lt;a href=\"Sethekk%20Halls\"&gt;Sethekk Halls&lt;/a&gt;, and ultimately lead to the &lt;a href=\"Swift%20Flight%20Form\"&gt;epic flight form&lt;/a&gt;.\nEthereum Prison.\nPlayers in &lt;a href=\"Reputation\"&gt;good standing&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Consortium\"&gt;Consortium&lt;/a&gt; will be tasked to deal with the most recent activities of the nefarious &lt;a href=\"Ethereum\"&gt;Ethereum&lt;/a&gt;. With new quests, items, and content for the solo and small-group level 70 player, the Ethereum Prison will be the proving grounds for many aspiring to greatness.\nSkettis.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sha%27tari%20Skyguard\"&gt;Skyguard&lt;/a&gt;, Sha'tari warriors specializing in their command of the skies above &lt;a href=\"Shattrath\"&gt;Shattrath&lt;/a&gt;, have taken the offensive directly to the &lt;a href=\"Arakkoa\"&gt;Arakkoa&lt;/a&gt; capital city, &lt;a href=\"Skettis\"&gt;Skettis&lt;/a&gt;.

All new quests, 5-person bosses, rare and epic items, and a new type of flying mount await those willing to lend their sword or stave to the battle.\nNether Drake.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Netherwing\"&gt;Netherwing&lt;/a&gt; faction and quest line continues and the long awaited &lt;a href=\"Netherwing%20drake%20mounts\"&gt;Nether Drake&lt;/a&gt; becomes available. The Nether Drake is a special 280% speed epic flying mount that is obtainable through solo and small-group play.

Level 70 players will be able to help the ogres of &lt;a href=\"Ogri%27la\"&gt;Ogri'la&lt;/a&gt; battle invading forces and engage in new and exciting quests, such as a repeatable and ever popular bombing-run, this time using your own flying mount but with a dangerous twist!

While this will result in some hard work now, it should be easier to maintain your AddOns in the future.\nThe feature we\u2019re most proud of is the ability to filter your combat log. The combat log stores the last five minutes worth of raw combat events. Filters can be setup on multiple criteria, affiliation, ownership, etc. Any events that match the current filter are passed through the client via the COMBAT_LOG_EVENT message. The combat log filter is global. However, AddOns which want to parse all events the moment they happen can register for the COMBAT_LOG_EVENT_UNFILTERED message. This should allow all existing AddOns to still respond to combat events without a complicated middle-manager AddOn.\nWhile the default combat log will only be setting 1-2 filters at a time, the WoW client supports many simultaneous filters. It\u2019s possible to setup multiple filters to filter very specific source-target-event combinations. If a combat log event passes any of the filters, the COMBAT_LOG_EVENT event fires. This allows AddOns to define extremely specific settings we chose not expose in the base UI.\nThe new combat log will be coming with two text formats. One is the familiar, grammatically correct sentences with substitutions. The other is a terse format, containing the source, target, spell, action and result. There will be a number of ways to manipulate the formatting, from unit name coloring to coloring the damage numbers by their magic school. The settings used for these formats are stored in the Blizzard_CombatLog_Filters variable.\nThe result of the new terse format is that it\u2019s very easy to write AddOns to modify or extend the format which ships with 2.4.0. In the formatting section, you can read up on a quick demonstration of how to convert the combat log to a \u201cNurfed\u201d style combat log. While you can do a lot by just adjusting the settings within WoW, it\u2019s also possible to provide an AddOn that changes the strings used to generate the Combat Log messages. This allows for more extensive formatting changes without re-writing the entire parsing engine. See the Formatting Section for an example.\nThe whole combat log also supports a new coloring model, based on context. While by default, entire lines are a single color, highlighting the most important details. The combat log also supports coloring just unit names, spells, actions and damage numbers. Spells and damage can also be colored by school. However, there are several features not exposed in the base UI that AddOns can use right away. These are event-specific coloring, unit coloring with greater granularity and the ability to customize the list of highlighted events.\nThere are several other formatting related features. You can enable timestamps which show the time that spell or attack happened. You can show or hide square braces, change formatting without refreshing the combat log and disable the display of raid icons. These features were too niche to go into the base UI, but can be easily exposed for power users. By now you\u2019ve already thought of some features of your own and are ready to get to coding. So let\u2019s jump straight to some examples.\nFormatting &amp; Coloring.\nOne of the major combat log formats we considered while redoing the combat log was the Nurfed Combat Log format. This combat log format was very concise, made heavy use of color-coding and was one of the final candidates for the combat log. We eventually axed it on the basis of being too overwhelming for new users. However, we left in all of the options to convert the current combat log into the Nurfed combat log.\nHere\u2019s how:\nCombat Log Settings -&gt; Colors\nUnit Colors:\n Me -&gt; Green\n My Pet -&gt; Dark Green\n Friends -&gt; Blue\n Enemies -&gt; Red\n Neutral -&gt; Yellow\nColorize:\n Unit Names -&gt; Checked\n Spell Names -&gt; Checked\n Spell Color-by-School -&gt; Checked\n Damage Number -&gt; Checked\n Damage Color-by-School -&gt; Checked\n Damage School -&gt; Checked\n Entire Line -&gt; Unchecked\n All Highlighting Options-&gt; Unchecked\nFormatting:\n Verbose -&gt; Unchecked\n Braces -&gt; Checked\n Timestamps -&gt; Checked\nHowever, some people may want it even more terse than that. For this, we present:\nHyper Condensed Mode\nTo get rid of the word \u201cFire\u201d and \u201cFrost\u201d type:\n/script TEXT_MODE_A_STRING_VALUE_SCHOOL = \"\";\nThat will remove the Fire from \u201c55 Fire\u201d. However, let\u2019s go even farther:\nAll of these are really long. Let\u2019s compress them:\nTEXT_MODE_A_STRING_RESULT_RESISTED = \"R\";\nTEXT_MODE_A_STRING_RESULT_BLOCKED = \"B\";\nTEXT_MODE_A_STRING_RESULT_ABSORBED = \"A\";\nTEXT_MODE_A_STRING_RESULT_CRITICAL = \"C\";\nTEXT_MODE_A_STRING_RESULT_GLANCING = \"G\";\nTEXT_MODE_A_STRING_RESULT_CRUSHING = \"Cr\";\nNow we get\n[You] [Fireball] Hit [Spider] 64. (C) (5 R)\nFilters.\nFilters consistent of 3 parts:\n * Source\n * Target\n * Events\nSource &amp; Target can be one of two types:\n * String\n * Number\nIf it is a string, then that string is assumed to be the GUID of the unit in question. If it\u2019s a number, it is assumed to be a bitfield assembled from the following criteria:\nConstants.\n-- Affiliation\nCOMBATLOG_OBJECT_AFFILIATION_MINE = 0x00000001;\nCOMBATLOG_OBJECT_AFFILIATION_PARTY = 0x00000002;\nCOMBATLOG_OBJECT_AFFILIATION_RAID = 0x00000004;\nCOMBATLOG_OBJECT_AFFILIATION_OUTSIDER = 0x00000008;\nCOMBATLOG_OBJECT_AFFILIATION_MASK = 0x0000000F;\n-- Reaction\nCOMBATLOG_OBJECT_REACTION_FRIENDLY = 0x00000010;\nCOMBATLOG_OBJECT_REACTION_NEUTRAL = 0x00000020;\nCOMBATLOG_OBJECT_REACTION_HOSTILE = 0x00000040;\nCOMBATLOG_OBJECT_REACTION_MASK = 0x000000F0;\n-- Ownership\nCOMBATLOG_OBJECT_CONTROL_PLAYER = 0x00000100;\nCOMBATLOG_OBJECT_CONTROL_NPC = 0x00000200;\nCOMBATLOG_OBJECT_CONTROL_MASK = 0x00000300;\n-- Unit type\nCOMBATLOG_OBJECT_TYPE_PLAYER = 0x00000400;\nCOMBATLOG_OBJECT_TYPE_NPC = 0x00000800;\nCOMBATLOG_OBJECT_TYPE_PET = 0x00001000;\nCOMBATLOG_OBJECT_TYPE_GUARDIAN = 0x00002000;\nCOMBATLOG_OBJECT_TYPE_OBJECT = 0x00004000;\nCOMBATLOG_OBJECT_TYPE_MASK = 0x0000FC00;\n-- Special cases (non-exclusive)\nCOMBATLOG_OBJECT_TARGET = 0x00010000;\nCOMBATLOG_OBJECT_FOCUS = 0x00020000;\nCOMBATLOG_OBJECT_MAINTANK = 0x00040000;\nCOMBATLOG_OBJECT_MAINASSIST = 0x00080000;\nCOMBATLOG_OBJECT_RAIDTARGET1 = 0x00100000;\nCOMBATLOG_OBJECT_RAIDTARGET2 = 0x00200000;\nCOMBATLOG_OBJECT_RAIDTARGET3 = 0x00400000;\nCOMBATLOG_OBJECT_RAIDTARGET4 = 0x00800000;\nCOMBATLOG_OBJECT_RAIDTARGET5 = 0x01000000;\nCOMBATLOG_OBJECT_RAIDTARGET6 = 0x02000000;\nCOMBATLOG_OBJECT_RAIDTARGET7 = 0x04000000;\nCOMBATLOG_OBJECT_RAIDTARGET8 = 0x08000000;\nCOMBATLOG_OBJECT_NONE = 0x80000000;\nCOMBATLOG_OBJECT_SPECIAL_MASK = 0xFFFF0000;\nA unit can only be one of the following four categories:\n1. Affiliation\n2. Reaction\n3. Ownership\n4. Type\nHere\u2019s a quick explanation of how these flags are broken down:\nAffiliation:.\nA unit\u2019s affiliation is the unit\u2019s relationship relative to YOU. Either it is owned by you, your party, your raid or someone else.\n[[[Mine]Party]Raid] Outsiders\nReaction:.\nThis is the unit\u2019s faction reaction, relative to you. Anything that hates you is Hostile, anything that is friendly with you is Friendly, everything else is Neutral.\nOwnership:.\nThis is who owns this object. It can only be controlled by a player or the server.\nUnit Type:.\nThis is the way the unit is currently being controlled. Units directly controlled by their owner are players. Units controlled by the server are NPCs. Pets are controlled by another player or unit. Guardians are automatons that are not controlled, but automatically defend their master. Objects are everything else, such as Traps.\nThe result is that these bits can tell you what kind of unit that combat log object was.\nExample:\nA player who is dueling you is 0x0548.\nA player who was mind controlled that attacks you is 0x1148.\nDefault Filters.\nThe default filters are constructed by summing certain bit combinations together:\nCOMBATLOG_FILTER_MINE = bit.bor (\n COMBATLOG_OBJECT_AFFILIATION_MINE,\n COMBATLOG_OBJECT_REACTION_FRIENDLY,\n COMBATLOG_OBJECT_CONTROL_PLAYER,\n COMBATLOG_OBJECT_TYPE_PLAYER,\n COMBATLOG_OBJECT_TYPE_OBJECT\nThis means that everything colored mine by default must be affiliated with me, friendly, controlled by a player and be a player.\nAny unit that matches at least one bit in each of the four exclusive categories will pass the filter test. Filters can have more than one bit set in a category.\nCOMBATLOG_FILTER_FRIENDLY_UNITS = bit.bor(\n COMBATLOG_OBJECT_AFFILIATION_PARTY,\n COMBATLOG_OBJECT_AFFILIATION_RAID,\n COMBATLOG_OBJECT_AFFILIATION_OUTSIDER,\n COMBATLOG_OBJECT_REACTION_FRIENDLY,\n COMBATLOG_OBJECT_CONTROL_PLAYER,\n COMBATLOG_OBJECT_CONTROL_NPC,\n COMBATLOG_OBJECT_TYPE_PLAYER,\n COMBATLOG_OBJECT_TYPE_NPC,\n COMBATLOG_OBJECT_TYPE_PET,\n COMBATLOG_OBJECT_TYPE_GUARDIAN,\n COMBATLOG_OBJECT_TYPE_OBJECT\nThis will allow messages relating to any unit who has a friendly reaction with you, the player. (Another way to do this is to use the \u201c_MASK\u201d suffixed globals, rather than specifying all bits, but I did it this way to make the point clear). \nSetting up Filters.\nEach time you call the CombatLogAddFilter() function, you add a new filter. Any unit that passes that filter fires the COMBAT_LOG_EVENT event. For example, if you wanted to see anything that you did and anything hostile enemies did to you, you would call the following\nCombatLogAddFilter(nil, COMBATLOG_FILTER_MINE, nil)\nCombatLogAddFilter(nil, COMBATLOG_FILTER_HOSTILE_UNITS , COMBATLOG_FILTER_MINE nil)\nRetrieving Combat Messages.\nOnce you setup your filter, all of the entries which match that filter are organized into a linked list. By calling CombatLogSetCurrentEntry(1), you set the current pointer to the beginning of that list. If no message exists, CombatLogSetCurrentEntry(1) will fail. If you pass a negative number into CombatLogSetCurrentEntry(), it will select the Nth entry from the end of the list.\nTo move the pointer forward, call CombatLogAdvanceEntry(1) to move to the next entry in the list.\nThe CombatLogGetCurrentEntry() and COMBAT_LOG_EVENT events will return all of the arguments for that event. The exact argument order depends on the event, but here are the arguments that do not change:\ntimestamp, event, srcGUID, srcName, srcFlags, dstGUID, dstName, dstFlags = CombatLogGetCurrentEntry()\nEvents.\nThere are honestly too many events to go into detail on all of them here, but here\u2019s the basic organization.\nQ &amp; A:.\nQ: The combat log only stores 5 minutes of events. Why 5? Why not 10?\nA: We feel that 5 minutes is a good base number for most players . You can change this length, however with the CombatLogSetRetentionTime(seconds) function.\nQ: Will the combat log be saved when I logout to my character list?\nA: No. However, if you only reload the UI, the messages stay in the client.\nQ: Why did you do it this way? Why didn\u2019t you do it X way?\nA: We tried to expose as much information as we could, without compromising gameplay and giving us the feature set we needed.\nQ: Why didn\u2019t you include information about who owns &lt;Summoned Pet Name Here&gt;?\nA: This was one we considered for a while, but decided to leave out for the sake of simplicity. We\u2019re going to be watching how the new combat log plays out before adding new features or making additional changes.\nQ: Why did the CombatLog.txt file change?\nA: Changing the CombatLog.txt format freed us to implement the combat log in this new event-driven way. We also felt that providing the combat log as raw data made parsing easier for sites such as WoW Web Stats, avoiding localization issues.\nQ: Will the combat log format change again?\nA: We\u2019re always dedicated to improving our game, so we will very likely be making changes again in the future. However, we do realize the frustration that comes with AddOns breaking between patches. Hopefully, this new system will actually reduce how often you need to recode your AddOns, by decoupling AddOn authors from localization changes.\nQ: Can we provide feedback on the new combat log?\nA: Absolutely! We\u2019ll be reading the Test Forums during the 2.4.0 PTR and gathering feedback. The more constructive, clear and concise the feedback is, the more responsive we can be."}

Most constants for plural forms (&lt;CONSTANT_NAME&gt;_P1) are eliminated, and singular ones updated to use new escape sequence.\nChanged APIs.\nName resolution queue.\nInternally, the WoW client is usually fed a bunch of player GUIDs rather than names, which it then has to resolve and keep a cache of. The rate at which these queries are sent out is now artificially throttled to 128 queries every 30 seconds (queued).\nThis affects for instance AH \"getall\" scans (see &lt;a href=\"API%20QueryAuctionItems\"&gt;API QueryAuctionItems&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"API%20GetAuctionItemInfo\"&gt;API GetAuctionItemInfo&lt;/a&gt;). Such a query followed by looping all records in the AH (15000+ for a medium pop server) results in the name resolver queue being tied up for 5-10 minutes. I.e. if you hearth to Shattrath immediately after doing such a scan, everyone you see (that you have not previously seen that session), will be named \"Unknown\" for the next 5-10 minutes."}

An updated usage document can be found at:\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.iriel.org/wow/docs/SecureHeadersGuide-3.1-r1.pdf\"&gt;www.iriel.org/wow/docs/SecureHeadersGuide-3.1-r1.pdf&lt;/a&gt;\nTalent Functions.\nThe 3.1 spec switching code introduces 'talent groups' which are sets of talents and glyphs. These are numbered starting at 1.\nThe following existing API's have changed to provide talent group and talent preview support:\nThese new API's support preview talent management, when groupIndex is not specified it defaults to the active group:\nSlash Commands.\nSwitching Talent Specs.\n /useTalents 1|2 - 1 == primary spec, 2 == offspec\nMacro Conditional for which spec.\n /cast [spec:1] Lightning Bolt; Healing Wave\nOther Info.\nTarget Facing.\nQuote:\n Are we going to see a GetTargetFacing() to the API?\n The math between the two can be a nice combination to some Class Spell deciding addons and Boss Mod updates.\nWe've decided specifically not to expose facing information for other units at this time.\nUnitAura.\nQuote:\n As great as having source ids on this is, it'd be really nice to be able to get the same ids \n from UnitAura(). I get no end of complaints about how the vehicle debuffs aren't showing as theirs. \n While I haven't seen the vehicle fights in Ulduar yet, if they're anything like the Malygos fight \n I\"m sure I won't stop hearing this complaint.\n I know this is sorta a wish list thing but it does seem like a natural progression of giving us \n that info with the combat log that the UI should be able to have access to it for usage by frames.\nWith this in mind, we're making the following change to UnitAura, UnitBuff, and UnitDebuff:\nname, rank, icon, count, debuffType, duration, expirationTime, caster, isStealable = UnitAura(\"unit\", index or [\"name\", \"rank\"][, \"filter\"])\nname, rank, icon, count, debuffType, duration, expirationTime, caster, isStealable = UnitBuff(\"unit\", index or [\"name\", \"rank\"][, \"filter\"])\nname, rank, icon, count, debuffType, duration, expirationTime, caster, isStealable = UnitDebuff(\"unit\", index or [\"name\", \"rank\"][, \"filter\"])\nThe isMine return value has been changed to caster, where caster is the unit token of the unit that applied the aura. This works for all unit tokens, including \"pet\" and its incarnations, \"focus\", and \"target\".\nMost importantly, if the aura was applied by a unit that does not have a token (for instance, a vehicle) but is controlled by one that does (the player), this function will return the token of the unit's controller. In other words, if I'm a shaman and I cast Totem of Wrath, which applies the Totem of Wrath buff, the buff will return the \"player\" token as its caster unit because totems don't have their own unit tokens.\nAuras will also be sorted by the game code in a similar fashion such that the first n auras returned by the unit aura functions will be auras applied by either the player or a unit the player controls or owns (e.g. vehicles, pets, totems).\nEDIT: I previously stated the \"caster\" return for the new UnitAura functions could not be an arena unit token. This is incorrect. The new UnitAura functions will return \"arena\" tokens when appropriate.\nAnimation and Mouse Hover.\nn a different topic - The last PTR build included a bunch of changes to the secure handlers code, they're summarized as follows:\n1) The SetUpAnimation method that was added in 3.0.8 has been removed (since there's now animation support directly in the UI objects) - Note that the animation API's dont require secure code so there's no explicit functions for them in the secure environment.\n2) Many of the information gathering frame methods removed in 3.0.8 have been restored, as has the Show/Hide driver.\n3) There's a new driver for performing auto-hide of frames based on mouse hover. Testing today has revealed that there are some bugs which severely limit its usefulness right now (i.e. it's broken), but it should get fixed in a future build.\nThe hover driver works as follows:\nYou can register a frame for auto-hiding, specifying an expiration time. Once the mouse enters and then leaves the frame, and stays out of the frame for the expiration time, the frame will be automatically hidden. If the mouse re-enters the frame the expiration time resets.\nIf the frame is hidden explicitly (and stays hidden for at least one update cycle) then the auto hide is cancelled.\nIf the frame has moved between when it was registered and when the hiding would occur, the hide is cancelled.\nFinally for complex scenarios you can add additional regions to the hover boundary, by adding additional frames to be included in the 'is over' calculation. For a number of reasons the rects of the frames are captured at point of registration and not re-queried afterwards, neither is the visibility of these additional frames important. This provides a fairly flexible way of supporting more or less arbitrary shapes (though there is an overhead in getting too clever, the driver has to check all of the rects)\nThe methods to control hover registration for normal code (operable when not in combat) are:\nRegisterAutoHide(frame, duration) -- Registers a frame for auto-hiding. The duration is in seconds, any previous registration for that frame is replaced.\nUnregisterAutoHide(frame) -- Cancels the auto-hiding for a frame.\nAddToAutoHide(frame, child) -- Adds the rect of a child to the auto-hide footprint of a frame. This can only be called immediately after registration (before the next OnUpdate cycle).\nAs noted above, the current implementation has a ocuple of bugs which render it largely unusuable right now.\nDEPRECATED isMine().\nQuote:\n Did something change in how the game communicates the owner of Debuffs on a Mob? \n When I ran modless, I found that my DoTs were the first on the mob's frame. \nYes see,\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html%3FtopicId%3D15443405133%26amp%3Bsid%3D1%26amp%3BpageNo%3D3%2353\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\nAll addons using the old isMine return need to be updated to use caster. It's about a five minute change. Which can be done roughly like so:\nlocal name ame, rank, icon, count, debuffType, duration, expirationTime, caster, isStealable = UnitAura(unit, n, \"HELPFUL\")\nlocal isMine = caster == \"player\"\nIf you want to be even more advanced you can do:\n local my_units = {\n player = true,\n pet = true,\n vehicle = true,\n local isMine = my_units[caster]\nWhich will add the ability to pickup your pet and vehicles dots.\nMISSED.\nGetInventoryItemsForSlot().\nbtw the list of new API functions in the first post is missing GetInventoryItemsForSlot. Returns a table (and populates one if passed as second parameter) of base item id's indexed by numerical locations.\n table = GetInventoryItemsForSlot(slot[,table])\nGameTooltip:SetGlyph().\nGameTooltip:SetGlyph() Has been updated with a talentGroup parameter now, too.\nGetPlayerFacing() UPDATE.\nGetPlayerFacing() should be fixed on the PTRs now, and its return has been changed to radians. \n local radians = GetPlayerFacing();"}

The heroes who venture within will face some of the greatest horrors yet seen. But before you burst into the front gate of the citadel, an alternate means of entry beckons. Journey through three separate wings of the new five-player dungeon, Icecrown Citadel: The Frozen Halls, and follow Jaina Proudmoore or Sylvanas Windrunner into the Lich King's domain.\nIcecrown Citadel: The Frozen Throne.\nAll across Northrend, many battles have been fought against the vile Scourge. Countless lives have been lost since the Alliance and the Horde first reached these frozen wastes, but the champions of Azeroth continue to march forward\u2014and Icecrown Citadel, the cornerstone of the Scourge's power and the home base of the Lich King, is their final target. Tirion Fordring and the Argent Crusade have forged an accord with Darion Mograine and the Knights of the Ebon Blade to form the Ashen Verdict. This coalition's strongest combatants, along with the champions of the Alliance and the Horde, will lead the charge against the citadel. In the new Icecrown Citadel raid dungeon, Azeroth's mightiest will face terrifying challenges before ascending to the Frozen Throne, where the Lich King and his runeblade, Frostmourne, await to deliver the heroes to their deaths...\nCross-Realm Dungeon Finder.\nThe Dungeon Finder is now available, providing players with quick and easy access to five-player parties. This feature connects all realms within a battlegroup using an advanced matchmaking system, making it easier for players of all levels to find a dungeon group. In addition, players can reap additional rewards through the Dungeon Finder by choosing the Random option, which is available to both pick-up and pre-formed groups. Check out the User Interface section for more details.\nGetting Started and Quest Tracking.\nA number of changes have been made to World of Warcraft's introductory experience, including updated character and class information at the character-selection screen, more robust tooltips with images, improved health and mana regeneration at lower levels, and adjustments to various classes designed to make it easier for players to get started. In addition, all-new quest-tracking features have been added to assist players in finding objectives, including new interface functionality in the quest log, the map (\"M\" key), and the Objectives pane."}

Some thought it a city, built to herald the glory of its makers; some thought it a vault containing innumerable treasures, perhaps even relics of the mighty Titans themselves. Such speculations were wrong. Beyond Ulduar's gates lies no city, no treasure vault, no final answer to the Titan's mysteries. All that awaits those who dare set foot in Ulduar is a horror even the Titans could not, would not destroy, an evil they merely... contained.\nThis massive facility was constructed by the Titans to imprison an unspeakable threat to all life on Azeroth.

In the original game Shadowmourne could take anywhere from 18-24 weeks to complete and similar to our adjustments to Val'anyr, Hammer of the Ancient Kings, we felt that we wanted to err on the side of fun here rather than creating a situation where guilds may only be able to complete a very small number of Shadowmournes before the next major content update. We expect with these changes the time needed to complete Shadowmourne should be closer to 8-10 weeks. Please note that these adjustments are not final, and we may opt to increase or reduce the rate of acquisition, or make other adjustments as needed.\nNew Collections User Interface.\nPlease note that in order to access your heirlooms in your collections UI, you will need to log into the game world with whichever characters have your existing heirloom items. Simply logging in will automatically add them to your collections for your account.\nPlease note that account data on PTR may not always be perfectly indicative of your account data on live realms, so you may find yourself missing mounts or pets you feel like you should have. The best bet is to copy all of your characters with unique pets, mounts, or heirlooms to PTR and log into each of them at least once to ensure that those collections items are added to your collections interface."}

The original US patch on November 22nd was missing a key skin for boats, so users who patched with the ~20MB version were unable to use any boat. Users who patched in the evening of November 22nd were unaffected as Blizzard had added the missing skin to the patch (~130MB). Unfortunately the streaming client couldn't differentiate between the two separate versions, so on November 29th, this issue was resolved by re-releasing the entire patch to the entire US userbase, followed on November 30th to the EU userbase, with additional content (~162MB). This re-release also released a bug fix for users experiencing disconnection issues on entering a new zone.\nThe Shattering of Azeroth.\nIn the frigid wastes of Northrend, the final battle against the merciless Lich King ended in victory for Azeroth's defenders. Upon returning home, veterans of the unforgiving conflict against the Scourge were showered with praise for their valiant sacrifices, while the honorable dead were mourned. Yet as hope flared anew in the wake of the Lich King's fall, Azeroth's native elemental spirits grew confused and erratic, setting off a series of deadly natural disasters. Horde and Alliance leaders scrambled for clues about the troubling state of the world, but nothing could have prepared them for what was to come.\nWithout warning, the corrupted Dragon Aspect, Deathwing, erupted from the stone heart of Deepholm, the domain of earth within the Elemental Plane. Jagged fissures were torn across the earth, and monstrous waves pummeled coastal regions. From Thousand Needles to the Blasted Lands, the surface of Azeroth was reforged through violent upheavals. Now, the Horde and the Alliance must defend their homes against Deathwing and his minions, burdened by the unsettling fact that the world as they know it has changed... forever."}

Millennia of war and internal strife have stripped these nations of their power, lands, and glory. As Azeroth recovers from the destruction of the Cataclysm, the world's divided troll populations face a bleak future. These dark times have spurred the trolls of the Zandalar, the historically wise and scholarly tribe from which all trolls originated, to take drastic action. They have embarked on a bold crusade to save their race by uniting trolls into a single mighty empire. With the Zandalari's aid, the fallen capitals of the Gurubashi and Amani nations\u2014Zul'Gurub and Zul'Aman\u2014are already rebuilding, replenishing their forces for a bloody campaign to expand their territories.\nYet Vol'jin and his Darkspear trolls are not aligned with the Zandalari. They have sworn to stand with their Horde comrades\u2014and even work with the Alliance\u2014should the trolls ignite a new war on Azeroth. Soon, Vol'jin might be forced to act on his promise, for if the Gurubashi and Amani are left to their own devices, the world will know the legendary strength and savagery of the ancient troll empires once again.\nGuild Challenges.\nBuilt into the Info panel of the guild user interface, Guild Challenges are weekly tasks guild groups can tackle for additional guild experience, achievements, and gold. At the top of the guild user interface Info pane, a new Guild Challenges section is displayed and broken into three categories: Dungeons, Raids, and Rated Battlegrounds. Any guild group will qualify for Guild Challenges credit and there is a set number of times each challenge can be completed per week.\nGuild Finder.\nGuild Finder is a new system designed to enable easier and faster guild recruitment. Guild leaders and players who are looking for a guild to call home will use the Guild Finder to meet one another and begin communications that can lead to a prosperous membership. Whether you're a guild leader looking to fill your ranks or a player looking for a guild that meets your strictest requirements, the Guild Finder provides an easy way to make new friends!\nDungeon Finder: Call to Arms.\nA new system intended to lower queue times, Dungeon Finder: Call to Arms offers additional rewards for queuing as the currently least represented role. To be eligible for the additional rewards you must solo queue for a random level-85 Heroic in the role that is currently being Called to Arms, and complete the dungeon by killing the final boss. Every time you hit these requirements (there is no daily limit) you'll receive a &lt;a href=\"Satchel%20of%20Exotic%20Mysteries\"&gt;goodie bag&lt;/a&gt; that will contain some gold, a chance at a rare gem, a chance at a flask/potion, a good chance of receiving a non-combat pet (including cross faction pets), and a very rare chance at receiving a mount."}

Yet word has now spread that a shadowy &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; agent interrupted the ceremony and struck down Thrall with dark magics... casting his spirit into the four domains of the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Plane\"&gt;Elemental Plane&lt;/a&gt;. If these terrible rumors hold true, the Earthen Ring--indeed, all of Azeroth--has lost one of its greatest champions. \nThe Regrowth and Molten Front.\nAlthough the night elves and their allies repelled &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt;'s initial invasion of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, their work on the sacred mount is far from over. Archdruid &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; has gathered his comrades at the &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary%20of%20Malorne\"&gt;Sanctuary of Malorne&lt;/a&gt; within the newly healed &lt;a href=\"the%20Regrowth\"&gt;Regrowth&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Firelands%20Invasion\"&gt;invade Ragnaros's domain&lt;/a&gt;: the &lt;a href=\"Firelands\"&gt;Firelands&lt;/a&gt;. Once inside the Elemental Plane, Hyjal's defenders hope to establish a permanent stronghold. Yet these plans have come under threat by a ferocious new elemental assault that has swept through the Regrowth. Despite this setback, Hyjal's protectors remain steadfast in their mission, for they know that it is in the molten heart of the Firelands that the fate of Mount Hyjal will be decided.\nThe Firelands.\nThe time to strike at Ragnaros draws near. The battle to protect Mount Hyjal now rages in the depths of Ragnaros's smoldering realm. As territory is gained by Azeroth's defenders and they draw closer to the inner sanctums of the &lt;a href=\"Firelands%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Firelands&lt;/a&gt;, a monumental task awaits. Ragnaros's lair--&lt;a href=\"Sulfuron%20Keep\"&gt;Sulfuron Keep&lt;/a&gt;--is closely guarded by his most loyal servants, including the traitorous &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Flame\"&gt;Druids of the Flame&lt;/a&gt; and their mysterious leader. Yet the brave heroes who have ventured into this ash-choked domain cannot afford to shy away from any danger. The outcome of the battles that lie ahead will determine the very survival of Azeroth. \nDragonwrath, Tarecgosa's Rest.\nUncertainty looms over the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;'s domain, the &lt;a href=\"Nexus\"&gt;Nexus&lt;/a&gt;, as its members struggle to appoint a new leader. Split between the two likeliest successors--&lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arygos\"&gt;Arygos&lt;/a&gt;--the flight has agreed to meet during a rare celestial event known as the &lt;a href=\"Embrace\"&gt;Embrace&lt;/a&gt; in the hopes that a new Aspect will finally be chosen. The bronze dragon &lt;a href=\"Anachronos\"&gt;Anachronos&lt;/a&gt;, however, has detected something sinister at work around the Nexus, threatening to compromise the ceremony. If a hero does not rise to investigate these dark forces and uncover their intentions, Anachronos believes that Azeroth's doom is imminent."}

{"id": "350932", "revid": "26060681", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=350932", "title": "Patch 5.0.4 (class changes)", "text": "The list of class changes in patch 5.0.4 is quite extensive.\nDocumented changes.\nCertainly one of the biggest changes coming in 5.0.4 is the new talent system, and with that comes a ton of changes and new spells and abilities, but before we get to that, a number of changes have been made that can impact how you play your class. These range from minor to major, but almost all specs have altered rotations, and a few have been completely redesigned. Once the patch launches be prepared to spend a little time reacquainting yourself with each ability, and setting your action bars up. Here are just a few of the highlights to be aware of.\nDeath Knight.\nPresences have changed. &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Presence\"&gt;Frost Presence&lt;/a&gt; now increases your &lt;a href=\"Rune%20system%23Runic%20power\"&gt;Runic Power&lt;/a&gt; generation, and each specialization learns a passive effect that should cause that specialization to favor the corresponding Presence for general use. &lt;a href=\"Necrotic%20Strike\"&gt;Necrotic Strike&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the new talent &lt;a href=\"Death%20Siphon\"&gt;Death Siphon&lt;/a&gt;, both cost a &lt;a href=\"Rune%20system%23Runes\"&gt;Death Rune&lt;/a&gt;, meaning that they can only be used when one of your runes has been transformed to Death.\nDruid.\nThe Feral specialization has been split into Feral (for Cat-focused druids) and Guardian (for Bear-focused druids) specializations. Each of the four specializations has a more distinct and different set of tools, but all of the spells available to the specialization are now useful. For example, Feral and Guardian druids can cast &lt;a href=\"Healing%20Touch\"&gt;Healing Touch&lt;/a&gt; for a useful amount of healing, and Balance and Restoration druids can make better use of the &lt;a href=\"Cat%20Form\"&gt;Cat Form&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bear%20Form\"&gt;Bear Form&lt;/a&gt; abilities they have.\nHunter.\nThere is no longer a minimum range for the class. The ranged weapon slot has been removed from the game; hunters now equip their ranged weapon in the main hand weapon slot. Hunters now benefit from &lt;a href=\"Expertise\"&gt;Expertise&lt;/a&gt; as their ranged attacks can be dodged. Any type of pet can now choose any specialization (&lt;a href=\"Pet%20talents%23Ferocity\"&gt;Ferocity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pet%20talents%23Tenacity\"&gt;Tenacity&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Pet%20talents%23Cunning\"&gt;Cunning&lt;/a&gt;).\nMage.\nMages received many changes intended to flesh out rotations and make them more interesting. Arcane mages now have a more complex rotation. Fire mages now have tools to control the random nature of their spells. Frost mages are now considerably stronger at sustained damage dealing, and now viable in PvE. Much of the crowd control and survivability that was unique to Frost has been spread to the whole class, or made available to all specs as talents.\nPaladin.\nPaladins now have several ranged abilities, though remain primarily melee combatants. In-line with streamlining raid buffs (more on that below), &lt;a href=\"Paladin%20auras\"&gt;Auras&lt;/a&gt; have been removed, and the buff focus is now on &lt;a href=\"Seal%20%28ability%29\"&gt;Seals&lt;/a&gt;. Paladins can now store up to 5 &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Power\"&gt;Holy Power&lt;/a&gt; at a time at higher levels, but still can only use up to 3 on each Holy Power spender.\nPriest.\nMana pools are fixed for all casters (more on this below). &lt;a href=\"Chakra\"&gt;Chakra&lt;/a&gt;s are now more similar to warrior &lt;a href=\"stance\"&gt;stance&lt;/a&gt;s. Changes have been made to Discipline to further support the damage absorption playstyle. Shadow priests now have &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Orbs\"&gt;Shadow Orbs&lt;/a&gt; as a resource, which can be generated by some of their basic spells, and spent on either strong damage or crowd control.\nRogue.\nPoisons are now Spellbook abilities that affect both weapons at once. &lt;a href=\"Poisons\"&gt;Poisons&lt;/a&gt; are divided into two categories, Lethal (&lt;a href=\"Deadly%20Poison\"&gt;Deadly&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Wound%20Poison\"&gt;Wound Poison&lt;/a&gt;) and Non-Lethal (the rest), and you may have one poison of each type active at once. Many abilities that used to be restricted to a single specialization are now talents and available to all specializations; so you can have a Combat rogue with &lt;a href=\"Shadowstep\"&gt;Shadowstep&lt;/a&gt; or an Assassination rogue with &lt;a href=\"Cheat%20Death\"&gt;Cheat Death&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Dagger\"&gt;Dagger&lt;/a&gt; speeds have been normalized such that the niche of the \"fast dagger\" intended for the off-hand no longer exists. Any dagger should be fine to equip in either hand.\nShaman.\n&lt;a href=\"Shaman%20totem\"&gt;Totems&lt;/a&gt; no longer provide long-term buffs. Some of the old passive effects are now innately provided by the shaman. Totems instead have short-term situational benefits. In light of this the totem multidrop UI has been removed, though all totem spells are now sorted under draggable elemental flyouts in the Spellbook.\nWarlock.\nEach warlock specialization has a unique secondary resource which allows them temporary surges in power. Affliction warlocks focus more on layering multiple periodic damage effects, and amplifying their effects, and use &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Shard\"&gt;Soul Shard&lt;/a&gt;s rotationally for strong damage, or occasionally for utility as before. Demonology warlocks now have a new &lt;a href=\"Demonic%20Fury\"&gt;Demonic Fury&lt;/a&gt; resource, instead of Soul Shards, which is built by casting their normal spells. Destruction warlocks now use &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Embers\"&gt;Burning Embers&lt;/a&gt; as a resource, which is built up slowly through casting their normal spells, and spent in bursts of massive damage. Warlocks no longer use armor spells, instead gaining additional armor and bonus health passively. All demons deal similar damage and are no longer linked to a specific spec. &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Doomguard\"&gt;Doomguard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Infernal\"&gt;Infernal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Soulstone\"&gt;Soulstone&lt;/a&gt; cooldowns reset upon wiping to a raid or dungeon boss.\nWarrior.\nThe design of &lt;a href=\"Rage\"&gt;Rage&lt;/a&gt; has changed to function more like a valuable resource. Warriors no longer naturally gain Rage from taking damage, but instead generate Rage with their primary attacks, such as &lt;a href=\"Mortal%20Strike\"&gt;Mortal Strike&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bloodthirst\"&gt;Bloodthirst&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Shield%20Slam\"&gt;Shield Slam&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Stance\"&gt;Stance&lt;/a&gt;s also now share a single action bar, rather than changing your action bar, and abilities are no longer restricted by stance. In addition, the benefits of the stances have changed considerably, with &lt;a href=\"Berserker%20Stance\"&gt;Berserker Stance&lt;/a&gt; allowing the warrior to gain some Rage from taking damage, &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Stance\"&gt;Battle Stance&lt;/a&gt; making the warrior gain additional Rage from dealing damage, and &lt;a href=\"Defensive%20Stance\"&gt;Defensive Stance&lt;/a&gt; focused on survivability."}

{"id": "15674", "revid": "40286693", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=15674", "title": "Boss", "text": "Boss is a quite general phrase used for several special types of &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s. The following boss types exist:\nCharacteristics.\nA common characteristic for all bosses is that they have a unique name and appear only once in the game. Bosses are harder to kill than the \"normal\" elite mob of the same level, and almost all bosses are immune to &lt;a href=\"Crowd%20Control\"&gt;Crowd Control&lt;/a&gt;, though some may be susceptible in accordance with their intended mechanics (such as &lt;a href=\"Roar\"&gt;Roar&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt; for example).\nBosses usually have their own special loot tables. Nearly all &lt;a href=\"Bind%20on%20Pickup\"&gt;BOP&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"rare\"&gt;rare&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"epic\"&gt;epic&lt;/a&gt; items in the game stem from boss kills.\nBosses are usually divided into three classes of difficulty:\nThe normal bosses are the most common variety. Every instance features several bosses (usually 3-5 for a 5 man instance). Normal bosses typically have special abilities that require a unique set of tactics to overcome.\n&lt;a href=\"Mini-boss\"&gt;Mini-boss&lt;/a&gt;es are usually found only in instances. Good examples are &lt;a href=\"Gatewatcher%20Gyro-Kill\"&gt;Gatewatcher Gyro-Kill&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gatewatcher%20Iron-Hand\"&gt;Gatewatcher Iron-Hand&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Mechanar\"&gt;Mechanar&lt;/a&gt; - they both hit hard and need a concentrated effort of the party, but are still not as dangerous as a real boss. Minibosses, while tougher than normal elites, don't have the complex special abilities that regular bosses do. They usually have smaller loot tables than other bosses.\nSkull bosses.\n&lt;a href=\"Skull\"&gt;Skull&lt;/a&gt; type bosses are the hardest mobs to kill in WoW. Their level is not displayed as a number, but as a death's head sign. When hovering your mouse over such a mob, the tooltip will read \"Level ?? (Boss)\".\nThese bosses have a \"dynamic\" level - when a numeric level is required for some calculation, they are considered to be 3 levels above the player character involved in that calculation. That is, if both a level 60 warrior and a level 65 druid both tank the same skull type boss, the boss will make crushing blows on the warrior as if it was 63, and on the druid as if it was 68. Similarly, the boss will resist their respective powers as a 63- and 68-level creature would. The first skull type boss that a player may fight with in PvE used to be &lt;a href=\"Pyroguard%20Emberseer\"&gt;Pyroguard Emberseer&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Upper Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;, but as of &lt;a href=\"Patch%203.3.0\"&gt;Patch 3.3.0&lt;/a&gt; this mob is now an ordinary level 60 Elite; &lt;a href=\"The%20Beast\"&gt;The Beast&lt;/a&gt; in the same dungeon is still a skull boss, however. There are also some skull type bosses that a usual player can not fight with, e. g. &lt;a href=\"Nessy\"&gt;Nessy&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Deeprun%20Tram\"&gt;Deeprun Tram&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere is some evidence that with the &lt;a href=\"Patch%203.0.2\"&gt;Patch 3.0.2&lt;/a&gt; changes certain skull-type bosses, such as &lt;a href=\"King%20Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Northrender%27s%20Training%20Dummy\"&gt;Northrender's Training Dummy&lt;/a&gt; are in many ways considered level 83 mobs. Level 70 players have observed that they do far less damage and hit very infrequently compared to what would be expected for their gear, and Crushing Blows (which can now only be inflicted by a monster 4 or more levels higher than you) have been reported.\nSimilarly, there are reports that old world skull-type bosses behave like level 63 mobs even when attacked by a level 80 player. The very high incidence of spell misses from these bosses, when casting spells against the player, is consistent with a mob that is considerably lower level than the player is.\nIn the battlegrounds, skull boss type mobs can also be found. &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Valley\"&gt;Alterac Valley&lt;/a&gt;, for example, features &lt;a href=\"Vanndar%20Stormpike\"&gt;Vanndar Stormpike&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Drek%27Thar\"&gt;Drek'Thar&lt;/a&gt; as skull-type end bosses.\nBoss Fight.\nThe culmination of &lt;a href=\"PvE\"&gt;PvE&lt;/a&gt; are the &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt; level boss fights. Bosses in 5-man instances can be very tough and challenging, and may cause many wipes, but the raid bosses are designed to be a real challenge. They may take several evenings to learn, some may appear to be impossible to kill at first. Coordination and discipline of the whole raid are required, frequently one error by the least of the raid members may immediately cause a &lt;a href=\"wipe\"&gt;wipe&lt;/a&gt;. Many boss fights consist of different phases, where raid members have to pay attention to different aspects of the fight.\nThere are three archetypes of boss fights:\nRaids must develop an understanding of these three types, and players must be aware not to confuse one with the other. Particularly the difference between a battle for survival and a DPS race is sometimes small. Still it's an important difference whether the damage dealers should put their priority on killing the boss, or on their own survival. Of course, whenever this question comes up, the answer is always \"survival first\", because dead = 0 DPS, but that insight seems sometimes hard to learn."}

{"id": "13893", "revid": "4133", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=13893", "title": "Bot", "text": "Also known as , a bot is a method of controlling an in-game character by an automated means that does not require direct interaction from a &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;. Sometimes known as an \"autoplaying game client\", this is strictly prohibited by the \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"Terms%20of%20Use%20Agreement\"&gt;Terms of Use Agreement&lt;/a&gt;. Most often, a bot uses a series of automated &lt;a href=\"macro\"&gt;macro&lt;/a&gt;s to control the character in game.\nIf you suspect a character is being played by a bot, you are encouraged by Blizzard to right-click the name of the suspicious character and report them for cheating. This it the most effective and helpful method for reporting one's suspicions (though it's important to remember they are merely suspicions) as it snapshots a very large amount of information about the character in question. It's also important to note that you will never know about the results of an investigation, as this information is considered, by Blizzard's privacy policy, to be strictly between themselves and the reported party.\nBot uses.\nGold and material farming.\nBots can be used to farm gold, either directly (from gold dropped by mobs), or by proxy (materials that sell for gold). Certain areas in WoW are explored and mapped by botting communities which yield the best rate of gold per hour. But a lot of botters also farm for rare items which have very low drop rates, such as the Hyacinth Macaw from &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt;. Items like these have phenomenally low drop rates (roughly 1 in 1500 for the Macaw) and would be almost impossible to farm without a bot.\nThese methods are also used by &lt;a href=\"gold%20farmer\"&gt;gold farmer&lt;/a&gt;s, professional Warcraft players who sell in-game gold, loot, or services for real-world money. This violates Blizzard's &lt;a href=\"Terms%20of%20Use\"&gt;Terms of Use&lt;/a&gt; agreement and may get both parties banned, however this is most often not the case as Blizzard has more of an interest in stopping the sellers (not the buyers) of gold trading. These farmers automate the process with bots, either to powerlevel characters unattended or to grind mobs continuously for rare drops.\nHonor farming and Leveling.\nBots can also be used for farming honor at the various &lt;a href=\"battleground\"&gt;battleground&lt;/a&gt;s (this is especially true in the current &lt;a href=\"Call%20to%20Arms%20battleground\"&gt;Call to Arms battleground&lt;/a&gt;). Bots such as Pirox and Honorbuddy even include profiles for all the battlegrounds by default.\nOne of the most popular uses of bots, however, is leveling. This can be done in one of three ways; Questing, PvPing, and pure grinding. Some bots support quest profiles, which automatically perform quests (including quest pickup and turn in). PvP leveling is popular during Call to Arms weekends, which provide double-experience for each battleground played. And pure grinding is simply a basic process to kill certain &lt;a href=\"mobs\"&gt;mobs&lt;/a&gt; in certain areas till the player levels.\nFor a long time, from 2005 till 2009, pure grinding was the only method used to level with a bot, since questing profiles hadn't been developed yet, and PvP battlegrounds yielded no experience.\nHistory.\nEarly bots.\nA number of bots developed by numerous people started appearing within a year or two of World of Warcraft's release, such as Openbot. However, the most notable and famous of which was Glider, which first appeared in 2005. Developed by Michael Donnelly, Glider was noted for its particular ease of use, numerous features, and robust community. Its strong community created many profiles to use with the bot, and distributed them freely. After it's initial popularity, Glider was developed into a full featured bot in 2007 and sold for $25. The bot and its community thrived for over 4 years, and over 100,000 copies of Glider were sold (as of 2008). Glider quickly became the de-facto program of choice for most botters.\nGlider lawsuit.\nIn July of 2008, Blizzard filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona against the makers of Glider. The lawsuit alleged that MDY Industries, LLC (the company selling Glider) were liable for copyright infringement based, in part, on the premise that users of the World of Warcraft software are actually \"licensees\" rather than owners of their copy of software. Public Knowledge, a public interest group, publicaly criticized the decision. However, the court found that Glider infringed upon Blizzard's intellectual property and ordered the makers of Glider to pay Blizzard six million dollars. In March 2009, MDY suspended Glider sales and operations, as well as closed their online community. As of September 2009, they are appealing the court decision.\nSecond Generation.\nAfter Glider ceased selling and developing their bot, a number of newer bots started appearing in late 2009, as there was high demand among the botting community for a new bot similar to Glider. Dubbed the \"second generation\" of bots, there were quite a few bots that were developed around that time. However, two bots quickly became favorites, Pirox and Gatherbuddy (aka, Honorbuddy). Both of them are very similar to Glider and offered the same features, control and creation of profiles, and ease of use. Both currently have thriving online communities, as most of the previous members of Glider migrated over.\nSpotting a bot.\nThere are several signs that may indicate that one player in action could be a bot, but many of them have reasonable explanations.\nExplanations.\nYou should always report a bot to a GM if you are bothered by one, or if one is interfering with your normal play. You should include the time you have seen them, where you have seen them, and your reasons that you believe that the player is a bot.\nEffects of botting.\nBots may or may not directly interfere with players' gameplay. A bot farming &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"resource%20node\"&gt;resource node&lt;/a&gt;s in an area may reduce the supply of those things for real players. Some players may simply be bothered by the breaking of immersion in the game world when they believe they recognize a bot, or may value a sense of fairness in which gains should not be achieved without direct human effort. Bots are considered by some to be a threat to a server's virtual economy due to the excessive farming, while others believe that economy normalization is possible on servers with many &lt;a href=\"gold%20farmer\"&gt;gold farmer&lt;/a&gt;s.\nBlizzard actions against bots.\n&lt;a href=\"Nevalistis\"&gt;Nevalistis&lt;/a&gt; answered some of the common complaints that come up every time a player complains about bots not being banned."}

It was covered with primal forestlands.\nBiography.\nAfter both Zang and Naanu had fallen to Grond's attacks, the giant was weakened and scarred by the battle. Botaan sensed its opponent's weakness, but would need more power to defeat the giant. It leeched the life essence from the bodies of Naanu and Zang, absorbing the energies and growing to a monstrous size. It eventually managed to defeat Grond by entangling him in thousands of small vines that gradually burrowed into the cracks on his skin until they tore the wounds open, killing the giant.\nDuring the battle between Grond and the Sporemounds, pieces of their bodies had fallen to the earth and given rise to new types of creatures. From the seeds and roots of Zang, Naanu and Botaan, many unique beings sprouted, the greatest of which were the &lt;a href=\"genesaur\"&gt;genesaur&lt;/a&gt;, while from the largest boulders that had toppled from Grond, the &lt;a href=\"colossal\"&gt;colossal&lt;/a&gt;s arose. Much of the stony debris that had fallen from the giant also contained the elements of fire, air, earth and water, leading to the birth of myriads of &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Aggramar\"&gt;Aggramar&lt;/a&gt;, Grond's creator, was confident that the colossals would be able to destroy Botaan and bring balance to &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, and to aid them he crafted great discs inscribed with &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; runes from the body of Grond and fused them to the colossals, creating armor that granted them strength and resilience. In the meantime, Botaan and the genesaur had begun to retake lands Grond had taken from the &lt;a href=\"Evergrowth\"&gt;Evergrowth&lt;/a&gt;. As Aggramar unleashed the colossals against Botaan, he felt a &lt;a href=\"constellar\"&gt;constellar&lt;/a&gt; dying somewhere in the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;Great Dark Beyond&lt;/a&gt; and left to investigate with the promise he would return one day. He never did.\nThe colossals would never know of Aggramar's &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;ultimate fate&lt;/a&gt; and fully expected their master to return. They were determined to bring balance to Draenor before that happened, but it was an enormous task, for the Evergrowth had enveloped much of the world and Botaan now eclipsed Grond in size. It would have to be drawn away from the Evergrowth if the colossals had any chance of succeeding, and so they drew its ire by hacking way at the forests at the Evergrowth's edge. Botaan rallied the genesaur and they stormed toward the colossals, which retreated into barren ravines and hills that would give them the advantage. Botaan followed them as it saw the colossals as only pale imitations of Grond, and when it left the borders of the Evergrowth the colossals attacked with their full might. The ensuing war shook Draenor for thousands of years, with control of the world constantly moving back and forth between the two forces.\nThe battles over time took their toll on the colossals. Just as they had broken off from Grond, pieces of their bodies that broke off came to life as the &lt;a href=\"magnaron\"&gt;magnaron&lt;/a&gt;. The colossals called on the magnaron to fight the Evergrowth, but they did not obey. Some did indeed battle the forces of Botaan, but not out of loyalty to the colossals, and others simply left the battlefield to seek out areas of volcanic activity. The colossals' numbers were dwindling and they had to take drastic action or they would fail. The titan discs that made their armor contained immense power, and that power would stop the Evergrowth. The colossals piled onto Botaan and unleashed the energy in unison, creating a massive explosion. It shattered the bodies of Botaan and the colossals and sent the pieces all across Draenor. Botaan's death rattle blazed through every root and leaf in the world, causing lush tracts of forests to wither and instantly killing hundreds of genesaur where they stood. For one brief moment, the entirety of the Evergrowth trembled with the shared agony of Botaan's death. Then there was silence. Botaan's demise had destroyed the communal sentience of Draenor's wilds. Unlike the fallen colossals, Botaan's body still contained potent life energies. Wherever fragments of the being fell to the earth, forests and jungles arose, while the bulk of its body formed a vibrant region later known as &lt;a href=\"Farahlon\"&gt;Farahlon&lt;/a&gt;.\nTaala.\nMany years later, a &lt;a href=\"treant\"&gt;treant&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href=\"Gnarlgar\"&gt;Gnarlgar&lt;/a&gt; began to see the &lt;a href=\"arakkoa\"&gt;arakkoa&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;a href=\"Apexis\"&gt;Apexis&lt;/a&gt; civilization as an immense affront to nature and an even greater threat to the primals than the breakers. Gnarlgar departed its home in &lt;a href=\"Talador\"&gt;Talador&lt;/a&gt; in search of a weapon to use against the Apexis, and discovered a massive fossilized root - one of the last remaining intact pieces of Botaan's body. The treant returned to Talador and rallied the botani, telling them that they would use the root to craft a new Sporemound, greater than any that had come before it, to cast the Apexis from their lofty spire. Using a great ritual and thousands of botani sacrifices, the enormous Sporemound &lt;a href=\"Taala\"&gt;Taala&lt;/a&gt; was born, but it was eventually destroyed by the arakkoan superweapon known as the &lt;a href=\"Breath%20of%20Rukhmar\"&gt;Breath of Rukhmar&lt;/a&gt;, forever extinguishing the Evergrowth."}
{"id": "404734", "revid": "46586549", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=404734", "title": "Botani", "text": "The botani are a race of intelligent, bark-skinned humanoids native to &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;. They are members of the group of creatures known as the &lt;a href=\"Primals\"&gt;Primals&lt;/a&gt;, who wage an eternal war against the stone giants known as the &lt;a href=\"Breakers\"&gt;Breakers&lt;/a&gt; and seek to establish dominance over them and all other organic life. The botani fervently serve the enormous &lt;a href=\"genesaur\"&gt;genesaur&lt;/a&gt;, which they worship as gods, and are notorious for their ability to &lt;a href=\"infested\"&gt;infest&lt;/a&gt; humanoid races, turning them into shambling slaves.\nThe botani were seemingly hunted to extinction by the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt; in the main universe, but they are still present in the &lt;a href=\"Draenor%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Draenor of an alternate timeline&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nIn the aftermath of &lt;a href=\"Botaan\"&gt;Botaan&lt;/a&gt;'s destruction, spores from the &lt;a href=\"Sporemound\"&gt;Sporemound&lt;/a&gt;'s corpse settled in the wilds, giving sentience to existing forms of plants. The jungles stirred as new beings took shape and walked the land. The most intelligent and prolific of these were the botani, who spread through &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;'s wilderness. Faint memories of the &lt;a href=\"Evergrowth\"&gt;Evergrowth&lt;/a&gt; lingered in their minds, but they did not know the full truth of the Sporemounds or their battles with &lt;a href=\"Grond\"&gt;Grond&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"colossal\"&gt;colossal&lt;/a&gt;s. Even so, they worshipped their &lt;a href=\"genesaur\"&gt;genesaur&lt;/a&gt; relatives as gods, seeing them as echoes of the great Sporemounds. The botani, genesaur and other plant-creatures were known collectively as the &lt;a href=\"Primals\"&gt;Primals&lt;/a&gt;, and their devotion to protecting the forestlands inevitably caused them to clash with the &lt;a href=\"Breakers\"&gt;Breakers&lt;/a&gt;, the descendants of Grond. For many long ages, the two factions engaged in sporadic battles with one another, neither side ever managing to destroy the other.\nThe birth of Taala.\n2,000 years before the opening of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"treant\"&gt;treant&lt;/a&gt; known as &lt;a href=\"Gnarlgar\"&gt;Gnarlgar&lt;/a&gt; wandered the forests of &lt;a href=\"Terokkar%20Forest\"&gt;Talador&lt;/a&gt;, strengthening its fellow Primals and honing its own abilities to influence the minds of its kin. Gnarlgar found the botani to be the most promising of the world's Primals and knew that they could become a force of extraordinary might if cultivated properly. Gnarlgar became the botani's caretaker, refining their culture and teaching them the truth about the Sporemounds, as well as convincing them that they would one day restore the Evergrowth to its former glory. Though the botani existed throughout Draenor, those in Talador were the most numerous and advanced. They became the heart of their race's culture. Gnarlgar taught Talador's botani unique ways to harness nature magic, and they created pools of potent nature energies to transfer the spirits of fallen genesaur into new bodies.\nWhile the botani battled the Breakers, Gnarlgar became aware of the &lt;a href=\"arakkoa\"&gt;arakkoa&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;a href=\"Apexis\"&gt;Apexis&lt;/a&gt; civilization, which it saw as an immense affront to nature and an even greater threat than the Breakers. After discovering a massive fossilized root \u2014 one of the last remaining pieces of Botaan \u2014 the treant rallied the botani and proclaimed that to revive the Evergrowth, they must first defeat the Apexis. The treant then told its followers that they would use the root to craft a new Sporemound, greater than any that had come before it, to cast the Apexis from their lofty spire. Gnarlgar planted the root deep within Talador and began a great ritual to nourish it. Thousands of botani willingly sacrificed themselves, and Gnarlgar infused their spirits into the root. Gradually, a Sporemound took shape and Gnarlgar named it &lt;a href=\"Taala\"&gt;Taala&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, the Primals prepared for war, with the botani awakening new genesaur from their birthing pools while Gnarlgar created a group of living trees known as the &lt;a href=\"Gnarled\"&gt;Gnarled&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter Taala finally awakened, the botani marched on the Apexis spire along with the other Primals, but much like their kin, thousands of them were incinerated by the &lt;a href=\"Breath%20of%20Rukhmar\"&gt;Breath of Rukhmar&lt;/a&gt;.\nRise of the Horde.\nThousands of years later, the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Orcish Horde&lt;/a&gt; marched across Draenor. &lt;a href=\"Kilrogg%20Deadeye\"&gt;Kilrogg Deadeye&lt;/a&gt; led his &lt;a href=\"Bleeding%20Hollow%20clan\"&gt;Bleeding Hollow clan&lt;/a&gt; on a campaign into the lush, isolated island of &lt;a href=\"Farahlon\"&gt;Farahlon&lt;/a&gt;, the last bastion of the Primals. After crossing the ocean with the help of &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt; shipwrights, orc &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s leeched life from the Primals and used the stolen power to set the forests ablaze while Kilrogg and his army slaughtered every botani and genesaur they could find.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nOn the &lt;a href=\"Draenor%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;alternate Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, the botani are found primarily in &lt;a href=\"Gorgrond\"&gt;Gorgrond&lt;/a&gt;, mainly as servants of the genesaur &lt;a href=\"Iyu\"&gt;Iyu&lt;/a&gt;. Since the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt; and the Breakers began working together, the botani have become even more aggressive \u2013 &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; both have been disappearing of late into dense botani enclaves. The botani of the &lt;a href=\"Blademoon%20Bloom\"&gt;Blademoon Bloom&lt;/a&gt; in , once revered by the draenei, began attacking wandering travelers and dragging their bodies back into the bloom to fertilize a &lt;a href=\"Blooming%20Genesaur\"&gt;growing genesaur&lt;/a&gt;. Luckily, the &lt;a href=\"rangari\"&gt;rangari&lt;/a&gt; were able to kill the genesaur with the aid of an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; before it managed to grow to maturity.\nThey claimed the abandoned &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"fortress\"&gt;fortress&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Overlook%20Ruins\"&gt;Overlook Ruins&lt;/a&gt; as a new incubator.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nAfter the of the alternate Draenor were transported to the main universe &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, some botani were caught in &lt;a href=\"Eitrigg\"&gt;Eitrigg&lt;/a&gt;'s teleportation spell and could be seen running from &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt; toward the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Barrens\"&gt;Northern Barrens&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription and culture.\nSlender, deliberate, and calculating, these enigmatic living trees single-mindedly tend to the wilds of Draenor. Wise in the ancient ways, they seek lost artifacts of bygone ages to empower the explosive growth of their territory, often at the expense of Draenor's other sentient denizens. The faint memories of the &lt;a href=\"Evergrowth\"&gt;Evergrowth&lt;/a&gt; that lingered in the minds of the ancient botani had a profound impact on their culture. The bark-skinned beings reject the sense of self, believing that their individual souls are part of a collective spirit interlinking all plant life on Draenor.\nThe botani revere the enormous &lt;a href=\"genesaur\"&gt;genesaur&lt;/a&gt; as gods, seeing them as echoes of the great &lt;a href=\"Sporemound\"&gt;Sporemound&lt;/a&gt;s, and only the highest-ranking botani (such as the &lt;a href=\"Voice%20of%20Iyu\"&gt;Voice of Iyu&lt;/a&gt;) may speak on behalf of the lumbering creatures. Using birthing pools of potent nature energies, the botani are able to transfer the spirits of fallen genesaur into new bodies.\nThe botani use &lt;a href=\"ravager%20wasp\"&gt;wasps&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"ravager\"&gt;ravager&lt;/a&gt;s to pollinate their blooms. The pollen these insects carry has a number of powerful properties, and the &lt;a href=\"Laughing%20Skull%20Orcs\"&gt;Laughing Skull&lt;/a&gt; orcs who dwell in Gorgrond have long learned a few secrets of the botani that they can use to grow their own plants. With a dash of a few secret ingredients one can feed an army with the food grown from the pollen, if one knows the secret ways, and there is no such thing as a hungry Laughing Skull for this reason.\nInfestation and warfare.\nFor tens of thousands of years the botani have clashed against the mightiest forces of the world. The botani have long cultured unique plantlife in their irrigated ponds or tree dwellings, but far more terrifying is their ability to cultivate flora within a living host. Unwary natives are captured and seeded in an agonizing process that alters their physical makeup and takes complete control over their bodies, turning them into mindless walking saplings. The entire process is poorly understood, but these grisly &lt;a href=\"infested\"&gt;infested&lt;/a&gt; can be seen guarding botani enclaves or shambling ahead of the botani host as gruesome cannon fodder whose corpses eventually seed new terrain. &lt;a href=\"Phylarch%20the%20Evergreen\"&gt;Phylarch the Evergreen&lt;/a&gt; claims to be the inventor of this technique. &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"ogron\"&gt;ogron&lt;/a&gt; are known victims of this process, but the botani have also been known to create &lt;a href=\"mandragora\"&gt;mandragora&lt;/a&gt;s by infecting &lt;a href=\"riverbeast\"&gt;riverbeast&lt;/a&gt;s with some kind of strange flesh-eating plant.\nPrisoners that aren't infested are instead fattened up with fruit, honey and mead before being turned into mulch. The Laughing Skull orcs always burn their dead to prevent them from being raised and infested.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Tangleheart\"&gt;Tangleheart&lt;/a&gt;, the botani use &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Growth%20Sap\"&gt;a special sap&lt;/a&gt; to quickly grow &lt;a href=\"Draenor%20ancient\"&gt;ancients&lt;/a&gt; to full size. The botani known as &lt;a href=\"Ontogen%20the%20Harvester\"&gt;Ontogen the Harvester&lt;/a&gt; works with the ancient saplings, imbuing them with anger and hatred toward creatures unlike them."}

This is also the location of Kael'thas' commander: &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Sarannis\"&gt;Commander Sarannis&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nThe Botanica was once used by the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; to gather samples of unusual wildlife from across &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, keeping the specimens safe behind special safeguards. When &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt; and his blood elves seized &lt;a href=\"Tempest%20Keep\"&gt;Tempest Keep&lt;/a&gt; from the naaru, they immediately set to work in order to unlock the power hidden among the &lt;a href=\"Primals\"&gt;native plant life&lt;/a&gt; of Outland and reveal the naaru's secrets. Now, blood elf scientists carry out experiments on the flora in Outland, how naaru technology can be used to create and manipulate living beings, and how all this can grant the blood elves new powers.\nRed crystals similar to those of &lt;a href=\"Bloodmyst%20Isle\"&gt;Bloodmyst Isle&lt;/a&gt; can be found in &lt;a href=\"Thorngrin%20the%20Tender\"&gt;Thorngrin the Tender&lt;/a&gt;'s wing, indicating that the &lt;a href=\"Sunseekers\"&gt;Sunseekers&lt;/a&gt; might be looking into ways to manipulate their radiations. It is also shown that the blood elves have managed to boost the growth of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Thalassian&lt;/a&gt; trees that they brought with them, and are also researching &lt;a href=\"Olemba%20tree\"&gt;Olemba tree&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Zangarmarsh\"&gt;Zangarmarsh&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Zangar%20encroachment\"&gt;fungi&lt;/a&gt;.\nDungeon Journal.\n\"The mighty &lt;a href=\"Tempest%20Keep\"&gt;Tempest Keep&lt;/a&gt; was created by the enigmatic &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt;: sentient beings of pure energy and the sworn enemies of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to serving as a base of operations for the naaru, the structure itself possesses the technology to teleport through alternate dimensions, traveling from one location to another in the blink of an eye. \"\nGeography.\nAll of the bosses in the Botanica are optional; you can fairly easily reach without killing a single one of them. You will, however, still have to clear a majority of the trash, so this won't save an enormous amount of time."}

Almost all of his forces were killed in the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, and were soon replaced by &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt; soldiers from &lt;a href=\"Northwatch%20Hold\"&gt;Northwatch&lt;/a&gt;, aiming to maintain this stubborn Alliance foothold in Durotar.\nHistory.\nDespite the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; peace agreement between &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Lady Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, the founder of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; city of &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore Isle&lt;/a&gt;, both orcs and &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s retained deep suspicions of the other, many holding fast to old hatreds. Jania's father &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Grand Admiral Daelin Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; led his fleet from &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; to the shores of &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;, and proceeded to wage renewed war against the orcs. The Admiral hastily constructed Tiragarde Keep as part of his offensive.\nThough Admiral Proudmoore was ultimately slain in the Horde's assault led by &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt; on Theramore, a set of special orders written by the Admiral before his departure from Kul Tiras later come to light. With no word from Proudmoore's fleet since their arrival on &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20Benedict\"&gt;Lieutenant Benedict&lt;/a&gt; was dispatched to retake the &lt;a href=\"keep\"&gt;keep&lt;/a&gt; and continue the fight against the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s. It was also said that &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20Alverold\"&gt;Lieutenant Alverold&lt;/a&gt;, sent on a mission of exploration, was destined to return to assist in this task.\nThe damaged keep still stands, a gleaming white structure distinctly out of place among the crimson rocks of Durotar. Prior to the &lt;a href=\"Shattering\"&gt;Shattering&lt;/a&gt;, Benedict maintained control of this small but strategic foothold despite the efforts of &lt;a href=\"Razor%20Hill\"&gt;Razor Hill&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20Marine\"&gt;Kul Tiras Marine&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20Sailor\"&gt;Sailors&lt;/a&gt; patrolling the crumbling ramparts were well-trained and filled with contempt for the Horde. Ever a thorn in the Horde's side, young warriors of the Horde were repeatedly sent to harass and cut their teeth against the entrenched humans, but were never able to rout them from Durotar. Sometimes, soldiers from the keep robbed Razor Hill.\nCataclysm.\nThe shore was wiped out by the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, along with much of Tiragarde Keep and many of the marines and sailors. The area is currently littered with the corpses of Benedict's Kul Tiras forces, although one soldier survives atop a crow's nest of a beached ship. Tiragarde keep is now commanded by &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20Palliter\"&gt;Lieutenant Palliter&lt;/a&gt; and filled with soldiers from &lt;a href=\"Northwatch%20Hold\"&gt;Northwatch Hold&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Gar%27thok\"&gt;Gar'thok&lt;/a&gt; of Razor Hill now sends young orc and &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; warriors to combat the new threat posed by the &lt;a href=\"Northwatch%20Expeditionary%20Force\"&gt;Northwatch Expeditionary Force&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, &lt;a href=\"Gail%20Nozzywig\"&gt;Gail Nozzywig&lt;/a&gt; requests that adventurers bring her the abandoned treasure of the former Kul Tiras occupants.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; forces were sent to salvage and rebuild Tiragarde Keep. The &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; attacked the keep in order to scour the ruins from the land and &lt;a href=\"Keep%20Watcher%20Kerry\"&gt;Keep Watcher Kerry&lt;/a&gt; was encountered by the Horde troops, while the Alliance encountered &lt;a href=\"Tarshaw%20Jaggedscar\"&gt;Tarshaw Jaggedscar&lt;/a&gt;. The Horde tried to stop Kerry from restoring the keep but failed. Even after the Fourth War, the Northwatch Expeditionary Unit was guarding and rebuilding the keep.\nIn the RPG.\nTiragarde Keep is the only &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; outpost in &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;. These soldiers loyal to &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Admiral Daelin Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, father of &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, man Tiragarde (much like &lt;a href=\"Northwatch%20Hold\"&gt;Northwatch Hold&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt;). Since Daelin's death, they have continued their crusade against the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. While Jaina does not approve of their actions, the majority of the Alliance accepts the dangerous philosophy of these troops. Although there are some who view them as being almost as fanatical and stupid as the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt;. It might seem Thrall has not crushed this group out of mercy, and that may prove a strategic mistake."}

It is a realm of people in touch with both the land and the sea. Inland, the mountains and forests provide prime hunting grounds. A vast coastline borders Tiragarde Sound to the south, west, and east, where those brave enough can fish, boat, swim, and hunt for treasure.\nTiragarde Sound sits on an inlet in the middle of Kul Tiras. It connects the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt; from one side of the island to the other, and is a connection point for all the major regions of Kul Tiras.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

As long as such an artifact exists, there is a chance that &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; can become a man again!\nMeet me at the cathedral's entrance. Be sure to bring a cultist's hood\u2014we're going incognito. \nProgress.\nLight be with you, &lt;name&gt;.\nCompletion.\nI do not view what we just went through as a failure, &lt;name&gt;... quite the opposite.\nBy allowing me to peer into his heart, you allowed me to confirm what I needed to know. There is no &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; anymore\u2014there is only the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;.\nNotes.\nThis quest commonly bugs out, with Tirion and his adds frozen inside. This was a known issue as of January 2009.\nCultist Acolytes are patrolling up and down the stairs of the Cathedral of Darkness, just to the northwest of Icecrown Citadel. Tirion is up the stairs to the right, by the bonfire with the other disguised crusaders.\nThe Lich King ends up coming and seeing through the player's and Tirion's disguises. Tirion approaches him and deems his heart to be unredeemable and thusly strikes it down. Destroying the Lich King's heart causes the Lich King to drop to 30% of his health, and also causes Tirion to be knocked out. &lt;a href=\"Darion%20Mograine\"&gt;Darion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Koltira%20Deathweaver\"&gt;Koltira&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thassarian\"&gt;Thassarian&lt;/a&gt;, and some other random &lt;a href=\"death%20knights\"&gt;death knights&lt;/a&gt; end up coming to save Tirion and the player from a rather large number of elite mobs. They will open an \"Escape Portal\" - Take it, or else the Lich King will instantly kill the player after he casts a 8 second spell called \"Lich King's Fury\".\nTo complete the quest, return to Tirion at the Crusaders' Pinnacle. He also explains his reasoning for destroying Arthas' heart. As the title sugests, he assumes that The Lich King didn't destroy Arthas' heart because it could affect him in a bad way and even without anything else to support his assumption, Tirion takes the risk and destroys the frozen organ.\nWarning: DO NOT drop the Cultist Disguise buff while inside the Cathedral. An undisguised player will aggro the room and wind up dead fairly quickly. Let the death knights and crusaders do the killing. It's much more enjoyable to see Darion Mograine absolutely dismantle the cultists anyways.\nDialogue.\nAccording to the combat log, Lich King's Fury \"instantly kills\" anyone it hits, rather than actually doing damage. If you use &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Reflection\"&gt;Spell Reflection&lt;/a&gt; on it, you will still get the message in your combat log, but will not actually die. However, the Lich King will immediately teleport away."}

With the help of &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s, he convinced his son to leave the ranks of the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt;, however, &lt;a href=\"Taelan%20Fordring\"&gt;Taelan&lt;/a&gt; was then killed for his betrayal. After avenging him, Tirion committed himself to reform the Order of the Silver Hand in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; and to put an end to all the evil that plagues &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nPrior to the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, Tirion and his knights intervened during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Second Battle for Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt;, where they repelled the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Death%20Knights%20of%20Acherus\"&gt;Death Knights of Acherus&lt;/a&gt;. During the battle, Tirion came into possession of the &lt;a href=\"Ashbringer\"&gt;Ashbringer&lt;/a&gt;, purified it and repelled the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; himself from the holy grounds. Following their victory, Tirion assumed leadership over the Argent Dawn and founded the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; by uniting the Knights of the Silver Hand and the Argent Dawn, and as their &lt;a href=\"Highlord\"&gt;Highlord&lt;/a&gt;, led them in a holy crusade to annihilate the Scourge in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith the cooperation of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt;, led by Highlord Darion Mograine, he founded the &lt;a href=\"Ashen%20Verdict\"&gt;Ashen Verdict&lt;/a&gt; for their final assault against &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt;. During the final battle, Tirion confronted the Dark Lord of the Scourge and managed to shatter &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt; with the Ashbringer, ending its reign of terror. After being warned by the ghost of &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;King Terenas Menethil II&lt;/a&gt;, Tirion attempted to take &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt;' place in order to keep the Scourge under control, but was replaced by the sacrifice of &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt;, whom he crowned with the &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Helm of Domination&lt;/a&gt;. After their victory in Northrend, Tirion Fordring returned to Lordaeron where the Argent Crusade repelled the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; and resumed control of Hearthglen, before beginning their work to revitalize the &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands\"&gt;Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; began their &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt; of Azeroth, Tirion led the Argent Crusade's forces as the first line of defense against the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s during the disastrous &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for the Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;. During the assault, he was captured and \"killed\" by in order to break the morale of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, however, he survived and was tortured until a &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;Champion of the Light&lt;/a&gt; came to rescue him. In his final moments, he passed the Ashbringer to his savior and asked them to defeat the Legion, before dying of his injuries.\nBiography.\nThe Second War.\nOriginally a &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, though he had not been born a noble, his enthusiasm and honor had won him to be &lt;a href=\"knight\"&gt;knight&lt;/a&gt;ed at the age of 18 years old. Tirion served his &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;king&lt;/a&gt; with undying loyalty and won a great deal of respect from his superiors. Years later, renowned for his zeal and resilience, he eventually found faith and got closer to the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Church of the Light&lt;/a&gt;, studying under the guidance of Archbishop &lt;a href=\"Alonsus%20Faol\"&gt;Alonsus Faol&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, he was chosen by the Archbishop as one of the four candidates from Lordaeron to form the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Order of the Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;, along with &lt;a href=\"Uther\"&gt;Uther&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Saidan%20Dathrohan\"&gt;Saidan Dathrohan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Gavinrad%20the%20Dire\"&gt;Gavinrad the Dire&lt;/a&gt;. While traveling with &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt;'s army, Tirion and the others were trained vigorously day and night by Faol, who taught them how to use the Light to comfort their allies, to smite their enemies and how to lead by example, as they would be more than weapons but beacons of hope to guide the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. As their training progressed, Faol presented each of the paladins with enchanted &lt;a href=\"libram\"&gt;libram&lt;/a&gt;s that were among the church's most ancient relics. Each libram represented a core trait of the Silver Hand that Faol challenged his students to become the living embodiment of, and Tirion was given the Libram of Retribution.\nDuring his ceremony of induction into the order, Tirion received his holy hammer and silver plates from Saidan, who was one of his closest friends, before being blessed and empowered by the holy powers of the &lt;a href=\"cleric\"&gt;cleric&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Brotherhood%20of%20Northshire\"&gt;Brotherhood of Northshire&lt;/a&gt; and the knights of the Silver Hand present in &lt;a href=\"Alonsus%20Chapel\"&gt;Alonsus Chapel&lt;/a&gt;.\nThereafter, Tirion fought on many battlefields. During the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Siege of Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;, he killed an &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt; that was about to attack &lt;a href=\"Alexandros%20Mograine\"&gt;Alexandros Mograine&lt;/a&gt;. He amicably mocked his friend, telling him to be more careful in the future as he wouldn't be around forever, before heading back to fight their enemies.\nFollowing the Second War, he, Uther, Saidan, and Gavinrad were present during the introduction ceremony in the order of &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Prince Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;, at the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;. It was the first time they had all been together after many years, and even aging, Tirion was still powerful and graceful as the governor of &lt;a href=\"Hearthglen\"&gt;Hearthglen&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Taelan%20Fordring\"&gt;Taelan&lt;/a&gt; was still a child, Tirion and &lt;a href=\"Karandra%20Fordring\"&gt;Karandra&lt;/a&gt; would often visit &lt;a href=\"Caer%20Darrow\"&gt;Caer Darrow&lt;/a&gt; on family excursions. On their last visit, an artist by the name of &lt;a href=\"Renfray\"&gt;Renfray&lt;/a&gt; painted a portrait of them poised along the beachside. It was his fondest memory, for it was at that moment, with his wife and son in his arms, that he felt a bond of love and family that he would never know again.\nOf Blood and Honor.\nYears later, as the governor of the Alliance principality of Hearthglen, Tirion lived a comfortable life, well-respected by his subjects and loved by his wife &lt;a href=\"Karandra%20Fordring\"&gt;Karanda&lt;/a&gt; and son Taelan. Both a great warrior and a just ruler, Tirion was renowned throughout the Kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. In spite of his acclaimed military prowess, Tirion's experience as a &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;ish invasions had taught him to value peace. After the wars were over, Tirion prayed every night that no conflict would ever bring harm to his subjects again. The &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Myranda%20the%20Hag\"&gt;Myranda&lt;/a&gt; served as his most trusted advisor.\nOne day, Tirion encountered an old orc hermit living in an abandoned tower. The two immediately battled and traded blows until a piece of the ruined tower collapsed on Tirion, knocking him senseless. He awoke in his bed days later and discovered that he had been found badly beaten with his ribs broken and his arm that had been sliced open, tied to his saddle, and had been healed by his ambitious second, &lt;a href=\"Barthilas\"&gt;Barthilas&lt;/a&gt;.\nRealizing that the orc had saved him from the ruins, Tirion set out and retraced his steps back to the tower. The orc &lt;a href=\"Eitrigg\"&gt;Eitrigg&lt;/a&gt; told Tirion that, before the coming to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, the orcs had been a noble society rooted in &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;ism. After the war, he left the corrupt &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Tirion, seeing great honor in Eitrigg, promised to keep his existence a secret, returning to his people and informing them that the orc had been dealt with and was not a threat.\nHowever, Barthilas was not so confident, and called &lt;a href=\"Saidan%20Dathrohan\"&gt;Lord Commander Saidan Dathrohan&lt;/a&gt; to come and settle the matter himself. Dathrohan picked up the trail and led a group of soldiers and hunters into the woods, where they found Eitrigg. During the orc's capture, Tirion fought against Dathrohan's men, prompting Barthilas to gleefully note that his actions were treasonous.\nConsequently, Tirion was brought to &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt; to stand &lt;a href=\"Major%20trial\"&gt;trial&lt;/a&gt;, and despite the pleas of both Karandra and his close friend &lt;a href=\"Arden\"&gt;Captain Arden&lt;/a&gt; to forget his honor and tell the jury what they wanted to hear, Tirion, hoping to be an example to his son, told the court exactly what had happened. Ultimately, the jury of Admiral &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Daelin Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, Arch-Mage &lt;a href=\"Antonidas\"&gt;Antonidas&lt;/a&gt;, Archbishop &lt;a href=\"Alonsus%20Faol\"&gt;Alonsus Faol&lt;/a&gt;, and Prince &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; decided that since Tirion had assaulted &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; soldiers, he could no longer be a member of the Knights of the Silver Hand and was doomed to exile. Therefore, &lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther the Lightbringer&lt;/a&gt; performed a &lt;a href=\"Excommunication\"&gt;ceremony to strip&lt;/a&gt; Tirion of his powers and sent him home to gather some supplies. However, as the last token of respect to his friend, Uther did not exile Tirion's family.\nAfter returning home, he bid farewell to his son and wife. Desperate to prevent Eitrigg from being executed for war crimes, Tirion rode back to Stratholme, where he attacked Eitrigg's guards. Surprised, they still managed to subdue him, until a group of orcs stormed into the city. Tirion used the distraction to free Eitrigg and flee the city. When they were in the wilds, Tirion saw that Eitrigg was near death, and did the only thing he could do; call upon the powers of the Light to heal the orc who had saved him even if his holy blessings have been stripped from his body. To his surprise, he still had his connection with the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; and through it the blessed powers to save Eitrigg.\nThey abruptly found themselves surrounded by orcs and a new &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, who approached Eitrigg and invited him back into the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 which had since reverted back to its shamanistic roots once more. Eitrigg was thrilled to accept. Before he left with his people, Eitrigg proclaimed that Tirion and he were brothers, bound by blood and honor. Through his actions, Tirion also gained the undying respect of Thrall, one of the few humans he holds in such high regard, and which continues to this day.\nFor years Tirion remained in Lordaeron but lived as a hermit and an outcast of society. While his wife told their son that he had died, and even took him to a false grave at the &lt;a href=\"Undercroft\"&gt;Undercroft&lt;/a&gt; where Taelan buried the toy warhammer his father had given him in his memory, Tirion nevertheless left letters of farewell and love to his son. At some point, he was secretly present at the introduction ceremony of his son Taelan into the Silver Hand, who later became the lord of Mardenholde Keep. When the ceremony was over, he was noticed by his friend Arden, who did not take any action as he was pleased to see him.\nThe Ashbringer.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, at the behest of &lt;a href=\"High%20Inquisitor%20Fairbanks\"&gt;Fairbanks&lt;/a&gt;' ghost, &lt;a href=\"Darion%20Mograine\"&gt;Darion Mograine&lt;/a&gt; met Tirion who threatened him with his hammer, in order to know the reason for coming of the young man. At first reluctant, he finally agreed to listen to the youngest son of Alexandros Mograine in exchange for fresh rations, and because he was a brother-in-arms of the once legendary paladin.\nAfter listening to Darion's story, he expressed his doubts about the veracity of the story, considering that Alexandros was a model of purity and that it was difficult to imagine his soul damned. He nevertheless agreed to take the &lt;a href=\"Ashbringer\"&gt;Corrupted Ashbringer&lt;/a&gt; in hand, asking the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; to reveal the truth. Horrified by what he saw, he announced that the sword was corrupted and that there was almost nothing left of Alexandros' soul, before advising Darion to give up as he had done all he could. Faced with Darion's attempts to convince him to help him fight the Scourge, Tirion mocked him before becoming upset when he heard the mention of his son and rumors of his \"betrayal\". He finally agreed to tell his story, specifically about his meeting with &lt;a href=\"Eitrigg\"&gt;Eitrigg&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Excommunication\"&gt;excommunication&lt;/a&gt; of the Silver Hand. He also expressed his disgust for what is the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; and the place of his son among their ranks, blind to the horrors that the crusade creates in its path.\nBefore Darion left, he announced after consideration that the only way to free Alexandros' soul would be through an act of love stronger than the act of treachery that murdered his father and defiled the weapon, but warned him that such an act would be the ultimate test of faith. When Darion tried to convince him to join the Argent Dawn, in order to inspire them just as he inspired many paladins in the past, Tirion refused and explained that his time was behind. Nevertheless, he meditated on the words of the young man who told him that he could still become the hero he once was.\nA few days later, encouraged by Darion's words, Tirion participated in the first battle for &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; and his undead armies, bringing new hope to the Argent Dawn troops. Towards the end of the battle, he watched in horror as Darion impaled himself with the Asbringer, freeing Alexandros' soul at the cost of his life, and bringing victory to the living.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nYears later, Tirion was still present at his cottage on the shores of the &lt;a href=\"Thondroril%20River\"&gt;Thondroril River&lt;/a&gt;, near the southwestern end of &lt;a href=\"Terrorweb%20Tunnel\"&gt;Terrorweb Tunnel&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Eastern Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;. Accompanied by his trusty horse &lt;a href=\"Mirador\"&gt;Mirador&lt;/a&gt;, he met &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s, and asked for their help (without revealing his identity) to eliminate some of the fauna infected by the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;Plague of Undeath&lt;/a&gt;, but also to bring him non-infected rations to survive the winter, and to destroy the undead nuisances in the region. He readily accepted help from both the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; adventurers, following his assertions that race does not dictate honor, and from what he learned from his encounter with Eitrigg.\nOnce certain that he could trust them, whom he judged to be people of integrity and honor, he revealed his identity as well as his past, especially before and after his exile, but also that he was dismayed to find later that his son, &lt;a href=\"Taelan%20Fordring\"&gt;Taelan&lt;/a&gt;, took his place as lord of Mardenholde but joined the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt;, and even became their highlord. Knowing his son better than anyone, he announced that he wanted to get Taelan out of this situation, and help him to remember what is really noble and honorable. In order to help Taelan regain what he has lost, and to convince him to leave the Scarlet Crusade, Tirion sent the adventurers to the &lt;a href=\"Undercroft\"&gt;Undercroft&lt;/a&gt; to retrieve &lt;a href=\"%3ATaelan%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;:Taelan's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;, then to &lt;a href=\"Northdale\"&gt;Northdale&lt;/a&gt; to retrieve his &lt;a href=\"Symbol%20of%20Lost%20Honor\"&gt;Symbol of Lost Honor&lt;/a&gt;, and finally to the island of &lt;a href=\"Caer%20Darrow\"&gt;Caer Darrow&lt;/a&gt; to find their &lt;a href=\"Of%20Love%20and%20Family\"&gt;family painting&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter collecting all the mementos of his son's past, Tirion asked the adventurers to meet &lt;a href=\"Myranda%20the%20Hag\"&gt;Myranda the Hag&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Uther%27s%20Tomb\"&gt;Uther's Tomb&lt;/a&gt;, once a master &lt;a href=\"illusionist\"&gt;illusionist&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; and Tirion Fordring's most trusted advisor when he held the rank of lord of Mardenholde, so they could be disguised and infiltrate &lt;a href=\"Hearthglen\"&gt;Hearthglen&lt;/a&gt; to deliver &lt;a href=\"%3ATirion%27s%20Gift\"&gt;:Tirion's Gift&lt;/a&gt; without being attacked by the Scarlet crusaders. Upon receiving the box and its contents, Taelan agreed to leave the Scarlet Crusade and reunite with his father outside of town, however, this betrayal triggered the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Crusader%20Dathrohan\"&gt;Grand Crusader Dathrohan&lt;/a&gt; (possessed by &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt;), who sent &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Inquisitor%20Isillien\"&gt;Grand Inquisitor Isillien&lt;/a&gt; to kill the Fordrings. Consequently, Isillien sent assassins to kill Tirion, but they were unsuccessful. He then rushed to Hearthglen, where he witnessed Isillien killing Taelan. Spurred by his son's death, Tirion avenged him and vowed over his son's body to reform the original Order of the Silver Hand as its Highlord, once more as a force of good dedicated to extinguishing the evil, regardless of its politics or pleasantries, that plagued the world.\nAt some point, Tirion succeeded in gathering knights of the Silver Hand under his command and joined &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt;, as &lt;a href=\"Eligor%20Dawnbringer\"&gt;Eligor Dawnbringer&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Brotherhood%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Brotherhood of the Light&lt;/a&gt; mentioned him in a conversation with &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Commander%20Marjhan\"&gt;Scarlet Commander Marjhan&lt;/a&gt;, threatening the latter to inform Tirion that they are no longer here on amicable terms, and that the Highlord would take great pleasure in seeing to their \"atonement\".\nThe Burning Crusade.\n\"The following section was retconned by the comic and no longer refers to the current lore.\"\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Old Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt; via the &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt;, Tirion can be &lt;a href=\"Ashbringer/Old%20Hillsbrad%20Ashbringer%20event\"&gt;seen&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Southshore\"&gt;Southshore&lt;/a&gt; inn discussing the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Ashbringer\"&gt;Ashbringer&lt;/a&gt; with several of his fellow members of the Silver Hand. He participated in the purification of the corrupted crystal brought by Alexandros Mograine, and was the first to refer to the future weapon by its legendary name.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nPrior to the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, Arthas hoped to end Tirion before he had a chance to take a prominent role in defending Azeroth from the Scourge's new war, as the Highlord embodied the figure of a seasoned paladin and a natural leader.\nLight's Hope Chapel.\nAfter wiping out the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Enclave\"&gt;Ruins of the Scarlet Enclave&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; ordered the destruction of the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt;, and sent &lt;a href=\"Highlord%20Darion%20Mograine\"&gt;Highlord Darion Mograine&lt;/a&gt;, a force of 10,000 undead, and all of the &lt;a href=\"Death%20Knights%20of%20Acherus\"&gt;Death Knights of Acherus&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt;. He cared little for the &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s, as he was prepared to sacrifice all of them to draw out Tirion Fordring. At some point during the battle, Tirion emerged to defend Light's Hope Chapel, and along with the paladins of the Silver Hand and the Argent Dawn, he unleashed his holy fury against the invading armies of the undead. The &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; overwhelmed the might of the Scourge, while Fordring's holy-given powers defeated all the Scourge forces in the area, causing &lt;a href=\"Orbaz%20Bloodbane\"&gt;Orbaz Bloodbane&lt;/a&gt; to flee. For the first time, the death knights knew defeat.\nOn the orders of Tirion, the death knights were brought before the chapel where he confronted Darion Mograine about what he had become, what he and his father had always fought against, and also told him that the Lich King had sent them to be all killed by the Light, as he knew &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20Light\"&gt;what lies beneath the chapel&lt;/a&gt;. He then attended the reunion between Darion and the soul of his father Alexandros Mograine. However, they were interrupted by the arrival of the Lich King, who incapacitated Darion and the other death knights. Also surprised at the turn of events, Tirion tried to attack, but was incapacitated by the dark powers of the Lich King, while &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt; began to drain his soul.\nWhile the Lich King taunted his nigh-inevitable victory, Darion resisted his master's control just enough to give Tirion Fordring the corrupted Ashbringer. The paladin drew upon the power of the Light and cleansed the blade in a blinding flash of energy. With the restored Ashbringer at his command, Tirion charged toward the Lich King to fight him. Aware that even he stands little chance against the Ashbringer near the Chapel, the Lich King retreated, promising that the next time he meets Fordring, it will not be on holy ground. As the battle concluded on their victory, Fordring walked over to where Darion was lying and brought him back to consciousness. The paladins of the Argent Dawn and the Order of the Silver Hand had a new champion to rally behind, and while he lamented the loss of souls on both sides of the conflict, Tirion called for a merger of the Argent Dawn and the Order of the Silver Hand into a single faction named the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt;. The Highlord then vowed to use their combined force to destroy the Lich King and to tear down the walls of &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt;.\nNorthrend invasion.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt; began, Tirion wrote letters addressed to &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Warchief Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, telling them that the bearers of the letters and the rest of the &lt;a href=\"Death%20Knights%20of%20Acherus\"&gt;Death Knights of Acherus&lt;/a&gt; were now free from the control of the Lich King, and that as the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; under the command of Alexandros Mograine's son, they were now ready to lend their aid in destroying their former master. He asked the faction leaders to be tolerant, to accept their help in defeating the Scourge, and if possible, that &lt;a href=\"Eitrigg\"&gt;Eitrigg&lt;/a&gt; could join him in Northrend to aid him in his campaign.\nFollowing their acceptance, Tirion ordered the Argent Crusade to launch the invasion of Northrend alongside the Alliance and the Horde. In order to reach Northrend without being intercepted by the Lich King's agents, Tirion impersonated anonymously a &lt;a href=\"Cleric%20of%20the%20Crusade\"&gt;Cleric of the Crusade&lt;/a&gt; and managed to set foot at the port of &lt;a href=\"Valgarde\"&gt;Valgarde&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Howling%20Fjord\"&gt;Howling Fjord&lt;/a&gt;, where he revealed his identity and reclaimed Ashbringer from &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Irulon%20Trueblade\"&gt;Lord Irulon Trueblade&lt;/a&gt;. While Irulon asked him to not reveal his true identity, Tirion said that the death of &lt;a href=\"Ares%20the%20Oathbound\"&gt;Ares the Oathbound&lt;/a&gt; and those who sacrificed themselves to bring the Asbringer to Northrend weighed on his soul, he then announced loudly that he and his men were on their way to bring down Arthas, making sure he knew he was now on the frozen continent.\nLater during the campaign, Tirion mustered a large army and advanced into the region from the nearby &lt;a href=\"Crystalsong%20Forest\"&gt;Crystalsong Forest&lt;/a&gt;, establishing the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Vanguard\"&gt;Argent Vanguard&lt;/a&gt; on Icecrown's outskirts. Located in the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Echoes\"&gt;Valley of Echoes&lt;/a&gt;, it gave them a path into &lt;a href=\"Scourgeholme\"&gt;Scourgeholme&lt;/a&gt;, which Tirion hoped to conquer and remake into an Argent Crusade fortress. He could be later found there, talking with &lt;a href=\"The%20Ebon%20Watcher\"&gt;The Ebon Watcher&lt;/a&gt;, actually &lt;a href=\"Darion%20Mograine\"&gt;Darion Mograine&lt;/a&gt; under disguise. The two discussed the Lich King's reaction following the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Angrathar%20the%20Wrathgate\"&gt;Battle of Angrathar the Wrathgate&lt;/a&gt;, and the Argent Crusade's difficulties in advancing beyond the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Echoes\"&gt;Valley of Echoes&lt;/a&gt; after the arrival of &lt;a href=\"nerubian\"&gt;nerubian&lt;/a&gt; from Scourgeholme to close the breaches. The tone began to rise when Darion said that Tirion could not win, because of the virtues of the Light which chains him, while the Lich King is free from all morality and will not hesitate to use all means to destroy the living to the very last. In response, Tirion threatened him to carefully choose his words in the future and that he will not lower himself to the Scourge's level; as they will do this with honor lest they become the monster they are trying to kill.\nAfter he received a few &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s sent by his faithful knights, he asked them to support &lt;a href=\"Crusade%20Commander%20Entari\"&gt;Crusade Commander Entari&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to save the situation in the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Echoes\"&gt;Valley of Echoes&lt;/a&gt; and at the &lt;a href=\"Breach%20%28Icecrown%29\"&gt;Breach&lt;/a&gt;. Once the areas were secured, he ordered his troops to advance the front and sent the adventurers with Darion to take care of &lt;a href=\"Scourgeholme\"&gt;Scourgeholme&lt;/a&gt;. After the fall of the undead fortress, Tirion sent the adventurers with his &lt;a href=\"%3ABlessed%20Banner%20of%20the%20Crusade\"&gt;:Blessed Banner of the Crusade&lt;/a&gt; to aid &lt;a href=\"Father%20Gustav\"&gt;Father Gustav&lt;/a&gt; in the conquest of the &lt;a href=\"Crusaders%27%20Pinnacle\"&gt;Crusaders' Pinnacle&lt;/a&gt;, and arrived later with his troops to thank them for all their efforts.\nDuring the most intense phase of the battle in Icecrown, Tirion discovered that Arthas's &lt;a href=\"Pulsing%20Crystal\"&gt;frozen heart&lt;/a&gt; had been retrieved from the beneath Icecrown Citadel and taken to the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Darkness\"&gt;Cathedral of Darkness&lt;/a&gt;. With it, he decided there could be a chance to make Arthas human again, redeeming him and ending the threat of the Lich King simultaneously. He planned to seize the frozen organ in an ambush, as it was being transported by agents of the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Cult of the Damned&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, to the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Darkness\"&gt;Cathedral of Darkness&lt;/a&gt; for destruction.\nAs Tirion and his selected champions entered the Cathedral, disguised as cultists, the heart arrived. Before the trap could be sprung, however, the Lich King himself appeared, immediately seeing through the paladins' trick and claiming that, unlike &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;last time&lt;/a&gt;, they would not be fighting on holy ground and Tirion would lose. After he threatened to destroy the heart, the Lich King calling this bluff as the paladin would never forsake the slight hope for Arthas's redemption, Tirion claimed that he had since seen that there could be no redemption for Arthas, as there was no Arthas left to redeem. He then proceeded to strike the organ with the Ashbringer, critically injuring the Lich King and triggering an explosion that knocked Tirion unconscious. As the Argent champions moved to defend Tirion from the surrounding cultists, Darion Mograine and a force of Ebon Knights arrived, holding back the tide of Scourge forces. As the Lich King began to channel a spell to slay all present, Darion created a portal back to &lt;a href=\"Crusaders%27%20Pinnacle\"&gt;Crusaders' Pinnacle&lt;/a&gt;, allowing those gathered to escape.\nDespite their failure, Tirion still felt the foray was a success, stating that now he knew for certain that there remained no trace of Arthas Menethil any longer\u2014only the Lich King.\nAt some point, Tirion called an adventurer whom he sent to search for the hero &lt;a href=\"Crusader%20Bridenbrad\"&gt;Crusader Bridenbrad&lt;/a&gt;, who had gone missing after he dragged more than a dozen men to safety, having been attacked by the Scourge at the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Front\"&gt;Broken Front&lt;/a&gt;. When he learned that the crusader had been infected by the &lt;a href=\"plague%20of%20undeath\"&gt;plague of undeath&lt;/a&gt;, Tirion refused to leave him to his fate, and sent the adventurer to find &lt;a href=\"Keeper%20Remulos\"&gt;Keeper Remulos&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Moonglade\"&gt;Moonglade&lt;/a&gt;, in an attempt to save him with his &lt;a href=\"Nature\"&gt;nature magic&lt;/a&gt;. However that was not enough to cure the sickness, he then ordered the adventurer to contact &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza the Life-Binder&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt;, and to use her flames of life to save him. Although the crusader's condition improved again, it was not enough, and despairing at this new failure, Tirion made one last attempt by asking for the help and wisdom of the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"A%27dal\"&gt;A'dal&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt;. In the end, Bridenbrad could not escape his death, Tirion found comfort in the fact that the naaru made sure he was taken to the Light and that he would never become a slave of the Lich King.\nCall of the Crusade.\nAs the campaign in Northrend was proceeding well, all that was left was the final assault on &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, however, Tirion sent word to &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; to hold back, as he believed that a full overwhelming assault was exactly what the Lich King wanted.\nIn fact, Tirion believed there was only one way to conquer Icecrown: a small, surgical strike force could punch a hole in the citadel's defenses and fight its way to the Lich King. To that end, Tirion called upon Azeroth's champions to prove themselves worthy of this crucial mission. Thus the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Tournament\"&gt;Argent Tournament&lt;/a&gt; was born. Despite the tension between the factions, both trusted Tirion Fordring, as he had shown exemplary bravery in his fight to protect Light's Hope Chapel, and the Horde remembered his commitment to justice in defense of the orc Eitrigg many years earlier. None doubted his sincerity and single-minded desire to see the Lich King destroyed, and there was no shortage of heroes willing to march at his side, no matter their faction.\nTo mark the beginning of the Argent Tournament, the Highlord gave a motivational speech every now and then to prepare to end the Lich King's reign. He invited every Alliance and Horde fighter to come and prove their worth, their abilities, and their prowess to be worthy to march alongside the Argent Crusade to the gates of Icecrow Citadel.\nUpon the Alliance's arrival, he greeted King Varian Wrynn and &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; and mentioned that their places in the coliseum were waiting for them. As Varian told Tirion that he asked much of him to be away from the battlefield, and to just sit and watch the games while trusting the Horde to keep themselves in check, Tirion assured Varian that his people were here to ensure they honor the rules of engagement, and that his subjects would be delighted to see him in the stands. This answer was enough for Varian who confirmed his support for Tirion, and the Highlord escorts them into the coliseum.\nUpon the Horde's arrival, he welcomed &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Warchief Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;. While Thrall thanked the Highlord for the invitation, Garrosh gave his own opinions on these events, seeing them as a waste of time. In response, Tirion said that he hoped for the merit of these events in time, as they couldn't win against the Scourge if the Alliance and the Horde continued war against one another. While Thrall called it wise, Garrosh called it a fool's hope. The Highlord then hoped that they would behave well in the coliseum.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Trial%20of%20the%20Champion\"&gt;Trial of the Champion&lt;/a&gt;, Tirion tested a small party of champions to undergo their opposing faction, to &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Confessor%20Paletress%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;face among&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Eadric%20the%20Pure%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;the elite&lt;/a&gt; of the Argent Crusade, and an &lt;a href=\"The%20Black%20Knight%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;unexpected&lt;/a&gt; agent of the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Cult of the Damned&lt;/a&gt;.\nLater, the &lt;a href=\"Trial%20of%20the%20Crusader\"&gt;Trial of the Crusader&lt;/a&gt; gave a larger group a chance to prove their worth against all odds. First among them were &lt;a href=\"Beasts%20of%20Northrend\"&gt;beasts far in the northlands&lt;/a&gt;. Then a &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Wilfred%20Fizzlebang\"&gt;Wilfred Fizzlebang&lt;/a&gt;, who summoned forth &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Jaraxxus%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;a demon beyond his reach to be bounded to its master&lt;/a&gt;, to what Tirion said to the crowd that it should be a lesson to those that dare dabble in dark magic. At some point, Garrosh accused the Alliance of treachery and, in turn, Varian called him a pig, but the Highlord calmed the situation and called on everyone to compose themselves for the tournament must go on. However, champions from the opposing faction were the next combatants that proved to be a shallow and tragic result. Following that, the final challenge consisted of the Scourge's most powerful lieutenants: fearsome &lt;a href=\"Twin%20Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpon success, Tirion gave approval that the champions have proved themselves of the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt;, and together they will march upon the Lich King's stronghold. However, the Lich King appeared in the coliseum, issuing a challenge to the heroes, Tirion told him that he was hopelessly outnumbered and to lay down his weapon, but Arthas disappeared and sent the heroes underground to fight &lt;a href=\"Anub%27arak\"&gt;Anub'arak&lt;/a&gt;. After another triumphant victory against Arthas' plans, Tirion knew that the champions' skill and cunning will prove to be a powerful weapon against the Scourge. While countless heroes participated in the tournament's trials, Tirion had winnowed the ranks to find his chosen few. He and the Argent Crusade now had their champions. They were joined by Darion Mograine and many of his death knights under the banner of a new order called the &lt;a href=\"Ashen%20Verdict\"&gt;Ashen Verdict&lt;/a&gt;. Together, they would bring final judgment upon the Lich King.\nFall of the Lich King.\nWhen the assault on Icecrown Citadel began, Tirion led his troops and ordered his rams to destroy the gates to the Lich King's lair, signaling that the hour of justice had finally come. Inside the Citadel, he ordered the creation of &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Light's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; in the entrance hall of the citadel, and made a speech to prepare them his champions for the biggest fight of their whole life, the one who would determine the future of all living on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the time had come, Tirion led the &lt;a href=\"Ashen%20Verdict\"&gt;Ashen Verdict&lt;/a&gt; and his champions in their ascent to the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt;, defeating the Scourge's &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel%20%28instance%29\"&gt;mightiest servants&lt;/a&gt; which tested their strength and willpower. Upon reaching the location, Tirion ordered the attack on Arthas following a declaration that he would pay for the many thousands he had slain. The Lich King unleashed his full fury, and Tirion with his champions fought back in a valiant battle that shook Icecrown Citadel to its foundations. But despite their valor and heroism, the champions could not prevail as Arthas' power overwhelmed them, and Tirion was subdued in a block of ice, where he could only watch helplessly his champions being slaughtered by the runeblade.\nAfter he killed all the champions, the Lich King revealed to Tirion that he had been waiting for their assault all along, knowing that he would bring with him Azeroth's greatest heroes, who could then be killed and resurrected as powerful masters of the Scourge. While Arthas began to raise them as his champions of the Scourge, Tirion refused to give up, and managed to break free of the ice after a final blessing from the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;. In a final exchange, he shattered &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt; with the Ashbringer. The spirits who had been trapped within the runeblade attacked their former jailer and suspended him in the air. The spirit of &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;King Terenas Menethil II&lt;/a&gt; resurrected Fordring's champions, who were then able to finish off the immobilized Lich King.\nAfter watching Arthas's final moments with his father, Tirion was informed by Terenas that there must always be a Lich King to keep the Scourge in check. The old paladin agreed, but it was not a burden he could ask anyone else to bear. He took up the &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Helm of Domination&lt;/a&gt; and steeled himself to become the jailor of the damned. But before he could don the cursed armor and seal his fate, &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; intervened. The broken man sat upon the Frozen Throne and told Tirion and the heroes that they had their own destinies to fulfill, and that he would take up the burden of becoming the new Lich King. After saying his last goodbye, Tirion reluctantly placed the crown atop Bolvar's head, sealing the fate of Bolvar, the Scourge, and Azeroth itself.\nTrue to his word, Tirion kept hidden the truth of what had occurred atop Icecrown Citadel to all, save for Darion Mograine, and the leaders of the Alliance and the Horde. Later, the victorious champions returned to &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, where a golden statue was built in honor of the heroes who died. At the very top of this monument stands a statue of Tirion, Ashbringer raised, standing over a shattered Frostmourne.\nCataclysm.\nAfter his victory over the Lich King, Tirion returned to Lordaeron to reclaim &lt;a href=\"Hearthglen\"&gt;Hearthglen&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; and resumed his place as lord within &lt;a href=\"Mardenholde%20Keep\"&gt;Mardenholde Keep&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, and the advance of the crusaders in the restoration of the Plaguelands, he personally welcomed the new recruits among the ranks of the crusade, and invited them to stay at Hearthglen as long as they wish to continue training, and maybe, to help their cause one day. He later thanked an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; for helping the Argent Crusade, firstly with humor and then very seriously, after they tracked down and killed a traitor they had been looking for weeks.\nLegion.\nYears later, when successfully opened the way for the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, Tirion and the Argent Crusade were the first to respond and took the fight to the demons at the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;. However, the battle was a disaster, with armies of demons pouring from the tomb. The Argent Crusade was annihilated and many prisoners were taken, including Tirion. After the Horde and Alliance fleets arrived and pushed toward the tomb, Gul'dan held Tirion above a pool of lava as a trap to lure in &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt;'s forces. As Tirion prayed for the Light's protection, Gul'dan scoffed and claimed that his light was no match for the power of a &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;real god&lt;/a&gt;. The warlock then summoned the giant &lt;a href=\"Krosus\"&gt;Krosus&lt;/a&gt;, who spewed a storm of &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; at Tirion, destroying his &lt;a href=\"%3ADivine%20Shield\"&gt;:Divine Shield&lt;/a&gt; and gravely wounding him, before Gul'dan dropped him into the lava as a final way to erode the Alliance and Horde's morale.\nFollowing the battle, &lt;a href=\"Maxwell%20Tyrosus\"&gt;Maxwell Tyrosus&lt;/a&gt; believed that contacting &lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther the Lightbringer&lt;/a&gt;'s spirit would allow them to discover the current whereabouts of the lost legendary weapon. Thus, Maxwell and a &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Champion of the Light&lt;/a&gt; journeyed to &lt;a href=\"Uther%27s%20Tomb\"&gt;Uther's Tomb&lt;/a&gt; and contacted the legendary paladin, who revealed that they had to hurry if they wished to recover the Ashbringer, and that Tirion still clung to life.\nA prisoner on the Broken Shore, Tirion had indeed survived his fall into the lava and was held captive by &lt;a href=\"Jailer%20Zerus\"&gt;Jailer Zerus&lt;/a&gt; who tried to break him. He was later freed by the Argent Crusade, but the torture he received was too much for him. After choosing a new Ashbringer, he asked them to defeat the Legion before dying to his wounds. His body was then taken by Maxwell Tyrosus and buried beneath &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt;. A memorial service was held in his honor, during which Tyrosus named &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;the new wielder of the Ashbringer&lt;/a&gt; as the new Highlord of the Silver Hand.\nLater during the invasion, the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; ordered the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Deathlord&lt;/a&gt; to rebuild the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Horsemen\"&gt;Four Horsemen&lt;/a&gt; and choose the recently fallen Tirion Fordring to be their leader. Initially &lt;a href=\"Darion%20Mograine\"&gt;Darion Mograine&lt;/a&gt; opposed this order, considering that Tirion deserved more than a life of anguish and undeath, as he was one of the greatest champions &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; has known. Ultimately, the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; had no choice but to obey and launched the &lt;a href=\"Assault%20on%20Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Assault on Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt;. However, they failed to obtain his body from the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;, as the Light itself protected the tomb of Tirion. It was therefore Darion who took his place as leader of the Four Horsemen.\nUpon killing enemies, the Ashbringer &lt;a href=\"Ashbringer%20%28artifact%29%23Quotes\"&gt;may whisper&lt;/a&gt; to its new wielder, the voice and quotes being those of Tirion Fordring when he was alive.\nQuests.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nWhen all three above were complete, the following became available:\nQuotes.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nTirion's story in his own words.\nAfter completing his first three quests, this conversation opens with Tirion, as part of the next quest in his chain:\nPersonality.\nRising from the ranks of a knight and later a paladin, Tirion Fordring was a man of honor \u2014 and his commitment to upholding his honor no matter the cost often brought him into conflict with his family and friends. His wife &lt;a href=\"Karandra%20Fordring\"&gt;Karandra Fordring&lt;/a&gt; often lamented the sacrifices she had to make in order to adapt to her husband's tendency to place his personal honor above everything else - his family included. So, for instance, when Fordring attempted to explain to his wife and to his long-time friend &lt;a href=\"Arden\"&gt;Arden&lt;/a&gt; that his commitment to saving the life of Eitrigg was a matter of honor, he encountered, for the most part, a total lack of understanding, with both Arden and Karandra arguing that he also has a responsibility to his family and his subjects \u2014 a responsibility he should not neglect in the name of honor.\nIn the end, Tirion's honor was the ultimate cause of his downfall \u2014 during his trial, he was offered an opportunity to be restored to good standing within the Alliance if only he would renounce the vow he gave to Eitrigg. Tirion refused, saying that his honor precluded him from doing so. Consequently, he paid heavily for the honor he held in such high esteem. Not only was he stripped of his office and estates, but his family \u2014 Karandra Fordring and &lt;a href=\"Taelan\"&gt;Taelan&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 refused to accompany him into exile, his wife stating that she would not let him ruin their lives as he had ruined his own. Thus, after his rescue of Eitrigg from the gallows in &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;, honor was very much the only thing Tirion still had.\nAfter his exile and the &lt;a href=\"Scourging%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;fall of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; to the Scourge, Tirion fell into inactivity, feeling there was no reason for him to fight. That all changed, however, with the death of Taelan. Filled with righteous anger at the loss of his beloved son, Tirion vowed to reestablish the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;, to oppose the spread of evil in the world. As the new wielder of the legendary &lt;a href=\"Ashbringer\"&gt;Ashbringer&lt;/a&gt;, he later led the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; in a holy crusade against the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, and defeated the Dark Lord of the Scourge at the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt;. A selfless man, he attempted to sacrifice himself by wearing the &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Helm of Domination&lt;/a&gt;, in order to become the Jailer of the Damned and protect &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; from the uncontrolled &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, before being replaced by &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the years that followed, he continued to dedicate his life to protecting the world, and when the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;returned&lt;/a&gt;, he was the first with his men to be at the front to fight the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s, which cost him his life. His death was a shock to the whole world, as he was recognized as a model of virtue and honor by all.\nIn the RPG.\nWhile journeying through the &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands\"&gt;Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; encountered Tirion Fordring, dressed in little more than rags but carrying a large platinum warhammer. At first, he thought he was a survivor with a salvaged weapon. When he approached, a &lt;a href=\"ghoul\"&gt;ghoul&lt;/a&gt; leapt from behind a nearby ruined wall, but the human turned fluidly and crushed the beast, and Brann knew he was a seasoned warrior. After the fight, Tirion Fordring introduced himself as a &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;, and they shared a camp that night, where he told his tale about &lt;a href=\"Eitrigg\"&gt;Eitrigg&lt;/a&gt;, his banishment, and also about his son &lt;a href=\"Taelan%20Fordring\"&gt;Taelan Fordring&lt;/a&gt; among the ranks of the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt;, manipulated by &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Inquisitor%20Isillien\"&gt;Grand Inquisitor Isillien&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter this meeting, Brann described Tirion to be a strong and honorable warrior, and that he would prove a valuable ally against the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, for he has a great deal of experience both combating undead and leading soldiers.\nWhen Taelan Fordring led an expedition to retake the small community of &lt;a href=\"Cinderhome\"&gt;Cinderhome&lt;/a&gt;, in an attempt to expand the Scarlet Crusade\u2019s influence, they were attacked by a Scourge host. As Tirion Fordring observed this whole endeavor, he worried for his son and desperately called for heroes to help him break through the undead line, in order to save the Crusaders within. He also hoped to use this situation as an opportunity to extirpate Taelan from the Crusade\u2019s grasp or, failing that, as a way to prove that not all those who wander the Plaguelands are evil.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

The sky over Tirisfal is eternally gloomy and tinted a blighted green, and the trees and other flora desperately cling to their last shreds of life.\nThose who inhabit the area of Tirisfal used to feel two conflicting energies emanating from the earth: the remaining spiritual essence of &lt;a href=\"Tyr\"&gt;Keeper Tyr&lt;/a&gt;, and that of his enemy &lt;a href=\"Zakajz\"&gt;Zakajz&lt;/a&gt;. Some tapped into Tyr's energy; others would become attuned with the &lt;a href=\"C%27Thrax\"&gt;C'Thrax&lt;/a&gt;'s dark aura. Although tainted and melancholy, Tirisfal still very much has its own unique, haunting beauty, particularly in such areas as the stony &lt;a href=\"North%20Coast\"&gt;North Coast&lt;/a&gt;, the town of &lt;a href=\"Brill\"&gt;Brill&lt;/a&gt;, and the deep atmosphere of the ruined &lt;a href=\"Agamand%20Mills\"&gt;Agamand Mills&lt;/a&gt;.\nTirisfal Glades is home not only to the Forsaken but to their enemies as well.

Discovering the theft, Loken sent horrific monsters after Tyr's group, but Tyr sacrificed his life to fight the creatures while his comrades escaped with the discs.

The struggle lasted for six days. Ultimately, to protect his friends, Tyr unleashed all of his power, erupting in a crater. Tyr and Zakazj were dead while the wounded Kith'ix fled to the west. In honor of her fallen comrade, &lt;a href=\"Ironaya\"&gt;Ironaya&lt;/a&gt; named the glade surrounding the crater as \"&lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Fall\"&gt;Tyr's Fall&lt;/a&gt;\" which in the &lt;a href=\"Vrykul%20%28language%29\"&gt;vrykul tongue&lt;/a&gt; translated to \"Tirisfal\". She and her followers buried Tyr and his foe where they lay, and they placed Tyr's massive silver hand atop his final resting place as a memorial to his valiant sacrifice. In the end, Tyr's hammer became lost with him somewhere beneath the land now named in his honor. The peaceful &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; that were accompanying the &lt;a href=\"Keeper\"&gt;Keeper&lt;/a&gt;s wanted to further honor Tyr and decided to settle near the battlefield and protect the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Tyr\"&gt;Tomb of Tyr&lt;/a&gt;. Ironaya and &lt;a href=\"Archaedas\"&gt;Archaedas&lt;/a&gt; honored the vrykul's wish to settle in Tirisfal. Among the vrykul that remained in Tirisfal was &lt;a href=\"Yrgrim%20the%20Truthseeker\"&gt;Yrgrim the Truthseeker&lt;/a&gt; but later left the place.\nOver time, the area became a place of legend for the vrykul people in &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor%20%28landmass%29\"&gt;northern Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. As a result of the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Flesh\"&gt;Curse of Flesh&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Dragonflayer%20clan\"&gt;Dragonflayer&lt;/a&gt; vrykul began giving birth to deformed children, giving rise to fear. &lt;a href=\"King%20Ymiron\"&gt;King Ymiron&lt;/a&gt; intended to unite all vrykul &lt;a href=\"clan\"&gt;clan&lt;/a&gt;s and ordered the malformed infants killed. Some Dragonflayer vrykul couldn't do that and decided to find the legendary land of Tirisfal and give the children to the vrykul living there. In the ages that followed, the children and their offspring continued transforming into beings called &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s. As such, humanity first emerged in Tirisfal Glades. The vrykul had formed &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Guard\"&gt;Tyr's Guard&lt;/a&gt;. Knowing they would not live forever, they allowed the humans to join the order.\nTirisfal Glades were the landing place of the &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; (later &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt;) led by &lt;a href=\"Dath%27Remar%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Dath'Remar Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; exiled them from &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. Forging inland, the high elves founded a settlement within the tranquil Tirisfal Glades, co-living with the &lt;a href=\"tribe\"&gt;tribe&lt;/a&gt;s of primitive humans who told them legends about Tyr. Among known elves that were born in Tirisfal is &lt;a href=\"Lorash%20Sunbeam\"&gt;Lorash Sunbeam&lt;/a&gt;. After a few years, many of them began to go mad due to shadowy powers. It was theorized that &lt;a href=\"Zakajz%20the%20Corruptor\"&gt;something evil&lt;/a&gt; slept beneath that particular part of the world, but the rumors were never proven to be true. The Highborne argued whether they should expel the humans from the land or even conquer them. Dath'Remar did not agree with this because he sensed dark magic. To avoid violence, the Highborne packed up their encampment and moved northward towards another land rich with ley energies, &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;.\nOver thousands of years, the Tirisfal vrykul died out, but humanity would flourish in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;. Warlord &lt;a href=\"Thoradin\"&gt;Thoradin&lt;/a&gt; set to unite the human tribes, including that of Tirisfal Glades which was the only human &lt;a href=\"Lordain%27s%20tribe\"&gt;tribe&lt;/a&gt; powerful enough to end King Thoradin's dream of unity. This tribe was led by the native &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Lordain\"&gt;Lordain&lt;/a&gt;. While Thoradin won the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alteraci&lt;/a&gt; by show of strength, the Tirisfal humans would not submit to shows of force like the &lt;a href=\"Alteraci%20tribe\"&gt;Alteraci&lt;/a&gt;. To win their loyalty, Thoradin needed to appeal to their &lt;a href=\"Religion\"&gt;religious&lt;/a&gt; beliefs. Thus Thoradin and his personal guards made a pilgrimage to the region's shrines and sacred groves. At each site, the king performed rituals as was the custom of Lordain and his kin. Thoradin even wore a pendant of the silver hand, an image held sacred by Tirisfal's humans. At the end of the pilgrimage, Thoradin met with Lordain. The king pledged that if the tribe joined him, he would adopt their mystic ways and spread them among the &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20tribe\"&gt;Arathi&lt;/a&gt;. To seal his promise, Thoradin ran his palm along &lt;a href=\"Strom%27kar\"&gt;Strom'kar&lt;/a&gt;'s edge and mixed his blood with the earth of Tirisfal. And so it was, Lordain and his people bent the knee to King Thoradin, with the Tirisfal leader becoming Thoradin's general. With the human tribes united, the &lt;a href=\"kingdom\"&gt;kingdom&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Arathor\"&gt;Arathor&lt;/a&gt; arose.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Wars\"&gt;Troll Wars&lt;/a&gt;, Tirisfal Glades were considered a territory of the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20Empire\"&gt;Amani Empire&lt;/a&gt;. When the Troll Wars ended, Thoradin abdicated and spent some time in Tirisfal studying its ruins and becoming obsessed with the humanity's history as well as that of the vrykul. Using the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;elven&lt;/a&gt; enchantments of Strom'kar, he located Tyr's tomb. Thoradin led a retinue of guards and &lt;a href=\"sorcerer\"&gt;sorcerer&lt;/a&gt;s there and encountered Tyr's Guard. Thoradin's group forced themselves past them and entered the depths of darkness to which Thoradin heroically succumbed.\nBy the year -2,700, the area had the most coveted and fertile lands. The Arathi established a stronghold to protect their &lt;a href=\"Farm\"&gt;farmsteads&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"kobold\"&gt;kobold&lt;/a&gt;s, and other dangerous wildlife. Many former &lt;a href=\"soldier\"&gt;soldier&lt;/a&gt;s settled in this region, which they renamed Lordaeron in honor of the late general Lordain.\nGuardians of Tirisfal.\nTirisfal Glades was a place of power for centuries, being the seat of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Council of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt;, who secretly waged their war against the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Among the places the Council members used was the &lt;a href=\"Venomweb%20Vale\"&gt;Venomweb Vale&lt;/a&gt; protected by magically conjured &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt;s.\n2,600 years &lt;a href=\"BDP\"&gt;BDP&lt;/a&gt;, fishermen reported a demon stalking the shore of &lt;a href=\"Brightwater%20Lake\"&gt;Brightwater Lake&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, the &lt;a href=\"dreadlord\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kathra%27natir\"&gt;Kathra'natir&lt;/a&gt; corrupted the land around the lake, causing deaths, diseases, insects, and droughts of well waters. There were &lt;a href=\"Eidre\"&gt;Eidre&lt;/a&gt;'s people to rule and protect, and she asked her lover &lt;a href=\"Alodi\"&gt;Alodi&lt;/a&gt; to come home with her. As a member of the Council, Alodi refused to go with her love, but instead, the &lt;a href=\"half-elf\"&gt;half-elf&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Meryl%20Felstorm\"&gt;Meryl Winterstorm&lt;/a&gt; devised a plan with his colleagues to defeat the dreadlord. The council members were to give him his powers, and as a &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt; he rode a &lt;a href=\"phoenix\"&gt;phoenix&lt;/a&gt; from the Venomweb Vale to the lake where Eidre's keep was located. Noticing the dreadlord on an island in the lake, Alodi defeated the demon and banished him back to the Twisting Nether through a rift. Eidre understood now Alodi's true calling. Looking from her keep's window, she witnessed the lake's restoration.\nThe fracturing of Arathor.\nBy the year -1,200, the kingdom of Arathor began to split apart. As &lt;a href=\"Strom\"&gt;Strom&lt;/a&gt;'s power continued to wane due to the lack of nearby natural resources, the nobles of the capital decided to depart to the fertile valleys and pastures of the north. In Tirisfal they founded a city-state and named it after the surrounding region: &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. The nobles used their wealth to buy up large plots of land, some of which had been developed by early settlers. These areas included the &lt;a href=\"Agamand%20Mills\"&gt;Agamand Mills&lt;/a&gt; and the farmsteads owned by the &lt;a href=\"Balnir\"&gt;Balnir&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Solliden%20Farmstead\"&gt;Solliden&lt;/a&gt; families.\nOver 800 years BDP, Magna &lt;a href=\"Scavell\"&gt;Scavell&lt;/a&gt; taught several members of the Council, including the young &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt;, in the Glade.\nSecond War and aftermath.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; crossed the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac Mountains&lt;/a&gt; into the Glades and besieged &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt;. However, due to the &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;betrayals&lt;/a&gt; within the Horde and the arrival of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; from behind, the isolated Horde army was certain to lose, so Warchief Orgrim sounded for retreat to &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;, with the Alliance racing after them.\nBy the time of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Agamand\"&gt;Agamand&lt;/a&gt; family living at the Agamand Mills was the most prosperous family in Tirisfal Glades. &lt;a href=\"Archbishop\"&gt;Archbishop&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Holy%20Light\"&gt;Church of the Holy Light&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Alonsus%20Faol\"&gt;Alonsus Faol&lt;/a&gt; died prior to the Third War and was buried at &lt;a href=\"Faol%27s%20Rest\"&gt;Faol's Rest&lt;/a&gt;.\nThird War and aftermath.\nUnder the rule of &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil\"&gt;King Terenas&lt;/a&gt;, Tirisfal became a land of peaceful farms and small towns, its people living happily for generations. Unfortunately, it was one of the first places to fall to &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;' armies after he ransacked Lordaeron, and its people were killed and risen as &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"slave\"&gt;slave&lt;/a&gt;s to the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;. Tirisfal suffered a huge number of deaths when the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;Plague of Undeath&lt;/a&gt; swept through the region, and &lt;a href=\"Mass%20Grave\"&gt;mass graves&lt;/a&gt; were created to hold the bodies.\nAs Lordaeron fell, Arthas arrived to the ravaged &lt;a href=\"Balnir%20Farmstead\"&gt;Balnir Farmstead&lt;/a&gt; and raised his former horse, &lt;a href=\"Invincible\"&gt;Invincible&lt;/a&gt;, as a &lt;a href=\"Skeletal%20horse\"&gt;skeletal steed&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; also raised Archbishop Faol from his grave. The Agamand Mills were taken by the undead as well and so were most of the settlements in the area.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Scourging%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Scourging of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Thomson\"&gt;Thomas Thomson&lt;/a&gt; was sent by the superior &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; to spent time with his family at the &lt;a href=\"Thomson\"&gt;Thomson&lt;/a&gt; farm, located southwest of the &lt;a href=\"Agamand%20Mills\"&gt;Agamand Mills&lt;/a&gt; in Tirisfal Glades. As he was returning home, he encountered pockets of Scourge as the &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt; has fallen. Days later, a courier arrived at the farm and delivered a message about the death of Lord Uther. Ultimately, the farm was abandoned as Thomas sent his wife and children with Kul Tiran ships while he joined the remaining members of the paladin order. Like the other farms, the Thomas farm was growing pumpkins.\nJust after the Third War ended, the Lich King began losing power thanks to the spell of &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, and so was Arthas Menethil. After the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Battle for Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt; returned home and scoured the surrounding of the Capital City of any human citizens he could find. They were trying to leave the area and get to &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, but Arthas, &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; defended the passes and killed the &lt;a href=\"Human%20Refugees\"&gt;fleeing refugees&lt;/a&gt; and their Silver Hand protectors.\nUpon the successful cleansing, Arthas was recalled to &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; to aid the Lich King. However, the weakened death knight was betrayed and the &lt;a href=\"Dreadlord%20Insurgents\"&gt;Dreadlord Insurgents&lt;/a&gt; attempted to kill him. Arthas fled the ruins of Capital City, and accompanied by Sylvanas' &lt;a href=\"banshee\"&gt;banshee&lt;/a&gt;s, trekked through the Glades. Arriving to a field area near the Balnir Farmstead, the banshees attacked Arthas' last followers and Sylvanas shoot an arrow at the death knight, poisoning him. Kel'Thuzad and his &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s found soon after, defeated the banshees and forced Sylvanas to retreat. With that, the lich and the death knight continued to a &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20harbor\"&gt;landing site&lt;/a&gt; from which Arthas left Lordaeron.\nWhen Sylvanas and &lt;a href=\"Garithos\"&gt;Garithos&lt;/a&gt;' &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20resistance\"&gt;Alliance resistance&lt;/a&gt; were besieging Capital City, the &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20Dwarves%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;group&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; serving the Alliance went astray and became lost in the wilderness near the Capital City, with some of them being captured by local &lt;a href=\"kobold\"&gt;kobold&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAfter a &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands%20civil%20war\"&gt;civil war in the Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;, Sylvanas and her free-willed undead took Capital City, forming the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;. The rebel undead managed to take control of Tirisfal and establish it as their home territory.\nDuring that time, remnants of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; spied on the Forsaken moving into the Ruins of Lordaeron. To continue observing them, &lt;a href=\"Alexandros%20Mograine\"&gt;Alexandros Mograine&lt;/a&gt; and his team took the deserted Monastery in northern Tirisfal. With the subsequent splintering of the Silver Hand, the fanatical &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; established themselves and took the Monastery as their sanctuary. It was here that &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt;, posing as &lt;a href=\"Saidan%20Dathrohan\"&gt;Saidan Dathrohan&lt;/a&gt; later transformed the maddened Thomas Thomson into an undead monstrosity that haunts not only &lt;a href=\"Brill\"&gt;Brill&lt;/a&gt; but all of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Hallow%27s%20End\"&gt;Hallow's End&lt;/a&gt;. Over time, the Crusaders took several &lt;a href=\"watch%20tower\"&gt;watch tower&lt;/a&gt;s in Tirisfal posing threats to the Forsaken.\nAnother threat that remained in the land was the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. They led a &lt;a href=\"Summertide%20Assaults\"&gt;series of assaults&lt;/a&gt; against the Scarlet Monastery.\nAt some point, a farm near &lt;a href=\"Brill\"&gt;Brill&lt;/a&gt; was stalked by &lt;a href=\"Captain%20%28rank%29\"&gt;Captain&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Renee%20Lauer\"&gt;Renee Lauer&lt;/a&gt; and her force of Scarlet Crusaders, executing &lt;a href=\"Jillian%20Grell\"&gt;Jillian Grell&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rinn%20Firecaster\"&gt;Rinn Firecaster&lt;/a&gt; in the process of cleansing the world of non-humans. Soon after, the relatives of the deceased, &lt;a href=\"Barnabas%20Grell\"&gt;Barnabas Grell&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Reynah%20Firecaster\"&gt;Reynah Firecaster&lt;/a&gt; began searching the woods of Tirisfal, killing the Crusaders they found. Renee's group had a camp on the outskirts of the western Glades. Reynah and Barnabas soon found it and worked their spells and abilities against the enemies. Although they managed to capture the captain, other crusaders bested them and eventually killed, but not before Reynah could use her fire magic against them. As soon as they died, Sylvanas and &lt;a href=\"Varimathras\"&gt;Varimathras&lt;/a&gt; discovered the camp as well and led their force to kill the Crusaders.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nThe Forsaken, having joined the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, battled against the &lt;a href=\"Mindless%20Ones\"&gt;Mindless Ones&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rot%20Hide\"&gt;Rot Hide&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt;s, and the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt;rs to solidify their hold on the area. Various parts of the Glades are protected by the &lt;a href=\"Deathguard\"&gt;Deathguard&lt;/a&gt;s.\nPrior to the start of the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt;, the gates of Lordaeron were invaded by a group of &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s led by &lt;a href=\"Highlord%20Kruul\"&gt;Highlord Kruul&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for the Undercity.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, members of the Horde and Alliance formed a temporary alliance at the siege of &lt;a href=\"Angrathar%20the%20Wrathgate\"&gt;Angrathar the Wrathgate&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Apothecary%20Putress\"&gt;Grand Apothecary Putress&lt;/a&gt;'s betrayal ended seven years of cold war between the two factions as their armies converged on the Undercity. Warchief &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;'s forces stormed the front gates of the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Ruins of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; while King &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;'s army assaulted the Sewer entrance to the city. These two armies confronted Putress, &lt;a href=\"Varimathras\"&gt;Varimathras&lt;/a&gt;, and finally each other at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Undercity\"&gt;Battle for the Undercity&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nFollowing the defeat of the Lich King, Sylvanas and the Forsaken made a number of improvements to Tirisfal Glades. The town of Brill was upgraded from the original, dilapidated \"human\" housing, to the modern Forsaken structures. The Bulwark still has Argent Dawn members (only Horde races) but is now accompanied by Undercity forces as well.\nDeathknell was left mostly the same, but the &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt; sworn to Sylvanas are actively raising new undead to bolster their population. However, not every raised undead is willing to join the Forsaken, such as the &lt;a href=\"Rotbrain%20undead\"&gt;Rotbrain undead&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Lilian%20Voss\"&gt;Lilian Voss&lt;/a&gt;, a former Scarlet Crusade member brought back from death by one of the Val'kyr in Deathknell, who was eager to get her revenge against the Crusade after her father refused her. The Crusaders also reinforced the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Palisade\"&gt;Scarlet Palisade&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; cult led by Twilight Deacon &lt;a href=\"Farthing\"&gt;Farthing&lt;/a&gt; made a camp in the &lt;a href=\"Whispering%20Forest\"&gt;Whispering Forest&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Fall\"&gt;Tyr's Fall&lt;/a&gt; and breached the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Tyr\"&gt;Tomb of Tyr&lt;/a&gt;. Newly recruited heroes of the &lt;a href=\"Conclave\"&gt;Conclave&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Valarjar\"&gt;Valarjar&lt;/a&gt;, and the reformed Silver Hand made their way into the tomb as well, defeated the maddened cultists, and claimed its artifacts as their own. The tomb ultimately collapsed.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nIn order to reclaim the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Ruins of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; attacked Tirisfal Glades from the northern beach. In their march south, they completely destroyed &lt;a href=\"Brill\"&gt;Brill&lt;/a&gt; down to its foundations and knocked down the &lt;a href=\"Zeppelin%20Landing\"&gt;zeppelin towers&lt;/a&gt;. The area between Brill and the Ruins of Lordaeron is covered in &lt;a href=\"New%20Plague\"&gt;blight&lt;/a&gt; that was released by Sylvanas during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Battle for Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. The rest of Tirisfal remains intact and inhabited. \nDuring the Fourth War, the remaining Horde forces in the region appear to be largely in retreat towards neighboring Forsaken lands, with the Bloodfang Pack successfully capturing &lt;a href=\"Fenris%20Isle\"&gt;Fenris Isle&lt;/a&gt;, from where Horde refugees from Tirisfal are later evacuated across &lt;a href=\"Lordamere%20Lake\"&gt;Lordamere Lake&lt;/a&gt;. According to &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Roderick%20Brewston\"&gt;Captain Roderick Brewston&lt;/a&gt; in Stromgarde Keep, the Alliance &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Stromgarde\"&gt;fighting to reclaim Stromgarde and Arathi&lt;/a&gt; is largely to ensure that they are able to continue to occupy neighboring &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. \nIn the aftermath of Sylvanas's defection from the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lilian%20Voss\"&gt;Lilian Voss&lt;/a&gt; arranged a meeting with &lt;a href=\"Calia%20Menethil\"&gt;Calia Menethil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Derek%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Derek Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Calston%20Estate\"&gt;Calston Estate&lt;/a&gt; in the Tirisfal Glades, where she apologized for her role in Derek's rebirth and introduced the two to &lt;a href=\"Delaryn%20Summermoon\"&gt;Delaryn Summermoon&lt;/a&gt; and the other &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elven&lt;/a&gt; dark rangers, who had likewise been abandoned by Sylvanas. Calia and Derek quickly offered to help the undead elves and subsequently left the estate with them, vowing to help them find a future rooted in something beyond hatred and malice.\nTirisfal Glades once again belongs to the Forsaken according to the report Shaw made for Anduin after the end of the fourth war.\nShadowlands.\nSometime after the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Zovaal\"&gt;Zovaal&lt;/a&gt;, the Forsaken took to mustering in the ruins of their former home, as they sought to reclaim as much as they could of the Tirisfal Glades. They had successfully taken Brill and were in the process of rebuilding it when &lt;a href=\"Lilian%20Voss\"&gt;Lilian Voss&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Calia%20Menethil\"&gt;Calia Menethil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Deathstalker%20Commander%20Belmont\"&gt;Belmonot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Ranger%20Velonara\"&gt;Velonara&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Master%20Apothecary%20Faranell\"&gt;Faranell&lt;/a&gt;, influential figures that had risen to prominence among the Forsaken, plotted their next moves to secure the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Ruins of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. During this meeting, Voss wanted to directly focus on dealing with the plague in the Undercity.\nFaranell used an empowered &lt;a href=\"Plague%20Eater\"&gt;Plague Eater&lt;/a&gt; to cleanse the plague. This plan was ultimately successful as the plague manifested as an &lt;a href=\"Amalgam\"&gt;Amalgam&lt;/a&gt; and was slain, liberating the city ruins from the plague.\nGeography.\nThe instanced, winged dungeon known as the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Monastery\"&gt;Scarlet Monastery&lt;/a&gt; can be found in Tirisfal Glades. There are no other dungeons or battlegrounds in the area.\nThe western end of Tirisfal contains a large, inaccessible area. There is a path leading to the area accessed via a small lake in the northwest by the coast, past the Solliden Farmstead. The path is currently blocked by large rocks.\nWestern Tirisfal Glades.\nTo the west of Deathknell is a blank area surrounded by mountains. For a long time, this was simply unincorporated terrain. In \"\", it now contains a small lake and some trees, as well as an interesting circle of white mushrooms. The southern half of the area is called the &lt;a href=\"Whispering%20Forest\"&gt;Whispering Forest&lt;/a&gt;.\nNotable characters.\nTirisfal Glades is home to several Forsaken of status. From the base camp in Deathknell, &lt;a href=\"Executor%20Arren\"&gt;Executor Arren&lt;/a&gt; sends promising young Forsaken out into the world. In Brill, &lt;a href=\"Executor%20Zygand\"&gt;Executor Zygand&lt;/a&gt; leads the effort to reclaim Tirisfal from the Scarlet Crusade, and at the Bulwark, &lt;a href=\"High%20Executor%20Derrington\"&gt;High Executor Derrington&lt;/a&gt; seeks to eradicate the foothold the Scourge has established in the Plaguelands.\nEvents.\nLunar Festival.\nDuring the Spring Lunar Festival, two elders appear in Tirisfal Glades.\nWarcraft III.\nThe area around the &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;city of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; was home to &lt;a href=\"kobold\"&gt;kobold&lt;/a&gt;s, and numerous &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; roamed the city before the Forsaken conquered it, including a unique kind of &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20City%20Mutant\"&gt;Lordaeron City Mutant&lt;/a&gt;s. A small group of &lt;a href=\"red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red dragons&lt;/a&gt; burned down &lt;a href=\"blight\"&gt;blight&lt;/a&gt;ed farms outside the city gates.\nA non-campaign map also exists called Tirisfal Glades.\nIn the RPG.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; partially control &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt;, but Tirisfal Glades is entirely within their grasp. They rule the area from beneath &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; in their capital of &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;. Though the Forsaken claim to be free from the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; and willing to work with other races to destroy the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, they seemed unhappy if they see living people.\nHistory.\nOnce a &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; land, Tirisfal's warriors served in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;s. The Scourge ravaged the region in the Third War and its people fled. After the war, &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; bent the Lich King's yoke enough to free herself and many others from his dominance. She termed these free undead the Forsaken and took the ruins of Lordaeron's capital city as her own. Tirisfal Glades is their unofficial kingdom.\nThe Forsaken attempt to carve out a home and battle against gnolls and worse. Some factions send in agents to sabotage and curtail the Forsaken's efforts, seeing them as no better than the Scourge.\nWhile the Forsaken hunting and living in Tirisfal Glades consider &lt;a href=\"darkhound\"&gt;darkhound&lt;/a&gt;s only a minor nuisance, occasionally a large enough pack poses a threat to alchemists exploring the woods for components.\nThe &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Hakin\"&gt;Hakin&lt;/a&gt; was sent to Tirisfal to meet a Forsaken ambassador. He wasn't happy to be here because the spirits of the land \u2014 they cried in Lordaeron, painfully. When &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; wandered through Tirisfal Glades, he met several undead members of the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20Forgotten%20Shadows\"&gt;Cult of Forgotten Shadows&lt;/a&gt;. One of them was &lt;a href=\"prophet\"&gt;prophet&lt;/a&gt;. The fact that the Forsaken hold the Tirisfal Glades irritates the human nations.\nGeography.\nThe most obvious feature of Tirisfal Glades is the sky \u2014 altered by magic, it is a swirling blue pane that bathes the land in a cerulean glow, adding to the land's already surreal aspect. Mists constantly waft through the trees, and with the constant, twisted sky above you would not tell the difference between night and day. The undead plague has worked its evil on the trees, though not to the same extent as in the &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands\"&gt;Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;. Instead of becoming giant toadstools, the trees' bark has withered to a sickly violet and they bleed infected green-yellow sap. Danger lurks everywhere and death floats beneath the mist.\nTo Tirisfal's south is Silverpine Forest; to its east are the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Western Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;. The land borders &lt;a href=\"Lordamere%20Lake\"&gt;Lordamere Lake&lt;/a&gt; to the southeast, while to the north and west are Lordaeron's oceans.\nLike Silverpine Forest, Tirisfal Glades is an immense woodland with forbidding trees, threatening shadows and lurking mists. The animals in the woods are not as vicious as those in Silverpine, however. This haunting land, under the Forsaken's rule, may, in fact, be safer than Silverpine Forest.\nThe Forsaken control Tirisfal Glades and have several settlements throughout the area. This region is a place of mystery and adventure.\nMagic has twisted the land; the trees are grown a sickly purple and ooze orange sap, and the sky is a constant swirling blue, shedding a surreal light on the wafting mists and lurking creatures.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

Created to hunt down &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt; after she went rogue, the foundation of the Tirisgarde's strength lies in the ancient artifacts wielded by its champions, rather than empowering them directly like the Guardian was. However, the organization came to an end when all its members were exterminated by &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;, possessed by the dark titan &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, at the time of the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;.\nDecades later, at the time of the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the Tirisgarde was reformed by &lt;a href=\"Meryl%20Felstorm\"&gt;Meryl Felstorm&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Conjuror of the Tirisgarde&lt;/a&gt;, recruiting into its ranks among the most talented and worthy mages of all stripes, notably from the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Magisters\"&gt;Magisters&lt;/a&gt;, and all the mage organizations on Azeroth. From their &lt;a href=\"Order%20Halls\"&gt;order hall&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20the%20Guardian\"&gt;Hall of the Guardian&lt;/a&gt;, they fought and succeeded in capturing the &lt;a href=\"dreadlord\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kathra%27natir\"&gt;Kathra'natir&lt;/a&gt;, before joining the battle against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; alongside the other &lt;a href=\"Class%20Order\"&gt;class orders&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nSix hundred years before the opening of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, after one of &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt;'s rare visits to Dalaran where the Council demanded that she step down as Guardian or face immediate consequences, the council members agreed among themselves to take action against the Guardian after she refused. Aegwynn told the magi that putting the fate of Azeroth in their hands was tantamount to dooming the world because she grew suspicious of the order and believed that the council was abusing its power by manipulating the politics of the &lt;a href=\"Seven%20kingdoms\"&gt;human kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf the Guardian would not give up her powers voluntarily, they would force her to do so. The Council long debated how best to accomplish this. Some members proposed empowering a new Guardian, but this idea presented too many dangerous possibilities. If Aegwynn and another Guardian were to do battle, the results could be disastrous for the world. Of even greater concern was that such a conflict would call public attention to their clandestine order.\nUltimately, the council agreed on a more subtle course of action. They formed the Tirisgarde, an order of magi girded with relics and armaments that could diminish the Guardian's incredible powers, considered as the elite mage-guard of Dalaran. After years of training, these resourceful and gifted hunters set out to find Aegwynn and bring her back to Dalaran. The Guardian eluded many of the Tirisgarde with ease. However, the hunters did succeed in finding &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt; and reporting its location back to the council.\nHundreds of years later, forty-five years before the opening of the Dark Portal, the Council of Tirisfal continued its tireless hunt for the renegade Guardian. Waves of unflagging Tirisgarde scoured the world to find Aegwynn and hold her accountable for her defiance. Among them was &lt;a href=\"Nielas%20Aran\"&gt;Nielas Aran&lt;/a&gt;, who shared the same stance as Aegwynn regarding the Council of Tirisfal, and who ends up joining her to help her give birth to a new Guardian, free from the manipulations of the Council, that they named &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the time of the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, Medivh possessed by &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; killed many named and unnamed members of the Order of Tirisfal and the Tirisgarde throughout Azeroth, with the specific purpose of breaking the chain, ending the existence of both organizations before being killed.\nLegion.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Meryl%20Felstorm\"&gt;Meryl Felstorm&lt;/a&gt; called a &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;hero&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; to urgently join him at the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Gate\"&gt;Violet Gate&lt;/a&gt; for a serious problem that was running out of time. There, he announced that he had not succeeded in banishing &lt;a href=\"Kathra%27natir\"&gt;Kathra'natir&lt;/a&gt;, and that the latter had managed to escape while taking with him the knowledge of the mage, in particular on the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Council of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt;, which could have dire consequences. The duo chased after the dreadlord and managed to find it inside the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Hold\"&gt;Violet Hold&lt;/a&gt;, siphoning off the power of the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20the%20Guardian\"&gt;Forge of the Guardian&lt;/a&gt;, source of great power for the Council of Tirisfal who used it to create the Guardian of Tirisfal. Together, they fought Kathra'natir who proved far too strong for them, the mage hero had no choice but to siphon the power of the Forge to become themself a Guardian and defeat the nathrezim.\nDespite their victory, Meryl announced that Kathra'natir would return for the Forge of the Guardian once he regained his strength in the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;. To protect the Forge and defeat the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, Meryl decided to reform the Tirisgarde with the mage hero as they moved the Forge to the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20the%20Guardian\"&gt;Hall of the Guardian&lt;/a&gt; where it would be safe.\nAs the foundation of the Tirisgarde's strength lies in the ancient artifacts wielded by its champions, Meryl Felstorm sent the mage hero on a mission to obtain the legendary artifacts that are &lt;a href=\"Aluneth\"&gt;Aluneth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Felo%27melorn\"&gt;Felo'melorn&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ebonchill\"&gt;Ebonchill&lt;/a&gt;, whose stories and information are present in the &lt;a href=\"Archive%20of%20the%20Tirisgarde\"&gt;Archive of the Tirisgarde&lt;/a&gt;, in order to serve in their hunt of Kathra'natir and to fight against the Burning Legion. After successfully recovering them, the mage hero used the Forge of the Guardian as a font of arcane energy to manipulate and empower his artifacts, before starting to recruit other mages along with Meryl to serve their cause.\nThe first of them was &lt;a href=\"The%20Great%20Akazamzarak\"&gt;The Great Akazamzarak&lt;/a&gt;, a goblin master in portals and teleportation, recruited to help teleport mages into and out of the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20the%20Guardian\"&gt;Hall of the Guardian&lt;/a&gt; because of the protective wards that surrounded the order hall. Once inside, Akazamzarak opened eight portals at once to &lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;, four to &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Borean%20Tundra\"&gt;Borean Tundra&lt;/a&gt;, from which respectively came &lt;a href=\"Edirah\"&gt;Edirah&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Juli%20Stormkettle\"&gt;Juli Stormkettle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Vargoth\"&gt;Archmage Vargoth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Modera\"&gt;Archmage Modera&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Kalec\"&gt;Archmage Kalec&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Melis\"&gt;Archmage Melis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Uthel%27nay\"&gt;Uthel'nay&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Magister%20Varenthas\"&gt;Magister Varenthas&lt;/a&gt;. Meryl explained that he had summoned them to reform Tirisgarde to fight the dreadlord Kathra'natir who has escaped into the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;, but also against the Legion.\nWhile the assembly approved, Meryl announced that the Tirisgarde was now reformed and that in presence of many of Azeroth's greatest mages, it was an honor to dub the mage hero as the Conjuror of the Tirisgarde, an ancient title who symbolizes the awesome responsibility borne by the Tirisgarde.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt;, the Tirisgarde began to mobilize their mages on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;, notably to save the well-respected archivist from the Kirin Tor &lt;a href=\"Chronicler%20Elrianne\"&gt;Chronicler Elrianne&lt;/a&gt;. Subsequently the Tirisgarde organized the recruitment of champions, especially Archmage Modera and Archmage Kalec, but also the recruitment of new troops such as the Water elementals and &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Golem\"&gt;Arcane Golem&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Omniara\"&gt;Archmage Omniara&lt;/a&gt;, who agreed to help the Tirisgarde after being rescued from a demon attack, the &lt;a href=\"Tirisgarde%20Apprentice\"&gt;Tirisgarde Apprentice&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor%20Invoker\"&gt;Kirin Tor Invoker&lt;/a&gt;s formed by &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Conjurer%20Mimic\"&gt;Grand Conjurer Mimic&lt;/a&gt;, and finally the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor%20Guardian\"&gt;Kirin Tor Guardian&lt;/a&gt;s recruited by &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20Alar\"&gt;Guardian Alar&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs the Broken Isles was the epicenter of ancient night elven learning, the Tirisgarde was sent to secure countless magical artifacts secreted away in forgotten vaults and reliquaries, on request of Archmage Vargoth, before they fall into the wrong hands. Later, Vargoth's long-time apprentice, &lt;a href=\"Ravandwyr\"&gt;Ravandwyr&lt;/a&gt;, arrived in the Hall of the Guardian with an urgent message from his mentor, the Tirisgarde found some sort of powerful magic emanating from the secretive &lt;a href=\"Empyrean%20Society%20Enclave\"&gt;Empyrean Society Enclave&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Azsuna\"&gt;Azsuna&lt;/a&gt;, a dangerous cult who claim to study all magic regardless of its source, but in reality who focus mostly on the forbidden. After some investigation, and the discovery of the use of the &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; magic by the &lt;a href=\"Empyrean%20Society\"&gt;Empyrean Society&lt;/a&gt;, the Tirisgarde reduced their number and discovered that Vargoth was involved with the malevolent group, before returning to the Hall of the Guardian where Meryl was affected by a disease of magical nature according to &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Khadgar\"&gt;Archmage Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe discovery of Archmage Vargoth's dubious actions led the Tirisgarde and the Kirin Tor to investigate his quarters, following a meeting of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Six\"&gt;Council of Six&lt;/a&gt;, where they discovered his research and his notes on the &lt;a href=\"Nightborne%20Soulstone\"&gt;Nightborne Soulstone&lt;/a&gt;. Later, champions and agents of the Tirisgarde managed to find Vargoth who entering the Arcway Vaults in &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt;, but they were unable to penetrate very far inside the Arcway Vaults due to the heavy Legion presence around it. With the help of Kalecgos and &lt;a href=\"Millhouse%20Manastorm\"&gt;Millhouse Manastorm&lt;/a&gt;, wishing to obtain the Nightborn Soulstone after being released from his prison, the Conjuror of the Tirisgarde managed to find Vargoth, proving that it was corrupted by the Legion, and leading Kalec to contact the Council of Six about the Archmage's betrayal. Following this mission, Millhouse Manastorm offered his help to the Conjuror and joined the Tirisgarde for his personal interests.\nWhile the Conjuror of the Tirisgarde was busy getting a vial of water from the &lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20Azshara\"&gt;Wrath of Azshara&lt;/a&gt;'s body, in order to sustain Meryl for a while as his condition has become dire, the Tirisgarde discovered that the &lt;a href=\"Oculus\"&gt;Oculus&lt;/a&gt; had fallen to the Burning Legion and was heavily shielded, the order subsequently sent troops to find a way to gain access inside. In the Oculus, the Conjuror of the Tirisgarde managed to find and free Vargoth who explained that he had never betrayed Dalaran and the Kirin tor, but that he was betrayed by the Empyrean Society and fell into the clutches of Kathra'natir who made him his puppet, using the Nightborne Soulstone to drain Meryl of his power. With the help of Archmage Vargoth, Archmage Khadgar, Archmage Kalec, Archmage Modera, the Conjuror succeeded in defeating the dreadlord and locking him in the soulstone, which later served to fuel Dalaran's weapons and defenses against the Legion with the help of &lt;a href=\"Aethas%20Sunreaver\"&gt;Aethas Sunreaver&lt;/a&gt;. Vargoth then entered the Tirisgarde to thank the Conjuror for saving his reputation and his life.\nFor their many exploits, the Conjuror of the Tirisgarde obtained the title of Archmage from Archmage Khadgar, and later the &lt;a href=\"Archmage%27s%20Prismatic%20Disc\"&gt;Archmage's Prismatic Disc&lt;/a&gt; created with the help of Kalec from the plans of &lt;a href=\"Antonidas\"&gt;Antonidas&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing their victory, the Tirisgarde joined the other orders, represented by Meryl Felstorm, to form the &lt;a href=\"Armies%20of%20Legionfall\"&gt;Armies of Legionfall&lt;/a&gt;. Their mages were present to repel the legion's assault on &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; and to fight alongside their allies during the &lt;a href=\"Assault%20on%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Assault on Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;. They were also present on &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;, accompanying the Conjuror of the Tirisgarde to fight the demons and protect the \"&lt;a href=\"Vindicaar\"&gt;Vindicaar&lt;/a&gt;\".\nShadowlands.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the Tirisgarde appear in the mage section of the &lt;a href=\"Training%20Hall\"&gt;Training Hall&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Barracks%20%28Orgrimmar%29\"&gt;Barracks&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"Frazzle%20Frostfingers\"&gt;Frazzle Frostfingers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Azunla\"&gt;Azunla&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Feenix%20Arcshine\"&gt;Feenix Arcshine&lt;/a&gt; as mage trainers.\nMembers.\nTroops.\nThey deploy water elementals, &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Golem\"&gt;Arcane Golem&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Tirisgarde%20Apprentice\"&gt;Tirisgarde Apprentice&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor%20Invoker\"&gt;Kirin Tor Invoker&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor%20Guardian\"&gt;Kirin Tor Guardian&lt;/a&gt;s.

It said that they may not know him, but it needed their help. It feared they had little time. the mage was to meet the speaker at the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Gate\"&gt;Violet Gate&lt;/a&gt; swiftly so all could be explained. There, the mage hero approached &lt;a href=\"Meryl%20Felstorm\"&gt;Meryl Felstorm&lt;/a&gt;, kneeling at the center of the innermost room. Meryl explained to the hero that he thought he could banish &lt;a href=\"Kathra%27natir\"&gt;Kathra'natir&lt;/a&gt; once and for all, but instead the &lt;a href=\"dreadlord\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; broke free. He was afraid that the demon might have been privy to his secrets - such as those of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Council of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt; - in the years he spent trapped within Meryl's body. The damage he could do with this knowledge was unthinkable, and as such he had to be stopped.\nMeryl Felstorm.\nMeryl further explained that though the dreadlord had escaped his grasp, he knew what his next step would be. Kathra'natir sought an ancient relic called the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20the%20Guardian\"&gt;Forge of the Guardian&lt;/a&gt;, used for centuries by the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Council of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt; to infuse their power into the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"The%20Guardian\"&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt;. The Forge was hidden away in the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Hold\"&gt;Violet Hold&lt;/a&gt; - the most secure location in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a place few would think to look. Its location was known only to the Council themselves, but the dreadlord now had this knowledge too.\nThe mage hero asked for further information about who the strange undead figure was, to which Meryl replied that he did tend to forget that his name was not well known these days. &lt;a href=\"Meryl%20Felstorm\"&gt;Meryl Felstorm&lt;/a&gt; was once known as Meryl Winterstorm. He was a founding member of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Council of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt;, but was required to abandon his duties when he became possessed by the dreadlord &lt;a href=\"Kathra%27natir\"&gt;Kathra'natir&lt;/a&gt;. Though he was able to contain him, the risk was too great for him to remain on the Council. He had since dedicated his life to finding a way to banish the demon once and for all. It seemed he had failed.\nThe mage hero also wanted to know more about the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20the%20Guardian\"&gt;Forge of the Guardian&lt;/a&gt;. Meryl told them that it was an artifact of incredible power, devised by the Archmage &lt;a href=\"Alodi\"&gt;Alodi&lt;/a&gt; as a method of permanently transferring the arcane power of many mages into the body of one, thus creating a &lt;a href=\"The%20Guardian\"&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt; of Tirisfal. The last time it was used was in the time of &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt;, who refused to return her powers so another Guardian could be imbued.\nKathra'natir.\nAs they made haste to the Violet Hold, Meryl explained that in ages past, the Forge of the Guardian was a source of great power for the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Council of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt;. When the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0learned of the Forge's existence, the Council knew it had to be hidden somewhere safe. It was thus secreted to the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Hold\"&gt;Violet Hold&lt;/a&gt;. Approaching the gates of the Hold, Meryl's fears turned out to be well-founded as they found corpses laying on the ground, charred with &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; magic. The dreadlord was already inside.\nOpening the gates to the Hold, they found &lt;a href=\"Kathra%27natir\"&gt;Kathra'natir&lt;/a&gt;, overlooking the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20the%20Guardian\"&gt;Forge of the Guardian&lt;/a&gt; and draining it of its power with siphoning rifts. Together they engaged the dreadlord, but he proved much too powerful. Claiming that they needed the power of the Forge, Meryl temporarily encased Kathra'natir in a tomb of ice, which gave the mage hero accompanying him enough time to find a way past the dreadlord's fel barrier and destroy the rifts siphoning power from the Forge. When the mage activated the Forge, the spirit of &lt;a href=\"Alodi\"&gt;Alodi&lt;/a&gt; mentally reached out to them and told them to use its powers in order to defeat Kathra'natir, and send him back to the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;.\nAn immense orb of energy formed above the Forge, and began channeling into the mage hero as they were lifted up in the air. When they landed back on the ground, they had become the Guardian. Meanwhile, the dreadlord had broken free from his icy prison and begun strangling Meryl in mid-air with shadow magic. As he was about to finish him, the empowered mage hero interrupted the demon, and managed to kill him. Kathra'natir gone, the hero returned the powers of the Forge, which left the hero's body, and manifested in the form of &lt;a href=\"Alodi\"&gt;Alodi&lt;/a&gt;'s ghost.\nAlodi told Meryl that Kathra'natir was still a threat for his defeat was only temporary, and that he would return and seek the Forge again as soon as he regained his strength in the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Meryl\"&gt;Meryl&lt;/a&gt;, deeming the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Hold\"&gt;Violet Hold&lt;/a&gt; no longer safe, asked the mage hero and Alodi to join forces. They approached the Forge and together, they cast a teleportation spell to move the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20the%20Guardian\"&gt;Forge of the Guardian&lt;/a&gt; to a safer location.\nThe Hall of the Guardian.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20the%20Guardian\"&gt;Hall of the Guardian&lt;/a&gt; hadn't seen any use since the disbanding of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Council of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt;, and it pained &lt;a href=\"Alodi\"&gt;Alodi&lt;/a&gt; to see it in such state. Though it was in disrepair, Meryl claimed that the wards protecting this place were still strong, and that it would serve their needs. It was clear now that the hall of the Tirisgarde had to be rebuilt to face the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s threat. Meryl's plan consisted in reforming the &lt;a href=\"Tirisgarde\"&gt;Tirisgarde&lt;/a&gt;, and making the mage hero its first champion. He explained that the foundation of the\u00a0Tirisgarde's strength lied in the ancient artifacts wielded by its champions and, as such, the hero's first task was to retrieve one such artifact. But first, Meryl taught the mage hero how to teleport to this place and pass through the protecting runes by themselves. Then, the mage hero browsed through the master appendix of the Hall's library, which listed every artifact known to the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Council of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt;, and went to retrieve the one of their choice.\nThe mage was equipped, and Meryl could sense the power of the artifact they held. It would do well against the Legion as it was, but Meryl believed they had the ability to unlock its power even further. He explained that the Forge was not only used to create &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardians&lt;/a&gt; : it also served as a font of arcane energy which could be used to manipulate and empower such artifacts. This power would allow the Tirisgarde to gain the upper hand against &lt;a href=\"Kathra%27natir\"&gt;Kathra'natir&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, and so he asked the hero to be the first to tap into it.\nAfter unlocking the weapon's untapped power, Meryl said that the artifact was well on its way to reaching its true potential. But even with this power they wouldn't be able to fight the Legion alone, they needed to begin recruiting other mages to their cause. Unfortunately, the protective wards surrounding the Hall were prohibitive to this. After all, Meryl couldn't personally teleport every one of them there.\nReforming the Tirisgarde.\n&lt;a href=\"Meryl\"&gt;Meryl&lt;/a&gt; spoke of a goblin who was a master of portals and teleportation by the name of &lt;a href=\"The%20Great%20Akazamzarak\"&gt;Akazamzarak&lt;/a&gt;. His talents had gone mostly unnoticed, however, since he mostly used them for chicanery : he was a street performer. Fortunately for them, he was performing right in the streets of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, grifting coins from the unenlightened masses. The mage hero thus took a bag of gold to see if they could convince the Great Akazamzarak to change vocations, and headed towards the &lt;a href=\"Eventide\"&gt;Eventide&lt;/a&gt; where he was situated.\nAkazamzarak replied to the offer positively, saying he would gladly help them move mages around, if the price was right. Akazamzarak managed to bring them both back to the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20the%20Guardian\"&gt;Hall of the Guardian&lt;/a&gt;, even through the runes. Upon arrival, Meryl asked the goblin if he could manage the portals, handing him the locations. Indeed, Meryl had already sent word to many talented mages who could help, and they now awaited transportation to the Hall, where they would begin their new purpose. Akazamzarak thus created plenty of portals through the protective wards, to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; again, and the &lt;a href=\"Borean%20Tundra\"&gt;Borean Tundra&lt;/a&gt;. Mages from all around the world stepped through and arrived to the famous Hall of the Guardian, and Meryl held the following speech:\nThe Broken Isles.\nThe Tirisgarde reformed, it was time for their mission to begin. The order needed leaders however, and though Meryl was an experienced mage, he claimed to be no strategist. The mage hero however had proven themselves capable, in both their past exploits and present. In presence of many of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s greatest mages, Meryl officially dubbed them Conjuror of the Tirisgarde. This ancient title symbolized the awesome responsibility borne by the Tirisgarde.\nWhile Meryl had personal business to attend to, the Conjuror met with their new goblin ally in the War Room, from where they would begin planning their next steps. &lt;a href=\"The%20Great%20Akazamzarak\"&gt;Akazamzarak&lt;/a&gt; believed that they should keep up the recruiting and, fortunately, he believed that nobody negotiated contracts like a goblin. While the Conjuror decided on where they would first take the fight to the demons, Akazamzarak started the recruiting. The Conjuror thus started the search for the &lt;a href=\"Pillars%20of%20Creation\"&gt;Pillars of Creation&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;.\nMeryl's summon.\nWhen the Conjuror returned to &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, Meryl reached out to them and told them they were needed in the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20the%20Guardian\"&gt;Hall of the Guardian&lt;/a&gt;. There, he explained that the Tirisgarde\u00a0had been defunct for ages. To defeat the Burning Legion, the Tirisgarde first had to recruit the greatest of champions to fight by their side. Two of the most powerful mages in Azeroth's present and past, &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Archmage Kalec&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Modera\"&gt;Archmage Modera&lt;/a&gt;, had come to help them succeed. The Conjuror of the Tirisgarde spoke to them, as they were exemplary representatives of their order, and enlisted their aid.\nWhile not everyone on the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Six\"&gt;Council of Six&lt;/a&gt; agreed with her, Modera believed it was imperative for them to work together in order to defeat the Burning Legion once and for all. It was nice for her to see the Tirisgarde rise again. Similarly, Kalec was honored to fight alongside the Conjuror of the Tirisgarde in these dark times. The blue dragonflight had always represented magic on\u00a0Azeroth, and it was fitting for them to work together against the\u00a0Legion now more than ever\nPreparations.\nDuring this time, &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Melis\"&gt;Archmage Melis&lt;/a&gt; had been hard at work getting the Tirisgarde's command room up and running. She explained to the Conjuror that they could direct their allies to carry out vital assignments across the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt; through the Scouting Map. The first task happened to be critical. &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Omniara\"&gt;Archmage Omniara&lt;/a&gt;, a renowned summoner, was on her way to the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20the%20Guardian\"&gt;Hall of the Guardian&lt;/a&gt; when she was attacked. Uniquely suited to this task, Archmage Kalecgos was sent to her aid by the Conjuror. Safe and sound, Omniara agreed to join the Tirisgarde. A very powerful arcanist, her skills would prove to be quite an asset to the Tirisgarde. Capable of summoning multiple water elementals at the same time, she became a recruiter, and her elementals would become invaluable troops in the fight against the Burning Legion.\nThe Tirisgarde quickly after received word of survivors near the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, but the area was still crawling with demons. Troops were sent to help with the rescue, and they returned with &lt;a href=\"Chronicler%20Elrianne\"&gt;Chronicler Elrianne&lt;/a&gt; among the survivors. A well-respected archivist from the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;, she also spent several months studying with the pandaren in their library in &lt;a href=\"Tian%20Monastery\"&gt;Tian Monastery&lt;/a&gt;. Her knowledge of ancient magic would be invaluable to the order, and Elrianne offered upgrades to the Hall of the Guardian.\nSince the Broken Isles were the epicenter of ancient night elven learning, countless powerful magical artifacts were secreted away in forgotten vaults and reliquaries. The Conjuror of the Tirisgarde sent a few champions in order to secure some of them so they wouldn't fall into the wrong hands.\nThe Empyrean Society.\n&lt;a href=\"Meryl\"&gt;Meryl&lt;/a&gt; fell terribly sick, and had to spend his days lying in bed. &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Vargoth\"&gt;Archmage Vargoth&lt;/a&gt;'s long-time apprentice, &lt;a href=\"Ravandwyr\"&gt;Ravandwyr&lt;/a&gt;, arrived at the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20the%20Guardian\"&gt;Hall of the Guardian&lt;/a&gt; with an urgent message from his mentor. He informed the Conjuror that one of their champions had discovered some sort of powerful magic emanating from the secretive &lt;a href=\"Empyrean%20Society%20Enclave\"&gt;Empyrean Society Enclave&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Azsuna\"&gt;Azsuna&lt;/a&gt;. He explained that Archmage Vargoth had asked him to request &lt;a href=\"Meryl%20Felstorm\"&gt;Meryl&lt;/a&gt;'s aid in investigating it, but since Meryl was too ill to travel at the moment, he asked the Conjuror if they were willing to go in his place. They accepted, and Meryl thanked them for taking over for him, before choking and coughing up bile.\nIn order to gain entrance to the Enclave, the Conjuror would need to prove themselves. Ravandwyr explained that the &lt;a href=\"Empyrean%20Society\"&gt;Empyrean Society&lt;/a&gt; was a dangerous cult. They claimed to study all magic regardless of its source, but in reality they focused mostly on the forbidden. The only way for them to welcome the Conjuror to their enclave was for the latter to bring them a magical artifact. The &lt;a href=\"Hatecoil\"&gt;Hatecoil&lt;/a&gt; naga in &lt;a href=\"Azsuna\"&gt;Azsuna&lt;/a&gt; had just found the perfect gift - a &lt;a href=\"Pearl%20of%20Arcane%20Wisdom\"&gt;Pearl of Arcane Wisdom&lt;/a&gt;, and magically preserved scrolls from the depths beneath the &lt;a href=\"Nar%27thalas%20Academy\"&gt;Nar'thalas Academy&lt;/a&gt;. Traveling to the &lt;a href=\"Hatecoil%20Warcamp\"&gt;Hatecoil Warcamp&lt;/a&gt;, the Conjuror recovered the precious gifts and met Ravandwyr on the road just north of the Empyrean Enclave. As they approached, he overheard Ravandwyr tell the elf that accompanied him, &lt;a href=\"Esara%20Verrinde\"&gt;Esara Verrinde&lt;/a&gt;, to be on their guard, for even experienced mages had an alarming tendency to disappear around the Enclave.\nInvestigating the cult.\nNobody knew much about the Empyrean Society's activities here, but now that the Conjuror appeared to be one of their new recruit, they would be able to ask some questions and take a look around for the strange magic that &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Vargoth\"&gt;Archmage Vargoth&lt;/a&gt; detected. The Conjuror of the Tirisgarde partnered with Esara, and together they split ways with &lt;a href=\"Ravandwyr\"&gt;Ravandwyr&lt;/a&gt; to cover more ground before meeting again at the rotunda on the hill.\nEsara and the Conjuror proceeded to examine the camp and question many members of the organization. The Conjuror brought the Pearl of Arcane Wisdom to one of the Empyrean disciples, who claimed that &lt;a href=\"Marlan%20Blackfire\"&gt;\"Marlan\"&lt;/a&gt; had to first evaluate their gift before he could speak with them further. Investigating\u00a0a brazier, Esara couldn't see anything unusual about it; it looked to be in pretty good shape for something so ancient. The building they approached however had a fel rune locking its door. The Empyrean Society should not be using such magic, proclaimed Esara. A book then caught their eye, but as they tried to recover it, the human &lt;a href=\"Marlan%20Blackfire\"&gt;Marlan Blackfire&lt;/a&gt; assaulted them.\nThe corrupted mage slain, &lt;a href=\"Esara%20Verrinde\"&gt;Esara&lt;/a&gt; told the Conjuror that she knew something was off about the Empyrean, but she did not suspect this. The Empyrean Society was certainly much more dangerous than they appeared. She said that it was unimaginable that any mage would study fel magic - that it was for warlocks and the Legion only. Since their friend Ravandwyr appeared to be delayed, Esara and the Conjuror decided to deal with the sect themselves so they wouldn't corrupt anyone else. They thus slayed many of their members, confiscated as many &lt;a href=\"Blasphemy\"&gt;blasphemous&lt;/a&gt;, fel-inscribed tomes of demonic spells as possible, and recovered a &lt;a href=\"Rune%20of%20Opening%20%28quest%20item%29\"&gt;fel rune of opening&lt;/a&gt; in the process.\nA secret revealed.\n&lt;a href=\"Esara%20Verrinde\"&gt;Esara&lt;/a&gt; believed that they had certainly reduced the &lt;a href=\"Empyrean%20Society\"&gt;Empyrean Society&lt;/a&gt;'s numbers, and that they wouldn't be luring any more members to their cause for a while. She held this matter at heart, for her own family had died at the hands of the Legion. There was only one place they hadn't investigated yet however, the Headquarters of the Empyrean Society. She suspected that the rune they found was attuned to their door, so the Conjuror used the rune of opening to unlock the building's door, only to find Ravandwyr encased in a fel-crystal by &lt;a href=\"Nora%20Blackfire\"&gt;Nora Blackfire&lt;/a&gt; who, oddly, claimed that &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Vargoth\"&gt;Archmage Vargoth&lt;/a&gt; would hear of this intrusion. After killing her and freeing &lt;a href=\"Ravandwyr\"&gt;Ravandwyr&lt;/a&gt;, the elf explained that he thought he'd snoop around a bit before meeting the Conjuror and Esara at the rotunda, but his invisibility spell wore off at an inopportune time.\nIn Nora's fel chest, the Conjuror found a missive from Archmage Vargoth sealed with fel magic, which they handed to Ravandwyr. The latter found it hard to believe that Archmage Vargoth would be involved with such a malevolent group, and that there had to be a good explanation for why he'd been here. Regardless, all returned to the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20the%20Guardian\"&gt;Hall of the Guardian&lt;/a&gt; to inform Meryl about what they had uncovered here.\nBad news.\nAs the Conjuror entered Meryl's room, he found him surrounded by Ravandwyr and the other champions. &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Archmage Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; himself had come to watch over his old friend. Ravandwyr thanked the Archmage for coming so quickly, and told him that Meryl was declining very quickly. Khadgar believed that Meryl's illness was magical in nature, and that Ravandwyr was right to summon him. Meryl groaned and clutched his stomach. There had to be more books on magical illness around the Hall somewhere, muttered Khadgar. He knew there had to be something that could help Meryl.\nEsara came to the Conjuror, and told them they had proven to be quite successful together. She would be happy to lend them her swords and spells against the\u00a0Burning Legion. Ravandwyr said that he had been Archmage Vargoth's apprentice for far too long. Perhaps it was time for him to serve a new master, he thought. He would be honored if they would accept him as their champion. &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Melis\"&gt;Archmage Melis&lt;/a&gt; then told the Conjuror that &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Conjurer%20Mimic\"&gt;Grand Conjurer Mimic&lt;/a&gt; had arrived as a recruiter to aid the Tirisgarde in bolstering their numbers. Mimic sought out the most promising apprentices and trained them very quickly, her former students being some of the most powerful conjurors in the land.\nMeeting with the Council.\nKhadgar explained that &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Vargoth\"&gt;Archmage Vargoth&lt;/a&gt;'s involvement with the &lt;a href=\"Empyrean%20Society\"&gt;Empyrean Society&lt;/a&gt; was indeed troubling. However, as he had proven his loyalty to the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; many times, he deserved the benefit of the doubt, for now. Still, Khadgar was obligated to share his concerns with the rest of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Six\"&gt;Council of Six&lt;/a&gt;. While the Conjuror would travel to &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; to meet with them in the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Citadel\"&gt;Violet Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, he'd remain there to care of Meryl.\n&lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Ansirem%20Runeweaver\"&gt;Archmage Ansirem Runeweaver&lt;/a&gt; told the Conjuror that the Council did not tolerate misconduct amongst their own. However, if the Conjuror's accusation against Archmage Vargoth proved malicious, the consequences would be severe. &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Archmage Kalec&lt;/a&gt; intervened, saying that he had been following the Conjuror for some time now and that these were not spurious charges. He too had observed Archmage Vargoth behaving oddly. \"As have I\", added &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Karlain\"&gt;Archmage Karlain&lt;/a&gt;. He could confirm that Vargoth had indeed been quite preoccupied of late. If it was true that Archmage Vargoth was exploring\u00a0&lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0magic, Runeweaver would be shocked, he said. Still, Runeweaver owed the Conjuror their thanks in bringing this matter to their attention.\nRuneweaver added that &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Vargoth\"&gt;Archmage Vargoth&lt;/a&gt; had been absent for a while. He authorized the Conjuror of the Tirisgarde to take a look around Vargoth's living quarters right above in the citadel tower. Runeweaver held out hope that their esteemed colleague was merely up to his usual eccentricities. Escorted there through portal by &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt;, the Conjuror entered Vargoth's retreat and examined the surroundings.\nThe search for Vargoth.\nVargoth's journal, titled \"\"The Nightborne Soulstone\",\" contained notes about the eponymous relic. Supposedly the energy of the captured souls stored within it could be channeled directly from the stone. If that was true, it would be a very powerful relic indeed, noted Kalec.\nA worried Kalecgos explained that Archmage Vargoth seemed to be indeed mixed up in something dangerous, though that wasn't unusual for an Archmage of his caliber and experience. He believed that Vargoth may have headed towards the &lt;a href=\"Arcway\"&gt;Arcway&lt;/a&gt; Vaults, but he suggested they investigated all leads first, in order to get a better idea of what Vargoth was up to. The Conjuror thus sent many of his champions to investigate Archmage Vargoth's travels.\nThey were sent to &lt;a href=\"Khadgar%27s%20Tower\"&gt;Khadgar's Tower&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Talador\"&gt;Talador&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Draenor%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;alternate Draenor&lt;/a&gt; to ask &lt;a href=\"Zooti%20Fizzlefury\"&gt;Zooti Fizzlefury&lt;/a&gt;, Vargoth's closest friend and confident. They were also sent to the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Nar%27thalas%20Academy\"&gt;Nar'thalas Academy&lt;/a&gt; because there was evidence that Vargoth had visited it recently. A champion was also sent to &lt;a href=\"Tel%27anor\"&gt;Tel'anor&lt;/a&gt; since one of the magical tomes they found in his retreat came from there, and another to &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt; for a &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Ball\"&gt;crystal ball&lt;/a&gt; they found in the same study used to belong to &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grommash Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the mean time, the mage &lt;a href=\"Edirah\"&gt;Edirah&lt;/a&gt; joined the Tirisgarde as researcher of artifact histories, since her head would be in a book whether she was supported by the Tirisgarde or not. Learning more about these powerful weapons was critical to the fight against the Legion, she believed. By supplying the resources to keep them going, the Conjuror could assign more researchers on the job to turn out results faster.\nMeryl's illness.\nKhadgar found Meryl's illness troubling. He had seen something similar before, but he couldn't think of its name. He asked the Conjuror to talk to his friend, &lt;a href=\"Ari\"&gt;Ari&lt;/a&gt;. She had lived in the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20the%20Guardian\"&gt;Hall of the Guardian&lt;/a&gt; since it was last in use. If a tome on magical afflictions was to be found here, she would know where to look.\nThat Khadgar trusted the Conjuror meant much to Ari. She indeed knew of the book in which they sought, but the book did not want to be found. It was old and angry and thirsted for power. To mollify and convince it to emerge from hiding in the proper way, Ari asked the Conjuror to bring it a gift of &lt;a href=\"Nightwell\"&gt;Nightwell&lt;/a&gt; energy from the &lt;a href=\"Nightborne\"&gt;Nightborne&lt;/a&gt; elves in &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt; City.\nThe Conjuror thus went and siphoned many vials of Nightwell energy - power in its purest form, a fitting gift for a book of healing - to which the book, \"Arcanists Guide to Rare Diseases\", eventually reacted. Ari packaged the book up for them to bring to Khadgar, wrapping it in moth's wings to keep it soothed and light-hearted. She also insisted in gifting the Conjuror with her own wooden ring, a simple, smooth ring carved from heartwood.\nReturning to Khadgar, he explained that Ari was much more than she appeared. She was once one of the most powerful\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Archmage\"&gt;archmagi&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0on\u00a0Azeroth\u00a0and a member of the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Council of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, her mind was badly damaged and she had not left the\u00a0Hall of the Guardian\u00a0since. She had to like the Conjuror very much to have given them her ring as a gift, he thought. If they brought her something special in return, he suspected she would surprise them. He told the Conjuror that she preferred things in threes. The Conjuror thus went and collected a &lt;a href=\"Glittering%20Necklace\"&gt;glittering necklace&lt;/a&gt;, said to be woven from the light of a thousand stars, a &lt;a href=\"Handful%20of%20Ancient%20Golden%20Discs\"&gt;handful of ancient, faintly glowing golden discs&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"Cask%20of%20Honey%20Brew\"&gt;cask of honey brew&lt;/a&gt;, which smelled of sunlight and laughter. Ari was in awe.\nAri said that she could do a few magic tricks if she set her mind to it. Focusing her energy, she summoned a new champion for the Conjuror, an &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Destroyer\"&gt;Arcane Destroyer&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Arcway Vaults.\nA champion could eventually confirm that Archmage Vargoth had been seen entering the &lt;a href=\"Arcway\"&gt;Arcway&lt;/a&gt; Vaults in &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt;. However, the champion in question was unable to penetrate very far inside the Vaults due to the heavy &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt; presence around it. Hopefully, the Conjuror would have a better chance, said &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Melis\"&gt;Melis&lt;/a&gt;. Kalec awaited them on the ridge overlooking &lt;a href=\"Felsoul%20Hold\"&gt;Felsoul Hold&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe dragon explained to the Conjuror that the Vaults had been buried and untouched for thousands of years. The Legion however made them accessible once again, though Kalec would've preferred them to remain hidden. He believed that they were not far behind Archmage Vargoth's heels and that he may yet be inside the Vaults.The blue dragon spread his wings, and took the Conjuror on his back. He explained that the Arcway Vaults had likely been breached by Legion invaders as well as their old friend,\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Millhouse%20Manastorm\"&gt;Millhouse Manastorm&lt;/a&gt;. Although he was far from trustworthy, he suspected they may be able to take advantage of his rather creative skills.\nUpon landing at the entrance of the Vaults, the massive dragon killed two demons, and would remain there to keep the demon armies busy outside while the Conjuror headed in. Before parting ways, Kalec added that &lt;a href=\"Millhouse%20Manastorm\"&gt;Millhouse Manastorm&lt;/a&gt; had been quite vociferous about his intention to acquire the &lt;a href=\"Nightborne%20Soulstone\"&gt;Nightborne Soulstone&lt;/a&gt;, and that if they found him, they may as well make use of him. However, he was unpredictable at best and they should always watch their back around him, he added. Kalec finally gave the Conjuror a crystal to contact him once Milhouse was located.\nA revelation.\nInside the Vaults, the Conjuror did find Milhouse, imprisoned within a cage. They retrieved the key from the overlooking inquisitor demon who, oddly, yelled before dying that Vargoth had already won. The gnome freed, Milhouse said that he had heard a lot of the Conjuror lately. As the two advanced further into the Vaults, the image of Kalec appeared through the crystal.\nKalec told the Conjuror that when their champions first visited the Vaults, they made a good dent in thinning out the enemy's numbers. However, they also discovered a number of starving prisoners who could use their help. They thus saved many prisoners and conjured food and water to get them up on their feet, and eradicated as many demons as they could. Adventuring deeper into the Vaults, the Conjuror of the Tirisgarde and Milhouse finally stumbled upon &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Vargoth\"&gt;Archmage Vargoth&lt;/a&gt;, who immediately encased them both in a ring of felfrost.\nHe claimed that the Nightborne Soulstone was his, and that they were becoming quite a nuisance. A fel portal suddenly opened and from it &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Kyranith\"&gt;Lady Kyranith&lt;/a&gt; arrived. Vargoth ordered her to meet him at the &lt;a href=\"Oculus\"&gt;Oculus&lt;/a&gt; once she'd taken care of \"our overly ambitious friends here\". Kalec would say he was surprised by this terrible turn of events, but nothing surprised him of late. It is dark times when even the most upstanding of us can fall, he said. Kalec went to meet with the Council of Six, and the Conjuror returned to the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20the%20Guardian\"&gt;Hall of the Guardian&lt;/a&gt; to inform Archmage Khadgar of Vargoth's betrayal. There, &lt;a href=\"Millhouse%20Manastorm\"&gt;Millhouse Manastorm&lt;/a&gt; accepted to join the ranks of the Tirisgarde.\nA terrible loss.\n&lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Vargoth\"&gt;Archmage Vargoth&lt;/a&gt;'s betrayal was an unimaginable loss to the cause. But before dealing with him, Meryl's condition had become dire. Unfortunately, it was not an illness at all according to Khadgar, but a magical attack of fel origin. He suspected Meryl's old nemesis &lt;a href=\"Kathra%27natir\"&gt;Kathra'natir&lt;/a&gt; was behind it, and he needed to buy him time. He explained that the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Azshara\"&gt;Eye of Azshara&lt;/a&gt; contained a vast store of arcane energy from &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt; herself, and that a vial of water from the &lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20Azshara\"&gt;Wrath of Azshara&lt;/a&gt;'s body would sustain Meryl for a while. Before the Conjuror headed there, Khadgar also explained that the\u00a0Tirisgarde\u00a0had received requests from across the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0for aid in fighting the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. While they continued pursuing\u00a0Vargoth, they could not forget that their primary mission was to repel the\u00a0demons\u00a0and protect\u00a0Azeroth.\nThe Conjuror returned with the vial of arcane energy, which would sustain Meryl for a while. Khadgar however held bad news in return. He told them that the &lt;a href=\"Nexus\"&gt;Nexus&lt;/a&gt; appeared to have fallen to the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, and was heavily shielded. The Conjuror immediately sent their champions to figure out a way to get inside.\nFirst, the Tirisgarde needed to boost their power if they were to break through the wards surrounding the Oculus. Champions were thus sent to the Ley Ruins of Zarkhenar, that were continually spilling out ley energy. &lt;a href=\"Eternos\"&gt;Eternos&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"bronze%20dragonflight\"&gt;bronze dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; then contacted the Tirisgarde to request for aid and report a Legion invasion near the Bronze Dragonshrine in Dragonblight. &lt;a href=\"Belgaristrasz\"&gt;Belgaristrasz&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; also contacted the mage-guard with a plan to retake the Oculus. He needed as many Legion communication devices as could be found. &lt;a href=\"Verdisa\"&gt;Verdisa&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"green%20dragonflight\"&gt;green dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; too asked for help in capturing roving satyr warbands in Val'sharah.\nThough Verdisa, Belgaristrasz, and Eternos were reluctant to return to the Oculus themselves, some of their strongest drakes would however aid the Tirisgarde if the mages cleared the way. The champions had done well. Khadgar believed he would be able to get the Conjuror into the Oculus now.\nThe Oculus.\n&lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; feared that &lt;a href=\"Kathra%27natir\"&gt;Kathra'natir&lt;/a&gt; was behind the attack on &lt;a href=\"Meryl\"&gt;Meryl&lt;/a&gt;, and he suspected that &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Vargoth\"&gt;Archmage Vargoth&lt;/a&gt;'s involvement was no coincidence. With little time to act, he expressed that it greatly pained him to order the destruction of an Archmage of his caliber and worse, someone he once called friend. Indeed, &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; couldn't permit his betrayal to stand unpunished. It was time to follow him into the Oculus.\nThe Conjuror, ready, asked Archmage Khadgar to send them through the wards of the &lt;a href=\"Oculus\"&gt;Oculus&lt;/a&gt;, where dragons from all dragonflights had come to take the &lt;a href=\"Nexus\"&gt;Nexus&lt;/a&gt; back. The goal was to repel the Legion's invasion by closing the demons' portals and sending them back to the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;. As the Conjuror fought through waves of demons, they managed to close many gateways. They then used an arcane portal to travel to the center &lt;a href=\"Band%20of%20Transmutation\"&gt;Band of Transmutation&lt;/a&gt;. There, in the middle of the ring, &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Vargoth\"&gt;Archmage Vargoth&lt;/a&gt; was being held captive, floating in the air as three powerful eredar magi channeled fel energy into him.\nThe Conjuror slew the fel magi, freeing Vargoth, who thanked them immensely. The Conjuror turned to the Archmage, and ordered him to explain himself and why he had betrayed the Kirin Tor. Vargoth replied that he had never betrayed their cause : he was gathering notes on the &lt;a href=\"Nightborne%20Soulstone\"&gt;Nightborne Soulstone&lt;/a&gt; when he was contacted by an emissary of the &lt;a href=\"Empyrean%20Society\"&gt;Empyrean Society&lt;/a&gt;. When Vargoth arrived at their &lt;a href=\"Empyrean%20Society%20Enclave\"&gt;enclave&lt;/a&gt;, their old nemesis &lt;a href=\"Kathra%27natir\"&gt;Kathra'natir&lt;/a&gt; was waiting for him. He'd been in his head ever since, controlling his every word and action. The Conjuror then asked him if the dreadlord was indeed behind the attack on Meryl, to which Vargoth replied positively. Kathra'natir was using the Soulstone and the power of the &lt;a href=\"Nexus\"&gt;Nexus&lt;/a&gt; to drain Meryl of his power. But together, Vargoth and the Conjuror could stop him.\nThe two magi teleported to ground level, but the Nexus building inside which Kathra'natir was dwelling was heavily guarded. Using an invisibility spell, they bypassed the demonic defenses and infiltrated the &lt;a href=\"Nexus\"&gt;Nexus&lt;/a&gt;. There, the dreadlord was channeling the power of the &lt;a href=\"Nightborne%20Soulstone\"&gt;Nightborne Soulstone&lt;/a&gt; against an image of &lt;a href=\"Meryl\"&gt;Meryl&lt;/a&gt;. As they engaged him, Archmage &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;, Archmage &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; and Archmage &lt;a href=\"Modera\"&gt;Modera&lt;/a&gt; suddenly appeared. They began channeling a spell of arcane banish at Kathra'natir; focusing, Khadgar told the Conjuror to use the Nightborne Soulstone while they held the dreadlord off. The Conjuror rushed to the Soulstone and activated it, forcibly drawing the demon inside the relic. The magi cheered, for Kathra'natir was now safely imprisoned. Everyone was brought back to the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20the%20Guardian\"&gt;Hall of the Guardian&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the Soulstone for safekeeping.\nConclusion.\nAt the Hall of the Guardian, an ashamed Vargoth said that it was sobering to think of how easily Kathra'natir subverted his will. Thanks to the Conjuror's hard work, Vargoth was free and the dreadlord was not. He thanked them for saving his reputation, not to mention his life. Without their persistence, he would still be hanging above the &lt;a href=\"Nexus\"&gt;Nexus&lt;/a&gt; yet, he claimed. Meryl in turn explained that when they defeated Kathra'natir, he felt a great weight leave his mind. He had not been this well in an eternity. The Nightborne Soulstone rendered Kathra'natir completely powerless, and the Conjuror had his utmost gratitude. He would be honored to impart his wisdom to them as they led the fight against the demons once again.\nKhadgar, after having witnessed the Conjuror do the unimaginable, proclaimed that everyone was now in their debt. He was proud to henceforth finally bestow upon them the title of Archmage.\nMeryl approached the newly elevated Archmage. He told them that in their short time together, they had done much for their order. Through the Conjuror's words and deeds, all had been inspired to redouble efforts, and Meryl was proud to report that they discovered a new technique that may be of use to them, and to show them the fruit of their research. As they approached the Forge of the Guardian, Meryl held the following speech:"}

Although they are slow to action as well as anger, they are terrible to behold in battle as they are capable of shaping the land and flora around their enemies with startling speed. The tirnenn are responsible for much of the maintenance and crafting work in Ardenweald, such as creating root archways by sticking their arms into the soil and forcing roots out of the ground. They are mostly silent, hard-working, and secretive, and remain more in the background than the other, more active &lt;a href=\"Night%20Fae%20Covenant\"&gt;Night Fae&lt;/a&gt; races.\nThe tirnenn are somehow related to the great trees of Ardenweald, though they are so old and strange that even other Night Fae do not know exactly how. The tirnenn can hear the trees speak to them in song and melody. They consider themselves kin to the trees, and were among the first to grow when the Winter Queen created Ardenweald, and built the groves. Their home is &lt;a href=\"Tirna%20Scithe\"&gt;Tirna Scithe&lt;/a&gt;."}

{"id": "14688", "revid": "53071962", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=14688", "title": "Titan", "text": "The titans (sometimes capitalized) are a &lt;a href=\"race\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt; of colossal, &lt;a href=\"planet\"&gt;planet&lt;/a&gt;-sized cosmic beings, composed of &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; and the primordial matter from which the universe was born. They roamed across the cosmos like walking worlds, imbued with the raw power of creation itself. The titans used this incredible force to find and awaken &lt;a href=\"World-soul\"&gt;others&lt;/a&gt; of their kind. Hailing from the far reaches of the cosmos, they shaped and brought life and order to countless worlds across the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;Great Dark Beyond&lt;/a&gt;. They were described as perfect and majestic beings who are akin to &lt;a href=\"god\"&gt;god&lt;/a&gt;s.\nDescription.\nThe titans are colossal godlike beings made up of the primordial matter from which the very universe was born. Imbued with the raw power of creation itself, they roam the cosmos like walking worlds. Titans are born from &lt;a href=\"world-soul\"&gt;world-soul&lt;/a&gt;s, spirits who are formed within the fiery cores of a small number of worlds and who slumber for ages, suffusing the planets they inhabit with &lt;a href=\"Spirit\"&gt;Spirit&lt;/a&gt; energy before finally awakening. Described as living worlds, their bodies are covered in mountain peaks and rivers, their forms wrapped in cloaks of stardust and their eyes shining like brilliant stars. Bastions of purity and good, the titans are unable to conceive of evil or wickedness in any form.\nTitans are heavily tied to the cosmic force known as &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; and are the embodiments of Order. In fact, arcane is their very lifeblood. The original &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;, an enormous lake of volatile arcane energies, was literally the very lifeblood of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"world-soul\"&gt;world-soul&lt;/a&gt;. They are also uniquely susceptible to &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; magic, their polar opposite. Mature titans are immune to the corruptive influences of the &lt;a href=\"void%20lord\"&gt;void lord&lt;/a&gt;s.\nDespite what is commonly known on Azeroth as history, the titans were in some way connected to the First Ones, the same entities that organized and designed the Pantheon of Death of the Shadowlands, along with the Shadowlands themselves. The titans connection to the Progenitors, and the otherwise unknown facility known as Zereth Ordus, was concealed and forbidden by the command of Odyn, placing Titans as the absolute pinnacle of existence in their records so as not to 'confuse' mortals, in his words.\nIn the RPG.\nMany believe them to simply be a progenitor race, akin to &lt;a href=\"god\"&gt;god&lt;/a&gt;s. Their figure is humanoid but gigantic, with gleaming metallic skin and a perfection of form that makes the heart ache. Each titan cultivates specific interests that relate to particular elements or energy types \u2014 essentially, to some small aspect of creation over which the titan holds a measure of dominance. Some titans refer to the piece of creation upon which they focus as their \"sphere of power\". &lt;a href=\"Furbolg\"&gt;Furbolg&lt;/a&gt;s have legends of seeing the coming of the titans to the world from their homeland in Northrend, implying they predate the titans.\nThere are two types of titan:\nScholars have postulated that there are other subspecies of titans. No titans have ever been spotted, and it is believed that they live among the stars where they continue to this day shaping new worlds. Sargeras is believed to be a &lt;a href=\"vanir\"&gt;vanir&lt;/a&gt; titan as well as a &lt;a href=\"dark%20titan\"&gt;dark titan&lt;/a&gt;. It is believed that there may be other subspecies than the aesir and vanir.\nTitans generally believe they are invincible. They wade into the thickest of battles using their most powerful abilities, or even just swinging with massive, alloyed fists. Titans with well-defined spheres of power have wildly varying combat tactics, focusing primarily upon the strengths of their spheres.\nTitans can be &lt;a href=\"fighter\"&gt;fighter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"barbarian\"&gt;barbarian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"gladiator\"&gt;gladiator&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"healer\"&gt;healer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"druid%20of%20the%20wild\"&gt;druid of the wild&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"expert\"&gt;expert&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"wizard\"&gt;wizard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sorcerer\"&gt;sorcerer&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome accounts of the titans give them titles such as \"Patron of All Life\".\nThe ancient &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Forge\"&gt;Iron Forge&lt;/a&gt; is perhaps the greatest titan artifact ever unearthed."}

The &lt;a href=\"keeper\"&gt;keeper&lt;/a&gt;s would later create more titan-forged through the twin forges, the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Wills\"&gt;Forge of Wills&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Origination\"&gt;Forge of Origination&lt;/a&gt;, in order to compensate the number of titan-forged lost during the &lt;a href=\"War%20between%20the%20titans%20and%20the%20Old%20Gods\"&gt;War on the Black Empire&lt;/a&gt;.\n[[Dark Keeper Aedis|Aedis]], [[Tarneth]] and the [[Dark Keeper (mob)|dark keepers]] of [[Antorus, the Burning Throne|Antorus]] are keepers separate from Azeroth's who have sided with [[Sargeras]] in his [[Burning Crusade]].\nList of titanic creations.\n[[File:Frost giant and earthen.jpg|thumb|A [[frost giant]] and a group of [[earthen]].]]\nTitan-forged.\nThe first generation of titan-forged was divided in [[aesir]], fashioned from metal, and [[vanir]], from stone. They are now collectively known as [[Titanic watchers|watchers]]. A number of them were imbued by the [[Pantheon]]'s members with their specific likeness and powers to lead the titan-forged. Those empowered beings are the nine [[keeper]]s.\nAfter the defeat of the [[Old Gods]], the keepers moved to reshape the surface of the world. To this end, they created a new generation of titan-forged through the [[Forge of Wills]]. \nHistory.\nGenesis.\nUnder the guidance of the great forger [[Khaz'goroth]], the [[Pantheon]] crafted an army of enormous servants from the crust of Azeroth itself: the [[aesir]] and the [[vanir]]. The aesir were fashioned from metal, and they would command the powers of storms. The vanir were formed from stone, and they would hold sway over the earth. The members of the Pantheon then imbued a number of their servants with specific likenesses and powers to lead the rest of the titan-forged. These empowered beings were called the [[Titanic watcher|Keepers]]. Collectively, these mighty creatures would be known as the titan-forged.\nThis new army molded from the world's crust was then sent to war.\nWrath of the titan-forged.\nLed by the keepers, the titan-forged slammed into the Black Empire's northernmost holdings. The resilience and strength of the Pantheon's armies made them an unstoppable force. They unleashed the wrath of gods upon their enemies, scouring legions of [[n'raqi]] and [[aqir]] and sundering their temples.\nThe arrival of the titan-forged caught the Old Gods completely off guard. They reeled in response to these stone- and metal-skinned invaders, but they were determined not to lose control over Azeroth. To reassert their dominance, the Old Gods called upon their greatest lieutenants: the [[elemental lord]]s.\nThe enraged elemental lords and their minions beset the titan-forged on all sides. Ever wary of fighting a unified elemental army, the keepers resolved to divide and conquer their enemies. Thus they split their own forces and dispatched each group of titan-forged to make war on a specific elemental lord.\nTyr and Odyn volunteered to confront the most destructive elemental lieutenant: [[Ragnaros]] the Firelord. Their battle raged for weeks, engulfing the land in fire and magma. Yet the keepers' resilient metal forms kept them safe from Ragnaros's fiery onslaughts. Through sheer strength and force of will, Tyr and Odyn pushed Ragnaros back into his volcanic lair in the east. In a land of boiling acid seas and skies choked with ash, the two keepers defeated the Firelord.\nMeanwhile, Archaedas and Freya unleashed their powers upon [[Therazane]] the Stonemother. To protect herself and her minions, the elemental ruler retreated into the towering stone spire that she called home. Archaedas used his dominion over the earth to weaken the citadel's foundations and shatter the craggy giants who guarded it. Freya then made colossal roots sprout from the ground to entangle the fortress. They wormed through stone and crystal, buckled the citadel's walls, and brought them down on Therazane's head.\nRa, Thorim, and Hodir waged war with [[Al'Akir]] the Windlord. Using their mastery over the skies and storms, they forced the elemental lord back to his lair among the highest peaks of Azeroth. Lightning set the heavens aflame as Al'Akir struggled to hold off his foes. In the end, the three keepers turned the elemental lord's own power against him, defeating Al'Akir atop his lofty domain.\n[[Neptulon]] the Tidehunter and his minions rushed to aid the other embattled elemental lords, but they were waylaid by Loken and Mimiron. The two keepers used their wits to harry and outmaneuver Neptulon's forces at every turn. Ultimately, Loken unleashed his arcane powers to freeze and shatter the water elementals' forms, while Mimiron crafted enchanted bonds to imprison Neptulon himself.\nAlthough the elemental lords had been defeated, the keepers knew that they could not utterly destroy the beings. The spirits of the elementals were bound to Azeroth itself. If they were killed, their corporal forms would simply manifest again in time.\nRa soon found a solution. He set out to imprison the elementals, much as the great [[Sargeras]] had done to demons. Ra first called on the aid of the gifted titan-forged sorceress [[Helya]]. They worked in concert to craft their interlinked domains within a pocket dimension known as the [[Elemental Plane]]. Ra and Helya then banished the elemental lords and nearly all of their servants to this enchanted prison realm.\nRagnaros and the fire elementals were exiled to a smoldering corner of the Elemental Plane known as the [[Firelands]]. Therazane and the earth elementals were locked within the crystalline caverns of [[Deepholm]]. Al'Akir and the air elementals were imprisoned among the cloudy spires of the [[Skywall]]. Lastly, Neptulon and the water elementals were sucked into the fathomless depths of the [[Abyssal Maw]]. Only a few elementals would remain on the surface of Azeroth. With their leaders gone, these beings scattered and abandoned the war.\nHaving contained the elementals, the keepers turned their attention on the Black Empire's aqiri legions. Many of the insectoids dwelled in vast catacombs that snaked beneath the surface of the devastated world. Archaedas bent the stones and soil to his will, collapsing the aqiri burrows and driving the creatures above ground. Upon emerging from their lairs, the insectoids found themselves surrounded by the titan-forged.\nThe battle between the titan-forged and the aqir proved unexpectedly vicious. In time, the keepers destroyed most of the aqiri race. Small pockets of the insectoids, those that had tunneled deep underground, escaped the keepers' wrath. Yet they were too weakened to mount a counterattack.\nFall of the Black Empire.\nThe victories over the [[aqir]] and the [[elementals]] heartened the keepers, but they knew that their greatest battles were still to come. As one, they turned their righteous gaze on the heart of the Black Empire: the sprawling temple city built around the Old God [[Y'Shaarj]]. By toppling the most powerful n'raqi bastion on Azeroth, the keepers believed they could crush their enemies in one swift stroke. \nThe keepers and their allies waded through one swarm of n'raqi after another as they battled their way toward the mountainous form of Y'Shaarj. The broken and mangled bodies of titan-forged and n'raqi alike riddled the landscape by the time the invaders breached the city and assaulted the Old God itself.\nY'Shaarj was more powerful than the keepers had expected. It poisoned the minds of the titan-forged, drawing out their fears and darkening their thoughts.\nThe Pantheon grew concerned that the Old God would overwhelm their servants. Despite the risk of harming the world, they decided to take direct action.\nReferences.\n[[Category:Titan-forged| ]]\n[[Category:Titans]]\n[[Category:Lore]]\n[[es:Forjados por los titanes]]"}

It is written using runes.\nVanir and Aesir are apparently two dialects of Titan.\nTitan uses the same word for \"created\" as it does for \"Ordered\".\n&lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Korialstrasz&lt;/a&gt; can speak Titan. &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt; can read it. In the past, the &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; could read and write it.\nTitan primer.\nHere are a few common Titan phrases and words, for which the translations have been officially confirmed by Blizzard: \nIn the RPG.\nThe written language is made up of glyphs (hieroglyphs) and is understood only by deduction. Scholars are trying to restore the language by matching the modern Dwarven tongue with rare evidence at excavations of Titan ruins. Linguists tear their hair out trying to parse the inhumanoid grammar and circular references of Titan.\nNotes.\nTitan-speaking player characters.\nBeginning with \"&lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;Wrath of the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;\", a small number of rogue player characters of both factions were granted the ability to speak and understand Titan in the same way as other in-game languages, regardless of faction, and could thus use it to communicate cross-faction.\nThe language was not limited by character level, race or faction, and no links to specific in-game actions were proven. One poster on the official forums claimed that, when asked about it, a GM told him that it was not a bug, but refused to elaborate on the purpose. However, no actual proof was presented of a GM having said this. Several other players have also claimed to have spoken to GMs or Blizzard representatives regarding the ability, some reporting a similar answer.\nA similar mysterious learning of the &lt;a href=\"Draconic\"&gt;Draconic&lt;/a&gt; language by many player characters, in this case limited to gnome rogues, happened around the same time, with some learning both languages.\nWith &lt;a href=\"patch%205.0.4\"&gt;patch 5.0.4&lt;/a&gt; the supposed bug was apparently removed.\nSpeculation.\nDue to being descendants of the titan-forged, a number of Azerothian languages\u2014&lt;a href=\"Common%20%28language%29\"&gt;Common&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20%28language%29\"&gt;Dwarven&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gnomish%20%28language%29\"&gt;Gnomish&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vrykul%20%28language%29\"&gt;Vrykul&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mogu%20%28language%29\"&gt;Mogu&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Tol%27vir%20%28language%29\"&gt;Tol'vir&lt;/a&gt;\u2014might have originated from the Titan language."}

This list is great but hasn't been updated since July 2005.\nLinks to AddOns.\nA list of Titan Panel 4.0 compatible plugins \"will soon be\" available at the &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.titanpanel.org/downloads.html\"&gt;Titan Panel Portal&lt;/a&gt;.\nSuggestions.\nThe Titan Development Team has requested that all suggestions be entered as an issue at the &lt;a href=\"http%3A//code.google.com/p/titanpanel/issues/entry\"&gt;Google Code&lt;/a&gt; website.\nGarbage collection.\nYou can force a garbage collection within Titan Panel by left-clicking on the TitanPerformance button.\nRecent Changes For Developers.\nPending...\nDeveloper's guide.\nIf you want to create your own Titan panel plug-in, you should get the Titan Panel developer's kit for some simple examples.\nThe general anatomy of a Titan panel button is fairly simple. There's the button itself, which is what appears on the Titan panel. These can be text, icons, combination text and icons, or other arbitrarily complex UI frames. Each button has a context menu, a tooltip and often a control window.\nYou define the button in your XML as you might expect:\n &lt;Frame parent=\"UIParent\"&gt;\n &lt;Frames&gt;\n &lt;Button name=\"TitanPanelExampleButton\" inherits=\"TitanPanelTextTemplate\"\n frameStrata=\"FULLSCREEN\" toplevel=\"true\"&gt;\n &lt;Scripts&gt;\n &lt;OnLoad&gt;\n TitanPanelExampleButton_OnLoad();\n TitanPanelButton_OnLoad();\n &lt;/OnLoad&gt;\n &lt;/Scripts&gt;\n &lt;/Button&gt;\n &lt;/Frames&gt;\n &lt;/Frame&gt;\nThe button should have an OnLoad hook to set up the plug-in's details, and should call the original codice_1 function to insert itself into the Panel's list of known plug-ins. The template to inherit from depends on what sort of plug-in you wish to create:\nTwo other templates are available as an aid also, but should not be used as a top level Titan Panel button:\nIn your OnLoad method, before the codice_1 is called, you must set up the button's \"registry\". This is a table defining how the button appears and works within the Panel, and has the following fields:\nMoving on to our example plugin's OnLoad method. You must at least supply the \"id\" and \"menuText\" entries, though usually you will want to supply more:\n function TitanPanelExamplePlugin_OnLoad()\n this.registry = {\n id = \"Example\",\n menuText = \"Example Plug-in\",\n tooltipTitle = \"Example Plug-in\",\n buttonTextFunction = \"TitanPanelExamplePlugin_GetButtonText\",\n end\n function TitanPanelExamplePlugin_GetButtonText()\n return \"Example\";\n end\nNote: If you intend to use the TitanPanelIconTemplate template, you must also make sure to insert a new entry in the codice_12 table, on your OnLoad method, containing the \"id\" of your plugin, eg codice_13.\nWith just this code, you should have a Titan Panel plug-in that simply shows \"Example\".\nIf you want it to respond to left clicks, you need to either hook the codice_14 event to do what you want, or create a frame called codice_15, where (ID) is your plug-in's id (eg, codice_16). This frame will be shown and hidden attached to your button when it is left clicked.\nIf you want your button to respond to right clicks with a contextual menu, ensure that either you don't hook codice_14 or that you call codice_18 after doing your own work, so that the Titan code can catch the right click event. You will also need to define a function named codice_19, calling a combination of the right click menu construction functions:\nYou can build a typical context menu easily:\n function TitanPanelRightClickMenu_PrepareExampleMenu()\n TitanPanelRightClickMenu_AddTitle(TitanPlugins[\"Example\"].menuText);\n TitanPanelRightClickMenu_AddToggleIcon(\"Example\");\n TitanPanelRightClickMenu_AddToggleLabelText(\"Example\");\n TitanPanelRightClickMenu_AddSpacer();\n TitanPanelRightClickMenu_AddCommand(TITAN_PANEL_MENU_HIDE, \"Example\", TITAN_PANEL_MENU_FUNC_HIDE);\n end\nNote that the example plug-in's registry didn't include any variables, so these toggles won't work, and may even generate errors. On top of that, it neither has an icon nor returns a label from its codice_21 method, so the toggles would have no effect even if the variables existed. Example only, cut and paste at your own risk!\nHistorical reference.\nAll items within this section are historical and therefore are no longer relevant to the current Titan Panel effort. This is intended just to show the evolution of the most popular addon for the World of Warcraft to this date. Further, it should show how something that is open source can be adopted by dedicated people who will keep something alive indefinitely."}

These approaches are complementary because Lua can manipulate widgets that were predefined in XML.\nUntil &lt;a href=\"patch%201.10.0\"&gt;patch 1.10.0&lt;/a&gt;, was only possible using this combination of XML and Lua. Functions such as have since enabled Lua to assert a more prominent role, but the XML schema remains an accepted -- and regularly updated -- approach for both custom &lt;a href=\"AddOns\"&gt;AddOns&lt;/a&gt; and Blizzard's own default UI.\nSchema basics.\nWoW defines its own schema in &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.townlong-yak.com/framexml/latest/UI.xsd\"&gt;FrameXML/UI.xsd&lt;/a&gt;. In general, this schema has four kinds of elements:\nA complete XML file might appear like the following:\n&lt;Ui xmlns=\"http://www.blizzard.com/wow/ui/\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://www.blizzard.com/wow/ui/ ..\\FrameXML\\UI.xsd\"&gt;\n &lt;Frame name=\"MyAddonFrame\"&gt; &lt;!-- a sample widget --&gt;\n &lt;!-- sample properties and children --&gt;\n &lt;Scripts&gt; \n &lt;OnLoad script=\"MyAddonFrame_OnLoad\" /&gt;\n &lt;/Scripts&gt;\n &lt;Layers&gt;\n &lt;Layer level=\"ARTWORK\"&gt;\n &lt;Texture name=\"MyAddonFrameTexture\" /&gt;\n &lt;/Layer&gt;\n &lt;/Layers&gt;\n &lt;/Frame&gt; &lt;!-- end of sample widget --&gt;\n&lt;/Ui&gt;\nMalformed XML will generate an error when logging in or reloading the game client. There are also online validators available with &lt;a href=\"https%3A//validator.w3.org/\"&gt;W3 Org&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"http%3A//dev.averageurl.com/wow/xml\"&gt;Average URL&lt;/a&gt; that can perform this task without running the game.\nManaging Widgets.\n is an abstract type defining basic rules for most widgets, but typically addons will create specific kinds such as a . These widgets have many common attributes, described in this section.\nParent.\nWidgets have a if they are contained inside another widget, or if explicitly set using the parent attribute, codice_2. The latter approach is useful to add features to the existing UI, such as adding a button to the WorldMapFrame.\n&lt;Button name=\"WorldMapFrame_MyAddonButton\" parent=\"WorldMapFrame\"&gt;\n&lt;/Button&gt;\nName.\nEvery widget can have a , which creates a global variable for referencing it from Lua during runtime. To prevent collisions, this name should truly be unique across all AddOns.\nThe \"$parent\" keyword incorporates the name from a parent widget, so the button below becomes \"MyAddonFrameButton\".\n&lt;Frame name=\"MyAddonFrame\"&gt;\n &lt;Frames&gt;\n &lt;Button name=\"$parentButton\"&gt;\n &lt;/Button&gt;\n &lt;/Frames&gt;\n&lt;/Frame&gt;\nIn Lua, the button is manipulable using this global name. For example: codice_3.\nLayout.\nLayoutFrames are generally a rectangular on the screen, defined by &lt;a href=\"anchors\"&gt;anchors&lt;/a&gt; and sizes. To be , there must be sufficient non-contradictory information to compute its position and size. In XML, these are specified using codice_4 and codice_5.\nA 100x100 frame anchored to its parent's top-left corner:\n&lt;Frame name=\"MyAddonFrame\"&gt;\n &lt;Size&gt;\n &lt;AbsDimension x=\"100\" y=\"100\" /&gt;\n &lt;/Size&gt;\n &lt;Anchors&gt;\n &lt;Anchor point=\"TOPLEFT\" /&gt;\n &lt;/Anchors&gt;\n&lt;/Frame&gt;\nA frame centered on its parent, covering a quarter of the screen regardless of resolution:\n&lt;Frame name=\"MyAddonFrame\"&gt;\n &lt;Size&gt;\n &lt;RelDimension x=\"0.5\" y=\"0.5\" /&gt;\n &lt;/Size&gt;\n &lt;Anchors&gt;\n &lt;Anchor point=\"CENTER\" /&gt;\n &lt;/Anchors&gt;\n&lt;/Frame&gt;\nSee and for additional details.\nShowing/Hiding.\nLayoutFrames default to a visible state unless one sets the hidden attribute, codice_2. In Lua, toggle this state using .\nLayers and Textures.\nCertain widgets exist only within the codice_7 part of a to render potentially-overlapping text or texture (graphics) inside that Frame. There are five &lt;a href=\"layer\"&gt;layer&lt;/a&gt;s, in order from furthest-back to forward:\n&lt;Frame&gt;\n &lt;Layers&gt;\n &lt;Layer level=\"BACKGROUND\"&gt;\n &lt;Texture /&gt;\n &lt;/Layer&gt;\n &lt;Layer level=\"OVERLAY\"&gt;\n &lt;FontString /&gt;\n &lt;/Layer&gt;\n &lt;/Layers&gt;\n&lt;/Frame&gt;\nTemplates.\nTemplates define a common layout for reuse in many widgets. Widgets inheriting from a template will share the same properties, children, and attributes unless explicitly overwritten.\nTemplates in XML:\nWidgets inheriting the templates:\n &lt;Ui xmlns=\"http://www.blizzard.com/wow/ui/\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://www.blizzard.com/wow/ui/ ..\\FrameXML\\UI.xsd\"&gt;\n &lt;Button name=\"MyAddonButtonTemplate\" virtual=\"true\"&gt;\n &lt;Size&gt;\n &lt;AbsDimension x=\"40\" y=\"22\" /&gt;\n &lt;/Size&gt;\n &lt;ButtonText name=\"$parentText\" /&gt;\n &lt;/Button&gt;\n &lt;Button inherits=\"MyAddonButtonTemplate\" name=\"MyButton1\" /&gt;\n&lt;/Ui&gt;\nScripts.\nTo attach behaviour to the UI elements defined in the XML files, you must use Lua. There are two methods of attaching Lua code to UI elements.\nTo include Lua code via a Script element, you must have one or more &lt;Script&gt; elements at the start of the XML file. For example:\n &lt;Ui ... &gt;\n &lt;Script file=\"mycode.lua\"/&gt;\n &lt;Frame name=\"MyFrame\"&gt;\n &lt;/Frame&gt;\n &lt;/Ui&gt;\nWhen the XML file is read, the contents of the \"mycode.lua\" file is read and interpreted. The code in that file is then available for the rest of this XML file, \"and\" any XML files that are read \"after\" this one. Functions that are defined in \"mycode.lua\" can be called from event handlers in the XML file.\nBasic Event Handling concepts.\n\"If you are not used to event handled programming, read this section, otherwise you can skip right through it.\"\nTraditional programming style involves writing a program that has a start and finish. Execution starts at the beginning, and after following through the algorithm in the program, it eventually gets to the end.\nEvent handled programming is somewhat different. In this case, you create several, independent sections of code, with no clear start or finish. Each of these sections of code are designed to be executed in response to a certain event occurring. Such a section of code is called an \"event handler\". An event handler may get executed once, many times, or maybe even never. This kind of programming style is used whenever you want your code to interact with an external program, and do things in response to whatever that program is doing.\nIn the case of &lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;, the core game is external to the interface code. Whenever something happens in the game, it asks the interface code to respond to it, by calling one of the event handlers.\nHandling UI Events.\nTo handle UI events, you must include event handler elements in your XML code. You do this by having a Scripts element, inside of which you have one or more Onxxxx event handler elements. For example:\n &lt;Frame name=\"MyFrame\"&gt;\n &lt;Scripts&gt;\n &lt;OnShow&gt;\n message(\"Hello!\");\n &lt;/OnShow&gt;\n &lt;/Scripts&gt;\n &lt;/Frame&gt;\nThis frame has one event handler only, which is executed every time this Frame becomes visible. The contents of the OnShow element can be any valid Lua code. In this example, it's a single statement, which calls the function message, which causes a dialog box to pop up with \"Hello\" inside it. (message is a function defined in BasicControls.xml and is available by default.)\nHere is a more complete example of how you include Lua code and then reference it from the event handlers.\nmymod.xml:\n &lt;Ui ... &gt;\n &lt;Script file=\"mymod.lua\"/&gt;\n &lt;Frame name=\"MyModMainFrame\"&gt;\n &lt;Scripts&gt;\n &lt;OnLoad&gt;\n MyMod_ShowMessage();\n &lt;/OnLoad&gt;\n &lt;/Scripts&gt;\n &lt;/Frame&gt;\n &lt;/Ui&gt;\nmymod.lua:\n function MyMod_ShowMessage()\n message(\"Hello World!\");\n end\nWhen MyModMainFrame gets loaded (which happens once, at the start of the game, when all the XML files are read in), the OnLoad handler gets executed.

However, a &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Volund\"&gt;Volund&lt;/a&gt;, searching for the powerful mechanisms and weapons crafted by the keepers, infiltrated the lab and kidnapped the defenseless mechagnome. He forced XR9-47 to reveal information about Mimiron's creations, including &lt;a href=\"Titanstrike\"&gt;Titanstrike&lt;/a&gt; and its location. Eventually, Volund brought his captive along with him to &lt;a href=\"Stormheim\"&gt;Stormheim&lt;/a&gt;.\nMany years later before his death, Volund ordered the enslaved XR9-47 alongside his few remaining vrykul followers to bury him alongside Titanstrike in the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20the%20Old%20Kings\"&gt;Tomb of the Old Kings&lt;/a&gt;. At some point after that, XR9-47 became physically incapacitated and inactive.\nMillennia later, &lt;a href=\"Grif%20Wildheart\"&gt;Grif Wildheart&lt;/a&gt;, helping a &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; in finding Titanstrike, successfully reactivated the mechagnome to the point that XR9-47 was able to reboot his systems. When the vrykul &lt;a href=\"Prustaga\"&gt;Prustaga&lt;/a&gt; revealed her treachery and made off with Titanstrike, Mimiron was able to download XR9-47's memory to his core processing systems at the &lt;a href=\"Spark%20of%20Imagination\"&gt;Spark of Imagination&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt; to figure out the rifle's location.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, he appeared in the &lt;a href=\"Inventor%27s%20Library\"&gt;Inventor's Library&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Peaks\"&gt;Storm Peaks&lt;/a&gt; and as a relay for the &lt;a href=\"Image%20of%20Mimiron\"&gt;Image of Mimiron&lt;/a&gt; during the hunt for &lt;a href=\"Hati\"&gt;Hati&lt;/a&gt;'s essence.

He directly blocks the entrance into the lower level of Ulduar in the &lt;a href=\"Scrapyard\"&gt;Scrapyard&lt;/a&gt;. The fight is a rather straightforward &lt;a href=\"gear%20check\"&gt;gear check&lt;/a&gt;.\nA &lt;a href=\"companion\"&gt;companion&lt;/a&gt; version of this boss, &lt;a href=\"Lil%27%20XT\"&gt;Lil' XT&lt;/a&gt;, is available from the Blizzard &lt;a href=\"Pet%20Store\"&gt;Pet Store&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nBosstiary.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Mimiron\"&gt;Mimiron&lt;/a&gt; engineered this &lt;a href=\"clockwork%20giant\"&gt;clockwork giant&lt;/a&gt;, who dominates the &lt;a href=\"scrapyard\"&gt;scrapyard&lt;/a&gt; area in Ulduar. XT-002 considers himself to be the inventor's son, causing the machine to behave like a young boy.\"\nAdventure Guide.\n\"Engineering to patrol the Ulduar scrapyard, Mimiron invested his clockwork creation with a rudimentary intellect that suited his duties. XT-002 has come to look upon himself as the &lt;a href=\"keeper\"&gt;keeper&lt;/a&gt;'s son, and often throws tantrums like a petulant child.\"\nOverview.\nUpon reaching 75%, 50%, and 25% health the Heart of the Deconstructor will become exposed and bots will begin to join the fight.\nAbilities.\nStage Two: Heart of the Deconstructor.\nThe Heart of the Deconstructor becomes exposed.\nHard Mode.\nDestroying the Heart of the Deconstructor during State Two will activate Hard Mode, healing XT-002 Deconstructor to full and empowering him with additional abilities.\nStrategy.\nPreparation.\nAs with all Wrath of the Lich King raids, a standard raid composition is OK. No special resistances or equipment are needed. In Normal 10-man mode, damage dealers should average about 3,000 DPS (3,500 DPS if using only 5 damage dealers). Normal 25-man requires the entire raid to output approximately 60,000 DPS. Heroic 25-man mode requires damage dealers to provide 5,000 DPS each.\nPhase 1 consists of a fairly standard tank-and-spank. The fight enters phase 2 when the boss is at 75%, when it takes a 20-second \"nap,\" during which it exposes its heart and summons adds. After that, Phase 1 continues until at 50% (and 25% again) a Phase 2 takes place.\nGravity Bomb and Light Bomb.\nEach raid member must learn to deal with these two debuffs. Since they both are a threat to other raid members, debuffed players must separate from the raid as fast as possible. Melee can set up in a circle around the Deconstructor, since it has no cleave or short-range AoE. Healers and ranged DPS should stay 10 yards away from tanks and melee, and then agree on one of the following set-up possibilities:\nIt's also possible to set up in a wide circle around the tank spot, with as much space between players as possible (preferably around 10 yards).\nThe Deconstructor keeps the two Bomb debuffs up at all times (that is as soon as one of them expires on a player, another player gets it), except during Tantrum, when the Bomb debuffs are not refreshed. The two players with Bomb debuffs must run away from all other players, either to explode in safety (Gravity Bomb), or in order not to damge others (Light Bomb). Gravity Bomb does not kill, so if that player starts at full health, no healing is required. Light Bomb can kill, for that reason one healer should be assigned to put a HoT or two on the current Light Bomb victim.\nEven with fast player reaction, Light Bomb inevitably deals some AoE damage to the raid. The raid healer(s) need to be quick to AoE heal this.\nTympanic Tantrum.\nOnce per minute, the boss casts Tympanic Tantrum. The one-minute cooldown is reset by exposing the heart (getting below 75%, 50% or 25% respectively), so high-DPS groups can completely avoid Tantrum. If the boss casts Tantrum, every raid member takes 80% damage within 8 seconds, and is slowed by about 40%. This means that AoE healing must be well organized so that nobody dies from this damage, and that the raid should be on top health prior to Tantrum. The standard avoidance methods do work, but reduce DPS (which may prove fatal). Hunter &lt;a href=\"Deterrence\"&gt;Deterrence&lt;/a&gt; is ineffective but Rogue &lt;a href=\"Feint\"&gt;Feint&lt;/a&gt; does reduce Tantrum damage. The damage can also be mitigated by a paladin's &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Sacrifice\"&gt;Divine Sacrifice&lt;/a&gt; coupled with &lt;a href=\"Hand%20of%20Protection\"&gt;Hand of Protection&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Shield\"&gt;Divine Shield&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a Discipline-specced priest's (with a shorter cooldown from &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Warding\"&gt;Soul Warding&lt;/a&gt;, and 3% raid-wide damage mitigation from &lt;a href=\"Renewed%20Hope%20%28priest%20talent%29\"&gt;Renewed Hope (priest talent)&lt;/a&gt;).\nPhase 2: Exposed Heart and Adds.\nWhenever the boss gets below a 25% threshold (at 75%, 50% and 25%), it switches for 20 seconds to Phase 2. During this time, the boss itself cannot be targeted, but it exposes its heart and takes double damage, and adds are summoned. Three types of adds spawn from the scrap heaps in the four corners of the room:\nThe Scrapbots need to be AoE'd down and must not reach the boss. They are susceptible to most snares (stun, frost nova, knockback, etc.). The Boombots should be single targeted and nuked by ranged. It is best if they explode when surrounded by scrapbots or near the Heart. The Pummelers should simply be off-tanked and kited during the whole fight around the room. No damage dealer should ever target a Pummeler.\nScrapbots spawn in ~7-10 groups of 5. The groups can appear simultaneously and at varying times. Have people keep an eye out and call out where and when they are coming. When scrapbots get closer to the raid group, they need to be AOE'd down immediately (a Priest using Mind Sear can help reduce the number of DPS wasted on scrapbots). Boombots need to be DPS'ed when they are near the Heart or scrapbots (or when not close to players). &lt;a href=\"Personal%20Electromagnetic%20Pulse%20Generator\"&gt;Personal Electromagnetic Pulse Generator&lt;/a&gt; from Engineers can be extremely helpful to stop the closest Scrapbots, stunning all mechanicals within roughly 20 yards for 3 seconds.\nWhen the heart goes back up into the boss and XT becomes targettable again, the remaining active adds stay alive.\nThe Heart has 7M hitpoints in Heroic mode (1.5 M in normal mode). Since the heart takes double damage, and all damage it takes is passed through to the boss, every damage dealer should try to concentrate on the Heart as much as possible. Melee should stay on the heart exclusively during the whole phase. Even healers can deal some damage in this phase, Mana permitting (else healers can use this phase to regenerate a little). While it's desirable to deal as much damage to the heart as possible, destroying it invokes hard mode, pay attention that this doesn't happen by accident.\nBloodlust should be used during a heart phase and extra attention should be paid not to trigger the hard mode if this is undesirable.\nDealing with a low DPS raid.\nIf the raid's damage output is on the low side, the key is to maximize the damage done to the heart in phase 2. The idea is to divert two players to slow the adds down, while all other damage dealers concentrate on the heart. Position the boss close to two scrap heaps (and far away from the two others). The adds from the two far away heaps cannot reach the boss before the heart is retracted, thus two players (e.g. mages) are sufficient to slow down the adds from the two close heaps. As soon as the heart retracts, all ranged DPS nuke the adds.\nThe luck aspect of this fight is having XT-002 cast Tympanic Tantrum just before going into Enrage. This yields an extra 5\u201310 seconds DPS time, before he obliterates the raid. At this point, all healers (besides the one healing the Pummeler Tank) should give as much DPS as possible.\nLoot.\n\"For additional hard mode loot, see &lt;a href=\"Cache%20of%20Toys\"&gt;Cache of Toys&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nRelated achievements.\nThe following achievements are for the encounter's hard mode.\nQuotes.\nSound Files.\nSee \"&lt;a href=\"PlaySoundFile%20macros%20-%20Ulduar%23.C2.A0XT-002%20Deconstructor\"&gt;Sound Files of Ulduar: XT-002 Deconstructor&lt;/a&gt;\"\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

Legends state that it can even grant its wielder visions of the Black Empire, though doing so inevitably drives the viewer mad.\nXal'atath passed through many hands over the millennia, sowing chaos as it went. It was used by the &lt;a href=\"jungle%20troll\"&gt;jungle troll&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Zan%27do\"&gt;Zan'do&lt;/a&gt; to resurrect the &lt;a href=\"C%27Thrax\"&gt;C'Thrax&lt;/a&gt; general, &lt;a href=\"Kith%27ix\"&gt;Kith'ix&lt;/a&gt;; by &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer-Thane%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Sorcerer-Thane Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt;'s wife, &lt;a href=\"Modgud\"&gt;Modgud&lt;/a&gt;, to curse &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;; and by the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;ess &lt;a href=\"Natalie%20Seline\"&gt;Natalie Seline&lt;/a&gt; to study the dark secrets of the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually it found its way into the hands of the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;, who attempted to use it to reanimate Kith'ix's fellow general &lt;a href=\"Zakajz%20the%20Corruptor\"&gt;Zakajz the Corruptor&lt;/a&gt;. They were stopped by the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;High Priest&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Netherlight%20Temple\"&gt;Netherlight Temple&lt;/a&gt;, who claimed the blade for themselves. The High Priest wielded Xal'atath against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; for a time, ultimately draining much of its power to purge the &lt;a href=\"sword%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;sword of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; of its corrupting power in &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;.\nXal'atath was either lost or abandoned by the High Priest, and fell into the hands of the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;. When they began attacking &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;, they brought the blade with them; &lt;a href=\"Collector%20Kojo\"&gt;Collector Kojo&lt;/a&gt; came across it by accident near a makeshift altar in &lt;a href=\"Stormsong%20Valley\"&gt;Stormsong Valley&lt;/a&gt;, and adventurers sought to use it to gain insight into the naga's plans. Xal'atath explained that the naga sought to conjure a storm powerful enough to scour all &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; using three relics: the &lt;a href=\"Void%20Stone%20%28quest%20item%29\"&gt;Void Stone&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Trident%20of%20Deep%20Ocean%20%28quest%20item%29\"&gt;Trident of Deep Ocean&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"%3ATempest%20Caller\"&gt;:Tempest Caller&lt;/a&gt;. Xal'atath guided the adventurer to &lt;a href=\"Drustvar\"&gt;Drustvar&lt;/a&gt;, where they found the &lt;a href=\"high%20elf\"&gt;high elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Inanis\"&gt;Inanis&lt;/a&gt; attempting to wield the Void Stone's power. After killing her, Xal'atath drew upon the Void Stone's power and possessed Inanis's corpse. Now in a mortal form, she helped the adventurer find the other two relics and brought them to the &lt;a href=\"Crucible%20of%20Storms\"&gt;Crucible of Storms&lt;/a&gt; beneath the &lt;a href=\"Precipice%20of%20Oblivion\"&gt;Precipice of Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;.\nRather than stopping the naga, however, Xal'atath offered the relics and the adventurer to &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt; in exchange for her freedom. N'Zoth severed her from the &lt;a href=\"Xal%27atath%2C%20Blade%20of%20the%20Black%20Empire\"&gt;dagger&lt;/a&gt;, keeping it for himself in the bargain; Xal'atath departed through a portal, confident she would see the adventurer once more.\nQuotes.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nGossip.\nLet us hurry.

Eventually, it found its way into the hands of a &lt;a href=\"Jungle%20troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Zan%27do\"&gt;Zan'do&lt;/a&gt;, an ambitious &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20tribe\"&gt;Gurubashi&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"witch%20doctor\"&gt;witch doctor&lt;/a&gt; ousted from his prestigious position by his rivals. Xal'atath easily twisted his mind, preying upon his anger and turning his thoughts of revenge into an obsession. Xal'atath guided Zan'do and his followers to a mound of black stone at the foot of the &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt; mountains. Though the Zandalari mystics had forbidden all trolls from approaching it, Zan'do believed it held the power to defeat his rivals--a belief that was only magnified when he learned that it was the remains of a &lt;a href=\"C%27Thrax\"&gt;powerful creature&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Kith%27ix\"&gt;Kith'ix&lt;/a&gt;. Xal'atath encouraged Zan'do to make blood offerings to Kith'ix, and the witch doctor butchered his companions in a profane ritual. At its conclusion, Zan'do plunged Xal'atath into Kith'ix's hide. The beast awakened and rose once more, and Zan'do and his followers were never seen again.\nKith'ix awakened the slumbering &lt;a href=\"aqir\"&gt;aqir&lt;/a&gt; and sent them to scour the surface of Azeroth, unleashing the full extent of Xal'atath's dark powers against the trolls. Though they would eventually defeat him and his insectoid armies, they never forgot the might of Xal'atath. Many tribes still whisper stories about the black blade that nearly brought them to extinction.\nAt some point after the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, and for a certain period of time, Xal'atath was in possession of the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;.\nThousands of years later, Xal'atath was brought to &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer-Thane%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Sorcerer-Thane Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt;'s wife, &lt;a href=\"Modgud\"&gt;Modgud&lt;/a&gt;, by one of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt; she employed to search for magical artifacts. An accomplished sorceress in her own right, Modgud was immediately enraptured by the blade and spent several days in her chambers trying to discern its secrets. When she emerged, she sought out the dwarf who had brought it to her to thank him... but no one could find him, or even remember his name or face. Modgud wielded Xal'atath throughout the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;War of the Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt;, using it against the &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammer dwarves&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt; and summoning shadowy apparitions from the dark corners of the fortress. Eventually, &lt;a href=\"Khardros%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Khardros Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt; fought his way through the Dark Iron army and confronted Modgud herself. She reached for Xal'atath to defend herself but found the blade inexplicably absent. Khardros struck her down with a single mighty blow from his hammer; as she lay dying, she repeated one phrase over and over: \"You promised...\"\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;ess named &lt;a href=\"Natalie%20Seline\"&gt;Natalie Seline&lt;/a&gt; dedicated herself to studying the foul magics wielded by the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s, knowing that knowledge of this power was key to fighting it. She heard stories of a dark blade that held sway over the shadows themselves. Troubled that such a blade could exist, she sought it out. As soon as she touched the dagger, Xal'atath spoke to her and she immediately understood that it could not be destroyed. From it, she learned of the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; and its interactions with the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;. By the time of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; she had not only learned how to wield shadow magic but taught it to her followers, using its power in secret to wage war against the orcs. Xal'atath's maddening whispers took their toll on her sanity, though, twisting her noble intentions into zealous fanaticism. She and her followers embraced shadow magic wholeheartedly, many even forsaking the Light entirely. Though Seline urged caution, her pleas fell on deaf ears. In time her followers decided that she was keeping the true secrets of shadow magic from them, murdering her in her sleep and taking Xal'atath.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; invaded Azeroth from the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;, the dwarven queen &lt;a href=\"Moira%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Moira Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt; worked with the undead bishop &lt;a href=\"Alonsus%20Faol\"&gt;Alonsus Faol&lt;/a&gt; to search for weapons to fight them. Through double agents within the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;, they learned the cult was using Xal'atath in some sort of unholy ritual in &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt;. They sent a &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt; to investigate, discovering that the Twilight's Hammer had broken into the &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Fall\"&gt;tomb of Tyr&lt;/a&gt;. Within, &lt;a href=\"Bishop%20Farthing\"&gt;Twilight Deacon Farthing&lt;/a&gt; was using the blade to attempt to reanimate &lt;a href=\"Zakajz%20the%20Corruptor\"&gt;Zakajz the Corruptor&lt;/a&gt;, a C'Thrax who had once served &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt; alongside Kith'ix. Farthing turned Xal'atath's power against the priest, but when he began to lose the battle the blade abandoned him. Calling him weak, it devoured his soul and told the priest to take hold of it. As the priest clutched the black blade, it whispered that the only way to ensure Zakajz would never rise again was to use Xal'atath to devour its essence. The priest agreed, and as Xal'atath grew in power they departed for the Broken Isles to do battle together against the Legion. This priest ended up as the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;High Priest&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Netherlight%20Temple\"&gt;Netherlight Temple&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe High Priest wielded Xal'atath against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; for a time, ultimately draining much of its power to purge the &lt;a href=\"sword%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;sword of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; of its corrupting power in &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;. They either lost or abandoned it thereafter, however, and it had fallen into the hands of the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; by the time they attacked &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Collector%20Kojo\"&gt;Collector Kojo&lt;/a&gt; came across the blade by accident near a makeshift altar in &lt;a href=\"Stormsong%20Valley\"&gt;Stormsong Valley&lt;/a&gt;, and the adventurer sought to use it to gain insight into the naga's plans. &lt;a href=\"Xal%27atath\"&gt;Xal'atath&lt;/a&gt; explained that the naga sought to conjure a storm powerful enough to scour all &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; using three relics: the &lt;a href=\"Void%20Stone%20%28quest%20item%29\"&gt;Void Stone&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Trident%20of%20Deep%20Ocean%20%28quest%20item%29\"&gt;Trident of Deep Ocean&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"%3ATempest%20Caller\"&gt;:Tempest Caller&lt;/a&gt;. Xal'atath guided the adventurer to &lt;a href=\"Drustvar\"&gt;Drustvar&lt;/a&gt; where they found the &lt;a href=\"high%20elf\"&gt;high elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Inanis\"&gt;Inanis&lt;/a&gt; attempting to wield the Void Stone's power. After killing her, Xal'atath drew upon the Void Stone's power and possessed Inanis's corpse. Now in a mortal form, she helped the adventurer find the other two relics and brought them to the &lt;a href=\"Crucible%20of%20Storms\"&gt;Crucible of Storms&lt;/a&gt; beneath the &lt;a href=\"Precipice%20of%20Oblivion\"&gt;Precipice of Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;.\nRather than stopping the naga, however, Xal'atath offered the relics and the adventurer to &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt; in exchange for her freedom. N'Zoth severed her from the dagger, keeping it for himself in the bargain; Xal'atath departed through a portal, confident she would see the adventurer once more. Soon after, a &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; adventurer brought the severed dagger to &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller\"&gt;Nathanos Blightcaller&lt;/a&gt; later held it as the seas over &lt;a href=\"Nazjatar\"&gt;Nazjatar&lt;/a&gt; parted beneath his vessel. After landing in Nazjatar, Nathanos, with the blade in hand, ventured away from the rest of the Horde forces in order to complete his secret mission. He delivered it into the hands of &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt;, who later claimed that she had intended to use it against N'Zoth. However, her plans were interrupted by the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, and she was taken to &lt;a href=\"Ny%27alotha\"&gt;Ny'alotha&lt;/a&gt; to be tortured by &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Inquisitor%20Xanesh\"&gt;Dark Inquisitor Xanesh&lt;/a&gt;. She was eventually freed by &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt; and Azeroth's champions, and subsequently gave them the dagger so that they could use it against N'Zoth themselves. Wrathion stabbed the dagger into Old God's &lt;a href=\"Carapace%20of%20N%27Zoth\"&gt;carapace&lt;/a&gt;, tearing it open in a massive blast of energy.

She is one of the more martial of Bastion's Paragons, and is unafraid to pursue enemies of the kyrian even beyond her own realm. Xandria oversaw the duties of the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Courage\"&gt;Temple of Courage&lt;/a&gt; in western Bastion before its sacking by the &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxus\"&gt;Maldraxxi&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Constructs\"&gt;House of Constructs&lt;/a&gt;. She is assisted in her duties by her Hands of Courage, &lt;a href=\"Artemede\"&gt;Artemede&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Apolon\"&gt;Apolon&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nAs one of &lt;a href=\"Bastion\"&gt;Bastion&lt;/a&gt;'s five Paragons, Xandria serves as a leader and example to all &lt;a href=\"kyrian\"&gt;kyrian&lt;/a&gt;, particularly in the area of conflict and battle. Her predecessor, &lt;a href=\"Agthia\"&gt;Agthia&lt;/a&gt;, was instrumental in driving back an invasion of Bastion by the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; at the cost of her own life, and Xandria takes her duty similarly seriously.\nAs the &lt;a href=\"The%20Jailer\"&gt;Jailer&lt;/a&gt; grew in power and an &lt;a href=\"anima\"&gt;anima&lt;/a&gt; drought afflicted the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Constructs\"&gt;House of Constructs&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxus\"&gt;Maldraxxus&lt;/a&gt; launched a raid into Bastion, striking first at Xandria's &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Courage\"&gt;Temple of Courage&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Necrolord\"&gt;Necrolord&lt;/a&gt;s' &lt;a href=\"necropolis\"&gt;necropolis&lt;/a&gt; destroyed much of the temple, but the Paragon of Courage continued to resist the attack from the heart of the temple, contending with &lt;a href=\"Amarth\"&gt;Amarth&lt;/a&gt; the Harvester and his forces personally. Xandria's Hand of Courage, &lt;a href=\"Thanikos\"&gt;Thanikos&lt;/a&gt;, eventually led a counterattack against the Maldraxxi that broke through to the temple itself. However, as he rushed to his Paragon's aid, Thanikos was seized by the dark magic of Amarth and turned into a monstrous &lt;a href=\"bone%20wraith\"&gt;bone wraith&lt;/a&gt;, which Xandria and her allies were forced to slay. Consumed with rage, the Paragon pursued Amarth deeper into the temple itself. It was only when her &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;mortal allies&lt;/a&gt; caught up to her that they were able to kill the necromancer and stop the invasion in its tracks.\nLater, Xandria made contact with &lt;a href=\"Alexandros%20Mograine\"&gt;Alexandros Mograine&lt;/a&gt; of the Maldraxxi &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20the%20Chosen\"&gt;House of the Chosen&lt;/a&gt;, and were together able to repel yet another assault on the weakened Temple of Courage. In the wake of this success, the two planned an attack on the House of the Chosen itself in Maldraxxus, with the intent of ending &lt;a href=\"Margrave%20Gharmal\"&gt;Margrave Gharmal&lt;/a&gt;. After meeting with Baroness &lt;a href=\"Draka\"&gt;Draka&lt;/a&gt;, the Paragon led the kyrian assault on one wing of Gharmal's defenses. Soon, however, Xandria moved to the other wing to reinforce her Maldraxxi allies, before Margrave Gharmal themself took to the field. Along with her mortal &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;allies&lt;/a&gt;, the Paragon engaged Gharmal long enough for the Chosen necropolis &lt;a href=\"Zerekriss\"&gt;Zerekriss&lt;/a&gt; to ready its weapons and fire; the Margrave was killed outright by the blast. Victorious, Xandria removed Gharmal's heart for transport back to &lt;a href=\"Elysian%20Hold\"&gt;Elysian Hold&lt;/a&gt; to be used as part of a rebuilt &lt;a href=\"Crest%20of%20Ascension\"&gt;Crest of Ascension&lt;/a&gt;. Though she did not believe this was consistent with the traditional kyrian way, she accepted that times were changing."}

Since Azshara concealed her magical prowess, Xavius was considered the most powerful Highborne to whom the rest measured their skills. He was later transformed into the first &lt;a href=\"satyr\"&gt;satyr&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, before ultimately being transformed into the dreaded &lt;a href=\"%23The%20Nightmare%20Lord\"&gt;Nightmare Lord&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe makes his first appearance in \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" as an antagonist in \"\", where he once again helps the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;\u2014while remaining first and foremost a loyal servant of the Old Gods. Xavius serves as the main antagonist of the &lt;a href=\"Val%27sharah%20storyline\"&gt;Val'sharah storyline&lt;/a&gt;, corrupting the &lt;a href=\"Shaladrassil\"&gt;Shaladrassil&lt;/a&gt; and battling his old nemesis, Malfurion, and his allies. He also serves as the &lt;a href=\"Xavius%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;final boss&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare raid&lt;/a&gt;, where Nightmare Lord ultimately meets his end for the time being.\nBiography.\nSome time before the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, Xavius had his natural eyes replaced with artificial orbs, magical eyes of ebony lenses with streaks of ruby.\nHigh councilor to Queen Azshara.\nXavius may be the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; most responsible for the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s interest in &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. It was Xavius who first became convinced that &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, ruler of the Burning Legion, was a god sent to deliver Azeroth. Xavius, being the High Councilor of the night elves, also convinced the night elven queen &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt; of the necessity of turning the will of her mages, the so-called \"&lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt;\", towards creating a portal into the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; through which Sargeras and the Legion could enter into the world. Xavius was successful enough in his endeavors to welcome several ranking members of the Legion into Azeroth, including several &lt;a href=\"felguard\"&gt;felguard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20the%20Houndmaster\"&gt;Hakkar the Houndmaster&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt;. As suggested by &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt;, Xavius executed a plot to block any non-Highborne magic user from accessing the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;. This allowed the Highborne to channel the extra energy gained into making the portal to the Twisting Nether strong enough for Sargeras to cross through. Xavius' plot was defeated by the intervention of the young druid &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, who after entering the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;, destroyed the spell array holding the block and the portal; in the battle that ensued Malfurion destroyed Xavius completely and caused his tower to explode as well.\nReborn as a satyr.\nXavius' master, Sargeras, was unhappy with Xavius, and he faced punishment for his failures. Sargeras tortured Xavius' disembodied spirit for a time, but eventually he showed a form of mercy. He decided that Xavius could be of further use after all. He returned Xavius to life, but not as he once was. To mark the traits Sargeras valued in him, and to brand him forever as an ally and servant of the Legion, Sargeras transformed and disfigured Xavius' body.\nAs the first of these beings ever to inhabit Azeroth, Xavius is considered the progenitor of the entire &lt;a href=\"satyr\"&gt;satyr&lt;/a&gt; race. As such, variations of his name are found frequently in satyr settlements (i.e. &lt;a href=\"Xavian\"&gt;Xavian&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;). As a satyr, Xavius retained some resemblance to his former self along with the typical characteristics of all satyrs. Xavius was unique, however, in that he retained the black and ruby eyes he had possessed as a night elf.\nXavius had a two-pronged mission when he returned. First, he was to begin converting as many Highborne as possible into satyrs (the first was a personal friend of Xavius, a dedicated Highborne named &lt;a href=\"Peroth%27arn\"&gt;Peroth'arn&lt;/a&gt;), a task he accomplished with zeal by promising the unfortunate elves power and a place at the right hand of Sargeras. The second objective Xavius was to complete upon his return was to bring back to Sargeras the one who had destroyed the portal, Malfurion Stormrage. This proved to be far more difficult than he had expected, and in a confrontation during one of the most intense battles of the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, Malfurion, with help from a young night elf named &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt;, was able to completely defeat Xavius. Using an arrow shot by Shandris, Malfurion was able to kill Xavius by growing a tree which absorbed his energy and body, and which was subsequently sent to the bottom of the sea in the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;. This was the second time Xavius died at the hands of Malfurion. The victory came at a great cost, however, as during this confrontation Malfurion's love &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; (High Priestess of &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;) was captured by Xavius' remaining satyrs. In a furious rage, Malfurion almost drowned the entire night elven army in a storm caused by his own sadness over the loss of Tyrande. Luckily, &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Krasus&lt;/a&gt; intervened and stopped Malfurion.\nThe Nightmare Lord.\nThe tree containing the remains of Xavius' soul survived the Sundering through unrevealed means. Given his later state and presumed allegiance to the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt;, it is likely they intervened, much the same way they did for &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt;. Many years later, the tree was located on the coast of &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt; near the &lt;a href=\"Coral%20Sea\"&gt;Coral Sea&lt;/a&gt;, though Xavius had been transformed into a tree near &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt; and should have been consumed by the sea in the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;. The tree may have survived from being on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;, a region around Suramar which was not destroyed by the Sundering, though it is not known how he reached Azshara.\nTen thousand years after his transformation, Xavius orchestrated the corruption of the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;, turning parts of it into the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;, and becoming the Nightmare Lord. This was instigated by the Old God &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;. Xavius started by manipulating &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt;, his puppet, into planting a branch of Xavius' own tree into the fledgling &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;, ensuring that the new world tree would be corrupted from the start. By grafting Xavius' fel-tainted branch into Teldrassil, Xavius and the evil behind his transformation into the Nightmare Lord were given a tie to both &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; Xavius acquired the power to be present both as a physical tree in Azeroth, as well as a corrupted tree in the Emerald Dream. The Nightmare Lord, as seen in the Emerald Dream, is described as being a massive, gnarled tree, greatly obscured by the dark fog of the Nightmare.\nWhile Malfurion was investigating reports of disturbing sights in the Emerald Dream, Xavius was able to capture his dream-form. In such state, Malfurion was unable to wake, and nobody from the waking world knew what had happened to him. With the help of Fandral Staghelm, who was keeping Malfurion's body weak, Xavius kept Malfurion as his prisoner for several years. He delighted in torturing Malfurion in various ways, both psychologically (such as showing him &lt;a href=\"Tyrande\"&gt;Tyrande&lt;/a&gt;, as the lover of &lt;a href=\"Illidan\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt;, being turned into a demon) and physically (by slowly turning him into a tree).\nXavius continued expanding the corruption of the Nightmare inside the Emerald Dream, capturing and corrupting more and more creatures. His plans culminated in a daring attempt to bind Azeroth and the Emerald Dream into one plane, seizing control of Azeroth's residents while they slept and giving shape to their nightmares. &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; sensed, however, that while Xavius was strong, he was merely the servant of something even more powerful. Xavius nearly succeeded, but ultimately was killed by Malfurion who was assisted by &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Broll%20Bearmantle\"&gt;Broll Bearmantle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thura\"&gt;Thura&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lucan%20Foxblood\"&gt;Lucan Foxblood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eranikus\"&gt;Eranikus&lt;/a&gt; and a host of others. With Xavius' defeat, what was left of the Nightmare receded into the &lt;a href=\"Rift%20of%20Aln\"&gt;Rift of Aln&lt;/a&gt;, where Xavius' master fought to keep its grip. Xavius' spirit was also sealed inside the Rift of Aln.\nCataclysm.\nAlthough Malfurion had removed the piece of Xavius that had infected Teldrassil, life on the world tree remained corrupt. Inhabitants of Teldrassil such as &lt;a href=\"grell\"&gt;grell&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt;s were tainted by &lt;a href=\"Fel%20Moss\"&gt;Fel Moss&lt;/a&gt; that had been spread by the &lt;a href=\"Bough%20of%20Corruption\"&gt;Bough of Corruption&lt;/a&gt;, the last remnant of Xavius on Teldrassil. The Bough of Corruption was defeated by &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s who were empowered by blessed waters from &lt;a href=\"moonwell\"&gt;moonwell&lt;/a&gt;s.\nLegion.\n\"Xavius once terrorized &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; with an affliction that almost obliterated the walls between reality and dream. His machinations ended in defeat, but he has been given another chance at vengeance. Now, Xavius leads the conquest of Val'sharah, where the tainted &lt;a href=\"World%20Tree\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Shaladrassil\"&gt;Shaladrassil&lt;/a&gt; spreads the Emerald Nightmare's corruption. With an army of vile satyrs at his command, Xavius will stop at nothing to vanquish all who oppose the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nDespite using the Emerald Nightmare to aid the Burning Legion, Xavius' true loyalties remain with the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s. On Azeroth, Xavius manifests as a satyr, but within the Nightmare he can take on any shape he wishes.\nXavius makes his first appearance within the Emerald Dream's counterpart of &lt;a href=\"Ursoc%27s%20Den\"&gt;Ursoc's Den&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Grizzly%20Hills\"&gt;Grizzly Hills&lt;/a&gt;. The Nightmare has overtaken much of the region, and Xavius' satyr armies are attacking the &lt;a href=\"bear\"&gt;bear&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20guardian\"&gt;Ancient&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ursoc\"&gt;Ursoc&lt;/a&gt;, allegedly to obtain his &lt;a href=\"Claws%20of%20Ursoc\"&gt;Claws of Ursoc&lt;/a&gt;. The attack, however, was a trap. While Ursoc boasts that Xavius cannot stand up to the powers of a god, Xavius replies that he has been shaped by the powers of the Old Gods and succeeds in capturing Ursoc. As Xavius leaves to attend to his new prisoner, he tasks &lt;a href=\"Arch-Desecrator%20Malithar\"&gt;Arch-Desecrator Malithar&lt;/a&gt; with exterminating the druids who had come to Ursoc's aid.\nXavius' return is revealed to the Cenarion Circle at large in Val'sharah, when he corrupts &lt;a href=\"Thaon%20Moonclaw\"&gt;Thaon Moonclaw&lt;/a&gt; and leaves adventurers with no choice but to slay the archdruid. He attacks the region's temple to &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt; and steals the &lt;a href=\"Tears%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Tears of Elune&lt;/a&gt; before Malfurion can use them to save &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt; from an affliction caused by the Nightmare. Without the Tears Cenarius succumbs to corruption, and Malfurion pursues Xavius in his rage at the loss of his shan'do. Unfortunately, Xavius is not done taking from Malfurion: when &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt; and an adventurer locate Xavius, he uses the corrupted Tears of Elune to corrupt the former Aspect herself, turning her into a dragon of Nightmare. Xavius and Ysera retreat with Malfurion held captive, followed by the adventurer and &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;.\nA reunion with Tyrande is something Xavius has longed for many years. With Malfurion held captive, Xavius lures Tyrande beneath the boughs of &lt;a href=\"Shaladrassil\"&gt;Shaladrassil&lt;/a&gt; and taunts her into chasing after illusions of her husband before giving the High Priestess an ultimatum: she can pursue Xavius and spend her husband's last moments at his side, or she can return to the Temple of Elune and protect it from Ysera. Mournful and distraught, Tyrande chooses her goddess over her love, though the decision hurts her. At the temple, Ysera is put to rest, and with her last breath she states that the nightmare felt so real. After the Dreamer's death, Tyrande tasks adventurers with following Xavius and Malfurion. At the &lt;a href=\"Darkheart%20Thicket\"&gt;Darkheart Thicket&lt;/a&gt; Malfurion is freed and Xavius' shade on Azeroth defeated, but his true form still lurks within the Nightmare.\nWithin the &lt;a href=\"Rift%20of%20Aln\"&gt;Rift of Aln&lt;/a&gt;, adventurers face Xavius as the final boss of the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare raid&lt;/a&gt;. A bloated, grotesque monstrosity, Xavius wields the might of the Nightmare and commands armies of elemental corruption and n'raqi against his foes, but is ultimately brought down. Upon his death, he turns back into a &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; and the Nightmare vanishes.\nIt is uncertain if he is dead or not, but the results of the battle at Emerald Nightmare caused Xavius to become \"deader\" than his last death.\nIn the RPG.\n\"The beast-like creature carries himself with an elven grace, but hoofed goat's legs and a long, serpentine tail hunch him forward. Red eyes peer out from the face of a handsome night elf noble, as his long, clawed fingers gather the ragged remains of a sorcerer's silk robes around his shoulders. Though he is a monstrous creature, he is also strangely alluring, moving with a grace that seems almost supernatural\u2026\"\nAs a night elf, Xavius was renowned for two things in particular: his skill at subtle political maneuverings and his lack of eyes \u2014 he replaced his eyes with magic black crystals that bore streaks of crimson.\nIt is unlikely for an &lt;a href=\"eternal\"&gt;eternal&lt;/a&gt; to be completely destroyed, they may regenerate or continue on in a non-corporeal form. After the sundering of the world, the eternal satyr Lord Xavius sought to build his dark army without attracting &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;'s attention. &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;Night elves&lt;/a&gt; still fear that he may yet be waiting to take his final revenge upon the &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei\"&gt;Kaldorei&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"satyr\"&gt;satyr&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;'s perverted forests worship Lord Xavius. He sows discord and mistrust, and his satyr children take their trickster natures from his guidance. It is uncertain whether the satyrs still found in &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale%20Forest\"&gt;Ashenvale Forest&lt;/a&gt; and elsewhere are still directly following the will of the Satyr Lord, or merely following his path. &lt;a href=\"Satyr%20trickster\"&gt;Satyr trickster&lt;/a&gt;s, in particular, revere and mimic Lord Xavius' manipulations of his enemies. Most satyr know he fell during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, but continue to honor Xavius as their creator. There still remain those of nearly every race hungry for power at any cost who worship Xavius quietly but fervently, hoping that one day he will step out of the shadows to make them one of his minions.\nAs Xavius had not at any point been specified as more than a normal Kaldorei, who had merely replaced his eyes with artificial ones, there may be other explanations. Judging from his later transformation into the Nightmare Lord, it could very well be that his soul or spirit was taken by the Old Gods, and they conserved him. Or, they might have come upon him later on, as he may not even have been destroyed, but some part of his soul still living on in the tree Malfurion created.\nDirk of the Beast.\nThis blade is a large, golden dagger magically crafted by &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; and granted to Lord Xavius to help him spread the curse of the &lt;a href=\"satyr\"&gt;satyr&lt;/a&gt;. A critical hit from the Dirk of the Beast can transform others into satyr, regardless of race.\nIn Hearthstone.\nXavius appears as in \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\", introduced in the \"\" expansion as a replacement for &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; after the latter was \"promoted\" from a to the for the &lt;a href=\"demon%20hunter\"&gt;demon hunter&lt;/a&gt; class. Xavius summons a whenever his owner plays a card, and his flavor text reads: \"\"Xavius has grand nightmares of summoning &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; into this world, but a few Satyr will have to do for now.\"\"\nSpeculation.\nHow exactly Xavius returned in \"Legion\" despite his apparent death in \"Stormrage\" is left unstated, but implied to be the work of N'Zoth to some extent. One possibility, given how his death within the Rift of Aln appears to be final, is that much like elementals and demons, he could only be killed for good in that one specific spot.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

Those who venture into the Nightmare will face the full extent of his power, and his true form - a grotesque and distended monstrosity.\"\nOverview.\nMost of Nightmare Lord Xavius's attacks inflict Corruption on their victims. As a player gains more Corruption, they become increasingly vulnerable to the power of the Nightmare, eventually losing control entirely and turning against their friends at maximum Corruption. Players' only hope lies in the power of Ysera, who puts many of them into a deep slumber and forms a Dream Simulacrum of those players. When their Simulacrum perishes, the affected player will awaken, as any Corruption gained by their Simulacrum dissipates harmlessly.\nAbilities.\nThe Dream.\nWhen Xavius reaches 95% and 60% health, the Dream of Ysera puts half of the party into a Dreaming State. Affected players fall asleep while a Dream Simulacrum of them rises to fight Xavius. If the Dream Simulacrum should ever die, the player's actual body will awaken. All Nightmare Corruption gained by the Dream Simulacrum is lost when the player returns to their body.\nNightmare Corruption.\nMany of Xavius's spells spread Nightmare Corruption to those hit. The more corrupted a player becomes, the more the nightmare becomes real to the player. Should any player ever become completely corrupted, they will become dominated by Xavius.\nStage Two: From the Shadows.\nUpon reaching 65% health remaining, Xavius intensifies his attack.\nStage Three: World of Darkness.\nUpon reaching 30% health remaining, Xavius calls upon the purest Nightmare to engulf his enemies."}

For millennia, she led a crusade against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; as leader of the &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Army of the Light&lt;/a&gt;.\nShe sent her core, known as &lt;a href=\"%3ALight%27s%20Heart\"&gt;:Light's Heart&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; during the Legion's &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt;, in an attempt to aid the mortal forces fight off the invading &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s and find the subject of her &lt;a href=\"Prophet%23Known%20prophecies\"&gt;prophecy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;. She was made whole again during the invasion of &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"class%20order\"&gt;Azerothian forces&lt;/a&gt;, but Illidan rejected her and destroyed Xe'ra.\nHistory.\nXe'ra was one of the first naaru forged during the great ordering of the cosmos, and was allegedly \"at the Beginning, when mortal life itself was but a distant dream\", when she mentioned that she was among those who failed to stop the Legion's rise. After the fall of &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;, the \"&lt;a href=\"Genedar\"&gt;Genedar&lt;/a&gt;\" split into two separate &lt;a href=\"dimensional%20ship\"&gt;vessels&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;'s finest warriors followed the prime naaru Xe'ra aboard the \"&lt;a href=\"Xenedar\"&gt;Xenedar&lt;/a&gt;\" as the &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Army of the Light&lt;/a&gt; in an eternal war to bring about the Legion's end. Since then, other survivors of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt; have joined the ranks of the Lightforged.\nXe'ra kept from the Army, the knowledge that a naaru could fall to the Void, something they would only learn on &lt;a href=\"Eredath\"&gt;Eredath&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"L%27ura\"&gt;L'ura&lt;/a&gt;.\nA Thousand Years of War.\nEven though &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; had been advised against it, she started delving into the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;, and left the &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Army of the Light&lt;/a&gt; under the tutelage of &lt;a href=\"Locus-Walker\"&gt;Locus-Walker&lt;/a&gt;. She would eventually return to the \"Xenedar\", and aid the Army against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Xe'ra tried to convince her to abandon her endeavor and keep to the Light, but Alleria refused. Although X'era was eventually dissuaded by Turalyon from putting Alleria to death, and despite Alleria's arguments that they were not enemies despite their different affiliations, she nevertheless had Alleria imprisoned aboard the \"&lt;a href=\"Xenedar\"&gt;Xenedar&lt;/a&gt;\", at least until she accepted \"the path of righteousness\" once again.\nAt an unknown point in time, Xe'ra became convinced that another mortal from Azeroth, &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, was \"the child of Light and Shadow\": a hero destined to end the age of demons.\nIllidan.\nOne month before the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt;, while sending his spirit into the Nether to scout the location of &lt;a href=\"Nathreza\"&gt;Nathreza&lt;/a&gt;, Illidan briefly thought he sensed something watching him. A month later, when he sent his soul to &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt; and began casting a spell that would allow him to open a portal between that world and &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, he again noticed the presence observing him. However, it was magically shrouded and eluded his attempts at perception. Once inside the &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden%27s%20palace\"&gt;palace of Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;, Illidan was caught in a magical trap which almost alerted &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; to his intrusion. The watching presence intervened by distracting the Deceiver and freeing Illidan from the trap. It then telepathically told him to leave, at which point his spirit was instantly sent back to Outland. Illidan sensed that his savior was a blindingly bright being of Light, but he refused to trust it since he suspected that it could be a deception by Kil'jaeden.\nThe day before his defeat in the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt;, Illidan sent his soul back to Argus to finish linking the planet to Outland. He once again sensed the presence watching his work with curiosity while evading all of his attempts to reveal it, which he took as a sign of great sorcerous ability. The moment he finished the spell, the presence overwhelmed him with such immense power that he was helpless to resist. It transported him to an illusory plain of Light, where it revealed itself to be \"an elder naaru\", \"possibly the eldest now remaining in these universes\", who had been waiting for the universe to produce a hero like Illidan. Illidan sensed that the naaru was even stronger than &lt;a href=\"A%27dal\"&gt;A'dal&lt;/a&gt;, but remained suspicious that the meeting was a trap by Kil'jaeden. The naaru told Illidan that he was destined to defeat a foe even greater than the Burning Legion, namely the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;, and then shot a bolt of Light into his eyes in order to grant him a vision of a future in which he had been transformed into a champion of the Light, leading an army against creatures of the Void. The naaru then ended the illusion they stood inside, returning them to Argus, and branded Illidan's forehead with a holy rune before bidding him farewell and disappearing. Illidan wasn't sure what to make of the meeting; he thought that the naaru's vision had felt true, but simultaneously doubted that he could ever find redemption in such a way. Hours later, when Illidan was killed atop the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20Summit\"&gt;Temple Summit&lt;/a&gt;, the last thing he saw before he collapsed was a vision of the naaru's sigil.\nAlthough never expressly identified, the elder naaru's description, behavior, and intentions for Illidan all match those of Xe'ra.\nLegion.\nBy the time the Legion launched its &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt; of Azeroth, the Army of the Light was teetering on the brink of destruction on Argus. In desperation, Xe'ra sent her core, known as &lt;a href=\"%3ALight%27s%20Heart\"&gt;:Light's Heart&lt;/a&gt;, to Azeroth in order to aid its inhabitants and find the child of Light and Shadow. This action weakened her. Light's Heart cut a swathe through the &lt;a href=\"Felstorm\"&gt;Felstorm&lt;/a&gt; above the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, and radiated enough power that &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; scouts could feel it coursing through their body. It fell near the coast of &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt; where it was first found by &lt;a href=\"gilgoblin\"&gt;gilgoblin&lt;/a&gt;s, who brought it to a &lt;a href=\"sea%20giant\"&gt;sea giant&lt;/a&gt;, from whom an &lt;a href=\"class%20order\"&gt;order&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;champion&lt;/a&gt; sent by &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; would retrieve it. A message from &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;High General Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; revealed that Light's Heart had been sent as the &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Army of the Light&lt;/a&gt;'s last resort as they were fighting their final war against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. He then asked for the core to be handed to &lt;a href=\"Prophet%20Velen\"&gt;Prophet Velen&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the \"&lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt;\", Velen recognized Light's Heart and stated that it could only be unlocked by another naaru in Xe'ra's line. &lt;a href=\"O%27ros\"&gt;O'ros&lt;/a&gt;, being the last of Xe'ra's line, was thus targetted and killed during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Exodar\"&gt;Battle for the Exodar&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"High%20General%20Rakeesh\"&gt;Rakeesh&lt;/a&gt;, who did not want Velen to obtain the information contained with the core. However, the &lt;a href=\"Tears%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Tears of Elune&lt;/a&gt; somehow managed to open Light's Heart at Khadgar's suggestion.\nUpon doing so, the spirit of the order champion was sent to Xe'ra. There, she told them about her prophecy regarding &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, the \"child of Light and Shadow\", destined to end the age of demons. Through Light's Heart, she would later continue to communicate with the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;champion&lt;/a&gt; charged to protect her core and try to guide them towards \"redemption\", as in her eyes the champion's participation (if applicable) in the &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;death of Illidan&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt; was a terrible mistake. Xe'ra claimed that once their work of reuniting Illidan's body with his soul was done, her final task would be complete and she would be lost to the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;Great Dark Beyond&lt;/a&gt;. However, after Illidan was made whole again, Xe'ra was not lost.\nShadows of Argus.\nTuralyon, Alleria, and a champion from Azeroth later traveled to the \"Xenedar\", which crashed in &lt;a href=\"Krokuun\"&gt;Krokuun&lt;/a&gt;, where they found the gravely injured Xe'ra and teleported her to the \"&lt;a href=\"Vindicaar\"&gt;Vindicaar&lt;/a&gt;\". Light's Heart was placed back at her center, and Xe'ra awakened. She asked Illidan to join the Light and fulfill his destiny, but Illidan refused. Xe'ra thus forcefully bound Illidan in chains of light and attempted to fulfill her own prophecy by force. The demon hunter however broke free and destroyed Xe'ra. An enraged Turalyon accused Illidan of dooming them all and attempted to strike him down, but Illidan blocked Turalyon's blow and told him that his faith had blinded him. According to Illidan, there was no chosen one, only they could save themselves. Velen would comment that her loss was a blow and condemned Illidan for killing her along with Xe'ra's attempting to force destiny upon them. Artificer Rommul would also say Xe'ra's loss was his most troubling experience in the conflict thus far.\nThe shards of Xe'ra were collected by Velen, who swore that the Light did not die with her and shone in each of them. Xe'ra's light was then safeguarded within the &lt;a href=\"Netherlight%20Crucible\"&gt;Netherlight Crucible&lt;/a&gt;.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

Now this hardnosed ethereal is executing a three-point business plan: destroy his enemies, escape incarceration, and get back to servicing his biggest client.\"\nStrategies.\nHeroic mode\nThe key to this encounter are the Ethereal Spheres. On his own, Xevozz does not put out very much damage. If he gets near a Sphere, Xevozz's damage output will increase significantly. Additionally, if Xevozz has &lt;a href=\"LOS\"&gt;LOS&lt;/a&gt; to a sphere for any length of time he will teleport himself and the party on top of it, which will cause a great deal of sadness. In order to prevent this from happening, the tank will need to kite Xevozz across the balcony. The Spheres will attempt to follow, but for the most part they will not be able to catch Xevozz.\nThe most effective kiting strategy involves picking up Xevozz on the stairwell immediately to the left of his cell. The tank should be on the stairs themselves, with ranged DPS and heals up at the top. When Xevozz summons the orbs, the tank should begin kiting him up onto the balcony and then to stairwell at the far end of the instance. The tank's focus needs to be on keeping Xevozz moving, maintaining threat is secondary (since the entire party is moving Xevozz should not be taking much damage). \nBy the time Xevozz reaches the opposite side of the instance the spheres should have despawned. Fight Xevozz on these stairs until he once again summons orbs, and repeat the kiting process.\nHealers and DPS should focus on staying ahead of the kiting path, to avoid getting near any orbs that may be following Xevozz. Xevozz will usually go down after 1 or 2 kiting passes.\nIf a teleport is triggered, everyone needs to focus on getting away from the three orbs as quickly as possible. The tank should declare a spot everyone should move toward. DPS should do nothing but get out of the way. Healers will need to move while keeping the tank topped off, as Xevozz's damage output is going to increase considerably.\nNotes.\nIf your party wipes after defeating Xevozz, he will be replaced with the &lt;a href=\"Ethereal%20Wind%20Trader\"&gt;Ethereal Wind Trader&lt;/a&gt; during subsequent attempts."}

Xhul'horac activates the Fel portal first, granting him fel abilities and summoning first Imps and then Vanguard Akkelion. When Akkelion dies, Xhul'horac activates the void portal, granting him void abilities and summoning Unstable Voidfiends and then Omnus. Once Omnus is defeated, Xhul'horac gains the energy of both fel and void, rapidly switching between elements. Once he reaches 20% health, he completely absorbs the power of both portals and must be quickly defeated.\nAbilities.\nUnleashed Energies.\nThroughout the encounter, Xhul'horac focuses the wild energy of fel and void in his summoning chamber, letting them smolder out of control - and mixing them with deadly results.\nStage One: The Legion's Flame.\nXhul'horac, tainted with Fel energy, summons forth servants of the Legion and attacks with Fel magic.\nStage Two: Grasp of the Void.\nXhul'horac opens the Void portal, summoning forth fellow Void creatures and drawing strength from the power of the Void.\nStage Three: The Shadowfel Amalgamation.\nOverwhelmed by channeling a combination of Void and Fel energies, Xhul'horac's form begins rapidly shifting between one dominated by Fel and Void magic.\nStage Four: Tearing Apart.\nXhul'horac completely absorbs the energy of both the Void and Fel portals, preventing any new creatures from coming through them, and rapidly destabilizing.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;\n "}
