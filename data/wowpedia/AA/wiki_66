There are four base types of dragon that the player can choose from, each of which has over 50 customizations available.\nThe flying itself is dynamic, factoring in momentum, for instance. Players can upgrade their flying skills; speed is one of the attributes that can be improved.\nDragonriding is currently limited to the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;. Each of the four zones introduces a new type of dragon. Once unlocked, dragonriding is available to all characters on the account.\n&lt;a href=\"Dracthyr%20%28playable%29\"&gt;Dracthyr&lt;/a&gt; have a racial ability, &lt;a href=\"Soar\"&gt;Soar&lt;/a&gt;, that is a type of flying similar to dragonriding, but is not upgradable the way mounted dragonriding is. Unlike dragonriding, the Soar racial ability can be used outside the Dragon Isles.\nDragonriding mounts.\nDragonriding mounts can be customized at a &lt;a href=\"Rostrum%20of%20Transformation\"&gt;Rostrum of Transformation&lt;/a&gt; found in most zones of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpgrading.\nTo further improve dragonriding, skills and passives can be unlocked to improve how much and how fast &lt;a href=\"Vigor%20%28dragonriding%29\"&gt;Vigor (dragonriding)&lt;/a&gt; can recharge. The skills window can be accessed from the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles%20Summary\"&gt;Dragon Isles Summary&lt;/a&gt; button next to the &lt;a href=\"minimap\"&gt;minimap&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo unlock additional traits, the player must level up.\nRaces.\nAcross the Dragon Isles, the bronze flight has organized a series of &lt;a href=\"Dragonriding%20races\"&gt;Dragonriding races&lt;/a&gt;. Compete against the clock to earn numerous achievements across three race types: normal, advanced, and advanced reverse."}

Nightmare Dragons) were four &lt;a href=\"Green%20dragonflight\"&gt;green dragons&lt;/a&gt; corrupted by the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;. Formerly &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera's&lt;/a&gt; lieutenants, the four caused havoc across &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; for years until being stopped. Three were slain and one was redeemed.\nThey were &lt;a href=\"Lethon%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Lethon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emeriss%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Emeriss&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ysondre%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Ysondre&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Taerar%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Taerar&lt;/a&gt;. These dragons were world spawns located in &lt;a href=\"Duskwood\"&gt;Duskwood&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Grove\"&gt;Twilight Grove&lt;/a&gt;), the &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Seradane\"&gt;Seradane&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Feralas\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Dream%20Bough\"&gt;Dream Bough&lt;/a&gt;), and &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Bough%20Shadow\"&gt;Bough Shadow&lt;/a&gt;). The dragons were removed following \"\". It was later revealed that Lethon and Emeriss were killed during the &lt;a href=\"War%20Against%20the%20Nightmare\"&gt;War Against the Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;, Ysondre freed herself from the Nightmare's corruption, and Taerar is killed during the &lt;a href=\"Feralas%20storyline\"&gt;Feralas storyline&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Taerar%27s%20Fall\"&gt;Taerar's Fall&lt;/a&gt;, ending the Dragons of Nightmare's corrupt influence. They would return, however, when &lt;a href=\"Xavius\"&gt;Xavius&lt;/a&gt; and the Nightmare resurfaced as bosses within the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare raid&lt;/a&gt;.\nSince the &lt;a href=\"WoW%27s%2013th%20Anniversary\"&gt;WoW's 13th Anniversary&lt;/a&gt;, the Dragons of Nightmare have returned for the anniversary event along with daily quest &lt;a href=\"The%20Originals\"&gt;The Originals&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nPrior to the start of the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt;'s most trusted lieutenants were warped by a &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;dark new power&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;. These wayward sentinels passed through the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Tree\"&gt;Great Tree&lt;/a&gt;s into &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, intending to spread madness and terror throughout the mortal kingdoms.\nLethon.\n&lt;a href=\"Lethon\"&gt;Lethon&lt;/a&gt;'s exposure to the aberration within the Emerald Dream not only darkened the hue of the mighty dragon's scales, but also empowered him with the ability to extract malevolent shades from his enemies. Once joined with their master, the shades imbue the dragon with healing energies. It should come as no surprise, then, that Lethon is considered to be among the most formidable of Ysera's wayward lieutenants.\nLethon was killed by the redeemed &lt;a href=\"Eranikus\"&gt;Eranikus&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"War%20Against%20the%20Nightmare\"&gt;War Against the Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;.\nEmeriss.\nThe mysterious dark power within the Emerald Dream has transformed the once-majestic &lt;a href=\"Emeriss\"&gt;Emeriss&lt;/a&gt; into a rotting, diseased monstrosity. Reports from the few who have survived encounters with the dragon have told horrifying tales of putrid mushrooms erupting from the corpses of their dead companions. Emeriss is truly the most gruesome and appalling of Ysera's estranged green dragons.\nEmeriss was accidentally killed when &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; attempted to remove her corruption during the &lt;a href=\"War%20Against%20the%20Nightmare\"&gt;War Against the Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;, as it was all that was left of her.\nTaerar.\n&lt;a href=\"Taerar\"&gt;Taerar&lt;/a&gt; was perhaps the most affected of Ysera's rogue lieutenants. His interaction with the dark force within the Emerald Dream shattered Taerar's sanity as well as his corporeal form. The dragon now exists as a specter with the ability to split into multiple entities, each of which possesses destructive magical powers. Taerar was a cunning and relentless foe who was intent on turning the madness of his existence into reality for the inhabitants of Azeroth.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;\", he is killed by &lt;a href=\"Ysondre\"&gt;Ysondre&lt;/a&gt; with the help of &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s during &lt;a href=\"Taerar%27s%20Fall\"&gt;Taerar's Fall&lt;/a&gt;.\nYsondre.\nOnce one of Ysera's most trusted lieutenants, &lt;a href=\"Ysondre\"&gt;Ysondre&lt;/a&gt; had gone rogue, sowing terror and chaos across the land of Azeroth. Her formerly beneficial healing powers had given way to dark magics, enabling her to cast smoldering lightning and summon the aid of fiendish druids. Ysondre and her kin also possessed the ability to induce sleep, sending her unfortunate mortal foes to the realm of their most terrifying nightmares.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;\", Ysondre was later freed of her insanity and, after aiding adventurers in killing Taerar, set about living a peaceful life among mortals for the rest of her days after &lt;a href=\"Ysondre%27s%20Farewell\"&gt;Ysondre's Farewell&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt;\", Ysondre has been drawn back into the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; and the corrupted spirits of her former comrades have joined her, completely consuming the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dreamway\"&gt;Emerald Dreamway&lt;/a&gt; in shadows. She is ultimately slain, but her spirit and the spirits of her comrades are seen in the restored Emerald Dream after &lt;a href=\"Xavius\"&gt;Xavius&lt;/a&gt; is defeated.\nStrategy.\nThey are raid-level difficulty, though some dragons are more challenging than others.\nAll four dragons share the Sleep (summoning \"Dream Fog\"), Noxious Breath, Tail Sweep, Mark of Nature and Aura of Nature abilities. Each dragon also has a few unique abilities. One of these is considered the dragon's ace move, and will be performed when the dragon loses 25 \u00b1 5% of its max life. In other words, the ace move will only be performed three times; when the dragon is at 25%, 50%, and 75% life. When it is performed, the dragon will also yell something. See the individual dragons' page for abilities and specific strategies."}

I'll teach you how to make this fine mail armor, but only if you agree to certain conditions.\nBy choosing this path, you agree never to learn elemental or tribal leatherworking; there is only room for one of the three at the apex of the craft.

They're somewhat similar in concept to a &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 from the waist up they are humanoid lizards and from the waist down they have the body of a dragon. They walk on their four dragon legs and use their arms to carry their weapons. They usually wear armor. The largest, most powerful dragonspawn (such as &lt;a href=\"General%20Drakkisath\"&gt;General Drakkisath&lt;/a&gt;) have wings as well, though most do not. They do not seem to be able to fly, though.\nLike the similar &lt;a href=\"drakonid\"&gt;drakonid&lt;/a&gt;, dragonspawn were originally mortals that were transformed by the dragons they served (via intentional alteration or via \u201cunintended side effect of hanging out with dragons\u201d).\" The process does not have to be willing. While the species originated as transformed mortals, they can lay eggs and it is possible to be born as a dragonspawn.\nAfter finishing their training, young dragonspawn are given a Calling which will determine the job they are to do for the dragons. The ceremony to get their Calling is called the Lifecalling Ceremony. A Calling can change throughout a dragonspawn's life.\nHeeding the call of their goddess, &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt;, the green dragonspawn stand to protect &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; from the waking evil within the &lt;a href=\"Sunken%20Temple\"&gt;Sunken Temple&lt;/a&gt;. Among the murk-ridden marshes of the &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20of%20Sorrows\"&gt;Swamp of Sorrows&lt;/a&gt;, the green dragonspawn patrol at the behest of their dreaming mistress; Ysera has warned of a lurking terror within the temple, and her loyal servants are determined to protect the land from the emerging doom.\nDragonspawn of the &lt;a href=\"red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; tell legends of the Great Dragon Spirit, a &lt;a href=\"red%20dragon\"&gt;red dragon&lt;/a&gt; who is said to have, as she died, sang a song so beautiful that it caused flowers to bloom around her body. It is said that if a red dragonkin proves their devotion to life, her spirit will rise to sing the song once more.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Primalists\"&gt;war against the Primalists&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;s returned to the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt; and many dragonspawn rejoiced in their return, joining them in the &lt;a href=\"Valdrakken%20Accord\"&gt;Valdrakken Accord&lt;/a&gt;. However, a number of dragonspawn was discontent with them and the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt; and instead joined the &lt;a href=\"Flightless\"&gt;Flightless&lt;/a&gt; in an open rebellion against &lt;a href=\"Valdrakken\"&gt;Valdrakken&lt;/a&gt;, or the &lt;a href=\"Sundered%20Flame\"&gt;Sundered Flame&lt;/a&gt;, seeking artifacts and power, as well as the &lt;a href=\"Primalists\"&gt;Primalists&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; worked with the &lt;a href=\"Scalesworn\"&gt;Scalesworn&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to stop the rebellion in &lt;a href=\"Thaldraszus\"&gt;Thaldraszus&lt;/a&gt;. On other fronts, numbers of the Sundered Flame and the Primalists were defeated.\nFlights.\nDragonspawn can be found as members of all five major dragonflights, though they are also a common sight in the various derivatives of these flights as well. A number of them have also joined with the &lt;a href=\"Primalists\"&gt;Primalists&lt;/a&gt;; seeking to remove the rule of the Aspects from their people.\nIn the RPG.\nDescription.\nDragonspawn are monstrous beings trained to serve under the five dragonflights of the world, and some say they evolved from humans who dedicated their lives to servitude under the great dragons.\nThe dragonflights of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; are not without retainers and assistants. Noble humanoids serve the dragons with absolute loyalty, acting as footmen, soldiers, assistants, and companions. They are endowed with many of the dragon's mystic abilities and virtuous qualities.\nExactly how they came into being is a guarded secret of the flights. Though they have dragon-like qualities, these creatures are not descended from dragons. Instead, they are distant kinfolk, descended from humanoids who spent their lives so close to the dragons that they took on the qualities of their masters after generations of service. They are gifted with unique advantages of their dragon blood and heritage, including immunity to their dragonflight's breath weapon. They have the same alignment and goals as their patron dragonflight. The lower bodies of dragonspawn are much like dragons, a scaled hide with four legs and a tail. They have humanoid torsos with long, thick arms, and scaled, draconic heads. Their hides and draconic features are the color of their patron flight. They can be of either gender and serve their dragonflight with the utmost dedication. Dragonspawn have similar physiques regardless of the flight they belong to, but each individual squadron is armed in the color of its dragonflight. Furthermore, dragonspawn often bear a mark upon their breastplates or shields that reflect their individual mentor or patron, giving honor to the dragon who trained them. Armor always reflects the scale coloring of the patron dragonflight (black, blue, bronze, green, or red). On Azeroth, draconic influence does not increase the potential to be a sorcerer. As such, those few wyrmkin who do develop magic abilities are prized as rare \"throwbacks\" to their ancestral human ties.\nDragonspawn have the lower body of a reptile, with four legs and a tail. Their torso and arms are humanoid, while their head is that of a dragon. Black dragonspawn have a scaled hide of lustrous ebony and eyes that are deep red. A black &lt;a href=\"scalebane\"&gt;scalebane&lt;/a&gt; wears massive scale mail etched with draconic motifs, and a helm and shield with a crested black dragon design. A bejeweled greatsword hangs in a sheath across their back along with a lacquered composite longbow. Bronze dragonspawn have a hide of shimmering bronze with rich copper markings. A bronze &lt;a href=\"Flametongue%20%28dragonspawn%29\"&gt;flametongue&lt;/a&gt; wears fine bronze-plated scale mail and a broad shield engraved with draconic designs, with a well-crafted longsword at his side and a spear in one hand. A red &lt;a href=\"wyrmkin\"&gt;wyrmkin&lt;/a&gt; has a scaled hide of deep red and bright crimson. He wears scale mail that is of superior quality, a dark copper in tone and etched with draconic sigils. His golden eyes gleam with zealous fervor as he hefts an exotic longsword in one hand and a broad shield in the other.\nCulture.\nDragonspawn society is limited in scope and is comprised of flametongues, scalebanes, and wyrm kin. Trained as a slave race, they worship dragons and are willing to die without question in their mentor's name. They prize loyalty and honor as well as strength at arms, and their societies are little more than military units and segregation. Dragonspawn are most often seen near or around the holdings or lairs of the dragonflights they serve. They travel in small to large organized squads, marching in formations.\nBy virtue of their unique lineage, dragonspawn are immune to the breath of their own flight. For example, red wyrmkin are immune to the fiery breath of a red dragon. Dragonspawn are likewise generally immune to the frightful presence of any dragon of their flight. Black and red both share the fire subtype. Chromatic dragonspawn technically have both the cold and fire subtypes, which effectively negate one another, limiting their resistance to acid, cold and fire.\nMilitary tactics.\nEach dragonspawn host has a unique way of waging war, with few similarities among them. One of the few unifying tactics is an en-masse assault that involves hindering enemy movements with great numbers of wyrmkin infantry. As the dragonspawn occupy enemy forces, a dragon invariably bathes the writhing melee with its breath weapon. Dragonspawn are immune to the breath weapons of their hosts, so these attacks leave devastating gaps in enemy defenses. With this tactic, the dragonspawn systematically wade through the remnants of now charred or slowly dissolving enemy formations.\nIn close combat, the tactics of a force of dragonspawn vary from host to host. Black dragonspawn are brutal and relentless, often able to rage and sunder the enemy\u2019s defenses with their brute strength and vicious claws and teeth \u2014 augmented by draconic magic or magical equipment.\nRed and green dragonspawn rely on strategy, planning and sheer strength. Their ability to intimidate the enemy through size and numbers serves them well; few can withstand the sight of a tactically sound dragonspawn charge.\nBronze and blue dragonspawn are the most likely to use offensive magic in combat. They rely on spellcasters and magi like other armies might rely on archers. With waves of arcane bolts and fire falling from the sky, an opposing force often finds itself the victim of arcane assault long before it will ever engage a dragonspawn in close combat. When a dragonspawn finally moves in for the kill it is armed with alchemical flasks, weapons, and magically enhanced armaments, and heavy armor covers it from head to toe.\nDragonspawn rely on castes to regiment their armies. Wyrmkin serve as solid ground troops. These warriors train long and hard and serve as buffers between a dragon and his enemies. Scalebanes serve as unit commanders in the field, acting as the instruments of their master\u2019s will. Half taskmaster, half drill sergeant, a scalebane often serves as the source of a dragonspawn host\u2019s arcane firepower. Most are warriors and magi both, capable of bringing sword or spell to bear on an enemy. Heavily indoctrinated by their masters, and privileged with better living conditions and food, scalebanes are the dragonspawn elite in the actual field of war. They are much more highly valued than most wyrmkin.\nNames.\nDragonspawn names are harsh and simple, with no family name to speak of; they are usually referred to by their place in the hierarchy, much like a military rank, and the name they were given at birth. Dragonspawn adventurers often refer to themselves simply by their given names.\nBlue dragonspawn.\nBlue dragonspawn are the descendants of mortals who associated with blue dragons so closely that their families gradually transformed into part-humanoid, part-dragon crossbreeds. They take many roles in the blue dragonflight, serving as foot soldiers, emissaries to the humanoid races, and companions. While the dragons respect them, they are essentially a slave race, and they are trained from birth to give their lives to protect dragons (most dragonspawn are intelligent and loyal enough to sacrifice themselves without any such training, however). Most dragonspawn are raised and tutored by a dragon, in addition to their dragonspawn parents, and they often wear the symbol of this mentor for the rest of their lives. While dragonspawn exist for all the major dragonflights, an unusually large number of blue dragonspawn progress beyond the level of simply serving as grunt soldiers of the blue dragonflight. The unusual intelligence and disposition toward magic associated with the blue dragonflight is true of the dragonspawn as well, and this makes them more likely to follow in the footsteps of their mentors and become arcanists. Magical aptitude is rare among dragonspawn, however; it is simply less so among the blues.\nGeneral Cobaltann, one of the eldest and most powerful of the blue dragonspawn, has organized an army to protect all creatures against the threat of the black dragonflight \u2014 and if he has his way, his army will grow strong enough to obliterate the black dragonflight.\nBlue dragonspawn have the same interests and lifestyles as their blue dragon mentors, but they tend to work in groups, often times with a military function. These dragonspawn are almost never found far from at least one dragon of their flight.\nAppearance.\nBlue dragonspawn resemble blue dragons from the waist down, but their upper bodies are those of scaled humanoids. Their arms and torsos resemble those of a human, with only slight claws in most cases, but their heads more closely resemble their draconic allies. Blue dragonspawn scales are similar in color to those of blue dragons, and they typically wear armor with colors to match their dragonflight as well. This creature have the lower body of a reptile, with four massive, scale-covered legs. His torso and arms are humanoid, while his head is that of a dragon \u2014 and he has a noticeable draconic tail as well. His scales are azure, but it is difficult to distinguish them from the blue armor he wears over them. His armor is etched with draconic symbols, and similar tattoos line the scales on his exposed lower arms. Standing tall on four well-muscled legs, the creature flexes massive arms clearly capable of swinging its sword with deadly force. Its scaled armor is an enameled sapphire blue, brighter than the color of the natural scales that cover the majority of its humanoid upper body. The creature\u2019s head resembles that of a small azure dragon.\nCulture.\nBlue dragonspawn communities are male dominated, not because of any difference in power or physical strength, but rather due to the amount of time females spend dealing with the young. While blue dragonspawn value their children as much as any race, they are so focused on military objectives and the achievement of greater power and knowledge that they often neglect their young more than most races; this is especially true of the males. Unlike blue dragons, dragonspawn have a set ranking system. Blue dragonspawn ranks include (in ascending order) azurewing, cold talon, shiver scale, ice blade, magefury, winterfury, arctic magus, and ice tempest. The highest ranks are available only to those individuals who exhibit arcane mastery.\nMany dragonspawn are &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"scout\"&gt;scout&lt;/a&gt;s or other combat-oriented classes. The &lt;a href=\"gladiator\"&gt;gladiator&lt;/a&gt; prestige class is popular among melee-oriented dragonspawn. A few dragonspawn &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s worship the blue dragonflight or Malygos, contrary to most blue dragon beliefs.\nSpeculation.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Dragonkin\"&gt;Dragonkin&lt;/a&gt;\" as a more specific term than the &lt;a href=\"creature%20type\"&gt;creature type&lt;/a&gt; may be a \"race\" that includes both drakonid and dragonspawn, as the term has been used to refer to a category and origin story that seemingly includes both."}

{"id": "171520", "revid": "27079649", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=171520", "title": "Dragonsworn", "text": "For centuries, the great &lt;a href=\"dragonflight\"&gt;dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;s have noted the potential of younger races. In a few select cases, they choose a creature of another race to be one of a select few with the privilege of directly serving a &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt; or an entire group of dragons. Such devotees dedicate their lives to the protection and service of their dragonflights and reap the benefits of the great knowledge and power that their draconic masters share. Rumors say that the first dragonsworn were the forefathers of the &lt;a href=\"dragonspawn\"&gt;dragonspawn&lt;/a&gt; race. This is, of course, just a rumor.\nEach dragonflight treats its dragonsworn differently, and grants them slightly different boons for their service. The patron dragon for a dragonsworn of the &lt;a href=\"bronze%20dragonflight\"&gt;bronze dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; might give a faithful disciple a relic from the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, whereas a dragonsworn of &lt;a href=\"Nefarian\"&gt;Nefarian&lt;/a&gt; might be taught the basics of how to manipulate the deadly power of shadow flame. While these rewards might sound tempting, dragons live a long time, and most of the flights barely notice the passing of years. It\u2019s possible for a servant to dedicate his life to a flight without any real notice or recognition \u2014 especially for the shorter-lived races, such as humans.\nThe legends tell that while these dragonsworn were always extremely rare, they may have been more common in the past \u2014 but there is a large gap in the records where such disciples are practically unheard of. It is the green dragonflight that revived the tradition of bringing allies of other races into their ranks, and a few of the other flights seem to have followed suit. Regardless of which flight was the first to resume adopting humanoid followers, dragons take more and more dragonsworn into their service; in some cases the reasons are obvious, but it remains a mystery why certain flights (such as the blue) would begin to trust other races now.\nDragonsworn in the world.\nTraditionally, the most well-known dragonsworn are &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s in service of &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt;; that is not to say that all druids who walked the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; were chosen to serve the green dragonflight, but many were taken into Ysera\u2019s service in the thousands of years they slept. Most of the typical servants of each flight have an occupation that matches the interests of the flight: &lt;a href=\"Blue%20dragon\"&gt;Blue dragon&lt;/a&gt;s favor talented &lt;a href=\"magi\"&gt;magi&lt;/a&gt;, but a trustworthy &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt; might also gain their interest. Of course, some people are chosen simply for their dedication \u2014 while the bronze dragonflight may not have any particular tie to a warrior, he might impress with his strength and loyalty. All potential dragonsworn show some magical proclivity, though.\nNight elves were the most common dragonsworn in the past, due to their immortality. In fact, this immortality actually allowed some elves to outlive their draconic teachers; such night elves were highly respected by the dragonflights they served. Though lifelong loyalty was once the quality dragons valued most, now the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; looks for adventurers who show potential for great power; perhaps it hopes to bring the next Medivh into its ranks. The other flights fear that a traitor entrusted with their secrets could be an unparalleled danger, but nevertheless a few dragons have begun teaching the younger races. However, few adventurers are willing to make the sacrifices necessary to earn the trust of an entire flight.\nMore dragonsworn are in the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; than the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, primarily because night elves are still the most common dragonsworn of the flights (other than the black), but also because most &lt;a href=\"red%20dragon\"&gt;red dragon&lt;/a&gt;s won\u2019t have anything to do with &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s after the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;. Most disciples of the dragonflights aren\u2019t affiliated with either faction, but a few belong to other organizations, such as the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt;. Dragonsworn serve as the eyes and ears of the dragonflights in locations dragons may not wish to travel, and some infiltrate other groups to gather information. Since the average adventurer probably doesn\u2019t even know that these people exist, most dragonsworn find it easy to keep their service a secret, knowing that many would not understand their dedication. While night elves, magi, and others with knowledge of the dragonflights may see an association with dragons as positive, warriors who fought against the red flight in the Second War probably would not. Some dragonsworn might seek to teach others about the ways of the dragons to dispel the hatred of those who lost family and friends to blacks or reds, but most prefer to lie low and keep to themselves.\nA devotee of the Aspects might join a group of adventurers to better serve her flight, perhaps to find a magic object or just learn more about the world. In such a situation, knowledge is the greatest weapon; she may learn secrets and magic unknown to the rest of the world.\nThey speak &lt;a href=\"Draconic\"&gt;Draconic&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpeculation.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Watcher%20%28bronze%20dragonflight%29\"&gt;Bronze watchers&lt;/a&gt; may be considered dragonsworn due to their role:\nThere are also a number of mortals in service to various dragonflights who may match the criteria of being dragonsworn:"}

She will fight with Drahga until she reaches 20% remaining health, when she ejects Drahga and leaves him to face the players alone.\nStrategy.\nWhen Drahga yells or , a patch of fire appear on the ground. After a few seconds, an elemental will spawn at the patch and fixate on a random party member. If the elemental reaches the chosen party member, it will likely kill them. It is imperative that everyone moves away from the fire patch, DPS focuses on the elemental after it spawns (applying stuns and snares if possible), and the targeted person keeps away from the elemental until it is killed.\nEventually, Drahga will mount Valiona. During this phase everyone needs to stay out of Shredding Swipe (a ground-based AoE zone), and, on heroic difficulty, out of Valiona's frontal cone Devouring Flames. Note that Devouring Flames is cast in a random direction, so everyone needs to move out of its way. Drahga will continue casting fireballs at random party members and summoning elemental adds during this phase.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}
{"id": "26852", "revid": "22514", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=26852", "title": "Drain", "text": "Drain may refer to the general drain mechanic or specifically to the Warlock's drain spells (&lt;a href=\"Drain%20Life\"&gt;Drain Life&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Drain%20Mana\"&gt;Drain Mana&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Drain%20Soul\"&gt;Drain Soul&lt;/a&gt;).\nDefinition.\nDrains do exist in two forms: Mana Drains and Life Drains. The definitions of those two normally slightly differ. Common understanding is:\nCurrently, almost all of these spells are &lt;a href=\"Magic%20schools%23Shadow\"&gt;Shadow&lt;/a&gt; spells.\nLife Drains.\nLife Drain spells are abilities that simultaneously &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt; your target and &lt;a href=\"Healing\"&gt;heal&lt;/a&gt; you. They exist as &lt;a href=\"Direct%20Damage\"&gt;Direct Damage&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Direct%20Heal\"&gt;Direct Heal&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Channeled\"&gt;Channeled&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Damage%20over%20Time\"&gt;Damage over Time&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Heal%20over%20Time\"&gt;Heal over Time&lt;/a&gt;) spells. \nThey heal as much as they damage the target, and only for as much as they actually caused. So even when the combat log says that your Drain Life hit for 100, the player may only had 50 health left, hence you will be healed for 50. Absorb effects, such as &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Ward\"&gt;Shadow Ward&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Barrier\"&gt;Ice Barrier&lt;/a&gt;, and , will cause life drains to do no healing, although they do damage the target. This form of healing is now affected by healing reducing effects such as &lt;a href=\"Mortal%20Strike\"&gt;Mortal Strike&lt;/a&gt;. Their damage causes normal &lt;a href=\"threat\"&gt;threat&lt;/a&gt;, whereas their healing does not generate any threat at all.\nLife Drains are always binary effects, as such they can only hit or miss, there are no partial &lt;a href=\"Resistances\"&gt;resists&lt;/a&gt;. Some creatures, generally constructs, are immune to life draining effects. \nThey generally have the same spell damage rules as normal spells. However, any spell damage is equally divided among the damage and the heal. So for pure damaging purposes, those spells get less interesting. Furthermore, these effects do only benefit from general spell damage and their respective school's spell damage. They are not affected by pure healing. Therefore, they always do as much healing as damage, with only a few exceptions (&lt;a href=\"Vampiric%20Embrace\"&gt;Vampiric Embrace&lt;/a&gt;'s healing depends on the amount of players and talent points invested; &lt;a href=\"Fel%20Armor%20%28BC%20Classic%29\"&gt;Fel Armor (BC Classic)&lt;/a&gt; increases the health gain from any spell).\nMana Drains.\nMana Drain spells are abilities that remove mana from the enemy. Normally this mana is used for a secondary effect. They cannot be used against Rogues, Warriors and Druids in Bear or Cat form.\nThere are different realizations. For example, the Warlock's &lt;a href=\"Drain%20Mana\"&gt;Drain Mana&lt;/a&gt; transfers the mana to refill one's own mana pool. The Priest's &lt;a href=\"Mana%20Burn\"&gt;Mana Burn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Feedback%20%28priest%20ability%29\"&gt;Feedback&lt;/a&gt; use the mana to cause damage to the enemy. All of these effects depend on the actual amount of mana drained from the enemy.\nNeither the mana drain nor the caused damage do benefit from spell damage. These effects can only be raised by talents and debuffs which explicitly increase the drain or the respective school's damage."}

Some of the death knight's spells and abilities require spending runes; others require them having generated through battle a certain level of runic power. Every death knight who has not recently been in combat enters a fresh combat situation possessing six expendable runes but no runic power. Only by spending some of these runes (each of which regenerates after a short time) on battle abilities may the death knight thereby acquire and incrementally build up for a short time runic power, which in turn they may draw on for other spells. The death knight's rune system thus combines characteristics of those classes relying for combat powers on depleting-but-renewable resources \u2014 such as mana (mages, warlocks) and energy (rogues) \u2014 with those classes relying for combat powers on resources generated solely through battle itself, such as rage (warriors).\nRunes.\nBefore using any abilities, the death knight has six runes. Different abilities and spells consume different amounts of runes and, when used, will place one of the used runes on cooldown. Some abilities are able to refresh certain runes; &lt;a href=\"Empower%20Rune%20Weapon\"&gt;Empower Rune Weapon&lt;/a&gt; will refresh all of them simultaneously; &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Tap\"&gt;Blood Tap&lt;/a&gt; will refresh a single random fully depleted Rune; &lt;a href=\"Runic%20Empowerment\"&gt;Runic Empowerment&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Runic%20Corruption\"&gt;Runic Corruption&lt;/a&gt; gives a chance to refresh a rune when using runic power.\nRune cooldowns.\nRunes have a base cooldown of 10 seconds, which is then reduced by &lt;a href=\"haste\"&gt;haste&lt;/a&gt; (for example, 25% haste would give your runes an 8 second cooldown).\nRunic power.\nRunic power is an extra resource that builds up as the death knight use their abilities, displayed as an empty bar that fills up with a light sky blue color similar to &lt;a href=\"rage\"&gt;rage&lt;/a&gt; under the death knight's &lt;a href=\"health\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; bar. Generally, offensive rune abilities generate 10 runic power per rune required to use that ability. Additionally, the &lt;a href=\"Empower%20Rune%20Weapon\"&gt;Empower Rune Weapon&lt;/a&gt; generate runic power without costing runes. Death knights can hold a maximum 100 runic power. As with rage, runic power gradually diminishes when not in combat.\nOrigin and idea.\nDevelopers stated at &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon%202007\"&gt;BlizzCon 2007&lt;/a&gt; that they didn't want the new class to use the traditional resource systems because they wanted the death knight to have a different style of play. They stated their intention was for the death knight to use a mixture of spells \"and\" melee in close combat. Because of this, a system that didn't specifically rely on either mana or rage was more appropriate. In early design, the Death Knight was intended to be able to customize how many runes of each type they wished to have in their 6 rune slots. This was eventually removed and replaced with the two-of-each-type system due to concerns about balance and complexity.\nThis is how the original icons looked: \nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Worldwide%20Invitational%202008\"&gt;2008 Worldwide Invitational&lt;/a&gt;, it was noted that the original runes were replaced because they were too complex to show them refreshing inside the character's portrait bar.\nThis is how the replacement icons looked: "}

They are particularly wielded by &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s, but they are not unique to the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. Notably, &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; are known to forge rune-etched blades as well, such as &lt;a href=\"%3AFelo%27melorn\"&gt;:Felo'melorn&lt;/a&gt;, the sword of the &lt;a href=\"Sunstrider\"&gt;Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; dynasty. By the time of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, runeblades were not unheard of, but they were considered extremely rare and terribly powerful weapons.\nNecromantic runeblades.\nOrigins.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Primus\"&gt;Primus&lt;/a&gt; is responsible for the creation of &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxi\"&gt;Maldraxxi&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"rune%20magic\"&gt;rune magic&lt;/a&gt;, which serves to manipulate necromantic energy, and its more powerful counterpart, &lt;a href=\"Domination\"&gt;Domination&lt;/a&gt;, whose purpose is the suppression of another. All &lt;a href=\"Necrolord%20Covenant\"&gt;necrolords&lt;/a&gt; receive a portion of the Primus' power in order to carry out their duty of defending the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt; from external forces. He devised a unique language of runes which individually represent a specific word tied to the foundations of &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxus\"&gt;Maldraxxus&lt;/a&gt; and the power of the five houses. Eons later, this same language would come to be used in the world of the living by &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;ian &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s to empower their &lt;a href=\"runeblade\"&gt;runeblade&lt;/a&gt;s with &lt;a href=\"%3Aruneforging\"&gt;:runeforging&lt;/a&gt;. Maldraxxi runeblades are empowered by &lt;a href=\"anima\"&gt;anima&lt;/a&gt; from souls, whether willing or forcibly taken, and can have souls forged into the blades themselves.\nMourneblades.\nMourneblades are a special type of incredibly powerful runeblades associated with the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"the%20Jailer\"&gt;the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;. They are engraved with &lt;a href=\"Domination\"&gt;Domination&lt;/a&gt; runes, and are capable of shattering &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;s into fragments when wielded with rage. Several mourneblades were created by the &lt;a href=\"Primus\"&gt;Primus&lt;/a&gt;; the greatest of these was the dreaded &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt;, the weapon of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;. It was capable of consuming &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;s (and presumably \"essences of a similar nature\"), of shattering any blade it met with in combat, and even displayed some form of intelligence. As the sword of &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; it became the most famous of the runeblades, and probably the most unique.\nIn order to Dominate &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, the Jailer reforged Anduin's sword &lt;a href=\"Shalamayne\"&gt;Shalamayne&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"Kingsmourne\"&gt;Kingsmourne&lt;/a&gt;, a mourneblade that was even greater than Frostmourne and infused with Arthas Menethil's soul. Similar to Frostmourne's ability to steal souls, the Dominated Anduin used Kingsmourne to steal the &lt;a href=\"sigil\"&gt;sigil&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Ones\"&gt;Eternal Ones&lt;/a&gt;.\nDistant past.\n&lt;a href=\"Apocalypse\"&gt;Apocalypse&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Maw%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Maw of the Damned&lt;/a&gt; were dangerous weapons forged by the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; in order to spread chaos and death. The former was created by the &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt; after their exile from &lt;a href=\"Revendreth\"&gt;Revendreth&lt;/a&gt;.\nThird War.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Death%20knight%23Fallen%20Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;fallen knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; were bestowed black, &lt;a href=\"vampiric\"&gt;vampiric&lt;/a&gt; runeblades by the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; himself to serve as his mightiest &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt; generals during the Third War.\n&lt;a href=\"Marduk%20Blackpool\"&gt;Marduk Blackpool&lt;/a&gt;, a death knight of the Scourge who fought during the war, had his runeblade shattered and yet continued to operate, although he may have kept its &lt;a href=\"Ebon%20Hilt%20of%20Marduk\"&gt;hilt&lt;/a&gt;.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nUnder the directions of &lt;a href=\"Instructor%20Razuvious\"&gt;Instructor Razuvious&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Death%20knight%23The%20Death%20Knights%20of%20Acherus\"&gt;death knights of Acherus&lt;/a&gt; forged their own runeblades shortly after their creation by learning of &lt;a href=\"runeforging\"&gt;runeforging&lt;/a&gt;. The Instructor warns that no death knight may battle without a runeblade, for it is the vessel that stores &lt;a href=\"Rune%20system\"&gt;runic power&lt;/a&gt; and the instrument by which a death knight commands the powers of &lt;a href=\"Death%20Knight%23Frost\"&gt;frost&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Death%20Knight%23blood\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Death%20knight%23Unholy\"&gt;unholy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Blaumeux\"&gt;Lady Blaumeux&lt;/a&gt; further highlights the crucial importance of the runeblade, noting that it is perhaps the most guarded treasure in a death knight's possession and that a death knight separated from their runeblade is weak and powerless.\nIn the RPG.\nThe vampiric runeblades are empathic weapons given to new death knights by the Lich King &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; or one of his designates to turn them into death knights. Once the runeblade is used to turn a hero into a death knight, it becomes that knight's personal weapon and is slowly charged with the life energies of those injured and slain thereafter.\nDeath knights are now few and far between, but their legacy lives on. The runeblade is one example of their terrible power. It channels life force, which bestows a kind of life upon the blade itself. Though not very intelligent, the runeblade has a strong survival instinct.\nWhen a death knight who owns a runeblade is destroyed, the sword dampens its powers, taking on the appearance of a nondescript magical weapon. It uses its empathic powers to manipulate its next owner \u2014 encouraging feelings of possession and anger, discouraging kindness and altruism. Once it gains enough control over its owner, it encourages him to seek out the secret places where death knights still dwell. Only then can the runeblade accomplish its goal of gaining a new master."}

Using &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Ash\"&gt;Soul Ash&lt;/a&gt;, this master smith can help the &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Walker\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt;s craft powerful pieces of equipment.\nThe Runecarver was imprisoned in Torghast long ago and no longer remembers his life before he was a prisoner. His designs were extracted from him and used for the &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt; army.

After defending against the Jailer's attack on the Runecarver's Oubliette, the Primus left an echo of his Runecarver form to aid other Maw Walkers and left for &lt;a href=\"Korthia\"&gt;Korthia&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuests.\nAfter reaching max level, choosing a &lt;a href=\"covenant\"&gt;covenant&lt;/a&gt;, and completing the first chapter of the covenant campaign, players are directed to Torghast. There, they will discover a mysterious key that unlocks the way to the Runecarver. Once players manage to release one of the Runecarver's hands, players are granted the ability to craft Shadowlands legendaries.\nLegendary crafting.\nTo craft a legendary, players will need a base item from one of the production professions (&lt;a href=\"Tailoring\"&gt;Tailoring&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Leatherworking\"&gt;Leatherworking&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blacksmithing\"&gt;Blacksmithing&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Jewelcrafting\"&gt;Jewelcrafting&lt;/a&gt;), two missives crafted with &lt;a href=\"Inscription\"&gt;Inscription&lt;/a&gt;, Soul Ash, and a memory of the Runecarver legendary recipe, which is unlocked by completing other objectives in the game (raids, PvP, mythic dungeons, etc).\nBase items.\nPlayers who have &lt;a href=\"Tailoring\"&gt;Tailoring&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Leatherworking\"&gt;Leatherworking&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blacksmithing\"&gt;Blacksmithing&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Jewelcrafting\"&gt;Jewelcrafting&lt;/a&gt; as one of their primary professions will unlock the recipes for base items by playing max-level content. The crafted items are not &lt;a href=\"soulbound\"&gt;soulbound&lt;/a&gt;, and can be traded or sold on the &lt;a href=\"Auction%20House\"&gt;Auction House&lt;/a&gt; to other players.\nBase items start at item level 190 and have four ranks, up to item level 235. Crafters can produce base items for all eight armor slots, as well as necklaces and rings. As players repeat crafts they will unlock higher ranks of the item, which require the same ingredients, but more of them.\nMissives.\n&lt;a href=\"Inscription\"&gt;Scribes&lt;/a&gt; create missives, which define which stats the final legendary will have. Two different missives are required to craft a legendary:\nMaterials.\nLegendaries start at item level 190 (rank 1), which requires 1250 &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Ash\"&gt;Soul Ash&lt;/a&gt;, and scale up to item level 235, which requires 5150. &lt;a href=\"Patch%209.1\"&gt;Patch 9.1&lt;/a&gt; adds the 249 and 262 item level upgrades, which require &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Cinders\"&gt;Soul Cinders&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Patch%209.2\"&gt;Patch 9.2&lt;/a&gt; adds a final 291 upgrade, which requires &lt;a href=\"Cosmic%20Flux\"&gt;Cosmic Flux&lt;/a&gt;.\nSoul Ash and Soul Cinders are obtained by completing Layers of &lt;a href=\"Torghast%2C%20Tower%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Torghast, Tower of the Damned&lt;/a&gt;. The amount of soul ash and soul cinders awarded by each layer is cumulative, so there is no benefit in running trivial layers. For instance, defeating a boss on layer 4 will award 375 Soul Ash. As of &lt;a href=\"patch%209.1.5\"&gt;patch 9.1.5&lt;/a&gt; there is no limit to how much can be earned. Cosmic Flux cannot be obtained in Torghast, and is instead found in &lt;a href=\"Zereth%20Mortis\"&gt;Zereth Mortis&lt;/a&gt;. It is also possible to purchase packs of 5150 Soul Ash and 1650 Soul Cinders for 3000 Cosmic Flux (allowing one to craft a Rank 7 legendary for a total of 5000 Cosmic Flux).\nUpgrades.\nTo upgrade legendaries to a higher rank, return with a higher-rank base item and the requisite amount of soul ash and soul cinders. For instance, to upgrade to rank 3 from rank 2, 1200 Soul Ash is required.\nLegendary powers.\nPlayers will be able to loot Memories of the Runecarver after they first unlock the Runecarver in &lt;a href=\"The%20Weak%20Link\"&gt;The Weak Link&lt;/a&gt;, which awards the achievement &lt;a href=\"The%20Forgotten%20One\"&gt;The Forgotten One&lt;/a&gt;.

According to &lt;a href=\"Johnathan%20Staats\"&gt;John Staats&lt;/a&gt;, runemasters were replaced by &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s, while according to &lt;a href=\"Kevin%20Jordan\"&gt;Kevin Jordan&lt;/a&gt; they were replaced by &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s in the role of a \"freak class\" that differed from standard RPG tropes.\nWhen the designers were discussing what the new &lt;a href=\"hero%20class\"&gt;hero class&lt;/a&gt; in \"\" would be, the runemaster was again brought up as a possibility. It was envisioned as a &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt;- or &lt;a href=\"monk\"&gt;monk&lt;/a&gt;-type melee class who wrote runes on their bodies to give them different physical powers. The runemaster was eventually merged into the &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt; (along with the &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt;) and later with the monk.\nIdeas from the runemaster when it was the potential tenth class from before \"World of Warcraft\" came out were pulled into the death knight with runes, that went into the &lt;a href=\"Runeblade\"&gt;Runeblade&lt;/a&gt;, went into the runes on the ground, &lt;a href=\"Anti-Magic%20Zone\"&gt;Anti-Magic Zone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Anti-Magic%20Shell\"&gt;Anti-Magic Shell&lt;/a&gt; used some of those rune-type effects.\nIn the RPG.\nRunemasters are &lt;a href=\"monk\"&gt;monk&lt;/a&gt;-like arcane spellcaster and melee fighters who empower themselves with magical energies by inscribing runes onto their bodies. The runemaster is a free spirit, more at home in the wild than in the city. The runemaster is a mystic who sees the power of ley lines. Moreover, those who study runes understand that these are not simply symbols of power - they are the power. The runemaster seeks to become one with the land, but not in the fashion of druids. Rather, the runemaster desires to become a microcosm of the land, seeking to overlay his body with runes in the same fashion that the land itself is overlaid with patterns of ley lines.\nHe merges brute strength with arcane magic, covering his body with mystic tattoos and often imbuing them with magical energies to increase his skill in hand-to-hand combat. While a runemaster shuns armor, this is more to prevent hindrances to inscribing his runes than to demonstrate his subtlety and finesse with unarmed strikes. Quite to the contrary, a runemaster prefers to get in the face of his enemies. Using little trickery or subterfuge, the runemaster takes down foes with toe-to-toe, all-out assaults, hammering them with tattooed fists and feet brimming with arcane power. Runic magic is considered primitive yet complex by most other races. The dwarves have taken to it with deft skill, while the tauren study it more slowly.\nRunemasters fill many roles. They are adept melee combatants. They possess runes to enhance themselves and their allies, as well as to ward certain areas and otherwise make life difficult for their opponents. The most experienced runemasters become &lt;a href=\"epic%20runemaster\"&gt;epic runemaster&lt;/a&gt;s. Others may be &lt;a href=\"lone%20wolf%20runemaster\"&gt;lone wolf runemaster&lt;/a&gt;s.\nHistory.\nThe traditions of the runemasters date back to the ancient time of the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s, creators of runic magic. Their creation, the &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt;, quickly mastered the mysteries of the runes taught to them. However, as generations passed, the dwarves forgot their heritage and lost all knowledge of runes and their hereditary powers.\n&lt;a href=\"Tauren\"&gt;Tauren&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; rediscovered the power of runes. An ancient race as well, the tauren remembered the myths of runecasting and revived interest in this nearly lost art. The dwarves that came to Kalimdor with &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;'s Alliance Expedition learned tauren runecasting techniques. Tauren and dwarves do not share good relations, but they were eager to share knowledge of runes and titan myths.\nEpic runemaster.\nThe epic runemaster is a wild, untamed creature of immense might. Their skin is covered with strange designs that spit glowing power and make them cackle with an otherworldly aura. Their marks can transform the lowliest &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt; into a skilled &lt;a href=\"fighter\"&gt;fighter&lt;/a&gt;; when their marks are applied to themselves, they become a truly awesome sight. This increases their fighting abilities, as well as bolstering their &lt;a href=\"rune\"&gt;runic&lt;/a&gt; powers. They leave diplomacy to the &lt;a href=\"paladins\"&gt;paladins&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"rogues\"&gt;rogues&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Strength\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt;, constitution, and &lt;a href=\"intelligence\"&gt;intelligence&lt;/a&gt; are important to the runemaster; they increase intelligence to bolster their rune scribing, and boost strength and/or constitution to improve their ability to dish out and take damage.\nAppearance.\nMost runemasters are heavily tattooed with runic patterns - not simply the unique ones that form the basis for rune families, but the so-called \"simple runes\" as well. Simple runes mimic patterns of ley energy that appear, again and again, in the environment. These patterns occur in nature and are responsible for things such as the strength of a given type of stone, the ferocity of a given windstorm and the coolness of a given stream; when a runemaster uses these patterns, he learns to channel his power into them at all times, attaining similar traits.\nRunemasters are proficient with simple weapons, but not with any type of armor or shield. Armor of any type interferes with a runemaster\u2019s movements, which can cause his empowerments with somatic components to fail.\nPowers.\nA runemaster has the ability to scribe and empower &lt;a href=\"runes\"&gt;runes&lt;/a&gt;. A runemaster does not prepare spells the way other arcane spellcasters do. Rather, a runemaster has a certain number of rune patterns that he simply knows, and he may empower any rune within those patterns. To scribe and empower a rune, the runemaster must have a high Spirit.\nA runemaster can create any rune he knows at any time. He does not have to decide ahead of time which runes he will create, nor does he need to prepare anything in advance. To inscribe a rune, a runemaster must have a high intelligence. The runemaster can sense the presence of runes in his vicinity, a runemaster gains an intuitive sense that alerts him to danger from runes. A runemaster's marks can be made permanent.A creature can have only few magic tattoos. To replace a magic tattoo, the creature must first have an old one erased. The runemaster bears simple runes (see below) on his knuckles.\nThe runes that make up the runic patterns are powerful and unique, based upon patterns of &lt;a href=\"ley%20line\"&gt;ley-line&lt;/a&gt; energy found nowhere else in all of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. These are not the only such patterns in nature, however. There are patterns that are not unique, but are found over and over in certain dynamic situations in nature. These repeating patterns are the basis for simple runes: sets of runes that only runemasters may use.\nSimple runes are tattooed to the skin of the runemaster. It isn\u2019t enough that the pattern be there \u2014 rather, the runemaster must understand how his own energy is like that of the ley line energy of the world around him, so that he can empower the pattern instinctively. Simple runes flicker with suppressed energy until the runemaster needs their power, then they blaze with brilliant potency. Simple runes radiate faint magic of no specific school.\nA runemaster begins with a single simple rune. As his understanding of the runes grows, he can add others.\nAffiliation.\nRunemasters may be found in either the Horde or the Alliance. Thought the arts of the runemaster originated among the ancient tauren, these techniques have been adopted by many races. After the tauren, dwarves are the most likely to practice the runemaster's art, with night elves, orcs and trolls making up a small population as well. Rare is the human runemaster, and dwarven mentors teach almost all of them. Many runemasters, particularly those whose studies of natural runic patterns take them away from the centers of civilization, end up taking a neutral stance."}

They have long served as companions to the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Fae\"&gt;Night Fae&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nCalm and enduring, the majestic runestags of Ardenweald can siphon &lt;a href=\"anima\"&gt;anima&lt;/a&gt; from the ambient light of the forest with their elaborate antlers. The anima is used as nourishment and to power the runestag's speed and magic. In combat, runestags can use anima to heal themselves and damage attacking predators.\nThose who have pledged their service to the &lt;a href=\"Winter%20Queen\"&gt;Winter Queen&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Night\"&gt;Court of Night&lt;/a&gt; are granted runestag mounts.

The stags display a range of emotions, reflecting the spirits' dreams or nightmares, and they fiercely protect the groves where the wildseeds lie. When the groves began to fail during the anima drought, many runestags went berserk.\n\"Winterborn runestags\" are blessed by the Winter Queen herself. They can warn their herds of predators by the flaring of their runes. They serve as the Winter Queen's own favored mounts, and she only bestows them on her most favored subjects."}

The arcanists decided to create a protective barrier named \"&lt;a href=\"Ban%27dinoriel\"&gt;Ban'dinoriel&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"the Gatekeeper\") around the land, which would prevent others from detecting their magic, frighten away their superstitious &lt;a href=\"Amani%20Empire\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt; rivals, and weaken the magic of all non-elves within it. Over several decades, the arcanists built a series of monolithic Runestones around the borders of Quel'Thalas to mark the boundaries of the barrier. The Runestones were powered by the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt; and linked to the mother tree &lt;a href=\"Thas%27alah\"&gt;Thas'alah&lt;/a&gt;, tying the power of the tree's &lt;a href=\"nature%20magic\"&gt;nature magic&lt;/a&gt; to the elves' arcane spells.\nSecond War.\nOriginal ' description of the runestone at &lt;a href=\"Caer%20Darrow\"&gt;Caer Darrow&lt;/a&gt;: The runestone was an ancient monolith erected by the &lt;a href=\"elven%20druid\"&gt;elven druid&lt;/a&gt;s and inscribed with powerful runes of protection and warding. The runestone, seized by &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s, was eventually hewn into slates that were then used to construct the &lt;a href=\"Altar%20of%20Storms\"&gt;Altars of Storms&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;elves&lt;/a&gt;, knowing that their sacred artifact had been defiled to create the &lt;a href=\"Ogre%20mage\"&gt;ogre-magi&lt;/a&gt;, had sworn to destroy all of the unholy Altars across the kingdom.\nThe original story about elven druids was later changed so that it was &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s who had placed them instead. The description was also broadened when it was said that diabolical orcish &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt;s had found a way to dismantle and draw energy from several runestones instead of just Gul'dan and one runestone.\nGul'dan himself speculated that the high elves had used enslaved &lt;a href=\"Forest%20troll\"&gt;trolls&lt;/a&gt; to physically move the stones into place, similarly to how he used ogre slaves to destroy them and build the altars, but this remains unconfirmed.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"burning%20of%20Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;burning of Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, Gul'dan intended to use the power of the &lt;a href=\"Altar%20of%20Storms\"&gt;Altars of Storms&lt;/a&gt; to break through &lt;a href=\"Ban%27dinoriel\"&gt;Ban'dinoriel&lt;/a&gt;'s protection. As the Altars were crafted from the elves' own runestones, which were originally powered by the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; thought to use that link in reverse, sending his own magic into their power source and either destroying it or wresting it away from them.\nThough it was never mentioned again and probably &lt;a href=\"retcon\"&gt;retcon&lt;/a&gt;ned, a &lt;a href=\"Dalaran%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; expedition sent to the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;invasion of Draenor&lt;/a&gt; used two runestones along its entrance to protect it from &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThird War.\nFive runestones were shown on a map of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; in the but were later omitted in the game's loading screens.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nThe remaining runestones are used to protect &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. Most of them were destroyed or lost after the attack on the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Runewarden%20Deryan\"&gt;Runewarden Deryan&lt;/a&gt; re-energizes and maintains the remaining runestones in &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;.\nRunestones as items.\nThese items appear to have no relation to the elven runestones described above.\nIn the RPG.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; founded &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, they erected monolithic runestones to mark their new kingdom's borders. These enchanted monuments created a magical barrier that prevented the savage &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;forest troll&lt;/a&gt;s from penetrating the elven lands. The barrier was not used for millennia, but the runestones, untouched by fire and blade, remained."}

Millennia later, when the &lt;a href=\"djaradin\"&gt;djaradin&lt;/a&gt; captured the Obsidian Citadel, they looted fragments from the stone and dispersed them in the vaults beneath the Citadel.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sabellian\"&gt;Sabellian&lt;/a&gt;'s assault on the Obsidian Citadel, Wrathion wanted to activate the oathstone to restore his flight's power and signal their return to the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;, only to find the stone cracked. &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s retrieved the scattered fragments with &lt;a href=\"Archivist%20Edress\"&gt;Archivist Edress&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Scalecommander%20Emberthal\"&gt;Scalecommander Emberthal&lt;/a&gt;, after which &lt;a href=\"Forgemaster%20Bazenthus\"&gt;Forgemaster Bazenthus&lt;/a&gt; used the &lt;a href=\"Earth-Warder%27s%20Forge\"&gt;Earth-Warder's Forge&lt;/a&gt; and Wrathion's own flame breath to reform them. Wrathion then placed the reformed fragments back on the stone, repairing and re-empowering it."}

They used to live in &lt;a href=\"Dragonbane%20Keep\"&gt;Dragonbane Keep&lt;/a&gt;, but when the &lt;a href=\"djaradin\"&gt;djaradin&lt;/a&gt; resurfaced they stole their home from them. The Outcasts resolved to take their home back, and to that end conduct &lt;a href=\"Siege%20on%20Dragonbane%20Keep\"&gt;sieges&lt;/a&gt;. They periodically reclaim the keep, holding onto it and making it safe for their allies to traverse; though the djaradin tend to re-take the area, only for the Outcasts to re-group and siege it again.\nHistory.\nWhen the Dragons left, the remaining &lt;a href=\"dragonspawn\"&gt;dragonspawn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"drakonid\"&gt;drakonid&lt;/a&gt;s were isolated; feeling shunned by the aspects. Visiting the &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Citadel\"&gt;Obsidian Citadel&lt;/a&gt; was declared taboo in the absence of the dragons, but &lt;a href=\"Boss%20%28drakonid%29\"&gt;Boss&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ribbit\"&gt;Ribbit&lt;/a&gt; wanted to understand the history and heritage of the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;. They settled in Dragonbane Keep, taking in society's outcasts and making money from odd jobs. When the djaradin awoke, they immediately assailed the keep; taking it from the outcasts and kicking them out of their home. Ribbit claims that most of the outcasts don't care what &lt;a href=\"Sabellian\"&gt;Sabellian&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt; want for the flight; they just want their home back.\nThe outcasts claim to not care about one's past, and as a result, they take on new names when joining the organization. They do not care if the person was previously a rebel or a hero, the name they get is given to them by their crew that they work with. Once a name is given to that person, their past is considered nothing more than a dead name on a distant wind.\nRibbit was given their name by &lt;a href=\"Two-Eye\"&gt;Two-Eye&lt;/a&gt;, as they thought it would be amusing to make them into a &lt;a href=\"hornswog\"&gt;hornswog&lt;/a&gt;; however, at the time the name Croaker was taken."}

Raiders may choose to kill all three drakes or leave some combination of them alive. Completing the encounter with one or more drakes up increases both the difficulty and the quality of loot that drops.\nA 10 and 25-player version of this raid exists.\nHistory.\nMore than ten thousand years ago, the black &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspect\"&gt;Dragon Aspect&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Neltharion\"&gt;Neltharion&lt;/a&gt;, began a quest to reign supreme over his fellow dragons and thereby dominate Azeroth. Before Deathwing -- as Neltharion came to be known -- could achieve his goal, the other Aspects drove him into hiding, but the rest of the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; continued his foul work. Hated and hunted for its evil deeds, the black flight dwindled, and at first Deathwing schemed to bolster its ranks. In time, however, his agents began experimenting with other dragonflights to create a new and mightier breed of dragon. The resulting experiments gave rise to a powerful and terrifying new breed: the &lt;a href=\"twilight%20dragon\"&gt;twilight dragon&lt;/a&gt;s. These malefic dragons were believed to be destroyed after an attack on &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;, but a new clutch of twilight eggs was recently discovered within the Obsidian Sanctum, the black dragonflight's domain in the Chamber of the Aspects. Now Azeroth's heroes must destroy the brood once and for all and prevent the dark future that has been set into motion.\nIn the wake of the &lt;a href=\"Nexus%20War\"&gt;Nexus War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; tasked her children with rooting out any danger and treachery within the &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Accord\"&gt;Wyrmrest Accord&lt;/a&gt;. They quickly located a clutch of &lt;a href=\"twilight%20dragon\"&gt;twilight dragon&lt;/a&gt; eggs within the Obsidian Sanctum. With their resources already strained in dealing with the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, Alexstrasza's consort, &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Korialstrasz&lt;/a&gt;, has sent word of the eggs to &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Six\"&gt;Council of Six&lt;/a&gt; in the hopes that able-bodied adventurers can enter the sanctum and destroy the twisted progeny of &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the assault, the black dragonflight then attacked the &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Sanctum\"&gt;Ruby Sanctum&lt;/a&gt; and destroyed it in retaliation."}

Nothing can prepare the enemy for what this unfathomable statue could become. Attacks land and air units.\nInformation.\nThe Obsidian Statue is a useful support unit, possessing a fairly high mana pool and comes with two spells; Essence of Blight and Spirit Touch, which restores health and mana respectively. Undead players not intending to make &lt;a href=\"Destroyer%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Destroyer&lt;/a&gt;s should only have two or three Obsidian Statues, one set for healing, the other for mana, and a last one as a reserve if one of them gets targeted. The Obsidian Statue allows Undead players to quickly heal in a pinch without having to rely on blighted ground or fountains to restore health.\nOnce the Destroyer Form technology is unlocked, Obsidian Statues may be morphed into Destroyers for an additional 100 gold, 50 wood and 2 food. This change is permanent, and cannot be undone.\nSpells and abilities.\nEssence of Blight.\nThis spell allows players to use Unholy Frenzy without suffering from its damage effects, as it will outheal the damage dealt by the spell.\nSpirit Touch.\nExtremely useful for &lt;a href=\"Necromancer%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Banshee&lt;/a&gt;s, allowing them to top off their mana for a battle. If Destroyers are in use, make sure to keep the spell off auto-cast outside of major battles since the Obsidian Statue will attempt to restore its mana, but fail because of the Destroyer's negative mana regen."}

The tol'vir were created to maintain titan lore repositories and titan machinery surrounding the titan cities of &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Uldum\"&gt;Uldum&lt;/a&gt;. Not long after the &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"empire\"&gt;empire&lt;/a&gt;s divided the insectoid kingdom of the &lt;a href=\"aqir\"&gt;aqir&lt;/a&gt;, the aqir that traveled north discovered and overthrew the tol'vir dwelling in a titan facility in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. These aqir would eventually become the race we know as the &lt;a href=\"nerubian\"&gt;nerubian&lt;/a&gt;s today, having adapted the tol'vir's architecture for their own purposes. Similarly, the aqir that traveled south ransacked and overthrew a titan research station near &lt;a href=\"Uldum\"&gt;Uldum&lt;/a&gt;, renaming themselves the &lt;a href=\"qiraji\"&gt;qiraji&lt;/a&gt; and calling their new home &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe obsidian destroyers of Azjol-Nerub.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; eventually consumed the nerubian empire and threw its few remaining tol'vir slaves into the front lines. Now known as &lt;a href=\"obsidian%20statue\"&gt;obsidian statue&lt;/a&gt;s, the tol'vir were often used as figureheads at the forefront of many undead armies after the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, inspiring awe and fear in the enemy ranks. Obsidian Statues, however, were also able to break free of the obsidian stone that held them and fly into battle, swallowing magic to feed their insatiable hunger as they moved between battles and rained destruction down upon their foes. Although many of the few remaining tol'vir slaves died in the front lines, it's possible that more tol'vir still exist deep within the remnants of Azjol-Nerub.\nThe obsidian destroyers of Ahn'Qiraj.\nThe combined forces of the night elves had proven themselves a formidable enemy to the &lt;a href=\"qiraji\"&gt;qiraji&lt;/a&gt;, but during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Shifting%20Sands\"&gt;War of the Shifting Sands&lt;/a&gt; it was the &lt;a href=\"bronze%20dragonflight\"&gt;bronze dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; that first taught the insect race the meaning of fear. As the dragons slaughtered wave after wave of silithid, losing few of their own in the process, the &lt;a href=\"Twin%20Emperors\"&gt;Twin Emperors&lt;/a&gt; realized their forces were ill-equipped to deal with such powerful creatures of magic. To combat this shortcoming, Emperor &lt;a href=\"Vek%27lor\"&gt;Vek'lor&lt;/a&gt; focused his efforts on designing a mechanism capable of fighting the ancient wyrms. These preliminary efforts, however, were wrought with failure. Aided by whisperings from his &lt;a href=\"C%27Thun\"&gt;ancient master&lt;/a&gt;, Vek'lor pressed on and developed a new kind of construct. Though pleased with his progress, even the qiraji emperor could not guess what dark purpose lay in store for the machines. To Vek'lor's surprise, his inert creations were quickly imbued with limited sapience by his shadowy overseer, as well as a mysterious power \u2014 the ability to drain the magical energies of living creatures. In addition, these energies could be stored and then released in a tremendous burst of incendiary &lt;a href=\"mana\"&gt;mana&lt;/a&gt;, making Vek'lor's latest creations among the deadliest in the qiraji arsenal. The first destroyers proved extremely effective; the dragons were not accustomed to fighting enemies that were capable of retaliating from a distance, and they never found an effective way to counter the mana-draining powers of these obsidian statues. And so &lt;a href=\"Anachronos\"&gt;Anachronos&lt;/a&gt;, child of &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt;, sought the aid of the remaining dragonflights and history tells us that the qiraji were sealed behind the &lt;a href=\"Scarab%20Wall\"&gt;Scarab Wall&lt;/a&gt; shortly thereafter. Those dragons who survived the war still dread the return of these magic-stealing monstrosities.\nThough the wall prevented the &lt;a href=\"qiraji\"&gt;qiraji&lt;/a&gt; from venturing out, the insect empire refused to remain idle. In preparation for their reemergence in the world, &lt;a href=\"C%27Thun\"&gt;the shadowy master of Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt; commanded Emperor Vek'lor to create a new obsidian statue superior to all other Destroyers. Emperor Vek'lor named the finished construct &lt;a href=\"Moam\"&gt;Moam&lt;/a&gt;, and observed as the dark master infused it with life. He was pleased and surprised to find that the improved Obsidian Destroyer was far more versatile than its earlier counterparts.\nThe obsidian destroyers of the Black Empire.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt; was freed from his prison, the &lt;a href=\"aqir\"&gt;aqir&lt;/a&gt; awoke in the deserts of southern Kalimdor. Aqiri prophets began constructing new obsidian destroyers and awakening and corrupting dormant ones to help their forces' efforts to merge &lt;a href=\"Ny%27alotha\"&gt;Ny'alotha&lt;/a&gt; with Azeroth, thus bringing back the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Empire\"&gt;Black Empire&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nAn obsidian destroyer is a creature made out of obsidian. It has the lower body resembling a powerfully built panther with a pair of great black wings protruding from its back. Almost twenty feet wide, these latter appendages appear carved from old, porous stone. The creature's upper body is humanoid. A pair of dazzling emerald eyes set within deep, cavernous sockets stand out in the midst of the creature's shriveled, skeletal face.\nBorn from the mystical transformation of an &lt;a href=\"obsidian%20statue\"&gt;obsidian statue&lt;/a&gt;, this strange &lt;a href=\"Racial%20terminology%23Magical%20Beasts\"&gt;magical beast&lt;/a&gt; is drawn to &lt;a href=\"mana\"&gt;mana&lt;/a&gt;. Because of its appearance, an unmoving obsidian destroyer can easily pass itself off as a statue as long as it keeps its eyes closed. It can thus fool people into believing it is nothing more than a harmless piece of decoration. Most obsidian destroyers enjoy wearing crowns and other ostentatious headdresses that make them appear regal. An obsidian destroyer almost always has see invisibility active. Since it can always see the auras of spells and magic items as its enemies approach, the creature makes good use of its greater dispel magic ability, frequently using it on a target as its first offensive action. Though not a graceful flyer, an obsidian destroyer attacks from the air, targeting the weakest-looking opponents first. Once engaged in melee, it takes full advantage of its thunder strike ability. If its enemies flee before it gets a kill, an obsidian destroyer pursues the slowest target relentlessly until it renders him helpless.\nSome obsidian destroyers have the body of a six-legged winged horse. These obsidian destroyers have the lower body like a powerfully-built horse, with a pair of great black wings. Its upper body is &lt;a href=\"humanoid\"&gt;humanoid&lt;/a&gt; with a shriveled, &lt;a href=\"lich\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt;-like face containing lion characteristics. It wields a pair of unusual ebon morningstars in its foremost limbs. They are specially made out of obsidian. The flesh of an obsidian destroyer has the appearance of obsidian, hence its name. When an obsidian destroyer stands still, it fools people into believing it is nothing more than a &lt;a href=\"obsidian%20statue\"&gt;large statue&lt;/a&gt;. An obsidian destroyer enjoys wearing crowns and other ostentatious headdresses. Though not a precise flyer, an obsidian destroyer attacks from the air when possible.\nThey are simply classified as large magical beasts and large constructs."}

Carved out of the dark stone from which it takes its name, an obsidian statue has eerie, green eyes that shine brightly within deep sockets. Undead armies use obsidian statues as figureheads, placing them at the forefront of battle or near strategically important locales, such as armories or headquarters. They inspire awe in the hearts of their enemies, but more importantly they provide useful support to their undead masters. Obsidian statues fight without thought or tactic, using their mystic blasts to pummel those foes close to them. They hate living beings and strike at any living creature that comes within range. Obsidian statues never engage undead in battle unless they are directly threatened by them. Obsidian statues do not speak."}

Similar to &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20Archavon\"&gt;Vault of Archavon&lt;/a&gt;, only the winning faction of &lt;a href=\"Tol%20Barad\"&gt;Tol Barad&lt;/a&gt; has access to this boss. \nBackground.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"This ravenous demon broke free of its cage and gained access to the western wing of the prison, devouring all the inmates held there. Occu'thar's gluttony resulted in a body too bloated to escape its environs, effectively turning the prison wing into its new holding cell.\"\nPost Cataclysm.\nIt was originally one of the worst inmates. It had eyes everywhere and could conjure them at will. Eventually, it was killed.\nStrategy.\nManaging Searing Shadows.\nSearing Shadows is periodically cast on the tank. It does significant damage to the tank, so the tank should be willing to spend a short-cooldown defensive ability when he sees the casting bar. The second tank needs to taunt off the tank suffering from Searing Shadows before the next Searing Shadows is cast. A tank who gets blasted by Searing Shadows while still suffering the +100%-damage-taken debuff from the previous Searing Shadows blast will probably die without using a major defensive cooldown and massive healing. \nThat said, the other tank doesn't need to taunt immediately. The most common reason to delay the taunt is if the spare tank is suffering from Eyes of Occu'thar and needs to group up for the AoE.\nManaging Focused Fire and Eyes of Occu'thar.\nOccu'thar alternates between Focused Fire (creates a puddle of pain and doom) and Eyes of Occu'thar (creates an eye-bomb on each player who is not the current tank).\nTactic 1: All the DPS forms a single pile. When Focused Fire is cast they all run to a designated second location and wait for Eyes to spawn. AoE down the eyes. When the Focused Fire is cast again, return to the first location. Alternate throughout the raid. This tactic has the drawback that the entire raid is taking damage while they evacuate the Focused Fire puddle.\nTactic 2: A location is designated for Eye AoE (common choices are a &lt;a href=\"Raid%20Beacon\"&gt;Raid Beacon&lt;/a&gt; or just \"on the butt\"). DPS splits into two piles who stand clear of the Eye killing zone. You want to prevent the Focused Fire puddle from overlapping with the Eye killing zone (The puddle has a radius of 12 yards, so be at least that far away). When Focused Fire is cast, group in the Eye killing zone. Wait for Eyes to spawn. Kill Eyes. Split up into Focused Fire piles again. This tactic has the drawback that inattentive players can cause the Focused Fire puddle to overlap the Eye killing zone.\nTactic 3: Designate specific player as the Eye gathering point (possibly using a &lt;a href=\"Raid%20target%20icon\"&gt;Raid target icon&lt;/a&gt;). All DPS spread out and stay out of Focused Fire. When Focused Fire is cast get out of the puddle, then group up on the designated player and wait for Eyes to spawn. AoE down the Eyes. Spread out and repeat. This tactic can break down if the designated player dies. It also makes AoE healing ineffective.\nIf the inactive tank gets an Eye, he must group up with DPS and delay taunting until the Eye is destroyed. As long as he taunts off the active tank before the active tank suffers a second Searing Shadows, the raid will be fine.\nLoot.\nThe loot is randomly chosen from:\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;\nSpeculation.\nHe may be related to &lt;a href=\"Occul%27tharon\"&gt;Occul'tharon&lt;/a&gt;."}

Andre responded that he couldn't return to his flight until his old Oceanmane friend returned from his hunt, even though it was clear that the tauren brave wouldn't return. Zekhan promised Andre to visit him soon.\nHow to get there.\nThis area was (and the cave still is) reachable by swimming west from &lt;a href=\"Land%27s%20End%20Beach\"&gt;Land's End Beach&lt;/a&gt; and past Silithus. You can also swim south from the western corner of &lt;a href=\"Feralas\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt;. At normal speed, this can take over ten minutes swimming. To speed this up, you could either find a friendly &lt;a href=\"Shaman\"&gt;Shaman&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Water%20Walking\"&gt;Water Walking&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"buff\"&gt;buff&lt;/a&gt;, group with a &lt;a href=\"Death%20Knight\"&gt;Death Knight&lt;/a&gt; for their &lt;a href=\"Path%20of%20Frost\"&gt;Path of Frost&lt;/a&gt; buff, or acquire one or two doses of &lt;a href=\"Elixir%20of%20Water%20Walking\"&gt;Elixir of Water Walking&lt;/a&gt;.

Once the Prime Designate of Azeroth, he was cursed by his daughter &lt;a href=\"Helya\"&gt;Helya&lt;/a&gt; to be trapped in the Halls of Valor along with his army. Despite his curse, Odyn could still leave the halls in the form of a &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; named Havi as shown repeatedly, or under his true form in short bursts.\nAmong the vrykul, Odyn is worshipped as a storm god and the king of the gods. He is stated to follow the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard\"&gt;Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; brothers, with his &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"shieldmaiden\"&gt;shieldmaiden&lt;/a&gt;s being referred to as warriors of the Light.\nHistory.\nOdyn is one of the titan-forged who were empowered by the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; and thus became Keepers. He led the titan-forged armies against the forces of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s. He was imbued with the powers of &lt;a href=\"Aman%27Thul\"&gt;Aman'Thul&lt;/a&gt;. Together with &lt;a href=\"Tyr\"&gt;Tyr&lt;/a&gt;, he battled and defeated &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros%20the%20Firelord\"&gt;Ragnaros the Firelord&lt;/a&gt; and devised the final plan to bring down &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt;. For his leadership, determination and courage, he was granted the title of Prime Designate, leader of the titan-forged on Azeroth, and was tasked with watching Yogg-Saron's prison and maintaining the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Wills\"&gt;Forge of Wills&lt;/a&gt;. Odyn gifted &lt;a href=\"Hymdall\"&gt;Hymdall&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Gjallarhorn\"&gt;Gjallarhorn&lt;/a&gt;, and if it is sounded, the Keepers are oathbound to answer its call, as it signals that the end times are upon Azeroth.\nWhen the other Keepers decided to ask the Pantheon to empower the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt; for their heroism against &lt;a href=\"Galakrond\"&gt;Galakrond&lt;/a&gt;, Odyn was vehemently against it, stating that only titan-forged could be trusted to defend Azeroth, as he did not trust the proto-dragons. He sought to create his own elite army, one of steadfast and valiant stature, and saw the &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; to be the most desirable candidate for his army. The Aspects were empowered despite his objections, and so Odyn took a section of &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt; and raised it into the sky, creating the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Halls of Valor&lt;/a&gt;, and in doing so relinquished his position of Prime Designate. Odyn sacrificed his eye to &lt;a href=\"Mueh%27zala\"&gt;Mueh'zala&lt;/a&gt;, an ally of &lt;a href=\"Zovaal\"&gt;Zovaal the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, in exchange for the ability to peer into the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;. When Odyn gazed into the Shadowlands, he saw the &lt;a href=\"kyrian\"&gt;kyrian&lt;/a&gt; and was inspired by them to make something similar for himself. \nOdyn told the &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; that those who died a worthy death in battle would have their spirits brought to the Halls and given new immortal bodies infused with the power of the storm to fight as his &lt;a href=\"Valarjar\"&gt;Valarjar&lt;/a&gt;, which Odyn thought would be better defenders than the dragons. In order to retrieve the spirits of the deceased, Odyn would need vrykul to volunteer to become &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt; - inspired by the Kyrian he had seen - and take those heroic vrykul spirits from the Shadowlands. The vrykul objected, and Odyn's adopted daughter, the titan-forged &lt;a href=\"Helya\"&gt;Helya&lt;/a&gt;, tried to talk him out of it. Instead, Odyn transformed Helya into the first Val'kyr and ordered her to do the job for him. Odyn would later lie to his followers that Helya's transformation had been due to her own arrogance: he claimed that during their argument, she had reached out for the power of the Shadowlands and subsequently gotten sucked into the realm, destroying her body and transforming her into a twisted wraith before he managed to pull her out and that she had subsequently apologized and begged him to make her a Val'kyr.\nHelya nursed resentment against Odyn for thousands of years, until the day &lt;a href=\"Loken\"&gt;Loken&lt;/a&gt;, a Keeper manipulated by &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt;, convinced her to turn against him. Helya used the same magic that had been used to lock the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Plane\"&gt;Elemental Plane&lt;/a&gt; to seal Odyn and his Valarjar army inside the Halls of Valor, and then decided to take vrykul souls in her new realm &lt;a href=\"Helheim\"&gt;Helheim&lt;/a&gt;. Helya would be replaced by &lt;a href=\"Eyir\"&gt;Eyir&lt;/a&gt; as the leader of the Val'kyr, and Loken would go on to steal Odyn's title of Prime Designate.\nLegion.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, still trapped within the Halls of Valor, Odyn sent one of his Val'kyr to rescue a &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;champion&lt;/a&gt; from the brink of death. As this hero was not trapped in the Halls of Valor like Odyn and his Valarjar, the Keeper named them the leader of the Valarjar in the battle against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Later, Odyn also tested the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;leaders&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"class%20order\"&gt;class order&lt;/a&gt;s several times. The first time in disguise as Havi in &lt;a href=\"Stormheim\"&gt;Stormheim&lt;/a&gt; to test their valor, might and will in order to judge if they were worthy of crossing the Gates of Valor, then in a duel in the Halls of Valor to judge if they were worthy of wielding the &lt;a href=\"Aegis%20of%20Aggramar\"&gt;Aegis of Aggramar&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter it was discovered that Helya has learned to turn Odyn's Stormforged Valarjar into &lt;a href=\"Kvaldir\"&gt;Kvaldir&lt;/a&gt;, Odyn decided that he has had enough of her games.\nUnder the disguise of Havi, Odyn was one of the order hall champions who met &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Krasus%27%20Landing\"&gt;Krasus' Landing&lt;/a&gt; to discuss about the &lt;a href=\"Pillars%20of%20Creation\"&gt;Pillars of Creation&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt some point, Odyn invited the Huntmaster of the &lt;a href=\"Unseen%20Path\"&gt;Unseen Path&lt;/a&gt; to attend the Night of the Wilds, an event where the spirits of beasts of legend rise in the &lt;a href=\"Fields%20of%20the%20Eternal%20Hunt\"&gt;Fields of the Eternal Hunt&lt;/a&gt;. He also tested the Battlelord of his Valarjar as part of an annual trial to determine the strongest warrior in the land.\nTrial of Valor.\nIn recent days, great heroes have arrived in the lands of Stormheim in the Legion's wake. Hoping that their might and determination could tip the scales and end Helya's reign, Odyn summoned these champions for a final test, the &lt;a href=\"Trial%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Trial of Valor&lt;/a&gt;. The Keeper sought mortal champions to vanquish the ruler of Helheim his bitter nemesis, Helya, and secure his freedom.\nAfter Helya's defeat, the curse that bound Odyn to the Halls of Valor was at last broken. Odyn said that it had been ages since he last looked upon the halls of Ulduar and that perhaps he should visit his watcher kin. The Valarjar also recovered her &lt;a href=\"Helya%27s%20Horn\"&gt;horn&lt;/a&gt;, capable of commanding the legions of kvaldir who were cursed beyond redemption. Odyn commanded the Battlelord to use the horn to direct kvaldir against key Legion targets on the Broken Shore.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Valdemar%20Stormseeker\"&gt;Valdemar Stormseeker&lt;/a&gt;, Odyn has heard about the Azerothian heroes' search for &lt;a href=\"Azerite\"&gt;Azerite&lt;/a&gt;, and his vrykul forces have gathered what they could during the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;.\nShadowlands.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;war against the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, several of Odyn's Val'kyr began to go missing, and even those sent to find them did not return. When an adventurer in the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt; found and freed &lt;a href=\"Danica%20the%20Reclaimer\"&gt;Danica the Reclaimer&lt;/a&gt;, they returned to the Halls of Valor and revealed to Odyn that Helya was still alive and corrupting his Val'kyr into &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt; with the eye that he gave up long ago, now the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;Eye of the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;.\nFurious, Odyn declared that this \"insult\" could not stand and ordered the heroes to create an instrument, the &lt;a href=\"Ilskahorn\"&gt;Ilskahorn&lt;/a&gt;, with which they would lure his Eye to battle, and to recruit a group of worthy Val'kyr to accompany Danica in battle. After the heroes and Val'kyr managed to defeat the Eye, and forced it to flee back to its master's side in &lt;a href=\"Torghast%2C%20Tower%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Torghast&lt;/a&gt;. both Odyn and the Maw Walkers' allies rejoiced, emboldening their continued advance against &lt;a href=\"Zovaal\"&gt;Zovaal the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuotes.\nGossip.\nYou are my greatest weapon now, &lt;name&gt;.\nAs Havi.\nWeakness is never tolerated.\nThe next task may be too perilous, even for you, little outsider.

After his defeat in Ulduar, the &lt;a href=\"titan%20keeper\"&gt;titan keeper&lt;/a&gt;s brought him back and now he is working again in Ulduar's furnace.\nBackground.\nThe Winterskorn War.\nAlong with &lt;a href=\"Volkhan\"&gt;Volkhan&lt;/a&gt;, Ignis saw the &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Peaks\"&gt;Storm Peaks&lt;/a&gt; surrounding &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt; as a land ripe for conquest, however, they were aware that they needed an army and to this end the fire giants turned towards the fierce &lt;a href=\"Winterskorn%20clan\"&gt;Winterskorn clan&lt;/a&gt; of vrykul. After taking control of the clan by force the fire giants were quick to stroke the fires of their battle lust, while forging armor and weapons for the army designed to work against the other &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt;.\nHowever just as the new army was to embark on its &lt;a href=\"Winterskorn%20War\"&gt;great conquest&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Flesh\"&gt;Curse of Flesh&lt;/a&gt; struck. Seeing their forces succumb to it did not deter Ignis and Volkhan from their goal, but both were aware that they could no longer rely on the Winterskorn alone to achieve victory. To strengthen their army Volkhan and Ignis molded powerful molten golems and iron constructs of their own design. This massive Winterskorn army marched first against the good-natured &lt;a href=\"earthen\"&gt;earthen&lt;/a&gt;, storming their underground lairs. The earthen were utterly unprepared to face such an overwhelming and organized force. Entire caverns were massacred to the last living creature.\nA small group of survivors escaped the onslaught and sought the help of &lt;a href=\"Tyr\"&gt;Tyr&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Archaedas\"&gt;Archaedas&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ironaya\"&gt;Ironaya&lt;/a&gt;, who had thus far eluded &lt;a href=\"Loken\"&gt;Loken&lt;/a&gt;'s wrath. Incensed by what they learned, Tyr and his companions immediately journeyed to the earthen's cavernous home to aid the beleaguered titan-forged. Tyr himself led the bravest of the earthen in skirmishes with the Winterskorn, while Archaedas and Ironaya constructed defenses to ward off future attacks. In time, the earthen and their allies drove back the Winterskorn.\nAlthough their attempts to conquer the Storm Peaks failed, Volkhan and Ignis did not concede defeat. They returned to their blistering forges and created a new army - one even greater than before. Not satisfied with golems and constructs alone, Volkhan and Ignis crafted enchanted snares with which to enslave entire flights of &lt;a href=\"proto-dragon\"&gt;proto-dragon&lt;/a&gt;s. These creatures would serve not as mounts, but as beasts of war. The giants outfitted their winged servants with fiery weapons to strike terror into the hearts of the earthen. The Winterskorn's next brutal assault shattered the earthen's defenses and drove them from their refuge. The earthen scattered across the icy mountain passes, but they could not escape their foes. Vrykul and golems hunted the earthen on the ground, while proto-dragons assailed them from skies. Even Tyr, Archaedas, and Ironaya were forced to flee from the Winterskorn's fury.\nHowever, Tyr was able to recruit the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt; to his cause and they helped bring an end to the conflict by shattering the golems and constructs forged by Ignis and Volkhan, liberating the enslaved proto-dragons, and forcing the Winterskorn into a deep slumber.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nIgnis the Furnace Master is an optional &lt;a href=\"boss\"&gt;boss encounter&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ulduar%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt; and can be found in the &lt;a href=\"Colossal%20Forge\"&gt;Colossal Forge&lt;/a&gt;.

This imposing fire giant toils over the Colossal Forge, creating the iron armies that will conquer Azeroth in Yogg-Saron's name.\"\nOverview.\nIgnis the Furnace Master will activate Iron Constructs which need to Heat Up and Shattered to destroy them.\nStrategy.\nThe Ignis encounter is an endurance fight with a soft enrage (not a timer) that makes up the complexity of the fight and affects all members of the raid.\nTanking.\nFor all modes, you will need a Main Tank to kite Ignis, and either an off-tank or a very skilled kiting DPS (probably two or even three on 25 man). If you attempt to turn the Iron Constructs molten and destroy them, you'll probably prefer an off-tank because of the mitigation and large buffer of health compared to a DPS. However, if you are going to simply DPS him down immediately (you will need to average about 3500 dps on 10 man for all 5-7 DPS), you can get away with a player who is able to aggro, dodge, and CC the constructs (prot warriors, prot paladin, mages, hunters with a pet, warlocks with a voidwalker, or a druid). Also, the constructs can be snared into place so any kind of druid is the best option.\nAs the main tank, have a hunter misdirect the boss to you, or simply run up and get aggro on him immediately. You should choose and make known which direction or area of the room you're going to kite him so the rest of the raid knows where to position themselves. Some groups choose to strafe him left to right (either across the room, or length wise near the constructs), around the entire room, or around one half of the room; note that he should never be tanked in front of the water if you are going to be destroying the constructs, as scorch will be dispelled. However, this is the optimal location for tanking him to reduce damage on the tank, and keep everyone in the same position throughout the fight.\nThe second way to tank him is to bring him to the direct center of the room. Have the tank turn him away from the raid and when he scorchs the ground, turn him to the left or right and keep the melee DPS where they are. Then, after then 2nd scorch run across the boss and tank him in the opposite direction so the 3rd scorch goes to the right or left and the melee DPS can stay where they are. After the 3rd scorch comes, the 1st one should be down by now and you go back to the starting point. If done right, no one should take any damage from contrucsts blowing up nor should they lose Heat stacks. The off tanks should be ready to taunt them to water when they go molten and get out of the way of them blowing up.\nNaxxramas geared tanks (item levels 200 and 213) can take upwards of 25000-30000 damage per hit from Ignis' melee strikes. As the fight goes on, his melee strikes will gain an additional 20% damage from each Iron Construct that is active (eventually, if left unchecked, it will get to the point where you are one shotted). His scorch is a cone that will damage anyone he is facing, so your back should always be away from the raid. Flame Jets will throw you into the air briefly, but since you aren't a caster, your abilities should not become locked. After a scorch has landed on the ground around you, strafe out of it quickly to avoid taking damage and get your melee DPS into a safe spot as well. You should not aggro any constructs unless you wish to cause additional stress to your healers.\nFor the first 15 seconds of the fight, DPS Ignis. He doesn't have a cleave, and scorch won't be fired until 12 seconds into the fight (and you can stand behind him safely). When the first Construct appears, grab aggro and begin moving away from it. The more constructs that are up, the faster they move so eventually they will outrun you if you don't do anything about it. Off-tanks should only take about 1-2k damage per swing, so the damage they deal is negligible, however, since this affects your healers, if you can do something about it you should (as a prot warrior, you can charge constructs and then run past them, or intervene to a close ally to get away from enemies). If you're kiting them and you're not a tank, CCing abilities are vital to your group's survival. Frost Nova, Frost Traps and pet tanks, Void Walkers and destruction warlocks' AOE stun, and druid roots and travel form are all possible solutions, however they tend to only be effective for a few minutes. If your group is going to be destroying the Constructs, make sure you have a healer that can either heal you through scorch, or you have good CCers that can keep the constructs in the flames of scorch long enough to heat it up (moonkins and mages are very handy for that).\nHealers.\nHealers need to be on the ball to keep the main tank healed because of the significant melee damage dealt by Ignis. Casters, particularly healers, should take care to stop casting before Ignis uses Flame Jets, otherwise they will be locked out of their spells for 8 seconds. All players should make sure to move out of Scorch areas. Random players will periodically be charged and placed in the Slag Pot attached to Ignis' stomach. Whichever player is charged should be healed through the DoT (they gain a debuff to help identify it on your raid frames). You should instruct your raid members to stack on you for AOE healing.\nDPS.\nAs a DPS, your job is to not stand in scorched areas, to call out when you are inside of the Slag Pot, and stand behind Ignis at all times (preferably stacked on your healers for AOE healing). Ranged DPS should be used to destroy Brittle Iron Constructs if your raid decides to kill the adds (only powerful abilities like &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Bolt\"&gt;Chaos Bolt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Frostfire%20Bolt\"&gt;Frostfire Bolt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fireball\"&gt;Fireball&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Aimed%20Shot\"&gt;Aimed Shot&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Starfire\"&gt;Starfire&lt;/a&gt; should be used to beat the 5000 minimum damage requirement). If you survive being stuck in the Slag Pot, you should use the haste buff as best you can (10-second duration) to fire off your slower, more powerful attacks. Since this fight is heavily reliant on DPS, every DPS member of the party should have a minimum of 3500 DPS (4000+ group average recommended) for the duration of the fight.\nAchievements.\nIgnis the Furnace Master does not have a hard mode.\nQuotes.\nSound files.\nSee \"&lt;a href=\"PlaySoundFile%20macros%20-%20Ulduar%23.C2.A0Ignis%20the%20Furnace%20Master\"&gt;Sound Files of Ulduar: Ignis the Furnace Master&lt;/a&gt;\"\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

The &lt;a href=\"Ignition%20Key\"&gt;Ignition Key&lt;/a&gt; drops off of &lt;a href=\"Supervisor%20Lugwizzle\"&gt;Supervisor Lugwizzle&lt;/a&gt;. He patrols from the top of the ramp to the bottom. There are a few other goblins that patrol, as well as a rare spawn (&lt;a href=\"Foreman%20Grills\"&gt;Foreman Grills&lt;/a&gt;), so keep an eye open for them.\nIf you haven't battled many of the goblins in the Sludge Fen, they run for help when they are at 1/2 life, so plan your fights on the derrick and on the shore accordingly."}

This is effectively a boss fight, but quite soloable. It has the following abilities:\nTry to keep the guardian at range, as it will melee. Melee players need not worry, as the guardian will throw meteors on occasion, which can be thrown back at the guardian to deal huge amounts of damage.\nWatch out for the Blazing Eruptions, which are marked on the ground a few seconds before they land, and dodge his eye beam. He will throw the meteor, which \"debuffs\" players with the Burning Adrenaline Rush, which should be used to escape the immediate area or take ~6000 Fire damage. The meteor, when it lands, triggers a boss warning:\nRight-click on it to launch it back at the guardian. They may bug and all get stuck in the air, but it might not matter to win.\nIt is quite possible to end the fight without taking any damage at all. Once the guardian is down, loot the lens and head back to the elevated platform.\nOn complete, a big explosion happens and some fire and light shoots up.

During the attack, they dragged numerous &lt;a href=\"Stoneplow%20Envoy\"&gt;Stoneplow Envoy&lt;/a&gt;s off into the &lt;a href=\"Forbidden%20Jungle\"&gt;Forbidden Jungle&lt;/a&gt;.\nValley of the Four Winds.\nIn the Valley of the Four Winds, some of the Ik'thik managed to make their way over the wall, bringing with them the &lt;a href=\"Sha\"&gt;Sha's&lt;/a&gt; corruption. Eventually, the massive &lt;a href=\"Ik%27thik%20Colossus\"&gt;Ik'thik Colossus&lt;/a&gt; managed to batter down part of the wall, allowing the Ik'thik to stream into the Valley. &lt;a href=\"Loon%20Mai\"&gt;Loon Mai&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Shado-pan\"&gt;Shado-pan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Yi-Mo%20Longbrow\"&gt;Yi-Mo Longbrow&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Warden%20of%20Zhu\"&gt;Wardens of Zhu&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Koro%20Mistwalker\"&gt;Koro Mistwalker&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Crane\"&gt;Red Crane&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Monk\"&gt;Monk&lt;/a&gt;s all banded together to combat the threat, bolstered by &lt;a href=\"Mudmug\"&gt;Mudmug's&lt;/a&gt; beer, and aided by &lt;a href=\"Tauren\"&gt;Tauren&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sunwalker\"&gt;Sunwalker&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Night%20Elf\"&gt;Night Elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;s. Some of the Ik'thik field officers were under the influence of the sha, and once &lt;a href=\"Ken-Ken%27s%20Mask\"&gt;Ken-Ken's Mask&lt;/a&gt; was presented to them, they returned to the capital to question the adjuncts about premature swarm, while the other leaders were dealt with by &lt;a href=\"Clever%20Ashyo\"&gt;Clever Ashyo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kang%20Bramblestaff\"&gt;Kang Bramblestaff&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ken-Ken\"&gt;Ken-Ken&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Lin%20Tenderpaw\"&gt;Lin Tenderpaw&lt;/a&gt;. Ultimately, they were repelled by these combined forces, with the Colossus being slain by a disciple of &lt;a href=\"Master%20Bruised%20Paw\"&gt;Master Bruised Paw&lt;/a&gt;, it's corpse filling the breach in the Serpent's Spine.\nDread Wastes.\nIn the Dread Wastes, the Ik'thik stand guard over Kypari Zar and Kypari Ik, maintaining contact with &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Empress%20Shek%27zeer\"&gt;Shek'zeer&lt;/a&gt;. They also patrol the &lt;a href=\"Stinging%20Trail\"&gt;Stinging Trail&lt;/a&gt;, draining young kypari saplings of their &lt;a href=\"kyparite\"&gt;amber&lt;/a&gt; before they are ready, a great crime in the eyes of the &lt;a href=\"Klaxxi\"&gt;Klaxxi&lt;/a&gt;, who have since begun taking the amber for themselves. They may have also developed a method for ensuring that &lt;a href=\"Ik%27thik%20Swarmborn\"&gt;swarmborn&lt;/a&gt; venom, which normally diminishes with age, does not lose its potency as the young grow older. They also have their &lt;a href=\"Ik%27thik%20Genemancer\"&gt;genemancer&lt;/a&gt;s hard at work on dissecting and studying the local wildlife, as well as creating strange parasites that will change the animals into war beasts."}

It features a lot of WoW humor and a LOT of recompositing &amp; video editing. Produced by &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.myndflame.com\"&gt;Myndflame&lt;/a&gt;, the video was captured from live servers and modelviewer and is generally categorized as &lt;a href=\"machinima\"&gt;machinima&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"http%3A//myndflame.gameriot.com/videos/Illegal-Danish-Super-Snacks\"&gt;Watch it here.&lt;/a&gt; The name Illegal Danish is a reference to &lt;a href=\"Forbidden%20Donut\"&gt;Forbidden Donut&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; guild on the server where the footage was filmed. The song \"MC Raiders\" plays during the credits.\nIllegal Danish: Super Snacks.\nAn unsuccessful diabolical genius, High Warlord Van Kraken had to quit his job as a mechanic because no one was buying his gadgets. He began to sell potions in competition with another alchemist. He invented a formula for a new elixir which would sell for large amounts of gold, and had all but one critical ingredient: the Illegal Danish, a pastry held as a treasure by the guild which is named after it. \nVan Kraken created a robot that looked like an Illegal Danish guild member, Floivan. Illegal Danish was known to hold a guild meeting in Ironforge to discuss portal malfunctions. Thus, a video was shown to the members about the malfunctions, but the video turned into Higgins and Brother Munson's video at Southshore Beach. The guild sees Floivan and almost chases him down. \nHe then steals a tank and runs over Dirti, an annoying gnome rogue asking people to \"join his guild\". After some mishaps, they end up in Stranglethorn Vale. Meanwhile Rasi and Basutei are told by the guild master to head to Astanaar to check out the spell disruptions. On the way, Basutei complains that a \"feral\" druid shouldn't be wearing healing pants.\nBasutei proceeds to flirt with Rasi at this time, at one point even attempting to persuade her to have sex with him. Meanwhile, Floivan and Dirti try to get to Ironforge. Rasi and Basutei arrive at Astranaar only to Find a Snacky Machine, which Basutei breaks open to \"Fulfill the Prophecy\". Later they arrive to find Robot Floivan stealing the Danish. A battle ensues, Kiljoy joins the fray by jumping at the robot and yelling \"Arcanite Reaper, HOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!\", only to be blown up for moving in slow motion when everything else was normal. Basutei is then attached to Robo Floivan's magnet and launched into Club Thrall, Orgrimmar.\nIllegal Danish Two: Escape from Orgrimmar.\nIn Episode 2, Basutei falls through the roof of Club Thrall and is imprisoned (naked except for his helmet). Putting on a dress, he is admiring himself in a mirror when an undead enters, in an attempt to do an escort quest. They manage to sneak out of the prison, but are thwarted just outside the gates. Back at Ironforge, Rasi tries her best to beat Mecha-Flovian piloted by Fogsworth (while reading a pig-related indecent magazine), as Van Kraken orders him to return with the Danish. In an attempt to defeat Mecha-Flovian, Rasi uses her most destructive attack...flying up high in epic flight mode and ramming her giant bear butt on Mecha-Flovain, defeating him but letting Fogsworth escape. While this is happening, Puff and Lil'Puff are doing stupid stuff with the guild like shooting an apple off of Puff's head with a pyroblast. When Rasi returns, she is angry that no one helped her and demands someone pay for her repairs. Puff and Lil'Puff get into a fight on who does it while returning to where they thought the Danish was. On returning to the location, Rasi says the Danish was stolen, but Puff reassures her that it couldn't happen; anyone who wanted it had to enter a code relating to Pi divided by their guild's last golf tournament, have to have the top three officers of Illegal Danish raise it from the depths of Ironforge (if done improperly they'd all blow up) and they would have to defeat the Rocket Elf! Turns out, Lil'John skipped out on the defenses and only had Mr. Pilkington as a distraction. Elsewhere, Dirti and his guild (a rabbit, a log and a mini-diablo that can conjure fire) are out to raid Molten Core, but lose Loggi (the log) because the Mini-Diablo lights him on fire. Floivan comes back and asks Dirti what he's doing and they move out to go to Molten Core. After a little walking Dirti is picked up by a bird and dropped onto a blood elf named Linken (not being the gnome known as Linken) and robs him. He then meets a spirit who asks him to go on a quest to save \"Zeldu\". Rather than go through the trouble, he merely takes the Master Sword and leaves. Back in Ironforge, Puff tells Rasi the secret of the Danish: It's the last one remaining after Stormwind fell, as King Llane had all Danishes destroyed, believing his was the reason the archers failed. Rasi laughs, asking if the guild was really to protect \"some moldy old Danish\". Puff explains he had exaggerated the powers of the Danish, as they had needed warriors in the guild: \"EVEN TOUCHING THE DANISH WILL GIVE YOU GOD LIKE POWERS!\". Since no one was supposed to tell, it is believed a leak took place, the ass-toucher being to blame. The scene shifts to Floivan as he walks around Stranglethorn Vale trying to get home, complaining that his dad will be angry with him, when he hears a sound. Moments later, Murlocs with a Dwarf Steam Roller charge in and Floivan screams \"MURLOCS\"! Back at Ironforge, Puff tries to tame a cat that Lil'John kills (to Puff's extreme annoyance) and John claims he has found the \"ass toucher\". Puff then begins to sing but stops himself and asks if everyone has their costume. John says they do and the scene then cuts to the &lt;a href=\"Illegal%20Danish/HMS%20Theramore\"&gt;H.M.S. Theramore&lt;/a&gt;. Then Puff sings his song (http://myndflame.gameriot.com/videos/HMS-Theramore).\nThe scene returns to Thrall and Basutei with the whole court filled with weapon wielding horde maniacs wanting to kill Basutei. He is attacked by an undead, so tries to use a Mechanical Yeti to save himself (thinking it has the power of five gorillas}, which fails. Thrall tells him in order to escape, Basutei must challenge him to a single match of Super Snacks 2, Championship Edition, a video game where you can play as any of your favorite Illegal Danish heroes! Thrall picks himself but Basutei refuses, as he doesn't have 50 Silver to play. Instead, he picks up a broom and starts whacking Thrall with it. Thrall slams Basutei to the wall and shoots lighting at him. When Basutei looks up he sees two ghostly wolves charging at him, so he uses his Mechanical Yeti as a chew toy for them to fetch. Thrall then throws a mace at him which Basutei evades, only to find out it was an explosive mace. When the smoke clears a rabbit is thrown at Thrall, but he backflips, evades, and steps on the rabbit. Thrall taunts Basutei about how pathetic the Alliance is only to get crushed by Mecha-Kiljoy! (What looks to be made of the Mecha-Floivan from earlier). Everyone screams and in the panic Basutei is saved, ironically by his helmet being attracted to the magnet on Mecha-Killjoy. Then the credits roll with &lt;a href=\"Learn%202%20Play\"&gt;Learn 2 Play&lt;/a&gt;.\nNotes.\nFootage in Illegal Danish: Super Snacks shows that at least parts of it were recorded during the &lt;a href=\"Gates%20of%20Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Gates of Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"world%20event\"&gt;world event&lt;/a&gt;.\nA trailer of Illegal Danish: Escape from Orgrimmar, the follow up of Illegal Danish: Super Snacks, has been released and can be seen on &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.warcraftmovies.com/movieview.php%3Fid%3D24777\"&gt;Warcraftmovies.com&lt;/a&gt;. A more recent trailer has been released &lt;a href=\"http%3A//myndflame.gameriot.com/videos/Illegal-Danish-2-Trailer\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn January 1, 2008 Illegal Danish 2: Escape from Orgrimmar was released and can be viewed &lt;a href=\"http%3A//myndflame.gameriot.com/videos/Illegal-Danish-2-Escape-from-Orgrimmar\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;."}

They controlled several of the watery areas of the shattered planet, including much of &lt;a href=\"Zangarmarsh\"&gt;Zangarmarsh&lt;/a&gt;, and were led by Illidan's naga lieutenant, &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Vashj\"&gt;Lady Vashj&lt;/a&gt;, who ruled from &lt;a href=\"Coilfang%20Reservoir\"&gt;Coilfang Reservoir&lt;/a&gt; in Zangarmarsh.\nHistory.\nThe Frozen Throne.\nHaving been summoned by &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; allied with him and began helping him with his new mission.\nThey were allied with the &lt;a href=\"satyr\"&gt;satyr&lt;/a&gt; faction, &lt;a href=\"Illidan%27s%20Servitors\"&gt;Illidan's Servitors&lt;/a&gt; and attacked the night elven villages on the coast of &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt; as well as the port &lt;a href=\"Nendis\"&gt;Nendis&lt;/a&gt;. Illidan ordered them to destroy the elven ships but were interrupted by &lt;a href=\"Maiev\"&gt;Maiev&lt;/a&gt; and her &lt;a href=\"Watchers\"&gt;Watchers&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen Illidan landed on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;, a small group of the naga secured the entrance to the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;. Once Illidan entered it, the group was killed by Maiev's force.\nThe naga and their sea witch &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Vashj\"&gt;Lady Vashj&lt;/a&gt; followed Illidan through the Tomb to the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20the%20Eye\"&gt;Chamber of the Eye&lt;/a&gt; to retrieve the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Eye of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;. Numbers of naga and mur'gul were left behind when the collapsing of the tomb started.\nThe naga led by &lt;a href=\"Serena%20Scarscale\"&gt;Serena Scarscale&lt;/a&gt; continued to attack the night elven base and Maiev who was escorting a runner out of the isles. They continued to do so for weeks. When Maiev's reinforcements arrived, the naga attack was spearheaded by &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Serpentra\"&gt;Lady Serpentra&lt;/a&gt;. With the reinforcements, the naga forces in the area were destroyed but Serpentra apparently escaped as did Illidan.\nIllidan's naga accompanied him to &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran Ruins&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; where naga summoners began channeling a spell through the Eye to destroy the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. Lady Serpentra guarded Illidan and constantly attacked the bases of the night elves and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Remnants\"&gt;Alliance Remnants&lt;/a&gt;. They also captured paladin &lt;a href=\"Magroth%20the%20Defender\"&gt;Magroth the Defender&lt;/a&gt;. Most of the force and the summoners were killed thus ending the plan. Shortly before Illidan's execution, Malfurion learned that Tyrande may still be alive as she ahd fallen to a river. The archdruid agreed that the naga and Illidan will help find her.\nIllidan and his naga began searching &lt;a href=\"River%20Arevass\"&gt;River Arevass&lt;/a&gt; and located the priestess. The naga fought of the &lt;a href=\"Shadowglen%20Trolls\"&gt;Shadowglen Trolls&lt;/a&gt; and their chieftain &lt;a href=\"Krag%27jin\"&gt;Krag'jin&lt;/a&gt; in order to break the dams on the river. They defeated the undead and successfully rescued Tyrande.\nDesiccation of Zangarmarsh.\nUnder the command of &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Vashj\"&gt;Lady Vashj&lt;/a&gt;, Illidan's Naga began to enslave the tribes of the &lt;a href=\"Broken\"&gt;Broken&lt;/a&gt; in an effort to bolster the naga's workforce and further their agenda in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. Nearly all of the &lt;a href=\"Wastewalker%20tribe\"&gt;Wastewalker tribe&lt;/a&gt; has been captured and put to work to drain the waters of &lt;a href=\"Zangarmarsh\"&gt;Zangarmarsh&lt;/a&gt;. The plan was to take control of all the waters of Outland, and through them, its people.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Expedition\"&gt;Cenarion Expedition&lt;/a&gt; also traveled to Zangarmarsh to study Outland's pockets of life. However, they discovered Zangarmarsh's lakes and marshes have consistently been drying up and began investigating in order to preserve the region's ecosystem. The Cenarion Expedition discovered the naga have been draining the major lakes of Zangarmarsh and sabotaged the nagas' steam pumps that were draining the lakes to prevent further damage to the marsh.\nAided by adventurers, &lt;a href=\"Ysiel%20Windsinger\"&gt;Ysiel Windsinger&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Watcher%20Jhang\"&gt;Watcher Jhang&lt;/a&gt; led an expedition to investigate the evil machinations of the naga in the &lt;a href=\"Coilfang%20Reservoir\"&gt;Coilfang Reservoir&lt;/a&gt;. The expedition disrupted the nagas' operations and ultimately led to the slaying of Lady Vashj, ending their efforts to drain the waters of Zangarmarsh once and for all.\nLegion.\nThe last active naga component of the Illidari forces were the &lt;a href=\"Coilskar%20tribe\"&gt;Coilskar tribe&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Lady%20S%27theno\"&gt;Lady S'theno&lt;/a&gt;. They fought during the &lt;a href=\"Mardum\"&gt;Mardum&lt;/a&gt; campaign and helped capture the &lt;a href=\"Fel%20Hammer\"&gt;Fel Hammer&lt;/a&gt;. After this, they used this ship as their base of operation. The Coilskar forces briefly appeared on &lt;a href=\"Niskara\"&gt;Niskara&lt;/a&gt;, and were also active during the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt; campaign.\nTribes.\nWhether the group still exists after the events of \"The Frozen Throne\" is not stated, but if it does, the following tribes serve Illidan and are thus very likely a part of the group.\nBeasts.\nThe following beasts were known to serve Lady Vashj:"}

Though his older brother, &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Furion&lt;/a&gt;, warned him that magic was an evil, corrupting power, Illidan steadfastly refused to give up his coveted art.

He is the twin brother of &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; and was, like his sibling, in love with &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;. Originally a powerful &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"sorcerer\"&gt;sorcerer&lt;/a&gt;, Illidan officially betrayed his people by defecting to the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, though his reasons for doing so were noble as he secretly aimed to repel the Legion's invasion. He eventually returned to the side of his fellow night elves, but his creation of a &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity%20%28Hyjal%29\"&gt;second Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; at the end of the war caused his people to name him \"Betrayer\" and imprison him in the &lt;a href=\"Barrow%20Deeps\"&gt;Barrow Deeps&lt;/a&gt; below &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;. There he remained for over 10,000 years, watched over by the &lt;a href=\"warden\"&gt;warden&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; and her &lt;a href=\"Watchers\"&gt;Watchers&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the Legion invaded &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; once more during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, Tyrande freed Illidan from his prison in order to have him battle the demons once more. He subsequently consumed the &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; energies of the &lt;a href=\"Skull%20of%20Gul%27dan\"&gt;Skull of Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; and transformed into a demon in order to defeat the &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tichondrius\"&gt;Tichondrius&lt;/a&gt;, an act for which he was banished by Malfurion. After the Legion's defeat at the end of the war, Illidan decided to feign allegiance to the &lt;a href=\"demon%20lord\"&gt;demon lord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; by agreeing to destroy Kil'jaeden's traitorous creation, the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, as a way to learn more about his true foe: the Burning Legion. Although he amassed an army of servants in the form of the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Vashj\"&gt;Lady Vashj&lt;/a&gt;, Illidan's efforts were stopped by the night elves and he was forced to flee to the shattered realm of &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. There he and his naga gathered new allies in the form of the &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Broken\"&gt;Broken&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Akama\"&gt;Akama&lt;/a&gt;, and with their aid he overthrew Outland's tyrannical ruler &lt;a href=\"Magtheridon\"&gt;Magtheridon&lt;/a&gt; to claim the broken realm for his own. Illidan later traveled with his allies to the Lich King's stronghold of &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt; for one last attempt to complete Kil'jaeden's mission, but he was eventually thwarted and nearly killed by the Lich King's champion, the &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;.\nReturning to Outland, Illidan dropped all pretense of serving Kil'jaeden and mustered his army\u2014the Illidari\u2014to begin his true war against the Burning Legion. He trained an army of elven demon hunters in his own image and began preparing to destroy the Legion &lt;a href=\"Planet\"&gt;world&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;, but his extreme methods and single-minded focus on his goal led to the alienation of his allies Kael'thas and Akama. Through the manipulations of Kil'jaeden, the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;invaded Outland&lt;/a&gt; and began dismantling Illidan's forces in the belief that he was no better than the demons he claimed to fight. Despite succeeding in destroying the demon stronghold of &lt;a href=\"Nathreza\"&gt;Nathreza&lt;/a&gt;, the Betrayer was ultimately cornered and struck down within his own sanctum by Akama, a group of Azerothian &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s, and his vengeful former jailer, Maiev. Maiev subsequently brought Illidan's corpse to the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20the%20Wardens\"&gt;Vault of the Wardens&lt;/a&gt; so that his &lt;a href=\"Ghost\"&gt;spirit&lt;/a&gt; could suffer the rest of his eternal sentence. There it remained for years until the Legion &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;invaded once more&lt;/a&gt;.\nA struggle for Illidan's soul ensued between the Legion and the forces of Azeroth, including the remaining Illidari, culminating in Illidan's resurrection atop the &lt;a href=\"Nighthold\"&gt;Nighthold&lt;/a&gt;. The Betrayer subsequently joined forces with Azeroth's defenders as they battled the Legion across the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt; and within the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;. During a battle with Kil'jaeden in the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;, Illidan used an artifact known as the &lt;a href=\"%3ASargerite%20Keystone\"&gt;:Sargerite Keystone&lt;/a&gt; to open a rift that brought the worlds of Azeroth and Argus within reach of each other. Illidan accompanied Azeroth's champions as they traveled to Argus to battle the Legion alongside the &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Army of the Light&lt;/a&gt;, whose leader\u2014the prime &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Xe%27ra\"&gt;Xe'ra&lt;/a&gt;\u2014believed that Illidan was the Chosen One, a hero of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; prophesied to end the age of demons. Illidan rejected the idea of having his destiny forged for him and killed Xe'ra when the naaru tried to forcibly infuse him with the Light. The Army of the Light and their allies eventually assaulted &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;' seat of power, &lt;a href=\"Antorus%2C%20the%20Burning%20Throne\"&gt;Antorus&lt;/a&gt;, and freed the captive spirits of the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;, who imprisoned Sargeras at the &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20the%20Pantheon\"&gt;Seat of the Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; for his transgressions. While the rest of Azeroth's heroes returned home to their world, Illidan chose to remain behind, becoming Sargeras' jailor.\nIllidan was introduced as a supporting character in ', though he played a far more significant role as one of the two main antagonists (alongside &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;) in the game's sequel, '. He made his first appearance in \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" as a major antagonist with the first expansion, ', serving as the &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;final boss&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt; raid in &lt;a href=\"patch%202.1.0\"&gt;patch 2.1&lt;/a&gt;. Illidan returned as an anti-hero in ' alongside his &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt;. He became a primary force towards defeating the Legion, siding with the heroes of Azeroth.\nBiography.\nIllidan and his twin brother, &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion&lt;/a&gt;, were born at &lt;a href=\"Lorlathil\"&gt;Lorlathil&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Val%27sharah\"&gt;Val'sharah&lt;/a&gt; and grew up in &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt; as friends with &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;. Illidan and Malfurion's parents died years before the coming &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;.\nWar of the Ancients.\nIllidan practiced Highborne magic. In his youth, he attempted to master the druidic forces, as his brother had, but the sorcery called to him in a way that the magic of the land did not. Unlike his brother, Illidan was born with amber eyes, at the time a sign of a great destiny \u2014 however, this actually indicated inherent druidic potential. When Malfurion and Tyrande had found their destiny, Illidan was still searching for his. Though not a Highborne himself, he became the personal caster of the military leader, &lt;a href=\"Kur%27talos%20Ravencrest\"&gt;Kur'talos Ravencrest&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt;'s invasion of Azeroth had begun and Azshara's treachery became known, Malfurion convinced Illidan to leave his queen. Illidan followed his brother. But as &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;s entered the battle, Malfurion came to understand that their adversaries were too powerful to fall in combat. To end the invasion, he plotted the destruction of the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;. The idea appalled Illidan. The Well was the source of his magic \u2014 and likely of the elves' immortality \u2014 and its loss was a price far too dear for him to pay. In addition, the night elf found that he increasingly admired the powers of the Burning Legion, seeing a magical purity that underlay their chaotic behavior. Where the night elves struggled to maintain their ground, the Burning Legion's numbers did not seem to permanently diminish.\nAfter the death of &lt;a href=\"Latosius\"&gt;Latosius&lt;/a&gt;, Illidan became the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Moon%20Guard\"&gt;Moon Guard&lt;/a&gt;. However, Illidan did not use the Moon Guard to their fullest potential. Instead of having them cast spells, he ordered them to transfer their power into him, thus empowering his own spells instead; but in doing so, this opened them to attack from the demons with no means to defend themselves. After one particular battle defending &lt;a href=\"Black%20Rook%20Hold\"&gt;Black Rook Hold&lt;/a&gt;, where he drained his own soldiers to the point that they died, Illidan realized that sacrifice was necessary to defeat the Burning Legion, and the others were fools for not seeing it.\nIllidan had strong feelings for &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;, a novice priestess in the &lt;a href=\"Sisters%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Sisters of Elune&lt;/a&gt;. Illidan so desired to impress Tyrande that he often acted without thinking, particularly in magic; he never realized that these displays weren't quite what the priestess was looking for in a mate. But while Illidan struggled to win her heart, none of them realized that the battle was over soon after it had begun; Tyrande had chosen Malfurion almost from the beginning. &lt;a href=\"Xavius\"&gt;Xavius&lt;/a&gt; knew of this and used his power to darken Illidan's thoughts, convincing him that if Malfurion were to die, Illidan would no longer have a rival for Tyrande's love. Finally, the sight of Tyrande in the arms of his brother shattered his final ties to the defenders.\nIt was likely somewhere in this point of time that Illidan defeated a &lt;a href=\"doomguard\"&gt;doomguard&lt;/a&gt; commander named &lt;a href=\"Azzinoth\"&gt;Azzinoth&lt;/a&gt; and took up the demon's personal weapons as his own; these would become known as the &lt;a href=\"The%20Twin%20Blades%20of%20Azzinoth\"&gt;Warglaives of Azzinoth&lt;/a&gt;. When Illidan left, Kur'talos's daughter &lt;a href=\"Illysanna%20Ravencrest\"&gt;Illysanna&lt;/a&gt; - distraught over her father's death and convinced Illidan's path was right - left to go find him and walk in his footsteps.\nIllidan, with a new plan spurred into his mind, journeyed to &lt;a href=\"Zin-Azshari\"&gt;Zin-Azshari&lt;/a&gt;. There he feigned allegiance to Azshara and &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt;. Illidan's plan was to obtain the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Demon Soul&lt;/a&gt;, an artifact of great power created by &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; also known as &lt;a href=\"Neltharion%20the%20Earth-Warder\"&gt;Neltharion the Earth-Warder&lt;/a&gt;, which had the ability to close the portal which was allowing the demons to enter Kalimdor. However, to put this plan in action, Illidan had to gain more power. Illidan was eventually brought before Sargeras himself, who quickly discovered the night elf's plan to obtain the Demon Soul for the Legion. Sargeras was pleased with this plan and gave Illidan a \"gift\" in return for his allegiance. Illidan's eyes were burned out by Sargeras himself, despite still being beyond the portal, and orbs of mystic fire set in their place that allowed Illidan to &lt;a href=\"Spectral%20sight\"&gt;see all forms of magic&lt;/a&gt;, and fel tattoos covered his body. When Illidan's eyes were burned out, he also received a vision of the true strength of the Legion and their crusade across infinite universes, and he came to realize that defeating them on Azeroth would mean nothing. He resolved then to find a way to defeat them for good. &lt;a href=\"Vashj\"&gt;Lady Vashj&lt;/a&gt; was among the &lt;a href=\"handmaiden\"&gt;handmaiden&lt;/a&gt;s who nursed Illidan back to health, and handed him an amber scarf of the same color as his former eyes to cover his empty sockets. Queen Azshara was fascinated by the \"new\" Illidan (who was wary of her advances), but remained cautious, sending Captain &lt;a href=\"Varo%27then\"&gt;Varo'then&lt;/a&gt; to accompany Illidan in his search for the Demon Soul.\nWhen the Demon Soul came into the hands of the Legion, they went about using it as a focus to strengthen their portal above the Well of Eternity for Sargeras. Illidan reunited with the &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Resistance\"&gt;Kaldorei Resistance&lt;/a&gt;, which now greatly mistrusted him after seeming to betray them and hand over the key to victory to the demons. But working alongside Malfurion, the brothers worked together to close the portal with the Demon Soul's power. The destruction of the portal caused the Well of Eternity itself to grow unstable, and right before the defenders fled Zin-Azshari Illidan took several vials and filled them with water from the Well of Eternity. The &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt; that resulted from the Well's instability split the main supercontinent of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor%20%28landmass%29\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; into various smaller continents.\nAfter the Great Sundering, Illidan scaled the peaks of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, where he found a small, tranquil lake. There he poured the contents of three of the vials into the waters. The chaotic energies quickly manifested, tainting the lake and twisting it into a new Well of Eternity. Illidan's joy was short-lived however, when his brother, Malfurion, Tyrande and the rest of the kaldorei leadership discovered him - and all were horrified at what he'd done. Unable to accept that his brother had committed such treachery, Malfurion tried again to explain to Illidan the folly of his ways. The magic, he insisted, was chaotic by nature, and it could only bring about destruction so long as it existed. Illidan refused to listen, so enraptured by the magic's power that his brother seemed to him an unknowing fool. Illidan claimed that magic would be needed should the Burning Legion ever return.\nThe lack of remorse shook Malfurion to his core and he raged at his brother, understanding now that Illidan was lost forever to the magic's sway. He ordered him imprisoned deep below Hyjal in a jail kept far from sight and mind. Malfurion would later note that sometimes he went to visit Illidan in his prison in the hopes of turning him from his fatal path.\nRelease from prison.\nIllidan languished for 10,000 years in a lightless prison. &lt;a href=\"Califax\"&gt;Califax&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"keeper%20of%20the%20grove\"&gt;keeper of the grove&lt;/a&gt;, and a contingent of night elves (including &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;) kept constant guard over the Betrayer. Release came at the unexpected hands of Tyrande, who slaughtered the night elf guards in the hopes of using Illidan against the Legion, which had returned to Azeroth at the hands of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. With his love for Tyrande undampened through the millennia of confinement, Illidan agreed to help. He swore to throw back the Legion and to depart from the night elves forever. Upon being released, Illidan stormed Hyjal's war-torn forest.\nMalfurion opposed Tyrande's decision, thinking the release of Illidan a catastrophic mistake. Frustrated that his brother remained unchanged and eager to prove to him that the demons had no hold over him, Illidan left Malfurion behind, leading a force of night elves into &lt;a href=\"Felwood\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt; to hunt down the Legion. While in Felwood, he encountered &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt;, champion of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, and they engaged in combat. The fighters were equally matched, and the combatants reached an impasse. Illidan stopped the duel and demanded to know why Arthas had tracked him. Arthas responded openly, telling Illidan about the &lt;a href=\"Skull%20of%20Gul%27dan\"&gt;Skull of Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;, the demonic artifact that had corrupted &lt;a href=\"Felwood\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt;. He explained that if the artifact were destroyed, the corruption of the forests would halt. To ensure that Illidan would take the bait, Arthas spared no detail of the Skull's power, adding that &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;his master&lt;/a&gt; knew of Illidan's thirst for power. Although Illidan did not trust Arthas, he nevertheless sought the Skull and its power out.\nA great Demon Gate defended the Skull as Illidan and his forces had to fight mightily to gain access to the artifact. Driven by necessity and influenced by the belief that with the increased power, he could, at last, redeem himself in the eyes of Tyrande, he shattered the demonic seal and used the Skull's powers for his own. Strength he found, but peril greater than power came to him at once. The battle for control of the Skull came with a heavy price and the artifact's powers changed him. Transformed into a demon, Illidan wrapped himself in shadow and utterly destroyed &lt;a href=\"Tichondrius\"&gt;Tichondrius&lt;/a&gt; and his forces. But with victory came devastation. Tyrande and Malfurion sensed the demonic power lurking within Illidan and turned away with disgust and despair. Malfurion chastised his brother, convinced that Illidan had traded his soul for more power. Enraged, Malfurion banished his brother from the forests.\nFeeling his sacrifice and effort were unappreciated, Illidan muttered \"So be it... brother\", and left the night elf lands.\nAllegiances.\nAfter the Legion's defeat, Illidan was visited by &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;, who, while noting Illidan's sketchy track record with the Legion, offered him one final chance to serve them. He told him to seek out the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt;, and destroy it. &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; had grown far too powerful for Kil'jaeden to control and betrayed him, and Illidan was to remove him from the equation; in exchange for more power and magic than he could dream of. He granted him the &lt;a href=\"Orb%20of%20Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Orb of Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; to aid him in this task.\nBy harnessing Gul'dan's enchanted skull, Illidan came to possess the warlock's memories, and a plan came to mind, but he would need allies to help him. He decided to enlist the aid of old friends.\nIllidan had heard only rumors of the Highborne's fate. Illidan cast a powerful spell and called the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; to the surface, calling in some old &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; debts. A group of naga led by &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Vashj\"&gt;Lady Vashj&lt;/a&gt; emerged from the depths and pledged themselves to him. They did not come because of their shared history, nor did they respect his demonic power. They came because the Old Gods willed it. They noticed Illidan and his hunger for power. They sent the naga to aid Illidan in his campaign against the Lich King so that it could spark a new war. If the former night elf became troublesome, the Old Gods could simply command the naga to cut out his fel-corrupted heart.\nThus, Vashj came to lead those who would be known as \"&lt;a href=\"Illidan%27s%20Naga\"&gt;Illidan's Naga&lt;/a&gt;\". But Illidan still had the troublesome warden, &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;, to deal with, as she had persistently chased him all over Kalimdor. Illidan then allied with a group of &lt;a href=\"satyr\"&gt;satyr&lt;/a&gt;s, known as &lt;a href=\"Illidan%27s%20Servitors\"&gt;Illidan's Servitors&lt;/a&gt;, and corrupted some furbolgs. Then he ran to the port of &lt;a href=\"Nendis\"&gt;Nendis&lt;/a&gt; with his naga and satyr minions protecting the way up behind him. Maiev killed the furbolgs and defeated his forces, but when she came to the port, Illidan hijacked a boat and set sail, while a cadre of naga stayed behind to scuttle the ships and ruin all hopes of following him.\nWith the naga swimming in his wake, Illidan came ashore on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 the ruined remains of &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt; (ironically, the same city where Illidan grew up) which Gul'dan and his warlocks had raised twenty years before, and the home of the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;.\nConfrontation on the Broken Isles.\nBut Illidan's servants had not been successful in destroying the boats. Maiev and the Watchers arrived on the Broken Isles shortly after Illidan, and the two forces &lt;a href=\"The%20Broken%20Isles%20%28WC3%20NightElf%29\"&gt;battled&lt;/a&gt; across the watery terrain. Illidan reached the tomb, and Maiev was quick to follow. With Gul'dan's knowledge, Illidan quickly traversed the Tomb and came to the chamber which contained the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Eye of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;. Maiev came upon him as he and Vashj were activating the powerful artifact, and, as vengeance for her imprisoning him for 10,000 years, Illidan used the Eye to bring the Tomb down around her, and then quickly escaped through the underwater passages used by the naga. Though he killed &lt;a href=\"Naisha\"&gt;Naisha&lt;/a&gt; and all the other Watchers within the Tomb, Maiev escaped with her magical abilities. On the surface, Illidan and Maiev battled for supremacy as the Warden sent out a runner to gather reinforcements from &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;.\nMalfurion and Tyrande arrived on the Broken Isles with reinforcements as Maiev's base was being overrun. When they &lt;a href=\"Balancing%20the%20Scales%20%28WC3%20NightElf%29\"&gt;struck back&lt;/a&gt;, Illidan's forces crumbled, but he and his retainers fled before they were seriously harmed. Tyrande pursued them out of the base, and Illidan ensnared her to protect himself, and then warned her not to interfere. He fled across the sea once again. During this battle, Tyrande finally revealed why she had spurned Illidan: too drunk with his rising magical and political power, he had forgotten his own inner strength. Malfurion, despite his increases in power, held on to that strength within him. Armed with this knowledge, Illidan finally came to grips with his feelings.\nIllidan landed on the shore of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, and quickly made his way through the Silverpine Forest to get to &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, where Illidan began to use the Eye of Sargeras to break apart the polar ice cap and destroy &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt;. But he was interrupted by Maiev and Malfurion, and the spell failed. Malfurion had felt Illidan's spell tearing the land apart and concluded that he was a danger to the world and had to be stopped. Illidan, who was entangled by his brother, called Malfurion a fool as he was destroying the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, their common enemy. Malfurion was furious at him for causing the loss of Tyrande, who had been, according to Maiev, killed. Illidan was heartbroken that the woman he loved was dead, but &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Kael%27thas\"&gt;Prince Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt;, the night elves' newest ally, thought that perhaps it was premature to presume her dead. Kael'thas explained that Tyrande had not been \"torn apart\" by the undead, as Maiev had told Malfurion, but had instead fallen into a river and been swept away by the currents. Malfurion immediately arrested the Warden and promptly went in search of Tyrande. Illidan begged to be allowed to help his brother track down the beloved priestess. Illidan and his personal guard of naga found Tyrande under heavy attack from a massive undead force.\nIllidan and his naga battled their way through the undead until they reached her. Tyrande was taken aback by Illidan's service to her, and when he delivered her safely to Malfurion, she was astonished. Malfurion told Illidan he was free to go on the condition that he never threaten the night elves again. Illidan, wishing for an end to the conflict with his brother, agreed.\nEscape to Outland.\nAfter Malfurion let him go, Illidan created a portal to &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; by using a small rift left behind from the portal &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; had used to summon &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; into Azeroth. He fled immediately, being pursued by Maiev. Now that he had failed to destroy Ner'zhul, he knew that Kil'jaeden's wrath would not spare him, so Illidan wanted to find a world where he could remain unmolested. He felt that Outland, the ruined remains of Draenor, was just such a place.\nIllidan was chased down on the shattered world until he was captured by Maiev and the Watchers, and imprisoned once again. But he was saved by &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; and Vashj. Illidan promised Kael a way sate his people's magical addiction and in return, Kael pledged his people's allegiance to him. Illidan accepted the allegiance of the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;, and made Kael his second-in-command. The Sin'dorei, coupled with the naga, would be very invaluable to his plans. Illidan continued his original plan - to rid Outland of demonic influence so that he could stay out of Kil'jaeden's grasp. To do this, they laid siege to the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Magtheridon\"&gt;Magtheridon&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"pit%20lord\"&gt;pit lord&lt;/a&gt; who had taken control of the world. But first, Illidan systematically shut down his dimensional gates to stem the flow of reinforcements. Eventually, they succeeded.\nWhen they came to the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt;, Illidan was approached by &lt;a href=\"Akama\"&gt;Akama&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Broken\"&gt;Broken&lt;/a&gt;, who pledged the allegiance of his race. Akama's broken felt indebted to Illidan and his army for aiding them in their fight against the fel orcs of Magtheridon, who had laid siege to their village with the intent of slaughtering them all. They laid siege to the Black Temple and destroyed Magtheridon's defenses, and then defeated the Pit Lord in battle himself. Magtheridon noted wryly that Illidan had great power, and asked if the Legion had sent him as a test. Illidan laughed, saying that he was not a test, but a replacement, and imprisoned Magtheridon beneath &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Citadel\"&gt;Hellfire Citadel&lt;/a&gt; and kept sealed in place by the fel orc jailor &lt;a href=\"Keli%27dan%20the%20Breaker\"&gt;Keli'dan the Breaker&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe march on Icecrown.\nAs Illidan rallied the forces of Outland under a new banner, a storm of fire and smoke descended upon the Black Temple, and Kil'jaeden appeared in all his unholy glory. Chastising Illidan for his foolhardy attempts to flee his wrath, Illidan quickly claimed that he had been gathering his forces for a second attack on the Frozen Throne. Kil'jaeden, seeing that Illidan's new comrades \"showed \"some\" promise\", agreed to give Illidan one more chance to appease the demons.\nKil'jaeden did not realize Illidan's capture of the Black Temple was an act against the Legion itself. Demons were conniving creatures that were known to betray each other for greater power. Kil'jaeden thought Illidan to be his servant that had claimed Outland as a personal prize, which Kil'jaeden would allow him to keep if Illidan destroyed the Lich King. However, if Illidan refused, Kil'jaeden threatened to do everything in his power to retake the broken world from Illidan and destroy him. Illidan feigned his thoughts and allegiance before Kil'jaeden once more and agreed to destroy the Lich King. He used one of the many portals on Outland and crafted a new gateway back to Azeroth. He took a portion of his army, leaving Akama to secure Outland, arrived to Northrend and began marching on Icecrown Citadel.\nIllidan, Vashj, and Kael laid siege to Northrend and battled &lt;a href=\"Anub%27arak\"&gt;Anub'arak&lt;/a&gt;'s forces as they trudged through the snow towards the Icecrown glacier. But Ner'zhul, knowing he would be overrun if he didn't do something, called Arthas to Northrend to complete the plan he had set in motion so many months before. Finally, Illidan's forces arrived at Icecrown as Arthas and Anub'arak dug their way out of &lt;a href=\"Azjol-Nerub\"&gt;Azjol-Nerub&lt;/a&gt;, and the two factions squared off in a titanic &lt;a href=\"A%20Symphony%20of%20Frost%20and%20Flame\"&gt;battle&lt;/a&gt; as they tried to gain control of the four mystical obelisks surrounding the glacier. After a long battle, and control going back and forth between the two enemies, Arthas activated all obelisks, and the doors to the Frozen Throne were opened.\nBut Illidan was not finished yet. Meeting Arthas at the glacier's base, he was warned by Arthas to leave Azeroth and never return. Illidan cited that he promised Kil'jaeden that the Frozen Throne must be destroyed, only for Arthas to reply coldly that he will never succeed. Then, the two warriors engaged in single combat at the &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Bones\"&gt;Court of Bones&lt;/a&gt;. After a few minutes of exchanging blows, however, Arthas overcame Illidan's defenses and cut him down. Illidan fell in the snow, badly wounded. Rather than finish him off, Arthas took his leave. After his victory, Arthas took from Illidan the dagger &lt;a href=\"Stormfury%2C%20Black%20Blade%20of%20the%20Betrayer\"&gt;Stormfury, Black Blade of the Betrayer&lt;/a&gt; as a trophy.\nAs it became clear for Vashj and Kael that they could not destroy the Frozen Throne, they retreated, eventually back to Outland, taking Illidan with them.\n\"Note that the in-game animation between Illidan and Arthas was originally planned to be a video cinematic. Time constraints, however, forced the scene to be done inside the game. The developers have said that their greatest regret about this change is that many assumed Illidan died, when the video would have revealed that Illidan survived to watch Arthas' transformation.\"\nThe Lord of Outland.\nFollowing his fight with Arthas, Illidan fled to the shattered remains of Draenor (now known simply as Outland). Quickly gathering his followers, he soon declared himself Lord of Outland. According to the manual included with the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt; expansion, Illidan was fully aware that Kil'jaeden had not forgotten his failure to destroy the Frozen Throne. Anticipating the Legion's retaliation, and convinced that another offensive against Azeroth was not far behind, Illidan began to take drastic steps to prepare himself for a defensive stand. Beneath the Black Temple, Illidan began the creation of a new &lt;a href=\"fel%20orc\"&gt;fel orc&lt;/a&gt; army of his own, using the blood of the imprisoned &lt;a href=\"Magtheridon\"&gt;Magtheridon&lt;/a&gt;. As he continued to fortify the temple, his allies worked to ensure that all portals to Outland remained tightly sealed, buying Illidan even more time to strengthen his power base.\nIn order to further cement his authority over Outland and its residents, Illidan ordered &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Vashj\"&gt;Lady Vashj&lt;/a&gt; to seize control of the water reserves of the shattered realm. Vashj's naga forces quickly moved to begin draining the lakes and seas of &lt;a href=\"Zangarmarsh\"&gt;Zangarmarsh&lt;/a&gt;, consolidating as much as they could within the &lt;a href=\"Coilfang%20Reservoir\"&gt;Coilfang Reservoir&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually &lt;a href=\"Illidan%27s%20Naga\"&gt;Illidan's Naga&lt;/a&gt; privatized the Coilfang Reservoir, keeping it under heavy guard and at the expense of the previous denizens of the marsh.\nMeanwhile, Akama had grown increasingly frustrated over Illidan's refusal to relinquish control of the Black Temple (formerly known to Akama's people as the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Karabor\"&gt;Temple of Karabor&lt;/a&gt;). In addition to his army of fel orcs, Illidan had begun training an army of &lt;a href=\"demon%20hunter\"&gt;demon hunter&lt;/a&gt;s \u2014 imbued with the same demonic powers as Illidan himself and wielding warglaives similar to his own. This army would come to be known as the &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt;. Believing that Illidan's work with the fel orcs \u2014 whose kin Akama had fought against for so long \u2014 and the fel rituals undergone by the Illidari served only to defile the Temple further, Akama began to secretly conspire with Maiev Shadowsong in an attempt to free Outland from Illidan's grasp. It was not long, however, before Illidan discovered Akama's betrayal. Rather than kill the Broken warrior for his treachery, Illidan chose instead to &lt;a href=\"Shade%20of%20Akama\"&gt;bind a portion&lt;/a&gt; of Akama's soul into his service; ensuring that Akama could still be used in the future for Illidan's own purposes.\nAzgoth's demise.\nAt some point, Illidan led his new army of demon hunters in an assault on a demonic world ruled by the &lt;a href=\"annihilan\"&gt;pit lord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Azgoth\"&gt;Azgoth&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 the first confrontation between the Illidari and the Legion. As he was preparing his troops for the assault, a night elf by the name of &lt;a href=\"Kor%27vas%20Bloodthorn\"&gt;Kor'vas Bloodthorn&lt;/a&gt; stepped forward, knelt, and openly asked Illidan what made the Illidari \u2014 who had demonic energies coursing through their veins and gnawing at their every thought \u2014 different from the monsters they fought against. Although some of her comrades chided her for questioning Illidan as he approached the uncertain demon hunter, Illidan opted to remain silent for the time being. With the open portal still raging behind him, and the clock ticking on their assault, Illidan then began rallying the assembled Illidari, proclaiming to them that they would not be guilty of the same mistakes he believed the citizens of Azeroth to be - rather than wait to become bystanders as the Legion washed across one world after another, they would instead go on the offensive, hunting the Legion wherever it lingered before its endless armies had a chance to strike.\nThe demon hunters charged headlong into the portal to Azgoth's domain, easily picking their way past the unaware &lt;a href=\"Felguard\"&gt;felguards&lt;/a&gt; defending the demonic citadel until they finally burst through the monstrous door to Azgoth's chamber. During the ensuing battle with Azgoth, however, Illidan was wounded by the pit lord's enormous flail. As the annihilan was about to finish the Betrayer, Kor'vas leaped forward and shattered the flail's chain with her warglaive. Barely fazed, the annihilan stunned her with a massive backhand, and trapped her up against a wall with his tusks, taunting the freshly-minted Illidari by preying upon her fears that she might succumb to the demonic forces raging within her. Defiantly, Kor'vas simply sneered and replied \"Never\", holding the pit lord's attention as Illidan, recovered from Azgoth's blow, launched himself into the air and impaled the pit lord from behind with the Twin Blades of Azzinoth, instantly killing him.\nAfter the battle, Illidan approached Kor'vas again, this time addressing her concerns from before, although the battle had already done more than enough to serve as a perfect answer to her questions:\nSatisfied with her answer, Illidan gathered up the Illidari, lauding their performance during the battle as they returned triumphantly to their stronghold in Outland.\nThe destruction of Nathreza.\nAt Illidan's command Akama would ultimately trick Maiev into leading her forces into an ambush, with Maiev being the only survivor. During this attack Illidan would use the souls of the departed - both Maiev's soldiers and his own, including the Ashtongue - in order to open a portal to &lt;a href=\"Nathreza\"&gt;Nathreza&lt;/a&gt;. Illidan and his demon hunters slaughtered Nathreza's defenders, entered the dreadlords' citadel, and breached the archives. After securing the record containing the location of &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;, Illidan destroyed the remaining records and retreated with his demon hunters back to &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. Once through the portal, Illidan collapsed its spellwork and directed all of the resulting energy - enough to devastate an entire continent - into Nathreza; he believed that if his calculations were correct, the backlash had shattered Nathreza in much the same way that &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; had been shattered into Outland. It was the single greatest defeat the Legion had suffered in millennia, and the demons who died on Nathreza were slain forever.\nHowever, all actions have consequences, and the Legion was now clearly aware of the threat that Illidan posed and would learn from spies from within the Illidari that Illidan planned to launch a similar assault on Argus. Seeking to put an end to Illidan, the Burning Legion decided to attack the forces of Azeroth, and lure them into entering Outland. Once within the shattered realm, the Horde and Alliance would begin striking against both the Legion and the Illidari. Kil'jaeden would manipulate his enemies into fighting each other, and when they were weakened from the battle he planned to destroy them all.\nIllidan, who had become increasingly obsessed with his mission to destroy Argus would seem to care for nothing else. However, he would become personally involved with the heroes of Azeroth at different occasions such as when they would defeat the &lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Sigil\"&gt;Crimson Sigil&lt;/a&gt;, where he would challenge them and boast that not even Arthas could stop him. This would seem that Illidan was slipping further into madness (he himself would wonder if he was insane) or that he considered 'defeat' to mean death which would make him technically right. Such nuances of logic are common with Illidan, often employed when defending his actions to others.\nIllidan would also appear to Azeroth's heroes where he would reveal that the so-called new Highlord of the Dragonmaw was in fact a spy and ordered their death. Though the actions of the nether dragon &lt;a href=\"Yarzill\"&gt;Yarzill&lt;/a&gt; would spare their lives and while the nether dragons were convinced that the Dragonmaw would come to an end from Illidan's wraith, they remained within the Illidari and were one of the defending forces of the Black Temple.\nMaster of the Black Temple.\nConsumed with nothing but his mission to plot the downfall of Argus, Illidan had lost all interest in holding onto Outland. This attitude wouldn't change until the eve of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt;'s fall when Illidan witnessed the flow of the battle and understood at once that this clash of the Legion's enemies was what &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; had anticipated. The Betrayer ordered the Illidari Council to retreat and prepare for battle, freshly resolved to both win this battle and finish his own personal strike at the Legion's heart. Illidan, however, was still focused on his larger goal. However, he realized that he did not have enough time to open the portal to &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt; with the adventurers coming for him and would need to refocus his efforts elsewhere. To that end, he dispatched a force of his most prominent and powerful demon hunters to the planet &lt;a href=\"Mardum\"&gt;Mardum&lt;/a&gt; in search of the &lt;a href=\"Sargerite%20Keystone\"&gt;Sargerite Keystone&lt;/a&gt;, an artifact with the power to open portals to an endless number of demon worlds - even to Argus itself.\nIt was during this time that Illidan would finally take note of the broken leader Akama's absence. Unbeknownst to Illidan, Akama had been working to aid the heroes of Azeroth, and on the eve of the battle, freed Illidan's old nemesis Maiev Shadowsong from captivity. Their combined forces, including notable figures such as &lt;a href=\"Kanrethad%20Ebonlocke\"&gt;Kanrethad Ebonlocke&lt;/a&gt;, would then assault the Black Temple. The distraction of this assault was intended to allow a number of champions, along with Akama and his &lt;a href=\"Ashtongue%20Deathsworn\"&gt;Ashtongue Deathsworn&lt;/a&gt;, to slip in, secure the temple, and eventually challenge the Betrayer himself.\nAlthough Illidan soon begins to overpower the gathered adventurers, Maiev reappears and makes her move during the battle, releasing the adventurers just as one of Illidan's spells has trapped them, and joining in as the battle resumes. She makes several references to the pain Illidan has caused her, from forcing her to guard his prison for 10,000 years by committing his crimes, to causing the death of &lt;a href=\"Naisha\"&gt;Naisha&lt;/a&gt;. In the end, when Illidan is near death, Maiev haughtily remarks that he is beaten. As he dies, however, Illidan reminds her that 'the huntress is nothing without the hunt'. Illidan relives his memories, recalling &lt;a href=\"Kur%27talos%20Ravencrest\"&gt;Kur'talos Ravencrest&lt;/a&gt; horrified at him sacrificing the &lt;a href=\"Moon%20Guard\"&gt;Moon Guard&lt;/a&gt; for power and &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt; telling him that the path of a druid requires sacrifice, something which Illidan did not understand. The last thing Illidan sees is Tyrande, whose name he whispers as the lights in his eyes fade.\nMaiev ordered his corpse to be brought to the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20the%20Wardens\"&gt;Vault of the Wardens&lt;/a&gt; on the Broken Isles, determined to force Illidan's undying demon soul to suffer the rest of his sentence for eternity. As the wardens prepared to transport his body, however, the Illidari who had been dispatched to Mardum returned through a portal from their successful mission to retrieve the &lt;a href=\"Sargerite%20Keystone\"&gt;Sargerite Keystone&lt;/a&gt;. Learning of their master's fate, the demon hunters attacked, cutting through the briefly-disoriented wardens, until Maiev was able to disable and imprison them by turning the very power they relied on against them. On Maiev's order, the Illidari were transported along with Illidan to the Vault, where she intended to keep them locked away for eternity.\nAfter Illidan's defeat, Akama claimed the Black Temple, vowing to fill its halls with light once again.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nA vision of Illidan appeared as part of the quest &lt;a href=\"The%20Hunter%20and%20the%20Prince\"&gt;The Hunter and the Prince&lt;/a&gt; during a recreation of the duel between Illidan and &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; at the gates of &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt;.\nA \"memory\" of Illidan could be summoned by &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Confessor%20Paletress%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Argent Confessor Paletress&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Trial%20of%20the%20Champion\"&gt;Trial of the Champion&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nIn Felwood, adventurers were able to relive Illidan's talk with &lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the moment he obtained the &lt;a href=\"Skull%20of%20Gul%27dan\"&gt;Skull of Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;, and finally his battle with &lt;a href=\"Tichondrius\"&gt;Tichondrius&lt;/a&gt;, where they would help him against the dreadlord.\nWhile visiting the past through the &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt;, he made an appearance in the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Well of Eternity dungeon&lt;/a&gt; and aided heroes in the battle against Mannoroth and Varo'then.\nRevelations of the Past.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Pursuing%20the%20Black%20Harvest\"&gt;Pursuing the Black Harvest&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"scenario\"&gt;scenario&lt;/a&gt;, it was revealed that Illidan had in his possession an untapped store of raw arcane energy in the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Lost%20Souls\"&gt;Shrine of Lost Souls&lt;/a&gt;. With arcane power of that magnitude, he was able to bind many demons to his service by offering them to sate their thirst for magic from that place instead of &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt;, in exchange for their loyalty. In that way, he was able to gain the support of many demons and freed some of the addiction to fel magic.\n&lt;a href=\"Kanrethad%20Ebonlocke\"&gt;Kanrethad Ebonlocke&lt;/a&gt; believed that this source of power was what Illidan intended to give the blood elves to free them from their addiction, as he had with the demons. But for some reason, possibly knowledge of Kael'thas's betrayal, Illidan never let them near it.\nLegion.\nAfter the fall of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt;, the corpse of Illidan was taken by &lt;a href=\"Warden\"&gt;Warden&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20the%20Wardens\"&gt;Vault of the Wardens&lt;/a&gt; so that Illidan's dark, lingering soul could suffer the rest of his eternal sentence\u2014along with his followers, the feared &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Cordana%20Felsong\"&gt;Cordana Felsong&lt;/a&gt; led the from an alternate universe to the Vault of the Wardens where Illidan's corpse was being imprisoned, as he was the key to Azeroth's downfall by the Legion. Although confronted by Maiev and several of Illidan's demon hunters freed from their prisons, Cordana and Gul'dan escaped with Illidan's body. Gul'dan brought Illidan's body to &lt;a href=\"Black%20Rook%20Hold\"&gt;Black Rook Hold&lt;/a&gt;, where he conducted a ritual to separate his soul from his body. Illidan's soul was then sent into the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;. The prime naaru &lt;a href=\"Xe%27ra\"&gt;Xe'ra&lt;/a&gt; seeks Illidan and believes he is the \"child of Light and Shadow\" destined to end the age of demons. The remaining Illidari on board the \"&lt;a href=\"Fel%20Hammer\"&gt;Fel Hammer&lt;/a&gt;\" contacted Illidan's soul within the Twisting Nether, where Illidan revealed that &lt;a href=\"Akama\"&gt;Akama&lt;/a&gt; knew his plans to defeat the Burning Legion and tasked the Illidari with convincing him to rejoin their cause, as well as retrieving the &lt;a href=\"Sargerite%20Keystone\"&gt;Sargerite Keystone&lt;/a&gt; from wherever the &lt;a href=\"Wardens\"&gt;Wardens&lt;/a&gt; hid it. Upon being discovered by the demons, Illidan announced that the Illidari would not be able to contact him like this again and named a demon hunter &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; as their new leader in his place before fleeing his pursuers.\nGul'dan sought to use Illidan's body as a vessel for Sargeras' spirit, and so Xe'ra and the Illidari planned to return Illidan's soul to his body before it was too late. &lt;a href=\"Allari%20the%20Souleater\"&gt;Allari the Souleater&lt;/a&gt; constructed a soul prism that would store Illidan's soul long enough to transfer him inside &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Heart\"&gt;Light's Heart&lt;/a&gt;. However, Illidan's soul had been stolen out of the Nether and pulled into &lt;a href=\"Helheim\"&gt;Helheim&lt;/a&gt;. Xe'ra and the Illidari speculated that Gul'dan had struck a deal with &lt;a href=\"Helya\"&gt;Helya&lt;/a&gt; to retrieve and keep it there. After the death of Helya, his soul was put into the soul prism and then brought to Light's Heart which seemingly consumed it. Light's Heart, with Illidan's soul inside, was brought to &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Archmage Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; with instructions to call forth the vessel's power when Gul'dan attempts to open the portal for Sargeras in order to release Illidan's soul into his body.\nWithin the &lt;a href=\"Nighthold\"&gt;Nighthold&lt;/a&gt;, Khadgar attempts to do as he was instructed. But unbeknownst to Khadgar, Sargeras has already filled Illidan's empty shell, and doing so awakens him. The adventurers then battle &lt;a href=\"The%20Demon%20Within\"&gt;The Demon Within&lt;/a&gt;. After Sargeras is defeated, Illidan takes control of his body and kills Gul'dan the same way Gul'dan killed &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, ripping him apart with fel energy until only his &lt;a href=\"Skull%20of%20Gul%27dan\"&gt;skull&lt;/a&gt; remains. He then crushes it with his hand and turns to the assembled fighters, telling them that now they know what they face, they should follow him into the abyss.\nLegionfall.\nIllidan arrives late to the &lt;a href=\"Assault%20on%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;second battle at the Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, prompting Maiev to snark that her wardens are doing all the work while his demon hunters play with their &lt;a href=\"felbat\"&gt;felbat&lt;/a&gt;s, before &lt;a href=\"Prophet%20Velen\"&gt;Prophet Velen&lt;/a&gt; tells both of them to stop arguing.\nIllidan and Maiev work together to travel to the top of the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Eternal%20Night\"&gt;Cathedral of Eternal Night&lt;/a&gt; and use the &lt;a href=\"Aegis%20of%20Aggramar\"&gt;Aegis of Aggramar&lt;/a&gt; there. They bicker throughout the dungeon, and Illidan aids in the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Mephistroth\"&gt;Mephistroth&lt;/a&gt;. After Mephistroth's defeat and the activation of the Aegis, an echo of &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardian of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt; who created the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, appears and reveals that said echo was placed there by Aegwynn in case the wards on the tomb failed. She explains that the Pillars of Creation can restore her wards and that the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Aman%27thul\"&gt;Eye of Aman'thul&lt;/a&gt; can destroy the &lt;a href=\"Felstorm\"&gt;Felstorm&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the tomb itself, Illidan explains that few understood his use of the naga to obtain the Eye of Sargeras, but was a necessary tactic to secure the future of Azeroth. As the class order hall leaders return to the main floor of the ruins, Khadgar remarks to his &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;mentor's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;mother&lt;/a&gt; (a projection of her) that they will find Kil'jaeden and put an end to his plans and this time they won't fail. Illidan said it was a bold claim, but added that victory requires more than courage alone. Illidan elaborated that the armies of the Alliance and Horde had many moments of courage yet ultimately, their armies ended up slaughtered during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for the Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;. Illidan warned that the Deceiver will manipulate everyone's fears and doubts and use it against them.\nWhile adventurers battled the &lt;a href=\"Fallen%20Avatar\"&gt;Fallen Avatar&lt;/a&gt;, Illidan, Khadgar, and Velen faced Kil'jaeden. When Kil'jaeden retreated to his &lt;a href=\"Legion%20ship\"&gt;Legion ship&lt;/a&gt;, Velen rushed through his portal in pursuit as Khadgar tried to stop him. Illidan encouraged Velen's initiative and tells Archmage Khadgar that sealing the portal alone would be futile. Whether it took years or even a millennia, the Legion would eventually return as many times as they are able. They must make use of this opportunity to seize their fate and use the portal to follow Kil'jaeden into the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;; for it was the only way to kill a demon. If they fall, they will take the Deceiver with them. Upon Kil'jaeden's death, his ship began to crash on Argus. Illidan used the Sargerite Keystone to open a rift between Argus and Azeroth, allowing Khadgar to teleport them safely to &lt;a href=\"Azsuna\"&gt;Azsuna&lt;/a&gt;. Upon their return to Azeroth however, it was revealed that Illidan had left the rift from Azeroth to Argus open, and Argus became visible on Azeroth's sky. Khadgar, horrified, asked Illidan what he had done, and Illidan responded that sometimes the hand of fate must be forced.\nHe also defended the Broken Isles against the &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Assaults\"&gt;Legion Assaults&lt;/a&gt;, directing &lt;a href=\"class%20order\"&gt;class order&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt;.\nArgus.\nIllidan traveled to the \"&lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt;\" on &lt;a href=\"Azuremyst%20Isle\"&gt;Azuremyst Isle&lt;/a&gt; in order to board the \"&lt;a href=\"Vindicaar\"&gt;Vindicaar&lt;/a&gt;\", a new &lt;a href=\"dimensional%20ship\"&gt;dimensional ship&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; created to go to Argus. Once there, Illidan privately confronted Velen about his faith; how he had allowed &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; to corrupt &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; and Kil'jaeden, and allowed the Legion to take Argus, and through it all did nothing, all the time believing he was following the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;'s will. When Illidan told Velen that his people's blood was on his hands, Velen snapped that Illidan would never understand what he did to save his people, to which Illidan replied that the Light was holding him back and Velen should forge his own path. At this time, &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Artificer%20Romuul\"&gt;Grand Artificer Romuul&lt;/a&gt; arrived and told Velen that the \"Vindicaar\" was ready for its trip to Argus.\nAfter arriving above &lt;a href=\"Krokuun\"&gt;Krokuun&lt;/a&gt;, Illidan was at first dismissive of the &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Army of the Light&lt;/a&gt; as they were nowhere to be found. When the \"&lt;a href=\"Xenedar\"&gt;Xenedar&lt;/a&gt;\" appeared soon after the \"Vindicaar\"'s arrival, it was quickly shot down by the Burning Legion and Azeroth's forces rallied to begin the final battle for Argus. During the initial push onto Argus, Illidan helped bring down the &lt;a href=\"Antaen%20Light-Breaker\"&gt;Antaen Light-Breaker&lt;/a&gt; that had shot down the \"Xenedar\" and warned Velen to be wary of the local &lt;a href=\"Broken\"&gt;Broken&lt;/a&gt;'s loyalties.\nWhen Xe'ra, restored through the efforts of &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, and an adventurer, attempted to fulfill the destiny she had seen for Illidan through the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;, Illidan rejected her. Illidan stated that he had traded his freedom for power before. As the two got into an argument about Illidan embracing the Light and whether his destiny was his own, Xe'ra even bound Illidan in chains of light to force the prophecy to be fulfilled and forge Illidan a new life. Stating that his life was not hers to take, Illidan ultimately broke free, declared his destiny is his own, and killed Xe'ra. Horrified, Turalyon cried that Illidan had doomed them all, called him Betrayer, and attempted to strike him down with the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Royal%20Sword\"&gt;Great Royal Sword&lt;/a&gt;. Illidan blocked Turalyon's blow with his hand, telling him as fel blood leaked down his arm that his faith had blinded him and there was no chosen one--only they could save themselves.\nIllidan and the Illidari set up a base at the &lt;a href=\"Veiled%20Den\"&gt;Veiled Den&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Antoran%20Wastes\"&gt;Antoran Wastes&lt;/a&gt;, north of the Army of the Light's base at &lt;a href=\"Hope%27s%20Landing\"&gt;Hope's Landing&lt;/a&gt;. When asked by Turalyon about the situation, Illidan reported that a direct assault on &lt;a href=\"Antorus%2C%20the%20Burning%20Throne\"&gt;Antorus, the Burning Throne&lt;/a&gt; would be folly due to the Legion's numbers and the unnatural speed with which they replaced fallen demons; some were even strong enough to slow him down, slightly. Breaching the stronghold would require a different plan, and in the meantime he had a sea of demons to slay.\nWithin Antorus, Sargeras left his pets to do some playtime. Illidan tells the heroes to eliminate them for they are one of many more demons to die by their hand. Upon reaching the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Cliffs\"&gt;Broken Cliffs&lt;/a&gt;, he says that striking at the heart of the Legion is futile until we take out their war machines. Unchecked, they will soon overwhelm us. After killing &lt;a href=\"Kin%27garoth\"&gt;Kin'garoth&lt;/a&gt;, Illidan remarks that the Legion is in its death throes. He then tells the heroes to report back to the \"Vindicaar\" to go into the heart of Antorus.\nAt the heart of the Legion's stronghold, the &lt;a href=\"Coven%20of%20Shivarra\"&gt;Coven of Shivarra&lt;/a&gt; are torturing the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; (excluding Eonar and Aggramar). Magni can feel the demons twisting the spirits of them; forcing them to use their might to serve the Legion. Should they fall into darkness, Illidan says, Sargeras will have the power he needs to claim the final titan Azeroth. After Aggramar is defeated and his soul returns to the rest of his brethren, Illidan reminds everyone (Magni included) that our victories mean nothing. So long as Sargeras has the soul of Argus to fuel his infinite army, Azeroth remains in grave peril.\nAfter Argus the Unmaker is defeated, the heroes of Azeroth return home while the Pantheon prepares to imprison Sargeras. Illidan, however, stays behind at the &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20the%20Pantheon\"&gt;Seat of the Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;, saying that the hunter is nothing without the hunt. While Sargeras manages to strike Azeroth in &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;, gravely wounding her, the Pantheon pulls him back and imprisons him at the Seat, appointing Illidan as his jailor.\nMoments of Reflection.\nBefore he left for Antorus, Illidan created a crystal with messages for Malfurion, Tyrande, and the adventurer. After the events at the Seat of the Pantheon, the crystal was found aboard the \"Vindicaar\" and delivered to its recipients. To Malfurion, he spoke of how the teachings of Cenarius were not for him as they were for his brother, and how all the power he sought was not to conquer or rule, but to save Azeroth, despite Malfurion's distrust--though Illidan admitted he did not make it easy for Malfurion to do so. With his fate becoming clear, Illidan wished to finally quiet the strife that had long divided them and entrust the safety of the world to his brother, for there was no one he trusted to face threats more than him. While Malfurion had spent a lifetime fighting for the dream of what Azeroth could be, he now must fight for what it is. With his final words, Illidan asked Malfurion to take care of Tyrande and listen to her counsel, for she was always the best of them. The road ahead would be long, but whatever came, he knew Malfurion would bring honor to the name Stormrage.\nTo Tyrande, he spoke of how all the paths he had taken had led to a single purpose, saving the world; he could bide no half measures or compromises. He told her how whenever he faced doubt, he held on to one anchor: Her. He told Tyrande that she embodied the best of Azeroth with her faith and devotion, and asked her to take care of Malfurion. While he sometimes wished her heart had made a different choice, in the end he knew she made the right one.\nAtop Hyjal, on the shores of the Well of Eternity that he created ages ago, Illidan told the adventurer that they had proven their commitment to Azeroth, that their dedication and sacrifice rivaled his own. With enemies gathering and shadows growing darker, the defense of the world rested with them.\nRelationship between Illidan and Malfurion.\nThe relationship between the Stormrage brothers is noticeably different in \"Warcraft III/The Frozen Throne\" and in the \"War of the Ancients\" Trilogy.\nBy way of comparison, in the novels written by Knaak, Malfurion is more tolerant and forgiving of his brother, who is portrayed as often selfish, reckless, out of control and not completely sane. Rather than becoming part of the \"lynch mob\" who want Illidan summarily executed, Malfurion speaks on his behalf, endorsing his knowledge of the Burning Legion as vital tactical information... giving an undeniable reason to bury Illidan rather than kill him. \nWhen we first were introduced to Malfurion and Illidan in \"Warcraft III\", Malfurion objected fiercely to the idea of freeing Illidan, in the belief that his crimes were unforgivable and that he should stay locked up. When they were reunited Illidan was bitter about how he had been punished and Malfurion was disgusted to be in the same room as Illidan, still nursing a grudge over Illidan's betrayal. Illidan, who seemed to be the more forgiving one at the time, was eager to prove to his brother that the demons had no hold over him. Later, after Illidan used the powers of the Skull of Gul'dan for himself and took on a demonic appearance, Malfurion demanded to know where his brother was, implying he still had some affection for him. After Illidan revealed that he was the demon, Malfurion, rather than killing him simply banished him. Obviously, Malfurion knew &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; would want Illidan imprisoned but still chose not to act. Rather than object, Illidan simply walked away. \nIllidan was next seen in \"Warcraft III: Frozen Throne\". After the two worked together to save Tyrande, Illidan seemed to have forgiven Malfurion for disrupting his attempt to destroy the Frozen Throne, even though it would leave him at Kil'jaeden's mercy. Malfurion's last words to Illidan included an ominous threat about what would happen to him if he ever did anything against the kaldorei again. This too, Illidan accepted without objection. Illidan admitted that he had known only \"ages of hate\" for his brother, but for his part he wished it to end. This is perhaps the closest thing to a peace that the brothers have achieved. Illidan then departed telling Malfurion he doubted they would ever see each other again.\nIn \"World of Warcraft\", Malfurion's words indicate that he does not wish to fight his brother, and he says that if he is forced to, things will not be as they were at the Well at Zin-Azshari.\nAccording to \"&lt;a href=\"Seeds%20of%20Faith\"&gt;Seeds of Faith&lt;/a&gt;\", Malfurion is saddened by Illidan's death in Outland.\nCurrent state.\nFrom &lt;a href=\"Waking%20Legends%23Notes\"&gt;Malfurion's conversation with Remulos&lt;/a&gt;:\nThe exact meaning and implications of this are not known. It is however likely that Malfurion fears that the bonds between him and his brother Illidan will be tested in the near future. For 10,000 years ago, during the War of the Ancients, the two brothers were forced to work together to throw back the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"The%20Sundering\"&gt;The Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, which is when they chose their separate paths.\nQuotes.\nCataclysm.\nWell of Eternity.\nThe shadows will hide us well.\nI am concealed by this shadowcloak, and can imbue its magic onto you.\nIt will not make us invisible, but as long as we keep our distance from our foes we will remain hidden.\nAnything outside of that circle around you will not be able to see you, but the illusion will fade if you attack or take damage.\nI suggest you remain hidden until I say otherwise, these demons are too powerful to face head on and in full force.\nSuch a foolish creature, trying to challenge us.

The fight consists of five phases, and good positioning is the key to success.\nOverview.\nIllidan wields his Warglaives at the start of the encounter, infecting foes with &lt;a href=\"Parasitic%20Shadowfiend\"&gt;Parasitic Shadowfiend&lt;/a&gt;. Upon reaching 65% health, Illidan takes flight and throws the Warglaives of Azzinoth to the ground, each of which unleashes a Flame. The two Flames of Azzinoth must be defeated to bring Illidan to the ground. For the remainder of the encounter, Illidan periodically unleashes the power of the demonic force within him, using those dark powers to assault his foes, before returning to his natural form. At 30% health, Maiev arrives to assist in handling the Betrayer's final efforts to overpower his foes.\nStrategy.\nPreparation.\nIllidan is not a gear dependent fight, it's possible to beat him even with Tier 5 or badge vendor gear on most of the raid, only the tanks really need good gear.\nPhase 1.\nThe fight starts after a lengthy dialogue between Akama and Illidan, as the last line Illidan yells \"You are not prepared!\".\nTanking.\nThe main tank picks Illidan up by simply standing closest to him. Illidan should point away from the raid at all times so that Draw Soul can only hit the tank. Periodically, the tank has to move to get out of Flame Crash.\nRaid.\nEvery 30 seconds a random raid member receives the Parasitic Shadowfiend debuff. The affected player and a mage should move away from the raid. When the Parasitic Shadowfiends spawn, the mage &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Nova\"&gt;Frost Nova&lt;/a&gt;s them and nukes them down quickly (usually with help from some other damage dealers). If the main tank receives the parasite debuff, the melee group must move away. Do not use Frost Nova in this case, just nuke the spawns.\nDraw Soul is frequently cast right after a Flame Crash. The only player affected should be the tank. Keep the debuffs from &lt;a href=\"Mortal%20Strike\"&gt;Mortal Strike&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wound%20Poison\"&gt;Wound Poison&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Aimed%20Shot\"&gt;Aimed Shot&lt;/a&gt; up to reduce the amount of healing Illidan receives.\nAt 90%, Illidan calls for the help of his minions, but they simply get killed by Akama. At 65%, Illidan takes off into the air, starting Phase 2.\nPhase 2.\nIllidan is immune to all attacks while flying. About 10 seconds after taking off, he throws his two Warglaives of Azzinoth to the east and west sides of the grill/circle pattern on the ground, where they remain fixed. Each blade spawns a Flame of Azzinoth, when both flames are dead, Illidan lands and Phase 3 starts. This phase is the most difficult of the whole encounter, therefore all DPS enhancing cooldowns (&lt;a href=\"Heroism\"&gt;Heroism&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Bloodlust\"&gt;Bloodlust&lt;/a&gt; etc.) should be used as soon as the tanks have solid aggro on the Flames.\nPositioning.\nThe two off-tanks each pick up one of the flames. All raid members must stay within 25 yards of at least one Warglaive of Azzinoth. At the same time, the raid must spread out to minimize the damage taken from Illidan's Fireballs. To maximize the effectiveness of &lt;a href=\"Chain%20Heal\"&gt;Chain Heal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Circle%20of%20Healing\"&gt;Circle of Healing&lt;/a&gt;, it's a good idea to set up in several tightly clustered groups.\nThe simplest method is to use three groups, spread out at the points of a triangle. Setups with four or even five groups are possible too - in all cases, the raid must take care to set up outside the Eye Beam paths (see below). A setup with five groups results in a cross pattern - one group in the exact center of the circle, and one N, E, S, W, each 6 yards away from the center group. A four group setup leaves away the center group.\nMelee damage dealers can try to follow one of the flames, but this incurs the danger of \"bridging\" two groups, so that the Fireballs again deal more damage than necessary. For this reason, it's safest to assign the melee damage dealers to one group and keep them at their place, only attacking a Flame when it moves close enough. With experience, raids can work out a technique to allow the melee damage dealers some movement.\nTanking.\nEach tank must keep his Flame faced away from the raid at all times, while at the same time staying close enough to the Blades of Azzinoth. This is most easily accomplished by staying in the area between the two circles. Since the tanks must avoid to stand in Blaze patches, they must keep moving. The result is the following 'kite path': Initially both flames are pulled to the northern (or southern) end of the circle, and then moved around the border towards the south, one tank along the eastern semicircle, the other along the west.\nEye Beam has only four possible paths, each intersects one of the Blades and tangentially touches the inner circle (either north or south). The actual AoE is about 2 yards wider than the graphic. Therefore only tanks and melee damage dealers have to take care. One player should constantly keep an eye on Illidan and announce whether he's flying over the east or west side (so that the tank on that side can move away from the two possible Eye Beam traces). Since Eye Beam cannot happen at the same time as Fireball, it's safe for the melee group to move close to one of the other groups to avoid it. If players get separated from the Flame by the residual (blue) fire from Eye Beam, they should wait until they're at full health and then dash through the fire.\nHealing.\nThe Flame tanks need two healers each, the remaining 4-5 healers heal the raid. About 80 seconds into the phase and every 40 seconds thereafter, Illidan puts a Dark Barrage on a random raid member. There is nothing to do about it than heal through. Since neither Fireballs nor Eye Beams can happen during a Dark Barrage, all raid healers have to immediately start spam healing the Barrage target. Fast reaction is crucial if the target cannot use a damage avoiding ability like &lt;a href=\"Feign%20Death\"&gt;Feign Death&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Block\"&gt;Ice Block&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Shield\"&gt;Divine Shield&lt;/a&gt; etc.\nDuring Phase 2 no combat or self rez should be used, since upon rezzing players may be susceptible to charge (even though being close enough to a Blade).\nPhase 3.\nAfter both Flames are dead, Illidan lands, starting Phase 3. Any combat rezzes should be performed at this point. Until he reaches 30% health, he switches between Phases 3 and 4 every 40\u201350 seconds. When below 30%, he switches between Phases 5 and 4. Each phase switch is an aggro reset, therefore &lt;a href=\"misdirection\"&gt;misdirection&lt;/a&gt; should be used on each switch and DPS should be careful for the first few seconds. His abilities in Phase 3 are the same as in Phase 1, with the addition of Agonizing Flames. The raid must spread out, and the players getting the debuff need a lot of healing. Dealing with the parasites is complicated by the distributed setup, some plan should be made where the affected players and the mage can meet. This can be done by setting up one mage to each side of the raid, and have parasited raid members run away towards the sides.\nPhase 3 lasts ~40\u201355 seconds, at which point Illidan turns into a Demon (Phase 4). If he reaches 30% health, Phase 5 starts. The transition to phase 5 should always happen during a Phase 3, because the raid is positioned correctly.\nPhase 4.\nIllidan kneels down and casts The Demon Within, turning him into a Demon. A warlock with maxed &lt;a href=\"shadow%20resistance\"&gt;shadow resistance&lt;/a&gt; should tank him. After 60 seconds (three Flame Bursts), he kneels down again and turns back into a Night elf, starting another Phase 3. Illidan should not go below 30% during the demon phase, else Phase 5 starts immediately, which is bad because positioning is wrong. Therefore slow DPS when he gets close to 30% in phase 4.\nPositioning.\nFrom the point where Illidan kneels down, the warlock tank should set up quite a distance away in one direction, while the melee group should move far away in the other direction (melee cannot DPS Illidan during this phase, as Shadow Blast and Aura of Dread make it impossible to move into range). Shamans and Hunters should keep &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Trap\"&gt;Frost Trap&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Earthbind%20Totem\"&gt;Earthbind Totem&lt;/a&gt;s up between Illidan and the raid. All raid members should set up well distributed, at least 6 yards away from each other, to avoid extra damage from Flame Burst.\n&lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Demon\"&gt;Shadow Demon&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe shadow demons spawn is always followed closely by a Flame Burst, so players must wait for the burst before they move out of position to kill them. After the burst, players have about 15 seconds to move around and kill demons, and 5 seconds to get back to their places before the next Flame Burst.\nIt's a good idea to place all &lt;a href=\"AoE\"&gt;AoE&lt;/a&gt; capable damage dealers within AoE range of Illidan, so that they can AoE the demons right when they spawn, while they're still snared. Mages should use &lt;a href=\"Blizzard\"&gt;Blizzard&lt;/a&gt;, and warlocks can use &lt;a href=\"Seed%20of%20Corruption\"&gt;Seed of Corruption&lt;/a&gt; on Illidan 15 seconds before the spawn. If the AoE is performed well, it's possible to kill all the Demons within a few seconds after they spawn, this has the additional advantage that nobody needs to move out of position.\nIf a demon targets the warlock tank, this demon must be killed very quickly. A rogue can use &lt;a href=\"sprint\"&gt;sprint&lt;/a&gt; and burn all cooldowns to increase damage done when reaching the demon.\nPhase 5.\nWhen Illidan is at 30% health or below, the raid gets imprisoned for 30 seconds and a small cut-scene takes place, and the fight continues with Phase 5. Illidan still switches to Phase 4 every 60 seconds, but from now on, Phase 5 replaces Phase 3. Phase 5 is very similar to Phase 3, except that he &lt;a href=\"Enrage%20%28mechanic%29\"&gt;enrage&lt;/a&gt;s after 40 seconds (attack speed and damage increased, soft enrage). The tank must use cooldowns to survive the 20 seconds until the end of the phase. One plan is to use &lt;a href=\"Shield%20Wall\"&gt;Shield Wall&lt;/a&gt; on the first enrage, and &lt;a href=\"Last%20Stand\"&gt;Last Stand&lt;/a&gt; plus trinkets on the second.\nAdditionally, Maiev Shadowsong enters the battle. Two times per Phase 5 cycle she semi-randomly places a special demon trap on the ground that can be used against Illidan. The tank needs to drag Illidan towards the trap, click to activate it, and position Illidan on top of it. While trapped, Illidans damage taken is increased by 100% and he loses his enrage buff. When the trap expires, a transition to Phase 4 starts immediately.\nUsing the demon trap is dangerous, because it may severely disturb positioning, and incur other complications like raid members taking extra damage from Agonizing Flames, loose Parasites, or the tank turning his back to Illidan and taking Shear. Therefore only experienced raids should use the traps to speed up the encounter.\nFirst kills (prior to patch 3.0.2) by raids with about 4 members having the full &lt;a href=\"Tier%206\"&gt;Tier 6&lt;/a&gt; bonus and most of the others wearing at about two pieces of Tier 6, typically experienced the following phase sequence: 1,2,3,4,3,4,3,5,4,5,4,5, the whole fight taking about 16 minutes.\nSoloing.\nOdd as it may seem, Illidan is actually one of the easier solo encounters in Black Temple, being little more than a normal DPS race. The only mechanic to watch for is the flame enrage in phase 2. Other than that, Illidan is easily dispatched.\nQuotes.\nThe time has come to face Illidan, &lt;name&gt;. Are you ready?\nBe wary, friends. The Betrayer meditates on the court just beyond."}

Under the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Slayer&lt;/a&gt;'s leadership it changed to include &lt;a href=\"Broken\"&gt;Broken&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"shivarra\"&gt;shivarra&lt;/a&gt; forces, and various factions that have banded together under the Betrayer's rule.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;Invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt;, the Illidari were one of the prime enemies of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, the other being the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. From the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt;, Illidan commanded vast armies throughout &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, and even a few select groups on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, organizing his forces in their war to end the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;. However, after Illidan's death at the Black Temple, many of the demon hunter survivors were imprisoned by &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20the%20Wardens\"&gt;Vault of the Wardens&lt;/a&gt;, along with the corpse of their master.\nYears later, during the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the freed Illidari regathered with the forces left behind on &lt;a href=\"Mardum%2C%20the%20Shattered%20Abyss\"&gt;Mardum&lt;/a&gt;, and seized control of the \"&lt;a href=\"Fel%20Hammer\"&gt;Fel Hammer&lt;/a&gt;\", which became their &lt;a href=\"Order%20Halls\"&gt;order hall&lt;/a&gt;. Under the leadership of the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Slayer&lt;/a&gt;, Illidan's right arm in his absence, the Illidari fought against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; alongside the other &lt;a href=\"Class%20Order\"&gt;class orders&lt;/a&gt;, united as the &lt;a href=\"Armies%20of%20Legionfall\"&gt;Armies of Legionfall&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nOver the course of &lt;a href=\"Illidan\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt;'s career as one of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s most prominent heroes or villains, he had amassed various followers, servitors, and allies. Those that have flocked under Illidan's banner were enticed with either promises of power, vengeance, or were subjugated by Illidan himself. Most prominent of Illidan's followers were Illidan's &lt;a href=\"demon%20hunter\"&gt;demon hunter&lt;/a&gt; apprentices. Originally, Illidan trained &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; outcasts who became demon hunters to fight the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Frozen Throne.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; confronted Illidan and made him an offer he could not refuse. Kil'jaeden was angered by &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt;'s defeat at &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, but he had bigger concerns than vengeance. Sensing that his creation, the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, was growing too powerful to control, Kil'jaeden ordered Illidan to destroy &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; and put an end to the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; once and for all. In exchange, Illidan would receive untold power and a true place amongst the remaining lords of the Burning Legion. Illidan agreed and immediately set out to destroy the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt;, the icy crystal cask in which the Lich King's &lt;a href=\"ghost\"&gt;spirit&lt;/a&gt; resided. Illidan knew he needed allies to accomplish his tremendous task so he cast a powerful spell and called the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; to the surface, calling in some old &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; debts. A group of naga led by &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Vashj\"&gt;Lady Vashj&lt;/a&gt; emerged from the depths and pledged themselves to him. They did not come because of their shared history, nor did they respect his demonic power. They came because the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s willed it. They noticed Illidan and his hunger for power and sent the naga to aid him in his campaign against the Lich King so that it could spark a new war. If the former night elf became troublesome, the Old Gods could simply command the naga to cut out his fel-corrupted heart.\nIllidan's attempts to destroy the Scourge ended in failure however, and Illidan retreated to Outland in order to escape Kil'jaeden's wrath. He then began a campaign to oust &lt;a href=\"Magtheridon\"&gt;Magtheridon&lt;/a&gt; from power in Outland, in order to become the shattered planet's new lord. He bolstered his forces by recruiting Prince &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Sunfury\"&gt;Sunfury&lt;/a&gt;, and later trained some of them to become demon hunters, now serving him as his personal special ops army against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. His forces later discovered a surviving &lt;a href=\"Broken\"&gt;Broken&lt;/a&gt; village who were also fighting against the Burning Legion. The village's inhabitants, ruled by &lt;a href=\"Akama\"&gt;Akama&lt;/a&gt;, swore allegiance to Illidan in return for him liberating them from orcish and demonic oppression. Ever since then, the elite Broken tribe that was Akama's &lt;a href=\"Ashtongue%20tribe\"&gt;Ashtongue tribe&lt;/a&gt; were officially aligned with Illidan, and consisted of the most vicious and bloodthirsty individuals, handpicked by Akama himself.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nDespite the naga's original motivations, Vashj remained loyal to Illidan until she was slain by adventurers when they invaded her lair in &lt;a href=\"Serpentshrine%20Cavern\"&gt;Serpentshrine Cavern&lt;/a&gt;. Even after Vashj's death, &lt;a href=\"Lady%20S%27theno\"&gt;Lady S'theno&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 captain of the &lt;a href=\"Coilskar%20tribe\"&gt;Coilskar tribe&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 had taken command of &lt;a href=\"Illidan%27s%20Naga\"&gt;Illidan's Naga&lt;/a&gt; and have maintained their loyalty to Illidan and the Illidari. Under the command of Vashj, the naga began to enslave the tribes of the &lt;a href=\"Broken\"&gt;Broken&lt;/a&gt; in an effort to bolster the naga's workforce and further their agenda in Outland. Nearly all of the &lt;a href=\"Wastewalker%20tribe\"&gt;Wastewalker tribe&lt;/a&gt; has been captured and put to work to drain the waters of &lt;a href=\"Zangarmarsh\"&gt;Zangarmarsh&lt;/a&gt;. The plan was to take control of all the waters of Outland, and through them, its people.\nMists of Pandaria.\nDuring their travel through &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s &lt;a href=\"Kanrethad%20Ebonlocke\"&gt;Kanrethad Ebonlocke&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jubeka%20Shadowbreaker\"&gt;Jubeka Shadowbreaker&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20the%20Black%20Harvest\"&gt;Council of the Black Harvest&lt;/a&gt; sought the secret of how Illidan was able to control &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s while not being a servant of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. They later discovered that the Betrayer used the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Lost%20Souls\"&gt;Shrine of Lost Souls&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt;, which feed his army of Illidari unbound demons in exchange for their service, freeing them from the addiction of &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; magic.\nLegion.\nAfter numerous campaigns against the Burning Legion in Legion-controlled worlds, their last successful mission was to retrieve the &lt;a href=\"Sargerite%20Keystone\"&gt;Sargerite Keystone&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Mardum\"&gt;invasion of Mardum&lt;/a&gt;. When they returned, however, they found Illidan had fallen during the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;Sha'tar's assault on the Black Temple&lt;/a&gt;. The Illidari demon hunters were imprisoned by &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; and her &lt;a href=\"warden\"&gt;warden&lt;/a&gt;s who were waiting for them when they returned to Outland. However, during the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, Maiev freed the demon hunters so that they would contribute to Azeroth's defense. The freed demon hunters had then reformed the Illidari as their demon hunter &lt;a href=\"Class%20Order\"&gt;class order&lt;/a&gt; and have taken command of Illidan's remnant forces in order to continue their crusade against the Burning Legion.\nDespite Akama's conspiracy to overthrow Illidan during the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt;, the Ashtongue tribe appear to have maintained their allegiance to the Illidari and have fought for them during the third invasion of the Burning Legion under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Battlelord%20Gaardoun\"&gt;Battlelord Gaardoun&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the disastrous &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for the Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; mourned the deaths of &lt;a href=\"High%20King\"&gt;High King&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt;. During the funerals of the Alliance and Horde's deceased leaders, Illidari envoys discovered a plot by &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s masquerading as guards to ambush the gathered faction leaders during their time of mourning. The Illidari revealed these demon assassins and aided the Alliance and Horde in repelling the ambush. For their service, the Alliance and Horde welcomed the Illidari as allies in the war against the Burning Legion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20Campaign\"&gt;Argus Campaign&lt;/a&gt;, members of the Illidari traveled to Argus and to the invasion points.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nWhile it is unknown what became of the Illidari after the Legion's fall, at the time of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the demon hunter &lt;a href=\"Marius%20Felbane\"&gt;Marius Felbane&lt;/a&gt; and his associate &lt;a href=\"Tehd%20Shoemaker\"&gt;Tehd Shoemaker&lt;/a&gt; tracked down a demon named &lt;a href=\"Syrawon%20the%20Dominus\"&gt;Syrawon the Dominus&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt;, hinting at the possibility that the Illidari continue to pursue the remaining demons on Azeroth.\nComposition.\nThe &lt;a href=\"demon%20hunter\"&gt;demon hunter&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe most elite of Illidan's armies are his &lt;a href=\"demon%20hunter\"&gt;demon hunter&lt;/a&gt; servitors, &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; trained to be the Betrayer's mightiest enforcers, the bane of demonkind. Zealously loyal to their master, the Illidari demon hunters have a strong identity and a close bond, although their heavy fel corruption and demonic techniques have inspired dread in their fellow elves. Prominent demon hunters took control of Illidan's depleted armies after their master's defeat at the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt;, and lead the remaining Illidari as they seek out their leader and battle the Burning Legion.\nAccording to the Slayer's choice, their foremost lieutenant is either &lt;a href=\"Altruis%20the%20Sufferer\"&gt;Altruis the Sufferer&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Kayn%20Sunfury\"&gt;Kayn Sunfury&lt;/a&gt;. The Illidari's motive for seeking out their master will change depending on whom the adventurer chooses as their right-hand-man: Altruis, no longer loyal to Illidan, desires new leadership for the Illidari; Kayn, loyal to Illidan's cause, wishes to rescue him from his predicament.\nIllidari demon hunters.\nThe Illidari Demon Hunters were the top &lt;a href=\"demon%20hunter\"&gt;demon hunter&lt;/a&gt;s serving Illidan as part of the forces under his command. The four (three &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; and one &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elf&lt;/a&gt;) trained &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Hunter%20Initiate\"&gt;initiates&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Hunter%20Supplicant\"&gt;supplicants&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Karabor\"&gt;Ruins of Karabor&lt;/a&gt;. They were named &lt;a href=\"Varedis%20Felsoul\"&gt;Varedis Felsoul&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alandien\"&gt;Alandien&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Netharel\"&gt;Netharel&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Theras\"&gt;Theras&lt;/a&gt;.\nA fifth demon hunter at Illidan's service, &lt;a href=\"Leotheras%20the%20Blind\"&gt;Leotheras the Blind&lt;/a&gt;, does not hold the title of \"&lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt; Demon Hunter\", apparently because he went insane during the training that killed three of his fellow trainees.\nIllidan's Forces.\nThe main group of Illidari that are explicitly labeled as such seem to serve as an elite group within the overall faction. This group is composed mostly by demons of many species, particularly &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sayaad\"&gt;sayaad&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"terrorguard\"&gt;terrorguard&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"felguard\"&gt;felguard&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"satyr\"&gt;satyr&lt;/a&gt;, former minions of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; who switched their allegiance after the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Magtheridon\"&gt;Magtheridon&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey dwell primarily in &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Valley\"&gt;Shadowmoon Valley&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt; though a few &lt;a href=\"Illidari%20Taskmaster\"&gt;Illidari Taskmaster&lt;/a&gt;s can be found in &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Illidari%20Taskmaster\"&gt;Illidari Taskmaster&lt;/a&gt;s who dwell in the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Sha%27naar\"&gt;Ruins of Sha'naar&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; lord over the &lt;a href=\"Dreghood\"&gt;Dreghood&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Broken\"&gt;Broken&lt;/a&gt; as they search for one of the seven &lt;a href=\"Ata%27mal%20crystal\"&gt;Ata'mal crystal&lt;/a&gt;s. In &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Valley\"&gt;Shadowmoon Valley&lt;/a&gt;, Illidari appear to serve as front-line foot soldiers against the &lt;a href=\"Sha%27tar\"&gt;Sha'tar&lt;/a&gt; as they bring the war against Illidan to the steps of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Illidan%27s%20Naga\"&gt;Illidan's Naga&lt;/a&gt;.\n &lt;a href=\"Naga\"&gt;Naga&lt;/a&gt; - Calling in some old Highborne debts from ten millennia earlier, Illidan raised the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; from their undersea lairs in order to aid him in obtaining the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Eye of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, as well as preventing Maiev from following him. Under the direction of Lady Vashj - The naga followed Illidan into Outland where they were instrumental in both obtaining the aid of the blood elves and laying siege to Magtheridon's fortress. They now control the watery areas of Outland, including much of &lt;a href=\"Zangarmarsh\"&gt;Zangarmarsh&lt;/a&gt;.\n &lt;a href=\"Mur%27gul\"&gt;Mur'gul&lt;/a&gt; - The naga enslaved many mur'gul to act as both warriors and slaves.\nIllidari &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;.\nThough Kael betrayed Illidan and now serves , some blood elves are still loyal to the Betrayer, such as the &lt;a href=\"demon%20hunter\"&gt;demon hunter&lt;/a&gt; initiates under , the elite demon hunters under , and the &lt;a href=\"Eclipsion\"&gt;Eclipsion&lt;/a&gt; - Blood elves under .\nIllidari &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s.\n &lt;a href=\"Demons\"&gt;Demons&lt;/a&gt; - Magtheridon, as a servitor of the Burning Legion, took control of Outland and brought legions of demonic forces with him. When Illidan toppled &lt;a href=\"Magtheridon\"&gt;Magtheridon&lt;/a&gt;, many of these demons swore allegiance to the new lord of Outland. Illidan's demons are free of their natural magic addiction, and the usual &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; taint seen alongside the Burning Legion is not present with them. Illidan's shivarra, under &lt;a href=\"Mother%20Shahraz\"&gt;Mother Shahraz&lt;/a&gt; in the Black Temple, now follow &lt;a href=\"Matron%20Mother%20Malevolence\"&gt;Matron Mother Malevolence&lt;/a&gt; in continued service to the Illidari. The types of demons that are seen in the Illidari are:\n&lt;a href=\"Illidan%27s%20Servitors\"&gt;Illidan's Servitors&lt;/a&gt;.\n &lt;a href=\"Satyr\"&gt;Satyr&lt;/a&gt; - A group of &lt;a href=\"satyr\"&gt;satyr&lt;/a&gt;s under Illidan, apparently brought by Illidan to Outland when he left &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. The bulk of them were killed by &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. Notable members are &lt;a href=\"Zandras\"&gt;Zandras&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ambassador%20Jerrikar\"&gt;Ambassador Jerrikar&lt;/a&gt;.\nIllidari &lt;a href=\"Broken\"&gt;Broken&lt;/a&gt;.\n &lt;a href=\"Broken\"&gt;Broken&lt;/a&gt; -The Betrayer obtained the aid of &lt;a href=\"Akama\"&gt;Akama&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Broken\"&gt;Broken&lt;/a&gt; draenei sometime before the siege of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt;. The Broken proved to be proficient &lt;a href=\"assassin\"&gt;assassin&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"scout\"&gt;scout&lt;/a&gt;s, and were able to allow Illidan and his army to reach Magtheridon. Though only the Broken of Akama's tribe serve Illidan willingly (though the same cannot be said of Akama himself), Illidan's forces in Hellfire Peninsula and Zangarmarsh have enslaved Broken for menial labor. Tribes working for Illidan:\n&lt;a href=\"Fel%20Horde\"&gt;Fel Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\n &lt;a href=\"Fel%20orc\"&gt;Fel orc&lt;/a&gt;s - When &lt;a href=\"Illidan\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt; invaded Outland, &lt;a href=\"Magtheridon\"&gt;Magtheridon&lt;/a&gt;'s primary non-demonic forces were &lt;a href=\"fel%20orc\"&gt;fel orc&lt;/a&gt;s, corrupted by his own blood. Led by &lt;a href=\"Kargath%20Bladefist\"&gt;Kargath Bladefist&lt;/a&gt;, the fel orcs are now in the Betrayer's service and primarily man the battlements of &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Citadel\"&gt;Hellfire Citadel&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, members of the Shadowmoon clan could be found on the Ata'mal Terrace of Illidan's Black Temple, and the survivors of the Dragonmaw clan \u2014 under their aged chieftain, &lt;a href=\"Zuluhed%20the%20Whacked\"&gt;Zuluhed the Whacked&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 captured and took control of &lt;a href=\"nether%20drake\"&gt;nether drake&lt;/a&gt;s for service in Illidan's armies.\nFormer allies.\n&lt;a href=\"Sunfury\"&gt;Kael'thas' forces&lt;/a&gt;.\n &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas\"&gt;Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;Blood elves&lt;/a&gt; - Illidan was briefly captured by his long-time jailor and nemesis, &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;, shortly after arriving in Outland. It was primarily due to the intervention of &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; and his blood elves that allowed the naga under &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Vashj\"&gt;Lady Vashj&lt;/a&gt; to free him. The blood elves under Kael's command, having been scorned by the Alliance, swore allegiance to Illidan and aided him in toppling Magtheridon. The Betrayer's most trusted legion of blood elf warriors is known as the &lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Sigil\"&gt;Crimson Sigil&lt;/a&gt;; they are the highest commanders of the Illidari outside of the Black Temple itself. \n&lt;a href=\"Gronn\"&gt;Gronn&lt;/a&gt;.\n &lt;a href=\"Gruul%20the%20Dragonkiller\"&gt;Gruul the Dragonkiller&lt;/a&gt; and his seven sons allied with the Illidari, though to what extent is unclear.\n&lt;a href=\"Lost%20One\"&gt;Lost One&lt;/a&gt;.\n &lt;a href=\"Lost%20One\"&gt;Lost One&lt;/a&gt;s - A few corrupted tribes of Lost Ones can be found serving Illidan and his allies. Other tribes seem to have been enslaved. \nIn the RPG.\nAfter the failed assault on the Frozen Throne, the blood elves remained in Illidan's army. They befriended the naga, whom they saw as brothers. Once the Scourge is taken out, they are planning to take over Kalimdor and driving out all the hated races. The naga notably attacked &lt;a href=\"Tol%20Barad\"&gt;Tol Barad&lt;/a&gt; to free the emprisoned blood elf evoker &lt;a href=\"Zae%27Rathis%20the%20Mad\"&gt;Zae'Rathis the Mad&lt;/a&gt;.\nIllidan wanted to create another &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; to fuel his blood elves' &lt;a href=\"magical%20addiction\"&gt;magical addiction&lt;/a&gt;.\nIllidan continues to plot with his generals, working out a new plan of attack. His list of enemies is long: the night elves, the Alliance, and the Lich King himself. He crosses into Azeroth rarely, and only when he is sure his enemies will not spot him. It is not time to attack yet, but the time is coming."}

The fight is comparable to &lt;a href=\"High%20King%20Maulgar\"&gt;High King Maulgar&lt;/a&gt; since it sports a difficult pull and a rather chaotic &lt;a href=\"battle%20for%20survival\"&gt;battle for survival&lt;/a&gt;, which requires high situational awareness and fast reflexes from all raid members.\nBackground.\nThe members of the Illidari Council were among the most talented and powerful &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; led to &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. The prince left them in &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Valley\"&gt;Shadowmoon Valley&lt;/a&gt; to advise and assist his master, &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, while he left for Netherstorm. The council vied for Illidan's favor and frequently schemed against one another, naming themselves the Illidari Council in a mostly ostentatious display, but Illidan acknowledged that they were exceptionally gifted in their respective fields: &lt;a href=\"Gathios%20the%20Shatterer\"&gt;Gathios the Shatterer&lt;/a&gt; in matters of war and logistics, &lt;a href=\"Veras%20Darkshadow\"&gt;Veras Darkshadow&lt;/a&gt; in the realms of espionage and shadowing, &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Malande\"&gt;Lady Malande&lt;/a&gt;'s talent for upholding relations with Illidan's other servitors, and &lt;a href=\"High%20Nethermancer%20Zerevor\"&gt;High Nethermancer Zerevor&lt;/a&gt;'s arcane mastery. The council remained some of Illidan's most steadfast followers even after their own prince's defection to the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. \nOn the eve of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt;'s fall, it was the council who organized much of the resistance against the &lt;a href=\"Sha%27tar\"&gt;Sha'tar&lt;/a&gt; and their allies. Illidan, obsessed with his mission to plot the downfall of Argus, had mostly lost interest in the battle's outcome and had come to view his ruined kingdom on Outland as a sacrifice of little consequence. However, after accompanying the council to the temple's ramparts to observe the flow of battle, he knew this clash of the Legion's enemies was what &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; had anticipated. The Betrayer ordered the Illidari Council to retreat and prepare for battle, freshly resolved to both win this battle and finish his own personal strike at the Legion's heart. With his demon hunters away on &lt;a href=\"Mardum\"&gt;Mardum&lt;/a&gt;, the council were Illidan's last line of defense, and fought to their deaths in his service.\nOverview.\nThe Illidari Council consists of a powerful paladin, rogue, mage, and priest. They share health and bring their iconic abilities to bear against their foes.\nPreparation.\nAll raid members must have at least 11k HP buffed. A rogue wearing &lt;a href=\"Gladiator%27s%20Leather%20Gloves\"&gt;Gladiator's Leather Gloves&lt;/a&gt; is extremely useful (for the ranged physical spell interrupt).\nThe pull.\nSimilar to High King Maulgar, a correct pull is difficult to set up but extremely important. In order of precedence, the mobs should be assigned as follows:\nGnomes can experience line of sight issues when attempting the pull. They need to either go to the top of the platform or change their character model (e.g. with or ).\nPet pull.\nThe critical element is the mage, who may easily die if one of the other bosses attacks him. It's possible to start the fight with an Imp (or other pet), which then takes the first Arcane Bolt. This gives the raid a second or so to get the mobs under control. Of course, the mage tank must give the pet just a split second head start, and gain Aggro on Zerevor (and spellsteal) as quickly as possible.\nTanking.\nLady Malandes heals must be interrupted under all circumstances, and all her other spells should be interrupted as much as possible. Since she's the preferred target of Gathios' blessings, she's invulnerable to one type of damage (physical or magic) most of the time. Therefore a total of four interrupters should stay on her - two physical and two magical. &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Tongues\"&gt;Curse of Tongues&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Deathfrost\"&gt;Deathfrost&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Numbing%20Poison\"&gt;Numbing Poison&lt;/a&gt; are highly recommended. If there's some AoE on her spot and she's blessed vs. magic, the last resort is to have a Rogue wearing the PvP gloves interrupt her by throwing. The group tanking/interrupting her must call out the target if a Divine Wrath gets through so that the raid healers can adjust.\nHigh Nethermancer Zerevors Dampen Magic must be spellstolen as frequently as possible. Everybody must keep at least 10 yards away from him to avoid arcane explosion.\nGathios the Shatterer is the main DPS target. The main tank should use spell reflect when the Seal of Command is Judged (this happens in regular intervals). The melee damage dealers must be extra careful never to attack him from the front since an increase of his attack speed (after a parry) can mean near-instant death for the MT. This is particularly difficult because if there's some AoE taking place, the tank has to move. The best practice is to stop melee until Gathios stands still in his new location.\nAggro (on Gathios) is not an issue, because the spell reflects create a lot of threat. After the second reflected Judgement, all damage dealers can safely ignore their threat meters and go all-out.\nAfter a Vanish, Veras temporarily ignores his aggro list, until he's hit again by the tank. A druid or paladin tank is, therefore, better suited for this task than a warrior. If a warrior must tank him, it's highly advisable to set up a macro that follows an Intercept or Intervene directly with an Autoattack.\nHealing.\nTwo healers on the main tank, one on each of the three other tanks, remaining healers on raid heal. The whole raid has to watch out for a lot of different AoE effects. There are about six different types of AoE and debuffs which can occur, and there is nothing predictable. Raid members must be very quick to run out of AoEs, and healers must be extremely alert to heal through some poison debuff or other damage while evading AoEs themselves.\nSoloing.\nThis is probably the most difficult encounter in Black Temple to solo, as Lady Malande's heals can effectively mean the player has to do a few million more damage than the Council's starting health to secure a kill. Even when reduced to 1 hit point, Malande and/or Gaithos can still cast a heal before the player lands the killing blow, which can lead to some frustrating moments. The best strategy seems to be to focus on Gathios, blowing all cooldowns at the start. As the player gets close to a kill, he/she needs to put up DOTs or AOEs on Gaithos so as to greatly increase the chances that the player will get in one final damaging blow before Malande gets off a heal at 1 hit point. It is also helpful if the player does the encounter on the platform where the Council starts since any AOEs will hit at least two other members and lower their life pool more quickly as well as make landing the killing blow easier.\nTips.\nOne tactic that can help your tank locate Veras Darkshadow after a vanish is to have a hunter make a spamable macro to mark Veras before he reappears. This should put a big red arrow over Veras about 3 seconds before he reappears.\n /focus Veras Darkshadow \n /cast [target=focus, exists] Hunter's Mark"}

They are not widespread, and live on the fringes of &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilnean&lt;/a&gt; society.\nBackground.\nIn the early days of humanity and its civilization, many &lt;a href=\"tribe\"&gt;tribe&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s had primitive belief systems that incorporated simple nature &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;, practicing crude forms of &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;ism and &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;ism. However, the rise of organized &lt;a href=\"religion\"&gt;religion&lt;/a&gt; such as the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt; and the potent &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; magics introduced by the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; quickly supplanted such traditions. &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;, due to its relative isolation, retained a degree of their ancient culture in the contemporary era. The religious leaders of what was in Gilneas referred to as the \"old ways\" eventually became \"harvest-witches\", those who used their nature powers to augment Gilneas' agricultural output during and following its period of industrialization.\nDue to the presence of harvest-witches in their culture, when Gilneans learned about &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; druids (albeit through second, third and even fourth-hand sources) they became fascinated by them and their exotic connotations, to the point where many started referring to harvest witches as \"druids\", though this was quite far from the truth, as few Gilneans had any idea what a druid actually was. Harvest-witches have a limited control over nature, especially plant life, and the powers of harvest witches bear a coincidental resemblance to the low-level abilities of actual druids.\n&lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;King Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; had heard that \"druidism\" was practiced among some of Gilneas's agrarian folk, but he hadn't been exposed to it until recently. Indeed, the Gilnean \"druids\" were driven to the edge of extinction once before, but when famine struck Gilneas and their crops failed, the keepers of the old ways called upon the earth's blessing and restored the harvest.\nHarvest witches who contracted the &lt;a href=\"worgen%20curse\"&gt;worgen curse&lt;/a&gt;, which was druidic in origin, found that their powers were somewhat amplified, and after making first contact with the night elves, cursed harvest witches were offered induction into the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; for both study and training. &lt;a href=\"Birch%20Tomlin\"&gt;Birch Tomlin&lt;/a&gt; refers to himself as a druid as well as being referred to as a harvest-witch, meaning the two have likely become synonymous."}

The &lt;a href=\"%3APet%20Reaper%200.9\"&gt;:Pet Reaper 0.9&lt;/a&gt; was the earliest model developed of which later versions would be inspired by. The &lt;a href=\"Foe%20Reaper%204000\"&gt;Foe Reaper 4000&lt;/a&gt; was the official model that would be sent out in the land of Westfall and it can still be found roaming the area to this very day. When the Defias Brotherhood re-emerged, they used the schematics of the Foe Reaper 4000 to create the &lt;a href=\"Foe%20Reaper%205000\"&gt;Foe Reaper 5000&lt;/a&gt;. Even though the Foe Reaper 5000 was dismantled, the few parts that remained were combined together to create the &lt;a href=\"Foe%20Reaper%2050\"&gt;Foe Reaper 50&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Old%20MacDonald\"&gt;Old MacDonald&lt;/a&gt; also owns a &lt;a href=\"Foe%20Reaper%20800\"&gt;Foe Reaper 800&lt;/a&gt;; though it is unknown how it relates to the other models.\nIn the RPG.\nGoblins created the first harvest golems to serve as guardians, setting the constructs to patrol the fields of Westfall. The goblins' first attempts were too effective; the golems killed so quickly and ruthlessly that no victims remained to spread tales of the horrifying guardians. Goblin tinkers thus hamstrung one of their creations just long enough for a survivor to spread the word. Within weeks, the fields of Westfall stood empty save for their silent, shambling caretakers. Harvest golems have since spread to other territories, leaving fear and mutilated corpses in their wake.\nA harvest golem poses as a simple scarecrow long enough for its victims to enter partial charge range. It then charges, utilizes its backstab ability to rip the throat out of its nearest opponent. While mindless, a harvest golem possesses a degree of innate cunning a touch above that of most golems, modifying its tactics somewhat in response to its enemies' attacks. A harvest golem never retreats.\nA harvest golem seems a simple scarecrow, but a crafter must lace its innards with sachets of expensive powders and ground herbs. In addition, the caster inscribes animating runes inside the golem's fabric body, which requires a rare ink made of powdered arcanite."}

{"id": "24448", "revid": "39299307", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=24448", "title": "Haste", "text": "Haste is a secondary &lt;a href=\"attribute\"&gt;attribute&lt;/a&gt; that increases &lt;a href=\"attack%20speed\"&gt;attack speed&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"ranged%20attack%20speed\"&gt;ranged attack speed&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"casting%20speed\"&gt;casting speed&lt;/a&gt;. It also increases these attributes for the player's pets, increases the regeneration rate of some resources, and increases the tick rate of most of the player's &lt;a href=\"damage%20over%20time\"&gt;damage over time&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"heal%20over%20time\"&gt;heal over time&lt;/a&gt; effects. Spell haste also reduces the length of the &lt;a href=\"global%20cooldown\"&gt;global cooldown&lt;/a&gt; for spells and some melee abilities.\nPrior to patch 6.0.2, Haste occurred in a number of forms. Each of these forms of haste were displayed separately on the &lt;a href=\"character%20sheet\"&gt;character sheet&lt;/a&gt; - under Melee, Ranged and Spell, respectively. Melee haste increased &lt;a href=\"attack%20speed\"&gt;attack speed&lt;/a&gt;; Ranged haste increased &lt;a href=\"ranged%20attack%20speed\"&gt;ranged attack speed&lt;/a&gt;; and Spell haste increased &lt;a href=\"casting%20speed\"&gt;casting speed&lt;/a&gt;, reduced &lt;a href=\"cast%20time\"&gt;cast time&lt;/a&gt;, and reduced the global cooldown. As of patch 6.0.2, these categories have been merged, and all sources of haste now affect all 3 categories simultaneously and equally.\nAttack speed and ranged attack speed increase the rate at which melee and ranged auto-attacks are dealt, respectively. This can increase the frequency and damage output of the player's auto-attacks. This can in turn increase procs from effects such as &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Parasite\"&gt;Blood Parasite&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sudden%20Death\"&gt;Sudden Death&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href=\"Procs%20per%20minute\"&gt;PPM&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Real%20PPM\"&gt;RPPM&lt;/a&gt; enchants, trinkets, and effects. Casting speed effectively reduces the cast-time of spells. This can allow casters to heal or deal damage more quickly. Non-spell cast-time abilities such as &lt;a href=\"Steady%20Shot\"&gt;Steady Shot&lt;/a&gt; also benefit from haste, with reduced cast times. \nAlthough their haste attributes are frequently unlisted, pets also benefit from haste, increasing their attack or casting speed. Pets are also affected short-term haste buffs like &lt;a href=\"Bloodlust\"&gt;Bloodlust&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Heroism\"&gt;Heroism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mark%20of%20Warsong\"&gt;Mark of Warsong&lt;/a&gt;.\nHaste also increases the rate at which players passively regenerate &lt;a href=\"energy\"&gt;energy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rune%20system\"&gt;runes&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"focus\"&gt;focus&lt;/a&gt;. By increasing the rate of melee auto-attacks, haste can also increase the rate at which &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s and Guardian &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s generate &lt;a href=\"rage\"&gt;rage&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpell haste can reduce the length of the &lt;a href=\"global%20cooldown\"&gt;global cooldown&lt;/a&gt;. For most classes, the base GCD is 1.5 seconds, and Haste can reduce it to a minimum of 0.75 second (requiring 100% haste). Reducing the GCD allows players to use their abilities more rapidly, but does not alter the cooldown of individual abilities. Starting in \"&lt;a href=\"Mists%20of%20Pandaria\"&gt;Mists of Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;\", and expanding in &lt;a href=\"Warlords%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Warlords of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, many core class abilities now have their cooldowns reduced by haste (ex. &lt;a href=\"Crusader%20Strike\"&gt;Crusader Strike&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Riptide\"&gt;Riptide&lt;/a&gt;). The cooldown of these haste-scaling abilities will be colored green in the in-game tooltip.\nHaste also increases the tick rate of &lt;a href=\"damage%20over%20time\"&gt;damage over time&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"heal%20over%20time\"&gt;heal over time&lt;/a&gt; effects. As of patch 6.0.2, all DoT and HoT effects scale with haste. By increasing a periodic effect's tick rate, the effect's damage or healing is dealt more quickly. With sufficient haste, additional ticks will also be added, increasing the effect's output and efficiency considerably. As of patch 6.0.2, haste's effect on periodic effects has changed considerably from previously. Periodic effects now always have the standard duration for that effect, regardless of haste levels. All periodic effects can be refreshed when less than 30% of their original duration remains with no \"clipping\" or duration loss (the full normal duration is simply added to the remaining duration, up to a maximum of 130% of the base duration). In addition, haste ticks no longer have breakpoints. When a periodic effect with a duration unequal to a precise multiple of the tick interval expires, a final tick will be dealt equal to the percentage of a normal tick duration that elapsed since the last full tick. For example, if a periodic effect has a duration of 15.0 seconds and due to haste has a tick interval of 2.0 seconds, it will deal 7 ticks at normal damage (14.0 seconds), then deal a final 8th tick for 50% of normal damage. This means that all periodic effects scale, in both DPS and total damage done, in a smooth manner with additional haste, with no breakpoints or jumps in benefit. In addition, like all secondary stats, haste is no longer snapshotted when the periodic effect is cast, and instead the tick interval is dynamically updated on the fly as the caster's haste varies.\nSources.\nHaste can be obtained from a number of different sources, temporary and permanent.\nNegative Haste.\nPlayers can also acquire negative haste, usually from enemy debuffs. As of Patch 6.0.2, players no longer have access to negative haste debuffs, so negative haste now comes exclusively from NPC effects.\nMobs.\nMobs often grant themselves or their allies effects which increase haste. Numerous mobs have an Enrage buff that is activated when their health becomes dangerously low, increasing attack speed. Many bosses also gain haste buffs, such as &lt;a href=\"Shannox\"&gt;Shannox&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Patchwerk\"&gt;Patchwerk&lt;/a&gt;'s Frenzy effects, either during &lt;a href=\"Enrage\"&gt;Enrage&lt;/a&gt; phases or in response to specific events. While some of these effects are &lt;a href=\"dispel\"&gt;dispellable&lt;/a&gt;, many are not.\nCalculations.\nHaste rating.\nHaste stacks in a multiplicative manner. This means that it is beneficial to stack multiple haste effects. Haste rating stacks additively with itself (two sources of 100 haste rating give a total of 200 haste rating when stacked) and is then converted into a percentage (see table below) that stacks in a multiplicative manner with other sources of haste.\nExample.\nA level 100 Frost mage with 1294 haste rating has the &lt;a href=\"Mark%20of%20Warsong\"&gt;Mark of Warsong&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Icy%20Veins\"&gt;Icy Veins&lt;/a&gt; buffs active. \n 1294 + 1000 = 2294 haste rating\n 2294 / 90 = 25.49% haste (1.2549)\n 1.2549 * 1.3 = 1.63 or 63% haste\nAttack and cast time.\nGenerally speaking, haste represents how much more of an activity you can perform in a given time. For example, 100% haste can double DPS/HPS, by allowing the player cast two spells in the time they would be able to cast one without that haste. Casting time and the auto-attack interval are therefore calculated by dividing the weapon or ability's base attack or casting time by the one plus the haste percentage.\nExample.\nThe mage above has just popped his haste cooldowns, temporarily increasing his spell haste to 63%. This allows him to deal 63% more damage or healing in a given time.\n &lt;a href=\"Frostbolt\"&gt;Frostbolt&lt;/a&gt; = 2.0 sec cast time\n 63% haste = 1 + 0.63 = 1.63\n 2.0 / 1.63 = 1.23 sec cast time\nThis reduces the cast-time of 2.0-second spells such as &lt;a href=\"Frostbolt\"&gt;Frostbolt&lt;/a&gt; to 1.23 seconds.\nGlobal cooldown.\nHaste reduces the &lt;a href=\"global%20cooldown\"&gt;global cooldown&lt;/a&gt; (GCD) triggered by spells and certain physical abilities exactly as it reduces the cast time of those effects, but cannot reduce it below 0.75 seconds. The length of the global cooldown can therefore be calculated using the same formula given above.\nFollowing the above example, a mage with a &lt;a href=\"Frostbolt\"&gt;Frostbolt&lt;/a&gt; cast time of 1.23 seconds would have a global cooldown of 1.5 / 1.63 = 0.94 seconds. Should the mage also acquire the &lt;a href=\"Bloodlust\"&gt;Bloodlust&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Heroism\"&gt;Heroism&lt;/a&gt; buff, his haste would be increased by 30%, reducing his Frostbolt's cast time to 1.23 / 1.3 = 0.94 seconds. However, instead of reducing his global cooldown to 0.94 / 1.3 = 0.72 seconds, it would instead only be lowered to the minimum of 0.75 seconds.\nThe amount of haste required to lower the global cooldown to its 0.75 second minimum is 100%. This minimum prevents players from using abilities more often than once per 0.75s, with the exception of abilities that are not on the GCD such as &lt;a href=\"Counterspell\"&gt;Counterspell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pain%20Suppression\"&gt;Pain Suppression&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Charge\"&gt;Charge&lt;/a&gt;. However, this only directly inhibits players' use of instant cast abilities and abilities which have had their cast time pushed below 0.75 seconds, and when combined with &lt;a href=\"pushback\"&gt;pushback&lt;/a&gt;, the availability of longer-cast spells (often serving as higher DPS/HPS or more mana efficient alternatives) and the desire to move in between casts, the minimum GCD does not necessarily prevent additional haste from benefiting the caster, though it may reduce the marginal value of the stat (see Haste Cap, below).\nTips.\nBecause haste stacks in a multiplicative manner, it is generally of maximum benefit for players to use any haste-generating abilities or procs simultaneously. This will produce a larger benefit (measurable in DPS or HPS) than that provided if each is used separately. This is ideal for dealing with emergencies, allowing the player to rise to the occasion by significantly increasing their output on command. Most haste abilities have 2 to 3 minute cooldowns. On the downside, this approach requires the player to choose the right moment to use these abilities, and by placing many of their most powerful abilities on cooldown at once, can leave them without fallback options should events take an unexpected turn.\nSince haste is dynamically updated on the fly for periodic effects, DoT/HoT recasts need not focus on haste procs any longer. However, powerful DoT/HoT abilities that are either cooldown based (eg. &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Hymn\"&gt;Divine Hymn&lt;/a&gt;) or have relatively low uptime (eg. &lt;a href=\"Hand%20of%20Gul%27dan\"&gt;Hand of Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;) will have increased overall potency when used during large temporary haste buffs. In addition, while tick interval for periodic effects updated dynamically, the amount of time required to finished the cast of a cast-time ability is set when the ability begins to cast. This means that beginning a relatively long cast just as a large haste buff expires still retains the full benefit of the haste buff for that cast.\nAs well as increasing DPS/HPS, this can also make certain options more efficient, and therefore desirable. For example, for many Holy priests &lt;a href=\"Renew\"&gt;Renew&lt;/a&gt; is not only fairly slow, but also relatively weak and mana inefficient. By casting Renew while benefitting from haste buffs such as &lt;a href=\"Power%20Infusion\"&gt;Power Infusion&lt;/a&gt;, priests can often add an extra tick to the effect, increasing output and mana efficiency by up to 25%. Since haste does not increase the effectiveness of cast-time abilities, this can shift Renew's place in the healing hierarchy from a slow and relatively inefficient heal to an efficient and desirable option. Saving haste effects for use with &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Hymn\"&gt;Divine Hymn&lt;/a&gt; can increase a priest's healing output significantly, and makes for an excellent emergency cooldown. Since haste increases the total potency of periodic effects while decreasing the time necessary to use them (whether that's a cast time or a GCD), the damage or healer per time spent casting goes up significantly faster for periodic effects than it does for direct damage effects.\nPerhaps the most well-known of all haste buffs are the raid-wide &lt;a href=\"Bloodlust\"&gt;Bloodlust&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Heroism\"&gt;Heroism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Time%20Warp\"&gt;Time Warp&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Hysteria\"&gt;Ancient Hysteria&lt;/a&gt;. With a 5-minute cooldown and a 10-minute debuff, timing and coordination are required to make the most of these powerful buffs. Using them in less than critical moments may not only waste your own cooldown, but also prevent others in your raid from using them when they are needed most.\nHaste cap.\nWhile there is no point at which haste becomes entirely unbeneficial, different classes may find it becomes less valuable at a certain level. In practice, haste is restricted by gear and effects, and does not exceed certain levels outside of special encounters (such as &lt;a href=\"%22Captain%22%20Cookie\"&gt;\"Captain\" Cookie&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Deadmines\"&gt;Deadmines&lt;/a&gt;). The most significant cap for haste is the point at which its acquisition requires the trading of something more valuable, whether a superior talent, or a disadvantageous amount of a critical attribute.\nHaste cannot reduce the &lt;a href=\"global%20cooldown\"&gt;global cooldown&lt;/a&gt; below 0.75 second. Thus, once a player has enough casting speed that all of the abilities they use in combat have a casting time of 0.75 second or less, additional haste rating won't increase their &lt;a href=\"damage%20per%20second\"&gt;damage per second&lt;/a&gt; or healing per second from abilities (even on fights that are too short for &lt;a href=\"mana\"&gt;mana&lt;/a&gt; to become the limiting factor). For some casters, this can be seen as a \"haste cap\". However, even above this point additional haste has its benefits, such as allowing the use of abilities with longer cast times. For example, sufficient haste would allow a priest to use &lt;a href=\"Heal\"&gt;Heal&lt;/a&gt; rather than &lt;a href=\"Flash%20Heal\"&gt;Flash Heal&lt;/a&gt;, saving a large amount of mana. Also, additional haste will still reduce the actual time spent casting, which can be advantageous when making split-second casts, avoiding &lt;a href=\"interrupt\"&gt;interrupt&lt;/a&gt;s or trying to move between casts. When dealing with spell &lt;a href=\"pushback\"&gt;pushback&lt;/a&gt; additional haste can be very useful, potentially granting the caster an effective immunity to pushback, due to 'excess' haste counteracting its effects.\nIn most respects haste does not have a cap; haste rating does not suffer diminishing returns, and most of its effects continue to increase in a linear fashion. For melee types (and hunters), since auto-attack speed does not have a limit, haste will continue to increase DPS, as well as generating additional talent procs and resource generation/regeneration rate. HoTs and DoTs can likewise be extended by several ticks, dramatically improving efficiency, speed and output. Many periodic effects (such as and &lt;a href=\"Vampiric%20Touch\"&gt;Vampiric Touch&lt;/a&gt;) effectively do not have a haste cap, and can be improved with haste to deal damage more than once per second. Some other effects cannot tick faster than every 1 sec, and so effectively have a haste cap of just under 200%, but this is unlikely to be reached very often.\nThe most important question for haste stacking is its relative important to your class, spec and playstyle. Some classes rely heavily on haste to improve their DoTs or their auto-attack speed, while for others it is of minimal importance, and should be avoided wherever possible."}

The council consists of the &lt;a href=\"San%27layn\"&gt;San'layn&lt;/a&gt; princes &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Keleseth\"&gt;Keleseth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Valanar\"&gt;Valanar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Taldaram\"&gt;Taldaram&lt;/a&gt;. The fight is pretty straightforward, with just a few quirks.\nAll of them have been fought and killed by adventurers (Keleseth in &lt;a href=\"Utgarde%20Keep%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Utgarde Keep&lt;/a&gt;, Valanar at &lt;a href=\"Naxxanar\"&gt;Naxxanar&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Borean%20Tundra\"&gt;Borean Tundra&lt;/a&gt;, and Taldaram in ) and brought back to Icecrown Citadel to once again serve the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis encounter was made available January 19, 2010 on US servers and January 20 on EU servers.\nStrategy.\nThe encounter consists of one phase. The 10 minute enrage timer is generous and should not be of any consequence. Three tanks are required, one of them can be a ranged tank (e.g. Warlock).\nAt all times, one of the three princes has Invocation of Blood. The two without the buff have 1 HP and cannot be damaged, only the buffed prince has a proper health score and can take damage.\nInvocation of blood always starts on Prince Valanar (middle), and switches randomly every 30 seconds to another prince.\nAll three princes have rather low armor and thus take high melee damage. &lt;a href=\"DPS%20cooldowns\"&gt;DPS cooldowns&lt;/a&gt; should be used on Keleseth, if the tank has sufficient threat, since he frequently casts Shadow Lance which makes it impossible for him to dodge.\nPrince Keleseth.\nThis prince can basically be tanked by any class with a ranged attack. He does not use any melee abilities, he instead spams Shadow Lance.\nFor this reason, the Keleseth tank must gain shadow mitigation from the Dark Nuclei. These spawn randomly around the room, and the Keleseth tank must grab them to gain the stacking Shadow Resonance buff. Dark Nuclei do not follow the normal aggro table, they instead attack the last player that hit them. Melee aoe abilities do not pull Dark Nuclei off the Keleseth tank (excepting Hammer of the Righteous and Heartstrike). The Dark Nuclei destroy themselves over time, necessitating finding more to keep the shadow resistance buff up. Note that the damage reduction from Dark Nuclei is multiplicative not additive, so even with 6 Nuclei the tank still takes some damage. More than 6 Nuclei is not advisable, since at that point the tank takes more damage from the Nuclei than from Shadow Lance.\nSome 10 player groups have had success using a tanking geared Death Knight, or a Protection Paladin as the ranged tank. The other tank then tanks Valanar and Taladaram. 3 healers can be positioned between the 2 tanks. When Keleseth is empowered, and the ranged tank requires more attention from the healers, the Valanar/Taladaram tank can use a survival cooldown or two, during this time.\nPrince Valanar.\nValanar summons Kinetic bombs so that 2/3 (10/25 player) are up at all times. These Bombs float in the air and slowly move to the floor, upon impact they explode for ~16k damage. Every time they take damage, they float a little upwards. After 1 minute, they despawn.\nTo prevent the bombs from exploding, they must be continually damaged. The easiest method to achieve this is to use a warlock or hunter melee pet. A melee pet set on a bomb just sits below the bomb until it floats low enough, then attacks it until it floats up out of range again. This may fail though when the pet is effectively kicking the bomb up the stairs. They best way to ensure that this does not happen is to position the pet so that the bomb is between the door from which the raid enters the room and the pet, not the pet between the door and the bomb. Using a warlock imp is not optimal either, as the imp may use all its mana and then be unable to keep the bomb up.\nRanged damage dealers can do this too, but this leads to loss of DPS on the bosses. Players thus want to switch from the Bomb to a boss and back, but this can lead to errors (like accidentally targeting Nuclei). Switching on nameplates or using a targeting macro will help avoid these errors.\nSometimes a kinetic bomb glitches and gets stuck in the floor and not go back up, no matter how hard it's being hit. If this is the case, then someone needs to continually beat on the bomb until it dissipates, otherwise it explodes. This tends to happen on the raised stage in the back of the room.\nValanar puts shock vortexes under random raid members, which are preceded by a small white swirl for 1.5 seconds before expanding into a full vortex, knocking back any player that enters it. The white colored vortexes have a radius of approximately 12 yards, persist for about 20 seconds, and should not be approached. Because of the short cast time, not much can be done about this attack.\nWhen he gains Invocation of Blood he casts Empowered Shock Vortex which creates this effect on every player in the room; melee needs to scatter and get away from each other, while the rest of the raid should already be spread out. Players must keep 12 yards away from everyone else to avoid damaging and knocking around other raid members when it goes off.\nPrince Taldaram.\nPrince Taldaram conjures balls of flame which follow a random raid member and explode when they reach their target. When they pass through other players, the damage they do is reduced, down to a minimum of 10k. When Taldaram has Invocation of Blood he launches Empowered Balls of Flame which follow the same mechanism, but deal higher damage, and also damage the players they pass on their way to their target.\nPlayers who are NOT targeted by Empowered Balls of Flame should stick together and stay close to the route of the ball, especially ranged dps. In this way you drain the energy of the Empowered Balls of Flame and that makes it hurt less.\nAlso Priests should avoid fading during this fight while an Orb is in play, as this can cause the Orbs to detarget and change directions. This is especially bad during an Empowered Orb.\nTaldaram also casts Glittering Sparks in a random player's direction so spreading out mitigates that somewhat.\nHeroic Difficulty.\nIn Heroic Mode, the Shadow Prison debuff is added, which does increasing damage to players every second whenever they move or jump. Therefore, all players (except the Keleseth tank) must minimise movement during the entire fight.\nKinetic Bombs are now summoned closer to the ground and drop faster. With the reduced movement, one or two ranged players cannot keep all Kinetic Bombs in the air. Spread ranged players all over the room, and all of are responsible for any Kinetic Bombs in their area. This is especially important when someone in their area is targetted for Empowered Conjured Flame.\nGlittering Sparks now reduces movement speed by 40%. Assign a priest to mass dispel melees when Valanar is empowered so they can run out for Empowered Shock Vortex. A chained Empowered Shock Vortex most likely results in multiple deaths.\nKeleseth also hits much harder in heroic mode. A normal melee tank is therefore recommended over a ranged tank.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}
