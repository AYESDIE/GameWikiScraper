Among the many legendary feats of bravery are the deeds of the exemplars: men and women who strike fear into the hearts of their enemies through intimidation and demoralization. They also inspire courage in their allies, holding their &lt;a href=\"banner\"&gt;banner&lt;/a&gt;s high and charging into battle, shouting encouragement to those who ride beside them.\nTo be an exemplar is to sacrifice a great deal of freedom in pursuit of a path that's narrower than a &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;'s or &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;'s. However, few individuals are as honored as an exemplar, as having a capable exemplar in an army's midst can mean the difference between glorious victory and bloody defeat.\nExemplars carry banners into battle, which are used to guide the movement of troops in mass battles. The banners may depict the emblem of a family, religious sect, adventuring party, town or nation. They are typically made of heavy cloth. The exemplar's conviction strengthens his standard, and by waving his flag and shouting encouragement he can rally his allies to overcome their fear. They are able to carry the standard in one hand, while fighting with a one-handed weapon in the other.\n&lt;a href=\"Paladins\"&gt;Paladins&lt;/a&gt; in particular are fond of this &lt;a href=\"prestige%20class\"&gt;prestige class&lt;/a&gt;, as the honors that are often bestowed on exemplars are compatible with the ideals of the paladin class. The most common source of exemplars is the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;. A few &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s disparage them as \"not being real fighters,\" but most honor their service, including opposing factions (which hunt them down on the battlefield).\nBanners are used to identify and guide the movement of troops in mass battles. They may depict the emblem of a family, religious sect, adventuring party, town or nation. The exemplar is inspiring to his allies and terrifying to his enemies. The exemplar can rally his allies to overcome their fear, he can wave his flag and shout encouragement. All allies within a 120-foot radius can hear the exemplar\u2019s words if he chooses, regardless of the tumult and ambient noise that surrounds him. This ability does not, however, penetrate magic silence effects or other spell-like or supernatural abilities that control sound. The exemplar may hold his &lt;a href=\"faction\"&gt;faction&lt;/a&gt;'s battle standard in one hand, and fight with a one-handed weapon in the other. The exemplar may raise his flag and fill it with a holy light that blinds the enemy. While holding, the exemplar may call upon a mystical force known as the battlewind to share healing with his stricken allies."}

Like other dimensional ships, the Exodar was able to transcend dimensions, and warp time itself but that is no longer the case since the ship is apparently beyond repair and now acts solely as the new home of the draenei on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe faction associated with the city, &lt;a href=\"Exodar%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt;, is named after the ship itself.\nHistory.\nThe &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; helped built the \"Exodar\", with &lt;a href=\"M%27iri\"&gt;M'iri&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"K%27yal\"&gt;K'yal&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"E%27ira\"&gt;E'ira&lt;/a&gt; each designing one district: the &lt;a href=\"Trader%27s%20Tier\"&gt;Trader's Tier&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20Lights\"&gt;Vault of Lights&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Hall\"&gt;Crystal Hall&lt;/a&gt;, respectively.\nAt some point before the present, the &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Army of the Light&lt;/a&gt; was unable to directly assist &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; directly despite hearing their pleas, due to their open war against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt; across the vast cosmos. The naaru, &lt;a href=\"A%27dal\"&gt;A'dal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"M%27uru\"&gt;M'uru&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"O%27ros\"&gt;O'ros&lt;/a&gt;, however, volunteered to aid the people of &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, traversing the stars and arriving in the shattered realm of &lt;a href=\"Netherstorm\"&gt;Netherstorm&lt;/a&gt; with a \"dimensional fortress\" known as &lt;a href=\"Tempest%20Keep\"&gt;Tempest Keep&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"A%27dal\"&gt;A'dal&lt;/a&gt; established &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt;, where it would serve as a sanctuary for the draenei and other peoples resisting the Legion, while M'uru and O'ros remained abroad the Keep. M'uru was soon captured by &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elf&lt;/a&gt; legions assaulted Tempest Keep and captured it, taking possession of its treasures and capturing &lt;a href=\"M%27uru\"&gt;M'uru&lt;/a&gt;, sending him back to &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"magisters\"&gt;magisters&lt;/a&gt; to utilize in their thirst for magic, and later became a boss in &lt;a href=\"Sunwell%20Plateau\"&gt;Sunwell Plateau&lt;/a&gt;, transforming into the corrupt &lt;a href=\"Entropius\"&gt;Entropius&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt;, the courageous prophet who had led the draenei people since their exodus from &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt; millennia before, had hidden himself with his few surviving people in the wake of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt;-instigated orcish onslaught. M'uru yet remained within the Tempest Keep, hiding itself from the blood elves and managing to bar them from entering its wing of the fortress. Sensing its lingering presence, A'dal recommended Velen travel to Azeroth with his people to seek out new allies against the Legion. With the &lt;a href=\"Broken\"&gt;Broken&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Farseer%20Nobundo\"&gt;Farseer Nobundo&lt;/a&gt;, first of the draenei shaman, at his side, the Prophet personally led a raid on Tempest Keep to wrest control of one of its satellite structures, the \"Exodar\".\nThe draenei took control of the \"Exodar\" and used it to escape Outland. The blood elves (possibly aided by the draenei traitor &lt;a href=\"Sironas\"&gt;Sironas&lt;/a&gt;), discovering what the draenei were planning, sabotaged the dimensional engines of the vessel. When the draenei activated it, they escaped Outland and successfully reached Azeroth, but the engine malfunctioned. The crippled ship blazed across the skies of &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Kalimdor\"&gt;Northern Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, crystals flying everywhere, until it crash-landed on a small island chain off the coast of &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;, on the western side of &lt;a href=\"Azuremyst%20Isle\"&gt;Azuremyst Isle&lt;/a&gt;.\nArrival on Azeroth.\nThe survivors took the islands as their new homeland, and set up their new capital in the largest intact portion of the still-smoking ship. The surviving blood elves regrouped and, after scouting the area, summoned reinforcements from Tempest Keep with the &lt;a href=\"Sun%20Gate\"&gt;Sun Gate&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe neighboring &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt; also witnessed their arrival and investigated, soon discovering that the draenei were not enemies. Shortly thereafter, the kaldorei and the other Alliance nations \"unanimously\" welcomed Velen and his people into their ranks, giving them shelter and protection.\nThe draenei established nearby outposts and settlements, including &lt;a href=\"Azure%20Watch\"&gt;Azure Watch&lt;/a&gt;, where they rescued an &lt;a href=\"Injured%20Night%20Elf%20Priestess\"&gt;Injured Night Elf Priestess&lt;/a&gt;, who initially mistook them for their eredar, but later thanked the draenei for helping save her life, beginning a bond between their two long-lived cultures.\nContamination of the Azuremyst Isles.\nThe \"Exodar\"'s crash caused &lt;a href=\"Faintly%20Glowing%20Crystal\"&gt;power crystals&lt;/a&gt; from the \"Exodar\" to break apart from the ship and land on the island, an event the &lt;a href=\"Stillpine%20tribe\"&gt;Stillpine furbolg&lt;/a&gt; call the \"crystal storm.\" These crystals would then be ingested by the nearby &lt;a href=\"Infected%20Nightstalker%20Runt\"&gt;nightstalkers&lt;/a&gt; causing them to become infected with corruption. &lt;a href=\"Exarch%20Menelaous\"&gt;Exarch Menelaous&lt;/a&gt;, from &lt;a href=\"Azure%20Watch\"&gt;Azure Watch&lt;/a&gt;, fearing that the infection will spread if left unchecked assigns young adventures to purge the forests of &lt;a href=\"Nightstalker%20Clean%20Up%2C%20Isle%202...\"&gt;infected cats&lt;/a&gt;.\nNever seen in &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt;, the first &lt;a href=\"Great%20Red%20Elekk\"&gt;red elekk&lt;/a&gt; calves were born in Azeroth after the \"Exodar\"'s arrival. Some breeders theorize that the unique coloration is somehow caused by the same &lt;a href=\"Bloodmyst%20Radiation\"&gt;radiation&lt;/a&gt; which ravaged &lt;a href=\"Bloodmyst%20Isle\"&gt;Bloodmyst Isle&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe long-term effects of the contamination caused by the \"Exodar\" are still under observation.\nProphet's Lesson.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Shattering&lt;/a&gt;, the \"Exodar\" was apparently nearly repaired. According to &lt;a href=\"Romnar\"&gt;Vindicator Romnar&lt;/a&gt; during a meeting of the &lt;a href=\"Hand%20of%20Argus\"&gt;Hand of Argus&lt;/a&gt;, all key systems were repaired, and they were now just cleaning up and bolstering any areas of apparent weakness. He stated they should have The \"Exodar\" up and running, and operational within a week. The Triumvirate of the Hand agreed, and it was decided that unless Velen ordered otherwise, as he isolated himself from everyone, within a week the \"Exodar\" would take flight for old Draenor to rebuild their second home on &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, and assist the &lt;a href=\"Lost%20One\"&gt;Lost One&lt;/a&gt;s remaining behind.\n&lt;a href=\"Vindicator%20Maraad\"&gt;Vindicator Maraad&lt;/a&gt; announced that the dimensional ship was fully repaired, arguing they should take the fight to the Legion, or at least return to Outland and heal their former home. However, Velen replied that the draenei and the \"Exodar\" would best remain on Azeroth, telling their people to each follow their own consciences, but reminding them their war was everywhere, and that \"in service\", the draenei would awaken the people of their new world to stand together against the forces of darkness.\nLegion.\nDuring preparations for the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Voraatios%20the%20Benedictive\"&gt;Voraatios the Benedictive&lt;/a&gt; used &lt;a href=\"Light-Infused%20Crystals\"&gt;Light-Infused Crystals&lt;/a&gt; from the Exodar to enhance the weapons of Alliance champions for the coming battle. The draenei fought alongside the Alliance at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, sending &lt;a href=\"Exodar%20Vindicator\"&gt;Exodar Vindicator&lt;/a&gt;s to bolster their efforts, but they were eventually defeated by the Legion's overwhelming forces.\nAfter the Legion &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Exodar\"&gt;attacked&lt;/a&gt; the \"Exodar\" and destroyed &lt;a href=\"O%27ros\"&gt;O'ros&lt;/a&gt;, Velen ordered &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Artificer%20Romuul\"&gt;Grand Artificer Romuul&lt;/a&gt; to prepare their vessel, declaring that the draenei were going &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;home&lt;/a&gt;. According to Velen, the \"Exodar\" has long been crippled by the crash which brought the draenei to Azeroth, but some of its resources were apparently used to build the \"&lt;a href=\"Vindicaar\"&gt;Vindicaar&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThe &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt; champions of the &lt;a href=\"Conclave\"&gt;Conclave&lt;/a&gt; visited \"the Exodar\" in order to get &lt;a href=\"Pure%20Holy%20Light\"&gt;pure Light&lt;/a&gt;. They were attacked by shivarra assassins led by &lt;a href=\"Crystalbreaker%20Niika\"&gt;Crystalbreaker Niika&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe \"Exodar\" draenei were able to assemble a force of considerable magnitude, gathering them within the \"Vindicaar\", and subsequently joining with the Alliance and the Horde champions for the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20Campaign\"&gt;Argus Campaign&lt;/a&gt;, which ultimately destroyed &lt;a href=\"Argus%20the%20Unmaker\"&gt;Argus the Unmaker&lt;/a&gt; and ended the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt; forever.\nBattle for Azeroth and aftermath.\nAfter the draenei were finally reunited with the &lt;a href=\"Lightforged%20draenei\"&gt;Lightforged draenei&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Army of the Light&lt;/a&gt; joined their brethren in the Alliance. However, their resources were largely depleted by their devastating war on Argus, and were unable to significantly aid their kaldorei allies during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Thorns\"&gt;War of the Thorns&lt;/a&gt;, although Velen attempted to assist their refugees in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, and several brave individuals among their people volunteered to fight alongside the night elves. It was mentioned that other than Teldrassil, the \"Exodar\" was the last major Alliance bastion on the continent of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. Anduin believed the Horde would eventually target Azuremyst after Teldrassil, necessitating their evacuation of the draenei, but they were apparently obsessed with conquering Darnassus, and the \"Exodar\" was not immediately threatened. The draenei sent several of its forces, including &lt;a href=\"Auchenai%20Ballista%20%28Ruins%20of%20Lordaeron%29\"&gt;Auchenai ballistae&lt;/a&gt; and several priests and paladins, to aid the Alliance forces attacking &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20Keep\"&gt;Lordaeron Keep&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Battle for Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the city was visited by &lt;a href=\"Zekhan\"&gt;Zekhan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt;. They were assigned an escort consisting of &lt;a href=\"Ya%27rika\"&gt;Ya'rika&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kea%27ton\"&gt;Kea'ton&lt;/a&gt; while visiting the areas of the city and beyond.\nAppearance.\nThe \"Exodar\" contains a large amount of technological wonders (due to its origins lying within Tempest Keep), such as tall pillars of lavender lightning in the city districts are part of a system that courses threads of &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; power through the \"Exodar\".\nAreas.\nThe \"Exodar\" is divided into four main areas, a large central hall with three major wings. All the wings are connected with smaller hallways as seen on the map.\nEntrances.\nThe draenei and other &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; players can access the city by using either a spiral ramp that leads to the heart of the \"Exodar\" from the main entrance, or another ramp down from the harbor-side entrance that leads into the Vault of Lights.\nThe main entrance ramp has one extra sub-level where an &lt;a href=\"inn\"&gt;inn&lt;/a&gt; is located. Also, the &lt;a href=\"cooking\"&gt;cooking&lt;/a&gt; trainer and supply vendors are located nearby at this small platform.\nThe harbor side ramp is occasionally used by Horde players that attempt to raid the \"Exodar\".\nOther parts.\nThe \"Exodar\" lost several parts while crashing over the &lt;a href=\"Azuremyst%20Isles\"&gt;Azuremyst Isles&lt;/a&gt;, including a &lt;a href=\"Menagerie%20Wreckage\"&gt;menagerie&lt;/a&gt;, escape pods at the &lt;a href=\"Pod%20Cluster\"&gt;Pod Cluster&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pod%20Wreckage\"&gt;Pod Wreckage&lt;/a&gt;, another &lt;a href=\"Crash%20Site\"&gt;big piece&lt;/a&gt; over &lt;a href=\"Ammen%20Vale\"&gt;Ammen Vale&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Cryo-Core\"&gt;Cryo-Core&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Vector%20Coil\"&gt;Vector Coil&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Warp%20Piston\"&gt;Warp Piston&lt;/a&gt;.\nNotable characters.\nThe faction is named Exodar and is led by &lt;a href=\"Prophet%20Velen\"&gt;Prophet Velen&lt;/a&gt;, located near the battlemasters in the Vault of Lights.

Most expansions will not install or run as stand-alone products.\nFor example, ' expansion for ' added new campaigns, units, maps, and other content to the game.\nTimeframe.\nIt was stated in an interview prior to the first expansion, that concepts for that expansion had been made, and that &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard&lt;/a&gt; already had enough ideas for 5-6 more. As of 2021, eight have been released.\nBlizzard tend to plan expansions far in advance of the current content; in February 2014 (prior to the \"&lt;a href=\"Warlords%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Warlords of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;\" alpha) the team had already begun planning the next two expansions.\nFollowing the release of \"World of Warcraft\"'s first expansion in 2007, Blizzard announced plans to release expansions once per year. However, this rate of production was never delivered, with subsequent expansions arriving roughly every 2 years.\nProcess.\nThe process of brainstorming a new expansion generally happens 2 expansions ahead which allows for story plot point-making. Typically this happens with a large group and weekly sessions where the developers think of cool things, throw away others. It's a mix of things. They generally think about The World - the world is the main character that you explore and fill with your own story. The first question is \"Where do we want to go next?\" The story sometimes has to twist and turn to get there (such as ). Then they can add features that make sense alongside that world.\nExpansion features.\n\"*\" Content that wasn't available at the launch of an expansion but was added in a later patch\nHow long until the next expansion?\nBlizzard develops everything on &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Time\"&gt;Blizzard Time&lt;/a&gt;, which is more specifically \"&lt;a href=\"Soon\"&gt;Soon&lt;/a&gt;\". As a player, we want to know now. That being said, you can always look at the past expansion timelines to get a \"very\" rough idea.\nAmount of time since previous expansion.\nExpansions have lasted roughly 2 years.\nAnnouncement.\nBlizzard usually announces new expansions at &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon\"&gt;BlizzCon&lt;/a&gt;, which occurs in the fall. In 2015, they broke from tradition and announced the expansion at &lt;a href=\"Gamescom\"&gt;Gamescom&lt;/a&gt;. The expansion has typically been released a year or so later.\nAlpha/Beta testing.\n&lt;a href=\"Beta\"&gt;Beta&lt;/a&gt; testing happens several months before release, where some lucky players get to taste the expansion for free.\nRelease date announced.\nThe release date is announced a few months before release:\nAmount of time between last \"raid\" patch and release.\nA substantial part of a year has taken place between the last raid patch release from the previous expansion and the launch of the next expansion:\nRelease.\nAlmost all releases have been between September and December, two reckoning of .\nConclusion.\nAccording to the past releases we know, we will typically learn about new expansions at &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon\"&gt;BlizzCon&lt;/a&gt;, and have an 11-16 month wait for their releases. Previously, it was possible to learn about new expansions at the &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Worldwide%20Invitational\"&gt;Blizzard Worldwide Invitational&lt;/a&gt; until being merged with \"BlizzCon\".\nThere have been some occasions where an expansion was announced elsewhere:"}

The worth of a spell or ability is commonly associated with its Average Damage Per Cast Time (&lt;a href=\"aDPCT\"&gt;aDPCT&lt;/a&gt;). With &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; and the recent changes associated with &lt;a href=\"Patch_4.0.1\"&gt;Patch_4.0.1&lt;/a&gt;, most players are relearning their classes and how best to put to use their new or reworked abilities. The goal is to learn how to calculate the average damage per cast time (&lt;a href=\"aDPCT\"&gt;aDPCT&lt;/a&gt;) of our spells and put together a priority-based rotation, not only helping our understanding and appreciation of the design process, but also (and perhaps most importantly) maximizing our &lt;a href=\"DPS\"&gt;DPS&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Variables.\nCoefficients.\nWhen designing a DPS rotation the best place to start is with the abilities/spells themselves. The coefficient decides how much of your increasing power (either &lt;a href=\"spellpower\"&gt;spellpower&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"attack_power\"&gt;attack power&lt;/a&gt;) gets applied to any given ability's overall damage production.\nFor example, a Warlock's Shadowbolt spell has a spellpower coefficient of 85% roughly. To calculate how much extra damage you'd receive from your spellpower, you can do the following, assuming you have 1000 spellpower:\n New Damage = BaseAverageDamage + (CurrentSpellpower * Coefficient)\nSubstituting all the number inside, you'd get the following:\n New Damage = ((640+714)/2)+(1000*0.85)\n New Damage = 677+850\n New Damage = 1527\nResulting in Shadowbolt doing approximate 1527 damage now, originally doing 677 damage, but now receiving an extra 850 damage from spellpower. Coefficient tables for most abilities can be found at &lt;a href=\"Spell_power_coefficient\"&gt;Spell_power_coefficient&lt;/a&gt; for ease of use.\nAverage Damage Per Cast Time.\nThe aDPCT value, when calculated properly and thoroughly, is the most important step in conjuring a DPS rotation. The more information you have for your abilities the better! You must consider a spell\u2019s coefficient and base damage, its specific critical strike percentage, haste rating, mastery, talent tree bonuses, glyphs, talents, and spell procs, etc. All of these things can be quite a daunting task to understand. But with proper logic it's not nearly impossible.\nThe formulate for calculating aDPCT is:\n aDPCT = [(bDMG + (pwr*Coeff))*(1 + (crit_mult*Crit%))*(1 + Mastery%)*(1 + treebonus%)] / (bCastTime / (1 + haste%))\n Whereas:\n aDPCT = Average Damage Per Cast Time\n bDMG = Base Damage of Spell (low end + high end / 2)\n pwr = Your current spellpower/attackpower\n Coeff = Abilities coefficient multiplier\n crit_mult = Critical Strike Damage multiplier (Melee have 200%, or 2, Mages and warlocks now have 1.995, or 199.5% increase with &lt;a href=\"Patch_4.0.1\"&gt;Patch_4.0.1&lt;/a&gt;\n Crit% = Critical Strike % in decimal form (20% = 0.20)\n Mastery% = Bonus Dmg from Mastery in decimal form.\n treebonus% = Bonus Dmg from Talent Tree choices in decimal form.\n bCastTime = Abilities Base Casting time. (Instant cast abilities use &lt;a href=\"Global_Cooldown\"&gt;Global_Cooldown&lt;/a&gt;)\n haste% = Haste % in decimal form.\nAn example, again using a Warlock's Shadowbolt spell, with 1000 spellpower, 15% critical strike, 15% haste rating, and 0% bonuses for mastery and talent trees (for simplicity.)\n aDPCT = ((677 + (1000*0.85)*(1+(1.995*0.15) / ((3.0 / (1+.15))\n Simplified:\n aDPCT = ((1527)*(1.29925)) / (2.6086)\n aDPCT = (1983.95) / (2.6086)\n aDPCT = 760.5420\nAnd now a spell to compare it to; a Destruction Warlocks Chaos bolt:\n aDPCT = ((1691 + (1000*0.71)*(1+(1.995*0.15) / (2.5 / (1+0.15))\n aDPCT = ((2401)*(1.29925)) / (2.1739)\n aDPCT = (3119.49) / (2.1739)\n aDPCT = 1434.9782\nConclusion of Examples.\nIn comparison, Chaos Bolt has an higher average damage per cast time, resulting in the player wanting to use it before Shadowbolt in all cases. (Of course the cooldown of the spell will be taken into consideration, but in this scenario you would keep Chaos bolt consistently on cooldown."}

She hated &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; for her role in the Kul Tirans' deaths.\nWhen Jaina returned to Kul Tiras years later, Priscilla urged &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Admiral\"&gt;Lord Admiral&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Katherine%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Katherine Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; to have Jaina be labeled a traitor and face judgment for Daelin's death.\nPriscilla had been planning to usurp Katherine as the ruler of Kul Tiras, having her company create &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt; weapons which were then shipped to the &lt;a href=\"Irontide%20Raiders\"&gt;Irontide Raiders&lt;/a&gt; who she hired to attack the Proudmoores. Katherine had heard the rumors about Priscilla just like anyone, but whether out of fear or loyalty she chose to ignore them. &lt;a href=\"Taelia\"&gt;Taelia&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Alliance emissary&lt;/a&gt; spoke to her to reveal the truth about Priscilla's plans to usurp the Proudmoores, but Priscilla admitted to all of it and then escaped the scene by igniting a smokescreen. Although the attacking forces from the Ashvane Trading Company were dealt with, Priscilla herself ultimately got away by jumping into the sea when she seemed cornered.\nPriscilla eventually returned with a full fleet of Irontide Raiders, and a handful of tidesages, in an attempt to &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Boralus\"&gt;lay siege to Boralus&lt;/a&gt;. After clearing the city of enemies, Katherine gave Jaina her father's pendant, which she used to call forth the legendary Kul Tiran fleet, which until then had been captured in a magical storm by the &lt;a href=\"Tidesages\"&gt;Tidesages&lt;/a&gt;. The fleet, led by &lt;a href=\"Tandred\"&gt;Tandred&lt;/a&gt;, proceeded to surround the Irontide ships. Outnumbered, Priscilla surrendered.\nTides of Vengeance.\nAshvane was imprisoned in &lt;a href=\"Tol%20Dagor\"&gt;Tol Dagor&lt;/a&gt;, and some time later the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; sought to break her out; ironically enough, part of the Horde team doing so was &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt;, the same half-ogre who killed Daelin. Although Ashvane went with them she was no fool, and knew &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; only freed her because she wanted something. Nevertheless, she agreed to discuss their mutual interests.\nRise of Azshara.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt; used the Tidestone to drag Alliance and Horde ships into &lt;a href=\"Nazjatar\"&gt;Nazjatar&lt;/a&gt;, Priscilla was found in a position of authority among the naga armies, indicating, to the disgust of both factions, that she was now allied with Azshara. Later, the player and their allies found she was providing the naga with plans and schematics for Azerite weapons previously produced by the Ashvane Trading Company. When confronted, Priscilla started to panic as her bodyguards were cut down, first promising to call off her assault (which was quickly being decimated), and when that offer was ignored, pleaded to Azshara for help. The naga queen complied, rescuing her from the adventurers while telling her she won't let Priscilla die before she has \"fulfilled your destiny\".\nDuring the assault on the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Palace\"&gt;Eternal Palace&lt;/a&gt;, Azshara fulfilled her end of their bargain. As the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s watched, the Queen granted Priscilla the power she had always desired, but did so in a method that Priscilla clearly did not expect, transforming her into a powerful yet hideous, inhuman monstrosity. A battle ensued, in which the adventurers finally slew Lady Ashvane, putting her out of her misery."}

The crippled wyrm descended, crushing the &lt;a href=\"qiraji\"&gt;qiraji&lt;/a&gt; as it fell. The dragon mauled Ossirian nearly to death, but the remaining anubisaths and qiraji now had a target on the ground to focus on, and they swiftly converged and overwhelmed the noble dragon.\nOssirian's beaten body was dragged back to the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ruins of Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt; following the battle, where he should by all rights have perished. It is whispered that Ossirian found the favor of the malevolent force that reigns over the qiraji, for in spite of his wounds, the construct survived.\nWhen the mighty anubisath awoke, he found himself transformed, his strength bolstered and his wounded head bound in the visage of a &lt;a href=\"hawk\"&gt;hawk&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Twin%20Emperors\"&gt;Emperor Vek'nilash&lt;/a&gt; himself explained what had occurred: Where all others \u2014 including the qiraji &lt;a href=\"General%20Rajaxx\"&gt;General Rajaxx&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 had failed to find a way to counterattack, the anubisath had succeeded. For that he received a gift; Ossirian's essence had been bound to several ancient crystals of distant origin, which would grant the anubisath champion near invulnerability. There was a price for this boon, however; Ossirian's life was maintained by the crystals, and if he should ever stray too far from them, the anubisath would swiftly die.\nAs others learned of Ossirian's survival, the anubisaths and others began to refer to him as the \"Unscarred\", revering him as a nearly invincible hero.\nThe legends say that Vek'nilash secretly entrusted Ossirian with the responsibility of maintaining a watch on General Rajaxx, to ensure that the commander would never fail again.\nOssirian serves the Emperors to the best of his ability, despite the frustration of being eternally bound to a single location. The bones of Grakkarond have become a sacred site to the Anubisaths; a testimony to their ability to defeat even the most powerful of enemies.\nAbilities.\nAlso note that when the encounter starts, a Sandstorm starts in all the instance making tornadoes harder to see. This does not stop once the encounter is over.\nStrategy.\nBefore the pull.\nHave the tanks stand up by the first crystal, behind it, and have the rest of the raid about 20 yards behind them.\nThe Pull.\nPick a raid member whose DPS will be missed least for the fight. Often, a naked mounted &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt; will be used, although any class will do. Whoever is used ought to have a raid symbol put on them, to help the MTs. The puller, mounted, will body-pull the boss, then head back to the middle. Ossirian begins in supreme mode, hitting the tank for massive damage and moving very fast. When Ossirian reaches the bottom of the blue stairs on his platform, have a designated person click on the first crystal to activate it as he runs straight towards it. This can be a MT or anyone, it doesn't matter. The &lt;a href=\"main%20tank\"&gt;main tank&lt;/a&gt; should stand behind the first crystal and activate bloodrage and battleshout when Ossirian is pulled, to gain initial aggro, but he has to stay out of range until Ossirian is weakened or he is likely to be killed.\nActivating the Crystals.\nActivating the crystal will put a 45 second debuff on Ossirian that makes him hit for much less damage, slows him down, and puts a vulnerability on him for specific spell damages (he can have more than one vulnerability at a time). Make sure you are paying attention to the debuff slots so you can see what he is vulnerable to. You will then have about 45 seconds to pull Ossirian to the next crystal before his debuff runs out and one-shots the Main Tank. The crystal has a slight casting time, so don't wait until the last second. It's generally best to click it between 10\u201315 seconds left (30\u201335 seconds elapsed) on his debuff. Generally, Ossirian will reach the next crystal in 15\u201320 seconds, giving approximately 15 seconds to DPS before moving to the next crystal. Due to the fact that the MT and OT have relatively little aggro at the start, since both alternate tanking, it is advised the raid does absolutely no DPS until after the 2nd crystal, and then only white damage until after the third. Then they can begin to open up, but be aware that the tanks have not generated as much threat as usual, and casters will be doing significantly increased damage when he is vulnerable to their school of magic.\nKiting Ossirian.\nThe mounted player, with a raid icon on them, will be responsible for finding the locations of spawned crystals. This information should be relayed to the crystal clicker via Ventrilo or party chat. The clicker will be responsible for calling out and pinging the map on the next crystal to &lt;a href=\"kite\"&gt;kite&lt;/a&gt; Ossirian to. (Having the clicker ping the map rather than the scout allows the scout to keep scouting after finding one crystal.) Once the closest crystal is located, the raid will all move towards it, staying between the MTs and the crystal if possible. Healers especially should try to stay close to the MT, because he can be knocked out of LoS and killed very quickly. When the raid arrives at the crystal, DPS until CT_Raid gives a 15 second warning, then pop the crystal. Ossirian has an &lt;a href=\"AoE\"&gt;AoE&lt;/a&gt; \u201c&lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Tongues\"&gt;Curse of Tongues&lt;/a&gt;\u201d. This curse needs to be removed as soon as possible, especially on the healers, by druids and mages at all times. Generally crystals spawn in a clockwise or counterclockwise manner, and the kite path can be pretty consistent. Some crystals spawn pretty close to each other, so the tank should just get to the next crystal, stay there until the 15 second warning and let the rest of the raid catch up and do damage to Ossirian. See the external links section for a strategy that includes maps of potential crystal spawn locations.\nAlways watch out for tornadoes in and near the kite path.\nNote that the tank should not position Ossirian directly on top of the crystal, as Ossirian's knockback can send the designated clicker flying (and causing a wipe); rather, tank Ossirian slightly before it.\nYou should have one or two designated players to click the crystals every 40 seconds. Consider that speed abilities like &lt;a href=\"Blink\"&gt;Blink&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Travel%20Form\"&gt;Travel Form&lt;/a&gt; may save the day.\nTo get the timing, you can use a timer addon, a fitting ability cooldown or an ordinary clock.\n\"Fight in the Center\" Technique.\nThere is a considerably easier technique for keeping Ossirian near crystals.\nAssign two (unmounted) players, typically hunters using &lt;a href=\"Aspect%20of%20the%20Cheetah\"&gt;Aspect of the Cheetah&lt;/a&gt; druids using &lt;a href=\"Travel%20Form\"&gt;Travel Form&lt;/a&gt;, or shamans using &lt;a href=\"Ghost%20Wolf\"&gt;Ghost Wolf&lt;/a&gt;, to patrol the edges of Ossirian's courtyard and immediately click on any crystals they find. This will cause the crystals to re-spawn in the center of the courtyard. It should be noted that another crystal spawns by itself in front of the pillar to the right of Ossirian's stairway. It can be helpful to place the least valuable member of the raid on this spawn spot for the sole purpose of clicking this crystal when it spawns. Though 3 people will now be out of the main fight, this will almost guarantee all three crystals being ready constantly in the center of the map.\nThe rest of the raid simply fights Ossirian in the center of the courtyard at the crystals, which will be plentiful there. Without the requirement to find and move so far to the next crystal, it takes only half as long to kill Ossirian, healing is a lot easier, and there is much less risk of a wipe due to being unable to find a crystal in time.\nThe main risk is then due to a DPS character stealing aggro from Ossirian, as he will be doing considerably more damage. The increased damage cannot be understated; the crystal debuff and stationary nature of this method can make it very easy for a DPS caster to overaggro in this fight. \nAt one time it was believed tornadoes could come into the center of the courtyard, but after testing, this has been proven as inaccurate. There are two tornadoes that come close to the crystals on the edges of the courtyard, but they do not enter the courtyard itself. Warning: If the tanks are too close to the crystal when Ossirian does his knockback, it can kick them into the tornadoes. The way to avoid this is to simply hold Ossirian close enough to the crystal that a knockback will result in the melee landing right next to the crystal.\nBlizzard has taken no stance on if this tactic is an exploit or not.\nOff-tank.\nThe reason why an OT might be needed is because Ossirian casts a debuff on the person highest on his aggro list. If you get caught in a tornado, you are caught in a whirlwind for 8 seconds, and you temporarily lose aggro. The effect can not be dispelled, so when the MT gets caught in the tornado, Ossirian will aggro onto someone else, which is why an OT is needed, to catch aggro and continue moving Ossirian towards the next crystal. Depending on levels of threat, Ossirian may or may not return to the MT after the whirlwind debuff ends, and he definitely will if he casts it on the OT. Because of this, the two tanks need to always try to stay close together, and be between Ossirian and the next crystal. When things go badly, for example, the OT is stunned right next the crystal and Ossirian runs after the MT who is 30 yards away, the OT can use his Insignia of the Horde/Alliance to break the stun effect and regain aggro immediately. High Nature Resistance can prevent the stun debuff. A second OT is not a bad idea, either, because it is very possible that one of the primary two tanks could go down.\nAoE Knockback.\nOssirian's other ability of note is his &lt;a href=\"Area%20of%20Effect\"&gt;Area of Effect&lt;/a&gt; knockback, which deals approximately 1000 nature damage and launches everyone within a sizable distance into the air, landing about 30 yards away. This ability causes most wipes, either due to a tank being knocked out of &lt;a href=\"Line%20of%20Sight\"&gt;Line of Sight&lt;/a&gt; of the healers, or a tank being knocked away from a crystal and being unable to make it back before Ossirian gains supreme mode. The latter problem can be prevented, for the most part, by having the tanks, once they reach a crystal, to stand with their back to it, so they don't get punted too far. It helps for a healer to stay right on top of the MT, so they get punted in the same direction as he does all the time. Tanks need to be experienced at switching to berserker stance and intercepting, or using bloodrage, then intercepting, and it also helps for tanks to have swiftness potions at hand, should things go badly.\nKilling Ossirian.\nOssirian has about 500,000 hit points, and dies relatively quickly due to the vulnerabilities that he gains from the crystals. The fight still usually lasts over six minutes using the scout-and-kite technique, because the raid cannot do damage all the time. After the first few crystals, casters will want to do moderate DPS, and save the bulk of their damage for school vulnerabilities that they can take advantage of. Melee classes can do effective DPS, but be prepared to back out and bandage if you get low on health. Decursers, if they use Decursive, should set it to ignore physical damage classes. Usually it will take a few attempts to get everyone to figure out what's going on, especially the tanks. The rhythm of the fight can be difficult to develop, but once it gets going, taking down Ossirian is pretty straightforward, although luck with crystal placement does play a big part in this fight.\nLevel 70.\nThis boss is still quite difficult at level 70 and although a decently geared tank will only be taking 3-4k hits during this fight, allowing the raid to simply heal through his Supreme Mode, it is still worth dragging him to crystals to up DPS. Have a good offtank if you decide to dps him straight out or he *will* one-shot clothies while in supreme mode and the MT is under the effect of enveloping winds.\nLevel 80.\nSoloing Ossirian at level 80 is possible with a Naxx geared Unholy/Tank specced Death Knight or Protection Paladin. However, it should be noted that after wiping, some of the crystals might remain in the zone and will not debuff Ossirian when activated. They must be despawned before the encounter is restarted. This bug is perhaps related to the Shadow of Death ability that allows Death Knights to respawn as ghouls after their death. Soloing Ossirian is also possible with a feral druid in decent raid tank gear, as well as a fairly well geared protection paladin. It has also been demonstrated that a hunter can solo Ossirian. Warlocks may have a tougher time due to the inability to track elementals. Soloing him just takes a little time, but can be done with many classes.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

{"id": "43669", "revid": "41171629", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=43669", "title": "Other loot distribution systems", "text": "This is a collection of &lt;a href=\"Loot%20system\"&gt;Loot system&lt;/a&gt;s which don't exactly fit into one of the other categories &lt;a href=\"Bidding%20systems\"&gt;Bidding systems&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Variable%20price\"&gt;Variable price&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Fixed%20price\"&gt;Fixed price&lt;/a&gt;. Most of these systems share some traits from others, but still introduce an element which sets them apart.\nRoll System.\nIn principle every system which does not use bidding determines who gets loot from the current hierarchy. There are two possibilities - either the person with the highest score simply gets the item, or the point scores are in some way converted to die roll modifiers, and the actual loot distribution is determined by a roll. Ni Karma and SLS below actually differ mostly in the aspect that Ni Karma uses a die roll, while in SLS the current point leader has the first pick.\nWhether rolling is good or bad is a matter of taste, but generally loot systems are introduced because the general feeling is that rolling is just too arbitrary.\nPick-up groups.\nThat said, since Pick-up players generally do not know each other, roll system is used to ensure fairness.\nFollowing WotLK's release, raiding content has become far more accessible to pickup groups, and the most common strategy to distribute loot in PUGs is to set the loot rules to loot master (always the raid leader, who starts the raid), and have the leader call for rolls in a priority order. If no one is eligible or wants to roll in one priority order, next priority order is called. Rolls are done by typing \"/roll\" in the chat box and is visible by everyone. This is a slightly finer-grained variation of the need/greed system.\nTypically, roll order is as follows:\n-Main-spec roll: Only roll if the item is an upgrade over the piece you currently have equipped.\n-Off-spec roll: If no one's main spec can use the item, then players with a secondary role can go ahead and roll.\n-Disenchant/Greed: If, by some misfortune, no one can use the loot or the loot is bind on equip, everyone can roll on the item or, if at all possible, the result of disenchanting for BoP items. Some groups also stipulate that only people who have not won any loot in the current raid should roll by this point(particularly if a piece of loot is useful to every player or 25-man runs)\nFor larger raid like Naxx, the raid leader may stipulate that a player may only be eligible to win a single main-spec roll in a section.\n&lt;a href=\"Loot%20Council\"&gt;Loot Council&lt;/a&gt;.\nLoot Council is a system where some subset of the raiders (usually the officers) are responsible for which raid members receive which loot. Most other systems actually use some kind of loot council. Whenever there are any rules restricting which players may receive what items, a loot council is actually in effect.\n&lt;a href=\"MMORAS\"&gt;MMORAS&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe principle in this system is based on attendance history. The more a player attends raids the higher RAS they will have. If a player is frequently late or does not show up to raids which they have signed up to they are decremented 'points'. The system works off percentages and a player adds a roll to the 'RAS'. \n&lt;a href=\"Ni%20Karma\"&gt;Ni Karma&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn this system loot is distributed by rolling, but karma can be used as die roll modifier. Karma is earned as in a standard DKP system, upon item distribution people can either roll with no modifier, or use their current karma score as modifier. If a person using their karma score wins the roll, their karma is subsequently halved.\nQuickest Fingers win.\nAKA \"speed before need\". In this \"system\", the loot mode is set to \"Free for all\". The people who click the fastest get the loot.\nIn reality, this is not a proper loot system at all, but rather a joke. It would lead to random loot distribution, guild progress would be severely hampered, and members would strive to leave this system asap.\nReputation System (Pyramid).\nThe \"Reputation System\" was created by Nukemdead of Drak'Tharon. This system is a rank, bank, and loot system combined. You give members reputation points for certain things, and once they get to a certain amount of points, they get promoted to the next reputation level. In this system, reputation level &amp; current gear determines the loot priority level of that member. You can also determine the amount of guild loan money by reputation level. I recommend making Guild Quests (weekly) which ask for different materials for reputation. (Pyramid Scheme)\n&lt;a href=\"Shroud%20Loot%20System\"&gt;Shroud Loot System&lt;/a&gt;.\nSLS looks quite similar to Ni Karma above. There is no rolling though, and the point expenditure is capped at all items.\n&lt;a href=\"Suicide%20Kings\"&gt;Suicide Kings&lt;/a&gt;.\nAka \"SK\". This system basically makes a simple list of all its members (initially by a random roll), and when an item is to be distributed, the person highest on the list willing to take the item gets it, and is put at the bottom of the list. SK is extremely lightweight, but also rather simplistic, as SK lends equal weight to every item drop."}

{"id": "18596", "revid": "27079649", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=18596", "title": "Othmar Garithos", "text": "&lt;a href=\"%3AGrand%20Marshal\"&gt;:Grand Marshal&lt;/a&gt; Othmar Garithos was the leader of remnants of the &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; following its downfall during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the de facto leader of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20resistance\"&gt;resistance&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. He was leader of the army by chance, not by merit, being the highest-ranking survivor of Lordaeron's military. Garithos was an ill-tempered and xenophobic man; even in the situation the Alliance was facing after the Third War in Lordaeron, he was disdainful of the non-human races in the Alliance, though he cooperated with the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; that would eventually become known as the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nSecond War.\nOthmar Garithos was the only son of a &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Garithos\"&gt;baron&lt;/a&gt; who ruled the lands bordering &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;. After growing up in the town of &lt;a href=\"Blackwood\"&gt;Blackwood&lt;/a&gt;, Garithos joined Lordaeron's army as a &lt;a href=\"knight\"&gt;knight&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;. While he was fighting to defend Quel'Thalas, a small band of &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s broke off from the main invading force and put Blackwood &lt;a href=\"Razing%20of%20Blackwood\"&gt;to the torch&lt;/a&gt;, killing all of its inhabitants. Othmar's family perished trying to defend the lives and homes of their subjects. Garithos blamed the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;elves&lt;/a&gt; for the loss of his home and family, believing that they had diverted troops that could have been used to defend &lt;a href=\"Human\"&gt;humanity&lt;/a&gt;. After the war, Garithos inherited his father's title and continued his service in Lordaeron's military.\nAt some point prior to the Third War, Garithos employed a clerk named &lt;a href=\"Kristoff%20%28human%29\"&gt;Kristoff&lt;/a&gt;. In that role, Kristoff's organizational skills became legendary in the military.\nThe Alliance remnants.\nBy the time of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, Garithos has risen to the rank of Grand Marshal, promoted not necessarily due to his own abilities, but by his father's reputation and title. He was the highest-ranking survivor of Lordaeron's military after the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;'s rampage across Lordaeron, and he recruited what forces he could muster from both volunteers and conscripted civilians. Cut off from the chain of command, Garithos gave his human army the mission that he assumed the Alliance should have always had: the preservation of humanity above all else. Ignorant of Garithos' policies, officials from neighboring non-human states such as &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; sent him aid, recognizing him as potentially the last remnant of Lordaeron's government, and certainly the strongest warlord in the area. The healthiest &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;, prince of the ruined &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, also joined his army. Garithos did not enjoy having to work with the blood elves or &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt;, believing that the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;'s mission should be to preserve humanity above all else and that the Alliance should never have accepted the elves in the first place.\nThe defense of Dalaran.\nGarithos and his forces managed to retake Dalaran from the Scourge, and used it as their base. Later, Garithos gave Kael'thas the job of overseeing a caravan of supplies being ushered out of ruined villages. Though Kael completed the mission, he wanted his people on the front lines with Garithos' main force.\nWhile they were in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, Garithos' scouting parties discovered a large undead strike force advancing through &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt; to attempt to retake Dalaran. Before Garithos left to push back the advancing Scourge from the south, he informed Kael'thas that he and his brethren would not accompany them on the front lines. Instead, they would be tasked with fixing the nearby observatories to watch for Scourge flanks from the west, much to Kael's dismay.\nKael'thas performed his duties to the best of his abilities, but he had to accept the help of &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Vashj\"&gt;Lady Vashj&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;. When word of this reached Garithos, he immediately went to Kael and reprimanded him for consorting with the snake-people.\nThe observatories repaired by the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Remnants\"&gt;Alliance Remnants&lt;/a&gt; discovered that an undead strike force was coming from the west. Garithos returned to the front and left Kael'thas awaiting orders. Then, an &lt;a href=\"Emissary%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Emissary&lt;/a&gt; sent by Garithos informed Kael'thas that he had to engage the strike force from the west, but also recalled all foot soldiers, cavalry and support teams to the front, leaving Kael with only his blood elven troops. Garithos had hoped that the elves would fall before the Scourge, and no longer be his problem; the missions given to Kael's greatly reduced force were intended to be suicidal, impossible for the elves to complete.\nGarithos defeated the undead in the front with the forces he had amassed. However, Kael would have surely been defeated had he not accepted another offer from Vashj and her naga to aid in the destruction of the western Scourge forces.\nImprisonment of the blood elves.\nGarithos returned with soldiers and saw the naga leaving the scene. With proof that the blood elves were in league with the naga, Garithos condemned Kael'thas and all of his men to death. He explained that he never trusted the elves, and felt it was a mistake to accept them into the Alliance in the first place. He arrested Kael and his servitors and locked them in the dungeons of Dalaran to await their execution, under the guard of &lt;a href=\"Kassan\"&gt;Kassan&lt;/a&gt;. \nExodus of the blood elves.\nSoon Garithos heard that Kael had escaped with Vashj's help, and that the blood elves were fleeing through a mystic portal - the same portal &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; opened to bring &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Garithos sent his men, armed with explosives, to destroy the portal, but the elven engineers Kael had freed used their knowledge to construct strategic defense systems. Kael and Vashj defended the portal and eventually fled themselves. The portal took them to the shattered realm of &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;.\nMind controlled.\nGarithos, though furious, turned his attention back to the advancing undead. He pushed them back into &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands\"&gt;Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;, but was soon faced with the &lt;a href=\"dreadlord\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Detheroc\"&gt;Detheroc&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt;. Detheroc's powers of mental domination allowed him to enslave Garithos and his men. The humans served Detheroc and Balnazzar for some time until they were attacked by &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas\"&gt;Sylvanas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Varimathras\"&gt;Varimathras&lt;/a&gt;. Sylvanas slew Detheroc, and Garithos was freed from his bondage.\nGarithos was suspicious of Sylvanas, but she explained that she was no longer a member of the Scourge. She offered to help Garithos and his men reclaim their lands in exchange for their assistance in defeating the final dreadlord, &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt;, who remained in control of Lordaeron's &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt;. Garithos accepted the banshee's terms - but she had no intention of keeping her word.\nSeven of Garithos' advisors (including &lt;a href=\"Kristoff%20%28human%29\"&gt;Kristoff&lt;/a&gt;) warned Garithos against allying with the rebel undead, but Garithos would not change his mind. Fearing the undead would betray the Alliance, Kristoff left for greener pastures.\nAssault on the Capital City.\nAs Garithos and Sylvanas met to plan their attack on the Capital City, Varimathras pointed out that it was heavily defended. Balnazzar controlled a sizable undead army, and the battle could be won only through attrition.\nSylvanas chose to launch a two-pronged attack on the capital: her forces would make a front assault while Garithos' forces attacked the city from the rear.\nThe missing dwarves.\nAs the battle commenced, Garithos received word that his dwarven reinforcements had become lost in the wilderness. Though he feared they were more trouble than they were worth, Garithos recognized that he would need them on the front lines (as none of his other troops had long-range weaponry or siege equipment). Garithos quickly left to find the dwarves and bring them back to his base.\nAt least one &lt;a href=\"Rifleman%23Dwarven%20rifleman\"&gt;dwarven rifleman&lt;/a&gt; felt he wasn't being paid enough to put up with Garithos.\nDeath.\nThe combined forces of the Alliance and the rebel undead succeeded in dispatching Balnazzar's forces and taking control of the city. With Balnazzar defeated, Garithos watched as Sylvanas ordered Varimathras to execute him. Despite their laws, which forbade one &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt; from killing another, Varimathras did so.\nGarithos was lightly amused, but quickly changed his mood and ordered the duo to leave his city. Instead, Sylvanas ordered Varimathras to kill Garithos as well. Varimathras happily complied and killed Garithos, who was cannibalized by ghouls moments later.\nSylvanas would go on to name her followers the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;, and would use the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt; beneath the capital as their new base.\nLegacy.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Alliance-Horde%20war\"&gt;Alliance-Horde war&lt;/a&gt;, the blood elves' regent lord &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; reflected that his people had been driven to the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; by \"the bigotry and distrust of the Alliance\", but that he was now considering rejoining the Alliance as he was beginning to see \"the very same racism\" in &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;. However, the blood elves ultimately remained with the Horde due to the &lt;a href=\"%3ADivine%20Bell\"&gt;:Divine Bell&lt;/a&gt; incident.\n's leader &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; is of the opinion that Garithos sullied the name of the Alliance with his bigoted treatment of the elves and that while his end was terrible, it was \"better than he deserved\"."}

{"id": "28373", "revid": "49723770", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=28373", "title": "Ouro", "text": "The ancient &lt;a href=\"sand%20worm\"&gt;sand worm&lt;/a&gt;, Ouro, is a being of legendary power. He is rumored to have been created by the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"C%27Thun\"&gt;C'Thun&lt;/a&gt; himself as a mockery of life. He resides in the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Temple of Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt;.\nHis skin is unnaturally thick, nearly impregnable. It's flexible and allows him to move with the speed and grace of a much smaller creature.\nStrategy.\nPhase One.\nOuro seems to give you about 10 seconds to get a MT in there when he pops up, otherwise he goes right back down. In order to determine where he will surface, it is advised that everyone in the raid stay near the center area (or predetermined area) near the end of the submerging phase. Once he appears, have multiple tanks on Ouro, to ensure he does not submerge again. Regardless of any deaths, Ouro will resurface with scarabs, they will despawn after 45 seconds so fears, frost nova, frost traps, and any forms of CC is adequate. \nUsually he starts with a frontal cone of Sand Blast after popping up. It does not happen immediately so there is time for positioning shorting after resurfacing. Try to avoid that if you are not the MT. Don't stay over the Dirt Mound, as it hits multiple times (in fact, usually it hits until you die).\nThe raid should be positioned using 3 groups spread with 120\u00ba between them. Healers at the back away so they don't suffer Sand Blast. Sand Blast does up to 4.6k damage. It is a matter of having enough health and let the healers top your hp after each hit.\nUsually you get out of combat for a second each time Ouro is about to go up. If you spam the button, you can drink.\nPhase Two.\nAt 20%, Ouro gains enrage, +150% attack speed, + 100% attack damage. From this point on, Ouro will not submerge again, but he summons Dirt Mound Quakes and Scarabs while remaining up. DPS is much more important than NR in this stage, you need kill it ASAP, and at 20% he has about 400,000 health.\nIf no one is in melee range during this phase, he will throw boulders &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.thottbot.com/%3Fsp%3D26616\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for ~6000 damages to a raid member, pretty much like in the &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; encounter."}

Magtheridon was eventually deposed and replaced by &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; who brought the &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; to the world. As &lt;a href=\"Kazzak\"&gt;Kazzak&lt;/a&gt; reopened the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; to Outland from &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; letting new demons enter Azeroth expeditions from the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; battling back the demons entered the world in the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt;. In the conflict, the Alliance and the Horde also came into conflict with &lt;a href=\"Illidan%27s%20forces\"&gt;Illidan's forces&lt;/a&gt;, which would end Illidan's rule with his death at the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt;.\nOutland was originally featured in ' and is the theater of the \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" expansion '. From a gameplay point of view, Outland used to be accessed from Azeroth through the Dark Portal in the &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt; but after the \"\" expansion it became accessible via mage portals in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nOutland was created when &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; became the focus of an attack, via the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, of an &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Lothar\"&gt;expedition&lt;/a&gt; aiming to end the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;ish threat to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; once and for all. In the midst of the ensuing battle, the elder &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; attempted to allow the remaining orcs on Draenor to escape to other worlds by opening other &lt;a href=\"dimensional%20portal\"&gt;dimensional portal&lt;/a&gt;s; however the presence of so many portals tore the planet apart, launching torn fragments of the former world towards the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;, and the barely-habitable remnants were renamed Outland. Most life on Draenor was wiped out in the explosion, and the surviving continent was drastically reshaped; most of the remaining wildlife became sickly or corrupt. Due to the planet's destruction, the barriers between Draenor and the Twisting Nether collapsed, and the shredded reality left open paths to all various corners of the cosmos. Outland had become one of the most important strategic places. Many of Ner'zhul's portals were permanently open and the world now acted as a crossroads for any force that wished to travel quickly from one end of the universe to the other. Despite this plenty of the species on the planet survived, with &lt;a href=\"Black%20dragonflight\"&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; even being &lt;a href=\"Netherwing%20dragonflight\"&gt;transformed&lt;/a&gt; by the creation of Outland.\nSome time after a &lt;a href=\"pit%20lord\"&gt;pit lord&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Magtheridon\"&gt;Magtheridon&lt;/a&gt; rallied the surviving orcs (with the exception of the &lt;a href=\"Mag%27har\"&gt;Mag'har&lt;/a&gt;) and took control of Outland. Using the remaining dimensional gates, he drew demons from the rest of the Twisting Nether to aid him.\nMost draenei that remained in Outland have become horribly mutated, and bear only a passing resemblance to their former selves.\nThe Lord of Outland.\nThe &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; and many of the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; fled to Outland and succeeded in defeating Magtheridon and conquering the wasteland. After their defeat in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; at the hands of &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Prince Arthas&lt;/a&gt;, they returned and established permanent settlements there.\nSince then, both the forces of the Light and the Shadow have realized Outland's usefulness. It can serve as a launching pad for the invasions of the Burning Legion, or as the staging ground to the forces who fight against the Legion. In response, both the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; and the Legion have sent their agents to secure the world for their own purposes.\nNow, the Alliance and the Horde must battle the forces of the maddened Illidan and the murderous followers of the Legion to safeguard Azeroth from Kil'jaeden's Burning Crusade.\nPlant life still flourishes in places such as &lt;a href=\"Sylvanaar\"&gt;Sylvanaar&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Blade's Edge Mountains&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Thicket\"&gt;Cenarion Thicket&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Terokkar%20Forest\"&gt;Terokkar Forest&lt;/a&gt;. The main base of the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Expedition\"&gt;expedition&lt;/a&gt; is from &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Refuge\"&gt;Cenarion Refuge&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Zangarmarsh\"&gt;Zangarmarsh&lt;/a&gt;.\nInvasion of Outland.\nThe &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt; was the combined invasion of Outland by the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal%20Opens\"&gt;third attempt&lt;/a&gt; of invading &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. The goal of the war was to prevent the Legion from securing a foothold on Outland to further their attacks on Azeroth through the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;.\nAftermath.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vindicator%20Maraad\"&gt;Vindicator Maraad&lt;/a&gt; explained to his grandnephew &lt;a href=\"Med%27an\"&gt;Med'an&lt;/a&gt; that the crossing between the two worlds was safer, as the armies of Azeroth have scoured much of the demons in Outland. Since the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt;, the forces of the Burning Legion were much diminished, and the Dark Portal is still under surveillance to prevent their incursions into Azeroth.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; traveled to &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt; in Outland to converse with the elements there and turned to &lt;a href=\"Aggra\"&gt;Aggra&lt;/a&gt; for shamanic instruction.\nYears later, &lt;a href=\"Xaraax\"&gt;Xaraax&lt;/a&gt; imprisoned &lt;a href=\"Greydon%20Thorne\"&gt;Greydon Thorne&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Hidden%20citadel\"&gt;Hidden citadel&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Makasa%20Flintwill\"&gt;Makasa Flintwill&lt;/a&gt; led an army from Azeroth and invaded it.\nFollowing Illidan's death, &lt;a href=\"Akama\"&gt;Akama&lt;/a&gt; reclaimed the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt;. The warlocks &lt;a href=\"Kanrethad%20Ebonlocke\"&gt;Kanrethad Ebonlocke&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jubeka%20Shadowbreaker\"&gt;Jubeka Shadowbreaker&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20the%20Black%20Harvest\"&gt;Council of the Black Harvest&lt;/a&gt; infiltrated the temple to harness its energy.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"war%20in%20Draenor\"&gt;war in Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Vargoth\"&gt;Archmage Vargoth&lt;/a&gt; mentioned that the current state of Outland was constantly degrading.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nikki%20the%20Gossip\"&gt;Nikki the Gossip&lt;/a&gt; described Outland as a dangerous place.\n&lt;a href=\"Kor%27vas%20Bloodthorn\"&gt;Kor'vas Bloodthorn&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;Order Hall leader&lt;/a&gt; clashed with the forces of &lt;a href=\"Highlord%20Kruul\"&gt;Highlord Kruul&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Stair%20of%20Destiny\"&gt;Stair of Destiny&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; and the champions of Azeroth briefly clashed in the &lt;a href=\"Arcatraz\"&gt;Arcatraz&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20Campaign\"&gt;offensive on Argus&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, a few &lt;a href=\"Consortium%20Arcanist\"&gt;ethereal arcanists&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Consortium\"&gt;Consortium&lt;/a&gt; have been hired by the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; to maintain portals to &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=\"Pathfinder%27s%20Den\"&gt;Pathfinder's Den&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Wizard%27s%20Sanctum\"&gt;Wizard's Sanctum&lt;/a&gt;, respectively in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; was talking with &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; in his friend's new home in &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt;, he spoke about how good the world looked. But that it felt wrong, as Outland was broken and falling apart. After Varok touched Nagrand's grain, it crumbled.\nGeography.\nBefore &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; was torn apart by the portal rifts, it was a vast planet of continents and seas, much like &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. When the world was destroyed it was tossed towards the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;. It no longer had its sun, but its moon, the &lt;a href=\"Pale%20Lady\"&gt;Pale Lady&lt;/a&gt; still hovered looking far larger than it ever did before. Other spheres now existed as well, including a rosy one, and a smaller light blue one. This may be partially wrong as the sun and sunlight were later described to be present.\nThe damage to the world had sundered reality, gravity, space, and even time may not even function properly.\nLocation.\n&lt;a href=\"Chris%20Metzen\"&gt;Chris Metzen&lt;/a&gt; stated that Outland was floating in the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"%23Official%20site%20info\"&gt;official overview&lt;/a&gt; stated that Outland was \"floating upon the astral winds of the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;\" as well. This can also be seen in-game when flying near the edges of the continent or between each region. Netherstorm also heavily features the Nether and its energies.\nIn ' however, &lt;a href=\"Illidan\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt; describes Outland as \"a tiny speck in the infinity of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;Great Dark Beyond&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThis may just have been an oversight as previous sources and the game put Outland fully shrouded by the Twisting Nether. Later, described the state of Outland with barriers between Draenor and the Twisting Nether being collapsed, leaving open paths to all the various corners of the cosmos. However, it is also worth to note that demons that died in Outland (such as &lt;a href=\"Kazzak\"&gt;Kazzak&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ambassador%20Hellmaw\"&gt;Ambassador Hellmaw&lt;/a&gt;) did not die permanently as they should when dying in the Nether. As such, it can be speculated that Outland is not fully shrouded in the Nether.\nZones.\nOutland currently consists of seven large zones that connect to each other but differ sharply in environment.\nOfficial site info.\nFrom &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.worldofwarcraft.com/burningcrusade/townhall/outland.html\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.worldofwarcraft.com/burningcrusade/\"&gt;section&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.worldofwarcraft.com/\"&gt;Official site&lt;/a&gt;:\n\"The scattered wastes of Outland are all that remain of Draenor, the once beautiful homeworld of the orcs. Following the Second War, the Alliance invaded Draenor by crossing through the Dark Portal. To their horror, they discovered that Ner'zhul - the dark warlord of Horde - had constructed a series of new gateways that could lead the beaten Horde to newer, unspoiled worlds. As the Alliance forces closed in around him, Ner'zhul opened his gateways as a means of escape. However, the gateways' clashing energies resulted in a catastrophic explosion that ultimately ripped the world of Draenor apart.\"\n\"Nearly thirteen years later - towards the end of the Third War - the fallen night elf, Illidan, discovered that huge chunks of Draenor still existed - floating upon the astral winds of the Twisting Nether. After his defeat at the hands of the evil Prince Arthas, Illidan fled to the remnants of Draenor and dubbed them Outland. He quickly seized control of the chaotic region and sealed the last of Ner'zhul's cursed gateways.\"\n\"Though he is the undisputed ruler of the ravaged land, Illidan lives in fear that he will be discovered by his powerful enemies - most notably Arthas, the new Lich King, and the remaining Lords of the Burning Legion. Currently, Outland is home to a number of scattered draenei tribes, primitive orcs and the powerful, arcane creatures of the Nether itself. Agents of the Burning Legion have also targeted the region as a vital strategic location in their unending Burning Crusade to scour all life from the universe.\"\nCataclysm.\nElemental Rifts briefly appeared during patch &lt;a href=\"Patch%204.0.1\"&gt;4.0.1&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Patch%204.0.3a\"&gt;4.0.3a&lt;/a&gt; during the Cataclysm &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Unrest\"&gt;world event&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuestions have been raised about the continuity of the Burning Crusade storyline following the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, and blue-poster &lt;a href=\"Bornakk\"&gt;Bornakk&lt;/a&gt; has addressed this issue:\nYou have to consider the changes with some form of leniency, while technically you could say that if the story progresses then we need to remove a bunch of the content from Outland and Northrend as those are over - but for numerous reasons, you can probably see why that would be a bad idea. This is the same type of thing that happens by just having a persistent world, just because one quest was completed where something was killed doesn't mean it vanishes from your sight forever.\nWhile a level 80 doesn't need to return to the locations of Outland and Northrend and can focus on the new stories - a new character hasn't helped defeat the villains in those areas so they still need to answer the call and fight them off (or in the terms people are tossing around, they need to level). &lt;a href=\"http%3A//forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html%3FtopicId%3D19820526504%26amp%3Bsid%3D1%26amp%3BpageNo%3D2%2326\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\nWarlords of Draenor.\nThe portal to the Blasted Lands in capital cities now leads directly to Hellfire Peninsula.\nLegion.\nFollowing &lt;a href=\"patch%207.3.5\"&gt;patch 7.3.5&lt;/a&gt;, level scaling was implemented in Outland, with maximum zone level being 80 (originally 70).\nIn the RPG.\nOutland consists of one large, central landmass with smaller chunks and debris floating all around it. Black chains connect some of these islands; adventurers can walk across these chains (they must be careful to avoid an unpleasant tumble into the Twisting Nether), fly, or in some cases jump to other islands. Outland is mostly bare and lifeless, like Draenor before its demise. The orcs built huge, black &lt;a href=\"fortress\"&gt;fortress&lt;/a&gt;es across their world, and some of them still stand. Burning Legion encampments and wretched draenei communities are scattered across the isles.\nAlthough Outland lies within and is part of the Twisting Nether, in many sources its properties are different than the Nether itself. Outland is described as having normal gravity, normal time, and finite shape and size. Although it is still alterably morphic, and many of its rocks defy gravity.\nDruids have magically replanted some locations on the central landmass of Outland that were formerly desolate, describing the areas as \"&lt;a href=\"Green%20Havens\"&gt;Green Havens&lt;/a&gt;\"."}

While initially hostile to the Gilneans, a pact formed between Darius Crowley and Ivar Bloodfang paved the way for the pack to ultimately join the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe Bloodfang worgen claim to have been in Silverpine prior to the arrival of the &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20Liberation%20Front\"&gt;Gilneas Liberation Front&lt;/a&gt;. According to statements from &lt;a href=\"Ivar%20Bloodfang\"&gt;Ivar Bloodfang&lt;/a&gt;, they hold resentment towards Gilneas, specifically Greymane, for having abandoned them and having left them to die beyond the &lt;a href=\"Greymane%20Wall\"&gt;Greymane Wall&lt;/a&gt;. They were part of &lt;a href=\"Alpha%20Prime\"&gt;Alpha Prime&lt;/a&gt;'s Wolf Cult under &lt;a href=\"Arugal\"&gt;Arugal&lt;/a&gt;, as all worgen in Silverpine were. It is unknown whether or not the Bloodfang were a pack of their own or were created after the destruction of the &lt;a href=\"Moonrage%20pack\"&gt;Moonrage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shadowfang%20pack\"&gt;Shadowfang&lt;/a&gt; packs.\nCataclysm.\nWhen the worgen attacks upon Gilneas first occurred, it was Bloodfang's worgen that led the charge. They swarmed the streets of &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20City\"&gt;Gilneas City&lt;/a&gt;; turning many into &lt;a href=\"Afflicted%20Gilnean\"&gt;Afflicted Gilnean&lt;/a&gt;s. This included former Northgate rebel, &lt;a href=\"Josiah%20Avery\"&gt;Josiah Avery&lt;/a&gt;, who proceeded to turn and bite an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; who would become one of Gilneas' champions. Following the death of Alpha Prime, &lt;a href=\"Ivar%20Bloodfang\"&gt;Ivar Bloodfang&lt;/a&gt; was seen as the alpha by the ferals of Silverpine.\nAfter witnessing the Forsaken's cruelty to their kind, the pack later joined forces with &lt;a href=\"Darius%20Crowley\"&gt;Darius Crowley&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20Liberation%20Front\"&gt;Gilneas Liberation Front&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt;. Ivar Bloodfang was present alongside Darius Crowley when meeting with the &lt;a href=\"Refugee%20Leadership\"&gt;Refugee Leadership&lt;/a&gt;. He and his pack later aided Crowley in distributing blood to the rest of the humans who had accepted the pact, turning them into &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Worgen\"&gt;Hillsbrad Worgen&lt;/a&gt;\nMembers of the Bloodfang pack can also be seen as having joined the &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20Liberation%20Front\"&gt;Gilneas Liberation Front&lt;/a&gt;, such as the &lt;a href=\"Bloodfang%20Scout\"&gt;Bloodfang Scout&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bloodfang%20Berserker\"&gt;Bloodfang Berserker&lt;/a&gt;. They managed to sabotage an orc fleet that came to help the Forsaken and ambush the undead. They also later aid with establishing the &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20Liberation%20Front%20Base%20Camp\"&gt;Gilneas Liberation Front Base Camp&lt;/a&gt;. After &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; captured &lt;a href=\"Lorna%20Crowley\"&gt;Lorna Crowley&lt;/a&gt; and used her as a bargaining chip in securing Crowley's surrender, the Bloodfang pack retreated from Silverpine to the contested areas of Gilneas.\nThe Bloodfang pack continued to oppose the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt; where they have allied with the &lt;a href=\"Stormpike%20Guard\"&gt;Stormpike Guard&lt;/a&gt;, with both sides jointly claiming &lt;a href=\"Purgation%20Isle\"&gt;Purgation Isle&lt;/a&gt;, and are attacking the Forsaken stationed at the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Southshore\"&gt;Ruins of Southshore&lt;/a&gt;.\nDespite Ivar's original apprehension about joining forces with Gilneas, the Bloodfang still assisted the Alliance even after the order was given to abandon and retreat from Silverpine Forest. It is seen that Ivar's opinion of Crowley has obviously dropped, he is still seen as being very willing to work with the Alliance despite the conditions of the original pact.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nThe Bloodfang Pack re-mobilizes back into Silverpine defeating Deathstalker Hayward and claiming [[Fenris Isle]]. The Horde proceeds to distract the Bloodfang forces, so that evacuations can continue across the Lake. They also lend forth [[Bloodfang Stalker]]s to aid with the Alliance war effort in the name of Gilneas.\nThey later mobilize with Gilneas into [[Darkshore]], led by their packleader himself.\nExploring Azeroth.\n[[File:IvarDarkshore.png|thumb|Ivar leading his packmembers in [[Darkshore]].]]\nWhen [[Mathias Shaw]] and [[Flynn Fairwind]] embarked on their journey to explore Azeroth as well as catalog the locations of various artifacts, they visited [[Silverpine Forest]].\nShaw noted his main contact in the area as [[Packleader Ivar Bloodfang]], stating that the packleader was his contact within [[Shadowfang Keep]]. The pack has apparently claimed it, alongside [[Fenris Isle]], and has taken most of the artifacts within the Shadowfang to Fenris Keep to be guarded closely.\nShaw notes that while the Bloodfang are their allies, they are so close to feral that he advises his spies to not let their guard down around them.\nDragonflight.\nA few years later, Fenris Isle and its keep has been claimed by the [[Scarlet Crusade]], who used it as their base operations during their attack on the [[Ruins of Lordaeron]]. Although they were defeated and driven out by the [[Forsaken]], it is unknown what happened to the Bloodfang and the artifacts they kept on the isle.\nReferences.\n[[Category:Gilneas]]\n[[Category:Shadowfang Keep]]\n[[Category:Silverpine Forest]]\n[[pl:Bloodfang pack]]"}

The only true cure for their disease would be to slay their leader, Bloodfury Ripper!\nShe is all but a queen to those filthy creatures. Slay her and their numbers will surely diminish.\nGo back into the Charred Vale and you will find her along the western hills. She will not be easy to vanquish, but the reward will be great.\nProgress.\nBloodfury Ripper is a nasty creature! You will have success finding her along the western hill line in the Charred Vale.\nThe bloodfuries will be helpless with out... surely we can vanquish them forever!\nCompletion.\nAlready I feel the anger leave me. What will I do with my time? Knowing evil moves near my land kept my thoughts moving, though now they are silent. Perhaps this is a good thing... maybe now I can focus on the good, as all tauren should.\nPlease accept this as a reward for your troubles.\nNotes.\nYou can pick up this quest in &lt;a href=\"Sun%20Rock%20Retreat\"&gt;Sun Rock Retreat&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Maggran%20Earthbinder\"&gt;Maggran Earthbinder&lt;/a&gt;, near the pool of water.

She stands out because she is blue-colored, while the other harpies are red and white.\nBeware that there are many other harpies and other creatures wandering through the vale and it is VERY easy to get unwanted adds. That said, this quest can be easily completed solo. (Prior to &lt;a href=\"Patch%202.3.0\"&gt;Patch 2.3.0&lt;/a&gt;, this was not the case, as Bloodfury Ripper was &lt;a href=\"elite\"&gt;elite&lt;/a&gt;.)"}

Every Bloodhoof chieftain during that time had wielded it in battle, the runespear always striking straight and true and had tasted the blood of many noble enemies. As tradition, every chieftain carved their story, in runes, into the shaft. Cairne being older, he had the opportunity to carve most of his own story into the shaft. He had planned to finish his story, but he would not get the chance to do so. The runespear would have become part of the inheritance of Cairne's son and heir, &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;.\nDestruction.\nUpon challenging acting &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; to a \"&lt;a href=\"mak%27gora\"&gt;mak'gora&lt;/a&gt;\" - a duel to the death - Cairne wielded the Bloodhoof Runespear, facing Garrosh's &lt;a href=\"Gorehowl\"&gt;Gorehowl&lt;/a&gt;. During the combat, Garrosh shattered the Runespear and proceeded to inflict a mortal wound (though it did not seem so to any observer); as a result Cairne was killed shortly thereafter. &lt;a href=\"Jevan%20Grimtotem\"&gt;Jevan \"Stormsong\" Grimtotem&lt;/a&gt; managed to secretly secure a fragment of the shaft as proof of his words of the High Chieftain's death to Baine, to whom he handed over the fragment. The other remnants of Cairne's Runespear were gathered and later placed on his funeral pyre afterwards, except for a fragment that was claimed by &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; as a memory of his old friend; the rune carved into the fragment was the rune for \"healing\", a meaning that did not escape Thrall. Whether Baine kept the fragment given to him by Stormsong is currently unknown.\nAppearance.\nThe majority of the haft of the runespear was covered in runes. When not in use, the runespear was usually strapped to the owner's back.\nPowers.\nAll of Cairne's weapons were blessed by a &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;, including the Bloodhoof Runespear. This allowed the runespear to strike and harm incorporeal spirits as if they were any solid opponent. Such a blessing might be usual of a tribal chieftain's or the High Chieftain's weapons.\nIn the RPG.\nThis spear has been handed down through many generations of the Bloodhoof line and is in the possession of Cairne Bloodhoof. Each owner carves his own major history into the shaft before passing it on to the next generation. Every inch of this massive spear is carved with tauren tribal runes. The runespear can return to its wielder when thrown. It allows its wielder to move more stealthily, particularly in plains of tall grass, and it hides his presence from animals."}

Here, young tauren receive the next tier of their training. It also serves as a military hub from which willing soldiers do battle with the nearby enemies. Located in the central plains of Mulgore, the village is the hub of questing and commerce until adventurers depart for &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt; to the north. Bloodhoof Village is also the principal location in which the wild &lt;a href=\"kodo\"&gt;kodo&lt;/a&gt; beasts are tamed and sold as &lt;a href=\"mount\"&gt;mount&lt;/a&gt;s for the tauren.\nIt is notable in that it was the first permanent settlement to be built by the tauren on flat, open ground rather than atop a mesa. This is significant because it represents the security the tauren feel in their new homeland.\nWhile &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; himself holds a certain fondness for the budding village, the pressing duties of leading a nation kept him in the capital of Thunder Bluff. In his stead, his son, &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;, led the tauren of the village and oversaw its protection from threats, until he took command in Thunder Bluff. While Baine focused on more day-to-day matters, the spiritual needs of the &lt;a href=\"Bloodhoof%20tribe\"&gt;Bloodhoof tribe&lt;/a&gt; and young tauren passing through are catered to by &lt;a href=\"Zarlman%20Two-Moons\"&gt;Zarlman Two-Moons&lt;/a&gt;.\nShortly before the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, right after Cairne Bloodhoof died in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Grimtotem%20tribe\"&gt;Grimtotem&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"assassin\"&gt;assassin&lt;/a&gt;s tried to kill Baine Bloodhoof but failed.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the village was invaded by &lt;a href=\"ghost\"&gt;ghost&lt;/a&gt;s. The attack was repelled by a tauren &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champion&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nBloodhoof Village is located in the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Plains\"&gt;Golden Plains&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Stonebull\"&gt;Lake Stonebull&lt;/a&gt; partially encircles the village.

After his manufactured defeat by &lt;a href=\"Magatha%20Grimtotem\"&gt;Magatha Grimtotem&lt;/a&gt; at the hands of &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, Cairne's son &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; is the new High Chieftain of the Bloodhoof clan and leader of the unified tauren tribes of Mulgore. Baine can now be found on the &lt;a href=\"High%20Rise\"&gt;High Rise&lt;/a&gt; in Thunder Bluff, the former seat of his father. The tauren can be found in all areas of the world, trying to restore the balance of the world which was lost during the occupation of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. The tauren owe allegiance to &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and the Horde due to their assistance in ridding Mulgore of the marauding &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt;s, thus giving the tauren a place to call home. However, along with many other of the Horde races, the tauren have become wary of the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s, after the defeat of their former High Chieftain, Cairne Bloodhoof by Garrosh Hellscream, albeit in a fixed contest. Baine Bloodhoof made an uneasy peace with Hellscream and the Horde after an apology by Garrosh but are still wary of the orcish core of the Horde along with the &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s and the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;, neither of which trust the leadership of Hellscream.\nBackground.\nThe orcs first met up with the Bloodhoof tribe when they arrived on &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;.\nShortly before the Horde's arrival on Kalimdor, their ships were caught in a storm. While most of Thrall's soldiers made it to land, their ships were destroyed and they did not all make landfall at the same point. Thus Thrall set out with the soldiers who'd been on board his ship to search for the rest of his forces. After discovering signs of a recent battle during their exploration of the new land, they found a single bull-like humanoid (which they would later know was called a \"tauren\") being attacked by a group of \"horse men\" (which they would later be told were known as \"centaurs\"). Thrall attacked the centaurs but was too late to save the tauren's life. It wasn't long before they stumbled on a similar sight: two more injured tauren being overwhelmed by a centaur band. Again, Thrall and his orcs and trolls got involved on behalf of the tauren, and again were unable to save their lives despite killing the centaurs.\nAfter finding some of his lost troops, Thrall's search for the others took him to higher ground, from which he was able to see a large army of centaurs in the canyon below. He noticed they were marching to the north.\nSoon after that, Thrall's force was attacked by yet another centaur band. After once again routing the centaurs, Thrall was approached by a trio of tauren led by an aged, yet large and strong, tauren who introduced himself as Cairne. Cairne complimented the \"greenskins\" on their fighting prowess. Thrall told Cairne his name and that of his people, the orcs. He went on to say that they had come across the sea seeking their destiny. Cairne told Thrall that there was an &lt;a href=\"Oracle\"&gt;Oracle&lt;/a&gt; to the north who might be able to help him, which prompted Thrall to mention the centaur army he had seen marching in that direction. Cairne was alarmed by the news, since it was clear to him that the centaurs were on their way to raid his village. He rushed off immediately along with his contingent. Wanting to learn more of the Oracle and also motivated by a desire to help, Thrall and his soldiers followed Cairne to the village where they successfully repulsed the centaur assault together.\nAfter the battle, Cairne told Thrall of his tauren plight. The centaurs had driven off all the game in the region and, in order to avoid starving, the tauren would have to travel across the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt; to Mulgore. Cairne worried that they would be overtaken by the swift centaurs before they could get there. Thrall pledged that he would escort the tauren to their destination and help protect their &lt;a href=\"kodo\"&gt;kodo&lt;/a&gt; beasts from attacks in return for being told the location of the Oracle. Cairne accepted the offer, and they were on their way. It was the beginning of a relationship of mutual respect and cooperation between the two peoples that continues to this day.\nThrall and his troops cleared the path of any centaurs standing in the way of the caravan while Cairne and his tauren fought off repeated attacks from behind aimed at the vulnerable kodos. When the caravan had almost reached its destination, Thrall saw a huge force of centaur charging at them. The orc Warchief despaired that they wouldn't make it. But Cairne would not allow himself to be defeated when he was so close to his objective, and used his might to start a rockslide that blocked the way of the centaurs.\nThe two peoples parted as friends, with the orc and troll force going to find the Oracle as well as their brethren (&lt;a href=\"Grom%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grom Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20clan\"&gt;Warsongs&lt;/a&gt; were still unaccounted for), while the tauren left to search for a site on which to build their new home. Grateful for Thrall's assistance, Cairne gave him a number of kodos which proved to be quite useful as the Horde continued their journey.\nWith the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s' help, &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne&lt;/a&gt; and his Bloodhoof tribe were able to drive back the &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt; and claim the grasslands of &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt; for their own. For the first time in hundreds of years, the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; had a land to call their own. Upon the windswept mesa of &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt;, Cairne built a refuge for his people, where tauren of every tribe is welcome.

There is an ogron that paths here; you can get past once he gets all the way west and stands there. If you want to be extra sure, you can wait or follow him to the east and he'll turn the corner to continue on to the crane.\nContinue on past Yrel and the train to the end of the tracks and just around the left corner (to the west), where the explosives is guarded by a single grunt.\nThere is a rope ladder at the end of this dock, (55.49, 14.80) that you could use to get here, but unless you have a reliable stealth ability, you will have to fight several mobs at once."}

His boat was sent to the bottom shortly thereafter.\n&lt;a href=\"Kurdran%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Kurdran Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"gryphon%20rider\"&gt;gryphon rider&lt;/a&gt;s joined the battle shortly afterward, killing several dragon riders while their gryphons slaughtered the dragons. The remaining dragon riders fled and were pursued by Kurdran and his brethren, allowing Admiral Proudmoore to focus on destroying the orcish navy, ensuring his son's death wasn't in vain. Daelin never forgot his child's death, and his hatred of the orcs continued to fester like an open wound for the rest of his life. The wreck of Derek's fleet can still be found to this day on the coast of the &lt;a href=\"Wetlands\"&gt;Wetlands&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Derek%20Proudmoore%20%28grave%29\"&gt;Derek's grave&lt;/a&gt; can be found at &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Admiral%27s%20Rest\"&gt;Lord Admiral's Rest&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Boralus\"&gt;Boralus&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, Derek Proudmoore's body was found by deep-sea diving from the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; ship \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Banshee%27s%20Wail\"&gt;The Banshee's Wail&lt;/a&gt;\". The Horde had not been expecting to find him, they had been looking for &lt;a href=\"Marshal%20M.%20Valentine\"&gt;Marshal M. Valentine&lt;/a&gt; instead. The body was used as bait to lure Derek's mother, Katherine, away from &lt;a href=\"Boralus\"&gt;Boralus&lt;/a&gt;, as a distraction while Horde agents infiltrated the city to steal the &lt;a href=\"%3AAbyssal%20Scepter\"&gt;:Abyssal Scepter&lt;/a&gt;. The body was then brought back to &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt;.\nTides of Vengeance.\n&lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; saw Derek as a valuable weapon, a dagger to plunge into the hearts of the &lt;a href=\"House%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Proudmoores&lt;/a&gt; when the time was right. After the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Dazar%27alor%20%28battle%29\"&gt;Battle of Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt; and death of the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; king &lt;a href=\"Rastakhan\"&gt;Rastakhan&lt;/a&gt;, Sylvanas raised Derek's corpse to make him a &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;. Derek was horrified and confused at what had happened to him and begged for help and for his family. Sylvanas planned to twist him to become a weapon against Jaina and Katherine.\nIn the end, this plan did not come to fruition as &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; (with the help of &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Zelling\"&gt;Thomas Zelling&lt;/a&gt;) later freed Derek, secretly stole \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Swift%20Vengeance\"&gt;The Swift Vengeance&lt;/a&gt;\", and took him to meet with Jaina outside the &lt;a href=\"ruins%20of%20Theramore\"&gt;ruins of Theramore&lt;/a&gt;, the city Jaina had once ruled. While Jaina was furious that the Horde had risen her brother and rightly surmised that he was meant to be a weapon, she calmed down when she realized his will was still his own. Derek knew he could not return home to Kul Tiras; Jaina promised her intent to bring him home eventually, but in the meantime wished to bring him to someone who could help him, and that they would face his future together as a family.\nEventually, Jaina brought Derek to meet with &lt;a href=\"Calia%20Menethil\"&gt;Calia Menethil&lt;/a&gt;.\nRise of Azshara.\nIn time, &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;'s revolutionaries clashed with &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;'s loyalists, which saw the conflict ending in Saurfang's death and Sylvanas's abandonment of the Horde. In the aftermath, Jaina met with Calia and Derek at &lt;a href=\"Seabreeze%20Village\"&gt;Seabreeze Village&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormsong%20Valley\"&gt;Stormsong Valley&lt;/a&gt;. During this meeting, Calia and Derek learned that the war was over and it was implied that Calia and Derek had grown close. As the three conversed the Proudmoore siblings remarked that &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;others&lt;/a&gt; would benefit from Calia's guidance, much like Derek had. Unbeknownst to the three, the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Speaker of the Horde&lt;/a&gt; was spying on their meeting at the behest of &lt;a href=\"Lilian%20Voss\"&gt;Lilian Voss&lt;/a&gt;, who after being informed of the details remarked that she must act quickly.\nVisions of N'Zoth.\nAround the time of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Empire\"&gt;Black Empire&lt;/a&gt;'s assault on Azeroth, Calia invited Jaina and Derek to another meeting in Stormsong Valley. She informed them that she had decided to leave Kul Tiras after receiving a letter from Lilian Voss asking her to help the Forsaken in the wake of their abandonment by Sylvanas. To Calia's surprise, Derek decided to accompany her, stating that while he would always be a Proudmoore, he had changed and it was time to \"see where the tides [would] take [him]\". Jaina accepted Calia and Derek's decisions but insisted on first bringing them to Katherine and Tandred so they could get a proper farewell. Calia and Derek traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Calston%20Estate\"&gt;Calston Estate&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt;, where Lilian apologized for her role in Derek's rebirth and introduced the two to &lt;a href=\"Delaryn%20Summermoon\"&gt;Delaryn Summermoon&lt;/a&gt; and the other Forsaken &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;, who had likewise been abandoned by Sylvanas. Calia and Derek quickly offered to help the undead elves and subsequently left the estate with them, vowing to help them find a future rooted in something beyond hatred and malice.\nShadows Rising.\nKnowing that the Forsaken couldn't remain in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; forever, Lilian and Calia sought a new home for their people, while believing that the ruins of Lordaeron could one day be reclaimed and their homes there restored. Despite the truce between the Horde and Alliance, they knew that the Alliance ships wouldn't be happy to see Horde flags at sea, though Calia was confident that Derek could intervene on their behalf if they were intercepted. When &lt;a href=\"Talanji\"&gt;Queen Talanji&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Empire\"&gt;Zandalari Empire&lt;/a&gt; objected to peace with the Alliance and subsequently &lt;a href=\"House%20Proudmoore\"&gt;House Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, Voss was quick to remind her that Derek was one of the Forsaken and that the Forsaken were the Horde.\nShadowlands.\nAfter the Forsaken started rebuilding &lt;a href=\"Brill\"&gt;Brill&lt;/a&gt;, he ventured into the town, accompanied by &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Amalia%20Stone\"&gt;Captain Amalia Stone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Forsaken%20Soldier%20%28Tirisfal%20Glades%29\"&gt;Forsaken Soldiers&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce the Forsaken reclaimed the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Ruins of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, he became the &lt;a href=\"Champion%20%28rank%29\"&gt;Champion&lt;/a&gt; of Pallid Lady Calia Menethil.\nThe Vow Eternal.\nDerek, accompanied by Calia and Voss, were among those who attended the wedding of &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thalyssra\"&gt;Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt;. The Forsaken spoke with &lt;a href=\"Taelia%20Fordragon\"&gt;Taelia Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt; during the reception, where Derek expressed his disappointment that Jaina wasn't able to come. After they realized that &lt;a href=\"Mia%20Greymane\"&gt;Mia Greymane&lt;/a&gt; had gone to the wedding in &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;her husband's&lt;/a&gt; stead, the three Forsaken exchanged uncomfortable glances, with Calia remarking that it was a pleasure to see the queen again.\nQuotes.\nWhere... am I?\nAt last, there is a place for me.\nSpeculation.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Cursed%20Eye%20of%20Paleth\"&gt;Cursed Eye of Paleth&lt;/a&gt; may be the reason Derek's corpse was in an almost pristine state after being thirty years underwater, similar to how the corpse of &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Halyndor\"&gt;Captain Halyndor&lt;/a&gt; is still intact."}

In &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Reginald%20Windsor\"&gt;Marshall Windsor&lt;/a&gt; goes missing after stumbling upon clues to the disappearance of &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian&lt;/a&gt;. It's off to &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Depths\"&gt;Blackrock Depths&lt;/a&gt; for our heroes \u2014 but are they prepared for what they will find?\nPlot.\nFollowing the battle of &lt;a href=\"Thandol%20Span\"&gt;Thandol Span&lt;/a&gt;, King Magni returns to Ironforge with Lo'Gosh, &lt;a href=\"Broll%20Bearmantle\"&gt;Broll&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thargas%20Anvilmar\"&gt;Thargas&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Valeera%20Sanguinar\"&gt;Valeera&lt;/a&gt; aboard the &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; dirigible. A crowd gathered outside the &lt;a href=\"Gates%20of%20Ironforge\"&gt;city gates&lt;/a&gt; exchange whispers about the newcomers: pointing out that Lo'Gosh looks almost identical to King Varian, except for his facial scar; the oddness of Broll's antlers, with one onlooker even speculating that he is actually a returned &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;; and surprise over the fact that Magni would welcome a &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elf&lt;/a&gt; to Ironforge.\nAs the group walks inside, Magni initially calls Lo'Gosh \"Varian\", but the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; points out that it might be safest if he remained as simply \"Lo'Gosh\" for now. Magni explains that &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Prince Anduin&lt;/a&gt; has asked &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; to look into his father's disappearance and return, and Magni himself has talked to both Bolvar and Varian's old friend &lt;a href=\"Reginald%20Windsor\"&gt;Reginald Windsor&lt;/a&gt; about what's amiss. Like Magni, Windsor was troubled by Varian's passiveness and began investigating the possibility that an impostor \u2014 possibly even a &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 had taken the king's place.\nValeera tells Broll that she hungers for magic. She suddenly notices a human approaching Lo'Gosh with a dagger burning with &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; energy. Exclaiming that she \"must have it\", Valeera leaps up behind the human, curses in &lt;a href=\"Eredun\"&gt;Eredun&lt;/a&gt;, and stabs him in the back. Enraged, the man reveals his true form by transforming into a &lt;a href=\"black%20drake\"&gt;black drake&lt;/a&gt; but flies off after Lo'Gosh hurls an axe at him. The crowd is awed by the three strangers having just fought off a dragon. One of the onlookers asks who the dragon was, and another explains that he called himself &lt;a href=\"Kalaran\"&gt;Kalaran Windblade&lt;/a&gt; and posed as a spy reporting on &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;Dark Iron&lt;/a&gt; activity. Still in a frenzy, Valeera continues screaming in Eredun and tries to attack Broll until she passes out. Broll concludes that it's now pretty obvious that the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; is somehow involved in the attempts on Lo'Gosh's life.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, Anduin and \"Varian\" are out riding with &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Katrana&lt;/a&gt;, Bolvar, and some guardsmen. While near a particularly treacherous part of the trail, Anduin begins telling his father of Marshal Windsor's theory about what's been going on in Stormwind. Suddenly, however, someone behind them throws a rock that strikes the leg of Anduin's horse, causing it to lose its footing and fall off a nearby cliff. Varian throws himself forward and manages to grab hold of Anduin's arm with one hand and the cliff ledge with his other hand. As he holds his son, Varian is suddenly enveloped by visions of the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;, of being tortured by hooded wizards, of being attacked by &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;, and of another cliff and almost certain death where salvation seems just out of reach. Varian and Anduin are pulled to safety by the guards and resume their ride. The king recounts the rush of memories he experienced, but Bolvar notices that he seems to become befuddled as soon as Katrana touches his chin. Bolvar decides that Anduin is right to ask questions about Varian's disappearance and, for the time being, they would all do well to stay as far away from Lady Prestor as possible.\nBolvar contacts King Magni in Ironforge via scrying glass. Magni confirms that Marshal Windsor was right and that black dragons are definitely involved in \"this Stormwind business\". Bolvar states that Windsor's last report indicated that he was close to discovering the dragon's identity, but now &lt;a href=\"Marshal%20Maxwell\"&gt;Marshal Maxwell&lt;/a&gt; reports that Windsor is held captive by the Dark Irons in &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Depths\"&gt;Blackrock Depths&lt;/a&gt;.\nLater, Lo'Gosh, Thargas, Broll, Magni, and Valeera discuss the matter and decide to sneak into Blackrock Depths to rescue Windsor. However, Valeera is outraged when Lo'Gosh informs her that she will not be coming with them. Broll concurs, stating that Blackrock Depths is littered with &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; and arcane artifacts and that they can't risk Valeera reaching out for the relics and betraying the group's need for secrecy. He tells her that Magni will keep Valeera in a chamber in Ironforge until her craving for fel has lessened and she is herself again. From a chamber high up in the city, Valeera watches her friends leave and throws a bowl of Broll's herbal draught across the room in rage, before beginning to sob and planning to escape and go after them.\nLo'Gosh, Broll, and Thargas enter Blackrock Depths, killing a guard patrol and approaching &lt;a href=\"Golem%20Lord%20Argelmach\"&gt;Golem Lord Argelmach&lt;/a&gt;'s chamber. Thargas explains that &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; has found a way to create beings of living stone, with one such &lt;a href=\"war%20golem\"&gt;war golem&lt;/a&gt; being what they faced on Thandol Span, and that Argelmach is creating an army of such constructs in his lab. Moments later, the group runs into the golem lord, who sends his creations against the intruders. While Thargas and Broll fight the golems, Lo'Gosh kills Argelmach by slicing him across the throat. As the trio continue deeper into the mountain, they overhear Marshal Windsor being tortured by &lt;a href=\"High%20Interrogator%20Gerstahn\"&gt;High Interrogator Gerstahn&lt;/a&gt;, whom Thargas is painfully familiar with and who is trying to find out why Windsor was spying in &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt; when he was captured by the Dark Irons.\nMeanwhile, in her cell in Ironforge, a delirious Valeera sees a vision of her dead parents expressing contempt for the friends who have \"abandoned\" the elf in her cell, before also scolding their daughter for her weakness and disappearing through a nearby door. Desperate to catch up with her parents, Valeera attemps to follow them and ends up falling a great height down a ledge and crashing into the snow outside. Her parents appear again and begin to tell her that the world is corrupt, that it can &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;only be cleansed by death&lt;/a&gt;, and that she should join them in letting the world begin anew. Suddenly, however, a ray of light appears and Valeera hears &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt;'s voice banishing the creatures. A vision of Aegwynn explains that &lt;a href=\"Kathra%27natir\"&gt;a demon of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; is trying to possess Valeera, and that while the former &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt; does not have the power to completely dispel his influence, she can help Valeera fight his attempts to control her. The blood elf finds herself back in her cell, where Aegwynn reminds her that she is not alone, and that there are people who care about her and will not abandon her.\nIn the Blackrock Depths, Thargas storms into Gerstahn's chamber and kills her with a single blow from his hammer while Lo'Gosh frees Windsor from his bonds and confirms that he knows the identity of the dragon that has been orchestrating the recent calamities. The group begins hurrying out of the depths but are intercepted by a Dark Iron patrol accompanied by a &lt;a href=\"fire%20elemental\"&gt;fire elemental&lt;/a&gt;. However, the chase is cut short when the heroes cross the bridge that surrounds &lt;a href=\"the%20Black%20Anvil\"&gt;the Black Anvil&lt;/a&gt; and the pursuing elemental ends up burning itself right through the unsupported part of the bridge and into the lava below. Lo'Gosh's party are able to make the rest of their exit unchallenged and return to Ironforge.\nBack at the city, the party is greeted by Valeera, who has now recovered from the curse; the fel runes from the &lt;a href=\"Mark%20of%20Kathra%27natir\"&gt;Mark of Kathra'natir&lt;/a&gt; are no longer visible on her skin. As they now know the identity of the dragon, Magni will allow Valeera to go with her friends. As for Magni himself, he emerges from the city to welcome Varian and Windsor back and invites them inside to discuss strategy, after which they are to ride for Stormwind to destroy the dragon and retake Varian's rightful place as king."}

Stareye was bitterly xenophobic and refused to use the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"earthen\"&gt;earthen&lt;/a&gt; forces to their abilities. Stareye was so despotic that he refused the counsel of &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Krasus\"&gt;Krasus&lt;/a&gt; on the grounds that they were not &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;. When Stareye was killed by the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; during a disastrous tactic on the front lines, his loss was not mourned. &lt;a href=\"Jarod%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Jarod Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; assumed command and was so successful in erasing Stareye's mistakes that he can be credited for improved night elf relations with the other races. \nBackground.\nLord Desdel Stareye was a noble who served as second-in-command to Lord &lt;a href=\"Kur%27talos%20Ravencrest\"&gt;Kur'talos Ravencrest&lt;/a&gt;, the initial commander of &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Resistance\"&gt;the night elf army&lt;/a&gt; that fought the first invasion of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Secure in his aristocratic lineage, Desdel was proud of his high rank and, in the absence of armed conflict, had formed a high opinion of his combat abilities by the time the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; began. \nWhen Kur'talos was assassinated by an agent of the queen, Desdel quickly assumed command of the army. To his shock, the invading demons proved far more difficult foes than he had anticipated. Desdel began to get the impression that the army he commanded had no faith in his tactics. Abandoning his polite attempts at diplomacy, Desdel did his best to make it clear that he expected both respect and obedience. When the forces of the Legion began to retreat, Desdel triumphantly ordered the night elves to give chase. He was sure that his strategies had the Legion on the run. Instead, the demons unleashed a deadly trap, attacking the unsuspecting night elves from the air. Desdel watched helplessly as the demons began pouring containers of boiling red liquid over the night elf army. In seconds, hundreds of troops were injured, some mortally. Captain &lt;a href=\"Jarod%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Jarod Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; rode to Desdel and asked for orders, but the panicked noble had none to give. Jarod caught sight of another group of demons hovering over Desdel, and so Jarod tried to pull Desdel out of the way. Infuriated at the upstart captain's lack of respect for superior rank and bloodline, Desdel ordered Jarod away on pain of imprisonment.\nIt was the last mistake Desdel would make. Jarod yanked his mount aside just in time to avoid an agonizing death. The demons turned over their container, and boiling liquid poured down on Desdel and his nearby companions. Desdel was burned to death in moments, his face maimed beyond recognition. Not long after Desdel's death, Jarod became the new head of the night elf army.\nLegion.\nThe forces of Black Rook Hold were revived by to protect secrets within the tower, Desdel included. They could not see the living for what they truly were and believed them to be demons. Stareye was put in charge of the hold's prisons and tortured &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; for weeks in the &lt;a href=\"Darkpens\"&gt;Darkpens&lt;/a&gt; area of &lt;a href=\"Ravencourt\"&gt;Ravencourt&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Black%20Rook%20Hold\"&gt;Black Rook Hold&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Val%27sharah\"&gt;Val'sharah&lt;/a&gt; before she was freed by Jarod and an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;. Together, Maiev and Jarod gave Desdel a second death."}

(However, they are likely highly resistant to your spells and will take little damage from you!)\nYellow names.\nIf the overhead name of a player is yellow to you, this signifies that the unit in question is unfriendly to you and that you can attack it (their &lt;a href=\"PvP%20Flag\"&gt;PvP Flag&lt;/a&gt; is on), but you do not currently have your &lt;a href=\"PvP%20Flag\"&gt;PvP Flag&lt;/a&gt; on. When you engage in combat with them, their names will turn red and your &lt;a href=\"PvP%20Flag\"&gt;PvP Flag&lt;/a&gt; will be turned on. If the overhead name of a &lt;a href=\"Mob\"&gt;Mob&lt;/a&gt; is yellow to you, that means that it is non-hostile and does not have an aggro radius. However, if it is attacked, it will fight against its attacker. If the overhead name of an &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt; which is part of a &lt;a href=\"Faction\"&gt;Faction&lt;/a&gt; is yellow to you, that means that you are currently &lt;a href=\"Neutral\"&gt;Neutral&lt;/a&gt; with that &lt;a href=\"Faction\"&gt;Faction&lt;/a&gt;.\nYellow recipes.\nIn your &lt;a href=\"profession\"&gt;profession&lt;/a&gt; window, a recipe shown in yellow will often give you a &lt;a href=\"skillup\"&gt;skillup&lt;/a&gt; when used.

Obtaining it provided the &lt;a href=\"Feat%20of%20Strength\"&gt;Feat of Strength&lt;/a&gt; .\nSource.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"Brewfest\"&gt;Brewfest&lt;/a&gt; 2007, this item was a quest reward from\nUse.\n&lt;a href=\"Equip\"&gt;Equip&lt;/a&gt;ping an empty Yellow Brewfest Stein, then using a &lt;a href=\"Brewfest%20Festive%20Keg\"&gt;Brewfest Festive Keg&lt;/a&gt; will convert the stein into a Filled Yellow Brewfest Stein, containing a one charge sample of the beer from the barrel. The filled stein can then be used, drinking from it, which converts the stein back to an empty Yellow Brewfest Stein. The imbiber gets the effects of the particular beer that was sampled. The full or empty stein must be equipped to be used. \nVarieties.\nEach of the three Brewfest Festive Kegs contains a different sample brew, so, depending on what barrel the owner fills their stein at, their Brewfest Stein will have a different sample of brew. Each full stein with a different brew is a different item, as is the empty mug. There are two icons, one for the empty stein and one for the full steins. \nEach Brewfest Festive Keg is near to one of the brew vendor tents. Each brewer vends three different strengths of brew, but the breweries specialize in a low, medium, or high strength range of brews. Stronger brews are higher level, restore more &lt;a href=\"mana\"&gt;mana&lt;/a&gt;, have stronger &lt;a href=\"buff\"&gt;buff&lt;/a&gt;s, and have a higher character level requirement to use. Each of three brews available from the Festive Kegs are the same as one of the three brews being vended by the brewer nearest that keg. \nThe &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; brews are different brews but have equivalent effects. The Barleybrew dwarves' and Drohn's orcs' brews are the weak, low level range. The sample nearest them is the level one sample, the weakest at the Brewfest, and can be sampled by all attendees. Thunderbrew dwarves and T'chali's trolls have mid-range brews. The Gordok Ogres are shared by both factions, and have the strongest, highest level brews.\nNote: The Festive Kegs are neutral and inanimate. You should be able to use the opposing faction's Festive Kegs, if you can get to them. \nYou can fill your mug with any of the three brews. The only way to empty your mug is to drink it (use it). Drinking from your stein and refilling at a different Brewfest Festive Keg switches between brews. \nAnyone can fill their stein from any of the kegs. Since each beer has a minimum level associated with it, but the stein does not, you can drink a brew from your mug that has a higher level requirement than you are, but you will not get the buff. Instead you get a brief \"&lt;a href=\"Can%27t%20Hold%20Your%20Brew\"&gt;Can't Hold Your Brew&lt;/a&gt;\" debuff with a 'getting sick' graphic and a message warning you not to drink the big kids' drink. \nNote that the Alliance/Horde brews may be available in neutral cities as well.\nQuotes.\nThis is the flavor text for each brew. Note that the quotes for the 2007 Stein are different than the quotes for the 2008 Stein. \nNotes.\nHistoric note.\nApparently, this aspect of the Brewfest has changed for 2008, or these statements were misleadingly worded:\nDark Iron Dwarf invasion.\nYou fill at the same Brewfest Festive Kegs that the Dark Iron Dwarves attack when they invade. If the Dark Iron Dwarves succeed in destroying a Brewfest Festive Keg, you will be unable to fill your mug from that keg until it respawns. The destroyed keg will get a destroyed graphic with a caved in front, then disappear as the Dark Iron Dwarves depart. \nUniqueness.\nThe Yellow Brewfest Stein is unique. Since the empty and filled forms are different, uniqueness might not apply, but the mug is soulbound and you only get the quest once in 2007, so you'll only have one anyway. "}

When the family manor was hit with a surprise bandit raid while much of the house guard was out fighting the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, Yernim hid the artifacts in the kitchen, filling the priceless chalice of opal voices with gravy, tossing the ancient sword &lt;a href=\"Trol%27kalar\"&gt;Trol'kalar&lt;/a&gt; into the pile of pig offal and putting the cloak of elemental protection on himself and jumping into the massive kitchen fire to hide. \n&lt;a href=\"Liam%20Trollbane\"&gt;Prince Liam&lt;/a&gt;, grandfather of &lt;a href=\"Galen%20Trollbane\"&gt;Galen Trollbane&lt;/a&gt;, was so impressed with his servant's ingenuity that he appointed him Caretaker of Artifacts with a staff of two, and commanded the young servant to come up with a better plan to protect the artifacts. Yernim had stonemasons carve another room out of the rock of the Trollbane Family Crypt for the artifacts, wisely allowing room for more artifacts as time went on. He took his underlings and taught them how to care for the artifacts properly, what each of them could do in case they needed to know for their own safety or if the artifacts were in danger (like he knew to hide in the fire with the cloak), and preservation methods. \nWhen nobles of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; would visit Prince Liam, he would proudly tell the story of how Yernim had protected the family heirlooms while the guard was away. The other nobles were so much impressed with the system he had built that they asked to borrow Yernim for designing similar setups for their artifacts. Yernim, perhaps showing himself wiser than these great lords and ladies, mentioned they probably wouldn't want him knowing all of their secrets. He instructed them, with Prince Liam's approval, to send five trusted servants to him for training. Thus the continentwide training of the &lt;a href=\"Caretakers\"&gt;Caretakers&lt;/a&gt; began."}
