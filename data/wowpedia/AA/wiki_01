After Beauty's mate, &lt;a href=\"The%20Beast\"&gt;Beast&lt;/a&gt;, was slain by heroes in &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;, the hound and its four remaining pups joined forces with the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;, intent on punishing the creatures who killed its mate.\"\nStrategy.\nSpot, Buster, and Lucky are positioned in front of Beauty near the mouth of her cave. On Normal mode, you may pull them away and kill them before engaging Beauty, but on Heroic mode Beauty pulls with them so you will have to CC them to the best of your abilities. This is simplified somewhat on Heroic mode as only two pups spawn. If you cannot CC all the pups then any remaining pups will have to be burned down to avoid being overwhelmed by their AoE Lava Drool. Runty is situated in the back of the room and your group should have little trouble avoiding him entirely as he does not pull with Beauty regardless of what mode you're on. However take note that if somehow Runty is killed Beauty will enrage and quickly wipe the group.\nOnce the pups have been dealt with by either CC or death Beauty herself is a fairly simple tank and spank. Ideally, she should be tanked close front of the cave away from Runty so any Beauty's knock back and fear abilities don't accidentally pull him. Besides all of this, Beauty's abilities are healed through easily and most groups should have little problem downing her as long as Runty is avoided and the other pups are CC'd or killed.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

It is a &lt;a href=\"fel%20reaver\"&gt;fel reaver&lt;/a&gt; built by the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; and taken by &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; as a guardian for his palace, residing in &lt;a href=\"Eye%20%28Tempest%20Keep%29\"&gt;the Eye&lt;/a&gt;.\nPositioning.\nThe melee group fights in the center of the room.\nRanged and healers stay in a wide circle around the boss, at the maximum range of their abilities, in order to maximize available space and travel time for the Arcane Orbs. Well-geared Resto Shaman can consider staying with the melee group - this means that they take Pounding damage too, but never have to interrupt their &lt;a href=\"Chain%20Heal\"&gt;Chain Heal&lt;/a&gt; spam to evade Arcane Orbs. This tactic also works with a decently geared priest in the melee, as Prayer of Healing easily heals through the damage while conserving mana.\nCombat.\nThe encounter does not have different stages and is exactly the same from 100% to 0%. All raid members should be kept as close to full HP as possible, to increase their chance to survive an Arcane Orb or Pounding.\nDue to the aggro reduction caused by Knockback, the main tank eventually loses aggro, and a tank rotation should be set up to counter this. Three tanks are necessary, and four are sometimes used. Void Reaver is not tauntable.\nIf three, or even two tanks are unable to stay at the top of the threat list, or if you need more dps, one tank with a high level of avoidance (dodge and/or parry), in combination with hunter misdirects can essentially solo tank this fight. The aggro drop from knockback is roughly 10k to 12k threat, with a few misdirects and a extremely well geared tank, it can be done. Items like Moroes' Lucky Pocketwatch can aid in this. \nArcane Orb.\nThe Arcane Orbs should be avoided by running away. Ranged players should never run towards the melee, as this may cause an Orb to hit the melee. The room is large, and the orbs move relatively slow. Healers can stand with their backs to the Reaver, so that they can start running as soon as they see an incoming orb. Ranged dps should be spread out as much as possible for the entire fight, and at or near their maximum attack range.\nRanged dps should use their Maximum Camera Distance setting and look more up into the sky than usual. Early accurate recognition of the threatening Orbs is important for this fight. Ranged dps may want to use, \"strafe moving\" to make it easier to watch for new Orbs while running from an existing Orb. Some ranged DPSers may want to equip their &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Badge\"&gt;Violet Badge&lt;/a&gt; which gives a 13.5% chance to fully &lt;a href=\"resist\"&gt;resist&lt;/a&gt; the Orb's &lt;a href=\"binary%20spell\"&gt;binary spell&lt;/a&gt; damage. All players should have the buff, Mark of the Wild. Mage's Ice Block appears to effectively cancel an Orb's damage.\nNote (1-28-2008): Currently the graphics do not match the explosion. The explosion will go off before the graphic \"hits\". It is best to begin moving within the first second, so as to be well out of range.\nStarting with &lt;a href=\"Patch%202.4.0\"&gt;Patch 2.4.0&lt;/a&gt; the Void Reaver stopped targeting a player before casting an Arcane Orb, so &lt;a href=\"Add%20Ons\"&gt;Add Ons&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"Deadly%20Boss%20Mods\"&gt;Deadly Boss Mods&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"BigWigs\"&gt;BigWigs&lt;/a&gt; did not warn players of incoming Orbs.\nAs of &lt;a href=\"Patch%202.4.3\"&gt;Patch 2.4.3&lt;/a&gt; there's now a combat log entry for cast orbs, the warnings from &lt;a href=\"BigWigs\"&gt;BigWigs&lt;/a&gt; work, and as of July 2008, Deadly Boss Mods was giving targeted players a warning.\nPounding.\nThe easiest solution is to have the melee group eat the Pounding damage and heal through it. Circle of Healing is very effective, however if you do not have a priest with this then a shaman with chain heal can sometimes fulfil this role. In order to make &lt;a href=\"Chain%20Heal\"&gt;Chain Heal&lt;/a&gt; as effective as possible, the melee group should stay close together in this case. Rogues can use Cloak of Shadows right before VR starts Pounding to resist the arcane damage.\nIf the healers are not up to that challenge, it's possible to avoid the Pounding damage by running out of it. The Void Reavers hit box is nearly as large as the Pounding's AoE, stepping out of the damage doesn't cost that much DPS. The bigger problem is that they may be targeted by an Arcane Orb while outside the Pounding range. Therefore, the melee group should disperse when this tactic is used.\nAggro.\nSince the fight is on a 10 minute timer, all DPS classes need to maximize their damage output while paying attention to their aggro. Threat-reducing abilities such as &lt;a href=\"Vanish\"&gt;Vanish&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Soulshatter%20%28warlock%20ability%29\"&gt;Soulshatter (warlock ability)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blessing%20of%20Salvation\"&gt;Blessing of Salvation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cower%20%28Druid%29\"&gt;Cower&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Feign%20Death\"&gt;Feign Death&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Invisibility\"&gt;Invisibility&lt;/a&gt; are invaluable. If Shamans are present in DPS groups, they should consider whether to drop a damage increasing Air Totem (like &lt;a href=\"Windfury%20Totem\"&gt;Windfury Totem&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20Air%20Totem\"&gt;Wrath of Air Totem&lt;/a&gt;), or a threat reducing &lt;a href=\"Tranquil%20Air%20Totem%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Tranquil Air Totem (Classic)&lt;/a&gt;. Shadow priests should refrain from using &lt;a href=\"Vampiric%20Embrace\"&gt;Vampiric Embrace&lt;/a&gt; to avoid healing based threat. This fight is like &lt;a href=\"Broodlord\"&gt;Broodlord&lt;/a&gt; - the more tanks the higher the threat that can be generated as every tank takes fewer knockbacks.\nAlternate Tactic.\nIf the ranged DPS/Healers are having issues with avoiding the orbs, an alternate tactic is possible. It can done with 1 non-CoH Priest, 2 CoH Priests, 1 Resto Shaman, 2 Paladins and 1 Resto Druid, but it's easier with one more CoH-Priest or Resto Shaman. You also need at least 1, but preferably 2, classes that have an easy time moving at range.\nThe basic idea is that everyone, except the Hunters, run to the middle and park themselves under Void Reaver. The Hunters will stay at range and proceed to avoid Orbs like normal, though not really caring much about their DPS. When the Pounding hits the group, all AoE healers take care of the group while the Paladins heal the tanks, tossing other people heals should it be needed. This makes the fight even simpler, assuming people make sure they move if a Tank gets knocked back and VR follows and that tank and the Hunters/kiters don't get too close to melee, which will instantly lead to a wipe.\nThe advantages of this method are; DPSers don't have to move and can just continue nuking, and healers don't risk being out of range of the tanks. The cons are; Everyone takes more damage (though not terribly hard to heal through, especially not if everyone brings their &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Badge\"&gt;Violet Badge&lt;/a&gt;) and if an orb for any reason hits the raid, it's likely to cause a wipe.\nSolo strategy.\nThis is a very different fight for casters and non-casters. Any specs not affected by &lt;a href=\"silence%20effect\"&gt;silence effect&lt;/a&gt;s may stand at Void Reaver's feet and melee it from 100% to 0%, ignoring the Arcane Orb mechanic for the entire encounter. Pounding and Knock Away are both inconsequential amounts of damage.\nCasters will find this encounter's difficulty level entirely dependent upon how well they can do damage on the move. From the very beginning of the encounter, start circle-strafing around the Void Reaver and do not stop moving, applying any instant-cast (or cast-on-the-move) abilities judiciously. For specs where that is more difficult (such as frost mages), still keep moving, but stop as soon as an orb lands, wind up a quick cast, then start running. Repeat from full health to death.\nQuotes.\nSound Files.\nSee \"&lt;a href=\"PlaySoundFile%20macros%20-%20Outland%20instance%20sounds%23.C2.A0Void%20Reaver\"&gt;Sound files of Tempest Keep: Void reaver&lt;/a&gt;\""}

Two tabs are available, storing up to 80 items each, unlockable each time for every &lt;a href=\"character\"&gt;character&lt;/a&gt;.\nVoid Storage was invented by the &lt;a href=\"ethereal\"&gt;ethereal&lt;/a&gt;s, who utilized their &lt;a href=\"technomancy\"&gt;technomancy&lt;/a&gt; to create an apparatus through which a pocket dimension can be accessed.\nOfficial preview.\n\"In patch 4.3, characters of all levels will be able to take advantage of a new technology known as \u201cVoid Storage\u201d, which will open up 80 slots of long-term storage space. Void Storage vaults will be available in both Stormwind and Orgrimmar and can be accessed simply by speaking with your local Vaultkeeper.\"\n\"A variety of items can be placed into Void Storage \u2014 including soulbound items and Battle.net Account Bound items \u2014 making it the perfect location to store trophies from past conquests, as well as armor you may want to hold onto for Transmogrification. So, if you\u2019ve been looking for a good home for those old tier sets or your vanity holiday items, Void Storage is it! And it\u2019s as easy to use as dragging and dropping.\"\n\"In return for this unique service, the Ethereals will require a small fee for each item deposited into or withdrawn from their Void Storage apparatus. Multiple items can be added and removed at once, and the cost of each transaction will be displayed at the bottom of the interface, updating dynamically as you select additional items to deposit or withdraw. Once an item is placed into Void Storage, it can remain there indefinitely for no additional cost.\"\n\"It\u2019s important to note that the goal of Void Storage isn\u2019t to be a second bank, but rather a place where players can safely store items they wish to keep for the life of the game, either for sentimental or aesthetic reasons. Since this particular storage option isn\u2019t really intended for belongings that you\u2019d use a regular basis (like your current set of raiding gear, for example), any item placed in Void Storage will be stripped of all its enhancements, including enchants, gems, sockets, and reforged stats. This will help us reduce the impact such storage can have on the game servers, and ultimately allows us to provide a lot of long-term storage space with minimal impact on everyone's play experience.\""}

Their origins lie with a group of &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; following &lt;a href=\"Magister%20Umbric\"&gt;Magister Umbric&lt;/a&gt; who were exiled from &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt; because of their research into the Void. They were transformed by &lt;a href=\"void%20ethereal\"&gt;void ethereal&lt;/a&gt;s but rescued by &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, who had gained mastery of the Void herself on &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt; and taught them how to control their dark powers. Permanently transformed by the process, they pledged their loyalty to the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and to her as their new leader.\nThe void elves seek to utilize their great but dangerous powers for the sake of defending &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; as weapons of the Alliance, and to prove those who doubt or judge their abilities wrong, all the while resisting the Void's call to madness. They do not stand with the Alliance out of convenience, nor as a mere gesture of thanks to Alleria, but because they believe in its values. In fact, &lt;a href=\"Magister%20Umbric\"&gt;Magister Umbric&lt;/a&gt; and his followers never felt loyalty to the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, but only to the &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;kingdom of Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; and its people. Since their ordeal taught them the importance of great powers being in the right hands, they do not trust the Horde to possess their knowledge and abilities, and now hope to bring Silvermoon back into the Alliance.\nThey are based in the &lt;a href=\"Telogrus%20Rift\"&gt;Telogrus Rift&lt;/a&gt;, the fragmented remains of an ancient Void-infested &lt;a href=\"Planet\"&gt;world&lt;/a&gt;, where they learn to control their powers and to protect themselves from the madness of the Void. Their racial mounts, the &lt;a href=\"Starcursed%20Voidstrider\"&gt;shadow-infused striders&lt;/a&gt;, embody their commitment to harness the power of the Void in the name of the Alliance.\nDescription.\nThe void elves are tied to the experiences of two &lt;a href=\"Thalassian\"&gt;Thalassian&lt;/a&gt; elves who came into contact with the Void, and whose convergence, kinship, and shared ideals would lead to the birth of the ren'dorei.\nMany have sought to harness the corruptive magic of the Void. Most who tried have fallen into madness. Determined to use this power for the good of Azeroth, &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; is the first mortal to succeed at defying the shadow's whispers. Coming to the aid of a group of her kin who nearly gave in to the darkness, Alleria has vowed to train these void elves to control the shadows within them and pledge their newfound powers to the Alliance. Void elves constantly hear voices from the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; that seek to corrupt them, something they have learned to fight against and keep control over. They are determined to master their newfound powers and resist the whispers eager to lure them into madness. This assault is relentless and the discipline needed to resist them is extraordinary, as the voices say many things, from lies, to things that are true from a certain point of view, things that sound true, and things that one would wish were true.\nHistory.\nA Thousand Years of War.\nWhile sojourning with the &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Army of the Light&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; was attacked and infected with the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; on a &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; prison world that had been deeply saturated by its energies. As she grew fascinated by the void, she eventually learned of a mysterious &lt;a href=\"ethereal\"&gt;ethereal&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Locus-Walker\"&gt;Locus-Walker&lt;/a&gt;, a peerless master of void energies and a ruthless enemy of the Legion. When she desired to meet him in order to learn and wield the void's power against the Legion, the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; prime &lt;a href=\"Xe%27ra\"&gt;Xe'ra&lt;/a&gt; strictly forbade her to do so. Alleria acquiesced to Xe'ra's wishes but did not abandon her belief that the void, while built on chaos, could be a force utilized for good. Eventually, Alleria used the void in a confrontation with &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s, then escaped through a shadowy rift after promising &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; that she would never be his enemy.\nOn the world of &lt;a href=\"Niskara\"&gt;Niskara&lt;/a&gt;, Alleria was taken prisoner alongside Locus-Walker. She later used her newly acquired powers to fight off their demonic assailants, and together they escaped to a plane of pure shadow, the Void itself. Here, Locus Walker taught Alleria much of the void, its workings, and its place in the universe. He emphasized the importance of control and \"sanity\" when wielding the void's power, and spoke at length of the duality of Light and Shadow. He explained how the shadow sees the Light as nothing but horrors, just as the Light sees the shadow, and how neither is true nor wrong. How the Light seeks one path and shuns all others as lies, while the Void seeks every possible path and sees them all as truth. However, Alleria left her training incomplete after learning that Turalyon was in grave danger, and departed the shadowy realm after a brief battle with her teacher, who told Alleria that they would meet again. Reuniting with Turalyon, Alleria used her newfound control of the void to drive off his attackers and save his life, but even his plea for mercy could not stay Xe'ra's judgment: for refusing to renounce the void, Alleria would be imprisoned by the Army of the Light.\nLegion.\nWhen the \"&lt;a href=\"Xenedar\"&gt;Xenedar&lt;/a&gt;\" was shot down, Alleria was set free. During the battles across &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;, Alleria became aware of the existence of the darkened &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"L%27ura\"&gt;L'ura&lt;/a&gt;, whose fallen state was attracting the attention of &lt;a href=\"Void%20ethereal\"&gt;void-corrupted ethereal&lt;/a&gt;s. Later Alleria met her teacher once again, who had come to see what the &lt;a href=\"Shadowguard\"&gt;Shadowguard&lt;/a&gt; were doing at the &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20the%20Triumvirate\"&gt;Seat of the Triumvirate&lt;/a&gt;. So long as Alleria remained in control of herself and her mind, the shadow would be her ally, and thus Locus Walker offered his apprentice the heart of the slain &lt;a href=\"void%20revenant\"&gt;void revenant&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Nhal%27athoth\"&gt;Nhal'athoth&lt;/a&gt; to consume. Within the Seat of the Triumvirate, Alleria confronted L'ura herself. Locus Walker encouraged Alleria to use the power of the void rifts the darkened naaru was opening, and Alleria absorbed L'ura's essence completely, turning her to a void state. Although the process changed her, giving her access to a void form, Alleria maintained that she was still in control, the same person she had always been, but now something more. Alleria's transformation and link to the void would soon be known to her people back on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; as she became the first void elf.\nExile from Silvermoon.\nOn &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, a blood elf &lt;a href=\"Magisters\"&gt;magister&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Umbric\"&gt;Umbric&lt;/a&gt; was determined that the sin'dorei would never fall prey to their enemies again. Convinced that the void was essential to the defense of &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;, Umbric and his followers delved into it against the wishes of &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Rommath\"&gt;Grand Magister Rommath&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, Rommath had them banished, reasoning that any who treat with the void pose a danger to the Sunwell, and Umbric led his followers south to the &lt;a href=\"Ghostlands\"&gt;Ghostlands&lt;/a&gt; to pursue their research. He made a breakthrough after discovering notes left by &lt;a href=\"Dar%27Khan%20Drathir\"&gt;Dar'Khan Drathir&lt;/a&gt;, one of Quel'Thalas' most vile traitors, who had sought the power of the void long before selling his people to &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;. While Drathir had not succeeded in his endeavor, eventually abandoning his research after a failed attempt to reach a void-infused rift world supposedly containing an item of great power, Umbric \u2014 who only now conceded that Rommath may have been right to oppose this course of study \u2014 was able to build upon Drathir's findings and open the way to the rift.\nWith his followers, Umbric traveled to the void world now known as &lt;a href=\"Telogrus%20Rift\"&gt;Telogrus Rift&lt;/a&gt;, which had been destroyed long ago by a being of great power (possibly &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; himself). But the fragmented world endured, heavily bathed in the void's energies. Umbric, at last, had found what he was looking for: an ancient and powerful cube that could grant its masters control over shadows.\nReturning to Azeroth, Alleria was called upon by King &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; to seek out new allies for the Alliance. Determined to see Silvermoon stand again on the Alliance's side, and certain that her people would shrug off the Horde if given the choice, Alleria traveled to Silvermoon City to meet with &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Regent-Lord Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;. She presented Theron with an offer from Anduin, but Lor'themar was unreceptive to it. Seeing her offer had been \"anticipated and spurned,\" accepted his answer and prepared to depart, but made a final request \u2014 that she be permitted to visit the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt; again; as it had been a thousand years, from her perspective, since she had seen it last. &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Rommath\"&gt;Grand Magister Rommath&lt;/a&gt; immediately objected, suspicious of Alleria's intentions, but Lor'themar overruled him, stating that no matter what she'd become, Alleria was still a daughter of Quel'Thalas and he would not deny her a pilgrimage to their people's most sacred site.\nAlleria accompanied the blood elf leaders, as well as the concurrently visiting &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt; leaders, and discovered that its energies had been changed: the Sunwell was no longer a source of pure arcane energy, but also holy &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;. However, when she stepped closer to its waters, the plateau erupted into void corruption by Alleria's presence. An &lt;a href=\"Nether-Prince%20Durzaan\"&gt;unseen presence&lt;/a&gt; loomed behind the curtain, apparently using the void within Alleria as a \"vessel\" to corrupt the Sunwell, and unleashed a void horror upon it. Combining her powers with Rommath and &lt;a href=\"Thalyssra\"&gt;Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt;, Alleria succeeded in closing the void rift before disaster could strike, but from the blood elves' perspective it had already happened. Rommath ordered Alleria arrested as a saboteur, but Lor'themar interceded, instead banishing Alleria back to Stormwind on the grounds that her very presence poses a danger to Quel'Thalas.\nAlleria returned to Stormwind to report the poor outcome of her negotiations, but an earlier comment made by Rommath, suggesting that like Alleria, other blood elves had been exiled for dabbling in the void, gave her another quest to pursue.\nBirth of the ren'dorei.\nAlleria later ventured to the &lt;a href=\"Ghostlands\"&gt;Ghostlands&lt;/a&gt;, and sought out the traces that Umbric and his group had left behind. With each piece Alleria put together, she gained a better understanding and empathy for these elves, exiled and shunned for delving into the void, as she had been. Further, Alleria worried about where this research into such a strange and unknowable object might take them. Alleria followed the trail to &lt;a href=\"Dawnstar%20Spire\"&gt;Dawnstar Spire&lt;/a&gt;, and opened her own portal to Telogrus, where she finally met Umbric.\nShe had arrived just in time for the ritual to unlock the cube. Umbric's followers had dispersed around Telogrus and were intent on uncovering its secrets. Umbric himself was honored to make Alleria's acquaintance, and had learned much of her ordeal on Argus and the shadows she'd consumed. But while Silvermoon's leaders looked upon this occurrence with suspicion and mistrust, seeing only a potential threat to Quel'Thalas, Umbric was of a mind with Alleria, and firmly believed that the void could be controlled and made a force for good. Alleria accompanied Umbric to the site of the cube and cautioned him to be wary as he began the ritual to unlock its power.\nAt that moment, the cube opened with an explosion, allowing &lt;a href=\"Nether-Prince%20Durzaan\"&gt;Nether-Prince Durzaan&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 the corrupt ethereal who had stalked Alleria and made an attempt to claim the Sunwell \u2014 to surge into Telogrus. Durzaan immediately began a spell to capture and corrupt Umbric and his followers, binding them in an attempt to transform the elves into creatures of the void. Displaying her fortitude, neither Durzaan's power nor his offers to share it were enough to sway Alleria's resolve, as she made clear to Umbric that the whispers are not to be trusted. Alleria succeeded in killing Durzaan, and while their minds and souls were still their own, the sin'dorei had been transformed by the ritual: now, having consumed the void as Alleria had, they had achieved new powers as well as a dangerous susceptibility to its whispers. Alleria immediately offered her aid, wanting to help her transformed kin understand and control their new forms and powers; and Umbric, apologizing for his arrogance, happily accepted. Since Umbric felt that Silvermoon had turned its back on him and his people long ago, Umbric and the void elves swore their allegiance to Alleria and as allies of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlleria and Umbric became the first to embrace a new identity: the void elves, ren'dorei in their &lt;a href=\"Thalassian\"&gt;native tongue&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 children of the void.\nRejoining the Alliance.\nUnder Alleria's guidance, as well as the tutelage and instruction of her own teacher, &lt;a href=\"Locus-Walker\"&gt;Locus-Walker&lt;/a&gt;, the void elves made strides in mastering their nature and claimed Telogrus as their base of operations. Although they are not recruiting necessarily, they are open to those who share similar interests and their research has even attracted other Thalassian elves to Telogrus, such as blood elf &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20Scholar\"&gt;Silvermoon scholars&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"High%20Elf%20Wayfarer\"&gt;high elf wayfarers&lt;/a&gt; curious to learn more about the Void from their transformed kin. They are trying to find out if they can reproduce the original process that transformed the void elves.\nAspiring void elf &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s were later sent to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; from Telogrus, where the ren'dorei have established a presence in the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Embassy\"&gt;Stormwind Embassy&lt;/a&gt; area, with void elves serving as innkeepers and profession trainers. Upon their arrival, &lt;a href=\"Ambassador%20Moorgard\"&gt;Ambassador Moorgard&lt;/a&gt; welcomed them, but then warned that it was better for them to keep control their shadow powers, as not everyone in Stormwind was as enlightened as him. The void elf emissary &lt;a href=\"Keira%20Onyxraven\"&gt;Keira Onyxraven&lt;/a&gt; later testified that she did not receive a very warm welcome too, but that most folk were polite enough. The void elf adventurers later met &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;High King Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, who assured them that while the path they walk may be trying, they will never face the darkness alone, for the Alliance stood with them.\nConsequently, &lt;a href=\"Riftwarden%20Acolyte\"&gt;Riftwarden Acolyte&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Ghostblade%20Scout\"&gt;Ghostblade Scout&lt;/a&gt;s could be seen throughout the capital, with one seen walking with a &lt;a href=\"High%20Elf%20Sorceress\"&gt;High Elf Sorceress&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Mage%20Quarter\"&gt;Mage Quarter&lt;/a&gt;. In the &lt;a href=\"Wizard%27s%20Sanctum\"&gt;Wizard's Sanctum&lt;/a&gt;, some became &lt;a href=\"Apprentice%20Mage\"&gt;Apprentice Mage&lt;/a&gt;s trained by the high elf &lt;a href=\"Elsharin\"&gt;Elsharin&lt;/a&gt;. However, they were not welcomed at the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt;, where the &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Holy%20Light\"&gt;Church of the Holy Light&lt;/a&gt; invited them to leave as their presence was not considered appropriate.\nAfter they achieved mastery over the forces that constantly seek to control them, becoming formidable weapons of the Alliance, Alleria Windrunner rewarded experienced void elf adventurers with the &lt;a href=\"Heritage%20of%20the%20Ren%27dorei\"&gt;ren'dorei-themed heritage armors&lt;/a&gt; to honor their considerable accomplishments. As many doubted that the ren'dorei could harness the power of the void without falling prey to its influence, she thanked the heroes who have proven them wrong.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Battle for Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, Alleria and her followers intervened at a crucial moment, saving the lives of &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;High King Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and his allies after opening a Void portal through which &lt;a href=\"Gelbin%20Mekkatorque\"&gt;Gelbin Mekkatorque&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Flametron%205000\"&gt;Spider Tank&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Ren%27dorei%20Ranger\"&gt;Ren'dorei Ranger&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Mage\"&gt;Alliance Mage&lt;/a&gt;s appeared as reinforcements for Anduin's weakened forces, helping to momentarily turn the tide of battle in the Alliance's favor. &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;, upon noticing their arrival, asserted that they were \"traitors\" who had to be dealt with.\nAt some point, &lt;a href=\"Instructor%20Duskwalker\"&gt;Instructor Duskwalker&lt;/a&gt; was sent to scout the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Theramore\"&gt;Ruins of Theramore&lt;/a&gt; to assess its viability as a base, until he was interrupted by &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; champions.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"7th%20Legion\"&gt;7th Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s invasion of &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;, a regiment of void elves led by &lt;a href=\"Magister%20Umbric\"&gt;Magister Umbric&lt;/a&gt; - seeing the opportunity to prove their capabilities and their loyalty to the Alliance - would attack the &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Cartel\"&gt;Bilgewater Cartel&lt;/a&gt;'s mining operations in Zandalar in an attempt to find and capture &lt;a href=\"Jastor%20Gallywix\"&gt;Jastor Gallywix&lt;/a&gt;, cooperated with the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt;, sending their rogues, priests, and hunters to assist them at &lt;a href=\"Xibala\"&gt;Xibala&lt;/a&gt;. They used their newfound powers to ambush the Cartel's &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s by sending void elven troops through the rift, as well as throwing the cartel's frackers into the endless &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlthough their mission ended in failure, the void elves managed to uncover Gallywix's decoy and send the trade prince on the run, impressing &lt;a href=\"Halford%20Wyrmbane\"&gt;Halford Wyrmbane&lt;/a&gt;, the 7th Legion's Commander.\nTides of Vengeance.\nAs members of the , several participated in the &lt;a href=\"Faction%20Assault%20on%20Vol%27dun\"&gt;Faction Assault on Vol'dun&lt;/a&gt;, only to be targeted and slain by Horde adventurers sent by &lt;a href=\"Rokhan\"&gt;Rokhan&lt;/a&gt;. The void elves also sent some of their magi alongside those of the other Alliance races to assist in the defense of &lt;a href=\"Stormsong%20Valley\"&gt;Stormsong Valley&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tiragarde%20Sound\"&gt;Tiragarde Sound&lt;/a&gt;, in one instance being part of a group of magi helping to invoke &lt;a href=\"Tempestion\"&gt;Tempestion&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Basin\"&gt;Arathi Basin&lt;/a&gt;, the void elves &lt;a href=\"Faedra%20the%20Sniper\"&gt;Faedra the Sniper&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Falania%20Nightsoul\"&gt;Falania Nightsoul&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mastus%20Snowspray\"&gt;Mastus Snowspray&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Savia%20%22Anguish%22%20Anguossa\"&gt;Savia \"Anguish\" Anguossa&lt;/a&gt; fought against Horde soldiers during the .\nThe void elves played a major supporting role in the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20War%20Campaign\"&gt;Alliance War Campaign&lt;/a&gt; culminating in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Dazar%27alor%20%28battle%29\"&gt;Battle of Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt;, with Magister Umbric personally working with &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; to open a portal into the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Opulence\"&gt;Halls of Opulence&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt;, where Alliance agents successfully reclaimed the &lt;a href=\"Abyssal%20Scepter\"&gt;Abyssal Scepter&lt;/a&gt;. Umbric and his &lt;a href=\"Void%20Shaper\"&gt;Void Shaper&lt;/a&gt;s also used their powers to raise &lt;a href=\"Great%20Xonac\"&gt;Great Xonac&lt;/a&gt; into undeath at &lt;a href=\"Seekers%27%20Expedition\"&gt;Seekers' Expedition&lt;/a&gt; in Zuldazar, sending him rampaging against Horde forces in the Zandalari capital. &lt;a href=\"Gonk\"&gt;Gonk&lt;/a&gt; in turn had Horde agents assassinate &lt;a href=\"7th%20Legion%20Voidshaper\"&gt;the void elves raising the creatures&lt;/a&gt;, calling them \"elven puppets of the Void\". The void elves sent &lt;a href=\"Void%20Elf%20Mage\"&gt;an entire battalion of trained mages&lt;/a&gt; to assist in the Alliance diversion and decoy mission alongside the other members of the &lt;a href=\"7th%20Legion\"&gt;7th Legion&lt;/a&gt;, where most of the ren'dorei's forces were wiped out by Horde adventurers, but in turn helping contribute to the Alliance victory.\nAfter the death of &lt;a href=\"King%20Rastakhan\"&gt;King Rastakhan&lt;/a&gt;, some of the void elf &lt;a href=\"7th%20Legion%20Guardsman%20%28Nazjatar%29\"&gt;guardsmen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"7th%20Legion%20Arcanist%20%28Eternal%20Palace%29\"&gt;arcanists&lt;/a&gt; of the 7th Legion joined the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20navy\"&gt;Alliance navy&lt;/a&gt; in their pursuit of the remaining Horde ships, and were subsequently found in both &lt;a href=\"Mezzamere\"&gt;Mezzamere&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Palace\"&gt;Eternal Palace&lt;/a&gt;. Several &lt;a href=\"Hammer%20Outcast\"&gt;void elf priests&lt;/a&gt; were targeted and slain by Horde agents at the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Spray\"&gt;Western Spray&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Mechagon%20Island\"&gt;Mechagon Island&lt;/a&gt;.\nVisions of N'Zoth.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Empire%20Campaign\"&gt;Black Empire Campaign&lt;/a&gt;, some void elves were corrupted by the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt; and became &lt;a href=\"Sleepless%20Voidseeker\"&gt;Sleepless Voidseeker&lt;/a&gt;s under his control. Some were sent with &lt;a href=\"X%27korr%20the%20Compelling\"&gt;X'korr the Compelling&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Karazhan%20Catacombs\"&gt;Karazhan Catacombs&lt;/a&gt;, where they pursued the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragon\"&gt;black dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt;, now a target of the Black Empire for his researches into a way to defeat the Old Gods.\nSome corrupted void elves including &lt;a href=\"Magister%20Umbric%20%28Vision%20of%20Stormwind%29\"&gt;Magister Umbric&lt;/a&gt; and several &lt;a href=\"Fallen%20Riftwalker\"&gt;Fallen Riftwalker&lt;/a&gt;s were also seen in the &lt;a href=\"Vision%20of%20Stormwind\"&gt;Vision of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; supporting &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner%20%28Vision%20of%20Stormwind%29\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, some void elves who perished during the conflict were later raised as &lt;a href=\"death%20knights\"&gt;death knights&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; and sent to Stormwind to fight for the Alliance once again.\nShadows Rising.\nDuring the mission to hunt down and capture &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; were assisted by &lt;a href=\"Celosel%20Nightgiver\"&gt;Celosel Nightgiver&lt;/a&gt; who reported on the position of &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"refugee\"&gt;refugee&lt;/a&gt;s, who could have hidden the &lt;a href=\"dark%20ranger\"&gt;dark ranger&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Visrynn\"&gt;Visrynn&lt;/a&gt; among them. A handful of void elves were later present at &lt;a href=\"Faldir%27s%20Cove\"&gt;Faldir's Cove&lt;/a&gt;, solemnly watching over a smuggler's family while he was interrogated by Alleria and Turalyon about the dark ranger.\nDragonflight.\nWith the return of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rugged%20Artisan\"&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; void elves including &lt;a href=\"Nethandril%20Duskthorn\"&gt;Nethandril Duskthorn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Spelunker%20Lockeye\"&gt;Spelunker Lockeye&lt;/a&gt; joined the &lt;a href=\"Dragonscale%20Expedition\"&gt;Dragonscale Expedition&lt;/a&gt;, working with their former &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;kin&lt;/a&gt; once again.\n&lt;a href=\"Temporal%20Defender\"&gt;So&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"Timewalker%20Warden\"&gt;me&lt;/a&gt; void elves, notably &lt;a href=\"Ramaniel\"&gt;Ramaniel&lt;/a&gt;, also joined the ranks of the &lt;a href=\"Timewalkers\"&gt;Timewalkers&lt;/a&gt; in order to help the &lt;a href=\"bronze%20dragonflight\"&gt;bronze dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; in their charge of protecting the &lt;a href=\"Alternate%20timeline\"&gt;timeways&lt;/a&gt;.\nAppearance and characteristics.\nVoid elves have extremely pale skin, blue eyes, and hair with varying shades of purple and blue - sometimes with tentacle-shaped dreadlocks. On occasion, they can fully embrace the void in combat, shrouding their entire bodies in purple shadow magic. Since their transformation, their blood became purple while their voice now rings with a dark echo. However, even if they have been changed by the shadows, their hearts and minds remained their own. Once transformed, it took them time to get used to their new forms, &lt;a href=\"Aevedos\"&gt;Aevedos&lt;/a&gt; notably testified that his usual dexterity felt impeded for a while.\nSince the shadow energies transformed them and opened their minds to the madness of the Void, the void elves constantly hear whispers that seek to corrupt them, something they have learned to fight against and keep control over. This assault is relentless and the discipline needed to resist them is extraordinary, as the Void seeks to strip away the void elves of their flesh and their mortality, so that they may become slaves to the shadow's all-consuming hunger. According to &lt;a href=\"Instructor%20Duskwalker\"&gt;Instructor Duskwalker&lt;/a&gt;, the void elves must remain in control of their thoughts as the Void cannot sway that which is immutable, as well as their emotions, which are a weakness that the whispers will use against them. Furthermore, so long as the void elves pulse with Void energy, they also become a beacon for other creatures of the void. If they cannot corrupt the void elves, they will use them to corrupt other powerful sources, such as the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs the Light and the Shadow cannot exist together, Alleria cannot have physical contact with &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; (who have been &lt;a href=\"Lightforged%20draenei\"&gt;reforged&lt;/a&gt; in the light of &lt;a href=\"Xe%27ra\"&gt;Xe'ra&lt;/a&gt;) when she uses her powers or void form, for the slightest touch causes them both a pain like that of a burn. However, contact is possible when she is not using her powers. It is unknown, but most likely, if the void elves are also subject to this phenomenon since their bodies have been corrupted and mutated by the Void. &lt;a href=\"Brother%20Joshua\"&gt;Brother Joshua&lt;/a&gt; was able to sense the shadows within them, though it was diminished in the presence of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Telogrus%20Rift\"&gt;Telogrus Rift&lt;/a&gt;, the void elves have been training to master their abilities, as without &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;'s guidance they would have fallen into madness. Even after she helped them quiet their minds and dampen the whispers, it remains a constant struggle. Once they have learned basic control, they can only attain mastery through practical application, notably by learning how to banish void creatures to their plane. Among the powers they gained after their transformation, they learned how to &lt;a href=\"Spatial%20Rift\"&gt;open rifts in space and time&lt;/a&gt; to teleport on short distances, and to conjure void &lt;a href=\"Teleportation\"&gt;portals&lt;/a&gt; to teleport on long distances. They can also &lt;a href=\"Entropic%20Embrace\"&gt;empower themselves&lt;/a&gt; with the power of the Void to improve their skills, are &lt;a href=\"Chill%20of%20Night\"&gt;more resistant&lt;/a&gt; to shadow magic, and cannot be slowed down during their incantations thanks to their tremendous &lt;a href=\"Preternatural%20Calm\"&gt;self-control&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs the Void can see all alternatives, it may show them a winding road of infinite possibilities. Consequently, some void elves therefore refer to visions and prophecies they have seen or heard through the whispers. However, the voices say many things, from lies, to things that are true from a certain point of view, things that sound true, and things that one would wish were true."}

{"id": "464841", "revid": "39299307", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=464841", "title": "Void lord", "text": "The void lords (sometimes capitalized as Void Lords) are monstrous entities composed of pure shadow energy who rule over the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;, outside the borders of reality. Merciless and cruel beyond imagination, they seek only to twist reality into a realm of eternal torment, and ultimately to devour all matter and energy and the universe itself. However, only the most powerful of the void lords can actually manifest in the physical universe, weakened, and only for limited amounts of time, for their energies quickly seep into nothingness. They must therefore consume untold amounts of matter and energy to maintain their presence.\nBackground.\nFrom the moment the physical universe was born, the void lords had been watching the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;. Envious of the titans' power, the void lords attempted to corrupt one of them, but the titans remained impervious to their attempts. Instead, the void lords pooled their power and hurled dark, parasitic horrors \u2014 later known as the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 out into the universe to find and exert their influence over a titan in its most vulnerable state: as a slumbering &lt;a href=\"world-soul\"&gt;world-soul&lt;/a&gt;. The void lords did not know which planets contained titan &lt;a href=\"world-soul\"&gt;world-soul&lt;/a&gt;s, and so simply hoped that at least some of their creations would smash into a planet that contained a nascent titan.\nWhile the Pantheon was aware of the Void's existence, they had no knowledge of the void lords or their Old God servants. Instead, they were preoccupied with another threat: &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s, chaotic spawn of the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;. As the Pantheon's greatest warrior, &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, hunted the vile creatures wherever he could find them, he soon learned that some demons had learned to wield Void energies.\nOne day, he further discovered a world-soul that had been almost completely corrupted by the Old Gods. Its surface was covered in Void energies, and the normally tranquil dreams of the nascent titan had been twisted into horrific nightmares. Sargeras ruthlessly interrogated the black world's &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt; inhabitants, who had come to dwell amongst the Old Gods, and through them he learned of the void lords and their intentions. Enraged and anguished, Sargeras smote the demons and cleaved the corrupted world in two, instantly killing the world-soul within. It was this event that led Sargeras to abandon his brethren in the Pantheon, form the demonic &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; and vow to purge the cosmos of all life \u2014 in his mind, a lifeless universe was better than one absolutely ripped apart by the Void, for he argued that if life had once taken root in the Great Dark on its own, perhaps it would do so again.\n&lt;a href=\"Dimensius%20the%20All-Devouring\"&gt;Dimensius the All-Devouring&lt;/a&gt; was one such void lord who manifested in the physical universe. Aligning with what \"Chronicle\" said about how weaker void lords are when manifesting, he was described as a fragment, shadow, and echo of a true void lord's power, and &lt;a href=\"Xal%27atath\"&gt;Xal'atath&lt;/a&gt; said to be eagerly awaiting the day one would be able to \"truly pass into this realm\".\nNot all void lords necessarily have the same motives. They may have their own personalities and own goals.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;, the whispers of &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; apparently come from the \"lords of the Void\" themselves, and even after the defeat of all four of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s, they have continued to constantly affect Alleria."}

{"id": "69473", "revid": "41339159", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=69473", "title": "Holy strider", "text": "The nomadic tauren gave the world the first holy strider. Constantly on the move, the tauren had to have reliable &lt;a href=\"scout\"&gt;scout&lt;/a&gt;s able to go far ahead and return swiftly. If they ran into trouble, they had to take care of themselves, either talking their way out of things, fighting their way out, or simply running and hiding. The holy strider tapped into the world's readily available energy and began harnessing that &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; to aid their travels.\nNow, although the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; have their own well-fortified homeland and capital, the holy striders still find themselves in high demand as messengers, diplomats, spies and explorers. Lanky and tall, nearly all holy striders carry minimal equipment, relying on nature, their own resourcefulness, and the kindness of strangers to aid them.\nAlong with &lt;a href=\"shamanistic\"&gt;shamanistic&lt;/a&gt; traditions, the tauren brought the secrets of the holy strider to the Horde, and its followers have spread. Once dominated by the tauren, the holy striders are now represented by &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s and, to a lesser extent, &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s and a handful of &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;.\nNow that they have been trained in diplomatic endeavors, the holy strider has become a vital resource to any court in the Horde. It is quite useful to get a message - as well as a persuasive messenger - to its destination quickly. If the message is not well received, the holy strider has ways to remove himself from the situation quickly. Sometimes called spies, the holy striders claim that they are only gathering information for their employers.\nHoly striders are well-respected among the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Although they are not spellcasters, their mastery of the environment is said to be inspired by nothing less than the &lt;a href=\"divine\"&gt;divine&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; himself employs four: two orcs, one troll, and one tauren. Rumor has it that he is looking for a neutral holy strider to make Horde negotiations with other races go more smoothly, but there are no holy striders outside the Horde at present. &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; employs only tauren, out of respect for the long heritage of the holy strider. Although his demeanor does not suggest a covert mind, Cairne does not disclose how many holy striders he employs, only that they are all tauren.\nThe orcs have followed the tauren lead and record the farthest each holy strider has traveled. The Horde has created its own maps of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; based on its holy striders' reports, and it rewards them well. It is not difficult for a holy strider to receive work, whether it be from a noble lord or a &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; merchant. She has only to bear a letter confirming her longest run, and most employers will be satisfied.\nHoly striders commonly work alone, as few can keep up with them, but they serve as exemplary party leaders with their natural charm and diplomatic skills. Their genial manners allow them to talk a party out of tense situations, and they are certainly useful for checking out a dangerous area quickly.\nThere is no centralized training center on Kalimdor for holy striders, but most major cities have apprenticeship programs. Often a holy strider who has been injured or is past her prime will train some new recruits. Apprentices approach the mentors with great honor and reverence, as they hope to someday be as great as those who have seen the different corners of the world.\nThe kind of person who takes up the mantle of the holy strider has a never-ceasing curiosity - someone who will never be satisfied with stopping before the next hill. She must always see what comes next. Her eclectic skills turn her into a well-rounded character.\nThe holy strider can cover vast distances by meditating while running. Her meditation moves her mind into the ground beneath her feet, where she coaxes it to fold upon itself while she is running. This effect only works for the holy strider herself; no party members can benefit from these abilities. The meditation cannot be used during combat. After settling into a comfortable, meditative run (1-1/2 times her walk speed), the holy strider can begin manipulating the terrain under her. This causes her to run at twice her maximum run speed while still managing to keep the easy run. She can keep this up for a number of hours before she becomes fatigued and must stop the creasing run. To the observer, she seems to move in unnaturally long strides or jumps. The holy strider cannot attack and maintain the run. While creasing the mountain, the holy strider can run at her normal run speed up or down any grade of 90 degrees or less as if it were 45 degrees. If she fails, her meditation ends and she must make a Climb check to find something to grab onto, else she falls. Once she has mastered solid land, the holy strider can reach beneath the waters of the seas and crease them, creating a solid foothold. After achieving the necessary meditative state, she run across water, though she moves only at her normal run speed. If she stops her meditation, she falls into the body of water. If she takes damage while creasing the sea, she must make a Concentration check or her meditation ends and she falls into the water.\nWhen the holy strider wishes to enter a room with flair, she can easily get the attention of anyone she likes with the force of her personal charm. She is a powerful negotiator and no one can rival her persuasive skills. The holy strider's job is part scout, part diplomat, part spy. Her job is to reach her destination as quickly as possible and then meet with \u2014 or spy on \u2014 her target. She is highly trained, but sometimes things don't go as well as hoped. In these cases, the holy strider must rely on her skills to get out of the situation as quickly, efficiently and safely as possible. A holy strider can use shadow meld as a spell-like ability."}

When the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; swept through the city during the &lt;a href=\"Scourging%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Scourging of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; manufactured holy water to use against the invaders and distributed it with other vital supplies throughout the city. However, Stratholme's citizens turned into Scourge themselves before the supplies could be used. The water remains in supply crates throughout the city.\nBefore the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Leonid%20Barthalomew%20the%20Revered\"&gt;Leonid Barthalomew&lt;/a&gt; asked &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to recover some of the water for the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt;. Alliance &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt; adventurers collected vials of Stratholme holy water for the smith &lt;a href=\"Grimand%20Elmore\"&gt;Grimand Elmore&lt;/a&gt; so that he could spiritually imbue the &lt;a href=\"Arcanite%20Barding\"&gt;arcanite barding&lt;/a&gt; for their &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Charger\"&gt;charger&lt;/a&gt; mount. After the Cataclysm, &lt;a href=\"Packmaster%20Stonebruiser\"&gt;Packmaster Stonebruiser&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; asked adventurers to fetch him a vial of the water so the Crusade could have it replicated in mass quantities. Stonebruiser believed that it would be devastating in large volumes. During the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, Silver Hand paladins led by &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Grayson%20Shadowbreaker\"&gt;Lord Grayson Shadowbreaker&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Highlord&lt;/a&gt; attacked Stratholme to secure the city's remaining caches of holy water. They applied the water to a set of barding which they then used to transform the &lt;a href=\"skeletal%20horse\"&gt;skeletal horse&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Shadowmane\"&gt;Shadowmane&lt;/a&gt; into a &lt;a href=\"Highlord%27s%20Golden%20Charger\"&gt;golden charger&lt;/a&gt; for the Highlord."}

Hong put his name on his brews.\nHong's Bravery Brew.\nHong's Bravery Brew is a creamy stout that is quaffed by pandaren before battles, giving the soldiers a drink together to establish camaraderie and kinship. Drinking this with someone forges a brother-like bond, says pandaren legend. While not sure of that, those lucky enough to sample this thick, bittersweet drink know the worth of it. This drink is a favorite specifically of &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; on the battle lines.\nAfter developing a brew for soldiers to drink before battle, Hong decided they would need something for the post-battle thirst. Taking into account the physical and emotional toll battle can take, he developed &lt;a href=\"Pandaren%20brew%23Hong%27s%20Fighting%20Lager\"&gt;Hong's Fighting Lager&lt;/a&gt;, a light wheat lager containing hints of honey and citrus. Combat is a state of grace amongst the &lt;a href=\"shodo-pan\"&gt;shodo-pan&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Pandaren%20Empire\"&gt;Pandaren Empire&lt;/a&gt;, and as much as it is an art form, it is thirsty work. Hong's fighting lager revives fatigued and frightened soldiers and warriors after fighting a long and difficult battle. It is also highly valued for its crisp wheat taste and subtle honey and citron-like accents."}

In the past, it had been the location for many great battles between the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and its enemies. The orcs stationed here, including peons tasked with repairing the buildings, were very much conscious of the outpost's illustrious, if short, history, though recently they had been beset by attacks mounted by the &lt;a href=\"Kolkar\"&gt;Kolkar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nLosing Honor's Stand.\nAllegedly prior to the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, in a clever ruse, the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; forces streamed out of &lt;a href=\"Northwatch\"&gt;Northwatch&lt;/a&gt; and marched up the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Road\"&gt;Gold Road&lt;/a&gt;, besieging &lt;a href=\"Crossroads\"&gt;Crossroads&lt;/a&gt; as dusk fell. Then, in the heart of the night, they force-marched southward, leaving their campfires burning behind. The meager forces at Honor's Stand were caught unaware as the Alliance poured through the pass at dawn's first light. Many of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s bravest warriors fell before their blades.\nThe Horde regrouped east of the pass and prepared a counter-attack, but the next day, the skies reddened and the land was cleaved in two. The Alliance in their makeshift bunkers were surprised and disorganized as the Horde from the disaster, but rather than using the perfect opportunity to attack, &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Gar%27dul\"&gt;Warlord Gar'dul&lt;/a&gt; ordered that they pull back to the south to refortify.\nNot all the Horde soldiers left, however, and remain to do sneak attacks from the high ground and retreat before the Alliance know what hit them. The Horde considered Honor's Stand, and survivors were holding out at &lt;a href=\"Hunter%27s%20Hill\"&gt;Hunter's Hill&lt;/a&gt;.\nModern day.\nWith the Horde having backed off, the Alliance have quickly started fortifying the area with &lt;a href=\"Scout%20tower\"&gt;towers&lt;/a&gt; and walls to easily defend it from future assaults. A few orcs that surrendered after watching their commander get killed were taken prisoner and placed in the southern tower that had become a crude prison house with &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Peake\"&gt;Captain Peake&lt;/a&gt; watching over the prisoners as its warden.\nSoldiers of the Alliance and the Horde can be found to the west and east of the outpost fighting. Horde adventurers wishing to access the Southern Barrens from Stonetalon will usually take the &lt;a href=\"High%20Road\"&gt;High Road&lt;/a&gt; to avoid the carnage below.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, Honor's Stand was besieged by the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; champions. Although the Horde tried to break their hold on the outpost, the Alliance held strong. After the war, &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zekhan\"&gt;Zekhan&lt;/a&gt; observed the settlement, and they could see Alliance bringing in new supplies and materials to shore up their defenses. Since the armistice, the area has grown quiet, but the surviving Horde soldiers who served at Honor's Stand refuse to give up hope that one day they'll reclaim the outpost they fought and bled for."}

A refuge of human, elven, draenei, and dwarven explorers, Honor Hold is the first major town Alliance explorers will encounter while traversing &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. The town holds a flight path, inn, &lt;a href=\"keep\"&gt;keep&lt;/a&gt;, destroyed &lt;a href=\"barracks\"&gt;barracks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mage%20tower\"&gt;mage tower&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"stables\"&gt;stables&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"blacksmith%20%28building%29\"&gt;blacksmith&lt;/a&gt; and a variety of profession trainers and vendors. Vestiges of the &lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Lothar\"&gt;Sons of Lothar&lt;/a&gt;, veterans of the Alliance that first came into Draenor, have steadfastly held on to this Hellfire outpost. They are now joined by the armies from &lt;a href=\"Nethergarde%20Keep\"&gt;Nethergarde Keep&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe settlement was originally founded as the primary base of the &lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Lothar\"&gt;Sons of Lothar&lt;/a&gt; under General &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt;. It had taken months to lay the foundations for it and months more to finish the outer walls and some of the buildings. During that time, the expedition had to fight off repeated &lt;a href=\"Horde%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; attacks, though most had been little more than brief skirmishes or diversions, Honor Hold sometimes even being attacked just by &lt;a href=\"peon\"&gt;peon&lt;/a&gt;s. The Sons of Lothar received erratic shipments of supplies and manpower from their homeworld, as the &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;ian side of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; switched sides several times during the late stages of the &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Invasion of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Alliance forces eventually staged a successful attack on &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Citadel\"&gt;Hellfire Citadel&lt;/a&gt;. After the Dark Portal was destroyed, the Alliance forces returned to Honor Hold to begin their new life in Draenor - now Outland, and launched search missions for their missing allies.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; launched their armies into &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, their soldiers were shocked to discover Honor Hold and its inhabitants, where &lt;a href=\"Danath%20Trollbane\"&gt;Danath Trollbane&lt;/a&gt; welcomed them with open arms. From the fortress, the Alliance continued their offensives against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, breaking the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s' strength until they pushed them to the outskirts of &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocations and NPCs.\nThe Honor Hold Inn features a mailbox outside; there are a variety of vendors, profession trainers, and various NPCs including:\nBelow Honor Hold (to the west, immediately below the town) are the Honor Hold Guard Tower and Mine. \nReputation.\nHonor Hold reputation is gained through various means in Hellfire Peninsula. Mobs and bosses in &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Citadel\"&gt;Hellfire Citadel&lt;/a&gt; in addition to quests in town reward Honor Hold reputation. As of March 2007, in Hellfire Peninsula, the following mobs give reputation if you are neutral. These mobs will not give reputation once you are friendly with Honor Hold. Note that these mobs will stop giving reputation at Neutral:2999.\nYou can gain reputation in all Hellfire Citadel instances until you are Honored. Once Honored, standard &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Ramparts\"&gt;Hellfire Ramparts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Furnace\"&gt;Blood Furnace&lt;/a&gt; will no longer yield reputation. Using an will help you gain reputation faster. (25% reputation increase)\nUntil Honored.\nTo make the best use of available resources, it is recommended that you grind reputation with Honor Hold through &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Ramparts\"&gt;Hellfire Ramparts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Furnace\"&gt;Blood Furnace&lt;/a&gt;. If Revered or Exalted is your goal it is recommended that you save your quests in &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; until the later parts of Honored or Revered. The Honor Hold quests grant a total of 10,785 rep points for non-humans (11,863 for humans). So if you save every single rep-granting quest (including &lt;a href=\"Through%20the%20Dark%20Portal%20%28Alliance%29\"&gt;Through the Dark Portal (Alliance)&lt;/a&gt;) until after hitting 5999/6000 Friendly, then by the time you're able to run Shattered Halls, a single non-heroic run should put you at Revered.\nUntil Exalted.\nGaining reputation through Revered and Exalted requires access to &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Halls\"&gt;Shattered Halls&lt;/a&gt;, which requires level 68 and the ability to open the locked door via the key quest or a lockpicker. After receiving the Heroic key for attaining Honored, the grind to Exalted can also be helped by Heroic runs at any of the Hellfire Citadel instances.\nDue to the lack of representatives in other areas, there is a large gap during which you may not attain any Honor Hold reputation from questing and killing mobs in Outland once you depart Hellfire Peninsula. Until you are able to gain reputation within &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Halls\"&gt;Shattered Halls&lt;/a&gt;, you may wish to focus on grinding reputation with other factions as you level.\nPvP.\nPlayers that enjoy PvP can grind reputation with Honor Hold through the &lt;a href=\"Daily%20quest\"&gt;Daily quest&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Fortifications%20%28Alliance%29\"&gt;Hellfire Fortifications (Alliance)&lt;/a&gt;. This method rewards 150 reputation per day, and can be done all the way through Exalted. This quest also rewards the player with 3x that can be used to buy PvP gear from the quartermasters in Honor Hold and near &lt;a href=\"Telredor\"&gt;Telredor&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Zangarmarsh\"&gt;Zangarmarsh&lt;/a&gt;. Marks earned during PvP may be spent on . These flags will increase your reputation gain by 25%, increasing the value of a Shattered Hall run to ~2000 reputation.\nRewards.\nFaction items sold by &lt;a href=\"Logistics%20Officer%20Ulrike\"&gt;Logistics Officer Ulrike&lt;/a&gt;:\nQuests.\n\"Total Reputation Gained: 13,060\""}

If players were granted more than 4,000 honor points as a result of this one-time conversion, they were unable to earn any more until the excess had been spent.\nIn &lt;a href=\"patch%204.0.3\"&gt;patch 4.0.3&lt;/a&gt;, any honor points in excess of 4,000 were immediately converted to gold at a rate of per honor point."}

Prior to &lt;a href=\"Patch%202.4\"&gt;Patch 2.4&lt;/a&gt;, Honor points were calculated and awarded once a day based on the PvP activities of the character; a player could have a maximum of 75000 honor points.\nHonorable kills.\nAn honorable kill (abbreviated HK) is the simplest method of earning honor points. Honorable Kills are gained by killing members of the opposite faction, the faction leaders, and bosses in PvP zones such as &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20Archavon\"&gt;Vault of Archavon&lt;/a&gt;. If you kill an opposing player that is within 5 levels of you, you gain honor. The amount of honor you gain is based on your level and your target's level. You do not need to deliver the killing blow, nor do you even need to be in the same party. All members of a party \"will\" receive honor and an honorable kill if they are proximity to the kill.\nObjectives.\nMany objectives exist in both &lt;a href=\"Battleground\"&gt;Battleground&lt;/a&gt;s and in &lt;a href=\"World%20PvP\"&gt;World PvP&lt;/a&gt; that yield honor points.\nBattlegrounds.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"Battlegrounds%20Holiday\"&gt;Battlegrounds Holiday&lt;/a&gt;, honor from these battlegrounds is increased from those values noted. Fewer honor points are rewarded at lower levels.\nNo honor point reset in Wrath of the Lich King.\nOn September 23, 2008, &lt;a href=\"Eyonix\"&gt;Eyonix&lt;/a&gt; announced that, \"In order to make the transition from The Burning Crusade to Wrath of the Lich King flow as smoothly as possible, all accrued honor points will be reset at the launch of the expansion.\"\nHowever, on November 19th, &lt;a href=\"Bornakk\"&gt;Bornakk&lt;/a&gt; retracted the claim of an honor point reset, \"However, many players would still be surprised by an Honor and token reset as it isn\u2019t something we\u2019ve done in the past. As such, we've decided to not reset Honor or tokens upon the release of Wrath of the Lich King.\""}

Introduced with \"\" the Honor System is a replacement for the past system where Honor Points were used as a currency for PvP Gear.\nThe Honor System was simplified with \"&lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Azeroth\"&gt;Battle for Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;\", where every prestige level was converted to 5 &lt;a href=\"Honor%20level\"&gt;Honor level&lt;/a&gt;s, except the first prestige being converted to 2.5 Honor levels.\nFunctionality.\nHonor Talents.\nOne major feature of the Honor System is the Honor Talent Tree, available at Level 110. Honor now functions as a form of PvP experience, allowing players to progress through 50 Honor levels. As they increase in level, they'll unlock unique abilities known as \"honor talents\", specifically designed for PvP combat. The Honor Talent system is built very similarly to the main &lt;a href=\"talent\"&gt;talent&lt;/a&gt; system, with six rows of three talents. However, rather than unlocking an entire tier at once, players will unlock talents from top to bottom, starting with the left column. This ensures that players will gain far more regular bonuses from gaining rank; the first six unlocks will grant entirely new talents, while later unlocks will each make one new talent option available. It also allows players to very quickly reach the maximum overall power for their character, with subsequent ranks serving only to offer potentially more desirable alternatives to their current PvP talent choices.\nThe first row of Honor Talents are unlocked at Levels 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10. The second and third rows are unlocked every three honor levels after (13, 16, 19...) with the final talent unlocking at level 46. Levels that do not unlock talents instead grant Gold or &lt;a href=\"Glory%20of%20the%20Melee\"&gt;Glory of the Melee&lt;/a&gt;.\nHonor Talents are inactive outside of PvP-combat. In instanced PvP or Legion World PvP areas (Warden Towers), Honor Talents are always active.\nHonor Talents are permanently unlocked, and no longer reset when a player gains a Prestige Rank.\nPrestige Ranks.\nPrestige Ranks, also Prestige levels, is the rank system part of this new honor system. Once the player has reached Honor Level 50, they will automatically be granted a Prestige Rank. The player will gain access to new cosmetic effects and vanity options associated with that Rank.\nRewards include achievements; &lt;a href=\"portrait%20badge\"&gt;portrait badge&lt;/a&gt;s, that are shown beside the character's portrait; unique mounts; and unique PvP &lt;a href=\"Artifact\"&gt;Artifact&lt;/a&gt; variants, one \"look\" for each Artifact will only be available through the prestige system.\nAfter reaching Prestige Rank 1, players will always be rewarded either Gold or Glory of the Melee for reaching a new Honor Level. The max prestige rank is 25 at honor level 50.\nThe prestige ranks were removed with the &lt;a href=\"Honor%20system%20%28Battle%20for%20Azeroth%29\"&gt;new simplified system&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Azeroth\"&gt;Battle for Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;\".\nGoals.\nThe new honor system is intended to heavily reduce the importance of player gear in PvP play. Prior to the new system, gear significantly determined player power, survivability and effectiveness in PvP combat. For example, in &lt;a href=\"Patch%206.2\"&gt;Patch 6.2&lt;/a&gt;, a character with the top &lt;a href=\"item%20level\"&gt;item level&lt;/a&gt; 700 conquest gear was 80% more powerful than a character with the item level 620 introductory honor gear. This power gap had long been complained about by some players, and by the time the new honor system was revealed in August 2015, was described by the developers as \"just not that fun\", and not \"feeling right\" for PvP. An alternative gear-independent arena system, &lt;a href=\"Trial%20of%20the%20Gladiator\"&gt;Trial of the Gladiator&lt;/a&gt;, had been previewed at the announcement of the previous expansion, \"&lt;a href=\"Warlords%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Warlords of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;\", but had been removed during the expansion's alpha.\nIn the new system, the significance of gear will be heavily scaled down, with the best gear in the game providing perhaps a 7% advantage over a character who has just reached max level. This aims to still provide some satisfaction from acquiring new gear, but to for the most part remove the significance of gear from PvP, returning the focus to playing ability as well strategic options such as talent choices.\nAs well as reducing the importance of gear, the new honor system will also see the complete removal of PvP gear itself. Prior to this players would earn &lt;a href=\"Honor%20points\"&gt;Honor points&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Conquest%20points\"&gt;Conquest points&lt;/a&gt; through PvP activities, which they would spend on special gear, providing additional perks in PvP combat. With the new system, players will no longer earn currency from PvP, and will no longer need to equip separate gear to engage in it. PvP stats such as &lt;a href=\"resilience\"&gt;resilience&lt;/a&gt; will also not be present moving forward.\nPerhaps the biggest change with the introduction of the system is the introduction of the first true PvP talents. This separation of PvP and PvE was one which had long been requested by many players, especially those focused on PvP. The division is intended to finally allow the designers to create two different versions of the classes, allowing for far better balance in both arenas. Previously the developers had repeatedly expressed reluctance to divide the two game modes, creating a major limitation on the \"design space\", and thus impacting balance and freedom of design in both modes.\nThe PvP talents also serve to replace the effects of trinkets, set bonuses, enchantments and gems, all of which will no longer be active in PvP. The impact of PvE effects such as these in PvP had long been a source of complaints from players, as well as a common problem and limitation when designing new effects. Their removal is expected to dramatically reduce unpredictable burst damage, making sustained damage more important."}

This system is mathematically equivalent to the system described above, but it gives a better understanding of the reason why decay exists and how it is expected to work.\nCP to RP Rule of Thumb.\n\"This Rule of Thumb is an approximation. It is particularly bad for the highest rank brackets where voluntary server caps and individual performance can wildly skew the CP required. If you are looking to make the top #13 or #14 bracket on your server, you are better off inspecting people already in that bracket to see how much honor they are making.\"\nRank.\n Rank = 0, no title, all players start here\n Rank = 1, requires 15 HK in one week\n Rank = 2, requires RP &gt;= 2000\n Rank = 3-14, requires RP &gt;= (Rank - 2) * 5000\nDishonorable Kills.\nExample.\n Tabithea of Frostwolf ended one week with RP = 16861.\n During the following week, she scored 6 DK's. Her score became:\n RP = 16861 - 6 * 100 = 16261\n By the end of that week, she had scored only 1 HK. \n Thus she did not earn any RP for the week. \n She did lose 10% of her RP total to decay. \n RP = 16261 - 1626 = 14635\n and the next week's rank list shows her RP = 14635 as expected.\nLevel Limits.\n&amp;42; Observed Max RP was less than Predicted Cap RP\nExamples.\nHow much RP did you earn?\n # week of Dec 7, Greenman didn't quite make the top 1000, which cut off at 11640 RP.\n # his estimated RP for that week is RP=11500.\n # week of Dec 14, Greenman was WS=299 on his server, and made the total top 1000 with RP=15498.\n Decay = 0.2 * 11500 = 2300.\n Delta = 15498 - 11500 = 3998.\n # Delta = Earning - Decay gives\n Earning = 3998 + 2300 = 6298 \n # so WS=299 earned RS = 6298 for that week.\n # week of Dec 21, Greenman was WS=310 on his server, and made the total top 1000 with RP=18870.\n Decay = 0.2 * 15498 = 3100\n Delta = 18870 - 15498 = 3372\n Earning = 3372 + 3100 = 6472\n # so WS=310 earned RS = 6472 for that week.\n # higher score for a lower standing? More ranked players the second week?\nHow far can you advance?\n # Max RP is reached when Decay = Earning\n 0.2 * MaxRP = Earning\n MaxRP = 5 * Earning\n # If Greenman keeps up a consistent 6300 pts/week earning\n MaxRP = 5 * 6300 = 31500\n Max Rank = 8\nHow fast will you advance?\n # Greenman starting at week 0 with RP=18870, Rank=5:\n Week 1: RP = 18870 + 6300 - 3774 = 21396, Rank = 6\n Week 2: RP = 21396 + 6300 - 4279 = 23417, Rank = 6\n Week 3: RP = 23417 + 6300 - 4683 = 25034, Rank = 7\n Week 4: RP = 25034 + 6300 - 5007 = 26327, Rank = 7\n Week 5: RP = 26327 + 6300 - 5265 = 27362, Rank = 7\n Week 6: RP = 27362 + 6300 - 5472 = 28190, Rank = 7\n Week 7: RP = 28190 + 6300 - 5638 = 28852, Rank = 7\n Week 8: RP = 28852 + 6300 - 5770 = 29382, Rank = 7\n Week 9: RP = 29382 + 6300 - 5876 = 29806, Rank = 7\n Week 10: RP = 29806 + 6300 - 5961 = 30145, Rank = 8\nHow do you reach Rank 14?\n # How long to progress from Rank = 13 to Rank = 14 earning 12500 RP per week?\n Week 1: RP = 55000 + 12500 - 11000 = 56500, Rank = 13\n Week 2: RP = 56500 + 12500 - 11300 = 57700, Rank = 13\n Week 3: RP = 57700 + 12500 - 11540 = 58660, Rank = 13\n Week 4: RP = 58660 + 12500 - 11732 = 59428, Rank = 13\n Week 5: RP = 59428 + 12500 - 11886 = 60042, Rank = 14\nHow fast will you fall?\n # If Greenman gives up on PVP for 3 months:\n Week 1: RP = 18870 - 1887 = 16983, Rank = 5\n Week 2: RP = 16983 - 1698 = 15285, Rank = 5\n Week 3: RP = 15285 - 1529 = 13756, Rank = 4\n Week 4: RP = 13756 - 1376 = 12380, Rank = 4\n Week 5: RP = 12380 - 1238 = 11142, Rank = 4\n Week 6: RP = 11142 - 1114 = 10028, Rank = 4\n Week 7: RP = 10028 - 1003 = 9025, Rank = 3\n Week 8: RP = 9025 - 903 = 8122, Rank = 3\n Week 9: RP = 8122 - 812 = 7310, Rank = 3\n Week 10: RP = 7310 - 731 = 6579, Rank = 3\n Week 11: RP = 6579 - 658 = 5921, Rank = 3\n Week 12: RP = 5921 - 592 = 5329, Rank = 3\n Week 13: RP = 5329 - 533 = 4796, Rank = 2\nWhat standing do you need to make a given rank?\n # one week, Greenman collected 62000 CP\n # that week he earned 7800 RP (bracket 9)\n # to reach rank 11, he needs to earn at least 9000 RP\n # so he needs to go up by 2 brackets\n CP (bracket 11) = 1.52 * CP (bracket 9)\n CP = 2.25 * 62000 = 139500\n # so he needs to earn around 140k CP each week to reach rank 11"}

It is an arid land, covered in sand dunes and frequently exposed to dangerous sandstorms. The &lt;a href=\"Steamwheedle%20Cartel\"&gt;Steamwheedle Cartel&lt;/a&gt; goblins have established &lt;a href=\"Steamwheedle%20Port\"&gt;Steamwheedle Port&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gadgetzan\"&gt;Gadgetzan&lt;/a&gt; as their main centers of operation. The dock in Steamwheedle Port was presumably used for transport to the outer islands of the &lt;a href=\"Undermine\"&gt;Undermine&lt;/a&gt;, the goblin capital, but it was destroyed in the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, which also brought the ocean to Gadgetzan, where the goblins built a new dock for their shipping needs.\nHistory.\nTanaris used to be a jungle and territory of the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20Empire\"&gt;Gurubashi Empire&lt;/a&gt;. When the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt; shattered the ancient &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor%20%28landmass%29\"&gt;landmass&lt;/a&gt;, the area swiftly became the desert of Tanaris. The &lt;a href=\"Farraki%20tribe\"&gt;Farraki tribe&lt;/a&gt; of trolls were stranded here and eventually adapted to their harsh new environment, becoming &lt;a href=\"sand%20troll\"&gt;sand troll&lt;/a&gt;s.\nTanaris is the ancestral home of the &lt;a href=\"bronze%20dragonflight\"&gt;bronze dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; based out of the &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s also have a holding here in the form of an entrance to the ancient land of &lt;a href=\"Uldum\"&gt;Uldum&lt;/a&gt;, found in the southern parts of the desert. It was here that &lt;a href=\"Anachronos\"&gt;Anachronos&lt;/a&gt; first discovered the full threat of the &lt;a href=\"silithid\"&gt;silithid&lt;/a&gt;, who had been making hives in the remote regions of Tanaris. The &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Shifting%20Sands\"&gt;War of the Shifting Sands&lt;/a&gt; was consequently unleashed upon the western land of &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;.\nApproximately four years after the end of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, Cho'gall and his Twilight's Hammer clan followers arrived to Tanaris and entered its cave complex where they made a base. Not soon after, several of the members went missing or were found dead, killed by &lt;a href=\"Garona%20Halforcen\"&gt;Garona Halforcen&lt;/a&gt;. The cultists thus left the cave complex. In the same year, the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; brothers &lt;a href=\"Greydon%20Thorne\"&gt;Greydon Thorne&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Silverlaine%20Thorne\"&gt;Silverlaine&lt;/a&gt; visited &lt;a href=\"Gadgetzan\"&gt;Gadgetzan&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj%20War\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj War&lt;/a&gt;, the area was invaded by the armies of &lt;a href=\"C%27Thun\"&gt;C'Thun&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20Invasion\"&gt;invaded&lt;/a&gt; twice by the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; in the years leading to the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Steamwheedle%20Port\"&gt;Steamwheedle Port&lt;/a&gt; and many parts of Tanaris were flooded, making Gadgetzan a port. Some Tanaris goblins wisely invested in desert real estate and reaped the benefits when it became beach-front property.\nAt some point, &lt;a href=\"Grizzek%20Fizzwrench\"&gt;Grizzek Fizzwrench&lt;/a&gt; claimed a deserted beach in Tanaris where he constructed a small domicile and laboratory. Over the next years, he built a defense system using various robots and devices.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; targeted Tanaris as one of their &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Invasions\"&gt;invasion points&lt;/a&gt;. It was successfully defended by the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, Tanaris was visited by &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zekhan\"&gt;Zekhan&lt;/a&gt;. Settlements and various areas of the desert remain mostly the same; the crushed &lt;a href=\"Steamwheedle%20Port\"&gt;Steamwheedle Port&lt;/a&gt; is now being used by the &lt;a href=\"Southsea%20Freebooters\"&gt;Southsea Freebooters&lt;/a&gt;, and the Gaping Chasm remains one of the most active hives of the silithid. Now, Tanaris boasts with &lt;a href=\"camel\"&gt;camel&lt;/a&gt;s. The traveling duo also found &lt;a href=\"Dormus%20the%20Camel-Hoarder\"&gt;Dormus the Camel-Hoarder&lt;/a&gt; who had come to Tanaris to fill his personal stable of camels.\nGetting there.\nWhile questing through &lt;a href=\"Thousand%20Needles\"&gt;Thousand Needles&lt;/a&gt; players will be sent from the &lt;a href=\"Fizzle%20and%20Pozzik%27s%20Speedbarge\"&gt;Fizzle and Pozzik's Speedbarge&lt;/a&gt; south through the &lt;a href=\"Shimmering%20Deep\"&gt;Shimmering Deep&lt;/a&gt; and through the mountain pass to the south. &lt;a href=\"Gadgetzan\"&gt;Gadgetzan&lt;/a&gt; will be soon after entering.\nThere are also portals in Dalaran (&lt;a href=\"The%20Violet%20Citadel\"&gt;The Violet Citadel&lt;/a&gt;) and Shattrath (&lt;a href=\"World%27s%20End%20Tavern\"&gt;World's End Tavern&lt;/a&gt;, by talking to &lt;a href=\"Zephyr\"&gt;Zephyr&lt;/a&gt; - requires with &lt;a href=\"Keepers%20of%20Time\"&gt;Keepers of Time&lt;/a&gt;) which take you to the entry of the Caverns of Time.\nGeography.\nTanaris covers a vast expanse of &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Kalimdor\"&gt;Southern Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, just south of &lt;a href=\"Thousand%20Needles\"&gt;Thousand Needles&lt;/a&gt;. It is a blazing hot expanse of rolling sand dunes under a cloudless sky. The southern region is more mountainous, with large cavern networks, with some extending deep beneath the surface. A vast realm, Tanaris holds many secrets. The land is mostly desert, and below ground are gigantic tunnel networks. They remain largely unexplored, for few have the fortitude to venture into such a harsh landscape. Still, rumors tell of all manner of creatures that hide within the tunnels and slaughter trespassers without hesitation. Although the sea of dunes does not look as if it would support a variety of wildlife, &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Sandfury%20troll\"&gt;Sandfury troll&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"hyena\"&gt;hyena&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"scorpid\"&gt;scorpid&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"basilisk\"&gt;basilisk&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"silithid\"&gt;silithid&lt;/a&gt; bugs are quite common. Occasionally, &lt;a href=\"drake\"&gt;drake&lt;/a&gt;s are also seen soaring on the thermals that swirl over the great desert.\nTanaris contains quite a few instances, including all the &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt; instances, as well as &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Farrak\"&gt;Zul'Farrak&lt;/a&gt;. \nNotable characters.\nTanaris is home to several characters of note such as &lt;a href=\"Narain%20Soothfancy\"&gt;Narain Soothfancy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Marin%20Noggenfogger\"&gt;Marin Noggenfogger&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuests.\n\"For pre-cataclysm story line see &lt;a href=\"Tanaris%20quests\"&gt;Tanaris quests&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nIn the RPG.\nTanaris is a desert located south of the &lt;a href=\"Shimmering%20Flats\"&gt;Shimmering Flats&lt;/a&gt;. It is all shifting sands and rocky wasteland. In Tanaris, water is a precious commodity, even more than gold. You can buy water bottles in &lt;a href=\"Gadgetzan\"&gt;Gadgetzan&lt;/a&gt; as there are no easily attainable sources of water anywhere in the desert, and bringing it in by ship or trade route is more expensive than sinking wells. For that reason, goblins and gnomes build wells across the desert to farm fresh water. The &lt;a href=\"Gadgetzan%20Waterworks%20Company\"&gt;Gadgetzan Waterworks Company&lt;/a&gt;, or GWC, runs the whole operation, without which just about everybody in Tanaris would die of thirst. Almost everybody leaves the wells alone, except for the &lt;a href=\"Wastewander%20Bandits\"&gt;Wastewander Bandits&lt;/a&gt;. Furthermore, if you get too close to the coast in the wrong place, sea giants come out and make a meal of you. Wandering the desert alone is risky but you may be able to travel with a GWC patrol if they agree to be your guides.\nHistory.\nIt is said that Tanaris once housed a Titan city, a place known as Uldum. The city seems to be lost as no one has been able to find it. Perhaps the sands cover it, or maybe Uldum is just another name for the Caverns of Time.\nTanaris was also once part of the Gurubashi Empire, a troll nation that existed long before the Sundering and once covered a great part of the world. The Sundering smashed this empire, separating the trolls into tiny fragments of their former greatness. Zul'Farrak may not be a ruin of the Gurubashi, as it is too recent, although it may have been built atop such a ruin.\nLittle is known about the Caverns of Time. It seems it has always been there, a permanent landmark \u2014 surviving even changes as violent as the Sundering. Perhaps it exists outside of time itself, as a sage suggests.\nTanaris has been an endless sea of sand for aeons. &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt;, the great dragon of time, was said to make this land his home since time immemorial, thriving in the solitude of oppressive heat and miles of sand.\nExplorers that venture into the desert are warned that it has little to no cover at all. If the bandits see you, and is highly probable they will even from a distance, they will be waiting over in the next sand dune. As there are almost never any clouds at night, the moonlight makes you stand out so moving only at night is as dangerous as in the day. The worst creatures come out at night, too, like scorpids and silithid. Moreover, it gets downright cold at night.\nPeople and culture.\nThe two towns of Tanaris, Gadgetzan and Steamwheedle Port, were built and are manned mostly by goblins, with some gnomes helping out here and there. Almost all of them work for the Gadgetzan Waterworks Company. Outside the cities, the need for water is still key, but the means to get it differ. The Wastewander Bandits steal it, while the Dunemaul ogres and Sandfury trolls control the only natural wells in the region. The Southsea Pirates get theirs by raiding, or simply sailing further up the coast to resupply.\nAbout twice a year rain falls on Tanaris. When this happens, it's not just a drizzle, but an intense downpour that lasts for hours. The few scraggly plants that survive in the desert do so chiefly because of this tiny bit of moisture, but for the residents of Gadgetzan, it's a cause for celebration.\nGeography.\nLike Thousand Needles, Tanaris is a desert; but unlike the barren rocks to the northwest, this desert is made up of sand dunes. From a distance it resembles an ocean, except the waves are brown and don't move. When the wind kicks up, though, intense storms result, causing the dunes to change position and shape. If you visit Tanaris one month, you might come back the next and find that everything has moved around.\nGadgetzan and Steamwheedle Port, as well as the troll city of Zul'Farrak, are located up near the edge of the northern mountains. Because the winds blow out in the plains, theses settlements are usually spared the shifting sands treatment. Still, everywhere you go there's going to be sand. Although there isn't a lot of life in the desert, what you find there is hardy as it is their only way to survive. You can find scorpids, buzzards, elementals and hyenas, all of which are masters at finding water. If they couldn't get it from a well, they would simply catch and kill something for its blood.\nThe northern edge of Tanaris is blocked by steep hills, running all the way to the edge of Un'Goro Crater to the west and the ocean to the east. A few scattered hills and mountains litter the landscape, but mostly it's just open dunes everywhere you look. In the southwest, near the Thistleshrub Valley, there is a sloping path into Un'Goro."}

The &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Shifting%20Sands\"&gt;War of the Shifting Sands&lt;/a&gt; was consequently unleashed upon the western land of &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeography.\nThe Tanaris Desert covers a vast expanse of southern &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, just south of the &lt;a href=\"Thousand%20Needles%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Thousand Needles&lt;/a&gt;. It is a blazing hot expanse of rolling sand dunes under a cloudless sky. The southern region is more mountainous, with large cavern networks - some extending deep beneath the surface. A vast realm, the Tanaris Desert holds many secrets. The land is mostly desert, and below the ground are gigantic tunnel networks. They remain largely unexplored, for few have the fortitude to venture into such a harsh landscape. Still, rumors tell of all manner of creatures that hide within the tunnels and slaughter trespassers without hesitation. Although the sea of dunes does not look as if it would support a variety of wildlife, humans, Sandfury Trolls, hyenas, scorpids, basilisks, and silithid bugs are quite common. Occasionally drakes are also seen soaring on the thermals that swirl over the great desert.\nIt is home to a single instance; &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Farrak\"&gt;Zul'Farrak&lt;/a&gt;, as well as several &lt;a href=\"Elite%20area\"&gt;micro dungeons&lt;/a&gt;.\nMaps and subregions.\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//wow.gamepressure.com/map.asp%3FID%3D36\"&gt;Topographic map of Tanaris&lt;/a&gt;\nNotable characters.\nTanaris is home to several characters of note.

And at Steamwheedle Port, &lt;a href=\"Yeh%27kinya\"&gt;Yeh'kinya&lt;/a&gt; attempts to learn more of the essence of an ancient god..."}

He is described as a fearless explorer and sailor of uncharted waters.\nBiography.\nBackground.\nWith the death of his brother Derek during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, Tandred largely grew up as the \"baby brother\" of Jaina. As a child, it seems like he had a habit of teasing his older sister (which she possibly may not have always appreciated), but they nonetheless held a warm and loving sibling relationship.\nWhen details of Daelin's death and Jaina's actions from the &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Durotar\"&gt;Invasion of Durotar&lt;/a&gt; reached Kul Tiras, most did not want to understand why it happened and were just angry it did, including their mother. Tandred, however, knew their father could be a hard man and understood Jaina's reasons, and so did not blame her.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nTandred was thought to have died at sea in a storm, but the truth was that the &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiran%20fleet\"&gt;Kul Tiran fleet&lt;/a&gt; which he commanded had been captured and hidden in a magical storm by the traitorous &lt;a href=\"Tidesages\"&gt;Tidesages&lt;/a&gt; who served &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt;, several months before Jaina's official return to Kul Tiras.\nJaina would use their father Daelin's pendant to break the storm and free the missing fleet, returning them to &lt;a href=\"Boralus\"&gt;Boralus&lt;/a&gt;. Discovering the &lt;a href=\"Irontide%20Raiders\"&gt;Irontide Raiders&lt;/a&gt; fleet ahead of them en route to assault the capital city, they surrounded the pirates, forcing &lt;a href=\"Priscilla%20Ashvane\"&gt;Priscilla Ashvane&lt;/a&gt; to surrender. Tandred later attended the ceremony where Katherine named Jaina the new Lord Admiral of Kul Tiras.\nTides of Vengeance.\nSome time later, Tandred was at &lt;a href=\"Proudmoore%20Keep\"&gt;Proudmoore Keep&lt;/a&gt; with his family near the memorials of Daelin and &lt;a href=\"Derek%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Derek&lt;/a&gt;, as well as his own which he told his mother he appreciated. Upon Jaina's arrival, Tandred addressed her as Lord Admiral, which Jaina told him not to do and that she had always assumed Derek would be Lord Admiral. By this time Tandred had also learned that Derek's corpse had been retrieved from the bottom of the ocean by the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and that they were taunting the Proudmoores with it. With Tandred, Jaina, and Katherine together again, Tandred couldn't help but wonder what Daelin and Derek would think of what the Proudmoores and Kul Tiras at large had endured. During the family reunion, the Horde attacked &lt;a href=\"Anglepoint%20Wharf\"&gt;Anglepoint Wharf&lt;/a&gt;, and Jaina ordered Tandred to flank them with the fleet while she dealt with the Horde personally. Tandred later captained &lt;a href=\"Jaina%27s%20ship\"&gt;Jaina's ship&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Dazar%27alor%20%28battle%29\"&gt;assault on Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce Kul Tiras formally rejoined the Alliance, Tandred was chosen by Jaina to captain King &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;'s new &lt;a href=\"Anduin%27s%20vessel\"&gt;Kul Tiran battleship&lt;/a&gt;. Afterward he is found aboard the ship in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Harbor\"&gt;Stormwind Harbor&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nAdmiral Tandred Proudmoore was left to hold &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; together while both, &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Admiral\"&gt;Grand Admiral&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Daelin Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; sailed west. He took the position of ruler of the Kul Tiras following his father's demise in &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt;. Tandred is a good person but doesn't have his father's courage as he is not the man his father was. He gets a lot of help from his lady friend, &lt;a href=\"Mishan%20Waycrest\"&gt;Captain Mishan Waycrest&lt;/a&gt;. Tandred does the best he can with the few men and fewer allies he has left. He is classified as a &lt;a href=\"fighter\"&gt;fighter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"aristocrat\"&gt;aristocrat&lt;/a&gt;."}

{"id": "13074", "revid": "26060681", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=13074", "title": "Tank", "text": "A tank is a &lt;a href=\"character\"&gt;character&lt;/a&gt; whose primary purpose or &lt;a href=\"class%20role\"&gt;class role&lt;/a&gt; is to absorb damage and prevent others from being attacked. Tanks are \"meat shields\", so to speak, putting themselves between the &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s and the more vulnerable party members. The tank's task is to hold &lt;a href=\"aggro\"&gt;aggro&lt;/a&gt; of the mobs to keep them off the other group members.\nAn often-used abbreviation for tank is \"MT\" (&lt;a href=\"main%20tank\"&gt;main tank&lt;/a&gt;). The tank's role must not be confused with the \"MA\" (&lt;a href=\"Main%20Assist\"&gt;Main Assist&lt;/a&gt;). Also used to contrast from a &lt;a href=\"damage%20dealer\"&gt;damage dealer&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"healer\"&gt;healer&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn a classic &lt;a href=\"tank%20and%20spank\"&gt;tank-and-spank&lt;/a&gt; fight, the tank should be the only one taking damage, and therefore be the only one who needs healing. Even in more complex fights, healers should be able to concentrate mostly on the tank. If all group members need a lot of healing, either the tank is not generating enough &lt;a href=\"threat\"&gt;threat&lt;/a&gt; or the other players generate too much. This is a common problem in unexperienced groups, one of the most frequent reasons for &lt;a href=\"wipe\"&gt;wipe&lt;/a&gt;s.\nTanking basics.\nTanking is heavily tied in with the &lt;a href=\"threat\"&gt;threat&lt;/a&gt; game mechanic. Most mobs determine the target of their attacks by using Threat. For every enemy player or pet, the mob keeps a numeric value of how much it dislikes that enemy (= Threat). The enemy with the highest threat value is the one it usually attacks. Threat is mainly caused by three things - damaging that enemy, healing, and using special abilities that cause extra threat (such as &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Clap\"&gt;Thunder Clap&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Mangle\"&gt;Mangle&lt;/a&gt;). Each mob has its own threat table.\nA tank has to do three things:\nSurvival is the most important factor - if the tank or healer dies, the battle is usually lost. After that a measure of tank quality is the amount of extra threat he can produce - the more threat, the more damage can be dealt to the mob. High damage output made possible by extra threat eventually conserves healer mana and thus increases group survivability even more. At the same time, it's also the damage dealers' job to make sure they stay below the tank's threat by using threat reduction abilities or even holding back their fire if necessary.\nIn most groups the tank will also be the &lt;a href=\"puller\"&gt;puller&lt;/a&gt;, initiating fights and setting the pace. Remember to check your healer's mana before pulling. In higher level groups the tank may also be expected lead the group, marking CC targets for other players and marking a kill order.\nPrimary tank classes.\nThere are six combinations of class and spec which can truly be considered &lt;a href=\"main%20tank\"&gt;main tank&lt;/a&gt;s: &lt;a href=\"Warrior%20talents%23Protection\"&gt;Protection&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Druid%20talents%23Guardian\"&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Paladin%20talents%23Protection\"&gt;Protection&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Death%20knight%20talents%23Blood\"&gt;Blood&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Monk%20talents%23Brewmaster\"&gt;Brewmaster&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"monk\"&gt;monk&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Demon%20hunter%20talents%23Vengeance\"&gt;Vengeance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"demon%20hunter\"&gt;demon hunter&lt;/a&gt;s. Many other combinations of spec and class may substitute as tank in certain situations, but they are generally unable to tank most of the same-level content.\nThe following criteria define a tank's performance:\nEach class has its strengths and weaknesses; and, in end-game raids, each of them find easy and difficult bosses. Generally, Protection warriors are considered the best single-target tanks, while Protection paladins are easily the best mass-aggro AOE tanks. Guardian Druids are best in situations where high amounts of physical damage are incoming, while Death Knights are the best at handling magical damage.\nNote that on certain Raid-level encounters, unusual classes may be required to tank (for example at &lt;a href=\"High%20King%20Maulgar\"&gt;High King Maulgar&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; has to serve as tank on one of the adds).\nProtection warrior.\nProtection-specced &lt;a href=\"Warrior\"&gt;Warrior&lt;/a&gt;s with appropriate gear are the classic boss-encounter tanks in the game. In Vanilla, they actually were the only valid tank class for many encounters. They have great damage mitigation vs. single targets, and a large and versatile array of tools for tanking, which include: threat-generating tools such as &lt;a href=\"Revenge\"&gt;Revenge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shield%20Slam\"&gt;Shield Slam&lt;/a&gt;, and multiple taunts; many mitigation abilities; and finally a few panic buttons like &lt;a href=\"Shield%20Wall\"&gt;Shield Wall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shield%20Block\"&gt;Shield Block&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Last%20Stand\"&gt;Last Stand&lt;/a&gt;. A warrior tank has the fairly useful ability to break fear effects at will. &lt;a href=\"Charge\"&gt;Charge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Intervene\"&gt;Intervene&lt;/a&gt; make warriors very mobile tanks. \nProblem areas include AoE threat generation. Warriors are certainly capable at this, but they must work for it. They lack a spammable or fire-and-forget ability. Warriors also tend to have somewhat smaller health pools than other tanks, though the difference is not too large.\nGuardian druid.\nGuardian &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt; tanks feature the highest raw hit-point and armor values of any class in the game. Besides the basic allotment of tanking skills (taunt, high-aggro moves, etc.), druid tanks are immune to &lt;a href=\"Polymorph\"&gt;Polymorph&lt;/a&gt; and can shift out of rooting and snaring effects.\nGuardian druids have the advantage that even in tank gear and with a tank spec they can DPS better than most tanks by using &lt;a href=\"Cat%20Form\"&gt;Cat Form&lt;/a&gt;. This makes them slightly more attractive off-tanks in raids.\nProtection paladin.\n&lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt;s use mana and build threat with spell damage, with the key to their threat-generation being &lt;a href=\"Righteous%20Fury\"&gt;Righteous Fury&lt;/a&gt;. They can wear plate armor. They excel in pulls with many &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s, with abilities such as &lt;a href=\"Consecration\"&gt;Consecration&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Wrath\"&gt;Holy Wrath&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hammer%20of%20the%20Righteous\"&gt;Hammer of the Righteous&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Avenger%27s%20Shield\"&gt;Avenger's Shield&lt;/a&gt;, enabling them to keep many mobs on themselves more easily than a &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;. Previously, a large proportion of their threat generation was reactive, making them poor secondary aggro tanks or tanks for casters. With &lt;a href=\"Hammer%20of%20the%20Righteous\"&gt;Hammer of the Righteous&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shield%20of%20Righteousness\"&gt;Shield of Righteousness&lt;/a&gt; in WotLK, this is less of a problem. They are vulnerable to mana-burn abilities, but these are rare in PvE.\nThey have less health than other similarly geared tanks, but in return have better damage-mitigation than other tanks. Weaknesses include a lack of an ability to quickly close distance with a mob, but a paladin tank can still force ranged mobs to focus on him by using ranged taunts such as &lt;a href=\"Hand%20of%20Reckoning\"&gt;Reckoning&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Righteous%20Defense\"&gt;Righteous Defense&lt;/a&gt;.\nBlood death knight.\n&lt;a href=\"Death%20knight\"&gt;Death knight&lt;/a&gt;s have the best mitigation against magic users of any tanking class. Death knights wear plate armor but cannot use a shield, allowing use of two-hand weapons or dual-wielding one-hand weapons. The primary tanking buff &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Presence\"&gt;Blood Presence&lt;/a&gt; reduces damage taken and increase threat generation.\nAs of &lt;a href=\"patch%204.0.1\"&gt;patch 4.0.1&lt;/a&gt;, death knights have a dedicated tank talent tree, Blood. Death knights generate threat with a mix of disease &lt;a href=\"DoT\"&gt;DoT&lt;/a&gt;s (&lt;a href=\"Frost%20Fever\"&gt;Frost Fever&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Plague\"&gt;Blood Plague&lt;/a&gt;), physical abilities (&lt;a href=\"Rune%20Strike\"&gt;Rune Strike&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Death%20Strike\"&gt;Death Strike&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Heart%20Strike\"&gt;Heart Strike&lt;/a&gt;), and magic (&lt;a href=\"Death%20and%20Decay\"&gt;Death and Decay&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Boil\"&gt;Blood Boil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Death%20Coil\"&gt;Death Coil&lt;/a&gt;).\nBrewmaster monk.\nMonk tanks have the lowest health and armor of all that tanks, but have the most &lt;a href=\"avoidance\"&gt;avoidance&lt;/a&gt;. Their primary mitigation is with a unique mechanic called &lt;a href=\"Stagger\"&gt;Stagger&lt;/a&gt;, which defers a portion of damage taken, smoothing damage spikes. The monk can optionally negate this deferred damage by using &lt;a href=\"Purifying%20Brew\"&gt;Purifying Brew&lt;/a&gt;. The stagger amount can be increased with &lt;a href=\"Shuffle\"&gt;Shuffle&lt;/a&gt;, (Mastery), and &lt;a href=\"Fortifying%20Brew\"&gt;Fortifying Brew&lt;/a&gt;.\nA Brewmaster excels at tanking multiple mobs and kiting due to an array of strong AoE abilities like &lt;a href=\"Keg%20Smash\"&gt;Keg Smash&lt;/a&gt;, ranged threat generation with &lt;a href=\"Dizzying%20Haze\"&gt;Dizzying Haze&lt;/a&gt;, and mobility from &lt;a href=\"Roll\"&gt;Roll&lt;/a&gt;.\nVengeance demon hunter.\nDemon Hunter tanks have more mobility than the other classes, and are preferred over other tanks because of their high damage output. They also excel at AoE damage.\nSecondary tank classes.\nSeveral other classes have limited tanking abilities, mostly as off-tanks or tanks the 5-man instances below the level cap. Secondary tank classes generally require special &lt;a href=\"Talent%20build\"&gt;builds&lt;/a&gt; to tank effectively. All other combinations of class and build except the main tank types fall under this category. \nWarlocks.\n&lt;a href=\"warlock%20specs\"&gt;Demonology&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s with the &lt;a href=\"Glyph%20of%20Demon%20Hunting\"&gt;Glyph of Demon Hunting&lt;/a&gt; gain access to a tanking form in &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Apotheosis\"&gt;Dark Apotheosis&lt;/a&gt;. This is a demonic form, so when combined with the &lt;a href=\"Nether%20Plating\"&gt;Nether Plating&lt;/a&gt; passive gives them decent armor and damage mitigation. They also gain a range of high threat moves and a taunt. This form is capable of tanking most non-heroic content if the warlock puts the effort in to obtaining high stamina gear, but the lack of critical hit immunity means they will have trouble tanking hard hitting bosses. The lack of critical hit immunity combined with the poor defensive stats on cloth means a Dark Apotheosis warlock will have little hope of tanking any raid bosses.\nShaman.\nWearing mail armor and being able to use a shield, they have access to the second-best type of mitigation gear. They have no problems at all with one half of tanking - aggro generation. Beyond the threat generated by melee attacks, shamans can cast &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Shock\"&gt;Frost Shock&lt;/a&gt; which creates extra threat, use self-heals to add healing aggro, and finally use &lt;a href=\"Chain%20Lightning\"&gt;Chain Lightning&lt;/a&gt; for AoE situations.\nHowever, the other half of a tank's job is damage mitigation, and in that department shamans are severely lacking. They lack the good damage reduction abilities/talents of the other primary tanks, and mail gear has no avoidance/mitigation stats other than agility.\nMinions as tanks.\nSome pets can actually serve as tanks. In the early game (prior to the level cap), pets can even sometimes replace a full tank. In such a situation, the healers should always remember to heal and buff the pet.\nPets usually can tank a single mob adequately. Theoretically it is possible to have several mobs on one pet by switching targets, but in practice the threat generation of pets will not be high enough to keep aggro off the healer for an extended period of time.\nHunter pets.\n&lt;a href=\"Hunter\"&gt;Hunter&lt;/a&gt;s can have an assortment of &lt;a href=\"beast\"&gt;beast&lt;/a&gt;s as &lt;a href=\"pet\"&gt;pet&lt;/a&gt;s, and some of them can actually serve as tanks quite well. All pets have a &lt;a href=\"taunt\"&gt;taunt&lt;/a&gt;-like ability &lt;a href=\"Growl%20%28pet%20ability%29\"&gt;Growl (pet ability)&lt;/a&gt;, and hold aggro reasonably well. The use of the pet often allows the Hunter to solo various group quest bosses without the help of other players.\nWith pet talent trees, introduced in WotLK, tanking even level 80 instances is possible. With 4 hunters and one healer, killing &lt;a href=\"Coren%20Direbrew\"&gt;Coren Direbrew&lt;/a&gt; was not so hard. However using pets as a tanks in \"real\" bosses is not recommended as they don't have such large health pools or avoidance stats as real tanks.\nTenacity family pets are the best for tanking, both due to their extra health and armor and their available talents. &lt;a href=\"Turtle\"&gt;Turtle&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"beetle\"&gt;beetle&lt;/a&gt;s are the best at tanking tough enemies due to their &lt;a href=\"Shell%20Shield\"&gt;Shell Shield&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Harden%20Carapace\"&gt;Harden Carapace&lt;/a&gt; abilities mitigating damage.\nGimmick hunter builds and gear (stacking stamina, and resilience for crit-immunity) can yield a surprisingly capable tanking pet, though at the cost of completely crippling the hunter's DPS. Pets have actually tanked raid bosses, though more as a stunt than anything else. Pets can get certain abilities that would be hugely imbalanced for a \"proper\" tank, like a 40% increase to all healing received.\nWarlock minions.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Voidwalker%20%28warlock%20minion%29\"&gt;voidwalker&lt;/a&gt; minion is designed as a tanking pet. Although the voidwalker lacks a true taunting ability, it does have two abilities which generate rather high amounts of threat: &lt;a href=\"Torment\"&gt;Torment&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Suffering\"&gt;Suffering&lt;/a&gt;. While it is unsuitable for tanking any sort of instance, it does allow warlocks to solo many \"group\" quests quite easily.\nRogue.\nRogues can temporarily increase their damage mitigation greatly and survive tanking through abilities such as &lt;a href=\"Evasion\"&gt;Evasion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cheat%20Death\"&gt;Cheat Death&lt;/a&gt; (sometimes known as \"evasion tanking\"). These have a short duration, however, and rogue tanking should be very temporary. Rogues have no threat generation abilities, meaning aggro must be achieved through superior DPS. Rogues wear leather armor, which is pretty weak, so they must tank by relying almost entirely on avoidance rather than mitigating damage.\nThe first phase of the &lt;a href=\"Reliquary%20of%20Souls\"&gt;Reliquary of Souls&lt;/a&gt; encounter in the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt; is the most notable endgame bosses where rogues shine as tanks.\nIt was formerly possible to accumulate enough agility as a rogue to become unhittable, but this could only be achieved with &lt;a href=\"Insect%20Swarm\"&gt;Insect Swarm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Scorpid%20Sting%20%28hunter%20ability%29\"&gt;Scorpid Sting (hunter ability)&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Quickness\"&gt;Quickness&lt;/a&gt; racial. This combination allowed a rogue to tank certain bosses (including raid bosses) who mainly deal melee damage. However, threat generation was much lower than that of a regular tank (as he is not specced and geared for DPS), and with such low health he had no hope to survive bosses that do significant spell damage without the use of &lt;a href=\"Feint\"&gt;Feint&lt;/a&gt;. Therefore, it was generally not something worth trying except for the amusement. Since the introduction of diminishing returns on avoidance this trick is no longer possible.\nEmergency tanks.\nSome classes have abilities that can effectively serve as tanks, if only for a few seconds. This can often buy enough time to combat resurrect the main tank or to finish killing the enemies if they were already near death.\nLearning to tank.\nLearning to tank is an interesting challenge, particularly for warriors and paladins, because the excellent damage output abilities they've used for solo/small group play are so poor at generating &lt;a href=\"threat\"&gt;threat&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"threat\"&gt;threat&lt;/a&gt; article has some basic numbers on which abilities create good threat. The &lt;a href=\"aggro\"&gt;aggro&lt;/a&gt; article also has good information regarding how mob targeting works, and is a valuable resource for understanding how NPCs decide who to beat up.\nIn vanilla, levelling a tank was quite a chore, however with dual-spec and the &lt;a href=\"Dungeon%20Finder\"&gt;Dungeon Finder&lt;/a&gt;, it has actually become enjoyable - tanks are the most sought-after role in the group finder, so tanks can pretty much chain instances without needing to wait for the queue. Low-level instances are more of a challenge for a tank than most people think. The primary challenge is actually to deal with inexperienced players who tend to just want to DPS anything that moves, rather than work as a group, and lack of situational awareness. Luckily at lower levels enemies are less deadly and damage dealers' own defensive abilities may keep them up provided they don't go too crazy. As always the important thing is to protect the healer.\nAs with most skills, there's no substitute for experience. Doing some solo PvE may help to develop skills that are useful later when tanking in instances (like the proper use of the panic buttons).\nFor fun.\nIf the healer is good, try chain pulling. If things go really well, try to pull several groups at once - this allows the damage dealers to use &lt;a href=\"AoE\"&gt;AoE&lt;/a&gt;. Well geared healers can sustain this for quite some time, but still be careful. Some healers tend to forget to check their own mana pool..."}

The only common complication in fights of this type is &lt;a href=\"aggro\"&gt;aggro&lt;/a&gt; - damage dealers must be careful not to generate more &lt;a href=\"threat\"&gt;threat&lt;/a&gt; than the tank.\nThe expression is sometimes used derogatorily, meaning that the essential battle tactics for a boss are pitifully simple outside of perhaps a &lt;a href=\"stay%20out%20of%20the%20fire\"&gt;very visible and avoidable AoE&lt;/a&gt;. Occasionally this simplicity is used for &lt;a href=\"gear%20check\"&gt;gear check&lt;/a&gt; fights, so players can be more certain it is simply their equipment that must be brought to par.\nExamples: &lt;a href=\"Attumen%20the%20Huntsman\"&gt;Attumen the Huntsman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Patchwerk\"&gt;Patchwerk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Garalon\"&gt;Garalon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sha%20of%20Fear\"&gt;Sha of Fear&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sha%20of%20Pride\"&gt;Sha of Pride&lt;/a&gt;, , &lt;a href=\"Kromog\"&gt;Kromog&lt;/a&gt;"}

This mechanic usually comes into play when a &lt;a href=\"debuff\"&gt;debuff&lt;/a&gt; on the tank makes it impossible to keep tanking. This might include some detrimental effects like immense damage over time, reducing the tank's healing and survivability, or even killing the tank outright after certain conditions. To allow for the original tank to reset their debuff, the other tank &lt;a href=\"taunt\"&gt;taunt&lt;/a&gt;s the boss to take aggro off the first tank.\nThere a variety of possible mechanical variations. The tank swap debuff may be applied over time, or after certain boss abilities have occurred. Some of these debuffs may stack if multiple casts have been taken. On the other hand when removing the debuff, generally the debuff will expire over time. However if the debuff does not expire, then a specific action or movement to a certain position be required clear the debuff. The original tank is free to perform such responsibilities to clear the debuff once the new tank has aggro.\nHistorically, prior to the introduction of tank swap mechanics many raid encounters simply had a maintank holding aggro on the boss, with an offtank focusing only on &lt;a href=\"add\"&gt;add&lt;/a&gt;s, or just as a backup tank. The main boss itself did not usually need a second tank at all in single-boss encounters, and a full co-tank would only be required for the whole fight if the encounter had a pair of bosses, such as &lt;a href=\"Twin%20Emperors\"&gt;Twin Emperors&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Eredar%20Twins\"&gt;Eredar Twins&lt;/a&gt;. The swap mechanic was largely introduced during towards the end of \"Wrath of the Lich King\" and formalized in \"Catalysm\" and standardized raid compositions to always require two tanks. In &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Algalon%20the%20Observer%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Algalon the Observer&lt;/a&gt; had the \"Phase Punch\" ability that teleported away a tank and forced another tank to take over tanking the main boss. As examples in Icecrown Citadel, &lt;a href=\"Deathbringer%20Saurfang\"&gt;Deathbringer Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; had \"Rune of Blood\" which would heal the boss until the tanks swapped; &lt;a href=\"Festergut\"&gt;Festergut&lt;/a&gt; would instantly explode the tank if they took too many stacks of \"Gastric Bloat\". Whereas in \"Cataclysm\" with &lt;a href=\"Blackwing%20Descent\"&gt;Blackwing Descent&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Bastion%20of%20Twilight\"&gt;Bastion of Twilight&lt;/a&gt;, bosses had abilities explicitly labeled as tank responsibilities in the adventure guide. Some examples include &lt;a href=\"Halfus%20Wyrmbreaker\"&gt;Halfus Wyrmbreaker&lt;/a&gt;'s \"Malevolent Strikes\" reducing healing received, or &lt;a href=\"Chimaeron\"&gt;Chimaeron&lt;/a&gt;'s \"Break\" debuff massively increasing physical damage taken. Eventually in later expansions, almost all newly introduced bosses would have some form of tank swap."}

After her successful report, she, &lt;a href=\"Hawkmaster%20Nurong\"&gt;Hawkmaster Nurong&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Lao-Chin%20the%20Iron%20Belly\"&gt;Lao-Chin the Iron Belly&lt;/a&gt; break into &lt;a href=\"Sik%27vess%20Lair\"&gt;Sik'vess Lair&lt;/a&gt;. Together with Taran Zhu, they defeat the Sha of Hatred.\nAfter the Sha's defeat, she and several other high-ranking Shado-Pan stay at &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan%20Garrison\"&gt;Shado-Pan Garrison&lt;/a&gt;. While there she fights against the mantid at &lt;a href=\"Sra%27vess\"&gt;Sra'vess&lt;/a&gt;.\nIsle of Thunder.\nWhen the threat of &lt;a href=\"Lei-Shen\"&gt;Lei-Shen&lt;/a&gt;, the Thunder King, reappears, Taoshi goes with Shado-Pan forces to the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Isle of Thunder&lt;/a&gt; to stop him. Though the Shado-Pan remain neutral while the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; are at odds, Taoshi notes all three factions share a mutual goal to take down the Thunder King. As such, she works with both factions to accomplish taking the island out of the Thunder King's hands. With Alliance/Horde help, she wins them &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Vein%20Mine\"&gt;Lightning Vein Mine&lt;/a&gt;.\nSoon after, Taoshi forms a plan to take the &lt;a href=\"Stormsea%20Landing\"&gt;palace shipyard&lt;/a&gt;, which Taran Zhu declares too dangerous. She goes to the two other factions, and with their support convinces Taran Zhu to give his approval. The plan -- involving Taoshi sneaking onboard a ship and defeating its crew, then unlocking the door to the shipyard from within -- goes off without a hitch, giving the Shado-Pan, Alliance, and Horde another step forward in taking the island. \nTaoshi goes with Taran Zhu and &lt;a href=\"Yalia%20Sagewhisper\"&gt;Yalia Sagewhisper&lt;/a&gt; to the front of the Thunder King's palace to halt the resurrection of &lt;a href=\"Nalak\"&gt;Nalak&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Shan%20Bu\"&gt;Shan Bu&lt;/a&gt;, one of the Thunder King's most loyal servants. During the fight, Taran Zhu is gravely injured. Taoshi instructs Yalia to take Taran Zhu to safety.\nTimeless Isle.\nTaoshi can be found on the Timeless Isle overlooking the Celestial Court with &lt;a href=\"Hawkmaster%20Nurong\"&gt;Hawkmaster Nurong&lt;/a&gt;.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nTaoshi visits the Garrison's tavern in order to obtain a sample of the winds from &lt;a href=\"Skyreach\"&gt;Skyreach&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nNow one of &lt;a href=\"The%20Uncrowned\"&gt;The Uncrowned&lt;/a&gt;, Taoshi is within the sewers of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; in the secret &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Shadows\"&gt;Hall of Shadows&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen a monk adventurer goes after &lt;a href=\"Sheilun%2C%20Staff%20of%20the%20Mists\"&gt;Sheilun, Staff of the Mists&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Terrace%20of%20Endless%20Spring\"&gt;Terrace of Endless Spring&lt;/a&gt;, Taoshi is among the Shado-pan who aid them in the battle against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the Uncrowned learns that &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; has been replaced by &lt;a href=\"Detheroc\"&gt;Detheroc&lt;/a&gt;, Taoshi decides to find and save the real Shaw in order to expose the dreadlord. She and a &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;fellow Shadow&lt;/a&gt; of the Uncrowned infiltrated &lt;a href=\"Felsoul%20Hold\"&gt;Felsoul Hold&lt;/a&gt;, with bombs provided by &lt;a href=\"Marin%20Noggenfogger\"&gt;Marin Noggenfogger&lt;/a&gt; serving as cover. They found and located Mathias Shaw, returning him to the Hall of Shadows. After being saved, Shaw revealed to the Uncrowned that Detheroc had told lies to &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; about the Horde and had manipulated the new king into preparing Stormwind's armies to attack the Horde, thus beginning another conflict between the Alliance and Horde when the world could least afford it. To cover his tracks, Detheroc had put up wanted posters of the members of the Uncrowned all over Stormwind, claiming they had conspired with the Burning Legion, and thus turned Stormwind's citizens and guards against them. An adventurer, Taoshi, and Shaw were brought to Stormwind under the cover of night by &lt;a href=\"Fleet%20Admiral%20Tethys\"&gt;Fleet Admiral Tethys&lt;/a&gt; and sneaked their way to SI:7 headquarters, where they exposed Detheroc and defeated him.\nDuring that time, Taoshi and the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Shadow&lt;/a&gt; were wanted dead for conspiracy with the Legion.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nTaoshi appeared in the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt; when it is &lt;a href=\"Assaults\"&gt;assaulted&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Empire\"&gt;Black Empire&lt;/a&gt;, fighting with &lt;a href=\"Taran%20Zhu\"&gt;Taran Zhu&lt;/a&gt;. Her focus was against the &lt;a href=\"Deephive\"&gt;Deephive&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"mantid\"&gt;mantid&lt;/a&gt;, where she ordered their deaths. She also instructed &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s with destroying corrupted incubators, that contained mantid eggs that if allowed to spawn would hatch a new swarm empowered by &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;.\nFrom &lt;a href=\"Mistfall%20Village\"&gt;Mistfall Village&lt;/a&gt;, she directed adventurers against the mantid and the &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; clans. She seemed to be aided in this by &lt;a href=\"Chen%20Stormstout\"&gt;Chen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Li%20Li%20Stormstout\"&gt;Li Li Stormstout&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter receiving an &lt;a href=\"Ooze-covered%20Amber\"&gt;Ooze-covered Amber&lt;/a&gt; from adventurers, she felt that it seeped with power and corruption. Knowing that they could be faced with a threat if the rest of the mantid swarm's amber was similarly corrupted, Taoshi set off to investigate &lt;a href=\"Kor%27vess\"&gt;Kor'vess&lt;/a&gt;. During the investigation, she sought to slow their amber harvesting efforts by killing a handful of them. With their numbers weakened, Taoshi called on her allies to deal with the source of the corruption and acquire any corrupted amber. Knowing that the kypari trees were sacred to the mantid, the fact they had allowed &lt;a href=\"N%27raqi\"&gt;faceless one&lt;/a&gt; to corrupt them made her realize that their devotion to the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s was greater.\nShe and the adventurers were subsequently confronted by &lt;a href=\"Watcher%20Vl%27thax\"&gt;Watcher Vl'thax&lt;/a&gt;, causing Taoshi to remark that the mantid had earned &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;'s favor. With the threat dealt with, they snuck into &lt;a href=\"Klaxxi%27vess\"&gt;Klaxxi'vess&lt;/a&gt; in order to destroy the &lt;a href=\"Corrupted%20Amber\"&gt;Corrupted Amber&lt;/a&gt; stored within. Deciding that they needed to know what they were up against, they scouted out the swarm from &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan%20Kite\"&gt;the sky&lt;/a&gt;, however, they were confronted by &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Empress%20Shek%27zara\"&gt;Grand Empress Shek'zara&lt;/a&gt;, who ordered her swarm to show them the price for defying N'Zoth. After driving the swarm off, the pair safely landed on the &lt;a href=\"Serpent%27s%20Spine\"&gt;Serpent's Spine&lt;/a&gt; where Taoshi remarked that the swarm was enough of a menace on its own and that N'Zoth could transform them into something even more dire. Thus, she vowed to inform the &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan\"&gt;Shado-Pan&lt;/a&gt; of the threat, while suggesting adventurers report to &lt;a href=\"Stormspeaker%20Qian\"&gt;Stormspeaker Qian&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Rajani\"&gt;Rajani&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuotes.\nBleak Hollow, Isle of Thunder.\nIt is discouraging that Lei Shen has found so many allies to flock to his throne so soon after his return.

Players tap a mob by engaging it, and then retain this tap as long as they remain on its &lt;a href=\"threat\"&gt;threat table&lt;/a&gt; (i.e. not dying or fleeing). The tap remains even if other players participate in damaging the mob.\nTapping is usually exclusive to a group, faction or number of players. Once a limit is reached, &lt;a href=\"crowd%20control\"&gt;crowd control&lt;/a&gt; effects and &lt;a href=\"quest\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt; items return an error message \"Target is tapped\", and unit frames turn gray for other players now ineligible to tap the mob. These limits have generally become more inclusive to non-grouped players as the game has evolved:\nEtiquette.\nIn \"Classic\", it is considered good &lt;a href=\"etiquette\"&gt;etiquette&lt;/a&gt; to invite other players to your party if you intend to tap the same mob. In \"Retail\" this custom does not apply since five ungrouped players may tap the same mob; however, other players might welcome coordinating cues shared through speech and emotes.\nConversely, it is poor etiquette -- even &lt;a href=\"griefing\"&gt;griefing&lt;/a&gt; -- for one player to use the tap system to prevent other players from completing quests or playing the game. Examples include tapping multiple mobs to keep others from doing, or rushing to tap one when another player was clearly about to engage it first. "}

The effect of a flask is typically stronger than elixirs which are introduced in the same expansion, making them attractive for end-game PvE and PvP content. Though an individual flask may cost more than an elixir, they are often preferred because the effect of elixirs may expire quickly due to death.\nThere are also several items in the game that are labeled as flasks, such as quest items (ie. &lt;a href=\"Flask%20of%20Vrykul%20Blood\"&gt;Flask of Vrykul Blood&lt;/a&gt;) and reagents for crafting (ie. &lt;a href=\"Flask%20of%20Oil\"&gt;Flask of Oil&lt;/a&gt;).

{"id": "33340", "revid": "27079649", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=33340", "title": "Flavor lore", "text": "Flavor lore is &lt;a href=\"lore\"&gt;lore&lt;/a&gt; that is written \"in-universe\" and doesn't necessarily agree with what actually happened, but exists in the \"&lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20universe\"&gt;Warcraft universe&lt;/a&gt;\" to add realism and make the worlds seem more alive. Flavor lore often includes beliefs, legends, and myths kept by various cultures in the worlds, and historical accounts written by in-universe authors.\nIn-universe authors of flavor lore will often discuss the current prevailing theories at the time the book was written. Some of these ideas turn out to be true or contain only kernels of truth. Other times the legend may turn out to be wrong. When something turns out to be wrong, cultures will stop believing the legend or continue to hold onto their own viewpoint. Outdated theories continue to exist as part of Azeroth's cultural evolution even though they may not necessarily be believed anymore by current inhabitants of Azeroth.\nFlavor lore also includes references to books or documents that exist in the world but may not be published in the real world. For example, in the \"\", &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; speculates about various species origins, yet the full manuscript does not exist in a book licensed by &lt;a href=\"Blizz\"&gt;Blizz&lt;/a&gt;ard.\nMost of Blizzard's external publications such as novels and guidebooks were previously considered hard canon, but at &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon%202019\"&gt;BlizzCon 2019&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Steve%20Danuser\"&gt;Steve Danuser&lt;/a&gt; stated that the \"\" was written from the point of view of the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s and their servants, retroactively making them flavor lore. All subsequent lore books, such as the \"&lt;a href=\"Exploring%20Azeroth\"&gt;Exploring Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;\" series or the \"&lt;a href=\"Grimoire%20of%20the%20Shadowlands%20and%20Beyond\"&gt;Grimoire of the Shadowlands and Beyond&lt;/a&gt;\", have been written as flavor lore and are explicitly presented as the writings of in-universe characters who are potentially biased or misinformed.\nWhy flavor lore exists.\nIn the real world, historians do not always agree upon what occurred in events in history or what caused the events to happen in the first place. Different religions, and even scientists, have different view points on how Earth was created and how the races of Earth originated. Many of these ideas become outdated, but still exist in Earth's cultural library. Authors will project their own viewpoints into their writing. Sometimes they will debate other hypotheses and theories made by other authors.\nFlavor lore is created to emulate this mechanic of Earth culture in the world of Azeroth. It adds a dynamic of reality to the world. Some flavor lore however is created due to newer material &lt;a href=\"retcon\"&gt;retcon&lt;/a&gt;ning the older sources and is created as an explanation to reconcile the differences between old and new lore. Other flavor lore is written intentionally in order to add a sense of mystery to the unknown things.\nExamples of flavor lore.\nGalakrond.\n&lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; decided to hide the truth and tell another version of &lt;a href=\"Galakrond\"&gt;Galakrond&lt;/a&gt;'s history to the Azerothians, that led to the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe first druids.\nThe &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; believe that they were the first &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s under the tutelage of &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;, as told in the myth &lt;a href=\"Forestlord%20and%20the%20first%20Druids\"&gt;Forestlord and the first Druids&lt;/a&gt;. Though the tauren's ancestors, the &lt;a href=\"yaungol\"&gt;yaungol&lt;/a&gt;, had indeed learned to wield basic &lt;a href=\"nature\"&gt;nature&lt;/a&gt; magic beside Cenarius, \"\" confirmed that the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; is considered to be the first proper druid.\nNight elves origin.\nThere are competing legends for the origin of the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;. Some legends say that they evolved from &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s. The night elves themselves believe that they were created by their moon goddess, &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;. While &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; eventually confirmed the former origin through &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Freya\"&gt;Freya&lt;/a&gt;, night elves may find the truth difficult to accept. Brann's findings were confirmed by '.\nUniverse genesis.\nThere are several &lt;a href=\"creation%20myth\"&gt;creation myth&lt;/a&gt;s accounted. In \"&lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20I\"&gt;Warcraft I&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20II\"&gt;Warcraft II&lt;/a&gt;\", humans believed in a deity named God who created the universe. However, none of the creation myths have been verified by people in-universe, except for the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; who do know the true origins of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;Great Dark Beyond&lt;/a&gt;. \"Chronicle Volume 1\" describes its genesis as it actually happened from an out-of-universe perspective.\nCentaur.\nThe \"&lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20III\"&gt;Warcraft III&lt;/a&gt;\" manual states that the &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt; were bastard offsprings of &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;. However, other sources state that this is only one belief held by &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;. It may not necessarily contain any truth and the centaur may have a completely different origin. In other sources, we find out that another legend for the origin of the centaur turned out to be actually true for the five tribes of centaur fathered by &lt;a href=\"Zaetar\"&gt;Zaetar&lt;/a&gt; (the &lt;a href=\"Gelkis\"&gt;Gelkis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Magram\"&gt;Magram&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kolkar\"&gt;Kolkar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maraudine\"&gt;Maraudine&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Galak\"&gt;Galak&lt;/a&gt; tribes). The Cenarius legend may be true for centaur found outside of those tribes.\nTitans and keepers.\nMany events attributed to the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s were actually done by the &lt;a href=\"keeper\"&gt;keeper&lt;/a&gt;s.\nMagic.\nThe nature and uses of the forms of &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; are vigorously debated on Azeroth, but the magnitude of what magic can accomplish cannot be doubted.\nHearthstone.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\" is considered to be flavor lore.\nIn the RPG.\nLands of Mystery.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Lands%20of%20Mystery\"&gt;Lands of Mystery&lt;/a&gt;\", &lt;a href=\"Brann\"&gt;Brann&lt;/a&gt; doesn't know where &lt;a href=\"Uldum\"&gt;Uldum&lt;/a&gt; is located and hints that the Caverns of Time might be another name for the &lt;a href=\"city\"&gt;city&lt;/a&gt;. However, he points out he doesn't know for sure.\nIn another section, he discusses various theories of where the &lt;a href=\"silithid\"&gt;silithid&lt;/a&gt; race originated from. He mentions that current speculation and second-hand accounts at the time he wrote the book include; the silithid originating first, followed by the &lt;a href=\"aqir\"&gt;aqir&lt;/a&gt;, followed by the split forming the &lt;a href=\"qiraji\"&gt;qiraji&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"nerubian\"&gt;nerubian&lt;/a&gt;s. The other theory he included was that the aqir were first, then the split between the qiraji and nerubians, and the silithid were created by either the qiraji, or some other, at the time, unknown force.\nAppendix Three.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Manual%20of%20Monsters\"&gt;Manual of Monsters&lt;/a&gt;\": \"&lt;a href=\"Manual%20of%20Monsters/Appendix%20Three\"&gt;Appendix Three: Other Monsters in Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" created flavor lore to incorporate creatures originally derived from non-\"Warcraft\" sources so that they could fit into \"Warcraft\" lore. In some examples, the creatures are a separate species that share the same name as well-known \"Warcraft\" creatures, so special lore was written for the new creature to explain how they fit into the universe. The introduction to the book states that said lore takes precedence over any descriptions found in the non-\"Warcraft\" books the creature was derived from. There is nothing in the book that states that said creatures are not lore (in fact, it goes out of its way to tell how they fit into \"Warcraft\" continuity and that these are other creatures on Azeroth besides the ones discussed in earlier chapters of the book). However, many fans choose to ignore much of the appendix lore since most of the creatures do not show up in other \"Warcraft\" sources."}
