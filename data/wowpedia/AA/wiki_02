It started as a &lt;a href=\"skinning\"&gt;skinning&lt;/a&gt; camp and evolved into its current status as a busy but isolated trading post for the locals of Desolace, as well as the rare &lt;a href=\"Merchant\"&gt;trader&lt;/a&gt; who knows enough to come ashore. While at any given time there are a handful of individuals from various races at Flayers' Point, they are far outnumbered by the common &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"quilboar\"&gt;quilboar&lt;/a&gt;. Other visitors include &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt;, and elves. But because of the history of conflict with these three races there is no love lost between them. They shout and curse at each other, and brawls erupt like clockwork every five minutes.\nMost, though not all, merchants in Flayers' Point are women. There is a &lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt; board somewhere in the post as well. The closest thing Flayers' Point has to an inn or tavern is a wooden lean-to with three walls called the Tanner's Bed.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the area was visited by &lt;a href=\"Greydon%20Thorne\"&gt;Greydon Thorne&lt;/a&gt;, his &lt;a href=\"Aramar%20Thorne\"&gt;son&lt;/a&gt;, and crew."}

He is then accompanied by a small &lt;a href=\"hozen\"&gt;hozen&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Nanners\"&gt;Nanners&lt;/a&gt;, claiming that he can't be a successful pirate captain without a proper matey and that Nanners is more handy.\nHistory.\nFleet Admiral Tethys is a high-ranking member of the Bloodsail Buccaneers, he is known to be a scurvy and fearsome pirate, and one of the greatest swashbucklers of the Great Sea. His reputation as a bloodthirsty and ruthless pirate precedes him, creating fear in pirates of other crews.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, one of his best men, &lt;a href=\"Eliza%20Goreblade\"&gt;Admiral Eliza Goreblade&lt;/a&gt;, discovered a pair of ornately crafted cutlasses inside a recently unearthed wreck not far from &lt;a href=\"Booty%20Bay\"&gt;Booty Bay&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Dreadblades\"&gt;The Dreadblades&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Fate\"&gt;Fate&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fortune\"&gt;Fortune&lt;/a&gt;. The moment Eliza touched them, she had a vision of herself conquering city after city, commanding a crew of lost souls. When Tethys and the rest of the Bloodsails realized the depths of her insanity and attacked her, she fought off their attack and took control of the \"&lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Veil\"&gt;Crimson Veil&lt;/a&gt;\".\nLegion.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, Tethys joined the Uncrowned as a Shadow of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Shadows\"&gt;Council of Shadows&lt;/a&gt;, the leaders of the secret rogue organization located in the secret &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Shadows\"&gt;Hall of Shadows&lt;/a&gt;, in the sewers of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Jorach%20Ravenholdt\"&gt;Lord Jorach Ravenholdt&lt;/a&gt; organized the Council of Shadows to obtain the rogue legendary artifacts in order to equip their champion who would operate outside and vanquished their foes, Tethys enlisted the aid of the Last Shadow in retaking their &lt;a href=\"Horizon%27s%20Edge\"&gt;ships&lt;/a&gt; from Eliza's crew and &lt;a href=\"The%20Dreadblades\"&gt;The Dreadblades&lt;/a&gt; from Eliza's possession.\nHe invited the Last Shadow to meet him aboard the Crimson Veil, retaken by the Bloodsails, now docked in Booty Bay in order to take them to the &lt;a href=\"Dead%20Man%27s%20Bay\"&gt;Dead Man's Bay&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Azsuna\"&gt;Azsuna&lt;/a&gt; where Eliza's crew and the legendary cursed blades were located. Tethys is present alongside his men during the fighting against the &lt;a href=\"Dread%20Fleet\"&gt;Dread Fleet&lt;/a&gt; and manages to regain possession of the &lt;a href=\"Horizon%27s%20Edge\"&gt;Horizon's Edge&lt;/a&gt;, before indicating that Eliza is in the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20a%20Thousand%20Lights\"&gt;Temple of a Thousand Lights&lt;/a&gt;. When the Last Shadow managed to eliminate the undead Admiral and obtain the legendary cursed blades, Tethys set sail for Dalaran and invited the rogue hero to meet him at the Hall of Shadows.\nAfter successfully securing all of the artifacts, Tethys was poisoned among the members of the Council of Shadows during their meeting by &lt;a href=\"Vanessa%20VanCleef\"&gt;Vanessa VanCleef&lt;/a&gt;, Kingpin of the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;, who wanted the place of Last Shadow.\nSome time later, Tethys contacted the Last Shadow to offer them to integrate more pirates into the ranks of the Uncrowned by using the service &lt;a href=\"Yancey%20Grillsen\"&gt;Yancey Grillsen&lt;/a&gt; who lives in &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn\"&gt;Stranglethorn&lt;/a&gt;. After recruiting Yancey into his crew, he asked him to take care of recruiting and training some crew of Pirates for the order, before thanking the Last Shadow for having given him the best adventure in recent years, agreeing to become a champion in their service.\nFollowing the discovery of the body of an agent in the &lt;a href=\"Underbelly\"&gt;sewers of Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, the Uncrowned sent agents to investigate the situation in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;, where they discovered that &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; had increased the number of agents he has in Horde territory, and ordered the elimination of &lt;a href=\"Amber%20Kearnen\"&gt;Amber Kearnen&lt;/a&gt;. Realizing that something was wrong with Shaw's behavior, Ravenholdt sent the Last Shadow and Fleet Admiral Tethys to investigate the relationship between the SI:7 and the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Blade\"&gt;Red Blade&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Citrine%20Bay\"&gt;Citrine Bay&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Stormheim\"&gt;Stormheim&lt;/a&gt;,\nOn the spot, they discovered that the Spymaster ordered the pirates to execute Amber Kearnen in exchange for access to Stormwind Harbor and a royal pardon for their past crimes committed, after having questioned a &lt;a href=\"Captured%20Pirate\"&gt;captured pirate&lt;/a&gt;. Tethys took the opportunity to steal a lot of bottles of &lt;a href=\"Red%20Blade%20Rum\"&gt;Red Blade Rum&lt;/a&gt;, while they also got their hands on a mysterious letter with a complex code that they brought to the Hall of Shadows, in order to find out the reasons for &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; to eliminate his best agent.\nAfter translating the letter with &lt;a href=\"The%20Raven%27s%20Eye\"&gt;The Raven's Eye&lt;/a&gt; and uncovering the plan of the &lt;a href=\"dreadlord\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Detheroc\"&gt;Detheroc&lt;/a&gt;, Tethys accompanied &lt;a href=\"Tess%20Greymane\"&gt;Tess Greymane&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=\"Lilian%20Voss\"&gt;Lilian Voss&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Dead%20Man%27s%20Bay%20\"&gt;Dead Man's Bay &lt;/a&gt; in order to deal with the &lt;a href=\"Blacksail%20Crew\"&gt;Blacksail Crew&lt;/a&gt;, with which he already had a history, to take their &lt;a href=\"Fel-Infused%20Gunpowder%20Cache\"&gt;Fel-Infused Gunpowder Cache&lt;/a&gt; from them. He also took the opportunity to take revenge on them following a story of gambling and a fight, and asked the Last Shadow to burn their stuff, expressing his thanks and satisfaction at having been avenged after the task was completed, before being \"betrayed\" by his &lt;a href=\"axebeak\"&gt;axebeak&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Crackers\"&gt;Crackers&lt;/a&gt;, who leaves him for the Last Shadow. Later he replaced Crackers by a small &lt;a href=\"hozen\"&gt;hozen&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Nanners\"&gt;Nanners&lt;/a&gt;, claiming that he can't be a successful pirate captain without a proper matey and that Nanners is more handy.\nNow in possession of explosives, Tethys participated in the rescue of Mathias Shaw alongside the Uncrowned with great excitement at the idea of \u200b\u200busing them to destroy demons and for the show, so much so that he let out a sob of happiness after the explosion.\nHe is present in the Chamber of Shadows when Lord Jorach Ravenholdt rewarded the Last Shadow for their many exploits with the title of Shadowblade and the &lt;a href=\"Shadowblade%27s%20Murderous%20Omen\"&gt;Shadowblade's Murderous Omen&lt;/a&gt;.\nAbilities.\nAs a follower.\nFleet Admiral Tethys is an Outlaw Rogue with the following abilities:\nQuotes.\nGossip.\nWhat can I do for ya?"}

Against heavily-armored targets like plate-wearers in &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt; and raid bosses, the damage increase from this ability can be substantial. It is imperative that a good arms warrior keep Colossus Smash up almost all the time.\nColossus Smash has a 30 second cooldown and lasts 8 seconds, which is infrequent enough that choosing the right time to use it is very important. Colossus Smash should not be wasted on anything that will die quickly without posing much of a threat, such as AoE trash. In contrast, &lt;a href=\"boss\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt;es should have Colossus Smash on them every second that it's possible to do so. Colossus Smash shines especially bright during the &lt;a href=\"Execute\"&gt;Execute&lt;/a&gt; phase of a raid boss fight.\nUsing Colossus Smash followed immediately by &lt;a href=\"Bladestorm\"&gt;Bladestorm&lt;/a&gt; can deal a lot of damage. In general &lt;a href=\"resource%20pooling\"&gt;pooling rage&lt;/a&gt; and having cooldowns available for use during Colossus Smash is highly effective.\nTrivia.\nColossus Smash is one of &lt;a href=\"Varian\"&gt;Varian&lt;/a&gt;'s Heroic Abilities in \"&lt;a href=\"Heroes%20of%20the%20Storm\"&gt;Heroes of the Storm&lt;/a&gt;\".

While in this state, the character is restricted from some specific actions, such as eating.\nThe combat flag.\nWhen a character attacks or is attacked, he will be flagged by the game as being in combat. This state is denoted to the player with an icon of two crossing swords next to their character portrait. Many actions and abilities cannot be used while you are in combat, making knowing how to get into and out of combat very important, especially in &lt;a href=\"Player%20vs%20Player\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt; combat.\nIn &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt;, a player will leave combat if they have not attacked or been attacked for 6 seconds, or all the enemy characters that have attacked you are killed.\nUnder most circumstances in &lt;a href=\"PvE\"&gt;PvE&lt;/a&gt;, once all monsters have lost interest in you, you will be removed from combat.\nAbilities that cannot be used while in combat.\nWhen in combat, several abilities become unavailable including &lt;a href=\"drink\"&gt;drink&lt;/a&gt;ing, &lt;a href=\"Food\"&gt;eating&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mounts\"&gt;mounting&lt;/a&gt;, and accepting a &lt;a href=\"summon\"&gt;summon&lt;/a&gt;. In addition:\nAbilities that allow you to escape combat.\nSome classes have abilities that remove them from combat instantly. However, if they are &lt;a href=\"Damage%20over%20Time\"&gt;dotted&lt;/a&gt; they will usually be brought back into combat the next time they take damage. Note that these abilities no longer remove you from combat during Boss Fights (only at the end of wipes if you time it correctly).\nGeneral combat concepts.\n&lt;a href=\"Aggro\"&gt;Aggro&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"add\"&gt;add&lt;/a&gt;s.\nUsing your favorite high-damage spell to pull a mob is not the best idea in the world. For one, it can make it very difficult for other players, such as warriors, to pull it off you (in the case of taunt resists, etc), increasing the likelihood that you will go down. Secondly, high-threat spells have a much higher chance of pulling other creatures around the mob, which can also be dangerous. In most cases, if you are a caster and you are pulling, you would be better off to use your &lt;a href=\"wand\"&gt;wand&lt;/a&gt;, as even a crit from a wand is relatively low threat, whereas your Frostbolt is not.\nIf you are in combat and you have undesirable aggro (on a low-armor character, for example) you may want to follow one of the following courses of action. Which one you choose depends on a variety of factors, including the class that is tanking (paladin or warrior, or whatever else), the talent build of that player (specced for protection, or whatever), and his skill at maintaining aggro and the abilities at his disposal.\nIf the tank's build (and skill) allows him to build aggro on multiple mobs that he is tanking, you may want to change targets to one of the other mobs he has aggro on, and then switch back perhaps after he has established good aggro on the one that began attacking you.\nIf the tank's build (and skill) does not allow him to maintain good aggro on multiple mobs, you may want to just stop attacking for a while, or use an ability that you might have which reduces your aggro, and wait for a moment before commencing fire.\nWhat you definitely do not want to do is run away from the mob in an undisciplined manner. It would be best to run towards the tank, so that he can see that you have aggro. This of course may be unwise if the mob he is tanking deals damage in an &lt;a href=\"area%20of%20effect\"&gt;area of effect&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Mana\"&gt;Mana&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"health\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt;.\nKeeping an eye on your mana and health before and during battle can mean the difference between life and death. Make sure to glance at it often. It is also a good idea to try to anticipate how much damage you will be taking during the battle so you know when it would be a good idea to use any cooldown abilities or a potion that may just save your life.\nWhile in a group while questing or (more likely) going through an instance, it also helps to keep an eye on health and mana of the rest of your party.\nEspecially for those who were designated to start the fights (i.e. &lt;a href=\"Pull\"&gt;Pull&lt;/a&gt;) you are going to put your companions and yourself into grave danger if you start a new fight while your main healer is still sitting down to get his mana back up.\nReady attack before in range.\nSometimes you might want to right-click on a &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt; to attack it when it is out of range. Why? Because you can run toward it and your character will &lt;a href=\"melee\"&gt;melee&lt;/a&gt; attack as soon as you get in range. This tactic gives you a slightly quicker attack than running close enough and then attacking.\nThis tactic also helps against &lt;a href=\"caster\"&gt;caster&lt;/a&gt; and other ranged mobs, since you can sometimes run up and get a hit in before they finish casting their first spell.\nRanged weapons.\nAlso called &lt;a href=\"pull\"&gt;pull&lt;/a&gt;ing, try to use a &lt;a href=\"ranged\"&gt;ranged&lt;/a&gt; weapon or &lt;a href=\"spell\"&gt;spell&lt;/a&gt; to begin combat with most creatures in the distance. This gives you an extra hit before melee combat begins. If you have one, try to use a powerful attack to inflict the most damage before a fight. For example if you have a spell that sports a long casting time that is generally very difficult to use in combat, eg. Starfire for a druid or Pyroblast for a fire mage, use that because of the amount of damage done. \nBe careful with this tactic against ranged caster mobs, since melee combat can have the advantage of interrupting or delaying spells where ranged attacks generally give the caster ample &lt;a href=\"Casting%20Time\"&gt;casting time&lt;/a&gt; to cast spells.\nAn advanced tactic to use in combination with a range weapon or spell is to try and perpetually run away from your opponent in circles (making sure you don't aggro anything else of course) allowing yourself just enough time to get a hit off but proceed running. This is called &lt;a href=\"Kite\"&gt;kiting&lt;/a&gt;. If done properly the opponent may never lay a finger on you.\nRunning away.\nNever eliminate the option of running away, if a battle starts going badly; but only when you are not in an instance.\nWatch how much damage per hit an opponent does and when you get to about half &lt;a href=\"health\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt;, you might want to think about running if you can't &lt;a href=\"Healing\"&gt;heal&lt;/a&gt; or won't kill the opponent before you &lt;a href=\"Death%20%28gameplay%29\"&gt;die&lt;/a&gt;. Especially consider running, if you are fighting more than one opponent. Note that many &lt;a href=\"humanoid\"&gt;humanoid&lt;/a&gt; mobs will flee themselves when they are at 15% of their normal health level (on average; some mobs will run before they reach 15%, and some don't run until they are very close to dying). However, after a few seconds of wandering off, they will return to fight you. Be careful, usually they take this time to bring more mobs with them if possible.\nPhysical combat.\nMelee vs. ranged.\nThe choice between melee and ranged combat depends mostly on your class. Most classes have all their best abilities in one category. Some are lucky enough to have some abilities designed to help them switch to their preferred range, such as &lt;a href=\"Wing%20Clip\"&gt;Wing Clip&lt;/a&gt;. Below are tactics for keeping your foe at your preferred range (especially when it is not theirs).\n&lt;a href=\"Dual%20wield\"&gt;Dual wield&lt;/a&gt;ing.\nYour total &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt; output when fighting with two &lt;a href=\"weapon\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt;s should be higher than fighting with one weapon and a &lt;a href=\"shield\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt;, but roughly equal to fighting with a &lt;a href=\"two-handed\"&gt;two-handed&lt;/a&gt; weapon. &lt;a href=\"Off%20hand\"&gt;Off-hand&lt;/a&gt; weapon attacks deal 50% of the weapon's designated damage. Therefore, it's wise to always put the best \"damage dealer\" weapon in the &lt;a href=\"main%20hand\"&gt;main hand&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Dual%20wield\"&gt;Dual wield&lt;/a&gt;ing also increases your base miss chance using the formula 80% \u00d7 M + 20% where M is your miss chance when not dual-wielding. Your usual miss chance against an opponent of equal level is 5% which means the typical miss chance while dual-wielding is 24%.\n&lt;a href=\"Rogue\"&gt;Rogue&lt;/a&gt;s who specialize in the &lt;a href=\"Rogue%20talents%23Combat\"&gt;Combat&lt;/a&gt; talent tree gain the passive ability &lt;a href=\"Ambidexterity%20%28rogue%20ability%29\"&gt;Ambidexterity (rogue ability)&lt;/a&gt;, which increases the damage done by off hand weapons by 75%.\nA Fury-talented &lt;a href=\"Warrior\"&gt;Warrior&lt;/a&gt; with the dual-wield talent increases the off-hand weapon's damage from 50% up to 62.5%.\n&lt;a href=\"Dual%20wield\"&gt;Dual wield&lt;/a&gt;ing versus &lt;a href=\"Two-Handed\"&gt;two-handed weapons&lt;/a&gt;.\nabout each class:\nThe talents are pretty much a dead give away as to the viability of DW or 2 handed for Shamans, but we'll run the math anyway. (Also note the shaman abilities are weighted toward dual wielding. Stormstrike is unnormalized and hits with both weapons. Shamanistic Rage gives mana on hit and is not based on weapon damage.)\nSome Basic &lt;a href=\"DPS\"&gt;DPS&lt;/a&gt; Math:\n + Section below not yet modified + \nFor weapons of equal dps, x will be approximately .76y.\nWe know from these equations then, that:\nIn order to determine which weapon combination is superior, then we equate the two formulas:\nThis tells us then that a two-handed sword must at least have about 20% more DPS than each of the two individual swords. \nThis also means that dual wielding receives 1.2 times the damage bonus from attack power. This is because power affects both main- and off-hand. Thus with enough power, dual wielding will always be better than using a two-hander. Imagine having a 80 DPS two-hander and two 10 DPS swords. But you have 5600 attack power.\nTwo-hand DPS becomes (using above formula):\n0.95 \u00d7 [80 + (5600 / 14)] = 0.95 \u00d7 480 = 456\nDual-wield DPS becomes:\n1.14 \u00d7 [10 + (5600 / 14)] = 467.4\nThe level 15 white one handed swords do more DPS than the hardcore raid epic two-hander!\nThis is of course a rather irrational example as it is impossible to attain 5600 power, but it illustrates that attack power scales better with dual wielding.\nThis tells us then that a two-handed sword must at least have about 30% more DPS than the DPS of each of the two individual swords. And that the dual wielder receives 30% more bonus from attack power.\nTaking a look on Wowhead to see what 1H and 2H \"green\"-&lt;a href=\"quality\"&gt;quality&lt;/a&gt; swords there are around level 30-35 will give us the &lt;a href=\"Nobles%20Brand\"&gt;Nobles Brand&lt;/a&gt; set of 1H swords (22.3 DPS, level 35) and the &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Tiger%20Blade\"&gt;Frost Tiger Blade&lt;/a&gt; (29 DPS, level 35). The 2H blade's DPS is about 30% more than the 1H blade. Another example would be the 1H &lt;a href=\"Jade%20Serpentblade\"&gt;Jade Serpentblade&lt;/a&gt; (18.4 DPS, level 30) vs 2H &lt;a href=\"Stonecutter%20Claymore\"&gt;Stonecutter Claymore&lt;/a&gt; at (23.9 DPS, level 30). The 2H blade's DPS here is again 30% more than the 1H blade.\nWe can then conclude that unless you are a Fury Warrior, the better weapon choice to increase DPS is to use a two-handed blade as Arms. Even with dual wield specialization, a two-hand weapon is equal to two one-handed weapons of the same quality.\nMagic.\n&lt;a href=\"Resistance\"&gt;Resistance&lt;/a&gt;.\nDon't forget that opponents of a much higher level than you have a fair chance of resisting any magical attacks, so don't always rely on initial &lt;a href=\"Crowd%20Control\"&gt;crowd control&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"root\"&gt;root&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"snare\"&gt;snare&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"spell\"&gt;spell&lt;/a&gt;s to set up a fight. Don't be unprepared if the target &lt;a href=\"resist\"&gt;resist&lt;/a&gt;s a spell or two.\nAlso consider specific types of spells against targets that might have specific types of resistances. Magical cold or water &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s might have a frost resistance, for example.\n&lt;a href=\"Casting%20Time\"&gt;Cast time&lt;/a&gt; and interruption.\nThe longer it takes to cast a spell, the more times you're going to get whacked (further delaying the spell) and the more likely it is that your opponent will be able to use a stun or other spell-interrupting skill on you. This is of particular importance in PvP since the other player has to react fast enough to interrupt you, and a faster spell gives them a smaller time to do that.\nDamage avoidance.\nMelee combat is resolved using a chart of possible results for each attack. The sequence of results is: auto-crit (a target not standing up is always critically hit, and this value is either 0% or 100% for each attack), &lt;a href=\"miss\"&gt;miss&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"dodge\"&gt;dodge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"parry\"&gt;parry&lt;/a&gt;, glancing blow (players versus monsters only), block, critical hit, crushing blow (monsters versus players only), and finally a normal hit. If the percentage chances add up to more than 100% then latter results will not be performed at the expected % rate because the random roll used to get a result from the chart is from only 1 to 100.\nWays of avoiding damage are &lt;a href=\"miss\"&gt;miss&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"dodge\"&gt;dodge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"evade\"&gt;evade&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"parry\"&gt;parry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"absorb\"&gt;absorb&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"resist\"&gt;resist&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"immune\"&gt;immune&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"reflect\"&gt;reflect&lt;/a&gt;. There's also an hypothetical &lt;a href=\"deflect\"&gt;deflect&lt;/a&gt; outcome about which we need more information."}

Combat pets can be permanent or temporary, and most classes are able to summon at least one. Some combat pets have multiple abilities, while others have only a basic attack, but all share the basic &lt;a href=\"pet%20commands\"&gt;pet commands&lt;/a&gt;, allowing the player to control their movement and behaviour. Players can only have 1 combat pet active at any time, and summoning another will dismiss the current pet.\nClasses.\nThere are two primary combat pet classes: &lt;a href=\"hunter%20pet\"&gt;hunter pet&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"warlock%20minion\"&gt;warlock minion&lt;/a&gt;s. These classes have a number of available combat pets (although only one can be active at a time) and the chosen pet is permanent. Each of the available pets has its own strengths and weaknesses, as well as differing abilities. Hunters must &lt;a href=\"Tame%20Beast\"&gt;tame wild beasts&lt;/a&gt; so that they can become their pets, while warlocks use powerful spells to &lt;a href=\"warlock%20summons\"&gt;summon&lt;/a&gt; their &lt;a href=\"warlock%20minion\"&gt;minion&lt;/a&gt;s from the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;.

Should they die, the abilities used to summon these pets have 2-3 minute cooldowns.\nMany other classes can summon \"temporary\" combat pets. &lt;a href=\"Priest\"&gt;Priest&lt;/a&gt;s can summon the &lt;a href=\"shadowfiend\"&gt;shadowfiend&lt;/a&gt;, dealing damage and restoring mana; &lt;a href=\"druid%20talents%23balance\"&gt;Balance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s can use &lt;a href=\"Force%20of%20Nature\"&gt;Force of Nature&lt;/a&gt; to summon 3 &lt;a href=\"treant\"&gt;treant&lt;/a&gt;s; &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;s can use &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Elemental%20Totem\"&gt;Fire Elemental Totem&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Earth%20Elemental%20Totem\"&gt;Earth Elemental Totem&lt;/a&gt; to summon the corresponding elemental, and &lt;a href=\"shaman%20talents%23Enhancement\"&gt;Enhancement&lt;/a&gt; shamans can additionally use &lt;a href=\"Feral%20Spirit\"&gt;Feral Spirit&lt;/a&gt; to summon 2 Spirit wolves.

Rating is converted linearly to percentage; the number of rating points needed to gain one percentage point increases with level and varies depending on the stat, but is the same for all classes. Combat ratings were introduced because percentage-based itemization would have scaled excessively when \"\" was released and the level &lt;a href=\"cap\"&gt;cap&lt;/a&gt; rose to 70.\nSecondary ratings.\nThe following secondary ratings are currently in use:\nUnlike fixed percentages such as 2% critical strike chance, combat ratings diminish in potency as characters increase in level. 2% critical strike chance is the same at every level, while 14 critical strike rating grants 5.16% crit at level 10, 2.62% crit at level 30, and 0.4% crit at level 60. This allows &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard&lt;/a&gt; the ability to create and add new and better items to the world without eventually reaching a point where every character has a 100% chance to critically strike. Combat ratings further diminish as a player gains excessive stats from rating, reducing the rating's potency even at the same player level.\nAll classes convert ratings into attributes at the same ratio, with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Mastery\"&gt;Mastery&lt;/a&gt;, where the ratio is determined by class specialization. Below are the conversions for combat ratings at various levels:\nCombat Ratings.\nThe following table shows the amount of rating necessary for 1% of a secondary stat before diminishing returns. Due to the nature of this change, the exact rating values for diminished stats will not be listed.\nTertiary Ratings.\nAdded in &lt;a href=\"Patch%206.0.2\"&gt;Patch 6.0.2&lt;/a&gt;, these bonus stats have a chance to appear on gear from certain sources. Some items and player abilities (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Rending\"&gt;Soul Rending&lt;/a&gt;) grant these stats as well.\nDefensive ratings.\nThese ratings were commonly referred to as avoidance ratings (prior to the introduction of the &lt;a href=\"Avoidance\"&gt;Avoidance&lt;/a&gt; stat), and are not currently itemized on end-game gear and can usually only be found on some leveling or older raiding gear, or from bonuses like &lt;a href=\"Azerite\"&gt;Azerite Traits&lt;/a&gt;. For some classes and specs, these are gained passively through other stats (while protection warriors gain parry chance from strength, they also receive parry rating from critical strike rating via &lt;a href=\"Riposte\"&gt;Riposte&lt;/a&gt;). \nDiminishing returns.\nBeginning with &lt;a href=\"patch%209.0.1\"&gt;patch 9.0.1&lt;/a&gt;, combat stat ratings start to have diminishing returns above 30% stat gained from rating. This effect causes a ramping \"penalty\" on further stat rating gains, requiring more rating to receive an additional 1%. The amount diminished is based upon fixed stat brackets (or soft caps). \nThis penalty does not count secondary stat gains from fixed stat percentage buffs (such as &lt;a href=\"Heroism\"&gt;Heroism&lt;/a&gt;).\nRemoved secondary stats.\nThe following combat ratings are either no longer itemized on gear or have been removed from game. This chart is purely for historical purposes, and will not be updated to reflect future events (such as a &lt;a href=\"stat%20squish\"&gt;stat squish&lt;/a&gt;).\nNotes:\nWrath of the Lich King: Classic.\nThe following tables display the secondary stat ratings present in \"\" and the necessary amounts of rating needed per 1% secondary stat (or 1 point for Expertise, 1 skill point for Defense). \nSecondary stats that are not itemized as ratings (&lt;a href=\"Spell%20Penetration\"&gt;Spell Penetration&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"MP5\"&gt;MP5&lt;/a&gt;, etc.) are not included as these stats do not use the combat rating system and thus have the same effect at all levels."}

The armory was locked, and the last time Fareeya saw her, Atalaa was leading a force to secure it. Atalaa succeeded in her mission but died at some point afterward, her spirit eternally focused on guarding the &lt;a href=\"Armor%20of%20the%20Triumvirate\"&gt;Armor of the Triumvirate&lt;/a&gt; within. Unlike Fareeya, Gaal did not make it to the \"Genedar\" but would survive as one of the &lt;a href=\"Broken\"&gt;Broken&lt;/a&gt;.\nThousands of years later, the &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Army of the Light&lt;/a&gt; returned to the planet with their allies from &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. An &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; discovered a piece of the armory's key, and after gathering the rest, it was reforged by Gaal. Within the armory, Atalaa's spirit had to be defeated to retrieve the Armor of the Triumvirate, still believing that she was defending it from the newly-turned man'ari eredar."}

After stealing the power of storms from the &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"keeper\"&gt;keeper&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ra\"&gt;Ra&lt;/a&gt;, Lei Shen united the mogu clans into the first great &lt;a href=\"mogu%20empire\"&gt;mogu empire&lt;/a&gt;. Able to defeat even an &lt;a href=\"August%20Celestial\"&gt;August Celestial&lt;/a&gt; in combat, none were able to stop his goals of unifying &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;. During his rule, Lei Shen made several significant changes and contributions to Pandaria. The construction of the &lt;a href=\"Serpent%27s%20Spine\"&gt;Serpent's Spine&lt;/a&gt;, the great barrier separating the dreaded &lt;a href=\"mantid\"&gt;mantid&lt;/a&gt; from the rest of the Empire, is often cited as his greatest achievement.\nRecently, the Thunder King was resurrected by the mogu's &lt;a href=\"Zandalar%20tribe\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; allies and attempted to unify the mogu once again, serving as the main antagonist in &lt;a href=\"patch%205.2.0\"&gt;patch 5.2&lt;/a&gt;. However, the combined &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan%20Assault\"&gt;Shado-Pan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor%20Offensive\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sunreaver%20Onslaught\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; assault on the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Isle of Thunder&lt;/a&gt; put an end to Lei Shen's rule once and for all.\nLei Shen serves as the secondary antagonist in \"\".\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nYoung Lei Shen was born the son of a warlord during the terrible &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20a%20Hundred%20Kings\"&gt;Age of a Hundred Kings&lt;/a&gt;. Born into the same tribe, Lei Shen and &lt;a href=\"Sparkmancer%20Vu\"&gt;Sparkmancer Vu&lt;/a&gt; grew as close as brothers. As children, they played, quarreled, and challenged one another. It is said that this early rivalry was instrumental in developing Lei Shen's thirst for power. Despite seeing the mogu's infighting and squabbling as a betrayal of their great potential, Lei Shen remained a stalwart vassal of his father. A close advisor eventually betrayed and murdered Lei Shen's father, causing the clan to fall apart and seek refuge with other warlords, leaving Lei Shen and a handful of loyal guardsmen behind. Rather than continue the fighting, the young mogu chose to go into exile, meditating and wandering the land. Most mogu saw Lei Shen's meditations as a sign of madness and proof that he would never threaten any mogu ever again.\nThe power of Ra-den.\nLike his brothers, Lei Shen was strong of arm and fluent in the ways of war. But unlike others of his generation, he spoke of more than conquest. The legends of his forefathers were etched into his heart. Once Lei Shen had come of age and commanded his own legions, he announced his intent to awaken the gods. After years of searching, the warlord found the entrance to the hidden vaults beneath the lands north of the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt;. What he found therein was illuminating: the &lt;a href=\"titanic%20watcher\"&gt;titanic watcher&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ra\"&gt;Ra&lt;/a&gt;, who stood guard over a powerful titan device, the &lt;a href=\"Engine%20of%20Nalak%27sha\"&gt;Engine of Nalak'sha&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Highkeeper showed no reaction upon seeing Lei Shen, even as the mogu began asking him questions about the mogu's purpose. Weeks passed, and Lei Shen grew more and more frustrated, and still, Ra said nothing. When the mogu realized that Ra was not contemplating some grand plan, but had simply given up hope, Lei Shen unleashed his anger upon the keeper, accusing him of abandoning the work of the titans. The harsh words finally woke Ra from his stupor, and the highkeeper brought the mogu to the nearby &lt;a href=\"Thundering%20Mountain\"&gt;Thundering Mountain&lt;/a&gt;. There, Ra-den summoned the lingering spirit of &lt;a href=\"Aman%27Thul\"&gt;Aman'Thul&lt;/a&gt;, Highfather of the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;. The revelation that the titans of the Pantheon were dead did not, however, cause Lei Shen to fall into despair like Ra had. Instead, the mogu decided that if the Pantheon were dead and their servant refused to continue their work, he would do so himself. Without warning, Lei Shen incapacitated Ra, bound the keeper in great chains, and stole not only the keeper's power but also the power of Aman'Thul. It is said that the mogu tore out the very heart of the mogu god. And from that hateful act, he gained power over wind and storm.\nHis followers fell to their knees before him. \"We will call you 'The Lightning King'\", they said. But Lei Shen did not agree. \"Lightning strikes in an instant and is over in a flash,\" he said. \"But thunder. Thunder! Thunder proclaims the coming of the storm. Thunder quakes the skies long before the lightning strikes, and thunder echoes in the hills long after lightning's power is spent. It is thunder that sends animals cowering and fills the hearts of peasants with dread. Let thunder be my herald, so that my power is felt throughout the land. I will be... The Thunder King.\" He declared the Thundering Mountain to be his seat of power and atop its summit he built a majestic and forbidden city.\nConquest of Pandaria.\nArmed with the power of storms, Lei Shen, now known as the Thunder King, gathered together his followers and rose to power \"the mogu way\", eliminating his rivals one by one. Most did not submit to his authority: the lucky ones were vaporized by lightning or trampled by his growing legions. The others were dragged off in chains until he deemed them \"broken\". But many mogu saw in Lei Shen the unity of purpose that had been lacking in the generations since their masters had fallen silent. They flocked around the Thunder King's banner and eagerly did his bidding as he enslaved the other races, believing - as Lei Shen did - that the \"lesser\" races should serve the mogu, just as the mogu had once served their masters. Thus, he crowned himself the emperor of all mogu and of all who lived within his domain.\nThe jinyu and the hozen.\nThe Thunder King came to regard all living beings within his domain as his servants, and decided to conquer the two empires of the &lt;a href=\"jinyu\"&gt;jinyu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"hozen\"&gt;hozen&lt;/a&gt;, two races who had settled around the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt;. Though the jinyu fought valiantly, they ultimately crumbled before the might of Lei Shen. In one battle, the mogu &lt;a href=\"Haqin%20of%20the%20Hundred%20Spears\"&gt;Haqin&lt;/a&gt; ensured victory against the jinyu &lt;a href=\"waterspeaker\"&gt;waterspeaker&lt;/a&gt;s by using the fish-men's own spears against them. Afterward, the Thunder King presented Haqin with a hundred of the finest golden spears crafted by mogu forgemasters, and Haqin became one of Lei Shen's greatest lieutenants. On the eve of the jinyu's stand against Lei Shen, they were betrayed by their allies, the hozen, who had pledged their loyalties to the Thunder King in the false belief that they would receive preferential treatment under the Thunder King's reign - a promise that was never kept by Lei Shen nor his successors - as he conquered both races.\nThe Duel of Thunder and Strength.\nWhen the Thunder King needed slaves to build the cities and fortresses of his empire, he marched on &lt;a href=\"Kun-Lai%20Summit\"&gt;Kun-Lai Summit&lt;/a&gt;. Faced with a defiant populace, Lei Shen made a declaration: if a warrior could best him in one on one combat, he would depart and leave those lands in peace. If he won, however, the people of those lands would submit to his rule. The Thunder King's challenge was accepted by &lt;a href=\"Xuen\"&gt;Xuen&lt;/a&gt;, the White Tiger, who had seen the plight of the free peoples and could bear it no more. The legendary figures fought for thirty days and thirty nights as lightning fell from the skies and the ground rumbled with their fury. In the end, Xuen fell to Lei Shen's unearthly power. \"Your peasant magic is no match for my sorcery, fool of a tiger,\" Lei Shen bellowed. \"I commend your tenacity, but your defiance must be punished.\" To the people of Kun-Lai, the Thunder King proclaimed: \"Know this, those who would defy me shall witness the full power of my wrath! This creature shall not know the mercy of death. In these mountains we shall build a prison for him to stand upon for all of time. From this pinnacle, he shall watch and bask in his failure, as you and your children shall serve my empire as slaves.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Sparkmancer%20Vu\"&gt;Sparkmancer Vu&lt;/a&gt; served as the Thunder King's most trusted advisor. Despite their early rivalry, Vu fought fiercely to help Lei Shen win the throne of Pandaria. Not long after Lei Shen gained renown, the Sparkmancer was captured by enemy assassins and his tongue was cut out. Popular opinion suspected the Thunder King himself was ultimately behind this plot, a political move to silence the one mogu who knew his deepest secrets. Their brotherhood was also the source of much conjecture and fiction. The peasant masses enjoyed writing stories, including a famous saga about their feud over a woman. Despite these rumors, history shows that Sparkmancer Vu never wavered from his commitment to his Emperor; he served his friend and brother loyally to the end of his days.\nReign of the Thunder King.\nAfter his rise to power, the Thunder King built the &lt;a href=\"Mogu%27shan%20Vaults\"&gt;Mogu'shan Vaults&lt;/a&gt; to contain and protect his secrets and converted the surrounding structure into a sort of shrine dedicated to the mogu empire. The complex houses many of the empire's lost artifacts and is the resting place of the spirits of old mogu kings.\nEmperor Lei Shen unified the language, established a single currency and standardized weight and measures. He also created the first set of written laws in all of Azeroth, written in the unified language. The brutal codes enshrined the mogu's place above all other creatures, and the first rule was that sedition, insurrection, and rebellion be punished by public evisceration. The Thunder King saw great potential in the &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt;, and for this reason he did not trust them. After he conquered the land, the pandaren were forbidden to learn to read or write. Their leaders and philosophers were executed and all pandaren art and literature was burned.\nAs he began to unify his people under a single banner and subjugate the other races of &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, Lei Shen knew that the &lt;a href=\"mantid\"&gt;mantid&lt;/a&gt;, with all their strength, would never bow to his authority. He commanded his slaves to construct the &lt;a href=\"Serpent%27s%20Spine\"&gt;Serpent's Spine&lt;/a&gt;, a magnificent wall that spanned the length of the empire. It took many generations to build, but Lei Shen knew that fear would motivate his subjects. The fear of the mantid moved mountains, raised armies, secured his empire, and built his wall.\nEvery soldier of his army wore a jade badge with the symbol of a crown and crossed lightning bolts. The elite warriors formed a group called the &lt;a href=\"Emperor%27s%20Shield\"&gt;Emperor's Shield&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the one-hundred-and-seventieth year of the Thunder King's reign, the &lt;a href=\"Korune\"&gt;Korune&lt;/a&gt; spellweavers came to Lei Shen with their greatest creation. A bell cast from the makers' flesh, shaped by stars' fire, and bound by &lt;a href=\"Sha\"&gt;the breath&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;darkest shadow&lt;/a&gt;. This bell, when rung, could shake the world and call to the heavens. Taken to war, the bell's cacophonous tones stirred the hearts of Lei Shen's warriors. It fueled their &lt;a href=\"Sha%20of%20Hatred\"&gt;hatred&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sha%20of%20Anger\"&gt;anger&lt;/a&gt;, lending them strength on the field of battle. The bell's screaming voice struck &lt;a href=\"Sha%20of%20Fear\"&gt;fear&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sha%20of%20Doubt\"&gt;doubt&lt;/a&gt; into the hearts of the Emperor's enemies, sending them fleeing in his path. Awed by its power, the Thunder King described the instrument as \"the voice of the &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;gods&lt;/a&gt;,\" and named it &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Bell\"&gt;Shenqing, the Divine Bell&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt some point, Lei Shen discovered a rare clutch of thundering &lt;a href=\"cloud%20serpent\"&gt;cloud serpent&lt;/a&gt;s and set to subjugating them. The largest hatchling fiercely resisted, and when Lei Shen visited the handling pens, he laughed mightily at the charred mogu that lined the walls. He took the hatchling for his own, and for its obedience, granted it power over the storms and the sky. For thousands of years following the death of the Thunder King, &lt;a href=\"Nalak\"&gt;Nalak&lt;/a&gt; has guarded the walls of his hidden citadel, awaiting his return.\nDuring his reign, Lei Shen labored to build a mechanical servant that would defend his citadel without fear. When his first attempt failed, rage took hold of the Thunder King. He poured this negative emotion into his next, and most successful, creation: the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Animus\"&gt;Dark Animus&lt;/a&gt;. At the Thunder King's behest, a young cloud serpent was twisted into the fearsome &lt;a href=\"hydra\"&gt;hydra&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Megaera\"&gt;Megaera&lt;/a&gt;. Lei Shen also commanded his sorcerers to mold an aberration that could peer into the hearts of his followers and detect betrayal. From this decree, &lt;a href=\"Durumu%20the%20Forgotten\"&gt;Durumu&lt;/a&gt; was given life. The fearless mogu commander &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Qon\"&gt;Qon&lt;/a&gt; was dubbed \"Iron Qon\" by the Thunder King for his unrelenting resolve to claim victory after victory for the empire regardless of the cost.\nLei Shen forged an alliance between the mogu and &lt;a href=\"Zandalar%20tribe\"&gt;Zandalar tribe&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s, led by &lt;a href=\"Zulathra\"&gt;Zulathra&lt;/a&gt;, and this alliance would last millennia, long after Lei Shen had passed on. Lei Shen made a promise to them: a large plot of land near the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt; would forever belong to the trolls. Lei Shen, not trusting his mogu underlings to resurrect him if killed, also told the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari troll&lt;/a&gt;s the secret to his resurrection.\nFor all his might, Lei Shen never managed to harness two artifacts he had taken from Ra: &lt;a href=\"the%20Fist%20of%20Ra-den\"&gt;the Fist of Ra-den&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"the%20Highkeeper%27s%20Ward\"&gt;the Highkeeper's Ward&lt;/a&gt;. They were simply too much for even the Thunder King to control, and everytime he tried to use them, elemental energies lashed out at the mogu and overwhelmed him. His inability to wield the artifacts infuriated him, and despite these repeated failures, he did not give up. One way or another, he would harness the power of the ancient weapons. The Thunder King eventually gave the fist weapon and shield to a skilled blacksmith named &lt;a href=\"Forgemaster%20Deng\"&gt;Forgemaster Deng&lt;/a&gt; and ordered him to unlock the artifacts' secrets, but he also warned the artisan not to harness their power for himself, or he would suffer grave consequences. Deng promised Lei Shen that he would follow his command, but he secretly plotted to disobey his master and reasoned that if he could find a way to use the weapons, he would be able to take control of the empire himself. However, one day while tampering with the Fist, Deng was struck by a bolt of lightning and permanently disfigured. The smith eventually found a use for the two artifacts, using them to power the &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Forge\"&gt;Thunder Forge&lt;/a&gt;, an immense engine that churned day and night, creating exceptional armaments for the mogu military. Lei Shen was pleased by Deng's work, and ordered him to personally craft him weapons and armor that would put all others to shame. Just before his death, the Forgemaster crafted his three greatest creations, gifted to the Thunder King himself: a &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Spear%20of%20the%20Thunder%20King\"&gt;massive spear&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Axe%20of%20the%20Thunder%20King\"&gt;battleaxe&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Helm%20of%20the%20Thunder%20King\"&gt;mighty helm&lt;/a&gt;. During Forgemaster Deng's burial ceremony, Lei Shen uttered the words \"Today, a star leaves earth and ascends to the heavens.\"\nDeath.\nAccording to a Pandaren legend told by &lt;a href=\"Loh-Ki\"&gt;Loh-Ki&lt;/a&gt;, Lei Shen died after a great battle in the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt;, in which the mogu armies were overcome by brave monks. In his final moments, Lei Shen summoned an otherworldly storm that blanketed the vale for several days. The storm washed the blood of the fallen into &lt;a href=\"Whitepetal%20Lake\"&gt;Whitepetal Lake&lt;/a&gt;, which burned crimson and gave rise to &lt;a href=\"Alani\"&gt;Alani&lt;/a&gt; the Stormborn.\nIn truth, Lei Shen had decided to claim &lt;a href=\"Uldum\"&gt;Uldum&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; machinery therein as part of his empire, and led a great army of mogu and Zandalari trolls to conquer it. The &lt;a href=\"tol%27vir\"&gt;tol'vir&lt;/a&gt;, knowing that they could never defeat him in battle, instead used the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Origination\"&gt;Forge of Origination&lt;/a&gt; to scour the surrounding land, killing Lei Shen and his entire army, as well as Zulathra and most of the Zandalari leadership - a blow from which they never fully recovered. Though the Thunder King was dead, his fall had come at a heavy cost: all life in the area was snuffed out - including many of the tol'vir - leaving Uldum a cracked, lifeless desert. The Thunder King's surviving loyalists recovered his corpse and buried him in the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Conquerors\"&gt;Tomb of Conquerors&lt;/a&gt;.\nYears after the Thunder King's death and near the end of the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Troll%20Wars\"&gt;Zandalari Troll Wars&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the invading Zandalari armies, &lt;a href=\"Mengazi\"&gt;Mengazi&lt;/a&gt; - a descendant of Zulathra - realized that the trolls were losing against the &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; and their &lt;a href=\"cloud%20serpent\"&gt;cloud serpent&lt;/a&gt; riders, and decided to fulfill the ancient prophecy and resurrect Lei Shen. A pitched battle erupted at the Tomb of Conquerors, where the Thunder King's body was enshrined. The trolls' efforts to resurrect Lei Shen were thwarted, as &lt;a href=\"Jiang\"&gt;Jiang&lt;/a&gt; sacrificed herself to kill Mengazi, sending the Zandalari fleeing back to &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;.\nResurrection and fall.\nThe Zandalari along with the allied troll tribes rekindled their relationship with the mogu and found Emperor Lei Shen's body buried inside the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Conquerors\"&gt;Tomb of Conquerors&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Emperors\"&gt;Valley of Emperors&lt;/a&gt;, along with his army. The trolls took the body to the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Reckoning\"&gt;Isle of Reckoning&lt;/a&gt; and the Thunder King was resurrected by &lt;a href=\"Prophet%20Khar%27zul\"&gt;Prophet Khar'zul&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Thunder King returned to his &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;island stronghold&lt;/a&gt;. He gathered most of the mogu clans and the Zandalari to his &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;throne&lt;/a&gt;, forming a ruthless army capable of crushing Pandaria. He quickly encountered opposition, however, from the &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan%20Assault\"&gt;Shado-Pan Assault&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor%20Offensive\"&gt;Kirin Tor Offensive&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Sunreaver%20Onslaught\"&gt;Sunreaver Onslaught&lt;/a&gt;.\nLei Shen rewarded the most loyal and ambitious Zandalari trolls with power beyond their wildest dreams. The berserker &lt;a href=\"Jin%27rokh%20the%20Breaker\"&gt;Jin'rokh&lt;/a&gt; was one of the first to receive the King's blessing.\nAfter being resurrected by the Zandalari, &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Kao\"&gt;Warlord Kao&lt;/a&gt;\u2014one of Lei Shen's old lieutenants\u2014traveled to the Throne of Thunder to speak with the emperor. The Thunder King promised Kao that he could slay as many pandaren as he wished, decreeing that they were flawed creatures that should be eliminated so the mogu could create new, better servants in their place.\nThe Thunder King's allies and legions were eventually defeated, and adventurers of the Alliance and Horde laid siege to his stronghold. In front of the gate to the palace, Lei Shen appeared, summoned a storm and collapsed the entrance bridge along with the adventurers. Fighting through the caves and depths, they eventually fought through the citadel, and Lei Shen himself was slain at the &lt;a href=\"Pinnacle%20of%20Storms%20%28subzone%29\"&gt;Pinnacle of Storms&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; had what remained of his power drained into the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Antonidas\"&gt;Staff of Antonidas&lt;/a&gt;, transforming it into the &lt;a href=\"Storm-Stave%20of%20Antonidas\"&gt;Storm-Stave of Antonidas&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20the%20Thunder%20King\"&gt;Heart of the Thunder King&lt;/a&gt; was brought to &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt;, who wanted to know how and why the mogu came to be. Wrathion ultimately ate the heart to prevent Lei Shen from ever being resurrected again. Without a central leader, the surviving mogu dispersed.\nThe Zandalari &lt;a href=\"Prophet%20Zul\"&gt;Prophet Zul&lt;/a&gt; would later go on to use what he learned from Lei Shen's revival to revive &lt;a href=\"Dazar\"&gt;Dazar&lt;/a&gt;, the first king of the Zandalari.\nPersonality.\nA cruel and tyrannical despot, Lei Shen was perhaps best characterized by his extreme selfishness and pride. He saw himself as a god, and the rightful ruler of Pandaria. He honestly believed that he was continuing the work of the &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt;s, and that the &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; could only find meaning and purpose when united under a single emperor, namely himself, as they had once been united under the rule of their &lt;a href=\"Ra\"&gt;ancient master&lt;/a&gt;. In the Thunder King's own words, he . Unlike others of his generation, he spoke of more than conquest. The legends of his forefathers were etched into his heart. When Lei Shen first rose to power, young and proud, he saw the ruined works of his forefathers scattered across the war-torn landscape and lived with a profound sense that his people were not living up to their purpose or potential. The titans no longer spoke, and so Lei Shen took it upon himself to speak in their place. After he returned from the &lt;a href=\"Thundering%20Mountain\"&gt;Thundering Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, armed with the powers of &lt;a href=\"Ra\"&gt;Ra-den&lt;/a&gt;, many mogu saw in Lei Shen the unity of purpose that had been lacking in the generations since their masters had fallen silent. They flocked around the Thunder King's banner. They eagerly did his bidding as he enslaved the other races, believing - as Lei Shen did - that the \"lesser\" races should serve the mogu, just as the mogu had once served their masters. The Thunder King considered the subsequent suffering of the other races a small price to pay \u2014 a mere weakness of the flesh.\nThe values held by Lei Shen is best exemplified through the &lt;a href=\"Edict%20of%20the%20Thunder%20King\"&gt;royal edicts&lt;/a&gt; placed around the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Isle of Thunder&lt;/a&gt;: that to be mogu is to rule, and that it is the mogu's birthright to rule &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;. Those who do not bend to the mogu's will must be broken by their strength. The Thunder King believed that there is no strength without unity, that there is no unity without obedience, and that obedience to the emperor and demanding obedience of the lesser races is the natural way of things; that there is an order to the world best expressed through the strength flowing from the emperor down to the very stones of the earth. In his own words: \"When you fight amongst yourselves you fight against your very nature.\"\nAn indication of Lei Shen's immense pride was that, as the adventurers who assaulted his throne chamber proved likely to triumph, the Thunder King in complete shock and terror denounced them as unworthy and proclaimed his vaunted title as the reason, at a complete loss to the fact that he was going to lose to 'lesser races'.\nEquipment.\nEmperor Lei Shen wielded a spear, an axe and wore a helm into every battle. They were the finest works of &lt;a href=\"Forgemaster%20Deng\"&gt;Forgemaster Deng&lt;/a&gt;, who worked and personally oversaw the great &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Forge\"&gt;Thunder Forge&lt;/a&gt;. The Forgemaster crafted and especially gifted the set to Lei Shen just before the master blacksmith's death. His helm became so well-known that his enemies would flee at the mere sight of it, and his spear murdered thousands of innocents. It is said that he could throw his axe with brutal accuracy, and when it hit its target it made a sound like crashing thunder. When the emperor died, the mogu placed his helm in the very bottom of the &lt;a href=\"Guo-Lai%20Halls\"&gt;Guo-Lai Halls&lt;/a&gt;, surrounded by thousands of terracotta soldiers. Thus, they could look upon their leader and follow him into death.\nIn \"Hearthstone\".\nLei Shen appears as an for the shaman class. His name is never mentioned in-game; instead, he is referred to only as \"The Thunder King\". His flavor text reads: \"The Thunder King uses the power of storms to terrify his enemies... and their house pets.\"\nPurchasing the Thunder King also unlocks the \"Stolen Thunder\" , whose flavor text reads: \"\"The hardest part of &lt;a href=\"Ra\"&gt;stealing thunder&lt;/a&gt; is getting away with it quietly.\"\"\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

Dictator. Conqueror. Emperor. These titles of the Thunder King were earned by bringing absolute misery to every race of Pandaria. Resurrected into a world where his people no longer rule, Lei Shen is bent on ending the farce and bringing the land under his heel once more.\"\nEncounter design.\n\"The core concept for the Lei Shen fight developed during a brainstorming session as members of the encounter design team were throwing around ideas for potential fight mechanics, trying to see if anything would stick. A popular idea was for him to need to pause and recharge periodically, but someone suggested an interesting twist on that idea\u2014the Thunder King isn't just a battery that needs to recharge; he's actually a power source himself. So instead of him drawing power from his citadel, the citadel draws power from him. He is a mighty warrior in his own right, with distinctive weapon and lightning attacks, but his mere presence energizes and activates portions of his citadel\u2019s defenses, and managing those becomes a central element of the encounter. With a wide array of incredible visuals provided by our effects artists, and an awesome dungeon backdrop (those walls aren't entirely decorative...), Lei Shen is an epic final encounter to wrap up an epic raid zone.\"\nSpells and abilities.\nThe Thunder King will go &lt;a href=\"Enrage%20%28mechanic%29\"&gt;Berserk&lt;/a&gt; after 12 minutes, or 15 minutes in Raid Finder mode.\nStage One: Thunderstruck!\nLei Shen equips his Axe, Thunder, which he can throw with deadly accuracy and cause lightning to strike the ground wherever it lands. Lei Shen will charge any Conduit that he is near.\nIntermission: Supercharge Conduits!\nAt 65% health, Lei Shen casts Supercharge Conduits, becoming invulnerable and activating all four Conduits at once, supercharging them and increasing their level by one. Lei Shen can only maintain Supercharge Conduits for 45 seconds.\nStage Two: Lightning Will End You!\nLei Shen equips his Polearm, Lightning, allowing him to call lightning from the sky. Lei Shen will charge any Conduit that he is near.\nIntermission: Supercharge Conduits!\nAt 30% health, Lei Shen casts Supercharge Conduits, becoming invulnerable and activating all four Conduits at once, supercharging them and increasing their level by one. Lei Shen can only maintain Supercharge Conduits for 45 seconds.\nStage Three: The Final Countdown!\nLei Shen equips both his Axe and Polearm, wielding Thunder and Lightning in unision against his enemies. Lei Shen casts Overwhelming Power and consumes all electricity from the Throne of Thunder, destroying any remaining functional Conduits, preventing their further activation.\nStrategy.\nBefore starting the encounter, the raid must split in to four groups in order to handle the intermissions. Ideally, the raid should split as evenly as possible (6/6/6/7 or 2/2/2/2). In 25-player raids, a healer should be in each corner. In 10-player, have a healer between two corners, hopefully in range of both sets of players. It helps to use &lt;a href=\"World%20Marker\"&gt;world markers&lt;/a&gt; to identify each corner, as they all look the same during the frenzy of combat.\nStage one.\nStart the encounter by having the tanks charge at Lei Shen from the center of the platform, with the rest of the group following behind, though not stacked on top of one another. Save Bloodlust/Heroism/Time Warp for stage three.\nDuring this stage, no matter where Lei Shen is in the room, he has several abilities: While not charging a conduit, he will Discharge the room, ticking increasing amounts of damage to every player on the platform while he is between conduits. The tanks need to be aware of Decapitate and tank swap after each cast. The rest of the raid needs to be aware of Thunderstruck, a ground-targeted area of effect ability that does less damage the further players are away from the point of impact, and Lightning Crash, which summons a pool of lightning on the ground for 45 seconds.\nWhile Lei Shen is tanked within a few yards of a conduit, he will charge it. This charging is shown by the conduit's power bar, and if the bar fills up, the conduit gains a level and the ability it grants Lei Shen will do more damage and affect more players. Thus, the tanks must move Lei Shen from corner to corner to keep conduits from gaining levels prematurely. Lei Shen is tauntable, so to move him quickly, have the (current) off-tank run toward the next conduit and taunt him from range. Tanks should also be aware of the relative charge levels of each conduit, as in Raid Finder and Normal difficulties, the conduit with the highest charge will be disabled for the rest of the encounter at the end of each intermission. Heroic mode reverses this, as the conduit instead grants Lei Shen its' ability for the remainder of the encounter.\nEach quadrant of the room brings a different ability in to play: the north conduit has Static Shock, zapping one player and dealing a huge amount of damage that needs to be split by players stacking on top of the afflicted player. The east conduit has Diffusion Chain, which acts much like &lt;a href=\"Chain%20Lightning\"&gt;Chain Lightning&lt;/a&gt;, but will spawn an add for each player that gets hit by the chain. The south conduit has Overcharge, which roots a player in place and will damage and stun players not within a few yards of the target. Finally, the west conduit has Bouncing Bolt: Lei Shen will launch several bolts that target random locations on the ground (denoted by swirling clouds). Players must stand where the bolt lands and absorb the damage, or the bolt will summon an add and bounce again, repeating until it hits a player.\nDamage Lei Shen to 65% health and he will end stage one and start the intermission.\nIntermission.\nDuring the intermission, Lei Shen will become immune to all damage and run to the center of the room. At this point, the raid must split into the four corners and prepare to handle the conduit abilities. All four conduits are active in this stage, so Lei Shen could cast each of the four abilities on any corner of the room. So, stay spread out by default to limit spawns caused by the Diffusion Chain, and to quickly get to the location of the Bouncing Bolt to keep it's Unharnessed Power adds from spawning, but collapse on players targeted with Static Shock and Overcharge. At best, only a single Diffused Lightning add will spawn whenever Lei Shen casts Diffusion Chain, and those elementals are quickly focused down.\nThe intermission lasts 45 seconds, and at the end of the intermission, the conduit with the highest power level will overload, disabling it and flooding that quadrant of the room with lightning that deals damage to players standing in it.\nStage two.\nIn this stage, Lei Shen retains Discharge and the remaining active-conduit abilities, but no longer casts Decapitate, Thunderstruck, or Lightning Crash. Tanks must swap after getting hit by Fusion Slash. He will Summon Ball Lightning at the feet of random members of the raid. Stay spread out, then after he summons the ball lightning, have the raid collapse on Lei Shen so the balls are all collected at one spot and can be quickly taken out with AoE damage. He will also crack his Lightning Whip across the floor, inflicting likely-fatal amounts of damage to any player hit by it. If players are stuck on the wrong side of the whip during a conduit transition, they can jump over the lightning graphic on the ground to avoid damage.\nIn non-Heroic mode, only three conduits remain active, so be aware of which direction Lei Shen is taken around the platform. Lei Shen will end this stage when he reaches 30% health remaining, starting another intermission. In Heroic mode, whichever conduit had the most power will grant that ability to Lei Shen no matter his position in the room.\nIntermission redux.\nMuch the same as the first intermission, but this time the group whose conduit has been deactivated should split up evenly, spreading out to the remaining three groups. This intermission also lasts 45 seconds.\nFinal stage.\nLei Shen ends the intermission and starts this final stage by casting Overwhelming Power, destroying the remaining conduits. Lei Shen can be tanked wherever the raid pleases, but should be in the middle of the two non-charged quadrants, as he gains a new ability: Violent Gale Winds, which will push players about the room in a random direction, potentially off the platform, into a lightning whip, or into one of the charged quadrants. He also retains Thunderstruck, Summon Ball Lightning, and Lightning Whip from previous stages. Continue to collapse on Lei Shen after the ball lightning, and run away from the thunderstruck and lightning whip areas of effect.\nThis is the time to use Bloodlust/Heroism/Time Warp. Violent Gale Winds acts as a soft enrage, but Lei Shen will go berserk after a while.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

When fighting suddenly broke out in this peaceful place, Lei Shi saw the crystal-clear water turn cloudy and murky, and terror fell over her mind.\"\nStrategy.\nPosition the raid in a triangle, with one tank on one corner, the second tank on another corner and the remainder of the raid on the third corner (similar to the positioning for Phase 2 of &lt;a href=\"Beth%27tilac\"&gt;Beth'tilac&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Firelands\"&gt;Firelands&lt;/a&gt;). The aim of this positioning is to have only the active tank affected by Spray. The two tanks will regularly need to taunt off each other to prevent Spray from stacking too high.\nWhen Lei Shi casts Protect (at 80%, 60%, 40% and 20%), perform a tank switch, and have the off-tank pick up the s (Lei Shi continues to cast Spray while the Protectors are up). The raid leader should mark one Protector to be focused down, and any remaining Protectors can be crowd controlled to reduce damage. The raid must aim to kill the marked Protector before the main tank has too many stacks of Spray (the off-tank can not taunt the boss at this time as the damage from the Protectors and the boss's Spray will be too intense).\nWhen Lei Shi casts Get Away, the raid must move forward towards the boss while attempting to take 4% health off (which will stop the channel). Raid members who do not move forward will take increased damage; however, any abilities with a cast time cannot be used while moving forward (unless class-specific abilities that allow this are used). Both defensive and offensive cooldowns should be used in order to survive more easily and end the Get Away cast as quickly as possible.\nWhen Lei Shi casts Hide, DPS needs to spread out and find her. A player close enough to Lei Shi's location will see visual clues as to her whereabouts (clouds, sparks, water splashes, etc.). Once found, players need to spam AoE abilities in this location to break Hide.\nSpray is not cast during Get Away and Hide phases.\nThe encounter has a strict enrage timer, so Lei Shi's abilities that make her unattackable (Protect, Get Away, Hide) need to be dealt with swiftly. This encounter can be considered to be the raid instance's &lt;a href=\"gear%20check\"&gt;gear check&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Bloodlust\"&gt;Bloodlust&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Heroism\"&gt;Heroism&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Time%20Warp\"&gt;Time Warp&lt;/a&gt; should be popped after the Protector wave at 20% is dealt with. Lei Shi gains 8% haste for every 10% damage dealt to her (which makes Spray more and more problematic), so the last 20% needs to be burned as quickly as possible.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

His first appearance was in \"&lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DTaBYjVBY_bM\"&gt;Wish You Were Here&lt;/a&gt;\", a trailer advertising the level 90 &lt;a href=\"Character%20Boost\"&gt;Character Boost&lt;/a&gt;. In it, Lemmy is stranded in the &lt;a href=\"Tanaris\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt; desert. He receives a letter from his friends inviting him to &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt;s, but the gnome becomes saddened when he realizes that the raids require him to be level 90, and he is currently only level 61. However, he then sees another letter offering a level 90 character boost. Lemmy signs his name and boosts to level 90, gaining new armor (and a new mustache) and is transported to the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; in the process.\nHis second appearance was in \"&lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DRmfd_kDsgqQ\"&gt;Lemmy the Gnome in \u201cGnomo-plasty\u201d!&lt;/a&gt;\", a video showcasing the &lt;a href=\"player%20character%20revamp\"&gt;player character revamp&lt;/a&gt;. It features Lemmy running around &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt; gathering flowers, until he is suddenly transported to a mysterious white room where he is tied to a table. A &lt;a href=\"Chris%20Robinson\"&gt;huge, mysterious being&lt;/a&gt; performs a painful operation on the gnome, transforming him into a new, higher-quality version of himself (with a mustache to boot). Lemmy is then violently thrown back to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, where a female &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; sneaks up behind him. Before the tauren can ambush the gnome, however, she too is transported into the mysterious room.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DTCfLn-OgR4g\"&gt;100 or Bust!&lt;/a&gt;\", it's revealed that Lemmy's arch enemy, the nefarious level 62 &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Krazzel%20Crashfuse\"&gt;Krazzel Crashfuse&lt;/a&gt;, spied on the gnome when he was first using the level 90 boost. After several failed attempts by Krazzel to reach level 100, the goblin's &lt;a href=\"hozen\"&gt;hozen&lt;/a&gt; assistant, &lt;a href=\"Renfield\"&gt;Renfield&lt;/a&gt;, uses a level 100 character boost for himself, landing on top of Lemmy while he and his raid are progressing through .\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DhvDMTSJi5l8\"&gt;Meet Mischief \u2014 The New Warcraft Pet&lt;/a&gt;\", Lemmy is seen leaving a &lt;a href=\"Feast%20of%20Winter%20Veil\"&gt;Feast of Winter Veil&lt;/a&gt; gift on Krazzel's doorstep just before the goblin manages to use an anti-gift ray to destroy all of the Winter Veil presents in the village below his tower. When Krazzel throws open the door, Lemmy is gone, but as the goblin opens the gift he finds the fel kitten &lt;a href=\"Mischief\"&gt;Mischief&lt;/a&gt; inside. Shortly after, however, Krazzel and Mischief are forced to leave the lab in a hurry in an escape pod as the goblin's anti-gift ray is about to activate, though whether or not Lemmy was aware of this is unclear."}

The mok'nathal are very pacifistic, but Rexxar \u2014 against the wishes of his father \u2014 joined the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; believing that there was nothing left for him among his people. For his actions, Leoroxx disowned him, and for thirty years his mind has remained stubbornly set against his son, even after Rexxar returned to &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 now &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 to search for what remained of his people. Leoroxx has a &lt;a href=\"companion\"&gt;companion&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"lynx\"&gt;lynx&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Tethik\"&gt;Tethik&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nDraenor.\nAfter battles with the &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20clan\"&gt;Warsong clan&lt;/a&gt; and the rebellion of the &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Hand%20clan\"&gt;Shattered Hand clan&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Gorian%20Empire\"&gt;Gorian Empire&lt;/a&gt; was losing power on &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; and their hold on &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt; was broken forever. &lt;a href=\"Imperator%20Kelgrok\"&gt;Imperator Kelgrok&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Bladespire%20clan\"&gt;Bladespire clan&lt;/a&gt; was greatly troubled by these events and determined to keep his hold on &lt;a href=\"Frostfire%20Ridge\"&gt;Frostfire Ridge&lt;/a&gt;. He did not only mean to keep defenses up, but to expand. To make up for the ogres' low numbers, Bladespire sorcerers had conducted cruel experiments to create new creatures that could be used as labor, and the greatest result came from selective breeding between ogres and enslaved orcs. The children of these forced unions were called &lt;a href=\"mok%27nathal\"&gt;mok'nathal&lt;/a&gt;, possessing the strength of ogres and intelligence of orcs. The Bladespire kept the mok'nathal in chains and bred them together to create even more. To ensure their loyalty, the ogres threatened to kill entire families if even one of the members rebelled.\nImperator Kelgrok unshackled many of these mok'nathal and ordered them to make war on the orcs of Frostfire Ridge. The mok'nathal formed the bulk of the Bladespire army that rampaged across Frostfire, seizing many tracts of resource-rich land. Chieftain &lt;a href=\"Garad\"&gt;Garad&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20clan\"&gt;Frostwolf clan&lt;/a&gt; called upon the &lt;a href=\"Whiteclaw%20clan\"&gt;Whiteclaw&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thunderlord%20clan\"&gt;Thunderlord&lt;/a&gt; clans that lived nearby to unite, but the Thunderlords - led by Garad's estranged son &lt;a href=\"Fenris%20Wolfbrother\"&gt;Fenris Wolfbrother&lt;/a&gt; - rejected the offer. Thunderlord orcs raided Bladespire settlements alone in the dead of night, slaughtering young and old alike. In the meantime, the united Frostwolf and Whiteclaw army fought the Bladespire and managed to capture a number of mok'nathal, including their elder Leoroxx.\nGarad was surprised to learn that Leoroxx and the other mok'nathal were not willing servants but slaves. Garad and Leoroxx came to an agreement to help each other destroy the Bladespire clan forever. Leoroxx returned to &lt;a href=\"Bladespire%20Hold\"&gt;Bladespire Hold&lt;/a&gt; and incited open rebellion among the mok'nathal. They rose up against their oppressors and set fire to the stronghold as the Frostwolves and Whiteclaws crashed into Bladespire's outer defenses. The &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Bladespire\"&gt;Battle of Bladespire&lt;/a&gt; dragged on for a full bloody day before the orcs and mok'nathal drove the ogres out. In the heart of the fortress, Leoroxx strangled Imperator Kelgrok with the chains he had worn for so much of his life.\nThe orcs and mok'nathal had won, but at the cost of many lives including Garad's son &lt;a href=\"Ga%27nar\"&gt;Ga'nar&lt;/a&gt;, who had sacrificed himself to let many young mok'nathal escape. Afterward, Garad offered Leoroxx and his people land in Frostfire, but Leoroxx declined because he knew the half-breeds would never truly be accepted by the orcs. The mok'nathal settled in a remote corner of &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Gorgrond&lt;/a&gt;. Resources were scarce, but they were able to live in peace. They swore off fighting, only taking up arms to defend their meager lands from threats.\nBelieving that the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; could help the mok'nathal find water and food Leoroxx's son Rexxar would join the organization, a move that angered Leoroxx.\nOutland.\nThough he rejected the Old Horde, Leoroxx was willing to work with the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;New Horde&lt;/a&gt;. He first tasked Horde &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s with proving their worth by slaying &lt;a href=\"Vekh\"&gt;Vekh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gnosh%20Brognat\"&gt;Gnosh Brognat&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Dreadwing\"&gt;Dreadwing&lt;/a&gt;. Leoroxx congratulated them and remarked that slaying the chiefs of the three greatest threats the mok'nathal faced was something to be proud of.\nLater, Leoroxx learned that &lt;a href=\"Nexus-Prince%20Razaan\"&gt;Nexus-Prince Razaan&lt;/a&gt; was running an operation in the &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Blade's Edge Mountains&lt;/a&gt; consisting of a collection of souls. Upon learning that mok'nathal spirits were involved as well, a furious Leoroxx asked adventurers to slay the Nexus-Prince and deliver the stolen souls to &lt;a href=\"Spiritcaller%20Dohgar\"&gt;Spiritcaller Dohgar&lt;/a&gt; in order to properly lay them to rest.\nDragonflight.\nLeoroxx was greatly surprised when &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; invited the &lt;a href=\"mok%27nathal\"&gt;mok'nathal&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Kosh%27harg\"&gt;Kosh'harg&lt;/a&gt; festival held on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Razor%20Hill\"&gt;Razor Hill&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;. After his arrival, he reflected on how the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt; considered them half-breeds, lesser than true orcs. Seeing how times have changed, Leoroxx decided that the time had come to reconnect with his son, which he did so during the feast celebrating orc champions for completing the &lt;a href=\"om%27gora\"&gt;om'gora&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuotes.\nOur enemies surround us. I would have a better life for the Mok'Nathal, but the forces we are at battle with have chosen otherwise for us.\nIf you would prove yourself worthy to the Mok'Nathal, aid us in their elimination."}

Three of them died in the vigourous, exhausting training. Another, a prodigy known as &lt;a href=\"Varedis%20Felsoul\"&gt;Varedis Felsoul&lt;/a&gt;, succeeded and now trains more demon hunters at the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt;. The fifth one, Leotheras, went insane from the training and was exiled to &lt;a href=\"Zangarmarsh\"&gt;Zangarmarsh&lt;/a&gt;, where he found his way into the lair of &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Vashj\"&gt;Lady Vashj&lt;/a&gt;. He probably found his way in and in his madness, started wreaking havoc. Judging by the three &lt;a href=\"Greyheart%20Spellbinder\"&gt;Greyheart Spellbinder&lt;/a&gt;s that keep him &lt;a href=\"banish\"&gt;banish&lt;/a&gt;ed, Lady Vashj's minions sucessfully subdued him and are now keeping him imprisoned.\nAbilities.\nHumanoid Form Abilities.\nMelee: 2500-3000 on plate\nWhirlwind:\nDemon Form Abilities.\nChaos Blast : Leotheras' only attack in this phase, centered on his current target.\nInner Demon.\nAbout 25 sec into the Demon Form phase, Leotheras summons &lt;a href=\"Inner%20Demon%20%28Serpentshrine%20Cavern%29\"&gt;Inner Demon&lt;/a&gt;s for up to five raid members (never for the person with aggro). The inner demons can only be attacked by the person to whom they belong. If Leotheras returns to humanoid form while an Inner Demon is still alive, that person becomes Mind Controlled for 10 minutes (non-removable). Pet classes must make sure their pet does not get the killing blow, the Mind Control is only prevented if the player deals the death blow.\nInner Demon capabilities:\nStrategy.\nHumanoid Form.\nWhirlwind.\nDuring a Whirlwind, Leotheras targets his victim. If that person runs away fast and far enough, he will deaggro and whirl towards someone else. It is possible to have ALL raid members avoid being hit. If people are hit by Whirlwind, they must be healed. The DoT part can only be removed with &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Shield\"&gt;Divine Shield&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blessing%20of%20Protection\"&gt;Blessing of Protection&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Block\"&gt;Ice Block&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Stoneform\"&gt;Stoneform&lt;/a&gt; no longer removes it).\nThe aggro wipe can be overcome with a hunters &lt;a href=\"Misdirection\"&gt;Misdirection&lt;/a&gt;. Other tricks include having someone place &lt;a href=\"Gnomish%20Flame%20Turret\"&gt;Gnomish Flame Turret&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Searing%20Totem\"&gt;Searing Totem&lt;/a&gt; on the tanking spot (Leotheras will aggro this, allowing the MT to get aggro back easily). Bleeds or any other tank DoTs also help them gain aggro immediately when they tick after the aggro wipe. Having a Paladin main tank this encounter is also a good idea because he doesn't have to chase down Leotheras, but can simply throw an Avenger's Shield. Like most raid bosses, Leotheras is immune to taunt.\nDemon Form.\nIt's a frequently used tactic to have a demo specced warlock with &lt;a href=\"felhunter\"&gt;felhunter&lt;/a&gt; and high &lt;a href=\"fire%20resistance\"&gt;fire resistance&lt;/a&gt; tank this encounter. Nonetheless, it's also possible to tank him conventionally. A combination also works - a normal tank taking the first few attacks can help the warlock tank survive the entire phase.\nTips for warrior tanks.\nYou need to have about 365 &lt;a href=\"fire%20resistance\"&gt;fire resistance&lt;/a&gt; and about 18K health raid buffed. &lt;a href=\"Flask%20of%20Chromatic%20Wonder\"&gt;Flasks of Chromatic Wonder&lt;/a&gt; are great for this. Tank him at the edge of his hitbox to protect melee DPS from being hit by the Chaos Blast splash.\nThe incoming damage will go from zero (no debuffs) to most of your health bar, but if healers are on the ball you should be able to go up to about 12-14 debuffs before being instagibbed. Thunderclap seems to reduce the frequency of attacks which will make you survive longer.\nThreat will probably be a problem, especially when you're not taking damage, so using Mighty Rage Potions is a very good idea and will allow your raid to squeeze out more DPS. High stamina DPS gear will also help assuming you can reach the maximum &lt;a href=\"fire%20resistance\"&gt;fire resistance&lt;/a&gt;, and use &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Shout\"&gt;Battle Shout&lt;/a&gt; until you have about 4 debuffs then switch to &lt;a href=\"Commanding%20Shout\"&gt;Commanding Shout&lt;/a&gt;.\nAsk a friendly &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt; to cast &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Intervention\"&gt;Divine Intervention&lt;/a&gt; on you during the last 15% if your debuffs stack too high, as this will remove them. Ideally do this when you have a full rage bar to allow you to get him back off healers, and click it off quickly before people start dying.\nInner Demon.\nWhenever a player has to deal with an inner demon, he should be healed by the non-affected healers, even if self healing-capable. DPS classes should find this encounter rather easy. For some classes a few hints may help:\nSplit Phase.\nAt 15% health, Leotheras' Demon Form splits from his Humanoid Form, and both forms must be handled together. The Demon Form starts with 100% health, while the Humanoid Form retains its current health. The Humanoid Form abilities are the same as before. The Demon Form still uses Chaos Blast, but no longer spawns the Inner Demons. Upon defeating the Humanoid Form, the Demon Form despawns.\nNotes.\nAs of 2007-08-02, Inner Demons are bugged, and if a player's pet lands the killing blow on the demon, the player will still be mind controlled. \nSoloing Leotheras the Blind.\nThis boss is not an easy one to defeat. You cannot just rush in and try to burn him without any tactics.\nSolo as a Death Knight\nThe easiest spec to solo him in is Blood, provided you have the appropriate gear. I would recommend having over 160k hp in Blood Presence. The Chaos Blasts are ultimately quite survivable with judicious use of cooldowns, and made almost trivial with the use of &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20of%20Broken%20Images\"&gt;Mirror of Broken Images&lt;/a&gt;. The most effective cooldown usage I found was as follows:\nMake sure diseases are up when he enters the demon phase, and reapply with Outbreak. This will slow the accumulation of stacks.\nUse &lt;a href=\"Rune%20Tap\"&gt;Rune Tap&lt;/a&gt; as soon as your health dips below 140k or so. &lt;a href=\"Will%20of%20the%20Necropolis\"&gt;Will of the Necropolis&lt;/a&gt; should pop near the end of the phase to keep you alive.\nLeotheras will cast Insidious Whispers around the middle of the phase. At this point I use &lt;a href=\"Anti-Magic%20Shell\"&gt;Anti-Magic Shell&lt;/a&gt; to give you six seconds of the buff not accumulating. When that runs out, wait until around 15 stacks and then use &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20of%20Broken%20Images\"&gt;Mirror of Broken Images&lt;/a&gt; if you have it. Also throw out &lt;a href=\"Vampiric%20Blood\"&gt;Vampiric Blood&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Shield\"&gt;Bone Shield&lt;/a&gt; at this point for a little extra survivability. Heal yourself with &lt;a href=\"Lichborne\"&gt;Lichborne&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Death%20Coil%20%28warlock%20ability%29\"&gt;Death Coil (warlock ability)&lt;/a&gt; as necessary, although I prefer to save that for the second Demon Phase so that it is up in time for Phase 3. \nUse &lt;a href=\"Icebound%20Fortitude\"&gt;Icebound Fortitude&lt;/a&gt; during the first Chaos Bolt phase, and it also should be up in time for Phase 3.\nIn the third Demon Phase, I like to use &lt;a href=\"Empower%20Rune%20Weapon\"&gt;Empower Rune Weapon&lt;/a&gt; to get a couple extra &lt;a href=\"Death%20Strike\"&gt;Death Strike&lt;/a&gt;s out.\nLeotheras is of no danger to you outside of the Demon Phase, and no Inner Demon will spawn. Use Phase 1 to heal yourself back to full, then rinse and repeat. As Leotheras is about to enter his 4th demon phase, he should be about to enter Phase 3. The KEY to the fight is to not push Leotheras past 15% until the debuff wears off and he starts to make the transition to the demon phase. If you can manage this, you'll enter Phase 3 with no stacks of the debuff and all your cooldowns up, at which point it's a relatively simple task to stay alive and burn him down.\nShould you lack the gear to kill him with Blood spec, this Unholy strat is also usable:\nUse Outbreak as much as possible to reapply diseases should they drop off instead of an &lt;a href=\"Icy%20Touch\"&gt;Icy Touch&lt;/a&gt; + &lt;a href=\"Plague%20Strike\"&gt;Plague Strike&lt;/a&gt; combo. This opens up a set of runes for &lt;a href=\"Death%20Strike\"&gt;Death Strike&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, use &lt;a href=\"Festering%20Strike\"&gt;Festering Strike&lt;/a&gt;s to change all blood and frost runes to death runes. This allows you to maximise your self healing with Death Strike. You should only use unholy runes for &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Transformation\"&gt;Dark Transformation&lt;/a&gt; or to reapply Blood Plague if &lt;a href=\"Outbreak\"&gt;Outbreak&lt;/a&gt; is on cooldown. \nFirstly, kill the 3 Spellbinders to free Leotheras. Ensure that you are at full health when his banishment ends. When Leotheras is in his Blood Elf Form, he will use Whirlwind. Run away from it to avoid some of damage. Your goal is to try to stay near full health as much as possible when he is in Blood Elf Form.\nAfter 60 seconds, Leotheras's inner demon will take control and will morph into Demon Form. Make sure you can use Dark Transformation on the ghoul as your ghoul will be tanking Leotheras through demon form. The reasoning behind this is due to the fact that Leotheras' Chaos Blasts will deal increasing damage to you and you will swiftly die. The moment he morphs into Demon Form, use Dark Transformation, cast Anti-Magic Shell, throw a few &lt;a href=\"Death%20Coil%20%28warlock%20ability%29\"&gt;Death Coil (warlock ability)&lt;/a&gt;s at Leotheras or at your ghoul to heal him and run far away. When you reach a sufficient distance, Leotheras will aggro your ghoul and you are free to bandage yourself. He will summon your Inner Demon to plague you too. Kill it quickly. When your diseases fall off, run back, reaply them with Outbreak, perhaps heal your ghoul with Death Coils and run back quickly. Do not stand there and take damage from Chaos Blasts.\nSometimes, if diseases are on him when he morphs into Demon Form, it can take some time for your ghoul to aggro him. Just keep kiting Leotheras around. If you are of sufficient distance, after he summons your Inner Demon, he will attack the ghoul.\nAfter 45 seconds, Leotheras will take control and revert to his Blood Elf form. He will alternate between Blood Elf form and Demon Form until you bring him to 15% health. When that happens, Leotheras will be unable to suppress his demon and it will emerge from his body. Use Dark Transformation and set your ghoul on the Shadow of Leotheras (his inner demon). Meanwhile, use Anti-Magic Shell, taunt Leotheras and kite him far away from the Shadow of Leotheras. At this point, kill him as fast as possible. However, do not be complacent as Leotheras himself can deal a lot of damage even at this last stage.\nHe drops 250 gold, 3 &lt;a href=\"Tier%205\"&gt;Tier 5&lt;/a&gt; tokens and 1 epic item."}

Due to their exposure to the poisons and radiation of Gnomeregan, eventually, they may devolve further until they become mindless but mostly harmless &lt;a href=\"Ooze\"&gt;puddles&lt;/a&gt; of toxic sludge.\nBoth &lt;a href=\"Razzle%20Sprysprocket\"&gt;Razzle Sprysprocket&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ozzie%20Togglevolt\"&gt;Ozzie Togglevolt&lt;/a&gt; are trying to find a cure for leper gnomes, and if they manage to do so then gnomes will have both their capital back and the recently cured leper gnomes.\nHistory.\nAfter the betrayal of &lt;a href=\"Sicco%20Thermaplugg\"&gt;Sicco Thermaplugg&lt;/a&gt; and the radiation of &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, 80% of the gnome population was killed while others were mutated into leper gnomes and driven mad, and remained living in Gnomeregan for some time. They were easily recruited by the jealous Sicco, who himself had been twisted into a leper gnome and rendered insane.\nForced to flee to the safety of the dwarven capital of &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gelbin%20Mekkatorque\"&gt;Gelbin Mekkatorque&lt;/a&gt; had to deal with the guilt of his actions that day, actions brought on by his chief advisor's lust for power.\nLocations.\nLeper gnomes are found almost exclusively in Gnomeregan, the doomed capital of the gnomes. There are also many leper gnomes at the &lt;a href=\"Steamvault\"&gt;Steamvault&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Coilfang%20Reservoir\"&gt;Coilfang Reservoir&lt;/a&gt; allied to Illidan and his naga. There is an apparent leper gnome (he can also be undead gnome, lacking unique model) named &lt;a href=\"Ganoosh\"&gt;Ganoosh&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;, another named &lt;a href=\"Haggle\"&gt;Haggle&lt;/a&gt; sifting through the trash in the &lt;a href=\"Deeprun%20Tram\"&gt;Deeprun Tram&lt;/a&gt; and several leper gnome laborers (possibly slaves) in the cellar of a &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elf&lt;/a&gt; clothier guarded by a level 60 succubus in &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt;. Note that all NPCs that use leper gnome models may not necessarily be leper gnomes. The model may be used to represent other types of sickly or undead gnome forms.\nLeper gnomes can be found in mass on the eastern shores of &lt;a href=\"Uldum\"&gt;Uldum&lt;/a&gt;, but not through disease or radiation, these gnomes instead succumbed to an ancient curse that robbed them of their sanity. As with the other cases, it is not known if these are truly leper gnomes or if it's just their model being used to represent a cursed form.\nForsaken leper gnomes or undead gnomes.\nSeveral in-game characters &lt;a href=\"Ganoosh\"&gt;Ganoosh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Apprentice%20Crispin\"&gt;Apprentice Crispin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jennings\"&gt;Jennings&lt;/a&gt; work with the Forsaken, but it's unclear if they are leper gnomes or possibly &lt;a href=\"undead%20gnome\"&gt;undead gnome&lt;/a&gt;s. They all seem to be part of the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Apothecary%20Society\"&gt;Royal Apothecary Society&lt;/a&gt;; at least, on an assistant or secretarial level. They have not been seen to hold much authority.\nForsaken &lt;a href=\"Apothecary%20Jerrod\"&gt;Apothecary Jerrod&lt;/a&gt; says about his assistant Apprentice Crispin: \"Sure, he's not been plagued in the same manner as we have, but he is clearly plagued nonetheless\". This could imply a leper gnome is like an undead plagued in a different manner.\nAs a companion pet.\n&lt;a href=\"Rotten%20Helper%20Box\"&gt;Rotten Helper Box&lt;/a&gt; has a chance to be contained in &lt;a href=\"Stolen%20Present\"&gt;Stolen Present&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Feast%20of%20Winter%20Veil\"&gt;Feast of Winter Veil&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nWhen Gnomeregan was invaded by a horde of troggs unearthed from the &lt;a href=\"Uldaman\"&gt;Uldaman&lt;/a&gt; excavation, &lt;a href=\"Gelbin%20Mekkatorque\"&gt;High Tinker Gelbin Mekkatorque&lt;/a&gt; ordered the opening the pressure valves of their giant, grinding machines and released toxic radiation (via an exploded radiation bomb). Many more gnomes were killed than troggs when Gnomeregan was flooded with radiation.\nEven worse, though, many gnomes still within &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt;'s halls became horribly mutated and insane, changing into what are now known as leper gnomes. Leper gnomes vaguely resemble normal gnomes. Emaciated and sickly, their skin is bloated and green with gangrene, while their eyes glow with a color and light similar to that of the radioactive pools in their once beautiful city. Even worse than their physical mutation, though, is the perverse madness caused by the poisoning that twisted their bodies. While individuals among them may seem saner than others, all are irrevocably twisted. Leper gnomes claim Gnomeregan as their own, and, led by &lt;a href=\"Mekgineer%20Thermaplugg\"&gt;Mekgineer Thermaplugg&lt;/a&gt;, defend its halls with horrible constructs and their own prowess. They continue their battle against the troggs, who are more dangerous now due to the radioactive goo that clings to their rock-like skin. Perhaps the worst enemies in their minds, are true gnomes, whom they blame for their current existence. They regard High Tinker Mekkatorque as a &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;, and his followers not much better. They regard all other creatures as intruders and quickly put them down. Recently, however, some adventurers have seen leper gnomes in company with &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt;. Many theorize that Thermaplugg is attempting an alliance between the two underground races, in an attempt to strengthen his own forces and finally defeat the troggs.\nLanguages.\nLeper gnomes speak Gnomish and Common. Leper gnomes learn the languages of the creatures with which they live and compete.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

She is the sister of &lt;a href=\"Thassarian\"&gt;Thassarian&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nDeath Knight.\nBefore the outbreak of the Scourge, Leryssa was a farm girl living on her family's property in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, along with her brother &lt;a href=\"Thassarian\"&gt;Thassarian&lt;/a&gt;. Although they argued at times, the siblings had a good relationship. &lt;a href=\"William%20Allerton\"&gt;William Allerton&lt;/a&gt; had a crush on her, but she wasn't interested.\nWhen Arthas began destroying what remained of Lordaeron, she escaped to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; and opened or found a job in a clothing shop with an unknown female human. It was here where she received a letter sent from her brother, including the news that he had just enrolled in the Alliance army in Northrend. She decided to travel there to find out the truth. After General Arlos' and Counselor Talbot's disappointing news, she decided to go and wait in the inn. She didn't believe this news but didn't know what to do.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, Leryssa received word from William that her brother enlisted in &lt;a href=\"Valiance%20Keep\"&gt;Valiance Keep&lt;/a&gt; on the same day he did, even though he was supposed to have been dead for years. She sold everything she owned to come looking for Thassarian, and with the help of an Alliance adventurer, discovered that William was killed. The circumstances of his death were strange and Leryssa insisted on further investigation. Later both she and &lt;a href=\"General%20Arlos\"&gt;General Arlos&lt;/a&gt; were put under mind control by &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Valanar\"&gt;Prince Valanar&lt;/a&gt;, who was in fact &lt;a href=\"Counselor%20Talbot\"&gt;Counselor Talbot&lt;/a&gt;, and taken atop of &lt;a href=\"Naxxanar\"&gt;Naxxanar&lt;/a&gt;, where they were to be sacrificed to the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;. Thassarian and the adventurer then came and defeated Valanar, freeing Leryssa and Arlos. After she was freed, she bid her farewell to her brother, who promised her to return to her once his task is done, and returned to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuotes.\n&lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; was once a human prince. &lt;a href=\"1st%20Legion\"&gt;The army&lt;/a&gt; he led into &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; suffered a horrible fate.\nMy brother, &lt;a href=\"Thassarian\"&gt;Thassarian&lt;/a&gt;, was a part of that army.\nPost-event.\nI'll never forget what you did for Thassarian. I will always be in your debt.\nSpeculation.\nAfter Valanar is downed in &lt;a href=\"Last%20Rites\"&gt;Last Rites&lt;/a&gt;, Thassarian promises to return home with Leryssa. Early on in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Andorhal\"&gt;Battle for Andorhal&lt;/a&gt; quest chain in \"Cataclysm\", however, Thassarian mentions that he has \"no family\" and \"no friends\" left. While she may have indeed died, it is also possible that this is probably an oversight on Blizzard's part, as his friend and Horde counterpart &lt;a href=\"Koltira\"&gt;Koltira&lt;/a&gt; says the exact same thing in his respective quests."}

Searching his body, you find a letter to &lt;a href=\"Baros%20Alexston\"&gt;Baros Alexston&lt;/a&gt;. You know of him, the City Architect of Stormwind. It's a letter to him, you decide to deliver it. Why not?\nAlexston tells you some of how VanCleef ended up in hiding, seeking revenge against the nobles of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;. It turns out that he has some just cause behind him: The nobles stiffed the &lt;a href=\"Stonemasons\"&gt;Stonemasons&lt;/a&gt; guild after Stormwind was rebuilt. As leader of the guild, VanCleef refused the bribes the nobles offered him out of loyalty to the rest of the Stonemasons.\nVanCleef is dead, but the plans he had in motion are not. Alexston asks you to speak to VanCleef's lieutenant, &lt;a href=\"Bazil%20Thredd\"&gt;Bazil Thredd&lt;/a&gt;, currently held in the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Stockade%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Stormwind Stockade&lt;/a&gt;.\nFor that, you first have to talk to the &lt;a href=\"Warden%20Thelwater\"&gt;Warden Thelwater&lt;/a&gt;.\nYou get to the Stockade, and find the warden trying to manage a crisis. The inmates, it seems, are rioting. All the cell doors are open, and the guards are doing their best just to contain the situation.\n&lt;a href=\"Bazil%20Thredd\"&gt;Bazil Thredd&lt;/a&gt; has led the prisoners in this riot. The warden doesn't trust you, but sees any number of useful outcomes:\nSo... go in, he tells you. But bring back Bazil's head.\nYou go in. It's a real short conversation - Bazil and his prisoners attack you before you can get two words out. Defending yourself, you kill them. To satisfy the warden, you bring back his bloody trophy.\nThe warden is mollified by your actions, and tells you about a visitor that came to Bazil regularly in the last couple months, someone named Maelik. Warden Thelwater writes up a description of the visitor for you, that you bring back to Alexston.\nBaros has no idea who this person might be, but knows someone in that owes him a favor. He might be able to tell you more.\n&lt;a href=\"Master%20Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Master Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; of SI:7 reads the description and recognizes this 'Maelik' as an assassin, currently under the employ of &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Gregor%20Lescovar\"&gt;Lord Gregor Lescovar&lt;/a&gt; under the name &lt;a href=\"Marzon%20the%20Silent%20Blade\"&gt;Marzon&lt;/a&gt;.\nMaster Shaw mulls the situation over. Lescovar clearly has ties to the Defias, but you've killed the primary witnesses to that. Even without his being a noble, it would hard to convict him.\nMore help is needed, he decides. Somewhat reluctantly, he sends you to &lt;a href=\"Elling%20Trias\"&gt;Elling Trias&lt;/a&gt;, the \"Master of Cheese\" in the &lt;a href=\"Trias%20Cheese\"&gt;Trias Cheese&lt;/a&gt; shop.\nTrias listens to your tale, and agrees that any justice meted out in this affair will be by less than legal means. He tells you to talk to &lt;a href=\"Tyrion\"&gt;Tyrion&lt;/a&gt;, a gnome who has been keeping tabs on &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Gregor%20Lescovar\"&gt;Lescovar&lt;/a&gt; for the last few weeks.\nIt turns out that Tyrion had contingencies for something like this already planned, just ... not this soon. It seems that Trias and Tyrion suspected Lescovar of ties to &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;, but the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; is not a good sign either.\nHe's going to have to outfit his Spybot, so Tyrion asks you to get the remaining parts for the disguise: some silk, and a couple of apples. The silk, you can understand - a robe. The apples? Tyrion is an engineer, by definition not quite as sane as the rest of us. You leave the question unasked.\nYou return with the items, and &lt;a href=\"Tyrion\"&gt;Tyrion&lt;/a&gt; gives you a final briefing before he sends &lt;a href=\"Spybot\"&gt;Spybot&lt;/a&gt; in.\nWhile you were busy on your errand, he sent Marzon a message that Lescovar wanted to see him, and will be sending Spybot, disguised as a priestess (ah! apples!), to lure Lescovar out. If all goes well, Lescovar will come out, dismiss the guards, and have what he thinks is a private chat in the garden with his assassin. Your job: to listen to their conversation. If you catch wind of Defias talk, you are to kill them both before the guards return.\nThings go off pretty much as planned. You overhear their discussion; they do indeed talk about a Defias attack. They catch you listening in, and attempt (unsuccessfully) to 'silence' you.\nYou return to &lt;a href=\"Elling%20Trias\"&gt;Trias&lt;/a&gt; and report what took place. He thanks you, and has you report to &lt;a href=\"Master%20Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Shaw&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Gregor%20Lescovar\"&gt;Lescovar&lt;/a&gt; has been dealt with.\nShaw thanks you as well. And it seems &lt;a href=\"Baros%20Alexston\"&gt;Baros Alexston&lt;/a&gt; dropped by, saying he wanted a chat with you as well. Shaw advises you that when you talk to Alexston, you leave out the bit where it was you that killed Lescovar. ... and to try not to mention Trias at all - ever - if you can help it.\nTrias thought Shaw would send you to some noble or another for a commendation. It turns out that it is Alexston, instead...\nIn light of your recent deeds, Alexston asks you to deliver to the king a report he has prepared about the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;. He has no doubt that you will be commended for your deeds.\nUnfortunately, King &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; is away on a diplomatic mission, but Lady &lt;a href=\"Katrana%20Prestor\"&gt;Katrana Prestor&lt;/a&gt; lauds your successes in his place and gives you a princely gift."}

Recently, suspicious activity has started showing up in the Chasm in the form of &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Shaman\"&gt;Dark Shaman&lt;/a&gt;, obedient to an unknown force.\n&lt;a href=\"Ashra%20Valandril\"&gt;Ashra Valandril&lt;/a&gt; was present to take care of the bosses of this dungeon before the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Shaman\"&gt;Dark Shaman&lt;/a&gt; took over.\nHistory.\nBeneath the city of &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; lies this fiery chasm. A clan of &lt;a href=\"trogg\"&gt;trogg&lt;/a&gt;s known as &lt;a href=\"Ragefire%20Troggs\"&gt;Ragefire Troggs&lt;/a&gt; had begun to appear in the chasm, from deep below the lava-filled tunnels. &lt;a href=\"Magatha%20Grimtotem\"&gt;Magatha the Seer&lt;/a&gt;, of the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; people, attempted to make peace with these creatures, but was met only with hostility. It was clear that these &lt;a href=\"trogg\"&gt;trogg&lt;/a&gt;s were not interested in diplomacy, and could potentially overwhelm the entire &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; if left unchecked.\nA sect of the mysterious &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt; had also taken refuge in this chasm.

They cleared the presence of Searing Blade cultists and troggs and used the latter to feed the enslaved beasts they brought from the &lt;a href=\"Firelands\"&gt;Firelands&lt;/a&gt;. Although &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Warchief Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; recently called on a number of shaman to use the elements as weapons against the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, the chasm's current inhabitants appear to be renegades. Reports have surfaced that these shadowy figures are amassing a blistering army that could wreak havoc if unleashed upon Orgrimmar.\nAlliance players also receive quests, given by agents, who arrived via portal thinking that the horde is amassing an army down there which must be destroyed.\nLater, the &lt;a href=\"Gob%20Squad\"&gt;Gob Squad&lt;/a&gt;, investigating several abductions in Durotar, enters an abandoned section of Ragefire, called &lt;a href=\"Ragefire%20Caverns\"&gt;Ragefire Caverns&lt;/a&gt;, where they find the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Shaman\"&gt;Dark Shaman&lt;/a&gt;.

For many players, this will be their first instance. See the &lt;a href=\"Instance%20Grouping%20Guide\"&gt;Instance Grouping Guide&lt;/a&gt; for some helpful hints.\nHistory.\nBeneath the city of Orgrimmar lies this fiery chasm. Recently, a clan of &lt;a href=\"troggs\"&gt;troggs&lt;/a&gt; known as &lt;a href=\"Ragefire%20Troggs\"&gt;Ragefire Troggs&lt;/a&gt; have begun to appear in the chasm, from deep below the lava-filled tunnels. &lt;a href=\"Magatha%20Grimtotem\"&gt;Magatha Grimtotem&lt;/a&gt;, of the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; people, attempted to make peace with these creatures, but was met only with hostility.

This sect is known as the &lt;a href=\"Searing%20Blade\"&gt;Searing Blade&lt;/a&gt;, and is led by &lt;a href=\"Taragaman\"&gt;Taragaman&lt;/a&gt; the Hungerer, a &lt;a href=\"felguard\"&gt;felguard&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Jergosh\"&gt;Jergosh&lt;/a&gt; the Invoker, a powerful &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;; and &lt;a href=\"Bazzalan\"&gt;Bazzalan&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"satyr\"&gt;satyr&lt;/a&gt;. From their dark hiding place, they plot to overthrow and destroy all that the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; has built for themselves in these lands.\nOfficial description.\nRagefire Chasm consists of a network of volcanic caverns that lie below the orcs' new capital city of &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;. Recently, rumors have spread that a cult loyal to the demonic &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt; has taken up residence within the Chasm's fiery depths. This cult, known as the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Blade\"&gt;Burning Blade&lt;/a&gt;, threatens the very sovereignty of &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;. Many believe that the orc Warchief, &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, is aware of the Blade's existence and has chosen not to destroy it in the hopes that its members might lead him straight to the Shadow Council. Either way, the dark powers emanating from Ragefire Chasm could undo all that the orcs have fought to attain.\nThe Warchief of the Horde, &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, believes that a swift and brutal strike at the cult's lieutenants might serve as Orgrimmar's best defense. If they're not silenced, the dark powers emanating from Ragefire Chasm could undo all that the orcs have fought to attain.\nWalkthroughs.\nAlong with &lt;a href=\"The%20Deadmines\"&gt;The Deadmines&lt;/a&gt;, Ragefire Chasm is the lowest level instance in the game (recommended for players no higher than level 21). This instance is pretty much an easy experience and a good introduction to the &lt;a href=\"instance\"&gt;instance&lt;/a&gt; system for those who are unfamiliar with it.\nGroup selection.\nThe group that you bring with you into the Chasm shouldn't affect your ability to complete the instance. As long as you have a good leveled batch of players, there is little to stop you in this instance. Definitely bring a healer along though, as you will need to make sure characters don't die. It's a long walk from the graveyard outside &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; back to &lt;a href=\"the%20Cleft%20of%20Shadow\"&gt;the Cleft of Shadow&lt;/a&gt;. Keep in mind that all the &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s in the Ragefire Chasm are &lt;a href=\"Elite%20creature\"&gt;elite&lt;/a&gt; and much more powerful than your average mob. It will take teamwork to defeat these enemies, which is key to any instance.\nThe Chasm.\nAfter some initial elemental mobs, you will be forced to fight the &lt;a href=\"trogg\"&gt;trogg&lt;/a&gt;s of the instance. These mobs should give you little difficulty. Just be sure not to pull too many at the same time, or things could get hairy. Upon dealing with the troggs you can continue through the instance to another batch of elemental mobs. These enemies are fairly easy if pulled in small groups of 1 to 2. These mobs will drop the &lt;a href=\"Searing%20Binding\"&gt;Searing Binding&lt;/a&gt;s required for &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Tampering\"&gt;Elemental Tampering&lt;/a&gt;. Once dealt with you can begin work on fighting the Searing Blade Cultists. These groups of mobs usually come in pulls of 2 to 3 mobs and will require coordination to effectively deal with.\nOnce you\u2019ve cleared your way to the massive demon standing in the middle of the lake of lava, you can engage one of the powerful bosses of this instance; &lt;a href=\"Taragaman%20the%20Hungerer\"&gt;Taragaman the Hungerer&lt;/a&gt;. This &lt;a href=\"Boss\"&gt;Boss&lt;/a&gt; is fairly easy to deal with, and once you have effectively engaged with a melee &lt;a href=\"tank\"&gt;tank&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"DPS\"&gt;DPS&lt;/a&gt; will bring him down quickly. He hits harder than anything else in the instance, though, and has an uppercut that can hit you into other mobs or the lava, as well as a Blast Wave attack that has an annoying tendency of killing Imp pets that get too close. Once killed, be sure to loot his heart to complete the quest. \nOnce you are finished battling against the demon, the next two targets will be the leaders of the Searing Blade: &lt;a href=\"Bazzalan\"&gt;Bazzalan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jergosh%20the%20Invoker\"&gt;Jergosh the Invoker&lt;/a&gt;. Jergosh is located just ahead of where Taragaman was, while Bazzalan is located up the adjacent walkway, right above Jergosh.\nBoth of these mobs are straightforward fights as long as you do not drag any additional enemies into the fray. Once they are slain, the instance is effectively over and you can return to the entrance. As long as you didn't run the instance in a marginal group it shouldn't have taken you more than an hour. Not bad for an instance with five quests and a large number of blue drops."}

After being summoned to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer-Thane%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Sorcerer-Thane Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt;, he took control of &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt; and ruled there for more than two hundred years over his minions from deep inside its &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Core\"&gt;fiery core&lt;/a&gt;. Banished back to the &lt;a href=\"Firelands\"&gt;Firelands&lt;/a&gt;, he aligned himself with &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Al%27Akir\"&gt;Al'Akir&lt;/a&gt; in the effort to bring about the &lt;a href=\"Hour%20of%20Twilight\"&gt;Hour of Twilight&lt;/a&gt;. Ragnaros laid siege to the sacred &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to incinerate the &lt;a href=\"World%20Tree\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt;, unleashing his most powerful minions in the process. Despite the incredible destructive forces at his disposal, the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;aided by mortal champions of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; were able to lay siege to the Firelord's domain, where they bested all of the challenges he laid before them and eventually destroyed him within his own fortress. Years after his death, he was replaced as Firelord by &lt;a href=\"Smolderon\"&gt;Smolderon&lt;/a&gt;. Ragnaros was known to be seconded by a &lt;a href=\"Majordomo%20of%20the%20Firelands\"&gt;Majordomo&lt;/a&gt;.\nRagnaros serves as a major antagonist in classic \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" and the secondary antagonist in \"\".\nBiography.\nAncient history.\nIn the beginning, the world that would become known as &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; was ruled by the &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt;s. A nascent &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; maturing within the world's core had consumed much of the fifth element, &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20of%20Life\"&gt;Spirit&lt;/a&gt;, and without this primordial force to create balance, the elements were thrown into chaos. The four &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Lord\"&gt;Elemental Lord&lt;/a&gt;s, who each ruled over innumerable lesser spirits, constantly clashed with one another on the surface of the primordial world during the &lt;a href=\"elemental%20wars\"&gt;elemental wars&lt;/a&gt;. Ragnaros the Firelord employed brute force to destroy his enemies and longed for nothing more than to boil the seas and choke the skies with ember and ash, and wherever he went, volcanoes erupted, spewing forth rivers of fire. The other three Elemental Lords came to foster a deep hatred for the Firelord for his devastating and brazen assaults.\nWhen the entities known as the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt; arrived from the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;Great Dark&lt;/a&gt; and established their &lt;a href=\"Black%20Empire\"&gt;empire&lt;/a&gt;, the Elemental Lords saw the invaders as a threat to their dominion. For the first time in Azeroth's history, the native spirits of the world worked together against a common enemy. Ragnaros' fiery servants joined with &lt;a href=\"Al%27Akir\"&gt;Al'Akir the Windlord's&lt;/a&gt; tempests, creating blistering firestorms and cyclones of flame that reduced the Old Gods' citadels to ash. Eventually, however, the elementals of the world could not stand against the endless swarms of &lt;a href=\"n%27raqi\"&gt;n'raqi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"aqir\"&gt;aqir&lt;/a&gt;, and were all enslaved.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt; arrived on Azeroth to battle the Black Empire, the Old Gods sent their enslaved Elemental Lord lieutenants to face them. Ragnaros battled for weeks against &lt;a href=\"Tyr\"&gt;Tyr&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Odyn\"&gt;Odyn&lt;/a&gt;, yet the keepers' metallic forms kept them safe from the Firelord's flames. Eventually, the two keepers managed to push Ragnaros back into his volcanic lair in the east, where he was most powerful. Ragnaros waited for his enemies to come to him and called fire from the sky to waylay Tyr and Odyn. Smoke descended on the land, however, Tyr's &lt;a href=\"The%20Silver%20Hand%20%28artifact%29\"&gt;great hammer&lt;/a&gt; shone in the darkness. Its erratic movements confused the Firelord and gradually let his guard down, believing his opponents were too cowardly to face him in battle. However, it was exactly what the keepers had been waiting for. Tyr pierced through the smoke and scored a blow against Ragnaros with his hammer. Odyn then flanked the staggered Firelord, and the two keepers overwhelmed their foe and defeated him. The Firelord and his minions were thereafter banished to a smoldering corner of the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Plane\"&gt;Elemental Plane&lt;/a&gt; known as the &lt;a href=\"Firelands\"&gt;Firelands&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt was then that, at the core of this world, the brothers turned on each other. For five millennia, a battle was fought. It was during the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Sundering\"&gt;Elemental Sundering&lt;/a&gt; that Ragnaros attacked &lt;a href=\"Thunderaan\"&gt;Thunderaan&lt;/a&gt;, Prince of Air. Thunderaan was utterly defeated and the Firelord feasted upon his essence but was unable to consume him entirely. Ragnaros divided what remained between his servants, &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Geddon\"&gt;Baron Geddon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Garr\"&gt;Garr&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the center of a vast sky of fire in the Elemental Plane stands &lt;a href=\"Sulfuron%20Keep\"&gt;Sulfuron Keep&lt;/a&gt;, the home of Ragnaros. Until comparatively recently, he ruled his burning land with a molten iron fist.\nWar of the Three Hammers.\nAround two hundred and fifty years ago the ambitious and ruthless &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;Dark Iron clan&lt;/a&gt; reinitiated the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;War of the Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt; against their dwarven brethren, the &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard%20clan\"&gt;Bronzebeard clan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammer clan&lt;/a&gt;, still bitter over losing Ironforge. The Dark Irons launched a two-pronged assault: &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer-Thane%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Sorcerer-Thane Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt; against Ironforge and his sorceress wife, &lt;a href=\"Modgud\"&gt;Modgud&lt;/a&gt;, against the Wildhammers' capital city of &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;, in order to prevent one clan from coming to the aid of the other.\nThings did not go the way they hoped it would. &lt;a href=\"Madoran%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Madoran Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; ultimately led his clan to a decisive victory over Thaurissan's army, who then fled to &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt;, the Dark Iron capital. The Bronzebeards pursued.\nModgud used her powers, eventually broke through Grim Batol's gates and laid siege to the fortress itself. The siege was broken and the Dark Irons routed when Thane &lt;a href=\"Khardros%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Khardros Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt; waded through the battle and killed Modgud. Pursued by the Wildhammers, most of her forces also fled back to their city, only to meet Ironforge forces sent to help Grim Batol. Trapped between the two armies, Modgud's forces were annihilated.\nThe Wildhammer and Bronzebeard armies united to destroy the treacherous Dark Irons once and for all and marched for Thaurissan. Thaurissan, seeking to summon a supernatural minion that would turn the tide of the war back to his favor called upon the ancient powers sleeping beneath the world &lt;a href=\"The%20Seven\"&gt;with seven of his most powerful Dark Iron allies&lt;/a&gt; in the area known as the &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Core\"&gt;Molten Core&lt;/a&gt;. To Thaurissan's surprise, and ultimately his doom, the creature that emerged was more terrible than any nightmare he could have imagined.\nNow, freed by Thaurissan's call, Ragnaros erupted into being once again. Ragnaros' apocalyptic rebirth into &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; shattered the &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt; and created a raging volcano at the center of the devastation. The volcano, known as Blackrock Mountain, was bordered by what is now known as the &lt;a href=\"Searing%20Gorge\"&gt;Searing Gorge&lt;/a&gt;, to the north, and the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Steppes\"&gt;Burning Steppes&lt;/a&gt;, to the south. Though Thaurissan and the seven were killed by the forces he had unleashed, his surviving brethren were ultimately enslaved by Ragnaros and his elementals. Many Dark Iron dwarves remain within the lower areas of the mountain, especially &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Depths\"&gt;Blackrock Depths&lt;/a&gt;, toiling away at the behest of Ragnaros and the Firelord's lieutenants. They worship Ragnaros.\nWitnessing the horrific devastation and the fires spreading across the southern mountains, the Bronzebeards' King Madoran and Wildhammers' Thane Khardros halted their armies and hastily turned back towards their kingdoms, unwilling to face the awesome wrath of Ragnaros.\nThe Firelord was incapable of straying far from the Molten Core, so after Ragnaros and his minions settled there, the &lt;a href=\"lava%20elemental\"&gt;lava elemental&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Roccor\"&gt;Lord Roccor&lt;/a&gt; ended up angering the Firelord and was expelled from the core and forced to guard Blackrock Depths in isolation. Little did Ragnaros know that this was Roccor's plan all along; loathing the scheming and backstabbing of his fellow fire elementals, the mighty being came up with the risky gambit just to avoid serving alongside them.\nAfter the Dark Irons forged their new capital, &lt;a href=\"Shadowforge%20City\"&gt;Shadowforge City&lt;/a&gt;, the dwarves were forced to serve Ragnaros and his lieutenants. Years later, Emperor &lt;a href=\"Dagran%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Dagran Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt; ruled the Dark Irons on behalf of the Firelord. However, while Thaurissan delighted in the power that Ragnaros had bestowed upon him he bristled at his servitude to the Firelord. When Ragnaros ordered Thaurissan to prepare the Dark Irons for a new war, the emperor was overjoyed. He had long dreamed of conquering the other dwarf clans, not only to rule over them but also to wield their combined power to break free of the Firelord's control.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nNow he lies at the bottom of that volcano on Azeroth, striving to find a way home, as well as to gather his strength once again so he can burn away Azeroth and take it for his own. Meanwhile, in Sulfuron Keep and elsewhere across the Firelands, his elemental princes battle constantly for dominance. He and his dwarven minions took control of the Blackrock mountain's volcanic depths and made war on the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s in the Upper &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;, which served as the seat of power for &lt;a href=\"Nefarian\"&gt;Nefarian&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragon\"&gt;black dragon&lt;/a&gt;. Ragnaros has uncovered the secret to creating life from stone and plans to build an army of unstoppable &lt;a href=\"golem\"&gt;golem&lt;/a&gt;s to aid him in conquering the whole of Blackrock Mountain.\nRagnaros sent &lt;a href=\"Ambassador%20Infernus\"&gt;Ambassador Infernus&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Angor%20Fortress\"&gt;Angor Fortress&lt;/a&gt; to mind the &lt;a href=\"Shadowforge%20clan\"&gt;Shadowforge clan&lt;/a&gt; seeking lost artifacts in &lt;a href=\"Uldaman\"&gt;Uldaman&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Dagran%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Dagran Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt;'s death, &lt;a href=\"Moira%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Moira Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt; made sure that the involvement of the fire elementals with the Dark Irons was known to the world. In response, the &lt;a href=\"Hydraxian%20Waterlords\"&gt;Hydraxian Waterlords&lt;/a&gt; recruited scores of powerful adventurers of the Horde and Alliance to enter the Molten Core and defeat his army and the Firelord himself. Ragnaros and his elementals were banished back into the Firelands.\nMidsummer Fire Festival.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Midsummer%20Fire%20Festival\"&gt;Midsummer Fire Festival&lt;/a&gt;, high-level players can face the true threat facing the world. The &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt; send adventurers across the globe on a quest to save the world from an Elemental War. The &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; plans to summon &lt;a href=\"Ahune\"&gt;the Frost Lord&lt;/a&gt; into the world so that he may face Ragnaros bringing an elemental war to the world once again. Players are then sent to &lt;a href=\"Slave%20Pens\"&gt;Slave Pens&lt;/a&gt; to face &lt;a href=\"Ahune\"&gt;Ahune&lt;/a&gt; and defeat him before he may gain full strength and begin his attack on the Firelord.\nCataclysm.\nAfter being defeated in Molten Core, Ragnaros was banished back to the Elemental Plane and resided in &lt;a href=\"Sulfuron%20Keep\"&gt;Sulfuron Keep&lt;/a&gt;, his seat of power within the Firelands. After the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, he and his armies are launching a full-scale assault on Mount Hyjal, attempting to burn the now-regrowing &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt;. He is allied with Deathwing, therefore ending his war against Nefarian's forces, and uniting them as a single army. In the ensuing conflict, many brave heroes gave their lives to protect Hyjal from destruction. By their noble sacrifices, the impossible was achieved: the &lt;a href=\"Guardians%20of%20Hyjal\"&gt;Guardians of Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hamuul%20Runetotem\"&gt;Hamuul Runetotem&lt;/a&gt; along with the adventurers of the Alliance and Horde pushed Ragnaros's minions and Ragnaros himself back into the Firelands.\nRage of the Firelands.\nAt the Maelstrom, &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; strains himself attempting to commune with the elements. Able to feel how broken the world is, and with the elements remaining silent for him, Thrall tells Aggra that he will have to work without limits to fulfill this task. As he ponders the meaning of this, his elemental calls are finally answered - by none other than Ragnaros the Firelord. Ragnaros gives Thrall a vision of the Firelands, ensuring him that its flames will engulf both the world tree and the world beyond it, showing Thrall's reinforced home of &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; washed over in a tide of fire as the final &lt;a href=\"Hour%20of%20Twilight\"&gt;Hour of Twilight&lt;/a&gt; approaches. Stunned, Thrall falls to the ground and the cackling Firelord dissipates.\nNow, the battle to protect Hyjal rages in Ragnaros's smoldering realm. As territory is gained and Azeroth's champions edge closer to the Firelands' inner sanctums, a monumental task lies ahead. Entrenched around Ragnaros's lair - &lt;a href=\"Sulfuron%20Keep\"&gt;Sulfuron Keep&lt;/a&gt; - are his most trusted guardians, including the turncoat &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Flame\"&gt;Druids of the Flame&lt;/a&gt; and their &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;mysterious leader&lt;/a&gt;. Yet Hyjal's defenders cannot afford to shy away from any of these dangers. Should Ragnaros prevail against the incursion and succeed in destroying Nordrassil, Azeroth will suffer a blow from which it might never recover.\nAs Malfurion Stormrage rallied Hyjal's defenders in a massive counterattack, the Circle stormed into the Firelands. Soon, the Circle was reinforced by the Alliance and Horde who pushed further into the Firelands until they reached Sulfuron Keep. During the battle against Ragnaros in the normal dungeon he retreats at 10% health saying that his attackers have come too soon. However during the heroic fight when Ragnaros attempts to withdraw from the battle, he is interrupted by the arrival of Cenarius, Malfurion, and Hamuul, who each channel a powerful spell that solidifies the lava surrounding the Firelord, binding him. With nowhere left to run Ragnaros bursts out of the lava and in a final battle with the adventurers, the fire lord is slain. Due to Ragnaros dying in his plane, the Firelands, he also suffers the same fate as Al'Akir, that being eternal death. He was the second Elemental Lord to die.\nAfter Ragnaros perished Cenarius states that the primal power Ragnaros represented can never be truly vanquished and that another will take his power some day. Hearing this, Hamuul suggests that they maintain a constant vigil over the realm of fire.\nRagnaros' heart was demanded by Kalecgos. Ragnaros' death also freed the entire Dark Iron clan from enslavement, although there are those that still worshipped him regardless.\nHis remains were left where he fell in the lava pool.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nA group of &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt; called the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20Ragnaros\"&gt;Cult of Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; were attempting to revive the former Firelord in the &lt;a href=\"Firelands\"&gt;Firelands&lt;/a&gt; because they saw &lt;a href=\"Moira%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Moira Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt; as a weak leader for the Dark Irons. Ragnaros' remains were still in the lava pool where he originally fell. They were stopped by an &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Anvil-Thane%20Thurgaden\"&gt;Anvil-Thane Thurgaden&lt;/a&gt;, who had come to the Firelands to rebuild the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Anvil\"&gt;Black Anvil&lt;/a&gt; and weren't initially aware of the cult's existence. However, the cult's apparent leader &lt;a href=\"High%20Justice%20Grimstone\"&gt;High Justice Grimstone&lt;/a&gt; still lives. Despite the cult's goals it is currently unknown if Ragnaros can be revived.\nDragonflight.\nWhile &lt;a href=\"time%20travel\"&gt;time travel&lt;/a&gt;ling with &lt;a href=\"Andantenormu\"&gt;Andantenormu&lt;/a&gt;, Ragnaros is briefly seen in the past of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Empire\"&gt;Black Empire&lt;/a&gt;. While his fire elementals are fighting the forces of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s, the Firelord is fighting with &lt;a href=\"Mythrax\"&gt;Mythrax&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\n\"The being approaches you, sheathed in flame. Inside, you see what is plainly a humanoid figure, with two arms, two legs, a head, and eyes that glow with a blue-white fire. The heat radiating from its body is intense, even at a distance. The air between you shimmers like the waves rising from the desert in the heat of deep summer.\"\nBackground.\nRagnaros the Firelord is the most volatile of the Elemental Lords and revels in destruction, especially that of growing, living things. This activity puts him constantly at odds with Therazane the Stonemother, who lives in symbiosis with plants and animals. Whenever possible, Ragnaros splits the earth and sends fiery trails of lava through and over her care-fully wrought creations. Ragnaros has a tenuous alliance with Al\u2019Akir the Windlord, for there can be no true conflagrations without air to fuel them. He is the mortal enemy of Neptulon the Tidehunter, against whose might he is usually swept away.\nAt the end of the dwarven civil war known as the War of the Three Hammers, Ragnaros was mistakenly summoned by the Dark Iron king, Thaurisan. Ripped into the physical world, his arrival proved so catastrophic that he shattered the Redridge Mountains and created the Blackrock volcano. Ragnaros now lives within the volcano, biding his time to escape the physical world. Although he has enslaved the Dark Iron dwarves who summoned him, he hungers still to ravage the world around him.\nCombat.\nRagnaros is a violent sort who delights in causing pain and anguish whenever possible. In battle, he avoids those who are immune or resistant to fire and instead concentrates on those he can harm through burning. If he cannot cause his foes to writhe in agony, he instead forces the ground beneath them to open up, calling forth lava to immolate his foes. Should this tactic fail to achieve the desired result, he generally loses interest and retreats. He has no honor and feels no shame in quitting the battlefield should he be threatened or become bored.\nPortfolio.\nRagnaros the Firelord is ruler over flame, heat and conflagration. He is revered by all fire elementals and creatures that employ fire as a primary weapon, as well as more than a few pyromaniacs. Some wizards believe they have heard his mocking laughter in the high-powered fire spells they cast, but this is most likely just their imaginations. Ragnaros is presently absent from his plane, having been summoned by the Dark Iron dwarves of Khaz Modan. He presently commands their utter allegiance while struggling to find a way to return to the Elemental Plane and the Firelands.\nIn Heroes of the Storm.\nRagnaros is a in \"&lt;a href=\"Heroes%20of%20the%20Storm\"&gt;Heroes of the Storm&lt;/a&gt;\".\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

Ragnaros submerges for 45 seconds or until the players destroy all the Sons of Flame, whichever comes first.\nIntermission: Denizens of Flame!\nAt 40% health Ragnaros casts Splitting Blow, burying Sulfuras into the platform and creating Sons of Flame across the platform. Ragnaros submerges for 45 seconds or until the players destroy all the Sons of Flame, whichever comes first.\nRagnaros also creates two Lava Scions that attack the players.\nStage Three: Begone From My Realm!\nThis stage, and the normal mode encounter, ends at 10% of Ragnaros' health.\nStage Four: The True Power of the Firelord!\nAt 10% health the Firelord unleashes his full power and is able to move freely around the platform. Players have the aid of powerful heroes of Azeroth to support them.\nStrategy.\nPhase 1.\nTanks should stand together on one side of the platform in front of Ragnaros, with melee on the other side. This will allow melee to attack Ragnaros from behind. Ranged and healers should stand scattered behind them with a minimum separation of 6 yards, and should not approach Ragnaros as he will cast Hand of Ragnaros, knocking back players in melee range and locking out casters. Tanks should switch every 3 stacks of Burning Wound.\nAll players must remain aware of Sulfuras Smash, and move to a location diagonal to its impact point to avoid Lava Waves. It's also possible to stand between Ragnaros and the impact point.\nWhen Ragnaros launches a Magma Trap at a player, everyone must move away from it, first avoid setting it off prematurely, and secondly to avoid being knocked into it by an untimely Wrath of Ragnaros. One player should be assigned to set off the Magma Traps. This player should generally stay in the middle of the group so as to be able to reach the traps quickly no matter where they appear. When all players have sufficient health to survive the trap's blast, this player will announce that he or she is setting it off, and move onto the trap. The player will be launched very high in the air and must take steps to survive the fall. Mages with &lt;a href=\"Blink\"&gt;Blink&lt;/a&gt;, priests with &lt;a href=\"Levitate\"&gt;Levitate&lt;/a&gt;, hunters with &lt;a href=\"Deterrence\"&gt;Deterrence&lt;/a&gt;, and warlocks with are excellent candidates for popping the trap.\nAt 70% health, Ragnaros will perform Splitting Blow, and submerge beneath his lava pool beginning the first transition. Any Magma Traps left behind will persist throughout the encounter until popped.\nIntermission 1.\nRagnaros will perform Splitting Blow, smashing down Sulfuras and spawning 8 Sons of Flame. These fire elementals will rush toward Sulfuras at high speed and must not be allowed to reach it. If one elemental reaches Sulfuras, the raid may or may not be able to recover; with two impacts a wipe is virtually guaranteed. When an elemental is reduced to 50% health, it slows greatly and attention can be switched to another one. The elementals can also be stunned, knocked back, and death gripped, but they are not affected by slows. Everyone, including healers, takes responsibility for ensuring that none of them reach the hammer.\nSulfuras may land on one of three locations, such that the elementals will be arranged differently. When Sulfuras lands in the center, there will be 4 elementals on each side. If it lands on the left, there will be two elementals to the left of it, and six to its right. The situation will be reversed if it lands on the right.\nIt is critical to assign specific players to specific Sons of Flame. Players assigned to elementals nearest the hammer must have quick burst damage. One such arrangement would be:\nPlayers assigned to L2, L1, R1, and R2 will always go to that elemental. They should be quick-burst DPSers and/or players with stuns. Players assigned to L4, L3, R3, and R4 will be tanks and/or other DPS. When Sulfuras lands in the middle, everyone will go to their assigned location. When Sulfuras lands on the left, the elementals normally at L4 and L3 will be far to the right, and those two players must go to the right side of the platform instead. When Sulfuras lands on the right, the players assigned to R3 and R4 must instead go to the far left.\nDuring this transition, random players will be targeted with Lava Bolts, for roughly ~40,000 damage putting an additional strain on healing.\nAfter 45 seconds have passed or when all Sons of Flame have been killed, Ragnaros will re-emerge from his platform beginning Phase 2. Sons of Flame still alive at this point will explode, dealing ~100,000 damage to the raid.\nPhase 2.\nThere will be no more traps, but Sulfuras Smash continues. Meanwhile, Ragnaros gains two new abilities: Engulfing Flames and Molten Seeds.\nEngulfing Flames will set one third of the platform on fire. It may be nearest him in melee range, or in the middle or back. Players must move out of it immediately.\nRagnaros will throw a Molten Seed at each player at intervals. When this happens, players must be clustered loosely in a specific location. After the seeds land, all players will move 40-50 yards away to a designated spot for AOE heals and AOE damage. The AOE heals will heal the damage that the seeds do when they explode. The AOE damage will kill the elementals that spawn from the seeds. After the elementals are dead, move back to the previous location to prepare for the next batch of seeds.\nIt will be dangerous while players are moving to the AOE heals/damage point, as Ragnaros may choose this time to ignite that part of the platform with Engulfing Flames, or use Sulfuras Smash right in the middle of the raid. Players must be extra vigilant to be prepared to move away from these while at the same time laying down AOE damage or healing.\nTake care not to push Ragnaros under 40% health during a seed encounter, as you don't want seeds/elementals up when Intermission 2 begins. When Ragnaros approaches 40% health, stop all DPS until the seeds have exploded and the resulting elementals are slain. Then stay where you are (do not move back to the seed dropoff point) and quickly push him under 40% to trigger Intermission 2.\nIntermission 2.\nRagnaros performs another Splitting Blow, and the Sons of Flame must be killed and prevented from reaching Sulfuras as in Intermission 1. In addition, each tank must pick up a Lava Scion. While still alive, Lava Scions will periodically afflict players with Blazing Heat, which will periodically drop fire patches that damage players while healing Sons of Flame. These players should move to the back of the platform. They still need to deal with their Sons of Flame (as do the tanks); however, players must be 'very' careful not to allow Sons of Flame to pass through fire patches, which will both heal them and return them to full speed.\nEspecially on Heroic Mode, it is vital to use the full transition time (45 seconds) to bring the Sons of Flame to as low as possible before Phase 3, as they will continue to cast Blazing Heat. Be careful not to leave the Sons of Flame alive after Ragnaros emerges, as they will explode.\nAfter 45 seconds or when all Sons of Flame have been killed, Ragnaros will re-emerge from his platform, and all Sons of Flame left alive will explode for ~100,000 damage.\nPhase 3.\nIn this phase, Ragnaros will continue to use Sulfuras Smash and Engulfing Flames. Lava Scions, if left alive, will continue to cast Blazing Heat on players. In addition, players must contend with a new element in this phase: Living Meteors.\nThis is a good time to use Heroism. If still alive, Lava Scions should be killed ASAP. Several seconds into the phase, Living Meteors will begin to spawn. Each player targeted by a Living Meteor should move toward the rear of the platform, and then to the far corner, so that the meteor will be away from other players as much as possible. When the meteor corners a player, that player should use a direct ranged attack on it, which will cause the meteor to target someone else. Note that the meteors spawn in increasing numbers - the first two spawns will only trigger 1 meteor each, while the third and fourth drop 2 each.\nAny player who doesn't normally use a ranged attack may wish to hotkey one in advance, e.g. Shadow Word: Death for healing priests or Moonfire for feral druids. Instant attacks are best.\nAt 10% health Ragnaros will retreat, completing the encounter.\nHeroic Mode.\nRagnaros has significantly more health, and all abilities deal significantly more damage. In particular, Sulfuras Smash, Son of Flame Supernovas, and Meteor Impacts deal ~500,000 damage.\nPhase 1: When popped, Magma Traps leave behind a debuff (Magma Trap Vulnerability) increasing damage taken from subsequent Magma Traps by 50%. This debuff lasts 45 seconds and stacks; thus, Magma Traps must not be popped too frequently.\nTransition 1: Sons of Flame now spawn in random locations around the platform, rather than 8 fixed zones. This requires the use of swing groups to take care of inconvenient spawn locations. In particular, Death Grips and Knockbacks are invaluable.\nPhase 2: Molten Elementals now buff other nearby Molten Elementals with Molten Power - increasing damage done by 25% \"per nearby elemental\" and granting immunity to slows/CC effects. This means that if grouped up, players will not be able to survive hits by Molten Elementals. To deal with this, players should stack up and move as the Molten Seeds drop - this will group up the Elementals - and move far away while remaining within range. When the seeds explode, players should AoE while running away, aiming to kill the elementals before they reach (and wipe) the raid.\nIn addition, Engulfing Flames is now replaced by World in Flames. Ragnaros will cast 3 Engulfing Flames on the platform in quick succession. Players must stand at the \"borders\" between where Engulfing Flames spawn, and dance to avoid each set of flames.\nTransition 2: Same as Transition 1 with the addition of 2 Lava Scions that must be tanked. Players should try to get the Lava Scions as low as possible before pushing into Phase 3, while minding the 45 second timer.\nPhase 3: Ragnaros continues casting World in Flames and Sulfuras Smash. At this point, it is an all-out DPS race to try to push Ragnaros to his next phase before his third spawn of Living Meteors, as this will spawn 2 meteors bringing the total to 4, which the raid will be unable to deal with in Phase 4. When Ragnaros is pushed to 10%, he will no longer spawn meteors and will submerge beneath his platform a final time. Any damage done to Ragnaros does carry over to Phase 4, so the raid should continue DPS.\nThis time, Cenarius will temporarily freeze Living Meteors (which should be kicked to the back of the room), and Ragnaros will re-emerge from his platform having healed 40% of his health.\nPhase 4 (Heroic Mode Only):.\nLiving Meteors from Phase 3 persist in this phase and must be knocked back and kited. Ragnaros also uses 3 main abilities, each of which is partially countered by a helpful buff received from the Archdruids that join the fight.\nSuperheated: Ragnaros will quickly stack a fire damage DoT on the raid. The raid should stand in the Breath of Frost provided by Cenarius, which will reset all current stacks on players and grant immunity to further stacks. Cenarius will spawn two Breaths of Frost, upon the third Breath spawning the first will despawn. This will continue, leaving at most two Breaths up at one time.\nLiving Meteors: Upon the second spawn of Breath of Frost, players should group in the more convenient Breath at the time (based on dreadflame positioning), and move a Living Meteor into the second Breath. If done correctly, the Meteor will be temporarily frozen and vulnerable to damage and should be killed during this time. The raid should continue freezing and killing Meteors any time two Breaths are up, until all meteors have been destroyed.\nEmpower Sulfuras: Entangling Roots (marked by green circles on the ground) will be periodically generated by Hamuul. When Ragnaros is kited onto the area, he will be temporarily stunned and take increased damage. While this may seem tempting, the Roots are best used to counter Ragnaros' Empower Sulfuras ability. Periodically, Ragnaros will empower his weapon, and gain a buff that will deal ~500,000 damage \"to the entire raid\" per melee swing. Upon receiving this buff, Ragnaros should be taunted by an off-tank and kited into the Roots. When done properly, the Empower Sulfuras buff will expire before Ragnaros breaks free. If the roots are not available (due to previous mistakes), Ragnaros will need to be \"taunt-kited\" back and forth until his buff fades.\nDreadflame: Ragnaros periodically summons Dreadflames on the ground. Dreadflames deal damage to players standing in them, and will constantly multiply if not extinguished immediately. Malfurion will cast Cloudburst on the ground and 1 (25 man: 3) player must go and take it to receive the buff Deluge, which will grant immunity to Superheated and Dreadflame damage and allow him to extinguish Dreadflames by running over them. Dreadflame will spawn faster and faster the longer this phase lasts, and unextinguished Dreadflame will continue to multiply. When the Dreadflame begins to overwhelm the raid, the player(s) with Deluge should begin to prioritize Dreadflames that are close to the raid, close to Breaths of Frost, and close to Entrapping Roots (for the tank to taunt and trap Ragnaros). Eventually, the Dreadflames will spawn and multiply faster than they can be extinguished, and will overwhelm the raid.\nHeroic Ragnaros at Level 90 (pre-6.0).\nHeroic Ragnaros is soloable by Death Knights on 10 man at level 90. For the strategy and relevant details, see the linked video.\nAt Level 90, Ragnaros is still a worthwhile boss to run, due to his excellent &lt;a href=\"transmog\"&gt;transmog&lt;/a&gt; gear and the chance (1%) to drop a &lt;a href=\"Smoldering%20Egg%20of%20Millagazor\"&gt;Smoldering Egg of Millagazor&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, the detail and quality of the encounter makes the instance well worth at least one visit.\nPhase 1: With level 90 health pools, Magma Traps now deal insignificant amounts of damage and can be popped largely without regard to the vulnerability debuff. The \"exploding\" player should still use an ability to mitigate or avoid the fall damage. Sulfuras Smash and Lava Waves should still be avoided (the Lava Wave, in particular, can knock players off the platform, leading to inevitable death).\nPhase 2: Instead of stacking the molten elementals (when stacked, 20 molten elementals still deal ~1,000,000 damage per swing) it is best to spread out the molten seeds and the spawning elementals, thus avoiding the stacking buff. The adds can then be picked off one by one by the raid.\nPhase 3: The raid should burn Ragnaros while minding any Living Meteors that may spawn (ideally none). The meteor impacts still deal enough damage to possibly kill a level 90 player (~500,000) and thus should be knocked back and kited.\nPhase 4: If the group has high DPS, it's possible to ignore any Living Meteors and simply burn the boss. He will still quickly wipe the raid with Empower Sulfuras, and thus tanks should save Entrapping Roots for the ability.\nTransitions: The transitions are extremely important even for a Level 90 raid - exploding Sons of Flame deal ~500,000 raid damage per Supernova. It's best to split the group in half, and assign half of the raid to each side. Players should keep in mind Sons of Flame need only be burned to ~50% to be slowed considerably - after which it is best to switch to a high-health Son of Flame if there is one up.\nDue to possible attrition from instant-death mechanics and the need for high, focused DPS, a full raid is recommended (especially for a &lt;a href=\"pug\"&gt;pug&lt;/a&gt;) even at Level 90.\nSolo strategy.\nRagnaros is fairly easily soloable after the mechanics updates in &lt;a href=\"Patch%206.0.2\"&gt;Patch 6.0.2&lt;/a&gt;. Stand in melee range and pop all CDs on the pull. Standing in melee range lets players ignore the Sulfuras Smash and Lava Waves mechanics, as they will land at minimum 10 yards away from the inner edge of the platform. Be warned that both mechanics can still knock players off the platform, which will fail the encounter. Magma Traps don't do much damage, but the fall damage that the traps cause will.\nIn the intermissions at 70% and 40%, get positioned near Sulfuras. Do quick attacks to the Sons of Flame nearest to the hammer to slow them down (remember that they move slower the less health they have), then do the same for the rest of the adds that are closing in. Make sure as many die as possible before reaching Sulfuras, as their Supernova still stings, though it's not the instant fatality it was before 6.0. The sons take priority over the Lava Scions in the second intermission, but once the sons are under control, burst down the scions.\nIn phases two and three, Engulfing Flame (or World in Flames in heroic mode) comes into play. Do get out of melee range if the area of effect hits the inner 1/3 of the platform. Molten Seeds in phase two are inconsequential, but do kill the adds that spawn. Phase three's Living Meteor landing zones still hurt, so side-step out of them. Keep doing damage until he hits 10% and ends the encounter in normal mode, or submerges for phase four in heroic.\nIn the Heroic-only phase four, drag him over Entangling Roots when Ragnaros casts Empower Sulfuras, and otherwise stand in Cenarius' Breath of Frost.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

After he emerges, Sons of Flame will continue to spawn from random areas within the lava for the rest of the fight. In addition, Ragnaros will permanently despawn if he is not killed within 60 minutes.\nSummoning.\nRagnaros is summoned by &lt;a href=\"Majordomo%20Executus\"&gt;Majordomo Executus&lt;/a&gt; who will perform the summoning upon a player's request through a dialogue. Executus must be defeated as an boss before he agrees to do so. Moreover, Executus will only be summoned when &lt;a href=\"the%20runes%20of%20warding\"&gt;the runes of warding&lt;/a&gt; has been deactivated. They are deactivated by killing the bosses that guard them, which means every initial boss (except for &lt;a href=\"Lucifron\"&gt;Lucifron&lt;/a&gt;) in the Molten Core has to die before Ragnaros can be summoned.\nSet-up.\nThis means that melee should be around Ragnaros generally on the south, west and north parts of the inner ring, and the ranged is on the south and west portions of the outer ring. There are small patches of wall on the outer rings that, when stood directly against will usually prevent Ragnaros' random fireballs from knocking you back.\nStrategy overview.\nThis fight alternates between two stages - in the first, Ragnaros is up and everybody concentrates on DPSing him, in the second Ragnaros is immune to DPS, and the raid has to deal with his sons instead. Ragnaros is always up for 3 minutes (stage 1), then submerges for 90 seconds. This alternates until either the raid is wiped or Ragnaros is dead.\nThe basic idea is to get him down to 30%-40% before the first wave of sons, to be able to kill him before the second. If your warriors and warlocks are up to the task, it is possible to get him down between the second and third wave of sons, but there's not much point in holding back DPS as no tradeoff between survivability and doing damage is possible.\nPhase 1.\n20 seconds before Ragnaros submerges and spawns Sons of Flame, the whole raid (exc. the MT who keeps tanking until the submerge) should collapse to the southern lip of the outer ring, as to be ready to handle the sons when they spawn. Mages should already be positioned at the collapse point. Mana users should be at the very edge of the ring, as to avoid the Son's massive mana burn aura. Tanks and Rogues should form a wall in front of the casters.\nLoot.\nRagnaros drops two &lt;a href=\"Tier%202\"&gt;Tier 2&lt;/a&gt; legs, two non-set items, and various lower-level items.\nYou receive 200 Reputation with the &lt;a href=\"Hydraxian%20Waterlords\"&gt;Hydraxian Waterlords&lt;/a&gt; at all reputation levels.\nSulfuras, Hand of Ragnaros.\nRagnaros approximately has a 3% to drop the legendary &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Sulfuras\"&gt;Eye of Sulfuras&lt;/a&gt;. The Eye of Sulfuras, when combined with a &lt;a href=\"Sulfuron%20Hammer\"&gt;Sulfuron Hammer&lt;/a&gt;, creates the legendary hammer, &lt;a href=\"Sulfuras%2C%20Hand%20of%20Ragnaros\"&gt;Sulfuras, Hand of Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt;. In order to learn how to the craft the Sulfuron Hammer, you must turn in one &lt;a href=\"Sulfuron%20Ingot\"&gt;Sulfuron Ingot&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Thorium%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Thorium Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; member &lt;a href=\"Lokhtos%20Darkbargainer\"&gt;Lokhtos Darkbargainer&lt;/a&gt; located in the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Depths\"&gt;Blackrock Depths&lt;/a&gt;.

Shortly after, Ragnok's former master, &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;, brought the orc back and placed his spirit, along with those of his fellow council members, in the decaying bodies of the &lt;a href=\"Brotherhood%20of%20the%20Horse\"&gt;Knights of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Thus the &lt;a href=\"Death%20knight%20%28Old%20Horde%29\"&gt;death knights&lt;/a&gt; were born.\nUltimately, the Horde was defeated and the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; destroyed. Ragnok found himself trapped on &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; along with &lt;a href=\"Teron%20Gorefiend\"&gt;Teron Gorefiend&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gaz%20Soulripper\"&gt;Gaz Soulripper&lt;/a&gt;. Teron, accompanied by the other death knights, convinced &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; to reopen the portal.\nRagnok was assigned to accompany &lt;a href=\"Tagar%20Spinebreaker\"&gt;Tagar Spinebreaker&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fenris%20Wolfbrother\"&gt;Fenris Wolfbrother&lt;/a&gt; on their quest to retrieve the &lt;a href=\"Jeweled%20Scepter%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Jeweled Scepter of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;. They overcame a patrol of the &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiran%20fleet\"&gt;Kul Tiran fleet&lt;/a&gt; with the help of &lt;a href=\"black%20dragon\"&gt;black dragon&lt;/a&gt;s, and arrived at the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt; with ships stolen from &lt;a href=\"Menethil%20Harbor\"&gt;Menethil Harbor&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce inside the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, Ragnok's magic guided the way towards the scepter. They found the scepter, but it was in the hands of a &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;, one of the tomb's guardians. The demon was slain in battle, and the scepter recovered. When Fenris commanded the company to leave, Ragnok lashed out angrily. He had sensed the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Eye of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; nearby, and said that it would be foolish to abandon the chance to claim an artifact of such great power; an artifact that Gul'dan had come to claim himself. Yet, Fenris was adamant. Ragnok threatened him with death, but did not avert Fenris' choice, and resigned himself to his duty. With the Scepter of Sargeras, Ragnok, Fenris, and Tagar returned to Ner'zhul to continue their duty to the Horde on the front lines.\nWar in Outland.\nWhen Ner'zhul fled through a portal to escape the destruction of Draenor, Ragnok did not follow him and became trapped in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; as a result. Twenty years later, he sought to overthrow &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; and become the new Lord of Outland and, eventually, &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. To these ends, Ragnok united a band of &lt;a href=\"fel%20orc\"&gt;fel orc&lt;/a&gt;s under his strict rule and bargained with &lt;a href=\"Kadavan\"&gt;Kadavan&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"ethereal\"&gt;ethereal&lt;/a&gt; mercenary, in order to gain his help with enslaving &lt;a href=\"nether%20drake\"&gt;nether drake&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Nether%20dragon\"&gt;dragons&lt;/a&gt; to bolster his forces.\nEventually, he managed to defeat his rivals, the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt;, and took their surviving warriors and nether dragons to strengthen his army. With them, he set out to conquer the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;. His machinations were foiled by &lt;a href=\"Jorad%20Mace\"&gt;Jorad Mace&lt;/a&gt; and a combined &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Aldor\"&gt;Aldor&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Broken\"&gt;Broken&lt;/a&gt; army; who defeated his forces at the &lt;a href=\"Stair%20of%20Destiny\"&gt;Stair of Destiny&lt;/a&gt;. Ultimately, Jorad Mace destroyed Ragnok's device which controlled his nether dragons and called on the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; to judge Ragnok, blasting apart his chest with a radiant swing of his hammer and sending his disintegrating body tumbling from the back of his nether dragon mount."}

For years, he sought out the best fighters in the world to test himself against them. Long ago he fought &lt;a href=\"Chen%20Stormstout\"&gt;Chen Stormstout&lt;/a&gt; and lost. In humiliation, he betrayed the oath he had sworn to remain free of &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic corruption and traveled to &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; to drink demon blood, becoming a fel orc. He thereafter dedicated his life in training so he could defeat Chen, the only being who had ever defeated him.\nRahjak was hired by the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Zhahara%20Darksquall\"&gt;Zhahara Darksquall&lt;/a&gt; to find the &lt;a href=\"Pearl%20of%20Pandaria%20%28item%29\"&gt;Pearl of Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;. Using magic, Zhahara spoke with Rahjak from the &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;ian side of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; and summoned a storm to distract the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; forces while the blademaster came through from Outland. Rahjak easily slaughtered the portal's defenders before greeting Zhahara, who was accompanied by the &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Blokk\"&gt;Blokk&lt;/a&gt;. She told the orc that she had received word from &lt;a href=\"Rumblefitz\"&gt;Rumblefitz&lt;/a&gt; about the two &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Li%20Li%20Stormstout\"&gt;Li Li&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Strongbo\"&gt;Strongbo&lt;/a&gt;, and that the time had come for them to claim the pearl and for Rahjak to embrace his destiny.\nAfter visiting &lt;a href=\"Brewfest\"&gt;Brewfest&lt;/a&gt;, Li Li and Strongbo journeyed to &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; aboard a &lt;a href=\"zeppelin\"&gt;zeppelin&lt;/a&gt; while Rahjak, Rumblefitz, and Blokk pursued them on a ship. When Rumblefitz pointed out that the pandaren were pulling away, Rahjak simply stated that Zhahara would find them should the trio lose track of them, and either way the pandaren were sure to draw attention wherever they went. Rahjak explained that he intended to face Bo in combat in hopes of finding the breath of eternity, but that Rumblefitz' stupidity could cost him his chance. The blademaster warned that if an incident like the &lt;a href=\"Deeprun%20Tram\"&gt;Deeprun Tram&lt;/a&gt;\u2014when Rumblefitz had been discovered and ended up in a fight with the pandaren\u2014happened again, he would skin Rumblefitz alive. When Rumblefitz started to reply in a mocking manner, Rahjak punched Blokk in the chest, causing the ogre to vomit, and then amended his statement: he would skin Rumblefitz alive, then feed what was left of him to the ogre. He finally stated, however, that he would let Rumblefitz live for now since Zhahara apparently saw something in him.\nThe blademaster pursued Li Li and Bo to &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt;. Following an argument between the two pandaren, Li Li ran out into the rain only to be kidnapped by the fel orc. He brought the cub to a ship headed for an unknown island, leaving a map and message carved in stone telling Bo \"Come alone, or the little one dies.\" After Zhahara unsuccessfully tried interrogating Li Li about &lt;a href=\"Wanyo\"&gt;Wanyo&lt;/a&gt; and the pearl he had, she left the pandaren in Rahjak's care. Li Li was brought atop the island and chained up, with Rahjak telling Rumblefitz to give her a spyglass so she could watch Bo die once he arrived to save her. Rahjak told Li Li she could stop the duel at any moment if only she revealed where Wanyo was.\nBo arrived to the island at sunrise. Rahjak informed him that all he needed to do was win, and Li Li would come to no harm. When Bo asked why Rahjak had gone to so much trouble to challenge him, the blademaster explained how much he had sacrificed in order to be the best fighter and that he needed to prove himself by killing Bo. Bo accepted the challenge and the two began dueling. Early into their match, Rahjak's sword shattered Bo's staff. Bo kept one of the broken fragments on his person and tossed the other at Rahjak, but the orc dodged it. However, he gained the upper hand and knocked Rahjak into a rock formation, then slashed at him with the broken wood. Rahjak replied by splitting into a series of &lt;a href=\"Blademaster%20%28Warcraft%20III%29%23Mirror%20Image\"&gt;mirror images&lt;/a&gt; and surrounding the pandaren, catching him off guard and wounding him mortally across the chest. Rahjak prepared to kill him, but at that moment Chen Stormstout arrived to the island upon a rocket.\nRahjak declared that he had long waited for the day when he would face his old opponent again and charged at Chen. As they fought, Chen pointed out how Rahjak had once been a noble warrior and how twisted he had now become, with the orc replying that he would do whatever it took to be the best. As Rahjak's sword and Chen's staff collided and they stared into each other's eyes, the blademaster finally experienced the breath of eternity he had been searching for his whole life. He then once again split into several mirror images, but Chen responded by transforming into spirits of &lt;a href=\"Storm%2C%20Earth%2C%20and%20Fire\"&gt;storm, earth, and fire&lt;/a&gt;. As the spirits began pummeling Rahjak, Zhahara\u2014who was holding Li Li and watching the fight from nearby\u2014decided she wouldn't let her opportunity slip away by having the orc lose the duel and struck one of the spirits with lightning, causing Chen to revert to his old self. Rahjak rushed at the pandaren, but Chen managed to steal the orc's sword and throw it at Zhahara, killing her. With Chen's back turned, Rahjak unsheathed a knife from his belt and attempted to kill him, but the dying Strongbo used the broken piece of his spear to stab Rahjak through the back, putting an end to the blademaster.\nDevelopment.\nThe author of the graphic novel, &lt;a href=\"Micky%20Neilson\"&gt;Micky Neilson&lt;/a&gt;, discussed some details about the development of Rahjak during an interview with &lt;a href=\"Blizzplanet\"&gt;Blizzplanet&lt;/a&gt;: \nArtist Sean Galloway originally envisioned a fairly different design for Rahjak (shown to the right), which was later changed to a more traditional orc blademaster appearance. In an interview with &lt;a href=\"WoW%20Insider\"&gt;WoW Insider&lt;/a&gt;, Galloway stated that \"[...] I'm really glad that Blizzard pulled me back on it because I think fans would have been really upset of the first initial pass -- it was a little off its mark!\""}

{"id": "14016", "revid": "214161", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=14016", "title": "Raid", "text": "Raids &lt;a href=\"group\"&gt;group&lt;/a&gt;s are a way to have &lt;a href=\"parties\"&gt;parties&lt;/a&gt; of more than 5 and up to 40 people, divided into up to 8 groups of up to 5 players. The terms \"raid\" and \"raiding\" primarily and traditionally refer to &lt;a href=\"PvE\"&gt;PvE&lt;/a&gt; raid-specific instances. Raid instances require playing as a team, and are designed to be the most challenging and entertaining PvE content available in the game.\nAs party &lt;a href=\"leader\"&gt;leader&lt;/a&gt;, a player can convert their group into a raid group by accessing the \"Social\" Panel, selecting \"Raid\", and choosing \"Convert Group to Raid.\" You can do this also by right-clicking your character portrait and selecting \"Convert Group to Raid\" from the menu. From then on, any new players invited to the group will join the raid group (up to a maximum of 40). This requires at least 2 people (ie. a party). A person alone cannot form a raid group.\nWhile in a raid group, players do not receive credit for completing quest objectives unless the quest calls for a raid. Players also receive an experience reduction for any mob killed while in a raid group. These are to prevent players from creating very large groups in order to complete normal quests or other game content intended for parties of 5 or fewer.\nPlayers need to be at least level 10 to join a raid group, though actual raid instances begin at level 30.\nInstances requiring a raid are subject to a &lt;a href=\"raid%20timer\"&gt;raid timer&lt;/a&gt;, which means that defeated bosses within the instance will remain so until the instance is reset (typically once a week).\nThe intended number of players for a raid instance has varied greatly in the past, with the most extreme setup being 40-man raids, eg. &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Core\"&gt;Molten Core&lt;/a&gt; and others in &lt;a href=\"vanilla\"&gt;vanilla-era&lt;/a&gt; \"WoW\". Since \"&lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;Wrath of the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;\", all new raids have been introduced in a 10-player and a 25-player version. In &lt;a href=\"Mists%20of%20Pandaria\"&gt;Mists of Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Flexible%20Raid\"&gt;Flexible Raid&lt;/a&gt;ing was introduced with the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, allowing anywhere between 10 and 25 players, and in &lt;a href=\"Warlords%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Warlords of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, the flexible scaling technology expanded to all difficulties except Mythic, which is 20-man only.\nRaiding as end-game content.\nRaids are designed as activities for people whose characters have reached the &lt;a href=\"end-game\"&gt;maximum level&lt;/a&gt;. As the game does not permit further increase of skills, or introduce new abilities, the only avenues remaining to enhance a character lay in better gear and other rewards only found in raid instances.\nAlmost all raid events and bosses require that the raid members have particular levels of gear and skill, expressed as &lt;a href=\"dps\"&gt;dps&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"damage%20mitigation\"&gt;damage mitigation&lt;/a&gt;, and/or &lt;a href=\"healing\"&gt;healing&lt;/a&gt; ability. In addition, a majority of such bosses also require the group use particular, sometimes unique tactics. While occasionally those tactics mirror those used by smaller groups, they often require things that smaller groups simply don't have the diversity to do.\nGiven these unique requirements, most raid boss encounters require some amount of practice to defeat. Sometimes the peculiarities of a boss encounter are such that being vastly overgeared/overlevel will not permit the raid to ignore the designed tactics.\n&lt;a href=\"Raiding%20guild\"&gt;Raiding guild&lt;/a&gt;s are guilds that devote some or all of their collective time to playing in raid instances, defeating (or practicing to defeat) raid encounters. They have the advantage of being able to get to know the abilities (or lack thereof) of their various members, and adjust their tactics accordingly. They also have a shared investment in the success of not just that raid, but future raids as well, a feature that \"pick up raids\" lack.\nRaiding guilds often use additional measures to enhance their chances of success, notably &lt;a href=\"Voice%20over%20Internet%20Protocol\"&gt;Voice over Internet Protocol&lt;/a&gt; (VoIP) software, and particular addons that provide timing, &lt;a href=\"threat\"&gt;threat&lt;/a&gt;, and other services not available in the base WoW client.\nRaiding guilds and time commitment.\nThere is some academic discussion about the concept of raids as they currently are designed in major graphical MMOs, primarily centered on how much of a player's time they consume. A typical World of Warcraft raid can take 3-4 hours once the group is able to complete it, and can take much more time over many sessions to get to that point. Basically, that it can take up as much of one's time as permitted. Generally, though, practical considerations (work/school schedules, fatigue, etc) will place limits on how much time a group spends raiding.\nOne of the more extreme examples in the history of MMOs is a Final Fantasy XI raid that lasted 18 hours before the players decided to quit.. Many boss fights in \"World of Warcraft\" contain an &lt;a href=\"Enrage%20%28mechanic%29\"&gt;enrage&lt;/a&gt; timer to ensure that a single fight does not last too long.\nGiven the amount of time involved to be successful, there are some game developers and academics that feel that raiding can be a focus for obsession, impacting a person's ability to care about real life goals and accomplishments. Players should be aware of these factors when deciding if they want to get into raiding or to what extent they want to get into raiding.\nStarting a raid.\nThe leader of a party can convert the group to a raid by clicking the \"Convert to Raid\" button in the Group window. At this point it becomes a \"group of parties\" with up to 8 parties, each with 5 characters. The leader of the raid can drag characters between groups to move them to different parties; this was traditionally done to achieve some strategic goal such as distributing &lt;a href=\"shamans\"&gt;shamans&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"paladins\"&gt;paladins&lt;/a&gt; to share &lt;a href=\"totems\"&gt;totems&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Paladins%23Auras\"&gt;auras&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"warriors\"&gt;warriors&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"rogues\"&gt;rogues&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Shout\"&gt;Battle Shout&lt;/a&gt; but Blizzard has phased out this strategy. The leader can promote other characters, which gives them the abilities to invite and kick from the raid and also use the broadcast raid warnings (using the \"/rw\" command). A good site to use to determine appropriate raid makeup is https://raidcomp.mmo-champion.com/.\nSee &lt;a href=\"Raiding%20for%20newbies\"&gt;Raiding for newbies&lt;/a&gt; for further details.\nRaid mods.\nThere have been many mods produced specifically for raiding.\nRaid instances.\nKalimdor.\n10-player\n25-player\n40-player\n10 and 25-player\n10-30/20-player\nEastern Kingdoms.\n10-player\n20-player\n25-player\n40-player\n10 and 25-player\nOutland.\n25-player\nNorthrend.\n10 and 25-player\nElemental Plane.\n10 and 25-player\nPandaria.\n10 and 25-player\n10-30/20-player\n10-30/20-player\nDraenor.\n10-30/20-player\nBroken Isles.\n10-30/20-player\nArgus.\n10-30/20-player\nZandalar.\n10-30/20-player\nKul Tiras.\n10-30/20-player\nNazjatar.\n10-30/20-player\nRevendreth.\n10-30/20-player\nThe Maw.\n10-30/20-player\nZereth Mortis.\n10-30/20-player\nThaldraszus.\n10-30/20-player\nZaralek Cavern.\n10-30/20-player"}

There are various mods which offer features such as main tank lists, raid warnings (messages which appear mid-screen for all raid members), voting mechanisms and boss status trackers. Another useful utility for raids are voice communication programs like Ventrilo or Teamspeak. Install them even if you have no mic - unless you're the raid leader it's not imperative that everybody can hear you.\nThe first (and for about one year the only) raid addon was CT_RaidAssist (CTRA for short). Meanwhile Blizzard added some of its features to the standard UI, but it is still the reference. It offers a nice overview for 25 or 40 raid members, raid messages, a main tank list and a lot more. The CT team still supports this mod, and keeps enhancing its functionality. It can be found at &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.ctmod.net/downloads/\"&gt;CT Downloads&lt;/a&gt;.\nMeanwhile, the Ace community grew up to the point where they offer a mod for about every need. Notable Ace mods for raids include &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wowace.com/wiki/oRA2\"&gt;oRA2&lt;/a&gt; (CTRA replacement), &lt;a href=\"BigWigs\"&gt;BigWigs&lt;/a&gt; (boss mod), Grid (very minimalistic but powerful raid group display) and many more. All Ace mods can be found at the &lt;a href=\"http%3A//files.wowace.com/\"&gt;WoWAce download site&lt;/a&gt;.\nAggro monitors are also very useful tools in raids. It helps a lot if the main damage dealers know exactly how many percent of the tanks aggro they already have reached. Notable mods for this function are &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wowace.com/wiki/Omen\"&gt;Omen&lt;/a&gt; (Ace2) and &lt;a href=\"http%3A//wow.curse.com/downloads/details/4204\"&gt;KLH Threat Meter&lt;/a&gt;.\nBoss mods keep track of the special abilities of most raid bosses, and inform the raid when certain critial events take place. The first of this kind was CT boss mod (found at the same place as CTRA), the Ace community offers BigWigs, and &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.deadlybossmods.com\"&gt;Deadly Boss Mods&lt;/a&gt; also serves this purpose."}

{"id": "324295", "revid": "40372170", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=324295", "title": "Raid Finder", "text": "The Raid Finder (or \u201cLooking For Raid\u201d, commonly abbreviated as \u201cLFR\u201d), accessed through the &lt;a href=\"Group%20Finder\"&gt;Group Finder&lt;/a&gt;, is a tool that helps players find and join a random or specific raid instance with others. The feature was first released in &lt;a href=\"patch%204.3.0\"&gt;patch 4.3.0&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt; as a permanent addition to the raiding system, and has been included in all subsequent instanced raids.\nThe Raid Finder can be found in the Dungeons &amp; Raids tab of the &lt;a href=\"Group%20Finder\"&gt;Group Finder&lt;/a&gt;, accessed through a button on the &lt;a href=\"micro%20menu\"&gt;micro menu&lt;/a&gt; at the bottom of the &lt;a href=\"user%20interface\"&gt;user interface&lt;/a&gt;. \n\"Raid Finder\" is also the difficulty level of any raid joined using the tool, and is only available using the tool. It is always in 25-player mode, and its difficulty is the lowest offered for any raid in which it is available. Raid Finder gear level falls between five-player heroics and the Normal raid mode on the same tier. For the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Mists%20of%20Pandaria\"&gt;Mists of Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Flexible%20Raid\"&gt;flexible&lt;/a&gt; difficulty was the next step above Raid Finder but this was removed in &lt;a href=\"Warlords%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Warlords of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;.\nSupported raids.\nRaid Finder eligibility is based on character level, average &lt;a href=\"item%20level\"&gt;item level&lt;/a&gt;, and specific &lt;a href=\"Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Raids%20achievements\"&gt;raid achievements&lt;/a&gt;. Generally, the first wing of a &lt;a href=\"Tier\"&gt;raid tier&lt;/a&gt; does not require any achievements, but subsequent wings (in the same raid instance or not) require the previous wing's achievement.\nPlayers can use the Raid Finder to queue for the following raids:\nDifficulty.\nThe boss fights in a Raid Finder raid are simplified: their difficulty relative to normal and flexible is scaled down with the intent that they be manageable by randomly assembled, less organized &lt;a href=\"pickup%20group\"&gt;pickup group&lt;/a&gt;s. Reduced boss health and damage compared to higher level modes in the same group size, as well as the removal or modification of specific mechanics that normally make the raid dependent on the performance of a single player.\nA Raid Finder run is a gentle introduction to the bosses, and can be educational for a player who is new to, or still learning the fight. Some important differences in boss tactics exist between Raid Finder and Normal mode, and it is especially important to remain informed of this when or if you transition to Normal mode.\nEach time a Raid Finder group wipes on a given boss, the &lt;a href=\"Determination\"&gt;Determination&lt;/a&gt; buff will be applied to the players which increases their health, damage dealt, and healing received by 5%, stacking up to 10 times, and dropping when the boss is killed.\nLoot rules.\nRaid Finder uses a system called Personal Loot. When a boss is killed for the first time each week, every player has a fixed percentage chance of receiving a loot item. For each player, the game will decide whether the player will receive loot. If so, the game will then select a class- and spec-appropriate item from the boss's loot table and immediately deposit the item into the player's inventory. The specialization is the one the player is using at the time of the boss's death, and is not related to the role chosen by the player when queueing for the raid. All players who do not receive a loot item will instead be issued a bag of gold. All loot gained through this method is strictly &lt;a href=\"Bind%20on%20Pickup\"&gt;Bind on Pickup&lt;/a&gt; and can not be traded with other players.\nBosses may only be looted once per week, though they can be run as often as desired.\nExtra loot rolls.\nLevel 90 players can choose to use an &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Charm%20of%20Good%20Fortune\"&gt;Elder Charm of Good Fortune&lt;/a&gt; (for &lt;a href=\"Patch%205.0\"&gt;Patch 5.0&lt;/a&gt; bosses), &lt;a href=\"Mogu%20Rune%20of%20Fate\"&gt;Mogu Rune of Fate&lt;/a&gt; (for &lt;a href=\"Patch%205.2\"&gt;Patch 5.2&lt;/a&gt; bosses) or &lt;a href=\"Warforged%20Seal\"&gt;Warforged Seal&lt;/a&gt; (for &lt;a href=\"Patch%205.4\"&gt;Patch 5.4&lt;/a&gt; bosses) for an additional roll on loot after every attempt. This &lt;a href=\"bonus%20roll\"&gt;bonus roll&lt;/a&gt; works just like the first roll does and will not affect in any way other players' loot.\nA charm may also be used, on most bosses, for an additional roll even on subsequent kills during the same week. For example, a player may return to &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shi\"&gt;Lei Shi&lt;/a&gt; and kill her a second time, receiving no loot by default, but use a charm and get another chance. Notable exceptions include open &lt;a href=\"world%20boss\"&gt;world boss&lt;/a&gt;es and the final bosses of an instance, on which only one bonus roll may be used per week.\nQueueing.\nQueuing can done by forming a complete 25-man raid and initiating a queue request. You will then immediately be teleported to the raid.\nYou can also form an incomplete 25-man raid and queue, with additional members being chosen by the game to fill out the 25-man roster; all players will be teleported to the raid.\nIt is currently possible to form a regular party including cross-realm Real-ID friends and queue for the raid. It is not yet possible to convert a party including Real-ID friends into a raid.\nReplacements.\nSince the Raid Finder is designed to serve players whose schedules do not permit regular raiding, it is designed to replace drop-outs. It is not possible to invite specific players to a Raid Finder raid once it has started (to prevent players from kicking pugged players to make room for friends).\nLock-out.\nThere is no lock-out for Raid Finder in the traditional sense. You can queue in the Raid Finder repeatedly and defeat the same bosses over and over again. However, you are only entitled to a chance to receive loot from a boss the first time you kill that boss per weekly reset. If you kill the boss again later during the same weekly period, you are not eligible to receive any loot other than that from a charm bonus roll.\nIf you are chosen as a replacement for a partially-completed raid it is possible for you to complete that raid, then queue again later and try for loot for bosses that you had not personally defeated yet. When the raid reaches bosses you have defeated, you will not be eligible for loot. If you have completed bosses later in the progression schedule for a raid, the system will give you priority to join a group that will take on the bosses that you have missed.\nIf you leave a Raid Finder squad while they are in combat with a boss and that squad defeats the boss during that same battle, you will not receive loot but will still be marked as having defeated that boss, and will not be eligible for any more rewards from that boss until the weekly reset. Players who need to &lt;a href=\"away\"&gt;leave the keyboard&lt;/a&gt; in the middle of a fight may leave their characters in the raid to avoid being subject to this consequence."}

{"id": "235256", "revid": "214161", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=235256", "title": "Raid difficulty", "text": "Raid difficulty determines the difficulty of the encounters and is controlled by the raid leader. A variety of options are available depending on the &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt; and when it was released. These can be separated into three main periods: Fixed size, until 3.2; 10 man heroic, until \"Mists\"; and post-\"Draenor\", the current system. In the past, raid difficulty was often associated with raid size and the quality of the &lt;a href=\"loot\"&gt;loot&lt;/a&gt; involved.\nCurrent system.\nThere are four types of raid: Flexible Raid Finder, Flexible Normal, Flexible Heroic, and 20-person Mythic. The three flexible raid sizes can accommodate raid groups from 10-25 people; Mythic is the only difficulty requiring a fixed size of the group. These difficulties are present in raids from \"&lt;a href=\"Warlords%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Warlords of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Azeroth\"&gt;Battle for Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;\". Each type of difficulty comes with its own quality of loot.\n\"Warlords of Draenor\" removed the Flexible mode, 10-player normal, 10-player heroic, 25-player normal, and 25-player heroic, bringing the six-tier levels into the current four (including the added Mythic mode). Essentially 10-player and 25-player were being merged back into single normal mode which auto-tunes itself between 10-25 players in the way Flexible raids did. The same applies to the heroic versions and even the Raid Finder. Mythic mode is the newly designed raid tier designed to be a 20-player mode for those that want an absolute challenge.\nLegacy raids.\nLegacy raids are available in four sizes: 10 man, 10 man heroic, 25 man, and 25 man heroic. These reflect the changes made in 3.2 during \"&lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;Wrath of the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;\" to enable more flexibility over the fixed raid sizes in the original game and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;The Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;\".\nEarly history.\nUntil \"Wrath of the Lich King\", most raids did not have variable difficulty or other settings, and raids had a fixed size. In &lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;Vanilla&lt;/a&gt;, different raid instances had different sizes: the four most famous of which held 40 raiders. However, &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Blackrock%20Spire%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Upper Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt; had 10 people, while &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Gurub%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Zul'Gurub&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ruins of Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt; had 20. Similarly most of the raids in \"The Burning Crusade\" had 25 people, with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Karazhan%20%28raid%29\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman%20%28BC%20Classic%29\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt;, which had 10. The smaller size raids were sometimes considered to be easier, due to their lesser requirements and lower gear requirements.\nFixed raids would start to change with \"Wrath\", and the raid leader could change the difficulty of the encounters in a dungeon as a new setting. Each raid was designed to be fought in \"both\" 10 and 25 man raid sizes and each size of raid was originally considered a different difficulty as the bosses had more health, stats, and dropped better loot. All \"Burning Crusade\" and original \"Wrath\" raids introduced before &lt;a href=\"patch%203.2.0\"&gt;patch 3.2.0&lt;/a&gt; were considered to use &lt;a href=\"10-player%20mode\"&gt;10-player mode&lt;/a&gt; for the former &lt;a href=\"normal%20mode\"&gt;normal mode&lt;/a&gt; (10 man raids) or &lt;a href=\"25-player%20mode\"&gt;25-player mode&lt;/a&gt; for the the former &lt;a href=\"heroic%20mode\"&gt;heroic mode&lt;/a&gt; (25 man raids), and this size setting was controlled by the &lt;a href=\"Dungeon%20difficulty\"&gt;Dungeon difficulty&lt;/a&gt; setting. It was originally considered that this setting also determined whether a raid was on &lt;a href=\"normal%20mode\"&gt;normal mode&lt;/a&gt; (10 man raid) or on &lt;a href=\"heroic%20mode\"&gt;heroic mode&lt;/a&gt; (25 man raid). This definition can be shown in certain quests from the time, such as . This usage is not to be confused with &lt;a href=\"elite%20mode\"&gt;elite mode&lt;/a&gt; events /actions within the same raids, which were available earlier in Ulduar (patch 3.1). Algalon is an elite boss but can still be fought on 10 man, resulting in &lt;a href=\"Algalon%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Algalon (quest)&lt;/a&gt;.\n3.2 and Introduction of 10 Man Heroic.\nAt the time of the formal introduction of raid difficulties, all newer raids beginning with the &lt;a href=\"Crusaders%27%20Coliseum\"&gt;Crusaders' Coliseum&lt;/a&gt; can use the &lt;a href=\"10-player%20heroic%20mode\"&gt;10-player heroic mode&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"25-player%20heroic%20mode\"&gt;25-player heroic mode&lt;/a&gt; settings to access harder versions of the raids, However, each of the four combinations of raid size and difficulty dropped a different quality of loot.\n\"Note: If a heroic raid mode is selected, the previous raids which did not use this new feature will still be launched in the selected size (10 or 25-man).\"\n&lt;a href=\"Patch%203.3.0\"&gt;Patch 3.3.0&lt;/a&gt; brought new changes to dungeon difficulty settings, allowing them to be changed for each boss in the raid if desired. Therefore a combination of normal and heroic encounters could be fought.\nStandardisation.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Mists%20of%20Pandaria\"&gt;Mists of Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;\", loot would be standardized between raid sizes; for example, 10-man Heroic and 25-man Heroic gear would be of equal Heroic quality. A third raid difficulty, &lt;a href=\"Raid%20Finder\"&gt;Raid Finder&lt;/a&gt; or \"Looking for Raid\" would be introduced with its own lower quality of loot below 10-man Normal, starting in &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt; and continuing through \"Mists of Pandaria\" and later expansions since. Finally, in &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; the first &lt;a href=\"Flexible%20Raid\"&gt;Flexible Raid&lt;/a&gt; system was introduced. Unlike previous raid sizes and difficulties, Flex would scale encounters for between 10 and 30 players, with difficulty requirements placed in between Raid Finder and normal mode. Thus, there would be four difficulties for Siege of Orgrimmar during 2013 - LFR, Flex, Normal, and Heroic.\nThese four difficulties would pave the way for the modern system used \"Warlords of Draenor\" and future expansions, albeit with some renaming and restructuring. While there would still be four levels of difficulty, the maximum difficulty of Siege of Orgrimmar was retroactively renamed to \"Mythic\" in &lt;a href=\"Patch%206.0.2\"&gt;Patch 6.0.2&lt;/a&gt;, along with the introduction of the \"Mythic\" term as the highest difficulty for all new raids in future. The name for Flex as a separate difficulty was removed, the feature being instead applied to all non-Mythic raids. The two subsequent difficulties below Mythic were instead renamed to Heroic and Normal. And finally, LFR would keep its name as before as the fourth difficulty. These difficulties are hence LFR, Normal, Heroic, and Mythic. Each difficulty has its own quality of loot.\nHowever as noted above, the older systems are still used in-game for the \"Legacy raid difficulty\" setting, primarily for Cataclysm and older raids."}

{"id": "14092", "revid": "22514", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=14092", "title": "Raid group", "text": "A raid group is a large group of &lt;a href=\"Player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;s made up of up to 8 &lt;a href=\"party\"&gt;parties&lt;/a&gt; of 5 players each intended to allow adventuring in areas (mostly difficult &lt;a href=\"instance\"&gt;instance&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt;) needing large groups. Members of this group only get &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"loot\"&gt;loot&lt;/a&gt; from actions in their local party, unless the experience or loot results from a &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt;-based &lt;a href=\"quest\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;.\nJoining/leaving a raid group.\nTo join a raid group you are invited by the raid leader (or the leader's assistants) just like joining a party. The raid leader will then assign you to a party within the raid group.\nTo leave a raid group you simply leave your current party.\nUnlike normal parties, you will \"not\" leave the raid by logging out.\nChat in a raid group.\nAll members of a raid can talk to each other using codice_1 (or just codice_2).\nYou can also talk to the members of your party within the raid group normally (using codice_3).\nAs of &lt;a href=\"patch%201.11\"&gt;patch 1.11&lt;/a&gt;, the Raid leader and his/her assistants are able to use the raid warning command codice_4. This is used the same way as any other chat channel except that this appears in the middle of the screen with an \"into focus\" text effect for instant commanding of all members of the raid, playing a sound effect in the process. This style was later added for various gameplay warnings and notices in Wrath of the Lich King (the most notable example being the &lt;a href=\"No-fly%20zone\"&gt;No-fly zone&lt;/a&gt; warning a player receives when flying over &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;).\nRaid group management.\nMany raid groups are formed from guilds. This means that using the pre-existing guild tools raids can be scheduled and announced to fit with the raid timers.\nMost serious raid groups have a website associated with them and this again helps with the organizing of raids and also has the added benefit of allowing a medium for applicants to apply to the group.\nIn the game itself many serious raid groups use modified interfaces and game files to further organize their raid. As of patch 1.10 many of these modifications were disabled by blizzard however many mod developers still have tools available to players who want to take on the high end raid instances and particularly providing help with the scripted battles that may have particularly difficult stages that logistically cause raid leaders many problems. Omen is a good tool for threat management and BigWigs is great for end raid instances.\nHowever in the default Blizzard interface pressing codice_5 on the keyboard brings up your social panel and on the raid window many features are available. Firstly you can organize the raid groups by dragging the members around the window into the slots available. (Dropping a player on top of another will swap the two players). Dragging the name of the group (in yellow at the top of the group) off the raid window will put a status bar of that particular group into the main game screen.\nRaid group setup.\nA raid leader should arrange the players within the raid to make optimum use of effects that benefit the group they will be in. This strengthens the overall group, and can be essential to beating hard encounters. What follows are some general guidelines; specific encounters may have requirements of their own.\nClass abilities that benefit a party.\n\"Abilities that directly benefit the player's own group, rather than outside groups, such as targetable buffs or spells.\"\nGroup types and classes.\nMain tank group.\nThis group will usually have the highest priority for a raid leader. Ensuring that the &lt;a href=\"main%20tank\"&gt;main tank&lt;/a&gt; receives all possible beneficial auras and effects will help the tank survive better, increasing the chances of success. A typical group would consist of:\nThere are many variations on this arrangement depending on the encounter. &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Core\"&gt;Molten Core&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blackwing%20Lair\"&gt;Blackwing Lair&lt;/a&gt; will typically require a paladin or shaman providing fire resistance. &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Temple of Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt; may need a hunter giving nature resistance. Reducing the damage the tank takes through Devotion aura or appropriate totems will be the primary considerations for this group. A druid in &lt;a href=\"Tree%20of%20Life%20Form\"&gt;Tree of Life Form&lt;/a&gt; can boost the healing the main tank receives.\nPhysical DPS groups.\nGenerally, each physical DPS group will have at least one warrior providing battle shout, and one marksmanship hunter providing trueshot aura. Hunters without trueshot should preferably be placed with one that does. DPS Paladins can use &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Sanctity%20Aura\"&gt;Improved Sanctity Aura&lt;/a&gt; which increases the groups damage by 12%. A shaman can assist with totems such as Windfury, Grace of Air or &lt;a href=\"Tranquil%20Air%20Totem%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Tranquil Air Totem (Classic)&lt;/a&gt;. If a feral druid is in the raid and not needed for healing, they can provide a strong damage boost in feral form. Where encounters require, a member may be added to provide resistance auras. A priest for &lt;a href=\"Prayer%20of%20Healing\"&gt;Prayer of Healing&lt;/a&gt; can be helpful if the group is taking damage (rogues often take significant cleave/&lt;a href=\"AOE\"&gt;AOE&lt;/a&gt; damage in fights.)\nCaster groups.\nMages and warlocks benefit from having a Moonkin form druid in the group for extra DPS, if one is available. A paladin with concentration aura can prevent spell interruption in encounters where casters face AOE damage. A shaman might also use &lt;a href=\"Tranquil%20Air%20Totem%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Tranquil Air Totem (Classic)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mana%20Tide%20Totem\"&gt;Mana Tide Totem&lt;/a&gt;. A priest for &lt;a href=\"Prayer%20of%20Healing\"&gt;Prayer of Healing&lt;/a&gt; can be helpful if the group is taking damage.\nHealer groups.\nHealers can benefit from paladins for concentration aura, and shamans with &lt;a href=\"Mana%20Tide%20Totem\"&gt;Mana Tide Totem&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Tranquil%20Air%20Totem%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Tranquil Air Totem&lt;/a&gt;s. So long as healers use a functional Raid UI, there is normally no need for them to be in the same group as the players they are assigned to heal. Group heals such as Prayer of Healing and Tranquility are nice, but should be weighed against the benefit from other abilities that can be provided.\nRaid comp.\nRaid composition (raid comp for short) refers to the different specs and classes in a raid which through class synergies contribute to the success of the raid. This can be analyzed via an addon and a much-used webpage on MMO-Champion."}

Some orc raiders are capable of fighting on foot as well, supported by their &lt;a href=\"Dire%20wolf\"&gt;dire wolves&lt;/a&gt; companions. Many other &lt;a href=\"murlocs\"&gt;races&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blackwater%20Raiders\"&gt;organizations&lt;/a&gt; raid for plunder but are not to be considered in the same way than in orcish culture.\nHistory.\nRise of the Horde.\n&lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grommash Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; led the wolf riders of his &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20clan\"&gt;Warsong clan&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Gorian%20Empire\"&gt;Gorian Empire&lt;/a&gt; in bold hit-and-run attacks.\nFirst War.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, the raiders were the most vicious of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Orcish hordes&lt;/a&gt;, these minions of &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; were trained to show no mercy. Riders of the &lt;a href=\"Darkwolf\"&gt;darkwolves&lt;/a&gt;, these savage warriors used the speed and ferocity of their mounts to make them a deadly enemy. Faster than those who attacked on foot, they had perfected the tactics of tearing through columns of enemy soldiers like a hot wind.\nAs an &lt;a href=\"organization\"&gt;organization&lt;/a&gt;, they were referred to as the &lt;a href=\"Sythegore%20Arm\"&gt;Sythegore Arm&lt;/a&gt; and Blackhand himself was a prominent member. It is unknown whether the &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20clan\"&gt;Frostwolf clan&lt;/a&gt;, also known for their proximity with wolves, were a part of the Sythegore Arm or a rival organization. The Frostwolves were exiled by &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; for refusing to submit to demonic corruption and possibly didn't disband their raider corps.\nSecond War.\nWhen rumors that the wolf raiders of the Horde intended to betray &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; to Blackhand's sons: &lt;a href=\"Rend%20Blackhand\"&gt;Rend&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Maim%20Blackhand\"&gt;Maim&lt;/a&gt;, came to light, Gul'dan had Orgrim disband the vast majority of them, and subsequently replaced them with &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt; enforcers.\nThe majority of the former wolfriders were then sent into the various arms of the &lt;a href=\"grunt\"&gt;grunt&lt;/a&gt; forces. Other raiders remained in &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;; where they ultimately fell under the dominion of &lt;a href=\"Fenris%20Wolfbrother\"&gt;Fenris the Hunter&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Thunderlord%20clan\"&gt;Thunderlord clan&lt;/a&gt;. By the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, raiders were thus extremely rare within the ranks of the Orcish Horde.\nThird War.\nAfter many years of inactivity, the young &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; decided to create a new generation of wolf riders. These mighty warriors carry hefty warblades into combat and rely greatly upon the cunning and ferocity of their faithful dire-wolf mounts to defeat their enemies.\nThrall's head of security, &lt;a href=\"Nazgrel\"&gt;Nazgrel&lt;/a&gt;, was one of the most prominent member of this new generation of raiders. It is possible that the return of the Frostwolf clan itself under the banner of the Horde gave a renewed presence to raiders during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome raiders got corrupted into &lt;a href=\"Fel%20Orc%20Raider\"&gt;Fel Orc Raider&lt;/a&gt;s in northern Kalimdor and on Outland.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nRaiders can also be found in the ranks of the other Hordes, such as the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Horde\"&gt;Dark Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt;. The mounted raiders of the &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20clan%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Warsong orcs&lt;/a&gt; favor speed and maneuverability in battle \u2014 they move quickly, strike swiftly, and are away before their enemies know what hit them.\nIn the RPG.\n\"Howling and barking in harmony with his lupine steed, the wolf-rider holds one hand on his reins, the other lifting an evil-looking blade above his head. At his side, several nets rest on the wolf\u2019s flank, ready to be thrown at attractive prey\"\nOrc &lt;a href=\"mounted%20warrior\"&gt;mounted warrior&lt;/a&gt;s are called raider or wolf rider.\nA raider is among the most feared members of the Horde, for he can strike at any time, relying on the stealth of his steed and his skill with nets to entrap his prey. It\u2019s unlikely he\u2019ll be encountered in a pitched battle, but when the Horde wishes to raid supplies or send a force to pursue a routed army, he will be sent out of his kennel, and the Alliance will know fear. Raiders are swift shock troopers, adept at outflanking enemies to strike at vulnerable war machines, spellcasters, supply lines and buildings. Under a capable commander, raiders save their nets to ensnare flying prey; but if left to their own, raiders are notoriously trigger happy with their nets, frustratingly wasting them against enemies who really don\u2019t need to be netted.\nOrc raiders tear paths through tough opposition, often leaping through the lines of battle to cripple stronger foes, and create channels where raging death can flow. On Draenor, orcs tamed and rode dire wolves, and the cleaver-like blades of these raiders are just as deadly as any knight\u2019s lance."}

Now, after many long years, the young &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; has decided to train a new generation. These mighty warriors carry hefty warblades into combat and rely greatly upon the cunning and ferocity of their faithful Wolf mounts to defeat their enemies.\nInformation.\nRaiders, as their name suggests, specialize in raiding the enemy by destroying their buildings. They possess fairly high health with a siege melee attack, making them the mobile counterpart of the Human &lt;a href=\"Steam%20Tank%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Steam Tank&lt;/a&gt;. Before sending out Raiders to harass enemy settlements, it is important to research Pillage so that the Raiders generate resources while attacking enemy buildings. The resources gained from pillaging allow for further research or additional units in the army, especially as many players usually won't have towers defending their town hall early/midway through a game. \nRaiders can also learn Ensnare, which allows them to net an enemy unit. Ensnared enemies cannot perform any action other than attacking and casting spells, which allows them to grab any fleeing enemies or stop workers from repairing buildings. Ensnared air units will be brought to the ground and can be attacked by melee units.\nUnfortunately, Raiders aren't suitable for anything else due to their siege melee attack which deals reduced damage against non-fortified armor types. They also have medium type armor which makes them die fairly fast to other units. \nIf the map contains a Goblin Laboratory, Raiders work especially well with the aid of &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20Zeppelin%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Goblin Zeppelin&lt;/a&gt;s as it allows them to bypass enemy buildings who may surround their town hall to make aiming it harder. However, additional aerial units should be brought alongside the zeppelins so that they are less likely to be destroyed.\nSpells and abilities.\nnsnare.\nEnsnare works on all enemy units, including Heroes (although with shorter duration). Ensnare works similarly to the &lt;a href=\"Crypt%20Fiend%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Crypt Fiend&lt;/a&gt;'s Web ability, but Ensnare can hit any target, although the unit can still attack any unit in range. Use Ensnare on melee units. This will temporarily stop them from moving around as easily and prevents them from using their bulk to tank incoming attacks. \nEnsnare also works on enemy workers, which will stop them from repairing buildings if they are doing so. Use it on them when the enemy attempts to repair a building.\nPillage also works on buildings even if the enemy left the match (and would turn them into a neutral passive-hostile faction). Many players in large free-for-all matches generally ignore destroying them, which means free resources for the Raiders.\nManual description.\nThe marauding, wolf-riding raiders were once considered to be the most honored warriors of the horde. Yet, just prior to the Second War, Gul'dan disbanded the raiders. Now, after many long years, the young warchief Thrall has decided to train a new generation of wolf riders. These mighty warriors carry hefty warblades into combat and rely greatly upon the cunning and ferocity of their faithful dire-wolf mounts to defeat their enemies."}

{"id": "72508", "revid": "22514", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=72508", "title": "Raiding for newbies", "text": "\"Raiding\" in this article means \"running &lt;a href=\"instance\"&gt;instance&lt;/a&gt;s with 20 or more people\". Technically a group of 10 constitutes a raid too, but needs much less organization, devotion and discipline than the bigger raids. For this reason, 10 player raids can be mastered by pickup groups with \"normal\" gear, while &lt;a href=\"pickup%20group\"&gt;pickup group&lt;/a&gt;s in larger instances usually need a few highly skilled and overgeared members.\nA sample career.\nAt start, new players usually spend a lot of time playing alone or questing in small groups of fewer than five players. Sooner or later, the next step is to run small instances with &lt;a href=\"group\"&gt;group&lt;/a&gt;s of five (the &lt;a href=\"Instance%20grouping%20guide\"&gt;Instance grouping guide&lt;/a&gt; helps mastering this style of play). Upon reaching the maximum level, many choices are open. The world of &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt; can be explored, it's possible to continue playing solo, and there are many options available for group &lt;a href=\"PvE\"&gt;PvE&lt;/a&gt;. For small groups there are the &lt;a href=\"heroic\"&gt;heroic&lt;/a&gt; five-man instances, and groups of 10 can enter the world of raids.\nThe culmination of the PvE &lt;a href=\"endgame\"&gt;endgame&lt;/a&gt; is the 25 player raids. Prior to WLK, only a few players got there; for example, only about half the number of players who killed a boss in &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt; ever killed a 25 player boss, and less than 5% defeated the final boss of the expansion (&lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;). In vanilla WoW, less than 2% of all players ever entered Naxxramas (the original version).\nWith the changes in WLK, hardmodes now are the pinnacle of raiding. All other content has become very accessible and is regularly cleared by pickup groups. Due to this development raiding has become much more commonplace, and the following rules have lost much of their exclusivity and some of their importance.\nDuring vanilla and TBC, successful raiding depended on a dedicated player base, because progress was only possible with well-practised tactics and a good organized raid. Since WLK, raids rather face problems like gear elitism (\" minimum gearscore xx, link achievement\"), which basically amounts to beating the encounters by outgearing them, not by proper tactics.\nThe following text is about progress raiding, that is with a group which does not outgear the instance. In effect, this means 25 player hard modes, or 25 player normal modes for raids which really strive for progress.\nGolden Rule.\nProgress raiding is a long term team effort. Have patience, and be a good team player.\nMotivation.\nVery good gear can be obtained with comparative ease by completing the daily badge quest, farming the 10 player versions and the occasional 25 player run. Gear obtained this way is just one tier below the best stuff available, and (compared to vanilla/TBC) with rather low effort.\nThe remaining PvE challenge are the 25 player hardmodes. The motivation for trying this is not gear, but rather the wish to master something really difficult. It's about building and maintaining a team, a close-knit group of players who progress together. The most happy raid members are those who join a run because they like the challenge of the encounters, no matter whether it's a &lt;a href=\"wipe\"&gt;wipe&lt;/a&gt; night, a first kill or a &lt;a href=\"farming\"&gt;farming&lt;/a&gt; run.\nPeople with selfish goals, especially when it comes to loot, usually don't find much pleasure in raids. If some kind of formalized &lt;a href=\"loot%20distribution%20system\"&gt;loot distribution system&lt;/a&gt; (like &lt;a href=\"DKP\"&gt;DKP&lt;/a&gt;) is not used, epic loot is normally distributed on the basis of what's best for the raid's future success, and not what's optimal for an individual player.\nThere is a fine line between personal goals (\"I want to have fun\") and group goals (\"We want to kill that boss\"), but (as in many real life group environments), these goals don't need to be at odds. If it's good for the group's success, even yielding some item (or another advantage) to somebody else can be fun. So be polite and don't put personal goals over those of the whole raid (see the golden rule above).\nNew players should ask themselves the following questions before joining a progress raid group:\nOnly people willing to answer each of these questions with a loud and clear \"yes\" should seriously consider raiding. It takes a lot of effort, and the rewards are scarce.\nFinding a raid.\nThe most common and easiest method to start raiding is to find a raiding &lt;a href=\"guild\"&gt;guild&lt;/a&gt; with an open spot. It's actually quite frequent that raiding guilds are looking for new members, because they lost some old hand. Blizzards realm forums are a very good starting point. If no guilds are currently recruiting, it can't hurt to write a general application there, and all guilds also consider serious applications even when they're not actively looking for new members. The alternative would be to try and start a new raiding guild.\nIn order to have a good chance to get an invite to a raiding guild, the following technical aspects can help:\nThe last point is really important and works both ways. A dedicated, reliable and serious player should look for a serious raiding guild, while casual or fun oriented future raiders should look for a more &lt;a href=\"casual\"&gt;casual&lt;/a&gt; guild. Matching player and guild character is actually not so much a question of gear, the more progressed guilds are usually aware that it's hard to gear up beyond a certain level without an opportunity to raid.\nA somewhat related aspect is that of chosen role and &lt;a href=\"spec\"&gt;spec&lt;/a&gt;. Progress oriented guilds used to have rather tight \"job descriptions\", when they wanted a healing druid, they were usually not interested in a holy paladin. Similarly, serious raid groups usually had only a limited number of \"Off-spec\" spots (like elemental shaman, retribution paladin), some spec might not have been accepted at all. These rules were rather strict in vanilla (where each class usually had exactly one raid-capable spec), became softer in TBC (when most classes had 2 or 3 raid specs), and have all but vanished with WLK. Since 3.0.1, it's even desirable to have many different combinations of class and spec in a raid, because nearly every such combination can contribute some unique ability to the raid.\nOnly the best of the top guilds, those competing for first kills, are still concerned about class and spec. The only challenge which remains when composing a raid is to find the appropriate numbers of tanks, healers and damage dealers (the \"default\" being 2-3 tanks, 5-6 healers and 16-18 damage dealers). Individual players' capabilities are nowadays much more important than class or spec. Knowledge of boss fights is paramount, as is the players' ability to get the maximum threat, healing, or DPS possible with their current equipment for tanks, healers, and DPS respectively. This is particularly important in fights where one player's ignorance can easily lead to a wipe - encounters such as &lt;a href=\"Thaddius\"&gt;Thaddius&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; are particularly notable examples of this.\nHierarchy.\nIn 5- or 10-man groups, a single leader can do all the management necessary - one person can organize healing, tanking and target assignment without there being much danger that something is forgotten or out of sync. In a raid the tasks are much more complicated and specialized, and sometimes require detailed knowledge of class (or build) capabilities, so that actually quite a lot of the management tasks get delegated to \"officers\", and the raid leader himself mainly focuses on keeping things synchronized. As all hierarchies, this structure can either be maintained out of necessity, because it makes things easier and better organized, or it can be used as a means of suppression. For beginning raiders it's sometimes hard to distinguish these two forms.\nNormally there are a few extra chat channels set up, for example one channel for healers, one for warlocks and mages, another for hunters, and one for all melee classes. Each of these channels should have one leader, and these leaders join the officer channel where they discuss (together with the raid leader) overall strategy and synchronization.\nBehavior.\nUnless the task at hand is totally routine (e.g., the 20th MC run before the lava packs), chat should be kept to a minimum. Raids are not a good place to get to know the other members. There are too many people, and there's too little time. When it comes to tactics, beginners should really be careful and first try to understand how this particular raid works. Although on many bosses there are widely accepted \"standard\" strategies, some raids may do things differently and still have success. It is not a good idea to try to teach things to long term raid members, justified as it may be. Discussions should not take place during a raid. If there are any issues they should be discussed later with the relevant officer in /w or in some forum, not during the raid.\nGood methods to annoy other raid members (and the leader in particular) are to predict doom and failure before the pull even begins or to declare \"wipe\" when just a few people are dead. It is important for the success of the raid to stay positive, especially when learning new content. A good mantra is \"Wiping is fun\" (meditate about that - it really helps). So whenever anger about a bad run wells up, just think of how fun wiping is!\nRaid Gear.\nRaids are the only environment where damage dealers really need a lot of +hit gear. The raid &lt;a href=\"boss\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt;es are 3 levels higher than the level cap, and thus in order to maximize damage output +hit rating is a viable stat. Until the hit cap is reached, hit is the most efficient way of increasing damage output; still, it's not infinitely more valuable than other stats (see &lt;a href=\"Hit\"&gt;Hit&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=\"Spell%20hit\"&gt;Spell hit&lt;/a&gt;). For mana users, endurance may be important, particularly for healers. Every mana user must be able to sustain a 10 minute fight. Tanks (and to a lesser extent everybody else) may need many different sets of armor to adapt to different situations (e.g. high resistance, high avoidance or high threat).\nWiping and wipe recovery.\nA &lt;a href=\"Wipe\"&gt;Wipe&lt;/a&gt; happens when all members of the raid are dead. Part of the challenge of raiding is to recover from this and get moving again quickly. Quick and efficient &lt;a href=\"wipe%20recovery\"&gt;wipe recovery&lt;/a&gt; helps to increase the raids success. While learning a new encounter, wipes usually happen every 15\u201320 minutes, thus in a 3-hour raid (assuming 15 minutes) a raid that takes only 5 minutes to recover gets 9 tries at the encounter, whereas a raid that needs 15 minutes only gets 6 tries. For this reason, new members should quickly find out under which circumstances they are supposed to release, when they should self-rez, and when not. If capable of self or combat rez, new players should always ask the raid leader whether to use it.\nLoot.\nThe drops are usually distributed by a loot master during a raid. The loot rules are normally agreed on beforehand. Most raiding groups use some kind of formalized &lt;a href=\"loot%20system\"&gt;loot system&lt;/a&gt; (with varying degrees of freedom, politics and bureaucracy involved). Drops which are of no immediate use (like Crystals from disenchanted epics, other crafting materials or &lt;a href=\"BOE\"&gt;BOE&lt;/a&gt; items which nobody currently wants) usually go to the &lt;a href=\"guild%20bank\"&gt;guild bank&lt;/a&gt;. Newbies need to be prudent once more, but there's no reason to despair - even if things look like it's impossible to ever get anything, it's actually quite common that there are many items which nobody else \"wants\", so newbies usually gear up quite fast. Of course, getting the top of the line drops takes much more patience. \nFollowing WotLK's release, raiding content has become far more accessible to &lt;a href=\"pickup%20group\"&gt;pickup group&lt;/a&gt;s, and the most common strategy to distribute loot in PUGs is to set the loot rules to loot master, and have the leader call for rolls in a priority order. If no one is eligible or wants to roll in one priority order, next priority order is called. Rolls are done by typing \"/roll 100\" in the chat box. This is a slightly finer-grained variation of the need/greed system.\nTypically, roll order is as follows:\n-Main-spec roll: Only roll if the item is an upgrade over the currently equipped piece.\n-Off-spec roll: If no one's main spec can use the item, then players with a secondary role can go ahead and roll.\n-Disenchant/Greed: If, by some misfortune, no one can use the loot or the loot is bind on equip, everyone can roll on the item or, if at all possible, the result of disenchanting for BoP items. Some groups also stipulate that only people who have not won any loot in the current raid should roll by this point(particularly if a piece of loot is useful to every player or 25-man runs)"}

These races speak many different &lt;a href=\"language\"&gt;language&lt;/a&gt;s, have different homelands and &lt;a href=\"Racial%20Traits\"&gt;racial traits&lt;/a&gt;, and can pursue different &lt;a href=\"class\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt;es.

Though species is usually reserved for non-sapient creatures such as &lt;a href=\"wolf\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt;, or non-humanoid creatures like &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;s, the term is occasionally used to refer to races like elves, dwarves, humans, orcs, draenei, ogres, goblins, tauren, etc. Such uses are rare, however, and entirely absent in newer material such as . Only the non-canon &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20RPG\"&gt;Warcraft RPG&lt;/a&gt; uses \"species\" with any consistency.\nIn the RPG.\nIn Warcraft lore, race is often used interchangeably with species. Occasionally, within a race/species are groups called subspecies/subraces Note that use of race may not always denote separate species however (and may refer to ethnicities/subraces/subspecies within species).\n\"Subraces\".\nSubraces (aka subspecies) are generally considered smaller groups within a main race/species.

They appear under several species like the massive &lt;a href=\"C%27Thrax\"&gt;C'Thrax&lt;/a&gt;xi, larger and more resilient than their lesser brethren. and the smaller &lt;a href=\"K%27thir\"&gt;K'thir&lt;/a&gt; able to infiltrate and manipulate mortals.\nAqir.\nLike he n'raqi, the aqir born from the same organic matter that seeped from the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s. The incredibly strong and resilient insectoid were employed as laborers by the faceless ones and were forced to build temple cities and towering citadels around their masters' massive bulks.\nAfter the war between the &lt;a href=\"Empire%20of%20Zul\"&gt;Empire of Zul&lt;/a&gt; and the subterranean empire of &lt;a href=\"Azj%27Aqir\"&gt;Azj'Aqir&lt;/a&gt; around 16,000 years ago, the trolls finally succeeded in winning a victory of attrition, and Azj'Aqir was shattered. Three distinct groups of aqir managed to survive the destruction of their empire. The ones in the north congregated around the underground prison of the Old God &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt;, evolving into the &lt;a href=\"nerubian\"&gt;nerubian&lt;/a&gt; race and establishing the kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Azjol-Nerub%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Azjol-Nerub&lt;/a&gt;. The ones in the southwest remained inside Ahn'Qiraj, where the energies of the Old God &lt;a href=\"C%27Thun\"&gt;C'Thun&lt;/a&gt; warped them into a race known as the &lt;a href=\"qiraji\"&gt;qiraji&lt;/a&gt;. During the later stages of the war, one group had also fled to the southeast. Drawn towards the lingering energies of the dead Old God &lt;a href=\"Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;Y'Shaarj&lt;/a&gt;, these aqir took up the name &lt;a href=\"mantid\"&gt;mantid&lt;/a&gt; and founded the colony of &lt;a href=\"Manti%27vess\"&gt;Manti'vess&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; once claimed that, according to &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt; records, the &lt;a href=\"qiraji\"&gt;qiraji&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"nerubian\"&gt;nerubian&lt;/a&gt;s split off from the aqir later, that the &lt;a href=\"silithid\"&gt;silithid&lt;/a&gt; are in fact descendants of the qiraji, not the other way around, and that the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20of%20Ages\"&gt;Tribunal of Ages&lt;/a&gt; states that insects and spiders are descended from the aqir, from the silithid and the nerubians respectively. However, ancient legends contradict this, stating that the silithid were the first to emerge, and the aforementioned records also stated that the Old Gods made the &lt;a href=\"aqir\"&gt;aqir&lt;/a&gt; from something else, something that was later proven false since it has been proven that tribunal is a false system created by &lt;a href=\"Loken\"&gt;Loken&lt;/a&gt; and is not an accurate record of historical fact.\nAzeroth native species.\nDragons.\nThe &lt;a href=\"proto-dragon\"&gt;proto-dragon&lt;/a&gt;s were sort of the early version before dragons really evolved into the sapient, beautiful majestic creatures that they are known today. &lt;a href=\"Galakrond\"&gt;Galakrond&lt;/a&gt;, a massive proto-dragon, was the \"progenitor of dragonkind\". From him, the &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt;s created the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspect\"&gt;Aspects&lt;/a&gt;. Originally, there were many different &lt;a href=\"dragonflight\"&gt;dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;s, with many different colors to be seen. The five most influential, however, were the &lt;a href=\"red%20dragonflight\"&gt;reds&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"green%20dragonflight\"&gt;greens&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"bronze%20dragonflight\"&gt;bronze&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;blacks&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blues&lt;/a&gt;, and eventually most (if not all) of the other flights disappeared. Chosen by the titans, each of the five dragonflights were given domain over a certain aspect of the world, ranging from the earth to time itself. However, over the time several new dragonflights were artifically created. \nAfter the titans showed &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt; his own death as the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Infinite%20dragonflight\"&gt;Infinite Dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Murozond\"&gt;Murozond&lt;/a&gt;, the tormented Nozdormu was tricked by the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s into trying to subvert his mortality. Since Nozdormu had not figured out how to stop himself from becoming the leader of the Infinite Dragonflight and did not wish to become it he will at some point in the future shatter the timeways and will create the infinite dragonflight in order to prevent it. The &lt;a href=\"Netherwing%20Dragonflight\"&gt;Netherwing Dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; is an unusual brood of translucent &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;s whose bodies are composed of energies from the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;. The Netherwing dragonflight were spawned from the eggs of &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Black%20dragonflight\"&gt;Black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, and were infused with raw nether-energies when &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; was torn apart. The &lt;a href=\"chromatic%20dragonflight\"&gt;chromatic dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; was created by &lt;a href=\"Nefarian\"&gt;Nefarian&lt;/a&gt;'s magical experiments, using the blood of dragons from the other dragonflights. These experiments were largely considered failures; many &lt;a href=\"chromatic%20whelp\"&gt;whelp&lt;/a&gt;s died before hatching, and those that survived were unstable, short-lived, volatile, and/or deformed. The successful specimens, however, were very powerful and wielded the abilities of all five flights. The &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20dragonflight\"&gt;Twilight dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; is a dragonflight created by the results of magical experiments carried out by &lt;a href=\"Sintharia\"&gt;Sintharia&lt;/a&gt; upon dragon eggs. Using ancient dragon artifacts and the powers of the &lt;a href=\"nether%20dragon\"&gt;nether dragon&lt;/a&gt;s, Sintharia has created a new breed of dragons that feed vampirically on all forms of mystical energy.\n&lt;a href=\"Dragonspawn\"&gt;Dragonspawn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Drakonid\"&gt;Drakonid&lt;/a&gt;s are mortal races turned into half dragons by the flights. The process is not always voluntary, dragons seem also to abduct unwilling people and forcibly transform them. This is why there are so many black dragonspawn.\nTrolls and elves.\nThe trolls' history reaches back at least 16,000 years before the events of the First War. The &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20tribe\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; were one of the first troll tribes who also named the mountain Zandalar. Other tribes included the &lt;a href=\"Jungle%20troll\"&gt;jungle trolls&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20tribe\"&gt;Gurubashi tribe&lt;/a&gt; who lived in the lush jungles of the southeast, the &lt;a href=\"Forest%20troll\"&gt;forest trolls&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani tribe&lt;/a&gt; who lived in the verdant middle forestlands, and the &lt;a href=\"Ice%20troll\"&gt;ice trolls&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Drakkari%20tribe\"&gt;Drakkari tribe&lt;/a&gt; who lived in the frozen plateaus of the north. During the &lt;a href=\"Aqir%20and%20Troll%20War\"&gt;Aqir and Troll War&lt;/a&gt;, the disparate Zandalari,\u00a0Gurubashi,\u00a0Amani, and\u00a0Drakkari tribes united into the Empire of Zul to combat the Aqir threat. Following the trolls' victory over the &lt;a href=\"Azj%27Aqir\"&gt;Azj'Aqir&lt;/a&gt;, each tribe expanded their territories to cover every corner of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor%20%28landmass%29\"&gt;Ancient Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; and built empires out of their tribes, making sure that the now-dispersed Aqir would never regain the momentum to threaten the world again. Later, after the events of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, the Gurubashi trolls who lived in the then-jungles of Tanaris would find their territory turn into a desert, separated from the rest of their Empire, forcing them to adapt to their harsh environment by evolving into the &lt;a href=\"sand%20troll\"&gt;sand troll&lt;/a&gt;s.\n&lt;a href=\"Dark%20troll\"&gt;Dark troll&lt;/a&gt;s living in the vast subterranean networks of Mount Hyjal kept their affairs separate from the rest of the troll tribes. They hated the daylight and only emerged from their caverns at night. In time, these nocturnal habits turned their blue skin into hues of gray, becoming &lt;a href=\"dark%20troll\"&gt;dark troll&lt;/a&gt;s. Eventually, a group made their way to the shores of the mesmerizing &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; and, as they stared into its waters, sensed a great power. Over time, the Well's cosmic power transformed the trolls, making them strong, wise, and immortal. Their skin turned various shades of violet, and they grew taller in stature. The tribe adopted the name &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;kal'dorei&lt;/a&gt;, which meant \"children of the stars\" in their native tongue, and became what would later be known as the night elves. Their studies of the Well led them to discover arcane magic, which quickly allowed them to establish a strong empire, led by their &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; nobility. As the night elves claimed further territory, they came into conflict with the trolls in the area, who had long dominated much of ancient Kalimdor. Unable to master arcane magic quickly enough to counter the night elves' sudden and fierce attacks, the trolls were forced to retreat.\nThe night elven civilization reached its height with the reign of &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt;, but was suddenly and catastrophically shattered by the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"satyr\"&gt;satyr&lt;/a&gt; are the Highborne and their descendents who allied directly with the Burning Legion during the first invasion. These former elves were taken by the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s and twisted into shapes that more accurately reflected their nature. When the Well of Eternity imploded and sundered the world, many Highborne were trapped in the blast, however as their bodies were so infused with magic they did not die but were twisted by the powers they had released, influenced through the limited though still quite powerful will of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s. Azshara and her followers were dragged down beneath the raging sea, where, cursed and transformed, they took on new shapes to become the hateful serpentine &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the War of the Ancients, the remaining night elves turned away from the arcane magic that had brought about their downfall, instead focusing on a smaller, druid-based society. Many of the Highborne were shunned and exiled from night elf society, whereupon \u2014 disagreeing with their race's new direction \u2014 they left to form their own civilization across the Great Sea. This group would eventually form that nation of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; and evolve into the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt;. The remaining night elves tended to the lands of northern Kalimdor for ten thousand years, defending them against any who would seek to despoil the land. With the second coming of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the night elves came into contact with the other civilized races for the first time in several millennia, and with the loss of their immortality at the war's conclusion they have slowly spread out into the rest of the world.\nWhen Quel'Thalas and the vast majority of the high elven race was destroyed by the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, the survivors split into two factions. Many named themselves as sin'dorei or &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; in remembrance of their fallen brethren, and would soon become close allies to the &lt;a href=\"Naga\"&gt;Naga&lt;/a&gt;, and later still ally themselves with the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Others remained as high elves, disgusted by blood elven values. These stayed true to their old allies, the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, and are scattered among various &lt;a href=\"city\"&gt;cities&lt;/a&gt; where they are a clear minority. The &lt;a href=\"Felblood%20elf\"&gt;Felblood elves&lt;/a&gt; are an offshoot of the blood elf race that \u2014 like fel orcs before them \u2014 have been corrupted by the Burning Legion. Furthermore the &lt;a href=\"Wretched\"&gt;Wretched&lt;/a&gt; are elves (usually blood elves) that failed to control their magical addiction.\nThe birth of the blood elves was not without tribulation however, and they faced many threats from within and without that came close to destroying their race. A group of blood elves led by &lt;a href=\"Magister%20Umbric\"&gt;Magister Umbric&lt;/a&gt; delved into the magic arts of the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; in the hope of gaining its power to defend their people. However, they were banished by their blood elf brethren for their dangerous studies, and became exiles. Undaunted, these blood elves continued their research, and eventually met with &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, the only person known to have survived an encounter with the Void. Together, they managed to defeat the Nether-Prince Durzaan and unlocked the powers of the Void. These exiles were transformed by the powers they had consumed and were no longer blood elves as such, but had become a new race of &lt;a href=\"void%20elf\"&gt;void elves&lt;/a&gt;, or ren'dorei. Shedding their allegiance to the Horde after their past treatment at the hands of the blood elves, they pledged themselves to the Alliance instead.\nGoblins.\nIn ancient times, &lt;a href=\"Mimiron\"&gt;Mimiron&lt;/a&gt; experimented &lt;a href=\"kaja%27mite\"&gt;kaja'mite&lt;/a&gt; on various races to determine its properties. One of these subjects was a primitive race that roamed around the forests Near &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt;. By consuming kaja'mite, they were transformed into a new, highly intelligent race known as the &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s. The &lt;a href=\"Pygmy\"&gt;pygmies&lt;/a&gt; share a common ancestor with them. When the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt; happened, the goblins were cut from the kaja'mite supply. In just a few generations, their intelligence vanished. The goblins then took refuge on &lt;a href=\"Kezan\"&gt;Kezan&lt;/a&gt; and they had forgotten the influence of kaja'mite.\nAfter the Sundering, the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari troll&lt;/a&gt;s started exploring numerous islands that dotted the new sea. During one trips, they discovered Kezan and the goblin race, who were very primitive but still possessed some intellect. Initially, the Zandalari did not know very much about kaja'mite, but they were aware of its potency and saw it as a sacred component in their rituals and ceremonies. For many centuries the &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s mined and occasionally even paid goblins in order to work for them. But at some point, the Zandalari discovered an unimaginable deposit of kaja'mite underground. So rather than digging themselves, they enslaved the goblins and force them to drill. For thousands of years the goblins, too weak to resist, suffered under the rule of the trolls.\nOver time, the goblin workers breathed in the dust of the ore that clouded the mines and eventually started to awake the goblins' intelligence. Secretly they plotted to start a rebellion, gathering any materials they can find and hide in order to create weapons and explosives. One century before the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, the goblins masses stormed out from the mines and shattered completely troll's hold. The goblins, in order to celebrate their liberation, turned on each other and forming countless allegiances. Soon enough, they were split into various powerful groups were known as &lt;a href=\"Cartel\"&gt;cartels&lt;/a&gt;. As the battles were getting completely out of hand, the cartels brokered a truce. But the conflict would never really cease as the goblins would now turn to trade, battling in the economic arena. For the years to come the cartels were rivals, constantly outshining and outsmarting each other as they continued in their quest for wealth and power. \nGoblin alchemical experimentation later produced the &lt;a href=\"hobgoblin\"&gt;hobgoblin&lt;/a&gt;s. The &lt;a href=\"gilgoblin\"&gt;gilgoblin&lt;/a&gt; are a species of aquatic goblin created by &lt;a href=\"Hobart%20Grapplehammer\"&gt;Hobart Grapplehammer&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe creations of the Titans.\nGiants.\nThe giants are a species created by the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s. They were created in five types: &lt;a href=\"Fire%20giant\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Frost%20giant\"&gt;Frost&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sea%20giant\"&gt;Sea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Storm%20giant\"&gt;Storm&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Stone%20giant\"&gt;Stone&lt;/a&gt;. Most of them have been affected by the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Flesh\"&gt;Curse of Flesh&lt;/a&gt;, but it does not appear to have significantly diminished their power.\nThere are several more types of giant, many of which are of some form of stone or rock, and it is speculated that they are all the same type of giant.\nTroggs, earthen, and dwarves.\nWhen the Titans were shaping Azeroth, they also created the &lt;a href=\"Earthen\"&gt;Earthen&lt;/a&gt;. These beings of magical rock were meant to continue to shape Azeroth after the Titans left. The troggs, like the dwarves, are a mutation from the original earthen design, referenced by the disks of Norgannon. Although the troggs keep the physical toughness of their earthen heritage, they lose nearly all thought capacity and become dumb, short tempered and violent. The titans sealed these mutations away after realizing their uselessness to their cause. The &lt;a href=\"kobold\"&gt;kobold&lt;/a&gt;s are actually an evolved form of trogg, and the Mogu flesh-shaped troggs to create the &lt;a href=\"Grummle\"&gt;Grummle&lt;/a&gt;s. After the Well of Eternity erupted the Earthen sealed themselves off in their cities. Centuries later, some of the Earthen of &lt;a href=\"Uldaman\"&gt;Uldaman&lt;/a&gt; awoke to find that they had changed through the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s' &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Flesh\"&gt;Curse of Flesh&lt;/a&gt;. Their skin was soft and pink. They decided to leave to the surface, eventually finding the mountain of &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt; which they claimed as their new home. Within &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; they made a great altar to their creator Titan &lt;a href=\"Khaz%27goroth\"&gt;Khaz'goroth&lt;/a&gt;. It has been revealed that after discovering the Curse of Flesh, the Titans returned to amend it by creating a second version of the earthen, which would be immune to its effects. This explains why there are still earthen in Azeroth today.\nThe dwarves of Ironforge were originally of a single large clan, Ironforge clan, which was made of three clans: The &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammer clan&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard%20clan\"&gt;Bronzebeard clan&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;Dark Iron clan&lt;/a&gt;, with the Ruling High King &lt;a href=\"Modimus%20Anvilmar\"&gt;Modimus Anvilmar&lt;/a&gt; as the supreme leader. However, before the High King's eldest son could be crowned after his death, the dwarves were plunged into a civil war - the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;War of the Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, the Bronzebeard Clan won and banished the other two clans from Ironforge. The Wildhammers accepted their fate and built the city of Grim Batol in the South Wetlands, eventually re-establishing their friendship with the Bronzebeards. The Dark Iron Clan, however, were less forgiving and retreated to &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt; to plan their revenge. The &lt;a href=\"Skardyn\"&gt;Skardyn&lt;/a&gt; are the descendants of &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt; who had survived the Dark Iron siege of &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;, near the end of the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;War of the Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt;. The descendants of these Dark Irons were transformed into &lt;a href=\"skardyn\"&gt;skardyn&lt;/a&gt; by the evil inside Grim Batol, ironically caused by the curse of their ancestors' &lt;a href=\"sorceress\"&gt;sorceress&lt;/a&gt; queen &lt;a href=\"Modgud\"&gt;Modgud&lt;/a&gt;.\nGnomes.\nThe first &lt;a href=\"mechagnome\"&gt;mechagnome&lt;/a&gt;s were created by the &lt;a href=\"Titanic%20watcher\"&gt;Titanic watcher&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mimiron\"&gt;Mimiron&lt;/a&gt; (some of whom called him \"The Grand Architect\") within &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt;, apparently as servants and caretakers much like the &lt;a href=\"earthen\"&gt;earthen&lt;/a&gt;. Some mechagnomes eventually became &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;s due to the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Flesh\"&gt;Curse of Flesh&lt;/a&gt;, just as happened to the &lt;a href=\"Earthen\"&gt;Earthen&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Leper%20gnome\"&gt;Leper gnome&lt;/a&gt;s are a diseased, twisted, and mutated race of gnomes who wander through the irradiated halls of &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt;.\nVrykul and humans.\nThe titans created the &lt;a href=\"iron%20vrykul\"&gt;iron vrykul&lt;/a&gt; in order to assist the &lt;a href=\"tol%27vir\"&gt;tol'vir&lt;/a&gt; in safeguarding the titan facilities on Azeroth. In time, this creation also succumbed to the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Flesh\"&gt;Curse of Flesh&lt;/a&gt;, becoming the &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Frost%20vrykul\"&gt;Frost vrykul&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Kvaldir\"&gt;Kvaldir&lt;/a&gt; are a variant of those vrykul. Around 15,000 years ago, the gods \"abandoned\" the &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; (from their point of view), and a certain time after that, their children were born \"weak and ugly\", the direct result of being affected by the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Flesh\"&gt;Curse of Flesh&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"King%20Ymiron\"&gt;King Ymiron&lt;/a&gt; ordered all those children to be killed, but not all parents obeyed this order and instead hid their children to grow up far away from &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. In time, these small adult vrykul would form the early human tribes, which would later become known as &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s as a whole.\nAnother group of vrykul settled in &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; and eventually became the &lt;a href=\"Drust\"&gt;Drust&lt;/a&gt;.\nTol'vir.\nHaving been created as guardians and well-keepers of the titan research facilities, the tol'vir, stone beings, alike the &lt;a href=\"earthen\"&gt;earthen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"mechagnome\"&gt;mechagnome&lt;/a&gt;s, wrought for the purpose of preserving the cities of &lt;a href=\"Uldum\"&gt;Uldum&lt;/a&gt; and Ulduar were nonetheless affected by the curse of flesh as much as their kin. Some of them though retaining their earthly structure, were captured by the nerubians and transformed into the &lt;a href=\"obsidian%20destroyer\"&gt;obsidian destroyer&lt;/a&gt;s, claimed afterward by the Scourge and used in the front lines. Used by the silithid in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Shifting%20Sands\"&gt;War of the Shifting Sands&lt;/a&gt;, they proved great menaces even to the dragons. Only few free-willed tol'vir remain and only in Uldum. Those subsiding to the curse of flesh may have lost much of their power, but did not lose their purpose, and did not leave Uldum and its secrets. Two groups of fleshy tol'vir now name themselves the &lt;a href=\"Ramkahen%20tribe\"&gt;Ramkahen&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Neferset%20tribe\"&gt;Neferset&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 the latter of which has their stone flesh restored by &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;.\nMogu.\nThe mogu are a creation of the titans. They were a legion of stone, heartless and obedient and by their masters command, the mogu fought the terrible servants of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s, shaped the mountains and carved the rivers of the land. The mogu even created a magical cradle of life in a hidden valley now known as the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt;. \nFor many ages the mogu guarded the work of the titans. With stony determination, they stood in ageless vigil - even as their master fell silent. With the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Flesh\"&gt;Curse of Flesh&lt;/a&gt; the mogu became terrified as they began to breath, to bleed and to die. But with the flesh came the other curses of mortality: pride and greed, fear and anger. No longer united in purpose, the mogu fought amongst themselves. Powerful mogu warlords gathered up followers and made war on one another. Their battles scorched the land, terrifying the other mortal races.\nWild Gods line.\nCenarius.\nAs the son of &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;, goddess of the moon, and the demigod &lt;a href=\"Malorne\"&gt;Malorne&lt;/a&gt;, Cenarius inherited a deep connection to the world of Azeroth and its creatures. &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt;'s love was so great for Malorne that she took Cenarius as her own. Cenarius grew to love the lush forests of Ysera's verdant realm. Cenarius fathered many children. His daughters are known as the fey &lt;a href=\"dryads\"&gt;dryads&lt;/a&gt; and his sons as the wise &lt;a href=\"Keeper%20of%20the%20Grove\"&gt;Keepers of the Grove&lt;/a&gt;, or simply \"keepers\", including &lt;a href=\"Keeper%20Remulos\"&gt;Keeper Remulos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ordanus\"&gt;Ordanus&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Zaetar\"&gt;Zaetar&lt;/a&gt;. \nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"magnataur\"&gt;magnataur&lt;/a&gt; have also a connection to Cenarius. Cenarius claims kinship with the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; as well, but has never said in what way. &lt;a href=\"Zaetar\"&gt;Zaetar&lt;/a&gt; was the eldest son of &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;. He made the mistake of mating with &lt;a href=\"Princess%20Theradras\"&gt;Princess Theradras&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful &lt;a href=\"earth%20elemental\"&gt;earth elemental&lt;/a&gt; aligned with the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s. Their children, the &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Khan\"&gt;Khan&lt;/a&gt;s, turned on him upon birth and slew him mercilessly.\nOther Wild Gods.\n&lt;a href=\"Ursoc\"&gt;Ursoc&lt;/a&gt; the Mighty fathered the &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt;, and both he and his brother &lt;a href=\"Ursol\"&gt;Ursol&lt;/a&gt; the Wise are still hailed as gods by the furbolg tribes. The quilboar are the mortal offspring of the the colossal boar Ancient &lt;a href=\"Agamaggan\"&gt;Agamaggan&lt;/a&gt; and still occupy the region of his death and hold them sacred. &lt;a href=\"Harpies\"&gt;Harpies&lt;/a&gt; are descended from the winged demigoddess &lt;a href=\"Aviana\"&gt;Aviana&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; believes that the &lt;a href=\"Grell\"&gt;Grell&lt;/a&gt; may come from &lt;a href=\"Aessina\"&gt;Aessina&lt;/a&gt;, though when he asked she simply said, \"maybe.\" Brann Bronzebeard also speculates that the &lt;a href=\"Gorloc\"&gt;Gorloc&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Murloc\"&gt;Murloc&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mur%27gul\"&gt;Mur'gul&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Deep%20sea%20murloc\"&gt;Deep sea murloc&lt;/a&gt;s are descendants of a \"Frog Ancient\"; A Bull Ancient is the progenitor of the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"taunka\"&gt;taunka&lt;/a&gt;; a \"Lobster Ancient\" of the &lt;a href=\"Makrura\"&gt;Makrura&lt;/a&gt;; a \"Badger Ancient\" of the &lt;a href=\"wolvar\"&gt;wolvar&lt;/a&gt;; a \"Hyena Ancient\" of the \"Gnoll\" and a \"Walrus Ancient\" of the &lt;a href=\"tuskarr\"&gt;tuskarr&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpecies from other worlds.\nEredar.\nEredar physiology has been shaped by demonic influences over the course of the many eons since Sargeras first encountered their race. When the Dark Titan approached the Eredar, the majority chose to develop their already-substantial magical gifts by joining the Burning Crusade. The demonic eredar, called the \"&lt;a href=\"Man%27ari%20eredar\"&gt;man'ari&lt;/a&gt;\" (Eredun for \"wrong\" or \"twisted\"), have since developed into powerful warlocks and &lt;a href=\"wrathguard\"&gt;wrathguard&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnly those who followed the Prophet Velen and the naaru refused to join the Burning Legion, escaping from their homeworld Argus in an interdimensional transport made of a single huge diamond (now Osha'gun, in Nagrand). The transport crashed into a planet inhabited by primitive orcs, ogres, and arakkoa. These eredar named themselves the \"&lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"exiles\") and their new home, Draenor.\nAfter generations of peace, Kil'jaeden and Burning Legion rediscovered the draenei. The Burning Legion used corrupted orcs to all but wipe out the draenei race. While those who survived the attacks on Karabor and Shattrath were in hiding, it was discovered that some of the draenei had been corrupted by their contact with the demonic energies of the fel orcs, causing them to mutate physically and mentally. Unable to feel the touch of the Light, the \"krokul\" (\"&lt;a href=\"broken\"&gt;broken&lt;/a&gt;\") draenei were initially shunned by the unaffected draenei. Some of the Broken continued to devolve \u2014 these pitiful beings are known as the &lt;a href=\"Lost%20One\"&gt;Lost One&lt;/a&gt;s, and are now barely sentient. \nDraenei player characters are unaffected draenei, who escaped from Draenor with Velen after taking back one wing of Tempest Keep, the Exodar, from Prince Kael'thas and his blood elves.\nOgres and orcs.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Earth%20giant%20%28Draenor%29\"&gt;earth giants of Draenor&lt;/a&gt; are the ancestors of the &lt;a href=\"Magnaron\"&gt;Magnaron&lt;/a&gt;, who in turn are the ancestors of &lt;a href=\"Gronn\"&gt;Gronn&lt;/a&gt;, the giant masters of Draenor's brutish ogres. The &lt;a href=\"Ogre\"&gt;Ogre&lt;/a&gt; race started as an offspring of the seven &lt;a href=\"Gronn\"&gt;Gronn&lt;/a&gt;. The early Ogres looked like &lt;a href=\"Ogre%20Lord\"&gt;Ogre Lord&lt;/a&gt;s, giant, cyclopean creatures with bony, calcified protrusions; as well as being smart and powerful. From these came regular Ogres: more humanoid in shape, two-eyed, smaller, not as intelligent, and generally inferior to Ogre Lords. As the Ogres lived on the same world as the &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;s, a new race would appear that was the result of a union between the two races, the &lt;a href=\"Mok%27Nathal\"&gt;Mok'Nathal&lt;/a&gt;. The Mok'Nathal were powerful warriors who are revered amongst the Orcs, but shunned by the Ogres. The Gronn are angered by any Ogre half-breed, finding them an impurity in their bloodline. \nAnother branch of the ogres are the two-headed variety. These were natural but rare, and artificial ones were created by the orc warlock Gul'dan later on. Two-headed ogres were held in high regard by their single-headed brethren, and often held positions of great importance, such as the tribe's Shaman. Also, due to the added intelligence of having two heads, the two-headed ogres have an easier time grasping and controlling magic.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, there is enough fossil evidence to theorize that the ettins evolved from &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s, but he suspects there might be a \"missing link\". Any fossil evidence was likely lost when &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; was torn apart. This can not be entirely true, however, for the ettins of the Broken Isles have apparently been living there for several ages before the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; ever opened.\nShadowlands races.\n&lt;a href=\"Kyrian\"&gt;Kyrian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"venthyr\"&gt;venthyr&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;s of the dead who were transformed into races made for eternal service in the Shadowlands. The &lt;a href=\"ash%20ghoul\"&gt;ash ghoul&lt;/a&gt;s are venthyr who have been exposed to the Light for too long, turning them into crawling wretches\n&lt;a href=\"Biggun\"&gt;Biggun&lt;/a&gt;s are created from reshaping multiple &lt;a href=\"dredger\"&gt;dredger&lt;/a&gt;s.\nOrigin of the species evolution line.\nOther lines.\n &lt;a href=\"Mo%27arg\"&gt;Mo'arg&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 &lt;a href=\"Felguard\"&gt;Felguard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gan%27arg\"&gt;Gan'arg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=\"Nathrezim\"&gt;Nathrezim&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 (RPG-only: &lt;a href=\"Tothrezim\"&gt;Tothrezim&lt;/a&gt;)"}

A character from a race can choose to take up levels in the class when playing that race. Racial classes represent abilities based on that races culture or ethnicity. This ability represents members of these races becoming more in tune with their natural spirits, developing their inner potentials, focusing on their traditions and attaining the ancestral powers of their cultures and societies. Not all members of such a race take up their racial class, but many do. Other races are not allowed to learn another race's racial class. Even a character polymorphed into a member of another race cannot take the class of a \"new\" race; racial classes represent millennia of history, culture and legacy that infuse a new member of the race at birth and reverberate within her consciousness forever.\nHumans and orcs did not initially have a racial class. This was partially to make orcs similar to humans, as these two races are the most important in the Warcraft world. Orcs were given a racial class in \"Horde Player's Guide\". Races that are considered half-human, such as &lt;a href=\"Half-elf\"&gt;half-elves&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"half-orc\"&gt;half-orc&lt;/a&gt;s, are not given racial classes either. \nMore bestial, monster, or feral player races may have a &lt;a href=\"creature%20class\"&gt;creature class&lt;/a&gt; instead, which more or less functions in the same manner. &lt;a href=\"Racial%20iconic%20class\"&gt;Racial iconic class&lt;/a&gt;es are similar, they also represent characters who draw upon their races\u2019 traditions, values, and techniques \u2014 though in these cases, the traditions, values, and techniques are those specific to a class.\nSome racial class rules may be identical to another racial class, the only difference is the name. A racial class should not be confused with racial traits. A race may have racial traits regardless of having the racial class or not."}

They are also &lt;a href=\"variant%20class\"&gt;variant class&lt;/a&gt;es, but these classes represent certain racial icons. The troll barbarian, for instance, is an icon on Azeroth.

Any &lt;a href=\"race\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt; can be any &lt;a href=\"base%20class\"&gt;base class&lt;/a&gt;, but some races are more likely to be members of a certain class. Some races have traditions of specific classes in their societies and cultures. A race\u2019s favored class represents that race\u2019s natural predilection to a certain degree; racial iconic classes are another method. \nA racial iconic class demonstrates a particular race\u2019s natural ability with a certain class. It might also represent the fact that a class has social or traditional connotations within a race\u2019s culture. &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;Night elves&lt;/a&gt; possess a natural tendency to become scouts, for instance; therefore, night elves\u2019 favored class is &lt;a href=\"scout\"&gt;scout&lt;/a&gt;. Similarly, night elf society has long favored divine magic and granted status and recognition to great &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s. The night elf druid is a racial icon; the racial iconic class \u201cnight elf druid\u201d represents it. Jungle trolls possess a natural tendency to become barbarians, for instance; therefore, jungle trolls\u2019 favored class is barbarian. Similarly, jungle troll society has long favored voodoo magic and granted status and recognition to great witch doctors. The troll witch doctor is a racial icon; the racial iconic class \u201cjungle troll witch doctor\u201d represents it.\nLike other variant classes, a racial iconic class uses an existing class as its base but alters it slightly to depict its racial icon. Obviously, a character must be of the appropriate race to take a racial iconic class."}

They call themselves the \"Lost Ones\" in mourning of their former world. A mixture of these sad creatures somehow made the journey to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and settled in the &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20of%20Sorrows\"&gt;Swamp of Sorrows&lt;/a&gt;, with those recovering from their madness living in the &lt;a href=\"Harborage\"&gt;Harborage&lt;/a&gt;, and those still suffering in the &lt;a href=\"Fallow%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Fallow Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Broken\"&gt;Broken&lt;/a&gt;.\nBroken draenei are a sub-race of the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; created by corruption during the battle with the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;.

Fey are usually human-shaped or have human-shaped portions (such as a humanoid torso and the body of a stag or other wild creature). &lt;a href=\"Faerie%20dragon\"&gt;Faerie dragon&lt;/a&gt;s are also fey, and this is reflected in the names of certain subtypes such as &lt;a href=\"Fey%20Dragon\"&gt;Fey Dragon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fey%20Drake\"&gt;Fey Drake&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Note: While fey is used to describe a few specific races with similar characteristics, it does not mean that all are related.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Human\"&gt;Human&lt;/a&gt;.\nHuman is a term that refers to prolific race of humanoids on Azeroth formally known as the &lt;a href=\"Azotha\"&gt;Azotha&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Humanoid\"&gt;Humanoid&lt;/a&gt;.\nHumanoid is the technical term used to describe roughly human-like species. That is \"having human form or characteristics\". A humanoid usually has two arms, two legs, and one head or a human-like torso, arms, and a head. Humanoids have few or no supernatural or extraordinary abilities, but most can speak and usually have well-developed societies. Humanoid can refer to any race (not neccesarily sapient) that share at least some similarities to basic human build, at least from the torso up. Dryads, for example, are considered fey \"humanoids\" even though they have bestial lower bodies. \nIn the MMO and RPG not all humanoids are classified as humanoids however, and many are listed as &lt;a href=\"giant\"&gt;giant&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; (and other categories). In some cases, these are smaller sub-categories within the term humanoid \u2014 for example, goblinoid, giant, or some fey. It is a technical term, rather than a \"racial slur\".\n\"Note: While humanoid is used to describe races with similar characteristics, it does not mean they are all related to \"humans\".\"\nGiant.\nGiants are humanoid creatures of great strength. They are a very large size (above 3 meters/yards or so) and larger than most ogres (though ogres are considered as one of the races of giants of Draenor). This includes most semi-intelligent large humanoids and some intelligent. Most giants are the creations of the titans, birthed when the world was young.\n\"Note: While giant is described races with similar characteristics, it does not mean that all are related to giants.\"\nRacial terms used in the novels.\nNear-human.\nThe \"&lt;a href=\"near-human\"&gt;near-human&lt;/a&gt;s\" of Draenor are an in-universe speculative race used by &lt;a href=\"Garona\"&gt;Garona&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt; to interpret the former's non-orcish heritage. In \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Last%20Guardian\"&gt;The Last Guardian&lt;/a&gt;\", Garona makes various statements that there was a different group of humans living on Draenor than those the orcs later discovered on Azeroth, who were possibly rendered extinct some time before.\n\"While no specific Warcraft definition has been given, in other fantasy/sci-fi (ex. Star Wars &amp; Doctor Who), near-human has meant a race that evolutionarily diverged from humans (or have mixed ancestry with other species). In some cases the term is used to describe a race that evolutionarily converged into a species biologically related to humans. Often humans &amp; near-humans are genetically compatible. This term is synonymous with the term \"demi-human\" or \"metahuman\" and sometimes half-breed or hybrids from other fiction.\"\nRacial terms described in the RPG.\nOutsider.\nAn outsider is at least partially composed of the essence (but not necessarily the material) of some plane other than Azeroth. Some creatures start out as some other type of creature and become outsiders when they attain a higher (or lower) state of spiritual existence. Native outsiders are native to Azeroth. They are creatures who have mortal ancestors or a strong connection to Azeroth and can be raised, reincarnated, or resurrected just as other living creatures can be.\n\"Note: While outsider is used to describe a few specific races with similar characteristics, it does not mean that all are related.\"\nMagical beast.\nMagical beasts are similar to &lt;a href=\"animal\"&gt;animal&lt;/a&gt;s but can have higher intelligences. Magical beasts often have supernatural or extraordinary abilities, but sometimes are merely bizarre in appearance or habits.\n\"Note: While magical beast is used to describe a few specific races with similar characteristics, it does not mean that all are related.\"\nConstruct.\nA construct is an &lt;a href=\"animated%20object\"&gt;animated object&lt;/a&gt; or artificially (perhaps technologically) constructed creature. &lt;a href=\"Mechanical\"&gt;Mechanical&lt;/a&gt;s are a type of construct.\n\"Note: While construct is used to describe a few specific races with similar characteristics, it does not mean that all are related.\"\nPlant.\nPlant (a.k.a. plant creature or ambulatory plant) is a term which comprises creatures made of vegetable matter. Note that regular plants, such as one finds growing in gardens and fields, are not creatures but objects, even though they are alive (they lack &lt;a href=\"spirit\"&gt;spirit&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"charisma\"&gt;charisma&lt;/a&gt;).\n\"Note: While plant is used to describe a few specific races with similar characteristics, it does not mean that all are related.\"\nRacial terms described in the Burning Crusade.\n&lt;a href=\"Mag%27har%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Mag'har&lt;/a&gt;.\nMag'har, brown-skinned &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s &lt;a href=\"Tainted%20orc\"&gt;untainted&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, call &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; (once known as &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;) their home.

He wanted to ease the tensions between the Darkspear and the rest of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; by proving that the trolls were strong and worthy allies, no matter the cost.\nBiography.\nRada'jin joined the Garad'kra team led by &lt;a href=\"Shagara\"&gt;Shagara&lt;/a&gt; and accompanied them on their first mission of dealing with &lt;a href=\"Aratas\"&gt;Aratas&lt;/a&gt;' &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt; army. During their first confrontation with the centaur in the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Barrens\"&gt;Northern Barrens&lt;/a&gt;, Rada'jin's overeagerness to prove himself caused him to attack recklessly, ignore Shagara's orders, and lose himself to bloodlust while shapeshifted, almost costing the Garad'kra the battle had it not been for the orc &lt;a href=\"Malgar\"&gt;Malgar&lt;/a&gt;'s help. Shagara harshly reprimanded Rada'jin for this after the battle.\nFollowing information from the centaur &lt;a href=\"Dorthar\"&gt;Dorthar&lt;/a&gt;, the Garad'kra set out on a &lt;a href=\"zeppelin\"&gt;zeppelin&lt;/a&gt; journey to &lt;a href=\"Desolace\"&gt;Desolace&lt;/a&gt; to strike at Aratas' army directly. During the voyage, Rada'jin lamented that he wasn't showing himself to be a worthy druid, but Shagara assured him that they all\u2014her most of all\u2014were trying to prove their worth, just like him. As the journey continued, the Garad'kra helped Dorthar learn how to fight, knitting the team closer together and training them to work as a unit.\nOn arrival in Desolace, the Garad'kra confronted Aratas while Malgar and Dorthar freed the centaur's slaves. The Garad'kra started to lose against Aratas' &lt;a href=\"perfect%20ones\"&gt;perfect ones&lt;/a&gt; until Malgar joined them and turned the tide with his arrows and his &lt;a href=\"wolf\"&gt;wolf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Remnes\"&gt;Remnes&lt;/a&gt;. Aratas threw a spear at the orc's back, but Rada'jin jumped in front and the spear impaled his heart. As the druid lay dying, he apologized for failing the Garad'kra again, but Malgar told him that he had done the Horde proud and that he would tell everyone about the druid's noble sacrifice. Rada'jin then died, having finally proven his worth.\nShagara believed that it was Rada'jin's courage that allowed Malgar and the Garad'kra to defeat Aratas and save the Horde. She considered the mission a failure due to the druid's death and subsequently spoke up against &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;'s mistreatment of the Darkspear.

His hatred burns even brighter than my own, but his mind is no longer his own. He is a threat to all the natural creatures of this forest.\nCompletion.\nYou have done well, my friend.\nThe forest is still tainted, but at least we know we have done a small part to return it to its former glory. If you wish to return to me again, I would enjoy the company of my own kind.\nBe well. Perhaps our tribes will meet again under less violent times.\nNotes.\nLeave &lt;a href=\"Krolg\"&gt;Krolg&lt;/a&gt; and follow the mountains to the east. You'll find Ran's camp along the way at coordinates . He is linked to one of his bodyguards. The guards also have a ridiculously fast respawn rate (frequently one will respawn before you've killed the next one, let alone reached Ran), so either bring company or make sure you are able to fight two (or more) at a time."}

{"id": "19690", "revid": "22514", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=19690", "title": "Rage", "text": "Rage is the primary &lt;a href=\"resource\"&gt;resource&lt;/a&gt; used by &lt;a href=\"Warrior\"&gt;Warrior&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Bear%20Form\"&gt;Bear Form&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s. Rage is required for the execution of many of their abilities, although auto attacks don't depend on it at all. By controlling and focusing their Rage, Warriors can unleash an array of devastating attacks, harden themselves into unassailable defenders, or even draw strength and healing from their anger. While Arms and Fury Warriors primarily use Rage to deal damage, Protection Warriors and Guardian Druids can also use it to mitigate damage or even self-heal.\nBy default the rage bar is empty, and when out of combat, rage drains or depletes at a constant rate, unaffected by level or stats. Rage can be generated in a number of ways, some passive and some active. By default, Rage is capped at a maximum of 100, but by choosing &lt;a href=\"Deadly%20Calm\"&gt;Deadly Calm&lt;/a&gt; as an &lt;a href=\"Arms\"&gt;Arms Warrior&lt;/a&gt;, this cap is raised to 130.\nA number of abilities and talents affect the use of Rage in some way. Most reduce the Rage cost of certain abilities, while a few offer additional opportunities for generation. \nBasic rage generation.\nRage can be generated by several means, depending on the Warrior or Druid's abilities and talents:\nCertain other effects can also generate Rage:\nRage per second from auto attacks.\nBecause this is a normalized amount \"per second\", and weapons attack slower than once per second, the amount generated per swing is much higher:\nOther rage generation.\nStats.\nAlthough not directly increasing Rage generation, by interacting with abilities and other modifiers, certain stats can facilitate more production.\nConsumables.\nRage Potions, crafted by &lt;a href=\"Alchemy\"&gt;alchemists&lt;/a&gt;, can be used to generate Rage:\nRage decay.\nWhile not in combat, Rage is lost at rate of 1.25 per second. To maintain a constant Rage value out of combat, 75 Rage per minute (RPM) must be met. However, this is not very feasible as the spells &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Clap\"&gt;Thunder Clap&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thrash\"&gt;Thrash&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"PvP%20talent\"&gt;PvP talent&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bloodrage\"&gt;Bloodrage&lt;/a&gt; are among the only ways you can generate Rage outside of combat, and no other spells can suspend it.\nIt's only necessary to maintain Rage for brief periods such as while waiting for the group to recover mana or health or while running from one opponent to the next, so it's more important to bank as much Rage in combat as you can between encounters than it is to generate lots of it while out of combat. Having enough Rage for the next boss or pack of mobs gives you a head start on damage or defense.\nThe best way to maintain high Rage is by attacking &lt;a href=\"critters\"&gt;critters&lt;/a&gt; like snakes or rats. You can generate Rage from the attack or spell used and put yourself in combat for a few seconds to suspend decay. Each critter essentially offers an opportunity for free, instant Rage generation, so keep your eye out for them. Low-level mobs can be used in a similar way, potentially allowing the warrior to build-up a full rage bar before attacking a more dangerous foe. When attacking targets for this reason, remember to use &lt;a href=\"Charge\"&gt;Charge&lt;/a&gt; (as a Warrior) as much as possible.\nFor Guardian Druids, the best you can do is remember to shift into &lt;a href=\"Bear%20Form\"&gt;Bear Form&lt;/a&gt; before each pull if you have less than 25 Rage because shifting into it sets your Rage to 25.\nRage management.\nThe use of Rage depends on role and situation. In PvE, DPS Warriors will often use Rage to fuel a standard rotation, while Protection Warriors and Guardian Druids will focus more on damage mitigation and survival. In PvP, the unpredictable nature of combat means that Rage is often spent in response to opponents' actions, depending on the need for damage, control or survival. &lt;a href=\"Resource%20pooling\"&gt;Rage pooling&lt;/a&gt; can be useful for those specializations that have abilities which increase their damage for a period of time.\nAlthough you will usually want to spend Rage in the most efficient or useful way possible. Because of its cap at 100 (130 with &lt;a href=\"Deadly%20Calm\"&gt;Deadly Calm&lt;/a&gt;), when any further Rage generated will be capped, it becomes desirable to spend it quickly. The ability to expend Rage is generally limited by the &lt;a href=\"global%20cooldown\"&gt;global cooldown&lt;/a&gt;, as well as by the cooldowns of some individual abilities. When accumulating more Rage than being spent, players should use a \"Rage dump\" to avoid wasting it. \nRage dumps.\nRage dumps are generally inefficient or unrewarding in proportion to their cost, making them less desirable to spend Rage on, but are better than simply wasting Rage. The rule of thumb for Rage dumps is to use them only when you are accumulating more Rage than you can spend.\nFor ease of use and smoothness in one's rotation for dumping Rage, these spells are sometimes not affected by the &lt;a href=\"global%20cooldown\"&gt;global cooldown&lt;/a&gt; so they can be used in addition to their preferred abilities without sacrificing time, damage, or Rage generation. In the past, there were such spells that dealt damage, but now off-GCD dumps are relegated entirely to defensive spells. Generation from all sources is balanced around how much Rage you can spend on the GCD. Should such spells return, they can be used for large but inefficient bursts of damage that may leave you Rage-starved, but can be situationally useful to finish off targets like in PvP.\nThe main mistake made with Rage dumps is to assume you must use them as often as possible. Rage dumps should generally not be used unless there is no better way of spending the Rage, or if the situation demands use of that spell. \nWarrior.\nAll Warriors have &lt;a href=\"Ignore%20Pain\"&gt;Ignore Pain&lt;/a&gt; as an off-GCD defensive dump, while Protection Warriors also have &lt;a href=\"Revenge\"&gt;Revenge&lt;/a&gt; as an on-GCD damage dump and get no cooldown on Ignore Pain. Ignore Pain has a limit to its absorb shield, so if possible they should avoid over-capping it. Revenge can be used when defense is not needed.\nBecause Fury Warriors are designed to spend all of their Rage on &lt;a href=\"Rampage\"&gt;Rampage&lt;/a&gt; as often as possible, which costs most of their Rage bar, they don't need off-GCD dumps, and Rampage doesn't qualify as a dump since it's their most powerful Rage spender.\nArms Warriors tend to be able to spend more than they can generate, so they have no off-GCD dumps. The spells &lt;a href=\"Slam\"&gt;Slam&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Whirlwind\"&gt;Whirlwind&lt;/a&gt; are their on-GCD damage dumps when more powerful spells are not available.\nDruid.\nDruids' only off-GCD Rage dump is &lt;a href=\"Ironfur\"&gt;Ironfur&lt;/a&gt; which is enough to handle the amount of Rage they generate from all sources - especially because Ironfur has a stacking effect which makes it very efficient to pool Rage before a large burst of damage and then spend it multiple times at once."}

It is a thick bright red mixture, and when drunk causes violent mood swings and a marked increase of aggression in the drinker. For most people this just causes trouble, but &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s find this heightened state of anger of great use in their work.\nSource.\nThis item is crafted with &lt;a href=\"Alchemy\"&gt;Alchemy&lt;/a&gt; (90); taught by .\nNotes.\nThe comparative scarcity of &lt;a href=\"Sharp%20Claw\"&gt;Sharp Claw&lt;/a&gt;s, and limited market (Warrior and Druid only), means that it doesn't often end up on the Auction House, and is expensive when it does. However, these potions are another good reason for the warrior to consider Herbalism/Alchemy instead of the traditional Mining/Blacksmithing combination for professions. \nThe &lt;a href=\"rage\"&gt;rage&lt;/a&gt; amounts above may seem relatively small, compared to &lt;a href=\"Mana%20Potion\"&gt;Mana Potion&lt;/a&gt;s, but bear in mind that a warrior will \"always\" have a maximum rage of 100. Since the warrior usually starts combat with 0 rage, and gains rage quickly and often during a fight, these potions are best kept for when a warrior absolutely \"needs\" to get a large rage-cost special attack immediately; e.g. going from a standing start in a duel, or delivering massive DPS on an enemy who absolutely has to die \"now\"!\nFor day-to-day grinding, these potions should not be necessary, as the additional cost and effort of harvesting claws and fangs makes them \"much\" more costly than mana or health potions."}

Only one tank is needed. If available raid members should equip a &lt;a href=\"PvP%20trinket\"&gt;PvP trinket&lt;/a&gt;, no other special gear or buffs required. Most NPC die rather quickly from Death and Decay, so it's safer not to risk Jaina (if she dies the event is reset).\nIce Bolt.\nThis is probably Rage Winterchills most dangerous ability, Ice Bolt victims die quickly (usually within 2\u20133 seconds) from the DoT. It cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed by using a PvP trinket, a Paladin's bubble, a hunter's &lt;a href=\"The%20Beast%20Within\"&gt;The Beast Within&lt;/a&gt; or a mages &lt;a href=\"Blink\"&gt;Blink&lt;/a&gt;.\nHealing through the Ice Bolt damage is possible, but needs very quick reactions and/or coordination. One priest and one other healer can be put on \"Ice Bolt duty\". The priest uses (which buys 1\u20132 seconds), while the other healer casts a normal heal.\nDeath and Decay.\nSince this is stationary on the ground, the only difficulty is to take notice of it. Turn up spell details (in the graphics settings of the game configuration) to maximum - it's a rather faint red pattern on the ground. Everybody needs to move out of it quickly.\nPrior to &lt;a href=\"patch%206.0.3\"&gt;patch 6.0.3&lt;/a&gt;, this ability was notable for its deadliness against high-level characters due to its rapid damage proportional to the target's health rather than a fixed number, preventing such players from ignoring the ability mechanics as is usually possible with outdated raids. However, its damage appears to have been reduced in that patch to no longer scale up to very high health totals.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

Thus naming only the elves that followed Illidan, \"blood elves.\" However, according to the &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20Encyclopedia\"&gt;Warcraft Encyclopedia&lt;/a&gt; and subsequent works, most of the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; did not follow the prince, only the healthiest of them were sent in search of alternative magic sources.\nBlackhand's appearance.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Words%20of%20Wind%20and%20Earth\"&gt;Legion shaman artifact lore book&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href=\"Blackhand%20%28comic%29\"&gt;Blackhand, the comic&lt;/a&gt; it was explained that &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; was engulfed by the elements and their fire, his skin becoming scarred, losing his hair, and his hand becoming stone. However, in , an artwork of Blackhand depicted him the same way he was in the Warcraft movie, with full hair and a tattoed black hand instead of an elemental one. Matt Burns explained on Twitter that they had indeed decided to go with the latter. Blackhand was not consumed in fire.\nThe comics depict what happened to the alternate universe Blackhand, a backstory that could be different from the main universe Blackhand. There are other examples of differences between both universes even before the intervention of Garrosh or the player characters, so it is possible that the MU Blackhand has the same appearance as in the movie while AU Blackhand looks like he does in Warlords of Draenor.\nBlack Temple/Fortress Shadowmoon.\nIn ', &lt;a href=\"Magtheridon\"&gt;Magtheridon&lt;/a&gt; is in the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Citadel%20%28Hellfire%20Peninsula%29\"&gt;Black Citadel&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;. In ' it was changed to the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Valley\"&gt;Shadowmoon Valley&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Black Temple dungeon trailer claims that the Draenei Temple of &lt;a href=\"Karabor\"&gt;Karabor&lt;/a&gt; was captured by orcs for a time before it became the sinister fortress of Magtheridon. This suggests that the Shadowmoon Fortress assaulted in \"\" was in fact another name for this structure.\nAlso, during the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt; trailer, &lt;a href=\"Akama\"&gt;Akama&lt;/a&gt; recalls a dialogue between Illidan and Prince Kael'thas from the opening cinematic of &lt;a href=\"Gates%20of%20the%20Abyss\"&gt;Gates of the Abyss&lt;/a&gt;, but in that &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20III\"&gt;Warcraft III&lt;/a&gt; mission, Akama was not present when that conversation took place and does not appear until much later.\nChen Stormstout's place of birth.\nIn &lt;a href=\"The%20Founding%20of%20Durotar\"&gt;The Founding of Durotar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Chen%20Stormstout\"&gt;Chen Stormstout&lt;/a&gt; said he hailed from &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; - indeed, it was the first time Pandaria was mentioned in the Warcraft series. Current lore, however, states that Chen comes from the &lt;a href=\"Wandering%20Isle\"&gt;Wandering Isle&lt;/a&gt; and never set foot on his ancestral homeland before &lt;a href=\"Mists%20of%20Pandaria\"&gt;Mists of Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;.\nDaemons.\nIn the first two \"Warcraft\" games, the word \"&lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;\" was consistently spelled as \"&lt;a href=\"daemon\"&gt;daemon&lt;/a&gt;\", with &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; called a \"Daemonlord\" in the ' manual. However, in ' and the accompanying novels that came out a year earlier, the spelling was changed to \"demon\", and the spelling \"daemon\" is never mentioned again except in the \"&lt;a href=\"Rise%20of%20the%20Horde\"&gt;Rise of the Horde&lt;/a&gt;\" novel, where it is mentioned that the &lt;a href=\"Orcish%20%28language%29\"&gt;Orcish&lt;/a&gt; word for \"twisted soul\" was \"dae'mon\".\nDark Portal appearance change.\nIn \"\", the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; of the side of Draenor looks like the side of Azeroth in-game, but it can be explained again through graphic reuse, as in the cinematics it looks different.\nIn \"\", the &lt;a href=\"Stair%20of%20Destiny\"&gt;Stair of Destiny&lt;/a&gt; is shown as a more extreme version of the new look. All lore still fits.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Rise%20of%20the%20Horde\"&gt;Rise of the Horde&lt;/a&gt;\", Medivh gives &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; a vision on how to make the Dark Portal look, as was also said in \"Warcraft II\" manual, but this time he shows the Stair of Destiny as it is in \"The Burning Crusade\". Gul'dan does not even know who or what the figures are.\nDar'Khan Drathir's death.\nAfter betraying his people to Arthas Menethil, Dar'khan was killed within the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell%20Plateau\"&gt;Sunwell Plateau&lt;/a&gt;, after succumbing to the taint of the Sunwell (in his greed, he had directly ingested some of its energies before its corruption) that was now coursing through him. At the climax of the &lt;a href=\"manga\"&gt;manga&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Sunwell%20Trilogy\"&gt;The Sunwell Trilogy&lt;/a&gt;\", &lt;a href=\"Dar%27Khan%20Drathir\"&gt;Dar'Khan Drathir&lt;/a&gt; is burned and apparently obliterated by &lt;a href=\"Anveena\"&gt;Anveena&lt;/a&gt;. In \"&lt;a href=\"Blood%20of%20the%20Highborne\"&gt;Blood of the Highborne&lt;/a&gt;\", set a year or so after this, he appeared again and returned to plot the downfall of his people. He was killed by Lor'themar Theron, who nocked his bow with an &lt;a href=\"Stone%20of%20Spark\"&gt;enchanted arrow&lt;/a&gt; that caused Dar'Khan to disintegrate into dust. Lor'themar, however, was unsure whether the traitor had truly been killed for good. He later appears at the &lt;a href=\"Tower%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Tower of the Damned&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Deatholme\"&gt;Deatholme&lt;/a&gt; at the southern reaches of the &lt;a href=\"Ghostlands\"&gt;Ghostlands&lt;/a&gt;. In the manga it is not seen that he was completely obliterated, so it is possible that he was just burned and was later raised again by &lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt;. How he managed to reappear after his death at Lor'themar's hands is unclear.\nIt has been theorized that Dar'Khan became a sort of elven &lt;a href=\"lich\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt; following his first death. Shortly before dying, he had drunk deep of the Sunwell's power, which was then contaminated by the ritual Arthas performed to bring Kel'Thuzad back into the world as a lich. Dar'Khan was physically overwhelmed by this sensation, and according to Arthas, Dar'Khan was now tainted by the same corrupt power that had been used to resurrect Kel'Thuzad; this would not have happened had Dar'Khan not disobeyed his instructions and tasted the Sunwell directly. It may be that \"surviving\" the experience imbued Dar'Khan with similar lich-like properties to Kel'Thuzad, explaining his inability to stay dead. After all, \"Fear not, my ambitious friend. Death is only the beginning, as my colleague Kel'Thuzad can readily attest.\"\nDeathwing.\nIn \"\", &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; joined the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Horde of Draenor&lt;/a&gt; and then crossed to &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, before the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; was destroyed. He then appeared inexplicably on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Day%20of%20the%20Dragon\"&gt;Day of the Dragon&lt;/a&gt;\".\nIt is possible that \"Day of the Dragon\" was supposed to be before \"Warcraft II: Beyond the Dark Portal\". This is supported by the fact that there is mention that the dragonqueen &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; was rescued in \"Warcraft II: Beyond the Dark Portal\", whereas that happened in \"Day of the Dragon\". However, current lore supports the fact that \"Day of the Dragon\" happened after \"Warcraft II: Beyond the Dark Portal\", causing a retcon.\nAdditionally, just before Khadgar closes the Dark Portal in the Alliance ending video of Beyond the Dark Portal, a dragon-shaped shadow passes over him in the direction of the portal, possibly suggesting that Deathwing was able to escape back through the portal before it was closed.\nDraenei and eredar.\nThe \"&lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20III\"&gt;Warcraft III&lt;/a&gt;\" manual and the history books found in the original \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" say that the &lt;a href=\"eredar\"&gt;eredar&lt;/a&gt; were already &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s when &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; encountered them, and that they played a major role in corrupting the titan. There was no indication that the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; were in any way related to the eredar, and all lore and dialogue pointed to them being native to &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;. All of the draenei known at the time (including &lt;a href=\"Akama\"&gt;Akama&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Magtoor\"&gt;Magtoor&lt;/a&gt;) had the appearance of the &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Ones\"&gt;Lost Ones&lt;/a&gt;. All of this changed in \"\", where it was revealed that it was Sargeras who corrupted the eredar rather than the other way around, and that the draenei were in fact the remaining uncorrupted eredar, with the name \"draenei\" meaning \"exiled ones\".\nHell.\nThe universal belief system was later revised to the philosophy of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;. The realm from which demons are summoned was originally referred to as Hell, Hades, and the underworld, as opposed to the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;. This is not a true retcon as later sources confirm the existence of hell, although it is synonymous with the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;, which goes by many titles. Hell as one of its names has been referenced in later sources.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20I\"&gt;Warcraft I&lt;/a&gt;\", and to a lesser extent \"&lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20II\"&gt;Warcraft II&lt;/a&gt;\" &amp; \"&lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20III\"&gt;Warcraft III&lt;/a&gt;\", and in the novels, &lt;a href=\"Day%20of%20the%20Dragon\"&gt;Day of the Dragon&lt;/a&gt; specifically, the terms \"hell\", \"hells\", \"Hades\", \"lower planes\", \"the underworld\", \"damnation\", \"pit of darkness\", and \"Dark Below\" are used in a very traditional sense.\nWarcraft II: Beyond the Dark Portal.\nSometimes the words show up in the names of characters and locations, for example, &lt;a href=\"Grom%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grom Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Citadel\"&gt;Hellfire Citadel&lt;/a&gt;.\nLord of the Clans.\nEven the novel \"&lt;a href=\"Lord%20of%20the%20Clans\"&gt;Lord of the Clans&lt;/a&gt;\" made references to the word \"hell\":\nWarcraft III.\nThere is a reference to hell from &lt;a href=\"Uther%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther Lightbringer&lt;/a&gt;:\nArthas then replies back, \"We may never know, Uther, I intend to live forever.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; tells Prince &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; to, \"Give my regards to hell.\"\nNote: Underworld also refers to a secret underground hellish cavern system where ghosts, murlocs, skeletons, and other minions of a &lt;a href=\"Zar%27jira\"&gt;Sea Witch&lt;/a&gt; once resided.\nWorld of Warcraft.\n&lt;a href=\"Caelestrasz\"&gt;Caelestrasz&lt;/a&gt; states:\nThe spell &lt;a href=\"Hellfire\"&gt;Hellfire&lt;/a&gt; also exists.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nIn The Burning Crusade, the term hell is used quite often, a notable example is &lt;a href=\"Magtheridon\"&gt;Magtheridon&lt;/a&gt; being referred to as a \"hellspawn\", or Hellfire Citadel.\nHigh elven druids.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Runestone\"&gt;Runestone&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Caer%20Darrow\"&gt;Caer Darrow&lt;/a&gt; was described in the \"&lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20II\"&gt;Warcraft II&lt;/a&gt;\" manual as being crafted by elven &lt;a href=\"druids\"&gt;druids&lt;/a&gt; that used the \"magics\" connected to the \"arcane\". It has been assumed due to lack of mention of high elf druids in posterior sources, that high elf druids did not exist and were retconned out of history. This is assumed because, when the background of the &lt;a href=\"high%20elf\"&gt;high elf&lt;/a&gt; race was further developed in Warcraft III, they were depicted as a race dedicated to the free use of arcane magic, leaving behind the druidism.\n&lt;a href=\"Freywinn\"&gt;Freywinn&lt;/a&gt; in Tempest Keep appears to be evidence of a blood elven druid.\nColor of Alexstrasza's brood.\nIn Warcraft II, Alexstrasza's children are depicted as mostly Green in color with team-colored wings and hair. Broodmothers are grey with &lt;a href=\"Team%20color\"&gt;team colored&lt;/a&gt; wings and manes. Alexstrasza herself is merely described as the Queen of Dragons, with no specification to color.\nHowever &lt;a href=\"Day%20of%20the%20Dragon\"&gt;Day of the Dragon&lt;/a&gt; and subsequent lore would say these Green colored Dragons were the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Dragonflight\"&gt;Red Dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, changing their color accordingly.\nSpecies of Arthas' mercenaries.\nIn \"Warcraft III\", the mercenaries Arthas hires are explicitly non-human, composed of several &lt;a href=\"ice%20troll\"&gt;ice troll&lt;/a&gt;s and an &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;. Arthas even taking advantage of the mercenaries non-human nature by calling them \"Creatures\" and \"Foul Beasts.\" However, the &lt;a href=\"Death%20Knight%20%28manga%29\"&gt;\"Death Knight\" manga&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Reflection\"&gt;Halls of Reflection&lt;/a&gt; portray them as humans.\nHoly Light and God.\nIn ', the &lt;a href=\"Clerics%20of%20Northshire\"&gt;Clerics of Northshire&lt;/a&gt; are described as worshippers of \"&lt;a href=\"God\"&gt;God&lt;/a&gt;\", though whether or not this referred to a specific deity within a pantheon or a single deity is not known. They are also described as believing in \"&lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt;s\", \"&lt;a href=\"daemon\"&gt;daemon&lt;/a&gt;s\", \"Hell\", and \"Heaven\". This is continued through into \"&lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20II\"&gt;Warcraft II&lt;/a&gt;\", with references to \"God\", \"angels\", and \"heaven\". A reference to \"God\" is also in the church building's sound in the game, \"Deo Gratias\", Latin for \"Thanks [be] to God\", which is a traditional cathedral hymn, fitting the image of holy paladins in the game. Later, this is followed in \"Day of the Dragon\".\nThe traditional view of Hell and God is also alluded to in the novels as well; for example in \"&lt;a href=\"Day%20of%20the%20Dragon\"&gt;Day of the Dragon&lt;/a&gt;\" several of the paladins describe things by using religiously colored terms;\n\"A paladin had indicated to Rhonin that he believed that, after death, the mage's soul would be condemned to the same pit of darkness shared by the mythical demons of old. This no matter how pure Rhonin's soul might have been otherwise.\" ...a damned soul...devilish kind...\n...clearly it was chosen by a higher power that your paths would lead you to us.\n...ungodly incident...\n...sent to the underworld where they belong.\nThe religious structure and practices also keep in time with typical European medieval and even some modern Catholic structures and thought, such as the places of worship being called chapels, churches, abbeys, monasteries, and cathedrals.\nAlso, typical Christian and Catholic clergy names are employed, even up to \"World of Warcraft\", such as some male priests being called \"Father\" and \"Brother\" and prelature ranks such as Abbot, Bishop, and Archbishop.\nLike the practice of the Catholic Pope, archbishops take on a special name when they take office. Like Jarl, becoming Archbishop &lt;a href=\"Benedictus\"&gt;Benedictus&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlso, in the original \"Warcraft\" and \"Day of the Dragon\", something similar to the practice of Confession is described, as mentioned in the description for the cleric's invisibility cast (as a tool to make the confessing of secrets that weighed heavily upon the souls of worshippers easier to speak) as quoted from the guide, and in \"Day of the Dragon\" when Rhonin is asked to confess his sins to bring peace to his damned soul.\nAll this could just be ascribed to the developers and writers trying to make the stories seem more \"Medieval\" with no real implications to actual religion implied. It does seem that in later versions of \"Warcraft\" the developers avoided most references to anything that could be tied to any actual religious practice, and made the \"Light\" ambiguous in nature, so one could not really label it as being a parody or impersonation of any particular religion. In &lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt; and later games, followers of the Holy Light are described as following the Holy Light and no reference to \"God\" is found. In Warcraft III, however, &lt;a href=\"angels\"&gt;\"angels\"&lt;/a&gt; appear during the Resurrection spell, and \"angels\" are still alluded to in \"World of Warcraft\".\nBy the time of \"Warcraft III\", they are shown as followers of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;, which is described as a philosophy that does not follow any particular theology, although a reference to a single all-powerful god-like being creating the universe is mentioned in the manual and &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt;s appear during resurrection spells. It is unknown as to whether or not the individuals worship this deity.\n&lt;a href=\"Iblis%2C%20Blade%20of%20the%20Fallen%20Seraph\"&gt;Iblis, Blade of the Fallen Seraph&lt;/a&gt;, seems to be a reference to a fallen angel as well.\n&lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Healer\"&gt;Spirit Healer&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20of%20Redemption\"&gt;Spirits of Redemption&lt;/a&gt; have the form of angelic beings as well, though the former have been established as &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the preview information released regarding the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; race for \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;The Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;\" expansion, the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; were referenced as \"a race of sapient energy beings bent on stopping the Burning Crusade\" and that they \"blessed the draenei with Light-given knowledge and power\". The naaru may explain the origin of the Holy Light or at least demonstrate that the Holy Light is an interplanetary force not restricted only to the &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;world of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, it's known that the naaru are also a source of Holy Light power, as blood elves have found a way of draining a naaru of its powers, in order to wield divine powers as &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knights\"&gt;Blood Knights&lt;/a&gt;.\nAdditionally, according to \"&lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20III\"&gt;Warcraft III&lt;/a&gt;\"'s manual, one legend states that the creation of the universe was from a single all-powerful entity. The concept of God likely originated from this legend. See &lt;a href=\"Creation%20Myth\"&gt;Creation Myth&lt;/a&gt;.\nAdditionally, \"&lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Player%27s%20Guide\"&gt;Alliance Player's Guide&lt;/a&gt;\" tends to switch between the points of view that the Light seems to be a sapient entity of some kind; while it may not be an individual it may be a force. But it says little is known as the philosophies have been changing over the years especially since many of the original books discussing the Holy Light were destroyed during the various wars, especially during the third war.\nIllidan's bandana.\nIn the book \"War of the Ancients: &lt;a href=\"The%20Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;The Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;\", Illidan is said to have been given an amber bandana (the color of his lost eyes) by Lady Vashj after having his eyes burnt out by Sargeras. This contradicts all in-game depictions of Illidan, as he is seen wearing a black bandana in \"&lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20III\"&gt;Warcraft III&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\". The bandana which drops from him is also black and appears to have been given to him by Sargeras, as it is called \"&lt;a href=\"Cursed%20Vision%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Cursed Vision of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;\", rather than by Lady Vashj. It is possible he lost his old bandana during the 10,000 years, or it grew black with time, so this may not necessarily be a retcon.\nAlternately, it is possible that this stems from the change made to the timeline in &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients%20%28novel%20account%29\"&gt;War of the Ancients (novel account)&lt;/a&gt; in which Illidan's bandana was given to him by Sargeras after burning out his eyes as Illidan was feigning service to the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; at the time.\nKil'jaeden and the orcs.\nAccording to the \"&lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20II\"&gt;Warcraft II&lt;/a&gt;\" manual, it was &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; who first discovered &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; as he probed the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; as part of his magical studies, with his mentor &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; seemingly being unaware of Kil'jaeden's existence. The \"&lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20III\"&gt;Warcraft III&lt;/a&gt;\" manual, however, established that Kil'jaeden first contacted Ner'zhul on his own, and only turned to Gul'dan after finding out that Ner'zhul didn't want to go all the way with carrying out Kil'jaeden's plans. Subsequent lore followed this version of the story.\nKul Tiras.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20II\"&gt;Warcraft II&lt;/a&gt;\", the \"Tiras\" part of the &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; name was pronounced with the second syllable stressed, and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Last%20Guardian\"&gt;The Last Guardian&lt;/a&gt;\" gives the adjective form of Kul Tiras as \"Tirassian\". However, in \"\", the \"Tiras\" in Kul Tiras is pronounced with the first syllable stressed, and the adjective form of Kul Tiras is \"Kul Tiran\".\nOrc warlocks in \"World of Warcraft\".\nUnder the leadership of Thrall, the orcs have rediscovered their ancient Shamanistic traditions. In an attempt to rid the Horde of its demonic corruption, Thrall banned the use of warlock magic and necromancy. Now, all orc magic users practice shaman magic which draws its power from the natural world and the elements.\nHowever, in \"World of Warcraft\", the orcs have begun training warlocks once again. Though they are looked down upon by society and barely tolerated, much like human warlocks. This could be reconciled by the suggestion that the Horde's warlocks are their equivalent of &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Hunter\"&gt;Demon Hunter&lt;/a&gt;s (using the powers of darkness against their masters). This is backed up by the orc warlock quests where the warlock trainees do good deeds like reuniting two lovers.\nOrcish clan names.\nSome &lt;a href=\"Clan%23Orc%20clans\"&gt;orcish clans&lt;/a&gt; had names from something found only in &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, but were supposed to have that name since they were on &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;:\nBlackrock clan skin color.\nIn the Warcraft RTS games as well as artwork and canceled games, Blackrock orcs who are often portrayed as the iconic orc clan, have the same green skin color as the other or clans. Characters from the Blackrock clan like &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; also have green skin.\nHowever, in &lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;, many members of the Blackrock clan have, unlike other orcs, a gray skintone. There are only a few exceptions such as Varok Saurfang and the Horde pieces in the Karazhan chess event. \"&lt;a href=\"Tides%20of%20War\"&gt;Tides of War&lt;/a&gt;\" revealed that this skin tone is a result of the clan living inside of &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt; without sunlight for years. But in &lt;a href=\"Warlords%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Warlords of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, the Blackrock orcs are shown to already have had the gray skin tone back on &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, seemingly being a natural identification of their clan.\nOrcish shamans.\nThough the fact that the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;ish culture has been &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;istic before &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;'s rise to power has already been established in \"&lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20II\"&gt;Warcraft II&lt;/a&gt;\", the lore regarding the nature of shamanic magic has changed. In \"Warcraft II\"'s manual it was said that Gul'dan rose in his standing among other shamans because of his talent for \"channeling the cold, negative-energies of the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;\", however, in current lore it is warlock spellcasters that manipulate the energies of the Nether, while shamans call on elemental spirits for aid. This would explain why some orcs after the rise of the &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s still retained the title of Shaman, such as &lt;a href=\"Zuluhed%20the%20Whacked\"&gt;Zuluhed the Whacked&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;, which is unexplained in the current lore, since it states that ancestral and elemental spirits stopped answering the shamans' calls as corruption took root in the orcish society.\nRend and Maim.\n&lt;a href=\"Rend%20Blackhand\"&gt;Rend&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Maim%20Blackhand\"&gt;Maim&lt;/a&gt;, the sons of &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; the Destroyer, led the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Tooth%20Grin%20clan\"&gt;Black Tooth Grin clan&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, after their defeat they ran away, set up a base in Blackrock Spire and formed the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Horde\"&gt;Dark Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey next appeared without mention during the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20the%20Blood%20Elves\"&gt;Alliance campaign&lt;/a&gt; of \"\", in the service of &lt;a href=\"Magtheridon\"&gt;Magtheridon&lt;/a&gt;, inexplicably on &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; and transformed into &lt;a href=\"fel%20orc\"&gt;fel orc&lt;/a&gt;s: &lt;a href=\"Rend%20%28fel%20orc%29\"&gt;Rend (fel orc)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Maim%20%28fel%20orc%29\"&gt;Maim (fel orc)&lt;/a&gt;\".\nAdditionally, the Black Tooth Grin clan was said to be \"almost destroyed\" at the end of the 2nd War in the non-canon RPG. \nHowever, in \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" Rend appears in a prominent role as head of the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock clan&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, and Maim is stated to be killed by the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt; in Azeroth.\nShadowmoon Valley's appearance.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt; trailer for &lt;a href=\"patch%202.1\"&gt;patch 2.1&lt;/a&gt;, the still uncorrupted &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Karabor\"&gt;Temple of Karabor&lt;/a&gt; looked like the modern &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt;, with simple brown tiles and occasional blue crystals. In \"&lt;a href=\"Warlords%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Warlords of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;\" however, the Temple of Karabor's appearance is closer to that of the \"&lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt;\".\nSwamp of Sorrows.\nIn ', the swamp was called the \"Swamps of Sorrow\", and was already called so during the events of that game. It was also located to the south of &lt;a href=\"Black%20Morass\"&gt;Black Morass&lt;/a&gt;, rather than to the north. The manual to ' renames it to the Swamp of Sorrows, and this name carries over to \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\". \"\" introduces another retcon by saying that the swamp had only been named so after the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; to honor those who had died in the war.\nFrostmourne.\nIn ', &lt;a href=\"Tichondrius\"&gt;Tichondrius&lt;/a&gt; claimed that the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; forged the sword. However, ' revealed that the &lt;a href=\"Nathrezim\"&gt;Nathrezim&lt;/a&gt; forged it, thus invalidating Tichondrius' first statement because, if his race created the sword, it would be odd that their leader knew a different origin.\nIn , it's revealed that it was crafted at the &lt;a href=\"Runecarver%27s%20Oubliette\"&gt;Runecarver's Oubliette&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Torghast%2C%20Tower%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Torghast&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Runecarver\"&gt;Runecarver&lt;/a&gt;, who was forced against his will to do so by &lt;a href=\"the%20Jailer\"&gt;the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Warcraft I\" and \"II\".\n\"&lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20I\"&gt;Warcraft I&lt;/a&gt;\" featured two separate storylines. While there were some interweaving events, most were stand-alone, which lead to some contradictory elements. Some elements from each storyline were taken and included in the backstory for the next game in the series.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20II\"&gt;Warcraft II&lt;/a&gt;\" evolved with two campaign stories that wove together in a tighter way, with references to missions from one campaign being mentioned in the events of the other campaign, although the final missions lead to alternate endings. \"Warcraft II: Beyond the Dark Portal\" was unique, however, in that it was a completely linear story; it set the Alliance campaign after the Orc campaign chronologically (though one could play the campaigns in any order).\n\"&lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20III\"&gt;Warcraft III&lt;/a&gt;\" featured campaigns with story lines that similarly formed a single linear narrative, but they were unlocked only after the previous campaign was completed.\n\"Warcraft I\".\n\"Warcraft I\" featured many levels which are best described as generic battles with some interweaving plot elements, and contradictory endings.\nNote that no later source has given any detailed analysis of all the events of the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;. Not all the battles or locations have been referenced in later sources. As such, skirmishes and events surrounding said locations are up in the air. Some of these locations include &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Hamlet\"&gt;Grand Hamlet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sunnyglade\"&gt;Sunnyglade&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kyross\"&gt;Kyross&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Rockard\"&gt;Rockard&lt;/a&gt;. The history of defense, rebuilding, and destruction surrounding these locations is unknown as they have never been mentioned again in later sources.\nWhile the orc campaign ending most closely matches the outcome of the First War as portrayed in later games, both and the manual for the game contained important plot points that became part of the lore:\nSome elements of the game's plotlines were expressly left out of the ultimate account of the war:\nOther events are indeterminate, not conflicting with any other accounts, but also not being referred to again:\n\"Warcraft II\".\n\"Warcraft II\" featured two interweaving campaigns with two separate and alternate endings. The true ending was found in the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; campaign, with the nearly complete defeat of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;. The expansion went further by making its own campaigns linear, with the Horde campaign taking place entirely before the Alliance campaign:\nEvents that occurred in one of the \"Warcraft II\" campaigns, but which did not ultimately form part of the lore, include:\nOther events are indeterminate, not conflicting with any other accounts, but also not being referred to again:\nWrynn.\n&lt;a href=\"Wrynn\"&gt;Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; was initially given as the single name of the king of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; at the time of orcish invasion, King &lt;a href=\"Wrynn%20III\"&gt;Wrynn III&lt;/a&gt;, with his son being called &lt;a href=\"Llane%20Wrynn%20I\"&gt;King Llane&lt;/a&gt;. Wrynn was later used as the family name of the Stormwind royal line, being applied as Llane's surname, as well as that of his son and grandson.\nWyvern sentience.\nIn Warcraft III, &lt;a href=\"wyvern\"&gt;wyvern&lt;/a&gt;s are said to be sentient and willing allies of the Horde, however, in a quest in &lt;a href=\"Thousand%20Needles\"&gt;Thousand Needles&lt;/a&gt;, the Wyvern trainer &lt;a href=\"Elu\"&gt;Elu&lt;/a&gt; asks the player to steal wyvern eggs to train as mounts.\nHowever, this is not necessarily a true retcon according to the (non-canon) &lt;a href=\"Manual%20of%20Monsters\"&gt;Manual of Monsters&lt;/a&gt;, which states that there are certain Wyvern groups that are willing Horde allies, and some groups that are not. Specifically, the ones that are allies were the ones (and their descendants) that the Horde set free from the harpies when Thrall first arrived to Kalimdor (: &lt;a href=\"The%20Invasion%20of%20Kalimdor\"&gt;Orc Campaign&lt;/a&gt;).

Revered by miners and &lt;a href=\"blacksmith\"&gt;blacksmith&lt;/a&gt;s, Rethu was one of the first tauren settlers in the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;. His descendants carry on his traditions of metalworking at the &lt;a href=\"Ironhorn%20Enclave\"&gt;Ironhorn Enclave&lt;/a&gt;, near the top of &lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20Peak\"&gt;Highmountain Peak&lt;/a&gt;.\nHis weapon was the &lt;a href=\"%3ASpear%20of%20Rethu\"&gt;:Spear of Rethu&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nIn his youth, Rethu Ironhorn walked the land, carving out caves and canyons and even speaking to the rocks. Some stories say that this rock-speech was the reason he was ejected from his original tribe.\nRethu was the first of his kind to set hoof on &lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20Peak\"&gt;Highmountain Peak&lt;/a&gt;. He made a plateau near the top of the peak his home and raised his children there, and some say that he carved the &lt;a href=\"Ironhorn%20Enclave\"&gt;Ironhorn Enclave&lt;/a&gt; out of the mountain itself. All stories of him mention his patience, and most also describe his wisdom. His bravery was said to be contagious.\nHe may have been the greatest miner the tauren have ever known, but he was not afraid to share his knowledge with the rest of the herd: in addition to training his own children, he also took on apprentices, and many greenhoofs ascended Highmountain to seek him out and learn what he had to teach. Rethu's knowledge of &lt;a href=\"leystone%20Ore\"&gt;leystone Ore&lt;/a&gt; was legendary, and he also worked with ore similar to the modern-day &lt;a href=\"%3Afelslate\"&gt;:felslate&lt;/a&gt;; much like modern times, the time period during which Rethu lived was plagued by &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s. He owned a journal in which he logged mining techniques he was working on. He owned many different mining picks, as the stories claim that he went through them almost weekly. One of the many stories told about Rethu detail the day he lost one of his horns in battle. Rethu also owned a &lt;a href=\"Spear%20of%20Rethu\"&gt;spear&lt;/a&gt;, which at some point made its way to &lt;a href=\"Neltharion%27s%20Lair\"&gt;Neltharion's Lair&lt;/a&gt;.\nNo one knows what ultimately happened to the miner. He left the enclave while they slept and never returned. Some say he sailed off in search of new challenges, while others say that he dug too deep and uncovered something he shouldn't have. Regardless, Rethu's legacy lives on, and to this day some of the inhabitants of the Ironhorn Enclave bear his surname.\nWhile mining in the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s may occasionally encounter Rethu's spirit. During one of these encounters, Rethu will commend the adventurer for fighting for their ore, saying that he believes that to be the most noble way to obtain the stone, as it \"gives the land a fighting chance\". He then warns them to not be callous with their own life and that if one digs too deep, the land will overcome them. Before disapearing, he also mentions that \"no stone is worth the price I paid\" before saying that that is a tale for another day. When told of this, &lt;a href=\"Ronos%20Ironhorn\"&gt;Ronos Ironhorn&lt;/a&gt; at the Ironhorn Enclave interprets Rethu's words to mean that he was \"taken\" by the &lt;a href=\"Earth%20Mother\"&gt;Earthmother&lt;/a&gt;."}
