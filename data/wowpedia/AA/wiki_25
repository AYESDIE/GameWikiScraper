At minimal power, they can be used to open the iris a fraction, drawing Malygos's ire. &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; did so during the &lt;a href=\"Nexus%20War\"&gt;Nexus War&lt;/a&gt; which allowed them to engage and kill the blue Aspect with the help of &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThrall: Twilight of the Aspects.\nMalygos had used his own blood to activate and control this orb, which had lain dormant for millennia. With the open Focusing Iris, Malygos had been able to direct (and create) powerful &lt;a href=\"surge%20needle\"&gt;surge needle&lt;/a&gt;s, using them to pull arcane magic from Azeroth's ley lines and channeling that magic into the Nexus. The slain &lt;a href=\"Arygos\"&gt;Arygos&lt;/a&gt;' blood, he being a son and direct blood relative of Malygos, was used by to use a surge needle (with energies flowing \"from\" the Nexus) to animate &lt;a href=\"Chromatus\"&gt;Chromatus&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt was previously mentioned that once harnessed, the energies are focused through the Nexus' ascending rings and blasted into the Twisting Nether. In \"Thrall: Twilight of the Aspects\", this function of the Nexus is not mentioned. It is implied that the diverted energies were stored there.\nThe Demon Soul.\nAs part of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt; raid introduced in &lt;a href=\"patch%204.3.0\"&gt;patch 4.3.0&lt;/a&gt;, adventurers have to get the Focusing Iris so the Dragon Aspects can refocus their power into the Dragon Soul to use the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Demon Soul&lt;/a&gt; artifact against &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;.\nJaina Proudmoore: Tides of War.\nReflecting on its misuse in the past and its potential for future misuse, &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; ordered the Focusing Iris moved to a more secure location - encased in enchanted ice, magically warded, and dumped at the bottom of the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Sea\"&gt;Frozen Sea&lt;/a&gt;. However, the dragons sent to escort it were ambushed and killed by members of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, who stole the Focusing Iris and used it to augment a &lt;a href=\"mana%20bomb\"&gt;mana bomb&lt;/a&gt; built by &lt;a href=\"Thalen%20Songweaver\"&gt;Thalen Songweaver&lt;/a&gt; to obliterate &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore Isle&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile walking through the ruins of her city, &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; discovered the Focusing Iris at the bottom of the blast crater, and decided to use it to exact vengeance on the Horde. Studying a book of powerful magic originally discovered by &lt;a href=\"Antonidas\"&gt;Antonidas&lt;/a&gt;, she went to &lt;a href=\"Fray%20Island\"&gt;Fray Island&lt;/a&gt; and used the Focusing Iris first to summon thousands of &lt;a href=\"water%20elemental\"&gt;water elemental&lt;/a&gt;s, and then to bind them together into a massive tidal wave with the intention of destroying &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;. After being talked down by &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and Kalecgos, she returned the Focusing Iris to the latter, who decided that the safest place for it would be in the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; vaults in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nThe Focusing Iris is stolen from Dalaran's vault by &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Xylem\"&gt;Archmage Xylem&lt;/a&gt;, whose mind has been eroded by a grimoire he found in the &lt;a href=\"Legash%20Encampment\"&gt;Legash Encampment&lt;/a&gt; and who now serves the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. He seeks to use it to become the most powerful mage ever. When Xylem is confronted by an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; sent by Kalecgos, Xylem flees through a portal with the Iris.\nXylem fled to the Eye of Eternity, where he could use the Focusing Iris to wreak untold havoc on Azeroth's ley lines and siphon their energy directly into himself. Drained of magic, Azeroth would be ripe for destruction by his &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; masters and his power would become limitless. However, Xylem's sanity was eventually restored and the Focusing Iris returned to Dalaran."}

{"id": "186957", "revid": "39381941", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=186957", "title": "The Forest of Elwynn (WC1 Human)", "text": "The Forest of Elwynn is the fifth mission of the &lt;a href=\"Human\"&gt;Human&lt;/a&gt; campaign in \"\".\nMission briefing.\n\"The &lt;a href=\"Elwynn%20Forest\"&gt;Forest of Elwynn&lt;/a&gt; is a strategic key to securing the &lt;a href=\"Borderlands\"&gt;Borderlands&lt;/a&gt;. An outpost near the southeast edge of the forest will serve as your stronghold. The &lt;a href=\"Llane%20Wrynn%20I\"&gt;King&lt;/a&gt; has assigned one of his &lt;a href=\"knight\"&gt;knight&lt;/a&gt;s to aid &lt;a href=\"Defender%20of%20the%20Crown\"&gt;you&lt;/a&gt;, so that your task of ridding the area of &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt;'s dark minions may be more readily completed.\"\nGuide.\nSend one Peasant to the Gold Mine north of the base and send the other Peasant to the lumber patch south of the base. Train peasants and get started on your economy. You will want 10-12 for an efficient operation (Around 9 for gold and 3 for lumber). Once you have a clear path to the south Gold Mine, you can send Peasants to mine from there, as well. Your starting forces can handle the first 2-3 waves without too much trouble, but try to make an effort to keep them alive. Enemy waves always approach from the west, but once in a while they will show up closer to the very bottom of the map, so make sure the whole area west of your base is well-scouted.\nThe mission introduces a new unit: Knights. They are not cheap, require a fair bit of extra tech (A &lt;a href=\"Blacksmith%20%28WC1%20Human%29\"&gt;Blacksmith&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stables%20%28WC1%20Human%29\"&gt;Stables&lt;/a&gt; are required to train them, but they bring durability and heavier attack power than a Footman while still costing only one supply. The enemy base is surrounded by Raiders and a wave of Archers may not be enough to bring them down before they cut your forces to pieces, so make sure you have Knights to deal with them.\nWhen economy permits, get a Church going. Healing is already researched, so you can skip straight to building Clerics and heal your troops to keep them alive. Two should be enough to keep your forces alive while you build them up, though you may want 3-4 when you are ready to push.\nThe player will have access to several new upgrades for swords, shields and faster horses. Faster horses is not an essential for this mission, but you should (at least) get the first upgrades for swords and shields when you can afford them.\nThe enemy behaves similar to the previous base mission: They send waves of units while gradually increasing their numbers: The longer you take, the larger the waves will become. The only real difference is they add Raiders to the mix.\nWhen you build up a large enough force of Knights and Archer (at least 6-8 Knights, a dozen Archers and 3-4 Clerics), move to the narrow forest opening along the west side of the map, setup an Archer ambush and move a fast-moving unit forward (Knight has better survivability) to lure the large group of Spearman forward. Have your Clerics ready on the heal and recover troops when possible to minimize losses. Advance through the forest and pick out and stragglers along the way. Before heading west to the enemy base, setup another Archer ambush and keep Knights on hand in case you meet heavy resistance. Use a Knight to lure what you can to your ambush for maximize damage. Repeat this process until you finally reach the base and proceed to lay waste to the Barracks and Temple before worrying about anything else. Once they have been destroyed, finish off everything else."}

It has 382,000 health (at level 100) and frost mage abilities, like a &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Nova\"&gt;Frost Nova&lt;/a&gt; with a cast time and &lt;a href=\"Blizzard\"&gt;Blizzard&lt;/a&gt;.\nStage 2: Meltdown.\nWalk up to the first wall and destroy it. Upon entering the next room:\nThe next two rooms have constant falling ice blocks, much like the &lt;a href=\"Pit%20of%20Saron\"&gt;Pit of Saron&lt;/a&gt; gauntlet before &lt;a href=\"Scourgelord%20Tyrannus\"&gt;Scourgelord Tyrannus&lt;/a&gt;. Steer clear of the Frost Blocks to avoid spawning more geists as well. Continue destroying &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Wall%20%28Icecrown%29\"&gt;Ice Walls&lt;/a&gt;. After destroying the third ice wall, enter the &lt;a href=\"Spire\"&gt;Spire&lt;/a&gt; and turn north, heading counterclockwise. Clear another necromancer and two skeletons, then two more geists and a &lt;a href=\"Wretched%20Horror\"&gt;Wretched Horror&lt;/a&gt; with 191,000 health each (at level 100). It only has basic melee and a slow-to-cast Hulking Kick that can be sidestepped.\nClear the last wall to enter the &lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Hall\"&gt;Crimson Hall&lt;/a&gt; and begin the next stage.\nStage 3: Hot on the Trail.\nAfter destroying the fourth wall, Lyandra appears in front of a wall of flame in the far part of the hallway.\nLyandra summons five &lt;a href=\"Exploding%20Ghoul\"&gt;Exploding Ghoul&lt;/a&gt;s with 35,476 health each (at level 100). Spread a &lt;a href=\"Living%20Bomb\"&gt;Living Bomb&lt;/a&gt; or three around (if so talented), wind up a &lt;a href=\"Flamestrike\"&gt;Flamestrike&lt;/a&gt;, then use &lt;a href=\"Dragon%27s%20Breath\"&gt;Dragon's Breath&lt;/a&gt; to hopefully finish one off and trigger explosions to kill the rest.\nLyandra summons two &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Skeleton\"&gt;Burning Skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s with 124,000 health (at level 100). They have a Burning Smash frontal cone attack that can be sidestepped.\nShe finally summons &lt;a href=\"Charbone\"&gt;Charbone&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"plague-dog\"&gt;plague-dog&lt;/a&gt; with 177,000 health (at level 100), before running past the fiery barrier into the Crimson Hall. Take out Charbone to start the next stage.\nStage 4: Playing With Fire.\nLyandra is standing with Felo'melorn in hand in the center of the Crimson Hall, with a pile of scattered bones behind her.\nLyandra has 295,000 health (at level 100) and uses Fireball, Pyroblast (interruptible), and Phoenix Reborn, which deals damage in a 4 yard radius around a selected area.\nAggro:\nAt around 60%, Lyandra teleports backwards and becomes engulfed in a Wreath of Flames, making her immune to all physical and magical damage.\nShe then immediately raises &lt;a href=\"Gorewing%20the%20Awakened\"&gt;Gorewing the Awakened&lt;/a&gt; from the bones on the floor to attack the player. Gorewing is a &lt;a href=\"bone%20wraith\"&gt;bone wraith&lt;/a&gt; with 152,000 health (at level 100). Its main ability is a Bone Storm-like Flame Whirl. Try to stay out of the area of effect by using &lt;a href=\"Scorch\"&gt;Scorch&lt;/a&gt; on the move, then planting and using bigger attacks. Right after Gorewing is summoned, however, Aethas Sunreaver teleports in to distract Lyandra.\nAethas then uses Spellbind to imprison Lyandra with arcane magic. Upon killing Gorewing, however, Aethas gets knocked back and stunned by Arcane Backlash, allowing Lyandra to once again attack the player.\nFinish Lyandra off.\nFinal Stage: The Flamestrike.\nFelo'melorn appears in the center of the room amidst a fiery explosion. Aethas has recovered from the backlash and walks over to stand next to the blade.\nAfter looting Felo'melorn, Aethas opens a &lt;a href=\"Mage%20Portal\"&gt;Mage Portal&lt;/a&gt; back to Dalaran.\nBack in Dalaran, walk in to the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Citadel\"&gt;Violet Citadel&lt;/a&gt; to see Aethas under guard in front of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Six\"&gt;Council of Six&lt;/a&gt;:\nTurn in to Modera. The next quest, &lt;a href=\"The%20Champion%27s%20Return\"&gt;The Champion's Return&lt;/a&gt;, is offered automatically, but the dialogue continues:"}

Med'an's thoughts are occupied by the vision Medivh sent him, and he wonders if Meryl knows his father's identity. He concludes that the old &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; doesn't know since he thinks that no one could love the son of a monster like Medivh in the way that Meryl loves Med'an. Med'an decides that he won't go to Karazhan and looks forward to the opportunity to enter Outland to escape his father's summons.\nMeryl teleports to &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; and meets with his old friend &lt;a href=\"High%20Priest%20Rohan\"&gt;High Priest Rohan&lt;/a&gt;, informing him of the threat posed by &lt;a href=\"C%27Thun\"&gt;the Old One&lt;/a&gt; and the plan to create a new &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Council of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt;. Rohan is receptive to the plan but warns that they might not want to involve &lt;a href=\"Krank%20Axeljink\"&gt;Krank Axeljink&lt;/a&gt; since he places more faith in technology than is wise. However, Meryl insists on seeing what the &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt; says.

Meryl comments that it might have been a bad idea to involve the gnome. While Krank continues talking of all the mechanical components he'll need, Rohan tells Meryl that he and Krank will likely end up with a lot of luggage and will take a ship to Theramore. Meryl teleports away, having \"another stop to make\".\nMaraad and Med'an emerge from the Dark Portal and fly over &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;. Maraad comments that the forces of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; have scoured much of Outland of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; but continue to guard the Dark Portal against &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; incursions. While flying over the &lt;a href=\"Path%20of%20Glory\"&gt;Path of Glory&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"vindicator\"&gt;vindicator&lt;/a&gt; grimly explains that it is paved with the crushed bones of &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; who were slain by the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;original, demon-corrupted Horde&lt;/a&gt;. The pair continue into &lt;a href=\"Terokkar%20Forest\"&gt;Terokkar Forest&lt;/a&gt; and take a slight detour to &lt;a href=\"Auchindoun\"&gt;Auchindoun&lt;/a&gt;, which Maraad wants his nephew to see to help him understand what &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; was once like. He explains that the tomb-city was once the sacred mausoleum of the draenei, but it and the &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Wastes\"&gt;surrounding countryside&lt;/a&gt; were destroyed when the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt; released the creature &lt;a href=\"Murmur\"&gt;Murmur&lt;/a&gt;. Med'an reflects that he perhaps belongs in exile in Outland, being the son of a demon-serving &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; monster and of the mad &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s who ruined Draenor.\nAs the pair approach &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt; to meet with &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;, Maraad explains that the &lt;a href=\"archmage\"&gt;archmage&lt;/a&gt; was once Medivh's assistant and helped expose the wizard's crimes alongside Med'an's mother. Med'an is confused that everyone would willingly trust a man who not only served Medivh but also has some sympathy for him. The two gryphons land on the &lt;a href=\"Terrace%20of%20Light\"&gt;Terrace of Light&lt;/a&gt; and Maraad introduces his nephew to Khadgar, who notes that he can see the vindicator's likeness \"and more\" in the boy.\nAtop the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Rocks\"&gt;Red Rocks&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hamuul%20Runetotem\"&gt;Hamuul Runetotem&lt;/a&gt; holds a ceremony for a &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; woman and child that were killed by &lt;a href=\"Bristleback%20tribe\"&gt;Bristleback&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"quilboar\"&gt;quilboar&lt;/a&gt;. He reflects that between the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt;, and the trouble in &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;, all of Azeroth seems threatened, and even the Bristleback seem more aggressive than usual. He is interrupted in his ponderings by a quilboar ambush but manages to call on lightning to kill the invaders. The display is witnessed by Rehgar and Valeera, who arrive on &lt;a href=\"wyvern\"&gt;wyvern&lt;/a&gt;s. Rehgar explains to Valeera how Hamuul sought out and received &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;ic training from &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; after being stirred by the dedication of the druids at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Battle of Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;. The orc and &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elf&lt;/a&gt; greet Hamuul (who is surprised to see Rehgar in the company of one of his former champions from &lt;a href=\"Dire%20Maul\"&gt;Dire Maul&lt;/a&gt;) and begin to explain their plan to the tauren.\nIn Shattrath, Khadgar agrees that the creation of a New Council of Tirisfal is important but states that he must remain in Outland for now. He suggests that they take the &lt;a href=\"Scryers\"&gt;Scryer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Magisters\"&gt;magistrix&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dalynnia%20Wrathscar\"&gt;Dalynnia Wrathscar&lt;/a&gt; in his stead. While Maraad talks to Dalynnia, Khadgar takes Med'an aside to ask about his parentage. After a moment of consideration, Med'an tells Khadgar that he is the son of Medivh and explains how his mother Garona was brutally raised by &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;. Khadgar reflects that both of Med'an's parents were doomed before they were born. Med'an is confused at this, and the archmage explains that Medivh was possessed since before his birth by the corrupted &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;. The wizard's behavior was erratic, but sometimes (when Sargeras' attention was focused elsewhere), Khadgar would see the real Medivh, a powerful but charming and intelligent man who fought his possession. The archmage finishes by assuring Med'an that \"Even the most powerful of demonic forces cannot always foresee the results of their plotting... and for all their power, you may yet be their undoing\".\nMeryl teleports to Ahn'Qiraj but is weakened by the effort. &lt;a href=\"Kathra%27natir\"&gt;Kathra'natir&lt;/a&gt; points out that the mage is using much of his waning &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; magic to keep the &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; in check, but Meryl affirms that he remains in control despite Kathra'natir's efforts. The mage teleports to another part of Ahn'Qiraj to reunite with Garona, who is spying on Cho'gall. He tells her that her son is safe in Outland with his uncle, but lso that she should have told him who Med'an's father was. The conversation is interrupted when Cho'gall begins a monologue to his followers below. He recites the prophecy concerning Med'an:\nCho'gall declares that he will weaken the barrier between Azeroth and the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Plane\"&gt;Elemental Plane&lt;/a&gt; to allow his master to reclaim its &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt; servants and send them rampaging through Azeroth. This will lure the spellcasters at Theramore into sending Med'an to Ahn'Qiraj to stop the ogre, allowing Cho'gall to kill the boy and open the way for his master's return. Garona notes that if Cho'gall is successful, the threat of the elementals could even rival that of the Lich King. However, Meryl assures her that there is still hope; as he learned from Rohan earlier, the base of Atiesh lies somewhere within Ahn'Qiraj, and its power could aid them against Cho'gall.\nKrank and Rohan arrive in Theramore, followed shortly after by Hamuul, Rehgar, and Valeera. They gather inside the keep with Aegwynn and Jaina, who explains how the original Council of Tirisfal was formed almost 3,000 years earlier to combat demons that were slipping into Azeroth. The council was most effective when they channeled their power through a single champion, a Guardian. Through a special ceremony, the council would hand their combined power to the Guardian, who then physically faced the danger while remaining in magical communion with the rest of the council. When the battles were over, the Guardian returned their borrowed power. Aegwynn continues that the new Guardian facing the threats of the present day will need both the capacity to handle the immense power surge and the ability to wield magic from different disciplines, and that she only knows of one person who fits these criteria: Med'an. However, Krank is indignant at the thought of asking \"some untried mixed-race child\" to be Guardian and offers to instead demonstrate the invention he has created to combine the different magics of the council.\nIn Ahn'Qiraj, Cho'gall conducts the ritual to rend the barrier to the Elemental Plane, unleashing giant elementals across Azeroth. He tells them to attack where their master orders them but to focus especially on Theramore. Having scried the location of the base of Atiesh, Meryl tells Garona that she will find the weapon within the belly of &lt;a href=\"C%27Thun\"&gt;C'Thun&lt;/a&gt;'s corpse. He instructs her not to touch it directly and to instead wrap it in a cloth, as it is filled with demonic energies. As he is too drained for another teleport, Meryl draws on some of Kathra'natir's &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; power to travel to Theramore to warn the council of what is coming and tell them the wording of the prophecy. As he departs, he tells Garona that the choices they all make now will mean Azeroth's salvation or destruction.\nMeryl arrives in Theramore, where Krank is in the process of handing out helmets to the council members, claiming that the headgear will feed their magics into the machine and convert them into a form that can be wielded by the wearer of the master helmet (Krank, that is). Meryl is outraged at Krank's plan, saying that it will be less than useless against what is coming, and warns the other council members of what Cho'gall has done. He tells them to look out the window, where the huge elementals have already arrived.\nIn Shattrath, Maraad thanks Khadgar for his help and says that Dalynnia will make a fine addition to the council. Med'an thanks the archmage as well, saying that he has answered many questions for him, including perhaps the most important one of all. As the group prepares to leave, &lt;a href=\"A%27dal\"&gt;A'dal&lt;/a&gt; tells Med'an to meditate carefully on his choices, for the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; has given him great gifts, but making the wrong choice could lead to Azeroth's doom. As Maraad, Med'an, and Dalynnia fly away from Shattrath, Med'an wonders if he should turn away from Medivh or answer his father's call to join him at Karazhan."}

Exploring, you find a pair of ghosts at the gates to the castle of Caer Darrow. Far from being mindless wights, &lt;a href=\"Eva%20Sarkhoff\"&gt;Eva&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lucien%20Sarkhoff\"&gt;Lucien&lt;/a&gt; Sarkhoff have retained enough of themselves to talk to.\nEva tells you of how they had been servants of House &lt;a href=\"Barov\"&gt;Barov&lt;/a&gt; before the coming of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. Greed brought down House Barov. The Barovs bargained with &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; in order to maintain their holdings personally, well past their lifetimes. The Keep became a school of &lt;a href=\"Necromancy\"&gt;Necromancy&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Cult of the Damned&lt;/a&gt;, and the Barovs became gradually more twisted and depraved. Foul beings took up residence in parts of the house. Servants began disappearing, with tortured screams ringing through the house giving clue to their fates.\nWith nowhere else to go, the Sarkhoffs hid in their quarters. Eventually, though, their luck ran out and they were captured and brought to a person they came to know as \"&lt;a href=\"Theolen%20Krastinov\"&gt;the Butcher&lt;/a&gt;\". Krastinov tortured them for weeks in his efforts to produce a plague, using magic to keep them alive. Eventually, the plague was finished. The Butcher revived the Sarkhoffs from death's door only to have them devoured alive by his &lt;a href=\"ghoul\"&gt;ghoul&lt;/a&gt;s.\nUnable to leave, their souls remain, crying for justice. They ask your help.\nEntry to Scholomance.\nAs the &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20Key\"&gt;Skeleton Key&lt;/a&gt; is required for entry into Scholomance, the quest chain may be considered a prerequisite. Since the key is only needed to gain access to the instance portal, it is only necessary for one person present to have the key. Alternately, a rogue with 280 skill in lockpicking, or equivalent &lt;a href=\"skeleton%20keys\"&gt;blacksmithing&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Seaforium%20Charge\"&gt;engineering items&lt;/a&gt; can be used to gain entry. As of &lt;a href=\"patch%203.3.0\"&gt;patch 3.3.0&lt;/a&gt;, entry can also be gained by using the &lt;a href=\"Dungeon%20Finder\"&gt;Dungeon Finder&lt;/a&gt;.\nJustice for the Sarkhoffs.\nOnce you've recovered your composure, &lt;a href=\"Eva%20Sarkhoff\"&gt;Eva Sarkhoff&lt;/a&gt; asks you to administer justice for the people of Caer Darrow that the Butcher slaughtered. You readily agree.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Scholomance\"&gt;Scholomance&lt;/a&gt; is right at hand. You wade through the blood of budding young necromancers, as well as the bones and ectoplasm of those their dark arts have revived. You track &lt;a href=\"Theolen%20Krastinov\"&gt;Theolen Krastinov&lt;/a&gt; to the very bowels of the school and put an end to him. It takes little more effort to find the remains of the Sarkhoffs and put those spirits to rest.\nYou return to clean air to find the Sarkhoffs are still present.\nKrastinov's master, &lt;a href=\"Kirtonos%20the%20Herald%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Kirtonos&lt;/a&gt;, still lurks, still lives, and must be destroyed lest this all happen again. Eva tells you that &lt;a href=\"Jandice%20Barov\"&gt;Jandice Barov&lt;/a&gt; supposedly tended the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20of%20Innocents\"&gt;Blood of Innocents&lt;/a&gt; that was given to Kirtonos, and that you would be able to use this to lure Kirtonos to where you can slay him.\nYou venture back into Scholomance and enter the basement. Legions of skeletons and bloated, animated corpses try to block you, but you press on. The ghost that is Jandice barov defends herself, splitting into myriad images, and other magics, but you (and your friends) overwhelm her.\nYou find &lt;a href=\"Krastinov%27s%20Bag%20of%20Horrors\"&gt;Krastinov's Bag of Horrors&lt;/a&gt; nearby, and bring it back out to Eva.\nEva points out a vial to you, containing the . With that blood, you can summon Kirtonos! Eva directs you to the porch (within Scholomance), and the brazier that is laid out there.\nYou venture back into the Scholomance, down to the porch. You pour out the blood of innocents (eep!) onto the brazier. As Eva foretold, Kirtonos is unable to resist the lure. You put an end to his evil!\nYou return yet again to Eva at the gates of Scholomance. Eva thanks you for ending this chapter of the horrors of Scholomance.\nMore remains to be done, though, and Eva provides you with some of the &lt;a href=\"Spectral%20Essence\"&gt;essence of the spirits of Caer Darrow&lt;/a&gt;, which will help you see and talk with other spirits nearby, who know of your deeds and would ask your aid.\nRewards.\nYou are given\nThe spectral essence is required to talk with and start the &lt;a href=\"Ras%20Frostwhisper%20quest%20chain\"&gt;Ras Frostwhisper quest chain&lt;/a&gt;.\nYou can choose one of"}

{"id": "188484", "revid": "39299307", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=188484", "title": "World of Warcraft RISK", "text": "World of Warcraft RISK is a styled map based on the features of World of Warcraft. Different games offer diverse experiences, but it all comes down to working on a system not dissimilar to that of the RISK board game.\nGames.\nThe over-arching goal of all games is to conquer every control point on the entire map. As of version 2.86, there are 252 Control Points. When a player (or a team) captures all of them, they win. Income is influenced solely by the capture of entire regions, as opposed to in the board game where a player would receive income based on number of control points and regions controlled. This offers more strategic game play, focusing more on controlling an area rather than just a chain of bases, and necessitates a more logical unit positioning. Allies may choose to split up land by region, rather than just by having an even number of bases.\nWoW RISK.\nStandard Risk. Players build various units related to the control point. For instance, &lt;a href=\"Footman\"&gt;footmen&lt;/a&gt; can be trained at &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;, because it is a city controlled by &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s. Players need to wisely choose units from local bases to overpower enemies.\nAlliance Vs. Horde.\nThe most heavily revised mode, as of 2.80, it is on its third complete revision. This is a 'mission' mode, where the races of the Alliance fight the races of the Horde. When a player captures a zone owned be another player, they receive only half the income they would normally, the other half going to the original owner. This way, if a player can escape, they can continue to aid their allies.\nRisk Revolution 3.1.\nIn Risk Revolution 3.1, it is the mode most like the board game RISK. Each player trains their units from 'Military Bases', which produce nine different units, split between range, melee, and tank classes. There are two healers among the nine possible units.\nWoW Risk Exodus.\nIn Exodus mode, the first five turns are spent \"solely\" on the Eastern Kingdoms. After this point, depending on how they fare, players may choose to \"stay\" or \"flee\". Upon fleeing, players will lose all their control points and gold, get a boat that can transform (permanently) into 5 Native Scouts and 3 Wagons at any port on Kalimdor or Northrend, and are given 16 gold. After 15 turns, Northrend and Kalimdor will become unblocked and ships will be available at ports, making the players who fled vulnerable.\nWoW Risk Race Mod.\nIn Race Mod, each player may choose a race (if they have not selected in 45 seconds, they will be randomly assigned one). There may be no duplicates. Each race has its own unit set, though some units may be used by more than one race. Each race has its own unique hero and capital, and its own strengths and weaknesses. As of version 2.81, there are 23 races: &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; &amp; &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; creeps, &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; &amp; &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;s , &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Horde\"&gt;Dark Horde&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s &amp; &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s &amp; &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; &amp; &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s &amp; &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sha%27tar\"&gt;Sha'tar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; &amp; &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;. Each race has a number of units to build, having unique stats based on that team's weaknesses or strength. Unlike normal Risk, in Race Mod, when a player captures a Control Point, it transforms into one of their bases. They can only train units from their selected race.\nWoW Risk Race Mod &amp; Exodus.\nSimply put, the rules of both Race Mode and Exodus apply.\nRiskTest.\nThis is a recently added test mode game. Not recommended for gameplay because it sets food to unlimited, gives all players 100000 gold, and creates devices to test units on the battlefield. This mode was created to allow users to test for unit imbalance.\nModes.\nVarious alliance settings that may be used for the game.\nFFA.\nFree-for-all. No players are allowed to ally.\nFree Alliance.\nPlayers may ally and unally freely via the Allies tab (F11).\nTeams of 2.\nEvery two players are on a team. (Players 1 &amp; 2, 3 &amp; 4, etc.)\nTeams of 3.\nEvery three players are on a team. (Players 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3, 4 &amp; 5 &amp; 6, etc.)\nFixed Alliance.\nPlayers are stuck to the alliances set via the team numbers set in the room before starting the game.\nDomination.\nIf a player loses his capital region to another player, they are forced into allying and serving their conqueror. FFA otherwise.\nOther Options.\nOptions are listed after descriptions; default options are bolded.\nMax Spawn Support.\nMax Spawn Support is the maximum number of turns you can stockpile the support units you get for owning an entire region. After the limit is reached, you will not receive more until some die.\nNo support, 5 Turns, 10 Turns, 15 Turns\nTurn Time.\nAt the end of each turn, players get income based on the zones they control and will also receive spawn support for controlling entire regions. This time indicates how long each turn lasts.\n60 Seconds, 90 Seconds, 45 Seconds\nFog of War.\nFog of War is the same Fog of War that appears in melee games if you explored a region, but no longer have units there. Night fog will only have Fog of War on at night.\nFog Off, Fog On, Night Fog\nBounty.\nWhen bounty is turned on, you will receive 1/4th of the value of each unit you kill. Ergo: kill four &lt;a href=\"Footman\"&gt;footmen&lt;/a&gt; (cost: 1 gold), get one gold, kill two &lt;a href=\"Abomination\"&gt;Abomination&lt;/a&gt;s (cost: 6 gold), get three gold.\nBounty Off, Bounty On\nMultiboard.\nThe Multiboard in the top right hand corner displays facts about the game. Depending on the setting, it will display more or less information about the players. Normal displays player names, incomes, kills, deaths, control point count, status (alive, dead, or left), turn time remaining, turns taken, the game mode, and notifies players when a region is completely captured by a player. Maximum displays all of that, and also all players' current gold. Minimum displays only player names, income, status, turn time remaining, and turns taken.\nMinimum Multiboard, Normal Multiboard, Maximum Multiboard\nShip Routes.\nShip Routes work like way gates and are stationed on various coasts to teleport units quickly from one land mass to another.\nShip Routes On, Ship Routes Off\nHeroes.\nHeroes are the most powerful units with abilities that cost much more than the average unit. All heroes cost 75 and 1 food. They have a passive aura and an active ability that used in the right way has a great impact on any battle. In the Race Mod, a player can only use his race's hero. Heroes can only be build at capital bases, which represents the location where that hero resides in World of Warcraft. Normally, with heroes on, you can only have one hero at a time, but Unlimited Heroes allows the player to have as many as they want (and can afford to train). \nHeroes On, Heroes Off, Unlimited Heroes\nFill Player Slots.\nAt the beginning of the game, the amount of bases is distributed equally according to the number of active players. With Fill Player Slots on, every active player only receives bases according to the formular amount of bases divided by 12. The leftover bases, that were assigned to nobody, become neutral hostile. This mod was designed for clan matches with few players and observers, that prefer to start out with low number of bases. Normally, to achieve this way of gameplay, the player slots were filled up with an inactive ai, but this would not allow any observers to join the game. \nActive Players Only, Fill Player Slots\nTower Evolution.\nEach base is equipped with a tower to supplement its defensive power. Normally, they stay at the same weak state all game. Activating tower evolution will upgrade all towers every 5 turns.\nNo Tower Evolution, Evolving Towers\nAllrandom.\nIn Race or Alliance vs Horde, every player has to chose a race as he wishes. Turning Allrandom on, the races are assigned randomly for every player.\nAllrandom Off, Allrandom On\nGameplay.\nOnce the mode has been selected (and races chosen, if in Race Mod or Alliance vs Horde), the game begins. The game itself revolves around the capture of Control Points and regions, and unit strength Vs. cost. This section will analyze zone size vs. income, unit support provided, region adjacency, as well as unit cost vs. efficiency, strengths and weaknesses, and placement. The income of each region is equal to the number of control points.\nRegions.\nRegions are sorted here by number of control points, and when equal, by alphabetic order. Note that while all zone titles link to their zone page, all adjacent region links will take you to that region's description on this page.\n&lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac Mountains&lt;/a&gt;.\nCoordinates: \nControl Points: 2\nSupport: &lt;a href=\"Ogre%20Magi\"&gt;Ogre Magi&lt;/a&gt;\nAdjacent Regions: &lt;a href=\"WoW%20Risk%23Western%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Western Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"WoW%20Risk%23Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"WoW%20Risk%23Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt;\nSea Access: No\nCapital: None\nRaces: &lt;a href=\"Syndicate\"&gt;Syndicate&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ogre\"&gt;Ogre&lt;/a&gt;s\nAnalysis: Alterac is a central zone. It has bridge advantage against Western Plaguelands and Silverpine Forest. Ogre magi are a two gold caster unit. Because it is an area \"relatively\" far from a capital, Alterac Mountains isn't often captured early, but rather picked up by someone who already has captured a few zones. It is an early choice for players who want to capture small areas for easy money.\n&lt;a href=\"Burning%20Steppes\"&gt;Burning Steppes&lt;/a&gt;.\nControl Points: 2\nSupport: &lt;a href=\"Ogre%20Magi\"&gt;Ogre Magi&lt;/a&gt;\nAdjacent Regions: &lt;a href=\"WoW%20Risk%23Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"WoW%20Risk%23Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt;\nSea Access: No\nCapital: None\nRaces: &lt;a href=\"Fel%20orc\"&gt;Fel orc&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Ogre\"&gt;Ogre&lt;/a&gt;s\nAnalysis: Burning Steppes is often picked up by players in central &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; rather quickly. It's right next to &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, the capital of both the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock\"&gt;Blackrock&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s. It provides Ogre Magi, which are two gold caster units.\n&lt;a href=\"Duskwood\"&gt;Duskwood&lt;/a&gt;.\nControl Points: 2\nSupport: &lt;a href=\"Captain\"&gt;Captain&lt;/a&gt;\nAdjacent Regions: &lt;a href=\"WoW%20Risk%23Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"WoW%20Risk%23Elwynn%20Forest\"&gt;Elwynn Forest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"WoW%20Risk%23Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"WoW%20Risk%23Swamp%20of%20Sorrows\"&gt;Swamp of Sorrows&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"WoW%20Risk%23Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt;\nSea Access: No\nCapital: None\nRaces: &lt;a href=\"Human\"&gt;Human&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Undead\"&gt;Undead&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Worgen\"&gt;Worgen&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;)\nAnalysis: Duskwood is a 'transition' zone. It holds bridge advantages over Westfall, Elwynn Forest, and Redridge Mountains. Its high number of adjacent zones makes it a common battleground for players starting in &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28continent%29\"&gt;southern Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;. Your support unit is the captain, which is a two gold melee unit with defend. You should utilize this skill, because three adjacent zones provide ranged units, and two provide magic.\n&lt;a href=\"Moonglade\"&gt;Moonglade&lt;/a&gt;.\nControl Points: 2\nSupport: Skilled &lt;a href=\"Archer\"&gt;Archer&lt;/a&gt;\nAdjacent Regions: &lt;a href=\"WoW%20Risk%23Felwood\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"WoW%20Risk%23Winterspring\"&gt;Winterspring&lt;/a&gt;\nSea Access: No\nCapital: None\nRaces: &lt;a href=\"Night%20Elf\"&gt;Night Elf&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tauren\"&gt;Tauren&lt;/a&gt;\nAnalysis: Moonglade, like Felwood and Winterspring, are a bit out of the way. Most players in &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Kalimdor\"&gt;Northern Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; will focus on the regions from the islands of &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bloodmyst%20Isle\"&gt;Bloodmyst Isle&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Azuremyst%20Isle\"&gt;Azuremyst Isle&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt;. Skilled Archers are two gold ranged units with critical strike. It's not a common first choice, except by players just grabbing it for the extra gold at the beginning.\n&lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Isle of Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt;.\nControl Points: 2\nSupport: &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;Blood elf&lt;/a&gt; Soldier\nAdjacent Regions: &lt;a href=\"WoW%20Risk%23Eversong%20Woods\"&gt;Eversong Woods&lt;/a&gt;\nSea Access: No\nCapital: &lt;a href=\"Sunwell%20Plateau\"&gt;Sunwell Plateau&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;\nRaces: &lt;a href=\"Demon\"&gt;Demon&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;Blood elves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Naga\"&gt;Naga&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wretched\"&gt;Wretched&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Draenei\"&gt;Draenei&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Naaru\"&gt;Naaru&lt;/a&gt;\nAnalysis: The Isle of Quel'danas is a very common first zone choice. It only has two control points, so it is relatively easy to capture. The extra gold bonus will provide an advantage when expanding to its only adjacent region, Eversong Forest, or when expanding elsewhere (if only captured for the gold bonus). Its capital of Sunwell Plateau makes it a common choice for the Burning Legion, despite the race being more end-game oriented. Blood Elf Soldiers are two gold units melee units.\n&lt;a href=\"Searing%20Gorge\"&gt;Searing Gorge&lt;/a&gt;.\nControl Points: 2\nSupport: &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarf&lt;/a&gt;\nAdjacent Regions: &lt;a href=\"WoW%20Risk%23Badlands\"&gt;Badlands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"WoW%20Risk%23Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt;\nSea Access: No\nCapital: None\nRaces: &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt;\nAnalysis: Searing Gorge is a poor choice of zone. Its spawns are nothing special, and it suffers from a height disadvantage to Blackrock Mountain, and partially to the Badlands. It even has a height disadvantage to itself should you lose &lt;a href=\"Thorium%20Point\"&gt;Thorium Point&lt;/a&gt;. Could be taken in a land grab, usually just taken when conquering all the regions in &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;. Dark Iron dwarves are two gold melee units. If trying to stop a land-push (on either side), \"do not try to hold out here\". Your casters and ranged units will be almost useless defending either side. Just fall back to your next area.\n&lt;a href=\"Zul%27drak\"&gt;Zul'drak&lt;/a&gt;.\nControl Points: 2\nSupport: &lt;a href=\"Ice%20troll\"&gt;Ice Troll&lt;/a&gt; Berserker\nAdjacent Regions: &lt;a href=\"WoW%20Risk%23Grizzly%20Hills\"&gt;Grizzly Hills&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"WoW%20Risk%23Storm%20Peaks\"&gt;Storm Peaks&lt;/a&gt;\nSea Access: No\nCapital: None\nRaces: &lt;a href=\"Troll\"&gt;Troll&lt;/a&gt;\nAnalysis: Zul'drak is an uncommon first choice, but a surprisingly good one. It's not near any capitals, the closest being two zones away (Dalaran or Scourge), and it doesn't offer much diversity, but the Troll unit selection is diverse and will cover any needs, and the unit provided for support is a four gold ranged unit!\n&lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands\"&gt;Arathi Highlands&lt;/a&gt;.\nControl Points: 3\nSupport: &lt;a href=\"Human\"&gt;Human&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Archer\"&gt;Archer&lt;/a&gt;\nAdjacent Regions: &lt;a href=\"WoW%20Risk%23Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"WoW%20Risk%23Wetlands\"&gt;Wetlands&lt;/a&gt;\nSea Access: No\nCapital: None\nRaces: &lt;a href=\"Syndicate\"&gt;Syndicate&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Human\"&gt;Human&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;s\nAnalysis: Arathi Highlands is rarely captured early on. The closest capital's race is Kul Tiras, and the chain of islands to which it belongs is isolated. Arathi Highlands does however have a bridge advantage against the Wetlands, and a funnel in the form of a wall against the Hillsbrad Foothils. While the Foothills are adjacent, players usually capture the Hinterlands and Arathi Highlands together, because they are closer together, whereas Hillsbrad is more open. The support unit, Human Archer, is a two gold ranged unit that is very useful for this region, because all entrances are funnels for troops. When defending, mass range units with a line of melee units to hold the entrances.\n&lt;a href=\"Azjol%27Nerub\"&gt;Azjol'Nerub&lt;/a&gt;.\nControl Points: 3\nSupport: &lt;a href=\"Crypt%20Fiend\"&gt;Crypt Fiend&lt;/a&gt;\nAdjacent Regions: &lt;a href=\"WoW%20Risk%23Icecrown%20Glacier\"&gt;Icecrown Glacier&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"WoW%20Risk%23Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt;\nSea Access: No\nCapital: None\nRaces: &lt;a href=\"Nerubian\"&gt;Nerubian&lt;/a&gt;s &amp; &lt;a href=\"Faceless%20One\"&gt;Faceless One&lt;/a&gt;s (&lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s), &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;Dwarves&lt;/a&gt;\nAnalysis: Azjol'Nerub should only be picked up on account of it being next to two capitals.

Such a character should be able to complete at least 600 quests, especially if they travel to all low-level areas controlled by their faction and complete their quest chains.\nFor the Alliance, that would include &lt;a href=\"Elwynn%20Forest\"&gt;Elwynn Forest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Morogh\"&gt;Dun Morogh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Loch%20Modan\"&gt;Loch Modan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Azuremyst%20Isle\"&gt;Azuremyst Isle&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Bloodmyst%20Isle\"&gt;Bloodmyst Isle&lt;/a&gt;.\nFor the Horde - &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Barrens\"&gt;Northern Barrens&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eversong%20Woods\"&gt;Eversong Woods&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ghostlands\"&gt;Ghostlands&lt;/a&gt;.\nA persistent player with good gear can also complete some of the quests in the 20-25 level areas such as &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wetlands\"&gt;Wetlands&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Duskwood\"&gt;Duskwood&lt;/a&gt;.\nA very brave and stubborn player might as well visit higher level areas, though the only thing they could possibly do there is exploration and sightseeing. Exploration usually entails a high number of deaths, yet successful revelation of the entire map will award an Achievement.\nEnemy low-level areas can also be explored, as long as players stay away from the roads (to avoid any Alliance/Horde patrols) and popular player gathering areas (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Goldshire\"&gt;Goldshire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Razor%20Hill\"&gt;Razor Hill&lt;/a&gt;, etc.). Revealing an enemy race's starting zone will most times require 1 or 2 deaths (a level 20 character cannot survive against Elite guards for more than 1 second), though some starting zones has breaches from where to pass.\nStarter Edition players can do cooking and fishing &lt;a href=\"daily%20quests\"&gt;daily quests&lt;/a&gt; at capital cities without restrictions. This is a good way to earn some achievements and increase reputation with other factions in order to be able to buy their racial mounts at Exalted.\nUse for active players.\nYou can have an inactive World of Warcraft account and have an active starter edition account. Some players who don't want to or cannot afford to pay for \"World of Warcraft\" for whatever &lt;a href=\"Real%20Life\"&gt;Real Life&lt;/a&gt; reasons will keep these accounts to play a little when the bug hits them, or see how the game is going.\nThese accounts are also helpful for players with young children who want to play the game. The account is free, so the parent does not have to pay an extra fee per month. The children cannot be invited to a guild, etc. by people who spam level-one characters with guild invites. The children can still group with their parents and do quests just like in a normal party. Remember though that \"World of Warcraft\" is a 14+ game so always supervise your young children when they are playing."}

The announcement came a week after the closed beta started for the digital card game \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\", a spiritual successor to the TCG which features many of the same characters, abilities and artwork.\nUnlike most TCGs, the game has a larger focus on multiplayer, having both raids and battlegrounds.\nGame details.\nEach player uses a hero card and a deck consisting of allies and other supporting cards. In booster and starter packs, gamers can find cards representing weapons, abilities, armor, items and quests. Some booster packs also contain legendary rares, or \"loot cards\" (i.e. special versions of normal cards) which contain a scratch-off code. This code can then be redeemed in the online game for a virtual prize. The prizes include special &lt;a href=\"tabard\"&gt;tabard&lt;/a&gt;s, gimmick items, &lt;a href=\"Companion\"&gt;non-combat pets&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"mount\"&gt;mount&lt;/a&gt;s.\nDuring play, players start with a single hero, and then play additional cards to augment the hero's powers or add additional members to his or her party. As in games such as \"\", the goal is to reduce the remaining health of the opponent to zero. Unlike \"Magic\", combat attacks are always directed at individual heroes or allies, rather than simply declaring an attack with a number of creatures. Furthermore, damage done to characters accumulates between turns, making combat more expensive for both the attacker and defender.\nRaid Decks.\nIn addition to standard 2-player game play, the game also features \"Raid Decks\", representing struggles involving large numbers of players against epic foes. These need 1 \"Raid Master\" and 3 to 5 other players. The Raid Master controls all monsters and foes, while the other players control the characters participating in the raid. Players who are victorious may be able to win certain \"loot\" cards from the \"treasure pack\" that came with the deck. A \"treasure pack\" contains holofoils, and sometimes contains a random insertion of a \"loot\" card. Upper Deck Entertainment also made treasure packs available from their UDE points store, although the cards in these packs are not holofoil.\nAs of 2010, five Raid Decks have been released, each based on a location in the \"WoW\" MMORPG: Onyxia's Lair, Molten Core, Magtheridon's Lair, The Black Temple, and Naxxramas. The next raid to be released was Assault on Icecrown Citadel.\nCard types.\nThe following types of cards are featured in the game:\nList of sets.\nStandard sets.\nAzeroth Block\nBurning Crusade Block\nDrums of War Block\nScourgewar Block\nWorldbreaker Block\nAftermath Block\nTimewalkers Block\nWorld of Warcraft reward items.\nLoot cards.\nThe TCG offered \"legendary\" loot cards. These cards are special versions of the normal card, however, they have a scratch off bar which contains a long hexadecimal code. These cards are entered on the Blizzard web site which converts them to a similar code that is specific to the realm of your choice. You then use the code with &lt;a href=\"Landro%20Longshot\"&gt;Landro Longshot&lt;/a&gt;, a vendor in &lt;a href=\"Booty%20Bay\"&gt;Booty Bay&lt;/a&gt;, to obtain the item. The codes are single-use, so you get one item on one character on one server for each loot card code you get. You do not get the item on all your characters, unlike the collector's edition pets. If you are having trouble with your loot cards, check out the &lt;a href=\"How%20to%20redeem%20a%20loot%20card\"&gt;loot card&lt;/a&gt; walk-through.\nThese loot cards are divided into three categories:\nUDE Points.\nOne of the original \"pulls\" of the WoW TCG was that each booster pack had a guaranteed UDE points card, which featured 100 UDE points on it. These cards could be turned in at the Upper Deck website, and be used to buy various items. After a while, the points cards became material cards, while still featuring points. The UDE points program did not transfer with the TCG when it moved to Cryptozoic, so material cards released after &lt;a href=\"Wrathgate%20%28TCG%29\"&gt;Wrathgate&lt;/a&gt; no longer have UDE points on them.\nRules and errata.\nThe current version of rules is 7.4 (updated July 23, 2013).\nOfficial Card Reference (updated July 23, 2013):\nCanonicity.\nWhile the artwork of some cards was overseen and sometimes edited with Blizzard's Creative Development department input, with &lt;a href=\"Chris%20Metzen\"&gt;Chris Metzen&lt;/a&gt; suggesting some of the cards and being particularly vigilant about the way named heroes were handled, Blizzard declared that the Trading Card Game is not considered canon, and neither are its cards descriptions. Moreover, contrary to \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\", \"there is no tie-in story for the TCG and it is not a mini-game within \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\"\"."}

Low-level characters beware!\nThis is where quest chains get long for the Alliance.

Players can either follow the Morbent Fel questline to &lt;a href=\"Wetlands%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Wetlands&lt;/a&gt;, and from there go to either &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Arathi Highlands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt; (which another breadcrumb from Duskwood leads to) or across the sea to &lt;a href=\"Dustwallow%20Marsh%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Dustwallow Marsh&lt;/a&gt;. Or the player can disregard the breadcrumbs and head south to &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Wetlands%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Wetlands&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe marshlands located on the edge of Khaz Modan and Lordaeron.

In addition, parts of Duskwood's Morbent Fel quest chain happen here, while The Missing Diplomat quest chain runs through this zone.\nThere is a fork in the road for the Alliance characters here. The simple breadcrumbs lead to &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Arathi Highlands&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt;, while The Missing Diplomat chain runs through this zone eventually leading to &lt;a href=\"Dustwallow%20Marsh%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Dustwallow Marsh&lt;/a&gt; across the ocean.\n&lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Alterac Mountains&lt;/a&gt;.\nA pair of regions in the southern Lordaeron. Hillsbrad Foothills serve as both a tertiary undead zone and a higher-level zone for both factions. Alterac Mountains has almost no quests of its own, being mostly connected to the mentioned higher-level storyline. The main antagonists here are the other faction, &lt;a href=\"Crushridge\"&gt;Crushridge&lt;/a&gt; ogres, and the &lt;a href=\"Syndicate\"&gt;Syndicate&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe entrance to the battleground &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Valley\"&gt;Alterac Valley&lt;/a&gt; is located in the Alterac Mountains.\nThe most notable quest chains in the lower level parts involve &lt;a href=\"Elixir%20of%20Agony\"&gt;creating a chemical capable of killing through sheer pain&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Battle%20for%20Hillsbrad%20%28quest%29\"&gt;conquering the town of Hillsbrad for the Horde&lt;/a&gt;.

Horde players also get a breadcrumb that eventually leads them to &lt;a href=\"Desolace%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Desolace&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Arathi Highlands&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe mountainous region in southern Lordaeron.

The famous &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20Arena\"&gt;Gurubashi Arena&lt;/a&gt; is also located in this zone.\nThere are too many notable quest chains to count. The most notable ones involve &lt;a href=\"Welcome%20to%20the%20Jungle\"&gt;going on a safari&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Green%20Hills%20of%20Stranglethorn%20%28old%29\"&gt;collecting a missing manuscript page by page&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Second%20Rebellion\"&gt;dealing with an insane Alliance officer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hunt%20for%20Yenniku%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;saving the life of Vol'jin's son&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the long, long journey that is Stranglethorn Vale, the player is directed towards &lt;a href=\"Tanaris%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt; on the southern edge of Kalimdor, &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt; in northern Eastern Kingdoms or &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20of%20Sorrows%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Swamp of Sorrows&lt;/a&gt; to the north-east.\n&lt;a href=\"Swamp%20of%20Sorrows%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Swamp of Sorrows&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe ground zero of the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;. A swamp in the southern part of Eastern Kingdoms and a burned-out wasteland to the south of it. The main enemies to be fought in the Swamp of Sorrows are &lt;a href=\"Atal%27ai%20tribe\"&gt;Atal'ai tribe&lt;/a&gt; trolls. Meanwhile, the main opponents in the Blasted Lands are demons.\nThe world boss &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Kazzak%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Lord Kazzak&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; are located in the Blasted Lands.\nThe zones are not exactly rich with quests, especially the Blasted Lands. The notable quest chains involve &lt;a href=\"Encroaching%20Wildlife\"&gt;helping collect scattered supplies&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"In%20Search%20of%20The%20Temple\"&gt;investigating a strange temple&lt;/a&gt; for the Alliance, and &lt;a href=\"Lack%20of%20Surplus\"&gt;dealing with murlocs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pool%20of%20Tears%20%28quest%29\"&gt;investigating a strange temple&lt;/a&gt; for the Horde. In addition, there is a high-level quest chain involving &lt;a href=\"The%20Stones%20That%20Bind%20Us\"&gt;fallen heroes, demon hunters, and ancient demons&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter finishing up in those zones, the player is directed to the opposite edge of the continent, to &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Hinterlads&lt;/a&gt;. The Horde also gets a breadcrumb to &lt;a href=\"Badlands%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Badlands&lt;/a&gt; early on, and later in the Rakh'likh questline the player is directed to &lt;a href=\"Azshara%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Badlands%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Badlands&lt;/a&gt;.\nA place which name truly first. Despite being practically in the heart of Alliance territory, this is a zone with one of the most crucial Horde outposts, while Alliance presence is nonexistent to the point of not even having a flight path. The main opponents here are &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe dungeon &lt;a href=\"Uldaman\"&gt;Uldaman&lt;/a&gt; is located in this zone.\nThe most notable quest chains in this zone include &lt;a href=\"A%20Sign%20of%20Hope\"&gt;attempting to rescue a dwarf&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Badlands%20Reagent%20Run\"&gt;going on a reagent run&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Solution%20to%20Doom\"&gt;finding a solution to doom&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter finishing here, the player is directed west, to &lt;a href=\"Searing%20Gorge%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Searing Gorge&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Hinterlands%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt;.\nA hilly, forested area in eastern Lordaeron, primarily inhabited by Wildhammer dwarves and forest trolls. The main enemies here are the aforementioned forest trolls, and Horde fights against the Wildhammer dwarves and &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Danil%20Lodge\"&gt;Quel'Danil Lodge&lt;/a&gt; as well.\nOne of the &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20of%20Nightmare%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Dragons of Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; can appear from the dream portal in the north-eastern portion of the zone.\nThe most notable quest chains for Alliance involve &lt;a href=\"To%20The%20Hinterlands\"&gt;continuing the investigation of a mysterious temple&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Witherbark%20Cages\"&gt;saving the offspring of one of the most venerable gryphons&lt;/a&gt;. For the Horde, the most notable quest chains involve &lt;a href=\"Ripple%20Recovery\"&gt;recovering ripple for an orc&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Venom%20Bottles\"&gt;investigating an unusually potent venom&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter finishing up the player is directed back to the &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20of%20Sorrows%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Swamp of Sorrows&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt;, just in time for a quest line to open up to send them to &lt;a href=\"Azshara%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt;. Alternatively, the player can head to the capital city to pick up a breadcrumb to the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Plaguelands%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Western Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Searing%20Gorge%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Searing Gorge&lt;/a&gt;.\nA relatively small zone in southern Khaz Modan. Major inhabitants here are &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt;, both friendly and hostile.\nThe Dungeons &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Depths\"&gt;Blackrock Depths&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Lower Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt; and raid instances &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Blackrock%20Spire%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Upper Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Core\"&gt;Molten Core&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blackwing%20Lair\"&gt;Blackwing Lair&lt;/a&gt; are located in the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt; to the south.\nThe most notable quest chains include &lt;a href=\"Suntara%20Stones\"&gt;avenging a dwarf the player failed to save&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Retribution\"&gt;helping a man avenge his father&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter completing the quests here, the player is directed south, through the Blackrock Mountain to the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Steppes%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Burning Steppes&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Burning%20Steppes%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Burning Steppes&lt;/a&gt;.\nAn ash-covered zone in northern Azeroth. Between &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock clan&lt;/a&gt; orcs, &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt;, and black dragons, this place is about as unfriendly as it gets.\nThe Dungeons &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Depths\"&gt;Blackrock Depths&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Lower Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt; and raid instances &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Blackrock%20Spire%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Upper Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Core\"&gt;Molten Core&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Blackwing%20Lair\"&gt;Blackwing Lair&lt;/a&gt; are located in the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt; to the north.\nThe most notable quest chains include &lt;a href=\"The%20Smoldering%20Ruins%20of%20Thaurissan\"&gt;investigating the old Dark Iron capital city and infiltrating their current one&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Broodling%20Essence\"&gt;dealing in dragon eggs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dragonkin%20Menace\"&gt;revealing the \"true\" threat to Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter finishing here, the player is directed towards &lt;a href=\"Winterspring%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Winterspring&lt;/a&gt; and, later, to the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Eastern Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Western%20Plaguelands%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Western Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;.\nAn area in northern Lordaeron. Not as heavily affected by the Scourge plague, this area still has a chance to recover. The main enemies here are members of &lt;a href=\"The%20Scourge\"&gt;The Scourge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe dungeon &lt;a href=\"Scholomance%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Scholomance&lt;/a&gt; is located in this zone.\nThe most notable quest chains involve &lt;a href=\"Scholomance%20%28quest%29\"&gt;creating a key to Scholomance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Scourge%20Cauldrons\"&gt;neutralizing the plague-spewing cauldrons of the Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Little%20Pamela\"&gt;helping to right a tremendous wrong&lt;/a&gt;.\nRoughly halfway through questing the player will receive a breadcrumb towards the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Eastern Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;. From that point onward, the two zones are roughly matched in terms of questing.\n&lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Eastern Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;.\nA heavily plagued area in north-eastern Lordaeron. Some areas are borderline unrecognizable. The main enemies here are members of &lt;a href=\"The%20Scourge\"&gt;The Scourge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe dungeon &lt;a href=\"Stratholme%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt; and the raid instance &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt; are located in this zone.\nThe most notable quest chains involve &lt;a href=\"Redemption%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;inspiring an old paladin to get out of his funk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Little%20Pamela\"&gt;helping to right a tremendous wrong&lt;/a&gt;, and either &lt;a href=\"The%20Champion%20of%20the%20Banshee%20Queen\"&gt;helping&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"The%20First%20and%20the%20Last\"&gt;killing&lt;/a&gt; a certain Ranger-Lord.\nThis is one of the end-of-leveling zones, as such no follow-ups are necessary.\nKalimdor.\nThe continent to the west, and the one where &lt;a href=\"Orc%20%28playable%29\"&gt;orcs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Troll%20%28playable%29\"&gt;trolls&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tauren%20%28playable%29\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf%20%28playable%29\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; characters begin their journey.\n&lt;a href=\"Durotar%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;.\nOrc and troll characters take their first steps in this rough land. Between &lt;a href=\"Quilboar\"&gt;quillboar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Harpy\"&gt;harpies&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Centaur\"&gt;centaurs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; remnants, &lt;a href=\"Zalazane\"&gt;Zalazane&lt;/a&gt;'s followers and &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Blade%20clan\"&gt;Burning Blade&lt;/a&gt; orcs, there is plenty of enemies to choose from.\nThis zone doesn't have much in terms of quest chains, most quests being unconnected to each other. The only notable chain involves &lt;a href=\"Vile%20Familiars\"&gt;fighting the demon-worshipping Burning Blade orcs&lt;/a&gt;, and is notably lengthy for an early quest chain.\nAfter finishing up, the player is sent onwards to &lt;a href=\"Barrens%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;The Barrens&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Mulgore%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt;.\nTauren characters start their journey in these lush greenlands. The main antagonists here are the opportunistic &lt;a href=\"Venture%20Company\"&gt;Venture Company&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe most notable quest chains involve &lt;a href=\"A%20Humble%20Task\"&gt;following the tauren rites to truly earn one's place in Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Poison%20Water%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;investigating the poisoning of tauren water supply&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"The%20Ravaged%20Caravan%20%28Horde%29%20%281%29\"&gt;clashing with the Venture Co. goons&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce the player's business in Mulgore is done, they go onward towards The Barrens.\n&lt;a href=\"Teldrassil%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe massive tree north of Kalimdor serves as a starting point for night elf characters. The major enemies fought here are corrupted &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe notable quest chains involve &lt;a href=\"Webwood%20Venom\"&gt;gathering Moonwell water and learning the history of Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Denalan%27s%20Earth\"&gt;helping a herbalist with his work&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"A%20Troubling%20Breeze\"&gt;fighting the corrupted furbolg&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter concluding the questing in Teldrassil, the player is directed towards &lt;a href=\"Darkshore%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Barrens%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;The Barrens&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe massive savanna, located right in the middle of Kalimdor. Saying it is frequently visited is undersaying it. The Barrens serve as a secondary area for orcs, trolls, and tauren characters.\nThe dungeons &lt;a href=\"Wailing%20Caverns\"&gt;Wailing Caverns&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Razorfen%20Kraul%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Razorfen Kraul&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Razorfen%20Downs%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Razorfen Downs&lt;/a&gt; are located in this zone. In addition, the Horde entrance to &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Gulch\"&gt;Warsong Gulch&lt;/a&gt; battleground is located in the northern part.\nFittingly for the size of the zone, there is a large number of quests, both as quest chains, and one-offs. The most notable chains include &lt;a href=\"Plainstrider%20Menace%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;hunting an increasingly dangerous game&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Forgotten%20Pools%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;investigating nature irregularities and eventually attacking said irregularities' source&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Samophlange%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;being baffled by goblin engineering&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Barrens have a large number of zones one can go to after finishing. To the west, &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. To the north, &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;. To the south, &lt;a href=\"Thousand%20Needles%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Thousand Needles&lt;/a&gt;. To the west across the sea, both &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt;. The choice is in one's own hands.\n&lt;a href=\"Darkshore%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe darkened forest located on the northeastern shore of Kalimdor. Serves as a secondary zone for night elf characters.\nThe most notable quest chains involve &lt;a href=\"Buzzbox%20827%20%28quest%29\"&gt;fixing broken communication devices&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cave%20Mushrooms\"&gt;encountering the Twilight's Hammer for the first time&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Absent%20Minded%20Prospector\"&gt;assisting in uncovering the secrets of the titans&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Tower%20of%20Althalaxx\"&gt;dealing with the mysterious tower and the cult surrounding it&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter completing the quests here, the player is directed towards &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt;.\nA mountain range in central Kalimdor, with narrow paths through it. Likely the first neutral zone Horde characters that start on Kalimdor will encounter. The main opponents here are the &lt;a href=\"Venture%20Company\"&gt;Venture Company&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Windshear%20Crag\"&gt;Windshear Crag&lt;/a&gt; and harpies elsewhere.\nThe most notable quest chains involve fighting Venture Co. goons, whether it's from &lt;a href=\"On%20Guard%20in%20Stonetalon\"&gt;the Alliance's perspective&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20Invaders\"&gt;the Horde's&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Ziz%20Fizziks%20%28quest%29\"&gt;rival goblins'&lt;/a&gt;. \nAlliance players are directed towards &lt;a href=\"Thalanaar\"&gt;Thalanaar&lt;/a&gt; afterward, which can mean two zones - either south-west, through &lt;a href=\"Desolace%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Desolace&lt;/a&gt; or through the Barrens, passing through &lt;a href=\"Thousand%20Needles%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Thousand Needles&lt;/a&gt; on the way. Horde characters are directed either north to &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt; or south-east to &lt;a href=\"Thousand%20Needles%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Thousand Needles&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Ashenvale%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;.\nA mystical forest in northern Kalimdor. Mostly Alliance-controlled, but with a sizeable Horde presence. This is one of the first areas where the main antagonist of the zone is another faction, with &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Zoram%20Strand\"&gt;Zoram Strand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thistlefur%20tribe\"&gt;Thistlefur tribe&lt;/a&gt; furbolgs and &lt;a href=\"satyr\"&gt;satyr&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Xavian\"&gt;Xavian&lt;/a&gt; acting as secondary antagonists.\nThe dungeon &lt;a href=\"Blackfathom%20Deeps%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Blackfathom Deeps&lt;/a&gt; and Alliance entrance of &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Gulch\"&gt;Warsong Gulch&lt;/a&gt; battleground are both located in this zone. In addition, one of the &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20of%20Nightmare%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Dragons of Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; can appear in the eastern part of the zone.\nAlliance has several notable quest chains in this zone, involving &lt;a href=\"The%20Tower%20of%20Althalaxx%20%283%29\"&gt;continued investigation of the mystery of the tower on Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bathran%27s%20Hair%20%28original%29\"&gt;asssiting a druid to find a cure for a sick child&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Raene%27s%20Cleansing\"&gt;helping another night elf with the Thistlefur problem&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Howling%20Vale\"&gt;investigating the mystery of the Scythe of Elune&lt;/a&gt;. The only notable Horde quest chain involves &lt;a href=\"The%20Ashenvale%20Hunt%20%28Ashenvale%29\"&gt;hunting rare and powerful beasts&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlliance have two ways to go from here - to the south to &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt; or, following the trail of &lt;a href=\"Velinde%20Starsong\"&gt;Velinde Starsong&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;a href=\"Duskwood%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Duskwood&lt;/a&gt; passing through &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt; on the way. For the Horde, the zone is a dead end with no breadcrumbs leading from it - other nearby zones in leveling range are &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thousand%20Needles%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Thousand Needles&lt;/a&gt; or, for higher leveled characters, &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Desolace%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Desolace&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dustwallow%20Marsh%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Dustwallow Marsh&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Thousand%20Needles%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Thousand Needles&lt;/a&gt;.\nA canyon dotted with a large number of spires - the eponymous needles. At its eastern end are massive salt flats, that are being used as a race track. The main opponents here are &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Harpy\"&gt;harpies&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Grimtotem%20tribe\"&gt;Grimtotem tribe&lt;/a&gt; tauren.\nThis area is mostly Horde-controlled, with roughly half the quests being Horde-only. Most notable quest chains involve &lt;a href=\"Alien%20Egg%20%28quest%29\"&gt;accidentally hatching and subsequently dealing with a powerful wind serpent&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Test%20of%20Faith%20%28quest%29\"&gt;learning about the history of the Horde, and being tested about it&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rocket%20Car%20Parts\"&gt;doing errands for a shifty dwarf&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20Sponsorship\"&gt;helping a racing team with an unexpected hurdle&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter finishing up in Thousand Needles, the player is directed to &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Searing%20Gorge%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Searing Gorge&lt;/a&gt; across the sea, or &lt;a href=\"Tanaris%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt; to the south.\n&lt;a href=\"Dustwallow%20Marsh%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Dustwallow Marsh&lt;/a&gt;.\nAn unfriendly marsh in central Kalimdor. The town on &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore Isle&lt;/a&gt; serves as the biggest Alliance town on Kalimdor outside of Darnassus. The main enemies here are &lt;a href=\"Grimtotem%20tribe\"&gt;Grimtotem tribe&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"black%20dragon\"&gt;black dragon&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Onyxia&lt;/a&gt;'s brood, and for Alliance only, local deserters.\nThe raid instance &lt;a href=\"Onyxia%27s%20Lair%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Onyxia's Lair&lt;/a&gt; is located in this zone.\nThe most notable quest chains in this zone include &lt;a href=\"The%20Missing%20Diplomat%20%2813%29\"&gt;searching for a disappeared high-ranking diplomat&lt;/a&gt; for the Alliance, &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20Report\"&gt;dealing with a troll way to get information&lt;/a&gt; for the Horde and &lt;a href=\"Shady%20Rest%20Inn%20quest%20chain\"&gt;investigating a destroyed inn&lt;/a&gt; for both factions. Ultimately this zone leaves more questions than answers. It would be years before those questions were &lt;a href=\"Patch%202.3.0%23Dustwallow%20Marsh\"&gt;answered&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere aren't many breadcrumbs here. Horde gets one to &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt; and Alliance just doesn't have any - for them, the best way to proceed is to either head west-south-east to &lt;a href=\"Tanaris%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt;, or head back across the sea to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; to pick up breadcrumbs to the &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20of%20Sorrows%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Swamp of Sorrows&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Desolace%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Desolace&lt;/a&gt;.\nA barren land on the western shore of central Kalimdor. Mostly inhabited by the &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt;, Desolace truly lives up to its name. The major enemies here are &lt;a href=\"Kolkar%20clan\"&gt;Kolkar clan&lt;/a&gt; centaur, the naga, and the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Blade%20clan\"&gt;Burning Blade clan&lt;/a&gt; orcs.\nThe dungeon &lt;a href=\"Maraudon\"&gt;Maraudon&lt;/a&gt; is located in this zone.\nDesolace is somewhat unique in that it has two neutral quest chains that are mutually exclusive, involving allying with &lt;a href=\"Raid%20on%20the%20Kolkar\"&gt;Gelkis&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Assault%20on%20the%20Kolkar\"&gt;Magram centaur clans&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, Alliance's notable quest chains involve &lt;a href=\"Reclaimers%27%20Business%20in%20Desolace\"&gt;doing business with the Reclaimers Inc. in two different ways&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vahlarriel%27s%20Search\"&gt;searching for a pair of missing Night Elf nobles&lt;/a&gt;, while the Horde gets quest chains to fight against &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Relations\"&gt;Burning Blade orcs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Corrupter\"&gt;demons&lt;/a&gt;.\nDesolace doesn't really have any breadcrumbs to other zones. There is a Horde-only breadcrumb to &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt; early on, &lt;a href=\"Feralas%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt; to the south is a natural progression from Desolace, while &lt;a href=\"Tanaris%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt; far to the south-east can be used as an alternative.\n&lt;a href=\"Tanaris%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt;.\nA huge desert in the southern part of Kalimdor. The presence of &lt;a href=\"Steamwheedle%20Cartel\"&gt;Steamwheedle Cartel&lt;/a&gt; capital &lt;a href=\"Gadgetzan\"&gt;Gadgetzan&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt; makes it one of the most interesting areas to visit. The main enemies here are the &lt;a href=\"Wastewander\"&gt;Wastewander&lt;/a&gt;s and the &lt;a href=\"silithid\"&gt;silithid&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe dungeon &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Farrak\"&gt;Zul'Farrak&lt;/a&gt; is located in this zone.\nThe most notable quest chains in this zone include &lt;a href=\"Gadgetzan%20Water%20Survey\"&gt;doing a water survey, stumbling on horrifying adversaries&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Thirsty%20Goblin\"&gt;helpitn Marin Noggenfogger create his famous elixir&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Screecher%20Spirits\"&gt;helping the ensure the Blood God Hakkar does not come back&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter Tanaris, the player has several directions on where to go. One of the first quests the player gets is a breadcrumb to &lt;a href=\"Feralas%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt;, and later on the player gets breadcrumbs to &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Un%27Goro%20Crater%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Un'Goro Crater&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Feralas%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt;.\nLarge forest on the south-western shore of Kalimdor. Formerly one of the largest night elf strongholds, currently their reach is limited to their &lt;a href=\"Feathermoon%20Stronghold%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;island fortress&lt;/a&gt;. The main enemies here are &lt;a href=\"Hatecrest\"&gt;Hatecrest&lt;/a&gt; naga, &lt;a href=\"Woodpaw%20clan\"&gt;Woodpaw clan&lt;/a&gt; furbolgs, &lt;a href=\"Gordunni\"&gt;Gordunni&lt;/a&gt; ogres and &lt;a href=\"silithid\"&gt;silithid&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe dungeon &lt;a href=\"Dire%20Maul\"&gt;Dire Maul&lt;/a&gt; is located here. In addition, one of the &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20of%20Nightmare%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Dragons of Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; can appear from the dream portal in the northern part of the zone.\nThe most notable quests for Alliance involve &lt;a href=\"Freedom%20for%20All%20Creatures\"&gt;rescuing animals from a Grimtotem camp, only to end up becoming a parent&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Missing%20Courier\"&gt;investigating a missing courier, finding out once-sealed horrors are back&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"In%20Search%20of%20Knowledge\"&gt;going to the opposite end of the world in a quest for knowledge&lt;/a&gt;. For the Horde, the most notable quest chains involve &lt;a href=\"A%20Strange%20Request%20%28Feralas%29\"&gt;utilizing natural forces in a way they don't like&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"War%20on%20the%20Woodpaw%20%28Horde%29\"&gt;fighting against the encroaching Woodpaw furbolgs&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter finishing, the player is given directions towards &lt;a href=\"Tanaris%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Felwood%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Un%27Goro%20Crater%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Un'Goro Crater&lt;/a&gt;.\nA crater in the southern Kalimdor. Despite being surrounded by deserts on all sides, this zone is a lush jungle. The main opponents here are &lt;a href=\"silithid\"&gt;silithid&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe most notable quest lines involve &lt;a href=\"Muigin%20and%20Larion\"&gt;doing errands for a pair&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Larion%20and%20Muigin\"&gt;of guys who hate each other&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Crystals%20of%20Power\"&gt;trying to make sense of the pylons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"It%27s%20a%20Secret%20to%20Everybody\"&gt;trying to recover a gnome's memory&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring questing, the player will receive breadcrumbs to both &lt;a href=\"Felwood%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Winterspring%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Winterspring&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, the player can go to any capital city and get the breadcrumb to &lt;a href=\"Silithus%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;, which is right next to Un'Goro Crater.\n&lt;a href=\"Felwood%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt;.\nFel-corrupted forest in northern Kalimdor. The main opponents here are corrupted &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt; and demons.\nThe most notable quest lines involve &lt;a href=\"Forces%20of%20Jaedenar%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;dealing blows against the forces of Jaedenar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Flute%20of%20Xavaric%20%28quest%29\"&gt;purifying a flute that can release spirits of fel-corrupted ancients&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Corruption\"&gt;helping a crazy lady with equally crazy experiments&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"A%20Strange%20Red%20Key\"&gt;rescuing a night elf from Jaedenar, and avenging her companion that didn't make it&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter finishing, the player is directed east, through &lt;a href=\"Timbermaw%20Hold\"&gt;Timbermaw Hold&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Winterspring%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Winterspring&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Azshara%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt;.\nBeautiful coastal area, dotted by shattered cliffs and night elf ruins. Hard to navigate. The main opponents here are &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe world boss &lt;a href=\"Azuregos%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Azuregos&lt;/a&gt; appears in this zone.\nThis area is one of the most quest-barren. The most notable quest lines include &lt;a href=\"Passing%20the%20Burden\"&gt;retrieving and delivering&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Stealing%20Knowledge\"&gt;ancient runes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Betrayed\"&gt;killing a traitorous blood elf&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Demon%20Hunter\"&gt;helping a demon hunter create a demon-slaying weapon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Poisoned%20Water\"&gt;assisting the water elementals in their efforts&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter finishing up, the player can follow &lt;a href=\"Duke%20Hydraxis\"&gt;Duke Hydraxis&lt;/a&gt;' quests to &lt;a href=\"Silithus%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Eastern Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Moonglade\"&gt;Moonglade&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe mysterious forest in the northern part of Kalimdor. Very hard to get to on foot, and the only passage is controlled by the &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Timbermaw%20Hold%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Timbermaw Hold&lt;/a&gt;, whose trust the player has to earn to pass through unmolested.\nFor the most part, the only ones to have any business here are &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s. It's only on very high levels that characters of other classes have any reason to come here. The only exception is during the &lt;a href=\"Lunar%20Festival\"&gt;Lunar Festival&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Winterspring%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Winterspring&lt;/a&gt;.\nA high-altitude, low-temperature zone. Despite looking relatively pristine, corruption still seeps here. The main opponents in this zone are demons and &lt;a href=\"Winterfall%20tribe\"&gt;Winterfall tribe&lt;/a&gt; furbolgs.\nThe most notable quest chains include &lt;a href=\"The%20Ruins%20of%20Kel%27Theril%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;investigating the curse of the ruins of Kel'Theril&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Winterfall%20Firewater%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;fighting against the corrupted furbolg and trying to find how they got corrupted&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Are%20We%20There%2C%20Yeti%3F%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;creating a mechanical yeti&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis is one of the end-of-leveling zones, as such no follow-ups are necessary.\n&lt;a href=\"Silithus%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;.\nA &lt;a href=\"silithid\"&gt;silithid&lt;/a&gt;-infested desert in the south-west of Kalimdor. Not a particularly interesting zone. Aside from silithid, there are also elementals and &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; cultists to fight.\nThe raid instances &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ruins of Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Temple of Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt; are located in this zone.\nBefore a certain &lt;a href=\"Patch%201.8.0\"&gt;point&lt;/a&gt; in the game the zone was barren, having only a single quest chain and a few quests from other zones. Since then, its quest list was expanded.\nThe most notable quest chains include &lt;a href=\"Wasteland\"&gt;finding what destroyed Southwind Village&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dearest%20Natalia\"&gt;trying to save the wife of a Cenarion Hold commander&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Twilight%20Mystery\"&gt;encountering a Twilight's Hammer deserter&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis is one of the end-of-leveling zones, as such no follow-ups are necessary."}

This only covers the original \"World of Warcraft\" (and, by extension \"\").\nInitial release.\nReputation grind.\nReputation grind was a major part of World of Warcraft endgame.\nThe player can grind reputation with capital cities of their faction, with the reward of being able to purchase their &lt;a href=\"Mount\"&gt;Mount&lt;/a&gt;s upon reaching .\nApart from one-time quests, there is a certain quest line, ending with a repeatable quest, that serves primarily to gain reputation.\nWhile not very important in the long run, having these &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt;s at least not would allow one to get through their tunnel between &lt;a href=\"Felwood%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Winterspring%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Winterspring&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Moonglade\"&gt;Moonglade&lt;/a&gt; unmolested.\nThe player can get reputation by killing corrupted furbolg in Felwood and Winterspring, and doing quests for them. Here are the initial quests.\nAfter reaching the player can get more quests:\nA reward for reaching is these quests:\nOne of the initial endgame reputations, primarily concerned with fighting against undead. Apart from one-time quests, the player can gain reputation with them in the following ways:\nHaving at least with Argent Dawn is important, as it is mandatory to eventually enter &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt;.\nA very important reputation for early raiding, as having with them is necessary to be able to fight the last two bosses of &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Core\"&gt;Molten Core&lt;/a&gt;. The player can gain reputation by killing elementals in &lt;a href=\"Silithus%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;, (until ), &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Depths\"&gt;Blackrock Depths&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Blackrock%20Spire%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Upper Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt; and, of course, Molten Core itself (until ). Once at Revered, the only way to get further reputation is by killing bosses in Molten Core.\nDungeon attunements.\nThe first notable storylines are dungeon keys and attunements. There are not that many dungeons that require attunements, but there are some.\nThe player needs to obtain the &lt;a href=\"Shadowforge%20Key\"&gt;Shadowforge Key&lt;/a&gt; in order to progress past a certain point of Blackrock Depths. It is obtained through a pair of quests in the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe gate to scholomance is initially locked, and requires a &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20Key\"&gt;Skeleton Key&lt;/a&gt; to open. To obtain it, the player needs to do a certain quest chain in the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Plaguelands%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Western Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo progress past a certain point in the \"living\" part of Stratholme, the player needs to retrieve &lt;a href=\"The%20Scarlet%20Key\"&gt;The Scarlet Key&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Monastery%20Library\"&gt;Scarlet Monastery Library&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn addition, once the player gets the &lt;a href=\"Key%20to%20the%20City\"&gt;Key to the City&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Magistrate%20Barthilas\"&gt;Magistrate Barthilas&lt;/a&gt;, they can enter the dungeon through the side entrance.\nRaid questlines.\nOne does not simply walk into raid instance of World of Warcraft. First, they must prove themself worthy.\nTo gain access to Upper Blackrock Spire, the player needs to complete a pair of quests in &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Lower Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile a player \"can\" walk into Molten Core with no preparation, they cannot access the last two bosses of the instance without the help of &lt;a href=\"Hydraxian%20Waterlords\"&gt;Hydraxian Waterlords&lt;/a&gt;. But it takes work before the water elementals will provide said help.\nFor a time, Onyxia's Lair was the peak of raiding. It does require a lot of effort before the player is allowed entrance, with Upper Blackrock Spire unlock being mandatory.\n&lt;a href=\"Patch%201.2.0\"&gt;Patch 1.2.0&lt;/a&gt; - Mysteries of Maraudon.\n&lt;a href=\"Maraudon\"&gt;Maraudon&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe major addition is the addition of a new dungeon in &lt;a href=\"Desolace%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Desolace&lt;/a&gt;. While not end-game level, it is reasonably high level, with some of the items there being almost Best in Slot. The quests associated with Maraudon are:\n&lt;a href=\"Patch%201.3.0\"&gt;Patch 1.3.0&lt;/a&gt; - Mysteries of Dire Maul.\n&lt;a href=\"Dire%20Maul\"&gt;Dire Maul&lt;/a&gt;.\nAnother new dungeon, the ruined night elf city in &lt;a href=\"Feralas%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt;. There is a \"lot\" of things to do. The quests associated with clearing Dire Maul are:\nIn addition, it is possible to run through one of the wings without killing any bosses but the final - a so-called &lt;a href=\"Dire%20Maul%20tribute%20run\"&gt;tribute run&lt;/a&gt;. The quests associated with the tribute run are:\n&lt;a href=\"Shen%27dralar\"&gt;Shen'dralar&lt;/a&gt;.\nPart of dealing with the Dire Maul is dealing with Shen'dralar. By doing quests for them, the player can obtain powerful enchantments, class-specific trinkets, and one of the most powerful tank swords at the time.\nWorld Bosses.\nAnother addition of the patch are the world bosses:\nWhile there are no quests associated with fighting and defeating them (at the time, at least), they provide some very powerful rewards.\nAttunement to the Molten Core.\nWith the addition of dungeon player caps, the previous entrance to &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Core\"&gt;Molten Core&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Depths\"&gt;Blackrock Depths&lt;/a&gt; has become impractical. As such, a quest has been added to bypass it.\n&lt;a href=\"Patch%201.4.0\"&gt;Patch 1.4.0&lt;/a&gt; - The Call to War.\nThe main addition of this patch is the &lt;a href=\"Honor%20system%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Honor system&lt;/a&gt;, which promotes Player versus Player combat. In addition, there are several class-specific questlines, and more...\nGurubashi Arena Master.\nMost of the PvP was not connected to quests. The one that was is &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20Arena\"&gt;Gurubashi Arena&lt;/a&gt; Treasure Chest - opening it once awarded the &lt;a href=\"Arena%20Master\"&gt;Arena Master&lt;/a&gt; and opened a quest to obtain eleven more to get &lt;a href=\"Arena%20Grand%20Master\"&gt;Arena Grand Master&lt;/a&gt;.\nPaladin - &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Charger\"&gt;Summon Charger&lt;/a&gt;.\nPaladins get an epic questline that awards their class-specific Epic mount, the Charger.\nPriest - &lt;a href=\"Benediction\"&gt;Benediction&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Anathema\"&gt;Anathema&lt;/a&gt;.\nPriests get an epic questline that awards a powerful healer staff that can be transformed to suit DPS needs.\nHunter - &lt;a href=\"Rhok%27delar%2C%20Longbow%20of%20the%20Ancient%20Keepers\"&gt;Rhok'delar, Longbow of the Ancient Keepers&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Lok%27delar%2C%20Stave%20of%20the%20Ancient%20Keepers\"&gt;Lok'delar, Stave of the Ancient Keepers&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Sinew%20Wrapped%20Lamina\"&gt;Ancient Sinew Wrapped Lamina&lt;/a&gt;.\nHunters get an epic questline that awards a powerful bow that can transform into a staff, and the best quiver in original World of Warcraft.\nShaman - &lt;a href=\"Skyfury%20Helm\"&gt;Skyfury Helm&lt;/a&gt;.\nShamans get an epic questline that awards a powerful helm. Initially, the reward was &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Latent%20Power\"&gt;not so powerful&lt;/a&gt;, but &lt;a href=\"Patch%201.7.0\"&gt;Patch 1.7.0&lt;/a&gt; took care of that.\nWarlock - &lt;a href=\"Inferno%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Inferno (Classic)&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Ritual%20of%20Doom%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Ritual of Doom (Classic)&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Dreadsteed\"&gt;Dreadsteed&lt;/a&gt;.\nWarlocks get three different quest chains.\nThe first chain awards the spell Inferno, which summons a subjugatable &lt;a href=\"Infernal%20%28warlock%20minion%29\"&gt;Infernal&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe second chain awards the spell Ritual of Doom - a 5-man spell that sacrifices one of the participants to summon a subjugatable &lt;a href=\"Doomguard%20%28warlock%20minion%29\"&gt;Doomguard&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe third quest chain awards the class-specific mount - the Dreadsteed.\nBlacksmithing - Imperial Plate and Enchanted Thorium armor.\nBlacksmiths get a number of quests that award new armor plans.\n&lt;a href=\"Derotain%20Mudsipper\"&gt;Derotain Mudsipper&lt;/a&gt; is happy to get some armor plans off his hands. He will, however, take your kidney for it. Or lots and lots of &lt;a href=\"Thorium%20Bar\"&gt;Thorium Bar&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThis is an &lt;a href=\"Armorsmithing\"&gt;Armorsmithing&lt;/a&gt; exclusive part - a number of Armorsmithing plans can be obtained by defeating bosses in high-level dungeons and bringing the reconstructed books to &lt;a href=\"Lorekeeper%20Lydros\"&gt;Lorekeeper Lydros&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dire%20Maul\"&gt;Dire Maul&lt;/a&gt;.\nDestined to be Legendary.\nAnother, not initially advertised, addition was the first legendary weapon, &lt;a href=\"Sulfuras%2C%20Hand%20of%20Ragnaros\"&gt;Sulfuras, Hand of Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Patch%201.5.0\"&gt;Patch 1.5.0&lt;/a&gt; - Battlegrounds.\nThe storylines added in this patch mostly have to deal with eponymous battlegrounds.\n&lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Gulch\"&gt;Warsong Gulch&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe first battleground is a 10vs10 \"Capture the Flag\" map. It can be entered starting with level 10. The quests associated with Warsong Gulch are:\nThere are also some quests related to &lt;a href=\"Silverwing%20Sentinels\"&gt;Silverwing Sentinels&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Outriders\"&gt;Warsong Outriders&lt;/a&gt; reputations that award supplies:\n&lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Valley\"&gt;Alterac Valley&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe second battleground is a 40vs40 \"Assault\" map, where the players have to assault the enemy base and kill the enemy leader OR exhaust enemy reinforcements to win. There are many quests associated with Alterac Valley:\nThe quests related to &lt;a href=\"Stormpike%20Guard\"&gt;Stormpike Guard&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20clan\"&gt;Frostwolf clan&lt;/a&gt; reputations and upgrading the &lt;a href=\"Stormpike%20Insignia\"&gt;Stormpike Insignia&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20Insignia\"&gt;Frostwolf Insignia&lt;/a&gt;:\nQuests unconnected to reputation chain are:\nAnd then there are repeatable quests that, when repeated enough, provide benefits in the current match:\nTurning in &lt;a href=\"Armor%20Scraps\"&gt;Armor Scraps&lt;/a&gt; eventually upgrades NPC allies, making them stronger and tougher. Every turn-in also provides a non-stacking bonus of +10% armor. NPCs will recieve an upgrade every 500 scraps, for a maximum of 1500 scraps for three upgrades.\nDelivering &lt;a href=\"Irondeep%20Supplies\"&gt;Irondeep Supplies&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Coldtooth%20Supplies\"&gt;Coldtooth Supplies&lt;/a&gt; from the mine eventually allows a player of at least reputation to call in an infantry attack. A total of 280 supplies must be delivered to begin the assault, with supplies from enemy mine counting quadruple.\nBringing in rams / wolves for taming, and &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20Hide\"&gt;Frostwolf Hide&lt;/a&gt;s / &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Ram%20Hide\"&gt;Alterac Ram Hide&lt;/a&gt;s for bardings eventually allows a player of at least reputation to call in a cavalry attack. A total of 25 mounts and hides must be turned-in to begin the assault. \nRescuing the Wing Commanders and giving the the medals / flesh eventually allows a player of at least reputation to call in an airstrike.\nDelivering &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Crystal\"&gt;Storm Crystal&lt;/a&gt;s / &lt;a href=\"Stormpike%20Soldier%27s%20Blood\"&gt;Stormpike Soldier's Blood&lt;/a&gt; eventually allows the players to call for a summoning of &lt;a href=\"Ivus%20the%20Forest%20Lord\"&gt;Ivus the Forest Lord&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=\"Lokholar%20the%20Ice%20Lord\"&gt;Lokholar the Ice Lord&lt;/a&gt;. A total of 200 crystals / blood must be turned in to get the NPCs moving. Once the NPCs arrive at the designated area, and enough players join in the summoning, the Lords will join in the fight. \nZone update - &lt;a href=\"Searing%20Gorge%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Searing Gorge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Feralas%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt;.\nAnother thing added in the patch was updated to some of the zones. &lt;a href=\"Thorium%20Point\"&gt;Thorium Point&lt;/a&gt; was added to previously lacking in quests Searing Gorge, while &lt;a href=\"Revantusk%20Village\"&gt;Revantusk Village&lt;/a&gt; was added to the Hinterlands as counterpart to &lt;a href=\"Aerie%20Peak\"&gt;Aerie Peak&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, while no new settlements were added to Feralas, there are many new quests.\n&lt;a href=\"Patch%201.6.0\"&gt;Patch 1.6.0&lt;/a&gt; - Assault on Blackwing Lair.\n&lt;a href=\"Blackwing%20Lair\"&gt;Blackwing Lair&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe big addition of this patch is the addition of another raid instance, Blackwing Lair. Before the player can access it, they need to attune to it. Thankfully, the attunement is short and only needs a single &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Blackrock%20Spire%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Upper Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt; run.\nDid Someone Say....\nAnother addition of the patch was a second legendary weapon - &lt;a href=\"Thunderfury%2C%20Blessed%20Blade%20of%20the%20Windseeker\"&gt;Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker&lt;/a&gt;. \n&lt;a href=\"Patch%201.7.0\"&gt;Patch 1.7.0&lt;/a&gt; - Rise of the Blood God.\n&lt;a href=\"Zul%27Gurub%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Zull'Gurub&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe first and main major addition of the patch is Zul'Gurub - a raid instance that is in-between Tier 1 raids and Blackwing Lair, located in &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt;. The entrance to Zul'Gurub is not blocked by attunement, but a certain questline serves as a background and a breadcrumb for it:\nThe quests that take place in actual raid instance are:\nIn addition, there is a large number of turn-in quests that can be used to obtain Zandalar Tribe set armor, trinkets and neck pieces, as well as enchantments. For that, see &lt;a href=\"Zandalar%20Tribe%20set\"&gt;Zandalar Tribe set&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Gurub%20enchantment\"&gt;Zul'Gurub enchantment&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Basin\"&gt;Arathi Basin&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe second major addition is Arathi Basin - a 15vs15 \"resource race\" battleground. A number of quests related to the battleground and its reputation factions, &lt;a href=\"League%20of%20Arathor\"&gt;League of Arathor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Defilers\"&gt;The Defilers&lt;/a&gt; can be picked up in &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Arathi Highlands&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Sunken Temple, Round One.\nIn addition, a number of class quests were added. They are all around level 50, require defeating &lt;a href=\"Morphaz\"&gt;Morphaz&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Atal%27Hakkar%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Temple of Atal'Hakkar&lt;/a&gt; in the final quest, and award a powerful trinket.\n&lt;a href=\"Patch%201.8.0\"&gt;Patch 1.8.0&lt;/a&gt; - Dragons of Nightmare.\n&lt;a href=\"Dragons%20of%20Nightmare%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Dragons of Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe big addition of this patch is a set of four World Bosses (&lt;a href=\"Lethon%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Lethon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emeriss%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Emeriss&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ysondre%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Ysondre&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Taerar%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Taerar&lt;/a&gt;), that can appear from &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; portals in &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Duskwood%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Duskwood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Feralas%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt;. There is a short quest chain that essentially acts as a reward for defeating one of them.\nZone Update - &lt;a href=\"Silithus%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis is the patch where Silithus was finally quest-filled. It only took seven major patches. For a list of quests in Silithus, see &lt;a href=\"Silithus%20quests\"&gt;Silithus quests&lt;/a&gt;.\nA smaller zone update was given to &lt;a href=\"Tanaris%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt;, adding a number of quests to &lt;a href=\"Steamwheedle%20Port\"&gt;Steamwheedle Port&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Sunken Temple, Round Two.\nThis patch also added the rest of the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Atal%27Hakkar%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Temple of Atal'Hakkar&lt;/a&gt; class quest chains, though the Druid chain was added in one of the minor patches later.\n&lt;a href=\"Patch%201.9.0\"&gt;Patch 1.9.0&lt;/a&gt; - The Gates of Ahn'Qiraj.\nAhn'Qiraj:The Forgotten Kindom.\nThe biggest addition of this patch was the addition of a pair of raid instances in southern &lt;a href=\"Silithus%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt; - the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ruins&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Temple of Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt;. Hovewer, unlocking them is a server-wide task that consisted of two parts.\nThe first part of the unlocking process - the ability to turn in resources in return for a number of &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Commendation%20Signet\"&gt;Alliance Commendation Signet&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Commendation%20Signet\"&gt;Horde Commendation Signet&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj%20War%20Effort%20Supplies\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj War Effort Supplies&lt;/a&gt;. The war effort needed tens or even hundreds of thousand of supplies to succeed, so every character could contribute regardless of their level - even low-level characters could bring a batch of &lt;a href=\"Copper%20Bar\"&gt;Copper Bar&lt;/a&gt;, for example, and receive rewards. In addition, the Alliance and the Horde need to cooperate in this one - every objective on both sides must be completed.\nCooking:\nFirst Aid:\nHerbalism:\nMining:\nSkinning:\nThe second part of unlocking the raids involved a long and arduous questline, involving multiple forays into previous raids, several world boss fights and a lot of grinding.\n&lt;a href=\"Patch%201.10.0\"&gt;Patch 1.10.0&lt;/a&gt; - Storms of Azeroth.\nOne of the \"under-the-hood\" patches - it did not add much in terms of major content, instead focusing on quality of life changes.\nThe Fate of Veiled Blade.\nThe major storyline added in this patch is a long quest chain focusing on the mercenary guild &lt;a href=\"Veiled%20Blade\"&gt;Veiled Blade&lt;/a&gt; and their ill-fated expedition into &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Blackrock%20Spire%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Upper Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;. The main reason to do this quest chain is to upgrade the player's &lt;a href=\"Dungeon%20Set%201\"&gt;Dungeon Set 1&lt;/a&gt; equipment into &lt;a href=\"Dungeon%20Set%202\"&gt;Dungeon Set 2&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Patch%201.11.0\"&gt;Patch 1.11.0&lt;/a&gt; - Shadow of the Necropolis.\n&lt;a href=\"Naxxramas%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe main addition of this patch is Naxxramas - the eponymous necropolis, which serves as a final raid instance of original \"World of Warcraft\", and the entrance to which is located in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Eastern Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;. It was prefixed by the world event &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20Invasion\"&gt;Scourge Invasion&lt;/a&gt;.\nAttuning to the raid instance requires reputation with &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt; - at least is necessary to attune at all, while having higher levels reduces attunement costs.\nThe quests associated with Naxxramas are:\nLong-Lost Power.\nAnother addition, tied with Naxxramas, is &lt;a href=\"Atiesh%2C%20Greatstaff%20of%20the%20Guardian\"&gt;Atiesh, Greatstaff of the Guardian&lt;/a&gt; - a legendary staff for caster classes, Atiesh serves as a culmination of power for those classes.\n&lt;a href=\"Patch%201.12.0\"&gt;Patch 1.12.0&lt;/a&gt; - Drums of War.\nThe final major patch of original \"World of Warcraft\" is focused primarily on PvP. Its major additions are Cross-Realm Battlegrounds, the first instance of cross-realm play in the game, and pair of max-level World PvP events.\n&lt;a href=\"A%20Game%20of%20Towers\"&gt;A Game of Towers&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe first World PvP event involves capturing towers in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Eastern Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt; for various bonuses that work in the Eastern Plaguelands, &lt;a href=\"Stratholme%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt;. There is one quest on each side, dealing with this event:\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Silithyst%20Must%20Flow\"&gt;The Silithyst Must Flow&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe second World PvP event involves scouring &lt;a href=\"Silithus%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt; for geysers of &lt;a href=\"Silithyst\"&gt;Silithyst&lt;/a&gt;, and delivering said substance to their faction camp. The first faction to collect 200 Silithyst wins and gains a buff that increases &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; reputation gains by 25%, and lasts until the other faction collects their 200. The quests involved in the event are:"}

Some areas were cut before being released, game balance was completely overhauled several times, \"\" wiped the state clean on two continents.\nThe game itself started as a &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20III%20evolution%20guide\"&gt;rescripted modification&lt;/a&gt; of the \"\" engine, and the project was already started in 1999, 3 years before the eventual release of \"Warcraft III\" itself. Before the game's release, &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20RPG\"&gt;RPG&lt;/a&gt; books such as \"&lt;a href=\"Lands%20of%20Conflict\"&gt;Lands of Conflict&lt;/a&gt;\" had already mapped out and described part of the content that was to appear in \"World of Warcraft\" in the years after.\nHowever, time has a tendency to warp memories and old websites can die down, and as such some of these facts can't be proven with references anymore, so take any \"citation needed\" statement with a grain of salt. Note that this list was compiled from the works of many users, and each of them should be thanked for their efforts. Still, the topic is immense, and more researches/updates on this article would be warmly welcomed.\nGame mechanics.\nCombat.\nWhile not necessarily harder, the combat system back then involved more number-crunching than presently, with more secondary stats and less streamlined itemization.\nInventory.\nDuring the early years of the game, &lt;a href=\"inventory\"&gt;inventory&lt;/a&gt; space was much more limited than now.\nMiscellaneous.\nAt release, many \"quality of life\" features were yet to be implemented.\nQuests.\n&lt;a href=\"Quest\"&gt;Quest&lt;/a&gt; design was less streamlined and cinematic than currently due to the lack of &lt;a href=\"phasing\"&gt;phasing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"scenario\"&gt;scenario&lt;/a&gt;s. Furthermore, many high-level questlines forced players to travel back and forth all over the world in order to complete them, and before the addition of quest markers, some quests like &lt;a href=\"Lost%20in%20Battle\"&gt;Lost in Battle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Ancient%20Leaf\"&gt;The Ancient Leaf&lt;/a&gt; were notorious for their cryptic directions (or lack thereof). The &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s were originally treated more like anonymous mercenaries by NPCs, it was only in ' that they started to be recognized for their deeds. ' completely revamped the quests of the two original continents in order to bring them more in line with modern quest design.\nRiding.\n&lt;a href=\"Mount\"&gt;Mount&lt;/a&gt;s were originally handled by players in a more \"personal\" way, mainly because they were rarer and harder to acquire. Players usually kept to one mount and for a long time.\nTime and monetary investment.\nAt release, it usually took much longer to do things compared to now. Leveling up was longer, &lt;a href=\"reputation\"&gt;reputation&lt;/a&gt; grinding was harder, money was sparser.\nUser interface.\n\"World of Warcraft\"'s &lt;a href=\"user%20interface\"&gt;user interface&lt;/a&gt; was designed to be simple and easy to understand, similar to \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20franchise\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\". While already customizable, at release the UI lacked several features that now seem essential:\nProfessions.\nDuring the game's original development, the designers made a distinction between &lt;a href=\"profession\"&gt;profession&lt;/a&gt;s and \"minigames\" like &lt;a href=\"Fishing\"&gt;Fishing&lt;/a&gt;. While professions were planned out early on, minigames had to be implemented using extra code, and as a result there were several planned minigames that didn't make the cut to the final game.\nZones and storylines.\nOriginal alpha/beta zones.\nThe game was originally planned to launch with around 6 major continents. This was eventually downscaled to only two: the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles%20%28original%29\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Kezan\"&gt;Kezan&lt;/a&gt;\nVanilla zones.\n&lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands\"&gt;Arathi Highlands&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Basin\"&gt;Arathi Basin&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Azshara%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Badlands%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Badlands&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Uldaman\"&gt;Uldaman&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Barrens%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Razorfen%20Kraul%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Razorfen Kraul&lt;/a&gt;

Read the &lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft%20on%20Mac\"&gt;World of Warcraft on Mac&lt;/a&gt; article for general information about World of Warcraft on Mac.\nPerformance Tips.\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/969747052\"&gt;This thread&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"http%3A//us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/1011702/\"&gt;Blizzard Mac Technical Support&lt;/a&gt; forum offers good information on how to optimise WoW both through tweaking options and upgrading graphics cards. Furthermore, &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.xlr8yourmac.com/\"&gt;Accelerate Your Mac&lt;/a&gt; has a page dedicated to &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.xlr8yourmac.com/games/mac_wow_performance.html\"&gt;user reports&lt;/a&gt; on WoW performance on individual Macs.\nGeneral Tips\nWorld of Warcraft on Intel Macs.\nOn January 10, 2006, &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.apple.com\"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; announced the first of the &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.intel.com\"&gt;Intel&lt;/a&gt;-based macs (&lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.apple.com/macbookpro/\"&gt;Macbook Pro&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.apple.com/imac/\"&gt;iMac&lt;/a&gt;) which can still run older PowerPC programs in emulation mode with &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.apple.com/rosetta/\"&gt;Rosetta&lt;/a&gt;. Intel-ready programs are usually available as &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.apple.com/universal/\"&gt;Universal Binaries&lt;/a&gt;, programs that can run on PPC and Intel.\nAs of Patch 1.9.3.5059, WoW for Mac OS X supports the Intel Macintosh. Performance is generally considered very good.\nIntel-based Macs.\nNote: Please beware that several old revisions of iMac, MacBook Air, MacBook and Mac mini use integrated graphics chipset (Intel GMA950 or GMA X3100) instead of a dedicated GPU+VRAM, which has very poor graphics performance. Owners of such models will benefit from running World of Warcraft under Microsoft Windows using Apple's &lt;a href=\"http%3A//apple.com/bootcamp\"&gt;Boot Camp&lt;/a&gt; utility, but requires a purchase of Windows.\nApple has stopped making such models in late 2008 (Mac mini was the last model to use Intel graphics and was updated in March 2009) and all new Macs come with dedicated GPU.\nVentrilo.\nThe official Mac port of Ventrilo is currently in beta and missing some features. Ventrilo's developers promise full cross-platform feature parity for their upcoming 3.0 release. Unfortunately this didn't quite go as far as including a way to \"normalize\" incoming communications, with the result that Mac users either have to go through a two-to-three program long workaround (involving taking the incoming voice comms through at least one other application before going through GarageBand and then out through the speakers), or to suffer the whims of the Ventrilo Volume gods.\nVentrilo servers use the GSM codec by default; the Mac client only supports the Speex codec, so usually a server will need to be reconfigured to support Mac clients. A common misconception among Ventrilo users is that using the Speex codec results in poor audio quality; this is actually an effect of the Ventrilo client/server architecture when mixed-version clients are connected. \"All clients, Windows included, must be updated to the latest version of Ventrilo\" or Speex audio quality will be reduced.\nUsing \"Push To Talk\" functionality in Ventrilo requires turning on \"Enable access for assistive devices\" in the Universal Access pane of System Preferences.\nTeamSpeak.\n&lt;a href=\"TeamSpeex\"&gt;TeamSpeex&lt;/a&gt; is a third-party client for TeamSpeak 2 servers. It supports only the Speex client (however, this is default on TS servers, so it's less likely to be an issue). \"Push To Talk\" functionality is available without enabling Universal Access.\nTeamSpeak 3 is not compatible with Version 2, use TeamSpeex in those cases.\nMighty Mouse.\nUntil late 2009, desktop Macs came with Apple's (USB or wireless) &lt;a href=\"http%3A//apple.com\"&gt;Mighty Mouse&lt;/a&gt;, a 4 button mouse with a bidirectional scroll ball. It, too, has some caveats when it comes to WoW:\nMagic Mouse.\nSince December 2009, Apple has shipped Macs with a new model mouse, the &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.apple.com/magicmouse/\"&gt;Magic Mouse&lt;/a&gt;, which only works with OS X 10.5.8 or later. This is a single-button mouse with multi-touch capabilities; it supports right-clicking in the same way as the &lt;a href=\"%23Mighty%20Mouse\"&gt;Mighty Mouse&lt;/a&gt; (that is, by pressing the right half of the mouse while there is no touch on the left side), except this is enabled by default.\nThe Magic Mouse has no scroll wheel or ball: swipe from front to back, or vice-versa, over the mouse to get the same effect as when using a scroll wheel on traditional mice. WoW recognises this and treats it like any normal use of the scroll wheel or ball on another mouse.\nBy default, the Magic Mouse is set up for \"momentum-scrolling\" \u2014 that is, if swiping a finger over the mouse and lifting it off as part of the swipe, it will continue scrolling for a little bit (this does not happen when deliberately dragging a finger over the mouse and stopping it on the mouse, rather than lifting the finger off the mouse during the swipe). In WoW, this has the unfortunate effect that almost any accidental swipe over the mouse usually leads to zooming in or out completely. If your character appears to have become invisible, scroll out by dragging a finger across the mouse from front to back. Momentum-scrolling can be turned off on the Mouse pane of the System Preferences, but would have to be turned on again if you want to be able to use this when using other programs than WoW.\nAlthough the standard settings for the Magic Mouse are to support two-finger swipes as well, WoW does not recognise these. However, by installing an extra program such as &lt;a href=\"http%3A//magicprefs.com/\"&gt;MagicPrefs&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"http%3A//blog.boastr.net/\"&gt;Better Touch Tool&lt;/a&gt;, the mouse can be programmed to act as if it has more buttons, some of which WoW will recognise. Using these, it is possible to, for example, make a \"middle click\" (pressing the mouse button with one finger in the centerline of the mouse) equivalent to holding down both the left and right mouse buttons, which causes your character to run.\nSwimming While Dead.\nPatch 1.10.1 added key bindings for pitch control, so one no longer needs to use the mouse to swim (or fly) upwards or downwards. However, these controls only change the orientation of your character, not that of the camera\u2014swimming below the surface of water while water-walking (or while dead and in spirit form) requires making both your character and the camera point downward. This can only be done using the mouse: hold the right mouse button (or equivalent) and drag the mouse cursor down.\nAlternatively, use the \"Mac Options\" and \"Bindings\" to remap the W key to \"Move and Steer.\" Then face the camera down, and press W to get underwater. This works better on a Mac laptop with no spare mouse handy.\nMouse Acceleration.\nWorld of Warcraft\u2019s mouse sensitivity controls seems to be more useful on a Windows based machine.\nIt looks like, it could be disabled with codice_4, found &lt;a href=\"http%3A//forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html%3FtopicId%3D24038770965%26amp%3BpageNo%3D1%26amp%3Bsid%3D0%23240361501650\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.\nPeople who regularly use a Mac may not have any problems with the OS\u2019s mouse acceleration in-game, however people who switch between Mac and PC often will find two totally different mousing experiences.\nThere are a few tools available to fix acceleration in OS X since the operating system has no system options to do this on its own.\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.usboverdrive.com\"&gt;USB Overdrive&lt;/a&gt; is a shareware (free) option. It offers a message upon boot, but has no restrictions, and the message can be removed with purchase.\nKeyboard Issues.\nHelp! My Function Keys Don't Work Like Normal Function Keys!\nOn laptop Macs, the function keys usually perform double duty. F1 and F2 control screen brightness, F3 and F4 control volume, etc. Pressing the Fn key will use them as function keys, but you can change them to work as function keys by default in System Preferences. Open System Preferences -&gt; Keyboard &amp; Mouse -&gt; Check 'Use all F1, F2, etc. keys as standard function keys'.\nAlternatively, it's possible to automatically switch on/off this behavior via third-party apps when WoW is running and its window is in focus. One confirmed solution is installing &lt;a href=\"https%3A//github.com/Pyroh/Fluor\"&gt;Fluor&lt;/a&gt; and setting it to trigger for WoW. Make sure WoW is running while configuring the trigger so the game application can be selected in Fluor's running applications list.\nOn desktop Macs, screen brightness is controlled by F14 and F15. Their PC equivalents (Scroll Lock and Pause/Break) don't usually do anything.\nSwitching to Other Apps.\nOn Windows, one can use Alt-Tab and related shortcuts to switch to other applications without quitting WoW. On the Mac, Command-Tab generally serves this purpose, but when an app \"captures\" the display to go fullscreen on the Mac, it usurps such system keyboard shortcuts even if it doesn't do anything with them.\nWoW (and older Blizzard games, since they've been nice and consistent about it) can be switched between fullscreen and windowed modes with Cmd-M. After switching to windowed, you can Cmd-Tab to another app, Cmd-H to hide WoW, etc.\nYou can also use 3rd-party software to be able to change apps without switching to windowed mode:\nAn alternative solution would be as follows:\nThis will provide the feel of fullscreen while allowing the hotkeys to work for Spaces in Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard. The only caveat with this configuration is that upon returning to the game screen, you must click within the game window to fully resume focus and you still can't use Cmd-Tab.\nExpos\u00e9 Keys.\nThere is an \u2014 apparently \u2014 well-known issue of the WoW client overwriting the default Expos\u00e9 configuration on exit; these keys get used within the client for various functions but not restored after exit.\nA currently untested patch from a third party purportedly works around the issue:\nIn a &lt;a href=\"http%3A//forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html%3FtopicId%3D82082144%26amp%3Bsid%3D1\"&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; on the Blizzard Mac &lt;a href=\"http%3A//forums.worldofwarcraft.com/board.html%3Fsid%3D1%26amp%3BforumId%3D11111\"&gt;Tech Support Forum&lt;/a&gt; an alternative work-around has been suggested: removing the Key Bindings for keys F9 to F12, and simply using Shift-B to open all of your bags. This has apparently met with a reasonable amount of success.\nAnother workaround: some have noticed that the loss of Expos\u00e9 settings tends to occur when quitting the game while in full-screen mode; making a habit of switching to windowed mode before quitting (Cmd-M) seems to reduce the frequency of the problem.\nSound Issues.\nQ: HELP! I don't get any sound during the opening cinematic or the Wrathgate cut-scene!\nA: Fear not, young Leetskilzninjaxx. This is caused by old version of DivX/Xvid codec installed on your system. You will need to find your Library/Quicktime folder (hint: there are two of them, one in your Macintosh HD root directory and one in your Users/\"Usernamehere\" directory \u2014 you want the first one iirc), and move or delete your DivX and/or Xvid codecs.\nImage and Video.\nScreenshots.\nTo take a screenshot in WoW, press the F13 key (or, since some Macs don't have an F13 key, go into WoW's Key Bindings menu and change it to something convenient. This saves the latest frame drawn to a Screenshots folder inside your World of Warcraft folder. (You can also use the Mac's builtin screenshot key shortcuts CMD-Shift-4, but these aren't synced with the game's graphics engine, so they may capture an incomplete or \"torn\" image.) \nScreenshots are saved in the codice_5 format by default. This is a lossy compression format\u2014it produces small files, but with reduced image quality. The format of screenshots can be changed via the \"screenshotFormat\" config variables. For example, to switch to a high-quality format, type the following into the chat frame once logged into WoW:\n /console screenshotFormat png\nFor more details, see the [#Console Variables] section below. (The screenshotFormat control has been available on the Mac since Patch 1.11; it and screenshotQuality were made cross-platform in Patch 2.1.0.)\nUpdated for 4.3.3 :\nSource : http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/4366252520#5\nVideo Capture and Editing.\n&lt;a href=\"Patch%202.2.0\"&gt;Patch 2.2.0&lt;/a&gt; brought a built-in video capture utility to WoW on the Mac.\nSince this is a hugely complicated issue, it now has its own Wowpedia page at &lt;a href=\"Mac%20Video%20Recording%20and%20Editing\"&gt;Mac Video Recording and Editing&lt;/a&gt;.\nExamples of videos captured and edited on Macs:\nAvailable Codecs.\n\u00a0\nSneaky Faster Video Compression Process While You Make A Sandwich.\nSee &lt;a href=\"Mac%20Video%20Recording%20and%20Editing\"&gt;Mac Video Recording and Editing&lt;/a&gt;.\nChanging Recording Location.\nSee &lt;a href=\"Mac%20Video%20Recording%20and%20Editing\"&gt;Mac Video Recording and Editing&lt;/a&gt;.\nUsing Two Screens.\nIt is possible to play WoW on a Mac with two screens (also known as \"dual-head\" configuration), playing the game on one and leaving the other usable for different programs (such as looking up things on Wowpedia).\nThis setup is possible on all Mac Pros, MacBooks and MacBook Pros and Intel-based iMacs, as well as certain models of Mac mini and many older models of Mac. It is necessary to hook up a second screen to the video-out port \u2014 on current models of Mac, this will most often be a &lt;a href=\"http%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mini_DisplayPort\"&gt;mini DisplayPort&lt;/a&gt; or in some cases a &lt;a href=\"http%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mini-DVI\"&gt;mini-DVI&lt;/a&gt; port; older models of Mac laptop may have a full-size &lt;a href=\"http%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Visual_Interface\"&gt;DVI&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"http%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mini-VGA\"&gt;mini-VGA&lt;/a&gt; port. In all cases except the full-size DVI port, you will need to buy an adapter to go between the port and the cable supplied with the monitor; these are available from Apple as well as some other manufacturers.\nWhen the cable is plugged in, the screen should automatically be recognised by the computer. On laptops, the external screen can be switched between mirroring mode (in which the screen shows the exact same things as the built-in one) or as an actual second screen; on current desktop Macs, it is normally set to be a true second screen. The menu bar and Dock will be on the main screen, while the second screen has just a desktop background; to change which screen the menu bar and Dock appear on, go to System Preferences \u2192 Displays and on the Arrangement tab, drag the menu bar to the screen you want it on. You can also choose whether or not the screens mirror each other on this tab.\nIssues.\nThere is, however, a problem with playing WoW on a Mac with two screens: the game does not support this properly.\nA solution might seem to be to put the menu bar on the external screen and then setting WoW to maximized, windowed mode, so as to leave the menu bar and Dock accessible. Unfortunately, when WoW switches to maximized mode, it hides both Dock and menu bar, making the net result almost exactly the same as when the menu bar is displayed on the internal screen. As such, the best way to play WoW on a secondary screen is probably to use the windowed mode and put up with not being able to play \"completely\" fullscreen.\nFor a more complete solution, see the following section for a successful workaround.\nAnother issue is that in windows mode, the framerate drops to about half the rate it has in fullscreen mode (on the current author's mid-2008 iMac with an ATI Radeon HD2600 and 256 MB video memory). As mentioned in the &lt;a href=\"%23Performance%20Tips\"&gt;Performance Tips&lt;/a&gt;, however, turning off the fullscreen glow appears to improve the framerate somewhat.\nUsing two screens with the WoW window maximised on the secondary monitor (Work around).\nUsing AppleScript it is possible to run WoW full screen on a 2nd monitor, leaving the Menubar and Dock on the primary monitor.\nThis script depends on:\nThe position in the script is measured from the top left corner of the primary screen (the location of Apple menu). A positive value will move the window the right, a negative to the left.\nHere's and example script (for dual monitors of Resolution 1680x1050, primary monitor on the right, WoW on the left):\nFor ease of use, a clickable application (launcher) can be created using /Applications/Utilities/AppleScript Editor (or Automator), and the icon can be changed to something more suitable.\nKnown issues of this workaround:\nNote: This has been untested on anything prior to 10.6\nMac-specific Console Variables.\nThese can be set by typing codice_6 while in WoW.\nNOTE: 'maxfpsbk' can be used in a bit of a convoluted process to maximize the speed at which WoW compresses player-recorded video. Details above or in WoW Mac Tech Support Forum.\n\"Dual-Boxing\" on one Mac.\n&lt;a href=\"Dual%20box\"&gt;Dual box&lt;/a&gt;ing (being logged in on multiple characters at once) is possible on the Mac\u2014in fact, with the abundance of multi-CPU/multi-core Macs, it works quite well\u2014but requires some setup. You'll need to make a separate copy of the World of Warcraft application, as attempting to re-launch the same application will just refocus the already running copy. Depending on your goals, there are three common ways to go about doing this:\nWhichever approach you choose, you'll need to repeat some of you work when a WoW patch comes out. If you copied the entire folder, you can just run through the normal download/patch process for each (though you can skip the download process by copying the \"WoW-x.y.z.n-to-x.y.z.n-enUS-downloader\" and \"WoW-x.y.z.n-to-x.y.z.n-enUS-patch\" from one WoW folder to the other once the first copy is patched). If you copied just the WoW app, you'll need to re-copy it after patching your main WoW install.\nAnd of course, any approach to multiboxing requires multiple separate WoW accounts (one for each simultaneously logged in character).\nHybrid Approach \"How-To\".\nHere is a shell script that greatly simplifies the Hybrid Approach for users who are not comfortable with creating symbolic links. This script allows you to run two clients, keep the cache separate between the two, and only uses about 17MB of additional hard disk space: \n #!/bin/sh \n p1=\"/Applications/World of Warcraft\" \n p2=$p1/WoWCopy \n mkdir \"$p2\" \n ln -s \"$p1/Data\" \"$p2/Data\" \n ditto -X \"$p1/World of Warcraft.app\" \"$p2/World of Warcraft.app\"\n\"Optional: If you would like to share addons between the two installations, add the following line to the bottom of the shell script:\"\n ln -s \"$p1/Interface\" \"$p2/Interface\"\nWARNING: Whenever a patch for WoW is released, patch your main installation and then copy the patched \"World of Warcraft.app\" into your WoWCopy folder. Do NOT attempt to patch both installations as you may corrupt your Data folder and be forced to reinstall the game.\nCommand-line switches.\nYou can add &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Command-Line%20Switches\"&gt;command-line switches&lt;/a&gt; by using the codice_7 command from Terminal:\n open -a \"World of Warcraft Launcher\" --args --console\n open \"/Applications/World of Warcraft/World of Warcraft.app\"/ --args -windowed\nNotes:\nAlternatively, you can run the binary executable directly from Terminal:\n \"/Applications/World of Warcraft/World of Warcraft.app/Contents/MacOS/World of Warcraft\" -fullscreen"}
{"id": "83167", "revid": "38036619", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=83167", "title": "World of Warcraft functionality on Wine", "text": " \nWine is a free software application which aims to allow -like operating systems on the x86 architecture to execute programs written for Microsoft Windows. It is not officially supported for \"World of Warcraft\" and users have sometimes run afoul of &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard Entertainment&lt;/a&gt; policies with it.\nIntroduction.\nThis article primarily talks about setting up Wine for running the MS Windows version of &lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;. Wine also runs on Macintosh computers with x86 CPUs under Mac OS X, but since &lt;a href=\"Blizz\"&gt;Blizz&lt;/a&gt;ard makes a Mac OS X native World of Warcraft client, running it under Wine is unnecessary and even silly.\nWorld of Warcraft had a client for Linux while it was in the beta phase of development, but it was later dropped and never officially released. Currently, WoW is run on Linux by use of Windows . Given that the World of Warcraft client is no longer officially developed to work in Linux, the installation of it on Linux is a somewhat more involved process than on Windows, which it is streamlined to install more easily on. However, with some careful research, and a bit of patience, it's very possible to do so.\nAlternatively a streamlined process of installation and windows installation conversion is available via &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.playonlinux.com/\"&gt;Play On Linux&lt;/a&gt;.\nSystem Requirements.\nTo play World of Warcraft on Linux, you need:\nMost Linux distributions should work fine; these instructions don't assume any particular distro unless otherwise indicated.\nVideo support.\n3D-accelerated video generally means something made by NVidia, AMD (formerly ATI), or Intel. All of these drivers use the (DRI), so you want to make sure the driver has that enabled. Most distributions provide a utility called codice_1 which can tell you whether the drivers on your system are set up properly. Run this command:\n glxinfo | grep rendering\nand look for this response:\n direct rendering: Yes\nIf direct rendering is not enabled, or if the command is not present, consult your distribution's documentation for instructions on how to get it working. Distributions which use packages to organize their software may provide codice_1 in a package named codice_3 or codice_4.\nIn general, video on Linux will run more slowly than on Windows, so avoid video cards that only barely meet the minimum system requirements advertised by Blizzard.\nNVidia and AMD graphics chipsets have two sets of drivers available: open-source drivers, and closed drivers usually provided by the manufacturer. In general, the manufacturer's drivers will provide better performance, though this is not universal. Some distributions provide a way to install the closed drivers, but they are sometimes old, out of date, and may not support some newer chips. Open-source drivers will nearly always be installed and working without any special configuration.\nWine.\nThis guide will only cover the Wine compatibility layer. It is however fully compatible with CrossOver, and may also work with other derivatives of Wine.\nDifferent GNU/Linux distributions use different methods of installing software, which oftentimes makes it hard to make easy installation options available for all distributions, especially for large and complex projects like Wine. Luckily a lot of energy has been put into making the distribution native installation methods available for a large variety of popular distributions. Please see http://www.winehq.org/site/download and follow the installation directions for your particular distribution.\nIf you were unable to install Wine with a method found on that site, or if you are an experienced user wanting more control over the installation, then you may want to look into compiling Wine from source code. See the WineHQ wiki for information: http://wiki.winehq.org/Recommended_Packages\nInstalling WoW.\nThere are three basic methods for installing WoW within Wine. They are listed here from the easier to the more difficult methods. If one seems not to work, try the next.\nMethod 1: Download client.\nBlizzard provides a generic installer for World of Warcraft (and their other games) which downloads the entire game over the Internet. This is generally the easiest method to install the game, since it sidesteps issues with swapping discs, and you will generally have to download updates anyway after completing an install from media.\nAll European WoW clients in all languages:\nUS Version:\nAfter downloading the installer, run it under Wine, using a command like:\n wine ~/Downloads/World-of-Warcraft-Setup-enUS.exe\nUse the path and name of the file as downloaded from Blizzard, if it's not the same as the above.\nYou may be required to open certain ports on your firewall, or enable port forwarding on your router. &lt;a href=\"https%3A//us.battle.net/support/en/article/firewall-proxy-router-and-port-configuration\"&gt;Blizzard's documentation for configuring your router&lt;/a&gt; should work equally well for Linux. If you don't have an external router, you shouldn't have any issues, but check your distribution's documentation if you do need to reconfigure your local firewall.\nOlder versions of this installer will do the install directly, but when the new Battle.net Launcher goes live, this will only install the Battle.net Launcher. If you install the Battle.net Launcher, run it (using the instructions below, if needed), and select \"World of Warcraft\" in the game list. Click \"Install\" from there, if needed, to finish the install.\nMethod 2: Install from CDs.\nIf you have installation media, you can also install from that. Simply put disc 1 in the CD or DVD drive, and do the following (replace /media/cdrom0 with wherever you mount your cds):\n wine /media/cdrom0/Installer.exe\nSome dialogs during installation may appear blank or garbled, and the installer may even hang for up to 5 minutes at 100% CPU, while appearing to be doing nothing. Simply wait and click next when possible.\n\"Note: If the text is too small, and it annoys you: Please install the Microsoft core fonts per instruction of your distribution.\"\nIf everything works like it should, then the installation will run for a while and then ask for disc 2, you change CDs and it should continue until it asks for the next one and so forth, if it doesn't work, however, you will continue to receive the \"Please insert Disc 2\" Warning repeatedly. An easy way is to unmount Disk 1 then insert disk 2, it will take a few seconds for it to load and mount, but it will load. Follow these for the rest of the disks and it should be ready to go.\nIf you have problems ejecting CDs in wine try:\nStart winecfg, then select Drives, auto detect drives\nThe you'll probably get a Drive Letter like L: /media/WoWDisc1/\nNow you can use wine eject L:\nThen press the eject button on your CD/DVD drive.\nFor the next CD you'll have to run wincfg again and substitute /media/WoWDisc1/ to ... WoWDisc2 and so on.\nSo the wine eject will work without a Problem.\nNo Installer.exe?\nThis may primarily be a Fuse problem, but may appear on other systems not using Fuse as well. Run the following command from a terminal:\n sudo mount -o remount,unhide /dev/cdrom\nNote that your CD drive may not be /dev/cdrom! Check by running the command codice_5 without arguments and look for a reasonable device (cd#, sr#, etc...)\nProblems mounting the DVD (collectors edition for [Vanilla] and [TBC] and standard for [WotLK]).\nThe issues might be related to either a defective (auto-)mount for the Hybrid Disks used (ISO 9660 and HFS+) or defective (auto-)mount without UDF support. \nFor the Hybrid disks please refer to the specific documentation available on the internet. However the most likely cause is the missing UDF support when mounting the disc.\nIn case it is mounted please unmount it \numount /dev/drivename (e.g. cdrom)\nthen use the following line to mount it again with UDF support:\nmount -t udf -o ro,unhide,uid=1000 /dev/drivename /mountpoint (e.g. /mnt)\nCopy CDs to HD.\nOne way to avoid problems with media swaps and read errors is to copy the installation media to your local hard disk, and install from there.\nTo do this, create a new folder on your computer. Copy all of the files from the first CD and all but the Installer.exe file from the rest to this directory on your hard drive (overwrite when prompted). Copying the Installer.exe from the other CD's will cause the install to fail with\n Unrecognized key \"options\". (AttributeParser::Parse)\nThen run:\n cd /&lt;path-to-directory&gt;/\n wine Installer.exe\nReplace &lt;path-to-directory&gt; with the right path to the directory where you copied all the files. You should now have the installation running, but make sure the CD media is out of the drive or it will check there and you'll be stuck in it again.\nMethod 3: Copy a working Windows install.\nIf you're migrating to Linux from Windows and don't want to reinstall and repatch your client, it is possible to copy your existing installation to Linux.\nTo do this, make sure your Wine environment (called a \"bottle\") is set up properly by running codice_6. Click OK to save the default settings, which should be good enough for now.\nOnce this is done, you will find your Wine bottle in your home directory under codice_7. This directory will contain a codice_8 directory, which will contain a drive layout similar to a typical Windows system. Find the directory \"Program Files (x86)\" under codice_8, and copy two directories from codice_10 on your Windows system to this directory:\nNote 1: Some computers might experience low FPS while trying to run WoW in OpenGL mode. In that case, removing the Config.wtf file (located in the WTF folder), running WoW to generate that file again and then making changes (to OpenGL mode) might help. Make sure to give read/write access to the WTF folder (otherwise WoW will crash). Add this line to your Config.wtf file using your favorite text editor:\n SET gxAPI \"OpenGL\"\nThis may not work as well with the Intel 945 integrated video chipset. If your game crashes frequently with this graphics chipset, try not using OpenGL.\nPlaying.\nWorld of Warcraft is typically started using a launcher. In 5.x (\"Mists of Pandaria\") and previous, the game had its own launcher, but in 6.x (\"Warlords of Draenor\"), Blizzard will be using a single Battle.net launcher for all of its games. Thus, these instructions assume that the Battle.net launcher is present.\nThe first 6.x pre-patch is due to be released sometime in October 2014. For the short period of time before then, it's probably best to install and run the Battle.net Launcher separately. It is downloadable from the same place where the online World of Warcraft installer is made available (see above).\nStart from the Desktop Icon.\nWine will create an icon for you on your desktop called \"World of Warcraft\" or \"Battle.net\". Double-click this icon to start the game.\nWhen running the game for the first time, you may be prompted to download and install the Gecko rendering engine. This is required by the Launcher to display news and other information.\nStart from the Terminal.\nYou can start WoW from a terminal window using either the Battle.net Launcher or the game itself.\nTo start the Launcher, run:\n wine \"C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Battle.net\\\\Battle.net Launcher.exe\"\nTo start the game directly, run:\n wine \"C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\World of Warcraft\\\\WoW.exe\"\nDesktop menu icon.\nTo make an icon for the desktop menu in your desktop environment:\n wine LAUNCHER\nwhere LAUNCHER is the full path to the application .exe file, either the Battle.net Launcher or WoW.exe (see above).\n [Desktop Entry]\n Name=World of Warcraft\n Exec=wine LAUNCHER\n Icon=Wow-icon-scalable.svg\n Terminal=false\n Type=Application\n Categories=Application;Game;\n StartupNotify=false\nRemember that you should also edit the Exec= line to reflect your WoW installation path, if you've installed to a special location.\nTroubleshooting.\nSee &lt;a href=\"Wine%20troubleshooting\"&gt;Wine troubleshooting&lt;/a&gt;."}

The current release of Mac OS X is version 10.6 \"10.6.7 (10J869)\" \"Snow Leopard\". The OS X client of World of Warcraft is the only client that has a built-in video capture utility.\nUser Interface Addons.\nThe same AddOns functionality is available in both Mac and Windows. Most addons are distributed in .zip files that can be openned using the native Mac interface and copied to codice_1 in the same manner as with Windows.\nHowever, the use of any third-party addon management tools will require installing Mac versions, if available. Such tools are not essential; they automate only the task of downloading and expanding the .zip file.\nTechnical Support.\nBlizzard offers a support forum for Macintosh-specific problems on WoW. The Mac team has proved highly responsive to known issues.\n\"NB: This forum is for players registered through the US servers only, and will not recognize login details for those on other servers. Mac users on the European servers should post Mac queries on Blizzard's &lt;a href=\"http%3A//eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/874936/\"&gt;European Technical Support forum&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nMouse.\nRight click.\nOlder Macs came with one-button mice, and the built-in trackpad on Mac notebooks has only one hardware button. Since WoW's UI is designed for a 2+ button mouse, this can lead to some confusion.\nAny standard multi-button USB mouse can be used with a Mac. (Macs with Bluetooth can also use any standard BT mouse.) No third-party software is necessary to make use of the secondary button or scroll wheel, or to be able to bind additional buttons to WoW actions. (Third-party software may be useful if you wish to customize extra-mouse-button actions outside of WoW, though.)\nCtrl + Mousewheel Up/Down.\nMac OS X UI comes with a default setting that prebinds the keybind `ctrl + mousewheel up/down' under desktop control (it's used to zoom in/out while on desktop - useful when you need to zoom in and out in pictures etc. while outside the game). When in the game pressing `ctrl+mousewheel' gets captured by the OS (instead of the game) and any macro binded to (or meant to handle) `ctrl+mousewheel up/down' will not work. To solve this remove the aforementioned keybind-combo from desktop-control, via Mac Os X settings. Go to:\nAnd that's it. `Ctrl + Mousewheel up/down' will now work as intended.\nKnown issues with OS X.\nThere is some crashes with Macs which have a NVIDIA card more of this crash &lt;a href=\"http%3A//us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/2089270071%235\"&gt;Info&lt;/a&gt; "}

It lies south of &lt;a href=\"Zangarmarsh\"&gt;Zangarmarsh&lt;/a&gt;, west of &lt;a href=\"Terokkar%20Forest\"&gt;Terokkar Forest&lt;/a&gt;, and southwest of &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;. It is the last remaining unscarred region of Outland.\nIn the center of the zone is the neutral town of &lt;a href=\"Halaa\"&gt;Halaa&lt;/a&gt;, which can be captured by either faction. Whoever holds it will have access to a mass of amenities including active quest givers, NPCs who accept turn-ins acquired from the zone's monsters, vendors, trainers, and the like. The opposing faction, naturally, is locked out of all this, which is precisely why they will be laying siege to it around the clock. See the &lt;a href=\"Nagrand%23World_PvP\"&gt;World PvP&lt;/a&gt; section below for more information.\nHistory.\nRise of the Horde.\nNagrand was a land that was extremely sacred to the orcs, being the meeting grounds of the orcish people, where the &lt;a href=\"Kosh%27harg\"&gt;Kosh'harg&lt;/a&gt; celebrations were held twice every year. The clans would assemble at the base of their sacred mountain, Oshu'gun, and give thanks to the spirits.\nThe land was home to the &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20clan\"&gt;Warsong clan&lt;/a&gt;, one of the most spartan of the orcish clans who rode their wolves into battle and spoke in the language of clashing axes and the fury of battle. They shared the region with the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Blade%20clan\"&gt;Burning Blade clan&lt;/a&gt;, and the mortal enemy of the orcs; the ogres of the &lt;a href=\"Gorian%20Empire\"&gt;Gorian Empire&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, the empire ruled out of the city of &lt;a href=\"Highmaul\"&gt;Highmaul&lt;/a&gt; in the west of the region.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Genocide%20of%20the%20draenei\"&gt;war against the draenei&lt;/a&gt;, Prophet &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt; and a retinue of &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s made their way to Oshu'gun \u2014 the vessel that brought them to Draenor \u2014 where they were taken prisoner by &lt;a href=\"Durotan\"&gt;Durotan&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20clan\"&gt;Frostwolf clan&lt;/a&gt;, and eventually released (Durotan's reasoning being that the draenei allowed themselves to be taken prisoner, therefore there was no honor in holding them). When the elements abandoned the orcish people, it was here \u2014 again, in the shadow of Oshu'gun \u2014 that &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; introduced the orcish people to warlock magics. Nagrand was one of the first locations to show the signs of corruption from released fel magics including desiccation by long droughts, fertile soil turned to dust and sand that would not hold grasses or crops, and the acrid odor similar to something burning.\nBeyond the Dark Portal.\nOver time, the &lt;a href=\"Bonechewer%20clan\"&gt;Bonechewer orcs&lt;/a&gt; moved to Nagrand. The region was one of the last of Draenor still being lush and green. Ironically, the Bonechewers preserved it somewhat, for in their battle-craze they had not bothered much with &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s, as such not spreading more of the &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; taint that had already ruined &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Tanaan Jungle&lt;/a&gt;.\nDespite some desiccation, Nagrand as such largely escaped the severity of corruption seen elsewhere in the world. It became known as &lt;a href=\"Mag%27har%20%28faction%29\"&gt;mag'har&lt;/a&gt;, \"uncorrupted\".

She accompanied Maiev to hunt down &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; after he was set loose during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nAftermath of the Third War.\nNaisha and Maiev followed Illidan to the port of &lt;a href=\"Nendis\"&gt;Nendis&lt;/a&gt;, where they encountered fishing villages pillaged and ruined, and mutilated bodies strewn about the debris. Some thought that perhaps demons did it, and Maiev responded that they couldn't imagine what horrors Illidan had called to his side. Naisha fought through Illidan's amassed forces of satyrs, and even their newest enemy, the naga. And to her horror, Illidan climbed aboard a ship at Nendis and fled across the sea, leaving his naga to destroy what ships remained. But Naisha and the &lt;a href=\"Watcher\"&gt;Watcher&lt;/a&gt;s killed the naga before they could scuttle all the transports.\nNaisha traveled with Maiev into the sea, and landed upon the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;. Naisha was confused, for though they had headed due east as Maiev had stipulated, these islands had not been on the map, but Maiev recognized the strange ruins - it was &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt;, Maiev's ancient homeland before the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;. Naisha was in awe, for what sort of power could raise islands from the sea floor?\nNaisha and Maiev &lt;a href=\"The%20Broken%20Isles%20%28WC3%20NightElf%29\"&gt;battled&lt;/a&gt; through Illidan's guards and found him rushing into the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;. Maiev was quick to follow him, and Naisha was quick on her heels, but within the tomb, they found strange runes scrawled in blood upon the walls. Maiev understood them, for they were orcish, and related the tale of &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;. Naisha noticed that he continually referenced an \"eye,\" and Maiev guessed that it was a demonic artifact, and that perhaps Illidan sought it now.\nNaisha and Maiev tracked Illidan to the inner core of the Tomb, where he had found the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Eye of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; and promised to make Maiev his first victim, by using the Eye to bring the Tomb down around them. After a cave in, they were immediately cut off from the rest of the Tomb, which was already sinking and collapsing. Maiev's powers would spare her, but the Watchers would be left behind.\nNaisha, however, told Maiev to forget about them, and flee to warn of his brother's insidious intentions. Maiev reluctantly left her followers behind, and Naisha was presumably killed in the cave-in.\nLegion.\nNaisha haunts the Tomb of Sargeras as a &lt;a href=\"banshee\"&gt;banshee&lt;/a&gt;, having died \"defending\" the tomb. Maiev asks &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to release her from torment, and states that she has found the rest she once earned when they put her ghost down."}

She also assisted Dezco in a ceremony to honor his wife's passing, braiding a lock of Leza's hair into his mane.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Chi%20Ji\"&gt;Chi Ji&lt;/a&gt; chooses one of the twins to begin a new life with the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Lotus\"&gt;Golden Lotus&lt;/a&gt;, Dezco decides to instead return with his sons to &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt;, and places Nala in charge of the shrine in his (permanent) absence, considering her a born leader. Although concerned, Nala ultimately accepts Dezco's decision, helping him to prepare for the journey. However, when one of the twins is killed in a &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; attack, Dezco decides to surrender the surviving twin to the Golden Lotus, returning to the shrine and reassuming his position.\nSiege of Orgrimmar.\nAfter the defilement of the Vale, Nala along with Dezco moved before the Shrine to aid the Golden Lotus Warriors."}

The largest hatchling fiercely resisted, and when Lei Shen visited the handling pens, he laughed mightily at the charred mogu that lined the walls. He took the hatchling for his own, and for its obedience, granted it power over the storms and the sky. For thousands of years following the death of the Thunder King, Nalak has guarded the walls of his hidden citadel, awaiting his return.\"\nStrategy.\nNalak only requires one tank. Those afflicted with Lightning Tether will take more damage the further they are away from Nalak and should move closer to the boss to avoid large amounts of damage. Static Shield will periodically hurt the DPS or tank and must be healed through. When the boss afflicts players with Stormcloud, any players around them will receive damage from the lightning. The raid should be spread out to minimize damage from Stormcloud. Arc Nova is Nalak's strongest move and will kill anyone in close proximity. The graphic for the spell is an easily noticeable circle of lightning underneath Nalak and players should have ample time to get away. \nNotes.\nThe term Nalak means something in either the &lt;a href=\"Titan%20%28language%29\"&gt;Titan tongue&lt;/a&gt; or Mogu language, probably \"Serpent.\"\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;\nTrivia.\nNalak is voiced by &lt;a href=\"Chris%20Metzen\"&gt;Chris Metzen&lt;/a&gt;."}

He did not know of the Council, nor of Ethylar's, Rohar's, and Aertin's connection to it.\nSunstrider?\nWhile never explicitly called Sunstrider, Nallorath is referred to as a \"royal\" and may be a part of the &lt;a href=\"Sunstrider%20dynasty\"&gt;Sunstrider dynasty&lt;/a&gt;. The established timeline suggests Nallorath held the title of prince during the time Anasterian was reigning as king (Anasterian ruled &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; for at least 2,800 years, and Nallorath held the title of prince 2,600 years before the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;), and refers to his \"father's court\" at one point, implying he was the king's son rather than brother. However, &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas\"&gt;Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt; is explicitly referred to as Anasterian's only son, so what relation Nallorath had to the king is unknown.\nConsidering his lack of reference, it is likely he had perished by the time Kael'thas was confirmed to be the last of the royal bloodline after the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;. Had Nallorath survived to see the First War, he would have been almost of an age with the elderly Anasterian."}

He was sent off with a great feast, and the epic \"Song of Talonclaw\" was sung to bring him success in his quest. All felt sure he would restore peace and calm to the land.\nHowever, weeks passed without any word of Nalmus. A search party was dispatched, but they could find no trace of Nalmus or his spear, and several party members were lost to the mysterious beast that prowled the mists.

He is one of the four animal bosses in the &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"instance\"&gt;instance&lt;/a&gt;. He guards the cage containing the troll male, &lt;a href=\"Tanzar\"&gt;Tanzar&lt;/a&gt; as part of the &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman%20Timed%20Event\"&gt;Zul'Aman Timed Event&lt;/a&gt;.\nTrash.\nWhen the raid first comes down the opening stairs and around the corner south towards Nalorakk, he is visible standing on a ledge with Troll guards. As the raid moves to Nalorakk to engage him, he will send the guards around him against the raid and retreat to a further platform. He will send a total of four waves, and retreat three times. This behavior is scripted, thus it's hard to get out of combat other than killing the mobs quickly. The script resets only when every raid member is either out of the instance or dead.\nThe four waves get increasingly difficult. The first two consist of Trolls, three in the first and four in the second wave. These trolls are some combination of &lt;a href=\"Amani%27shi%20Warrior\"&gt;Amani'shi Warrior&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Amani%27shi%20Axe%20Thrower\"&gt;Amani'shi Axe Thrower&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Amani%27shi%20Medicine%20Man\"&gt;Amani'shi Medicine Man&lt;/a&gt;. The 3rd wave consists of two &lt;a href=\"Amani%27shi%20Warbringer\"&gt;Amani'shi Warbringer&lt;/a&gt;, the fourth is two &lt;a href=\"Amani%27shi%20Warbringer\"&gt;Amani'shi Warbringer&lt;/a&gt; and two Trolls.\nOn the last wave, the trolls flanking the Warbringers can be crowd controlled (&lt;a href=\"Polymorph\"&gt;Polymorph&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Freezing%20Trap\"&gt;Freezing Trap&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fear\"&gt;Fear&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Mind%20Control\"&gt;Mind Control&lt;/a&gt;). The Warbringers each need their own tank and should be tanked away from one another to avoid their Furious Roar, which increases damage taken by 25% and stacks up to 200%. They also have an enrage ability that increases each other's attack speed by 30%. Both these effects can be avoided by keeping them far enough apart. At low health (20-25%), the trolls will dismount their bears. After dismounting, mount and rider become vulnerable to crowd control.\nAbilities.\nTroll Form\nBear Form\nStrategy.\nThe fight is primarily a healing/tanking check whose main challenges are handling the brutal swipe, keeping tanks topped off during silences, and tank transitioning correctly to avoid Mangled bleeds on a single tank.\nNalorakk alternates between his troll form and his bear form. Two tanks should be used, one for each of Nalorakk's forms. Each tank must taunt Nalorakk off of the previous tank as soon as he switches forms, so that one tank stacks &lt;a href=\"Mangle\"&gt;Mangle&lt;/a&gt; debuffs and the other has the bleed effects. Taunt needs to be timed precisely, as even a single debuff on the bear form tank can result in a dead tank (during a silence for example).\nBoth tanks should stand in front of Nalorakk during troll phase so that his Brutal Swipe cleave is split between both. The primary tank for the bear phase can stand slightly closer to ensure the cleave is split. An unsplit Brutal Swipe on a single target normally kills it.\nNalorakk does not reset aggro when he transforms, so DPS can continue through transitions. \nHealers should focus on endurance for this longer fight. Heals over time (HoTs) are important throughout the fight and especially during Bear Form, when the Deafening Roar silences the raid for 2 seconds. Fast heals immediately after the roar can also help prevent tank death. It works well to assign two healers to Nalorakk's current tank and an off-healer to top-off a wounded or bleeding previous tank as well as heal raid members who have just been Surged. A full stack of &lt;a href=\"HoT\"&gt;HoT&lt;/a&gt;s greatly decreases the pain of silence (even HoTs of a feral druid).\nQuotes.\nWaves Before Nalorakk\nOn first sighting:\nSacrifice timer:\n1st stair:\n2nd stair:\nBoss' platform:\nAggro:\nCharges a player:\nBear form:\nTroll form:\nKilling a player:\nDeath:\nLoot.\nFor the timed event loot, see the &lt;a href=\"Zul%2527Aman_timed_event%23Loot\"&gt;Zul'Aman timed event&lt;/a&gt; article."}

In bear form he attacks the tank with two different bleed effects, Rend Flesh and Lacerating Slash. Nalorakk also lets loose with a Deafening Roar to briefly silence his enemies.\nStrategy.\nWhile in troll form, Nalorakk will periodically charge the player furthest away from him, dealing moderate damage and leaving a +500% damage taken debuff (Surge). Nalorakk casts Surge three times in each troll phase, and as most players will not be able to survive the ability while affected by its debuff, three different players will need to take turns being the furthest away from Nalorakk.\nAfter having cast Surge thrice, Nalorakk transforms into a bear. While in bear form, he inflicts a bleed effect on the tank, dealing heavy damage over a long period of time, and periodically silences the group."}

Most of his &lt;a href=\"Disciples%20of%20Naralex\"&gt;disciples&lt;/a&gt; were driven insane and formed the &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Fang\"&gt;Druids of the Fang&lt;/a&gt;. He was eventually saved by a group of &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s and one of his last disciples, &lt;a href=\"Muyoh\"&gt;Muyoh&lt;/a&gt;. Following the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, a massive &lt;a href=\"Overgrowth\"&gt;Overgrowth&lt;/a&gt; started spreading in the &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Barrens\"&gt;Southern Barrens&lt;/a&gt; as a result of Naralex's actions, and he now works to stop the influence of the Nightmare before the Overgrowth chokes out all-natural life in the area.\nBackground.\nCurse of the Worgen.\nNaralex was present for the founding of the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt;. He advocated the complete destruction of the &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Scythe\"&gt;Druids of the Scythe&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nNaralex discovered the existence of the &lt;a href=\"Wailing%20Caverns\"&gt;Wailing Caverns&lt;/a&gt; and intended to use the Caverns to bring back the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt;' beauty and lushness, through connecting to the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;. Accompanied by the &lt;a href=\"Disciples%20of%20Naralex\"&gt;Disciples of Naralex&lt;/a&gt;, he managed to bring forth enough water from deep below to create a handful of small oases. However, once Naralex connected with the Emerald Dream, something went wrong and the Wailing Caverns changed into a monstrous environment, corrupting the waters and creatures within. His companions were corrupted into the &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Fang\"&gt;Druids of the Fang&lt;/a&gt;, evil versions of themselves with no desire other than to spread the darkness. Trapped in the Emerald Dream, Naralex slept in the deeps of the Wailing Caverns, moving back and forth between madness and sanity. He was finally rescued by a party of &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s and one of his last disciples, &lt;a href=\"Muyoh\"&gt;Muyoh&lt;/a&gt;.\nStormrage.\nWhile his mind was again more or less whole, Naralex could recall nothing of what had taken him and the others. As for the Barrens, although they were at present quiet, on the orders of &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt; neither he nor any other druids had as of yet returned there. The archdruid saw no point in risking lives and energies for a place that had been made into a desert. As Fandral saw it, even arid places had their place in the purpose of Azeroth.\nAt the start of the &lt;a href=\"War%20Against%20the%20Nightmare\"&gt;War Against the Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;, Naralex worked with many other druids to heal &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;, unknowingly corrupting it even further. It is revealed that Naralex is a friend of &lt;a href=\"Hamuul%20Runetotem\"&gt;Hamuul Runetotem&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Broll%20Bearmantle\"&gt;Broll Bearmantle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Elerethe%20Renferal\"&gt;Elerethe Renferal&lt;/a&gt;. Naralex discovered the truth about Fandral's corruption and told it to Hamuul. Together they ventured to Darnassus to warn &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt;, though the trio was silenced by traitorous Fandral. The trio was later found by &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; who released them, though Naralex was far more wounded than Shandris and Broll.\nAfter the War against the Nightmare was over, he was healed from his wounds and one of many to witness the wedding of &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; and Malfurion.\nCataclysm.\nDuring the events of &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, his work paid off, and areas of the Barrens became lush and green. By the time of the Cataclysm, he only recently arrived in the Barrens, and &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s helped him seal off the Nightmare corruption in the &lt;a href=\"Overgrowth\"&gt;Overgrowth&lt;/a&gt;, an event that the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspect\"&gt;Dragon Aspect&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt; learned about.\nLegion.\nThe Cenarion Circle planned to move the bulk of its forces to the &lt;a href=\"Dreamgrove\"&gt;Dreamgrove&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Val%27sharah\"&gt;Val'sharah&lt;/a&gt;, the ancient forest where &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt; taught Malfurion, in order to combat the return of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. After locating Naralex, Hamuul, Malfurion, &lt;a href=\"Zen%27tabra\"&gt;Zen'tabra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Remulos\"&gt;Remulos&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;druid hero&lt;/a&gt; opened a portal to the Emerald Dream at the &lt;a href=\"Stormrage%20Barrow%20Dens\"&gt;Stormrage Barrow Dens&lt;/a&gt;, allowing their forces to move swiftly over vast distances.\nAt the Dreamgrove, Naralex received word from &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; that she was authorizing the release of the Scythe of Elune. He directed the new &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Archdruid&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Valorn%20Stillbough\"&gt;Valorn Stillbough&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Duskwood\"&gt;Duskwood&lt;/a&gt;.

Afterward, he became a champion for the Archdruid and the druidic order, and one of his first missions was to go to the roots of &lt;a href=\"Shaladrassil\"&gt;Shaladrassil&lt;/a&gt; in Val'sharah, and bring back samples to study, which he also conducted. He was later part of the druids that communed with &lt;a href=\"Malorne\"&gt;Malorne&lt;/a&gt; beneath &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Hyjal\"&gt;Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;.\nNaralex participated in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Exodar\"&gt;Battle for the Exodar&lt;/a&gt; battling against &lt;a href=\"High%20General%20Rakeesh\"&gt;High General Rakeesh&lt;/a&gt;, alongside &lt;a href=\"Zen%27tabra\"&gt;Zen'tabra&lt;/a&gt;.\nDragonflight.\nHe traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;, where he can be found at &lt;a href=\"Algeth%27ar%20Academy\"&gt;Algeth'ar Academy&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Thaldraszus\"&gt;Thaldraszus&lt;/a&gt;.

It is also the first encounter since &lt;a href=\"Ulduar%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt; back in &lt;a href=\"patch%203.1\"&gt;patch 3.1&lt;/a&gt; to have what is now referred to as an &lt;a href=\"elite%20mode\"&gt;elite mode&lt;/a&gt;, which is distinct from &lt;a href=\"Heroic%20mode\"&gt;Heroic mode&lt;/a&gt; as it uses boss mechanics to make the encounter more difficult rather than the raid leader changing modes in the UI.\nBackground.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"When the Sha of Fear invaded the Terrace of Endless Spring, three venerated jinyu protectors were corrupted, and they betrayed the other mortal sentinels, slaying them all. The twisted guardians have now turned their attention to any intruders who might interrupt the sha's attack on the area's last defenses.\"\nSpells and abilities.\n&lt;a href=\"Minion%20of%20Fear\"&gt;Minions of Fear&lt;/a&gt;.\nMinions of Fear pour from the Terrace of Endless Spring, pursuing the Protector with the lowest remaining health.\nStrategy.\nThis is a &lt;a href=\"council%20encounter\"&gt;council encounter&lt;/a&gt;, where the order of the kills reflects the difficulty level and the abilities the three protectors use. The easiest method is to kill Protector Kaolan first, then Elder Regail second, then Elder Asani last. Note that with Sha Corruption, using &lt;a href=\"area%20of%20effect\"&gt;area of effect&lt;/a&gt; abilities to do damage to all three bosses is ill-advised, because as soon as one boss dies, the remaining bosses are healed to full health. To earn &lt;a href=\"elite%20mode\"&gt;elite mode&lt;/a&gt; loot, kill Protector Kaolan last.\nPhase one.\nAt the beginning of the encounter, all bosses have an ability or two, and gain abilities upon the death of another boss. Kaolan uses Touch of Sha to do some &lt;a href=\"damage%20over%20time\"&gt;damage over time&lt;/a&gt; to a random unit for the rest of the encounter. Regail casts Lightning Bolt for a decent amount of damage, but is &lt;a href=\"interrupt\"&gt;interrupt&lt;/a&gt;ible, and summons Lightning Prisons that do damage to grouped players. Asani casts Water Bolts that do splash damage around his target and summons Cleansing Waters pools to heal the protectors. Cleansing Waters must be &lt;a href=\"dispel\"&gt;dispel&lt;/a&gt;led instantly, or it will heal for a decent proportion of the protector's health.\nStart by focusing on Kaolan, as the Touch of Sha debuff does not have a set duration and will last the rest of the encounter unless he is killed early. Spread out to avoid splash damage from Lightning Prison and Water Bolts. Tanks should consider moving the current target when Asani casts Cleansing Waters, and dispellers should all try to remove the buff from the current target as well. Remember that damage dealt to the other bosses is erased by the full heal given on the death of another.\nPhase two.\nOnce the first boss is down, the remaining two retain their first-phase abilities, but gain new abilities. Kaolan casts Defiled Ground, which drops a void zone on the ground underneath a player for the rest of the fight. Regail starts casting Lightning Storm on a timer, which calls down pools of lightning in concentric rings 20 yards wide from his position with a little overlap. Asani casts Corrupted Waters, summoning a globe of water that grants the protectors 100% melee and casting speed until it is destroyed.\nLightning Storm is the big raid-wiping ability in this phase, as players will have to move to dodge lightning strikes. Regail will root himself in place then start winding up a very long channel. Those in melee range will have to run 20 yards away to get out of the initial strike, then get back inside to avoid the second. Players at range will have to move on one side of a 20-yard wide ring (moving with the melee out to 25 yards to avoid the first strike or in to 35 yards to avoid the third). Asani starts summoning Corrupted Waters, which becomes the primary target and must be killed as quickly as possible before moving back to the boss. However, attackers should stand within 20 yards of the water globule, as when it is destroyed, they are Purified and gain +25% melee, ranged, and casting speed for 20 seconds. Kaolan will summon Defiled Ground void zones that will start limiting the available space unless some creative positioning is employed.\nPhase three.\nAfter the death of the second boss, the remaining boss is again healed to full health and gains one last ability. Kaolan will cast Expel Corruption beneath \"his\" position, dropping another void zone that lasts the rest of the encounter that deals damage to the entire raid. Regail and Asani both gain Overwhelming Corruption, which stacks a debuff dealing increasing Shadow damage to all players every three seconds for the rest of the encounter.\nThis turns into a &lt;a href=\"DPS%20race\"&gt;DPS race&lt;/a&gt;, and long-duration cooldowns (&lt;a href=\"Bloodlust\"&gt;Bloodlust&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Heroism\"&gt;Heroism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Time%20Warp\"&gt;Time Warp&lt;/a&gt;, etc...) should be used now. If Kaolan is the last protector up, his Expel Corruption ability means that players want to be as far as possible away from the void zones, as it does less damage the further away it is. Regail and Asani start stacking a debuff, acting as a soft enrage. Pull out all the stops and blow them away while dealing with their first- and second-phase abilities too.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;\nExternal links.\n \n "}

Millennia ago, the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s altered some of them into the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Aspects&lt;/a&gt; and their &lt;a href=\"order\"&gt;order&lt;/a&gt;ed &lt;a href=\"dragonflight\"&gt;dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;s, reshaping them both physically and ideologically. This new species is now simply known as &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;s. Some primal dragons shunned the gift of the titans and still roam the wilds of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;. Among the proto-dragons of Northrend, some were subjugated and used as mounts by mortal races such as the &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s.\nHistory.\nThe proto-dragons descend from &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt;s who avoided being imprisoned in the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Plane\"&gt;Elemental Plane&lt;/a&gt; and instead remained on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, where some of them gradually transformed into creatures of flesh and blood. More specifically, &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; recently uncovered evidence, corroborated by reports from &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"Deepholm\"&gt;Deepholm&lt;/a&gt;, that proto-dragons may have origins in elemental drakes such as &lt;a href=\"stone%20dragon\"&gt;stone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"storm%20dragon\"&gt;storm drakes&lt;/a&gt;. The inhabitants of Deepholm, the &lt;a href=\"Skywall\"&gt;Skywall&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Firelands\"&gt;Firelands&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Abyssal%20Maw\"&gt;Abyssal Maw&lt;/a&gt; are less than talkative on these matters, however, and most of them were not around when the elemental prisons were created.\n&lt;a href=\"Galakrond\"&gt;Galakrond&lt;/a&gt;, a massive proto-dragon, is known as the \"progenitor of dragonkind\" and long ago resorted to cannibalism. This act of consuming other proto-dragons gave Galakrond unbelievable strength and increased his size, but horribly mutated his body as well. His breath reanimated the dead proto-dragons around him into a form of undeath. It is said that from Galakrond the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s created the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspect\"&gt;Aspects&lt;/a&gt;, but this is a &lt;a href=\"Flavor%20lore\"&gt;rumor&lt;/a&gt; the Aspects actively encouraged so as to keep the truth about Galakrond's power a secret from the dragonflights.\nThe truth of the connection between Galakrond and the Aspects is that the five proto-dragons who would become the Aspects were united by &lt;a href=\"Tyr\"&gt;Tyr&lt;/a&gt; and worked together to defeat Galakrond. Afterward, in recognition of their power when working together, the titans blessed those five proto-dragons and transformed them into the Aspects, the first dragons. However, some proto-dragons rejected the order of the titans, and infused themselves with elemental energy to become the &lt;a href=\"Primal%20Incarnates\"&gt;Primal Incarnates&lt;/a&gt; and rebel against the Dragon Aspects.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; raised some ancient proto-dragons into undeath to become members of the &lt;a href=\"Frostbrood\"&gt;Frostbrood&lt;/a&gt;, but only those that were powerful members of long-forgotten draconic flights.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Peaks\"&gt;Storm Peaks&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Hyldnir\"&gt;Hyldnir&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"frost%20vrykul\"&gt;frost vrykul&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Valkyrion\"&gt;Valkyrion&lt;/a&gt; served the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; by capturing proto-drakes and their eggs, in order to infect them with the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;Plague of Undeath&lt;/a&gt; through the &lt;a href=\"Blighted%20Pool\"&gt;Blighted Pool&lt;/a&gt;, waters filled with corruption and disease. The infected creatures became their mounts and nest all around in the mountains above their village. These &lt;a href=\"plagued%20proto-drake\"&gt;plagued proto-drake&lt;/a&gt;s were also used as mounts by the vrykul of &lt;a href=\"Valkyrion\"&gt;Valkyrion&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt;, and were later targeted by &lt;a href=\"Gretta%20the%20Arbiter\"&gt;Gretta the Arbiter&lt;/a&gt; who ordered &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to destroy the plagued eggs.\nCataclysm.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale%20war\"&gt;Ashenvale war&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; brought some proto-drakes from Northrend to invade &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; managed to domesticate them by holding their young hostage. \nMists of Pandaria.\nFollowing the fall of &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt; began subverting proto-drakes for the needs of the &lt;a href=\"True%20Horde\"&gt;True Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"war%20in%20Draenor\"&gt;war in Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Zaela\"&gt;Warlord Zaela&lt;/a&gt; and her Dragonmaw continued to use proto-drakes, and they brought &lt;a href=\"Ragewing%20the%20Untamed\"&gt;Ragewing the Untamed&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Highlands\"&gt;Twilight Highlands&lt;/a&gt;.\nConsequently, troops were sent to recover proto-drake eggs from &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Zaela\"&gt;Warlord Zaela&lt;/a&gt;'s army in &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Upper Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;, as many &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s feared that the proto-drake populations were plummeting.\nDragonflight.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Primalists\"&gt;Primalists&lt;/a&gt; who rebelled against the Aspects long ago return and free their leaders, the Primal Incarnates, from their prisons.\nProto-drakes in Dragon Isles are described as being \"...naturally flame resistant, stronger than steel, and don't lose flexibility in the process [of crafting][sic].\" Proto drake whelps are further described as having smaller scales that \"should be more pliable until we've mastered...techniques with [them].\"\nWithin &lt;a href=\"Tyr\"&gt;Tyr&lt;/a&gt;'s hidden vault, Tyr had made note that proto-dragons have a unusual ability to adapt to all variations of the elements changing them uniquely in both physical appearance and utilization of abilities.\nDescription.\nProto-drakes are generally bestial and display none of the great intelligence and wisdom of true dragons, though several ancient proto-dragons including those that would later become the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt; proved otherwise when they fought alongside &lt;a href=\"Tyr\"&gt;Tyr&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"Galakrond\"&gt;Galakrond&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; noted in his visions of the past that this was extremely odd.\nProto-dragon whelps grow at an incredible rate and can devour nearly twice their weight in raw meat per day. Some proto-dragons have a wide array of strengths and abilities, with examples including incredible fortitude, massive size or the ability to unknowingly tap into latent elemental energies in order to breathe fire or frost at their enemies.\nThe &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; frequently use proto-dragons as flying mounts in the &lt;a href=\"Howling%20Fjord\"&gt;Howling Fjord&lt;/a&gt; and other parts of Northrend, and could be seen doing so in their constant siege of &lt;a href=\"Valgarde\"&gt;Valgarde&lt;/a&gt;. Wild proto-drakes can be seen in areas such as &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Peaks\"&gt;Storm Peaks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sholazar%20Basin\"&gt;Sholazar Basin&lt;/a&gt;. Bronze proto-drakes were used as mounts by the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt; after they were discovered in the &lt;a href=\"Bronze%20Dragonshrine\"&gt;Bronze Dragonshrine&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"bronze%20dragonflight\"&gt;bronze dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Time-Lost%20Proto%20Drake\"&gt;Time-Lost Proto Drake&lt;/a&gt; is famous for being extremely hard to catch.\n&lt;a href=\"Reins%20of%20the%20Black%20Proto-Drake\"&gt;Black proto-drakes&lt;/a&gt; were bred specifically to honor those &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;heroes&lt;/a&gt; who showed exceptional resilience and fortitude facing the dangers in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Reins%20of%20the%20Plagued%20Proto-Drake\"&gt;plagued proto-drakes&lt;/a&gt; to honor those who showed significant courage and persistence.\nTypes.\nTypes on the Dragon Isles.\nOn the Dragon Isles there are a variety of proto-dragons infused with elements, the most powerful of which are the &lt;a href=\"Primal%20Incarnates\"&gt;Primal Incarnates&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs a flying mount.\nSeveral proto-drake mounts are available as rewards for various &lt;a href=\"achievements\"&gt;achievements&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a few that drop from mobs and bosses:"}

The &lt;a href=\"Admiral%20Proudmoore%27s%20Orders\"&gt;Admiral Proudmoore's Orders&lt;/a&gt; item said that Daelin intended to lead the first landing upon the shores of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, and then have his right hand &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20Benedict\"&gt;Lieutenant Benedict&lt;/a&gt; re-take Tiragarde Keep in case of the Lord Admiral's failure, but without precising if Tiragarde was his main base or the place where he made his last stand. The only thing known is that Tiragarde fell when the orcs repelled the human aggression.\nTidefury Cove is an actual location in &lt;a href=\"Dustwallow%20Marsh\"&gt;Dustwallow Marsh&lt;/a&gt; but is little more than a collection of sandbanks south of &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore Isle&lt;/a&gt;, thus making it seemingly inappropriate for a place to build a fortress at and then launch a land assault on Durotar.\n\"World of Warcraft\" also introduced &lt;a href=\"Northwatch%20Hold\"&gt;Northwatch Hold&lt;/a&gt;, a seemingly unrelated &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Guard\"&gt;Theramore Guard&lt;/a&gt;-affiliated keep in the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt;. However, the novel \"&lt;a href=\"Cycle%20of%20Hatred\"&gt;Cycle of Hatred&lt;/a&gt;\" later stated that Northwatch Hold was actually Admiral Proudmoore's stronghold during the conflict.\nNorthwatch Hold was presumably preferred to Tiragarde for its location outside of Theramore territory and near the orcish homelands, making it the most narratively fitting location for Proudmoore's base, leaving Tiragarde Keep as simply another Kul Tiran base and Tidefury Cove's role in the invasion being retconned entirely."}

The facility is central to the proud naval tradition of both &lt;a href=\"House%20Proudmoore\"&gt;House Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; and Kul Tiras, overseeing the instruction of its officer class.\nThe academy is very similar to a typical college campus, with facilities and lecture halls in which a garrison of &lt;a href=\"Proudmoore%20Cadet\"&gt;cadets&lt;/a&gt; receive constant training; students slacking off in the basement of the Proudmoore hedge maze, and a hidden &lt;a href=\"harbor\"&gt;harbor&lt;/a&gt; full of exotic booze also feature prominently.\nAlongside the cadets, the academy is also host to important figures from the Proudmoore military, a large company of Proudmoore &lt;a href=\"Academy%20Marine\"&gt;marines&lt;/a&gt;, and even powerful &lt;a href=\"tidesage\"&gt;tidesage&lt;/a&gt;s. The academy's importance has recently made it a target for the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, who have launched several attempts to breach its defenses.\nHistory.\nThe &lt;a href=\"dark%20ranger\"&gt;dark ranger&lt;/a&gt; known as &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Ranger%20Clea\"&gt;Clea&lt;/a&gt; infiltrated the city and stroked at the academy grounds during the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; agent would only eventually be overcome by the combined efforts of &lt;a href=\"Rear%20Admiral%20Hainsworth\"&gt;Rear Admiral Hainsworth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Faction%20Assault%20on%20Tiragarde%20Sound\"&gt;Faction Assault on Tiragarde Sound&lt;/a&gt;, Horde invaders led by &lt;a href=\"Siege%20Engineer%20Krackleboom\"&gt;Siege Engineer Krackleboom&lt;/a&gt; deployed war machines and other devices against the campus's defenses. Though they briefly occupied much of the grounds, the Horde were eventually confronted by Alliance forces sent to deal with the incursion, and help the academy's residents to prevail.\nLayout.\nThe grounds of the Proudmoore Academy are attached to those of &lt;a href=\"Proudmoore%20Keep\"&gt;Proudmoore Keep&lt;/a&gt;, and collectively form the southwestern portion of &lt;a href=\"Boralus\"&gt;Boralus&lt;/a&gt;. The academy opens onto the inner bay of &lt;a href=\"Tiragarde%20Sound\"&gt;Tiragarde Sound&lt;/a&gt; and has docking points along the waterfront. The position the academy occupies is also heavily fortified, complete with bunkers, &lt;a href=\"cannon\"&gt;cannon&lt;/a&gt;s, and sea walls.\nThree halls form the main part of the academy: &lt;a href=\"Erickson%20Hall\"&gt;Erickson Hall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Daelin%27s%20Hall\"&gt;Daelin's Hall&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Harbor%20Hall\"&gt;Harbor Hall&lt;/a&gt;. The latter is both the largest and serves as the main lecture hall on campus. To the south, an extensive training course sits along the water's edge, with facilities to test the various naval skills of the cadets. The &lt;a href=\"Admirality%20Office\"&gt;Admirality Office&lt;/a&gt; is also here."}

The battalion and fort are vital in protecting the &lt;a href=\"Eventide%20Delta\"&gt;Eventide Delta&lt;/a&gt; and its seawall, which has recently become the focus of a &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; assault. The Proudmoore Battalion has also become a part of the &lt;a href=\"Storm%27s%20Wake\"&gt;Storm's Wake&lt;/a&gt; faction, a collection of local groups fighting to protect Stormsong Valley from a multitude of threats.\nHistory.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiran%20civil%20war\"&gt;Kul Tiran civil war&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiran\"&gt;Kul Tiran&lt;/a&gt; fortress of &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Daelin\"&gt;Fort Daelin&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Stormsong%20Valley\"&gt;Stormsong Valley&lt;/a&gt;'s western coast suffered several attacks at the hands of the &lt;a href=\"Zeth%27jir\"&gt;Zeth'jir&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;. The Proudmoore Battalion garrisoning the fort fought hard to hold back the invaders and prevent them from breaching the nearby seawall. Should the naga have succeeded in destroying the wall, the ensuing flooding would allow them to push further into Stormsong Valley.\nThough the Battalion was pushed out of Fort Daelin's outer defenses, they firmly held the interior of the bastion. &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Kellam\"&gt;Commander Kellam&lt;/a&gt; also sent forces to &lt;a href=\"Seabreeze%20Village\"&gt;Seabreeze Village&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20Bauer\"&gt;Lieutenant Bauer&lt;/a&gt;, where the citizens were also being attacked, and dispatched &lt;a href=\"Squire%20Augustus%20III\"&gt;Squire Augustus III&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Brennadam\"&gt;Brennadam&lt;/a&gt; in search of reinforcements. An &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;emissary&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; would eventually arrive to aid in the defense, and with this help the Proudmoore Battalion began to push the naga back from the fort, while holding the line at Seabreeze Village. After rescuing stranded Battalion soldiers and thinning the Zeth'jir numbers, the Kul Tiran defenders were able to strike directly at the naga leaders.\nWith a &lt;a href=\"%3AZeth%27jir%20Channeling%20Rod\"&gt;:Zeth'jir Channeling Rod&lt;/a&gt;, they interrupted the ritual of &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Rash%27iss\"&gt;Lady Rash'iss&lt;/a&gt; as she attempted to breach the seawall. Despite this, &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt; herself summoned a &lt;a href=\"Pride%20of%20Azshara\"&gt;monster&lt;/a&gt; to attack the levee directly. Using &lt;a href=\"cannon\"&gt;cannon&lt;/a&gt;s and artillery, the Battalion troops were successful in vanquishing the foe just in time, protecting the dam and crippling the naga's plans.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"Faction%20Assault%20on%20Zuldazar\"&gt;Faction Assaults on Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt;, members of the Battalion protected Alliance supply caravans moving through &lt;a href=\"Predator%20Pass\"&gt;Predator Pass&lt;/a&gt;. At one point, several of these troops were mauled by the &lt;a href=\"dire%20troll\"&gt;dire troll&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Siegebreaker%20Vol%27gar\"&gt;Siegebreaker Vol'gar&lt;/a&gt;."}

After the extraction, Jaina used the ship to take herself and the Alliance &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;emissary&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Boralus\"&gt;Boralus&lt;/a&gt; in order to convince &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; to rejoin the Alliance. While on the trip to her homeland, Jaina had a nightmare about her father, him saying her mother would never forgive her and calling her a murderer. After reaching the city, it was left in the main canal of Boralus for a short time but was later moved to an unknown location shortly prior to the &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiran%20civil%20war\"&gt;events in Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter Jaina became &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Admiral\"&gt;Lord Admiral&lt;/a&gt;, she used the vessel as her flagship during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Dazar%27alor\"&gt;Battle of Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt;, and fought Horde champions on its main deck.\nAppearance.\nThe ship has a unique model although it differs considerably from its in-game appearance compared to the \"&lt;a href=\"Warbringers\"&gt;Warbringers&lt;/a&gt;\" cinematic which has four masts instead of three.\nThe in-game model is unique compared to the other Kul Tiran vessels. Most noticeably having a different design for its prow, which lacks the metal protection on the front and is not as angular. This seems to be to represent it as an older type of ship to those found in Kul Tiras during \"Battle for Azeroth\". It also has bits of algae or seaweed clinging to it in several places as part of its unique model and lacks the adornments on the sails that most Kul Tiran ships seem to have, being solid green instead. Despite its unique model, it lacks the &lt;a href=\"siren\"&gt;siren&lt;/a&gt; figurehead present in the cinematic and the animated short. The end of its bowsprit is adorned with a spear.\nIts cinematic appearance is a modified version of the other Kul Tiran ships."}

These might take the form of testing how long a &lt;a href=\"tank\"&gt;tank&lt;/a&gt; can protect an &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"healer%20%28role%29\"&gt;healer&lt;/a&gt; from a stream of oncoming enemies, or how much damage a &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt; can deal to targets while avoiding awareness and movement checks of increasing difficulty. The system is intended to be a fun way for players to practice some of the skills that are essential for group gameplay, and for expert players to demonstrate mastery and compete for positions atop leaderboards, similar to the &lt;a href=\"Challenge%20Mode\"&gt;Challenge Mode&lt;/a&gt; feature.\nThere are three types of challenge, Damage, Tank, and Healer, with each providing appropriate challenges. Each challenge can be tackled in Bronze, Silver, Gold or Endless mode, with each difficulty unlocked by defeating the previous one. Higher difficulties provide a stiffer challenge not only in terms of numbers but also in complexity, with more complicated sequences and combinations of enemies. Endless mode provides the player with a literally endless challenge, testing players to see how long they can withstand the onslaught.\nThe Proving Grounds become available at level 15, but only players at level 100 or higher will be allowed to progress beyond Bronze difficulty.\nGetting there.\nPlayers may enter the proving grounds by speaking with either &lt;a href=\"Trial%20Master%20Rotun\"&gt;Trial Master Rotun&lt;/a&gt; inside the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20White%20Tiger\"&gt;Temple of the White Tiger&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Kun-Lai%20Summit\"&gt;Kun-Lai Summit&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Warmaster%20Zog\"&gt;Warmaster Zog (Horde)&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20Thorn\"&gt;Lieutenant Thorn (Alliance)&lt;/a&gt; in your faction Garrison or with any class trainer.\nInside the scenario.\n&lt;a href=\"Trial%20Master%20Rotun\"&gt;Trial Master Rotun&lt;/a&gt; will start a trial, but before starting out, feel free to repair, change talents, and eat or drink using materials provided by &lt;a href=\"Furnisher%20Echoroot\"&gt;Furnisher Echoroot&lt;/a&gt;, and loot a &lt;a href=\"Healthstone\"&gt;Healthstone&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Nadaga%20Soulweaver\"&gt;Nadaga Soulweaver&lt;/a&gt;'s Soulwell.\nIn \"Warlords of Draenor\".\nAt the February 2014 press event, it was revealed that getting silver in a specific role would be one of the requirements to queue for a random Heroic at max level. Players will still be able to queue for normal dungeons regardless of Proving Grounds progression. &lt;a href=\"Ion%20Hazzikostas\"&gt;Ion Hazzikostas&lt;/a&gt; chimed in with more information:\nExpanding upon the above, it has been stated that in \"Warlords of Draenor\" the Proving Grounds will tell failing players what they did wrong, making it something of a teaching tool rather than simply a test. These improvements will likely not be present at the start of the expansion, but will be added as the expansion progresses.\nTrials.\nRotun offers a different family of trials for each role, one for damage-dealers, one for tanks, and one for healers. Each family has four ranks: bronze, silver, gold, and endless. To start higher-ranked trials, players must first beat lower-ranked trials of the same family.\nStarting any trial will reset all of the challenger's cooldowns and restore the challenger to full health and mana.\nDamage.\nNo friendly NPCs are involved in the damage trials.\nBasic Damage (Bronze).\nThe bronze Basic damage trial consists of five waves, and each wave must be defeated before time expires.

It is the major headquarters of the Scourge in &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, on the other side of the hills from the Scourge capital of &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Eastern Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;. At its center is the &lt;a href=\"Tower%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Tower of the Damned&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"Dar%27Khan%20Drathir\"&gt;Dar'Khan Drathir&lt;/a&gt; - the traitor who allowed &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; into Quel'Thalas - resides with the other leaders of the Scourge in the area.\nDeatholme is the largest Scourge outpost in the Eastern Kingdoms outside of the greater Plaguelands, and it appears to have several temples, &lt;a href=\"ziggurat\"&gt;ziggurat&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"slaughterhouse\"&gt;slaughterhouse&lt;/a&gt;s. The variety of enemies in the area include undead nerubians, banshees, wraiths, and human necromancers with their skeletal minions. Dar'Khan rules this odd assortment from the Tower of the Damned, along with his undead lieutenants - &lt;a href=\"Mirdoran%20the%20Fallen\"&gt;Mirdoran the Fallen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Borgoth%20the%20Bloodletter\"&gt;Borgoth the Bloodletter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jurion%20the%20Deceiver\"&gt;Jurion the Deceiver&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Masophet%20the%20Black\"&gt;Masophet the Black&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; citadel was constructed atop the withered roots of &lt;a href=\"Thas%27alah\"&gt;Thas'alah&lt;/a&gt;, the mother tree of the &lt;a href=\"Eversong%20Woods\"&gt;Eversong Woods&lt;/a&gt; which was cut down by the Scourge. &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; named the place Deatholme, and the resurrected &lt;a href=\"Dar%27Khan%20Drathir\"&gt;Dar'Khan Drathir&lt;/a&gt; began governing it. The &lt;a href=\"banshee\"&gt;banshee&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; overheard Arthas speaking about Deatholme and Dar'Khan, and when he returned from &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, his power waning, she contemplated Dar'Khan in Deatholme would have her body. As an undead, she and her &lt;a href=\"dark%20ranger\"&gt;dark ranger&lt;/a&gt;s entered the Scourge citadel, and Sylvanas found her body there.\nApproximately five years later, Priestess Liadrin scouted the area near Deatholme, watching the Scourge movement. Hoping to kill Dar'Khan outside its walls, she noticed that the undead were actually flowing inside the Scourge citadel.\n&lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knight%20Dawnstar\"&gt;Blood Knight Dawnstar&lt;/a&gt; once led a daring but ultimately unsuccessful assault against the undead base that ended in his demise. The Scourge has since grown bolder and took several Thalassian prisoners, including &lt;a href=\"Apprentice%20Varnis\"&gt;Apprentice Varnis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ranger%20Vedoran\"&gt;Ranger Vedoran&lt;/a&gt; and their ally &lt;a href=\"Apothecary%20Enith\"&gt;Apothecary Enith&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt some point, &lt;a href=\"Ashra%20Valandril\"&gt;Ashra Valandril&lt;/a&gt; fought at its gates to avenge a fallen comrade's honor.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;war against the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"San%27layn\"&gt;San'layn&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Vorath\"&gt;Vorath&lt;/a&gt; amassed a large number of Scourge under his command. They marched through the &lt;a href=\"Dead%20Scar\"&gt;Dead Scar&lt;/a&gt; and attacked &lt;a href=\"Tranquillien\"&gt;Tranquillien&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;sin'dorei&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt; and her &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knights\"&gt;Blood Knights&lt;/a&gt;, retaliated and led a counteroffensive against Deatholme. The Blood Knights and a &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;blood elf hero&lt;/a&gt; charged at Vorath inside Deathholme, successfully repelled his magics, and managed to kill the san'layn for good.\nMobs.\n&lt;a href=\"Deatholme%20Acolyte\"&gt;Deatholme Acolyte&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Deatholme%20Darkmage\"&gt;Deatholme Darkmage&lt;/a&gt;s can also be found outside of the base.\nSpeculation.\nIt was sometimes said that Arthas raised &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;a href=\"banshee\"&gt;banshee&lt;/a&gt; atop an altar inside a dark temple he had created in Quel'Thalas during the Scourge invasion (in most sources, he raised her on the same spot where he killed her, outside of &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;). This temple was probably Deatholme, since that's where Sylvanas' body was kept."}
