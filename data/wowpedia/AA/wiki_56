It was the most important settlement in the area before its destruction during the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, serving as the main &lt;a href=\"Harbor\"&gt;port&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; in northern &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. Since the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Auberdine\"&gt;Ruins of Auberdine&lt;/a&gt; have been heavily contested by the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; and the elves.\nDescription.\nAuberdine lied on the shores of the &lt;a href=\"Veiled%20Sea\"&gt;Veiled Sea&lt;/a&gt; within the region of Darkshore. The closeness of the sea produced a damp climate, with a seemingly omnipresent cover of storm clouds. The town was surrounded by hills and pine forests.\nAuberdine featured typical &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elven&lt;/a&gt; architecture \u2013 low-slung, arched, wooden buildings. It had stone and earthen streets, the paths and bridges illuminated by lamps. The town had both residential and commercial areas. It only had a few public gathering places, these included the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Haven%20Tavern\"&gt;Last Haven Tavern&lt;/a&gt;, another inn, the town square and the &lt;a href=\"hunter%27s%20hall\"&gt;hunter's hall&lt;/a&gt;. Auberdine also had a prominent port, with both passenger and cargo ships from the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; calling here. The port had its own, unique &lt;a href=\"lighthouse\"&gt;lighthouse&lt;/a&gt; of night elven design.\nThe houses in the town had wooden floors and furniture typical of elven architecture. A domicile visited by &lt;a href=\"Broll%20Bearmantle\"&gt;Broll Bearmantle&lt;/a&gt; had the typical trappings of a night elven home, with plant life within. It had sleeping quarters, where the inhabitants could lay on woven mats.\nThe mainland location of the town, as well as its port, made it the prime location for night elves trading with the outside world. This produced a racially mixed population that included &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s and even &lt;a href=\"high%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt;. To help the outsiders, Auberdine was unusually well lit for a night elven settlement, and featured some bilingual signposts in both &lt;a href=\"Darnassian\"&gt;Darnassian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Common%20%28language%29\"&gt;Common&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe town was led by the elder &lt;a href=\"Thundris%20Windweaver\"&gt;Thundris Windweaver&lt;/a&gt;, who had stewardship of the day-to-day affairs of the townsfolk. He was supported by the &lt;a href=\"Auberdine%20Village%20Council\"&gt;Auberdine Village Council&lt;/a&gt;, who hired adventurers for a number of purposes. The defense was coordinated by the local &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt;, with Sentinel &lt;a href=\"Glynda%20Nal%27Shea\"&gt;Glynda Nal'Shea&lt;/a&gt; reporting directly to the council.\nAuberdine was generally looked down upon and shunned by the denizens of &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;, including Broll Bearmantle, who considered the people of Auberdine as nothing better than outcasts and misfits. The town had a garrison of Sentinels, but they separated themselves from the other townsfolk. The town even had some &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s, although it was considered to be a place not entirely conducive to druidic ways. The town was considered quiet by outsiders. &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt;, however, remembered Auberdine as a place of laughter.\nAt its peak, the town provided many services to its citizens. Apart from the port, it had its own &lt;a href=\"hippogryph\"&gt;hippogryph&lt;/a&gt; master, innkeeper, profession trainers and vendors. Dwarves had set up a small smithy in town. Fishing and crabbing was particularly popular in the area, braving the dangers of the coastline. &lt;a href=\"Murloc\"&gt;Murloc&lt;/a&gt;s, in particular, posed a grave problem to the fishing boats leaving the port. (In turn, the locals made armor of the scales stripped off of the murlocs' corpses.)\nHistory.\nDuring the times of the &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Empire\"&gt;Kaldorei Empire&lt;/a&gt;, the region currently known as Darkshore was further inland. It featured great cities such as &lt;a href=\"Ameth%27Aran\"&gt;Ameth'Aran&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bashal%27Aran\"&gt;Bashal'Aran&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lathar%27Lazal\"&gt;Lathar'Lazal&lt;/a&gt;. This all changed with the &lt;a href=\"Sundering\"&gt;Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, which reduced the area to ruins, and created a new coastline cutting through the region. After this, Darkshore remained generally uninhabited. Several attempts were made to settle the land \u2013 by night elves and others \u2013, however these had all failed. Auberdine was the only significant stronghold that managed to persist in the area.\nAuberdine has a long history as a port. A long time ago, a ship commanded by the elf &lt;a href=\"Shade%20of%20Elura\"&gt;Elura&lt;/a&gt; crashed on the rocks near the lighthouse, losing her shipment of &lt;a href=\"Elunite%20Ore\"&gt;Elunite Ore&lt;/a&gt;. In the past, Broll Bearmantle had visited the town, and Shandris Feathermoon was stationed here.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nAfter the night elves joined the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, Auberdine became their premier port in northern &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Bravery\"&gt;The Bravery&lt;/a&gt;\" provided transportation from here to &lt;a href=\"Menethil%20Harbor\"&gt;Menethil Harbor&lt;/a&gt;, while \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Moonspray\"&gt;The Moonspray&lt;/a&gt;\" worked as a ferry between Auberdine and &lt;a href=\"Rut%27theran%20Village\"&gt;Rut'theran Village&lt;/a&gt; at the foot of &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;. Sentinels from Auberdine provided security to \"The Bravery\" during its trips.\nThe town and its area were facing a number of threats. The &lt;a href=\"moonkin\"&gt;moonkin&lt;/a&gt; to the east were made hostile by the influence of a red crystal from the &lt;a href=\"Felwood\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Blackwood\"&gt;Blackwood&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt; to the south were corrupted by &lt;a href=\"Fel%20Moss\"&gt;Fel Moss&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Murloc\"&gt;Murloc&lt;/a&gt;s were active alongside the coastline, going as far as to sink ships. The village council hired adventurers to take care of these, and other problems.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nA new ship was added to the port \u2013 the \"&lt;a href=\"Elune%27s%20Blessing\"&gt;Elune's Blessing&lt;/a&gt;\", providing transportation to the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; homeland of &lt;a href=\"Azuremyst%20Isle\"&gt;Azuremyst Isle&lt;/a&gt;, calling at &lt;a href=\"Valaar%27s%20Berth\"&gt;Valaar's Berth&lt;/a&gt;. \nWrath of the Lich King.\n\"&lt;a href=\"The%20Bravery\"&gt;The Bravery&lt;/a&gt;\" was rerouted to the newly established harbor within &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;.\nStormrage.\nThe whole population of Auberdine succumbed to the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;, falling into a deep, unwaking nightmarish sleep. &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; and Broll Bearmantle visited the town, almost succumbing to the nightmare themselves. They were only saved by the intervention of &lt;a href=\"Lucan%20Foxblood\"&gt;Lucan Foxblood&lt;/a&gt;, who spirited them away to safety.\nCataclysm.\nAuberdine was hit by the great dragon &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; during his return to the surface from &lt;a href=\"Deepholm\"&gt;Deepholm&lt;/a&gt;. He engulfed the town in flames and caused a massive earthquake which damaged the whole region. Auberdine's port fell into the sea, and most of its buildings were wrecked. Many of the surviving inhabitants departed in the wake of the destruction, leaving the &lt;a href=\"ruins%20of%20Auberdine\"&gt;ruins of Auberdine&lt;/a&gt; behind.\nBecause of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, Auberdine lost its status as an &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; travel hub. \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Moonspray\"&gt;The Moonspray&lt;/a&gt;\" was suspended, and both the \"&lt;a href=\"Elune%27s%20Blessing\"&gt;Elune's Blessing&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Bravery\"&gt;The Bravery&lt;/a&gt;\" were rerouted to &lt;a href=\"Rut%27theran%20Village\"&gt;Rut'theran Village&lt;/a&gt;. The town lost its inn, flight master and almost all friendly inhabitants. The &lt;a href=\"moonwell\"&gt;moonwell&lt;/a&gt; and the forge, however, remain intact.\nTravel connections.\nBefore \"Cataclysm\", Auberdine had the following travel connections:\nTraveling.\nAuberdine used to be the port for night elves, having direct access to &lt;a href=\"Rut%27theran%20Village\"&gt;Rut'theran Village&lt;/a&gt;, and going to most of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;. However, after the Cataclysm the town was destroyed and Rut'theran Village took most of the port functions that were previously in Auberdine.\nBefore \"Cataclysm\", the following zones were reachable from Auberdine:\nIn the RPG.\nHistory.\nAuberdine had previously been damaged during the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Sundering&lt;/a&gt; and later wars. After the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the night elves who had been living in Darkshore began to focus their attention on rebuilding the town. Most of the town is made of new buildings, as the night elves cleared away the ruins they could not restore. The town had about 200 residents just after the Third War, mostly night elves, but has grew to about 5,500 residents in recent times. At some point &lt;a href=\"Darian%20Thunderhammer\"&gt;Darian Thunderhammer&lt;/a&gt; came here.\nDescription.\nAuberdine used to be the sole warm haven amid the desolate land of Darkshore. The oppressive weather and the creatures that lurk in the shadows make much of Darkshore inhospitable, but this thriving trading post was a safe place for heroes to restock and rest. \nWhile quite appealing, Auberdine offered a brutal contrast from the serenity that can be felt in &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;. Even the sun seems to be too shy to cast its rays upon the land, which seems to be kept cloaked in a dark and mysterious mist. The buildings in Auberdine were quite different from those found in Darnassus. Here, the stone was mostly replaced by wood, and every house had a gloomy look, as if a spell was cast upon the outpost.\nVisitors could stop at the &lt;a href=\"Fish%20Eye%20Tavern\"&gt;Fish Eye Tavern&lt;/a&gt; for a hot bite to eat, purchase supplies at &lt;a href=\"Tassik%27s%20Tradepost\"&gt;Tassik's Tradepost&lt;/a&gt;, or, if they had the knack for sailing, rent a skiff at &lt;a href=\"Syran%27s%20Boat%20House\"&gt;Syran's Boat House&lt;/a&gt;. Residents were quite outgoing for night elves and free with advice, whether offering tips on sailing or advising on travel through Darkshore. The residents' jovial demeanor was but a thin veneer covering a grim determination to protect their homes. There were few armed forces in a military sense, but local scouts and rangers served as a ready militia and were prepared to defend their quiet hamlet to the death."}

However, all changed following the &lt;a href=\"genocide%20of%20the%20draenei\"&gt;genocide of the draenei&lt;/a&gt; who led &lt;a href=\"Exarch%20Maladaar\"&gt;Exarch Maladaar&lt;/a&gt; to madness, leading him to ordain his death priests to begin practicing &lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;necromancy&lt;/a&gt; and bring back the dead to serve them.\nOn Azeroth, part of the organization is still present and active in the draenei society.\nHistory.\nThe Auchenai were a later addition to organizations under the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Exarchs\"&gt;Council of Exarchs&lt;/a&gt;, after &lt;a href=\"Exarch%20Maladaar\"&gt;Maladaar&lt;/a&gt; - at the time a member of the Sha'tari - discovered that &lt;a href=\"D%27ore\"&gt;D'ore&lt;/a&gt;'s remains had drifted deeper into a Void state, and that they were attracting the souls of draenei who died in the \"&lt;a href=\"Genedar\"&gt;Genedar&lt;/a&gt;\"'s crash, which allowed the living draenei to commune with their fallen brethren. As nothing like this had ever happened before in the history of eredar society, the Prophet &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt; immediately directed Maladaar and a group of Sha'tari to move D'ore's remains to a secluded place. They found a location on the outskirts of &lt;a href=\"Terokkar%20Forest\"&gt;Terokkar Forest&lt;/a&gt; that was a safe distance from all other civilizations, and then built an immense mausoleum to house the naaru that the draenei spirits were following. The site became known as &lt;a href=\"Auchindoun\"&gt;Auchindoun&lt;/a&gt;, \"a Home for the Honored Dead\", and Maladaar was named as the fifth exarch on the draenei council as the leader of an order called the Auchenai, responsible for communing with the draenei dead and protecting their souls from harm.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;ish &lt;a href=\"Genocide%20of%20the%20draenei\"&gt;campaign&lt;/a&gt; against their kin, the Auchenai fled into the tunnels of &lt;a href=\"Auchindoun\"&gt;Auchindoun&lt;/a&gt;. Many &lt;a href=\"vindicator\"&gt;vindicator&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Rangari\"&gt;Rangari&lt;/a&gt; joined them later with civilians who escaped &lt;a href=\"Shattrath\"&gt;Shattrath&lt;/a&gt;, seeking refuge from the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s onslaught and to protect their holiest site in Draenor, as they could not bear the thought of the orcs desecrating their ancestors or the naaru housed within. Exarch Maladaar organized the military forces and fortified the tomb city's catacombs, waiting for the inevitable attack. When &lt;a href=\"Teron%27gor\"&gt;Teron'gor&lt;/a&gt; and his followers stormed Auchindoun on the orders of &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;, they met fierce resistance from the tomb's defenders with their &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;-given abilities, while Maladaar and the Auchenai also received aid from Auchindoun's spirits, slaughtering many of the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt;'s agents.\nAs Maladaar and his forces closed in, Teron'gor called on his remaining allies to summon a powerful demon, but in their wild desperation they summoned an otherwordly elemental creature known as &lt;a href=\"Murmur\"&gt;Murmur&lt;/a&gt; who materialized within Auchindoun. The shockwave of its arrival ripped the earth asunder, killing many of the draenei and blasting apart the tomb city. Exarch Maladaar and a handful of his followers used their magics to shield themselves from the blast. Though they survived, they no longer had the numbers to resist the Shadow Council who overwhelmed the draenei and bound them in chains.\nBeyond the Dark Portal.\nThe Auchenai anchorite &lt;a href=\"Nemuraan\"&gt;Nemuraan&lt;/a&gt;, one of the survivors of the genocide who took refuge in the halls of Auchindoun with a group of surviving draenei, helped the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Expedition\"&gt;Alliance Expedition&lt;/a&gt; by guiding them inside the ruined mausoleum. Before the battle, he appealed the spirit of &lt;a href=\"Boulestraan%20the%20Blinding%20Light\"&gt;Boulestraan the Blinding Light&lt;/a&gt; alongside an army of spectral draenei warriors, in order to rescue &lt;a href=\"Kurdran%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Kurdran Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt; from the hands of the Horde. He revealed to &lt;a href=\"Danath%20Trollbane\"&gt;Danath Trollbane&lt;/a&gt; that only a handful of Auchenai remained in the grave-city and that they would stay in &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; as long as their dead lied there, for they would be tended.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nSadly, the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; energies emanating from &lt;a href=\"D%27ore\"&gt;D'ore&lt;/a&gt; turned mad this priory, they no longer believing that the dead should be left alone to rest. The Auchenai leader &lt;a href=\"Exarch%20Maladaar\"&gt;Exarch Maladaar&lt;/a&gt; has been driven mad by the loss of everyone and everything he had ever loved. His lunatic dedication to the preservation of their memory drove him to a mastery of the dark arts, Once he turned to necromancy, he created &lt;a href=\"Shirrak%20the%20Dead%20Watcher\"&gt;Shirrak the Dead Watcher&lt;/a&gt; to guard over the fallen draenei spirits who wander the Auchenai Crypts. Many unsavory experiments were then undertaken in the &lt;a href=\"Auchenai%20Crypts\"&gt;Auchenai Crypts&lt;/a&gt; in the pursuit of a greater understanding of the &lt;a href=\"Necromancy\"&gt;necromantic&lt;/a&gt; arts. Many spirits were tortured or destroyed therein.\nIn the month before the fall of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt;, a force of &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20clan\"&gt;Shadowmoon clan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"fel%20orc\"&gt;fel orc&lt;/a&gt;s led by &lt;a href=\"Grimbak%20Shadowrage\"&gt;Grimbak Shadowrage&lt;/a&gt; accompanied &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; when he ventured to Auchindoun to gather souls for a portal to &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;. All of the fel orcs, including Grimbak, were slain during the subsequent battle by the Auchenai defending the area.\nLater, &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Ra%27vaj\"&gt;Commander Ra'vaj&lt;/a&gt; and his soldiers came into conflict with the Auchenai and fought them for days in the &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Wastes\"&gt;Bone Wastes&lt;/a&gt;. As the souls from both camps were lifted and taken to parts unknown, the commander asks &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to burn the bodies of his soldiers and the Auchenai on the battlefield, then to keep occupied the Auchenai who continue to grow in number as his scouts get behind their lines. They discovered that the Auchenai were feeding the souls they steal to a &lt;a href=\"Auchenai%20Coffin\"&gt;coffin&lt;/a&gt;, that they have dragged out from the Auchenai Crypts, in order to resurrect the &lt;a href=\"Reanimated%20Exarch\"&gt;first exarch&lt;/a&gt; of the crypt inside to defeat the Sha'tar.\nHowever, their attempt was unsuccessful as the adventurers destroyed the coffin and the undead exarch.\nEventually, adventurers were sent by &lt;a href=\"Greatfather%20Aldrimus\"&gt;Greatfather Aldrimus&lt;/a&gt; to destroy Exarch Maladaar and his abominations, so that the spirits trapped in the Auchenai Crypts can finally rest in peace. After his death, the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"D%27ore\"&gt;D'ore&lt;/a&gt; appeared and redeemed the &lt;a href=\"ghost\"&gt;spirit&lt;/a&gt; of the Auchenai leader, which eventually appeared to &lt;a href=\"Greatfather%20Aldrimus\"&gt;Greatfather Aldrimus&lt;/a&gt;, kneeling in front of his master to thank him for releasing him from the dark ones' hold.\nCataclysm.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Tormented%20Soulpriest\"&gt;Tormented Soulpriest&lt;/a&gt; appeared in the &lt;a href=\"Auchenai%20Crypts\"&gt;Auchenai Crypts&lt;/a&gt;, furious that the Auchenai have turned their backs on everything they used to stand for, as they continue to raise the dead as unholy minions. She asked adventurers to put the spirits back to rest, and to massacre those responsible for raising them into undeath.\nLegion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, the Auchenai were still active in the ruined halls of Auchindoun. At the request of the naaru &lt;a href=\"Saa%27ra\"&gt;Saa'ra&lt;/a&gt;, in order to fill the &lt;a href=\"Spark%20of%20Light%20%28item%29\"&gt;Spark of Light (item)&lt;/a&gt; and reveal its full potential with pure Light, the Auchenai were attacked by the champions of the &lt;a href=\"Conclave\"&gt;Conclave&lt;/a&gt; who entered the halls and fought against &lt;a href=\"Idra%20the%20Crazed\"&gt;Idra the Crazed&lt;/a&gt; and some Auchenai zealots, and managed to get to the regenerating D'ore and its holy shrine.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Auchenai%20Ballista%20%28Ruins%20of%20Lordaeron%29\"&gt;Auchenai ballistae&lt;/a&gt; were present at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Battle for Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, indicating that part of the organization still exists as part of Azeroth's draenei society, and fought alongside the Alliance against the Horde.\nAbilities.\nEven before their fall into madness, the \"death priests\" were allowed to see the &lt;a href=\"Veil\"&gt;world of the dead&lt;/a&gt; after drinking a potion during a rite of initiation. Many did go mad from it, though.\nThey were able to summon their fallen kin using the Light, but this was later replaced by enslaving the soul with necromancy.\nThe death priest &lt;a href=\"Nemuraan\"&gt;Nemuraan&lt;/a&gt; showed &lt;a href=\"Danath%20Trollbane\"&gt;Danath Trollbane&lt;/a&gt; that he was able to use his magic to learn their &lt;a href=\"Common%20%28language%29\"&gt;language&lt;/a&gt; and speak it perfectly.\nLocations.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, their main base is the &lt;a href=\"Auchenai%20Crypts\"&gt;Auchenai Crypts&lt;/a&gt; in the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Auchindoun\"&gt;Auchindoun&lt;/a&gt;, where their leader, &lt;a href=\"Exarch%20Maladaar\"&gt;Exarch Maladaar&lt;/a&gt; resided. Others can be found in the &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Wastes\"&gt;Bone Wastes&lt;/a&gt; outside of Auchindoun, where they fight fierce battles against the soldiers of the &lt;a href=\"Sha%27tar\"&gt;Sha'tar&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Lower%20City\"&gt;Lower City&lt;/a&gt; of Shattrath.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, the part of the organization that still exists in the draenei society is most certainly based in the \"&lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt;\" with the rest of their people."}

D'ore perished in the collision that brought &lt;a href=\"Oshu%27gun\"&gt;Oshu'gun&lt;/a&gt; (and the draenei) to &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;. In death, D'ore entered its void stage. The dark energies exuded by this phenomenon resulted, directly or indirectly, in the evils that have since befallen the crypts and indeed, all of Auchindoun. It is a wing of the &lt;a href=\"Auchindoun\"&gt;Auchindoun&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"instance\"&gt;instance&lt;/a&gt;. Its entrance can be found to the west of the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Observance\"&gt;Ring of Observance&lt;/a&gt;.\nKilling the mobs in Auchenai Crypts yields reputation gains for &lt;a href=\"Lower%20City\"&gt;Lower City&lt;/a&gt; through ; once you are past honored, you can gain rep by doing this instance in heroic mode through .\nBackground.\nIt is said that long ago, a shadowy cult invaded Auchindoun. In its depths, the cult released an immensely powerful, malevolent being from arcane captivity, blasting the decrepit city apart. Any adventurers brave enough to enter the abandoned, bone-littered remains of Auchindoun would do well to remember the warning of the city's original guardians, the Auchenai: those who do not respect the dead... may become entombed along with them.\nMany unsavory experiments were undertaken here in the pursuit of a greater understanding of the &lt;a href=\"Necromancy\"&gt;necromantic&lt;/a&gt; arts. Many spirits were tortured or destroyed therein.\nBefore &lt;a href=\"Exarch%20Maladaar\"&gt;Maladaar&lt;/a&gt;, another &lt;a href=\"Reanimated%20Exarch\"&gt;Exarch&lt;/a&gt; led the crypts.\nDungeon Journal.\n\"The original exiles on Draenor found death to be an unsettling and unfortunate consequence of life, and so the draenei hid their dead away in the subterranean grave-city of Auchindoun, a labyrinthine marvel beneath the forests of Terokkar.\"\nStrategy.\nPulls in the Crypts present a unique challenge for a few reasons.\nDungeon denizens.\nThe mobs in the Auchenai Crypts are mostly humanoid, undead draenei and skeletons. An average pull will consist of two or three draenei, with two to four undead non-elites joining the fight. There are many wandering non-elite undead in this instance, which in many cases can be avoided."}

It is located in the middle of the &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Wastes\"&gt;Bone Wastes&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Terokkar%20Forest\"&gt;Terokkar Forest&lt;/a&gt; within &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nShortly after the crash of the \"&lt;a href=\"Genedar\"&gt;Genedar&lt;/a&gt;\", &lt;a href=\"Exarch%20Othaar\"&gt;Exarch Othaar&lt;/a&gt; founded the &lt;a href=\"Sha%27tari\"&gt;Sha'tari&lt;/a&gt; order to study the remains of the dead &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"D%27ore\"&gt;D'ore&lt;/a&gt;. As the draenei worked, the Sha'tari &lt;a href=\"Maladaar\"&gt;Maladaar&lt;/a&gt; discovered that D'ore's remains were attracting souls of draenei killed in the crash, and that these souls could communicate with their living brethren once they arrived at the naaru. &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt; ordered Maladaar and other Sha'tari to move D'ore to a secluded place. They found such a location on the outskirts of &lt;a href=\"Terokkar%20Forest\"&gt;Terokkar Forest&lt;/a&gt;, a safe distance from &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;'s other civilizations, and there they built an immense mausoleum to house the naaru. The draenei spirits soon followed. D'ore's resting place became the &lt;a href=\"Crypt%20of%20Remembrance%20%28Auchenai%20Crypts%29\"&gt;Crypt of Remembrance&lt;/a&gt;, the first tomb, from which all of Auchindoun was born. Maladaar was named the fifth member of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Exarchs\"&gt;Council of Exarchs&lt;/a&gt; and created the &lt;a href=\"Auchenai\"&gt;Auchenai&lt;/a&gt; order to communicate with and protect the souls of dead draenei.\nAfter the fall of &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt;, many &lt;a href=\"vindicator\"&gt;vindicator&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Rangari\"&gt;Rangari&lt;/a&gt; fled to Auchindoun in hopes of defending it from the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Exarch Maladaar organized the military defenses, and they fiercely defended Auchindoun from &lt;a href=\"Teron%20Gorefiend\"&gt;Teron'gor&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt;. They also received aid from Auchindoun's departed spirits, and slaughtered many of the Shadow Council's agents. As Maladaar and his forces closed in, Teron'gor sought out the &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s who pooled their powers together and reached beyond the veil of reality. They sought to bring a powerful demon into the world, but in their wild desperation found something else instead: &lt;a href=\"Murmur\"&gt;Murmur&lt;/a&gt;. This otherworldly elemental creature was pulled to Draenor from a distant corner of the universe, and the shockwave on its arrival ripped the earth asunder. Many draenei were killed, and Auchindoun was blasted apart. Waves of destructive energy rolled out and leveled the &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Wastes\"&gt;surrounding forest&lt;/a&gt;. Maladaar and a handful of his draenei used their magics to shield themselves from the blast. But though they survived, they no longer had the numbers to resist the Shadow Council. Teron'gor and his warlocks overwhelmed the draenei and bound them in chains, and contained Murmur deep within Auchindoun as well.\nAuchindoun is now in turmoil as different factions vie for power in this magical spot: Ethereals suck the arcane energy from the Mana-Tombs, the Burning Legion harvests souls inside the Auchenai Crypts, arakkoa zealots work dark magic in the Sethekk Halls, and the Shadow Council plots its domination of Outland from within the Shadow Labyrinth.\nImprisoned within the depths of the Shadow Labyrinth by the Shadow Council is &lt;a href=\"Murmur\"&gt;Murmur&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt; similar to &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thunderaan\"&gt;Thunderaan&lt;/a&gt;, and the being who brought about the devastation of Auchindoun. He is the primordial essence of sound and constantly seeks to break free of his jailors and wreak havoc upon Outland. The Shadow Council has devoted much of their forces to controlling Murmur and harnessing his power for the Burning Legion.\nDescription.\n\"For thousands of years, the draenei have been interring their dead in Auchindoun, their most sacred temple. However, it was infiltrated by agents of the Shadow Council bent on summoning a horrifying creature of immense evil. Their vile act of magic resulted in a massive explosion that blew the temple apart and reduced the surrounding area into a charred wasteland. The blast also caused a rift in the Nether itself, drawing the otherworldly &lt;a href=\"ethereal\"&gt;ethereal&lt;/a&gt;s into Outland. The interred draenei now walk the ruins as restless spirits. Meanwhile, the horrific entity summoned by the Shadow Council threatens to overwhelm their efforts to contain it. You must prevent this evil from being unleashed upon an unsuspecting world. Auchindoun is divided into four wings, and is designed for a party of five characters levels 64-70.\"\nIn Warcraft II.\n&lt;a href=\"Fortress%20Auchindoun\"&gt;Fortress Auchindoun&lt;/a&gt; was the main stronghold of the &lt;a href=\"Bleeding%20Hollow%20clan\"&gt;Bleeding Hollow clan&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;. A large army was sent from here to attack the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Expedition\"&gt;Alliance Expedition&lt;/a&gt; base in the &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;, but Alliance forces under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Danath%20Trollbane\"&gt;Danath Trollbane&lt;/a&gt; destroyed the fortress, forcing the army to retreat.\nThis part was apparently retconned.\nDig sites.\nAuchindoun is a &lt;a href=\"Draenei\"&gt;Draenei&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"archaeology\"&gt;archaeology&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"dig%20site\"&gt;dig site&lt;/a&gt;.

However, anyone is entitled to buyout the item at that price, and even if someone is not the intended recipient of that item, \"stealing\" it is not punishable by GMs.\nAuction system mechanics.\nOpening the Auction House dialog.\nRight-click on one of the &lt;a href=\"auctioneer\"&gt;auctioneer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt;'s to open a dialog box where you can interface with the auction system. These NPC's always have the title Auctioneer and you can find them on your &lt;a href=\"Minimap\"&gt;Minimap&lt;/a&gt; by checking Auctioneers under Townsfolk; the gold coins icon () shows where they are. The dialog has three tabs, Browse, Bids, and Auctions, located at the bottom. Buyers will need the first tab to find an item to bid on, and the second tab to track current bids. Sellers will need the first tab to check prevailing prices, and the third tab to track the items they currently have on sale.\nFinding items.\nThe dialog starts on Browse tab where you can find items currently for sale. If you know the name of what you wish to find, simply enter all or part of it in the Name box, and click the Search button on the upper right, and the system will list all the items that match the string you entered. If you already have the item in your bags, most likely because you want to check the market on an item you want to put up for sale, Shift-click the item and the name will be filled into the box for you, avoiding any spelling issues.\nIf you don't have a specific item in mind, there are other ways to narrow down the list from the many hundreds of items available. To search for a specific category, click on one of the headings (weapon, armor, spell, recipe, etc.) on the left. Most categories have sub-categories, and many of these have sub-sub-categories, so you can choose how narrow the search will be. For example, you can list just Armor, just Leather Armor, or just Leather Armor for the Head. You can mix and match a category search with a name search as well, for example enter the phrase 'of the Tiger' into the Name box if you only want to see equipment with that specific enhancement. Click Search any time you want to find items that match the current options, or click Reset to clear the existing criteria and start over.\nIf you're looking for a specific range of levels, useful for weapons and armor, fill in the level range next to Name box. Note that this refers to the 'Required level to use' property, not the Item Level. So, for example, it your current level is 25 and you're looking to upgrade you Dagger, select Weapons/One-Handed/Daggers as your category, and a level range of 20 to 25. Next to the level range is a box that allows you to narrow down the list to items of a specific quality. Only items that match the selected level (Poor, Common, Uncommon, Rare, etc,) \"or above\" will be shown. \nNext to the quality box are check-boxes for Usable Items and Display on Character. If Usable Items is checked then only items which you can currently equip or otherwise use are shown. For example, if the category Recipes is selected and Usable Items is checked, then only those recipes which you can learn with your current professions and skill levels, and haven't already learned, will be listed. Check the Display on Character to display a &lt;a href=\"paper%20doll\"&gt;paper doll&lt;/a&gt; showing what your character would look like with the item equipped; this only applies to weapons and armor.\nItems for sale.\nA list of the items matching the conditions you set, if there are any for sale, will be displayed in the right pane of the dialog. Note that if no items appear it could be because none happen to be on sale, even though a matching item may exist in the game. The list of items for sale includes:\nClick on one of the column headings to change the order in which the items are listed, and click a second time to toggle between ascending and descending. The possible sorting options are Rarity, Level, Time Left, Seller, and Price per Unit. The Price per Unit sort goes by the Buyout price and items without a buyout price set are listed last.\nBuying an item.\nTo place a bid on an item, click on it and press the Bid button on the lower left of the dialog. The amount of the bid is deducted from your current cash and, assuming that no one places a higher bid before the auction expires, you'll receive the item in the mail. The amount of the bid will default to either be the initial bid amount set by the seller, or the next highest bid amount if there is an existing bid. You can adjust this amount in the price entry areas at the bottom of the dialog. When you place a bid, the amount is placed in escrow until the auction is over and you get the cash back in the mail if you lose the auction.\nIf you don't want to wait for the auction to expire, then press the Buyout button instead to pay the Buyout price and get the item in the mail right away. The Buyout price is usually higher than the Bid price as a premium for getting the item quickly. A Buyout price isn't always set though, in which case is only option is to place a bid.\nBid status.\nOnce you place a bid, you can check its status in the Bids tab of the dialog. This lists your currently active bids with the same item information listed in the Browse tab, along with the amount of your bid. Note that once you make a bid you can't cancel it; the only way of getting your money back is for someone else to outbid you. \nIf an item receives a large number of bids in a short amount of time, the duration on that item will be automatically increased by the AH (for example, a Short length will be changed to Medium, and a Medium to Long). It appears that the change in length is to the minimum amount for that length, not the maximum, so a change from Medium to Long changes the length to 2 hours, not 12.\nSelling items.\nTo sell an item, select the rightmost Auction tab at the bottom of the screen. But before doing so, you might want to search for the item in the browse screen to get an idea of how many are currently on sale and the going price. When the auction pane comes up, drag an item from your inventory to the Auction Item slot on the upper left. For non-stackable items, all you have to do next is enter the price at which you want bidding to start ([\u00a0 \u00a0] [\u00a0 \u00a0] [\u00a0 \u00a0]), and the Auction Duration (12, 24, or 48 hours). It is often a good idea to set a buyout price. These amounts may be the same, or different, as is the player's wish, but the buyout price cannot be lower than the minimum bid price. The bid suggested when you place an item up for auction is 150% of the &lt;a href=\"vendor\"&gt;vendor&lt;/a&gt; sell price (VSP). The minimum starting bid is 1 copper. Items with no sell value will suggest a bid of 1 silver. \nFor stackable items you also need to set a stack size. Since buyers can't break up a stack when they buy, it may be a good idea to break up large stacks when you create the auction. You can set the bid and buyout prices per item or per stack according to the selection box at the top of the pricing area. Make the Number of Stacks value greater than 1 to create multiple auctions at once, but it has led to the auction house being flooded with single stack items. This can be beneficial to the seller, as it means that people can buy the exact amount of an item that they want, but it may also mean that people who sell in single stacks lose money, as many people will want to buy items in relatively large stacks (see &lt;a href=\"%23Tips\"&gt;Auction House tips&lt;/a&gt;). When you're ready, press the Create Auction button to place the item on sale. A deposit will be deducted from your available cash and the item now appears in the list of items you have for sale in the right pane of the dialog.\nYou can cancel any auction by clicking the item and clicking the Cancel Auction button at the bottom of the screen. However, you will lose the deposit that you paid when first placing the item up for auction.\nDeposits.\nThe deposit fee, or listing fee, is the amount of money needed to place an item up for auction. It depends on the item's &lt;a href=\"vendor\"&gt;vendor&lt;/a&gt; sell price (VSP) and the amount of time you want to put the item up for auction. The deposit is paid immediately when you list the item. If the calculated deposit fee is fewer than (including the case when item has no vendor sell price, VSP=0), then final deposit fee will be . This often happens with low-level &lt;a href=\"fish\"&gt;fish&lt;/a&gt;es and &lt;a href=\"enchanting\"&gt;enchanting&lt;/a&gt; reagents.\nFees.\nWhen you successfully sell an item on the auction house, the house will take 5% of the winning bid as its cut. The amount of money you will receive by mail will be the winning bid, minus the cut, plus the return of your deposit:\nWhen an item fails to sell, you will receive the item in the mail, but your deposit will not be refunded. When you cancel an auction that has no bids placed on it, you simply lose your deposit, and the item is returned to you by mail. When you cancel an auction that has a bid in place, you will lose your deposit plus a fee equal to the house cut of the current bid. Note that you can't bid on an item which you placed on auction to avoid paying the deposit, even if you use another character on the same account. In most cases the house cut would be more than the deposit anyway.\nTips.\nAuctions are a great tool for finding items you might need. These items can get expensive, so be prepared when locating and pricing items at auctions. Auctions are also a convenient means of getting rid of excess inventory one might not be able use due to level or class restrictions, or products that you make using your &lt;a href=\"profession\"&gt;profession&lt;/a&gt;s. The game is set up so that some players get items they don't need while others who do need the items will find them difficult to obtain. An example of this is cloth since every player will get more cloth than they'll use for first aid, but tailors need a constant supply. So the auction house is designed to be an integral part of the game. Auction house prices reflect, as well as directly influence, the inflation ratio of the economy. \nWhether buying or selling, your most important resource is information. For buyers, you need to know whether the price for an item is a bargain you can't pass up or a rip-off you should stay away from. For sellers, you need to set a price low enough for the item to sell quickly, but no lower than that. \nWhat you can find out directly from the auction house is the current supply of an item and an idea of its 'going rate'. Unfortunately, the action house does not display what the item was selling for in the past, so if no items are currently on sale the going rate is more difficult to estimate. If there are few auctions for a specific item, try looking up similar items as well to get a clearer picture.\nWhat you can't find out directly from the auction house is what is the current demand for an item. For example, you may have an item to sell and, seeing that the going rate based on 4 players having the same item for sale for 5000g, you put the item on sale for 4900g feeling confident that you've undercut the competition. The problem is that just because there are five people trying to sell the item for 5000g doesn't mean there are any people willing to buy the item for 5000g, as you may discover when the item comes back to you 48 hours later. The vast majority of auctions are unsuccessful, so finding the best price which will get your item sold in a reasonable time can be very tricky. \nIdeally, you'd check the item every hour for a week to get a complete picture of the current market on your realm, but that's not really practical. But third party web-sites and apps have appeared which do just that. See the External links section below for a list of some of these tools."}

{"id": "46418", "revid": "22514", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=46418", "title": "Auction guide", "text": "The auction guide is intended as an advanced guide to using the &lt;a href=\"Auction%20House\"&gt;Auction House&lt;/a&gt; in World of Warcraft.\nBuying.\nAuctions are a great place to find hard-to-get items, profession materials, and items needed for quests. \nBuyout.\nAs the name suggests, some auctions will allow you to instantly purchase an item instead of bidding on it (just like \"Buy It Now\" on eBay). \nThere are pros and cons for both sellers and buyers with this system. For sellers, the pros include setting a reasonable Buyout may entice someone to grab the item before the auction ends. You may be able to get a slightly higher price from those who need an item right away and are willing to pay for the privilege. It is in your best interest to always include a buyout price. The only real con of setting a Buyout price is that you may set it too low and someone will snap it up and possibly turn around and sell it for more.\nFor buyers, the main benefit is obviously getting the item instantly. You may also run into items that have a lower than average Buyout price. In this case, you may actually be able to make some money off the item yourself by buying it and re-listing it at its \"proper\" or more competitive price.\nBidding.\nBidding works like any auction: you put in the price you are willing to pay, someone else can come along and outbid you. The person with the highest bid at the end of the auction wins the item.\nJust because an auction starts low does not mean that it won't skyrocket toward the end. Keep in mind that some sellers intentionally try to create a bidding war. Before you begin bidding, have a final price in mind. No matter how tempting it may be, don't go over that price - you may end up paying more than you wanted or more than the item is worth!\nOther.\nA seller can cancel an auction at any time, although they will lose the initial deposit (and if the item has been bid on, they will also be charged a percentage of the bid).\nIf you want to buy an item that has been listed with no buyout price, you can try to contact the seller directly and make an offer. You can also try this with costly items (especially a weapon or armor piece with a high deposit cost and relatively low demand). The seller may agree, especially if they're afraid the item won't sell or if they need money right away.\nSelling.\nNeed money? Have too much stuff in your bags? Sell it!\nDuration.\nYou should set most auctions to run 48 hours to maximize your auction's exposure. Remember, although the deposit is larger for longer auctions, your deposit will always be refunded if the auction sells. \nSometimes, you'll want to list auctions for 12 or 24 hours, especially if the deposit is prohibitively high (this is especially true for weapons) and if you're afraid demand might not be there. If you are sure that something will sell relatively fast, 24h is a less costly option. If you do so, make sure you list the auction during peak hours on your server. Player activity usually peaks between 6pm and 9pm and is higher on weekends. See (&lt;a href=\"Auction%20guide%23Time\"&gt;Time&lt;/a&gt;) for more details.\nKeep in mind that if you have a costly item that may not sell, it may be smarter to use the trade &lt;a href=\"channel\"&gt;channel&lt;/a&gt; rather than using the auction house at all.\nPricing.\nPricing an item can be difficult for those new to the Auction House. A good way to find out what something is worth is by searching for an identical item already posted. There may be several of the same item already up for auction, their prices should give you a rough idea of what the item is worth.\nHowever, there may not be any other items of what you are looking to sell currently on the Auction House. If this is the case, you can search for something similar. For instance, some items are part of a series, such as \"Fringed Cloak of the Bear\" or \"Fringed Cloak of the Eagle\". If this is the case, try a search for just \"Fringed Cloak\" and it will bring up the items in a series. This will give you an idea of what your item is worth, even though the exact one may not be listed.\nIf you cannot find any similar items, you have a few more options. One is to go to a vendor and see how much they will give you for the item (don't sell it to them, just hover your mouse over the item to see what it is worth). You can normally get several times the amount the vendor will give you in the Auction House. So go back and post it for 3-10 times the vendor amount. \nYou could also just post the item with a relatively low starting bid (don't put a Buyout price on it though), likely the item will be bid up to about what it is worth by the end of the auction.\nAlternatively, you can just wait until you see a similar item on the auction house, or ask around - your guild mates are a great resource!\nAuction House alts.\nYou may choose to post your auctions from an alt. There are several advantages to this.\nFirst, you can leave your alt in a major city and mail your items to it, so that your other characters don't have to travel back and forth. As your other characters obtain items that you wish to auction, it is easy to just drop those items into the nearest mailbox for your auction house mule to pick up later, thus freeing up precious bag space. Recent patches have removed the time delay for mailing items between your alts, so your items will be available for auctioning right away.\nSecondly, having an auction house mule allows you to keep your auction house inventory separate from the items that your other characters have in their inventories. You don't have to remember which items are flagged for posting or re-posting, or organize your inventory to keep those items separate. Auctions that don't sell will come back to the auction house alt, instead of back to your main.\nFinally, using an auction house alt also provides you anonymity. It's possible that if you are involved in heavy trading or practices that some see as ethically questionable (such as trying to corner a market) some players may hold it against you. Therefore your alt can protect your main's reputation. (On the other hand, 95% of your potential buyers either never pay attention to the names attached to the auctions or simply don't care.) Posting auctions from an anonymous mule also prevents whispers at inconvenient times from other people to ask about items that you have posted.\nOther information.\nNeutral Auction Houses.\nBoth Factions can auction items here on the AH since it is run by the &lt;a href=\"Steamwheedle%20Cartel\"&gt;Steamwheedle Cartel&lt;/a&gt;. These Auction Houses have a bigger &lt;a href=\"Auction%20House%23Fees\"&gt;Auction House Cut&lt;/a&gt; than Faction Auction Houses.\nTwink items.\n&lt;a href=\"Twink\"&gt;Twink&lt;/a&gt;s often seek out the best possible items that they can equip at their current level. These items are always in high demand at the Auction House. Battleground twinks especially will pay high prices for the best items usable at level 19, 29, etc. If you come across one of these items, especially &lt;a href=\"BoE\"&gt;BoE&lt;/a&gt; rare items with good PvP qualities, you will get a very good amount of money by selling it via the Auction House.\nTransmogrification items.\nSince transmogrification (or 'mogging') was added to WoW, a new niche opened for gold making: selling mogging items. These are usually green world drop items which look good (overall or as a part of themed set) and can sell for a greatly increased price. While selling these items requires sellers to have a lot of knowledge on which items look good and where to farm them, if handled properly it may net a lot of profit.\nScams and tricks.\nAuctioneer baiting.\nSometimes a scammer will repeatedly post a piece of &lt;a href=\"vendor%20trash\"&gt;vendor trash&lt;/a&gt; or another less-than-valuable item at extremely high prices. The idea is to get people who are scanning with &lt;a href=\"Auctioneer%20%28addon%29\"&gt;Auctioneer&lt;/a&gt; or other &lt;a href=\"AddOns\"&gt;AddOns&lt;/a&gt; to collect this bad data. Then the scammer will post the item for a much lower (but still expensive) price, hoping to bait others into buying what they think is a good deal.\nTo avoid this, never buy something unless you know exactly what it is.\nInflated buyouts.\nSometimes you'll see common items like trade goods listed for extremely high buyouts, like &lt;a href=\"Strange%20Dust\"&gt;Strange Dust&lt;/a&gt; for 100 gold. \nThere are two ideas behind this scam. First, the scammer hopes some poor fool will click on the auction by accident or not notice the erroneous price. This may not happen very often, but when it eventually does, the scammer makes a lot of money.\nAnother version of this scam has the scammer setting a very low starting bid but high buyout. For example: &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Fire\"&gt;Heart of Fire&lt;/a&gt; for bid and buyout. The scammer hopes that in the ensuing bidding war, someone will accidentally click \"buyout\" instead of \"bid.\" However, this scam is more risky because it requires an item that is at least somewhat valuable. Plus it is less likely to happen now because there is now confirmation box before a buyout is made.\nWTB through alt.\nSometimes people check the AH for blue or epic items that are the only ones who are being sold at that moment. They buy the item, repost it on an ALT for a much higher price. Then they logon to another character and start typing in trade: \"WTB &lt;item in question&gt; for xxxG\", where xxx is 50G or so over the buyout price of the item in question. People who know that there is such an item for sale at the AH might buyout that item (giving the scammer a nice profit) thinking to make a nice bundle of money. The scammer then invents some reason not to buy the item.\nManual trading.\nItems with the same icon.\nMany items in the game use the same icons as one another\u2014occasionally a person offering to trade a rare item will replace this item with an extremely common item that uses the same icon when trading. To counter this, make sure to mouse over any item placed in the trade window to make sure it is the correct item.\nWill not be traded slot.\nTrade windows include a slot at the bottom that will not trade the item in question. This slot is used for placing enchantments or enhancements on a person's equipment, including soulbound items. Occasionally people will try to trade an item within this slot, accepting payment without trading the item itself. To prevent this, make sure that none of the items for trade are in the 'will not be traded' slot.\nThe reverse of this trick to offer or sell an enchant, but then insist that the item to be enchanted be traded rather than placed in the \"will not be traded.\" A new player might not understand that enchants can be applied through the trade window and hand over the item, never to see it again. Many valuable items will be soulbound and unable to be traded in this way, but some non-binding items can be sold for good prices for varying reasons. Be sure to always use the \"will not be traded\" for item enchants.\nChanging sale amount at confirmation.\nWhen selling items, the buying participant will sometimes change the amount of gold offered \u2014 usually by a factor of ten \u2014 after the seller has confirmed it. For example, the buyer might change 600 gold offered to 60 gold right before finishing the trade. This will de-confirm the window \u2014 however, the change is not obvious, and the deconfirmation happens for many unimportant changes, so people will usually re-confirm anyway and lose out on potentially hundreds of gold. To counter this, make sure to thoroughly check the transaction if the confirmation ever gets de-confirmed.\nTime.\nTime of day.\nOn most servers, player activity peaks at 6pm to 9pm. It is usually at its lowest point around 6am. If you're running mostly 24 hour auctions with buyouts it doesn't matter when you post your auctions. If you're relying on bids, or trying to post short auctions, it's best to do it when players are most active. Check your servers' time zone to find out when most players will be on. Often, server time and your time will be different, leaving you trying at the wrong hours.\nDay of the week.\nOn weekends, (Friday, Saturday, Sunday) and holidays, player activity is significantly higher. Apparently Monday and Tuesday are the lowest activity days, since Blizzard put weekly maintenance on Tuesday mornings. This has led to many theories about when to post auctions.\nSome theorize that Sunday is the best day to post auctions for armor and weapons because casual players have just finished a weekend of levelling up and will be looking for new gear.\nLikewise, prices for trade goods may drop on weekends as less informed players all try to undercut each other. On the other hand, demand for these goods also rises on weekends. On weekdays there's a better chance that someone (or yourself) will try to create a monopoly on certain trade goods, driving prices up. Therefore, weekends are (sometimes) good for buying trade goods and weekdays are good for selling them.\nSome professions have a relation to player activity, like jewelcrafting. Players that loot new gear will often need new gems. You are likely to sell more gems on evenings that guilds raid (can be both weekend and weekdays, but especially Wednesday and Friday). A smart time seems to be to post your gems around 20:00-22:00, since a lot of your competition will be raiding, so won't undercut you after you posted, and raids end about 21:30-00:30. Keeping an eye on what nights big guilds raid, and how active the LFG channel is, together with some experience, can help you pick good times.\nWeekly maintenance.\nOn some Monday night/Tuesday morning(US) or Tuesday night/Wednesday morning (Europe), realms go down for several hours for maintenance. Auctions, however, still expire. \nDon't post auctions on a day before maintenance, unless you don't mind losing a lot of your auction's duration.\nIf you bid on an auction with a short or medium duration remaining right before the server shuts down, you will win that auction because no one else will be able to bid on it.\nThere's only one problem with this strategy: other people are also doing it. The time before shutdown is very active, with a few players furiously bidding on the good deals. It's exciting, but you'd actually win just as many auctions by bidding on other nights, when fewer people are paying attention.\nSpecial events.\nWhenever a special &lt;a href=\"event\"&gt;event&lt;/a&gt; such as a holiday occurs, pay attention to any items that can be traded. Things with limited availability may become more valuable as time passes. Special events may also be: new arena season (new gear), game patches/content extensions, etc.\nAlso pay attention to items required by new quests. When the Feast of Winter Veil appeared, the quest &lt;a href=\"Treats%20for%20Greatfather%20Winter\"&gt;Treats for Greatfather Winter&lt;/a&gt; asked players to obtain &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Cold%20Milk\"&gt;Ice Cold Milk&lt;/a&gt;. Shockingly, many players didn't know or perhaps didn't care that the milk could simply be bought from a vendor. For a very brief time, milk was actually selling on the auction house for a hundred times its actual value. Much more lucrative was the jump in demand for certain trade goods when the &lt;a href=\"Tier%200.5\"&gt;Tier 0.5&lt;/a&gt; quests were introduced. Keep an eye on reports from beta testing to predict future opportunities of this nature.\nExternal links.\n \n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wowuction.com\"&gt;WoWuction&lt;/a&gt; Online WoW auction house database"}

Auctioneer has been downloaded more than 29 million times from &lt;a href=\"Curse\"&gt;Curse&lt;/a&gt;, 2 million from &lt;a href=\"WoWInterface\"&gt;WoWInterface&lt;/a&gt;, and an unknown number from the addon's main website &lt;a href=\"https%3A//auctioneeraddon.com/\"&gt;AuctioneerAddon.com&lt;/a&gt;. It remains the most-downloaded addon within the \"Auction &amp; Economy\" section of Curse as of mid 2020. The addon's popularity began in Vanilla and was sustained on Retail until at least 2019 when several versions were downloaded in excess of 500 thousand times each. This addon also was featured in many fan-made \"gold making\" guides and forum posts such as the now-defunct \"JustMyTwoCopper\" blog.\nHowever, &lt;a href=\"Patch%208.3.0\"&gt;Patch 8.3.0&lt;/a&gt; overhauled the native &lt;a href=\"Auction%20House\"&gt;Auction House&lt;/a&gt; UI which obsoleted some of Auctioneer's enhancements such as the ability to list large quantities with few clicks or have a batch jobs for common transactions (implemented as favourites in the new native UI). Norganna has not yet published an updated AddOn compatible with this new UI, but announced development work was underway. Nevertheless, the addon remains highly popular on Classic with its Nov 2019 update being installed 700 thousand times from Curse within six months.\nAuctioneer is in fact a suite of different addons including Auctioneer, BeanCounter, Enchantrix, Informant, and Stubby. This &lt;a href=\"http%3A//AuctioneerAddOn.Com\"&gt;Auctioneer Suite&lt;/a&gt; compilation has been credited to a &lt;a href=\"http%3A//Norganna.Org\"&gt;team&lt;/a&gt; of active developers including and .\nBottomFeeder controversy.\nUntil October 2006, Auctioneer included a module titled \"BottomFeeder\" that automated certain functions such as buying underpriced items and potentially relisting them. The module was voluntarily removed by the developer to avoid conflicts with botting and automated program policies.\nOnly three months later, &lt;a href=\"Patch%202.0.1\"&gt;Patch 2.0.1&lt;/a&gt; changed the auction house API so that user-interactivity (like a button click) was necessary to execute trades. BottomFeeder was then rebranded as \"BottomScanner\" and re-introduced to scan and identify opportunities, but requiring a mouse click to confirm any orders. This human-in-the-loop variant has since remained an accepted part of the addon, and even expanded in 5.2 to include features branded as \"SearchUI\"."}

The city is entered by traversing through the bleached-white jaws of a giant shark. Life is cheaper here than in most places; and no one is to be trusted. It is considered a &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt;'s paradise, full of information and informants.\nLand of pirates, swindlers, and raiders, it is one of the most cutthroat places on Azeroth. There is a newspaper called the &lt;a href=\"Booty%20Bay%20Journal\"&gt;Booty Bay Journal&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe area was previously known as the Blackwater Cove and was described as a large, sheltered, semi-circular cove surrounded by cliffs at the southern end of &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt;. It was a former small port town inhabited by &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s which was overrun by &lt;a href=\"jungle%20troll\"&gt;jungle troll&lt;/a&gt;s. Eventually, the &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Steamwheedle%20Cartel\"&gt;Steamwheedle Cartel&lt;/a&gt; managed to drive out the trolls from the immediate area to claim the shores of the cove for their new center for operations in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 Booty Bay. This happened prior to the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, as Booty Bay was already territory of the Steamwheedle Cartel by then.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, two orcs visited the town. &lt;a href=\"Bloodeye%20Redfist\"&gt;Bloodeye Redfist&lt;/a&gt;, having been a hotheaded troublemaker, was about to be captured by goblins but &lt;a href=\"Rehgar%20Earthfury\"&gt;Rehgar Earthfury&lt;/a&gt; bought him from the goblins.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, Booty Bay was still run by the &lt;a href=\"Blackwater%20Raiders\"&gt;Blackwater Raiders&lt;/a&gt; who are closely associated with the &lt;a href=\"Steamwheedle%20Cartel\"&gt;Steamwheedle Cartel&lt;/a&gt;, the port offers facilities to any traveler passing through, regardless of their faction. Combined with the world-renowned &lt;a href=\"Salty%20Sailor%20Tavern\"&gt;Salty Sailor Tavern&lt;/a&gt;, it is one of the most popular locations in &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs the ruler of this city, &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Revilgaz\"&gt;Baron Revilgaz&lt;/a&gt; hired all the help he could get against the pesky &lt;a href=\"Bloodsail%20Buccaneers\"&gt;Bloodsail Buccaneers&lt;/a&gt; and other threats to the city. He resides, together with the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Blackwater%20Raiders\"&gt;Blackwater Raiders&lt;/a&gt;, Fleet Master &lt;a href=\"Seahorn\"&gt;Seahorn&lt;/a&gt;, at the top of the inn of Booty Bay.\nOutside of Booty Bay, on the island of &lt;a href=\"Janeiro%27s%20Point\"&gt;Janeiro's Point&lt;/a&gt;, is a giant statue of an unknown &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; with outstretched arms which was built as a beacon to all travelers, welcoming ships to the port.\nBloodsail Buccaneers found their way to Booty Bay and jumped &lt;a href=\"Dizzy%20One-Eye\"&gt;Dizzy One-Eye&lt;/a&gt;, stealing his &lt;a href=\"Dizzy%27s%20Eye\"&gt;eye&lt;/a&gt;. The Buccaneers also planned an attack on Booty Bay, but an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; discovered their plot and warned the leadership of Booty Bay.\n&lt;a href=\"Makasa%20Flintwill\"&gt;Makasa Flintwill&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Flintwill%20family\"&gt;her family&lt;/a&gt; lived in Booty Bay as members of the &lt;a href=\"Blackwater%20Raiders\"&gt;Blackwater Raiders&lt;/a&gt;.\nScourge Invasion.\nDuring the second &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20Invasion\"&gt;Scourge Invasion&lt;/a&gt; the port town received a shipment of &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;infested&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Conspicuous%20Crate\"&gt;crates&lt;/a&gt;. Soon, the people of Azeroth were whispering that something was wrong with the grain shipment.\nLegends: An Honest Trade.\nAt some point, a famous &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarven&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Smith\"&gt;blacksmith&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nori%20Blackfinger%E2%80%8E\"&gt;Nori Blackfinger\u200e&lt;/a&gt;, lived and had a shop called Black Finger in the town. It is unknown what happened with the shop after Nori's presumed death.\nPearl of Pandaria.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Li%20Li%20Stormstout\"&gt;Li Li Stormstout&lt;/a&gt; arrived in Booty Bay, which &lt;a href=\"Chen%20Stormstout\"&gt;Chen&lt;/a&gt; had told her about in his letters as a place where many of his adventures had begun. In the Salty Sailor Tavern, a gnome privateer recognized her as a pandaren and said he hadn't seen one since he met Chen Stormstout. Li Li bought the gnome drinks if he told her the tale; he was part of a crew that attacked a ship from Stormwind that Chen happened to be on. While Chen fought them all off, the gnome stole a small box from him which he still had. Li Li demanded the gnome hand it over to her, threatening to knock out his teeth and also promising to buy him another beer. As she turned to leave with her prize, Strongbo appeared and told her to return to the Wandering Isle. Li Li, having expected him, told a pair of goblin bruisers that he took her rocket mount. As Bo fought them off, Li Li ran off into the jungles of Stranglethorn Vale on her way to Stormwind and the ship Chen was on.\nCataclysm.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the statue on &lt;a href=\"Janeiro%27s%20Point\"&gt;Janeiro's Point&lt;/a&gt; was partially damaged due to a tidal wave caused by the Cataclysm, exposing hidden treasure inside. Booty Bay has been partially damaged, as the large red cannons have fallen into the sea, and flotsam and jetsam can be seen littered around the harbor.\nAt the same time, tensions between Booty Bay and the Bloodsail Buccaneers have come to a head, and the town was under a direct pirate attack, set ablaze, and blockaded. The &lt;a href=\"Brashtide%20Crew\"&gt;Brashtide Crew&lt;/a&gt; stormed the area, and some of the inhabitants were in terror, others were stationed outside their buildings ready for a fight. The port was ultimately defended by the adventurers.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Zandalari\"&gt;war against the Zandalari&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; visited the town in order to warn Revilgaz about the new threat of the trolls.\nQuest for Pandaria.\nAfter the death of &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, the town was visited by Li Li Chen Stormstout again. They entered the tavern and got acquainted with &lt;a href=\"Catelyn%20the%20Blade\"&gt;Catelyn the Blade&lt;/a&gt;. After the &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; realized that she stole the &lt;a href=\"Pearl%20of%20Pandaria%20%28item%29\"&gt;Pearl of Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; from them, they confronted her at her ship, the \"&lt;a href=\"Neptulon%27s%20Bride\"&gt;Neptulon's Bride&lt;/a&gt;\". At that moment, the Bloodsail Buccaneers, now led by &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Koslov\"&gt;Captain Koslov&lt;/a&gt;, attacked the town once again. Swarming out from every hiding place imaginable around the dock, the armed pirates ambushed Booty Bay's bruisers, bounding toward the Raiders' ships. Catelyn ordered for the \"Bride\" to leave the port, only to set sail to a Bloodsail trap out in the open sea. After the \"Bride\" was rescued by the arrival of Catelyn's father, &lt;a href=\"Ansirem%20Runeweaver\"&gt;Ansirem Runeweaver&lt;/a&gt; and some of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s, the \"Bride\" returned to Booty Bay. The Bloodsail attack left Booty Bay disorganized, and it would be some time before private ships were available for charter again.\nLegion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the \"&lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Veil\"&gt;Crimson Veil&lt;/a&gt;\" docked in Booty Bay.\nExploring Azeroth.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Flynn%20Fairwind\"&gt;Flynn Fairwind&lt;/a&gt; visited the town.\nDragonflight.\nFollowing the demon invasion, the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Zeros\"&gt;Zeros&lt;/a&gt; lived in Booty Bay for several years and built a mighty reputation as an auction house trader, but after the reawakening of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt; Zeros got in troubles. The town was then visited by &lt;a href=\"Senegos\"&gt;Senegos&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; who aided the young dragon. Senegos also commented that he might have liked this place in his youth.\nNPCs.\n\"Excluding the above areas:\"\nReputation.\nHaving all of the Steamwheedle Cartel's goblins' factions at Exalted is a requirement for &lt;a href=\"Insane%20in%20the%20Membrane\"&gt;Insane in the Membrane&lt;/a&gt;.\nKilling the &lt;a href=\"Bloodsail%20Buccaneers\"&gt;Bloodsail Buccaneers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Venture%20Co.\"&gt;Venture Co.&lt;/a&gt; in Stranglethorn will increase your &lt;a href=\"reputation\"&gt;reputation&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Steamwheedle%20Cartel\"&gt;Steamwheedle Cartel&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs of \"Cataclysm\", several goblins of &lt;a href=\"Bogpaddle\"&gt;Bogpaddle&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20of%20Sorrows\"&gt;Swamp of Sorrows&lt;/a&gt; are part of the Booty Bay faction.\nSee &lt;a href=\"Steamwheel%20Cartel%20Reputation%20Rebuilding%20Quests\"&gt;Steamwheel Cartel Reputation Rebuilding Quests&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn Warcraft III.\n&lt;a href=\"Pirate\"&gt;Pirate&lt;/a&gt;s once anchored their &lt;a href=\"ship\"&gt;ship&lt;/a&gt;s here. The tileset is called \"Lordaeron Summer\".\nIn the RPG.\nThis dangerous little town is the home base for the &lt;a href=\"pirate\"&gt;pirate&lt;/a&gt;s who traffic off the southwestern coast of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28continent%29\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Inhabited mostly by &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s and ruled by &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Revilgaz\"&gt;Baron Revilgaz&lt;/a&gt;, Booty Bay is home to the &lt;a href=\"Blackwater%20Raiders\"&gt;Blackwater Raiders&lt;/a&gt;, a group of notorious pirates comprised of goblins, &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s, and many others who swore them allegiance. After a raid, these pirates send their loot up the road to the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20Arena\"&gt;Arena&lt;/a&gt; to sell, or even further into Azeroth.\nBooty Bay has a &lt;a href=\"prison\"&gt;prison&lt;/a&gt; which can drain one's will to live.\nSpeculation.\nBlackwater Cove was presumably one &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;'s settlements that sparked the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20War\"&gt;Gurubashi War&lt;/a&gt;. This war was sparked when Stormwind made settlements in Stranglethorn and angered the Gurubashi trolls, which matches the description of trolls driving humans out of Blackwater Cove before it became Booty Bay."}

It is located on a large strait within the central region of &lt;a href=\"Tiragarde%20Sound\"&gt;Tiragarde Sound&lt;/a&gt;. Boralus serves as the seat of &lt;a href=\"House%20Proudmoore\"&gt;House Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, and as a center of trade and military power for the entire nation.\nStanding as one of the largest &lt;a href=\"port\"&gt;port&lt;/a&gt;s on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, the city possesses its own unique personality. A safe port of call in unsafe waters, &lt;a href=\"Boralus%20Harbor\"&gt;Boralus Harbor&lt;/a&gt; is, aside from &lt;a href=\"Proudmoore%20Keep\"&gt;Proudmoore Keep&lt;/a&gt;, the most heavily guarded part of the city. Merchants from all over Azeroth dock here to trade their goods. It is usually the only place most visitors ever get to see. Recently, it has been characterized by political squabbling and criminal activity, and has become a focus of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt; and an important territory for the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe mermaids and the seawall.\nIn its oldest days, when almost no one thought of themselves as \"Kul Tiran\" and when old folk still referred to &lt;a href=\"Gilneas\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; as \"home\", Boralus was little more than a collection of houses on a rock. Its citizens\u2014fishers, shipwrights, sailors, and pearl-divers\u2014did not live easy lives, for while the town was sheltered from the south by the escarpments of Tiragarde, from the north by the mountains of &lt;a href=\"Stormsong%20Valley\"&gt;Stormsong Valley&lt;/a&gt;, and from the west by the delta where the three islands of Kul Tiras met, there was nothing to protect it from the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt; in the east. Each year produced at least one storm that destroyed the ships in the harbor and threatened to permanently wipe the rocks clean of both houses and people. It's said that in the morning, the harbor was so filled with drowned bodies that the living simply covered them with weighted nets to sink them down to the seafloor. It was impossible to build a seawall due to the immense depths of the waters between the spit, and the work of repairing the wall after each storm would've claimed as many lives as it saved. The people of Boralus figured that they would have to get by on their wits and bravery alone.\nAccording to folklore, &lt;a href=\"mermaid\"&gt;mermaid&lt;/a&gt;s lived openly near Boralus in those days. The humans falsely believed that the creatures portended storms and drowned sailors for amusement, but this changed as a result of the mermaid &lt;a href=\"Halia\"&gt;Halia&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"tidesage\"&gt;tidesage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ery\"&gt;Ery&lt;/a&gt;, who fell in love with each other and began meeting in secret. One day a great storm unexpectedly came to Boralus. It continued for several days, dashing the ships and their crews against the rocks and sucking the people of the town into the waves. Ery and the handful of &lt;a href=\"tidesage\"&gt;tidesage&lt;/a&gt;s who were present gathered in small boats at the river's mouth to divert the water. The sea priests faltered one by one until only Ery was left, and with Halia's help she stopped a great wave coming for the town. Halia then began constructing a seawall at the bottom of the harbor while Ery continued holding back the water. Halia was soon joined by other mermaids, and together they built the wall higher and higher with rocks, mud, ship debris, and sailors' bones until it broke the surface and continued to rise under Ery's feet, though a number of mermaids died in the process, their power spent. The tidesage eventually collapsed from exhaustion and fell into the water. Without her power to hold them back, the waves crashed into the seawall, but it held steady. Halia saved her beloved's life by slitting her feet and jumping with her into the harbor, prompting the &lt;a href=\"Mother%20%28mermaids%29\"&gt;Mother&lt;/a&gt; to turn her into a mermaid. As long as Boralus' mighty seawall has stood, its people now swear on mermaids as symbols of highest honor and good luck, as well as sacrifice, for no mermaids were ever seen in the harbor again. On certain calm sunsets when the red is deeply reflected on the surface of Boralus Harbor, old sailors call it \"Ery's blood\", which presages good weather, in remembrance of the dutiful tidesage and the mermaid who loved her.\nModern history.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Invasion of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, Kul Tiras was assaulted by an expedition of the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Horde of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the end of the &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiran%20civil%20war\"&gt;Kul Tiran civil war&lt;/a&gt;, Boralus was attacked by &lt;a href=\"Priscilla%20Ashvane\"&gt;Priscilla Ashvane&lt;/a&gt;'s traitorous &lt;a href=\"Ashvane%20Trading%20Company\"&gt;Trading Company&lt;/a&gt;, allied with the &lt;a href=\"Irontide%20Raiders\"&gt;Irontide Raiders&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"pirate\"&gt;pirate&lt;/a&gt;s and the &lt;a href=\"Scrimshaw\"&gt;city's gangs&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Boralus\"&gt;siege&lt;/a&gt; the city almost fell, but was saved when &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; managed to summon back the &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiran%20fleet\"&gt;Kul Tiran fleet&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;war against the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, the city was attacked by &lt;a href=\"pirate\"&gt;pirate&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Hourglass%20%28ship%29\"&gt;the \"Hourglass\"&lt;/a&gt;, captained by &lt;a href=\"Timecap%27n%20Hooktail\"&gt;Timecap'n Hooktail&lt;/a&gt;, as part of her heist. A small portion of the harbor was caught in flames and fighting erupted on the ramparts, which were defended by Boralus' guards.\nGeography.\nBoralus is located on a cluster of small islands in the eastern part of &lt;a href=\"Tiragarde%20Sound\"&gt;Tiragarde Sound&lt;/a&gt;, and it is a city beholden to the sea. Roughhewn wooden planks line intertwining walkways, terraces, and stairs. Sea-weathered rooftops and awnings adorn the buildings, while amber-lit windows and walkway lanterns lend honeyed tones to the atmosphere. Stone thoroughfares and hanging colorful nautical flags strike a contrast to the sea-worn brick-and-wood construction, creating a sense of warmth despite the chill of the surrounding sea. The sounds of Tiragarde gulls can be heard crying overhead.\nIron-reinforced locks in the center of &lt;a href=\"Boralus%20Harbor\"&gt;Boralus Harbor&lt;/a&gt; bar the way from the sea into the inner channels at the heart of the city, while cannons on either side serve as an additional deterrent to vessels approaching with ill intent. Great galleons make their berth in the harbor.\nWithin the harbor's &lt;a href=\"Tradewinds%20Market\"&gt;Tradewinds Market&lt;/a&gt;, visitors will find everything they need for an extended stay in Boralus. Merchants from all over Azeroth are drawn here to hawk their wares, traveling well-establishing trade routes between here, the town of &lt;a href=\"Hatherford\"&gt;Hatherford&lt;/a&gt;, and the fertile lands of &lt;a href=\"Stormsong%20Valley\"&gt;Stormsong Valley&lt;/a&gt;.\nGetting there.\nA character of any level can get to Boralus by boarding \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Relentless\"&gt;The Relentless&lt;/a&gt;\" in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Harbor\"&gt;Stormwind Harbor&lt;/a&gt;. A two-way portal between Boralus and &lt;a href=\"Wizard%27s%20Sanctum\"&gt;Wizard's Sanctum&lt;/a&gt; in Stormwind City also becomes available upon completing &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20the%20Sages%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Sanctum of the Sages (quest)&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nBoralus, &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;' capital, lies on the island's west coast. The city's population has dwindled since &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina&lt;/a&gt;'s and &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Daelin Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;'s exodus, and many houses and surrounding farms lie empty. Currently the city's population stands at four-thousand heads. The people have drawn in away from the fringes and toward the coast; one can wander for a while through the abandoned residential districts and market places in the city's east side. An ideal place for a secret society or hidden cabal as the town is eerily quiet.\nStill, Boralus is a friendly enough harbor, though almost all its citizens carry long knives to \"gut the &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;\". Kul Tiras's diminished fleet patrols the waterways leading to the harbor, so &lt;a href=\"merchant\"&gt;merchant&lt;/a&gt;s from &lt;a href=\"Southshore\"&gt;Southshore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Menethil%20Harbor\"&gt;Menethil Harbor&lt;/a&gt; and (rarely) &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; make Boralus a regular stop."}

Acting under the authority of &lt;a href=\"House%20Proudmoore\"&gt;House Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, the guard keep peace throughout Boralus's various districts, though some remain the territory of cutthroat gangs. Importantly, the Boralus Guard garrison the city's walls and harbor defenses, including the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Gate%20%28Boralus%29\"&gt;Great Gate&lt;/a&gt;, which in turn protects all of &lt;a href=\"Tiragarde%20Sound\"&gt;Tiragarde Sound&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe city &lt;a href=\"Boralus\"&gt;Boralus&lt;/a&gt; has long served as the capital of &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike many other &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; cities, it was not directly attacked during any of the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third&lt;/a&gt; Wars and so its defenses remained intact.\n&lt;a href=\"Lorena\"&gt;Colonel Lorena&lt;/a&gt; was once a member of the Guard after her father sponsored her application there. Over the years, she worked her way up the ranks.\nDuring the reign of &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Admiral\"&gt;Lord Admiral&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Daelin Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, the Boralus Guard became a highly disciplined and formidable force, an achievement that Daelin took great pride in. The death of the Lord Admiral at &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt;, and the following isolation of Kul Tiras, meant that access to Boralus was strictly closed off to most outsiders. For years, the &lt;a href=\"Boralus%20Harbor\"&gt;harbor&lt;/a&gt; was the only location visitors got to see.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nWhen Lady &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; returned to her homeland in the midst of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the city guard immediately took her into custody on the order of Lord Admiral &lt;a href=\"Katherine%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Katherine Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;. The guard brought Jaina before her mother at &lt;a href=\"Proudmoore%20Keep\"&gt;Proudmoore Keep&lt;/a&gt;, where the Lord Admiral disowned her publicly. Following this, the Boralus Guard were ordered to seize King &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; delegation in the &lt;a href=\"Tradewinds%20Market\"&gt;Tradewinds Market&lt;/a&gt; by Lady &lt;a href=\"Priscilla%20Ashvane\"&gt;Priscilla Ashvane&lt;/a&gt;, though the intervention of &lt;a href=\"Cyrus%20Crestfall\"&gt;Cyrus Crestfall&lt;/a&gt; diffused the situation.\nAs part of what became the &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiran%20civil%20war\"&gt;Kul Tiran civil war&lt;/a&gt;, the Boralus Guard would clash with &lt;a href=\"House%20Ashvane\"&gt;House Ashvane&lt;/a&gt; thugs in and around &lt;a href=\"Unity%20Square\"&gt;Unity Square&lt;/a&gt;, as Lady Ashvane herself fled the city. The city guard quickly gained the upper hand and crushed the coup, though the threat from the &lt;a href=\"Ashvane%20Company\"&gt;Ashvane Company&lt;/a&gt; remained.\nThough well-disciplined years ago, some elements of the city guard had by now become corrupt and lax. Acting on rumors that many guards were in the pocket of the &lt;a href=\"Scrimshaw\"&gt;Scrimshaw gang&lt;/a&gt; of criminals, &lt;a href=\"Taelia\"&gt;Taelia&lt;/a&gt; would send &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;agents&lt;/a&gt; to investigate &lt;a href=\"Dubious%20Guard\"&gt;dubious guards&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Dampwick%20Ward\"&gt;Dampwick Ward&lt;/a&gt;. The information proved accurate, with any corrupt members of the guard encountered being brought to justice.\nThe Boralus Guard were finally put to the ultimate test when &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Ashvane\"&gt;Lady Ashvane&lt;/a&gt; and a fleet of &lt;a href=\"pirate\"&gt;pirate&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ashvane%20Company\"&gt;Company&lt;/a&gt; loyalists attacked Boralus itself, with the intent of ousting &lt;a href=\"House%20Proudmoore\"&gt;House Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; and taking power. Ashvane's forces eventually breached the walls, with fierce street fighting spreading throughout the city. With the help of &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt;, the city guard was able to hold the line long enough to gain the upper hand. The death of &lt;a href=\"Viq%27Goth\"&gt;Viq'Goth&lt;/a&gt; and the invaders' commanders marked a temporary victory over the attack.\nAmid the fighting, a force of &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; infiltrators also made their way into Boralus and assailed its defenders.\nEventually, however, another wave of ships led by Ashvane herself approached the city. Boralus's defenders and its harbor defenses had been decimated, with little chance remaining of holding off the attack. It was only with the intervention of the &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiran%20fleet\"&gt;Kul Tiran fleet&lt;/a&gt;, called by &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, that Boralus was saved and final victory secured."}

{"id": "33240", "revid": "46586549", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=33240", "title": "Borean Tundra", "text": "The Borean Tundra (pronounced \"BOHR-ian\", not \"boh-REHH-an\") is located in the far southwestern edge of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, and is the home of the &lt;a href=\"tuskarr\"&gt;tuskarr&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragon\"&gt;blue dragon&lt;/a&gt;s. The &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Scourge\"&gt;Undead Scourge&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; also inhabit the region. Important landmarks include the tuskarr capital of &lt;a href=\"Kaskala\"&gt;Kaskala&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Riplash%20Ruins\"&gt;Riplash Ruins&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Coldarra\"&gt;Coldarra&lt;/a&gt; is an island just off the western coast. Kaskala is currently under siege and the tuskarr have moved to &lt;a href=\"Unu%27pe\"&gt;Unu'pe&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Borean Tundra contains bases of both the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, and does not have an emphasis for a specific faction. &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Hold\"&gt;Warsong Hold&lt;/a&gt; has a zeppelin tower connecting it to &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Valiance%20Keep\"&gt;Valiance Keep&lt;/a&gt; has a dock connecting it to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;. This is the first place many travelers of both the Alliance and the Horde see when descending upon Northrend.\nThere is also a port between the Tundra and &lt;a href=\"Howling%20Fjord\"&gt;Howling Fjord&lt;/a&gt; that uses a giant turtle with a deck on its back as a quick means to travel between the two starting regions of the continent. There is a &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt; town that may be used after some quests for &lt;a href=\"Druids%20for%20the%20Ethical%20and%20Humane%20Treatment%20of%20Animals\"&gt;D.E.H.T.A.&lt;/a&gt;. The murlocs can actually talk and repair your equipment. They also have quests against an infected camp across the cove.\nHistory.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; established the settlement of &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Hold\"&gt;Warsong Hold&lt;/a&gt; under the command of the &lt;a href=\"Mag%27har%20orc\"&gt;Mag'hari&lt;/a&gt; son of &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;. The Horde has created a pact with the local and culturally similar &lt;a href=\"tuskarr\"&gt;tuskarr&lt;/a&gt;, who are under siege from naga based at the Riplash Ruins. These &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; intend to use their generators to melt the surrounding ice caps, though these plans have been thrown off course by their defeat by the &lt;a href=\"Kvaldir\"&gt;Kvaldir&lt;/a&gt;, a clan of &lt;a href=\"Vrykul\"&gt;Vrykul&lt;/a&gt; which are also raiding the tuskarr. Garrosh and his forces have also discovered the enigmatic &lt;a href=\"taunka\"&gt;taunka&lt;/a&gt;, an ancient offshoot of the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; race thought to be lost forever.\nGeography.\nThe Borean Tundra is a sprawling, cold place where the wind can about strip the beard off your face. It\u2019s the flattest part of the continent, and like the name suggests, there\u2019s not a tree to be seen, just a low, rolling landscape of red and brown with a bit of lichen green thrown in for variety. &lt;a href=\"Mammoth\"&gt;Mammoth&lt;/a&gt; and woolly &lt;a href=\"rhino\"&gt;rhino&lt;/a&gt;ceros herds wander about, looking for enough food to eat. The tundra gives a person the wrong impression of Northrend, though, as it feels like an afterthought in a place so defined by its mountains.\nThere are &lt;a href=\"tuskarr\"&gt;tuskarr&lt;/a&gt; stone elders all around the Borean Tundra, ranging in size from shorter than a &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarf&lt;/a&gt; to taller than a house. A lot of those statues are by the coast and, according to &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, are use to mark their fishing routes while some have been seen inland too.\nThe Borean Tundra is wide, flat, and cold. The landscape varies greatly. Hard but farmable soil in the south lead to nourishing steam pools in the middle. Along the west edge, nasty cliffs rise up and then shear off into the &lt;a href=\"Westrift\"&gt;Westrift&lt;/a&gt;. The north is home to grasslands and an area of steep hills. To the northwest, one can see the high plateau island of &lt;a href=\"Coldarra\"&gt;Coldarra&lt;/a&gt;. The east is snow-covered and the most brutal this area has to offer. A river separates the Borean Tundra from the &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuests.\nThe major questlines explore a variety of conflicts across the zone. The native tuskarr and taunka are being uprooted from their villages by the &lt;a href=\"Kvaldir\"&gt;Kvaldir&lt;/a&gt;. Multiple sinkholes are disgorging crypt fiends around the recently established fortifications of Warsong Hold and Valiance Keep. Territorial aggression is being observed in the Magmothran magnataur. The Fizzcrank gnomes have awakened a flesh-hating terror, fused from abandoned Titan technology.\nIn the course of battling these threats, Warcraft's player heroes will also uncover a handful of political plots. The first sparks of the &lt;a href=\"wolvar\"&gt;wolvar&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Oracle\"&gt;Oracle&lt;/a&gt; conflict are evident as these groups also have their opponents in the &lt;a href=\"Winterfin%20Retreat\"&gt;Winterfin tribe&lt;/a&gt; of murlocs. An organization known as the &lt;a href=\"Druids%20for%20the%20Ethical%20and%20Humane%20Treatment%20of%20Animals\"&gt;Druids for the Ethical and Humane Treatment of Animals&lt;/a&gt; are conscripting everyone they can, to bring &lt;a href=\"Nesingwary\"&gt;Nesingwary&lt;/a&gt;'s poachers to justice. The wizards of Dalaran are investigating the kidnapping of magical talent from the areas surrounding the Amber Ledge.\nFinally, after these many trials, the player will come to confront the subversive figure known as &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Valanar\"&gt;Prince Valanar&lt;/a&gt;, atop the floating necropolis of &lt;a href=\"Naxxanar\"&gt;Naxxanar&lt;/a&gt;.\nWild creatures.\nRare Elite NPCs associated with the achievement.\nIn the RPG.\nThe Borean Tundra is the longest region in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, running from its southwestern tip up to &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Wintergrasp\"&gt;Lake Wintergrasp&lt;/a&gt;. It has a lot of snow and the ground here is more dirt than rock. Small trees and scrub dot the landscape, but everything is still frozen solid. Somehow the tundra avoids most of Northrend's problems. The &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; rarely comes here, the &lt;a href=\"Ice%20troll\"&gt;Drakkari&lt;/a&gt; are only a minor nuisance, and even the ice storms are less severe. Perhaps the Borean Tundra owes its fortune to its isolation.\nDespite its empty landscape, the Tundra provides opportunities for adventure. It has ruins to explore, a city to approach, hunters to avoid, and a &lt;a href=\"Sholazar%20Basin\"&gt;strangely warm basin&lt;/a&gt; to examine. Although most of the tundra is empty ice it has several Drakkari camps but none big enough to have names. &lt;a href=\"Nerubian\"&gt;Nerubian&lt;/a&gt;s wander about as well, though it seems only small packs of them. Same with the Scourge.\nHistory.\nJudging by the ruins in the region, &lt;a href=\"nerubian\"&gt;nerubian&lt;/a&gt;s were the first to inhabit it. Some think the Borean Tundra is just a part of &lt;a href=\"Azjol-Nerub\"&gt;Azjol-Nerub&lt;/a&gt; that got thrust up from underground unless it was an experiment to see if they could be comfortable living above ground. If the later is the case it must have failed, since it is a ruin. The &lt;a href=\"tuskarr\"&gt;tuskarr&lt;/a&gt; were next and &lt;a href=\"Kaskala\"&gt;Kaskala&lt;/a&gt;'s oldest village is at least several centuries old while the rest grew up around it as family members split off to start their own smaller families. The Drakkari are more recent additions to this area and have no fixed settlement. The Scourge rarely appears, and its agents never stay longer than it takes to patrol and look for potential dangers or new recruits.\nThe Drakkari wander the Tundra in small hunting parties based out of isolated camps. Not long ago a Drakkari &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Han%27jin\"&gt;Han'jin&lt;/a&gt; allied his camp with three others and they are currently building a more permanent base while inviting other camps to join them. If he keeps the hunters united, Han'jin will become the ruler of a small town, and the Drakkari will become a major threat to the tuskarr and anyone else roaming the Borean Tundra.\nPeople and culture.\n&lt;a href=\"Tuskarr\"&gt;Tuskarr&lt;/a&gt; are the dominant presence in the Borean Tundra although since they keep near their villages, you can go days without seeing another living creature. They are good neighbors and mostly care about fishing, whaling and protecting their villages. Some have seen tuskarr fending off hungry Drakkari, and even fighting a few wayward nerubians, so they are formidable foes; but no one has ever seen them attack anyone without good reason.\n&lt;a href=\"Ice%20troll\"&gt;Drakkari&lt;/a&gt; wander the tundra, but not in any significant numbers, though if all of them got together in one place they would be a problem. Luckily most are content to roam alone or in small packs. They have seen several camps throughout the region. It seems they wandered over from &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Drak\"&gt;Zul'Drak&lt;/a&gt;, through the &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt;, and came to the Tundra to hunt. They harass the tuskarr from time to time, but every time the tuskarr gather their forces they send the Drakkari away. An individual Drakkari is probably tougher than a tuskarr, but the tundra has a lot more of the walrus-men.\nThe Borean Tundra has &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; as well, though only near the southern end, in the &lt;a href=\"Riplash%20Ruins\"&gt;Riplash Ruins&lt;/a&gt;. Sometimes you can see &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragons\"&gt;blue dragons&lt;/a&gt; who come from the nearby &lt;a href=\"Coldarra\"&gt;Coldarra&lt;/a&gt;, where they live, and fly overhead from time to time. Breathtaking creatures, and surprisingly cordial. There are a few Scourge creatures, but mostly lone scouts straggling over from the lake area.\nThe Tundra is not an important part of Northrend, at least according to both &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s and the Scourge, since it is too isolated and too barren to be desirable and has too much shoreline to be defensible. Tuskarr like it because of that expansive shore, and the Riplash Ruins give the naga a perfect view of anyone approaching across the ocean from the south. Drakkari hunt here because they can and because the tundra provides little cover for wildlife. Most others stay well away, preferring the forested areas to the east.\nGeography.\nThe Borean Tundra is wide, flat and cold. A solid sheet of ice covers it, and beneath that is soil frozen rock-hard. Along the western edge the ice rises up into some nasty cliffs, which then shear off into the &lt;a href=\"Westrift\"&gt;Westrift&lt;/a&gt;. To the north the ice smooths out into one glittering sheet that is glass-slick and leads right to &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Wintergrasp\"&gt;Lake Wintergrasp&lt;/a&gt;. The northwest corner, up by the &lt;a href=\"Sholazar%20Basin\"&gt;Sholazar Basin&lt;/a&gt;, has no ice and only a little snow \u2014 a few hardy souls have even set up farms there. The east is also gentler, still snow-covered but less treacherous where it leads down to the ocean.\nAt its north edge the tundra runs into Lake Wintergrasp, a vast frozen lake that effectively shields it from the &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Glacier\"&gt;Icecrown Glacier&lt;/a&gt;. The only way to reach these areas overland is across the mountains bordering the Dragonblight or through the Sholazar Basin, neither of which are easy for even a seasoned traveler. An army would be suicidal to attempt either.\nNot many plants can survive up here. Without any cover the wind is fierce enough to tear flesh, and you can barely hear yourself when you shout. A few trees manage to hang on, evergreens, but the small twisted kind rather than the tall proud ones out east. There some animals roaming the region, mostly &lt;a href=\"Wolf\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"rabbit\"&gt;rabbit&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"fox\"&gt;fox&lt;/a&gt;es or even &lt;a href=\"bear\"&gt;bear&lt;/a&gt;s. Most of the life is in the water, though. The tuskarr can point out every kind of &lt;a href=\"whale\"&gt;whale&lt;/a&gt; imaginable and they hunt all of them. They also know about at least twenty different types of fish in the area. If you are handy with a spear and a net you can feed yourself pretty easily along the shore."}

Once the Soulgrinder was found, however, Borgal refused to turn it over and slew Wolfscream and his &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Guard%20%28Frostfire%20Ridge%29\"&gt;Iron Guards&lt;/a&gt;.\nGarrison Campaign.\nHe is first found using the Soulgrinder to harvest the souls of the slaves under Bloodmaul captivity in order to gain more magical power, along with his &lt;a href=\"ogron\"&gt;ogron&lt;/a&gt; subordinate &lt;a href=\"Grubnor%20Wargut\"&gt;Grubnor Wargut&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Orlana%20Strongbrow\"&gt;Orlana Strongbrow&lt;/a&gt; notes that before using the Soulgrinder, he used totems for the same purpose. It is these same totems that Orlana uses to draw Borgal out in the spirit world so that he could be defeated."}

Though a highly-skilled fighter, his arrogance and aloofness often put him at odds with his comrades. &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt; saw it as a symptom of the group's lack of unity, and aimed to instill a tighter camaraderie between the knights. Vranesh took part in the reclamation of &lt;a href=\"Sunsail%20Anchorage\"&gt;Sunsail Anchorage&lt;/a&gt; and maintained a vigil at &lt;a href=\"Dawnstar%20Spire\"&gt;Dawnstar Spire&lt;/a&gt;. Vranesh later informed Liadrin of &lt;a href=\"Galell\"&gt;Galell&lt;/a&gt;'s disappearance and confided that many suspected him to be the murderer of &lt;a href=\"Orovinn\"&gt;Orovinn&lt;/a&gt;.\nVranesh identified the presence of a hooded and cloaked individual moving to and from the spire, though learned too late that it was a risen &lt;a href=\"Dar%27Khan%20Drathir\"&gt;Dar'Khan Drathir&lt;/a&gt;, who had lured the knights into the open to kill and raise them into undeath. Vranesh fought off the undead and turned the battle around on his opponents, and was the first to heal &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; when the regent lord was engulfed in Drathir's flames.\nFollowing the death of &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt;, Vranesh joined the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; and is located in the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20Light\"&gt;Sanctum of Light&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe later traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt; to support the &lt;a href=\"Armies%20of%20Legionfall\"&gt;Armies of Legionfall&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Deliverance%20Point\"&gt;Deliverance Point&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the split of the Order during the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, he is no longer a member of the Silver Hand.\nAfter the death of &lt;a href=\"Vorath\"&gt;Vorath&lt;/a&gt;, Vranesh was among the gathered paladins outside the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Blood\"&gt;Hall of Blood&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Farstriders%27%20Square\"&gt;Farstriders' Square&lt;/a&gt; to congratulate the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;sin'dorei hero&lt;/a&gt; for their victory in &lt;a href=\"Deatholme\"&gt;Deatholme&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuotes.\nJust before taking off to patrol the Royal Exchange, Vranesh walks up to &lt;a href=\"Champion%20Bachi\"&gt;Champion Bachi&lt;/a&gt; and bows before him. He then leaves the building and mounts up.\nUpon arriving at the guards in front of the bank:\nUpon arriving at the guards in front of the jewelcrafters:\nUpon arriving at Farstrider ranger practice grounds:\nThe guards will respond with some of the following after each of his emotes:"}

Killing a &lt;a href=\"monster\"&gt;monster&lt;/a&gt; that yields reputation inside a dungeon while wearing a particular faction's &lt;a href=\"tabard\"&gt;tabard&lt;/a&gt; will grant reputation with that faction; it allows a player to acquire reputation in a dungeon with a &lt;a href=\"faction\"&gt;faction&lt;/a&gt; other than that normally associated with the dungeon.\nThe tabards that allow championing can be acquired at reputation with their respective factions.\nFactions that can be championed.\nOnly some factions can be championed.\nFaction capitals.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"patch%204.0.3a\"&gt;patch 4.0.3a&lt;/a&gt;, it is now possible to champion the faction capitals in dungeons of any level by purchasing an applicable tabard from the faction &lt;a href=\"Quartermaster\"&gt;Quartermaster&lt;/a&gt;. Initially, faction capitals could not be championed in instances that were already connected to a specific faction, such as those introduced in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;The Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;\" expansion. As of patch 4.3, faction capital reputation can also be championed in 5-man Burning Crusade dungeons, though under slightly different rules from those in Azeroth.\nThe reputation gained in The Burning Crusade dungeons is in addition to the normal Outland faction reputation gain, so the player improves his or her standing with two factions at once. The reputation gain follows the same rules as those for the host faction; since &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Ramparts\"&gt;Hellfire Ramparts&lt;/a&gt; grants Honor Hold or Thrallmar reputation until one point short of Honored, wearing a home city tabard in that instance grants Alliance or Horde reputation, improving all capital reputations until one point short of Honored. Level 70 and Heroic dungeons give reputation for both the Outland faction and the capital city through Exalted.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nDungeons introduced in the \"&lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;Wrath of the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;\" expansion that are intended for level 80 players, including certain &lt;a href=\"normal%20mode\"&gt;normal mode&lt;/a&gt; dungeons and all &lt;a href=\"heroic%20mode\"&gt;heroic mode&lt;/a&gt; dungeons, are eligible for championing the following factions:\nIf you do not wear a champion tabard, you may gain reputation with either the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Expedition\"&gt;Horde Expedition&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Vanguard\"&gt;Alliance Vanguard&lt;/a&gt;. Wearing any championed faction's tabard, even the tabard for a \"Cataclysm\" faction that cannot be championed in a level 80 dungeon, will prevent Horde Expedition or Alliance Vanguard reputation gain. Heroic mode dungeons will provide a small increase to the rate of reputation gain. Normal-mode dungeons prior to level 80, such as &lt;a href=\"Utgarde%20Keep%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Utgarde Keep&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Nexus%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Nexus&lt;/a&gt;, behave the same way as old-world dungeons; the player may champion the capital cities, but will not gain reputation with any group by default.\nDungeons intended for players above level 80 (i.e. those from Cataclysm and Mists of Pandaria) do not award any reputation for these factions even if the tabard is worn.

They possess two crests running from their head to their lower back, and wings, which they can also use as fins to swim. Naga train them in &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Azshara\"&gt;Shrines of Azshara&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Morgala%20Darksquall\"&gt;Morgala Darksquall&lt;/a&gt; summoned an immense couatl to attack the ship \"&lt;a href=\"Wavecutter\"&gt;Wavecutter&lt;/a&gt;\". She referred to it as a \"dark denizen of the deep\", and it was able to spit acidic venom.\nIn the RPG.\nDistantly related to &lt;a href=\"wind%20serpent\"&gt;wind serpent&lt;/a&gt;s, couatl are rare creatures of great strength. Couatl are distinguished from their smaller cousins by their immense size (nearly twice the length of a normal wind serpent) and the brilliant display of bright yellow and green plumage across their heads and backs in two long rows. Their shorter, feathered tails serve to further distinguish them from wind serpents. Lastly, their wings are much greater and bear more feathers. Couatl nest in trees and crags dotting the coasts of Azeroth. Some are venomous, some are magical, some are both, and some are neither. Couatl occasionally disrupt magic, which makes some people think that they have an understanding or intelligence of it. This idea is incorrect \u2014 couatl are nonsentient animals. Recently, naga have returned to the surface of Azeroth and domesticated couatl. The naga breed these tamed couatl in order to optimize the lethality of their venom and train them to be fiercely loyal to their naga masters. Not all couatl are magical beasts. Like wind serpents, couatl vary in more than simply size and color. Some couatl are purely nonmagical in nature, yet still large and highly venomous. These couatl are animals, not magical beasts.\nCouatl can be found flying and swooping among the treetops of &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;. Their feathers are collected by adventurers.\nSpeculation.\nWhile the &lt;a href=\"snap%20dragon\"&gt;snap dragon&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"tidal%20guardian\"&gt;tidal guardian&lt;/a&gt;s\u2014two other naga creatures originally confined to \"Warcraft III\"\u2014make appearances in &lt;a href=\"Nazjatar\"&gt;Nazjatar&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Patch%208.2.0\"&gt;patch 8.2&lt;/a&gt;, the couatl remain absent. The &lt;a href=\"fathom%20ray\"&gt;fathom ray&lt;/a&gt;s of Nazjatar bear some slight resemblance to couatl and may thus be intended to be the same type of creature."}

Defeating both the &lt;a href=\"Sun%20King%27s%20Salvation\"&gt;Sun King's Salvation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Artificer%20Xy%27mox\"&gt;Artificer Xy'mox&lt;/a&gt; encounters is required to unlock the gates to reach the Council of Blood. As such, they are typically fought 7th in the instance. The fight changes depending on the order in which the three bosses are killed. Killing Baroness Frieda last is typically seen as the easiest, while killing Castellan Nikalaus last is generally seen as the fight's &lt;a href=\"hard%20mode\"&gt;hard mode&lt;/a&gt;. The loot of the fight does not change based on kill-order.\nAdventure Journal.\n\"The Council of Blood presides over courtly functions in Revendreth. Castellan Niklaus is a strict military commander with an indomitable will and impenetrable armor. Lord Stavros, a foppish dandy, leads the court in dance but is also deadly with his blades. Baroness Frieda wields powerful anima magics and commands the dredger wait staff--along with the respect of the entire court.\"\nStrategy.\nThis fight requires two tanks. &lt;a href=\"Bloodlust\"&gt;Bloodlust&lt;/a&gt; should be saved for the final phase when raid-damage is highest. The three bosses each fight differently, with Nikalus summoning adds, Stavros forcing raid movement and coordination, and Freida needing &lt;a href=\"interrupt\"&gt;interrupt&lt;/a&gt;s. Of these, Nikalus is easily the most dangerous, with the &lt;a href=\"dredger\"&gt;dredger&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"stoneborn\"&gt;stoneborn&lt;/a&gt; adds he summons adding far more complexity and raid-wide damage to the fight when not killed first. The easiest way to beat this encounter is killing the bosses in this order: Niklaus, Stavros, and finally Frieda. Since the other bosses heal completely when one dies, it is pointless to multi-dot and cleave, and best to focus on single-target damage. An interrupt rotation on Baroness Fireda is important to stop her Dreadbolt Volley cast, which hits for significant damage and a shadow dot that hurts for even more. Calling-out interrupts is recommended.\nWhen each boss reaches 50% health, they will engage in the fight's most notable mechanic: The Danse Macabre. As the bosses rush up to their podium and become untargetable, the players will see a bright yellow spotlight somewhere in the room that only they can see. They need to rush under that spotlight before the dredgers finish coming out to the dance floor to successfully begin the dance. You will know your character has successfully begun when they automatically perform their /dance animation. From here, the bosses will call out 1 of 4 different directions your character needs to move in order to continue dancing: \"Shimmy right!\" (right) \"Sashay left!\" (left) \"Prance forward!\" (forward) and \"Boogie down!\" (backwards). All of these directions are relative to the character facing towards the boss' podium. The shapes on the floor denote where you need to stop moving. Successfully completing dance steps will award the character with Fancy Footwork, a significant haste buff for 30 seconds, while failing will give a dot that stacks shadow damage until the current Danse Macabre is over. Once a Danse Macabre has completed, the bosses will not trigger another until a boss has died and another is then brought down to 50% health.\nThe fight also has a soft-enrage mechanic, Oppressive Atmosphere. As the fight continues, the raid will take increasing passive shadow damage. The atmosphere can only be reset by killing one of the bosses or by triggering a Danse Macabre. Ideally, the stacks should not go above 7, as it becomes increasingly taxing on the healers' mana.\nPhase 1.\nFor the first phase, one tank should take both Niklaus and Frieda, while another tank takes Stavros alone. This is due to the two separate tank debuffs: Niklaus will strike the tanks with Duelist's Reposte, while Stavros will teleport behind his current tank and rush forward, afflicting anyone caught with a stack of Evasive Lunge. Keeping the melee dps away from Stavros in Phase 1 will keep the chance that they will be clipped by Evasive Lunge to a minimum as they focus on Niklaus. When a tank gets 2 stacks of Duelist's Reposte, melee should stand back and wait for the tanks to cleanly swap to avoid Stavros.\nDuring this phase, Stavros will cast Dark Recital, (\"Everyone, find your partner or die!\") debuffing several players for 8 seconds with a shadow damage dot that is lethal if the players are too far away from each other. Each player who is affected must move close to their \"partner\" to reduce the damage. DBM will mark players who are designated as \"partners.\" However, in addition to the shadow damage, small eruptions will spawn underneath the afflicted players and explode after about 1 second. This means that the afflicted players can never stand still, cannot carelessly run through other players on the way to meet their partners, and once close to their partners, must continue moving in roughly the same direction until the debuff expires. This can potentially lead to hectic situations, especially in melee-heavy groups. To counter this, melee dps should watch their DBM timers and step away from other players and the bosses just as the Dark Recital is cast. Therefore, if they are affected, their eruptions will not hit other players, and if they are not, then they have made more room for the afflicted ones to move away from the boss and towards their partners.\nNiklaus will summon a Dutiful Attendant, an add that shields the lowest-health boss, making them invincible. These adds should always have priority. Note that when Niklaus hits 50% and casts his Danse Macabre, any Dutiful Attendant adds that were alive as the Danse began will reappear at the edge of the room and shield the boss once again. With the haste buff from a successfully completed Danse, any remaining attendants should go down quickly.\nFinally, in addition to her Dreadbolt Volley, Frieda will also channel Drain Essence, which drains health from 3 random non-tank players. This damage is unavoidable and those affected should be spot-healed.\nPhase 2.\nOnce Niklaus is down, the other two bosses will be restored to 100% and gain new abilities while maintaining their old ones. As the dps switches to Stavros, both melee and tanks need to be cautious about positioning due to Starvos' Evasive Lunge. Melee need to stand to the left or right of the boss, as standing in-front or behind will result in taking lethal damage. Tank swapping should be done by a tank not moving until the other stands in their spot, taunts Stavros, and allows the original tank to move away. This will reduce the chance Stavros changes direction enough to put the melee in danger.\nStavros retains his Dark Recital and Evasive Lunge, while gaining Waltz of Blood. This cast summons several untargetable venthyr who proceed to dance around the room, inflicting damage and knocking back anyone in their way. Combined with Dark Recital, Waltz of Blood can prove to be a very disruptive ability. However, since the adds do not move very far from where they are summoned, simply moving the raid and bosses a good distance away from the adds trivializes this ability.\nMeanwhile, Frieda gains Prideful Eruption. This creates large circles around each player that will create a 6-yard explosion when the cast finishes, dealing high damage to all players and even more if others are caught in another player's circle. Simply move away from other players when Frieda is channeling and heal through the damage.\nPhase 3.\nWhen Stavros goes down, the last phase begins. This phase has high raid-wide magic damage from both Prideful Eruptions and from Frieda's final ability, Soul Spikes. Soul Spikes is cast on her current tank and radiates a portion of the damage it deals to the entire raid. She will send 4 spikes to her current tank, each increasing the amount of damage the tank takes from subsequent spikes. While a tank can survive this ability with cooldowns, it is easier for the second tank to taunt when Frieda has cast 2 spikes, keeping the damage to both the tanks and the raid to a minimum. This last phase is essentially a test for the healers to keep everyone alive long enough to finish the fight. So long as the healers have enough mana by the end of the second phase, the last boss should go down relatively easily."}

They are empowered by &lt;a href=\"Gara%27jal%20the%20Spiritbinder\"&gt;Gara'jal the Spiritbinder&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Zandalari\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; representative).\nBackground.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"The history of the troll tribes -- the Drakkari, the Farraki, the Amani, and the Gurubashi -- is awash with millennia of betrayal and conflict, but the Zandalari's promise of a new, unstoppable empire has finally united these disparate troll leaders.\"\nEncounter Design.\n\"Gara\u2019jal the Spiritbinder\u2019s defeat in the Mogu\u2019shan Vaults was, yes, &lt;a href=\"merely%20a%20setback\"&gt;merely a setback&lt;/a&gt;. It takes more than a few blades and spells to put a voodoo priest down for good, though he no longer possesses a corporeal form. So this time around you aren\u2019t fighting him directly, but rather dealing with him as he possesses and empowers leaders of four other troll tribes, strengthening their attacks until you can force him out of the body he has chosen to occupy.\"\nStrategy.\nTanks, healers, and DPS all have important jobs to perform in this encounter. There are no phases, only mechanics that change according to which councilor is activated. The only thing that doesn't change is not standing in sand.\nThis is a two-tank fight. Kazra-jin cannot be tanked and can be ignored. Malakk has a stacking debuff and can be tank-swapped: however, this may not be desirable if Malakk has the lowest health (due to Marli's Blessed Spirits), and in these cases, the Malakk tank should pop major cooldowns and, with help from the healers, soak the debuff. The Priestess is a caster that can either be left to free-cast or interrupted occasionally as long as a tank maintains aggro. The most important aspect for tanks (besides the optional Malakk swap) is to keep the Priestess away from whatever mob has the least health to give DPS time to kill the summoned healing add. This tends to be Malakk in the beginning of the fight. While Sul is the activated councilor, a tank must also pick up the spawned sand elementals for AoE. When they die, they reform the damaging sand piles.\nOne melee should be left on Sul to interrupt. Maintaining a DPS on Sul will also force him to be the lowest health. The rest of the DPS should always be on the possessed councilor. It is important to take off 25% of the possessed mob's health before it reaches 100% energy. Possessed Kazra-jin reflects damage, so try to time any heavy hitting abilities for when he is not overloaded while not holding back DPS too much. The Priestess' adds are top priority when they spawn and can be stunned, slowed, and knocked back. Kill sand adds when they spawn.\nWhen Kazra-jin is reflecting damage, healers will have to compensate since the DPS cannot hold back. Sandstorm will also deal raid-wide damage. Dispel all roots.\nAlso, when Malakk is possessed, the ranged and healers should stack on the person with Frostbite. Alternatively, the Frostbite target can run and stack on the tanks and melee.\nBurning Sul first.\nMost groups find it easiest to kill Sul before he becomes empowered, as dealing with the sand elementals can be extremely problematic the first time, and is deadly if Sul becomes empowered a second time due to their sheer numbers\nThe exact way of doing this will vary between raid groups, but one way of doing this is:\nIt is of critical importance that Marli's Blessed Spirits be given top priority, as they will always head straight for Sul (as Sul will always have the lowest health). A single Blessed Spirit getting through can severely hurt the raid's chances of killing Sul before his first empowerment.\nHeroic Mode.\nThe fight plays pretty much same as Normal mode,but every boss ability granted by Gara'jal empowerments is somewhat changed.\nThe fight is somewhat similar to Normal,but the raids will prefer to make sure sul is absolutely dead before he is ever empowered.You should burn him with Heroism,like on the strategy above and kill the loa spirits to prevent him from getting healed(if the dps of the raid is huge,they can affort to ignore the loa spirit). Once this is done,your raid should proceed with the fight and deal with the abilities properly as listed above and focus next malak to get rid of the frostbites and allow tanks to hold the soul shards(but Kaz'Rajin is also a valid target,as his discharge abilitie can be pretty heavy to heal though).\nIts also important to note than raids might prefer to 3heal it due to the damage going around(unless they heavy overgear the fight,in such case 2healing is also possible).\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

The council, which regularly met in &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt;, eventually resulted in the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;.\nMembers.\nThe council consisted of the following members:\nDespite being the heir of Stormwind, &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; wasn't originally invited to the first council's meeting, with Terenas and Lothar agreeing that the boy should not have to deal with additional scrutiny right then. &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alonsus%20Faol\"&gt;Archbishop Alonsus Faol&lt;/a&gt; were both present as silent listeners, though Varian himself and &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Prince Arthas&lt;/a&gt; had also sneaked in one of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20chamber\"&gt;throne room&lt;/a&gt;'s upper balconies to secretly listen to it.\n&lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; was present for another meeting and publicly brought Varian with him.\nHistory.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;'s destruction by the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt; at the end of the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, Sir Anduin Lothar led the city's refugees north. Word of Stormwind's destruction soon spread to other nations, and Terenas Menethil II, King of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, was deeply shaken by the news. It had been difficult to sift fact from rumor, and initially, Terenas had not even believed that the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s were real, but now he knew that they were a grave threat. When &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;'s survivors finally reached Lordaeron, Lothar told Terenas of the Horde's true might and urged the king to gather the other &lt;a href=\"Seven%20Kingdoms\"&gt;human nations&lt;/a&gt; immediately, for he argued that the Horde would easily be able to pick off each kingdom one by one if they did not unite against their common foe. In time, the leaders of all the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; nations gathered in Lordaeron's &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt;. There had not been such a gathering in recent memory, and the occasion was deemed the Council of Seven Nations.\nInitially, unity seemed but a distant dream. While all rulers heard Anduin Lothar's plea, not all of them initially took it seriously. Lord Perenolde first asked if the orcs would be open to negotiation, before deriding Lothar as urging for unity but having nothing himself to bring to such assembly. Terenas assured everyone of his support for Prince Varian and his intention to help him reclaim Stormwind. The Lordaeron king as such urged his fellow rulers to band together into an alliance to eradicate the Horde and reclaim the south. Antonidas, Proudmoore, and Trollbane all showed interest in the idea. Antonidas had heard firsthand accounts of the Horde from &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;, while Proudmoore was friends with Lothar and believed that avenging a destroyed human nation was the correct course of action. Trollbane had a close relationship with Lordaeron and was also willing to fight. Gilneas and Alterac were not as easily convinced, however, showing open suspicion about whether or not there had been an invasion by otherworldly creatures at all and believing that there had to be some other explanation. The root of this suspicion was the work of the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragon\"&gt;black dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, who had earlier taken on the guise of a human noble and begun to spread rumors in Lordaeron that the tales of orcs were merely fabrications meant to hide growing problems with human rebels, which had seemed far more believable than Stormwind's cries for help.\nAs the Council of Seven Nations continued its meetings, the Horde prepared for war. As the orcs marched north, they conquered much of &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;, laid siege to the &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarven&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gnome\"&gt;gnomish&lt;/a&gt; cities of &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt; and began to construct a fleet to launch a surprise attack in the heart of humanity's territories. When gnome and dwarf refugees arrived in Lordaeron with news of the conquest, the Council was shocked. The speed with which their territories had fallen defied understanding, and the Horde was now encroaching north. Despite this development, Greymane and Perenolde stubbornly resisted calls for creating an alliance. They feared that by unifying, they would lose some of their regional power. Divisions widened between the members of the council, and the arguments grew so heated that Gilneas and Alterac threatened to abandon the council entirely.\n&lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt;, one of Lordaeron's most venerated &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s, could not stand by in attendance as the council members squabbled over meaningless issues. He brought the orphaned prince of Stormwind, &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, to his side and called on the leaders to forget their old differences. If they underestimated the orcs, every kingdom would suffer Stormwind's fate \u2014 their cities would burn and their children would become orphans like Varian, if they even survived at all. Turalyon argued that the human nations stood at a crossroads. If they failed to unite, history would know them as a people too proud to band together, who'd had a chance to save &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; but had thrown it all away over politics and illusions of power. Yet if they did unite, they could change history and arise as Azeroth's guardians, for no other race in the known world had humanity's resources, strength of leadership, or bravery. The Council of Seven Nations erupted in applause after Turalyon's speech, his words even managing to sway Greymane and Perenolde. On the very same day, the human leaders voted unanimously to form the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. The Council decided on Anduin Lothar as the one to lead the Alliance military, since he would be able to act fairly and neutrally due to his Stormwindian background and lack of political ties to the northern nations. Lothar accepted his title with great humility and immediately rallied the Alliance's forces before ordering them to &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;gather&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpeculation.\nThe &lt;a href=\"High%20Command\"&gt;High Command&lt;/a&gt; may be an alternate name for the Council."}

These six individuals are the leaders of both the city and all territories under the control of Dalaran. The Six are usually the most senior, but not necessarily the most gifted. They are chosen by several means, magic but one of them.\nHistory.\nThe council meets in the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20Air\"&gt;Chamber of Air&lt;/a&gt;, a room with no visible walls \u2014 the gray stone floor with its central diamond symbol stood beneath an open sky that shifted and changed rapidly, as if the time sped past within the chamber.\nTraditionally, the membership of the Council of Six was kept a strict secret to avoid any danger of bribery, blackmail, and other pressure. When someone met with the Council officially, it was always in a special, enchanted chamber, the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20Air\"&gt;Chamber of Air&lt;/a&gt;, and the Six would be disguised to keep their identity a secret. The disguises also gave the council an air of mystery, and many of its members delighted in the confusion, making sure no one entered or exited the chamber without being bewildered as to where they had been and whom they had seen and often even what they had said and heard. Of course, in a city populated by magi, such efforts were not always successful, as &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; proved with little effort.\nSince the reconstruction of Dalaran following the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the Council has chosen to abandon the secrecy of its members. At some point after the attack on Theramore, &lt;a href=\"Vargoth\"&gt;Vargoth&lt;/a&gt; joined the council. Near the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt;, Khadgar called for a vote to have the Horde return to Dalaran. Jaina was vehemently opposed, especially after the events of the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, but she was outnumbered with only &lt;a href=\"Ansirem%20Runeweaver\"&gt;Ansirem Runeweaver&lt;/a&gt; voting no alongside her. Jaina left Dalaran in anger and Khadgar became the council's leader. When the council next assembled, &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; was seen as the sixth in Jaina's place. Most of the Council participated actively in the war against the Legion, with Modera and Kalecgos even joining the &lt;a href=\"Tirisgarde\"&gt;Tirisgarde&lt;/a&gt; themselves, empowering &lt;a href=\"Artifact\"&gt;Artifact&lt;/a&gt; weapons and gifting the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Spellwing\"&gt;Violet Spellwing&lt;/a&gt; to players who personally helped defeat &lt;a href=\"Argus%20the%20Unmaker\"&gt;Argus the Unmaker&lt;/a&gt;, an unprecedented victory which decisively ended their long campaign as well as the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter they briefly reunited in Dalaran shortly before the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, Kalecgos offered to allow Jaina to take his place on the Council, and while the two parted on good terms, she rejected his offer to rejoin their ranks, apparently still disagreeing with the Council's actions and reasoning.\nDuring the events of , archmages &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Vargoth\"&gt;Vargoth&lt;/a&gt; traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;. Khadgar and Kalecgos focused their attentions on the &lt;a href=\"Azure%20Span\"&gt;Azure Span&lt;/a&gt;; attempting to unlock the secrets of the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; and later reunite said flight. The two later joined the rest of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Aspects&lt;/a&gt; in fighting against the &lt;a href=\"Primal%20Incarnates\"&gt;Primal Incarnates&lt;/a&gt;; specifically &lt;a href=\"Raszageth\"&gt;Raszageth&lt;/a&gt;, as they led the charge into the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20the%20Incarnates\"&gt;Vault of the Incarnates&lt;/a&gt;. Vargoth travelled to &lt;a href=\"Algeth%27ar%20Academy\"&gt;Algeth'ar Academy&lt;/a&gt;, convening with several other academics such as &lt;a href=\"Chief%20Telemancer%20Oculeth\"&gt;Chief Telemancer Oculeth&lt;/a&gt; as they studied draconic knowledge.\nDuring the events leading up to \",\" Archmage Khadgar and several members experienced a Radiant Song as Azeroth called out to them and several others for aid in the upcoming conflict and after determining that the threat was being caused by Xal'atath, The Harbinger; the Council of Six moved to launch an expedition towards the Titan facility of Khaz Algar and prepped accordingly. Unbeknownst to them, one of their own members had been dead for several years as Xal'atath used their form as a disguise to hide among the Council in order to destroy it from within when they moved the city of Dalaran. During the ensuing fight between Dalaran and the Nerubians loyal to the Harbinger, Dalaran was eventually destroyed.\nIn the RPG.\nThe council meets to discuss important issues and vote on matters \u2014 no single member holds sway, and the majority vote decides every issue. In case of a tie, the members reconvene a day later, during which interval each member considers his or her vote and all relevant information."}

When Dagran takes control of the kingdom, the Council is to come to an end. As the name suggests, its members are referred to as the Three Hammers.\nMembers.\nThe Council of Three Hammers is so named because it is composed of a representative from each of the three major &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarven&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"clan\"&gt;clan&lt;/a&gt;s:\nHistory.\nCreation.\nIn the wake of &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;King Magni&lt;/a&gt;'s petrification, Queen-Regent of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;Dark Iron&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Moira%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Moira Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt; returned to Ironforge with her infant son &lt;a href=\"Dagran%20Thaurissan%20II\"&gt;Dagran Thaurissan II&lt;/a&gt; to claim the throne. Backed by the Dark Iron clan, she ruled the city arrogantly and with an iron fist. She held all the people of Ironforge hostage, leading to the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;'s intervention. Despite Moira being a tyrant, she was nonetheless the legitimate heir to the Ironforge throne, and her death would put into question the succession of the throne. This lead to more chaos and conflict. If she lived, through her and her son the three dwarven clans could unite. &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; agreed to spare Moira's life on the grounds that she'd have to earn her people's respect if she is to be a leader and unite the dwarves. To take into account the opinions of all dwarves, Varian called for the formation of the Council of Three Hammers: Queen-Regent Moira of the Dark Iron, High Thane &lt;a href=\"Falstad%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Falstad&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard%20clan\"&gt;Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;. Despite their varying backgrounds and ideological differences, the three representatives pledged to rule jointly for the good of Ironforge. They are now most likely the heads of the &lt;a href=\"Senate%20of%20Ironforge\"&gt;Senate of Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;.\nFire and Iron.\nUpon returning from &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, former Thane Kurdran Wildhammer took High Thane Falstad's position on the Council. The other two clans decreed that the &lt;a href=\"Hammer%20of%20the%20High%20King\"&gt;Hammer of the High King&lt;/a&gt; be reforged; however, it was discovered by &lt;a href=\"Advisor%20Belgrum\"&gt;Advisor Belgrum&lt;/a&gt; that the parchment was faked and that the three so-called pieces of the hammer could have come after the civil war. Worse yet, the head and crystal fragments were also fakes. In spite of this, the majority of the Council agreed to continue, keeping the hammer pieces' validity from the public.\nKurdran disagreed with that action, and he quietly removed the Wildhammer scepter that was to be used as the hammer's handle. He confronted Moira, who implied that she planned the Wildhammer dwarves alienating the other two clans, so she could strengthen relations between the Dark Iron and the Bronzebeards. On the day of the reforging, the scepter was discovered missing, Kurdran admitting to stealing it. Instead of letting the lie continue, he shattered the scepter into pieces with his &lt;a href=\"Stormhammer\"&gt;Stormhammer&lt;/a&gt;. Kurdran declared that the union of the dwarven clans shouldn't start with reforging a hammer that could be fractured again. He proposed that the dwarven clans move forward from the past and unite with a fresh start. Muradin gladly joined him, and Moira resented that she had no choice but to publicly help in fracturing their fragments.\nKurdran chose to leave the council, recognizing Falstad as the better dwarf to represent the Wildhammer clan.\nThe Cataclysm era.\nAfter Dark Iron dwarves' attack on the &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20Airfield\"&gt;Ironforge Airfield&lt;/a&gt;, relations tensed among the Council members, with Falstad and Muradin calling out Moira for being unable to control her own people. Moira revealed that some of her people are still firmly in the grips of the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;, and she quickly recognized that the only person who could coordinate such an attack was &lt;a href=\"Ambassador%20Slaghammer\"&gt;Ambassador Slaghammer&lt;/a&gt;. Slaghammer was promptly arrested for treason.\nDuring this time the council met &lt;a href=\"Li%20Li%20Stormstout\"&gt;Li Li Stormstout&lt;/a&gt;, who was visiting the city to speak to King Magni. Li Li demonstrated sarcastically incredible respect for the Council, saying \"You have proven to be no less than the proverbial hard place to King Magni's literal rock, and I do feel so honored to find myself in between the two.\" Moira's response was drowned out by Kurdran's laughter, and Li Li left before Muradin called his fellow council members to order.\nTides of War.\n&lt;a href=\"Attack%20on%20Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;When Theramore was in danger of being invaded by the Horde&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; asked the Council for warriors and perhaps gryphons to help defend the city. The Council sent &lt;a href=\"Thaddus%20Stoutblow\"&gt;General Stoutblow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horran%20Redmane\"&gt;General Redmane&lt;/a&gt; (from the Wildhammer and Bronzebeard clans respectively) in command of their dwarven warriors to help in the defense effort.\nBlood in the Snow.\nOne day, King Varian's had discovered that &lt;a href=\"Zandalar%20tribe\"&gt;Zandalari trolls&lt;/a&gt; threatened the dwarven capital by rallying the &lt;a href=\"Frostmane%20tribe\"&gt;Frostmane trolls&lt;/a&gt; against them. The King believed that if he aided the dwarves against the trolls that they would allow him more troops for his campaign against the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. He did not realize how little the dwarven clans trusted each other. As he beseeched the Council of Three Hammers to proactively take the fight to the Frostmane, both Muradin and Falstad declined for fear of Moira taking advantage of their warriors' absence from the city. The King argued that Ironforge would fall under siege if no one helps. &lt;a href=\"Moira%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Moira Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt; offered aid to prove her clan's loyalty to Ironforge and to the Alliance. And so Moira and King Varian set out in the snow to save the city, leaving the other leaders to think about their actions.\nQueen Moira with her Dark Iron dwarves and King Varian with his party of Alliance champions worked together to attack the Frostmane on &lt;a href=\"Shimmer%20Ridge\"&gt;Shimmer Ridge&lt;/a&gt;. Upon their return, the other dwarven leaders were ashamed of their behavior and vowed never again to allow such fear and distrust to cloud their judgment. With newfound trust for each other, the Council pledged the full strength of Ironforge to the Alliance cause.\nThe Trial of Garrosh Hellscream.\nThe Council of Three Hammers was among the audience during the trial of &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;. Their creation is shown during one of the visions of the trial.\nThe Council of Three Hammers sent &lt;a href=\"Fenella%20Darkvire\"&gt;Fenella Darkvire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Carrick%20Irongrin\"&gt;Carrick Irongrin&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Fendrig%20Redbeard\"&gt;Fendrig Redbeard&lt;/a&gt; to aid in the reconstruction of the Jade Serpent statue. The operation itself was left in Moira's hand, signaling the greater deal of trust her fellow council members receive her with.\nThe Legion returns.\nWhen Magni Bronzebeard awakened, dwarves of all clans in Ironforge were in uproar as they were unsure what will happen with the new government. Moira was adamant in ensuring every clan would remain in the city. Magni thankfully had no intention to rule, as he had to prepare the world for the third invasion of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nExploring Azeroth.\nThe Council of Three Hammer sent a letter to &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Flynn%20Fairwind\"&gt;Flynn Fairwind&lt;/a&gt; to welcome them in &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;, inviting them to take advantage of their hospitality to drink and relax, while ensuring that they want to strengthen the links between &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; and their kingdom by letting the Spymaster access the vaults containing the collections of artifacts, weapons and secret documents to show that everything is protected and in order.\nTactics.\nNow the main ruling body of the dwarves, the Council of Three Hammers serve as the faction leaders for Ironforge. The battle with Muradin, Moira and Falstad is somewhat comparable to the battle with &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Rommath\"&gt;Grand Magister Rommath&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Halduron%20Brightwing\"&gt;Halduron Brightwing&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt;, in terms of the triple boss fight mechanics. Two tanks are recommended, one to hold Muradin and one to hold Moira and Falstad. All three should be tanked within their throne room.\nThe two major threats to the raid are Muradin, who boasts the highest amount of health of the three, and whether or not there is relatively high player traffic in Ironforge. Without player interference, the quickest strategy is to first focus on Moira. She will use priest abilities, though their potency can be easily ignored if she is given the raid's full attention. Once she is down, the raid should focus on Falstad. Falstad will make use of various Wildhammer &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; abilities and hits far harder than Moira. Without Moira's healing he should go down fairly quickly.\nFinally, Muradin should be dealt with. Like &lt;a href=\"Magni\"&gt;Magni&lt;/a&gt; before him, Muradin has both the Avatar and AoE pushback abilities, in addition to a storm bolt. With the other two dead and with low enemy player input, Muradin will follow suit and the raid will have done its job."}

It's described as an order of &lt;a href=\"sorcerer\"&gt;sorcerer&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe Order was formed by the most powerful of the high elves in order to prevent and safeguard &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; from the demons, something that their &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; ancestors couldn't do. They derived their name from their meeting place in the &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt;; specifically, they met in &lt;a href=\"Venomweb%20Vale\"&gt;Venomweb Vale&lt;/a&gt;. They also used the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20the%20Guardian\"&gt;Hall of the Guardian&lt;/a&gt; as a base.\nHistory.\nOver 3,000 years ago an &lt;a href=\"elven\"&gt;elven&lt;/a&gt; society called the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Silvermoon\"&gt;Council of Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;, that had long ago sworn to forestall any full return by the &lt;a href=\"Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt;, met with the most powerful wizards of Magocrat lords of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; and formed the Council of Tirisfal, whose quest was to hunt those demons who had already arrived, and prevent others from entering Azeroth. For a great period of time, the Order's oldest members were three high elves, among them &lt;a href=\"Relfthra\"&gt;Relfthra&lt;/a&gt;. They were in a position of authority even during the guardianship of &lt;a href=\"Scavell\"&gt;Scavell&lt;/a&gt;, and up until the purge of the Tirisfalen.\nThe Council of Tirisfal channeled their power into a single mortal to battle the demons. This person was called the Spearhead, with the Council channeling a part of their power into them. However, this put the Council at risk as they had to be within close range of the Spearhead while channeling their power. More than 2,600 years before the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, the Spearhead was reworked into the Guardian by &lt;a href=\"Alodi\"&gt;Alodi&lt;/a&gt;, by restructuring the transfer ceremony used to link the Council of Tirisfal with the Spearhead. He did this by using a spell that &lt;a href=\"Meryl%20Winterstorm\"&gt;Meryl&lt;/a&gt; and he devised that will allow the Council of Tirisfal and the Spearhead to link at great distances. This allowed the Guardian to engage the enemy with the Council of Tirisfal's power and safety intact and out of harm's way. The spell would later be applied to a device known as the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20the%20Guardian\"&gt;Forge of the Guardian&lt;/a&gt; and used for all Guardians from that day on, until the day Aegwynn refused to return her power. To reflect this change, the Council of Tirisfal altered the title of Spearhead to Guardian-- of the Council's power, safety, trust, and defense of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen there was an absence of the Guardian, the Council called upon the &lt;a href=\"Tirisgarde\"&gt;Tirisgarde&lt;/a&gt; - the elite mage-guard of Dalaran. The Tirisgarde was first created to hunt down Aegwynn when she went rogue because she grew suspicious of the order and believed that the council was abusing its power by manipulating the politics of the &lt;a href=\"Seven%20kingdoms\"&gt;human kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Tarthen\"&gt;Tarthen&lt;/a&gt; stole the greatstaff &lt;a href=\"Ebonchill\"&gt;Ebonchill&lt;/a&gt; and went to find Aegwynn who bested him and encased him in a layer of diamond-hard ice. Despite the hot weather in &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt;, Tarthen was still frozen solid when the Council members found him. It took considerable effort to thaw his corpse and free Ebonchill from his lifeless hand. The magi then returned the staff to its owner\nThe two most famous Guardians of Tirisfal by far were the last two ones \u2014 &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt; and her son &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;. Medivh possessed by &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; killed many named and unnamed members of the Order throughout &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; during the time of the First War before he was slain. It is, however, known that Aegwynn revived an uncorrupted Medivh, so theoretically he still lives. While it may be possible for Medivh to pass the mantle of Guardian to another, it was he who destroyed the Order with the specific purpose of breaking the chain, the one thing he and Sargeras agreed upon. His final known speech echoes this sentiment, as he wished to teach the world that it no longer needed Guardians.\nThe New Council of Tirisfal.\nIn view of the growing threat of &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;his masters&lt;/a&gt;, it was decided by &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Meryl%20Felstorm\"&gt;Meryl Felstorm&lt;/a&gt; to reform the Council of Tirisfal. The three also planned to recruit &lt;a href=\"Maraad\"&gt;Maraad&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Broll%20Bearmantle\"&gt;Broll Bearmantle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; for the new order, but Thrall and Khadgar were unavailable. The reformed Council did battle with Cho'gall at &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"Med%27an\"&gt;Med'an&lt;/a&gt; as their Guardian. Unfortunately, the new Council didn't prove to be as binding as the original, and most of its members went their separate ways after Cho'gall's defeat. As for Med'an, he returned the Guardian power to the Council. The Council has yet to choose a new Guardian.\nReformation of the Tirisgarde.\nAfter Kathra'natir escapes from his body, Meryl, the ghost of Alodi, and a mage &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; procure the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20the%20Guardian\"&gt;Forge of the Guardian&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Hold\"&gt;Violet Hold&lt;/a&gt;. Within the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20the%20Guardian\"&gt;Hall of the Guardian&lt;/a&gt;, Meryl declares the Council's Tirisgarde reformed, with magi from across Azeroth coming in to boost its numbers. As Meryl declares, the Tirisgarde's largest concern at the moment is the hunting of Kathra'natir, as his time spent within Meryl provided him with knowledge of the Council's secrets.\nThe &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;Conjuror of the Tirisgarde&lt;/a&gt; witnessed visions of the members of &lt;a href=\"Alodi\"&gt;Alodi&lt;/a&gt;'s Council in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; while wielding &lt;a href=\"Ebonchill\"&gt;Ebonchill&lt;/a&gt;, Alodi's staff. The visions mistook them for Alodi himself (or simply replayed events from history with the Conjuror playing the part of the old Guardian), and helped to empower the staff, albeit somewhat reluctantly."}

After a period of civil war, the heads of three families formed an uneasy coalition and tried to rule the empire together. Though they did not often agree, there was peace in Zandalar. Briefly.\nDuring the final era of the Council of Tribes, a &lt;a href=\"plague%20of%20corrupted%20blood\"&gt;blood plague&lt;/a&gt; broke out, killing thousands of &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s. It was deemed that the bodies, too polluted for proper burial, would instead be burned and kept in special urns. As time progressed, this method became commonplace among the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; in disposing of their dead. After the great plague, there were still those who clung to the magics of the blood god. They tested their magics and perfected them. One such relic was a totem, which when concentrated upon, would drain not just the life from their enemies, but also their blood, infusing the caster with it and altering them in unusual ways. This was the dawn of who the Zandalari call, \"the &lt;a href=\"blood%20troll\"&gt;blood troll&lt;/a&gt;s\".\nSpeculation.\nThe Council of Tribes' rule was likely a result of the failed attempt of the Zandalari and &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; to take &lt;a href=\"Uldum\"&gt;Uldum&lt;/a&gt;, as the activation of the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Origination\"&gt;Forge of Origination&lt;/a&gt; is described as killing most of both empires' leadership and leaving massive power vacuums."}

They gathered together after &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;'s defeat to teach all warlocks advanced forms of &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; stolen from their defeated foes. These powers would be shared with each other to further aid their kind against any future threats to Azeroth. During the &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, from their &lt;a href=\"Order%20Halls\"&gt;order hall&lt;/a&gt; on the conquered demonic world of &lt;a href=\"Dreadscar%20Rift\"&gt;Dreadscar Rift&lt;/a&gt;, they fought the Legion alongside the other &lt;a href=\"Class%20Order\"&gt;class orders&lt;/a&gt; united as the &lt;a href=\"Armies%20of%20Legionfall\"&gt;Armies of Legionfall&lt;/a&gt;. They are known as the takers of souls, commanders of demons, and masters of the dark arts.\nHistory.\nBackground.\nAt first, the six warlocks refused to cooperate, bickering and tossing blame as easily as curses. Finally, after several nights, the human &lt;a href=\"Kanrethad%20Ebonlocke\"&gt;Kanrethad Ebonlocke&lt;/a&gt; spoke out about how the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, and various organizations around the world such as the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; had trained for war and kept getting stronger and stronger over time. He told them that they needed to do the same and that together, they would become more powerful than they would have ever been alone.\nAfter much debate, it was decided that each warlock would be partnered with another in order to obtain new powers, that would then be shared with the rest of the Council. Although not every warlock in the Council liked each other, they knew that what they would be doing would greatly benefit them all. To make sure greed did not set in with individual members, it was agreed that any warlock that broke the contract, failed to return, or returned alone, would be struck down by the rest of the Council and their soul would be banished forever.\nShadowlands.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the Council of the Black Harvest makes its appearance in the warlock section of the &lt;a href=\"Training%20Hall\"&gt;Training Hall&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Barracks%20%28Orgrimmar%29\"&gt;Barracks&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"Laphandrus%20Voidheart\"&gt;Laphandrus Voidheart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Evelyn%20Thorn\"&gt;Evelyn Thorn&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Kazak%20Darkscream\"&gt;Kazak Darkscream&lt;/a&gt; as warlock trainers.\nMembers.\nCouncil.\nEach of the original members witnessed one of the great threats to Azeroth.\nTroops.\nThey deploy Packs of Imps, Swarm of Wild Imps, &lt;a href=\"Black%20Harvest%20Acolyte\"&gt;Black Harvest Acolyte&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Black%20Harvest%20Invoker\"&gt;Black Harvest Invoker&lt;/a&gt;s, and Felguard Brutes.\nOriginal storyline in MoP.\nFormer WoW game designer &lt;a href=\"Alexander%20Brazie\"&gt;Alexander Brazie&lt;/a&gt;, also known as Xelnath, shared the original plans for the quests depicting the adventures of the members of the Council of the Black Harvest during the events of \"Mists of Pandaria\":\n\"Shinfel and Zinnin go into Ahn'Qiraj to investigate the old gods after torturing some twilight dudes to death. Zinnin brings a bunch of Kobolds in explicably. They discover Curse of Enfeeblement, learn Harvest Life from a dying Qiraji. Zinnin attempts to learn a more powerful curse, but goes insane. Shinfel is forced to drag him back to the council to survive.\n\"The Orc and the Worgen go into firelands, build respect for each other after fighting off lava spiders. They literally rip runes off of the walls in Sulfuron, and discover a way to pull lava directly from the well Ragnaros created. This power became cataclysm.\"\n\"The Orc and the Worgen work together to empower Chaos Bolt, and nearly annhilate each other, then discover the power of Ember Tapping to rapidly cauterize their wounds from an imp.\"\n\"The council meets up together, share their powers with the Warlocks of the world. Kanrethad takes the knowledge gained, calls the council a success and proposes a master plan once the Ata'mal crystal was purified in the arcane well of Black Temple. He awaits its completion.\"\n\"Player brings the crystal, transfers too much power into Kanrethad. He loses control, summons a Pit Lord and passes out. While fighting the pit lord, you're overwhelmed, when the Ata'mal crystal fuses with your being, allowing you to control the Fel Energies of the Pit Lord without being completely corrupted. You use that power to defeat the pit lord, Kanrethad recovers, horribly wounded and acknowledges your mastery.\"\n\"He questions his ability to handle the power alone. Summons the council and uses you, rather than him, as the focus spell to open the portal to Xerrath. Inside, you lead the council in daily quests to drive the legion out and conquer the island.\"\n\"My hope was to create a group of Warlocks who are power-hungry, driven and powerful, but aren't completely consumed by that power... for once. Maybe only Player Warlocks can be that kind of character.\""}

Ritssyn spoke on behalf of the Council of the Black Harvest, who requested their aid, and explained that with the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s\u00a0invasion, it was painfully clear that their only hope was to grow stronger. The Council planned to tap into the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and call forth much more powerful demon allies. The ritual was ready, but they were short one number, since the unfortunate fate of their former leader. No doubt the adventurer had heard of what befell\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Kanrethad%20Ebonlocke\"&gt;Kanrethad Ebonlocke&lt;/a&gt;. They would be his replacement. They would be the Sixth of the Black Harvest.\nThe ritual of summoning.\nThe meeting was to take place at the Circle of Wills in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;'s\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Underbelly\"&gt;Underbelly&lt;/a&gt;. As the warlock hero walked down the sewers, they noticed large amounts of &lt;a href=\"imp\"&gt;imp&lt;/a&gt;s and other &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s terrorizing the guards. They had been summoned en masse by the Council as a distriction. The gnome &lt;a href=\"Zelifrax%20Wobblepox\"&gt;Zelifrax Wobblepox&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0was standing in the center of the Circle of Wills, with Ritssyn,\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Zinnin%20Smythe\"&gt;Zinnin Smythe&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Jubeka%20Shadowbreaker\"&gt;Jubeka Shadowbreaker&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Shinfel%20Blightsworn\"&gt;Shinfel Blightsworn&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0standing around the edges. It was time to begin the ritual, claimed Ritssyn. The summoning they would perform that day would be more challenging than they had ever known or seen before. The powerful warlocks repositioned themselves in a semicircle, with\u00a0Zelifrax, the master summoner,\u00a0in the middle. He would lead the ritual. And he had studied the rites.\nThe portal caught fire. Zelifrex had stuttered, ruining the ritual. Suddenly, a gigantic &lt;a href=\"pit%20lord\"&gt;pit lord&lt;/a&gt; violently emerged from the portal, knocking back and stunning everyone except Zelifrax. The gnome ran up to the pit lord and began casting a spell of binding. The demon, &lt;a href=\"Jagganoth\"&gt;Jagganoth&lt;/a&gt;, grabbed Zelifrax in one hand and threw him across the room, killing him on the spot. Five &lt;a href=\"Jailer%20%28demon%29\"&gt;jailer&lt;/a&gt;s emerged from the portal behind the pitlord and imprisoned the warlocks with magical chains, before taking them back through the portal they came from.\nDreadscar Rift.\nThe Sixth awoke in a demonic cage, with Ritssyn next to them. The Sixth spared the brunt of the pit lord's assault, but the rest of them weren't so lucky. Ritssyn explained that they were prisoners on Jagganoth's own personal Legion world, &lt;a href=\"Dreadscar%20Rift\"&gt;Dreadscar Rift&lt;/a&gt;. The orc tried casting a spell, but kneeled, the pain from his wounds preventing him from focusing. The Sixth thus turned to the &lt;a href=\"Jailer%20%28demon%29\"&gt;jailer&lt;/a&gt; demon that roamed nearby, and cast a spell of enslavement. The jailer was forced to free them from their cage, after which the spell broke immediately, leading to the warlocks killing the demon. Walking over to the center of the platform, a scream sounded from the top of the pit. Ritssyn recognized &lt;a href=\"Jubeka\"&gt;Jubeka&lt;/a&gt;, and believed the others might still be alive. He was too wounded however to go with the Sixth, and decided to stay behind while they would find the other captive members of the Council. Ritssyn would not be anyone's burden.\nCalydus and the Council.\nAs the Sixth pressed forward, a &lt;a href=\"wyrmtongue\"&gt;wyrmtongue&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Calydus\"&gt;Calydus&lt;/a&gt;, appeared. The small demon told the warlock that he was servant to the cruel Overlord of the Dreadscar, Jagganoth. The pitlord abused and mocked \"poor Calydus\". But the warlock could be his undoing. Calydus would distract the sentries, giving them time to find their friends. Calydus thus disguised himself as a dancing, naked male gnome and ran past the two &lt;a href=\"felguard\"&gt;felguard&lt;/a&gt;s stationed at the top of the pit, causing them to follow him. Thanks to the distraction, the Sixth ran up out of the pit and headed directly west to find Jubeka, who had been strapped to a Legion structure and was being terrorized by two &lt;a href=\"felhound\"&gt;felhound&lt;/a&gt;s. The Sixth took care of the demons, and freed Jubeka. Together, they found &lt;a href=\"Zinnin\"&gt;Zinnin&lt;/a&gt; who was being interrogated by an &lt;a href=\"inquisitor\"&gt;inquisitor&lt;/a&gt; demon, who had become frustrated with trying to break the &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt;'s silence. Finally, they saved &lt;a href=\"Shinfel\"&gt;Shinfel&lt;/a&gt; who was being tortured by demons too.\nThe Council members reunited, a worried Jubeka asked where &lt;a href=\"Ritssyn\"&gt;Ritssyn&lt;/a&gt; was, to which Shinfel replied that the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0was gravely injured and could not follow. But she believed that the four of them would suffice to control the &lt;a href=\"pit%20lord\"&gt;pit lord&lt;/a&gt;. That was still their goal, after all. Zinnin expressed himself through his silence. Shinfel called him a stubborn worgen and accepted that escape would be their first priority. But if the opportunity to enslave the demon presented itself, she would take it.\nA short distance away, two &lt;a href=\"Jailer%20%28demon%29\"&gt;jailer&lt;/a&gt;s were standing guard in front of a &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; barrier powered by two crystals. The warlocks killed the demons and deactivated the crystals, then proceeded up the ridge and met with Calydus. Shinfel asked what this miserable creature was, to which the demon replied that he was a friend. He told them that &lt;a href=\"Jagganoth\"&gt;Jagganoth&lt;/a&gt; hunted powerful weapons, weapons that they could use to rule this place. Shinfel liked the sound of that. Jubeka emitted doubts, however, but Calydus told them that they had to trust him, and took them down the archives.\nThe secrets of the Dreadscar.\nThe archive housed several large, floating,\u00a0felbound tomes, with the &lt;a href=\"Tome%20of%20Blighted%20Implements\"&gt;Tome of Blighted Implements&lt;/a&gt; floating in the middle of the area. Jubeka ran over to inspect the lesser tomes. She was in awe, thinking of all they could learn from these tomes. Not to mention the power they could give them, she added. Calydus approached the Tome of Blighted Implements, a guide to the location of powerful weapons that Jagganoth was trying to hunt down. Calydus told them to take it, before the pit lord found them.\nBut they were discovered. Jagganoth suddenly teleported in behind Shinfel, causing Calydus to cower in terror while Jubeka and Zinnin prepared to fight. The pit lord grabbed Shinfel, much like he did with Zelifrax, and threw her across the area. Jagganoth lept up into the air and landed in the center of the archive, knocking Calydus, Jubeka, Zinnin and the Sixth back the way they came.\nThe pitlord's wrath.\nA fel barrier appeared, blocking the way back into the archive. Jagganoth exploded with rage and fel meteors began raining down on the Council. They all ran towards the gateway they came from, but Zinnin was knocked to the ground by a meteor, and Jubeka after him. With her last forces she told the Sixth to go on and close the portal behind them.\nJust as the last remaining warlock and &lt;a href=\"Calydus\"&gt;Calydus&lt;/a&gt; were about to reach the portal, an immense infernal emerged from a meteor before the gateway and attacked them. It was however defeated and, after crossing the portal, they arrived back in the sewers of Dalaran with Calydus. The gateway to Dreadscar Rift behind them had been shattered. They were safe, for the pit lord could not pursue them anymore.\nCalydus told the Sixth that they had to find one of the hunted weapons in order to defeat Jagganoth. The book was the key to the Council's salvation, and to absolute power. It held within information about many relics too dangerous to the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0to leave unchecked. Calydus told the Sixth, the sole free member of the Council, to hunt down one of three powerful &lt;a href=\"artifact\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt; described in the guide he stole from Jagganoth \u2014 &lt;a href=\"Ulthalesh%2C%20the%20Deadwind%20Harvester\"&gt;Ulthalesh, the Deadwind Harvester&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Skull%20of%20the%20Man%27ari\"&gt;Skull of the Man'ari&lt;/a&gt;, or the &lt;a href=\"Scepter%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Scepter of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;.\nBecoming the Overlord.\nNow equipped with a powerful artifact, the Sixth returned to Dreadscar Rift to confront Jagganoth, and possibly save their friends. Calydus told them that if they managed to take the heart of the Overlord, his army would be theirs to command. Jagganoth greeted the warlock with a grim announcement. He told the Sixth that it was too late to save the other Council members, for they had been sent to the demon's lord, the &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mephistroth\"&gt;Mephistroth&lt;/a&gt;, as a gift for his amusement.\nThe two clashed, but the newfound powers of the Sixth granted by their artifact eventually overcame the pit lord and allowed the Sixth to kill him. The warlock approached the giant corpse left before them, and carved out the demon's molten heart. It was brought to the altar of the Dreadscar known as the &lt;a href=\"Felblood%20Altar\"&gt;Felblood Altar&lt;/a&gt; at the Seat of the Overlord, at which point an image of Mephistroth appeared.\nDozens and dozens of felguard approached, menacing, walking up the ridge. The most massive one, &lt;a href=\"Bulzan\"&gt;Bulzan&lt;/a&gt;, bowed down before the Sixth of the Black Harvest. Then all bowed down. By killing Jagganoth and exposing his heart to all, the Sixth had become the new Overlord of the Dreadscar, and the demonic army had come to serve at their command.\nPlanning a future.\nJagganoth's corpse was chained above the altar for all to see. Calydus explained that the altar at the Seat of the Overlord was formed of the pit lord's very blood, and was thus charged with his power. This power could be transferred to their new weapon. The warlock thus approached it, and claimed Jagganoth's power for his own.\nThey could not rest, however, for a new danger lied around the corner. The Sixth had indeed caught the attention of\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Mephistroth\"&gt;Mephistroth&lt;/a&gt;, who surely wished to seek revenge for losing his general. They would need more than the Dreadscar to stand against him, they would need powerful warlocks such as those of the Council who were captured. Calydus guided the Sixth down the ramp to the pit where they were originally encaged. There, they found &lt;a href=\"Ritssyn\"&gt;Ritssyn&lt;/a&gt;'s corpse lying on the ground. He had not survived his wounds.\nThe Sixth started casting a powerful spell, and resurrected Ritssyn with a soulstone. The orc immediately asked about the rest of the Council, and was brought up to date with all that had happened. Ritssyn could not believe his own eyes, for one warlock to control an entire army of demons was beyond what he thought the Council capable of, and beyond what they had hoped for.\nWhere the\u00a0Council\u00a0had failed, the Sixth found untold success. Looking to rebuild, Ritssyn would send agents out to locate the whereabouts of the captured Council members, as well as any other warlocks who might have been able to aid the cause. At the scrying pool, Ritssyn said that with their members\u00a0scattered and\u00a0the dreadlord on their heels, they needed to prepare for &lt;a href=\"Mephistroth\"&gt;Mephistroth&lt;/a&gt;'s retaliation, who was terribly enraged since he had lost one of his most powerful lieutenants - Jagganoth - and &lt;a href=\"Dreadscar%20Rift\"&gt;Dreadscar Rift&lt;/a&gt;. Ritssyn claimed that they needed the Sixth to take leadership of the Council, and as such stepped down from his position to name them the First of the Council of the Black Harvest.\nPreparations.\nAs the First returned to &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; after missions on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;, a Black Harvest acolyte intercepted and informed them that Calydus was eager to speak with them. Returning to &lt;a href=\"Dreadscar%20Rift\"&gt;Dreadscar Rift&lt;/a&gt;, the tiny demon told the warlock that they were now in a very powerful, but lonely position, for they were the First of a Council whose members were missing. They needed to find others, others who would be drawn to their power, others who would follow them and stay at their side.\nCalydus was one of those. The demon was thankful for he was no longer suffering under the cruel hand of Jagganoth. He now had the choice of who to follow. He thus pledged himself to the new Overlord. Ritssyn Flamescowl, familiar with the burden of leadership, was honored to serve as Second of the Black Harvest.\nGakin the Darkbinder then showed the First the Dreadscar Battle Plans, used to complete vital assignments across the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;. If they wished to rebuild the\u00a0Council, they had to start by locating its missing members. &lt;a href=\"Ritssyn\"&gt;Ritssyn&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Calydus\"&gt;Calydus&lt;/a&gt; were thus sent to interrogate the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s minions. They were successful in getting information, though they didn't know how reliable it was yet considering how it was obtained.\nThe First then asked &lt;a href=\"Imp%20Mother%20Dyala\"&gt;Imp Mother Dyala&lt;/a&gt; to\u00a0summon &lt;a href=\"imp\"&gt;imp&lt;/a&gt;s which were sent out into the field along with champions on a routine scouting mission. The\u00a0mission was more successful than expected, as the troops were able to rescue\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Archivist%20Melinda\"&gt;Archivist Melinda&lt;/a&gt;, a brilliant strategist. In thanks, she agreed to lend her skill to the Black Harvest's cause. Gakin described her as somewhat of an anomaly, as not many &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; chose the path of the warlock. What made her even more unique was her meticulous study of their craft. Melinda claimed that there were many things she could do to help strengthen and upgrade &lt;a href=\"Dreadscar%20Rift\"&gt;Dreadscar Rift&lt;/a&gt;.\nA plan of action.\nRitssyn told the First that the Black Harvest\u00a0archives contained an immeasurable amount of magical knowledge that had been collected from various sources over time. He found it reasonable to think that somewhere among the countless scrolls they could find something to aid them in their mission to rescue the remaining Council members. The search was exhausting, but it was necessary. They\u00a0recovered a tome that detailed the process of creating a demonic gateway. It had the power to access any demon world, assuming they knew where to direct it.\nSuch a gateway could be used to locate and retrieve their colleagues. Channeling the gateway would require the assistance of someone with intimate knowledge of the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Ritssyn knew of such a warlock, though he imagined her blood still boiled upon hearing his name. He thus suggested that it might be best if the First was the one to request her help.\nKira Iresoul.\nThe First travelled to &lt;a href=\"Azsuna\"&gt;Azsuna&lt;/a&gt; to meet &lt;a href=\"Kira%20Iresoul\"&gt;Kira Iresoul&lt;/a&gt;, who said that she could see that her old mentor still refused to do \"his own dirty work\", someone in Ritssyn's position couldn't be seen consorting with a purported member of the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Argus%20Wake\"&gt;Argus Wake&lt;/a&gt;, she claimed. But as much as she relished the idea of Ritssyn needing her help, she did not barter in kindness and favors. Her currency was power and knowledge.\nKira explained that something of personal value had been taken from her, and her work there could not continue until she got it back. To most it would appear to be an ordinary stone, but it was so much more than a simple rock - it lived, and breathed. The nearby\u00a0&lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0had been snatching anything with any sort of magical significance, her stone included. Fortunately, they did not know how to access its power. The First killed many Narashi naga and managed to retrieve the stone, which they returned to Kira, who could see now why Ritssyn liked to \"send them on errands\".\nThe Bloodstone.\nKira explained that &lt;a href=\"bloodstones\"&gt;bloodstones&lt;/a&gt; contain a great deal of power that can only be awakened once they are fed. Yet this stone did not feast on fish and cakes. It hungered for blood: the more powerful, the better. There was an infestation of demons just east of their location. If the First nourished her stone with their blood, she would be able to unlock its power. Dozens of demons were massacred, and enormous quantities of blood were fed to the rubyred gem.\nThe stone sated, Kira hoped to use its power to bend the will of demons that would otherwise not be so easily controlled. This was still a theory however, for she had never witnessed the direct effect of the bloodstone's power on a &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;. She had procured a few\u00a0&lt;a href=\"imp\"&gt;imp&lt;/a&gt;s\u00a0that she imprisoned in the cave behind and that made suitable test subjects. When the First channeled the bloodstone's power on them however, the imps died. All subjects died in the testing process. But as the warlock had fulfilled their part of the bargain, it was time for Kira to fulfill hers.\nKira asked the First to warn Ritssyn to keep his distance. She would come to repay her debt to the First, not to speak to the \"hypocrite who chose the Council over his friends\". She first had a few urgent matters to take care of, but she\u00a0claimed that she would soon make her way to &lt;a href=\"Dreadscar%20Rift\"&gt;Dreadscar Rift&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0to aid with the summoning. As they returned to Dreadscar, Ritssyn told them that Kira had travelled faster than the First's words, for she had already arrived moments ago, though her eyes purposely avoided his. In gaining her trust, the First accomplished something he could not. With her help, they would be able to summon the gateway.\nSaving the Council.\nThe plan was a simple one, but it would require great effort. Kira and Ritssyn would summon and sustain the demonic gateway, but the First would have to enter alone and recover the missing Council members. Kira's tolerance for\u00a0Ritssyn\u00a0was low, but she would do her best to remain focused despite having to be in his presence. Kira led the ritual of the gateway's summoning, and Ritssyn acknowledged that her power had grown since the last time they met, to which she replied that he should keep that in mind next time he attempts to speak to her.\nThe First crossed the portal to &lt;a href=\"Niskara\"&gt;Niskara&lt;/a&gt; and managed to save Zinnin Smythe and Jubeka Shadowbreaker, but Shinfel Blightsworn was nowhere to be seen. However, her &lt;a href=\"imp\"&gt;imp&lt;/a&gt; Golarb, in his dying breath, explained to the First that her mistress was gone, taken by the dreadlord &lt;a href=\"Mephistroth\"&gt;Mephistroth&lt;/a&gt;. He tried to help, but he failed. This was terrible news to the Council: if Mephistroth managed to break Shinfel, he would be able to mount a devastating attack against Dreadscar Rift armed with her knowledge and power.\nThe hunt for soulshards.\nThe missing members found their way back to Dreadscar Rift after the First freed them. Jubeka told them that they had saved her more times than she cared to admit. She would be there to return the favor. Similarly, Zinnin's gaze met the First's while standing in quiet contemplation. His stare remained steady as he placed a fisted hand over his chest, making an unspoken oath.\nA ritual of summoning would be able to summon Shinfel to their side, said Ritssyn, but they needed to gather the tools to perform a powerful enough ritual to summon Shinfel back to Dreadscar. They needed to create a powerful anchor. Creating the anchor would require more power than their soul shards could provide. The &lt;a href=\"Dreadscar\"&gt;Dreadscar&lt;/a&gt; troops however were capable of amassing a large amount of soul shards by defeating enemies during their missions. Once they had enough, Ritssyn would be able to harvest the supply and use them to craft the anchor.\nThe Dreadscar were thus sent all over the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt; to protect them against threats such as &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; imps that had taken over &lt;a href=\"Moonclaw%20Vale\"&gt;Moonclaw Vale&lt;/a&gt;, corrupting the once serene glade, &lt;a href=\"Harpy\"&gt;harpies&lt;/a&gt; that were spreading their foul curse throughout &lt;a href=\"Highmountain\"&gt;Highmountain&lt;/a&gt;, pests that had infested &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;'s Underbelly, &lt;a href=\"Black%20Rook%20Hold\"&gt;Black Rook&lt;/a&gt; assassins that were attacking &lt;a href=\"Bradensbrook\"&gt;Bradensbrook&lt;/a&gt;, killing livestock and stealing crops, and a group of poachers that threatened the wildlife in Highmountain.\nThe troops had done well. The Council's soul shard supply was now sufficient enough to create the anchor. The &lt;a href=\"Empowered%20Soul%20Shard\"&gt;Empowered Soul Shard&lt;/a&gt;s did not reflect the face of the viewer, but rather the face of the souls trapped within. &lt;a href=\"Gakin%20the%20Darkbinder\"&gt;Gakin the Darkbinder&lt;/a&gt; explained that acolytes were devoted to helping the First of the Council in any way they could. Recruiter &lt;a href=\"Jared\"&gt;Jared&lt;/a&gt; was in charge of screening candidates, only selecting those that possessed the skills they desired. The First and Jared thus met. He was there to help them build an army. Many new acolytes and apprentice warlocks would be recruited to bolster the Black Harvest's ranks.\nThe soul anchor.\nIn order to create the anchor, they needed to link something of\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Shinfel\"&gt;Shinfel&lt;/a&gt;'s to an unclaimed soul, explained Ritssyn. The soul and the staff would act like a beacon, guiding Shinfel through the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;, and back to &lt;a href=\"Dreadscar%20Rift\"&gt;Dreadscar Rift&lt;/a&gt;. Shinfel's staff could provide them with the link they needed, but the soul would be a bit harder to find. Dwelling within Black Rook hold was an &lt;a href=\"Amalgam%20of%20Souls\"&gt;Amalgam of Souls&lt;/a&gt;, some lost and forgotten. The First ventured into the fortress, and slew the monstrosity, collecting an &lt;a href=\"Unclaimed%20Soul\"&gt;Unclaimed Soul&lt;/a&gt;, forgotten in time, a soul that would never know peace. It would now serve a greater purpose.\nRitssyn bound the soul to Shinfel's staff, allowing it to serve as an anchor in this world. As with most rituals, it required three &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s to complete. The &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; asked Kira if she would assist, to which she sarcastically replied that she would, for she did not abandon a fellow warlock when they might need her most. Ritssyn, Kira and the First thus formed a circle and started summoning a portal. Suddenly, Shinfel appeared. She was mumbling incoherently, clearly in pain. They had Shinfel in their possession, but her mind remained in the hands of her demon captors. Ritssyn did not know what kind of ancient magic they had cursed her with. He had never seen anything like it.\nShinfel's curse.\nIf they had any hope of curing this curse, they needed to know what kind of magic they were dealing with. Fortunately Ritssyn knew of an alchemist\u00a0who earned himself quite the reputation for his unconventional methods. Shunned from\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20peninsula\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0long ago, he believed Mad Ernie the Alchemist had taken up residence in these lands. His knowledge would be the first step to breaking this curse. The First travelled to &lt;a href=\"Val%27sharah\"&gt;Val'sharah&lt;/a&gt;, to the village of &lt;a href=\"Bradensbrook\"&gt;Bradensbrook&lt;/a&gt;. As they approached &lt;a href=\"Marl%27s%20Stead\"&gt;Marl's Stead&lt;/a&gt;, they found an old man yelling that the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; invaders put up quite a fight, but &lt;a href=\"Granny%20Marl\"&gt;Marl&lt;/a&gt; and him wouldn't let the farm be taken.\nThe First asked him if he was Mad Ernie, and the man immediately asked them to keep their voice down. He hadn't gone by that name in years, for he had given up the practice of alchemy some time ago, in favor of a calm life there on the farm. The First told &lt;a href=\"Ernest%20Carlisle\"&gt;Ernest Carlisle&lt;/a&gt; that they were sent by Ritssyn, and that they needed his help curing a doom curse. Ernie sighed. That was a name he thought he'd never hear again. While they did work together with Ritssyn in the past, Ernie was not the man he was before. His priorities were Marl and this farm.\nMad Ernie.\nThings were a bit hectic around the farm. &lt;a href=\"Granny%20Marl\"&gt;Marl&lt;/a&gt; was doing a good job protecting the corn fields, but the commotion gave their goats quite the scare. They dashed out of their pen as soon as the fighting started, and they were now running amuck. Ernest asked the First to round them up for him and he'd do his best to figure out how to handle the curse they were dealing with. The goats all accounted for, Ernest explained that doom curses were \"serious business\", so much so that many warlocks didn't deal in them for some time. The magic grows stronger as time goes on, eventually leading to death. He revealed that only the caster of the curse could remove it. Ernie could craft an elixir that would slow its progression however, but they'd need to collect an assortment of ingredients first: &lt;a href=\"Shimmering%20Pollen%20%28quest%20item%29\"&gt;Shimmering Pollen&lt;/a&gt;, which shimmers and shines in any light, &lt;a href=\"Spotted%20Gloomcap\"&gt;Spotted Gloomcap&lt;/a&gt;, delicate in flavor, yet lethal in large quantities, and &lt;a href=\"Rotwood%20Root\"&gt;Rotwood Root&lt;/a&gt;, oily roots from the &lt;a href=\"Rotwood%20Creeper\"&gt;Rotwood Creeper&lt;/a&gt;, known for their bitterness.\nSaving time.\nErnie mixed them all together, and crafted a &lt;a href=\"Shimmering%20Elixir%20of%20Suspension\"&gt;Shimmering Elixir of Suspension&lt;/a&gt;. The aroma was deceiving, for the concoction was mostly safe for consumption. The afflicted should drink the entire content of the vial, every last drop, and the effects should be immediate. If not, \"well... just tell them they drink at their own risk\", Ernest added. This would only weaken the curse, not cure it. Shinfel was given the potion. Regaining her mind somewhat, Shinfel said that the cursed Eredar Twins would pay for what they did. &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Sacrolash\"&gt;Lady Sacrolash&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and her sister,\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Alythess\"&gt;Alythess&lt;/a&gt;, they were responsible for the foul magic that infected her blood.\nThe Twins were helping &lt;a href=\"Mephistroth\"&gt;Mephistroth&lt;/a&gt; build an army. They intended to attack\u00a0and take &lt;a href=\"Dreadscar%20Rift\"&gt;Dreadscar Rift&lt;/a&gt; back, and steal the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Felblood%20Altar\"&gt;Felblood Altar&lt;/a&gt;. After reflexion, Ritssyn claimed that killing a demon wasn't always the answer. Sometimes, the solution was to control one, or two as the case may be. If they could summon the sisters and bend their will to theirs, it would deliver a devastating blow to\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Mephistroth\"&gt;Mephistroth&lt;/a&gt;'s forces and rid Shinfel of her curse. Kira added that they could use the Bloodstone. It would be powerful enough to control the sisters if they were weakened first.\nA temporary peace.\nShinfel\u00a0thus learned that &lt;a href=\"Ritssyn\"&gt;Ritssyn&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0had made the former Sixth the new First of the Black Harvest. It seemed much had changed in the short time she had been gone. The\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s\u00a0threat was greater than ever. She had witnessed their power firsthand, and knew that they couldn't defeat them as they were now. Shinfel believed that the First would unite them, and together they would strip the Legion of their power.\nSimilarly, Kira found the First's commitment to rebuilding the\u00a0Council commendable, and surprising. They could have left\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Shinfel\"&gt;Shinfel&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0to die and found a replacement, but they looked out for their own. She followed blindly once before, trusting her mentor to look out for her best interests. Instead, he left her to lead a council that admonished her way of doing things. For this, she would never be a follower. Instead, she chose to stand beside the First. Her power would be theirs to use as they saw fit.\nA new recruit.\nHaving lost their master demonologist, &lt;a href=\"Zelifrax%20Wobblepox\"&gt;Zelifrax Wobblepox&lt;/a&gt;, they sought out one powerful enough for the taskt. If they wished to successfully summon the Eredar Twins, they'd need the help of a warlock skilled in summoning greater demons. They could not afford to lose another\u00a0member\u00a0due to inexperience like they had lost Zelifrax. The\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0were swarming with new blood, all hoping to make a name for themselves in this time of chaos. Hopefully among them they could find one worthy of the Black Harvest, said Ritssyn. They thus sent scouts to the forests of &lt;a href=\"Val%27sharah\"&gt;Val'sharah&lt;/a&gt;, the land of &lt;a href=\"Stormheim\"&gt;Stormheim&lt;/a&gt;, the hills of &lt;a href=\"Highmountain\"&gt;Highmountain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Azsuna\"&gt;Azsuna&lt;/a&gt; and the city of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, keeping an eye out for anyone with potential. Their scouting efforts did pay off. Ritssyn had reason to believe that\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Wilfred%20Fizzlebang\"&gt;Wilfred Fizzlebang&lt;/a&gt;'s sister had made her way to Stormheim. If she had half his power, but at least twice his intelligence, then they just might succeed in summoning the\u00a0Twins.\nIn the mean time, Kira made considerable progress with her\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Bloodstone%20%28quest%20item%29\"&gt;Bloodstone&lt;/a&gt;, thanks in part to the First's extensive testing. The stone fed on blood to grow in power, but its ability to control a demon came from consuming a corrupted heart: the more powerful, the better. Within the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20the%20Wardens\"&gt;Vault of the Wardens&lt;/a&gt;, they would find someone with such a heart: &lt;a href=\"Cordana%20Felsong\"&gt;Cordana Felsong&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Felsworn%20Heart\"&gt;Felsworn Heart&lt;/a&gt;, corrupted beyond repair. The Bloodstone devoured it, and grew strong enough to control the Eredar Twins. But first, it had to be fed again.\nGakin told the First that power was all around them, waiting to be harnessed. The First ventured out into the world to reclaim it. They accomplished dozens of missions across the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt; and also slew hundreds of &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s to feed the Bloodstone their &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; blood.\nLulubelle Fizzlebang.\nFizzlebang located in Stormheim, the First came to her. She could tell by their weapon that they were the Council's new leader. She bet they had an amazing story to tell about how they got it. She told them her name, Lulubelle, or Lulu for short, but she would appreciate if they didn't mention to anyone that they saw her. Her location had to be kept secret, at least until she had proof of her innocence. Thanks to the\u00a0legacy\u00a0of her family name, any time some miserable warlock summoned\u00a0&lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s\u00a0they couldn't control, she would get the blame.\nThe scene of her latest \"crime\" was a nearby cave, where unruly\u00a0&lt;a href=\"imp\"&gt;imp&lt;/a&gt;s\u00a0and other nasty demons were roaming free. Lulubelle asked the First to find the lousy warlock who was responsible and get him to write a confession. In &lt;a href=\"Felscale%20Cavern\"&gt;Felscale Cavern&lt;/a&gt;, they found the gnome warlock &lt;a href=\"Galius%20Miremoore\"&gt;Galius Miremoore&lt;/a&gt;. The First asked him who summoned all those imps, but he claimed that it wasn't him. Like he told the guards in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, it was probably the Fizzlebang girl. Just like her brother, always summoning a mess of demons she couldn't control, he said. When the First told him that Lulubelle said \"he\" was to blame, he answered that this was further proof that a Fizzlebang couldn't be trusted. But the First insisted, and ordered him to confess his crimes.\nClearing one's name.\nThe First successfully brought the confession back to Lulubelle. Though the writing was a bit difficult to decipher, she believed all the pertinent information was included, and she would be able to prove her innocence and focus on more pressing matters. A confession alone wouldn't be enough to clear her name, however. As long as those\u00a0&lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s\u00a0ran amuck, people would blame their presence on her. She would clean up the mess that warlock made, but she couldn't be placed at the scene of the crime. The First could banish them though. That would do the trick. She gave them an &lt;a href=\"Orb%20of%20Banishment\"&gt;Orb of Banishment&lt;/a&gt; that could be used on newly summoned demons to send them right back where they came from, permanently.\nLulubelle thanked the First. Their willingness to help an outcast would not be forgotten. They talked, and she told them that their plan was pretty risky. Summoning one sister would be difficult enough, but both of them at once was just asking for trouble. Luckily, she was up for the challenge. Lulubelle would help the Council\u00a0summon those demons, and hopefully restore pride to the Fizzlebang name. She thus made her way to\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Dreadscar%20Rift\"&gt;Dreadscar Rift&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0after she got the confession in front of the right people.\nThe hour of summoning.\nOn &lt;a href=\"Dreadscar%20Rift\"&gt;Dreadscar Rift&lt;/a&gt;, Lulubelle thanked the First once more. She didn't have to hide away in shame anymore, it was a debt she doubted she'd ever be able to repay, but she could try, and became a member of the Black Harvest. The warlocks gathered together. It would be best to conduct the summoning on the outskirts of\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Dreadscar%20Rift\"&gt;Dreadscar Rift&lt;/a&gt;, claimed Ritssyn. If things did not go as planned, at least the aftermath would be contained to a small island that floated above.\nOnce the sisters summoned, the First would use the Bloodstone to enslave them. The sorcerers travelled through the demonic gateway and made their way to the summoning platform above. There, Ritssyn started the ritual, and the others followed. After an extremely destructive fight, the First of the Black Harvest raised the Bloodstone into the air. The relic magically latched onto the Eredar Twins, and broke their will, submitting them to the warlock. The sisters were now the Council's to control. As Ritssyn and the First met back at the Council's circle, the other members escorted the &lt;a href=\"eredar\"&gt;eredar&lt;/a&gt; through the gateway. They would then be forced to cure Shinfel from the curse of doom she had been afflicted with.\nConclusion.\nThe Black Harvest had thus managed to weaken\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Mephistroth\"&gt;Mephistroth&lt;/a&gt;'s army and gain powerful allies for the Council. Their work was not done, however.\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Dreadscar%20Rift\"&gt;Dreadscar Rift&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0would remain a target as long as the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0remained. Furthermore, both\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Lulubelle\"&gt;Lulubelle&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Kira\"&gt;Kira&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0had proven themselves worthy to join their ranks, though only one spot remained among the Council. The First of the\u00a0Black Harvest had to make a choice.\nKira Iresoul.\nA new Sixth of the Black Harvest was thus chosen. Ritssyn then held the following speech:\nRitssyn took the First apart. Their research into the Felblood Altar had proven useful, and they had developed a ritual that could unleash the full powers of their weapon."}

Taking both points in Improved Curse of Weakness increases this debuff to 420 attack power.

This works out to be over 8.5 DPS reduction of physical attacks on any enemy players affected, compared with an untalented shout. (See &lt;a href=\"Attack%20Power\"&gt;Attack Power&lt;/a&gt; for details)\nThis talent is considerably more useful than &lt;a href=\"Booming%20Voice%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Booming Voice (Classic)&lt;/a&gt;, in that it makes the shout more powerful, without making it harder to control. It is particularly helpful in group-based melee furballs, and for long-duration boss fights where the more status effects, the better. (Bosses will also have a larger DPS reduction, as NPC AP affects their total DPS more.) It should be noted that only two ranks (2/5) effectively work against bosses, unless the boss is afflicted with &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Recklessness\"&gt;Curse of Recklessness&lt;/a&gt;, in which case all five ranks (5/5) are effective.\nThe Fury Tree shortest path advancement alternative is &lt;a href=\"Unbridled%20Wrath%20%28warrior%20talent%29\"&gt;Unbridled Wrath (warrior talent)&lt;/a&gt;, which is also a reasonably useful talent.

In this equation, d is the amount of Fire spell damage, B is the base Fireball damage, and X is the number of points in Improved Fireball.\nSolving this equation for zero points and five points in the talent gives:\nFor more details on Fireball damage equations, see the main &lt;a href=\"Fireball\"&gt;Fireball&lt;/a&gt; article.\nExample.\nThe following example uses &lt;a href=\"Fireball\"&gt;Fireball&lt;/a&gt; rank 13, with a 3.5 second cast, 633 - 805 damage done, and a base spell damage coefficient of 1.0 without talents.\n (633 + 805) / 2 = 719\nOn average, this is 719 average damage done per hit.\n 719 / 3.5 = 205.4\nDividing by cast time, the spell does 205.4 Damage Per Second. With 5 points in the talent, but with no spell damage:\n 719 / 3.0 = 239.7\nWith no spell damage, the talent gives a boost to Fireball Damage Per Second of 34.3.

One point reduces the imp's firebolt cast time to 1.75 seconds, the second point further reduces the cast time to 1.5 seconds. \nNotes.\nThe imp's &lt;a href=\"Firebolt\"&gt;Firebolt&lt;/a&gt; has a base cast time of 2 seconds. With two points on this talent, the resulting cast time will be only 1.5 seconds. Combined with the talent &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Imp\"&gt;Improved Imp&lt;/a&gt;, the resulting Imp will be quite powerful and add considerable DPS. However, the value gets smaller for level 60 warlocks with epic equipment. The reason for this is that most epic equipment improves the Warlock moreso than the &lt;a href=\"warlock%20minion\"&gt;minion&lt;/a&gt;'s, as the minion receives only a percentage of the bonus given to the warlock. Note that equipment that adds any type of magical damage improves the minion. The Imp's +spell damage will be a factor of whichever type of +spell damage the Warlock has the most of. (For example, if your Warlock has +300 spell damage across the board, but +350 shadow damage, the Imp will gain +spell damage based on the +350 from the Shadow Damage. If the Warlock somehow had +400 Holy Damage, the Imp would gain +spell damage based off of that. In the v2.0+ WOW client, this is revealed in the mouseover tooltip for spell damage.)\nThis talent only modifies the speed at which the imp does damage and with both points invested the imp will run out of mana very quickly indeed, which is usually less time than that needed to kill a mob. Although the imp has very little downtime, this talent will accentuate it slightly.\nTips.\nWhile this talent does not particularly favoring \"leveling\" side, since the imp will run out of mana quickly, this talent may aid in pushing back spells of enemy casters in PvP, or to keep enemy rogues in combat to prevent re-stealthing (not counting vanish) incase they blow Cloak of Shadows to remove all your dots. While imps can already do this without the talent, reducing the cast time makes them potentially more effective (0.5 seconds may be the life saving difference whether the enemy's spell goes off or not)"}

Improved Hamstring gives a rather large chance to give the Warrior five whole seconds to smash his/her victim's face. As a bonus, it has a great psychological effect (namely, panic) on target players. Suddenly not being able to move forces them to use cooldowns they wouldn't have used otherwise.\nA complete immobilizer (instead of a snare) is the best for a Warrior, who always needs to be close to do massive damage. It will turn the tide in most battles, pretty much guaranteeing you win 15% more of them (if you use it right). However, getting this isn't just an \"I Win\" talent; some degree of skill is needed to fully utilize this talent. Learning to use Hamstring at opportune moments helps. Mindlessly spamming Hamstring for this to proc is wasting Rage, and shooting yourself in the crotch.\nPvE: You may pass it up and put your 2 points into something more worthwhile, like talents which increase your general DPS."}

Since Improved Heroic Strike is an first tier talent for an ability that doesn't require a specific stance, it's an option for warriors in other trees who need some additional DPS but don't have the points to spend on &lt;a href=\"Mortal%20Strike\"&gt;Mortal Strike&lt;/a&gt;.\nSince Rage seems to acculmulate in units of four to six at a time, warriors with good non-two-handers will find this talent useful as they will need to hit an opponent twice instead of three times to build up the necessary rage for a Heroic Strike.\nWhile the three-point reduction might seem to be small, it can go a long way if you have a mess of Rage that needs to be spent. For example, if you have 60 Rage you can get two &lt;a href=\"Mortal%20Strike\"&gt;Mortal Strike&lt;/a&gt;s, or four normal &lt;a href=\"Heroic%20Strike\"&gt;Heroic Strike&lt;/a&gt;s. With three points in Improved Heroic Strike you can get 5 in that same 60 Rage. At level 40 that's an additional 80 damage and another chance to crit big if you happen to have &lt;a href=\"Impale%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Impale (Classic)&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf you're looking for Threat generation, this is a good talent to look at because you can follow a Heroic Strike up with a Sunder Armor. If you delve far enough into the Protection tree to get &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Sunder%20Armor\"&gt;Improved Sunder Armor&lt;/a&gt; you can get both strikes off for 24 Rage rather than 30 (if you don't have either), or 27 (if you have three points in one). This is significant because Heroic Strike doesn't pop the global cooldown like Sunder Armor does meaning you can hit them twice for high threat in the same 1.5 to 2 seconds.\nBeneficial builds.\nNon-two-hander build warriors carrying weapons with fast swing speeds will get good mileage out of this talent.\nTwo-weapon builds based around rapid Rage generation will get a \"LOT\" of mileage out of this talent due to the higher normal damage and the Unbridled Wrath talent which many Fury warriors have.\nProtection specced main tanks can get this talent with a very small investment of talent points.\nNon-beneficial builds.\nTwo-handed-weapon builds should avoid this talent because using Heroic Strike in general is a bad move for you.\nIn general, \"if you don't use Heroic Strike anyway, you won't find this talent useful\"."}

For a tank, the talent is valuable both because it increases the damage (and thus threat) caused by &lt;a href=\"Icy%20Touch\"&gt;Icy Touch&lt;/a&gt; and because it increases the slowing effect of &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Fever\"&gt;Frost Fever&lt;/a&gt;, which helps reduce incoming damage.

They are of many &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s races and are affiliated with various factions.\nThere are also siege engineers. Superior engineers are called &lt;a href=\"Chief%20Engineer%20%28disambiguation%29\"&gt;chief engineers&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnder the guidance of uncooperative &lt;a href=\"mo%27arg\"&gt;mo'arg&lt;/a&gt; engineers, &lt;a href=\"demon%20hunter\"&gt;demon hunter&lt;/a&gt;s were able to create several &lt;a href=\"Teleportation\"&gt;portals&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Mardum\"&gt;Mardum&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn WoW, they act as vendors or trainers.\nIn the RPG.\nWith the rise of technology in the world of Warcraft, &lt;a href=\"tinker\"&gt;tinker&lt;/a&gt;s are becoming common among almost all factions and races. A rarer breed, however, are the geniuses among the tinkers who focus their intelligence on a particular type of technology and can lead impossibly ambitious projects that turn fantasy into reality. The earliest of these prodigies developed the phlogiston-powered boilers that allowed the &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s to replace their &lt;a href=\"scout%20balloon\"&gt;scout balloon&lt;/a&gt;s with enormous &lt;a href=\"zeppelin\"&gt;zeppelin&lt;/a&gt;s, and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; to take its ironclad &lt;a href=\"juggernaught\"&gt;juggernaught&lt;/a&gt;s to sea. They named themselves after their work, and those who have followed in their footsteps honor them by taking that title for their own.\nAn engineer chooses a particular type of technological device in which to specialize (e.g., &lt;a href=\"steam%20armor\"&gt;steam armor&lt;/a&gt;, zeppelins, &lt;a href=\"siege%20weapon\"&gt;siege weapon&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"trap\"&gt;trap&lt;/a&gt;s). Later, as he becomes more experienced, an engineer selects a second and third field of specialization. However, as an engineer focuses his tinkering genius, his more general mechanical abilities suffer.\nEngineers understand the process of mechanical creation so well that they can organize the efforts of tinkers in order to create larger or more complex devices together than they could individually. An engineer gains the ability to lead group projects with efficiency. His knowledge determines the technological limits of any device construction project he leads. In addition, as long as he supervises and participates in the construction of the device, it is completed before the progress is greater than the item\u2019s market value. The engineer must supervise and make weekly progress on the project, or he is no longer considered to be leading the project and completion reverts to the normal standard where costs may exceed market value.\nEngineers learn how to draw plans that allow devices they\u2019ve built to be recreated more easily. If an &lt;a href=\"engineer\"&gt;engineer&lt;/a&gt; has been personally involved in the creation of a device, at any time after the device\u2019s completion an &lt;a href=\"engineering\"&gt;engineering&lt;/a&gt; can check over his craft. Success on this check allows the creation of schematics that may be passed along to other tinkers. Use of these schematics makes it easier for those involved in constructing a copy of the original device. Engineers do not make use of their own &lt;a href=\"schematic\"&gt;schematic&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAn experienced engineer has such rapport with technology that his devices are less likely to malfunction under his watchful eye."}

{"id": "12914", "revid": "22514", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=12914", "title": "Engineering", "text": "Engineering is a primary crafting &lt;a href=\"profession\"&gt;profession&lt;/a&gt; that can create many useful, unique and amazing items, as well as junk (but often explosive junk!). Engineers can create helpful items for generally all classes to be used in &lt;a href=\"PvE\"&gt;PvE&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt;. To counterbalance this usefulness, most items crafted by engineering require engineering skill to use, and many of these items come with a chance for unexpected backfires with often hilarious results. Hunters in particular see much use for engineered &lt;a href=\"gun\"&gt;gun&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"scope\"&gt;scope&lt;/a&gt;s.\nEngineering profession &lt;a href=\"recipe\"&gt;recipe&lt;/a&gt;s are known as &lt;a href=\"Engineering%20schematics\"&gt;schematics&lt;/a&gt;. Some notable engineer-crafted items are:\nThere are also several engineer-only &lt;a href=\"enhancer\"&gt;enhancer&lt;/a&gt;s to gloves, belts, and cloaks (including a well known parachute cloak enhancement).\nGrand Master Engineers have access to an auction house of their own faction in Dalaran by visiting or in the engineer shop &lt;a href=\"Like%20Clockwork\"&gt;Like Clockwork&lt;/a&gt;. (Each of these NPCs are visible only to members of that faction.)\nFor the Alliance faction, &lt;a href=\"Gnome%20%28playable%29\"&gt;Gnomes&lt;/a&gt; benefit from a +15 racial bonus to their Engineering skill.\nOfficial overview.\n\"Engineers take advantage of their inventiveness to create an immense (and occasionally random) variety of helpful items. By tinkering ceaselessly, and tolerating malfunctions and misfires, an engineer can make utterly unique objects: sight-enhancing goggles, potent guns, robot pets, mechanical mounts, and even more unusual trinkets. Successful engineers use their inventions to solve problems and make life easier, faster, and better for themselves and their companions.\n\"The majority of Engineering schematics can be manufactured anywhere, provided you've already obtained the diverse materials necessary for their creation.\n\"It's not uncommon for Engineers to also specialize in Mining - the metals and ores they procure serve as building materials for their inventions.\n\"As you progress in your studies as an Engineer, you'll be given an opportunity to choose a specialization. After completing a unique quest, you can specialize in either Goblin or Gnomish schools of engineering. Each school specializes in crafting unique items, some of which aren't available to the opposing style of craftsmanship.\"\nTraining as an Engineer.\nEngineering is taught by various engineering trainers located throughout the world. Prospective engineers must be at least level 5. Initial training costs , granting the Apprentice level with a potential skill of 75 and access to a few starting engineering schematics. More schematics can be learned from trainers or found throughout the world as the engineer raises their skill level. \nThe following is a breakdown of the engineering profession by expansion:\nAdvancing as an Engineer.\nCrafting items is the only way to progress through the stages. Plans will appear as one of four colors in the profession window, with a certain chance for a skill up (gaining a point):\nAs engineering skill increases, plans will eventually change from orange to yellow, yellow to green and green to grey. Only by finding higher skill schematics can one continue to progress through the profession. Approximately every 5-10 points, new schematics will become available to learn from the trainers. Alternatively, schematics can be looted from corpses, given as quest rewards, or can be purchased either from vendors or from the &lt;a href=\"auction%20house\"&gt;auction house&lt;/a&gt;. All schematics have a requisite engineering skill to be able to be learned and crafted. Additionally, some schematics cannot be gotten until you have a certain &lt;a href=\"reputation\"&gt;reputation&lt;/a&gt; standing with a given &lt;a href=\"faction\"&gt;faction&lt;/a&gt;.\nSchematics usually require the use of some additional item, which will need to be in your inventory or equipped. Each schematic will show what it requires. This may include:\nYou may also be required to use an &lt;a href=\"anvil\"&gt;anvil&lt;/a&gt;. Anvils can be found throughout the world, particularly in civilized areas such as cities near a &lt;a href=\"forge\"&gt;forge&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Blacksmithing%20Trainers\"&gt;Blacksmithing Trainers&lt;/a&gt;. At high level, engineers can create their own &lt;a href=\"Thermal%20Anvil\"&gt;Thermal Anvil&lt;/a&gt;s to use or sell.\nCompanion Skills.\nBy far the best option for your second primary profession is &lt;a href=\"mining\"&gt;mining&lt;/a&gt;. The vast majority of the materials you need for Engineering recipes are acquired through mining. The only other profession that might be mildly beneficial is &lt;a href=\"skinning\"&gt;skinning&lt;/a&gt;, since a small number of engineering recipes use leather.\nNote: If you have an &lt;a href=\"alt\"&gt;alt&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Mining\"&gt;Mining&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"profession\"&gt;profession&lt;/a&gt; (such as a &lt;a href=\"blacksmithing\"&gt;blacksmith&lt;/a&gt;), and that character can pass materials to your engineer, then the &lt;a href=\"jewelcrafting\"&gt;jewelcrafting&lt;/a&gt; profession would be a good secondary profession. This is primarily because most engineering items only require skill in engineering and are not level dependent, and the engineering skill can be rapidly advanced by making blasting powder, dynamite, and bombs for personal use. Thus, low-level characters can equip themselves with powerful engineering gear, making leveling faster and easier. This also gives such engineers a distinct advantage in low level battlegrounds (such as &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Gulch\"&gt;Warsong Gulch&lt;/a&gt;) as they will be far better equipped than comparable non-engineers. Jewelcrafting can then be used with the same basic materials to craft early rings, amulets, and trinkets - making the character with this combination even more powerful. In addition, jewelcrafting allows &lt;a href=\"prospecting\"&gt;prospecting&lt;/a&gt; raw minerals to produce gems, which are used quite extensively in engineering schematics.\nSpecialization.\nEngineering has the opportunity to specialize in two fields. At skill level 200 an engineer can choose to specialize in &lt;a href=\"Gnomish%20Engineering\"&gt;Gnomish&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20Engineering\"&gt;Goblin Engineering&lt;/a&gt;. The main difference between both sides is the location of their respective teleporters and the ability of their trinkets. Some items require a specific specialization to use, while other items are crafted by one specialization but are usable by any engineer. Fortunately, most recipes that are crafted by one Specialization can be used by both.\nSome specialization recipe comparisons.\nFor more information, read the respective pages for &lt;a href=\"Gnomish%20Engineering\"&gt;Gnomish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20Engineering\"&gt;Goblin Engineering&lt;/a&gt;.\nAll in all, both Engineering disciplines are useful and fun. Some believe various Engineering gadgets, such as the &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20Rocket%20Launcher\"&gt;Goblin Rocket Launcher&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Gnomish%20Poultryizer\"&gt;Gnomish Poultryizer&lt;/a&gt;, are excellent for use in PvP given their crowd control potential and stamina boost. That being said, many people don't take Engineering until they reach max level and have ample gold saved because of the fairly steep expense involved in leveling it.\nSwitching specializations.\nYou can drop your current specialization by opening the profession tab in your spellbook and unlearning Gnomish/Goblin Engineering. Learn another specialization from the engineering trainer in either Orgrimmar or Stormwind:\nAlso of note:\nEngineer-Only Benefits.\nEnchantments.\nEngineer enchantments, also known as \"tinkers\", are unique gear enchantments that may be used alongside regular enchantments. Glove enchants generally provide a throughput bonus and do not have any backfire effects. Belt enchants are utility-based and can sometimes backfire for adverse effects, or simply fizzle out.\nCogwheels.\nEngineers are able to trade crafted goods for cogwheels that can only be placed into certain engineering crafted helms.\nMounts.\nEngineers are able to create two engineer-only &lt;a href=\"mount\"&gt;mount&lt;/a&gt;s, in addition to the &lt;a href=\"Mekgineer%27s%20Chopper\"&gt;Mekgineer's Chopper&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=\"Mechano-Hog\"&gt;Mechano-Hog&lt;/a&gt; which is BoE and can be often be sold for a profit.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Flying%20Machine\"&gt;Flying Machine&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Turbo-Charged%20Flying%20Machine\"&gt;Turbo-Charged Flying Machine&lt;/a&gt; have a minimum engineering skill requirement to learn and fly, and are made with engineering. Keep in mind that if you drop engineering after making the mounts, they will no longer be usable unless you pick up engineering again and get it to the mount's required engineering skill level.\nTeleports.\nEngineers can make several teleportation devices that require engineering skill to operate. Which teleportation devices you can craft depend on your specialization.\nGoggles.\nEngineers can craft goggles as head-slot items. These often have unique looks and offer decent stats for their level.\nGuns.\nAn engineer can make several different types of &lt;a href=\"Gun\"&gt;Gun&lt;/a&gt;s, however some are &lt;a href=\"Bind%20on%20Pickup\"&gt;Bind on Pickup&lt;/a&gt; and bind to the engineer - thus making them for all intents and purposes an Engineering-only weapon. Some of these guns, like the &lt;a href=\"Mark%20%22S%22%20Boomstick\"&gt;Mark \"S\" Boomstick&lt;/a&gt;, require expensive mats to create. This should be kept in mind if your engineer is a class that cannot use guns, or before crafting any gun to send to an &lt;a href=\"alt\"&gt;alt&lt;/a&gt; which can use guns.\nMiscellaneous Devices.\nEngineers specialize in items only they can use, with effects ranging from novelty to highly practical. Some engineer-only devices include:"}
