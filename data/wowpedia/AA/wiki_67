Their new name is a dirge, referencing both the blood of their many brethren who fell during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, and their &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;royal lineage&lt;/a&gt;.\nFor nearly 7,000 years, high elven society centered on the sacred &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;, a magical fount that was created using a vial of pure arcane energy from the first &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;. Nourished and strengthened by the Sunwell's potent energies, the high elves' enchanted kingdom of Quel'Thalas prospered within the verdant forests north of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. During the Third War, however, the high elves were nearly scoured from &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Led by the &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; army &lt;a href=\"The%20Scourge%20invasion%20of%20Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;stormed into Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, slaughtering almost ninety percent of the kingdom's population. Arthas then used the mystical Sunwell to resurrect the fallen necromancer &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;, irrevocably tainting the fount in the process. &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Prince Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; rushed to his homeland's aid, and the survivors of the onslaught were renamed the \"blood elves\" in honor of their fallen people. The tainted Sunwell was destroyed, but the elves had grown addicted to its energies over the years and were left weakened and despondent without them. Kael'thas assured his brethren that he would find them a cure, and left Quel'Thalas in the hands of his regent, &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;, while he traveled to avenge his people and find a way to sate their hunger for magic.\nThe blood elves strove to rebuild Quel'Thalas and reclaimed much of their land from the Scourge. Kael'thas had assured his people that one day he would return to Quel'Thalas and lead them to paradise, yet time revealed that his promises were nothing more than lies. On &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, the prince became twisted due to his reliance on &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; energy, the dark and corrupting essence wielded by the demonic &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; itself. Unbeknownst to his ally, &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, Kael'thas also came under the sway of the Legion's commander, &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;. The prince ultimately returned to Quel'Thalas, seeking to usher his new master into Azeroth through the defiled Sunwell, though was killed for his treachery before his cataclysmic ambitions could be fulfilled. The &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; prophet, &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt;, then used the essence of a &lt;a href=\"M%27uru\"&gt;darkened naaru&lt;/a&gt; to restore the Sunwell as a fount of both arcane and &lt;a href=\"holy\"&gt;holy&lt;/a&gt; energy.\nInspired by the Sunwell's rebirth, the blood elves have since entered into a shining new era in their ancient race's history. Although some elves remain hesitant to abandon their dependence on arcane magic, others have embraced change for the betterment of Quel'Thalas. Despite the numerous tragedies of their past, the blood elves continue to stand strong and endure, tenaciously striving to restore their beloved nation's past glory. Reinvigorated, they fight to protect Quel'Thalas, conquer their magical addiction, and help redeem the soul of their ancient people.\nIntroduction.\nThose now known as blood elves were once high elves. With the great power and protection of the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt; at their beck and call, the elven kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; thrived for a strong 7,000 years. Masters of magic, and with a natural affinity for wielding it, the high elves championed the belief that they were the \"sun blessed.\" They basked in the Sunwell's might, using it much like the &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; they descended from used the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;. Life for the high elves changed during the Third War, when &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;King Arthas&lt;/a&gt;' Scourge attacked Quel'Thalas and shattered the elven race. The Scourge slew almost 90% of the high elven population, devastating their kingdom, and slaying King &lt;a href=\"Anasterian%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Anasterian Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;. His son and heir, Prince Kael'thas Sunstrider, was thankfully studying magic in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; at the time of the disaster and quickly rushed to his people's aid. He returned to find Quel'Thalas in ruins, and thirsting for vengeance, gathered the survivors and renamed them \"blood elves\" in honor of their fallen kin. Prior to the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;'s destruction, all high elves were constantly bathed in its magical power. Now bereft of this &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; energy, the elves of Quel'Thalas suffered heavily from terrible withdrawals. Kael'thas worried that they would soon die without another magical source to replace the Sunwell.\nSoon, the blood elves clashed with the Scourge and the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20Empire\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt; trolls, who were making inroads into the former elven territory. &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; was commanded to watch over the shattered elven kingdom and look to finding a cure for their &lt;a href=\"Magical%20addiction\"&gt;addiction&lt;/a&gt;, while Kael'thas took a group of the strongest blood elf warriors and spellcasters and joined the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20resistance\"&gt;Alliance resistance&lt;/a&gt; against the Scourge. They were eager to avenge themselves on the undead forces; however, bigotry on the part of the Alliance's commander prevented the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; forces from fully utilizing the aid the blood elves could bring to their fight. Due to &lt;a href=\"Garithos\"&gt;Grand Marshal Garithos&lt;/a&gt;' prejudices, Kael'thas was forced to accept the assistance of &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Vashj\"&gt;Lady Vashj&lt;/a&gt;, and her reptilian &lt;a href=\"Naga\"&gt;Naga&lt;/a&gt;. When the humans discovered that the blood elves were working with the naga, they were imprisoned and sentenced to death by Garithos, for \"conspiring with the enemy\". However Kael'thas and his soldiers escaped the prisons of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; with the aid of the naga, who told Kael about &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, and the possibility of his knowing a way to help them with their magical addiction. This group of blood elves then helped defeat the demon &lt;a href=\"Magtheridon\"&gt;Magtheridon&lt;/a&gt; and claimed his &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt; as their own.\nKael'thas beseeched Illidan for a cure to the blood elves' addiction to magic. Illidan had a different proposal in mind, though: in return for the blood elves' loyalty, he would teach them to drain magic from powerful alternative sources, including demons. It was an offer Kael'thas felt he had to accept; he was certain his people would die without either a cure or a new source of magic. Kael'thas pledged his allegiance to Illidan, who taught several blood elves the techniques he had offered. These teachings spread to the other blood elves in Outland, who were then able to stave off their painful hunger for arcane magic. The prince sent back a master magus named &lt;a href=\"Rommath\"&gt;Rommath&lt;/a&gt; and several of his &lt;a href=\"magisters\"&gt;magisters&lt;/a&gt;, with a message of hope for the blood elves remaining in Quel'Thalas: That one day Kael'thas would return to lead his people to paradise. Rommath has made great progress in teaching the blood elves advanced techniques to manipulate arcane energies, although unlike their brethren on Outland, the blood elves of Azeroth employed this technique only on mana crystals and small mana-bearing vermin, and attributed these teachings to Kael'thas alone - most were unaware of their prince's alliance with Illidan. With renewed purpose, the blood elves rebuilt the city of &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;, though it is powered by volatile magics. Emboldened by the promise of Kael'thas' return, the weary citizens of Quel'Thalas focused on regaining their strength, even as they forge a new path into an uncertain future.\nFollowing the will of their crazed leader, Kael'thas Sunstrider, the blood elves channeled dangerous, chaotic magicks to transform their sacred &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt; into a gateway of unspeakable evil. While Kael'thas and his &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;demonic masters&lt;/a&gt; were eventually defeated, a different transformation occurred within the Sunwell itself as a dying &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; sacrificed its life essence to reignite the Sunwell as a font of holy energy. Now, the blood elf regent, &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;, sees a new hope on the horizon for his people. Over time, the Sunwell's Light could cure the blood elves of their cursed state, but many still cling to the &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; powers they procured and are hesitant to relinquish them.\nHistory.\nTen thousand years ago, during the reign of the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt;, there was an elite magic-using sect known as the &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt;, who dabbled in magics that many other &lt;a href=\"elf\"&gt;elves&lt;/a&gt; considered &lt;a href=\"heretic\"&gt;heretic&lt;/a&gt;al by drawing upon the power of the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;. Fiercely loyal to their queen, the Highborne opened a number of portals under her direction that brought forth the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, triggering the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;. Sometime after the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, most of the surviving Highborne were exiled from &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; and settled in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;eastern continent&lt;/a&gt;, founding the kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;. They became known as &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt;. During this time, they created the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;, and switched to a diurnal waking cycle. Their purple skin eventually shifted to skintones like that of some &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt;. Some sources imply this was a near-instantaneous transformation that occurred during the Sunwell's creation.\nThe elves prospered for thousands of years in their enchanted kingdom, under the rule of the &lt;a href=\"Sunstrider%20dynasty\"&gt;Sunstrider dynasty&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Convocation%20of%20Silvermoon\"&gt;Convocation of Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;. Although they were not without enemies - they constantly warred with a grudging foe, the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt; trolls of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt;, who had been displaced from the land by the elves' Highborne ancestors - Quel'Thalas stood strong for 7,000 years to come.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Arthas\"&gt;Prince Arthas&lt;/a&gt; led his army of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; against them, &lt;a href=\"The%20Scourge%20invasion%20of%20Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;ravaging Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; and corrupting the Sunwell. Despite the elves' best efforts, most of the high elven population was eradicated during this conflict. The elven scion, &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;, quickly rushed to the aid of his homeland to rally the survivors. In remembrance of their fallen brethren, they renamed themselves the blood elves, or sin'dorei, and swore to avenge their fallen race. The &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt; had become tainted with dark magic during the Scourge invasion, and Kael'thas destroyed it to avert another catastrophe - this dark power corrupting and killing the elves. Though he was successful, its destruction manifested a crippling addiction in most of the elves, who had spent most of their lives tied to the Sunwell and suffused by its power. Without the Sunwell to sate them, the elves, addicted to the very power that once built their empire, began suffering from a withdrawal-based lethargy.\nDesperate for aid following the Third War, the blood elves joined the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20resistance\"&gt;Alliance resistance&lt;/a&gt;. Kael'thas commanded his regent, &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;, to safeguard the elven homeland, and &lt;a href=\"Halduron%20Brightwing\"&gt;Halduron Brightwing&lt;/a&gt; was named the new &lt;a href=\"Ranger-general%20of%20Silvermoon\"&gt;Ranger-general of Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt; and general blood elf military leader. Kael himself took 15% of the blood elven race (including some of his most powerful and gifted &lt;a href=\"magisters\"&gt;magisters&lt;/a&gt;) to join with the Alliance fighting in the equally destroyed &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. However, this tenuous alliance would not last, and the blood elves came under the bigoted scrutiny of one &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Marshal%20Garithos\"&gt;Grand Marshal Garithos&lt;/a&gt;. Garithos, a human who had felt wronged by the high elves' conduct in the past, consistently gave the blood elves either meager tasks beneath their capabilities, or worse, suicidal missions devoid of reinforcements, in order to rid himself of the sin'dorei.\nKael'thas and his forces were offered aid from an unlikely source: the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Vashj\"&gt;Lady Vashj&lt;/a&gt;, who shared a common ancestry with the elves and a common enemy in the Scourge. Out of options, Kael warily accepted her aid, though Garithos scapegoated this decision to put the entire blood elven contingent to death in the &lt;a href=\"Dungeons%20of%20Dalaran\"&gt;Dungeons of Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;. Viewing this as outright betrayal, Kael'thas was not so reluctant to accept Vashj's aid again when she offered to assist in his escape.\nPrince Kael'thas led his followers to freedom, to the extra-dimensional wastes of &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, the remnants of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, and pledged allegiance to &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, who promised to grant them a new source of magic by teaching them to siphon magic from powerful alternative sources, including demons. Together with their allies the naga, Illidan led the blood elves to conquer Outland, gaining in the process the friendship of the nearly extinct &lt;a href=\"Broken\"&gt;Broken&lt;/a&gt;. The blood elves then followed Illidan to the &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Glacier\"&gt;Icecrown Glacier&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to destroy the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;; however, they were defeated by Arthas, who wounded Illidan, forcing the blood elves and naga to retreat, allowing Arthas to ascend the glacier and merge with the Lich King. During the battles in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, several of the deceased blood elves (including the powerful bearer of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Delar\"&gt;Quel'Delar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blood-Queen%20Lana%27thel\"&gt;Lana'thel&lt;/a&gt;) were raised into undeath by Arthas, to serve him as his \"&lt;a href=\"San%27layn\"&gt;San'layn&lt;/a&gt;\". Defeated, Kael's forces returned to Outland, and the prince began walking down a path that would have dire repercussions for all of the blood elves.\nReclaiming Quel'Thalas.\nIn Quel'Thalas, the blood elves under &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Halduron%20Brightwing\"&gt;Halduron Brightwing&lt;/a&gt; were undergoing their own tribulations. Retaking their homeland seemed a daunting task, as the Scourge was still occupying it in large numbers, and the kingdom was still a wasteland. Weakened by their addiction to magic, the general blood elf populace relied heavily on the &lt;a href=\"Farstriders\"&gt;Farstriders&lt;/a&gt; for protection, who were relatively unaffected by the withdrawal. The essence of the Sunwell, a woman named &lt;a href=\"Anveena%20Teague\"&gt;Anveena Teague&lt;/a&gt;, was kidnapped by the great traitor &lt;a href=\"Dar%27Khan%20Drathir\"&gt;Dar'Khan Drathir&lt;/a&gt; (who had sold his people out to Arthas during the Scourge invasion) and brought to Quel'Thalas. Lor'themar and the rangers attempted to avenge the Sunwell's destruction by killing Dar'Khan but were unsuccessful in the face of his dark magic. The blood elves ultimately allied with the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragon\"&gt;blue dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; and his companions, and succeeded in eliminating Dar'Khan for the time being. Lor'themar put Anveena under sin'dorei protection, her status as the Sunwell's mortal avatar to be kept a closely guarded secret.\nKael'thas sent back &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Rommath\"&gt;Grand Magister Rommath&lt;/a&gt; and a group of &lt;a href=\"magisters\"&gt;magisters&lt;/a&gt; to Quel'Thalas, to spread Illidan's teachings (said teachings Rommath smoothly attributed to Kael) and to reclaim Quel'Thalas with their powerful magic. Invigorated by the formidable new techniques at their disposal, such as forcibly taking the magic and power of arcane-bearing creatures, the blood elves were able to retake much of Quel'Thalas and even restore much of &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt;. The remaining Scourge proved little match for Rommath and the magisters, who quickly went about destroying them and rebuilding the city \"almost overnight.\" Emboldened by the notion of the prince's promised return to lead his people to power and glory, the blood elves began to focus on regaining all of their homeland and their strength to this end.\nInvigorated by Rommath's teachings, the elves were able to reclaim their strength and retake much of &lt;a href=\"Eversong%20Woods\"&gt;Eversong Woods&lt;/a&gt;. Others were not content with this, and traveled south to the &lt;a href=\"Ghostlands\"&gt;Ghostlands&lt;/a&gt; in order to drive the undead from Quel'Thalas. The blood elves were encouraged to deal with their magical addiction sensibly and with good judgment, to walk the line between deficiency and &lt;a href=\"Wretched\"&gt;overindulgence&lt;/a&gt;.\nHaving rebuilt much of their kingdom, the blood elves looked to finding new allies. They had once been part of the Alliance of Lordaeron, but the Alliance no longer cared to defend Quel'Thalas. The blood elves were offered aid from an unexpected source: the free-willed &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; undead, one of several established powers battling in ruined Lordaeron, reached out to the bewildered and overstretched sin'dorei. The blood elves were initially wary of their intentions, fearing a trick; but the elves eventually acquiesced, as no one else was willing to fight for Quel'Thalas at all.\nSince their induction in the Horde, the Forsaken have been working closely with the blood elves to purge the greater phalanxes of &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; presence from the &lt;a href=\"Ghostlands\"&gt;Ghostlands&lt;/a&gt;. Lor'themar Theron was &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;'s second in command during the Scourge invasion, and many Forsaken were high elves culled from the same battle. Their aid included reinforcements, a number of outposts in and around the reclaimed blood elf territories, and a teleportation device between the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;. Sylvanas claimed to have retained a great love for her homeland and its people.\nIn addition to their traditional &lt;a href=\"Magisters\"&gt;Magisters&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Farstriders\"&gt;Farstriders&lt;/a&gt;, the blood elves expanded their power base with the addition of the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knights\"&gt;Blood Knights&lt;/a&gt;, a group of errant paladins who wielded their powers through &lt;a href=\"M%27uru\"&gt;M'uru&lt;/a&gt;, a gift Kael had sent them from Outland, from whom the knights could take the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nA few years after the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, some blood elves continued to leave &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; to travel across &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href=\"Ferelyn%20Bloodscorn\"&gt;Ferelyn Bloodscorn&lt;/a&gt; joined the ranks of the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt;, or for their own interests.\nAn expedition led by &lt;a href=\"Magus%20Rimtori\"&gt;Magus Rimtori&lt;/a&gt; traveled to &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt; searching for a rune, hiring and later betraying several orcish guards of the Horde.\nThe blood elf &lt;a href=\"Lethtendris\"&gt;Lethtendris&lt;/a&gt; was drawn to &lt;a href=\"Dire%20Maul\"&gt;Dire Maul&lt;/a&gt; and created a device to gather magical power that siphoned the energies of the place, in order to satisfy her cravings for arcane magic and ultimately destroy her enemies. &lt;a href=\"Telmius%20Dreamseeker\"&gt;Master Telmius Dreamseeker&lt;/a&gt; himself was incinerated by &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Tortheldrin\"&gt;Prince Tortheldrin&lt;/a&gt; while trying to gain knowledge from the &lt;a href=\"Shen%27dralar\"&gt;Shen'dralar&lt;/a&gt; ancients found within the place.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ambassador%20Ardalan\"&gt;Ambassador Ardalan&lt;/a&gt; tried to convince the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; to put aside their \"petty squabbles\" with the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, and to instead unite with them against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. The two siblings &lt;a href=\"Bloodmage%20Drazial\"&gt;Drazial&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bloodmage%20Lynnore\"&gt;Lynnore&lt;/a&gt; were also found in the Blasted Lands handing out quests to &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nThe sin'dorei were able to reclaim much of Quel'Thalas, coming under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Regent Lord Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Halduron%20Brightwing\"&gt;Ranger General Halduron Brightwing&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Rommath\"&gt;Grand Magister Rommath&lt;/a&gt;. However, new trials appeared on the horizon: the technique of taking magic from external sources resulted in the birth of the \"&lt;a href=\"Wretched\"&gt;Wretched&lt;/a&gt;,\" a small offshoot of undead-esque, disorganized magical addicts who were unable to keep their withdrawal in check. Their presence became a reminder to the blood elves of the importance of controlling their magical addiction - for if they do not, it will control them. Blood elven adventurers went about putting down a number of the small pockets of Wretched lingering in &lt;a href=\"Eversong\"&gt;Eversong&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe blood elves were caught in the throes of constant combat: with the Scourge presence emanating from &lt;a href=\"Deatholme\"&gt;Deatholme&lt;/a&gt; on one hand and continued raids and attacks coming from the Amani &lt;a href=\"Forest%20troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s, who maintain their own holdings within &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt; on the other. The former threat was ultimately neutralized, thanks to the combined efforts of the sin'dorei &lt;a href=\"Magisters\"&gt;Magisters&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Farstriders\"&gt;Farstriders&lt;/a&gt;, along with support from the Forsaken. Under direction from leaders within the &lt;a href=\"Ghostlands\"&gt;Ghostlands&lt;/a&gt;, this culminated with the eventual battle with and the demise of the Scourge leader, &lt;a href=\"Dar%27Khan%20Drathir\"&gt;Dar'Khan Drathir&lt;/a&gt;, whose head was sent to &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Regent Lord Lor'themar&lt;/a&gt;. Concurrent with &lt;a href=\"Prospector%20Anvilward\"&gt;failed negotiations&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20spies\"&gt;night elven incursions&lt;/a&gt; into Quel'Thalas, Lor'themar began to forge an alliance with the faction his Forsaken allies now belonged to: the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Several ambassadors were sent to and from Silvermoon, and Dar'Khan's death allowed the blood elves to take an equal seat at &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;'s political table.\nWith that, Quel'Thalas began to find its footing once again. Rommath and the magisters quickly went about &lt;a href=\"Priest%20Kath%27mar\"&gt;silencing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Lyria%20Skystrider\"&gt;any dissidents&lt;/a&gt; speaking against the new direction Silvermoon was taking, and the blood elves enforced what bordered on a totalitarian police state to better keep their people united. With the goal of joining with Prince Kael'thas on the agenda, several blood elves began undertaking pilgrimages to the shattered world of &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. However, what they expected to find was a far cry from the trials and revelations that awaited them.\nMeanwhile, the blood elves in Outland under Prince Kael'thas dispersed\u2014most, such as the powerful &lt;a href=\"Sunfury\"&gt;Sunfury&lt;/a&gt; forces, remained with the prince and took over the mana-rich area of &lt;a href=\"Netherstorm\"&gt;Netherstorm&lt;/a&gt;. Others, such as the &lt;a href=\"Eclipsion\"&gt;Eclipsion&lt;/a&gt;, traveled to serve &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;'s ambitions in &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Valley\"&gt;Shadowmoon Valley&lt;/a&gt;. Several were trained as &lt;a href=\"demon%20hunter\"&gt;demon hunter&lt;/a&gt;s. The success rate of this training was mixed: some were driven to insanity, while others fully succeeded in their training and became elite members of Illidan's retinue.\nDuring this time, Kael'thas underwent a change that would have dire consequences. Outing Illidan as an inefficient leader, Kael sold his loyalties to &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;; the demon lord promised Kael'thas salvation for his people, and ultimate power. In secret, he began harvesting the great power coursing through &lt;a href=\"Netherstorm\"&gt;Netherstorm&lt;/a&gt;, and his judgment\u2014and actions\u2014became increasingly callous. After ordering the slaughter of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%27Var%20Village\"&gt;Kirin'Var Village&lt;/a&gt;, Kael sent a raid of blood elves under &lt;a href=\"Voren%27thal%20the%20Seer\"&gt;Voren'thal the Seer&lt;/a&gt; to attack &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt;. However, Voren'thal and his followers surrendered to the &lt;a href=\"Sha%27tar\"&gt;Sha'tar&lt;/a&gt;, and betrayed the twisted prince, forming the &lt;a href=\"Scryers\"&gt;Scryers&lt;/a&gt; in order to oppose him. Though met with an icy reception by the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; residents of the city, a priesthood named the &lt;a href=\"Aldor\"&gt;Aldor&lt;/a&gt;, the Scryers were granted their own sin'dorei-themed portion of Shattrath. From here, they began to fight back against Kael'thas, and sent numerous agents back to &lt;a href=\"Netherstorm\"&gt;Netherstorm&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Valley\"&gt;Shadowmoon Valley&lt;/a&gt;. The Scryers hoped to prove who their prince was truly working for and to save their people from destruction.\nBack in &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, antagonists from the past re-emerged. The troll warlord &lt;a href=\"Zul%27jin\"&gt;Zul'jin&lt;/a&gt;, still embittered by the orcs' abandonment of their siege of the elves' high home during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; (and the New Horde's subsequent acceptance of the same elves into their ranks), turned against his former allies. Within the walled fortress of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt;, largely untouched by the Scourge onslaught, Zul'jin directed the &lt;a href=\"Hex%20Lord%20Malacrass\"&gt;Hex Lord Malacrass&lt;/a&gt; to infuse the spirits of ancient animal gods into living troll warriors. Once again, the fearsome troll army was defeated, and Zul'jin himself was killed in the conflict. The sin'dorei would not be troubled again by their old enemy for years to come.\nFury of the Sunwell.\nMore blood elves from Quel'Thalas began their travels into Outland, urging their Horde allies (whom both Lor'themar and Rommath had enticed with the notion of &lt;a href=\"Mag%27har%20orc\"&gt;uncorrupted orcs&lt;/a&gt; still holding a presence there) to do so too. However, what awaited them was not the paradise that was promised, but the barren wasteland of Hellfire. After dismantling his presence in Netherstorm, Kael's switch of allegiance was uncovered by the &lt;a href=\"Scryers\"&gt;Scryers&lt;/a&gt;, and the prince himself was cornered in Tempest Keep. He was defeated, left for dead, though clung to life. Kael'thas appeared before the leader of the Sha'tar, the naaru &lt;a href=\"A%27dal\"&gt;A'dal&lt;/a&gt;, and berated him for not finishing the job. Announcing his loyalties to all those present, Kael'thas resolved to usher &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvery moon&lt;/a&gt;, washed in blood, led astray into the night, armed with &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knight\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"M%27uru\"&gt;broken Light&lt;/a&gt;. Broken, then &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;betrayed by one&lt;/a&gt;, standing there bestride the sun. At darkest hour, redemption comes, in &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;knightly lady sworn to blood&lt;/a&gt;.\n\u2014 &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt;'s prophecy\nKael'thas returned to Quel'Thalas, and briefly attacked &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt; with his &lt;a href=\"felblood\"&gt;felblood&lt;/a&gt; minions. Retaking &lt;a href=\"M%27uru\"&gt;M'uru&lt;/a&gt; from its chambers, Kael'thas set the stage for his final stand on the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Isle of Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt;. He also spirited &lt;a href=\"Anveena\"&gt;Anveena&lt;/a&gt; away from her undisclosed location in Quel'Thalas. &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt;, the Blood Knight Matriarch, witnessed this attack on Silvermoon herself - and now without a power source for the Blood Knights, traveled to Shattrath to meet with A'dal. She learned that M'uru had resigned himself to this fate a long time ago, and pledged the blades of the Blood Knights to ending the prince's dark ambitions, and restoring Silvermoon to its glory. The &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Sun%20Offensive\"&gt;Shattered Sun Offensive&lt;/a&gt;, a coalition of the Scryers' blood elves and the &lt;a href=\"Aldor\"&gt;Aldor&lt;/a&gt;'s draenei, marched to liberate Quel'Danas. Prior to this turn of events, the prophet &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt; foretold the revelations to come, tied to the sin'dorei and their fate.\nKael'thas made his final stand in the &lt;a href=\"Magisters%27%20Terrace\"&gt;Magisters' Terrace&lt;/a&gt;, little more than a shadow of his former self, little more than a &lt;a href=\"Wretched\"&gt;Wretched&lt;/a&gt; himself. He was cut down, and the Shattered Sun Offensive took the battle to the blood elves' &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt; - now occupied by the most powerful blood elves under Kael's command, the &lt;a href=\"Shadowsword\"&gt;Shadowsword&lt;/a&gt;, allowed to gorge themselves upon unlimited &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt;-power - and defeated them, along with their Burning Legion allies. Ultimately, the Shattered Sun Offensive relieved the Sunwell from the Burning Legion, and even banished &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; back to the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the encounter involving &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;, it appeared that the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;'s powers were exhausted due to &lt;a href=\"Anveena\"&gt;Anveena&lt;/a&gt; sacrificing herself, banishing Kil'jaeden back to the Twisting Nether; however, Prophet Velen and Lady Liadrin appeared to the scene shortly afterwards. &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt; dropped &lt;a href=\"M%27uru\"&gt;M'uru&lt;/a&gt;'s small flickering \"spark\" into the Sunwell and, with that, a huge pillar of light emerged from the Sunwell, at which Velen responded: \"In time, the light and hope within, will rebirth more than this mere fount of power... Mayhap - they will rebirth the soul of a nation.\"\nInspired by the Sunwell's rebirth, the blood elves have since entered into a shining new era in their ancient race's history. Although some elves remained hesitant to abandon their dependence on arcane magic, others embraced change for the betterment of Quel'Thalas. Yet only time would tell if the blood elves can avoid repeating the tragic mistakes of their past. The blood elves no longer required draining magic to keep in good health, and their crippling addiction is sated once more, if not conquered completely. With the Sunwell's rebirth, the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knight\"&gt;Blood Knight&lt;/a&gt;s have engaged in a far more harmonious relationship with the Light, which they now channel directly through the Sunwell itself, wielding the Light in a healthy way, instead of dominating it. They have resolved to embrace their new source of power, as they forge for themselves a new identity as they lead their people into a more promising future.\nInterregnum.\nWith the betrayal and death of Kael'thas, power passed to his regent, under whom the sin'dorei have turned to for leadership in their prince's place. Regent-Lord Lor'themar has resolved to see his people conquer their addiction completely. Rather than proclaim a new elven dynasty (he neither wants to nor believes that any other elf has a right to), Lor'themar has opted to retain his title of regent, despite his kingly side being encouraged by his ranger-general Halduron Brightwing. With no surviving members of the &lt;a href=\"Sunstrider%20dynasty\"&gt;Sunstrider dynasty&lt;/a&gt;, Lor'themar has thus become the sole ruler of Quel'Thalas.\nDuring this period, the blood elves have fortified the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Isle of Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt;, keeping it well guarded and not open to visitations. Halduron Brightwing now controls access to the revitalized &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;, and the sin'dorei remain ever vigilant. Lor'themar has attempted to mend bridges with what remains of his &lt;a href=\"quel%27dorei\"&gt;quel'dorei&lt;/a&gt; cousins, allowing them access to the sacred Sunwell and offering the exiled inhabitants of a &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Lithien%20Lodge\"&gt;certain lodge&lt;/a&gt; aid and supplies. These attempts have varied in success, the former making pilgrimages to Quel'Thalas and the latter outright declining any assistance.\nKael's decision to ally himself with the Burning Legion, attack &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to steal &lt;a href=\"M%27uru\"&gt;M'uru&lt;/a&gt;, and forcibly put the few pilgrims who reached Outland into harsh labor, effectively severed the ties of loyalty to the twisted prince for all but the most damningly fanatical sin'dorei. Following Kael'thas' demise, a number of the &lt;a href=\"Sunfury\"&gt;Sunfury&lt;/a&gt; forces have returned home to serve their people, rather than follow in Kael's increasingly dark path. Quel'Thalas has since branded Kael'thas a traitor, though the ramifications of this monumental betrayal have shaken its leadership to the core.\nShortly after the reclamation of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; turned his gaze towards conquest. Though Lor'themar was apprehensive to commit to another battle so soon after the events that transpired on Quel'Danas, with &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;'s own brand of insistence the sin'dorei agreed to fight alongside their allies in a renewed &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; campaign to finally end the Lich King and avenge Quel'Thalas.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, the blood elves accompanied the &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Offensive\"&gt;Horde advance&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Aethas%20Sunreaver\"&gt;Archmage Aethas Sunreaver&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful blood elven member of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Six\"&gt;Council of Six&lt;/a&gt;, was instrumental in allowing the Horde a sanctuary in the magical city of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, and his followers, the &lt;a href=\"Sunreavers\"&gt;Sunreavers&lt;/a&gt;, sought to have blood elves admitted as members of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;. The Sunreavers sent numerous battle-mages to the Horde capital cities, in order to allow their allies quick travel to &lt;a href=\"Wintergrasp%20Fortress\"&gt;Wintergrasp Fortress&lt;/a&gt;.\nEventually, the Argent Crusade acquired a foothold in &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt;, and proclaimed the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Tournament\"&gt;Argent Tournament&lt;/a&gt; open. The Sunreavers represented the Horde champions during the tournament, and several blood elves including the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knight\"&gt;Blood Knight&lt;/a&gt; champion, &lt;a href=\"Malithas%20Brightblade\"&gt;Malithas Brightblade&lt;/a&gt;, fought during the spectacle. An ancient quel'dorei blade known as &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Delar\"&gt;Quel'Delar&lt;/a&gt; was discovered sheathed in the snow outside the tournament grounds. Its owner, &lt;a href=\"Thalorien%20Dawnseeker\"&gt;Thalorien Dawnseeker&lt;/a&gt;, had perished valiantly during the Scourge invasion, wielding the blade in defense of the Sunwell. It was later retrieved by Thalorien's good friend, &lt;a href=\"Lana%27thel\"&gt;Lana'thel&lt;/a&gt;, who accompanied Prince Kael'thas into Northrend, where she wielded Quel'Delar against Arthas himself. However, she was cut down and raised into undeath. Now as the Blood-Queen of the &lt;a href=\"San%27layn\"&gt;San'layn&lt;/a&gt;, a fallen sect of &lt;a href=\"Vampyr\"&gt;vampiric&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"darkfallen\"&gt;darkfallen&lt;/a&gt; from that fateful expedition now forced to serve Arthas' will, Lana'thel reappeared and shattered Quel'Delar in an effort to sever all ties of emotion to it. The onlooking elves swore to see it restored.\nThe journey to purify Quel'Delar of its Scourge taint would ultimately lead heroes to the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;, where they were admitted entry once &lt;a href=\"Halduron%20Brightwing\"&gt;Ranger General Halduron Brightwing&lt;/a&gt; gave his permission. Within, &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Rommath\"&gt;Grand Magister Rommath&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt; were seen, along with &lt;a href=\"Auric%20Sunchaser\"&gt;Auric Sunchaser&lt;/a&gt; and groups of elven pilgrims. The purification of Quel'Delar - which varies from near-death for a non-blood elf and all-around praise for a sin'dorei - ended with the reforged blade taken back to Dalaran. Liadrin publicly encouraged her brethren to completely conquer their addiction to magic, using the Sunwell to sustain them on this quest.\n&lt;a href=\"Blood-Queen%20Lana%27thel\"&gt;Blood-Queen Lana'thel&lt;/a&gt; and her &lt;a href=\"San%27layn\"&gt;San'layn&lt;/a&gt; minions would ultimately perish during the battle in &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; himself would follow suit. At long last, the blood elves had achieved their goal of seeing the despoiler of Quel'Thalas fall.\nCataclysm.\nThough relatively unhurt by the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the blood elves of Quel'Thalas were still dealing with sating their addiction. With the encouragement of their Regent Lord, &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;, and the renewed Sunwell's holy energy, a great number of the sin'dorei have resolved to overcome the magical addiction that had plagued their race, though some are still hesitant to abandon their dependence on arcane magic. Over time, the Sunwell's &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; could cure the blood elves of their cursed state, but some still cling to the &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; powers they procured and are hesitant to relinquish them. As ever, the sin'dorei fight to protect Quel'Thalas, and to help redeem the soul of their ancient people.\nThe blood elves seem to have generally accepted Lor'themar Theron's rule in the apparent absence of surviving royalty, or after the last scion's great betrayal. Lor'themar, who had weathered many of the kingdom's darkest days, fittingly will be the one to lead his people into a prosperous future.\nUnder the leadership of &lt;a href=\"High%20Examiner%20Tae%27thelan%20Bloodwatcher\"&gt;High Examiner Tae'thelan Bloodwatcher&lt;/a&gt;, an ancient order known as the &lt;a href=\"Reliquary\"&gt;Reliquary&lt;/a&gt; has resurfaced to support Quel'Thalas and its Horde allies. With the goal of acquiring powerful magical artifacts for the safekeeping, and to free the elves of their magical addiction for good, the agents of the Reliquary have established themselves as a force to be reckoned with. Tae'thelan's goal is somewhat similar to the stated ambition of the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knight\"&gt;Blood Knight&lt;/a&gt; matriarch, &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt;, who has also resolved to see her people overcome the baneful addiction that had so weakened them in the absence of the restored &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;. The Reliquary holds a presence in various zones, including the &lt;a href=\"Badlands\"&gt;Badlands&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Uldaman\"&gt;Uldaman&lt;/a&gt; and at least some degree of &lt;a href=\"Uldum\"&gt;Uldum&lt;/a&gt;.\nBecause their expulsion from night elf society after the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; was due to their use of arcane magic, the blood elves were outraged to hear that the kaldorei had welcomed the &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; back and were tolerating the practice of arcane magic again. After witnessing the \"rookie\" mistakes made by the new kaldorei magi, however, the blood elves are anxiously awaiting whatever mess the kaldorei are going to put themselves in.\nWith the threat of a new &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; empire brewing within Zul'Aman, the &lt;a href=\"Halduron%20Brightwing\"&gt;Ranger General Halduron Brightwing&lt;/a&gt; has called upon the support Vereesa could offer, to which she gladly accepted, though &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20Messenger\"&gt;less than pleased&lt;/a&gt; with this decision. Later, Halduron and a regiment of &lt;a href=\"Farstriders\"&gt;Farstriders&lt;/a&gt; were found on the outskirts of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt;, securing the area and conversing with both the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear\"&gt;Darkspear&lt;/a&gt; Chieftain &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vereesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Vereesa Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;.\nA number of the blood elves seem to have taken on a more active role within the wider Horde following the shattering. &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; himself held court with several representatives of Silvermoon, and the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knight\"&gt;Blood Knight&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Master%20Pyreanor\"&gt;Master Pyreanor&lt;/a&gt; was referred to as one of the Warchief's personal advisors. &lt;a href=\"Envoy%20Sheelah\"&gt;Envoy Sheelah&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20Menerin\"&gt;Guardian Menerin&lt;/a&gt; were sent to &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt; to support the &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Clan\"&gt;Warsong Clan&lt;/a&gt;, though &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;enemy agents&lt;/a&gt; were able to interrupt their plans. Several sin'dorei have carved out a considerable rank in the army sent to conquer the &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href=\"General%20Salaman\"&gt;General Salaman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spy-Mistress%20Anara\"&gt;Spy-Mistress Anara&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Master%20Assassin%20Kel%27istra\"&gt;Master Assassin Kel'istra&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Subjugator%20Devo\"&gt;Subjugator Devo&lt;/a&gt; gained the loyalty of the &lt;a href=\"Boulderslide%20Kobolds\"&gt;Boulderslide Kobolds&lt;/a&gt;, and used them to reinforce &lt;a href=\"Overlord%20Krom%27gar\"&gt;Overlord Krom'gar&lt;/a&gt;'s forces against the Alliance. Following the death of &lt;a href=\"Furien\"&gt;Furien&lt;/a&gt; at the hands of the Alliance in &lt;a href=\"Desolace\"&gt;Desolace&lt;/a&gt;, his bereaved sister &lt;a href=\"Cerelia\"&gt;Cerelia&lt;/a&gt; claimed revenge - which culminated in the eradication of &lt;a href=\"Nijel%27s%20Point\"&gt;Nijel's Point&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt;, several blood elves were found learning more about their heritage from the ancient elven ruins, and &lt;a href=\"Andorel%20Sunsworn\"&gt;Andorel Sunsworn&lt;/a&gt; coordinated the forced removal of the lingering night elves in the area.\nA retelling of elven history concerning the &lt;a href=\"%3ACrystal%20of%20Zin-Malor\"&gt;:Crystal of Zin-Malor&lt;/a&gt; could be undertaken in &lt;a href=\"Winterspring\"&gt;Winterspring&lt;/a&gt;, addressing the intertwining plights of the &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt;, their fallen &lt;a href=\"quel%27dorei\"&gt;quel'dorei&lt;/a&gt; descendants, and the recent venture of a blood elf &lt;a href=\"Farstrider\"&gt;Farstrider&lt;/a&gt; regiment, all of whom met their end on the icy shores of &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Kel%27Theril\"&gt;Lake Kel'Theril&lt;/a&gt;. Their stories were told through three lingering spirits: the &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Spirit\"&gt;Kaldorei Spirit&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Quel%27dorei%20Spirit\"&gt;Quel'dorei Spirit&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Sin%27dorei%20Spirit\"&gt;Sin'dorei Spirit&lt;/a&gt;.\nPost-Cataclysm.\nWith the war between the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; reaching boiling levels, &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Warchief Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; has sought to make his expansionist dreams a reality, beginning (but not ending) with &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore Isle&lt;/a&gt;. The blood elves are viewed as an essential part of the Horde, due in part to their considerable technological advancement, particularly their fearsome &lt;a href=\"mana%20bomb\"&gt;mana bomb&lt;/a&gt; technology.\n&lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; appears to have distanced himself from the thumb of &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; in recent times, in contrast to his almost subservient attitude post-&lt;a href=\"Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, he has gained favor and respect from &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, while keeping himself at a safe distance from the Warchief, too. The Regent Lord has stated that the blood elves are loyal to the Horde that took them in when no one else would, and that loyalty to Garrosh, being its leader, is a result of that, not the cause. Lor'themar and &lt;a href=\"Halduron\"&gt;Halduron&lt;/a&gt; decided to send &lt;a href=\"Kelantir%20Bloodblade\"&gt;Kelantir Bloodblade&lt;/a&gt; and two ships of sin'dorei warriors to fight in Garrosh's war against Theramore, though Kelantir was ultimately assassinated after gravitating more towards the views of &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;, openly questioning Garrosh's methods.\nThe blood elves of Dalaran, now an official part of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"Sunreavers\"&gt;Sunreavers&lt;/a&gt;' successful efforts to have them readmitted as members, found themselves undergoing their own intrigues: &lt;a href=\"Aethas\"&gt;Aethas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt; chose to allow a contingent of Kirin Tor magi to aid Theramore as a deterrent, though the mage the two nominated for the task -- &lt;a href=\"Thalen%20Songweaver\"&gt;Thalen Songweaver&lt;/a&gt;\u2014was revealed to be Garrosh's spy, with knowledge of the theft of the &lt;a href=\"Focusing%20Iris\"&gt;Focusing Iris&lt;/a&gt;. Thalen created a mana bomb for the Warchief which, augmented by the power of the iris, was dropped over Theramore, utterly annihilating it. Thalen's treachery was a blow to Aethas' cause.\nMists of Pandaria.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, blood elven history could be seen with &lt;a href=\"Lorewalker%20Cho\"&gt;Lorewalker Cho&lt;/a&gt;, who made several observations as he viewed figures of the blood elves, their high elven forefathers, and their night elven ancestors, taking special note of the suffering the race had gone through in recent times, the reason behind the blood elves' moniker, the great power the race wields, and the burdens that had come with it.\nLandfall.\nThe blood elves arrived in force to &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Regent Lord Theron&lt;/a&gt; himself leading a retinue of &lt;a href=\"Farstriders\"&gt;rangers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sunfury\"&gt;Sunfury&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knight\"&gt;Blood Knight&lt;/a&gt;s to the scene. The &lt;a href=\"Reliquary\"&gt;Reliquary&lt;/a&gt; has also been deployed, dispersing to uncover secrets long-hidden on the continent. Relations between the sin'dorei and the Horde become strained due to multiple instances of the blood elves' welfare being disregarded by the &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, culminating in Lor'themar contemplating pulling Quel'Thalas out of the Horde, and rejoining the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. As Lor'themar and &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; began the negotiations, however, the &lt;a href=\"Sunreavers\"&gt;Sunreavers&lt;/a&gt; (whose ranks included agents of Garrosh Hellscream willing to risk their neutrality for his sake) were violently expelled from Dalaran by &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, who declared the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;'s allegiance to the Alliance. In retaliation, &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Rommath\"&gt;Grand Magister Rommath&lt;/a&gt; assaulted Dalaran in an effort to rescue &lt;a href=\"Aethas%20Sunreaver\"&gt;Aethas Sunreaver&lt;/a&gt; and the Sunreavers. He succeeded in his mission, coming to the aid of many wounded Sunreavers, forewarning those unaware of the danger, and freeing Aethas himself from the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Citadel\"&gt;Violet Citadel&lt;/a&gt;. In the aftermath of this, the Sunreavers came to hold Garrosh as responsible for their removal from Dalaran as Jaina herself.\nThough Jaina's purge ended the negotiations with the Alliance and forced the sin'dorei back to Hellscream's Horde, Lor'themar was incensed at Garrosh regardless, and relations between them fell apart. Consequently, Lor'themar ordered Halduron and Rommath to assemble the rangers and magisters and stated that the time had come for the sin'dorei to take matters into their own hands.\nThe Thunder King.\nOn the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Isle of Thunder&lt;/a&gt;, Lor'themar led the &lt;a href=\"Sunreaver%20Onslaught\"&gt;Sunreaver Onslaught&lt;/a&gt;, which gathers members from all different forces of Silvermoon: the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knights\"&gt;Blood Knights&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"spellbreaker\"&gt;spellbreaker&lt;/a&gt;s, the &lt;a href=\"Farstriders\"&gt;Farstriders&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Magisters\"&gt;Magisters&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Reliquary\"&gt;Reliquary&lt;/a&gt; and obviously, the &lt;a href=\"Sunreavers\"&gt;Sunreavers&lt;/a&gt;. The assault was directed to counteract the &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20King\"&gt;Thunder King&lt;/a&gt; and their &lt;a href=\"Zandalari\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; allies, their goal was to recoup all useful titanic artifacts from the &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; in order to guarantee their survival during the Horde's crisis. During the conquest, they often confronted the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor%20Offensive\"&gt;Kirin Tor Offensive&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe blood elves &lt;a href=\"The%20Crimson%20Treader\"&gt;came&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"The%20Starchaser\"&gt;three&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Salabria\"&gt;destroyers&lt;/a&gt; and succeeded in the construction of a base on Isle of Thunder thanks to &lt;a href=\"Scout%20Captain%20Elsia\"&gt;Scout Captain Elsia&lt;/a&gt;, naming it &lt;a href=\"Dawnseeker%20Promontory\"&gt;Dawnseeker Promontory&lt;/a&gt; in honor of &lt;a href=\"Thalorien%20Dawnseeker\"&gt;Thalorien Dawnseeker&lt;/a&gt;. The war raged and the blood elves, led by Lor'themar on the front, broke the wall of the fortress. With the &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan%20Assault\"&gt;Shado-Pan Assault&lt;/a&gt;, they took the &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Forges\"&gt;Thunder Forges&lt;/a&gt; and tried to prevent the resurrection of &lt;a href=\"Nalak\"&gt;Nalak&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href=\"Bloodied%20Crossing\"&gt;confronting&lt;/a&gt; their alliance counterpart directly. Ultimately, they took the anima of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Animus\"&gt;Dark Animus&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Throne of Thunder&lt;/a&gt;, which has been analyzed by Aethas.\nSiege of Orgrimmar.\nLed by Lor'themar, the blood elves sailed from Pandaria to Durotar to help both &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Rebellion\"&gt;Vol'jin's rebellion&lt;/a&gt; and most of the Alliance in their battle against Garrosh. They helped take control of &lt;a href=\"Bladefist%20Bay\"&gt;Bladefist Bay&lt;/a&gt; and made contact with &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt;. With the combined forces, Garrosh was ultimately defeated.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20in%20Draenor\"&gt;war in Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, the blood elven &lt;a href=\"Sunsworn\"&gt;Sunsworn&lt;/a&gt; force traveled to under &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt;'s command. They fought with the in defense of and . It was said that their role in the expansion would bring their understanding of the Light and the origin of &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s full circle from \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;The Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;\", but this plot thread was ultimately not touched upon.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Reliquary\"&gt;Reliquary&lt;/a&gt; also made their way to Draenor, clashing with the &lt;a href=\"Explorers%27%20League\"&gt;Explorers' League&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Steamwheedle%20Cartel\"&gt;Steamwheedle Cartel&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Ashran\"&gt;Ashran&lt;/a&gt;, the former in search of an ancient artifact and the latter over the ethics of hoarding magical items versus selling them for profit.\nLegion.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, blood elf &lt;a href=\"demon%20hunter\"&gt;demon hunter&lt;/a&gt;s belonging to the &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt; made their return, having been sent on a mission by their &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;progenitor&lt;/a&gt; some ten years beforehand during the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt;. Like their night elf counterparts, their demonic features and heavy reliance on fel magic has caused them to be frowned upon by their people, but their great powers will prove invaluable in the battle against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe sin'dorei also appear during the final stages of the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20rebellion\"&gt;Nightfallen rebellion&lt;/a&gt;. The blood elven army, led by Lady Liadrin and Grand Magister Rommath, joined forces (albeit uneasily) with the night elves and the high elves to help free &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar City&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Elisande\"&gt;Grand Magistrix Elisande&lt;/a&gt;'s, and by extension, the Legion's control.\nAt some point in the past, a group of blood elf scholars led by &lt;a href=\"Magister%20Umbric\"&gt;Magister Umbric&lt;/a&gt; was exiled from Silvermoon for their experimentation with the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;. After an altercation with &lt;a href=\"void%20ethereal\"&gt;void ethereal&lt;/a&gt;s, Umbric and his brethren were transformed into &lt;a href=\"Void%20elf\"&gt;void elves&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, the first mortal to succeed at mastering the Void, came to the aid of her kin and taught the void elves how to control the shadows. Through her, they pledged their newfound powers to the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. After the ren'dorei made &lt;a href=\"Telogrus%20Rift\"&gt;Telogrus Rift&lt;/a&gt; their new base of operations, a few &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20Scholar\"&gt;Silvermoon Scholar&lt;/a&gt;s traveled to the broken world in order to better study the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nThe shared history of the blood elves with the &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt;, as well as their assistance with the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20rebellion\"&gt;rebellion&lt;/a&gt;, played a major role in bringing them into the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;. Following the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Battle for Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, Quel'Thalas was also known to be one of the last bastions of Horde power in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;. Blood elven soldiers played a moderate role during the war, participating in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Stromgarde\"&gt;Battle for Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Faction%20Assaults\"&gt;Faction Assaults&lt;/a&gt; with the rest of the Horde troops.\nPopulation.\nThe Scourge invasion of Quel'Thalas ended with the slaughter of roughly 90% of the high elven people. Following the Quel'dorei's decimation at the hands of the Scourge, Kael'thas rallied roughly 90% of the survivors, who took up the name \"blood elf\" in honor of their fallen brethren.\nFollowing the blood elves' abandonment of &lt;a href=\"Garithos\"&gt;Garithos&lt;/a&gt;' &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20resistance\"&gt;Alliance resistance&lt;/a&gt;, Kael'thas took 15% of the blood elven people to find and claim a new homeland in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, while the remaining 85% remained on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; to reclaim &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; from the Scourge. After Kael'thas' defeat a number of the Sunfury returned to their brethren in Quel'Thalas.\nRegarding the current blood elf population: the high elf population of survivors was &lt;a href=\"High%20elf%23Population\"&gt;estimated around 1,481&lt;/a&gt;, or 10%, meaning the 90% that became blood elves would be put at least 13,329.\nOf the 15% of the blood elf population went to Outland (at least 2,000) one faction became &lt;a href=\"Felblood%20elf\"&gt;felblood elves&lt;/a&gt;, with another becoming the neutral &lt;a href=\"Scryers\"&gt;Scryers&lt;/a&gt; faction who remained in Outland and are not under Slivermoon. Also considering the casualties suffered in Outland, there is the question of what percentage of the 15% died, became Felblood elves or remained among the Scryers.\nOf the 85% that remained behind in Quel'Thalas (around 11,000) how many were exiled and became &lt;a href=\"Void%20elf\"&gt;Void elves&lt;/a&gt;, became &lt;a href=\"Wretched\"&gt;Wretched&lt;/a&gt;, as well as further losses from various conflicts.\nPhysical appearance.\nOn average, blood elven women are 5'9\" tall while blood elven men usually stand around 6'3\" in height, with males typically having slender, muscular, and athletic bodies. They also possess long pointy ears, acute senses and keen sight in the darkness. Night elves have long, slanted ears while blood elves' ears are shorter and tend to point upwards. Blood elven females can possess much the same, albeit typically sporting a slim elven physique. Like all elves, blood elves are considered highly attractive by the standards of most mortal races. They typically have fairly long hair, generally do not grow their facial hair to gigantic proportions until old age, and generally stand slightly taller than their human gender counterparts. As a general rule, blood elves are also slim, athletic, strong, and graceful. Furthermore, they all have large pointed ears that tend to be greeted with admiration (or mockery) by other races.\nBlood elves are, biologically and physiologically, high elves.\nBlood elves who were most loyal to Kael'thas Sunstrider were gifted by &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; with the privilege of engorging themselves on copious amounts of demonic blood, seemingly hastening their demonic evolution into what has come to be known as &lt;a href=\"Felblood%20elf\"&gt;felblood elves&lt;/a&gt;, developing a variety of demonic traits in the process. Those blood elves and high elves who succumb to their magical addiction and descend into madness are counted among the &lt;a href=\"wretched\"&gt;wretched&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe sin'dorei are the favored &lt;a href=\"humanoid\"&gt;humanoid&lt;/a&gt; form of the &lt;a href=\"red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;.\nEyes.\nBlood elves' eyes are well-attuned to the dark and \"pierce the gloom,\" a trait they thank their &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elven&lt;/a&gt; ancestry for. Blood elves can visually identify the hue of arcane energy around objects or people, as well as the ebb and flow of such magic.\nBlood elf eyes glow with magical energy, the color of which depends on the individual elf's source of power, or prolonged exposure to a certain kind of magic.\nIn \"World of Warcraft\", blood elves have access to varying shades of four eye colors:\nSome sources depict them differently, and with other eye colors:\nAging.\nBlood elves can potentially reach up to several thousand years of life. It appears that physical maturation is roughly on par with &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; aging, as seen with several young elves (such as Valeera Sanguinar, who was a child during the Scourge invasion yet physically mature a few years later), though only up to a point. The aging process appears to even out at around their physical peak before their aging becomes more sporadic and typically elven.\nHow fast they age precisely is unknown, but the oldest of their kind seem to be roughly 3,000 years old. &lt;a href=\"Anasterian%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Anasterian Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;, the High King of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, was extremely long-lived, having presided over a number of long-standing conflicts and died in around his three-thousandth year. By this time, his physical appearance had become elderly and wizened, suggesting that typical blood/high elven old age is induced around that time period. Lady Liadrin specifically attributed his elderly appearance to his 3,000 years of age in \"&lt;a href=\"Blood%20of%20the%20Highborne\"&gt;Blood of the Highborne&lt;/a&gt;\".\nIn addition to this, the &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf%20engineer\"&gt;blood elven engineers&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Secret%20Level%20Powerup\"&gt;Secret Level Powerup&lt;/a&gt; tell &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Kael%27thas\"&gt;Prince Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt; that they \"built &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;'s original defenses\". Given that the events of the Secret Level Powerup take place in the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; and the original defenses of Dalaran were erected almost 2700 years prior to this, this would lead us to assume that the engineers themselves were older than this. However, because of the fact the blood elven engineers only exist in a secret level, the extent of which they are canonical is debatable, as specified in their article. &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; also mentions that the &lt;a href=\"Sunreavers\"&gt;Sunreavers&lt;/a&gt; contain members who had taught humans magic to begin with, implying that some among them are over two thousand years old. This was further muddied by the addition of &lt;a href=\"Lorash%20Sunbeam\"&gt;Lorash Sunbeam&lt;/a&gt;, a blood elf whose backstory explicitly puts his age at over 7,000: he was born after the exile of the Highborne, but before Quel'Thalas was founded, meaning that he was a Highborne night elf and among those who gained high elf forms after the creation of the Sunwell. This would make Lorash by far the oldest known Thalassian elf in the lore, but also creates inconsistencies.\nCulture.\nThe term \"blood elf\" itself is a cultural identity: a show of respect and honor for the fall of the high elves, the destruction of the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;, the near-annihilation of their kingdom, and their rebirth from its ashes. It is also a reference to their royal lineage\u2014their \"blood\"line. As a culture, the sin'dorei have retained the look and feel of their fallen high elven kingdom, though they've developed a greater penchant for the color red. Crimson-red robes, decor, and armor have become far more commonplace within blood elven society since the fall of the high elven people, a reference to the blood of their many brethren who had perished in the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe traditional blood elven colors are red, gold, and, to a lesser extent, blue\u2014all of which can be seen on their racial crest, the &lt;a href=\"Icon%20of%20Blood\"&gt;Icon of Blood&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn general, the blood elves are a proud, pragmatic, and somewhat jingoistic people; they place great emphasis on their love for their homeland and are ruthless to their enemies, as demonstrated by many of their in-game quotes. Their reputation for isolationism is well-earned, and many prefer to keep to their own kind. However, they are not an evil people. Blood elves are a resilient race of survivors, and their most prominent figures stand as beacons of courage, tenacity, and the strength to fight on, regardless of what foes stand in their way.\nIn the past, Quel'Thalas hosted bright, pompous ceremonies with mock battles and pageantry, but the various calamities the former high elves have had to endure have caused them to become much grimmer and more bitter. While they still love their luxuries and comforts, they now consider such excessive displays to be distasteful in the wake of the tragedies suffered by their people.\nBlood elven architecture is of the same illustrious and elegant design as it was when &lt;a href=\"Dath%27Remar%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Dath'Remar Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; founded Quel'Thalas. It involves pendulous creations of wondrous curves and columns, their designs involving natural, floral, flowing, animal motifs. Their fountains seem to defy physical boundaries, creating or warping water in impossible ways.\nThe study of the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; is as frowned upon in blood elf society as it is among the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Rommath\"&gt;Grand Magister Rommath&lt;/a&gt; once clashed with &lt;a href=\"Magister%20Umbric\"&gt;Magister Umbric&lt;/a&gt; and his disciples, who had pursued research into the Void against his wishes, and ordered their exile on the grounds that the Void poses a direct threat to the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;.\nA frequent consumer of &lt;a href=\"%3Abloodthistle\"&gt;:bloodthistle&lt;/a&gt; is called a \"thistlehead\", and looked down upon by common blood elf society.\nLanguage.\nBlood elves speak &lt;a href=\"Thalassian\"&gt;Thalassian&lt;/a&gt;, the language of their ancient race. They originally spoke &lt;a href=\"Darnassian\"&gt;Darnassian&lt;/a&gt;, leading to some overlap and linguistic similarities between the two languages, but with time their language evolved to the modern one. By the time of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, their elder tongue had been almost forgotten.\nSeveral of the common sin'dorei sayings spoken in-game have been translated by the Warcraft Encyclopedia's entry on Thalassian, and can be &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Thalassian\"&gt;found here&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn \"World of Warcraft,\" blood elf players speak Thalassian and &lt;a href=\"Orcish%20%28language%29\"&gt;Orcish&lt;/a&gt;.\nNaming.\nIn contrast to their night elven cousins, blood elven naming conventions tend to favor the concepts of the day, the sun, and brightness/light/fire over the night, the moon, and darkness. A prefix referencing one in some way (\"Brightwing,\" \"Sunhallow,\" \"Dawnglow,\" \"Blazefeather,\" etc.) is quite common in many blood elven surnames. However, some others eschew this altogether and have fairly standard elven names that evoke no particular imagery; Lor'themar Theron himself is a prominent example of this.\nUnlike the high elves, however, a number of blood elves have taken on more aggressive surnames - often incorporating the word \"blood\" into their identity, which had not been heard of prior to the sin'dorei coming to power. Presumably, this is to better illustrate their cultural identity and their drive for vengeance, as many blood elves would have lost family members during the Scourge massacre. Some blood elves changed their surnames as a further homage to their fallen people and loved ones, taking names such as \"Bloodwatcher,\" \"Bloodblade,\" and \"Bloodwrath.\" This is also particularly prevalent within the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knight\"&gt;Blood Knight order&lt;/a&gt;, which displays a number of members bearing the term - \"Bloodvalor\" and \"Bloodsworn\" among others. A number of blood elven ranks, titles, and organization names are similarly fashioned, such as &lt;a href=\"Bloodwarder\"&gt;Bloodwarder&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"blood%20mage\"&gt;blood mage&lt;/a&gt;s, and of course the blood knights themselves.\nClasses.\nThe blood elves have a considerable plethora of classes available: &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s (often representing &lt;a href=\"Farstriders\"&gt;Farstriders&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s (often representing &lt;a href=\"Magisters\"&gt;Magisters&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s (often representing &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knights\"&gt;Blood Knights&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"monk\"&gt;monk&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"demon%20hunter\"&gt;demon hunter&lt;/a&gt;s. \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;The Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt;\" also marked the debut of blood elven &lt;a href=\"blood%20mage\"&gt;blood mage&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"spellbreaker\"&gt;spellbreaker&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"dragonhawk%20rider\"&gt;dragonhawk rider&lt;/a&gt;s, priests and &lt;a href=\"sorceress\"&gt;sorceress&lt;/a&gt;es, the latter three being the post-&lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; incarnations of their high elven selves.\nAll of these classes can be seen in modern \"World of Warcraft\" to some degree; however, during &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas\"&gt;Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt;'s assault on the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Isle of Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt;, the formidable Spellbreakers' ranks were thinned drastically when their headquarters was overwhelmed by Kael'thas and his Burning Legion forces. The lone squad that remains now exists as a relic of a bygone era, as the Spellbreakers have refrained from training any new recruits since Kael'thas' betrayal. That said, sometime later, Lor'themar Theron himself ordered a revitalization of Spellbreaker training, leading to a &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20Spellbreaker\"&gt;resurgence&lt;/a&gt; of Spellbreakers among the blood elves' ranks. Blood elves are also one of the two races to successfully complete &lt;a href=\"demon%20hunter\"&gt;demon hunter&lt;/a&gt; training, along with their night elven cousins.\nElves part of the Scourge have demonstrated the ability to become necromancers. &lt;a href=\"High%20Botanist%20Freywinn\"&gt;High Botanist Freywinn&lt;/a&gt; is an arcanist close to plants.\nBlood elves have at least one active lore character to represent most of their classes: &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar\"&gt;Lor'themar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Halduron\"&gt;Halduron&lt;/a&gt; for hunters (and arguably warriors); &lt;a href=\"Rommath\"&gt;Rommath&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tae%27thelan%20Bloodwatcher\"&gt;Tae'thelan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Aethas\"&gt;Aethas&lt;/a&gt; for mages; &lt;a href=\"Liadrin\"&gt;Liadrin&lt;/a&gt; for paladins (and arguably priests); &lt;a href=\"Valeera%20Sanguinar\"&gt;Valeera&lt;/a&gt; for rogues; and &lt;a href=\"Koltira\"&gt;Koltira&lt;/a&gt; for death knights. The exceptions are warlocks and monks.\nSymbolism.\nThe blood elves use a &lt;a href=\"phoenix\"&gt;phoenix&lt;/a&gt; as their main motif. The phoenix is found on their banners, their racial crest (the &lt;a href=\"Icon%20of%20Blood\"&gt;Icon of Blood&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Bow%20of%20Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;weaponry&lt;/a&gt;, buildings, tents, and many other sightings. Metaphorically, the nature of the phoenix represents their \"rebirth\" from the ashes of their sundered brethren \u2014 the blood elves metaphorically 'died' as high elves and were reborn as blood elves, and as a more formidable people from the experience. A sentiment also reflected by the blood elves' moniker. Generally, the phoenix is portrayed as gold and emblazoned upon a red background, though it has several alterations and variations:\nBeliefs and practices.\nThe blood elves venerate the metaphorical idea of the \"&lt;a href=\"sun\"&gt;sun&lt;/a&gt;\" in their culture, and even incorporated it into their social greetings and farewells. This reverence is the polar opposite belief of their &lt;a href=\"night%20elven\"&gt;night elven&lt;/a&gt; cousins, who hold the &lt;a href=\"moon\"&gt;moon&lt;/a&gt; in a similarly high regard. This stems from elven society centering on the age-old &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;, which had empowered and protected Quel'Thalas and its citizens for a strong 7,000 years prior to its destruction. Following the loss of the Sunwell, Quel'Thalas' citizens came to incorporate the notion of \"remembrance\" in honor of their fallen fount - \"Remember the Sunwell.\"\nThe blood elven crest, seen on many banners, &lt;a href=\"tabard\"&gt;tabard&lt;/a&gt;s, and buildings in and outside of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, depicts a phoenix. Metaphorically, this represents the blood elves' \"rebirth\" from the ashes of their destroyed kingdom and brethren, sundered in the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, and as a more formidable people for having done so.\nAs high elves, several blood elves were members of the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Church of the Light&lt;/a&gt;. Following the &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20invasion%20of%20Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Scourge invasion of Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, most of the elves became disillusioned with the Light, holding it in contempt for failing their homeland in its hour of greatest need. One of the most prominent followers of this mindset was the &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;High priestess Liadrin&lt;/a&gt;, who renounced her vows to the Light due to this supposed abandonment. A disillusioned Liadrin and many of her followers would later use the Light as a tool, as they came to incorporate the notion of \"bending\" the Light to their will, forcibly taking it rather than relying on faith to wield it, though some blood elven priests outside of the ruined kingdom remained faithful in the Light's guidance and continued to wield it. As the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knights\"&gt;Blood Knights&lt;/a&gt;, they came to incorporate the notion of \"bending\" the Light to their will, and seeing themselves as its true masters as a result of this dominion: the other paladins of the world are forced to live by a strict moral doctrine when wielding the Light and its blessings, yet the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knight\"&gt;Blood Knight&lt;/a&gt;s had efficiently circumvented this by using &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Prince Kael'thas's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mana%20Tap\"&gt;teachings&lt;/a&gt; on the captured &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"M%27uru\"&gt;M'uru&lt;/a&gt;, siphoning his Light-given energy to fuel their paladin-esque abilities.\nBy the time of the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt;, the priest trainers of Quel'Thalas said that the path of a priest was often misconstrued as a path of pacifism; and for the blood elves, this couldn't be further from the truth. Not only do they mend bone and spirit, but they also act as a fist of vengeance for those who would transgress against the sin'dorei. The trainers also refer to giving \"sermons,\" a phrasing largely associated with holy blessings and, by extension, Light worship. Note that blood elven priests are separated from the &lt;a href=\"Magisters\"&gt;Magisters&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the restoration of the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;, now a mixture of both holy and arcane power, the Blood Knights abandoned wielding holy energies by force and returned to their old ways. Through the Sunwell they would ask for the Light's blessing to wield their powers. It is a harmonious relationship, free of the pain and discord of their previous method, they no longer suffer from its associated negative effects. To wield the Light through the Sunwell, a typical Blood Knight must have strong willpower and faith in their own ability. Although possible to \"steal\" the Light from the Sunwell in the same way they did from M'uru, Lady Liadrin has moved the blood knights away from that type of abuse.\nThere are many other beliefs and practices found within blood elf society, and a number of which have clashing ideals - such as the beliefs and policies of the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knights\"&gt;Blood Knights&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Farstriders\"&gt;Farstriders&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvery year, a champion to the blood elves is asked to perform an act of remembrance in honor of those who fell to the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. That champion then carries a lantern containing flames of remembrance taken from the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt; itself.\nMagical addiction.\nSince the destruction of the Sunwell at the hands of &lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, the blood elves have been forced to deal with the sudden relapse of their addiction to arcane energy. A constant curse since the original &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; was destroyed, the addiction has become more powerful than ever. Blood elves spend their waking days struggling with their weakness, seeking either to sate it by siphoning magical energy from their surroundings, getting by with mana crystals, or to resist the urge to feed.\nWhile the blood elves do not abstain from draining arcane power directly, they are careful to keep their addictions under control, keeping the power their new abilities offer while maintaining self-discipline. Those who lose control over their addiction change into &lt;a href=\"Wretched\"&gt;Wretched&lt;/a&gt;, and invariably fall into insanity and corruption.\nOn several occasions after the Sunwell's defilement, Kael'thas publicly asserted that his people would die unless they found a new source of magic. There can be no doubt that withdrawal from prolonged exposure to arcane magic is a very unpleasant process: to this day it is not impossible that a high elf might choose to give in to the addiction and become one of the blood elves. Technically, though, the prince was mistaken. According to the top priests and medics on Azeroth, the only high elves who perished due to the Sunwell's loss were the very old, the very young, and those already in poor health.\nThis is not to say, however, that withdrawal from magic would leave the elves unharmed. On the contrary, permanent mental or physical damage is possible.\nEven so, the prince's relatively quick acceptance of dire measures (e.g., draining magic from demons) is by no means characteristic of blood elves in general. The blood elves of Outland have by now discovered Kael'thas' agreement with Illidan, and they have for the most part become convinced of its necessity. Most blood elves still live on Azeroth, though. Few of these elves know of Kael'thas' pact with Illidan, and many would be horrified if they discovered it. Draining magic from small mana-bearing vermin is a far cry from draining magic from demons. Yet, as their hunger grew, blood elves\u2014particularly those in Outland\u2014were becoming increasingly inured to the things they must do in order to obtain more magic.\nAs &lt;a href=\"Arcanist%20Helion\"&gt;Arcanist Helion&lt;/a&gt; says: \"Control your thirst for magic... It is a thirst unending.\"\nIn his report on &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; reported that blood elves were addicted to both, arcane and fel magic.\nCounteracting magic withdrawal.\nThe elves had been sustained by the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt; for several millennia, during which time they had become dependent upon its power. The need to feed upon the &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; only became truly apparent after the Sunwell's destruction when the elves were cut off from the constant flow of magic the well suffused every fiber of their beings with.\nBereft of their Sunwell, the blood elves were forced to deal with their addiction differently. Through &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; (who maintained that magical addiction cannot be conquered by any means, only sated), Prince Kael'thas acquired the teachings of stripping arcane magic from other sources, be it mana-bearing items or creatures. This process was dubbed the \"&lt;a href=\"%3AMana%20Tap\"&gt;:Mana Tap&lt;/a&gt;,\" and became an important and increasingly essential part of the elves' lives. Kael instructed &lt;a href=\"Rommath\"&gt;Rommath&lt;/a&gt; to spread these teachings back home in &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, as a way to sate\u2014but not cure\u2014the elves' addiction to magic. The knowledge was passed down until all blood elves had learned the techniques necessary to draw arcane energies from crystals, artifacts, creatures, or even mortals who commanded such power. This technique was a cause of contention: &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Lithien%20Lodge\"&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; deemed it as immoral, while others callously overused it and were physically warped into what became known as the &lt;a href=\"Wretched\"&gt;Wretched&lt;/a&gt;.\nUltimately, the Sunwell was restored, now a mixture of both arcane and &lt;a href=\"holy\"&gt;holy&lt;/a&gt; magic. With this inspiring turn of events, the elven addiction has - for the most part - begun to come back under control, as it was before the well's loss. With &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Regent Lord Lor'themar Theron's&lt;/a&gt; encouragement, the ability to sate their addiction conveniently via the Sunwell, and the plight of the &lt;a href=\"Reliquary\"&gt;Reliquary&lt;/a&gt; to free the elves of what remains of their addiction for good, the blood elves are on a far more efficient (and less dangerous) path to be free of their bane. However, a few elves remain enthralled by their former methods of gaining power, and are not eager to give up on them.\nMounts and companions.\nThe blood elves' most common mount is the &lt;a href=\"hawkstrider\"&gt;hawkstrider&lt;/a&gt;, a cockatrice-like creature that appears to be native to the forests of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, found no-where else in &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; aside from in the blood elves' care. When &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas\"&gt;Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt; led his followers to the ruined world of &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, the vibrant hawkstriders that were brought with them proved to be welcome reminders of the blood elves' beauteous home in &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;. Valued for their trustworthiness and speed, these colorful avian creatures embody the inherent splendor of the forests within the blood elven kingdom. While tragedy has befallen Quel'Thalas in recent years, the hawkstriders remain an integral part of the elves' day-to-day lives.\nThe sin'dorei once had a natural affinity with the creatures of Eversong. The &lt;a href=\"mana%20wyrm\"&gt;mana wyrm&lt;/a&gt;s once served as guardians to the various crystals and arcane structures around the elven kingdom. However, they have since become maddened by the Scourge invasion, and the blood elves have even been seen to feed upon them. The &lt;a href=\"lynx\"&gt;lynx&lt;/a&gt;es and &lt;a href=\"treant\"&gt;treant&lt;/a&gt;s were also once allies of the elves, though without the ability to control the recalcitrant former and formerly cooperative latter, they have also become hostile in the wake of the Scourge attack. More recently, mana wyrms have been &lt;a href=\"Sunreaver%20Mana%20Wyrm\"&gt;deployed&lt;/a&gt; by the blood elves on the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Isle of Thunder&lt;/a&gt;, as a countermeasure against hostile magic-users.\n&lt;a href=\"Dragonhawk\"&gt;Dragonhawk&lt;/a&gt;s are another creature the blood elves have a positive relationship with. They have been used as flying mounts, and have battled alongside their elven masters in several conflicts. The &lt;a href=\"Farstriders\"&gt;Farstriders&lt;/a&gt; mounted them for an aerial assault against the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, and the blood elves would also employ this tactic against Arthas in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; - during both of their visits.\nBlood elves have been shown to keep cats around their cities and settlements, the proud and independent creature perhaps reflective of the blood elves' own attitude. In addition, blood elves have employed all manners of arcane-empowered indulgences, such as magical brooms to sweep the streets, crystals found all around Silvermoon, and flower ornaments found in magical levitation.\nConstructs, inventions, and weaponry.\nThe blood elves keep and control a large number of magically-imbued guardians to supplement their own guard force, named the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20guardian\"&gt;Arcane Guardians&lt;/a&gt;. These hulking, robotic constructs serve as &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt;'s elite patrol force, with the ability to seek out and destroy enemies regardless of where they &lt;a href=\"stealth\"&gt;hide&lt;/a&gt;. They are also employed by the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knight\"&gt;Blood Knight order&lt;/a&gt;, as seen with &lt;a href=\"Gatewatcher%20Aendor\"&gt;Gatewatcher Aendor&lt;/a&gt; and his ilk, and the &lt;a href=\"Scryers\"&gt;Scryers&lt;/a&gt; have also created their own guardians. After the reclamation of the Sunwell, the Arcane Guardians have also been stationed around the holy font of power to assist the blood elven guard force there. It appears that these guardians were created during the reign of &lt;a href=\"Anasterian%20Sunstrider\"&gt;King Anasterian&lt;/a&gt;, though the quel'dorei had never been seen to make use of them prior to their conversion to sin'dorei.\nThe Arcane Guardians have also been used as a propagandistic tool by the &lt;a href=\"magisters\"&gt;magisters&lt;/a&gt;, and will periodically remind citizens that the laws of Silvermoon must be obeyed, that &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; will lead them to power and glory, that Quel'Thalas will remain strong in the wake of Kael'thas' betrayal, and will openly encourage the citizens of Silvermoon to live their lives in happiness.\nIn addition to the standard golems, the blood elves under Prince Kael'thas and &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; created powerful alterations of the standard arcane guardian, dubbed the &lt;a href=\"fel%20golem\"&gt;fel golem&lt;/a&gt;s, towering constructs surging with &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; power. The &lt;a href=\"Sunreaver%20Onslaught\"&gt;Sunreaver Onslaught&lt;/a&gt; further elaborated upon the fel golem design, creating new constructs (the &lt;a href=\"Pyrestar%20Demolisher\"&gt;Pyrestar Demolisher&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Haywire%20Sunreaver%20Construct\"&gt;Haywire Sunreaver Construct&lt;/a&gt;) capable of more diverse and powerful abilities, sans the demonic input. Furthermore, the blood elves have acquired the use of &lt;a href=\"blood%20golem\"&gt;blood golem&lt;/a&gt;s, formidable mechanical constructs forged in the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Throne of Thunder&lt;/a&gt;, formerly under &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen\"&gt;Lei Shen&lt;/a&gt;'s command.\nOn &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Sunfury\"&gt;Sunfury&lt;/a&gt; blood elves created the &lt;a href=\"mana%20bomb\"&gt;mana bomb&lt;/a&gt;, an arcane-based weapon capable of great destruction. Both &lt;a href=\"Kirin%27Var%20Village\"&gt;Kirin'Var Village&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Thicket\"&gt;Cenarion Thicket&lt;/a&gt; were wholly annihilated by the mana bombs' force, while another was procured for an attack on &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore Isle&lt;/a&gt;; further empowered by the &lt;a href=\"Focusing%20Iris\"&gt;Focusing Iris&lt;/a&gt;, the bomb destroyed the entire isle. &lt;a href=\"Case%20of%20Tactical%20Mana%20Bombs\"&gt;Tactical mana bombs&lt;/a&gt; have also been produced, albeit their volatile nature makes them ill-suited for use by rank-and-file soldiers.\nFloating crystals adorn several blood elven cities and outposts. These come in two flavors: the &lt;a href=\"fel%20crystal\"&gt;fel crystal&lt;/a&gt;s (also referred to as &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crystal\"&gt;Burning Crystal&lt;/a&gt;s on &lt;a href=\"Sunstrider%20Isle\"&gt;Sunstrider Isle&lt;/a&gt;), and the more standard &lt;a href=\"mana%20crystal\"&gt;mana crystal&lt;/a&gt;s. The former is a device created by the &lt;a href=\"Magisters\"&gt;Magisters&lt;/a&gt; to store &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic energy; in this state, several magi were seen to drain power from the crystals directly. They were once found around Quel'Thalas, though Rommath stated that they were removed after the Sunwell was restored. The mana crystals (alternatively named the arcane crystals, defense crystals, or bloodgem crystals) are a more conventional creation (and implicitly the original form of the fel crystals), which can be used to scry, power defenses, strike at aerial enemies, and create magical shields over towns and outposts.\nAn &lt;a href=\"Orb%20of%20Translocation\"&gt;Orb of Translocation&lt;/a&gt; is a swirling red orb of blood elven manufacture, a device used to teleport oneself either short or far distances within the world. They are common in &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;.\nRelations.\nThe blood elves are a proud people, and as history has shown, they prefer to keep to their own company. &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; enjoyed seclusion from the younger races for a long while, until both the &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Wars\"&gt;Troll Wars&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; forced them into alliances with humanity. Despite this, Quel'Thalas was quick to retreat back into independent seclusion until the Scourge invasion - at which point, they began to actively seek new allies under &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;'s directive. They are currently members of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe blood elves have a somewhat divided opinion on what remains of their &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elven&lt;/a&gt; brethren. Some, such as &lt;a href=\"Halduron%20Brightwing\"&gt;Halduron Brightwing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tae%27thelan%20Bloodwatcher\"&gt;Tae'thelan Bloodwatcher&lt;/a&gt;, have expressed no particular grudge or strong feelings towards the quel'dorei remnants; the former has referred to the elven race collectively as the \"children of Silvermoon,\" while the latter has outright stated his intention to free the elves from their addiction, and unite them as the proud race they once were. Lor'themar Theron and Halduron have allowed them access to the Sunwell, though Lor'themar himself has also displayed some hostility towards some high elves such as &lt;a href=\"Vereesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Vereesa Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, who had opposed the blood elves' inclusion into the Kirin Tor.\nMany blood elves once had strong ties to &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;, having produced productive members of the Kirin Tor for over 2,000 years, Prince Kael'thas himself having studied there and &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Rommath\"&gt;Grand Magister Rommath&lt;/a&gt; having once lived there. However, the Kirin Tor did not intervene when Grand Marshal Garithos sentenced the blood elves to an unjust death, leaving Rommath and his magisters to hold a strong hatred towards them for it. With the blood elven Archmage &lt;a href=\"Aethas%20Sunreaver\"&gt;Aethas Sunreaver&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Six\"&gt;Council of Six&lt;/a&gt;, and existing members of the Six expressing a desire to reestablish good relations with the blood elves, some sin'dorei have welcomed the ability to rejoin the Kirin Tor, though Rommath's disdain for this notion still persists. Archmage Athas holds a strong position in the Kirin Tor, whose followers (who bear his namesake, the &lt;a href=\"Sunreavers\"&gt;Sunreavers&lt;/a&gt;) have secured a large portion of the city of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; for the blood elves and their allies' use. It appears Rommath's outlook on the Kirin Tor has been more prevalent in recent times, following the violent purge of the Horde from Dalaran.\nThe high/blood elves have some history with the &lt;a href=\"red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, most of whom prefer to transform into elves (specifically sin'dorei) when assuming a mortal form. It was the Reds who gifted &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Delar\"&gt;Quel'Delar&lt;/a&gt; to the high elves (&lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; personally handed it to &lt;a href=\"Anasterian\"&gt;Anasterian&lt;/a&gt;), and her consort &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Korialstrasz&lt;/a&gt; maintained an interest in the elves' affairs, arriving only narrowly too late to save the Sunwell from Arthas.\nDiplomacy with the Horde.\nThe vast majority of blood elves are now members of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, this alliance conveying a strong clash of culture. The blood elves are a major part of the eastern Horde, along with their former Ranger-general &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;. As relatively new members, the blood elves have sent several diplomats to various cities and leaders of the Horde (such as &lt;a href=\"Ambassador%20Sunsorrow\"&gt;Ambassador Sunsorrow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ambassador%20Dawnsinger\"&gt;Ambassador Dawnsinger&lt;/a&gt;), and diplomats of each Horde nation are found within &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt;. Though the wider Horde was initially reluctant to forge allegiances with the sin'dorei, the vouching of Sylvanas, and the general consensus that the blood elves could bring to the table what the Horde had previously lacked, would ultimately pave way to &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; being accepted as an equal independent nation of the Horde.\nSeveral blood elves prefer to keep with their own company, viewing their deployment outside of Quel'Thalas as something of a nuisance, though others have been seen to integrate fairly well into the wider Horde, even coming to appreciate its vastly different culture that still permits theirs to exist in its own right. An alliance out of convenience and survival has grown much warmer with time, enough that the blood elves have turned down offers to rejoin the Alliance on multiple occasions. Modern blood elves are largely proud to be a part of the Horde after the struggles the faction supported them through, with Silvermoon now having a lucrative place as a voice at the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Council\"&gt;Horde Council&lt;/a&gt; table. The blood elves were a major driving force in the Horde's &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; campaign, &lt;a href=\"Aethas%20Sunreaver\"&gt;Aethas Sunreaver&lt;/a&gt; ensuring them a vital sanctuary within the former &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; city of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;. A number of the sin'dorei have risen in the Horde's ranks, serving as generals and as spy leaders.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ashra%20Valandril\"&gt;Ashra Valandril&lt;/a&gt; was chosen by the blood elven leadership to represent the blood elves in the new Horde militia, the &lt;a href=\"Garad%27kra\"&gt;Garad'kra&lt;/a&gt;. Some powerful blood elves have also been inducted into the &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron%20Guard\"&gt;Kor'kron Guard&lt;/a&gt;, the most elite fighting force in the Horde's arsenal. The blood elven &lt;a href=\"Reliquary\"&gt;Reliquary&lt;/a&gt; is dedicated to giving the Horde a monopoly on artifacts of great power.\nThe blood elves remaining on Azeroth have developed a relationship with the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; due to &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, who was &lt;a href=\"Ranger-general%20of%20Silvermoon\"&gt;Ranger-general of Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt; until &lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; converted her into undeath against her will. The queen claims that she still considers herself one of the foremost protectors of Quel'Thalas. She has repeatedly offered assistance in the form of supplies and troops. The sin'dorei initially feared a trick, though ultimately relented and allowed Sylvanas to station Forsaken troops in the &lt;a href=\"Ghostlands\"&gt;Ghostlands&lt;/a&gt; to help supplement the overstretched blood elven military fighting to secure it. Following this, Quel'Thalas and Undercity have developed something of a camaraderie, and an orb was constructed to allow quick travel between the two nations. The people of Quel'Thalas itself have seemingly come to view their former Ranger General as something of a hero, who gave her life to protect Silvermoon and continues to assist it in undeath. Ironically, Sylvanas' relationship with the blood elven regent &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; (her former second in command) and his &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Rommath\"&gt;Grand Magister&lt;/a&gt; does not appear to be particularly positive, and Sylvanas had to twist his arm with threats to see him dedicate troops to the &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; war effort. With the war behind them, Lor'themar and Sylvanas became even more distant, the regent lord unsympathetic to her outlook around the other &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; leaders.\nThe relationship between the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear\"&gt;Darkspear&lt;/a&gt; tribe and the sin'dorei is a complicated one. Some blood elves (such as &lt;a href=\"Paelarin\"&gt;Paelarin&lt;/a&gt;) appear openly hostile to the trolls, going as far as to refuse them service despite their shared allegiance. On the other hand, &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Chieftain Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; himself has a fairly amiable and respectful relationship with both &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Halduron%20Brightwing\"&gt;Ranger General Halduron Brightwing&lt;/a&gt;, perhaps born of their more moderate outlooks. As time has gone on, relations with both trolls as well as the other Horde races have improved. In the aftermath of the failed Broken Shore excursion, various blood elves expressed concern for the well-being of Horde soldiers and Vol'jin. Numerous blood elves attended the funeral for the latter and answered the call to arms to avenge him, their Regent Lord additionally serving as one of the slain Warchief's pallbearers.\nThe blood elves have found a kinship with the &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt;, both due to their shared history of magical withdrawal issues and being descended from fellow &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; elves. A blood elf expedition force joining the resistance to liberate &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar City&lt;/a&gt; led to increased comradery between the two groups. Contrary to the very cold and distrustful reception they received from the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;, blood elf representatives led by &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt; endorsed the Horde as a means of preserving cultural autonomy and as a reliable force to help ensure the safety of both of their people's against the outside world; something that could be a great benefit to the nightborne as it had come to be for the blood elves. This contributed greatly to the nightborne choosing to join the Horde as well.\nDiplomacy with the Alliance.\nFollowing the actions of &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Marshal%20Garithos\"&gt;Grand Marshal Garithos&lt;/a&gt;, the blood elves became more opposed to the notion of working with the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; than ever. Despite this, Quel'Thalas did engage in diplomatic relations with an &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; ambassador, though this did not end too well. Certainly, the Alliance has shown no interest in helping the Azerothian blood elves either reach &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; or drive the Scourge out of Quel'Thalas. Already suspicious of the few scattered &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; who still exist, the Alliance considers the blood elves even less trustworthy, notably at the time of the &lt;a href=\"War%20Against%20the%20Nightmare\"&gt;War Against the Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; when King Varian Wrynn noted that he had no reason to believe in the honor of blood elves, as they had turned to absorbing demonic magic after the loss of their vaunted power source, the Sunwell, and had subsequently become addicted to the fel energies. However, relationship with humans, in general, seems to have improved since the acceptance of blood elves in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;. In the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; have defended the blood elves from their Alliance counter-parts and their high elven allies, until their neutrality was abused, which led to the &lt;a href=\"Purge%20of%20Dalaran\"&gt;Purge of Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"Alliance-Horde%20war\"&gt;Alliance-Horde war&lt;/a&gt;, the actions of &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; led &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; to improve relations with the other faction, even entering into negotiations with &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and Stormwind to rejoin the Alliance. However the purge led by Jaina put a definitive end to the negotiations, and the blood elves remained in the ranks of the Horde.\nThe sin'dorei appear to hold little opinion on the &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt;. A number have raised their voices against Ironforge, even going so far as to state how the dwarves have \"never been a friend\" to Quel'Thalas, but this sentiment is sparse. The rivalry between the sin'dorei and the dwarves regarding ancient artifacts has recently emerged, the &lt;a href=\"Reliquary\"&gt;Reliquary&lt;/a&gt; rising to counter the dwarven &lt;a href=\"Explorer%27s%20League\"&gt;Explorer's League&lt;/a&gt;. The elves of Quel'Thalas are one of the few races the dwarves of &lt;a href=\"Aerie%20Peak\"&gt;Aerie Peak&lt;/a&gt; have ever trusted; the elves sent their evacuated children to seek refuge with them during the Scourge invasion.\nA particularly bitter grudge lies between the blood elves and the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;. Indeed, night elves regard blood elves with suspicion, disgust, or outright hostility, while the blood elves, in turn, view their kaldorei cousins as savages. To night elves, the sin'dorei stink of desperation and arcane magic. Shortly after the &lt;a href=\"magisters\"&gt;magisters&lt;/a&gt;' return and the reclamation of &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;, a night elven &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20spies\"&gt;cadre&lt;/a&gt; entered Quel'Thalas to spy on the blood elves' activities, though were forcibly expelled. More recently, the blood elves have expressed an outrage at the return of the &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; into the night elves' ranks, and are eager to see the trouble the new kaldorei magi will no doubt get themselves into. The sin'dorei have also assisted in removing the night elves from &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt;, eager to learn more of their Highborne heritage with the kaldorei out of the picture.\nThe blood elves have a convoluted history with the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;. Kael'thas's blood elven forces were responsible for the bewildered draenei fleeing &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt;, and furthermore responsible for its crash landing into &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. They later attempted to summon reinforcements from &lt;a href=\"Tempest%20Keep\"&gt;Tempest Keep&lt;/a&gt; in order to conquer the Exodar completely and slaughter the remaining draenei. &lt;a href=\"Prophet%20Velen\"&gt;Prophet Velen&lt;/a&gt;, however, had seen a vision of what was to come - including the fate of &lt;a href=\"M%27uru\"&gt;M'uru&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt;'s plight, and &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt;'s future in the wake of Kael'thas' betrayal. Despite the grievances perpetrated by Kael'thas' blood elves against the draenei, Velen himself would be the one to reignite the Sunwell for the sin'dorei with M'uru's final spark. Despite their misgivings, the &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Sun%20Offensive\"&gt;Shattered Sun Offensive&lt;/a&gt; showcased what the coalition of the &lt;a href=\"Aldor\"&gt;Aldor&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Scryers\"&gt;Scryers&lt;/a&gt; can do when of a like mind. The two races fought together once again during the &lt;a href=\"war%20in%20Draenor\"&gt;war in Draenor&lt;/a&gt;.\nLeadership.\nPrior to the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, Quel'Thalas was ruled as a monarchy, with &lt;a href=\"Anasterian%20Sunstrider\"&gt;High King Anasterian Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; as the last high elven monarch. Anasterian's long rule, which lasted at least roughly 2,800 years, was complemented by the &lt;a href=\"Convocation%20of%20Silvermoon\"&gt;Convocation of Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;, a high council of elven lords who had vowed to assist the Sunstriders in keeping Quel'Thalas safe. However, during the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; onslaught, Anasterian was killed and the entire Convocation was eradicated.\nIn the wake of the utter destruction of Quel'Thalas' leadership, &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Prince Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; went on to become the sole leader of the newly named blood elves. Though still essentially a monarch, Kael'thas did not appear to officially take the elven crown, instead styling himself as the \"Lord of the blood elves\" and \"The Sun King.\" Kael'thas decided not to revitalize the Convocation, and instead commanded &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;, the former second in command to &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Ranger General Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, to act as Quel'Thalas' regent during the prince's absence.\nUltimately, with the betrayal and death of Prince Kael'thas, Lor'themar has become the sole leader of the blood elven people. With the &lt;a href=\"Sunstrider%20dynasty\"&gt;Sunstrider dynasty&lt;/a&gt; completely finished, the crown is unclaimed, and even Lor'themar himself has opted not to take it - or restore the Convocation - instead retaining his role as the \"Regent Lord.\" Lor'themar, who is unmarried and without children, finds ruling Quel'Thalas to be a difficult balancing act between practical necessities and higher ideals for his people; and as such, has no intention of starting his own dynasty. Furthermore, he believes that no one remains with a right to the crown of Quel'Thalas, and has respected Kael'thas's decree that Anasterian would be its last king.\nAs such, the blood elves are currently in a state of interregnum, with Regent Lord &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; as their sole leader.\nThe blood elves have a number of other leaders. &lt;a href=\"Halduron%20Brightwing\"&gt;Halduron Brightwing&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Ranger-general%20of%20Silvermoon\"&gt;Ranger-general of Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;, serves as the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Farstriders\"&gt;Farstriders&lt;/a&gt; and the blood elven military commander. &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Rommath\"&gt;Grand Magister Rommath&lt;/a&gt; presides over the &lt;a href=\"magisters\"&gt;magisters&lt;/a&gt;, the most magically-inclined and powerful spellcasters in sin'dorei society, while &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt; rules the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knight\"&gt;Blood Knight order&lt;/a&gt; as its supreme leader and Matriarch. In &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Sunreavers\"&gt;Sunreavers&lt;/a&gt; are led by &lt;a href=\"Aethas%20Sunreaver\"&gt;Archmage Aethas Sunreaver&lt;/a&gt;.\nBlood elf organizations.\nThe sin'dorei have a number of organizations, mostly affiliated directly with &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;.\nFarstriders.\nOne of the most iconic elven organizations are the Farstriders. This elite organization of blood elf rangers can trace its roots back to the &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Wars\"&gt;Troll Wars&lt;/a&gt; when a loosely affiliated band of high elf warriors occasionally worked together to defend Quel'Thalas. Led by the &lt;a href=\"Ranger-general%20of%20Silvermoon\"&gt;Ranger-general of Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Halduron%20Brightwing\"&gt;Halduron Brightwing&lt;/a&gt;, they are perhaps the group most in touch with their &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elven&lt;/a&gt; roots. Masters of the wilderness and many knowing their homeland inside and out, the Farstriders operate mostly in and around &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;. Peerless marksmen and women, they are the masters of surgical strikes and ambushes. Though part of the blood elven government, they are not a formal military. The Farstriders have long been considered valiant and honorable elves who regarded the law with deep respect and faith. Indeed, they have long been considered the epitome of selfless dedication.\nA small organization named the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Hawks\"&gt;Blood Hawks&lt;/a&gt; serves Quel'Thalas from &lt;a href=\"Eversong\"&gt;Eversong&lt;/a&gt;, and its leadership reports directly to Ranger General Halduron.\nBlood Knights.\nAfter the blood elves began to use more dubious methods of sating their addiction, a number of the elves felt the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; abandon them. In turn, this led &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt;, a priestess of the light, to renounce her vows on the grounds that the light had forsaken the sin'dorei race. However, &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Kael%27thas\"&gt;Prince Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt; would later subdue a being of pure light - a &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"M%27uru\"&gt;M'uru&lt;/a&gt; - and had it sent back to Quel'Thalas. Rather than feed upon its energy, the &lt;a href=\"magisters\"&gt;magisters&lt;/a&gt; devised a better use of its power - and after experimentation, they succeeded in allowing the blood elves to forcibly take their holy power from the supposedly unwilling being. Thus, the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knights\"&gt;Blood Knights&lt;/a&gt; were born, under Liadrin's personal leadership. The will of the order would be tested when M'uru was stolen from Silvermoon, and the Blood Knights were left bereft of a power source. However, with the revitalization of the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;, reborn as a fount of holy and arcane power, the Blood Knights of Silvermoon now channel their power directly from it - a far less damaging and more harmonious relationship than their previous method of wielding the light.\nThe Blood Knights quickly gained popular support within Quel'Thalas, and their membership has since expanded. The Blood Knights serve as the iron protectors of Quel'Thalas, faithful servants of Silvermoon, and occasionally as state enforcers.\nMagisters.\nOne of the most prominent groups within Quel'Thalas, and a group whose magical formidability is considered fearsome by even &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;'s standards, are the magisters. Led by &lt;a href=\"Rommath\"&gt;Rommath&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister\"&gt;Grand Magister of Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, the magisters are among the most respected and politically powerful groups in all of Quel'Thalas and serves as Silvermoon's primary order of &lt;a href=\"magi\"&gt;magi&lt;/a&gt;. They are directly responsible for the reclamation of the elven homeland from the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, and it was their mastery over magic that enabled them to rebuild &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt; \"almost overnight.\" The magisters were able to twist even the energies of a &lt;a href=\"M%27uru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; for the blood elves' use, leading to the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knights\"&gt;Blood Knights&lt;/a&gt;. The various arcane structures around the city itself are empowered by their volatile magics, and the thought of what one of the most powerful magi organizations in Azeroth could bring to the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; was a key component in the blood elves being accepted by it.\nSunreavers.\nLed by &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Aethas%20Sunreaver\"&gt;Archmage Aethas Sunreaver&lt;/a&gt;, the Sunreavers are a group of blood elves who desire to see the sin'dorei admitted as members of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;. Traditionally barred from &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; was granted sanctuary in the city due to their efforts. Due to recent betrayals of the Kirin Tor from within the group, &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; ordered them &lt;a href=\"Purge%20of%20Dalaran\"&gt;purged&lt;/a&gt; from Dalaran. This event led to the incarceration of Sunreaver civilians and those who were willing to surrender, and the demise of those who were not.\nBacked by &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt; and championed by &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;regent lord Lor'themar&lt;/a&gt; himself, the Sunreavers who escaped the purge took up arms against &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen\"&gt;Lei Shen&lt;/a&gt; and the Kirin Tor on the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Isle of Thunder&lt;/a&gt;, with the goal of acquiring &lt;a href=\"Blood%20golem\"&gt;powerful leverage&lt;/a&gt; to secure the blood elves' future should &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; fall to anarchy.\nReliquary.\nThe Reliquary is an organization led by &lt;a href=\"High%20Examiner%20Tae%27thelan%20Bloodwatcher\"&gt;High Examiner Tae'thelan Bloodwatcher&lt;/a&gt; and operates as a &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; counter to the &lt;a href=\"Explorer%27s%20League\"&gt;Explorer's League&lt;/a&gt;. They seek to acquire artifacts of great power to free completely the elven race of their magical addiction. They conducted operations during the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alliance-Horde%20war\"&gt;Alliance-Horde war&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"war%20in%20Draenor\"&gt;war in Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;, and notably they joined forces with the Explorers' League for the &lt;a href=\"Dragonscale%20Expedition\"&gt;Dragonscale Expedition&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;.\nSunfury.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sunfury\"&gt;Sunfury&lt;/a&gt; were among the most powerful blood elves that &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Kael%27thas\"&gt;Prince Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt; led into &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. They numbered in the thousands. They were situated mainly in the magic-rich area of &lt;a href=\"Netherstorm\"&gt;Netherstorm&lt;/a&gt;, while other blood elves dispersed between the armies of the &lt;a href=\"Scryers\"&gt;Scryers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;. Led by numerous generals such as &lt;a href=\"Daellis%20Dawnstrike\"&gt;Daellis Dawnstrike&lt;/a&gt;, a group attacked and slaughtered the local &lt;a href=\"Kirin%27Var%20Village\"&gt;Kirin'Var Village&lt;/a&gt; and its residents, and other members of the Sunfury saw to the dismantling of the &lt;a href=\"manaforge\"&gt;manaforge&lt;/a&gt;s in the area for their master's gain. They were one of the more ruthless sects of blood elves found in Outland.\nFollowing the betrayal of Kael'thas, however, a number of the Sunfury returned home to serve their people rather than follow Kael's increasingly damning path, thus affiliating themselves with Quel'Thalas and the Horde. Though now an official part of Silvermoon's military, the Sunfury have made only a minor appearance in \"World of Warcraft\" in such an incarnation.\nScryers.\nThe Scryers were once high-ranking blood elves in Prince Kael'thas's army, their ranks including some of the most gifted scholars and magisters that Kael had led into &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. They are led by &lt;a href=\"Voren%27thal%20the%20Seer\"&gt;Voren'thal the Seer&lt;/a&gt;, a magus of considerable prowess and age. Voren'thal grew increasingly troubled by the dark path his prince was treading and was granted visions of the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"A%27dal\"&gt;A'dal&lt;/a&gt;. Believing that the Sin'dorei's only chance for survival rested with the naaru, Voren'thal, and his followers chose to abandon Kael's cause.\nThe Scryers sought to save their people from Kael's downfall and uncovered concrete evidence that the prince had begun consorting with the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Though sponsored by the city's naaru hosts, the Scryers' &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; counterparts, the &lt;a href=\"Aldor\"&gt;Aldor&lt;/a&gt;, did not take kindly to the Scryers' presence in the city; a factional divide quickly broke out between the two. Following Kael's defeat in &lt;a href=\"Tempest%20Keep\"&gt;Tempest Keep&lt;/a&gt;, Scryer forces returned home to &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; under the banner of the &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Sun%20Offensive\"&gt;Shattered Sun Offensive&lt;/a&gt; (a coalition of Aldor and Scryers banding together) to end Kael's ambitions for good.\nWhat became of the Scryers following the demise of Kael'thas, the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;, and the restoration of the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt; is unclear, although they still answer to the naaru first and foremost.\nOthers.\nNotable blood elf organizations affiliated elsewhere (with &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas\"&gt;Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Illidan\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;) include the &lt;a href=\"Eclipsion\"&gt;Eclipsion&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Sunseekers\"&gt;Sunseekers&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Shadowsword\"&gt;Shadowsword&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Sunhawk\"&gt;Sunhawk&lt;/a&gt;s, the &lt;a href=\"Sunblade\"&gt;Sunblade&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Dawnblade%20%28blood%20elves%29\"&gt;Dawnblade&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Hand\"&gt;Crimson Hand&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Firewing\"&gt;Firewing&lt;/a&gt;.\nAncestry and offshoots.\nThe blood elves of today descended from the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;. Though the sin'dorei style themselves as having been \"reborn\" from the ashes of the shattered &lt;a href=\"quel%27dorei\"&gt;quel'dorei&lt;/a&gt;, in biological essence the two groups belong to the same race. Blood elves are the hosts of several other newly-emerged races, each stemming from sin'dorei roots as the sin'dorei did from the kaldorei - though not by conventional means:\nIn the RPG.\nBlood elves between the Third War and \"World of Warcraft\" were physically identical to &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt;, save that they dressed primarily in blacks and reds to remind themselves of their terrible losses. Many painted runes or mysterious tattoos on their faces, arms, and shoulders for warding off demons or celebrating significant kills or simply to look intimidating \u2014 something high elves would never do. As well, they adopted hairstyles that went against the norms of high elf society. Nevertheless when approaching Alliance towns blood elves would often disguise themselves as high elves to avoid harm.\nSeparated more by cultural differences than physiological ones, it has since been determined that they are, in fact, beginning to evolve into a separate race, due largely to their consumption of mana from primarily fel sources. This reliance on fel magic causes the eyes of blood elves to glow green with demonic fire. This readily available source of energy also tends to give blood elves a ruddier or paler look compared to their quel'dorei cousins. A blood elf can appear like a high elf bearing odd red tattoos across his or her face and arms. However, his or her hair and skin is much paler than that of a high elf, their eyes glint with a green light, and they wear blood-red robes.\nThese represent signs of evolution from their high elven cousins, and it is believed that, with time, they may become as physically distant to high elves as satyrs are to night elves.\nBlood elves have no permanent settlements on Azeroth; the only blood elf communities are located in Outland, the extradimensional wasteland of Illidan's exile. Despite this, a number of them can be found at &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt; under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Aquel%27Luer%27Thala\"&gt;Aquel'Luer'Thala&lt;/a&gt;.\nLanguages.\nBlood elves speak &lt;a href=\"Thalassian\"&gt;Thalassian&lt;/a&gt;, the age-old language of their ancient race, and have learned the languages of their allies and enemies.\nNames.\nAs seen with most blood elves who survived the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the sin'dorei have (for the most part) retained their quel'dorei names. As such, the same naming rules are typical of their high elven cousins. The high and blood elves share a connection with the sun that is quite prevalent in their choice of family names.\nClasses.\nMany blood elves are warlocks or mages, though some become hunters, scouts, or warriors \u2014 especially those seeking to be &lt;a href=\"spellbreaker\"&gt;spellbreaker&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"demon%20hunter\"&gt;demon hunter&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Elven%20ranger\"&gt;rangers&lt;/a&gt;. A few continue to draw power from the Light and remain priests. Some blood elves take their demonic obsession one step further and become felsworn, while others choose to draw on the magic of the Legion and become &lt;a href=\"blood%20mage\"&gt;blood mage&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAlignment.\nMost blood elves are not insane or evil\u2014they just choose to fight fire with fire. They are suffering due to the loss of their precious Sunwell; they all needed\u2014and still need\u2014to feed on arcane energies, even though most of them aren't spellcasters. The most powerful blood elf spellcasters are insane, as the magic they wield is corrupting. &lt;a href=\"Farstriders\"&gt;Farstriders&lt;/a&gt; is one of the few groups that still have any of these virtues. Blood elves as a whole are classified as the \"neutral\" alignment.\nOther relationships.\nWhile they hate most races, they have come to accept the Forsaken, as they share the same goals. The western Horde recognizes the blood elves as dangerous, volatile and ultimately destructive. The Horde orcs, Darkspear trolls and tauren distrust the blood elves, as their addiction to magic makes the high elves look like amateurs. In particular, the orcs revile the blood elves because they see them as descending down the same path toward damnation that so corrupted the orcish people \u2014 the orcs can smell the demon taint on the blood elves and know how badly it will twist them. The blood elves consider the Horde to be barbarians who refuse to grasp power in front of them. They especially dislike the orcs, who should have been strong enough to control the power the demons gave them instead of falling under their command. Blood elves reek of fel power, offending the spiritual senses of night elves and tauren.\nBlood elves feel betrayed by the Alliance and are enemies of both humanity and the night elves. The blood elves try to draw the remaining high elves into their fold \u2014 a concept the goodly high elves view with horror and revulsion. Indeed, the existence of the blood elves demonstrates the depth of the corruption possible for this once mighty race, and the high elves see them as a dire warning. Many high elves seek to make amends for evils wrought by their demented kin. Blood elves get along well with the naga \u2014 with whom they share Highborne ancestry \u2014 and other independent factions. They are not welcome in Alliance lands. The Alliance represents all that the blood elves hate in the world. The humans led the Exodus from Lordaeron, abandoning the blood elves to the Scourge, taking many high elves with them. The high elves are weak; they have the potential to reach blood elf status, but they will not embrace the power and therefore are of little use. The night elves are remembered as the elves who banished them from their homes so very long ago, and those grudges still run deep. The other races are disliked merely for their representation in the Alliance \u2014 the friend of my enemy is my enemy, so to speak. The Alliance views them as dangerous (and mad, in some cases). The arcane spellcasters in the Alliance agree that the blood elves have gone too far in their quest for power \u2014 even the high elves are sickened and frightened by their former brethren's loss of compassion and self-control. The blood elves have little use for the Alliance, and the downfall of this faction is next on their list after they have purged the Scourge from Lordaeron.\nThe blood elves consider the naga their allies and friends. The other neutral races that interest them are the goblins and some of &lt;a href=\"dark%20troll\"&gt;dark troll&lt;/a&gt;s. The goblins are the only merchants who will sell to the blood elves without prejudice; if an Alliance or Horde merchant would even allow a blood elf to look at her goods, she would most certainly raise the prices astronomically. The troll tribes often have items or information of use to the blood elves, and they hate the night elves with almost the same passion. The blood elves have few opinions on the other independent races \u2014 those that worship a divine power are weaklings, and those that remain neutral are of little consequence.\nMany blood elves have insinuated their way back into the world and seek out places rich in magical power \u2014 such as Ashenvale Forest. Some blood elves, steeped so thick in pain and anger, have joined the Shadow Council in Felwood.\nIn the TCG.\nBlood elven priests are more of a quandary, however, as comparatively little is known about their own outlooks on the Light. Some viewed the Blood Knights' opinion on the Light's abandonment as \"folly,\" and continued to embrace it as priests and priestesses as the Light regardless of the new direction their society was heading in.\nBlood elves have green eyes, but a blood elf warlock in the TCG has purple eyes. &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;Mage&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s and others have been seen with golden eyes.\nFurthermore, a blood elf &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; is seen with glowing red eyes while casting an invisibility spell. Whether the eye color has any correlation with &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt;, or the specific spell being used, is unknown.\nInspirations.\nBlood elves appear inspired by a blend of other fictional settings such as \"\" and of real-life cultural elements such as , , motifs invoking the , Germanic mythology, and French historical elements."}

Once known as &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt;, and even having been allied with the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, they renamed themselves after their kingdom was nearly destroyed by the vast undead armies of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. In the aftermath, Regent Lord &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; found aid in the unlikeliest place - their former Ranger General, &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;. After struggling with magical addictions after the destruction of their &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;power source&lt;/a&gt;, abandonment from their former allies in the Alliance, and the betrayal of their &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;prince&lt;/a&gt;, the blood elves endured and found a place for themselves within the Horde.\nThey start in &lt;a href=\"Eversong%20Woods\"&gt;Eversong Woods&lt;/a&gt; in the northern region of their homeland, adjacent to the &lt;a href=\"Ghostlands\"&gt;Ghostlands&lt;/a&gt;, a level 10-20 zone that is also a part of the kingdom. &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt; is the rebuilt capital of the blood elves. &lt;a href=\"Hawkstrider\"&gt;Hawkstrider&lt;/a&gt;s are their racial mount, and &lt;a href=\"Thalassian\"&gt;Thalassian&lt;/a&gt; is the language they speak, although they are also able to communicate with their allies by speaking &lt;a href=\"Orcish%20%28language%29\"&gt;orcish&lt;/a&gt;.\nCustomizations for this race include the ability to depict a &lt;a href=\"dark%20ranger\"&gt;dark ranger&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"darkfallen\"&gt;darkfallen&lt;/a&gt; elf rather than a standard sin'dorei. They also possess customizations that look akin to the traditional depiction of &lt;a href=\"high%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nLong ago the exiled high elves landed on the shores of Lordaeron. They struck out to find a new home, and after many battles with the trolls, established the kingdom of Quel'Thalas. Using a vial of sacred water stolen from the first Well of Eternity, the high elves created a fount of mystical power at a convergence of ley energies in Quel'Thalas. They named this fountain the Sunwell. Its potent arcane magic fed and strengthened the high elves, and soon the wondrous city of Silvermoon was established.\nProtected by a magical barrier, the high elves enjoyed peace for roughly four thousand years, but that peace was not meant to last. The Amani trolls gathered an immense army and assaulted the elven kingdom. Vastly outnumbered, the high elves hastily struck an alliance with the human nation of Arathor. The elves taught a small number of humans how to wield magic. In exchange, the humans aided the elves in destroying the trolls' power base forever. Over the following years, the high elves returned to their reclusive ways, but during the Third War, the diabolical Prince Arthas Menethil brought battle once again to their doorstep. Arthas required the power of the Sunwell to revive the necromancer Kel'Thuzad and raise him as a lich. He invaded Quel'Thalas and wiped out most of its population. In the end, even King Anasterian Sunstrider lay dead.\nAdditionally, it became clear that the high elves had become addicted to the Sunwell's arcane energies. Now that the source of their magic was gone, the few remaining high elves quickly grew ill and apathetic. Prince Kael'thas, the last of the royal line, returned from his studies in Dalaran to find Quel'Thalas in ruins. Thirsting for vengeance, he gathered the survivors, renamed them blood elves, and took a group of the strongest fighters to join Lordaeron's campaign against the Scourge.\nDue to human prejudice, Kael'thas was forced to accept the assistance of Lady Vashj and her reptilian naga. When the humans discovered that the blood elves had been working with the naga, Kael'thas and the others were imprisoned and condemned to death. Lady Vashj soon arrived to set them free, leading them through a portal and into the broken wastes of Outland. There, the elves met the one being capable of putting an end to their hunger: the renegade night elf/demon, Illidan Stormrage. Certain that the blood elves would die without Illidan's assistance, Kael'thas agreed to serve the Betrayer.\nA lone representative, Rommath, was sent back to Azeroth with a message of hope for the blood elves remaining in Quel'Thalas: that one day Kael'thas would return to lead his people to paradise. Rommath had made great progress in teaching the blood elves advanced techniques to manipulate arcane energies. With renewed purpose, the blood elves have rebuilt the city of Silvermoon, though it is powered by volatile magics. Emboldened by the promise of Kael'thas' return, the weary citizens of Quel'Thalas now focus on regaining their strength, even as they forge a new path into an uncertain future.\nKael'thas would eventually return to Quel'Thalas, having forsaken his people for the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Taking the Naaru &lt;a href=\"M%27uru\"&gt;M'uru&lt;/a&gt; with him to the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Isle of Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt;, he sought to bring the demon &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; into Azeroth. He was foiled by the forces of the &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Sun%20Offensive\"&gt;Shattered Sun Offensive&lt;/a&gt; and the Sunwell was restored by the prophet &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt;, using the spark of the dying M'uru to rekindle it as a source of Light.\nReinvigorated, the blood elves fight to protect Quel'Thalas, conquer their magical addiction with the Sunwell's sustainment, and help redeem the soul of their ancient people.\nCharacter.\nBlood elf players begin in the northernmost section of the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;. \nStarting blood elf characters can use a &lt;a href=\"Orb%20of%20Translocation\"&gt;Orb of Translocation&lt;/a&gt; to get to the entrance of &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;. The orb works both ways, so characters can easily travel between the two capitals without having to go through the &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands\"&gt;Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;, which are much higher level zones than the undead and blood elf starting areas. Blood elf players also begin with a \"Friendly\" status with Undercity while being Neutral with other factions of the Horde. This is due to the nature of their starting circumstances: as far as lore goes, Quel'Thalas was an &lt;a href=\"neutral\"&gt;independent&lt;/a&gt; nation until its acceptance into the Horde in the culmination of the blood elf starting quests. Sylvanas, former &lt;a href=\"Ranger-general%20of%20Silvermoon\"&gt;Ranger-general of Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;, had already taken steps to establish friendly relations between her past and present people before questing begins. \nAppearance.\nBlood elves are 5\u20136 feet tall, slim and wiry. Their hair and skin color reflect their affinity to fire and the sun. All blood elves have prominent eyebrows and long ears. Males have minimal facial hair. Females tend to wear elaborate ear jewelry.\nMales of the race are tall and slender, standing above the average human, and characterized by a lean, athletic musculature, making them seem somewhat thin when compared to larger races such as orcs. Females stand somewhat shorter, just above a human male in height, and have slender, delicate builds. They have a wide range of hair colors spanning from charcoal black to nearly white and a spectrum of skin colors ranging from pale to tan to ruddy. Blood elves have very long and thin ears, however their ears differ greatly from a night elf's. The ears of a blood elf point vertically, whereas a night elf's ears point behind them. Blood elves also have eyebrows that extend well off of their faces like whiskers, similar to that of a night elf. Both males and females are what would typically be considered exceptionally beautiful, with chiseled, refined features; males can also sport some facial hair, in the form of goatees. Their eyes glow green due to the influence of the fel energies they turned to with the destruction of the Sunwell, obscuring their natural eye color.\nLanguages.\nBlood elf players speak the ancient language of their people, &lt;a href=\"Thalassian\"&gt;Thalassian&lt;/a&gt;. They also speak the standard &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;ish, though this is restricted by gameplay; lore-wise, blood elves would be fluent in most racial languages, including most of the Alliance's.\nMounts.\nThe hawkstrider is the blood elves' primary racial mount. It was formerly called a cockatrice but was later changed, though that mythical beast remains the inspiration for the hawkstrider. As their name implies, hawkstriders resemble other members of the tallstrider family, though their plumage is both larger and more vibrant. They come in a variety of bright colors and have a thin, curved beak and burning orange eyes. Epic versions include decorative armor on the chest and head. The hawkstrider's movements exhibit the same rhythmic, back-and-forth motion which characterizes the other two-legged mounts. They use a heavily modified tallstrider model, but they possess a wildly different-looking exterior and a unique standing-jump and running animation.\nThe blood elves also keep a large number of native &lt;a href=\"dragonhawk\"&gt;dragonhawk&lt;/a&gt;s, used by their &lt;a href=\"flight%20master\"&gt;flight master&lt;/a&gt;s to ferry passengers through the land. Players can also acquire a variety of dragonhawks.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knight\"&gt;Blood Knight&lt;/a&gt;s receive a pair of unique mounts, the &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Thalassian%20Warhorse\"&gt;Thalassian Warhorse&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Thalassian%20Charger\"&gt;Thalassian Charger&lt;/a&gt;. These horses use a dark color scheme inclining to red and black (the colors of the Blood Knight order) in contrast to human and dwarf paladins, who receive a blue armored version. Blood elf paladins receive both of these mounts as they gain experience.\nQuotes.\nBlood elf player characters have the following voice-acted responses to their emotes:\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

{"id": "68814", "revid": "46586549", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=68814", "title": "Blood elf controversy", "text": "Please note: The following article was largely written prior to the introduction of the blood elves as a playable race for \"World of Warcraft\" and contains some non-canon RPG details. It is kept for historical purposes, documenting the reaction of some of the player-base to the race's introduction as part of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;The Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThe blood elf controversy involves players who have voiced objection to &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; feeling it will ruin the atmosphere of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Others think it makes little sense that the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;New Horde&lt;/a&gt; would let in such a corrupt race and feel this upsets the balance between the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. The latest controversy involves their torture and exploitation of a &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; and the hidden &lt;a href=\"leper%20gnome\"&gt;leper gnome&lt;/a&gt; sweatshop in their capital showing &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne&lt;/a&gt;'s apparent indifference.\nA defensive argument for the inclusion of blood elves.\nWhile the feeling of the general public is that the blood elves are evil, most of these opinions are drawn from what they have previously observed from their experiences in playing as the human-blood elf &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20the%20Blood%20Elves\"&gt;campaign&lt;/a&gt; in \"\", who accepted &lt;a href=\"Vashj\"&gt;Vashj&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt;'s ideas of obtaining magic at almost any cost, even consorting with &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;upper-level demons&lt;/a&gt;.\nHowever, it is important to remember that the playable blood elves in \"The Burning Crusade\" will not be the same as the playable blood elves in previous \"Warcraft\" titles. These blood elves draw their energies from demonic pests and mana beasts, the equivalent of rats or lesser rodents. Many are unaware of what happened to Prince &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt; and his accompanying strike force (the blood elves of \"The Frozen Throne\") through the Dark Portal in search of a cure - this will probably be a major factor into why both Alliance and Horde will be able to battle him in the &lt;a href=\"Tempest%20Keep\"&gt;Tempest Keep&lt;/a&gt;. The playable blood elves of \"The Burning Crusade\" were the great majority of the blood elf military, who Kael'thas sent to reclaim &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;sin'dorei&lt;/a&gt; bring with them a rightly feared and legendary arcane heritage, and the newly formed &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knights\"&gt;Blood Knights&lt;/a&gt;. With the reclamation of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt;, they also bring yet another Horde presence to a continent that is generally thought of as Alliance territory. Now there are two major powers on the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; that can act as buffers, supply centers and headquarters against Ironforge and &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; in case the Alliance initiates another Great War. (This balances with the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;, whose territories are off the coast of Kalimdor, a Horde-dominated continent).\nFrom a strictly practical gameplay perspective, a sin'dorei paladin makes a tremendously versatile addition to any party. In PvP, the paladin can be very powerful in comparison to other classes, and in PvE their ability to both heal and engage in melee combat means that they can serve equally well as either a main healer or main tank.\nThe ulterior reasons are sympathy. Although all the races of the Horde wisely note the blood elves' reputation as being reckless and dangerous, there are those within the Horde who view them as a race also in need of help. Orcs, no strangers to the debilitating effects of &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; power, are surprisingly accepting of the Sin'dorei, and many older orcs who have experienced demonic corruption firsthand are fierce supporters of the blood elves. Blood elves hate unlife in all its forms, but in regards to the Forsaken, blood elves are generally willing to accept an uneasy truce. While the alliance between blood elves and the forsaken is uneasy at best, it is strong enough that the Undercity and Silvermoon have opened a translocator between the two cities, making safe travel possible without low-ranked blood elves having to traverse the hazardous &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands\"&gt;Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;. This allows the once land-locked blood elf homeland unfettered access to the rest of Azeroth.\nThe \"Common\" controversy.\nA popular lore argument is \"How can the blood elves suddenly forget &lt;a href=\"Common%20%28language%29\"&gt;Common&lt;/a&gt; upon joining the Horde?\"\nTraditionally, Common is usually treated as a universal language in earlier \"Warcraft\" games, novels, and in &lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft%20RPG\"&gt;the current RPG&lt;/a&gt;, and is known by most races and factions in some form (Common, &lt;a href=\"Nerglish\"&gt;Nerglish&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Undercommon\"&gt;Undercommon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Low%20Common\"&gt;Low Common&lt;/a&gt;, and etc). Even individuals and races that had never previously encountered members of other races are capable of having conversations due to a universal knowledge of Common. According to the RPG blood elves know Common, and it is one of their two main languages, which also includes &lt;a href=\"Thalassian\"&gt;Thalassian&lt;/a&gt;.\nHowever, some see the above argument in itself as flawed, because they have seen no evidence in need of retconning to show that most elves even know Common to begin with. They believe although there are undoubtedly blood elves who do speak Common (as well as Orcs who spoke Common, Humans who spoke &lt;a href=\"Orcish%20%28language%29\"&gt;Orcish&lt;/a&gt;, and etc), they may not be the majority. They believe that the blood elves who know the language are usually commissioned officers, delegates, diplomats, veterans from the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, or defectors from the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;. Quel'Thalas has always been an insular nation, and officially severed all ties with the Alliance immediately following the Second War. It is possible as a result, that there are very few ordinary blood elves who speak Common. Elves who are the most likely to know Common are usually loyalist high elves who stayed with the Alliance even after Quel'Thalas seceded, and many veterans of the previous wars have already died. Much of the current blood elf population are those who remained in Quel'Thalas throughout the WarCraft storyline.\nThere are many who have not seen any race aside from their own prior to the Horde induction, so it could be much less likely for them to speak Common. As with most of the other playable races, new blood elf characters are probably young enough to have never seen battle when they first start out. Also, after severing ties with the alliance, it is likely that the use of common has been outlawed among blood elves and are encouraged to speak Thalassian in order to preserve cultural identity.\nHowever, the basic reasons remain decisions largely for the sake of competitive gameplay. Blizzard goes to great lengths to promote tension between factions, and discourages fraternizing and communicating with the opposing faction. Having a language barrier promotes this, especially when applied to &lt;a href=\"PvP%20server\"&gt;PvP server&lt;/a&gt;s. This language barrier may not actually be present in non-game materials (novels, etc).\nThe language barrier also extends from Blizzard's experience by letting &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; speak Common \u2014 players displayed a noted (almost repulsive) lack of maturity with this ability, and &lt;a href=\"Gutterspeak\"&gt;Gutterspeak&lt;/a&gt; was the result.\nWhy hunters and not warriors? Suggested gameplay and lore reasoning.\nAs cited in the Classes section, the gameplay reasoning behind the decision is that Blizzard wanted both new expansion races to be able to roll a locked number of six classes. With the elimination of faction exclusive classes, the choice came down between hunter and warrior, and hunter was chosen as the sixth class. From a Lore standpoint, the inclusion of hunters and the exclusion of warriors can be explained through several reasons. Note: this does not mean that &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Elf%20Swordsman\"&gt;blood elven warriors&lt;/a&gt; may not exist in the Warcraft universe, only that they are not a playable class.\nBlood elves as a race are the physically weakest of all the races of the Horde. Orcs, trolls, Forsaken, and tauren are superior to them in size, weight, strength, and constitution, each in different but always superior degrees for the respective races. All blood elves, regardless of station or occupation, boast a great affinity for the arcane arts \u2014 an area of contention the Horde was notably inferior to prior to the inclusion of the blood elves.\nAlthough there are a significant amount of rank-and-file blood elven soldiers, these spellbreakers typically serve as city guards and honor guards and still have a substantial amount of magical ability which sets them far apart from the warriors of other races. Since the opening of the Dark Portal, the role of the Blood Knights has been changed from honor guards to frontline troops to help assist the Horde war effort. The remaining surviving rangers from the three Great Wars have been training more recruits, under the guidance of Ranger-General Halduron Brightwing, and will make a reappearance alongside their fellow adventurers by the time of the expansion. \n\"With the introduction of the \"\" expansion, the warrior class was made available to the blood elves.\"\nBulk up.\nThere has been an ongoing complaint over the new changes done to blood elf models, and specifically the choice to bulk up male blood elves. The current models stand slightly straighter and have bigger biceps than the old models. The official &lt;a href=\"CM\"&gt;CM&lt;/a&gt; response by &lt;a href=\"Nethaera\"&gt;Nethaera&lt;/a&gt; stated that the change was made in order to make male blood elves look more menacing and masculine to the opposite faction, and the answer was met with heavy criticism. Many fans decried this as unwarranted machismo and stereotyping, as these players wanted a slender male model available to the Horde faction. There have been ongoing petitions and forum threads since the change asking for a revert to the old model, and calling for a change in the male blood elf's stance and voice responses to remedy their perceived lack of masculinity instead of a physical change.\nIt has pointed out that prior to this model change there have been reports of skeletal tearing (the model's skeletal frame poking out of the skin) during movement. The increased number of polygons, biceps size, and general size of male blood elves appear to have repaired the problem.\nDefenders have also pointed out that there have been promotional pictures showing very bulky and muscular blood elves. These were done by &lt;a href=\"Samwise%20Didier\"&gt;Samwise Didier&lt;/a&gt; who typically draws all males in an exaggerated fashion, even the traditionally slender trolls.\nEven with this \"bulk-up\", blood elves still remain the second most slender horde race (the first being Forsaken, due to decay) in the game.\nPaladins.\nThe most controversial facet of the blood elves is their ability to become &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s. It should be noted, however, that of all the controversy, this one is the most credible lore-wise. The ability balances the right of the draenei to become shamans, an action Blizzard took as part of a way to clarify the role of the shaman in lore. As high elves many were members of the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20Light\"&gt;Church of Light&lt;/a&gt;; many became priests and a few became paladins.. After the Third War, the majority of high elves became blood elves, and soon the race began to lose its Light-given powers. Thus they needed to find a new way to access the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;. They did this by sapping Light energy from the captive &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"M%27uru\"&gt;M'uru&lt;/a&gt; held beneath the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knight\"&gt;Blood Knight&lt;/a&gt; headquarters.\n\"In terms of gameplay, the decision to eliminate faction-specific classes was explained by Blizzard as an attempt to refine and distinguish the two classes from one another. They had previously suffered from comparisons of their abilities, and the attempt to \"balance\" them and yet have them remain distinct led to the two classes becoming more and more similar to one another. The introduction of these classes to both sides would reduce the controversial issue of faction balance. Nevertheless, this decision was met with some criticism by players and even Blizzard employees have expressed that the decision was not an easy one.\"\nRetrospective.\nIn the years following the writing of this article, and the introduction of blood elves to \"World of Warcraft\", the race has generally gained acceptance among players. In fact, the race has become the most popular for Horde player characters by a substantial margin, on servers of all kinds in both US and EU regions. As with the dominant popularity of the human race for Alliance players, this is likely due to the race's relatively 'normal' or human appearance, compared to alternatives such as the orcs, tauren and Forsaken. Blood elves became additionally popular due to their long being the only Horde race able to play as paladins, a factor which in itself has lead to some attacks due to players' frustration at being forced to choose that race in order to play as paladins. While they are still in some cases targets of ridicule - due largely to issues regarding their appearance and popularity - the controversy over the blood elves' introduction has generally been long forgotten, and with substantial story roles throughout \"The Burning Crusade\", in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Sunreavers\"&gt;Sunreavers&lt;/a&gt; faction, and in \"Mists of Pandaria\"'s &lt;a href=\"Domination%20Point\"&gt;Domination Point&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Isle of Thunder&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Purge%20of%20Dalaran\"&gt;Purge of Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; storylines, the race has become a recognized and relied upon part of the Horde."}

He commanded the blood elves after the death of his father &lt;a href=\"Anasterian%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Anasterian&lt;/a&gt;, leading them out of the Alliance and into &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt;'s service.\nBlood magi are present in &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; being commanded by &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Rommath\"&gt;Grand Magister Rommath&lt;/a&gt;.\nOrigin.\nMany of the stoic &lt;a href=\"high%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt;, reeling from the loss of their ancient homeland, &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, have given in to their hatred and despair and embraced the dark side of their magical natures. Calling themselves \"blood elves\", these cold hearted refugees seek to expand their remaining magical powers at any cost \u2014 even if it means courting the infernal powers of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Though still loyal to the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, the blood elves' passions will lead them not only to the highest pinnacles of power, but to the darkest depths of madness.\nAbilities.\nBlood mages have many abilities based on the usage of fire and mana.\nThey can use numerous other spells such as &lt;a href=\"Fireball\"&gt;Fireball&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Pyroblast\"&gt;Pyroblast&lt;/a&gt;.\nVerdant Sphere.\n&lt;a href=\"Verdant%20Sphere\"&gt;Verdant Sphere&lt;/a&gt;s seem to be orbs of magical fire that revolve around the head of some blood mages. Rumor has it that they siphon the life essence of the demons slain by the blood mage, further empowering especially their fire spells. In Warcraft III, the playable blood mage hero flung a Verdant Sphere whenever he cast a spell or attacked an enemy. \nIn the novella \"&lt;a href=\"Blood%20of%20the%20Highborne\"&gt;Blood of the Highborne&lt;/a&gt;\", it was revealed that Prince Kael'thas Sunstrider's &lt;a href=\"Verdant%20Sphere\"&gt;Verdant Sphere&lt;/a&gt;s were originally the three guardian &lt;a href=\"Mooncrystal\"&gt;Mooncrystal&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; which were corrupted within the Scourge-ridden waters of the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;. This may prove to counter the idea that every blood mage owns one or several Verdant Spheres due to both the rarity of the initial Mooncrystals and the sheer amount of power that the corrupted Sunwell held to change them. It may also mean that Verdant Spheres owned by others such as &lt;a href=\"Varanis%20Bitterstar\"&gt;Varanis Bitterstar&lt;/a&gt; are simply not as empowered as the ones owned by Kael'thas himself.\nOther blood magi.\nEldin Sunstrider, Tanin Hawkwing, Lorn Bloodseeker, Aldos Firestar, Gilaras Drakeson, Hale Magefire, Kath'ranis Remar, Tyoril Sunchaser, Sylvos Windrunner, Marakanis Starfury, Geldor Earthfire, Halendor Burnkin, Kelen the Destroyer."}

Someone who practices blood magic is often called a blood mage (or bloodmage), or blood wizard.\nDespite their name, &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elven&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"blood%20mage\"&gt;blood mage&lt;/a&gt;s are not actually users of blood magic, as they use the fire and heat of what some fear to be demonic magic.\nAs a magic school.\nAs the name suggests, bloodmages use blood to perform their rituals. All blood is different, and the correct combinations are required to perform certain tasks. Contrary to popular belief, ancient and powerful bloodmages do not actually drink blood, but eat normal food like everybody else.\nOn &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, it is shunned by many as a dark and forgotten art. In that and many other ways, it shares some distinct characteristics with &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;demonic magic&lt;/a&gt;. Blood magic can be used to teleport via &lt;a href=\"Bloodstone%20Teleporter\"&gt;bloodstone teleporters&lt;/a&gt;, scry for information, and resurrect the dead. In addition to true resurrection, it can also be used to create &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; as seen with the followers of &lt;a href=\"G%27huun\"&gt;G'huun&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Nazmir\"&gt;Nazmir&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; strive to master the life force of their enemies, as blood feeds their attacks and weakens their foes. They strip energy from their enemies, both fighting and fallen, which allows them to persevere where others fall exhausted.\nInterestingly, several users of blood magic like the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Wizard\"&gt;Blood Wizard&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Bonechewer%20Blood%20Prophet\"&gt;Bonechewer Blood Prophet&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Blood%20Wizard\"&gt;Defias Blood Wizard&lt;/a&gt;s are able to cast &lt;a href=\"Bloodlust\"&gt;Bloodlust&lt;/a&gt; or a Bloodlust-like spell.\nPractitioners.\nOn &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Bleeding%20Hollow%20clan\"&gt;Bleeding Hollow clan&lt;/a&gt; was fond of using blood in their spells, including a ritual to create &lt;a href=\"dire%20orc\"&gt;dire orc&lt;/a&gt;s and another to summon the powerful &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Moon\"&gt;Blood Moon&lt;/a&gt;. They cut their own flesh, and &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Hunter%20Denjai\"&gt;Shadow Hunter Denjai&lt;/a&gt; described their magic as being like voodoo but hurting even more.\nTo survive the harsh desert lands of &lt;a href=\"Tanaris\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Sandfury%20tribe\"&gt;Sandfury&lt;/a&gt; trolls learned the secrets of blood magic - drinking blood allowed them to access the darkest &lt;a href=\"voodoo\"&gt;voodoo&lt;/a&gt; powers. Several &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; tribes including the &lt;a href=\"Sandfury%20tribe\"&gt;Sandfury&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vilebranch%20tribe\"&gt;Vilebranch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20tribe\"&gt;Gurubashi&lt;/a&gt; could deploy a class of warriors called the \"Blood Drinkers\", which wore heavy armor, used two-handed weapons and could leech blood from their enemies. &lt;a href=\"Overlord%20Drakuru\"&gt;Drakuru&lt;/a&gt; also had his own Blood Drinkers, which he used in &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Drak\"&gt;Zul'Drak&lt;/a&gt; in the name of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20the%20Soulflayer\"&gt;Hakkar the Soulflayer&lt;/a&gt;, the Loa of Blood, grows stronger with blood he consumes, and was the one who taught the Gurubashi trolls blood magic over a thousand years ago. &lt;a href=\"Blood%20troll\"&gt;Blood troll&lt;/a&gt;s worship the blood god &lt;a href=\"G%27huun\"&gt;G'huun&lt;/a&gt; and use blood magic. This magic corrupts the creatures around them and turns them into blood beasts. &lt;a href=\"Lorewalker%20Cho\"&gt;Lorewalker Cho&lt;/a&gt; claims the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; use blood magic, though the Zandalari themselves forbid it. This may be because of the proximity of the blood trolls to Zuldazar, or perhaps because of the Zandalari's historical fight against Hakkar. It is referred to as the old ways, and the Zandalari have only given in to the allure since Zuldazar's wall to the north fell.\nThe &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; were able &lt;a href=\"Flesh-shaping\"&gt;flesh-shapers&lt;/a&gt;. They used a vital substance called &lt;a href=\"Anima%20%28blood%20fluid%29\"&gt;anima&lt;/a&gt; to empower their &lt;a href=\"blood%20golem\"&gt;blood golem&lt;/a&gt;s. The &lt;a href=\"Dokani%20clan\"&gt;Dokani clan&lt;/a&gt; mogu use blood magic.\nThe &lt;a href=\"vampyr\"&gt;vampyr&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Darkfallen\"&gt;Darkfallen&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"San%27layn\"&gt;San'layn&lt;/a&gt; are known for their manipulation of blood magic.\nThe modern &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s can also specialize in manipulating &lt;a href=\"Death%20knight%23Blood\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt;, giving them the ability to carve into their enemies, sustaining themselves with deadly sanguine strikes, while using the bloody, shattered remains of the dead to fortify their own defenses.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Valley\"&gt;Alterac Valley&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lokholar%20the%20Ice%20Lord\"&gt;Lokholar the Ice Lord&lt;/a&gt; was summoned through a blood ritual.\n&lt;a href=\"Magister%20Astalor%20Bloodsworn\"&gt;Magister Astalor Bloodsworn&lt;/a&gt; used blood magic to empower &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Golem\"&gt;Blood Golem&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"Talador\"&gt;Talador&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"war%20in%20Draenor\"&gt;war in Draenor&lt;/a&gt;."}

Sometimes due to the geography of the surrounding area, portions of the graphic will be \"underground\" and only a portion of the object will be visible\u2014this is especially likely if the object spawns on the side of a hill.

It also seems Blood of Heroes are more likely to be found just as a server comes back online.\nStrategies.\nBlood of Heroes can be difficult to obtain, especially when playing solo, due to the object's guardian spawns. When opened, one or two &lt;a href=\"Fallen%20Hero\"&gt;Fallen Heroes&lt;/a&gt; are summoned. These mobs are hard-hitting level 60 elites with 9000 health and the ability Incapacitating Shout, which slows movement speed by 60% for 1 minute.

Be careful not to resurrect in aggro range of the elites, and be aware that some locations are quite far from graveyards."}

Its existence was first mentioned at &lt;a href=\"Blizzcon%202010\"&gt;Blizzcon 2010&lt;/a&gt;, when &lt;a href=\"Chris%20Metzen\"&gt;Chris Metzen&lt;/a&gt; said that it had been written but they had never found a good way to release it. It was released digitally as part of the \"\" collection on March 31st, 2014.\nIn an interview with WoW Insider, &lt;a href=\"Micky%20Neilson\"&gt;Micky Neilson&lt;/a&gt; said that they had decided to release it along with \"&lt;a href=\"Unbroken%20%28short%20story%29\"&gt;Unbroken&lt;/a&gt;\" and the &lt;a href=\"Leaders%20of%20Azeroth\"&gt;Leaders of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; stories in a single volume. According to Neilson, \"Blood of the Highborne\" serves a similar purpose to \"Unbroken\" (to formally introduce the Blood Knights as they did the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;), though as a novella, \"Highborne\" is considerably lengthier. The novella is told mostly from the perspective of &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt;, and explores her life throughout the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; and years prior, the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, as well as its aftermath, detailing her journey from priestess to warrior to &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knight\"&gt;Blood Knight&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; serves as a deuteragonist, exploring his own early regency and tribulations with the assistance of &lt;a href=\"Halduron%20Brightwing\"&gt;Halduron Brightwing&lt;/a&gt;, as well as detailing &lt;a href=\"Dar%27Khan%20Drathir\"&gt;Dar'Khan Drathir&lt;/a&gt;'s lust for power and eventual betrayal. The story also touches upon the dangers of magical addiction through Galell, Liadrin's one-time apprentice."}

{"id": "547948", "revid": "46586549", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=547948", "title": "Blood troll", "text": "Blood trolls are a &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; subgroup who inhabit the swamps of &lt;a href=\"Nazmir\"&gt;Nazmir&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt; and worship the blood god &lt;a href=\"G%27huun\"&gt;G'huun&lt;/a&gt;. They use forbidden &lt;a href=\"blood%20magic\"&gt;blood magic&lt;/a&gt;, which corrupts the creatures around them and turns them into blood beasts. The blood trolls originate from &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari troll&lt;/a&gt;s who long ago clung to the use of blood magic.\nThe blood trolls of Nazmir are the monsters that haunt every Zandalari &lt;a href=\"child\"&gt;child&lt;/a&gt;'s nightmares, and for good reason. In the Zandalari capital of &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt;, stories are passed down from generation to generation cautioning children to behave, lest Nazmir's twisted practitioners of blood magic come to snatch them from their beds, and those who dare brave the swamp have a habit of disappearing, never to return. The blood trolls can therefore be regarded as the \"boogeymen\" of Zandalari children.\nHistory.\nDuring the final era of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Tribes\"&gt;Council of Tribes&lt;/a&gt;, millennia ago, a foolish troll summoned &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20the%20Soulflayer\"&gt;Hakkar the Soulflayer&lt;/a&gt; to the island of Zandalar, which released a &lt;a href=\"plague%20of%20corrupted%20blood\"&gt;plague of corrupted blood&lt;/a&gt; killing thousands of trolls. It was deemed that the bodies, too polluted for proper burial, would instead be burned and kept in special urns. As time progressed, this method became commonplace among the Zandalari in disposing of their dead. After the great plague, there were still those who clung to the magics of the blood god. They tested their magics and perfected them. One such relic was a totem, which when concentrated upon, would drain not just the life from their enemies, but also their blood, infusing the caster with it and altering them in unusual ways. This was the dawn of who the Zandalari call \"the blood trolls\".\nAt some point, the blood trolls started worshiping &lt;a href=\"G%27huun\"&gt;G'huun&lt;/a&gt;. Because G'huun has no need for technology, the blood trolls regressed into a more primitive state compared to other troll races. Centuries ago, The worship of G'huun also appeared among the Zandalari still living in Nazmir and worshipping &lt;a href=\"Bwonsamdi\"&gt;Bwonsamdi&lt;/a&gt;, these &lt;a href=\"Vision%20of%20a%20Heretical%20Nazmani\"&gt;heretics&lt;/a&gt; then decided to corrupt, kill and defile the old worshippers of the loa, then joining the blood trolls.\nThe blood trolls fashioned their home within &lt;a href=\"Nazmir\"&gt;Nazmir&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Nazman\"&gt;Zul'Nazman&lt;/a&gt; serving as their capital. In the wake of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; earthquakes and tidal upheaval rocked the Zandalari trolls, causing widespread devastation on &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;. Following these natural disasters, the blood trolls began assaulting the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Gate\"&gt;Blood Gate&lt;/a&gt; within &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nBy the time of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the blood trolls were led by &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Ma%27da%20Ateena\"&gt;Grand Ma'da Ateena&lt;/a&gt;, who under G'huun's orders directed the blood trolls to strike against the &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt; within the region.\nBy the time &lt;a href=\"Talanji\"&gt;Princess Talanji&lt;/a&gt; of the Zandalari launched an &lt;a href=\"Talanji%27s%20Expedition\"&gt;expedition&lt;/a&gt; to deal with the blood trolls &lt;a href=\"Torga\"&gt;Torga&lt;/a&gt; would be slain, &lt;a href=\"Krag%27wa\"&gt;Krag'wa&lt;/a&gt; under assault, and &lt;a href=\"Hir%27eek\"&gt;Hir'eek&lt;/a&gt; corrupted into serving G'huun. After discovering that the blood trolls sought to unleash &lt;a href=\"Taloc\"&gt;Taloc&lt;/a&gt; on Zuldazar, Talanji and &lt;a href=\"Rokhan\"&gt;Rokhan&lt;/a&gt; sought to enlist the aid of the loa to aid them in the battle against the blood trolls. As they sought the aid of &lt;a href=\"Bwonsamdi\"&gt;Bwonsamdi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s would encounter his worshiper &lt;a href=\"Hanzabu\"&gt;Hanzabu&lt;/a&gt; who brought them to the &lt;a href=\"Necropolis%20%28Nazmir%29\"&gt;Necropolis&lt;/a&gt; to meet with him. After tasking the adventurer with cleansing his temple of the spirits who had abandoned Bwonsamdi for G'huun, Bwonsamdi agreed to pledge his powers to the fight against the blood trolls in exchange for one million souls. The ritual to finalize their contract was interrupted by the blood trolls and their matriarch, who were successfully fought off. For being attacked in his own temple, Bwonsamdi declared that the blood trolls would be mighty sorry.\nWhile seeking the aid of Hir'eek, Horde adventurers would discover his grim fate and with the aid of &lt;a href=\"Jo%27chunga\"&gt;Jo'chunga&lt;/a&gt; and his poison end the corrupted loa. The death of their loa enraged the blood trolls causing Grand Ma'da Ateena to declare after Zuldazar fell the Horde would be next. After discovering Torga's death, the Horde would strike back against the blood trolls and later witness the reincarnation of Torga. Seeking the aid of the final loa within Nazmir, the expedition discovered the blood troll assault on Krag'wa. The blood trolls drained his children of their blood and planned to sacrifice Krag'wa himself. They slew every last one of his worshipers in Nazmir. From all of this, Krag'wa was greatly weakened and had to be made strong again. After restoring his power by eating a feast and releasing the power sealed in his totems, Krag'wa unleashed his fury on the blood trolls.\nWith the aid of the loa and Horde &lt;a href=\"Gob%20Squad\"&gt;reinforcements&lt;/a&gt;, Talanji's expedition launched an assault on the blood troll capital that saw to the death of Grand Ma'da Ateena and Taloc being blasted into &lt;a href=\"Uldir\"&gt;Uldir&lt;/a&gt; itself. Some time after the death of their matriarch, an army of blood trolls launched an attack on the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Gate\"&gt;Blood Gate&lt;/a&gt;. Though the blood troll army would fall to the combined might of the Zandalari and the Horde, &lt;a href=\"King%20Rastakhan\"&gt;King Rastakhan&lt;/a&gt; was aware that the blood trolls could surge forth once again.\nBlood trolls under the command of &lt;a href=\"Ma%27da%20Renkala\"&gt;Ma'da Renkala&lt;/a&gt; joined with &lt;a href=\"Zul\"&gt;Zul&lt;/a&gt; in attacking Zuldazar with the goal of breaking the final seal keeping G'huun imprisoned. Though both Zul and Renkala would be slain the final would seal would be broken by &lt;a href=\"Mythrax%20the%20Unraveler\"&gt;Mythrax the Unraveler&lt;/a&gt;. With G'huun now free from his imprisonment a number of blood trolls came to reside within &lt;a href=\"Uldir\"&gt;Uldir&lt;/a&gt;. Following the &lt;a href=\"Zul%2C%20Reborn\"&gt;rebirth of Zul&lt;/a&gt;, the blood trolls would follow his commands in the battle against &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;enemies&lt;/a&gt; of their dark god. Unwilling to let G'huun free himself a group of adventurers stormed Uldir doing battle against the blood trolls, Zul, and even G'huun himself, ultimately killing the blood god.\nThe state of the blood trolls following the death of their god and leaders is unknown. \nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Faction%20Assault%20on%20Nazmir\"&gt;Faction Assault on Nazmir&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"High%20Warlord%20Cromush\"&gt;High Warlord Cromush&lt;/a&gt; was confident that the Alliance could never take Nazmir and would likely get themselves killed by blood trolls. This seems to suggest that even with their losses the blood trolls still have a capable army.\nSeeking to sever the bonds between the Zandalari and the Horde, the Alliance sought to &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Dazar%27alor%20%28battle%29\"&gt;strike&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Dazar%27alor\"&gt;Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt; itself. However, the Alliance sought to trick the Zandalari and the Horde that they were going to attack from Nazmir. To this end, the Alliance wrested control of &lt;a href=\"Zalamar\"&gt;Zalamar&lt;/a&gt; away from the blood trolls in order to establish their forces within the village.\nCulture and people.\nThe blood trolls' culture is very harsh and the most primitive troll culture there is because their god &lt;a href=\"G%27huun\"&gt;G'huun&lt;/a&gt; has no need for technology. Their society is also matriarchal; males follow the orders from females without question lest they get chained up and punished or outright sacrificed. Male blood trolls use the word \"ma'da\" (&lt;a href=\"Zandali\"&gt;Zandali&lt;/a&gt; for \"mother\") as a term of respect for the females of their society. Males are usually just said to be \"drudges\".\nBlood trolls are &lt;a href=\"cannibal\"&gt;cannibal&lt;/a&gt;s, the whispers of their god telling them that eating flesh makes them stronger. Females of the &lt;a href=\"Natha%27vor%20tribe\"&gt;Natha'vor tribe&lt;/a&gt; cannibalize particularly on the males within the tribe, and call their three most powerful &lt;a href=\"witch%20doctor\"&gt;witch doctor&lt;/a&gt;s \"corpse mongers\".\nThe &lt;a href=\"Amaki%20tribe\"&gt;Amaki tribe&lt;/a&gt; keep their men as &lt;a href=\"Amaki%20War%20Slave\"&gt;slaves&lt;/a&gt; while &lt;a href=\"Amaki%20Bloodsinger\"&gt;bloodsinger&lt;/a&gt;s drain male \"volunteers\" for blood to use to turn &lt;a href=\"Krag%27wa\"&gt;Krag'wa&lt;/a&gt;'s tadpoles into &lt;a href=\"crawg\"&gt;crawg&lt;/a&gt;s.\nBlood trolls fuel their &lt;a href=\"voodoo\"&gt;voodoo&lt;/a&gt; with profane blood rituals, harnessing undead monstrosities to do their bidding. Many who enter the swamps do not leave, instead, become a sacrifice to G'huun. Their mastery of blood magic trumps that of other trolls.\nBlood troll poisons are made to paralyze, not kill because they want prisoners alive.\nFemale &lt;a href=\"dire%20troll\"&gt;dire troll&lt;/a&gt;s appear to be highly regarded within blood troll society and are often referred to as \"Warmothers\"; some, like &lt;a href=\"Warmother%20Nagla\"&gt;Warmother Nagla&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Warmother%20Boatema\"&gt;Warmother Boatema&lt;/a&gt; are the leaders of a tribe."}

Without flying, the spire can only be accessed from the south by climbing a huge stair from the &lt;a href=\"Thundering%20Terrace\"&gt;Thundering Terrace&lt;/a&gt;, which can in turn only be reached by traversing a large bridge spanning the ravine known as the &lt;a href=\"Slithering%20Gulch\"&gt;Slithering Gulch&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe spire area itself consists of a vast, crystal-littered plaza where numerous Faithless congregate. This plaza extends into a separate eastern area roamed by sethrak &lt;a href=\"skycaller\"&gt;skycaller&lt;/a&gt;s, while heading west leads to an area known the &lt;a href=\"Sacred%20Sands\"&gt;Sacred Sands&lt;/a&gt;. Above everything looms a gargantuan spire in the shape of a hooded snake that is periodically struck by lightning and can be seen even from many far-off corners of Vol'dun. The entrance to the Temple of Sethraliss lies at the base of this spire.\nAfter wreaking havoc on the Faithless forces at the &lt;a href=\"Crater%20of%20Conquerors\"&gt;Crater of Conquerors&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Crackling%20Ridge\"&gt;Crackling Ridge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vorrik\"&gt;Vorrik&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; rode on &lt;a href=\"Rakjan%20the%20Unbroken\"&gt;Rakjan the Unbroken&lt;/a&gt; to rain destruction on the Faithless in the Slithering Gulch, before heading over to the Skycallers' Spire to confront the Faithless ruler, &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Korthek\"&gt;Emperor Korthek&lt;/a&gt; himself. The Faithless attempted to bar their way with a lightning barrier, but Vorrik dispelled it using his empowered staff, after which he and the adventurer landed on the spire plaza. With the aid of &lt;a href=\"Nisha\"&gt;Nisha&lt;/a&gt; and liberated &lt;a href=\"vulpera\"&gt;vulpera&lt;/a&gt; slaves from the Crater of Conquerors, the adventurer created enough chaos around the spire to force Korthek to emerge from the Temple of Sethraliss and face the intruders. After a final battle, Vorrik, Nisha, and the adventurer slew Korthek, though not before he revealed that &lt;a href=\"General%20Jakra%27zet\"&gt;General Jakra'zet&lt;/a&gt; had already acquired the keystones to &lt;a href=\"Atul%27Aman\"&gt;Atul'Aman&lt;/a&gt;.\nInhabitants.\nDuring the end of the &lt;a href=\"Vol%27dun%20storyline\"&gt;Vol'dun storyline&lt;/a&gt;:\nDuring &lt;a href=\"The%20Fall%20of%20Emperor%20Korthek\"&gt;The Fall of Emperor Korthek&lt;/a&gt;:"}

They will activate as soon as a player enters their (considerably large) aggro radius. They do not have an aggro table and appear to be both untauntable and have unlimited range. When activated, the entire cloud of stars will start firing painful bolts of magic at random party members and will not stop until you (or they) are dead.\nFeign Death doesn't fool them for an instant and it does not seem possible to out-range or LOS them within the instance.\nThey only have around 35k hit points (62k on Heroic) and are hence relatively fast to kill, provided the party starts this fight like they mean it. If a group accidentally trips them and attempts to withdraw (or goes in half-heartedly after someone triggers it too early) then the whole party will probably die. \nThis makes it one of the few encounters where a frantic charge and indiscriminate beating is not merely acceptable, but recommended."}

Since its first deployment against &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; himself in &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt;, the \"Skyfire\" served frequently in many of the Alliance's subsequent campaigns, including the offensive in &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, and the war in the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;. Its prestigious service and fierce reputation led it to become known as the pride of the Alliance fleet.\nOriginally captained by &lt;a href=\"Sky%20Captain%20Swayze\"&gt;Sky Captain Swayze&lt;/a&gt;, following the defeat of Deathwing the \"Skyfire\" was overhauled and placed under the command of &lt;a href=\"Sky%20Admiral%20Rogers\"&gt;Sky Admiral Rogers&lt;/a&gt;. The gunship would eventually be heavily damaged during a battle with the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Windrunner%20Fleet\"&gt;Windrunner Fleet&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormheim\"&gt;Stormheim&lt;/a&gt; and subsequently crash, though much of the crew would survive.\nHistory.\nEnding the Destroyer.\nThe \"Skyfire\", helmed by &lt;a href=\"Sky%20Captain%20Swayze\"&gt;Sky Captain Swayze&lt;/a&gt;, was first called into service to aid in the defense of &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Soul\"&gt;final battle&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20Deathwing\"&gt;war against Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;. Along with a &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"gunship\"&gt;gunship&lt;/a&gt;, the \"Skyfire\" engaged the &lt;a href=\"Black%20dragonflight\"&gt;Black&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20dragonflight\"&gt;Twilight&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"dragonflight\"&gt;dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;s in the skies of &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt; to protect &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt; as they prepared to use the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Demon Soul&lt;/a&gt; against Deathwing himself. Once the Destroyer had been wounded by the Demon Soul, he attempted to flee toward the &lt;a href=\"Maelstrom\"&gt;Maelstrom&lt;/a&gt; across the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Sea\"&gt;Frozen Sea&lt;/a&gt;. Thrall, the Dragon Aspects, and &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt; of the Alliance and Horde boarded the \"Skyfire\" and quickly set off in pursuit.\nDuring the chase, the gunship was assaulted by the Deathwing's personal escort of drake riders, led by &lt;a href=\"Warmaster%20Blackhorn\"&gt;Warmaster Blackhorn&lt;/a&gt;. The \"Skyfire\"'s crew would fight to repel this attack, dealing with boarders, &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Sapper\"&gt;sappers&lt;/a&gt;, fires, &lt;a href=\"twilight%20dragon\"&gt;twilight dragon&lt;/a&gt;s, and eventually Blackhorn himself and the dragon &lt;a href=\"Goriona\"&gt;Goriona&lt;/a&gt;. Having defeated the assailants, the \"Skyfire\" would catch up with the Black Aspect and . Sky Captain Swayze himself was among those who undertook this mission and was eventually thrown from Deathwing's back, falling into the Frozen Sea. The efforts of the \"Skyfire\" and its crew proved a major contribution to Deathwing's eventual defeat at the Maelstrom.\nPandaria offensive.\nAfter the victory over &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sky%20Admiral%20Rogers\"&gt;Sky Admiral Rogers&lt;/a&gt; became the new captain of the \"Skyfire\", and the &lt;a href=\"gunship\"&gt;gunship&lt;/a&gt; was given a complete overhaul. These improvements would include a full complement of both fixed-wing and &lt;a href=\"Gyrocopter\"&gt;gyro aircraft&lt;/a&gt; as well as a battery of 18-inch smoothbore shore bombardment &lt;a href=\"cannon\"&gt;cannon&lt;/a&gt;s, and the \"Skyfire\" was returned to active duty in the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20navy\"&gt;Alliance navy&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpon the discovery of the mist-shrouded land of &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, the \"Skyfire\" was chosen to undertake an elite mission to the continent to search for the missing &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Prince Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, referred to in code as the \"White Pawn\". Specially-selected Alliance &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;agents&lt;/a&gt; were also chosen to accompany the mission, along with &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;'s . Upon arriving in Pandaria's &lt;a href=\"Jade%20Forest\"&gt;Jade Forest&lt;/a&gt;, established in &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%27ar%20Point\"&gt;Garrosh'ar Point&lt;/a&gt;. Sky Captain Rogers quickly ordered the \"Skyfire\" to engage the enemy, and a battle between the two sides broke out.\nThe \"Skyfire\"'s airborne forces were successful in wiping out much of the Horde fleet and other forces, while its guns bombarded the enemy positions from above and its marines eventually cleared out the base. In the aftermath of the fight, Sky Admiral Rogers would order the deaths of a number of defeated &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; troops, which subsequently led to the appearance of the &lt;a href=\"sha\"&gt;sha&lt;/a&gt;. The \"Skyfire\" would later depart from Pandaria and rejoin the main Alliance fleet to provide escort, leaving &lt;a href=\"Taylor\"&gt;Captain Taylor&lt;/a&gt; and his unit on their own in the Jade Forest to discover the whereabouts of Prince Anduin.\nTwo months after the battle at Garrosh'ar, the Alliance's &lt;a href=\"7th%20Fleet\"&gt;7th Fleet&lt;/a&gt; arrived in the &lt;a href=\"Krasarang%20Wilds\"&gt;Krasarang Wilds&lt;/a&gt; of Pandaria, bringing with it an invasion force, launching . The \"Skyfire\" would join the campaign in the region against the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; based from &lt;a href=\"Domination%20Point\"&gt;Domination Point&lt;/a&gt;. During the conflict, the gunship would serve as a forward command post for an Alliance assault on the Horde's main base, accompanied by a squadron of &lt;a href=\"battleship\"&gt;battleship&lt;/a&gt;s. The \"Skyfire\"'s air fleet would ultimately cause serious damage to Domination Point's defenses, though the Horde also fielded powerful surface-to-air artillery.\nAt some point during the Pandaria campaign, the \"Skyfire\" would also champion the &lt;a href=\"Assault%20on%20Zan%27vess\"&gt;Assault on Zan'vess&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"sha\"&gt;sha&lt;/a&gt;-corrupted &lt;a href=\"mantid\"&gt;mantid&lt;/a&gt;. Their objective was to secure a major mantid weapons cache, to prevent the forces of &lt;a href=\"Warchief%20Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Warchief Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; from doing the same.\nBroken Isles.\nMuch of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20navy\"&gt;Alliance navy&lt;/a&gt; was marshaled in preparation for the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, where the combined might of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s major factions hoped to drive back &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;the invasion&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. The battle would ultimately go extremely poor for the Alliance and Horde, who suffered a major defeat.\nThe \"Skyfire\" was called in to evacuate &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt;, and a besieged group of Alliance forces near the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;. As it prepared to depart from the battle, the gunship was hampered by a massive &lt;a href=\"fel%20reaver\"&gt;fel reaver&lt;/a&gt;, which threatened to destroy the ship. Only the sacrifice of King Varian himself preserved the vessel, who leaped onto the fel reaver and managed to destroy it with &lt;a href=\"Shalamayne\"&gt;Shalamayne&lt;/a&gt;. Though the \"Skyfire\" and the other Alliance members escaped, Varian was subsequently slain by the &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; .\nThe \"Skyfire\" returned to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; after the disaster on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, where many of its occupants would attend King Varian's subsequent funeral at &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt;. Not long afterward, the ship was prepared for a major Alliance expedition to &lt;a href=\"Stormheim\"&gt;Stormheim&lt;/a&gt; (receiving an installation of new guns) with the stated goal of retrieving the &lt;a href=\"%3AAegis%20of%20Aggramar\"&gt;:Aegis of Aggramar&lt;/a&gt;, though unofficially to also gain revenge against the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; for their perceived betrayal in the previous battle.\nWhen the \"Skyfire\" arrived on Stormheim's northern coast, it spotted the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Windrunner%20Fleet\"&gt;Windrunner Fleet&lt;/a&gt; below, and the vengeful &lt;a href=\"Sky%20Admiral%20Rogers\"&gt;Sky Admiral Rogers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; quickly ordered an attack on the Horde fleet. The \"Skyfire\"'s opening volley caused great destruction, and a large battle quickly broke out between the two sides. Marines from the &lt;a href=\"gunship\"&gt;gunship&lt;/a&gt; began systematically boarding and seizing enemy ships one by one, searching for Sylvanas. Upon taking the &lt;a href=\"The%20Windrunner\"&gt;\"Windrunner\"&lt;/a&gt;, the Dark Lady's flagship, they discovered that the Warchief had already departed. While this had been happening, Horde forces had also managed to board the \"Skyfire\" itself and sabotage the vessel.\nThe Alliance boarding parties returned to the gunship and attempted to repair the damage done while dealing with the Horde infiltrators, though it proved in vain. A fierce battle on the upper deck between Genn Greymane and the Forsaken lieutenant &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller\"&gt;Nathanos Blightcaller&lt;/a&gt; continued, but the damage in the \"Skyfire\"'s hold triggered a major explosion before one could slay the other. Hopelessly devastated, the \"Skyfire\" lost control and crashed hard into the mountains of midwestern Stormheim.\nIn the wake of the crash, the surviving crew (including Sky Admiral Rogers) rallied to the &lt;a href=\"Skyfire%20Triage%20Camp\"&gt;Skyfire Triage Camp&lt;/a&gt;. From there, they began to salvage what remained of the \"Skyfire\", rescue any other surviving crew members, and deal with the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; boarders who also endured the crash. Despite the terrible loss of the ship, most of the crew apparently survived, and were able to make contact with the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20navy\"&gt;Alliance navy&lt;/a&gt; afterwards. Though regretful, Sky Admiral Rogers remained determined that as long as the survivors kept fighting, the \"Skyfire\" would live on.\nCrew.\nFormerly:\nAttached personnel:\nAttached fleet:\nWeaponry:"}

This was probably because before, she was so small it was easy for players to completely cover her, especially those with large mounts such as Netherdrakes. This was especially annoying on PvP realms as it would usually end with a player of the opposite faction accidentally right-clicking the person covering Khatie, therefore auto-attacking them and aggroing the guards."}

At the hall's center sits &lt;a href=\"Odyn\"&gt;Keeper Odyn&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"Hymdall\"&gt;Hymdall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Darius%20Crowley\"&gt;Lord Darius Crowley&lt;/a&gt; (for Alliance players) or &lt;a href=\"Eitrigg\"&gt;Eitrigg&lt;/a&gt; (for Horde players) at his right and left sides, respectively.\n&lt;a href=\"Hruthnir\"&gt;Hruthnir&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Magnar%20Icebreaker\"&gt;Magnar Icebreaker&lt;/a&gt; can be found on the far left side, while &lt;a href=\"Renfield\"&gt;Renfield&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Svergan%20Stormcloak\"&gt;Svergan Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt; can be found on the far right side. The &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Challenger%27s%20Bounty\"&gt;Grand Challenger's Bounty&lt;/a&gt; can be located at the entrance to the hall.\nTravel points.\nOnce a player has progressed through a zone, a &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr%20of%20Odyn\"&gt;Val'kyr of Odyn&lt;/a&gt; will enable the player to use &lt;a href=\"Jump%20to%20Skyhold\"&gt;Jump to Skyhold&lt;/a&gt; to enter Skyhold, talking to Aerylia, the player can return to any of the zones.\nUsing this means of travel will lead the player to these places:\nOrder Hall Advancement.\nEinar the Runecaster handles the Warrior's Order Hall advancement upgrades. There are 8 tiers with each tier having two available upgrades to choose from, except two tiers which only have one upgrade. Each upgrade will require &lt;a href=\"Order%20Resources\"&gt;Order Resources&lt;/a&gt; and a research time before their buff will be available. Once upgraded, a player can change to the other upgrade by paying another Order Resources cost and waiting the required research time.\nArtifact Weapons.\nOdyn supplies the Battlelord with weapons of great power, each fitting a different specialization. The quest to obtain the first weapon is available at level 98 and the warrior must decide which weapon to choose, however this limitation is short as the other two other weapon quests are available at level 102, enabling the warrior to have all 3 weapons. Each weapon initially came with four unlockable appearances and one hidden appearance. Each appearance has 4 color tints which can be unlocked by achieving a certain requirement. A new appearance was made available with &lt;a href=\"patch%207.2\"&gt;patch 7.2&lt;/a&gt;, requiring the player to complete a difficult solo challenge to unlock it. In addition, each weapon has a hidden trait unique to that weapon.\nIn order to attempt the challenge, your character must be level 100, have 35 &lt;a href=\"Artifact%20Trait\"&gt;Artifact Trait&lt;/a&gt;s and complete the new Empowered Trait questline. This must be done for each weapon in order to unlock its challenge. In addition, your region must have constructed the &lt;a href=\"Mage%20Tower%20%28Broken%20Shore%29\"&gt;Mage Tower&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Deliverance%20Point\"&gt;Deliverance Point&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;. Speak to &lt;a href=\"War%20Councilor%20Victoria\"&gt;War Councilor Victoria&lt;/a&gt; once the Mage Tower is constructed to attempt the challenge. The first attempt is free, with subsequent attempts costing .\nArms, Strom'kar, the Warbreaker.\nHidden trait: &lt;a href=\"Surrounded%20by%20Trolls%21\"&gt;Surrounded by Trolls!&lt;/a&gt; - When Strom'kar is equipped, all nearby hostile NPC &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s become feared for 2 minutes.\nHidden appearance.\nUnlocking the hidden appearance requires obtaining and using &lt;a href=\"The%20Arcanite%20Bladebreaker\"&gt;The Arcanite Bladebreaker&lt;/a&gt;, which is rewarded from the quest &lt;a href=\"Secrets%20of%20the%20Axes\"&gt;Secrets of the Axes&lt;/a&gt; handed by Master Smith Helgar. The quest has a daily chance of being available for the day for each region, and is available to everyone in that region. If the quest is available, a dialog option will appear, saying \"Is there an axe equal to Strom'kar?\". Follow that line of dialog to unlock the quest.\nChallenging appearance.\nThe Arms weapon challenge, &lt;a href=\"Closing%20the%20Eye\"&gt;Closing the Eye&lt;/a&gt;, requires you to defeat &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Xylem\"&gt;Archmage Xylem&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Eye of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;.\nFury, Odyn's Fury and Helya's Wrath.\nHidden trait: &lt;a href=\"Gaze%20of%20the%20Val%27kyr\"&gt;Gaze of the Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt; - When the Warswords of the Valarjar are equipped, Gaze of the Val'kyr will sometimes trigger when a mob/NPC strikes a killing blow against you, preventing your demise for 8 seconds. If you defeat the enemy that killed you in those 8 seconds, you will stay alive and gain 50% of your health back, if you don't, you will die.\nHidden appearance.\nUnlocking the hidden appearance requires creating and using &lt;a href=\"The%20Dragonslayers\"&gt;The Dragonslayers&lt;/a&gt;, which is created by combining three items which require Exalted reputation with the &lt;a href=\"Valarjar\"&gt;Valarjar&lt;/a&gt; to obtain:\nChallenging appearance.\nThe Fury weapon challenge, &lt;a href=\"An%20Impossible%20Foe\"&gt;An Impossible Foe&lt;/a&gt;, requires you to defeat &lt;a href=\"Agatha%20%28demon%29\"&gt;Agatha&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Fiendish%20Vault\"&gt;Fiendish Vault&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Azsuna\"&gt;Azsuna&lt;/a&gt;.\nProtection, Scale of the Earth-Warder and Scaleshard.\nHidden trait: unknown\nHidden appearance.\nUnlocking the hidden appearance requires looting and using &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Plate%20of%20the%20Worldbreaker\"&gt;Burning Plate of the Worldbreaker&lt;/a&gt;, which can occasionally be found on a pile of treasure in &lt;a href=\"Neltharion%27s%20Vault\"&gt;Neltharion's Vault&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Highmountain\"&gt;Highmountain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;. The player's &lt;a href=\"Artifact%20Knowledge\"&gt;Artifact Knowledge&lt;/a&gt; must be at least Level 5 in order to see this item.\nChallenging appearance.\nThe Protection weapon challenge, &lt;a href=\"The%20Highlord%27s%20Return\"&gt;The Highlord's Return&lt;/a&gt;, requires you to defeat &lt;a href=\"Highlord%20Kruul\"&gt;Highlord Kruul&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpeculation.\nIn the alpha, spirits of famous &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s were in Skyhold, but they were removed because it didn't feel appropriate to &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard&lt;/a&gt; for these &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; heroes to appear in this &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; place. The identity of these removed heroes is still unknown. However, checking the NPC IDs on &lt;a href=\"Wowhead\"&gt;Wowhead&lt;/a&gt;, starting with the version of &lt;a href=\"Danath%20Trollbane\"&gt;Danath Trollbane&lt;/a&gt; used during the &lt;a href=\"Return%20to%20the%20Broken%20Shore%20%28Alliance%29\"&gt;Return to the Broken Shore (Alliance)&lt;/a&gt; warrior class quest (&lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wowhead.com/npc%3D96183/danath-trollbane\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) and increasing incrementally, the IDs lead to several consecutive unused warrior NPCs that were possibly meant to appear in Skyhold.\nConsidering some of these are still living to this day, it is possible that other living warriors were meant to be accepted into Skyhold like the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Battlelord&lt;/a&gt;. The presence of &lt;a href=\"Nazgrim\"&gt;Nazgrim&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thoras%20Trollbane\"&gt;Thoras Trollbane&lt;/a&gt; may also indicate that they were not maybe always meant to be part of the reborn &lt;a href=\"Four%20Horsemen%23Original%20Legion%20intent\"&gt;Horsemen&lt;/a&gt;. Several of them have a placeholder model, though others such as Anduin Lothar had never appeared in \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" before.\n&lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; might have been originally intended intended to be a Valarjar's sub-leader, according to &lt;a href=\"New%20Recruit%20%28warrior%29\"&gt;New Recruit (warrior)&lt;/a&gt;, which had similar variants given by the other class halls' sub-leaders."}

Her mastery of rylaks has made Tovra an invaluable asset, and she now commands the aerial forces of the Iron Horde.\"\nOverview.\nSkylord Tovra engages players while her rylak bombards the platform, creating pools of Diffused Energy. The number of active pools increases as the fight progresses.\nStrategy.\nSkylord Tovra is a high movement encounter. The rylak is untargetable and will shoot Diffused Energy down at the arena, temporarily cover a portion of the ground with pools of lightning. The pools dissipate and the rylak fires again about every 20 seconds, making the safe areas constantly changing. Stay away from the lightning and be ready to move when Tovra orders the rylak to fire (\"Another one!\" \"Show em what your made of!\" etc).\nThe boss herself throws a spinning spear at a random player and while the damage is manageable on its own, the combination of the spear strike and lightning may be enough to kill one of the party members. The healer should be ready to heal off any extra damage from the spinning and explosive spears. Lastly, the boss will throw a &lt;a href=\"Freezing%20Trap\"&gt;Freezing Trap&lt;/a&gt; at a random player to keep them rooted in the lightning. Simply move away from the trap before it arms itself and it will not trigger. "}

Most boars are &lt;a href=\"neutral\"&gt;neutral&lt;/a&gt; when approached and are generally omnivorous. They start at around large dog-sized and get larger from there. Some boars are minions of the &lt;a href=\"quilboar\"&gt;quilboar&lt;/a&gt;s and are revered within quilboar culture, and particularly large and tenacious ones are seen as a favor from &lt;a href=\"Agamaggan\"&gt;Agamaggan&lt;/a&gt;. Boar meat is the staple diet of the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s.\nBoars are found in &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Morogh\"&gt;Dun Morogh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Loch%20Modan\"&gt;Loch Modan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Elwynn%20Forest\"&gt;Elwynn Forest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Razorfen%20Kraul\"&gt;Razorfen Kraul&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Razorfen%20Downs\"&gt;Razorfen Downs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Eastern Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href=\"Feralas\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt;. Boars are often killed early on for their &lt;a href=\"food\"&gt;food&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ingredient\"&gt;ingredient&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"drop\"&gt;drop&lt;/a&gt;s.\nIn Blasted Lands, there were two types of boars - the ash-mane and the helboar.\nBoars can be two feet high and two feet wide.\nBoars that can attack with quills are known as &lt;a href=\"quilbeast\"&gt;quilbeast&lt;/a&gt;s.\nBiology.\nBoar meat, snouts, kidneys and livers are all suitable for consumption.\nTypes.\nArmored.\nThere are three types of armored boar that dwell in &lt;a href=\"Razorfen%20Kraul\"&gt;Razorfen Kraul&lt;/a&gt; and into other places ; despite appearances, they are tamable by hunters.\nUndead.\nThere are also a &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; variety of boars, which sometimes, despite their unconventional appearance, can be tamed.\nDraenor boars.\nA new model of boars was introduced with the expansion. These appear to be the predecessors of the &lt;a href=\"helboar\"&gt;helboar&lt;/a&gt;s seen in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Great%20Greytusk\"&gt;great greytusks&lt;/a&gt; shed their tusks once a year and are extremely shy until they grow back. &lt;a href=\"Rocktusk%20Battleboar\"&gt;Rocktusk battleboars&lt;/a&gt; attract mates with their distinctive manes, which resemble mohawks.\n&lt;a href=\"Armored%20Frostboar\"&gt;Frostboars&lt;/a&gt; subsist on a diet almost entirely of frozen berries, though they find slow off-worlders equally tasty. As part of the rite of passage into adulthood, a &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20Orcs\"&gt;Frostwolf orc&lt;/a&gt; must slay a frostboar and carve their family genealogy as far back as will fit on the creature's largest tusk. Family history and tradition are of great importance to the Frostwolf clan, so the largest frostboars are hunted each season to preserve clan lineage.\nAs a hunter pet.\nBoars are a family of &lt;a href=\"Pet_abilities%23Tenacity_abilities\"&gt;Tenacity pets&lt;/a&gt; and are tamable by &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s starting at level 10. &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt; hunters start with a &lt;a href=\"Young%20Boar\"&gt;Young Boar&lt;/a&gt; at level 1. Boars, through use of their &lt;a href=\"Gore%20%28BC%20Classic%29\"&gt;Gore (BC Classic)&lt;/a&gt; ability, can cause the target to take 30% additional damage from bleed effects for 15 seconds. This makes them a fair choice in raids when player-provided debuffs such as &lt;a href=\"Mangle\"&gt;Mangle&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Hemorrhage\"&gt;Hemorrhage&lt;/a&gt; effect is not available. A &lt;a href=\"Marksman\"&gt;Marksman&lt;/a&gt; hunter with &lt;a href=\"Piercing%20Shots\"&gt;Piercing Shots&lt;/a&gt; can also use a boar pet to boost their own damage.\nThere are fourteen different skins available for boar pets. Most unique of mention are the demonic &lt;a href=\"helboar\"&gt;helboar&lt;/a&gt;s which feature huge spikes, horns and bright coloring. Players have always been fond of the armored boars found in Razorfen Kraul, as well. &lt;a href=\"Undead\"&gt;Undead&lt;/a&gt; hunters may also prefer the ghastly, eyeless found in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Eastern Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;. Boars are also the default starting pet for Orc Hunters.\nBoars were one of the very few pets easy to feed, a feature that appealed to many hunters. The only other pets capable of eating all types of foods are the &lt;a href=\"bear\"&gt;bear&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"dog\"&gt;dog&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"goat\"&gt;goat&lt;/a&gt;s.\nIn the RPG.\nThough not carnivores, these wild swine are bad-tempered; they usually charge anyone who disturbs them. A boar is covered in coarse, grayish-black fur. Adult males are about 4 feet long and 3 feet high at the shoulder. A boar is such a tenacious combatant that it continues to fight without penalty even while disabled or dying."}

{"id": "49611", "revid": "452956", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=49611", "title": "Body pulling", "text": "Body pulling is a method of &lt;a href=\"pulling\"&gt;pulling&lt;/a&gt; that relies on walking into a &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"aggro%20radius\"&gt;aggro radius&lt;/a&gt;, instead of the most common one by damaging it with a ranged attack. The method leads to the mob noticing you and comes running for you (or starts firing or casting from a range if it has ranged attacks).\nAn advantage to body pulling is that the range at which mobs detect damage tends to be slightly larger than the range at which they will simply run along with a friendly mob to see what the fuss is about. As such, it is possible to separate some groups with body pulls where any form of damage-based pulling would pull the entire group.\nOne difficulty with executing such body pulls is that it takes a while for mobs to react to you being in their aggro range. If you just keep walking ahead until something happens, chances are that you have actually placed yourself in the aggro range of yet another mob (an \"&lt;a href=\"add\"&gt;add&lt;/a&gt;\") which will trigger shortly after you notice the first one coming for you.\nPlayers attempting a tricky pull with body pulling will commonly take a few quick steps ahead and then retreat and watch for a reaction. If there was no reaction, the procedure is repeated, only slightly farther ahead than the previous time. This takes good reactions, eye-hand coordination, and perhaps most of all patience. It will be quicker once you know the aggro range of a given type of mob of a given level, which is where the experience comes in."}

Afterwards they will follow you around much like certain quest NPCs, assisting you in defeating enemies. Bodyguards only accompany you in the outside world. They do not accompany you into dungeons, raids or PvP instances.\nAs you defeat enemies while accompanied by your garrison follower you gain reputation with that follower and eventually unlock follower-specific special abilities such as a garrison portal or remote follower mission management. The first ability (a combat ability, such as Delvar's Breath of Sindragosa or Vivianne's Meteor) requires at least 10,000/20,000 reputation (Trusted Bodyguard) and level 100, after which you can talk to the bodyguard to complete a quest. The second ability (a non-combat ability, such as Tormmok's repairs, Ishaal's mail or Aeda and Illona's summoning stones) requires 20,000/20,000 reputation points (Personal Wingman) and a quest.\nIf a garrison bodyguard is defeated, your character get a debuff which prevents that bodyguard from accompanying you for 1 hour (real time), however you can still take another bodyguard with you while you're waiting for the debuff to expire, and defeated bodyguards can still run missions while the debuff is in effect."}

They look like swamp monsters.

Bog beasts may represent a type of conglomerate &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt; of earth and water as suggested by the term \"tar beast\". &lt;a href=\"Denalan\"&gt;Denalan&lt;/a&gt;, the botanist and quest giver NPC in Darnassus, notes that timberlings are connected to the land around them: \"The Timberlings are elementals of nature. In some ways, they reflect the natural order of the plants and animals on our great tree.\"\nThe &lt;a href=\"Mouldering%20Mirebeast\"&gt;mirebeasts&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Wetlands\"&gt;Wetlands&lt;/a&gt; are symptoms of the earth's disturbance, a foulness of rot given form. They take the shape of bog beasts, infested within with decaying spores, forcing out flourished life in the swamp taking all and leaving only rot. \nBiology.\nA bog beast's roots, which grow on the outside of their bodies, are suitable for consumption.\nThe fungus that also grows on them can be combined with the heart of a &lt;a href=\"panther\"&gt;panther&lt;/a&gt; and the blood of a &lt;a href=\"Green%20Dragonflight\"&gt;green dragon&lt;/a&gt; to make a truth serum, while dew glands found within the bog beast can be used as a makeshift water sac.\nIn the RPG.\nThese massive plants might be mistaken for a thick clump of vegetation if not for its vaguely humanoid shape and surprising mobility. As the name suggests, bog beasts are massive, shambling monsters that are half plant and half beast. Not much is known about these secretive lords of the swamp except that they are territorial and quite aggressive. Explorers have recorded stories of their immense strength and resilience to harm. Bog beasts are known to wander the &lt;a href=\"Dustwallow%20Marsh\"&gt;Dustwallow Marsh&lt;/a&gt; south of the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt;. Bog beasts use their strength to slam into their enemies, crushing opponents' defenses with their fists and whatever large objects they can throw at them.\nBog beasts are also found in the &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20of%20Sorrows\"&gt;Swamp of Sorrows&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;. These creatures are classified as &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt;s in the \"World of Warcraft\". However in lore depending on type they vary between being elementals (\"timberlings\", \"thistleshrubs\", \"tar beasts\") and/or ambulatory &lt;a href=\"plant\"&gt;plant&lt;/a&gt;s. that being the case, the &lt;a href=\"Warlock\"&gt;Warlock&lt;/a&gt; can use their &lt;a href=\"Banish\"&gt;Banish&lt;/a&gt; spell on them. Something one may overlook because they do not look like the usual elementals or demons.\nThe plant creatures &lt;a href=\"timberling\"&gt;timberling&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"thistleshrub\"&gt;thistleshrub&lt;/a&gt;s and the conglomerate elemental creatures &lt;a href=\"tar%20beast\"&gt;tar beast&lt;/a&gt;s, while using the same model as bog beasts, are each considered separate types of creatures. Bog beast still remains a broad categorization for the various varieties.\nBog beasts in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; may become &lt;a href=\"Fungal%20horror\"&gt;fungal horrors&lt;/a&gt;."}

When the other members of Clan Ohn'ir were summoned to &lt;a href=\"Ridgewater%20Retreat\"&gt;Ridgewater Retreat&lt;/a&gt; (in reality a trap by &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Nokhud\"&gt;Clan Nokhud&lt;/a&gt;), Boku stayed at &lt;a href=\"Ohn%27ahra\"&gt;Ohn'ahra&lt;/a&gt;'s shrine in Teerakai. With no other mystics available, &lt;a href=\"Khansguard%20Jebotai\"&gt;Khansguard Jebotai&lt;/a&gt; sent &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to ask Boku to commune with Ohn'ahra and obtain her blessing, which was needed for &lt;a href=\"Khanam%20Matra%20Sarest\"&gt;Khanam Matra Sarest&lt;/a&gt; to blow the &lt;a href=\"Horn%20of%20Drusahl\"&gt;Horn of Drusahl&lt;/a&gt;. However, Boku could not hear Ohn'ahra's voice, even after the adventurers helped him use his totems in a ritual, and he concluded that he wasn't suited to be a mystic.\nHe offered to show the adventurers the way to Ridgewater Retreat to find another mystic better suited for the task, but along the way he was ambushed by the Nokhud and only barely escaped to meet up with Tigari and the other mystics who'd survived the ambush at the retreat. Tigari explained that the other Ohn'ir couldn't hear Ohn'ahra either and that Boku's inability to commune with her wasn't his fault. After the adventurers cleaned things up at the retreat, Tigari left to rally the rest of the clan and sent Boku and the adventurers to find Ohn'ahra at &lt;a href=\"Windsong%20Rise\"&gt;Windsong Rise&lt;/a&gt;. Before parting ways, Tigari told Boku that she and the rest of the clan had faith in him.\nAt Windsong Rise, Boku asked the adventurers to free &lt;a href=\"ohuna\"&gt;ohuna&lt;/a&gt; captured by the &lt;a href=\"Primalists\"&gt;Primalists&lt;/a&gt;, use his totems to destroy wagons of &lt;a href=\"dragonkiller%20ballista\"&gt;dragonkiller ballista&lt;/a&gt; bolts, and (though he was reluctant to use violence) kill the Primalists' Nokhud allies. Meanwhile, he went to the top of the rise and found Ohn'ahra held captive by the Primalist leader &lt;a href=\"Koroleth\"&gt;Koroleth&lt;/a&gt;. While the adventurers held off the guards, Boku tried to dispel Koroleth's binding runes to free the Windmother, but Koroleth stopped their efforts by knocking them off the cliff with her magic. Boku was injured in the tumble down the slope and stayed behind to recover while the adventurers went to tell the Khanam Matra what had happened.\nBoku, now no longer using his \"initiate\" title, accompanied the Khanam Matra's army to the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Gardens\"&gt;Emerald Gardens&lt;/a&gt; to aid the &lt;a href=\"green%20dragonflight\"&gt;green dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; against the Primalists. She sent him to scout the area near the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Bough\"&gt;Ancient Bough&lt;/a&gt;, and when adventurers came to collect his report, he told them about the pillars maintaining the Bough's magical defenses."}

As of June 13, 2008, the site has &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.warcraftrealms.com/forum/viewtopic.php%3Ft%3D3819\"&gt;officially gone gold free&lt;/a&gt;.\nSince November 2019, the site since had issues and never really picked up on fixing its interface issues.

Additionally, it has the ability for guilds to enter their guild progression, links to their website, and [recently added] image album.\nOne of the common form of using the website is via the Character History which guilds use to gauge an applicant's playing styles through comparison of how quickly they leveled or seeing how loyal the player is by checking their previous guild history. \nOnce signed up to the website, a player can claim their character and hide their history, in which the message \"The owner of this character has requested that the history be hidden\" will be displayed. Additionally, the profile can display a biography, user submitted images, and recent battlegrounds (via the Killing Fields mod). The Character History does have a comment box in which people can leave messages in regards the player character. These comments can be deleted by the owner once the character has been claimed.\nAnother form of use of the character data is in the form of signature, most commonly used on message boards. These can be made first by claiming your character and then choosing from a wide selection of fonts, font sizes, colors, display options, and even backgrounds. Additional customization can be made by using &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.mysigspace.com\"&gt;MySigSpace.com&lt;/a&gt;, a site run by the same administrator, Rollie, that enables the user to take artistic control of their signature.\nWoW Census.\nThe WoW Census shows the total number of players in each faction, per each race, and per each class who self-report via the &lt;a href=\"CensusPlus\"&gt;CensusPlus&lt;/a&gt; AddOn, which scans players around the mod's player character.

A large war party of orc warriors pass through, with the intention of capturing humans to use as fuel to bring through the rest of the Horde.\nAmong the many fel-corrupted warriors are some who join the party only reluctantly, wishing no part in Gul'dan's dark magic but hoping nonetheless to find a new world. Among them are the warchief of the and his mate, the pregnant . Draka is forced prematurely into labor by the passage through the , but the baby is stillborn. Gul'dan siphons the life of a nearby deer and gives it to the newborn, saving its life but turning its skin green.\nGeneral is visiting the dwarven king when word reaches him of an attack on one of his kingdom's garrisons. Upon returning to , Lothar finds that , a young mage, has been caught by the guards while searching the bodies of the victims. Questioned by Lothar, he explains that something called is at work, but refuses to say more, saying only that the &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Azeroth\"&gt;Guardian of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; must be summoned. Reluctantly Lothar takes Khadgar to meet . At first the king is skeptical, but as reports come in of more attacks on the kingdom's villages, he agrees, and sends Lothar to summon the Guardian.\nTaking Khadgar with him, Lothar and the mage travel on to the home of the Guardian, the magical . After greeting the castellan , Lothar meets with the reclusive , once a close friend but who has withdrawn into seclusion for the last several years. While the two discuss the situation, Khadgar explores the tower's extensive magical libraries. After spotting a strange, ethereal presence, the young mage is guided to a particular volume, and quickly hides it in his cloak before Medivh angrily discovers him. Seeing him as a usurper to his position, Medivh uses magic to pin Khadgar against the wall of the tower, but releases him when the mage mentions the fel. Questioned by Lothar, Medivh reluctantly explains that the fel is a dark and dangerous magic that offers great power, but exacts a terrible price. Accepting that he must indeed attend to the matter personally, Medivh teleports himself, Lothar and Khadgar to the throne room of Stormwind City, where they meet with the king.\nWhile investigating an area corrupted by the fel, Lothar, Medivh, Kadghar and their band of soldiers are ambushed by a group of orcs, quickly overpowering the humans and killing many of their party. Lothar defends his son &lt;a href=\"Callan%20Lothar\"&gt;Callan&lt;/a&gt;, and fights with the warchief , destroying his hand with a dwarven . Recovering from a strange trance, Medivh casts a spell that target the orcs corrupted by the fel magic, killing most of the orcs and leaving only , Blackhand, and &lt;a href=\"Caged%20Frostwolf\"&gt;another&lt;/a&gt; orc, who are still uncorrupted, to flee the scene. As Durotan rides away, he spots Gul'dan's slave , and after a moment's hesitation severs her chain. Garona runs from the orc but is swiftly captured by Khadgar.\nReturning to Stormwind, Lothar, King Llane and the others interrogate Garona, and discovering that she can speak some &lt;a href=\"Common%20%28language%29\"&gt;Common&lt;/a&gt;, having learned it from the humans taken prisoner by the Horde. She explains that the orcs are from another world, now dead, and will soon bring through the entirety of the Horde to take Azeroth as their own. The king promises to protect Garona in exchange for her help in freeing the human prisoners. later visits Garona in her cell, and shows her compassion and kindness, offering to remove her chains and slave collar, and winning a little of her trust.\nBlackhand is punished by Gul'dan for the failure of his raiding party, and sentenced to death. Blackhand accepts the punishment and thrusts his arm into the fel fire, but Durotan steps in, severing his arm and saving his life, blaming the fel for the party's failure. \nDurotan and his second-in-command grow increasingly concerned about the Horde's plans for Azeroth. Realising that the corruption that destroyed their home world is being spread by Gul'dan himself, Durotan decides that the only way to create a future for his family, his clan and the orc people is to overthrow Gul'dan. After Orgrim points out that their clan is too small to do this alone, Durotan proposes an alliance with the humans.\nLothar, Khadgar and Garona travel to the Horde encampment, along the way beginning to bond by the campfire. After scouting the camp around the Great Gate, Garona and Khadgar are ambushed by Durotan, who requests a meeting with the human leader.\nIn Stormwind, King Llane attempts to rally the other kingdoms of Azeroth to assault the orcs, but in-fighting leaves the council divided, with only the forces of Stormwind willing to act. Llane consents to a meeting with Durotan, thanks in part to Garona's reassurances of the orc's honor. Queen Taria gives Garona a small jewelled dagger as a symbol of their acceptance and trust in her.\nReturning from an outing to battle the fel, Medivh is notably weakened by the effort, but is determined to keep fighting. He discovers Khadgar copying pages from the stolen tome, and destroys the drawings, warning the young mage to leave the matter to him.\nThe humans travel to meet with the Frostwolf orcs, and Durotan informs them that Gul'dan will open the Great Gate in two days' time. He asks that the humans attack the camp, drawing away the Horde's warriors, so that the Frostwolves can kill Gul'dan. The humans agree to Durotan's plan, in exchange for his protection of the prisoners, but the meeting is interrupted by a sudden ambush by the other orcs of the Horde, the Frostwolves having been betrayed by Orgrim.\nThe humans and orcs battle. Khadgar saves Garona's life, who in turn saves the king's life. Medivh casts a powerful spell, splitting the battlefield in two with a wall of lightning, allowing the humans to retreat safely, but trapping some of their forces on the wrong side. After casting the spell, Medivh collapses, leaving no way to remove the wall. Among the soldiers trapped on the orcs' side is Lothar's son Callan. Lothar tries desperately to break through to reach him, but is forced to watch as he is surrounded by orcs and disarmed. Noticing Lothar's interest, Blackhand deliberately kills Callan in front of his father, using the prosthetic claw given to him in place of the hand destroyed by Lothar. \nKhadgar and Garona return Medivh to Karazhan. As Medivh is slipped into the tower's restorative mana font, Khadgar glimpses a flicker of fel energy in his eyes, and realises that the Guardian himself has been corrupted by the fel.\nBack at the orc camp, Blackhand seizes Durotan. Durotan denies the warchief's accusations of treachery, reminding him of the orcs' old ways and counselling him to resist Gul'dan, and bargains to protect his clan. Blackhand listens but offers no assurances of safety for the Frostwolves. Durotan names his infant son , before he is led away.\nA revived Medivh awakens to finds himself nursed by Garona. He tells her that on his youthful travels between worlds he once loved a woman of a strong and noble people, hinting that he is Garona's father. Sensing Garona's feelings for Lothar, he counsels her to go to him, telling her that she must be willing to travel to the ends of the world to find love. Medivh teleports Garona to Stormwind, and then collapses. Garona finds Lothar grieving the death of his son, and comforts him.\nOrgrim meets with Gul'dan, and negotiates for the remaining Frostwolves. Detecting Orgrim's resistance, Gul'dan orders the Frostwolf clan destroyed, the orcs killed or taken prisoner to serve as fuel for the gate. Orgrim rushes to save Draka and Go'el, helping them escape the camp.\nKhadgar travels to the floating city of to seek answers to his questions about the Guardian. Guided by his research, he discovers the ancient cube artifact known as , which opens to allow him inside. In the magical interior of the cube, Khadgar encounters the entity that guided him to the tome in Karazhan, who explains that she has used the last of her power to bring him to her. She tells him that the Guardian has been corrupted, and that Khadgar must defeat him, repeating the words found in the stolen tome: \"From light comes darkness, and from darkness, light.\"\nIn Karazhan, Moroes discovers the collapsed Medivh, and helps him to the mana font. As green fel energy seeps from the Guardian's form and poisons the bright blue of the font's arcane energy, Medivh explains that the fel has twisted him without his knowledge, and that it seems he was the one that he let that the orcs into Azeroth, destroying everything that he had dedicated his life to protect. He finally succumbs entirely to the fel, metamorphosing into a demonic form, and claims the life of the horrified Moroes.\nIn Stormwind's war room, as Lothar counsels the king to send all of the army's legions to wipe out the Horde before they can reopen the Great Gate, a restored Medivh appears, and encourages a more cautious approach, taking only three of Stormwind's twenty-eight remaining legions to the gate. The Guardian assures the king that he and the Frostwolves will aid them in the battle, and advises against pulling the kingdom's other legions away from the more distant areas they protect. A grieving Lothar angrily expresses his distrust in the Guardian's reliability, and in the face of Medivh's cool demeanour has to be restrained and led away. \nAs the king and his forces ride out of the city, Khadgar frees Lothar from his cell by transforming the guard into a &lt;a href=\"Polymorph\"&gt;sheep&lt;/a&gt;. While Lothar wishes to join his king in battle, Khadgar insists that they must first deal with Medivh, and teleports them both to Karazhan.\nAn escaped Draka finds her way to a river, where she places her infant son in a basket, sending him to safety along the water. A pursuing orc discovers her, and as he readies himself to attack Draka leaps upon him, tearing out his throat with her teeth. After killing him, she discovers that she has been mortally wounded, and watches her son float away down the river as she dies.\nHaving been freed from his imprisonment by a penitent Orgrim, Durotan confronts Gul'dan in front of the Horde, challenging him to a . Blackhand offers to kill the outcast, but Gul'dan accepts the challenge. Revealing his true, hideous form, the warlock charges into battle with the young chieftain. \nAt the same time, Khadgar and Lothar arrive in Karazhan, and find a demonic Medivh casting the incantation to open the Great Gate to Draenor. Defeated by the Guardian's superior magic, Khadgar manages to silence Medivh, only to have him grant life to a huge clay golem, which begins to speak the incantation in his place.\nBack in the orc camp, Gul'dan and Durotan continue their battle. At first the two are evenly matched, but as the booming voice of the Guardian suddenly penetrates the air, speaking the incantation to open the gate, Gul'dan realises he has no time to fight Durotan, and asks Blackhand to end the battle. Blackhand refuses to intervene, insisting that the mak'gora be honored. Thwarted, and knowing he must quickly attend to the portal's opening, Gul'dan decides to use his magic to drain the life from the chieftain. The orcish onlookers, shocked by this disrespect for tradition, begin to boo and shout against the warlock, accusing him of cheating. Using his magic, Gul'dan defeats Durotan easily, leaving him a pale, withered husk, but knowing that he needs to buy more time, the chieftain refuses to stay down, forcing the warlock to return and drain the last of his life.\nAs the crowd rail against the warlock, Orgrim takes up the cry against Gul'dan, and others begin to follow suit. Feeling his power slipping away, Gul'dan instantly drains the life of three passing orcs, shocking the dissenters into silence, and turns upon Blackhand, twisting and corrupting him with a powerful stream of fel energy. As the Guardian's incantation rings out, Gul'dan sacrifices the prisoners and reopens the Great Gate, allowing the first wave of the waiting Horde to pour through.\nThe Stormwind army, led by Llane and Garona, reach the outskirts of the orc camp, and find the Frostwolves impaled and strung up. Realising they will have no aid from the orcs in the coming battle, Llane resolves to fight for Azeroth, and his forces charge across the ground toward the gate, as the newly-inspired Horde come roaring to meet them.\nIn Karazhan, Lothar struggles with the golem, and manages to silence it by slicing off the soft clay of its head. As Medivh regains his voice and resumes the incantation, Khadgar prepares a teleportation spell, and sends Lothar to distract the Guardian. Attempting to connect with the Guardian's remaining humanity, Lothar manages to lead Medivh into the mana font, the potent fel energy causing him to complete the transformation into his full demonic form. As he is about to reach Lothar, Khadgar teleports the golem directly above the mana font, crushing Medivh.\nAs Khadgar reaches down to Medivh, the fel spreads to him, overcoming him in moments and turning his eyes a bright green. Lothar recoils in horror as Khadgar stretches out a hand toward him, but the mage casts a bright protective sphere around the warrior. Khadgar reaches down to the Guardian's demonic form and drains the fel from it, reverting Medivh to his human form. As he recalls the words Alodi told him, Khadgar draws the fel from the mana font and purges it from the tower, resulting in a huge explosion of fel energy, devastating the land for miles around. \nAfter telling Khadgar he is proud of him, a relieved Lothar takes a gryphon to join the battle at the gate. Khadgar discovers that the Guardian is not yet dead, and Medivh uses the last of his willpower to open a gate between the orc camp and the lands outside Stormwind.\nThe orcs and humans clash, with the dwarven boomsticks proving highly effective against the orcs, but the humans are still hopelessly outnumbered. Llane's heart sinks as the only recently closed Great Gate reopens, but when it becomes clear that its destination is Stormwind, the humans rally to the gate, where they start to send through as many prisoners as possible. Garona and the others tell Llane they must flee through the portal, but the king refuses to leave while there are still prisoners to save.\nIn Karazhan, a dying Medivh explains to Khadgar that it was the loneliness imposed by his role as Guardian that made him weak to the fel. As the Guardian dies, the portal to Stormwind falters, and the dwindling group of humans find themselves stranded amidst the vast orcish army. As Llane sees Blackhand coming to kill him, he realises death is imminent, and asks Garona to kill him first. Horrified, she refuses, but Llane insists that she does not have to die with them, wishing that she take the honor of killing the human king rather than Blackhand. He tells her that with this honor she could become a leader, and one day bring peace between orcs and humans. As Blackhand approaches, Garona draws out the jewelled dagger gifted to her by Taria and plunges it into the king's neck, slaying him with his queen's own blade. \nWith the king dead, the remaining humans are quickly killed, and Garona is carried atop the orcish crowd in honor. Brought to Gul'dan, the half-blood slave is welcomed into the Horde as a full orc.\nRiding upon his gryphon, Lothar swoops down upon the celebrating orcs. Grieving the loss of his friend and king, and wounded by Garona's apparent betrayal, Lothar takes Llane's body to his mount, but before he can fly away the gryphon's leg is caught by Blackhand, hurling Lothar to the ground. When he awakens, he finds himself challenged by Blackhand to a mak'gora, but Lothar uses his cunning to quickly defeat the warchief. Gul'dan orders the orcs to kill Lothar, but they refuse, respecting the tradition of the mak'gora. Honoring Lothar's victory, they allow him to leave with Llane's body. Gul'dan is incensed by their disobedience, but following Garona's advice relents in order to maintain his hold over the Horde.\nIn Stormwind, the king's funeral is attended by leaders from across the Seven Kingdoms, including dwarves, elves and the .

Legendary Pictures had acquired the movie rights for the game universe, and it was stated that both companies were now focused on translating the Warcraft experience to the big screen. Further details about the movie were revealed at &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon%202007\"&gt;BlizzCon 2007&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn 22 July 2009, Blizzard Entertainment announced that &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.imdb.com/name/nm0000600/\"&gt;Sam Raimi&lt;/a&gt; would become the Warcraft movie director. Sam Raimi was the famed director for the blockbuster &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.imdb.com/title/tt0145487/\"&gt;\"Spider-Man\"&lt;/a&gt; series, and had generated 5 Academy Awards nominations in his career at that point. Raimi also wrote and directed the cult classic &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.imdb.com/title/tt0083907/\"&gt;\"The Evil Dead\"&lt;/a&gt; and its two sequels, produced &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.imdb.com/title/tt0389722/\"&gt;\"30 Days of Night\"&lt;/a&gt;, and wrote and directed the thriller &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.imdb.com/title/tt1127180/\"&gt;\"Drag Me To Hell\"&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to film, Raimi's television credits included producing such fantasy series as &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.imdb.com/title/tt0112230/\"&gt;\"Xena: Warrior Princess\"&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.imdb.com/title/tt0111999/\"&gt;\"Hercules: The Legendary Journeys\"&lt;/a&gt;. The live-action film was set for release in 2009, but was later rescheduled to 2011. \n attempted to apply for the job of director, from which Blizzard CEO &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Sams\"&gt;Paul Sams&lt;/a&gt; replied \"We will not sell the movie rights, not to you\u2026especially not to you.\"\nIMDB stated that the manuscript writer would be &lt;a href=\"Chris%20Metzen\"&gt;Chris Metzen&lt;/a&gt;. (&lt;a href=\"http%3A//imdb.com/name/nm0927889/\"&gt;Jesse Wigutow&lt;/a&gt; was mentioned, but had been removed). \"IMDB information on pre-release movies should be taken as suspect, though. IMDB generally only removes false information if someone reports it.\" Mike Morhaime stated in February 2009 that there was a draft script. Chris Metzen mentioned that the film would be action-packed and violent, stating \"We're definitely not going to make a G or a PG version of this. It's not PillowfightCraft.\"\nDuring &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon%202010\"&gt;BlizzCon 2010&lt;/a&gt;, Chris Metzen said that they had the story ready, that Raimi and his team had agreed to it and that Blizzard was just \"waiting for the big green light in the sky\". &lt;a href=\"Nethaera\"&gt;Nethaera&lt;/a&gt; said in March 2012 that \"It's still on the radar. We just don't have any current updates to provide.\"\nDuring Comic Con 2012 Sam Raimi confirmed that he would not be directing the Warcraft film, due to his unavailability. \"Actually, they don't have me directing World of Warcraft anymore because when I took the Oz job, they had to move on to another director,\" Raimi said. \"They had to start making it.\" Later Raimi explained that he and Robert Rodat were working on the script for a long time. He read a screenplay written by Blizzard, and it didn't quite work for him. Raimi told them he wanted to make his original story with Robert, so they pitched it to Legendary and they accepted it, and then they pitched it to Blizzard, and they had reservations, but they accepted it. After Robert wrote the screenplay, they realized that Blizzard had veto power. Blizzard didn't approve this story, and they wanted to go a different way.\nOn 2 August 2012 the studio announced that they had hired writer &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.imdb.com/name/nm0495378/\"&gt;Charles Leavitt&lt;/a&gt; to pen the screenplay. Leavitt had already written one fantasy film for Legendary, \"The Seventh Son\", then due for release in October 2013. Meanwhile, Activision Blizzard President Bobby Kotick, who had thus far been hesitant about adapting his company's games into movies, issued a statement saying that if it's \"important to Blizzard, it's important to me. They're very excited about having a \"World of Warcraft\" film,\" Kotick told \"Variety\", continuing, \"They've been very careful and thoughtful about the development process... I just think [Legendary founder and CEO] Thomas Tull has such a great track record. If there's someone we want to do business with, he's at the top of the list.\"\nOn 30 January 2013, &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.imdb.com/name/nm1512910/\"&gt;Duncan Jones&lt;/a&gt;\u2014director of \"&lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.imdb.com/title/tt0945513/\"&gt;Source Code&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"Moon\"\u2014was announced as the new director. Jones had not been approached by the developers, but as a fan of the franchise had actually \"reached out\" to them after hearing of Raimi's departure. Jones pitched his fresh take on the film, which was well received, and he was brought on board as the new director.\nDue to his past experience with the source material, Jones says that he was able to approach the film \"almost purely as a filmmaker\", focusing on how to make it work as a film, stating that he already felt like he was \"deeply surrounded [by] and understood the material enough that when I made a movie, it would feel right for fans.\"\nIn May 2013 producer Charles Roven told \"Slash Film\" that \"Warcraft\" was planned to shoot in early 2014. \"First quarter 2014 we're going to shoot that movie.\"\nLegendary Pictures and Warner Bros ended their partnership on 24 June 2013, but the film was not expected to suffer delays from the situation. Thomas Tull, CEO of Legendary and producer of the movie, mentioned on 1 July 2013 that the script was not finished yet, because they \"absolutely don't want to screw it up\", a reference to that most movies based on video games have poor reviews. \nA teaser for the film was shown at San Diego Comic-Con on 20 July 2013. In August 2013, it was announced that Legendary Pictures would present the film to Universal Studios in the upcoming months. It would be up to Universal whether the film would be distributed. It was announced later in the month that filming would begin in January of the following year. Much of the film's production was to take place in Vancouver.\nCasting started in late September 2013, with and offered lead roles, and with &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.imdb.com/name/nm0200452/\"&gt;Paul Dano&lt;/a&gt;, , , and in talks for other roles.\nOn 1 October 2013 a release date for the movie was announced: 18 December 2015. However, by 2014 this had been scrapped due to conflicts with \"\", and the film was moved to a March 11, 2016 release. In April 2015 this was in turn cancelled due to further challenging scheduling, with the film finally being released in May (international)/June (US) 2016.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon%202013\"&gt;BlizzCon 2013&lt;/a&gt; concept artwork of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; was shown, implying they would all may make at least some sort of appearance. &lt;a href=\"Lion%27s%20Pride%20Inn\"&gt;Lion's Pride Inn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Elwynn%20Forest\"&gt;Elwynn Forest&lt;/a&gt; will appear. A piece of concept art depicting the construction of the in the wastes of &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Tanaan&lt;/a&gt; was later given to a fan at San Diego Comic Con 2014.\nChris Metzen compared the film to Marvel Comics' Ultimate line, in that the broad story was what fans know and love but the details were different (the Ultimate line comics have their own canon independent of the core Marvel universe) so therefore the film continuity (the film and its literature) is separate. \nOn 9 November 2013, during the 2nd day of &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon%202013\"&gt;BlizzCon 2013&lt;/a&gt; there was a full hour panel featuring director Duncan Jones along with &lt;a href=\"Chris%20Metzen\"&gt;Chris Metzen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rob%20Pardo\"&gt;Rob Pardo&lt;/a&gt; about the movie. \nOn 4 December 2013, Legendary Pictures made a cast reveal: Ben Foster, Travis Fimmel, Paula Patton, Toby Kebbell and Robert Kazinsky would star in the movie. On 19 December 2013, it was revealed that Daniel Wu and Clancy Brown would join the cast.\nPlot development.\nEarly development.\nThe film was originally set in the era of \"\". This was scrapped, however, as there were notions that it would be too similar to \"Lord of the Rings\" and that \"Warcraft\" had reached its current level of popularity through its &lt;a href=\"MMORPG\"&gt;MMORPG&lt;/a&gt;, rather than the previous &lt;a href=\"Real-time%20strategy\"&gt;RTS&lt;/a&gt; games.\nThe movie was later said to be set one year prior to \"World of Warcraft\", primarily told from the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;'s point of view. Characters such as &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; would be likely to make appearances. At BlizzCon 2007, Chris Metzen said that the main character was set to be a new hero described as a \"kick-ass Human\" and an \"Anti-Thrall\", but not Varian Wrynn.&lt;br&gt; Metzen also stated clearly that lore would be bent for the sake of the film.\nConcept art of &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt; was released in relation to the film, hinting that at least some of the film takes place there, and perhaps by extension, in &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the departure of Raimi in 2013, new director Jones presented a new take on the film, its storyline and characters. Jones states that \"From the moment I first talked to Blizzard, the plan was to start our film with the first time Orcs met Humans\", saying that he felt it a wise choice for \"a world with so much newness to explain\", especially with so many viewers likely having no prior knowledge of the franchise.\nJones would later explain that he tackled the pre-existing Charles Leavitt script, making \"an aggressive polish with structural changes, to put more emphasis onto the orc characters\" in order to be more true to Warcraft's roots. As a result a one-sided battle against the orcs was replaced with a more even-handed approach, later described as a war story, but one told from the viewpoints of both sides.\nBlizzCon 2013.\n&lt;a href=\"BlizzCon%202013\"&gt;BlizzCon 2013&lt;/a&gt; featured an entire panel on the movie. They revealed that the story was going to be around the time of \"\", and that the focus was going to be on &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Durotan\"&gt;Durotan&lt;/a&gt;, as they felt it was important to portray both the Alliance and Horde. The two were chosen because they both represent the ideals of their races. Concept art was shown of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;.\nBlizzCon 2014.\n&lt;a href=\"BlizzCon%202014\"&gt;BlizzCon 2014&lt;/a&gt; featured a movie panel. It was stated that the film had been moved from the \"World of Warcraft\" timeframe to that of the first game, due to the abundance of storylines and characters in the former, and how difficult it would be to translate them into film format.\nProduction.\nThe June to November period of 2013 was focused on pre-production. Half the cast is live-action actors and the other half are motion-capture technology based actors. Real costumes will be crafted for the actors performing with motion-capture technology to have photographic references for the animations. Physical props will be used in the case of Elwynn Forest and the weapons used by human characters. Duncan Jones has likened the film's use of CGI as being \"somewhere between ', ' and \"\".\nProduction of the film was documented as it progressed, eventually culminating in the behind the scenes book \"Warcraft: Behind the Dark Portal\".\nThe music of the film is designed to be true to the game series' soundtracks.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Orcish%20%28language%29\"&gt;Orcish&lt;/a&gt; language was developed for the movie by a linguist who also worked on the \"\" film trilogy and \"Avatar\".\nPost-production was handled by &lt;a href=\"http%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Light_%2526_Magic\"&gt;Industrial Light and Magic&lt;/a&gt;. At the start of post-production, ILM had to work on over 1000 visual effects. By May 2015, 50 remained.\nThe decision was made fairly early on to have the orcs rendered purely through CGI. After discussing the role the orcs would play in the film with VFX supervisor Bill Westenhofer, Jones went to speak with ILM, one of the only studios considered capable of producing the high level of detail required for the orcs' extended close ups and convincing character depictions. At ILM Jones met with Jeff White and Jason Smith who introduced him to \"the next generation of facial capture technology\", which Jones immediately realised met the film's needs exceptionally well. Jones was further reassured by the fact that Westenhofer, White and Smith were all \"Warcraft\" fans, making the team \"a perfect fit\".\nDescribing himself as having played the game \"addictively\" since its original beta, Westenhofer's experience as a \"World of Warcraft\" player in combination with his technical abilities led to him becoming the technical advisor for the game's authenticity. Westenhofer states, \"Whenever we needed to talk about something I could log on and show Duncan and say, 'Well, here\u2019s what Stormwind looks like in the game,' for example.\" \nBecause the CGI orcs were not added until post-production, the actors had to act their combat scenes against stuntmen. With the orcs in the film ranging from around 6'6 to 7'2, Jones specifically recruited \"giant\" stuntmen to stand in for the massive orcs, providing the actors with \"intimidating\" opponents during their scenes. In some cases even the giant stuntmen were not tall enough, and it was necessary to put an eyeline target on top of a stuntman's helmet.\nWeta Workshop carried out work on physical props and costumes for the film. 84 full suits of armor were produced for Stormwind's royal guard, along with hundreds of weapons and shields. Specific pieces of armor and weapons were created for major characters, including King Llane. The weapons were created through a combination of steel and lightweight materials. The armor was designed based on artwork received from Blizzard, and rendered via 3D modeling.\nBlizzard artists, such as &lt;a href=\"Wei%20Wang\"&gt;Wei Wang&lt;/a&gt;, contributed over 4,000 art pieces for the film. Collaboration existed, in that ILM took photos and scans of the actors playing orcs, and forwarded them onto Blizzard. Blizzard provided concept art based on these images as to how the orcs should look. The concept art subsequently formed the basis of the 3D effects.\n\"Warcraft\" was by far Jones' highest-budget film to date, with its $160M budget dwarfing the $28M budget for \"Source Code\" and the $5M budget for \"Moon\".\nFuture productions.\nIn 2013 the producers shared hopes for a TV series in the same vein as \"\" if the film was successful.\nThe producers stated in 2015 that if the film was a success they would be excited to continue the story. A trilogy hasn't been ruled out. Metzen has teased many trilogies if they put their mind to it. Jones has mentioned the possibility of an additional two films as well. \nIn 2016 Jones stated that he and Metzen had \"discussed in very loose term what the trilogy will be\", but reiterated that the possibility of sequels would depend on the film's success.\nWhile a sequel is not confirmed, Jones recently shared some insight into what the movie's story might cover. In other tweets, he said a Doomplate for the character was planned for sequel. He added: \"With the orcs now in Azeroth, they learn about armor making in this new world.\" Jones went on to say: \"\"Warcraft 2\" would have seen LAND in the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac Mountains&lt;/a&gt; and magic proliferate as Kirin Tor try to be more open after death of .\" The main orc focus would have been 's imprisonment and violent bid for freedom. Go'el would have met a &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; who tells him of another &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;land to the west&lt;/a&gt; where his people come from, &amp; where he might find allies &amp; maybe a new home. The third film would have depicted the freeing of the orcs across the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;, before a dangerous trip across the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt; to Kalimdor, depicting the founding of &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;. In Jones's words, the trilogy would be based around Durotan's promise to give his people a new home.\nAs of December 15, 2017 a sequel now seems unlikely, as Jones blamed the US box office when saying he could have had \"so much fun\" with a sequel.\nLore differences.\nWhile firmly set in the \"Warcraft\" universe in the period of the opening of the Dark Portal, the film deviates from official lore in numerous areas, some critical. For lore purposes the film is considered to take place in its own version of the Warcraft universe, closely related to the one seen in the games and other canon sources, but with a number of differences.\nFor a list and discussion of the differences between the film universe and the main universe, see &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20film%20universe\"&gt;\"Warcraft\" film universe&lt;/a&gt;. For a list of differences between the film and its , see .\nWhen asked by a fan about the interesting parts of the First War that were left out (such as the sacking of Stormwind and Khadgar being aged), Jones answered that everything that might have made the movie better went through several producers, years of starts, stops, rethinks and restarts before eventually not making it to the screen. He described the experience as fighting a war and the film as being the sum of the victories he won.\nReception.\n\"Warcraft\" opened to highly negative critical reviews. While a few critics praised the film for its depth and emotional engagement, most panned the film for a number of reasons, ranging from excessive detail, a rushed pace, and too many characters, to negative comparisons with \"Lord of the Rings\" and \"Game of Thrones\". The film was widely criticised as another example of a failed attempt at a video game-inspired movie, with little appeal except to fans, although some reviewers suggested even fans of the series would be disappointed by the offering. The film holds a critics rating of 29% on Rotten Tomatoes, up from a one-time low of 16%, while Metacritic's weighted assessment of critical opinion gives the film 32/100, indicating \"Generally Unfavorable Reviews\".\nIn contrast, the film's initial box office performances were highly successful, opening in the #1 slot in 19 of 20 territories during its opening weekend, and in 45 out of 51 territories as of its third week. Ratings from cinema-goers were also far more favourable than those from critics. IMDB reports a 7.1/10 score, based on over 140,000 viewer ratings, Rotten Tomatoes' audience rating gives the film 75% approval, based on over 50,000 viewers, and the Chinese online review site Douban lists an average 7.8/10 score, based on more than 145,000 viewer ratings. Offline, CinemaScore's opening night exit polls reported a B+ score for the film in the US, while PostTrak's audience polls from the US opening reported a 78% positive result, with 56% \"definite thumbs up\". Audience ratings have cooled as scores from non-fans watered down the initially fan-dominated numbers, but remain notably at odds with critical opinion.\nThe film's performance in international markets was strong, with sales reaching more than $160M (excluding China) by the end of the film's box office run. The film found its strongest opening weekend reception in Russia and Germany, followed by France, and set records in some European countries. Coming three weeks later, US performance was widely predicted to be a flop (due in part to stiff competition), and despite a second place opening weekend earned only $47M in cinemas, adding up to a very poor American outing. The film performed extremely well in China. Ticket presales had already amounted to nearly $21M two days before the film's release, with its first two days of screenings amounting to $92M in ticket sales, making it the first film ever to gross RMB 300M two days in a row, as well as the fastest international film to top RMB 900M (stealing both records from \"Furious 7\"). The film dominated with 81% of the market on its second day, showing on 67.5% of all movie screens across China, and also broke records for the the fasted film to earn RMB 1B, the biggest weekend for an international film, biggest Thursday box office numbers of all time, and several records for IMAX including the biggest presales ($8.2M), midnight run ($1.4M) and opening day gross ($5.3M). It claimed only the second biggest midnight and one-day totals, behind \"Furious 7\", although it broke the record for the biggest non-weekend opening day (\"Furious 7\" having opened on a Sunday). The film's five-day opening run in China took around $156M.\nThe film's global box office total stands at $433M, with around $47M from the US, $221M from China, and $165M from other international territories, making a 51% contribution from China, and just less than an 11% contribution from the US market. The film's DVD release starting in September may add to its overall earnings. The film had a budget of $160M and press and marketing outlay of $110M, but due to the nature of the film industry, is estimated to require $450-500M in order to break even. A net loss of $15-40M is predicted, although some sources say the deficit will be smaller, due to special arrangements in China for merchandising and digital rights. The film was the ninth highest-grossing film of 2016 following its worldwide release in mid-June 2016, but by July had been pushed down to tenth place by a soaring \"Finding Dory\". The film has stolen the title of most successful video game film of all time, with the previous record holder, \"Prince of Persia\", standing at only $336M. It is also the first film based on a video game ever to reach a global total of $400M, and only the third video game film (just behind the almost simultaneously-released \"The Angry Birds Movie\") to break $300M. Overall the film achieved unprecedented box office success for a video game movie, but only moderate success in the larger scale, and failed to recoup its substantial outlay.\nTwo months after the end of its cinema run, the film began a staggered global release on DVD and Blu-ray. In the US, the film topped both the Blu-ray and combined DVD/Blu-ray charts for the week of its release. The proportion of Blu-ray sales in the opening week were high, with 72% of US customers choosing the format, while other titles debuting that week saw only around 40% Blu-ray sales.\nThe film's success in China is believed to be due in part to the strong popularity of the \"Warcraft\" franchise in the country, which is estimated to be home to half of all \"World of Warcraft\" players in the world. As a result China was predicted to be a key market in determining the commercial success or failure of the film, and therefore the likelihood of a sequel being produced. The unprecedented disparity between the film's US and Chinese success has inspired widespread commentary about the developing balance of power in cinema, with some stating that \"Warcraft\" could be the film that proves the validity of aiming for success in China over success in the US, currently still the world's biggest cinema market. Some commentators have even speculated about the possibility of a sequel not even releasing in the US, instead focusing on China and international markets. \"Warcraft\" has been widely compared to \"Pacific Rim\", which also saw a very strong response in China, and thus managed to secure a sequel, despite its failure in the US. Despite this, in December 15, 2017, Jones blamed the US box office when saying he could have had \"so much fun\" with a sequel, implying there would be none.\nPremiere.\nThe film's global premiere was held 6 June, 2016, at The Chinese Theatre in Hollywood, four days before the release of the film in the US. The event was streamed on the official Twitch channel, where it was presented by &lt;a href=\"https%3A//twitter.com/michelemorrow\"&gt;Michele Morrow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"https%3A//twitter.com/JesseCox\"&gt;Jesse Cox&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe premiere was attended by numerous cast members and crew including Toby Kebbel, Paula Patton, Rob Kazinsky, Ben Schnetzer, Daniel Wu, Clancy Brown and Duncan Jones. Numerous Blizzard personnel were invited to the screening, including \"Warcraft\" developers such as &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Morhaime\"&gt;Mike Morhaime&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ion%20Hazzikostas\"&gt;Ion Hazzikostas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"J.%20Allen%20Brack\"&gt;J. Allen Brack&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tom%20Chilton\"&gt;Tom Chilton&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rob%20Pardo\"&gt;Rob Pardo&lt;/a&gt;, and those from other games such as \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\"'s . Several noted \"Warcraft\" streamers and fansite personnel were also invited, including &lt;a href=\"https%3A//twitter.com/BajheeraWoW\"&gt;Bajheera&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https%3A//twitter.com/perculia\"&gt;Perculia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"https%3A//twitter.com/tradechat\"&gt;TradeChat&lt;/a&gt;. An unexpected addition was the actress and her son Tom, who cosplayed as an orc shaman and warrior, respectively, as well as Ben Schulz, better known as &lt;a href=\"Leeroy%20Jenkins\"&gt;Leeroy Jenkins&lt;/a&gt;.\nAn official highlight selection from the premiere stream can be found &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D1FLpryAX8YY\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.\nBlizzard screenings.\nWhile only limited numbers of Blizzard employees were invited to the official premiere, an \"exclusive employee screening\" was held on 8 June, at the Irvine Spectrum Theatre, which director Duncan Jones also attended.\nPromotions.\nFree game and game time.\nPurchasing a ticket for the film at certain cinemas in certain countries will grant a free digital copy of \"World of Warcraft\", and in many cases an additional 30 days of game time. Those purchasing the tickets are given a card with a code which can be redeemed on the official site to unlock the free copy. These promotions are time-limited.\nCountries with cinemas participating in the promotion include the United States, Brazil, Australia and New Zealand, Belgium, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Romania, Serbia, Slovenia, Spain, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore and Thailand.\nIn-game items.\nPlayers logging in to the game between 24 May and 1 August, 2016 will be awarded four unique transmogrification items depicting gear from the film. Each item is restricted by both faction and race. Alliance characters can use the &lt;a href=\"Replica%20Lion%27s%20Fang\"&gt;Replica Lion's Fang&lt;/a&gt; (sword) and &lt;a href=\"Replica%20Lion%27s%20Heart\"&gt;Replica Lion's Heart&lt;/a&gt; (shield), while Horde characters can use the &lt;a href=\"Replica%20Blood%20Guard%27s%20Cleaver\"&gt;Replica Blood Guard's Cleaver&lt;/a&gt; (axe) and &lt;a href=\"Replica%20Staff%20of%20Gul%27dan\"&gt;Replica Staff of Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; (staff). \nLion's Fang depicts 's &lt;a href=\"Dragonsword\"&gt;Dragonsword&lt;/a&gt;, while Blood Guard's Cleaver depicts 's , and the Staff of Gul'dan of course depicts 's staff.\nThe items corresponding to the current faction will be mailed to the first Alliance and Horde characters to log on for each account, contained in the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Strongbox\"&gt;Alliance Strongbox&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Strongbox\"&gt;Horde Strongbox&lt;/a&gt;, respectively. \nLogging in during this period will also earn the &lt;a href=\"Fight%20for%20the%20Alliance\"&gt;Fight for the Alliance&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Fight%20for%20the%20Horde\"&gt;Fight for the Horde&lt;/a&gt; achievements.\nSequel.\nJones originally hoped to direct one or more sequels to the film, having already discussed future storylines and a possible trilogy with Chris Metzen, but said this would depend on how well the film performed. In June 2020, Jones elaborated that he had planned for a trilogy of films telling one cohesive story, after which he would have handed the reins to someone else to adapt other, better known parts of \"Warcraft\" lore.\nIn January 2017, Jones tweeted that he \"truly [didn't] know\" about the chance for a sequel to happen, and that it was not up to him, but to Legendary. In July 2018, Jones apologized and stated that he was afraid a sequel to the film was not likely, with notably too many companies involved to \"thread that needle\". Ultimately, \"Warcraft\" struggled because it had too many storylines and tried to serve too many threads at once. In June 2020, Jones stated that he had \"no idea\" if a sequel would be made and added that no one he worked with on the film even worked at Blizzard anymore.\nA second movie would have focused on 's imprisonment in &lt;a href=\"Aedelas%20Blackmoore\"&gt;Blackmoore&lt;/a&gt;'s gladiator camp and his violent bid for freedom for the orc side of the story. In the camp, Go'el would have befriended a &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; who'd tell him of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;a land to the west&lt;/a&gt; where Go'el might find allies and a new home. (In June 2016, Jones tweeted that he was \"desperate to do taurens\" if he got the chance.) The second film would also have featured Orgrim wearing the Doomplate armor, with the orcs learning to make armor in the new world of Azeroth. The Alliance focus meanwhile would have included, among other things, Khadgar \"unleashing Pandora's Box\", a Lothar arc, and Varian. The flying city of Dalaran would have landed in the Alterac Mountains, and magic would've proliferated as the Kirin Tor tried to be more open after the death of King Llane.\nThe third and final film would've seen Go'el gathering the Horde and freeing orcs around the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; before making the dangerous trip across the sea to &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; and founding &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;. In essence, the trilogy would revolve around the fulfilling of Durotan's promise to give his people a new home.\nBlizzard still holds the licence to the IP. As of November 2018, they have had conversations with Legendary, and are still trying to figure out what's best for the franchise, whether it's something episodic, a theatrical movie, a feature film, or anything else.\nDevelopment on a sequel titled \"Warcraft 2\" began in 2019. It would've brought back characters from the first film and introduce new ones. However, the Covid-19 pandemic began just as early development began. Stars who were attached to the project dropped out, and filmmakers were eyed, but were ultimately unavailable. As the project fell apart, discussions began internally about whether the studio and Blizzard wanted to reboot the franchise or continue with the established characters, actors, and lore from the first movie. As of 2022, sources indicate that Legendary decided to go with a soft reboot; still in continuity with the first film, but focusing on a new set of characters. Characters from the first film may feature, but will be older (for instance, a much older Go'el, now named Thrall).\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

It was published by &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Star%20Books\"&gt;Pocket Star Books&lt;/a&gt; on October 24, 2006.\nDescription.\nIn the mist-shrouded haze of past, the world of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; teemed with wonders of every kind. Magical races and ancient beasts strode alongside the tribes of man -- until the arrival of the demonic &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; and its baneful lord, &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;. Now &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;s, elves, &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; all vie for supremacy across their scarred, war-torn kingdoms -- all part of a grand, malevolent scheme to determine the fate of the world... of\nWARCRAFT\nDay of the Dragon.\nA terrifying upheaval among the highest ranks of the world's Wizards sends the maverick &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;Mage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt;, on a perilous journey into the &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;-controlled lands of &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;. What Rhonin uncovers is a vast, far-reaching conspiracy, darker than anything he ever imagined\u2014a threat that will force him into a dangerous alliance with ancient creatures of air and fire if the world of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; is to see another dawn.\nLord of the Clans.\nSlave and Gladiator. &lt;a href=\"Shaman\"&gt;Shaman&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt;. The enigmatic &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt; known as &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; has been all of these. Raised from infancy by cruel human masters who sought to mold him into their perfect pawn, Thrall was driven by both the savagery in his heart and the cunning of his upbringing to pursue a destiny he was only beginning to understand\u2014to break his bondage and rediscover the ancient traditions of his people. Now the tumultuous tale of his life's journey\u2014a saga of honor, hatred, and hope\u2014can at last be told.\nThe Last Guardian.\nThe Guardians of Tirisfal were a line of champions imbued with godlike powers, each one through the ages charged with fighting a lonely secret war against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt; was fated from birth to become the greatest and most powerful of this noble order. But from the beginning a darkness tainted him, corrupting his soul and turning to evil the powers that should have fought for good. Medivh's struggle against the malice within him became one with the fate of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; itself...and changed the world forever.\nOf Blood and Honor.\nThe paladin &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt; had always believed the &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;s were vile and corrupt, but an unexpected act of honor and compassion sets in motion a chain of events that will challenge his most fundamental beliefs and force him to decide, once and for all, who are the men... and who are the monsters."}

Most of the information there is about &lt;a href=\"elves\"&gt;elves&lt;/a&gt;.\nSince the release of the first Warcraft game, the lore of the Warcraft universe has been evolving and expanding at an incredible rate. Today, Warcraft lore is spread across four games and three expansions as well as a number of novels, a pen-and-paper roleplaying game, and even a manga series. Now you can find all there is to know about Warcraft in one official source of all things Warcraft: The Warcraft Encyclopedia.

{"id": "635968", "revid": "38791128", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=635968", "title": "Warcraft III/Patch 1.31.0", "text": "Warcraft III patch 1.31.0 is the last major patch for ', prior to '.\nThe patch was deployed on the Public Test Realm on April 24, 2019.\nSpecific Changes &amp; Improvements.\n\"Dev Comment: We've been encountering non-trivial issues connecting players over &lt;a href=\"http%3A//battle.net/\"&gt;Battle.net&lt;/a&gt; as we unify the game client - a prime example being disconnects caused by erroneous matches between Chaos and Throne. Custom maps created with RoC data are still playable, this affects melee only. A major benefit to this change is players who owned Reign of Chaos only now have The Frozen Throne.\"\nWorld Editor Updates.\n(Beta) Added Lua as a supported scripting language. To create a Lua map:\n(Beta) Object modification system API allows new changes to many items, abilities, units and more at run-time.\nBalance Updates.\nOrc.\nBlademaster.\nWindwalk\nCritical Strike\n\"Dev Comment: Reducing Critical Strike's damage sources lowered overall burst, and had the downside of making his stats unclear. The Blademaster was also able to strike and fade away without recourse if Windwalk was activated 5 seconds prior to get attacking. These changes increase the Blademaster's damage, but leaves him vulnerable to counterattack.\"\nTauren.\nPulverize\n\"Dev Comment: Prior changes made the Tauren Totem easier to construct early, but it is still rare to see Tauren on the battlefield. This change is intended to make your first few Tauren more viable to takeover your front line. Reducing the upgrade's lumber cost also helps with the transition. Overall, your upgrade cost is similar to a fully upgraded Knight or Abomination.\"\nSpiked Barricades.\n\"Dev Comment: Spiked Barricades has not had much of a role in high level 1v1 games. Giving the upgrade extra percentage based damage increases the effectiveness against late game units, and reducing upgrade level count should help with it coming online faster. This does make the upgrade more complex, so we look forward to hearing feedback about this direction.\"\nHuman.\nKnight.\nNew Upgrade: Sundering Blades\n\"Dev comment: While the Knight is quite formidable in single combat with other units, we wanted to improve its role vs medium armor further than the default damage bonus of 150%. This allows Knights to be more threatening vs ranged units they chase down, such as Crypt Fiends, and increases their ability to fight against Mountain Giants.\"\nAnimal War Training.\n\"Dev comment: This change is intended to help Human players transition to their Tier 3 units. Increasing base hit points should help reduce the reliance on Animal War Training, and reducing the lumber cost should slightly help the overall transition to these units.\"\nControl Magic.\n\"Dev comment: We had reduced the additional mana cost of this ability to promote its usage, but it ended up inhibiting more strategies than it promoted.\"\nOrb of Fire.\n\"Dev comment: By shifting the Orb of Fire into an anti-healing role, Human players will be better equipped to focus fire enemy units in the late game against powerful healers like the Death Knight. This should benefit late game unit combinations such as Riflemen, casters, and Gryphons. Its effectiveness is not determined by a unit's raw stats, so it should be viable for ranged and melee heroes.\"\nNight Elf.\nDark Ranger.\nLife Drain\n\"Dev comment: Drain Life and Black Arrow didn't synergize. Black Arrow's short debuff meant Drain Life was unlikely to result in a Dark Minion. This change benefits Drain Life by letting it gain the intended effect - but not damage bonus - of Black Arrow.\"\nDemon Hunter.\nMana Burn\n\"Dev Comment: While part of the lower usage of DH is due to the popularity of Keeper, we also agreed with feedback that the increased cost of Mana Burn was a factor.\"\nDruid of the Claw.\nBase Stats\n\"Dev comment: Prior nerfs were in response to feedback that Druids of the Claw were\u2026 overbearing\u2026 at Tier 3. They stopped mauling structures as badly, but their role became fuzzy with the preeminence of Mountain Giants. This is a small change - Night Elf has been doing well at a high level lately - but is intended to sweeten the honey pot when you decide to feed these beasts.\"\nGlaive Thrower.\nVorpal Glaives Upgrade\n\"Dev comment: We were not happy with Vorpal Glaives homing ability always inflicting full damage to the target. The upgrade now increases the Glaive's speed, but returns to having a chance to miss - similar to other siege weapons. This leans into the Glaive Thrower's personality of being a high velocity siege weapon while fixing the bug.\"\nHippogryph Rider.\nBase Stats\n\"Dev comment: The Hippogryph Rider is a merge of both the Hippogryph and Archer, this means they share hit points as well. This should have minimal balance impact beyond making it more consistent with their individual hit points.\"\nKeeper of the Grove.\nBase Stats\nForce of Nature.\n\"Dev Comment: Keeper has become the pick following his buffs in earlier patches. We are dialing him back some to help promote other heroes - as diverse hero options is one of the best ways to mix up gameplay. The night vision reduction reverts an unintended change.\"\nUndead.\nGargoyle.\nBase Stats\n\"Dev Comment: Raising the speed of Gargoyles above ground units allows them to better pick off retreating enemies or intercept reinforcements trickling into the main force. They are still slower than the anti-air units designed to counter them though. Reducing their cost makes them a bit more competitive choice with Crypt Fiends.\"\nNecromancer.\nNew Spell Order\nCripple\nUnholy Frenzy\nSkeletal Mastery\n\"Dev Comment: Currently Necromancers must be produced in large numbers right away in order to summon many skeletons, as their single target spells are locked behind the Necromancer training upgrades. This commitment to Necromancers can be problematic as the opposing player has a large window to scout and prepare. We want to address this by rearranging and revamping the skills of the Necromancer so that producing a few early on can provide value right away while massing them later still lets players summon a large skeleton army.\"\nGhoul Frenzy\n\"Dev Comment: Currently, this upgrade makes Ghouls not quite strong enough to make up for how poorly they trade vs the other race's similarly upgraded units. Increasing the attack bonus by 10% changes a number of unit relations to better favor Ghouls in direct combat. Additionally, the change to Necromancers having Cripple right away should also assist Ghoul effectiveness at Tier 2.\"\n(New Item) Ritual Dagger.\nShop Details\nItem Details\n\"Dev Comment: With this item the Undead race will have access to an early game healing effect outside of the Death Knight. Using in conjunction with Rod of Necromancy or Crypt Lord Beetles gives more viability to creep and fight early game. We added the interrupt from damage to match the intent of a recovery mechanism between fights.\"\nNeutral Units.\nAlchemist.\nHealing Spray\nAcid Bomb\nTransmute\n\"Dev Comment: The Alchemist continued to be too well rounded. Healing Spray's cooldown is now in line with similar abilities - such as Blizzard - and we are reducing some of his early to mid game damage compared to other damage dealer heroes. Reducing Transmute is aimed at late game where it over-performed in teams and FFA.\"\nFirelord.\nSoul Burn\n\"Dev Comment: We are trying out a new direction for Soul Burn. The Firelord had a lot of mana tension between his 3 active abilities. This aims to reduce some of the mana tension so Soul Burn's attack damage reduction and single target silence are more impactful to play.\"\nPandaren Brewmaster.\nBreath of Fire\n\"Dev Comment: The Brewmaster's role as an area of effect damage dealer was overshadowed by other heroes after his previous round of changes. As the main role of the Brewmaster, we wanted to bring the panda-monium back to his kit.\"\nGeneral Items.\nBoots of Speed.\n\"Dev comment: The primary goal here was to prevent network connectivity wars for the first purchase. Moving Boots of Speed out of the default creep drop table is experimental. It's one of the last items that can be bought at the Goblin Merchant and dropped by creeps, and by increasing the starting stock the item should naturally be more available to both players.\"\nCloak of Shadows.\n\"Dev comment: Currently Cloak of Shadows has low desirability among many players. It also is one of the few items that deactivates for portions of the game without player input. Making it usable during the day should give it more flexibility.\"\n\"Crystal Ball\"\n Item level decreased from 5 to 3\n Gold price reduced from 500 to 300\n\"Dev comment: At level 5 the Crystal Ball is noticeably less powerful than the other item drop options. It does provide \u2018free' scouting which may be helpful, but perhaps more helpful in the early game than later on.\"\nPeriapt of Vitality.\n\"Dev comment: The Periapt was the only item in the tier that wasn't 325 gold.\"\nRings of Protection.\n\"Dev comment: We get quite a bit of feedback about the Rings of Protection being under-powered compared to other items in their tier. So we increased the bonus armor they provide by 1. We are removing the highest tier ring as it is often less impactful for heroes who obtain it compared with other options in that tier.\"\nScourge Bone Chimes.\n\"Dev comment: As a baseline, aura items should at least be the same as a level 1 hero ability. Since Devotion Aura and Vampiric Aura were buffed, we are increasing the effect of their respective aura items as well.\"\nSentry Wards.\nDev comment: High level feedback is that while this item's duration is already lower than the Witch Doctor's Sentry Ward already, it still provides too much scouting information overall.\"\nTome of Experience.\n\"Dev comment: Experience comes from the blood of your enemies! We believe one of the core fun parts of Warcraft III melee is the tension between players leveling up their heroes. Tome of Experience changes this by giving the player who finds it a big bump in power but in a way that an opponent cannot prepare for or predict. Since this tome already has reduced effectiveness in late game there was concern that simply reducing its experience amount would make it feel uninteresting late game, while still maintaining its issues early game. So we are going to remove it.\"\nWarsong Battle Drums.\n\"Dev comment: This is currently the only aura item that stacks with a similar aura from one of the playable races. This is a slight nerf to Orc, but it does make the aura items overall more unified and operate without exceptions.\""}

For heroes in general, we're looking at the costs and sometimes the functionality of hero ultimate abilities, to make them a bit more competitive with a hero's base line abilities and mana pool.\nItems are another big area of this patch. Charged levels 5 and 6 are getting a shake-up to see if we can encourage more usage of these categories going forward.\nAdditionally, we want to support map makers' future endeavors by doing a balance pass on the units provided by Mercenary Camps. Finally, in 1v1 matchups, we want to address rifle pushes in Human vs. Night Elf and slightly alter the early game in Human vs. Undead.\nThere will also be a map pool rotation in this patch. One map per game mode will be rotated out and a new one rotated in. This time around, all of the maps are made by our wonderful community map makers.\nMercenary Camp Updates.\nAnother area we want to address within this balance patch is opening up a bit more map design options for our map making community. Mercenary Camps provide a way to both adjust how matchups play out as well as provide extra map variety. However, only the Lordaeron Summer camp has seen widespread use in the competitive scene. We have looked at all of the Mercenary Camps and adjusted their unit offerings to bring them more in line with the Lordaeron Summer mercenary camp, while also offering differing options of units/abilities provided. Additionally, many units had their costs and availability time adjusted. We're trying out having two availability times to unify the Mercenary Camps a bit, by reducing the amount of numbers players have to memorize: short (120 seconds), medium (220 seconds), and long (440 seconds). It's likely that further adjustments to unit offerings or the unit costs/availability will be needed, so we are interested in player and map maker thoughts on these changes."}

Our approach to this patch was to first take a look at various community feedback with the goal of diversifying strategy and reducing frustration. We then watched and read a community posts, and we played a great deal of multiplayer matches on the ladder with player feedback in mind. We then analyzed game data.\nTo find out what ultimately would work, we put many changes into a PTR build as early as possible, and then playtested and calibrated further.\nRegarding the Siege Engine rework, we wished to experiment with giving the unit an alternative role other than merely killing buildings (in 1v1). Ultimately, it ended up overlapping too much with other Human units, and due to the loss of its Fortify armor, became less unique. We may revisit the Siege Engine at another time.\nWe want to thank all the community members who put their time and energy into providing feedback during the PTR. We read your online posts and watched your videos, and found it all very helpful."}

The author of this article claims no right of the material written.\nTranscript.\nAlmost fifteen years have passed since the end of &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;the war&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Human\"&gt;Human&lt;/a&gt;s. An uneasy peace has settled over the land since the drums of war were silenced. But as the human kingdoms rest on their laurels, the Orc clans unite behind a young, &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;visionary leader&lt;/a&gt;.\nA darker shadow also begins to grow, a menace to all life and hope. The drums of war beat again in an ominous crescendo as the hour of chaos inexorably draws near. When &lt;a href=\"Infernal\"&gt;fire rains&lt;/a&gt; from the sky, the world will tremble before the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis summer, &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard Entertainment&lt;/a&gt; will unveil the 3rd chapter in the epic &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20universe\"&gt;\"Warcraft\" saga&lt;/a&gt;: \"\".\nGame Highlights.\nFour unique races, each with its own units, magical powers, and special weapons.\nThe Humans.\n&lt;a href=\"Human\"&gt;Human&lt;/a&gt;s are the youngest race in the \"Warcraft\" universe. Compared to the long lives of &lt;a href=\"Elf\"&gt;Elves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;Dwarves&lt;/a&gt;, the life of a Human is short and hectic. Their short span of existence drives Humans to expend incredible energy building huge empires, developing fabulous technologies, and studying magic, which explains why impressive Human kingdoms develop in such a short periods of time. Humans price honor and virtue, and they seek to protect themselves from the forces of darkness. Supported by the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Divine Light&lt;/a&gt;, Humans endured the most terrible battles against the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Orcish horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe noble warriors of humanity employ both a strong military and powerful magics in the defense of their shining &lt;a href=\"kingdom\"&gt;kingdom&lt;/a&gt;s. Both knights and wizards fight side by side on the field of battle against those who would threaten the sanctity and peace of the Alliance. Although the Alliance has all but fallen apart, the valiant citizens of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28continent%29\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; have once again taken up arms against the enemies of humanity.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Human Alliance&lt;/a&gt; is a conglomeration of Humans, Elves, and Dwarves. They are the most versatile army in \"Warcraft III\", with good ground and air troops, excellent siege capabilities, and powerful spellcasters.\n\"Numerous other units are available from other buildings.\"\nThe Orcs.\nThe savage green-skinned &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;s are one of the most prolific races in the \"Warcraft\" universe. Originally from the infernal world of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, Orcs were introduced into the realm of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; through the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"dimensional%20gateway\"&gt;dimensional gateway&lt;/a&gt;, to wage war against the humans. Orcs are commonly believed to be brutal and stupid, devoid of humanity or any trace of empathy for other races. The Orcs, who once cultivated a quiet &lt;a href=\"Shaman\"&gt;Shaman&lt;/a&gt;istic society on the world of Draenor, were corrupted by chaos magics of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; and formed into a voracious, unstoppable Horde. Lured to the world of Azeroth through a dimensional gateway, the Horde was manipulated into waging war against the Human nations of Azeroth and &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. Recently the Orcs have begun to free themselves from the corruptive, Demonic forces and are prepared to combat the vile Legion with courage and honor. Using the ancient, Shamanistic magics of their rediscovered culture, the powerful warriors of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; will stop at nothing to ensure that they're never used as pawns again.\nThe Horde possesses the game's most powerful ground units, including the savage &lt;a href=\"Grunt%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Grunt&lt;/a&gt; and gargantuan &lt;a href=\"Tauren%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Tauren&lt;/a&gt;. The Orcish Horde has modest air and ranged capabilities, but their true strength lies in their raw melee power. Even the magic of their spellcasters is designed to enhance their frontline troops.\n\"Numerous other units are available from other buildings.\"\nNight Elves.\nThe reclusive &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;Night Elves&lt;/a&gt; were the first race to awaken in the in the \"Warcraft\" universe. These shadowy, immortal beings were the first to study &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; and let it loose throughout the world nearly ten thousand years before . The Night Elves' reckless use of magic drew the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; into the world and led to a catastrophic war between the two titanic races. The Night Elves barely managed to banish the Legion from the world, but their &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor%20%28landmass%29\"&gt;wondrous homeland&lt;/a&gt; was shattered and drowned by the sea. Ever since, the Night Elves refused to use magic for fear that the dreaded Legion would return. The Night Elves closed themselves off from the rest of the world and remained hidden atop their holy &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;mountain of Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; for many thousands of years. As a race, Night Elves are typically honorable and just, but they are very distrusting of the 'lesser races' of the world. They are nocturnal by nature and their shadowy powers often elicit the same distrust that they have for their mortal neighbors.\nThe Night Elves of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; are a mighty race that emphasizes mobility, ranged firepower, and spell-craft. They do not have the brute strength of other races, but their skills with bow and magic more than compensate for this deficiency.\n\"Numerous other units are available from other buildings.\"\nThe Undead.\nThe horrifying Undead army called the Scourge consists of thousands of walking corpses, disembodied spirits, damned mortal men and insidious extra-dimensional entities. The Scourge was created by the Burning Legion for the sole purpose of sowing terror across the world in anticipation of the Legion's inevitable invasion. The Undead are ruled by &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, who lords over the icy realm of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; from his frozen throne. Ner'zhul commands the terrible plague of undeath, which he sends ever southward into the human lands. As the plague encroaches on the southlands, more and more humans fall prey to Ner'zhul's mental control and life-draining sickness every day. In this way, Ner'zhul has swelled the ranks of the already considerable Scourge. The Undead employ necromantic magics and the elemental powers of the cold north against their enemies. The undead are known for their ability to generate units upon the battlefield. This makes them a very persistent force.\nThe Undead Scourge is a well-balanced faction that can field enduring ground forces and pwerful air units. Their spellcasters possess a variety of powerful magics, including the dreaded ability to raise fallen allies and foes alike into an army of walking dead. In this way, the Undead can assemble armies more massive than those of any other race in \"Warcraft III\".\n\"Numerous other units are available from other buildings.\"\nSingle-player Mode.\nThe single-player mode is focused on groups of fearsome warriors supporting mighty, legendary &lt;a href=\"Hero%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Heroes&lt;/a&gt;, each of whom can advance and become more powerful as the game progresses.\nThese Heroes are all that stand between the world of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and oblivion, and the choices that the player makes will change the future of a world.\nFour linked campaigns - featuring the &lt;a href=\"Human\"&gt;Human&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Undead\"&gt;Undead&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;Night Elves&lt;/a&gt; - together form the story of the day the sky rained fire and war once again swept the battered lands of Azeroth. Players first take the role of &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt;, a novice &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt; and crown prince of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, as he investigates an uprising of Orcs and rumors of a plague sweeping the northern end of the kingdom.\nAs the single-player game continues, the story moves on to the other races, with each campaign picking up where the previous one left off. Heroes of the other races make their appearances throughout the campaigns, many times as allies, yet other times as enemies.\n\"Warcraft III\" immerses players in a compelling, dynamic 3D world of incredible depth and detail. Daunting monsters roam a landscape filled with merchant camps, enemy strongholds, and magical fountains, while stunning environmental effects bring the world to life.\nMultiplayer Mode.\nBlizzard will be implementing a vast array of groundbreaking enhancements to &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Battle.net\"&gt;Battle.net&lt;/a&gt; for \"\".

Blizzard's experiments with \"Warcraft III\" even led to &lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft%20evolution%20guide\"&gt;the beginning&lt;/a&gt; of the work on \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\".\n\"Warcraft III\" was the first time that Blizzard made an effort to preserve a game's assets and source code while developing it. Its development team consisted of less than thirty people. Traditional development roles weren't assigned, as various staff members worked on various tasks.\nRole-Playing Strategy to Real-Time Strategy.\n\"Warcraft III\" has roots in two cancelled \"Warcraft\" games\u2014\"\", and \"&lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20Legends%20%28game%29\"&gt;Warcraft Legends&lt;/a&gt;\". In the case of the former, this took the form of bringing &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; over. In the case of the latter, it was the origin of the hero and RPG elements that would be retained in the final version of \"Warcraft III\".\nOriginally, \"Warcraft III\" started out as a game called Heroes of Warcraft. It was a squad-based tactical combat game, thus departing from the type of traditional &lt;a href=\"real-time%20strategy\"&gt;RTS&lt;/a&gt; games that Blizzard had already released earlier for both the \"&lt;a href=\"Warcraft\"&gt;Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"StarCraft\"&gt;StarCraft&lt;/a&gt;\" universes. Eventually, the game morphed into a more traditional RTS, but retained the element of heroes, after a change of team leads halfway through development. The developers who left had the concept of a client-server, online and very instanced game, with an over-the-shoulder camera and full 3D. When &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Morhaime\"&gt;Mike Morhaime&lt;/a&gt; pulled the trigger on that concept and wanted the game to come back to its RTS roots, those developers moved away to create the \"\" franchise instead.\nThe game originally started as a \"Role-Playing Strategy\" experience: a strategy game set heavily within a role-playing environment. It had smaller, potent parties of heroes and troops in a dynamic world of living towns, wandering monsters, characters and quests, with players simultaneously having to devise strategies to defeat their enemies. It had six planned races and a slated release date of \"late 2000\".\nIn this original design, there was no &lt;a href=\"Fog%20of%20War\"&gt;Fog of War&lt;/a&gt; but you couldn't freely move the camera, it could only jump between your &lt;a href=\"Hero%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;heroes&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Rob%20Pardo\"&gt;Rob Pardo&lt;/a&gt; had described it as similar to the , except with multiple heroes. Military units were supposed to be much more micromanaged: you were supposed to use your troll headhunters' tracking ability to find enemies, then root them with your raiders' nets, then use the tauren to initiate combat with a bullrush that stunned, and then finally send your orc grunts with their berserker ability that did high DPS. Each unit had a special ability and the number of units you could control varied depending on the \"Leadership\" stat of your hero, for example if your hero had a Leadership of 8 you could control 8 units. As such, units were referred to as your hero's party.\nThe game originally utilized a realistic art style, which made everything in the game much smaller. The results were received negatively among the development team, so the colors were made simpler, the shading was decreased, flat colors were added, and characters were scaled up and made bigger and bulkier. This made the units easier to read from the top-down camera, and also made everything feel bigger and more heroic. According to art director &lt;a href=\"Samwise%20Didier\"&gt;Samwise Didier&lt;/a&gt;, \"We didn't want to be \"\" or standard fantasy. We wanted our characters to be the superhero versions of fantasy characters, rock stars with battle axes, with each one of our heroes and units looking like they could take on a whole army by themselves.\"\nThe game was not designed with e-sports in mind.\nThere was much discussion as to whether the game needed navies, &lt;a href=\"oil\"&gt;oil&lt;/a&gt;, and water combat; whether the game would build on \"Warcraft II\" in regards to the naval aspect. The team eventually chose not to include naval units in \"Reign of Chaos\" because they couldn't come up with a way to make them feel as unique or interesting as the rest of the game, and they didn't want to include ships just for the sake of including ships. Naval units were later implemented with the release of \"The Frozen Throne\" expansion.\nThe team decided to go all-in on the hero concept, with the concept of a mini-RPG merging with a traditional economy-driven RTS. Unlike \"StarCraft\" and the previous \"Warcraft\" games, \"Warcraft III\" was designed to be \"stack centric\" around hero play. In this sense, the gameplay would reward smaller, more intimate groups of units and their interactions, with less focus on base and mass unit management. The game's upkeep system is reflective of this, where players suffer from resource penalties if their army reaches a certain size. There was much debate about the upkeep system, and &lt;a href=\"Chris%20Sigaty\"&gt;Chris Sigaty&lt;/a&gt; noted that \"the community never really loved it.\" Sigaty defended the upkeep system, however, stating that \"it felt like it was a really good dilemma to put you in as a player.\"\nWeather effects were supposed to happen and have an impact on battles. It's unclear where the idea for the game's day/night cycle originated. According to designer &lt;a href=\"Matthew%20Morris\"&gt;Matthew Morris&lt;/a&gt;, there was another RTS game with a day/night cycle which members of the design group would play, but it was mostly a narrative device championed by the art team. Creating a significant visual difference between day and night while also ensuring that the playfield remained visible and readable proved challenging and took some iteration, with the artists eventually settling on a bluish light to represent nighttime. The designers didn't initially have a clear idea of how they wanted to utilize day/night differences in gameplay terms. They experimented with pushing a unit's sight range to cover almost the entire map during the day, but this led playtesters to only attack at night. Late in development, as the team was implementing the final race\u2014the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;\u2014their \"design groove\" had gotten so strong that they were able to experiment with more unconventional ideas, which is the reason why night elf units are the only ones who benefit from day/night.\nAbout the resources:\nHowever, during the development, many of the \"Role-Playing Strategy\" ideas were scrapped and the game became simply a normal Real-Time Strategy game with some RPG elements. Since \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" began its life &lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft%20evolution%20guide\"&gt;as a fork&lt;/a&gt; of the \"Warcraft III\" engine, the development of the MMORPG presumably began when the developers at Blizzard realized they couldn't keep all of their original RPG features in the game.\nArt style.\nWhile the jump from \"Warcraft I\" to \"II\" had involved a shift in art style, \"Warcraft III\" had even greater focus, given the issue of continuity. This was especially pertinent to the game given its introduction of numerous races. The &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s were a particular point of contention between &lt;a href=\"Chris%20Metzen\"&gt;Chris Metzen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Samwise%20Didier\"&gt;Samwise Didier&lt;/a&gt;. Metzen's orcs were more &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;-proportioned, while Didier's were hunched over and heavy with bone protrusions on their knuckles. In the end, both styles were used, with Metzen's style being used for \"leader,\" \"lore-wise\" characters (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;), while Didier's style was used for more bestial-type characters (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grommash Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;). In regards to the compromise, Didier later commented that \"using both [styles] was one of the best things we ever did.\"\nFactions.\nThere were anywhere between 6 to 13 playable factions planned for \"Warcraft III\"\u2014different Blizzard employees have given different figures when asked. These factions include:\nUnits.\nHeroes.\nHeroes were also called \"legends\" during development. There were originally six planned heroes per faction, with the number later being reduced to five, four and finally three heroes per faction. Some factions also had a flying hero unit planned, but Blizzard removed them all because of imbalance issues.\nHuman Alliance:\nOrcish Horde:\nUndead Scourge:\nNight Elf Sentinels:\nBurning Legion:\nBase troops.\nOriginally, each basic unit was planned to have something special they could do along with accompanying graphical effects, but in the final game there are some units (such as the &lt;a href=\"Knight%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Knight&lt;/a&gt;) who don't have any abilities aside from passive upgrades from buildings.\nHuman Alliance:\nOrcish Horde:\nUndead Scourge:\nNight Elf Sentinels:\nBurning Legion:\nNeutral:\nBuildings.\nHuman Alliance:\nOrcish Horde:\nUndead Scourge:\nNight Elf Sentinels:\nNeutral/Unknown:\nItems.\nSeveral planned &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s were cut before release.\nStoryline.\nFrom early on in development, the designers wanted to do something different with how they told stories in a strategy game. In Blizzard's previous titles, the story was almost entirely delivered through cinematics and briefings in between missions, but the inclusion of heroes in \"Warcraft III\" allowed them to incorporate dialogue, story moments, and RPG-style quests into the missions themselves. &lt;a href=\"Chris%20Metzen\"&gt;Chris Metzen&lt;/a&gt; worked hand-in-hand with the developers to create a campaign story over a period of roughly nine months, during which the design group locked themselves in a room outlining the story beats for each mission and how the story would interact with the map layouts and game mechanics. Every time they hit a creative wall, they forced themselves not to leave the room until it was resolved. The level designers would be given a dialogue script written by Metzen and sit around a table and read it together. When someone felt that a particular mission appealed to them, they would take responsibility for that mission and subsequently have almost complete free rein over the level design as long as it fit the script.\nSome of the dialogue in the game was originally meant to act as a placeholder, but ended up being voice acted regardless.\nAlpha storyline.\nNot much is known about how the original storyline of \"Warcraft III\" differed from the one we know:\nThe Frozen Throne.\nMany of the units and buildings that were cut during \"Warcraft IIIs alpha and beta stages were reintroduced in one way or another in the single-player campaigns of the game. Some others were only reintroduced in the expansion pack, '.\nSome units changed during the beta:\nSeveral units were also cut during the transition to the expansion pack to be replaced with similar but slightly different units:\nFinally, some things were also renamed: All &lt;a href=\"chaos%20orc\"&gt;chaos orc&lt;/a&gt;s were renamed to &lt;a href=\"fel%20orc\"&gt;fel orc&lt;/a&gt;s, owlbears became &lt;a href=\"wildkin\"&gt;wildkin&lt;/a&gt; and Malfurion lost his \"Furion\" nickname.\nThe expansion originally wasn't going to feaure an orc campaign because of time constraints and because the development team couldn't think of a way to include the orcs in the main \"&lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt;-versus-&lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt;\" storyline that wouldn't feel contrived. However, during the development of \"Reign of Chaos\", the team came up with new gameplay ideas that wouldn't function in a traditional RTS game and decided to make an orc campaign that had more RPG elements and was completely separate from the main story, resulting in &lt;a href=\"The%20Founding%20of%20Durotar\"&gt;The Founding of Durotar&lt;/a&gt;. Level designer &lt;a href=\"Tim%20Campbell\"&gt;Tim Campbell&lt;/a&gt; was the one who primarily pushed for the idea and designed the majority of the campaign, with some assistance from other designers.\n&lt;a href=\"Naga\"&gt;Naga&lt;/a&gt; was going to be &lt;a href=\"Naga%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;playable&lt;/a&gt; race. Adding Naga as the 5th race was debated for .\nAlso planned to add a &lt;a href=\"shipyard\"&gt;shipyard&lt;/a&gt; and playable &lt;a href=\"Boat\"&gt;ships&lt;/a&gt; to each race.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Axeman\"&gt;Dwarven Axeman&lt;/a&gt; is a dwarven unit that was meant to appear in the Into the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Web%20Caverns\"&gt;Shadow Web Caverns&lt;/a&gt; mission, likely meant to give Baelgun Flamebeard's forces a melee unit. It used the &lt;a href=\"Bandit\"&gt;Bandit&lt;/a&gt; model as a placeholder and had a distinctly different speaker than the standard rifleman voice.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

{"id": "51882", "revid": "3154973", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=51882", "title": "Warcraft II units", "text": "Warcraft II units are composed of three main types: ground, air and naval units. Most are trained at different &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20II%20buildings\"&gt;buildings&lt;/a&gt; and are fairly similar on either the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; faction.\nThe units are essentially quite balanced - the only real differences can be found in the &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20II%20abilities\"&gt;abilities&lt;/a&gt; used by &lt;a href=\"Paladin%20%28Warcraft%20II%29\"&gt;Paladins&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=\"Ogre-Mage%20%28Warcraft%20II%29\"&gt;Ogre-Magi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mage%20%28Warcraft%20II%29\"&gt;Mages&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=\"Death%20Knight%20%28Warcraft%20II%29\"&gt;Death Knights&lt;/a&gt;. It is often argued that the Ogre-Magi have better spells than Paladins (the &lt;a href=\"Ogre-Mage%20%28Warcraft%20II%29%23Spells\"&gt;Bloodlust&lt;/a&gt; spell used on a large number of Ogre-Magi is very devastating, and makes people easily favor the Horde, especially if they favor rush tactics) while Mages are better than Death Knights (the &lt;a href=\"Mage%20%28Warcraft%20II%29%23Spells\"&gt;Polymorph&lt;/a&gt; spell is extremely effective if used correctly), though some disagree on one count or both. The other non-cosmetic difference is that &lt;a href=\"Elven%20Ranger%20%28Warcraft%20II%29\"&gt;Elven Rangers&lt;/a&gt; can learn the Marksmanship ability (so that they deal more damage) whereas their counterparts, &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Berserker%20%28Warcraft%20II%29\"&gt;Troll Berserkers&lt;/a&gt;, can acquire Regeneration (which slowly heals their wounds).\nThese tables show the internal Basic and Piercing Damage values used in the Warcraft II Map Editor. When an attack is made, the game randomly decides whether it will deal half or full damage. The target's Armor is then subtracted from the (half or full) Basic value, with a minimum result of zero; the (half or full) Piercing value is then added to the result to get the target's HP loss from the attack. The Low and High attack values shown in a unit's infobox within the game are calculated using the above formula, with the Low value assuming a half damage attack against a target Armor of 15, and the High value a full damage attack against no Armor.\nDetailed strategies for these units are still available on the official &lt;a href=\"http%3A//classic.battle.net/war2/strategy.shtml\"&gt;\"Warcraft II\" website&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpecial Units.\nThese units cannot be built. The Eye of Kilrogg and Skeleton are summoned by Horde spellcasters. The Daemon is a rare unit that cannot be built and usually appears as an enemy in certain single-player missions and scenarios. The Daemon and skeleton can be added to any faction in the &lt;a href=\"World%20Editor\"&gt;World Editor&lt;/a&gt;, including player-controlled armies.\nCritters are non-controllable units that serve mostly as map decorations and cannot be part of armies, but can have spells cast on them or get in someone's way when they wander aimlessly.\nAttack Peasants and Attack Peons are another type of special, non-buildable unit that are found in a couple of scenarios and can only be placed using third-party map editors.\nHeroes.\nHeroes are unique non-buildable units that represent prominent Alliance and Horde characters. Each hero is based on a certain unit and has the same basic abilities as that unit (e.g. ranged attack, spells), but different stats and a unique portrait. Heroes introduced in \"Tides of Darkness\" use the same quotes as the unit they're based on, but those introduced in \"Beyond the Dark Portal\" all have unique quotes.\nThe five heroes introduced in \"Tides of Darkness\" have approximately the same stats as the unit they're based on (and are sometimes actually weaker), while the ten heroes introduced in \"Beyond the Dark Portal\" are much stronger.\nIn most campaign missions you must prevent your heroes from dying and/or escort them to a &lt;a href=\"Circle%20of%20Power\"&gt;Circle of Power&lt;/a&gt;. \nThey can also be placed on custom maps, but are treated like any other unit in this case and will not change the mission objective of the custom map. The stats of a hero can be altered separately from their base unit in the default world editor, for example Uther can be given entirely different stats than a paladin.\nTrivia.\n&lt;br&gt;"}

He was one of many night elves who fought the demons, but his extreme methods would set him apart from the rest. Illidan's fiery determination led him to abandon his allies and make a pact with the Legion.

After defeating the Legion, the night elves locked Illidan in a barrow prison to prevent him from harming the war-torn world.\nOver ten thousand years later, Illidan was freed. Rather than atone for his questionable tactics, he embraced fel magic and became a demon\u2014a necessary evil to destroy the Legion. He eventually traveled to the shattered realm of Outland and forged a fighting force in his own cursed image: the Illidari demon hunters.

When he uncovered Medivh's scheme to open a portal from Draenor and unleash demon-tainted orcs on Azeroth, Khadgar confronted and helped defeat his master. During the battle, Khadgar was struck by a terrible spell that aged him dramatically. His body turned frail, but his mind remained sharp. After the orcs were driven back through the Dark Portal, Khadgar supervised the construction of Nethergarde Keep, a fortress built to watch over the breach between realms.\nAll seemed quiet at the Dark Portal, until the orc traitor Garrosh Hellscream carved a path into an alternate version of Draenor's past. There, he aided the legendary warlord Grommash Hellscream with forging an unstoppable army of orcs: the Iron Horde. Khadgar volunteered for the suicide mission into Draenor to repel the invaders\u2014an effort that barely succeeded. \nThe armies of Azeroth then established a foothold on Draenor, and Khadgar turned his attention to what he saw as the true threat: Gul'dan. The warlock, a pawn of the Burning Legion, was running free in the shadows. The archmage worked closely with Azeroth's greatest champions to find and thwart Gul'dan, but in the moment of victory, the orc escaped to Azeroth. \nNow Khadgar is determined to rally Azeroth's combined strength against the Burning Legion's invasion... and end Gul'dan's treachery once and for all."}

The brutality and chaos of the Burning Legion's invasion affected her deeply, and she came to believe that swift, decisive action was the only answer to looming threats. When Illidan the Betrayer's life was spared for eternal imprisonment in lieu of death, she was enraged, but she offered to serve as his jailor until the end of his days. She recruited other priestesses to help her, and thus the Watchers were formed, an order that swore to protect night elf society against evil.\nAfter Illidan escaped his barrow prison, Warden Shadowsong set off to hunt him down.

Her belief in order and justice carried her through astonishing hardships, including capture at Illidan's hands, and she was there the day the Betrayer died.\nMaiev's uncompromising sense of duty leaves no room for discussion. For her, any action that combats evil is justified. This has brought her into conflict with even the highest levels of night elf society.

Years later, as a young king, he oversaw the reconstruction of Stormwind City and married Tiffin Ellerian, who gave birth to their son, Anduin.

His strength and wisdom almost single-handedly saved the faction from destruction.\nUnder Vol'jin's leadership, the Darkspear trolls became one of the first non-orc members of Warchief Thrall's Horde. Vol'jin quickly rose to prominence, becoming a trusted advisor to Thrall. In the years that followed, the wise troll played a part in guiding the Horde through crisis after crisis, and he earned the respect of orcs, tauren, blood elves, goblins, and Forsaken alike.\nThen, Garrosh Hellscream became the Horde's warchief. His blind lust for combat troubled Vol'jin. The Darkspear leader believed that Hellscream's quest for blood and glory would bring ruin to the Horde, and so he openly challenged the warchief. Ultimately, Vol'jin and his loyalists led a revolt that helped oust Garrosh from power. Following the rebellion, the mantle of warchief went to the Darkspear troll. Vol'jin promised to right the wrongs of the past, and he vowed to restore the honor that the Horde had lost.\nYet Vol'jin was not destined to lead the Horde for long. After his faction had recovered from the rebellion, the Burning Legion launched a massive invasion of Azeroth. Vol'jin fought on the front lines with his fellow Horde soldiers, struggling to hold off the demons. In the midst of battle, he suffered mortal wounds... and his spirit later passed into the realm beyond.\nThough Vol'jin is dead, he will always be remembered for his unyielding devotion to his allies, his unshakable honor, and his fearlessness in battle.

Even though \"World of Warcraft: The Roleplaying Game\" replaced the previous series, both games are still referred to as the \"Warcraft RPG\" by many for simplicity's sake. \"World of Warcraft: The Roleplaying Game\" is also at times referred to as either the World of Warcraft RPG or WoW RPG. Both series are d20-based pen-and-paper &lt;a href=\"RPG\"&gt;RPG&lt;/a&gt;s from &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.white-wolf.com\"&gt;White Wolf Publishing&lt;/a&gt; released under their &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.swordsorcery.com/\"&gt;Sword &amp; Sorcery&lt;/a&gt; imprint.\nIn 2005, White Wolf updated the rules from the previous game giving the new series the name \"World of Warcraft: The Roleplaying Game\". This was done in order to tie in with the success of the \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"MMORPG\"&gt;MMORPG&lt;/a&gt; and to use the Open Gaming License. A conversion document was released seperately explaining how to convert material from the previous game into the new system. The document also notes incompatible material that was replaced or eliminated in the new system.\nBooks.\nThe following sortable table has a default order based on the order the books were published.\nFor the chronological order of where the books fit in the game world timeline, see &lt;a href=\"Timeline%20%28RPG%20Books%20Chronology%29\"&gt;Timeline (RPG Books Chronology)&lt;/a&gt;.\nNine books have been listed by Blizzard as part of the Warcraft, later World of Warcraft, tabletop role-playing games. While they have been recommended on the WoW website as providing \"a wealth of information about Warcraft lore\". Community Manager \"Bashiok\" later stated that these books sometimes diverge from the established canon of lore in the Warcraft video games, though some ideas originating in the RPG books have made their way into the official Warcraft canon.\nOfficial source of lore.\n&lt;a href=\"Chris%20Metzen\"&gt;Chris Metzen&lt;/a&gt; was in charge of the lore and used the books to expand upon things in his view of the \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\". Many things do not show up in the MMORPG due to limitations of the game's scale and other gameplay mechanics. These limitations make the game incapable of showing everything. Metzen's personal view is that the history of Azeroth is not found in just one source, but includes the &lt;a href=\"RPG\"&gt;RPG&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"novels\"&gt;novels&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"comic\"&gt;comic&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"manual\"&gt;manual&lt;/a&gt;s, and .\n \"\" - &lt;a href=\"Chris%20Metzen\"&gt;Chris Metzen&lt;/a&gt;, World of Warcraft, Behind the Scenes DVD. \nFor example, in this interview, Metzen discusses a little bit about on how he uses the RPG to explain things within the \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" MMORPG.\nBI: How do the Gnomes fit back into Warcraft lore? They were notably absent from Warcraft III. Where have they been?\n Metzen: \nFurthermore, Metzen discusses the RPG as an expansion to \"Warcraft\" lore within several foreword letters within the RPG as well.\nFrom his introduction letter to \"Manual of Monsters\":\n - &lt;a href=\"Chris%20Metzen\"&gt;Chris Metzen&lt;/a&gt; (co-author), Creative Director, Blizzard Entertainment, 7/07/03 \nIn rebuttal to a poster that claimed that the RPG was not official, &lt;a href=\"Eyonix\"&gt;Eyonix&lt;/a&gt; had this to say: \n - &lt;a href=\"Eyonix\"&gt;Eyonix&lt;/a&gt;\nOn the \"World of Warcraft\" official website, the Warcraft RPG is said to be an important part into getting to know more about Warcraft lore. In the \"History of Warcraft\" &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/story/index.html\"&gt;section&lt;/a&gt;:\nIn the second Ask CDev Q&amp;A, Blizzard stated that the RPG books are not considered canon:\nMany of the creatures and some of the lore expand beyond what appears in the computer game. \nMost of the books are placed chronologically before \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\", and authors in-universe such as &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; cover many alternate legends believed by the people of Azeroth. Many of the books are located at earlier points in the timeline, and the culture, population factors, and other historical events have taken place or changed since the point in time that they cover. \nMany cultures have changed since the period of time when the RPG books take place, and even between the events of the books. Some cultures mentioned no longer exist at the time of \"World of Warcraft\", and some cultures existed thousands of years before or during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;.

Players can engage in these modes in co-op, and battle against other players in PvP. It is primarily a PvE game, and the game's campaign represents a number of locations from \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\", including &lt;a href=\"Elwynn%20Forest\"&gt;Elwynn Forest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Duskwood\"&gt;Duskwood&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt;. 70 PvE maps will be available at launch, each of which has a boss with a specific mechanic that players must find a way around. Certain modes only become available after the play has retrieved enough skulls.\nThe game also has a quest system, which involves playing old maps to gain experience for specific units. The game's dungeon mode is a 3-map gauntlet with a single army. For every map, the player gets to pick one new relic. The relic has various properties, and can provide a troop-wide buff, such as increasing certain units' speed or health. After each successful dungeon is cleared, the dungeon will level up. Dungeons will only be available for a certain amount of time. Dungeons are also the only means of obtaining Valor, which is an in-game resource used to upgrade leaders.\n\"Warcraft Rumble\" has been compared to the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_defense\"&gt;tower defense&lt;/a&gt; genre, but in the words of the developers, it is more of a tower \"offense\" game.\nA match will generally consist of the following aspects:\nMonetization.\n\"Warcraft Rumble\" uses a free-to-play model. It has been stated that it is not a \"gacha game,\" and will not have loot boxes. Players will be able to purchase any unit they choose either with their own money or through in-game coins. The units can be bought in bundles. Levels are purchased using in-game coins.\nThe game will not have NFTs.\nFactions.\n\"Warcraft Rumble\" has five factions, each of whose leaders specialize in a certain area:\nThe game does not force players to choose one faction. Players can choose their leaders (and units) from all five to form a varied army.\nMinis.\nThere are over 65 \"Warcraft\" minis to collect, including leaders, rank-and-file troop minis and spells. Different minis have different advantages in combat\u2014flying troops are effective against infantry, siege troops deal additional damage to guard towers, etc. Each unit is classified as either ranged, melee, or flying, and the three form a rock-paper-scissors system. Generally, flying beats melee, melee beats range, and range beats flying.\nAfter each battle, experience is gained that levels up minis. Leveling them up unlocks the ability to use game-changing talents.\nLeaders.\nThe leader is typically the most powerful unit the player will field. Each leader also has one leader ability that will affect offer units in your army while they are on the battlefield. For example, when Rend is in play, it costs one less piece of gold to summon flying units.\nTroops.\nTroops in-game include rank-and-file troop minis and spells. Each unit has three passive abilities called \"talents,\" which can be unlocked over time.\nDevelopment.\nWhen making \"Arclight Rumble\", the developers took inspiration from tower defense games. The game's unit roster was decided on the need to make the characters to stand out on small phone screens. As such, each model needed an identifiable silhouette, as well as a color-coded palette. The developers conciously chose factions outside the Alliance and Horde, as they wanted representation from across the \"Warcraft\" universe.\nThe game entered internal alpha in mid-2021.

As a result many characters which died or were changed long ago in the main universe are still living and unaltered in the film universe, but whether their ultimate fates will diverge from the main universe or repeat the known lore is yet to be revealed.\nOriginal characters.\nThe following characters are original to the film universe, not having appeared in any form in the main universe.\nTaria Wrynn was later &lt;a href=\"Taria%20Wrynn\"&gt;made into canon&lt;/a&gt;.\nExplanations.\nWhile many of the above changes are simple plot deviations, some are more far-reaching.

Some of the examples can be traced to gameplay restrictions, and the info given here should not be taken as the exact workings of the Warcraft universe.\nForce.\nConservation of momentum is not always perceivable in the games. When a large object collides a smaller object, the smaller object can remain relatively stationary.\nIt's possible that some magical beings could move without the need to push on any form of physical matter. &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titans&lt;/a&gt; for example move through the empty space of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark\"&gt;Great Dark&lt;/a&gt; without any visible form of propulsion. The undead &lt;a href=\"Lich\"&gt;Lich&lt;/a&gt;es float above ground, but whether they magically conjure propulsion or solely rely on magical energies is unknown.\nGravity.\n&lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; consists of land masses floating within an alternate realm of existence. However, the gameplay mechanics only allow a unidirectional gravitational force, meaning one can fall off of these land masses, instead of being able to walk or climb over their every surface.\nMatter.\nMatter can be transformed into other types of matter through magic. &lt;a href=\"Alchemy\"&gt;Alchemists&lt;/a&gt; for example, have the ability to transmute raw materials into others.\nTime.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20universe\"&gt;Warcraft universe&lt;/a&gt;, beings can travel forward or backwards through time and have the ability to change history sometimes. In the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;, beings can travel through time to battle &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; but their deeds will not affect later outcomes in history. This follows one theory, according to which traveling through time is equal to traveling to a parallel universe, with its own timeline. Before travel, it would have not existed, as it was the same as the universe the time-traveler left. Traveling back in time creates the universe, following the timeline up to the point you travel to, before branching off to create a new timeline after intervention. Because it is an alternate universe, the effects have no impact on the universe of departure.\nMedivh explained two different theories of time to Khadgar while he was his apprentice. One followed the most common idea of a sequential series of events, while the other was one of a predetermined history. He used the comparison between a clock and an hourglass as a metaphor to explain himself. If time works like an hourglass, all the events in time are there, what order in which they are determined (passing through the sand timer) is random, but that which we experience and see will appear to be in order, and still have the same outcome.\nThere are two methods for this, divine and logical predetermination. With the former, a powerful being (possibly a titan) plans out a course of time, which it will purposely keep in check. This is similar to the concept of fate destiny. The latter is a more complex idea, where causes and effects are more predictable, thus the future is already known. However, even if they are not predictable, it is also possible for history to already be written, but the order of the events simply fall into place. Both theories share the idea that nothing people do can change the future, they need only play their part to lead up to it.\nA predetermined timeline, logical or divine, seems likely with the existence of a giant sand timer inside the &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt; which controls the flow of time.\nAlternative Planes.\nAll known planes of existence have three physical dimensions or more. In no known dimension do its inhabitants flatten out (2D) or become lines (1D).\nAlternative planes appear to all share the same timeline, but possibly not all share the same concept of measurable time. For example within the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; time and distance have no meaning. A day in the physical world can feel like a decade within the Dream. \nSouls.\nBodies are moved by souls or magical means. Upon death, beings are turned into souls. These souls can inhabit different bodies and control them. For example, &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; co-inhabited &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh's&lt;/a&gt; body with Medivh's soul and both fought for control of his body. These souls probably cause beings to move (or infuse the being with the will to move) because without them beings have not been seen to move unless they move by magical means such as &lt;a href=\"golem\"&gt;golem&lt;/a&gt;s.\n&lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;Night elf&lt;/a&gt; players souls in WoW appear as wisps, cloud-like sphere apparitions of ancient forest spirits, unlike regular souls of the mortal races. Again, this may be a personal projection, as NPC night elf souls have typically appeared like the other races.\nLike physical beings, souls can be trapped (see: Malfurion in &lt;a href=\"The%20Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;The Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;). Souls are different from ghosts who can have a profound impact on the world. The difference between souls and ghosts is not known.\nSometimes souls can be reattached to the former body, and new soul take control of other body."}

Soon after, &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Bloodhoof%20tribe\"&gt;tribe&lt;/a&gt; pledged their service to the Horde.

You must recover the Glyph of Purification from the local Centaur Khan and use its energies to restore the Fountain's holy waters. Once that is done, the purified waters will replenish your warriors' health.\"\nBattle.\nCairne suggested enlisting the aid of the &lt;a href=\"wyvern\"&gt;wyvern&lt;/a&gt;s who dwelt nearby. Upon reaching their nesting grounds, the two leaders discovered that a band of &lt;a href=\"Harpy\"&gt;harpies&lt;/a&gt; had captured and enslaved the wyverns. Encountering fierce local resistance, a force led by Thrall and Cairne fought their way to they harpies' lair and slaughtered the vile bird-women, freeing the wyverns. The Horde made good use of their new allies, who allowed Orc &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;s to mount them and served as powerful aerial assault units. Thrall also defeated a &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt; khan who held a glyph which purified a befouled fountain and secured its healing powers for the Horde. With new allies and a healing fount at their disposal, the Horde advanced toward the human positions. A fortified camp which had been sending attacks against the Horde's position was encountered along the slopes of the mountain and rapidly levelled. The Humans' main position lay high on a ridge at the summit, with no direct access for ground forces. Using the &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"zeppelin\"&gt;zeppelin&lt;/a&gt;s that they had acquired, Thrall led a force to attack the ridge and establish a beachhead, from which the Horde launched a massive all-out assault which overran the human defences. Jaina Proudmoore and the human survivors fled into the depths of the mountain, closely followed by Thrall and Cairne."}
