They use shadow magic to combat the fire and wind of &lt;a href=\"Rukhmar\"&gt;Rukhmar&lt;/a&gt;'s flying arakkoa followers, the &lt;a href=\"Adherents%20of%20Rukhmar\"&gt;Adherents of Rukhmar&lt;/a&gt;. Some of them, however, still pray to the sun goddess hoping that she will rid them of the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Sethe\"&gt;curse&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Sethe\"&gt;Sethe&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nDiscipline is harsh for any arakkoa who conflicts with the sages ruling the capital of Skyreach. Those found guilty of breaking the law, dabbling in shadow magic, or worshiping gods other than Rukhmar are hurled from the spires and into the cursed pools of Sethekk Hollow, where their wings shrivel and their bodies contort. No longer able to fly, and forever cut off from their sun god, these outcasts have formed their own communities in the shadows of the spires, particularly in the refuge city of Skettis. The outcasts are a tight-knit group and deeply distrustful, but they share common enemies with adventurers from Azeroth, and it may be possible to forge a relationship with them if one knows who to speak with.\nA group within the Arakkoa Outcasts called the &lt;a href=\"Ravenspeakers\"&gt;Ravenspeakers&lt;/a&gt; worship Anzu's consort: &lt;a href=\"Ka%27alu\"&gt;Ka'alu&lt;/a&gt;, the Raven Mother.\nWhen several Outcasts, including Iskar himself, joined the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; in order to regain their wings, the Outcasts who remained allied themselves with the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Awakened\"&gt;Order of the Awakened&lt;/a&gt; to combat their brethren in &lt;a href=\"Tanaan%20Jungle\"&gt;Tanaan Jungle&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome of the Arakkoa Outcasts would go on to become the faction of arakkoa fought in &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Blade's Edge Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Terokkar%20Forest\"&gt;Terokkar Forest&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;.\nCulture.\nA standard greeting among the Outcasts is the phrase \"Shadows gather,\" to which the person being spoken to responds \"...when the raven swallows the day\". Together, the two phrases make up the first line of &lt;a href=\"Rukhmar\"&gt;Rukhmar&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Rukhmar%23Rukhmar%27s%20Lullaby\"&gt;lullaby&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Outcasts prefer to keep to the shadows, using both magic and ciphers to conceal themselves, their secrets and their most precious artifacts. The Outcasts can disguise themselves in such diverse forms as draenei, other arakkoa, or even mushrooms, and use scarecrow-like &lt;a href=\"illusion%20effigy\"&gt;illusion effigies&lt;/a&gt; to project false images or even allow them to communicate across large distances. They can cloak themselves and others in shadow, or even cross over into the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Realm\"&gt;Shadow Realm&lt;/a&gt; to hide entirely from those outside it.\nReputation.\nReputation with the Outcasts is gained from the storyline 'The Plight of the Arakkoa' in &lt;a href=\"Talador\"&gt;Talador&lt;/a&gt;, and from questing and completing bonus objectives in the &lt;a href=\"Spires%20of%20Arak\"&gt;Spires of Arak&lt;/a&gt;. Afterwards, killing level 100+ mobs found in &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Veil%20Anzu\"&gt;Lost Veil Anzu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Skettis%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Skettis&lt;/a&gt; grant reputation all the way to . \nAdditionally, a &lt;a href=\"Relic%20of%20Rukhmar\"&gt;Relic of Rukhmar&lt;/a&gt; can be obtained from a rare level 100 garrison combat mission. Using the relic grants 2500 reputation.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"%3ASign%20of%20the%20Emissary\"&gt;:Sign of the Emissary&lt;/a&gt; event, all kills within heroic and mythic &lt;a href=\"Skyreach\"&gt;Skyreach&lt;/a&gt; award reputation.\nFaction description.\n\"Working from the shadows, the Arakkoa Outcasts seek to bring a brighter tomorrow.\""}

He comes from &lt;a href=\"Lakeshire\"&gt;Lakeshire&lt;/a&gt;.\nAramar's journey is led by a strange compass gifted to him by his father during the night of a &lt;a href=\"Hidden\"&gt;pirate&lt;/a&gt; attack on the \"&lt;a href=\"Wavestrider\"&gt;Wavestrider&lt;/a&gt;\". The compass does not point north, and its crystal needle is \"a shard of pure starlight from the heavens, imbued with the celestial spark.\" The crystal does not come from &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nAramar Thorne was born to &lt;a href=\"Greydon%20Thorne\"&gt;Greydon Thorne&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ceya%20Northbrooke%20Thorne%20Glade\"&gt;Ceya Northbrooke&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Lakeshire\"&gt;Lakeshire&lt;/a&gt;. On Aram's sixth birthday, his father abandoned his family quite suddenly. At first, he didn't want to believe that Greydon abandoned them and thought that he was taken by &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt;s. After two years, Aram accepted the reality and it left him with a grudge which he has never ceased harboring. In the meantime, Ceya married &lt;a href=\"Robb%20Glade\"&gt;Robb Glade&lt;/a&gt; who saw his talent and bought him a sketchbook on his twelfth birthday. Six years after the sudden abandonment, one month after his twelfth birthday, Greydon returned, and, with the consent of both his mother and stepfather, took Aram on a one year voyage around &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; aboard his ship, the \"&lt;a href=\"Wavestrider\"&gt;Wavestrider&lt;/a&gt;\". During the next six months, Greydon began rigorously tutoring his son in an eclectic range of topics, such as trade, anthropology, biology, swordplay, and sailcraft. Aram was plagued by dreams where the &lt;a href=\"Voice%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Voice of the Light&lt;/a&gt; seems to guide him to some uncertain future.\nAfter landing in &lt;a href=\"Desolace\"&gt;Desolace&lt;/a&gt;, the crew traded with &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Grimtail%20clan\"&gt;Grimtail clan&lt;/a&gt; led by their female matriarch &lt;a href=\"Cackle\"&gt;Cackle&lt;/a&gt; who noticed Aram's vivid sketches and she considered it a powerful magic. The crew then sailed to &lt;a href=\"Flayers%27%20Point\"&gt;Flayers' Point&lt;/a&gt; where Aram noticed the ship's cook &lt;a href=\"Jonas%20Cobb\"&gt;Jonas Cobb&lt;/a&gt; trading and betraying the crew. The \"Wavestrider\" was then boarded and scuttled by pirates led by the mysterious band known only as the &lt;a href=\"Hidden\"&gt;Hidden&lt;/a&gt;. As Jonas was about to attack Aram, he was crushed by the destroyed ship mast and Aram took his cutlass. After witnessing the battle, Greydon placed a strange compass which never pointed north in the care of Aram, warning him that the device must be protected at all costs. Greydon placed his son under the care of his young second mate, &lt;a href=\"Makasa%20Flintwill\"&gt;Makasa Flintwill&lt;/a&gt;, a stern 17-year-old girl who had no love for Aram and had previously been teasing one another. Aram and Makasa escaped, though most of the crew, including its Captain, ostensibly lost their lives. Stranded in &lt;a href=\"Feralas\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt;, Makasa and Aram had no choice but to rely on each other to survive. Though he resented his lessons, he took his father's advice about seeing the value in all life to heart, and in the wilds of Feralas, befriended the &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Murky%20%28Traveler%29\"&gt;Murky&lt;/a&gt;, and the night elf &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thalyss%20Greyoak\"&gt;Thalyss Greyoak&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, Aram came to realize that Makasa saw Greydon as a surrogate father since he saved her from a Horde raid that killed her brothers. Recognizing each other as siblings, the pair put aside their differences to survive the wilds of Feralas. \nEventually, the Hidden found Aram and kidnapped Murky, demanding that he hand over the compass in exchange for the murloc's life. The exchange, however, was interrupted by a group of &lt;a href=\"Gordunni%20tribe\"&gt;Gordunni&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s led by &lt;a href=\"Wordok\"&gt;Wordok&lt;/a&gt;, who captured Aram and Thalyss and took them to Dire Maul, where they were forced to fight for the amusement of &lt;a href=\"King%20Gordok\"&gt;King Gordok&lt;/a&gt;. In the gladiator pits, Aram met the former &lt;a href=\"Woodpaw\"&gt;Woodpaw&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Hackle\"&gt;Hackle&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Wuul%20Breezerider\"&gt;Woolbeard&lt;/a&gt;, both of whom were taken with the skill of his art. When forced to face Hackle in the arena, he instead convinced the gnoll runt that he could curse him using the powerful magic contained within his portrait. Enraged by the lack of blood, Gordok unleashed a colossal &lt;a href=\"wyvern\"&gt;wyvern&lt;/a&gt; named Old &lt;a href=\"One-Eye\"&gt;One-Eye&lt;/a&gt;. Never one to harm a living creature, Aram refused to hurt the beast, and instead cut the spiked collar from the wyvern and helped free its cubs. At this moment, the Hidden arrived to claim Aram and the compass. &lt;a href=\"Malus\"&gt;Malus&lt;/a&gt;, their leader, challenged Gordok to a bloody duel. In the ensuing chaos, Aram - with the help of Makasa, who had tracked her brother through the wilds - escaped on the back of the wyvern. During the escape, the druid Thalyss sacrificed his life to protect the boy from a crossbow bolt. High above near the border to &lt;a href=\"Thousand%20Needles\"&gt;Thousand Needles&lt;/a&gt; on the back of the wyvern, Aram found that the compass had all along been pointing in the direction of a mysterious shard buried in the earth. It was the shard of a sword, though Aram did not know that. Aram now plans, along with Makasa, Hackle and Murky to reach &lt;a href=\"Gadgetzan\"&gt;Gadgetzan&lt;/a&gt; in order to fulfill Thalyss' last wish to deliver an item to his friend there, as well as the wish of his father to protect and uncover the mystery of the compass and the Light that has been speaking to him, with the Hidden close behind. At this point, they have been in Feralas for close to a month."}

They are both night elves, but unlike Elise who pursued druid-priest abilities, Aranna pursued Demon Hunter abilities. She has not yet appeared in World of Warcraft.\nIn Hearthstone.\nThe first hint of Aranna is given &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DMG3nb7Oam4k%26amp%3Bt%3D1m22s\"&gt;a minute and 22 seconds&lt;/a&gt; into the Journey to Un\u2019Goro Cinematic Trailer released 27 February 2017 where a younger Night Elf is seen saluting Elise alongside two others - a Blood Elf later revealed to become &lt;a href=\"Varden%20Dawngrasp\"&gt;Varden Dawngrasp&lt;/a&gt; and an orc later revealed to be &lt;a href=\"Rokara\"&gt;Rokara&lt;/a&gt;. Their male companion &lt;a href=\"Guff%20Runetotem\"&gt;Guff Runetotem&lt;/a&gt; doesn't salute. None of the four children are initially referred to by name.\nThe child blood elf does not have glasses like Aranna is seen wearing while older, and her blue eyes are of a lighter tone than Elise's, closer to that of a &lt;a href=\"Void%20Elf\"&gt;Void Elf&lt;/a&gt;.\nAranna is first referenced by name as the playable protagonist heroine of \"Trial by Felfire\", a single-player campaign released 17 June 2020 (patched in early 12 May 2020) accompanying the \"Ashes of Outland\" expansion from April 2020. Aranna first appears in her most elf-life form &lt;a href=\"https%3A//hearthstone.wiki.gg/wiki/Aranna_Starseeker_%28Trial_by_Felfire%29\"&gt;Aranna Starseeker&lt;/a&gt; where her \"The Right Tool\" hero power allowed her to discover cards from her deck. Although she was classified as a Demon Hunter (and already had the green irises in her eyes) her initial deck was formed of a mix of Hunter and Rogue cards.\nAranna initially wore circular-rimmed glasses, much as Elise does, which is still apparent when she &lt;a href=\"https%3A//hearthstone.wiki.gg/wiki/File%3AStolen_Demolisher_full.jpg\"&gt;pilots a stolen demolisher&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis changed when she became &lt;a href=\"https%3A//hearthstone.wiki.gg/wiki/Aranna_in_Training\"&gt;Aranna in Training&lt;/a&gt; when her eyes became fully neon green and she stopped wearing glasses. Although she retained the 'right tool' hero power, this transitional period for 3 boss fights began to introduce Demon Hunter cards into her Hunter/Rogue deck. She visibly has begun to grow small horns here.\nHer final form in the story &lt;a href=\"https%3A//hearthstone.wiki.gg/wiki/Aranna%2C_Unleashed\"&gt;Aranna, Unleashed&lt;/a&gt; finally replaced her hero power with &lt;a href=\"https%3A//hearthstone.wiki.gg/wiki/Combination_Strike\"&gt;Combination Strike&lt;/a&gt; which resembled that of the base Demon Hunter class in giving attack for 1 mana. This incarnation uses decks which are entirely Demon Hunter class, no longer having Hunter or Rogue ones in the mix. Visually by this point her horns had grown longer, and she is growing with bright green energy.\nIn the Tavern Brawl \"Rumbledome\" released 1 July 2020 (patched in early 9 June 2020) a &lt;a href=\"https%3A//hearthstone.wiki.gg/wiki/Aranna_Starseeker_%28Tavern_Brawl%29\"&gt;dual-class&lt;/a&gt; version of Aranna was introduced, counting as both a Hunter and a Demon Hunter at the same time. She used the same graphic as the \"unleashed\" form in Trial by Felfire.\nThe \"Mercenaries\" game mode introduced in 2021 added her as &lt;a href=\"https%3A//hearthstone.wiki.gg/wiki/Mercenaries/Aranna_Starseeker\"&gt;a blue \"Caster\" mercenary card&lt;/a&gt; which made reference to her musical talents (two abilities: Felodic Intonement and Iambic Pentameter). The artwork for Felodic Intonement was used the following year in her \"Songress\" skin. It also referenced her sibling relationship (two task tiles: Arguing with Elise and Twisted Sisters, plus task 17's description \"Time to show the world who the strongest Starseeker is!\") while the graphics progressively show how her form changed throughout Trial by Felfire as she moved away from her sister to become a Demon Hunter.\nAranna has had thirteen battlegrounds skins and nine constructed skins released, showing her in different outfits and themes. Some of them depict her in the past (pre-Trial) in her original Night Elf form wearing her glasses, while others depict her in her later half-Demon form having shed the glasses.\nHer introduction as a minion card didn't happen until her &lt;a href=\"https%3A//hearthstone.wiki.gg/wiki/Aranna%2C_Thrill_Seeker\"&gt;Thrill Seeker&lt;/a&gt; version was introduced in July 2024's \"Perils in Paradise\" as a Legendary Demon Hunter minion whose \"Tourist\" ability allowed Priest cards to be added to the deck. This version of her has glasses and blue eyes, meaning it depicts her prior to her Trial by Felfire and becoming a Demon Hunter. The card text \"Aranna, I feel like you only came to this island so you could use the zipline.\" is implied to be admonishment from a teacher, perhaps Elise, during her time with the Junior Explorers. Her tourism ability is implied to be a link to her sister, who began as a Druid but gradually shifted to become a dual-class Priest by the time of this expansion.\nGiven that the Demon Hunters' \"Metamorphosis\" is a transformation they can switch into temporarily, depictions of her without the horns may not necessarily be old ones, but just happen later on when she has regressed and is depicted in casual situations.\nRelatives.\nShe may be related to &lt;a href=\"Astarii%20Starseeker\"&gt;Astarii Starseeker&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Airae%20Starseeker\"&gt;Airae Starseeker&lt;/a&gt;."}

He united all of the centaur &lt;a href=\"tribe\"&gt;tribe&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; into a massive army, with the goal of destroying the \"mongrel\" races of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and creating a new era in which he and the centaur would rule over the world. Both Aratas and his father were killed by the &lt;a href=\"Garad%27kra\"&gt;Garad'kra&lt;/a&gt; before they could realize their plans.\nBiography.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"Aratas%27%20father\"&gt;unnamed elemental&lt;/a&gt; emerged in &lt;a href=\"Maraudon\"&gt;Maraudon&lt;/a&gt; and created a new race of centaur\u2014the &lt;a href=\"perfect%20ones\"&gt;perfect ones&lt;/a&gt;\u2014in order to reclaim Azeroth from the mortal races who had \"defiled\" it and usher in a new age, one in which the centaur would reign over the world with Aratas as their ruler. Aratas referred to the elemental as his \"father\" and to the other perfect ones as his \"brothers\". He wielded a magical spear forged in &lt;a href=\"Deepholm\"&gt;Deepholm&lt;/a&gt; which carried his father's power.\nAratas and his perfect ones united all of Kalimdor's centaur tribes\u2014the &lt;a href=\"Kolkar%20clan\"&gt;Kolkar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Magram%20clan\"&gt;Magram&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maraudine%20clan\"&gt;Maraudine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gelkis%20clan\"&gt;Gelkis&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Galak%20tribe\"&gt;Galak&lt;/a&gt;\u2014into a massive army in &lt;a href=\"Desolace\"&gt;Desolace&lt;/a&gt;. Capitalizing on the chaos of the Cataclysm, he sent his army to attack settlements all over Kalimdor in order to keep the Horde distracted, and enslaved a large number of &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s. He planned to then begin the \"transformation of [his] kingdom\" by destroying every settlement belonging the centaur's archenemies, the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt;, before crushing their capital of &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt;, which would cause the older breed of centaur to worship him as a god. Then, he planned to attack &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; itself; to crush any resistance, he planned to unleash his father from Maraudon. Aratas dreamed of a strong and \"pure\" centaur race; he was disgusted by the older breed and forbade them from entering Maraudon, and in at least &lt;a href=\"Dorthar\"&gt;one case&lt;/a&gt; ordered the perfect ones to kill a member of the older breed who was deemed too weak.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Barrens\"&gt;Northern Barrens&lt;/a&gt;, a group of perfect ones were defeated by &lt;a href=\"Malgar\"&gt;Malgar&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ironhoof\"&gt;Ironhoof&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt;. Before Ironhoof could question the only surviving centaur, Aratas appeared atop a nearby hill and killed the survivor with a spear throw before disappearing again just as quickly. Malgar later returned to the site of the battle to inspect Aratas' hoofprints, and decided to pursue the khan to see how dangerous he was. He found the khan's camp in the Barrens and sneaked in while it was seemingly undefended, but Aratas had expected Malgar's arrival and surrounded him with centaur. The orc was saved by the arrival of Ironhoof and the rest of the &lt;a href=\"Garad%27kra\"&gt;Garad'kra&lt;/a&gt;. In the ensuing battle, Aratas retreated but was pursued by Malgar. He mocked the orc for leaving his allies' side when they were fighting a losing battle, prompting Malgar to return to the fight and help turn the tide. Aratas realized that the centaur might still win if he killed Malgar and tried throwing a spear at him, but the orc was saved by &lt;a href=\"Dorthar\"&gt;Dorthar&lt;/a&gt;, a centaur who'd been abandoned by his kin. The Garad'kra defeated the perfect ones, but Aratas escaped back to Desolace.\nAfter learning of the High Khan's plans from Dorthar, the Garad'kra traveled to Desolace with the only hope of buying time for the Horde and stopping the centaur army by killing Aratas, even if it meant their own deaths. Aratas expected this as well and confronted the Garad'kra at the entrance to Maraudon with his perfect ones. The centaur started to defeat the Garad'kra, and Aratas personally captured their leader &lt;a href=\"Shagara\"&gt;Shagara&lt;/a&gt;, tauntingly telling her that they would die since they had no harmony of purpose and therefore no \"heart\". However, Malgar then arrived and saved his friends, causing Aratas to realize that it was Malgar who was the Garad'kra's \"heart\". He threw a spear at the orc's back, but the &lt;a href=\"Jungle%20troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Rada%27jin\"&gt;Rada'jin&lt;/a&gt; sacrificed himself to save the orc.\nAratas retreated with the unconscious Shagara into Maraudon with the intent of sacrificing her to his father, which would drive the latter into a bloodlust and cause him to rampage across the world, leaving Aratas as Azeroth's new god. The Garad'kra pursued him into outer Maraudon, and Aratas summoned his father to fight them. Malgar and his wolf &lt;a href=\"Remnes\"&gt;Remnes&lt;/a&gt; chased after Aratas and Shagara deeper into Maraudon. The khan revealed that he'd hoped Malgar would follow him, so he could kill the orc as revenge for killing the other perfect ones. He easily held Malgar and Remnes off but also, in his bragging, unintentionally revealed that his spear might be his father's only weakness. Shagara then revealed that she was conscious and used an earth totem to root Aratas in place, allowing Malgar to decapitate the khan. The orcs ran back to the main chamber and Malgar tossed Aratas' head at the elemental to distract it, sending it into a rage. Shagara gave Aratas' spear to &lt;a href=\"Ashra%20Valandril\"&gt;Ashra Valandril&lt;/a&gt;, and he used the spear to destroy the elemental. The centaur took days to recover from their High Khan's death, giving the Horde time to move their armies into position and break up the horse-men's army, thereby ending their threat."}

He created a new race of &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt; known as the &lt;a href=\"perfect%20ones\"&gt;perfect ones&lt;/a&gt;, led by Aratas, with the intent of conquering &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and purging it of its other mortal races. Both the elemental and his creations were destroyed by the &lt;a href=\"Garad%27kra\"&gt;Garad'kra&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nThe elemental emerged in Maraudon at some point after the death of &lt;a href=\"Theradras\"&gt;Princess Theradras&lt;/a&gt;. He believed that &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s mortal races were responsible for the imbalance in nature that led to the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;. In response, he created the &lt;a href=\"perfect%20ones\"&gt;perfect ones&lt;/a&gt; to unite the existing centaur tribes, reclaim Azeroth from those who had \"defiled\" it, and usher in a new age in which the horse-men would reign over the world, with the &lt;a href=\"khan\"&gt;High Khan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Aratas\"&gt;Aratas&lt;/a&gt; as their ruler. Aratas referred to the elemental as his \"father\" and to the other perfect ones as his \"brothers\". The khan wielded a spear forged in &lt;a href=\"Deepholm\"&gt;Deepholm&lt;/a&gt; which carried the power of his father.\nWhile Aratas led the centaur in launching attacks on the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, the elemental hid deep in Maraudon, gathering his strength and bolstering the perfect ones' ranks daily. When the time was right, Aratas planned to unleash his father to crush the Horde's capital cities, though at least one of his underlings worried that the elemental was uncontrollable. Rumors among the centaur army claimed that the elemental could only be destroyed by a weapon \"not of Azeroth\".\nTo stop Aratas, a team of the &lt;a href=\"Garad%27kra\"&gt;Garad'kra&lt;/a&gt; militia confronted him at the entrance to Maraudon. In the ensuing battle, he captured their leader &lt;a href=\"Shagara\"&gt;Shagara&lt;/a&gt; and brought her into the temple with the intent of sacrificing her to his father. Tasting the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;'s flesh would send the elemental into a bloodlust and cause him to \"cull the weak\" from all of Azeroth. The Garad'kra chased after him into the outer chamber of Maraudon, where the khan summoned his father to fight them. The elemental's hide proved to be invincible to &lt;a href=\"Ironhoof\"&gt;Ironhoof&lt;/a&gt;'s axe, &lt;a href=\"Felgrim\"&gt;Felgrim&lt;/a&gt;'s shadow magic, and &lt;a href=\"Ashra%20Valandril\"&gt;Ashra&lt;/a&gt;'s holy magic alike. Meanwhile, the Garad'kra's ally &lt;a href=\"Malgar\"&gt;Malgar&lt;/a&gt; pursued Aratas and killed him with Shagara's help. The two orcs realized that Aratas' spear might be the elemental's only weakness and ran back to the main chamber. Malgar tossed Aratas' decapitated head at the elemental to distract it, sending it into a rage, while Shagara gave the khan's spear to Ashra. After the others used their abilities to give him an opening, Ashra drove the spear into the elemental's body, causing him to explode. With the deaths of Aratas and his father, the Horde was saved and was able to scatter the remaining centaur."}

The Basin itself is known for its rich mines, fertile land and skilled craftsmen and is coveted by both the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Forsaken%20Defilers\"&gt;Forsaken Defilers&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"League%20of%20Arathor\"&gt;League of Arathor&lt;/a&gt; have arrived at Arathi Basin to wage war over these natural resources and claim them on behalf of their respective sides. A &lt;a href=\"resource%20race\"&gt;resource race&lt;/a&gt; battleground, players must dominate the Basin's bases in order to claim its resources, similar to \"King of the Hill\" or \"Conquest\" modes in other games.\nThere also exists a \"Winter Arathi Basin\" version, introduced as a PvP Brawl.\nOfficial overview.\n\"Arathi Basin is a mountain-rimmed valley with some of the most arable acres in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;. The basin has long been a prime point of societal development, offering lumber, gold and prime grazing land for livestock. It was only a matter of time before this fertile place was viewed through the sights of bows and guns.\"\n\"The Basin's earliest days (and original owners) aren't even footnotes in history \u2013 the land frenzy driving Alliance and Horde now dominates the landscape. The &lt;a href=\"League%20of%20Arathor\"&gt;League of Arathor&lt;/a&gt;, the remnants of the once-proud kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt; (now occupied by &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s and the criminals of the &lt;a href=\"Syndicate\"&gt;Syndicate&lt;/a&gt;), would claim the basin to profit their allies in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; (and, through them, the whole of the Alliance). Set against them are the &lt;a href=\"forsaken\"&gt;forsaken&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Defilers\"&gt;Defilers&lt;/a&gt;, free-willed undead who strive to savage the human kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; and secure their home in the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 and they demand Arathi's resources to do it.\"\nDescription.\n\"The Arathi Basin is one of the main staging points of war between the humans and the Forsaken in Azeroth. Arathi Basin is a 15 vs 15 domination battleground, where each side attempts to control the Stables, Blacksmith, Mine, Lumbermill and Farm for as long as possible. The Defilers' elite troopers seek to sever the vital connection between the humans and their dwarven allies to the south. Meanwhile, the League of Arathor seek to reclaim lost lands for their benefactors in Stormwind.\"\nEntering Arathi Basin.\nAs with all &lt;a href=\"battleground\"&gt;battleground&lt;/a&gt;s, players of sufficient level can queue for Arathi Basin through the &lt;a href=\"PvP%20interface\"&gt;PvP interface&lt;/a&gt;. \nPlayers can also queue by speaking to a &lt;a href=\"battlemaster\"&gt;battlemaster&lt;/a&gt;, found in &lt;a href=\"capital%20cities\"&gt;capital cities&lt;/a&gt;, or by traveling to their faction's game world entrance to Arathi Basin, found in the &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands\"&gt;Arathi Highlands&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; entrance is located inside &lt;a href=\"Refuge%20Pointe\"&gt;Refuge Pointe&lt;/a&gt;, while the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; entrance is located just behind &lt;a href=\"Hammerfall\"&gt;Hammerfall&lt;/a&gt;. However, all methods open the same window, offering players the same options. There is, therefore, no practical reason not to simply queue via the &lt;a href=\"PvP%20interface\"&gt;PvP interface&lt;/a&gt;.\nOverview.\nThe objective is to be the first team to gain 1,500 resources. This is done by controlling locations on the map (\"Resource Nodes\"). While a node is controlled, it generates resources for the faction's team that controls it.\nAccumulating resources.\nResources accumulate at the rates shown in the table below. \nHonor rewards.\nThe game awards bonus &lt;a href=\"Honor%20system%20%28Battle%20for%20Azeroth%29\"&gt;honor&lt;/a&gt; to everyone on your side of the match for reaching certain goals. The amount of honor gained varies according to level. Those goals are:\nLosing a match results in less bonus honor, dependent on how many resources your team managed to collect before the loss.\nOther scored events do not award bonus honor. These include: killing blows, assaulting a node, capturing a node, and defending a node.\nReputation.\nParticipating in Arathi Basin improves your reputation with &lt;a href=\"Defilers\"&gt;The Defilers&lt;/a&gt; (Horde) or &lt;a href=\"League%20of%20Arathor\"&gt;The League of Arathor&lt;/a&gt; (Alliance).\nQuests.\nThere are a number of quests involving fighting in Arathi Basin, some of which need reputation with the battleground faction. You can get them from one of the NPCs near the battleground entrances in &lt;a href=\"Hammerfall\"&gt;Hammerfall&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Refuge%20Pointe\"&gt;Refuge Pointe&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe first quest will usually be &lt;a href=\"The%20Battle%20for%20Arathi%20Basin%21\"&gt;The Battle for Arathi Basin!&lt;/a&gt;, for which you need to assault four different bases.\nArathi Basin items.\nArathi Basin items are available by spending &lt;a href=\"Honor%20Point\"&gt;Honor Point&lt;/a&gt;s. The Alliance vendor for these items is near the Alliance Arathi Basin battleground entrance in &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands\"&gt;Arathi Highlands&lt;/a&gt;. The Horde vendor for these items is outside the Horde Arathi Basin battleground entrance in &lt;a href=\"Hammerfall\"&gt;Hammerfall&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands\"&gt;Arathi Highlands&lt;/a&gt;. \nThough some of the Arathor and Defiler factions items have different names and artwork, equivalent items' bonuses and equip effects are identical. \"Highlander's\" items are Arathor items.\nThe bulk of the items are belts, boots, and shoulders tailored to various classes. More powerful versions of some items can be purchased as you gain levels, allowing higher level players to receive faction rewards with better equipment bonuses.\nSee &lt;a href=\"Honor%20rewards\"&gt;Honor rewards&lt;/a&gt; for other items which can be purchased with Honor Points."}

It's about the &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Basin\"&gt;Arathi Basin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"battleground\"&gt;battleground&lt;/a&gt; implemented in the game.\nThe original article, formerly located at http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/underdev/arathi.html, did not survive the overhaul of the World of Warcraft Official Website.\nArticle.\n&lt;a href=\"Ham%20%28priest%29\"&gt;Ham&lt;/a&gt; shivered in the cool evening air, rubbing his arms vigorously. &lt;a href=\"Priest\"&gt;Priest&lt;/a&gt;ly vestments were fine for the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Cathedral\"&gt;Stormwind Cathedral&lt;/a&gt;, but in the muddy foothills of this accursed &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Basin\"&gt;basin&lt;/a&gt;, he found himself wishing for a warm woolen sweater. Supplies such as wool were kept for the truly cold climes, not merely brisk ones such as Arathi, after the sun dipped below the horizon. At least the golden &lt;a href=\"tabard\"&gt;tabard&lt;/a&gt; draped over his torso brought some scant warmth.\nHe leaned against the flag post behind him and glanced back towards the &lt;a href=\"Blacksmith%20%28Arathi%20Basin%29\"&gt;smithy&lt;/a&gt;. His eyes could just barely discern the silhouettes of men within, working in as much light as they dared. Ham, however, was not built for heavy lifting, and so they'd \"asked\" him to make himself useful and watch out for any Defiler activity. He glared at the dusty windowpane. What he wouldn't give to be inside, out of the wind, preparing to leave this constant fear...\nA sudden rotten stench assailed his nostrils. The priest whipped around, slamming right into the mace aimed at his solar plexus. Its twin slammed into the side of his head a moment later. The wielder's glowing eyes narrowed as his rictus grin widened. Ham struggled to stay upright, trying to call to memory words of prayer that had saved his life before, but just as he straightened a spiked shield rammed into his side, throwing him a few feet away. Wordlessly the two assailants advanced on their prey, weapons raised to strike. As they closed in, Ham threw back his head, letting loose a primal scream focused on inspiring terror in the most stalwart of hearts.\nThe mace-bearing &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; let out a dry chuckle and leered as Ham ran out of breath. \"We don't scare easily,\" he rasped, before striking again.\n\"They got Ham, Sergeant Major,\" the dwarf whispered harshly, peering out the smeared glass as his gnarled hands busied themselves with loading his gun.\n&lt;a href=\"Sergeant%20Major%20Toban\"&gt;Sergeant Major Toban&lt;/a&gt; turned away from surveying the labor and approached the weathered &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;, squinting to make out the scene in the near-darkness outside. Two of the foul &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; creatures capered about their flag post as they tore down the proud banner of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; with their bony claws. Toban growled, barely keeping his temper in check. Such flagrant vandalism in plain view of his men showed either incredible stupidity or alarming arrogance. Considering how easily they had dispatched their lookout, though, he doubted they were idiots.\nHe touched the dwarf on the shoulder briefly, who responded with a slight nod. Assured that his front door guard was ready, Toban turned to the bustling activity occurring towards the back. His men were loading crates onto a supply wagon, crates that contained weapons, armor, and more mundane supplies such as nails and horseshoes. All were vital to keeping a large army fighting on the front lines. The Alliance had dire need of these resources on all fronts, and it was the duty of the &lt;a href=\"League%20of%20Arathor\"&gt;League of Arathor&lt;/a&gt;, to which Toban proudly belonged, to see they received their shipment.\nOf course, the League was not the only organization set on securing these supplies, the Sergeant Major reminded himself as he unsheathed the greatsword from its place on his back. The walking dead also sought the valuable goods that lay in Arathi Basin to fuel their own war effort. Their service here not only strengthened their own forces, but weakened the enemy as well... provided they could hold their position. \"Be on your guard,\" he murmured, glancing around the darkened smithy. The few men under his command left the task of loading and took up their weapons. No words were spoken besides the soft prayer to the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; from Toban's lips. As the last syllable faded, the troops of the League stood a little straighter, shoulders set. The Light was with them; their commanding officer would see them through.\nToban's ears caught a slight scraping against the wooden floor, and he turned towards the back entrance just in time to watch the well-laid trap of Hunter &lt;a href=\"Draig\"&gt;Draig&lt;/a&gt; spread frost oil over the stone floor. Ice formed immediately under the feet of the intruder, whose decaying feet slipped on the newly-slick surface. More curses sounded from behind in what was unmistakably &lt;a href=\"Gutterspeak\"&gt;Gutterspeak&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"NOW!\" the &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt; roared as he charged in the midst of the invaders. The air rang with the clash of steel, the crackle of flame, and the cries of the wounded. The acrid scent of gunpowder increased with every aimed shot from Draig's corner. Blood stained both the golden sigil of &lt;a href=\"Arathor\"&gt;Arathor&lt;/a&gt; and the grinning skull of the &lt;a href=\"Defilers\"&gt;Defilers&lt;/a&gt; as they fought feverishly in the enclosed space. Toban smiled grimly as the creature before him winced with every successful blow it landed; his prayers had been answered, and each strike was countered with the Light's power.\nSlowly, inexorably, they were pushing the invading force back. As they neared the door, a frightened horse's scream cut through the air. Draig leapt from his perch and dashed through the legs of the attackers, shoving them easily aside. The dwarf pushed through the last of them to find one of their cart horses dead, the other being assaulted mercilessly by one of the undead. Draig belted out a sharp whistle. Drawn by the noise, the horse attacker looked down at the dwarf, who waved with a smirk. Snarling, he advanced on the diminutive hunter, dagger clutched in his grasp. He was stopped by two long legs cannoning into his side. Shrieking in rage at its master being in danger, the &lt;a href=\"tallstrider\"&gt;tallstrider&lt;/a&gt; raked and stomped on its fallen foe relentlessly.\nThe unearthly shriek outside was the last straw for the Defilers. They gave one last half-hearted rush and then fled, disappearing into the scrub surrounding the hill.\n\"They'll be back,\" the gruff Draig said as he scratched his pet under its beak.\nToban nodded gravely. \"No doubt. But for now...\" he said, and walked around to the flag post. With care, he replaced the battered standard of the Alliance. \"For now, the smithy is ours.\"\nArathi Basin.\nArathi Basin, located in &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands\"&gt;Arathi Highlands&lt;/a&gt;, is a fast and exciting Battleground. The Basin itself is rich with resources and coveted by both the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and the Alliance. The Forsaken Defilers and the League of Arathor have arrived at Arathi Basin to wage war over these natural resources and claim them on behalf of their respective sides."}

Alliance players will appear in the League's camp at &lt;a href=\"Trollbane%20Hall\"&gt;Trollbane Hall&lt;/a&gt;, located in the northwest of the Basin. Horde players will appear in the southeast of the map in the &lt;a href=\"Defiler%27s%20Den\"&gt;Defiler's Den&lt;/a&gt;. \nDuring the two minutes or so prior to the start of the game, you should take care of the following things:\nAssaulting, Capturing, and Defending Nodes.\nThe status of nodes in Arathi Basin is indicated by a flag, which can be in one of five states (from your point of view):\nNeutral flags are white and Contested flags have a grey symbol of the assaulting faction on them. Captured/Lost flags are either red (Horde) or blue (Alliance).\nThe process of taking a Neutral or Lost flag is called \"assaulting\" the flag. Assaulting a flag is a simple matter:\nIf a Captured flag is successfully assaulted (the enemy survives the 8-second \"channeling\"), the flag will change to Enemy-Contested, and one of two things can happen:\nIn summary:\nTactics for Assaulting.\nSince the 8-second assault can be interrupted by damage, you either need to destroy all defending enemies or, at least, keep them off the assaulting player for 8 seconds. In general, assaulting a flag is a balance between the need to keep all enemies off the assaulting player and the need for a quick capture to cut off reinforcements from the graveyard. Here are some strategies for assaulting a flag:\nTactics for Defending.\nDefending a Captured node that is under assault boils down to \"damage the assaulting player\". Here are some strategies and tips on this tactic:\nRace/Class/Profession Specific Defense Tactics:\nBattle Strategies.\nThe information in this section will be old news to seasoned battleground guild members who, with training, experience, and often Ventrilo or similar voice comm software, will have mastered similar strategies and can use them to crush any pick-up game (PUG) team. However, if you are a PUG player and you can convince your teammates to use these strategies, you might just have a fighting chance.\nZerging.\nZerging - the practice of descending upon the enemy en masse to overwhelm them through sheer numbers - is the most basic of Arathi Basin strategies. It is unsubtle, lacks flair or finesse, and requires almost no skill to perform. Perfect for PUGs!\nTo zerg, you simply gather your entire team and move from node to node, utterly destroying anything in your path. Unless the enemy is also zerging, you are almost guaranteed to capture any node your amorphous blob of players comes across. At the same time, however, the nodes you leave behind are unprotected and can be ninja'd easily.\nTo be fair, a reasonably well-directed zerg could be successful against another PUG team, if they are not schooled in anti-Zerg strategy. The sight of 15 frothing enemies barreling down on your position is enough to send the weak of stomach into fits of \"/bg AGH!!!11 INC MY POssitION!!! HLP! HEEEELP!\" If your zerg can keep the other team in disarray through sheer fear, you may have three nodes against their two nodes just long enough to earn the win.\n\"(Note: the author of this section hasn't researched much zerg strategy; zerg experts please add your thoughts.)\"\n\"Added Info:\" Zerging is ineffective if the group move on from a captured node without retaining any defense. A good idea is to make the person who capped the node remain behind and alert the rest of the raid of incoming enemies. Thus the \"zerg\" effectively becomes a large mobile defense force.\nThis being said, zerging against even remotely experienced played can be highly detrimental \u2013 as the zerg can easily circumnavigate the map, capturing everything in its path, only to have said nodes taken back the moment they leave.\nFive-Five-Five (4-node option).\nThe \"5-5-5\" refers to the arrangement of the raid group into three groups of five players. This grouping is very common in Arathi Basin, as it makes good use of the five-player limit on groups, and provides for flexible positioning of fairly powerful groups of players.\nThe \"4-node option\" works basically as follows:\nAs mentioned before, SPEED and COORDINATION are keys here, as is STAYING IN YOUR ASSIGNED PLACE. For PUGs this is difficult because not everyone will have read this (or any other) basic strategy guide, and will want to go off hunting Honor Kills. Defending a captured flag can be boring, but remember that the winning team gets bonus honor, plus extra reputation that the losers don't get. Try to impress upon your group mates that staying put and keeping three (or four) nodes is more important than \"Pwn1ng\" someone on the other side.\nKeep your chat on /party most of the time, to coordinate with your group. Use /bg to communicate to the other groups from time to time about your status, or to call for backup in case of an enemy zerg or mini-zerg. It is important have a strong PUG raid leader to help keep the troops in line.\nFive-Five-Five (3-node option).\nThe \"3-node option\" works almost the same as the 4-node option, except that it concentrates on three nodes instead of four. The strategy works like this:\nThis strategy treats the Farm/Stables nodes with a bit more respect, as nobody likes to find that the enemy has back-doored him. It also keeps your forces in somewhat closer proximity, which enhances flexibility since forces can be repositioned more quickly. However, the strategy only sets out to gain a 3/2 advantage, which can result in a long slog through a battle that is nearly tied much of the time. Since the rate of resource accumulation increases non-linearly as you gain nodes (see below), the 4-node option of the 5-5-5 strategy has benefits beyond \"just one more node\".\nA possible blend of the two options could be successful. Start with the 4-node assault, hold it as long as you can to rack up resources at a 4/1 advantage, then fall back to a 3-node defense. As the enemy assaults your three nodes, the time you spend at a 2/3 disadvantage will be offset by the extra resources you gained during that initial 4/1 advantage.\nSeven/Seven And The Fat Kid.\nThis strategy is similar to the 3-node option in that it only gains three nodes initially, and it is also similar to the 4-node option in that it doesn't defend the Farm/Stables. Using this strategy, players blend in a mini-zerg element that makes it interesting.\nThe basic strategy:\nObviously, each group will not fit into a \"party\" within a raid group, so either there needs to be two raid groups set up, or a combination of parties within a raid group to make up each group of seven. The Fat Kid can be put into whatever group wants him.\nThe author has never participated in nor seen this strategy in action, so cannot comment much on its effectiveness. However, the benefit to the 7/7 strategy is that each group is a mini-zerg with respect to enemies using one of the 5-5-5 strategies. Your seven-player groups should be able to defeat any five-player enemy groups, and comfortably hold any node against anything short of a zerg.\nThe Fat Kid, after taking the Farm/Stables could be used as a lookout to direct the mini-zergs against the enemy, or he could join one of the groups.\n\"This is a great strategy. I have worked it into my premade raids with a twist. The raid needs to be set up into 5 raid groups. Here's the perspective from the Horde side. Group one is full, group 2 is full. group three will be 2 members, as well as group four. Group five is the fat kid defending the farm. Groups one and three go to Lumber Mill at the start, groups two and four go to Blacksmith. Groups three and four are designated for flag protection. So after Lumber Mill and Blacksmith are taken, groups one and two go to Stables as 10 members, probably outnumbering the Alliance again. The fat kid should be a warrior if you have one in your group. Reason being is since he/she is alone they can kill rats for rage. This pinches the Alliance into two places, the Mine and the starting Den. Best of luck.\"\nSix-Six and the Floating Three.\nThis is a variant on the Seven/Seven and Fat Kid strategy. This author has definitely seen it work extremely well against \"3-Zone\" (or 5-5-5). Groups are broken down into a 2x6+3 formation: two groups of six zerg the nodes that are being held by the 5-man teams, and hold them. The +3 group floats around, stealth capping the weaker nodes.\nThis technique relies on having even more speed and coordination than the 5-5-5 does, since it is even more fluid as there are two six-man groups need to float between three nodes.\nFive-Five-Five (Floating nodes option).\nSimilar to Five-Five-Five, but with more fluidity:\nThis technique requires some of the most precision and communication as all of them, since the two rearguard groups are constantly in motion. In this strategy, it is less necessary to hold the Blacksmith since the floating groups are sufficient to keep the enemy trapped in the Blacksmith if necessary.\nThe advantage of this technique is that on weaker and less coordinated enemies, it can be much faster as it affords a 5 node win.\nThree-Three-Three-Six.\nEach group of three should contain a high armor class, a healer and a DPS class. The group of six contains any class. \nThe first group of three moves to the Farm/Stables, caps and defends, where they remain for the rest of the game. \nGroups 2, 3 and 4 go together to capture the Blacksmith. After capture group 2 remains to defend.\nGroups 3 and 4 to together to capture the Lumber Mill. After capture group 3 remains to defend.\nGroup 4 (with six players) becomes a roaming defense group, assisting any nodes that need defense. \nThe strategy has the advantage of starting out as a Zerg which becomes smaller as more nodes are captured. The roaming six-man defense has quick access to the three controlled nodes by ignoring the mine. The three man defense teams are well suited to taking on unorganized groups even if they are outnumbered.\nTake Three and Hold.\nA common misconception is that the \"Take Three and Hold\" strategy is a sure win. In fact, it is almost certainly a losing strategy. Holding three flags will not work well unless the opposing team is exceptionally uncoordinated. If your team is doing a \"Five Five Five\" (see above), you are susceptible to any of the other attack methods. The only three bases that lend themselves to this strategy are the farm, black smith, and lumber mill. Looking at the map will show that the road nexus between these three points make it very easy to move troops between them. This makes it very important for the alliance side to keep the horde from getting the blacksmith and makes it equally important for the horde side to get the farm and black smith as quickly as possible.\nTake for example, you have five troops defending each of your three flag points, and you do no further assaults. The opposing team will have fifteen troops, needs no defense (as you are not assaulting), so all fifteen troops are available for offense. They can do two seven-man assaults and will hold four nodes, or they could do one zerg, and will sweep the board, taking each of your points one after another. If your teams only strategy is \"take three and hold\", you have no defensive strategy.\nThere is a way around this issue however. Using a 4,4,4,3 strategy, using three to distract the opponent by assaulting their stables/farm, you can easily gain a significant lead by holding the three (LM, GM, ST for alliance; LM, GM, Fm for horde). I find it the most effective way to win as long as the troops listen. The only issue with the above tactics is that the blacksmith is involved in most of them. It is actually a very vulnerable target, with access by water from all sides. Whilst it can give a significant offensive advantage, it is not worth battling over several times, when you could be providing more forces for other tasks. A major must-have for this strategy for alliance is the gold mine. It allows access to your stables easily, and if this falls then the strategy is routed.\nPlease, encourage your PUG teams to read this guide, and become familiar with a variety of the above strategies.\nFive Four Five and The Ninja.\nThis strategy is based on surprising the enemy to give you the \"Grind-at-Spawn\"-mode on. You make 4 different groups for assaulting one base each. \nGroup 1: 4 dps, 1 healer. Caps Lumber Mill, leaves 2 dps behind (preferably a rogue) and attacks stables/farm.\nGroup 2: 3 dps, 1 healer. Caps Blacksmith, leaves 1 healer and 1 dps behind and attacks stables/farm.\nGroup 3: 4 dps, 1 healer. Caps Gold Mine, leaves 2 dps behind and attacks stables/farm.\nGroup 4: 1 Rogue, caps Farm/Stables and stealths protecting it.\nIt's all about making the surprise attack, when all 5 bases are taken just farm them out, don't let them leave their own base.\nAccumulating Resources.\nResources accumulate at the rates shown in the table below.\nSo if your team has three nodes, their team has two nodes, and they lead 1400 to 1300, you can still win if no nodes change hands. But if your team is at 1200 you cannot win unless you gain control of four nodes.\nOther Strategic Elements.\nThere are a few general strategic considerations for battles in Arathi Basin which can be used to flavor your preferred overall battle strategy.\nStart with a strategy.\nIf you join a game where the players have no strategy you can and should suggest one. Having some strategy is better than every man for himself.\nBe Vocal.\nNot everyone has read this strategy guide, and some strategy and tactics are difficult to realize without being told. If you tell your raid \"We should try to fight at the flags instead of leaving them vulnerable\" you might improve your whole raid group's success rate. The same is true of warning your raid of incoming attacks or vulnerable nodes.\nGraveyards Are Your Friends.\nWhen you capture a node, the nearby graveyard becomes usable by your faction. Since you WILL die during the battle, having a forward graveyard to resurrect at will help immensely with flexibility of your forces. Occasionally, the node will change to contested soon after you die, and you will have to resurrect at the closest secured node.\nThe Blacksmith - Vital Node?\nSitting right in the middle of the map with two bridges that may function as choke points leading away from it, the Blacksmith is an important node to capture and hold. Having a central graveyard is very useful, as is having a staging point from which you can launch sorties to the Lumber Mill and Gold Mine. In most games, the Blacksmith and its bridges tend to be the sites of the most furious battles.\nThere are also defensive strategies considering the bridges (when the Blacksmith is capped by your faction). &lt;a href=\"Hunter\"&gt;Hunter&lt;/a&gt;s should be active with laying Frost Traps on the bridges since they will slow down the enemy faction considerably due to the narrow space the enemy faction has to move over. &lt;a href=\"Shaman\"&gt;Shaman&lt;/a&gt;s should lay totems all around on the bridges. If a &lt;a href=\"Warlock\"&gt;Warlock&lt;/a&gt; is using a Imp, it can lead the Imp to the hills besides the bridge, switch it onto 'Stay' and then setting it on 'aggressive'. This way it will be like a turret at the bridge. This doesn't work as well with the other minions since the Imp is the only long range minion the warlocks have.\nAlternately, by allowing the enemy to hold the Blacksmith, it is possible to keep them penned in. One strategy involves giving up the Blacksmith to the initial zerg, capping the outer ring of nodes, then leaving a few defenders and keeping the enemy confined to the Blacksmith.\nGo Where Your Enemy Isn't.\nThere is a limited number of people in AB at any one time, so always be aware of where the enemy is. If they zerg, say the blacksmith, with 7 or 8 people, they have only that number split between the other 4 nodes. Instead of wasting your forces fighting a superior force, consider letting them take the node and hitting elsewhere instead. Ideally everywhere else, often resulting in 4/1 flags in your favour.\nStay for the minute.\nAlways stay for the minute until the node shifts to your side. Having a node undefended is a huge blow in a typical AB game. A stealthed character can simply tap the flag after you leave to undo all your hard work as enemies immediately start spawning there. A stealthed rogue can sap a lone defender left behind too, so don't think that just leaving one person is sufficient.\nAttack in groups.\nRunning into a defended node alone will surely get you killed. It is much more effective to wait at a crossroad for a small group to form. Attacking as a group will greatly improve your chances of capturing a node. Tell your raid that you want to form a group near your objective and attack at the same time in order to coordinate with other players.\nStable/Farm Disease.\nThe flag closest to your teams starting area may seem to hold some special significance. It does not! The object of the game is to control more flags than the other team, not any particular one. If this flag is heavily defended by the other team, you are best served going elsewhere. Seeing the stable/farm as friendly territory that must be defended at the expense of all other flags is one of the surest and most common ways to lose AB. If you spawn at the top of the hill while your closest base is heavily guarded you have no choice but to escape to other areas. Try to get some of the enemy guards to chase you. Dying over and over again out of the gate is not helpful.\nRat Rage &amp; The Farm.\nWarriors tend to make excellent guards at the Farm. Due to the perpetual spawning of rat critters, Warriors guarding the Farm can ensure that their Rage bar is full by whacking vermin while on guard duty.\nThe Two Crossroads.\nOn the horde side, the crossroads linking Farm, BS, and LM is an important staging area, allowing quick response to three vital nodes. On the alliance side, the crossroad leads to Stables, BS, and the Gold Mine, but a look at the map will show that the alliances' crossroads is farther from their home base (stables) than the horde's is to theirs (farm). In many rounds, this leaves the most intense fighting at the blacksmith, leaving the outer nodes to ninjas and smaller tactical groups.\nFeatherweights.\nA quick note to all mages and priests in Arathi Basin. Bring Light Feathers! Seriously, Slow Fall and Levitate is incredibly helpful in this battleground. If you're at the Blacksmith and the Gold Mine's being attacked, you can Slow Fall and jump down to help them, without going all the way round or losing any health. You can also, if you're at the Lumber Mill, cast Slow Fall, then mount up, and take a running jump off the cliff. Time it right and it's possible to end up a couple of meters away from the flag, or, if you don't trust your timing, aim for the ramp which will be on your left. It's a great trick, and can be great fun to use. Know what spells you can cast while moving as you'll be able to while falling and this makes for a very fun bombing run. It also provides a great means of escape from pursuers. For example, if a large group of enemies assaults the lumber mill that you are defending then it might be best to retreat and capture a less defended node. You can laugh with glee as you deny them an extra honorable kill.\nNon-Projectile Spells.\nSome spells, such as Fire Blast, Arcane Blast, Mind Blast, Scorch, Searing Pain and the Warlock's damage-over-times (like Corruption and Curse of Agony) have no projectile. Also, certain channeled spells (such as Blizzard and Rain of Fire) do not give away their caster's position. That being said, hiding beneath a river and nuking an unsuspecting target is occasionally viable against one or two defenders. Coupled with Unending Breath, a well placed mage or warlock could nuke defenders out of the Blacksmith or AoE a zerg with relative impunity.\nLookout Mill.\nThe Lumber Mill is perched on a high cliff that overlooks the entire area, and without the aid of someone there or a long range sight ability (such as a Shaman's Far Sight) it can be used as a decent lookout and staging point. This can be especially advantageous to players with high end computers and have their terrain distance graphics setting set to Max, as they can pretty much see the entire playing field and where the enemy is moving. It can be even more advantageous if the side controlling it has the Blacksmith and Farm, as they can perch one or two people up there and at the other nodes and keep the rest of the players at the crossroads, allowing for fast defensive moves. The Horde has the advantage of this ploy as the Farm is right next to their starting point, but the Alliance can easily pull it off as well with coordination, and a willingness to sacrifice the Stables.\nWater Walk to Blacksmith.\nAt the start of the game, a shaman can cast &lt;a href=\"Water%20Walking\"&gt;Water Walking&lt;/a&gt; on the team to get to the BS very quickly. Consider getting &lt;a href=\"Glyph%20of%20Water%20Walking\"&gt;Glyph of Water Walking&lt;/a&gt; and buffing your teammates while in preparation."}

Objectives for timed quests default to High. User created objectives default to Highest.\nQuestHelper will try to arrange the objectives so that higher priority objectives get done first. The only time this won't happen is when an objective with a higher priority depends on an objective with a lower priority, in which case QuestHelper will pretend it had the higher priority. You will notice a green arrow in the priority menu when QuestHelper isn't using the priority you assigned.\nYou can use priorities as hints to get the objectives in an order you'd prefer, without the need to micro-manage the route list. \nFilters.\nThere are 3 filters you can use to automatically ignore quests, which you can turn on and off using the slash command /qh filter.\nThe first filter is level, which by default is on. It will cause QuestHelper to ignore any objectives that your current party probably isn't high enough to complete. You can adjust the level offset used by this filter with the command /qh level offset.\nThe next filter is zone, which by default is off. It will cause QuestHelper to ignore any objectives that aren't in your current zone. Note that this filter might not do the right thing for objectives that can be completed in multiple zones.\nThe last filter is done, which by default is off. It will hide objectives for any quests that aren't complete. You can use this if you don't want to quest and just want to turn your completed quests in.\nYou can force QuestHelper to show an objective that otherwise would have been filtered by typing /qh hidden and selecting Show from its entry in the menu. \nSharing.\nSharing allows you to share your objectives with other party members, allowing you to combine your routes and work together effectively.\nNote that sharing only tells your peers what objectives you have, your completion progress for them, and the priorities you have assigned to them. Information such as item drops and monster locations are not shared.\nEach peer will take this information and calculate their own route from it. Assuming you stay together and work cooperatively, which was the whole idea behind this feature, your routes should end up being almost completely identical, and you can follow it and rest assured that nobody is getting left behind. Objectives shared by multiple users won't be removed until everybody has completed it.\nUser objectives, by default, aren't shared. If there is somebody available to share with, an option will appear in the right-click menu for that objective to allow you to share it manually.\nObjective priorities are shared globally. If one user changes the priority of an objective, that change will be reflected in all peers. This, again, was done to ensure that everybody's routes end up being roughly identical, and so that peers would have the correct priorities for timed quests.\nFAQ.\nWhy aren't my quests showing up?\n/qh hidden will list everything that isn't being shown, along with the reason for it being hidden.\nHow can I get rid of that arrow over my character's head?\n/qh cartwp will hide the arrow. If you'd rather move it instead, you can drag it around by left-clicking; unless it's been locked, in which case right-click on it and unlock it first.\nHow do get that 3D arrow pointing where to go?\nThat arrow is part of &lt;a href=\"Cartographer\"&gt;Cartographer&lt;/a&gt; Waypoints. It should appear automatically as long as Cartographer is installed and running, and you haven't turned off that feature.\nThe Icons on my map are huge! How can anyone see anything?\nIf you find the icons are too big for you, you may enter /qh scale X%, replacing X with some reasonable scale. I'd start with 80%, depending on how that looks you can try bigger or smaller numbers.\nMy FPS dropped after installing QH\nYou can adjust the performance of QH by using the perf command. The default perf is 1.\nYou can adjust the performance incrementally until you find the right blalance of FPS and QH performance.\nI recommend starting with 50% and adjusting by +/- .05 until you find the right balance.\n/qh perf 0.5\nBugs.\nThis addon has been causing Assertion Failed! errors for many players. This will cause errors when exiting [World of Warcraft], including:\nThese have been confirmed by the [Blizzard Poster] Radoslawn, on the official WoW forums. &lt;a href=\"http%3A//forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html%3FtopicId%3D6441116352%26amp%3Bsid%3D1\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\nThis addon has also caused a lot of problems for players who log off in Dalaran and try to log in with QuestHelper on while being in Dalaran.\nA common solution to this problem is to just turn QuestHelper off, go to another major city and log out and turn it back on if the addon is still needed.\nSolution.\nTo fix the Assertion Failed error follow these steps:\nNote: Deleting your WTF and INTERFACE folders will cause you to lose most of your WoW and Addon settings. You can place these folders back into their proper spot in your WoW directory if the problem stops.\nIf this problem persists, your best bet is to make a post on the World of Warcraft Forums or just remove QuestHelper.\nVideo Guides.\n&lt;Youtube&gt;H2SuGlsoxpg&lt;/Youtube&gt;"}

A quest which have to be completed in order to access another quest is referred to as a \"prerequisite\", while a quest which becomes available after completing other quests is referred to as a \"followup\" / \"follow-up\". Quest chains are fairly common in \"World of Warcraft\", albeit most of them being short. Most only consist of two to three quests, but some may include more than ten.

A silver exclamation point () above a quest giver shows a quest that will not be available to you for a few more levels.

Usually, you need to right-click the item or fixed device to get the quest. Items like this will usually say \"This Item Begins a Quest\" in their tooltip.

Its tooltip will say \"Quest Item\".\nTechnically, \"Quest Item\" is one of several values for item's binding property, other being \"&lt;a href=\"Bind%20on%20Pickup\"&gt;Binds when picked up&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Bind%20on%20Equip\"&gt;Binds when equipped&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Bind%20on%20Use\"&gt;Binds when used&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Bind%20to%20Account\"&gt;Binds to account&lt;/a&gt;\". They act like soulbound items and cannot be sold, traded or put on &lt;a href=\"Auction%20House\"&gt;Auction House&lt;/a&gt;. However, there are significant number of items used for quests but not marked as \"Quest Item\".\nSome quest items are considered &lt;a href=\"party%20loot\"&gt;party loot&lt;/a&gt;. If a quest asks you to retrieve something by killing a specific target, and looting his head for example, that head will be able to be picked up by the entire group; making that item party loot. This also applies for quest items where the loot is set to Free for All, and only one of the users currently has the quest, so if the player without the quest would loot the NPC first, the other player would still be able to retrieve the quest item.\nNotes.\nIf players delete any quest item from their bags before turning in the associated quest, the quest will automatically be abandoned. This occurs even if the item deleted is in excess of that needed to complete the quest."}

They have razor sharp spines protruding from their muscular, hunched backs. These resilient, fearless creatures inhabit the central &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt; of Kalimdor in the labyrinthine maze of thorns called &lt;a href=\"Razorfen%20Downs\"&gt;Razorfen Downs&lt;/a&gt;. Among them, the &lt;a href=\"quilboar%20brute\"&gt;quilboar brute&lt;/a&gt;s are larger and more powerful male quilboar changed by a special ritual.\nHistory.\nThe quilboar were abundant before the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;.\nTen thousand years ago, during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, the mighty demigod &lt;a href=\"Agamaggan\"&gt;Agamaggan&lt;/a&gt; came forth to battle the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Though the colossal &lt;a href=\"boar\"&gt;boar&lt;/a&gt; fell in combat, his actions helped save &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; from ruin. Yet over time, in the areas where his blood fell, massive thorn-ridden vines sprouted from the earth. The quilboar, believed to be the mortal offspring of the mighty god, came to occupy these regions and hold them sacred. The heart of these thorn-colonies was known as the \"&lt;a href=\"Razorfen%20Kraul\"&gt;Razorfen&lt;/a&gt;\".\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt; as the centuries passed the quilboar reappeared and flourished in the land.\nNew arrivals.\nThe quilboar would eventually settle within the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt; and wage war against the other races living within the region, like the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt;. This way of life would move forward without incident until the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;. Under the guidance of a &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;mysterious prophet&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; left &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. Soon after landing on Kalimdor the Horde would quickly befriend the tauren and make enemies of the quilboar who attacked them on sight. Generally treating the quilboar as a nuisance, the Horde fought them when provoked but striking against the quilboar was not a top priority. However, &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;circumstances&lt;/a&gt; did force &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt; and his companions to seemingly wipe out a &lt;a href=\"tribe\"&gt;tribe&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Beast%20Den\"&gt;Beast Den&lt;/a&gt; some time after the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Battle of Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;.\nBefore the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s came, the quilboar were more common in the land that would become &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;.\nModern times.\nYears after the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the quilboar tribes made their homes throughout &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;, and the Barrens and defended their territory, while striking out against the Horde. While most tribes were independent, the &lt;a href=\"Razorfen%20tribe\"&gt;Razorfen tribe&lt;/a&gt; entered into an alliance with the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, who have &lt;a href=\"Death%27s%20Head%20tribe\"&gt;bolstered&lt;/a&gt; their forces with them and allowed &lt;a href=\"Amnennar%20the%20Coldbringer\"&gt;Amnennar the Coldbringer&lt;/a&gt; to transform &lt;a href=\"Razorfen%20Downs\"&gt;Razorfen Downs&lt;/a&gt; into a Scourge stronghold.\nCataclysm.\nIn the wake of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; a group of quilboar raided Horde water supplies due to their own being cut off. &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Warchief Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; led a &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron\"&gt;Kor'kron&lt;/a&gt; strike team against but the quilboar proved to be too numerous for them to handle and the Warchief and his men were timely intervention of &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; and his forces. With the quilboar on the heels, the Horde was forced to retreat out of the tunnels where upon reaching &lt;a href=\"Hamuul%20Runetotem\"&gt;Hamuul Runetotem&lt;/a&gt; caused water to pour from a gash in the earth. While many of the quilboar were swept down, others were merely knocked to the ground. However, due to having a now-active water source, this group of quilboar was seemingly convinced to cease hostilities against the Horde and both sides returned to their homes.\nDespite reaching peace with one tribe, the other quilboar tribes have used the Cataclysm to their advantage by &lt;a href=\"Thornsnarl\"&gt;expanding&lt;/a&gt; their territory and launching full out assault against &lt;a href=\"Grol%27dom%20Farm\"&gt;Horde holdings&lt;/a&gt;. In response, the Horde has enlisted new recruits to combat the renewed quilboar assaults, with counter-attacks resulting in the deaths of quilboar leaders. &lt;a href=\"Charlga%20Razorflank\"&gt;Charlga Razorflank&lt;/a&gt; manipulated her followers into attacking other races by lying to them that they needed blood to revive Agamaggan. Meanwhile &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20of%20Agamaggan\"&gt;Agamaggan's Spirit&lt;/a&gt; has returned to Azeroth and instructs adventurers to put an end to the Razorfen leadership within the &lt;a href=\"Razorfen%20Kraul\"&gt;Razorfen Kraul&lt;/a&gt; for allying with the Scourge.\nTraveler.\nAt some point after the Cataclysm, a Razorfen quilboar named &lt;a href=\"Shagtusk\"&gt;Shagtusk&lt;/a&gt; tried to use the &lt;a href=\"dryad\"&gt;dryad&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Taryndrella\"&gt;Taryndrella&lt;/a&gt; to purify the cursed place of &lt;a href=\"Razorfen%20Downs\"&gt;Razorfen Downs&lt;/a&gt;. Both were captured by &lt;a href=\"Chugara%20Razorflank\"&gt;Chugara Razorflank&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Death%20Speaker%20Blackthorn\"&gt;Death Speaker Blackthorn&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Aramar%20Thorne\"&gt;Aramar Thorne&lt;/a&gt; and his group of friends then entered the Downs and with the help of Shagtusk located Chugara and Blackthorn in the &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Pile\"&gt;Bone Pile&lt;/a&gt;. Blackthorn tried to raise &lt;a href=\"Amnennar%20the%20Coldbringer\"&gt;Amnennar the Coldbringer&lt;/a&gt; and sacrifice Drella to the lich but the effort was ultimately thwarted by &lt;a href=\"Reigol%20Valdread\"&gt;Reigol Valdread&lt;/a&gt;.\nA handful of nomadic quilboar tribes live in the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Forest\"&gt;Last Forest&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Desolace\"&gt;Desolace&lt;/a&gt;.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20in%20Draenor\"&gt;war in Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Auld%20Stonespire\"&gt;Auld Stonespire&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"spirit%20of%20Agamaggan\"&gt;spirit of Agamaggan&lt;/a&gt; directed the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to deal with the quilboar in &lt;a href=\"Razorfen%20Kraul\"&gt;Razorfen Kraul&lt;/a&gt;.\nLater, the &lt;a href=\"red%20dragon\"&gt;red dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Koristrasza\"&gt;Koristrasza&lt;/a&gt; and adventurers entered the &lt;a href=\"Razorfen%20Downs\"&gt;Razorfen Downs&lt;/a&gt; once again to kill the undead quilboar, including &lt;a href=\"Death%20Speaker%20Blackthorn\"&gt;Death Speaker Blackthorn&lt;/a&gt;, whose death resurrected &lt;a href=\"Amnennar%20the%20Coldbringer\"&gt;Amnennar the Coldbringer&lt;/a&gt;.\nExile's Reach.\nPrior to the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the quilboar on &lt;a href=\"Exile%27s%20Reach\"&gt;Exile's Reach&lt;/a&gt; were encountered by both &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; expeditions to the island. In the &lt;a href=\"Quilboar%20Briarpatch\"&gt;Quilboar Briarpatch&lt;/a&gt;, they were performing a necromantic ritual on expedition captives. They worked under the &lt;a href=\"Darkmaul\"&gt;Darkmaul&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s that ruled the island.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Briarback%20tribe\"&gt;Briarback tribe&lt;/a&gt; could be found in &lt;a href=\"Stormsong%20Valley\"&gt;Stormsong Valley&lt;/a&gt;, on &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;. They had moved out of &lt;a href=\"Briarback%20Kraul\"&gt;Briarback Kraul&lt;/a&gt; and began attacking the farmers at the &lt;a href=\"Amber%20Waves\"&gt;Amber Waves&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Bristlemane%20tribe\"&gt;Bristlemane tribe&lt;/a&gt; live on the island of &lt;a href=\"Un%27gol%20Ruins\"&gt;Un'gol Ruins&lt;/a&gt;, and were encountered by the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s during the &lt;a href=\"Island%20Expedition\"&gt;Island Expedition&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAppearance.\nQuilboar are upright porcine humanoids that are fairly short in height, their model in \"World of Warcraft\" depicting them roughly around 4 to 5 feet. Their most notable feature is a set of razor sharp spines running alongside their back which sometimes grows at the top of the head to form a \"hairstyle\". \"Warcraft III\" depicts basic quilboar soldiers as able to detach their quills to use them as projectiles, whilst their unarmed animations in \"World Of Warcraft\" have them extend their spines to attack. The names of quilboar tribes often reference their spines, such as the Bristleback tribe.\n\"Battle for Azeroth\" introduced a larger model for quilboar males called the &lt;a href=\"quilboar%20brute\"&gt;quilboar brute&lt;/a&gt;.\nCulture.\nQuilboar are known for their fearlessness and savagery. Believed to be the mortal descendants of the demigod Ancient &lt;a href=\"Agamaggan\"&gt;Agamaggan&lt;/a&gt;, they have clashed with other races, such as the &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt;, over land and food. They build their homes among the colossal, thorn-covered vines, believed to have been grown from the blood of Agamaggan, that make up their colonies. The most prominent of these are &lt;a href=\"Razorfen%20Kraul\"&gt;Razorfen Kraul&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Razorfen%20Downs\"&gt;Razorfen Downs&lt;/a&gt; in Kalimdor, home to &lt;a href=\"Razorfen%20tribe\"&gt;Razorfen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Death%27s%20Head%20tribe\"&gt;Death's Head&lt;/a&gt; tribes respectively. As such, the thorns are considered sacred. The quilboar of &lt;a href=\"Stormsong%20Valley\"&gt;Stormsong Valley&lt;/a&gt; store &lt;a href=\"Bramble%20Pod\"&gt;bramble pods&lt;/a&gt; safely and later use thornweaving magic and seemingly human blood to feed and grow them.\nQuilboar are fiercely loyal to their tribe and defend their territory with reckless ferocity. Though &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s are highly prized in quilboar society, a powerful &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; often rules quilboar tribes.\nThe orcs suspects that the quilboar of the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt; often intentionally frighten flocks of &lt;a href=\"tallstrider\"&gt;tallstrider&lt;/a&gt;s into the path of &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; caravans just prior to an ambush.\n&lt;a href=\"Boar\"&gt;Boar&lt;/a&gt;s are revered within quilboar culture, and particularly large and tenacious ones are seen as a favor from Agamaggan.\nThe quilboar in the Barrens are protective of the water in the area. Even a small water source is a vast hoard of wealth to them. They have great feasts when even the slightest rain comes to the Barrens. Water is sacred to their kind because it is so scarce.\nThe quilboar have their own &lt;a href=\"language\"&gt;tongue&lt;/a&gt;, which apparently involves squealing, grumbling and grunting in low guttural tones.\nThey eat codfish like the &lt;a href=\"Rockscale%20Cod\"&gt;rockscale&lt;/a&gt;, but some even eat boar jerky.\nOne respectful greeting gesture of the quilboar is to snort loudly. They are known to decorate their tusks with war paint and intricate patterns.\nAlthough centaur, tauren, and quilboar all hate each other, the three races come together to do trade at &lt;a href=\"Flayers%27%20Point\"&gt;Flayers' Point&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Desolace\"&gt;Desolace&lt;/a&gt;. But there is no love lost between them, and brawls erupt like clockwork every five minutes, earning the trading post the nickname \"Slayers' Point\".\nMagic.\nQuilboar practice &lt;a href=\"geomancer\"&gt;geomancy&lt;/a&gt;, a crude form of &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;ism. Some plagued quilboar practice this form of magic even in undeath. Quilboar society regards the reading of stones and crystals as the highest form of shamanism.\nThe shaman and geomancers of the quilboar tribes call upon the strength of &lt;a href=\"Agamaggan\"&gt;Agamaggan&lt;/a&gt; to help them in battle and in their rituals. It is said that &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Shard\"&gt;Blood Shard&lt;/a&gt;s, which used to be found all over the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt;, were formed from the blood of Agamaggan, and quilboar of the &lt;a href=\"Bristleback%20tribe\"&gt;Bristleback tribe&lt;/a&gt; dig them up for strength in battle and as totems for their magics. A quilboar tribe's greatest shaman are named prophets of Agamaggan. Calling upon the power of their demigod ancestor, these prophets may summon boar spirits to aid them in battle much as other shaman call upon &lt;a href=\"spirit%20wolf\"&gt;spirit wolves&lt;/a&gt;.\nSettlements.\nIn the lands they come from, quilboar live in the shade and protection of huge thorned roots. When they move, their &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; seed and grow new roots for them to live in. These thorns mar the land and choke out other life, turning the earth around them barren. The quilboar tribes flock to the thorny areas throughout the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt; because they are holy places, but none as holy as &lt;a href=\"Razorfen%20Kraul\"&gt;Razorfen&lt;/a&gt;. Agamaggan's body makes up the entirety of the Razorfen, but the &lt;a href=\"Razorfen%20Downs\"&gt;Downs&lt;/a&gt; are especially protected because the entrance is made from his great maw.\nThe great mass of &lt;a href=\"Razorfen%20Kraul\"&gt;Razorfen Kraul&lt;/a&gt; was conquered by the old crone, &lt;a href=\"Charlga%20Razorflank\"&gt;Charlga Razorflank&lt;/a&gt;. Under her rule, the shamanistic quilboar stage attacks on rival tribes as well as &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; villages.\nCrafted from the same mighty vines as the Kraul, &lt;a href=\"Razorfen%20Downs\"&gt;Razorfen Downs&lt;/a&gt; was the traditional &lt;a href=\"capital%20city\"&gt;capital city&lt;/a&gt; of the quilboar race. However, when &lt;a href=\"Charlga%20Razorflank\"&gt;Charlga Razorflank&lt;/a&gt; rose to power, she allied with the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; and now the &lt;a href=\"city\"&gt;city&lt;/a&gt; is inhabited by the Scourge &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; and Charlga's &lt;a href=\"Death%27s%20Head%20tribe\"&gt;Death's Head tribe&lt;/a&gt;. The crone rules the bulk of the quilboar race, however, from the Kraul.\nThe two feuding quilboar tribes encountered in the Barrens are the &lt;a href=\"Razormane%20tribe\"&gt;Razormanes&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Bristleback%20tribe\"&gt;Bristlebacks&lt;/a&gt;. The quilboar occupying Razorfen Downs under the control of &lt;a href=\"Amnennar%20the%20Coldbringer\"&gt;Amnennar the Coldbringer&lt;/a&gt; are the Death's Head tribe and &lt;a href=\"Razorfen%20tribe\"&gt;Razorfen tribe&lt;/a&gt;. Quilboar can be found throughout &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;.\nAccording to tauren &lt;a href=\"brave\"&gt;brave&lt;/a&gt;s who fight them, the quilboar are willing to do anything to save their bramble homes, even throw away their best fighters.\nIn the RPG.\nIntroduction.\nThey have long since battled for the rights of their lands against the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s since their immigration from the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;. Many people simply call them \"boar men\".\nQuilboar are primitive, resilient, fearless creatures who inhabit the central &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt; of Kalimdor in the labyrinthine maze of thorns called &lt;a href=\"Razorfen%20Downs\"&gt;Razorfen Downs&lt;/a&gt;. After the War of the Ancients and the subsequent Sundering of the world, the quilboars' surroundings became increasingly hostile. Forced to fight for food and precious land against both &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt;, they developed into aggressive and efficient warriors. Though well able to handle themselves in a one-on-one battle, they are not above striking from ambush or even sacrificing themselves to destroy even one of their many enemies.\nCulture.\nThe quilboar are a scattered people. After centuries of aggression against the tauren, the centaur, and any other species that stood in their way, they no longer have a land to call their own. They are terrorists and thugs living on the fringes of other societies, claiming slivers of bloodstained territory from weaker settlers. In quilboar society, strength is highly valued. Female children and sickly male children are often abandoned, left to fend for themselves or to die at the claws of beasts. Family is important, but only as a source of more warriors to drive against the enemies. Almost from birth, young quilboar are indoctrinated with teachings of hatred for other sapient species. The quilboar hold no distinction between politics and religion. Their ultimate leaders are also their religious leaders. Bands are always led by shaman. Smaller groups are led by the strongest warrior, often referred to as a brute. Only rarely will more than one quilboar warband be found in a single geographic area, unless under the leadership of a particularly charismatic shaman or other strong leader. There is no known quilboar king, though those few tribes large enough to claim distinct names do have shamans of great power and influence who act as tribal leaders. The laws that govern the quilboar are simple.\nFor the tribe to survive, the quilboar must breed and the females must bear and protect worthy offspring. Each member has his or her role in the tribal structure. As a whole, the quilboar are a male-dominated species. Even though rarely seen by other species, their females must constantly keep their heads, faces, and quills covered. Otherwise, they are allowed no other ornamentation and can be killed on sight for touching a weapon (although this is not always the case). Females feel no resentment over this fact, and, indeed, the males do not see themselves as superior. Quilboar males grow taller, heavier, and stronger than females. A typical quilboar male grows to 5-1/2 feet tall and weighs 225 pounds; a typical female grows to 5 feet tall and weighs 150 pounds. For this reason, only males take up the path of warrior. Female quilboar possess such strong tribal instincts that most do not even desire to follow the males' path. Occasionally, a female decides that her place is in battle, if the woman can prove herself this is fine. In fact, these women are respected. On occasion, a female child displays such unnatural strength that the shaman deems her a man. She then trains as a warrior and lives in all ways like a male, even taking female mates. Tribal legend holds that such unions have occasionally produced an exceptional quilboar warrior (though no scholar has confirmed the tale), so there is little or no stigma attached to such situations. Among shamans there is no gender bias; many women walk the path of shaman. Shamans are so respected that most hold positions of power in the tribe, and many in certain tribes lead.\nWomen and children must defer to adult males. Adult males must defer to any quilboar they cannot defeat in personal combat. All must defer to a shaman. Punishment for failing to defer properly can be quite severe. The loss of a hand or an eye is common, though death is not unheard of, particularly for females or males who can no longer hold their own in combat. Quilboar punishments are intended purely to cull the weak. Rather than die on a sick bed or as a result of punishment, aging warriors will often hurl themselves against enemies they know they cannot defeat.\nA ferocious, suicidally brave race with an alien mentality and a slavish devotion to their tribe, quilboar defend their territory with a zeal bordering on fanaticism. They care only for ensuring the survival of their species, to the point where weaker quilboar gladly sacrifice themselves for the benefit of others. Outsiders see quilboar as stupid, vicious, piglike predators. In truth, quilboar possess a rigid social structure and deeply law-abiding personalities. The only laws they value, however, are their own. Quilboar are born with an instinctive drive to preserve their species. Quilboar always want more territory so that they may increase the size of their tribe; for this reason, they act like bullies, constantly threatening and harassing their neighbors.\nDue to the rigors of their society, quilboar offspring grow up quickly. A quilboar reaches maturity almost as soon as he can walk and hold a spear, usually about three years after birth. Quilboar mothers take no care to coddle their children, so sickly infants usually die. Quilboar do not form family units; the females compete for the attention of the strongest males, and the entire tribe tends to the infants. To form the best possible tribe, quilboar squash internal jealousies and rivalries harshly. All must cooperate to ensure the tribe's well-being. Weak, crippled, and elderly quilboar who feel they can no longer aid the tribe seek death. Quilboar have no need to execute their infirm \u2014 the elderly destroy themselves out of a desire to aid the tribe. Most seek death in battle, but when doing so is not an option, they take their own lives by wandering into the wilderness, hoping to slay at least one beast that may have posed some threat to the tribe. Quilboar do not frown upon this ritual form of suicide; rather, the tribe views it as an act of bravery and devotion.\nIn fact, quilboar tribes often hold festive ceremonies when a member announces his intention of \u201ctaking the walk,\u201d in honor of the coming sacrifice. Females almost always commit ritual suicide once past childbearing age. Quilboar believe that their afterlife holds security and comfort for their race. They enter a realm where all the land belongs to the quilboar and no enemies seek to destroy them. All fight with strength and bravery, battling monsters and prey for amusement. Quilboar revere Agamaggan \u2014 an ancient, boar-like Eternal associated with the night elves \u2014 believing him to be the progenitor of their race. Where his blood spilled, it is told, patches of enormous briars sprouted to serve as homes to the quilboar. These dens still exist. \nQuilboar shaman teach that the law of the wild is the standard by which all tribal members must live \u2014 survival of the fittest. When a predator culls the weak from the herd, it is cause for celebration. Those that die do so gladly, knowing that even in death they have contributed to the success of the tribe. Despite their low intelligence, quilboar possess good common sense. At least one quilboar every generation walks the path of the shaman. Quilboar never seek to become shaman, but a few are awarded the right to study with their elders when visited by dreams of former shaman now deceased. Shamans usually rise to positions of power and leadership within their tribes. Most often it is males that receive the dream-vision that sets them on the shaman's path, although female shaman are not uncommon. Quilboar shamans possess the abilities to combat or cause disease, to control nature, and to summon spirit boars. According to quilboar shamans, the existence of sickness is caused by the intrusion of other species on the rightful lands of the quilboar. They teach that until the invaders are driven out and the quilboar have returned to their promised lands, suffering can be alleviated through a heroic death. The afterlife for quilboar martyrs is filled with wonders and pleasures beyond imagining, according to shamanistic teachings.\nThough omnivorous, quilboar prefer the taste of meat.\nLanguages.\nQuilboar speak Common and &lt;a href=\"Low%20Common\"&gt;Low Common&lt;/a&gt; as primary languages. Sometimes quilboar learn the languages of their enemies, such as &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20%28language%29\"&gt;Goblin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Orcish%20%28language%29\"&gt;Orcish&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Taur-ahe\"&gt;Taur-ahe&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Zandali\"&gt;Zandali&lt;/a&gt;.\nMilitary tactics.\nQuilboar are ruthless in battle. Their warriors battle with little fear for their personal safety, knowing that, if they die, their death helps the rest of their tribe grow. To others, quilboar may seem suicidal, blindly charging into battle and willingly throwing themselves into the thickest fray to defend their tribes. To the quilboar, death is just another part of life, unwelcome but not entirely feared.\nQuilboar fight best in packs. Their quick charges and frenzied battle cries lead enemies to believe the quilboar are reckless and disorganized, but in reality they use solid tactics. Quilboar flank whenever possible and make use of the aid of another action to take down particularly difficult opponents. They never retreat, seeing such an action as a sign of weakness.\nQuilboar are ferocious pack fighters. Unlike the swarm tactics of murlocs, quilboar fight in rigid packs, surrounding enemies and expertly coordinating attacks to bring down the toughest foes. The death of a packmate does not weaken the pack's power; in fact, the death bolsters the remaining packmates, urging them into greater displays of skill and cunning. Quilboar believe that even in death, their packmates fight alongside the living. Outsiders witnessing a pack battle find this idea easy to believe.\nQuilboar shaman, known as thornweavers, act as commanders in battle, healing and inspiring their packs. Every pack has its own thornweaver, and larger packs often boast more than one. Unlike other races, quilboar healers fly into melee alongside their brethren, reveling in the thrill of battle. Thornweavers also create healing wards to keep their packs going, and bolster their forces with summoned spirits, usually boars. Quilboar thornweavers gain additional power when witnessing the death of an ally; the fallen quilboar's spirit infuses the thornweaver's spells as well as his strength.\nQuilboar never willingly retreat, and fight until they vanquish their foes or die. This single-mindedness breeds fear into the pack's enemies. Those who have fought quilboar before know that they don't stop fighting until everything in their path is dead.\nSpeculation.\nA possible Swinegart tribe \u2014 within the &lt;a href=\"Bristleback%20tribe\"&gt;Bristleback tribe&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 may probably be represented by &lt;a href=\"Swinegart%20Spearhide\"&gt;Swinegart Spearhide&lt;/a&gt;, as \"spearhide\" is also used in &lt;a href=\"Razorfen%20Spearhide\"&gt;Razorfen Spearhide&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Withered%20Spearhide\"&gt;Withered Spearhide&lt;/a&gt;. However, it is likely that it is his actual name.\nGallery.\n\"Hearthstone\".\nThe following quilboar from the \" expansion of \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\" are members of a \"quilboar biker gang\", a minor criminal faction that operate in &lt;a href=\"Gadgetzan\"&gt;Gadgetzan&lt;/a&gt; independent of the larger crime families such as the &lt;a href=\"Grimy%20Goons\"&gt;Grimy Goons&lt;/a&gt;. Curiously they appear to be affiliated with the Horde as they have its symbol tattooed on their bodies and motorcycles.\nFor more quilboar art in \"Hearthstone\" see ."}

The Crag is now home to a massive logging expedition by the &lt;a href=\"Venture%20Company\"&gt;Venture Company&lt;/a&gt;. The entire logging operation was put in the hands of &lt;a href=\"Gerenzo%20Wrenchwhistle\"&gt;Gerenzo Wrenchwhistle&lt;/a&gt;, a gnome who is now more machine than gnome. Using his mechanical expertise, he built the &lt;a href=\"Super%20Reaper%206000\"&gt;Super Reaper 6000&lt;/a&gt; which can reduce the most massive trees to sawdust. He watches over the crag from a platform built above the &lt;a href=\"Cragpool%20Lake\"&gt;Cragpool Lake&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the southeast corner of Windshear Crag lies the &lt;a href=\"Windshear%20Mine\"&gt;Windshear Mine&lt;/a&gt;. Kobolds occupy the mine and are digging for &lt;a href=\"Smoky%20Iron%20Ingot\"&gt;Smoky Iron Ingot&lt;/a&gt;s. In the northeast corner is the &lt;a href=\"Talondeep%20Path\"&gt;Talondeep Path&lt;/a&gt;. This cave stretches under the mountains and exits in &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;. Nearby the entrance is &lt;a href=\"Braug%20Dimspirit\"&gt;Braug Dimspirit&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; that administers the &lt;a href=\"Test%20of%20Lore\"&gt;Test of Lore&lt;/a&gt; to members of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nPearl of Pandaria.\nBy the time of the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, the crag was completely deforested by the Company. &lt;a href=\"Li%20Li%20Stormstout\"&gt;Li Li Stormstout&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Strongbo\"&gt;Strongbo&lt;/a&gt;, who was angered by this, arrived here and continued to a hidden valley, containing &lt;a href=\"indellium\"&gt;indellium&lt;/a&gt;, which was also previously ravaged by the goblins.\nCataclysm.\nSince the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, a large majority of the Venture Company has been removed and replaced by members of the Alliance and Horde. The &lt;a href=\"lumber%20mill\"&gt;lumber mill&lt;/a&gt; is currently under control of the Horde. A path into Ashenvale was carved out by the Horde, but they're currently under attack by Alliance forces. The Water Wheel is currently under control by the few remaining Venture Company personal.\nThe entrance to the Crag from &lt;a href=\"Webwinder%20Path\"&gt;Webwinder Path&lt;/a&gt; has been taken by the Alliance and &lt;a href=\"Windshear%20Hold\"&gt;Windshear Hold&lt;/a&gt; established with an inn and flight path. To the southeast of Windshear Hold and across the Crag the Horde have established &lt;a href=\"Krom%27gar%20Fortress\"&gt;Krom'gar Fortress&lt;/a&gt;, with their own inn and flight master, and also their own mine; Goblin and Gnome machines fight in the valley below. \nIn the RPG.\nWindshear Crag is the hotbed of &lt;a href=\"Venture%20Company\"&gt;Venture Company&lt;/a&gt; activity in the &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;mountains&lt;/a&gt;, and the area is swarming with dozens of machines. The most impressive of these is a unique, tanklike logging machine called the &lt;a href=\"Super%20Reaper%206000\"&gt;Super Reaper 6000&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 and while the machine is used primarily for cutting wood, I have no doubt that the &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s have rigged every inch of it with some sort of explosive device.

Its crew consisted of some of the most daredevil boys and girls, including the &lt;a href=\"tidesage\"&gt;tidesage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ery\"&gt;Ery&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Halia\"&gt;Halia&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"mermaid\"&gt;mermaid&lt;/a&gt;, who loved watching the human ships, made the \"Windward\" her favorite and fell in love with Ery. The sailors were beside themselves each time they saw the mermaid swimming near the ship and begged the captain to let them scare off or kill her, but Ery forbade them. The tidesage instead made Halia into a ship mascot of sorts by always saluting her when the \"Windward\" arrived to Boralus and bidding her goodbye when the ship left. Some new crew members tried to jeer at Ery for this, but she silenced them with her hard fists.\nThe \"Windward\" was in port when a great storm came to Boralus, and Ery joined other tidesages in trying to divert the water from the town. The crew of the \"Windward\" eventually made their way through the current to try and rescue her, braving not only the storm but also the large number of mermaids darting back and forth and trying to build a seawall; the sailors were almost more frightened of the mermaids than the storm. The tidesage refused to come to her crew, and they could only watch as the mermaids' wall rose under her feet until it towered over the harbor. The sailors kept crying for Ery, but soon started crying more for the mermaids to take pity on themselves and stop their ceaseless work. Eventually, Ery collapsed from exhaustion and fell into the harbor. Her love, the mermaid &lt;a href=\"Halia\"&gt;Halia&lt;/a&gt;, dived after her and pulled her to the surface, but she was neither breathing nor moving. The crew of the \"Windward\" put out a dinghy and hauled the two onto the deck, where the sailors and other tidesages tried to revive Ery without any luck. Almost nobody protested when Halia used a knife to slit her lover's feet and cried for the sailors to push the two of them over the railing and into the harbor. The crew did so and then began to weep both for their devoted tidesage and for the dead sailors and mermaids who had given their lives to save Boralus. The captain had just given the order to prepare to turn about when Ery surfaced again, alive and transformed into a mermaid."}

{"id": "69486", "revid": "39299307", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=69486", "title": "Windwarrior", "text": "Windwarriors are elite &lt;a href=\"windrider\"&gt;windrider&lt;/a&gt;s. Once, long ago, warriors fought on foot, with nothing but their own bodies and weapons to determine the outcome. Then people domesticated animals, and discovered they could ride the larger beasts, giving them both height and speed unmatched by any landbound foe. Thus mounted combat began. Now warriors on horse, panther, wolf and other beasts are a common sight, and many learned to ride almost as early as they learn to walk, reveling in the speed and ease of such travel. But riding on a beast, watching the ground flash past just below, pales against the thrill of riding an aerial mount, soaring through the air, feeling the wind tugging at your cheeks and lashing at your hair. And, in combat, warriors mounted on such airborne steeds have a clear advantage, swooping in to attack and then sailing safely beyond reach again. Few can master such creatures however, and fewer still have the discipline, the grace and the calm to forge a bond with their mounts, becoming less warrior and rider than a single creature united in purpose under the sky. These are the windwarriors.\nA windwarrior is more than a mounted warrior. He is a child of the air, a brother to the &lt;a href=\"gryphon\"&gt;gryphon&lt;/a&gt;, an enigma to the landbound. He has become one with his steed and together they soar ever higher, exulting in the freedom of flight. Windwarriors fight because it is required, but they fly because they must, because without such speed and altitude they would surely perish. Which is not to say that windwarriors are not formidable foes. Anyone who has ever faced one can attest to their martial prowess. Yet fighting is only one aspect of being a windwarrior. Speed, agility, freedom, and the bond with their mounts are the core of the class, the heart of their brotherhood. Anyone who lives to fly is a brother, and anyone who does not appreciate flight will never understand.\nMost windwarriors are &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20Clan\"&gt;Wildhammer dwarves&lt;/a&gt;, as they are the most comfortable both in the sky and riding winged mounts. Many others also become windwarriors, however, since the most important requirement is not race but inclination and ability. Windwarriors often form their own organizations within their societies, though it is a loose fraternity rather than a rigid military unit or formal hierarchy. Many windwarriors remain with their tribe (or city, or village, or whatever) and perform various tasks and services for them, functioning as a combination scout, messenger, hunter, and guardian. Others take contracts with various groups, individuals, or even governments. In several cases windwarriors banded together to form mercenary units, hiring out for military missions to anyone who can pay them. These units rarely last, however, as most windwarriors prefer their freedom and eventually get tired of obeying others.\nWildhammer dwarves respect windwarriors and consider that occupation one of the highest possible. Wildhammer children learn to ride gryphons shortly after walking, climbing and swimming, and many train with windwarriors as youths. For them, the windwarriors are part of the community and far and away the most exciting and adventurous members of the tribe. The Alliance leaders also value windwarriors, and have relied upon them for reconnaissance, communications, retrieval, rescue and attack. Though few in number, the windwarrior's speed and maneuverability makes them immensely valuable in any combat, particularly when facing landbound forces. \nDespite all this, most windwarriors are humble. They know well enough that they are only aloft thanks to their mounts, and in many ways it is the mount who is truly important. This attitude keeps windwarriors from growing too arrogant, especially since they each care for their own mounts personally. Windwarriors rarely desire riches or fame, anyway. They are far more interested in their own freedom to fly as they choose, where they wish and when they want. Windwarriors need to be flexible and quick to handle sudden shifts in flight. They empathize with their mounts to win the beasts' trust, loyalty, and eventually love. Every windwarrior learns to appreciate his surroundings, his mount and his own abilities, and learns to use these gifts wisely. Windwarriors must endure punishing winds, harsh temperatures, and the general fatigue caused by travel. They use their strength for tugging on reins and lugging supplies. Most windwarriors are Wildhammer dwarves, and Wildhammer dwarves are staunch allies of the Alliance, thus most windwarriors are as well.\nWindwarriors usually take flying animals or magical beasts as mounts. Windwarriors and their mounts form a mystical bond which allows the two to learn and improve together far beyond the limits of either species. Over time, windwarrior and mount learn to work together during combat to minimize risk and exposure. Windwarrior and mount can communicate as effectively as if they shared a common language, though other creatures cannot understand the communication without magical help. the windwarriormount bond is so strong that the windwarrior can communicate with others of the mount\u2019s species. The windwarrior\u2019s mount does not allow anyone else to get near it unless the windwarrior has already vouched for the individual. It does not let anyone but the windwarrior mount it without specific approval by the windwarrior.\nThe windwarrior has an empathic link with his mount out to a distance of up to 1 mile. The windwarrior cannot see through the mount\u2019s eyes, but they can communicate empathically. Note that even intelligent mounts see the world differently from humans, so misunderstandings are always possible. Because of this empathic link, the windwarrior has the same connection to an item or place that his mount does. The windwarrior can close his eyes and see through the eyes of his mount, and vice-versa, provided they are within 1 mile of each other and are both conscious.\nThe windwarrior carves a small totem of his mount. This must be done by the windwarrior alone, and it must be crafted from wood, stone or clay. Once the totem is complete, the windwarrior cuts both himself and his mount and dips the totem in the mixed blood. The item is now bonded to both of them permanently. The windwarrior can concentrate on the totem and know whether his mount is alive and healthy, and approximately how far away the mount is from his current location. The windwarrior uses his carved totem to deepen the link between him and his mount. The totem functions as a gryphon lure when the windwarrior touches it and mentally calls to his mount, though the windwarrior need not be a Wildhammer dwarf and the mount need not be a gryphon. The windwarrior can send his mount a telepathic message through the totem.\nWindwarriors can merge their mounts into the totem. The windwarrior must touch the totem to the mount and concentrate. The mount vanishes and the totem gains a faint glow and a gleam to its eye, as if it were alive. The mount can remain within the totem. It does not need to eat, drink, sleep or breathe in this state. The windwarrior can summon his mount from the totem.\nWindwarriors cherish &lt;a href=\"gryphonmail\"&gt;gryphonmail&lt;/a&gt; suits, and some even have gryphonmail created from their own mount\u2019s feathers, tying them together even more closely.\nYoung &lt;a href=\"hippogryph\"&gt;hippogryph&lt;/a&gt;s taken with the urge to explore and see the forest beyond their nests often serve as willing mounts for night elf windwarriors.\nWindwarrior Styles.\nEvery windwarrior loves flying, loves the sky, loves freedom, and loves his or her mount. But other details may differ, not the least of which is personal style. Some windwarriors consider themselves knights of the air. They wear heavier armor than most windwarriors, and carry an axe, sword or mace plus a lance or glaive. Many carry shields slung across their backs or hanging from their mounts. These windwarriors favor strength and speed over subtlety.\nOthers are the opposite. These windwarriors favor stealth, working from above where no one would expect them. They wear little or no armor and carry only melee weapons and smaller ranged weapons. Their great gear is dark and they carry little ornamentation - everything is about speed, stealth and surprise.\nA third faction favors the lighter weight but not the stealth. These windwarriors wear brightly colored clothing and light armor, and wield lighter, faster weapons. They scoff at the so-called \"knights of the air\" but do admire their sense of drama. These windwarriors have their own drama, dashing across the sky and leaping down to confront foes and creating an image of enthusiasm, playfulness and careless skill.\nWindwarriors have other styles as well. Some belong to organizations or groups with shared ideals, while some are loners, just a man and his mounts. One major element of windwarriors is the choice of mount. Gryphons are the most common, particularly for Wildhammer windwarriors, but they are by no means the only mount available. &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; favor &lt;a href=\"dragonhawk\"&gt;dragonhawk&lt;/a&gt;s, while night elves select &lt;a href=\"hippogryph\"&gt;hippogryph&lt;/a&gt; mounts; &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s choose &lt;a href=\"wyvern\"&gt;wyvern&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s favor &lt;a href=\"vampire%20bat\"&gt;vampire bat&lt;/a&gt;s. Those who pick different creatures for their steeds may develop a different style and appearance based upon their mount's relative size, speed, agility and aggression."}

{"id": "142582", "revid": "40372170", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=142582", "title": "Wine/Misc", "text": "In this article you may read all sorts of useful information and relevant extra tips and tricks to the &lt;a href=\"Wine\"&gt;Wine&lt;/a&gt; guide. \nVoice Chat.\nA number of raiding guilds require the use of voice chat systems such as Ventrilo (\"Vent\"), which can be a barrier to raiding under Linux. There are four solutions:\nVentrilo on Wine.\nIt is possible to run Ventrilo on Wine alongside WoW. For installation and configuration instructions on Ventrilo see &lt;a href=\"http%3A//appdb.winehq.org/appview.php%3FiVersionId%3D3936\"&gt;the Ventrilo page on WineHQ&lt;/a&gt;.\nMangler.\nIf you don't want to fuss around with getting Ventrilo working in Wine, you can use &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.mangler.org/\"&gt;Mangler&lt;/a&gt;, which is compatible with current Ventrilo servers.\nMumble.\nIf the group is open to switching to a different voice chat system, &lt;a href=\"http%3A//wiki.mumble.info/wiki/Main_Page\"&gt;Mumble&lt;/a&gt; is a cross-platform, open-source solution which supports Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux, and has Android and iOS clients available. It's been favorably compared to Ventrilo, and does not have complex licensing requirements.\nIn-Game Voice Chat.\nThe in-game voice chat system isn't used very much, but it's reported to work fine under Wine.\nYou can configure the voice chat settings from within WoW (just like on Windows). You'll see the full name of the headset in the devices list. Mine reads \"Logitech_G35_Headset Analog Mono\" (for the microphone) and \"Logitech_G35_Headset Analog Stereo\" for the speakers.\nIt is also possible to use pavucontrol to (re-)direct sound input and output. For the best usage, set all devices to \"System Default\" within WoW. In the Playback (and Recording) tab of pavucontrol you should see WINE [WoW.exe]. Simply click on the button to the right and select the device you want to attach to the audio stream. The advantage of using this method is that WoW will not re-initialize the sound system.\nOpenGL vs. Direct3D.\nLinux does not support Direct3D natively; the 3D graphics API is OpenGL. However, Wine includes a translation layer that translates Direct3D API calls to OpenGL. It supports Direct3D 9, and work to support newer versions is underway. Generally, World of Warcraft runs in Direct3D mode.\nUnder certain circumstances, however, it's useful to switch WoW to run in OpenGL mode, which translates to Linux OpenGL much more easily. Blizzard officially discourages running in OpenGL mode under Windows, however, and it often doesn't work as well or support some features.\nEnabling OpenGL in WoW.\nThere are two ways to tell WoW to run in OpenGL mode.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Config.wtf\"&gt;Config.wtf&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"gxApi\"&gt;gxApi&lt;/a&gt; setting can turn on OpenGL:\n SET gxApi \"OpenGL\"\nSwitching back to the default can be done with:\n SET gxApi \"D3D9\"\nThe other way is to run the game directly with the codice_1 switch, like so:\n wine \"C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\World of Warcraft\\\\WoW.exe -opengl\"\nProblems with OpenGL mode.\nAs of September 2014, running WoW via the Config.WTF setting is not possible using the Battle.net Launcher, as the game refuses to connect in this mode to Blizzard's servers. Use the command-line method instead.\nGraphics settings besides \"Low\" will generally have artifacts, including rendering errors for far-off objects, flashing, and tearing. When in OpenGL mode, set your graphics settings to \"Low\".\nScalable WoW Icon.\nSimply save this SVG to a location in your home path, and assign you launcher to use it. With Gnome it's as simple as right clicking the launcher, going to properties, and then finally clicking the button with the current icon, and finding the replacement. This icon should be far more appealing and allow you to make it larger, with no text as is a current desktop fad, without horrible pixelation.\nMore Information on Config.WTF.\nAll Available Options.\n&lt;a href=\"Config.wtf_defaults\"&gt;Config.wtf_defaults&lt;/a&gt;\nTypical Config.wtf.\n SET gxResolution \"1024x768\"\n SET gxRefresh \"60\"\n SET hwDetect \"0\"\n SET movie \"0\"\n SET readTOS \"1\"\n SET realmList \"us.logon.worldofwarcraft.com\"\n SET gxMultisampleQuality \"0.000000\"\n SET readEULA \"1\"\n SET readScanning \"-1\"\n SET realmName \"\"\n SET gameTip \"54\"\n SET gxCursor \"0\"\n SET SmallCull \"0.040000\"\n SET frillDensity \"32\"\n SET farclip \"357\"\n SET Gamma \"0.600000\"\n SET MusicVolume \"0.60000002384186\"\n SET SoundVolume \"1\"\n SET SoundOutputSystem \"1\"\n SET SoundBufferSize \"150\"\n SET MasterVolume \"1\"\n SET ffx \"0\"\n SET AmbienceVolume \"0.60000002384186\"\n SET uiScale \"1\"\n SET mouseSpeed \"1\"\n SET cameraPitchMoveSpeed \"90\"\n SET cameraYawMoveSpeed \"180\"\n SET cameraPitchSmoothSpeed \"45\"\n SET cameraYawSmoothSpeed \"180\"\n SET cameraSmoothStyle \"0\"\n SET cameraSmoothTrackingStyle \"0\"\n SET cameraDistanceMaxFactor \"1\"\n SET SoundZoneMusicNoDelay \"1\"\n SET gxColorBits \"24\"\n SET gxApi \"opengl\"\n SET statusBarText \"1\"\n SET ffxDeath \"0\"\n SET minimapZoom \"0\"\n SET guildMemberNotify \"1\"\n SET profanityFilter \"0\"\n SET readContest \"-1\"\n SET minimapInsideZoom \"5\"\n SET gxDepthBits \"24\"\n SET accountName \"\"\nPerformance Boost.\nNote: If your Kernel runs the CFS Scheduler (&lt;a href=\"http%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Completely_Fair_Scheduler\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) this performance boost doesn't work since this command will make it \"really\" a low priority process (Eg. If you're watching a website and it refreshes major CPU power will be destined to the browser, slowing down WoW).\nNewer distributions as Ubuntu 7.10 use CFS Scheduler.\nYou \"may\" improve the overall game performance and FPS if you change the default priority WoW runs with by starting it with the \"nice\" command.\nUsing a terminal window type the following command: \n nice -15 wine wow\nBut if you want to change the priority of a WoW process that is already running, the command to use is \"renice\".\nFor both \"nice\" and \"renice\" commands the priority values range from -20 to +19 and negative numbers raise the priority of a task while positive numbers lower it. Only the superuser can specify negative numbers (thus raising the priority of a process).\nLets imagine you are running WoW and want to change the priority without leaving the game. First you need to discover what the Process ID (PID) of WoW is (which is running under Wine). In a terminal window type:\n ps -ef | grep wineserver\nThe PID is that number in the first line, second column of the output text. Remember that the PID will always be a different number every time you execute WoW. Lets suppose that this time the PID is 12345. Change its priority with the following command:\n renice -15 -p 12345\nYou will immediately notice the difference. If you want to make sure this really made some difference then change it back to the default priority:\n renice 0 -p 12345\nCheck your distro documentation for \"ps\", \"nice\" and \"renice\" commands for more information; \"ps\" may produce slightly different outputs according to the shell you are executing."}

{"id": "142543", "revid": "819614", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=142543", "title": "Wine troubleshooting", "text": "Troubleshooting Wine tries to address the common issues people are having with running \"World of Warcraft\" using &lt;a href=\"Wine\"&gt;Wine&lt;/a&gt; on Linux.\nImportant note: Make ABSOLUTELY SURE you run the latest Wine version, as well as the latest version of your graphic card drivers. If you don't, and encounter errors that have been fixed in newer versions... you're out of luck.\nCan't see the installer tomes on the DVD.\nMost distros automounter programs don't include the \"unhide\" option for UDF filesystems. It will most likely be mandatory to remount manually.\nThe exact command that would need to be run (as root) would be \n mount -o remount,unhide /dev/sr0\nThis will be different based on where your distro places the DVD drive. An easy way to check would be to run the codice_1 command and choose the relevant device (which will typically be sr# or cd#).\nPost-4.0.1 KERNEL32.SetFileValidData crash.\nThe installer and launcher for WoW 4.0.1 and later require a new function in kernel32.dll. If your launcher crashes, upgrade Wine to at least version 1.2.1.\nCrashes.\ncodice_2 \nYou could also do this the hard way by starting up codice_3 in your World of Warcraft installation directory, and quickly click the View menu, Preferences. Uncheck Peer to Peer, and check Don't throttlem then click OK. Then you can either let the download continue in the Background Downloader, or you can close the Background Downloader, and re-open the Launcher and the download will not fail.\nBattle.net Launcher.\nIf the Battle.net Launcher crashes on startup with a crash window, it may be related to a problem with Wine and IPv6. More recent versions of Wine may fix this; in at least one case, updating to Wine 1.7.26 cleared the problem up. As a workaround, it's possible to disable IPv6 while the Launcher is starting, and re-enable it after the Launcher window comes up. This can be done on the command line, as root:\n echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/all/disable_ipv6 \nTo turn IPv6 back on again, run this as root:\n echo 0 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/all/disable_ipv6\n32-bit.\nOne thing to try when running on a 64-bit system: try forcing 32-bit mode. This can be done from the Battle.net Launcher, within the Settings, or on the command line with:\n wine \"C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\World of Warcraft\\\\WoW.exe -noautolaunch64bit\nConfig.wtf.\n\"Main article: &lt;a href=\"Config.wtf\"&gt;Config.wtf&lt;/a&gt;\"\nSound corruption.\nIf you have problems with sound stuttering you may have to increase or decrease the sound buffer a bit. It's configured by changing the value of the codice_4 line in codice_5. Anything from 50 to 250 may cure your problem. Bear in mind that excessive buffer size may create audio sync issues.\nYou may try the following option as well:\n SET SoundOutputSystem \"1\"\nUI corruption.\nIf you experience corrupt icons or interface textures, you then you may need to set the UIFaster parameter in wtf/Config.wtf\nUse it like this:\n Set UIFaster \"x\"\nWhere x equals:\n 0 \u2013 This turns off all UI acceleration\n 2 \u2013 Enables partial UI acceleration only.\n 3 \u2013 Enables all UI acceleration.\nExample:\n Set UIFaster \"2\"\nThe value 2 usually corrects this problem.\nPerformance.\nSome people have reported better frame rates with the following settings:\n SET ffxDeath \"0\"\n SET ffxGlow \"0\"\nOther tweaks.\nGlitch every 3-5 sec.\nIf you see a noticeable graphical stutter every 3 to 5 seconds or so for this you need to edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf and add something like:\n Option \"UseFastTLS\" \"2\"\nto the Video card \"Device\" Section.\nThis is normally a problem with the proprietary Linux Drivers for AMD/ATI cards.\nAnother possibility is a problem with the default kernel scheduler; this is particularly an issue with nVidia graphics. This is the same fix as described below, in the \"Stuttering every 15 seconds..\" section.\nInstaller.exe and RAM type.\nOn certain systems there is a problem with RAM and the WoW Installer. On a Core2 Duo 6400 with DDR2-800, setting the RAM to DDR2-533 in BIOS allowed the installer to work flawlessly the first time. It's easy to confuse this issue with a CD/DVD problem because the installer will complain about a checksum error.\"\nStuttering every 15 seconds and flickering line fix.\nOn some distributions, World of Warcraft stutters exactly every 15 seconds. You will also notice a flickering bar on the top of your screen. This is associated with kernels using the CFS scheduler, which roughly corresponds with version 2.6.24 of the Linux kernel (or later).\nIn most cases, the fix will require rebuilding the kernel, and setting the kernel build configuration option \"CONFIG_SCHED_DEBUG\" to \"y\". To see if you need to rebuild the kernel, look for the file \"/proc/sys/kernel/sched_features\". If this file exists, you do not need to recompile your kernel.\nInstructions for compiling your kernel are beyond the scope of this page; consult your distribution's documentation for information on how to do this. Here are some hints for specific distributions:\nOnce your kernel is recompiled (or you've found that it doesn't need to be recompiled), tuning your kernel is much easier. Just add the following lines to your /etc/sysctl.conf:\n # World of Warcraft stutter and flickering line fix\n kernel.sched_features=21\n kernel.sched_batch_wakeup_granularity_ns=25000000\n kernel.sched_min_granularity_ns=4000000\nSave it, and reboot. World of Warcraft should now run without silly stuttering and flickering.\nWine source patches.\nGallium Nine.\nThis is an effort to bypass OpenGL and hook directly into the Gallium open-source drivers for D3D support. More information can be found at &lt;a href=\"https%3A//wiki.ixit.cz/d3d9\"&gt;iXit&lt;/a&gt;, and an &lt;a href=\"https%3A//launchpad.net/~commendsarnex/%2Barchive/ubuntu/ppa\"&gt;Ubuntu PPA for Gallium Nine&lt;/a&gt; is available. Note that this is experimental and not recommended yet for general use.\nCSMT.\nThis is a patch from CodeWeavers which sets up a separate thread for D3D -&gt; OpenGL translation. A few Wine variants are starting to make it available, including PlayOnLinux.\nNvidia-specific issues.\nTwinView.\nYou know that you have this problem if World of Warcraft does not display correctly, and you have TwinView enabled. To fix this, set the in-game video settings to \"Windowed Mode\", and \"Maximized\". Unfortunately, you will not be able to set the resolution at the video settings, so: set the appropriate resolution by changing gxResolution in Config.wtf to your liking (this looks just like running in fullscreen). E.g.:\n SET gxResolution \"1280x1024\"\nAlternatively, if you by any chance cannot access the in-game video settings you can force these settings by enabling: \n SET gxWindow \"1\"\n SET gxMaximize \"1\"\nAMD/ATI-Specific issues.\nNo Object Textures/Models.\nSome AMD/ATI users can't see character and object models. It seems to appear with newer drivers.\nTo solve the problem, add the following line to Config.wtf:\n SET M2UseShaders \"0\"\nCrash on entering game world.\nFor users with an AMD or ATI video card: certain cards have trouble rendering games and video in OpenGL using current fglrx drivers which will cause your computer to hard locks when you attempt to enter a domain. This error will occur just after character creation/selection, as the game environment is loading, or possibly after a short period of play. In order to fix this error, add the following lines of code to your xorg.conf file in the Device section:\n Option \"Capabilities\" \"0x00000800\"\n Option \"UseFastTLS\" \"off\"\n Option \"KernelModuleParm\" \"locked-userpages=0\"\nThis is where you find the file:\n /etc/X11/xorg.conf\nThe section should look something similar to this after editing:\n Section \"Device\"\n Identifier \"aticonfig-Device[Amity wine]]ver \"fglrx\"\n Option \"Capabilities\" \"0x00000800\"\n Option \"UseFastTLS\" \"off\"\n Option \"KernelModuleParm\" \"locked-userpages=0\"\n EndSection\nNote: this has been tested and also works with NVidia cards.\nCommon errors.\nCan't eject the CD.\nIf you've got the disk space, the easiest solution would be to rip the entirety of disc 1, and the codice_6 files from the remaining discs to some folder on your computer (like ~/wow/), then run the installer from there.\nWaiting for files to close....\nThis message appears during patching when certain files are open (Launcher.exe, Wow.exe, etc). To make sure you don't have any of those files open, try codice_7 to close all wine applications. If this didn't do anything, open codice_8 and change the Windows version to Windows NT 4.0. If it still doesn't work, you may have more luck with other Windows versions.\nYour 3D accelerator card is not supported by World of Warcraft. Please install a 3D accelerator card with dual-TMU support..\nThere is a 99% chance that this is due to the drivers. If you just got a new graphic card or reinstalled the OS, you might be using outdated drivers. Distribution drivers are usually weeks or even months behind the current ones. It's strongly recommended to use the official ones; see &lt;a href=\"Wine%23Video_support\"&gt;the main Wine page&lt;/a&gt; for links to those drivers.\nThis error can also happen on 64-bit Linux distributions if you're using the proprietary drivers as packaged by the distribution. Some distributions put the 32-bit versions of the libraries in a separate package. Since Wine uses the 32-bit libraries even on 64-bit systems, Wine won't support accelerated OpenGL without them. Look for a package that's named similarly to the driver package, but includes a note about being 32-bit. For example, on 64-bit Debian, if you're using the \"nvidia-glx\" libraries, you want to also install \"nvidia-glx-ia32\".\nIf you have just updated your system's kernel or video drivers, you may simply need to restart your computer.\nerr:module:import_dll Library OPENGL32.dll.\nYou get the following error on startup:\n err:module:import_dll Library OPENGL32.dll (which is needed by L\"C:Program Files/World of Warcraft/wow.exe\")\n not found err:module:LdrInitializeThunk Main exe initialization for L\"C:/Program Files/World of Warcraft/wow.exe\"\n failed, status c0000135\nSolution : check that codice_9 has ownership of codice_10 and permissions\ncodice_11, if it does not then you may have not been super user when you ran the \"codice_12\" command.\nbecome superuser and repeat the make install command as shown in the howto. Do not just change the\nownership/permissions of opengl32.dll.so as probably all the other files are wrong too, so do a make install.\nIMPORTANT: When going through the steps of compiling Wine from the source code to execute the \"codice_12\" command, be sure to include the following in the first step listed in the howto:\ncodice_14\nIf you miss this tiny part of the process, OpenGL will not install with Wine and WoW will not run, throwing the same error as listed above. You'll need to uninstall Wine and start the process all over again.\nError #134 \"Unable to associate local address with socket...\".\nThe socket is already bound to an address, or the parameter is a listening socket. You need to make sure your loopback interface is up, by running:\n ifconfig lo up\nor\n sudo ifconfig lo up\n\"DOS address space\" or \"DOS memory range\" errors.\nSee &lt;a href=\"http%3A//wiki.winehq.org/PreloaderPageZeroProblem\"&gt;the Wine wiki page&lt;/a&gt; on this issue.\nMouse moves camera angle improperly or mouse pointer is shifted.\nThese errors have been experienced with Ubuntu 10.04 using the default window manager: GNOME. \nThe first error is when depressing a mouse button anywhere in the characters field of vision will cause the camera to immediately pan upwards until it is right above the player character. Mouse use on any menu item, however, does not affect the camera.\nThe second error is when the mouse pointer has been skewed. So, in order to press a button in game, the mouse pointer must be a few millimeters off the target.\nThe cause is unknown at this time, however the fix has been to use a more light weight window manager: &lt;a href=\"http%3A//fluxbox.org\"&gt;Fluxbox&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo install (in Ubuntu), enable the universe software source, then you can use apt-get to install it.\n sudo apt-get install fluxbox\nThen, log out of your current window manager to get to the login screen. Under the title \"Sessions\", there will be the option to select \"Fluxbox\"\nFor Ubuntu users: To connect to the Internet in Fluxbox, you can hit Alt+F2 for a \"Run Program\" dialog. Then type in:\n nm-applet\nCyrillic letters issue.\nIf you have ????? letters while typing in wow with russian layout, try this steps:\n1. Install MS fonts\na. Install MS fonts with you distribution package manager (for ubuntu: \n $sudo apt-get install msttcorefonts \nfor gentoo: \n emerge corefonts\nb. copy them to your wine's drive_c/windows/fonts/ directory. Usually that can be done in such way:\n cp \"/path/to/installed/fonts/*\" /home/\"username\"/.wine/drive_c/windows/Fonts/\n2. Force wow to use cp1251 charset\na. Open menu item (.desktop file) which you are using to launch wow with text editor\n nano /usr/share/applications/Wow.desktop\nb. change exec line to include env LANG=\"ru_RU.cp1251\". That's mine:\n Exec=env LANG=\"ru_RU.cp1251\" WINEPREFIX=\"/home/\"username\"/.wine\" wine H:\\\\\\\\path\\\\\\\\to\\\\\\\\World\\\\ of\\\\ Warcraft\\\\\\\\Wow.exe\nWow crashes on login/entering world.\nThis happens when you use open source drivers which have legal issues with S3 texture compression, which is disabled and requires libtxc_dxtn to be installed. Otherwise you can force partial support with:\n export force_s3tc_enable=true &amp;&amp; wine Wow.exe"}

A crew of Alterac sailors were also caught assisting the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; during the battle and have been placed under close guard. Under the edict of &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Lord Lothar&lt;/a&gt;, you are to restrain the prisoners until they can be escorted to &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;the capital&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; for interrogation.\"\nBackground.\n&lt;a href=\"Milan\"&gt;Milan&lt;/a&gt;'s force was ordered to closely guard a number of Alterac sailors (both humans and elves) who were caught assisting the Horde during the previous battle. Since they would need ships to carry out their orders, their first building priorities was a &lt;a href=\"Lumber%20mill%23Elven%20lumber%20mill\"&gt;lumber mill&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Blacksmith%20%28building%29\"&gt;blacksmith&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"barracks\"&gt;barracks&lt;/a&gt;, and, of course, a &lt;a href=\"shipyard\"&gt;shipyard&lt;/a&gt;. There was plenty of gold and &lt;a href=\"lumber\"&gt;lumber&lt;/a&gt; in the area, but they needed many workers to collect it. When the labor force had completed the shipyard, they discovered that enemy transports were unloading orcs to the south of town. Although the few troops they had trained could deal with them for the time being, &lt;a href=\"Spy\"&gt;spies&lt;/a&gt; reported that they would soon arrive in increasing numbers. At the south edge of town they erected several &lt;a href=\"cannon%20tower\"&gt;cannon tower&lt;/a&gt;s to deal with them, and fortified those with &lt;a href=\"Farm\"&gt;farms&lt;/a&gt; and archers for good measure. Once the town was reasonably secure, they concentrated on a &lt;a href=\"foundry\"&gt;foundry&lt;/a&gt; for the production of &lt;a href=\"battleship\"&gt;battleship&lt;/a&gt;s.\nGetting the captured sailors was no easy task. A small Horde village separated the main body of water from the river sneaking toward the prisoners, so they prepared an amphibious group of three battleships and two transports loaded with footmen, ballistae, and a couple of &lt;a href=\"peasant\"&gt;peasant&lt;/a&gt;s. First, they sent the battleships in to take out the tower and draw the catapults closer to shore for their destruction. Once the coastline was clear, they moved their warships close to shore and landed the transports. As soon as they unloaded, ogres began pouring in from the settlement, but in their ignorance the monsters tried to concentrate on the Alliance ballistae while footmen and &lt;a href=\"cannon\"&gt;cannon&lt;/a&gt; fire cut them down. When the smoke had cleared somewhat, the peasants built two cannon towers close to shore and the remaining ogres were drawn in to their deaths. The rest of the village fell quickly; the ballistae made quick work of the enemy &lt;a href=\"juggernaught\"&gt;juggernaught&lt;/a&gt;s anchored on the river.\nIn order to recover the prisoners, they first had to construct another shipyard on the river. From there, they launched three more battleships to deal with the numerous enemy cannon towers set up along the river, and only then did they launch a single transport to pick up six of the captives. The rest were promised safe passage later, but at that time it was imperative that they got a few of them back to town. They were hurried from the river to the waiting flotilla on the sea, and were escorted back. They then forced four of them to stand on the mysterious Circle, which glowed brightly for a time, then faded. The prisoners simply stood dumbfounded until they were locked up in the &lt;a href=\"town%20hall\"&gt;town hall&lt;/a&gt;. Later, they received word that their memories had been thoroughly inspected from afar, and what had been found was not to Milan's liking. The traitor nation of Alterac was to be destroyed for its crime. Milan was deeply ashamed and angered that those of his own race would betray the Alliance. He did not mourn their demise...\nAlternate text.\nThe presents a different version of the mission briefing, which never appeared in the actual game:\n\"After the battle at Caer Darrow, a number of Orcish soldiers were captured, along with the infamous &lt;a href=\"Warlock\"&gt;Warlock&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;.

When the images spawn, the Eye of &lt;a href=\"C%27Thun\"&gt;C'Thun&lt;/a&gt; will appear in the sky and target a random player with , dealing damage to nearby players but allowing that player to see which Skeram is the real one.\nRaid strategy.\nBasics.\nThe first boss encounter is a short jog from the entrance of the zone, five trash pulls away. The trash consists of three individual &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Eradicator\"&gt;Obsidian Eradicator&lt;/a&gt; and two groups of &lt;a href=\"Anubisath%20Sentinel\"&gt;Anubisath Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; x4. The respawn on all the trash up to the Prophet is 30 minutes, so unless you are extremely quick at killing the trash, and wiped really quick on the Prophet, it is best for the raid simply to wait for all the respawns before you start another attempt. Similar to &lt;a href=\"Majordomo%20Executus\"&gt;Majordomo Executus&lt;/a&gt;, the Prophet Skeram requires skill and strategy to beat over the quality of gear.\nRaid makeup.\n5 of each class would be recommended, and at least three Warriors geared as &lt;a href=\"Main%20Tank\"&gt;Main Tank&lt;/a&gt;s. Ideally, 6 Warriors and/or Feral Druids (two for each teleport spot) will allow all the Prophet's Images to be tanked, even if they all are using Mind Control on a tank. It is key that these tanks do not move from their assigned location, and if Mind-Controlled, they return to their spot.\nRaid placement.\nWhen the Prophet splits into the three, they will initially all Blink to separate spots and must be immediately tanked before he starts spamming Earth Shock. The easiest method to control this is to have two tanks at each of the three Blink point (Middle, and Left/Right stairs) so that if one is Mind Controlled, the other can still pick up the mob. Skeram and his images may Blink and group up in one of the three locations, so healers need to be alert and tanks must immediately pick up the new mob.\nThe Rogues should split up and put at the three Blink locations as well, but remember to keep a maximum of four players at each Blink location, to avoid the Arcane Explosion. The Healers should also be split into roughly 3 groups, to heal the three melee groups, and to spot heal the rest of the raid. All of the rest of the ranged DPS should head to the top of the steps and move back and forth as Skeram Blinks to a new location. \nMages have a specific role however, their main job is to &lt;a href=\"Polymorph\"&gt;Polymorph&lt;/a&gt; anyone that gets Mind Controlled. They should split up and take positions along both sides of the steps so they can have the best &lt;a href=\"LoS\"&gt;LoS&lt;/a&gt; possible. They may go on DPS as long as there are no players to sheep. One Warlock, on each side as backup, can help by fearing players as well.\nStrategy.\nThe most important aspect of this encounter is the splitting that the Prophet will do at 75%, 50%, and 25%. Once he reaches each of these levels of health, he will disappear for a moment, and then three new Prophets will appear, only one of which is the real boss, and initially all in separate Blink locations. The illusions themselves can also Blink to the other locations, often stacking on one another. This is another reason why two tanks in each corner are essential because if two Prophets are in a corner, a tank is almost guaranteed to become Mind Controlled. If this does happen, try to have an extra tank run in to take up the extra spot, or have one tank from the now vacant corner run over and try to pick up the slack. While the raid kills the two illusions, mages must continue casting polymorph on anyone who is affected by Mind Control. Speed is of the essence at these three points in the encounter. Everyone will be scrambling to do their job, and if players are slacking, tanks will die from the extra damage, or non-sheeped Mind Controlled players will start 1 or 2-shotting individuals in the raid.\nAlternate Strategy.\nThis strategy is a little more specific about placement. It requires a minimum of 6 warriors but is much more likely to be successful. \n\"Tanks\": Tanking is a very important part of this fight, it requires quick thinking and response. Raid leaders, give each of the six tanks his/her own MT window in CT_RaidAssist. Tell everyone in the raid that MT1 and MT2 will be in the middle platform for the full duration of the fight. MT3 and MT4 will be on the left platform. Finally, MT5 and MT6 will be on the right platform. Designate MT1 to be the first to run in when the fight starts and begin tanking as usual. When Skeram is blinking regularly (not splitting), only MT1, MT3, and MT5 will taunt him when he comes to their platform. The secondary tanks (MT2, MT4, MT6) will ONLY autoattack when a single Skeram is on their platform. The main job of the secondary tanks at each platform is to watch carefully during a Skeram split for when a second image blinks on top of one while it's already being tanked. Have that secondary tank immediately identify the second image and taunt him as quickly as possible to avoid earth shocks, then drag him to another platform carefully, and have the main tank (MT1, MT3, MT5) of that platform pick it up. During a split, have the tanks call out if he is tanking an image or the real Skeram, call DPS to start immediately on the first identified as an image. \n\"Rogues\": Split your rogues up through this fight to have as few on each platform as possible. The rogues should also stand inside Skeram in front of the tank. The rogues will always be mind-controlled before the tank if this is done correctly. If you have 3 rogues in the raid, assign each one specifically to stay at either the middle, left, or right platform for the whole fight, they should not move between platforms. If you have more than 6 rogues, with the way this strategy is set up, it can be very dangerous due to Skeram's arcane explosion. At the very least, have them apply mind numbing poison to one of their weapons, and be ready to kick at all times as soon as they see him casting arcane explosion.\n\"Healers\": There should be three groups made up of \"Tank, Tank, Priest, Druid, Shaman/Paladin\". This allows the healers to take a position relative to the tank that allows them to always be ready to heal the tanks in their group. All healers that are not in one of these 3 groups should be spread out, ready to spot heal when needed.\n\"Other ranged dps\": Warlocks, hunters, etc should be split up on the staircases as well, even positioned above the middle platform where they could shoot down on the platform while still being able to move to another location quickly when he blinks.\nExample fight: Ready check (trash respawns fast, AFKs could mean a wipe); everyone mounts on a Qiraji Battletank if available; Skeram is engaged regularly, MT1 moves into position and begins tanking while the rest of the raid takes their position. After 30 seconds or so, Skeram blinks to the left platform, MT3 taunts and begins building aggro regularly. At this point, MT4 is only autoattacking, not sundering or taunting at all. Later into the fight, when he hits 75%, The three images split up and MT1, MT3, and MT5 taunt their images immediately, MT2, MT4, and MT6 begin autoattacking. MT5 calls out that he noticed his Skeram image taking more damage than normal, he calls that out, raid leader calls DPS on the right platform. Before that image is killed, it blinks to the middle, on top of the image that was already there. This is where MT2 comes in, he taunts the image that just blinked and begins moving it back to the right-side platform, where MT5 will taunt it and MT2 will move back to his position in the middle. Repeat this throughout the fight and it should be kept under control, and you'll get a nice, clean kill. Good luck everyone!\nSoloing.\nThis encounter can be tricky for casters, as Skeram blocks all non-instant spells with his Earth Shock ability. The key is to keep up any defensive barriers while spamming any instant-cast offensive spells. Warlocks can let their Voidwalkers or Felguards tank Skeram while they keep their distance (though they need to be careful not to draw aggro onto themselves) but there is the risk that Skeram will Mind Control the player character to attack his pet until it is dead, then the encounter will end with Skeram and the Mind Controlled-warlock returning to the starting point until the spell runs out, at which point Skeram will immediately restart the encounter at full strength. The same applies to all other pet-using classes, including mages' Mirror Images. If you are unable to straight-up DPS the real Skeram down without taking out the copies, then take out the copies when they appear as they can overwhelm you. Remember, while Skeram and his copies only do about 1-2,000 damage per hit individually, this quickly adds up when you have the boss and up to six adds hitting you at once. Just remain calm and be patient, and you should prevail.\nQuotes.\nSound files.\nSee \"&lt;a href=\"PlaySoundFile%20macros%20-%20Kalimdor%20instance%20sounds%23.C2.A0The%20Prophet%20Skeram\"&gt;Sound Files of Kalimdor: The Prophet Skeram&lt;/a&gt;\""}

He is a Drakkari troll prophet who has taken the form of a large skeletal &lt;a href=\"wind%20serpent\"&gt;wind serpent&lt;/a&gt; much like the &lt;a href=\"Avatar%20of%20Hakkar\"&gt;Avatar of Hakkar&lt;/a&gt;. The Prophet Tharon'ja is known for ripping the flesh from the bones of some of the most formidable &lt;a href=\"ice%20troll\"&gt;ice troll&lt;/a&gt; warriors. From the upper tiers of the fortress, Tharon'ja watches as waves of undead trolls pour from the keep's corridors to bolster the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; ranks in their assault on &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Drak\"&gt;Zul'Drak&lt;/a&gt;. In Drak'Tharon Keep he became an ally of the Scourge after turning undead. Drakuru sent agents to kill him because \"Drakuru is a shady troll.\" His current loyalties are unknown.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Death%20Rising\"&gt;Scourge resurgence&lt;/a&gt;, the prophet was one of the undead forces reanimated by &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"kyrian\"&gt;kyrian&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Scourgeholme\"&gt;Scourgeholme&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt;. Later, &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s of both the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; were sent by the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; to kill him once again.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"Not even the stolen powers of a loa could stay death's hand as the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; marched on Drak'Tharon Keep. Tharon'ja now prophesies only triumph for his new master as legions of trolls are slaughtered before the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nTactics.\nHe begins the fight as a skeletal serpent with a few abilities: \nAt about 50% of HP, he uses Decay Flesh, which drains party members' health and turns Tharon'ja into a mortal Windserpent while turning the players into undead skeletons. When in this form, the skeleton players have four spells, in order of how they show up on the bar.\nTanks should use Bone Armor on cooldown and spam Taunt. Everyone else should spam Slaying Strike. \nWhen in mortal Windserpent form, Tharon'ja will occasionally cast a ground-targeted AoE, which does 800 to 900 Nature damage per tick to any player standing in the area. It can be avoided by simply moving around and out of that area.\nAfter a certain percentage of damage is done in this form, everyone switches back. Tharon'ja's switch to mortal Windserpent form and back to skeletal form are both aggro wipes.\nAlternate Strategy: This fight can be done with two or more hunters. The pets will continue to attack even during the skeletal phase, which will nuke the boss down in seconds. Be sure to rotate taunts between party members. Each time the skeletal phase is about to begin and as soon as it ends, cast &lt;a href=\"Mend%20Pet\"&gt;Mend Pet&lt;/a&gt; (and/or &lt;a href=\"Lick%20Your%20Wounds\"&gt;Lick Your Wounds&lt;/a&gt; if specced).\nAny pet class can do this - Hunters, Warlocks, or Unholy Death Knights. All pets avoid the Decay Flesh debuff and continue to attack."}

On the way there, however, the fleet was struck by a massive storm and the \"Queen's Reprisal\" was separated from the other ships. It was ultimately swept ashore on the eastern coast of &lt;a href=\"Azsuna\"&gt;Azsuna&lt;/a&gt;, where it floundered and crashed into a series of rocks, partially sinking into the bay.\nSoon afterwards, a &lt;a href=\"Mak%27rana\"&gt;local colony&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"makrura\"&gt;makrura&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"gilblin\"&gt;gilblin&lt;/a&gt;s swarmed the ship, overwhelming its beleaguered crew.

Along with this transformation these &lt;a href=\"Ogre%20mage\"&gt;Ogre-Magi&lt;/a&gt; have been granted deadly magiks and a malicious cunning rivaling that of Gul'dan himself. You are to employ the Ogre-Magi in the creation and defense of a &lt;a href=\"Fortress\"&gt;Fortress&lt;/a&gt; at the mouth of &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Bay\"&gt;Tyr's Bay&lt;/a&gt;, cutting off the &lt;a href=\"Human\"&gt;Human&lt;/a&gt; supply lines into &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'thalas&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nBackground.\nAs usual, Urok's forces needed scores of slaves to build and collect material, so training began in earnest while their warships sailed out with a flier to quickly eliminate an enemy platform to the northeast. This cut the Alliance &lt;a href=\"oil\"&gt;oil&lt;/a&gt; production in half. The Horde unit's own oil production started with the launching of an &lt;a href=\"oil%20tanker\"&gt;oil tanker&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href=\"foundry\"&gt;foundry&lt;/a&gt; went up next to produce &lt;a href=\"juggernaught\"&gt;juggernaught&lt;/a&gt;s. Towers were erected to guard the coastline against &lt;a href=\"Submarine\"&gt;submersibles&lt;/a&gt; and landing raiders. A large labor force was amassing wealth to build the necessary warships. While the bay filled with their ships, they upgraded their &lt;a href=\"great%20hall\"&gt;great hall&lt;/a&gt; into a &lt;a href=\"stronghold\"&gt;stronghold&lt;/a&gt;, built an &lt;a href=\"ogre%20mound\"&gt;ogre mound&lt;/a&gt;, and then provided an &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20alchemist\"&gt;alchemist lab&lt;/a&gt; for more &lt;a href=\"zeppelin\"&gt;zeppelin&lt;/a&gt;s.\nOnce Urok's unit had six juggernaughts at their disposal, they sent them out with fliers and began pounding the coastline, concentrating on the enemy shipyards to put an end to their naval force. During this time, they again fortified their stronghold into a stalwart fortress; and also erected an &lt;a href=\"Altar%20of%20Storms\"&gt;Altar of Storms&lt;/a&gt; to instruct their ogres in the dark arts. A constant stream of juggernaughts sailed out to replace those they had lost. A second &lt;a href=\"barracks\"&gt;barracks&lt;/a&gt; went up to double the training of ogre magi.\nAfter the enemy shipyards had been removed, they began assembling an amphibious force of two &lt;a href=\"transport%20ship\"&gt;transport ship&lt;/a&gt;s loaded with three catapults, eight ogre magi, and a single worker. Their juggernaughts then began to carefully take out towers and ballistae on the central island while avoiding those on the mainland. When the transports arrived and landed, supported by cannon fire from nearby juggernaughts, the ogres quickly cast &lt;a href=\"%3Abloodlust\"&gt;:bloodlust&lt;/a&gt; on themselves and set to work demolishing the remaining forces on the island, staying near the catapults until they could remove the rest of the towers from a safe distance. All that remained was to build necessary the fortress and shipyard on the island, sealing the fate of the Alliance forces on the mainland.\nNotes.\nContinuity.\nThe details of this level are never referred to again in later parts of the story.\nVideo.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

But all is not as it seems in the eastern kingdom, especially if one informed &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarf&lt;/a&gt; has anything to say about it. Enter &lt;a href=\"Thargas%20Anvilmar\"&gt;Thargas Anvilmar&lt;/a&gt;!\nPlot.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Heroes\"&gt;Valley of Heroes&lt;/a&gt;, hundreds of citizens gather in a great parade to welcome the lost King Varian Wrynn home. Lady &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Katrana Prestor&lt;/a&gt;, Prince &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, and Highlord &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; ride at the head of the ceremony. Anduin and Bolvar quietly discuss how the people of Stormwind know only that Varian was supposedly captured by the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; and ransomed back using gold that the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Nobles\"&gt;House of Nobles&lt;/a&gt; wrung from the common people with a special tax. In response to Bolvar's surprise, Anduin says that just because he's a child doesn't mean he doesn't hear things at court. When Varian arrives through the gates of Stormwind, he seems to show a marked interest in Katrana and dismisses Anduin's concerns about the raised taxes and instead begins discussing the banquet celebrating his return with Lady Prestor.\nDuring a stormy night, Thargas Anvilmar waits in &lt;a href=\"Menethil%20Harbor\"&gt;Menethil Harbor&lt;/a&gt;, having been sent by King &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; to secretly meet with a \"dignitary\" from &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt; and escort him to &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href=\"Wavecutter\"&gt;Theramore ship&lt;/a&gt; finally arrives carrying Lo'Gosh, Broll, and Valeera, and Thargas decides to follow the three newcomers as they head into town. Valeera complains about aches in her body, which Broll points out are symptoms of withdrawal after Valeera absorbed the &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; energy from &lt;a href=\"Morgala%20Darksquall\"&gt;Morgala Darksquall&lt;/a&gt;'s trident. When Valeera drains magic from a nearby fortune-telling woman to restore some of her strength, Broll admonishes her for giving in to her cravings.\nWhile walking past a building, the trio bump into the drunken &lt;a href=\"Tapoke%20%22Slim%22%20Jahn\"&gt;Tapoke \"Slim\" Jahn&lt;/a&gt;, who is shocked at the sight of Lo'Gosh and exclaims that he's supposed to be dead. Lo'Gosh, Broll, and Valeera pursue Slim to a nearby tavern packed with Defias Brotherhood members. As soon as the trio enters, the Defias attack them and a vicious tavern brawl ensues. Thargas quickly joins the fray and saves Lo'Gosh's life by knocking out an eyepatch-clad &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; that was aiming a fireball at the human's head. Lo'Gosh thanks him for the assistance, but as the fight continues, Thargas expresses confusion at what Varian is doing in Menethil when the ceremony celebrating his return is taking place in Stormwind. After the fight is over, Thargas explains that he knows Varian since one of the king's past tutors was his brother &lt;a href=\"Hjalmar%20Anvilmar\"&gt;Hjalmar&lt;/a&gt;, who taught Varian dwarven combat stances such as the \"Anvilmar feint\". Thargas asks \"if you're here, then who are they embracing at Stormwind?\".\nDuring a banquet in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt;, Bolvar raises the issue of the Defias and &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s to \"Varian\", who is bored by the discussion and seems to only be interested in planning a hunt and ball with Katrana. Anduin reminds him that King Magni will be arriving the following day to discuss the incursions of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt;, but when Varian continues to only show interest in spending more of the kingdom's gold on entertainment, Anduin turns to Bolvar and wonders what could have caused this change to his father.\nBack in the tavern in Menethil, Thargas explains that the thugs he and the group fought were members of the Defias Brotherhood. Anvilmar notices a Dark Iron among the thugs and asks him why the Defias attacked them, to which the dwarf simply replies \"boss said 'kill'\". Broll points out that the drunkard the trio followed has disappeared. Valeera notices the thugs' leader, the dying one-eyed mage that Thargas knocked out. Lo'Gosh interrogates the man, who claims that he led the Defias who delivered Varian to the ship and that the person who wants Varian dead paid the Defias in Stormwind gold. The mage finally says that the Defias' employer won't give up and will destroy Varian's kingdom and murder his son. When the mage begins charging up a fireball in one of his hands, Valeera instantly drains him of magic and throws a dagger at his chest, killing him and angering Lo'Gosh and Broll. Valeera defends her decision by saying that the mage was about to kill Lo'Gosh and that they'd learned all they could from him anyway. Thargas agrees, but Lo'Gosh nonetheless tells Valeera that it was not her decision to make and that she should watch her thirst for magic, lest it betray them all in the end.\nAs the group leaves the tavern, Slim is seen running through the &lt;a href=\"Wetlands\"&gt;Wetlands&lt;/a&gt; away from town, resolving to seek out the Brotherhood and tell them that the king has returned."}

While the quests involved for each faction are different, their differences reflect negotiating the strife between the factions, rather than different processes.\nIn this chain, the player is instrumental in recovering a book that aids in identifying the hilt, and then in rebuilding the sword it had originally been a part of.\nThe Return of Quel'Delar.\nThe Dragonforged Hilt.\nAmong the wreckage you and your companions have left in the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Halls\"&gt;Frozen Halls&lt;/a&gt;, you find a &lt;a href=\"Battered%20Hilt\"&gt;Battered Hilt&lt;/a&gt;.\nYou examine the hilt and consider that your faction's representatives to the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Tournament\"&gt;Argent Tournament&lt;/a&gt; would be interested in hearing about it.\nYour contact finds the hilt designs hauntingly familiar, but cannot identify them.\nYour contact at Quel'Delar's Rest asks you to go to &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt; to talk to &lt;a href=\"Krasus\"&gt;Krasus&lt;/a&gt; - also known as the red dragon &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Korialstrasz&lt;/a&gt; - about the sword.\nYou meet with Krasus, but it turns out he'd already loaned out his reference book to an earlier visitor. While you are talking with Krasus, &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; flys in and assumes his half-elven guise. Krasus turns to Kalecgos for aid. Kalecgos is leery, having been burned by mortals wielding &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;draconic artifacts&lt;/a&gt; before. &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; puts an end to debate, noting that mortal champions have been using the Prismatic Blades against evil for quite some time now. Krasus urges you to meet with another contact in Dalaran.\nYour contact has discovered that the other side has an intelligence agent (spy) in the &lt;a href=\"Underbelly\"&gt;Underbelly&lt;/a&gt;. You are assigned to stop him, and retrieve any information he may have on him. Pretty much right where your agent told you, is the spy. You defeat him ... and the people nearby don't even cry out. The Underbelly is just that kind of place.\nYou search the body and find a note. The spy was to be a courier, taking the book to &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Delar%27s%20Rest\"&gt;Quel'Delar's Rest&lt;/a&gt;.\nYou are directed to go to &lt;a href=\"Shandy%20Glossgleam\"&gt;Shandy Glossgleam&lt;/a&gt;, who operates an elemental-powered laundry on the balcony above &lt;a href=\"Threads%20of%20Fate\"&gt;Threads of Fate&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;. Shandy owes a few favors to people, including your contact.\nYou meet with Shandy, and he's willing to help you, if you help him with the current load of laundry. As Shandy calls out instructions, you toss clothes into the wash, the elemental cleans them and tosses them on the clothes lines. After a bit, the laundry is done, and you \"borrow\" a tabard, promising to return it shortly.\nYour contact enchants the tabard to allow you to slip past the guards and meet with the person who borrowed the book from Wyrmrest. It works like ... well, a charm. You tell your contact you're ready to deliver his tome, he hands it to you, and you walk out with him none the wiser.\nYour contact takes the enchanted tabard back (to return to Shandy), and directs you back to Quel'Delar's Rest. You return to Icecrown, book in hand.\nYou meet there with the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Covenant\"&gt;Silver Covenant&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=\"Sunreavers\"&gt;Sunreavers&lt;/a&gt; representative there who starts leafing through the book. He soon identifies it, but...\nOut of nowhere, &lt;a href=\"Blood-Queen%20Lana%27thel\"&gt;Blood-Queen Lana'thel&lt;/a&gt; appears. The guards rush toward her, but she encases them in blocks of ice. She describes the history of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Delar\"&gt;Quel'Delar&lt;/a&gt;, its connection to &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Serrar\"&gt;Quel'Serrar&lt;/a&gt;, and how the blade came to be broken. Before leaving again, she announces, \"Quel'Delar will never serve another!\"\nYour representative, though, vows to see the sword restored.\nThe restoration of Quel'Delar.\nThe first step is to remake the blade. You are instructed to enter the &lt;a href=\"Pit%20of%20Saron\"&gt;Pit of Saron&lt;/a&gt;, find sufficient &lt;a href=\"Infused%20Saronite%20Bar\"&gt;Infused Saronite Bar&lt;/a&gt;s, and use &lt;a href=\"Forgemaster%20Garfrost\"&gt;Forgemaster Garfrost&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"The%20Forgemaster%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;hammer&lt;/a&gt; to reforge the sword. The Pit of Saron is no place to go alone. For this, you recruit a group of friends.\nIt's a giant hammer, as would befit the giant who uses it. He doesn't give it up willingly, but you manage to claw it from his cold, dead hands. The scourge guarding the infused saronite are similarly reluctant to part with their charges. But in the end, a large number of scourge lay dead (again), and you hold in your hands a blade composed of infused saronite.\nReturning to Quel'Delar's rest with the &lt;a href=\"Reforged%20Quel%27Delar\"&gt;Reforged Quel'Delar&lt;/a&gt;, it is determined that the saronite is too brittle to last in battle, and must be tempered. Your next task, then, is to temper the blade. A powerful blade like this can safely be tempered only in a location like the &lt;a href=\"Crucible%20of%20Souls\"&gt;Crucible of Souls&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Halls\"&gt;Frozen Halls&lt;/a&gt;. (\"Found at the end of the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Souls\"&gt;Forge of Souls&lt;/a&gt; instance.\")\nAgain, you recruit friends to assist you, and trek through the perils of the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Souls\"&gt;Forge of Souls&lt;/a&gt;. With the &lt;a href=\"Devourer%20of%20Souls\"&gt;Devourer of Souls&lt;/a&gt; defeated behind you, you use the Crucible of Souls, and retrieve the &lt;a href=\"Tempered%20Quel%27Delar\"&gt;Tempered Quel'Delar&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuel'Delar, however, has not responded as you and your representative had thought it would. It sits quietly in its sheath, showing no signs of power. Yet, the sword pulls at you, as if possessed of a will of its own.\nYou don't know why it pulls you, but unless you bring it where it wants to go, you may never know. You find that the sword pulls you to the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Reflection\"&gt;Halls of Reflection&lt;/a&gt;. Your representative tells you he will wait in &lt;a href=\"The%20Frozen%20Halls\"&gt;The Frozen Halls&lt;/a&gt; outside while you go in to see what the sword wants.\nYou approach &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt; with Quel'Delar, and &lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther the Lightbringer&lt;/a&gt; appears, warning you not to approach. Too late, though, as Quel'Delar leaps to life and whirls around toward you. You are forced to &lt;a href=\"Subdued%20Quel%27Delar\"&gt;subdue the sword&lt;/a&gt; lest it take your life.\nUther tells you that you've forged the sword from the very blood of an old god, and instructs you to swiftly take Quel'Delar to the Sunwell, where it can be purified.\nThe new bearer of Quel'Delar.\nAs promised, you find your representative waiting for you in the Frozen Halls. He tells you to that Uther is undoubtably right, that you won't be able to maintain control of Quel'Delar while it still has the Lich King's influence upon it. He directs you to go to the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Isle of Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt; and speak to &lt;a href=\"Halduron%20Brightwing\"&gt;Halduron Brightwing&lt;/a&gt;, who will be inspecting the guards at the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;.\nFrom Icecrown citadel to Quel'Danas is a sizable journey by boat, but other means are available to you. (\"A mage can teleport you to &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt; where you can then take the portal to Quel'Danas as a shortcut; otherwise you have to use the standard flightpaths available to your faction in &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;.\") You soon arrive at the entrance to the Sunwell, and face the Sunwell Guards, along with Halduron Brightwing himself.\nHalduron proclaims that the Sunwell is a sacred place for his people, and no place for tourists and curiosity seekers. You explain your mission, however, and he relents - slightly. He explains that the last bearer of Quel'Delar, &lt;a href=\"Thalorien%20Dawnseeker\"&gt;Thalorien Dawnseeker&lt;/a&gt;, fell in a holding action against the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, buying time for his men to prepare for the defense of the Sunwell. If his spirit gives you its blessing, he is willing to admit you to the Sunwell.\nAs directed, you go to the Dead Scar on the Island, where the Scourge army had passed. There you find the &lt;a href=\"Thalorien%20Dawnseeker%27s%20Remains\"&gt;remains of Thalorien Dawnseeker&lt;/a&gt;. Quel'Delar awakens echoes of the past. You see Thalorien Dawnseeker ordering his men to withdraw to the Sunwell. As they leave, Thalorien's ghost notices you, and asks if you will stay to aid him against the Scourge.\nThe ghost of &lt;a href=\"Morlen%20Coldgrip\"&gt;Morlen Coldgrip&lt;/a&gt; appears before the two of you, and sends wave after wave of (ghostly) undead minions against you, until finally he determines to kill you himself. Unlike the past, where Thalorien fell in combat, you are able this time to save him. Thalorien recognizes that you bear Quel'Delar, and proclaims that the blade has chosen you to be its new wielder.\nYou return to Halduron Brightwing at the entrance to the Sunwell, who admits to surprise at your success. He tells you that the leaders of &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt; await inside the Sunwell chamber. You are told that the sword will bond to you once it is immersed in the Sunwell.\nYou speak to a &lt;a href=\"Warden%20of%20the%20Sunwell\"&gt;Warden of the Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;, and are escorted inside to the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20the%20Eclipse\"&gt;Shrine of the Eclipse&lt;/a&gt;. You see gathered there are a number of &lt;a href=\"Sunwell%20Honor%20Guard\"&gt;Sunwell Honor Guard&lt;/a&gt;s, as well as &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Rommath\"&gt;Grand Magister Rommath&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Auric%20Sunchaser\"&gt;Captain Auric Sunchaser&lt;/a&gt;. Your approach is heralded by &lt;a href=\"Chamberlain%20Galiros\"&gt;Chamberlain Galiros&lt;/a&gt;, announcing you as the bearer of Quel'Delar.\nGrand Magister Rommath encases you in a block of ice. The honor guard encircle you and demand you surrender. Fortunately, Auric Sunchaser calms things down, and explains that \"Quel'Delar is not chosen, it chooses its own master\". Rommath reluctantly agrees, and instructs the guards to return to their posts.\nGreatly disappointed, Rommath instructs you to take the sword and leave, and has a sharp word for Captain Sunchaser as well. Sunchaser directs you to take the sword through the portal provided, and thanks you for having restored Quel'Delar.\nFor a &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elf&lt;/a&gt; player, the chain plays out differently. Instead of attempting to take the blade, Lor'themar only inspects it, and gives the player strong words of support along with Rommath and Auric - naming the player a hero and inspiration to the sin'dorei. Rommath instructs the player to take Quel'Delar and visit &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Aethas%20Sunreaver\"&gt;Archmage Aethas Sunreaver&lt;/a&gt;, and that the sin'dorei will rise up to face any foe without fear.\nVictory!\nAt this point, one of three things can happen.\nSword wielders.\nYour representative (&lt;a href=\"Caladis%20Brightspear\"&gt;Caladis Brightspear&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=\"Myralion%20Sunblaze\"&gt;Myralion Sunblaze&lt;/a&gt;) directs you to the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Citadel\"&gt;Violet Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, where the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Covenant\"&gt;Silver Covenant&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=\"Sunreavers\"&gt;Sunreavers&lt;/a&gt; awaits.\nThe leader congratulates you personally, and notes that already Quel'Delar is adapting itself to your strengths. More, he announces to the entire city that you are the new bearer of Quel'Delar!\nOthers.\nCharacters who cannot wield swords still get nifty rewards, just not Quel'Delar.\nYour representative sends you to &lt;a href=\"Justicar%20Mariel%20Trueheart\"&gt;Justicar Mariel Trueheart&lt;/a&gt; (instead of the the head of your faction). \nRewards.\nYou earn .\nSword wielders are able to choose one of:\nClasses that cannot wield swords are instead given the choice of:\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;\nSummary.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;# &lt;a href=\"The%20Battered%20Hilt\"&gt;The Battered Hilt&lt;/a&gt;\nSee also.\n&lt;a href=\"Quel%27Delar\"&gt;Quel'Delar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/underdev/3p3/queldelar.xml\"&gt;History of Quel'Delar&lt;/a&gt;"}

It is one of the primary professions. Materials from mining and the items miners can create from them are reagents needed for recipes within other professions.\nMining pointers:\nFor other articles related to Mining, see the .\nOfficial overview.\n\"Miners pursue valuable and useful ores, extracting them straight from the earth with their picks. Their familiarity with the land gives them a strong notion of where rich veins of gold, silver or even more precious metals can be found, and they retrieve and smelt these minerals for profit, or for use in metalworking of all types.\n\"Miners can spot mineral &lt;a href=\"vein\"&gt;vein&lt;/a&gt;s on their &lt;a href=\"mini-map\"&gt;mini-map&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Find%20Minerals\"&gt;Find Minerals&lt;/a&gt; ability, and they can gather them quickly (by simply right-clicking on the vein). Miners require &lt;a href=\"mining%20pick\"&gt;mining pick&lt;/a&gt;s in order to break apart stones and retrieve valuable ores, and, in order to smelt those ores into &lt;a href=\"bar\"&gt;bar&lt;/a&gt;s, they need to be near a &lt;a href=\"forge\"&gt;forge&lt;/a&gt; (found in most cities). As you continue to exercise your mining skills and smelt complex combinations of ores into alloys, your Mining skill will grow. High skill values are required to successfully retrieve the rarest minerals.\n\"Mining is a gathering profession. It's often paired with complementary crafting professions, particularly &lt;a href=\"Blacksmithing\"&gt;Blacksmithing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Engineering\"&gt;Engineering&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jewelcrafting\"&gt;Jewelcrafting&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Minerals can be found all over &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, though some areas are more mineral-rich than others. Valuable and rare minerals are often difficult to find, but the rewards are worth it - they can command high prices and form potent metals.\"\nUses.\nMining is a complementary profession to &lt;a href=\"blacksmithing\"&gt;blacksmithing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"engineering\"&gt;engineering&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"jewelcrafting\"&gt;jewelcrafting&lt;/a&gt;. These professions rely specifically on ore and ore-derived materials.\nMining can be a profitable gathering profession because of the large sums utilized by the other primary professions. Jewelcrafters require five ore per &lt;a href=\"prospect\"&gt;prospect&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"blacksmiths\"&gt;blacksmiths&lt;/a&gt; can use dozens of bars for specific items, and engineers use large amounts of ore for the many consumable materials they can create.\nEconomical gain.\nAs with any gathering professional, low-level characters and characters without economic support may consider using two gathering professions. While this denies the player the ability to directly enhance his or her equipment/abilities, it does allow one to, in theory, make money quickly and easily through the use of the &lt;a href=\"auction%20house\"&gt;auction house&lt;/a&gt;.\nRegardless of the method chosen, mining can be profitable. With regards to mining, be sure to check the local prices of your ore against the local prices of your smelted bars. Frequently ores will be more valuable because they can be prospected or smelted for skill points. This desirability leads to increased cost per unit.\nTools and abilities.\nA trained apprentice miner will immediately learn the &lt;a href=\"Find%20Minerals\"&gt;Find Minerals&lt;/a&gt; ability, which highlights nearby nodes on the &lt;a href=\"mini-map\"&gt;mini-map&lt;/a&gt;. A miner will also learn the accompanying &lt;a href=\"Smelting\"&gt;Smelting&lt;/a&gt; skill. This skill is used to convert one or more ore and &lt;a href=\"elemental%20ingredients\"&gt;elemental ingredients&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"bar\"&gt;bar&lt;/a&gt;s, which are used in various professions. This skill can only be used in the vicinity of a &lt;a href=\"forge\"&gt;forge&lt;/a&gt;, and will occasionally grant skill points depending on the player's profession level.\nIn addition to a miner's pick and their ore-sensing abilities, dedicated ore farming may require a &lt;a href=\"Bag%23Craft%20Bag\"&gt;bag&lt;/a&gt;. There are a few mining-specialized bags that can be crafted or bought. These bags typically have &lt;a href=\"Mining%20Sack\"&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Reinforced%20Mining%20Bag\"&gt;28&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Mammoth%20Mining%20Bag\"&gt;32&lt;/a&gt; slots respectively and will automatically store mined ores. Mining-bags can also store rocks and elemental items found by mining, smelted bars, a few items created in &lt;a href=\"Jewelcrafting\"&gt;Jewelcrafting&lt;/a&gt;, a few items used in &lt;a href=\"Blacksmithing\"&gt;Blacksmithing&lt;/a&gt;, and mining picks. For a list, click &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wowhead.com/item%3D38347%23can-contain\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorthy of note.\nUntil &lt;a href=\"patch%205.0.4\"&gt;patch 5.0.4&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Mining%20Pick\"&gt;mining pick&lt;/a&gt; was required to be in the player's inventory or equipped to mine nodes in-game. It is no longer required, but provides a passive bonus to your mining skill.\nMining skill and its increase.\nDifferent veins will require different mining skill levels to loot (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Mithril\"&gt;Mithril&lt;/a&gt; veins require a skill of 175). The relative difficulty of the mining attempt is color coded as all other crafting and gathering professions:\nAlthough the same colors are used as for other professions, the actual odds of getting a skill point are considerably higher than the color would indicate. For example, at skill 60, a copper vein will appear green but have a ~80% chance of giving a you a skill point. In general, if a node is of the highest-level type of ore you can mine (not counting rare veins like silver or gold), there is a very high chance you will gain a skill point.\nTo mine a &lt;a href=\"vein\"&gt;vein&lt;/a&gt;, right-click on it. After a brief animation, a &lt;a href=\"Loot%20Window\"&gt;loot window&lt;/a&gt; will appear containing &lt;a href=\"ore\"&gt;ore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"stone\"&gt;stone&lt;/a&gt; and sometimes rare drops like &lt;a href=\"gem\"&gt;gem&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"elemental%20ingredient%23Elemental%20Motes\"&gt;motes&lt;/a&gt;. Nodes that are orange or yellow in difficulty will likely skill your mining ability, so it is important to focus on these nodes when leveling this profession.\nPrior to &lt;a href=\"patch%203.0.8\"&gt;patch 3.0.8&lt;/a&gt;, mining a node completely required multiple attempts, one for each unit of ore. As such, each node could yield a one point of skill increase per miner. This would allow several players in a raid or group to mine the same node for a skill-up. Since that patch, a single mining attempt extracts all available loot from the vein. Alternatively, miners can share a node for a skill-up by not looting the vein. This allowed multiple miners to gain a skill point (or \"tap\") a vein, but only one miner will receive all the ore. This again changed in &lt;a href=\"patch%204.0.1\"&gt;patch 4.0.1&lt;/a&gt;, prior to the launch of &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;; Ore nodes (indeed, any Herb nodes or skinnable corpses) can now only be tapped by one player at a time. If a player attempts to mine it while another player is, the player receives the error \"This object is already tapped\".\n&lt;a href=\"Patch%205.3\"&gt;Patch 5.3&lt;/a&gt; changed &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; mining yields to be determined by skill level.\nAs of &lt;a href=\"patch%206.0\"&gt;patch 6.0&lt;/a&gt;, all mining nodes could be mined from level 1, however miners whose skill was too low would receive nuggets which combined to form a unit of &lt;a href=\"ore\"&gt;ore&lt;/a&gt;\nFrom \"&lt;a href=\"Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt;\" onwards, new nodes can all be mined from level 1 assuming the miner has the relevant proficiency. Nodes for new ores no longer give nuggets and skill does not determine yields. Base skill level is a hidden prerequisites for &lt;a href=\"mining%20quests\"&gt;mining quests&lt;/a&gt; which reward &lt;a href=\"mining%20techniques\"&gt;mining techniques&lt;/a&gt; that grant improved yields or bonus resources.\nSmelting provides an opportunity to level mining at a faster pace. Smelting large stores of collected ore can be smelted \"en masse\" and in large quantities. Since patch 3.0.8, it has been possible to level from 1-375 only via smelting, but this is expensive, since at certain skill ranges there is a very low chance of gaining a skill point. \nThere are \"rare\" spawns of various ore veins in place of more common metals. Specifically:\nThese vein types are visually distinct from normal veins. They typically have a glossier, shinier model than normal ore veins.\nAdditionally, certain ore nodes have \"Rich\" nodes that can spawn in higher-level locations. The following ore can be found in Normal and Rich veins:\nMining products.\nBy skill level.\nSee &lt;a href=\"Mining%20proficiencies\"&gt;Mining proficiencies&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Smelt\"&gt;Smelt&lt;/a&gt; proficiencies.\nQuest items.\nFormer quest ores.\nQuest ore is usually mined off special nodes, but can also drop off certain mobs in the same area. The ores cannot be smelted and are not \"quest items\" \"per se\", so they can be traded or purchased off the AH."}

When you perform this research, you have a very high chance of &lt;a href=\"discovery\"&gt;learning&lt;/a&gt; a new &lt;a href=\"minor%20glyph\"&gt;minor glyph&lt;/a&gt; recipe. The chance to discover a new minor glyph is independent of your level, Inscription skill, and how many minor glyphs you already know. The recipe's cooldown resets at 00:00 server time every day.\nDiscoverable recipes.\nAll 64 &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Glyph\"&gt;Minor Glyph&lt;/a&gt; recipes currently in the game can be discovered through Minor Inscription Research. You will learn 1 random minor glyph recipe from among all those you are able to learn. If you cannot learn any new minor glyph recipes (because your inscription skill is too low to learn any of the missing glyphs, or because you already know all of the minor glyphs), you will not learn any but will still acquire the by-product scrolls (see also below).\n \"Please add any available information to this section.\"\nLeveling.\nThe research doesn't go yellow until 125, so it is far and away the cheapest way to level inscription, though the cooldown makes it the slowest as well.\nObtaining new glyphs.\nThere are currently a total of sixty-four minor glyphs in the game: six or seven for each of the ten classes, meaning that it will take at least two months of daily research to learn them all. Many minor glyphs require more than 75 skill in Inscription to learn; most notably the &lt;a href=\"Death%20Knight\"&gt;Death Knight&lt;/a&gt; glyphs and the glyphs for abilities that require level 60 or higher, such as &lt;a href=\"Glyph%20of%20Enduring%20Victory\"&gt;Glyph of Enduring Victory&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Glyph%20of%20Shadowfiend\"&gt;Glyph of Shadowfiend&lt;/a&gt;. These glyphs will not affect your discovery chance if you have a low Inscription skill, as which glyph you discover is randomized among the glyphs you \"can\" learn. If you have learned all of the minor glyph recipes you have enough skill for, you will not discover anything when researching.\nThe level at which a given glyph can be discovered is usually dependent on the quality of ink / parchment required for it:\nOne notable exception is &lt;a href=\"Glyph%20of%20Levitate\"&gt;Glyph of Levitate&lt;/a&gt;, which requires &lt;a href=\"Jadefire%20Ink\"&gt;Jadefire Ink&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=\"Common%20Parchment\"&gt;Common Parchment&lt;/a&gt; but 175 Inscription to discover.\nBy-products.\nIn addition to the discovery chance, a random quantity (1-3) of a random type of scroll is produced. The types of scrolls that can be produced are the same as what you would normally be able to make when you first learn Minor Inscription Research. Having a higher skill in Inscription has no effect on the kind, quantity, or quality of scrolls produced.\nThe possible by-product scrolls are:"}

After the end of the [[Third War]], both the [[goblin]]s and [[gnome]]s decided that the large alkali desert known as the Shimmering Flats near [[Thousand Needles]] would be a perfect place to test their new rocket designs. The natural animosity between the two engineering teams created the perfect opportunity for races to see once and for all whether [[Goblin Engineering]] or [[Gnome Engineering]] was superior.\nBackground.\nThe Mirage Raceway eventually become a unique draw for both the [[Horde]] and the [[Alliance]], as supporters came to cheer on their respective favorites. Races between the [[Gnome Drag Car|gnome]] and [[Goblin Drag Car|goblin]] [[Rocket car|drag cars]] took place daily, as both teams scrambled to come up with improvements that would give their side an edge. The track also drew a number of seedy types, attracted to the prospect of gambling on the winner.\nIn the RPG and early WoW, a [[crowd pummeler]] raced for the gnomish team.\nCataclysm.\nDuring the Cataclysm, the whole of Thousand Needles was flooded by the ocean as a crumbling canyon wall collapsed into the Shimmering Flats. The Raceway, therefore, was submerged. [[Fizzle Brassbolts|Fizzle]] and [[Pozzik]] built [[Fizzle and Pozzik's Speedbarge|a \"Speedbarge\"]] to float above the ruined raceway.\nIn the RPG.\n[[File:MirageRacewayRPG.jpg|thumb|Announcement]]\nGoblin and gnome [[tinker]]s labored constantly to perfect the ultimate racing machines. At regular intervals, they participated in trials of their creations, and twice monthly the Mirage Raceway hosted a series of events to determine which side was the best. While no prizes were officially awarded, being \"the best\" was usually enough. Besides, there was plenty of betting going on behind the scenes to make a shrewd gambler a tidy fortune \u2014 or break the bank if he chose poorly.\nAt the start of each month, the [[Mirage Raceway Independent Oversight Committee]] (MRIOC) announced the parameters for the next race (length, vehicle class, special rules, and so on). The first race was considered the \"preliminaries\", while the final race of the month determined the overall winner. The side that achieved victory then lorded it over the losers for the next month.\nSpeculation.\nSince MEGA sponsors the [[Fizzle and Pozzik's Speedbarge]] [[Annual Fizzle and Pozzik's Speedbarge Boat Race|annual boat race]] and races similar to that, it can be speculated that they sponsored the races of the Mirage Raceway before it was flooded and replaced by the Speedbarge.\nExternal links.\n[[Category:Classic subzones]]\n[[Category:Lands of Mystery]]\n[[Category:Destroyed settlements]]\n[[Category:Gnome territories]]\n[[Category:Goblin territories]]\n[[Category:Neutral settlements]]\n[[Category:Villages]]"}

It is distinguished from &lt;a href=\"main%20spec\"&gt;main spec&lt;/a&gt; and can be created through &lt;a href=\"dual%20spec\"&gt;dual spec&lt;/a&gt;. The term \"off spec\" is not to be confused with \"off tanking\" or \"off healing\", situations where the player is only intended to intermittently supplement the role of another player already in the group. Rather than re-spec, some players carry multiple sets of equipments for these alternate roles. Players who off-spec frequently tend to purchase &lt;a href=\"dual%20spec\"&gt;dual spec&lt;/a&gt;s; in that case the \"offspec\" may be the one played less frequently or the one lacking gear as high quality as the usual spec.\nPlayers willing to off spec theoretically have an easier time getting groups, especially if the alternate role and its associated gear is close to the primary one and no one else in the group is able to fill that role at all. However, this can depend on how paranoid a group is about bringing non-&lt;a href=\"minmax\"&gt;minmax&lt;/a&gt;ed players to particular instances, especially in the roles of &lt;a href=\"tank\"&gt;tank&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"healer\"&gt;healer&lt;/a&gt;s rather than just &lt;a href=\"pewpew\"&gt;pewpew&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"PUG\"&gt;PUG&lt;/a&gt;s tend to be less willing than &lt;a href=\"guild\"&gt;guild&lt;/a&gt;s to accept them, so it is good etiquette to mention if you are doing to avoid complaints of under-performance later."}

A &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt; can easily play the role of off tank as well. &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt;s mostly rely on being attacked to generate threat, as such they are not as well suited to off-tank unless done from the very beginning of a fight. In the case of multiple tanks in a raid group or instance, spec, gear, and class can be compared to determine tanking responsibilities (i.e. who will &lt;a href=\"main%20tank\"&gt;main tank&lt;/a&gt; and who will off tank specific encounters); like many aspects of raids, careful planning regarding tank strategy will reduce the confusion and lack of organization that lead to wipes.\nThere are two popular noun-definitions for the term \"off tank\".\nThis term is also used as a verb, meaning \"to execute the tasks of either of the above roles\"."}
