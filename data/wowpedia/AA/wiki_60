It is located in the &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, and its citizens are under the watchful and often worried eye of elected &lt;a href=\"Magistrate%20Solomon\"&gt;Magistrate Solomon&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Recently&lt;/a&gt;, after many years, the &lt;a href=\"Everstill%20Bridge\"&gt;bridge to Lakeshire&lt;/a&gt; was finally repaired.\n&lt;a href=\"Marshal%20Marris\"&gt;Marshal Marris&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Guard\"&gt;Stormwind Guard&lt;/a&gt; is in charge of the security of town and its surrounding areas.\nRedridge is classified as a &lt;a href=\"Contested%20territory\"&gt;contested zone&lt;/a&gt; but contains no &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"flight%20point\"&gt;flight point&lt;/a&gt; or quests. However, it is a very short ride away from the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Steppes\"&gt;Burning Steppes&lt;/a&gt;, a high-level zone, and thus many Horde players choose to engage in raids there.\nHistory.\nFirst War and aftermath.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; led a small &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; raiding party into the Redridge Mountains, seeking to claim Lakeshire as a &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; stronghold. &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt; led his &lt;a href=\"knight\"&gt;knight&lt;/a&gt;s down the slopes and ambushed the orcs and almost succeeded in defeating them. Blackhand was accompanied by two &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s who turned the tide of battle and forced Lothar to retreat. Blackhand and the other survivors left the area as well but returned after several weeks with a larger force and took Lakeshire and the surrounding land.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, Lakeshire and Redridge would be retaken by Stormwind.\nAround the year 17, &lt;a href=\"Greydon%20Thorne\"&gt;Greydon Thorne&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ceya%20Northbrooke%20Thorne%20Glade\"&gt;Ceya Northbrooke&lt;/a&gt; wed and moved here to live in a cottage. They had their son &lt;a href=\"Aramar%20Thorne\"&gt;Aramar Thorne&lt;/a&gt;, but after six years, Greydon abandoned the family. Two years later, &lt;a href=\"Magistrate%20Solomon\"&gt;Magistrate Solomon&lt;/a&gt; declared Greydon dead, allowing Ceya to marry one of the town's &lt;a href=\"Smith\"&gt;blacksmiths&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Robb%20Glade\"&gt;Robb Glade&lt;/a&gt;. Robb left his forge and moved to Ceya's cottage where he built a new forge alongside the cottage. Their home would be known as the Glade cottage, and they eventually had two more children. Aram spent his childhood here, learning with his stepfather the blacksmith craft. Aram, his dog &lt;a href=\"Soot%20%28dog%29\"&gt;Soot&lt;/a&gt;, his friends, &lt;a href=\"Stitch\"&gt;Stitch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Willy%20%28human%29\"&gt;Willy&lt;/a&gt; would play at the Lakeshire &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Everstill\"&gt;quarry&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nLike &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Duskwood\"&gt;Duskwood&lt;/a&gt;, the Redridge Mountains was also under the theoretical protection of the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; army and \u2014 like them \u2014 has been left mostly to its own devices. However, there was a small guard platoon stationed in Lakeshire to maintain order in the town and they also originally had a garrison of soldiers in &lt;a href=\"Stonewatch\"&gt;Stonewatch&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Stonewatch%20Keep\"&gt;Stonewatch Keep&lt;/a&gt; however, was overrun by &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock orcs&lt;/a&gt; who were presumably fueled by the evil magic of &lt;a href=\"Morganth\"&gt;Morganth&lt;/a&gt;. Shortly after their victory, Morganth turned on his orcish cohorts. He constructed an arcane tower, the &lt;a href=\"Tower%20of%20Ilgalar\"&gt;Tower of Ilgalar&lt;/a&gt;, and used his powers to build a small army of &lt;a href=\"Shadowhide%20Gnoll%20Clan\"&gt;Shadowhide&lt;/a&gt; gnolls led by , to serve his malicious bidding. Both orc and man had fallen victim to the brutes that serve Morganth. Meanwhile, the Blackrock orcs continued to assault Lakeshire in their bid to conquer Redridge. Lakeshire continued to fend them off but they were sorely in need of more reinforcements and supplies. During one of the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20orc\"&gt;Blackrock orc&lt;/a&gt; assaults on Lakeshire, &lt;a href=\"Everstill%20Bridge\"&gt;Everstill Bridge&lt;/a&gt; was damaged. &lt;a href=\"Foreman%20Oslow\"&gt;Foreman Oslow&lt;/a&gt; also led a crew of bridge workers in repairing the bridge but their work was slowed due to losing various supplies to the orc invasions.\nThe dwarves of Ironforge sent a group to Lakeshire's aid against the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s, made up of &lt;a href=\"Moira%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Princess Moira Bronzebezard&lt;/a&gt; and her retinue, but they were ambushed and captured in the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Steppes\"&gt;Burning Steppes&lt;/a&gt;.\nSometime later, &lt;a href=\"Helendis%20Riverhorn\"&gt;Helendis Riverhorn&lt;/a&gt; gave &lt;a href=\"Magistrate%20Solomon\"&gt;Magistrate Solomon&lt;/a&gt; evidence that the Blackrock orcs were allying themselves with the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;. Solomon relayed this information to Highlord &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; and pleaded with him to mobilize the Stormwind army to contend with this grave threat to the kingdom. Bolvar however, was debilitated from sending Stormwind's thinly spread troops to aid Lakeshire without proof. Bolvar sent &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to Lady &lt;a href=\"Katrana%20Prestor\"&gt;Katrana Prestor&lt;/a&gt;, who knew much of &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"dragonkin\"&gt;dragonkin&lt;/a&gt;. However, Lady Prestor thought very little of Magistrate Solomon's claims and advised against providing the military aid. Though Bolvar respected Lady Prestor's stance, he could not let Solomon's plight go unheeded and thought of a compromise to appease all parties: Bolvar deputized the adventurers and empowered them to solve Solomon's problems.\nLakeshire was under constant attack from the Blackrock orcs, &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20pack\"&gt;Redridge&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Shadowhide%20Gnoll%20Clan\"&gt;Shadowhide&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt;s; and also lacked a proper defense. Magistrate Solomon pleaded for reinforcements from all of Stormwind's territories, yet to no avail as all of Stormwind were preoccupied with their own troubles. Left to their own devices, Solomon and &lt;a href=\"Marshal%20Marris\"&gt;Marshal Marris&lt;/a&gt; had to enlist the aid of the adventurers to deal with the hostile orc and gnoll incursions and dispatch the prominent orc and gnoll warlords. Meanwhile, agents of &lt;a href=\"Theocritus\"&gt;Theocritus&lt;/a&gt; were sent to dispatch Morganth and end his evil once and for all.\nAside from gnolls and orcs, Lakeshire also faced a &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt; problem and occasionally employed adventurers to cull their numbers in order to preserve &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Everstill\"&gt;Lake Everstill&lt;/a&gt;'s fish stock.\nCataclysm.\nWith the guidance of the dragon &lt;a href=\"Darkblaze\"&gt;Darkblaze&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Horde\"&gt;Dark Horde&lt;/a&gt; and their &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20pack\"&gt;Redridge&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt; allies have also begun invading Redridge sometime after the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;. Although &lt;a href=\"Everstill%20Bridge\"&gt;Everstill Bridge&lt;/a&gt; was at long last repaired, &lt;a href=\"Marshal%20Marris\"&gt;Marshal Marris&lt;/a&gt; stated the local guard were overwhelmed with the Dark Horde's incursions; which is further exacerbated now that the gnolls have begun raiding their supplies. The &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Stormwind\"&gt;Kingdom of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; has sought to consolidate Redridge's security by constructing &lt;a href=\"Tower%20Watch\"&gt;Tower Watch&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Three%20Corners\"&gt;Three Corners&lt;/a&gt; and stationing a garrison of &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Garrison%20Watchman\"&gt;Redridge Watchmen&lt;/a&gt; there. Many s were lined up for an audience with &lt;a href=\"Magistrate%20Solomon\"&gt;Magistrate Solomon&lt;/a&gt;, angry with his inability to deal with the Dark Horde's kidnapping of their citizens. An &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; deputized by the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Army\"&gt;Stormwind Army&lt;/a&gt; traveled to Redridge to aid the beleaguered Stormwind guards and reform &lt;a href=\"Bravo%20Company\"&gt;Bravo Company&lt;/a&gt; to combat the threat.\n&lt;a href=\"John%20J.%20Keeshan\"&gt;John J. Keeshan&lt;/a&gt; led Bravo Company in an assault on &lt;a href=\"Render%27s%20Valley\"&gt;Render's Valley&lt;/a&gt;, freeing the Redridge prisoners of war located there and then decimating it in an explosion which turned it into a crater.\nBravo Company then discovered from the prisoners that the &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"Galardell%20Valley\"&gt;Galardell Valley&lt;/a&gt; were being controlled by a powerful magus in the &lt;a href=\"Tower%20of%20Ilgalar\"&gt;Tower of Ilgalar&lt;/a&gt;. After retrieving the &lt;a href=\"Key%20of%20Ilgalar\"&gt;key&lt;/a&gt; to its entrance from &lt;a href=\"General%20Fangore\"&gt;General Fangore&lt;/a&gt;, Bravo Company confronted &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magus%20Doane\"&gt;Grand Magus Doane&lt;/a&gt;, who alluded to &lt;a href=\"Darkblaze\"&gt;Darkblaze&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 the mastermind behind the invasion \u2014 before teleporting away.\nThe Bravo Company later assaulted &lt;a href=\"Stonewatch\"&gt;Stonewatch&lt;/a&gt;, the stronghold of the Blackrock orcs, which culminated in a battle against a &lt;a href=\"black%20dragon\"&gt;black dragon&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Darkblaze\"&gt;Darkblaze&lt;/a&gt;. During the battle, all members of Bravo Company were killed except for the adventurer, &lt;a href=\"Colonel%20Troteman\"&gt;Colonel Troteman&lt;/a&gt;, and Keeshan, who jumped onto the dying dragon's back. Darkblaze flew over &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Everstill\"&gt;Lake Everstill&lt;/a&gt;, and after some struggle, both of them fell into the lake's waters. Both Keeshan and Darkblaze were presumed to have died in the fight, and several of Keeshan's belongings were later recovered by Lakeshire's townspeople. Colonel Troteman stated that &lt;a href=\"Jorgensen\"&gt;Jorgensen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Messner\"&gt;Messner&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Krakauer\"&gt;Krakauer&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Danforth\"&gt;Danforth&lt;/a&gt; would receive a proper burial.\nAt some point, the \"&lt;a href=\"Cloudkicker\"&gt;Cloudkicker&lt;/a&gt;\" brought &lt;a href=\"Makasa%20Flintwill\"&gt;Makasa Flintwill&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hackle\"&gt;Hackle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Murky%20%28Traveler%29\"&gt;Murky&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Galena%20Stormspear\"&gt;Galena Stormspear&lt;/a&gt; to Redridge. When they disembarked, they quickly found Aram's house near the center of the village, and Makasa told the Glades her and Aram's story. The Glades allowed them to stay in the house. When Makasa went to sleep, the &lt;a href=\"Voice%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Voice of the Light&lt;/a&gt; showed her the location of another shard of the &lt;a href=\"Diamond%20Blade\"&gt;Diamond Blade&lt;/a&gt; - the backyard of the house. Years ago, Greydon buried it here. Upon finding another shard in a cave, Makasa's group remained in a grove close to the village. After Makasa found the final shard, they returned to the Glade house, devising the next steps of their rescue mission. After securing the help from the &lt;a href=\"Everstill%20murlocs\"&gt;Everstill murlocs&lt;/a&gt;, Makasa and her friends left Lakeshire and Redridge, vowing to bring Aramar and Greydon back home which she successfully did. One final time, Gazlowe and the \"Cloudkicker\" came to Lakeshire to take Aramar back to &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the town's inn was infiltrated by &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Ranger%20Lyana\"&gt;Dark Ranger Lyana&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champion&lt;/a&gt; in search of &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;. The trail of information they followed there, through the ramblings of several guards and other townspeople, eventually led them to Saurfang in Stormwind.\nShadowlands.\nAfter the destruction of the &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Helm of Domination&lt;/a&gt;, Lakeshire was attacked by the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; when they began rampaging. This resulted in the deaths of several citizens, including &lt;a href=\"Verner%20Osgood\"&gt;Verner Osgood&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ben%20Howell\"&gt;Ben Howell&lt;/a&gt;. It is unknown, but likely, that others perished during this skirmish.\nPhasing.\nThe area to the north of &lt;a href=\"Everstill%20Bridge\"&gt;Everstill Bridge&lt;/a&gt; is currently populated by Bridge Workers &lt;a href=\"Bridge%20Worker%20Alex\"&gt;Alex&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bridge%20Worker%20Trent\"&gt;Trent&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bridge%20Worker%20Matthew\"&gt;Matthew&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bridge%20Worker%20Jess\"&gt;Jess&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bridge%20Worker%20Dmitri\"&gt;Dmitri&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bridge%20Worker%20Daniel\"&gt;Daniel&lt;/a&gt;. They are attempting to push a large boulder blocking the road, with &lt;a href=\"Foreman%20Oslow\"&gt;Foreman Oslow&lt;/a&gt; crushed underneath. Following the quest &lt;a href=\"He%20Who%20Controls%20the%20Ettins\"&gt;He Who Controls the Ettins&lt;/a&gt;, which starts from a drop from the local gnolls, the player controls an &lt;a href=\"ettin\"&gt;ettin&lt;/a&gt; and moves &lt;a href=\"Saving%20Foreman%20Oslow\"&gt;the boulder&lt;/a&gt; as the workers cower in fear. Both the boulder and the workers will disappear following the completion of this quest, and Foreman Oslow will take his new position on the dock. Note that this is actually an optional side chain to the quest &lt;a href=\"Canyon%20Romp\"&gt;Canyon Romp&lt;/a&gt; and it is entirely possible for the player to complete both the storyline and the achievement &lt;a href=\"%3ARedridge%20Mountains%20Quests\"&gt;:Redridge Mountains Quests&lt;/a&gt; without doing it.\nAnother minor bit of phasing takes place after accepting the quest &lt;a href=\"It%27s%20Never%20Over\"&gt;It's Never Over&lt;/a&gt;. The water to the east of Everstill Bridge will have a riverboat during this quest, with &lt;a href=\"John%20J.%20Keeshan\"&gt;John J. Keeshan&lt;/a&gt; and the members of &lt;a href=\"Bravo%20Company\"&gt;Bravo Company&lt;/a&gt; on it. There is also some phasing within the &lt;a href=\"Lakeshire%20Inn\"&gt;Lakeshire Inn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lakeshire%20Town%20Hall\"&gt;Lakeshire Town Hall&lt;/a&gt; involving Keeshan's storyline.\nIn the RPG.\nLakeshire is a sleepy town, a blessing for those who just passed through the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Steppes\"&gt;Burning Steppes&lt;/a&gt; to reach &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;. Some travelers don't even make it to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;; they would rather stay in Lakeshire. Populated by everyone from &lt;a href=\"farmer\"&gt;farmer&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"fisher\"&gt;fisher&lt;/a&gt;s, to retired &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s, it is a diverse town where people are friendly and keep their secrets to themselves. Welcoming to strangers, Lakeshire offers many &lt;a href=\"inn\"&gt;inn&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"tavern\"&gt;tavern&lt;/a&gt;s where a traveler can enjoy &lt;a href=\"ale\"&gt;ale&lt;/a&gt;. You can spend the day fishing on &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Everstill\"&gt;Lake Everstill&lt;/a&gt;, the night drinking in the tavern, and call that a good vacation. The most serious person in the town is &lt;a href=\"Magistrate%20Solomon\"&gt;Magistrate Solomon&lt;/a&gt;, who is dedicated to keeping the town safe from &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt;s. He is short on supplies and always on the lookout for &lt;a href=\"Mercenary\"&gt;mercenaries&lt;/a&gt;. Its population is 1,500.\nThe people of Redridge, mainly of Lakeshire, are an easy-going folk. Although the modest town bustles with travelers and &lt;a href=\"merchant\"&gt;merchant&lt;/a&gt;s, they seem content to watch the world pass them by, and spend the day fishing or sitting in their stores, discussing the politics of Stormwind and laughing that if the people up there would just relax, their problems would solve themselves. They wear a mixture of fashions, a layered look of tunics and undershirts for the chilly evenings and the warm days. Some &lt;a href=\"tailor\"&gt;tailor&lt;/a&gt;s have found a sap that waterproofs clothing and sell these clothes at ridiculous prices to visiting fishers.\nTwice a year, at midsummer and midwinter, Lakeshire holds the &lt;a href=\"Festival%20of%20the%20Lake\"&gt;Festival of the Lake&lt;/a&gt;. In the summer, people fish and swim, while in the winter they ice fish and skate. And, like all good festivals, you can get a fine serving of ale during these times. In the winter, they serve their &lt;a href=\"wine\"&gt;wine&lt;/a&gt; hot, which the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Half-elf\"&gt;half-elves&lt;/a&gt; seem to like.\nA &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; merchant recently moved into the town looking for a place to set up shop as well as a seasoned party to get her some special items. She has a list she needs filled, including items found in several places in the mountains, even from the canyons beyond &lt;a href=\"Stonewatch%20Falls\"&gt;Stonewatch Falls&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock&lt;/a&gt; orcs who took control over &lt;a href=\"Stonewatch%20Keep\"&gt;Stonewatch Keep&lt;/a&gt; haven't disrupted the local area too much yet, but they have made a few low-key assaults on the Lakeshire humans. If they grow much bolder, they'll attract some unwelcome attention from Stormwind.\nFilm universe.\nLakeshire is shown falling to the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20%28film%20universe%29\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpeculation.\nWhile it is not named as such, the human town of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Red%20Ridge%20Mountains%20%28WC1%20Orc%29\"&gt;The Red Ridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt; \"\" orc mission may be Lakeshire considering the big river at the center of the map could be &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Everstill\"&gt;Lake Everstill&lt;/a&gt;."}

It was a lament to fallen &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; and a tribute to those whose bravery remained steadfast against overwhelming odds. While the melody hasn't changed, the words of the song were altered about 2,800 years ago to reflect the losses the night elves' &lt;a href=\"high%20elf\"&gt;high elven&lt;/a&gt; descendants suffered during the &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Wars\"&gt;Troll Wars&lt;/a&gt;. Finally, during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the song was used again to illustrate the elves' grief during the &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20invasion%20of%20Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Scourge invasion of Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, who died defending &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; and thus failed to protect her people, still grieves at this failure, &lt;a href=\"flavor%20lore\"&gt;if her claims are to be believed&lt;/a&gt;.\nMedia.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;\nOfficial machinima.\nThis video, published by Blizzard on September 19, 2007, shows the assault of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; and the assassination of Sylvanas and her afterdeath rising by &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; along with Sylvanas singing the song, which is the part players can watch as well for themselves while playing the game.\nAlthough not official, &lt;a href=\"Patty%20Mattson\"&gt;Patty Mattson&lt;/a&gt;, the voice actor for &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas&lt;/a&gt;, decided to make a new version of the Lament of the Highborne with Sylvanas's current state of mind at the time, due to requests and a Twitter petition posted by fans of \"Warcraft\".\nFan made by Erutan.\nA fan-made video of the song, Lament of the Highborne."}

Obris was witness to the breaking of Ner'zhul's nobility, when the old orc said that the rest of the Horde be damned, and that all that mattered was his own survival. Obris protested, but was mowed down by his master's magic and left for dead.\nObris survived the assault, and in a final act of vengeance, gave a despairing &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Medivh\"&gt;Book of Medivh&lt;/a&gt;, which Obris had been entrusted with.

They are originally native to the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;Great Dark Beyond&lt;/a&gt;. Looking through the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;, observers have the capability to see through forms of stealth and invisibility.\nBackground.\nBiology.\nA plated crest covers the observers' forehead and top of the head. Gills are present on both sides of their bodies; below them, ten tentacles hang down. There's also a sphincter on their backside that can be seen contracting when observers fight and dilating when they die. When Observers fall asleep or die, they will fall to the ground.\nAdult members of the species feature two rows of teeth and seven eyes. Their eyes can shoot magic beams, with different types of magic coming from different eyes. Young observers only have two big teeth and a single eye that can shoot magic. They are also far less aggressive than their adult counterparts.\nThere are also examples of floating eyes using poison-based attacks, like &lt;a href=\"Broggok\"&gt;Broggok&lt;/a&gt;.\nObjectives and affiliation.\nThe observers express a deep desire to bear witness to all forms of magic and are willingly offering their services in exchange for the opportunity to consume new forms of magic. \nSome observers have joined the &lt;a href=\"Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt;, but nothing suggests that the race is a member of it as a whole. Other individuals, including renegade &lt;a href=\"demons\"&gt;demons&lt;/a&gt; like &lt;a href=\"Culuthas\"&gt;Culuthas&lt;/a&gt;, have gained the allegiance of observers to their own ends. There are also examples of observers that pledged allegiance to no one but themselves, like &lt;a href=\"Xeleth\"&gt;Xeleth&lt;/a&gt; who was worshiped as a god by Zangarmarsh's native creatures.\nSome observers joined the &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt;, among which some have stayed around &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; despite and since &lt;a href=\"Illidan\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt;'s death.\nSummoning.\nThe ritual to summon an observer is complex. They are highly migratory and the summoning ritual must compensate for their travels. Without their willing assistance, summoning an observer would be nearly impossible. During her journey to &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, the undead warlock &lt;a href=\"Jubeka%20Shadowbreaker\"&gt;Jubeka Shadowbreaker&lt;/a&gt; learned from the observers the above-mentioned ritual and transcribed it to &lt;a href=\"Grimoire%20of%20Supremacy\"&gt;one of her grimoires&lt;/a&gt;. The tome was later sent to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and its information spread among the members of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20the%20Black%20Harvest\"&gt;Council of the Black Harvest&lt;/a&gt;.\nAn observer called &lt;a href=\"Xhu%27daggab\"&gt;Xhu'daggab&lt;/a&gt; was summoned by the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; forces under &lt;a href=\"Ga%27trul\"&gt;Ga'trul&lt;/a&gt; to watch the shores of the &lt;a href=\"Jade%20Forest\"&gt;Jade Forest&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocations.\nPowerful observers have been spotted in the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Furnace\"&gt;Blood Furnace&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Portal%20Clearing\"&gt;Portal Clearing&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href=\"Twinspire%20Keep\"&gt;Twinspire Keep&lt;/a&gt;. Large groups were present in &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Blade's Edge Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Valley\"&gt;Shadowmoon Valley&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Arcatraz\"&gt;Arcatraz&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Farahlon\"&gt;Ruins of Farahlon&lt;/a&gt; under the service of different factions.\nAs a warlock minion.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Mists%20of%20Pandaria\"&gt;Mists of Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"Observer%20%28warlock%20minion%29\"&gt;Observers&lt;/a&gt; became a new summonable &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"minion\"&gt;minion&lt;/a&gt;, available through the &lt;a href=\"Grimoire%20of%20Supremacy\"&gt;Grimoire of Supremacy&lt;/a&gt; talent, replacing the &lt;a href=\"Felhunter\"&gt;Felhunter&lt;/a&gt; minion.\nIn the TCG.\nThey are also known as floating eyes."}

Having been originally placed on &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, the clutch was abandoned after the mad aspect's plans went awry and the planet later exploded. Having bent Blade's Edge to their will, the Obsidian Brood returned to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; upon the re-awakening of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;. They supported the &lt;a href=\"Sabellian%20%28faction%29\"&gt;endeavors of their leader&lt;/a&gt; to become the next &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Aspect&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;. With Sabellian's withdrawal from Aspect, however, they still serve him as their general under his brother and new Aspect, &lt;a href=\"Ebyssian\"&gt;Ebyssian&lt;/a&gt;.\nBy unknown means, they have been purged of their Old God corruption, and have also ensured the return of their flight to the world by caretaking a plethora of eggs and whelps.\nHistory.\nBeyond the Dark Portal.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;'s alliance with &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Horde%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, Deathwing intended on storing away eggs on Draenor where they could safely be raised without the risk of being attacked by the black flight's enemies on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce on Draenor, the black dragons settled into &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Gorgrond&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Frostfire Ridge&lt;/a&gt;. They were not there long before they were attacked by &lt;a href=\"Gruul%20the%20Dragonkiller\"&gt;Gruul&lt;/a&gt;, his offspring, and a small group of &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Expedition\"&gt;Alliance Expedition&lt;/a&gt; fighters. Many eggs were destroyed and Deathwing was forced to flee from battle. Deathwing abandoned the planet, though Sabellian and his brood remained.\nAs the planet was destroyed by Ner'zhul's wanton opening of Dark Portals, many of the dragons were killed in the resulting explosion of Draenor. Many of the eggs that survived were mutated, turning into &lt;a href=\"nether%20dragon\"&gt;nether dragon&lt;/a&gt; eggs; though Sabellian and his clutch survived. They remained in the blasted ruins of Gorgrond and Frostfire Ridge, what had now become the &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Blade's Edge Mountains&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nWhile Deathwing managed to return to Azeroth, Sabellian remained behind on Draenor \u2014 now &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 after the destruction of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;. Deathwing entrusted him with safeguarding the black dragons and eggs there. Sabellian became a fierce enemy of &lt;a href=\"Gruul%20the%20Dragonkiller\"&gt;Gruul the Dragonkiller&lt;/a&gt; and his seven sons, and hated them deeply for killing his own people and children.\nMembers of the brood, such as the human &lt;a href=\"Samia%20Inkling\"&gt;Samia Inkling&lt;/a&gt; and the whelp &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Sablemane%27s%20Blackwhelp\"&gt;Baron Sablemane's Blackwhelp&lt;/a&gt; were seen; though the actual brood itself was not during this time. They assisted the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Wyrmcult\"&gt;Wyrmcult&lt;/a&gt;; though this appeared to mainly be in order to secure the whelps the Wyrmcult has been keeping. Sabellian, under the guise of Baron Sablemane, assisted the adventurers in killing two of Gruul's sons: &lt;a href=\"Gorgrom%20the%20Dragon-Eater\"&gt;Gorgrom the Dragon-Eater&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Goc\"&gt;Goc&lt;/a&gt;, reverting to his true &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt; form and personally fighting the latter.\nAt some point, Sabellian found a way to cleanse the dragons on Outland of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s' corruption. According to &lt;a href=\"Osoria\"&gt;Osoria&lt;/a&gt;, in the years since Gruul's defeat Sabellian has bent the Blade's Edge Mountains to his will.\nDragonflight.\nThe Obsidian Brood made its first appearance as a proper force during the events of the &lt;a href=\"Waking%20Shores\"&gt;Waking Shores&lt;/a&gt;. Led by &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt;, one of the last Azerothian black dragons, the &lt;a href=\"Blacktalon\"&gt;Blacktalon&lt;/a&gt; led an assault upon the &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Citadel\"&gt;Obsidian Citadel&lt;/a&gt;. Arriving just as the battle began, the brood helped to recover the upper courtyard of the &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Citadel\"&gt;Obsidian Citadel&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Oathstone\"&gt;Obsidian Oathstone&lt;/a&gt;. In the aftermath, the two heirs of Neltharion began to compete for who would become the next aspect; supported by their respective factions.\nAs Sabellian went to deliver the black dragon eggs from Outland to the Ruby Pools, Wrathion insisted on accompanying him. As the pair traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Lifeshrine\"&gt;Ruby Lifeshrine&lt;/a&gt; via cart, Sabellian insisted they remain incognito, even when Wrathion pointed out that it was obvious that ruse had failed. After various attacks were fended off, the pair were attacked by &lt;a href=\"Thaladrax\"&gt;Thaladrax&lt;/a&gt;, who destroyed the cart and the eggs within. An outraged Wrathion viewed this as a sign that the others would see reason and pick their new leader and rushed off to inform Alexstrasza. When the Dragon Queen demanded answers, Sabellian revealed that he had used himself and Wrathion as bait to attract their enemies' attention, while his clutch of black dragons safely traveled by air to deliver the eggs. He then pledged his loyalty and that of his flight as &lt;a href=\"Neltharion\"&gt;Neltharion&lt;/a&gt;'s heir to her. However, Alexstrasza was unmoved, recalling how Sabellian had played a part in &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;'s twisted legacy, to which he had defended as being a matter of duty. Though she took the eggs under her care, she remarked that she would not get involved in their bickering and the matter of Aspectship between them was a matter for the &lt;a href=\"Black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black&lt;/a&gt;, not the &lt;a href=\"Red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red&lt;/a&gt;, to decide.\nThe two returned to the Obsidian Citadel to resume their competition for who would become the new aspect. Members of the Obsidian Brood can also be found throughout &lt;a href=\"Valdrakken\"&gt;Valdrakken&lt;/a&gt;, visiting the city, and the dragon &lt;a href=\"Mythexthia\"&gt;Mythexthia&lt;/a&gt; has also joined the staff of &lt;a href=\"Algeth%27ar%20Academy\"&gt;Algeth'ar Academy&lt;/a&gt; as a teacher for the black dragonflight."}

Having awoken from their ancient slumber with the return of the dragons, the djaradin laid siege to the Obsidian Citadel only to find it empty; taking it and the internal fortress of &lt;a href=\"Neltharus\"&gt;Neltharus&lt;/a&gt;. The citadel was laid siege to by &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Blacktalon\"&gt;Blacktalon&lt;/a&gt; forces; despite the &lt;a href=\"Red%20dragonflight\"&gt;Red dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; advising against such an assault. Fortunately, the assault was spared massive casualties by the unexpected arrival of &lt;a href=\"Sabellian\"&gt;Sabellian&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Brood\"&gt;Obsidian Brood&lt;/a&gt;; who reinforced Wrathion's assault. The two forces claimed the &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Throne\"&gt;Obsidian Throne&lt;/a&gt;, the apex of the citadel and the literal throne of the leader of the flight. Here, Sabellian and Wrathion began to debate who was the one who should become the new ruler of the Black dragonflight, and as a result, aspect.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Waking%20Shores\"&gt;Waking Shores&lt;/a&gt; questline, the Obsidian Citadel becomes a weekly quest repository and grinding location for the &lt;a href=\"Sabellian%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Sabellian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wrathion%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt; factions. Upon choosing which heir of &lt;a href=\"Neltharion\"&gt;Neltharion&lt;/a&gt; they want to support, new quests and rewards will open to them for that week.\nHere, players can kill many of the Qalashi djaradin to recover &lt;a href=\"Key%20Fragments\"&gt;Key Fragments&lt;/a&gt; and to create (once a week for &lt;a href=\"Allegiance%20to%20One\"&gt;Allegiance to One&lt;/a&gt;) and (repeatedly after the first) to return to the dragons of their choice, including several other factions such as the smiths under &lt;a href=\"Forgemaster%20Bazentus\"&gt;Forgemaster Bazentus&lt;/a&gt;, or even the misguided &lt;a href=\"Worldbreakers\"&gt;Worldbreakers&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Slagmire\"&gt;Slagmire&lt;/a&gt;. Returning a certain amount of keys will summon a new rare spawn or event for players in the area to complete for reputation with the would-be aspects, the &lt;a href=\"Valdrakken%20Accord\"&gt;Valdrakken Accord&lt;/a&gt;, and reward useful loot in the form of cosmetics, upgrades, gold and reputation tokens for other factions. The quests available weekly rotate, meaning that they are not always the same, and while players can only choose one dragon to implicitly support that week, they can still aid the other dragon by giving them keys or drops such as the &lt;a href=\"Mark%20of%20Sargha\"&gt;Mark of Sargha&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Sargha%27s%20Signet\"&gt;Sargha's Signet&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is here that the &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Oathstone\"&gt;Obsidian Oathstone&lt;/a&gt; can also be found."}

Although he's still as powerful as the tauren high chieftain from the present, within this shattered future Azeroth, this guilt-ridden echo is little more than a discordant vessel of unquenchable malice and anger. The remaining black dragonflight still wanders their sacred ground, trying to prevent any intruders from entering.\nThe mobs are in packs of three, with one each per group. Some groups path, while some are stationary. It is suggested groups take out the Seers first.\nThe Deaths of Chromie.\nAt an undisclosed point in the future, the Obsidian Dragonshrine comes under attack by &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;-controlled undead, much to the dismay of &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Zorathides\"&gt;Zorathides&lt;/a&gt; plots the death of &lt;a href=\"Chronormu\"&gt;Chronormu&lt;/a&gt;."}

Viper Sting is simply not needed.\nAn &lt;a href=\"Obsidian\"&gt;Obsidian&lt;/a&gt; Chunk will fall to the ground near the slain Obsidian Eradicator.\nStrategy.\nA highly recommended strategy is to have 3-5 &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s using &lt;a href=\"Drain%20Mana\"&gt;Drain Mana&lt;/a&gt;, and 3-5 &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s using &lt;a href=\"Mana%20Burn\"&gt;Mana Burn&lt;/a&gt; while one or more &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s heals the main tank. This enemy does not hit hard, and the main tank doesn't require much healing. Everyone else in the raid who is not healing or draining mana should be doing DPS.\nThe mana burn targets a mana user randomly and then burns mana from ALL mana users in a small radius around that person. Thus it is important to spread out your mana users, especially if you have limited mana draining capacity.\nRespawn.\nObsidian Eradicators will respawn 30 minutes after they are killed."}

Occurring around 18 years before the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, the Gurubashi War saw a massive army of trolls lay siege to, and nearly sack, &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; itself in response to the assassination of their previous warlord.\nThe war was preceded by a long period of smaller conflicts between the two factions, largely over the territories bordering &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt; that Stormwindian settlers began expanding into. Though initially isolated, the conflict quickly escalated out of control, despite the best efforts of Stormwind's &lt;a href=\"Barathen%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Barathen Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe final provocation came when &lt;a href=\"Llane%20Wrynn\"&gt;Prince Llane Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; personally led a small party to strike at the Gurubashi leadership in central Stranglethorn, which succeeded in uniting the trolls against Stormwind. Though costly and close-run, the human kingdom eventually emerged victorious, largely due to the intervention of the &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith the entire troll army completely destroyed or routed at the gates of Stormwind City, the &lt;a href=\"jungle%20troll\"&gt;jungle troll&lt;/a&gt;s of the south would never succeed in threatening the kingdom again. The war's conclusion also marked the beginning of nearly two decades of relative peace for Stormwind, to be eventually interrupted by the onset of the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Orcish Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nPrelude.\nYears after the &lt;a href=\"Gnoll%20War\"&gt;Gnoll War&lt;/a&gt;, from which the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s emerged victorious, the isolated &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; continued to prosper in the southeastern areas of the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;. Now living in relative peace, Stormwind's settlers and farmers began to expand the kingdom's borders, pushing farther in all directions. In particular, vast new territories were claimed south of the human nation, located perilously close to the jungles of &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 the ancient homeland of the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20tribe\"&gt;Gurubashi tribe&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"jungle%20troll\"&gt;jungle troll&lt;/a&gt;s.\nInevitably, skirmishes eventually began to break out between the expansionist humans and territorial trolls, though they remained for a time largely localized and small-scale. Stormwind's aging ruler, &lt;a href=\"Barathen%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Barathen Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, adopted a non-aggressive stance to these instances of violence, hoping to prevent provoking an all-out war between the two races. In time, what were once small clashes erupted into much larger disturbances. Organized troll warbands frequently began raiding Stormwindian lands and an ever-increasing amount of blood was spilled in the conflict.\nIn response, King Barathen continued his policy of static defense, ordering his troops to intercept and engage any invaders but forbidding them from launching retaliatory attacks into troll lands. This decision proved bitterly controversial within the kingdom, where the king's own son &lt;a href=\"Llane%20Wrynn\"&gt;Prince Llane&lt;/a&gt; strongly advocated for a more aggressive approach. His determination that Stormwind should strike back against the trolls ultimately led him into harsh conflict with his father.\nWhile King Barathen's efforts against the Gurubashi were effective, his armies could not stop every troll attack. At one point, a raiding party was successful in slipping past Stormwind's patrol lines, penetrating deep into the kingdom's breadbasket of &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt;. There they cut a swathe of destruction through the region, razing three separate towns to the ground. Ultimately, the invaders were caught up with and slain, but the barbaric and gruesome destruction they had managed to wreak shocked the kingdom. In response, the king held meetings with the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Nobles\"&gt;nobility&lt;/a&gt; and his allies, although he remained adamant in his adherence to a policy of de-escalation. King Barathen declared that, while Stormwind's armies would be strengthened and bolstered, no offensive action would be taken against the Gurubashi trolls.\nPrince Llane became furious at his father's decision and publicly challenged him in front of onlookers, demanding that he take firm action in response to all the blood that was spilled. Though the king was forced to rebuke his son in front of the court, the humiliation only served to galvanize the prince. Many other Stormwindians shared Llane's views on the issue, including the &lt;a href=\"knight\"&gt;knight&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt; and the majority of the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Army\"&gt;Stormwind Army&lt;/a&gt;. Nevertheless, the prince understood that he could not defy his father openly. It was thus on the suggestion of Lothar that Llane began to formulate a plan to infiltrate deep into the heart of Gurubashi lands, and end the troll threat once and for all.\nA Secret Mission.\nAt about this time, a powerful figure in the form of the &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt; reentered life in the kingdom. Having been lying in a magically-induced coma for years (following the emergence of his full and terrible powers) Medivh was now determined to aid his friends, &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Sir Lothar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Llane%20Wrynn\"&gt;Prince Llane&lt;/a&gt;, in order to escape his many newfound internal troubles. Llane understood that while his planned covert mission into &lt;a href=\"jungle%20troll\"&gt;jungle troll&lt;/a&gt; territory would be small enough to evade the vast majority of both trolls and humans, the expedition needed Medivh.\nMedivh had long since told his two friends the secret of his true destiny as the &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardian of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt;, which they now used to argue for the &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; to join their mission. Medivh, still deeply troubled and confused over the recent events of his life, considered the situation at great length before hesitantly agreeing. Alone, the three set off on their journey.\nMaking it through Stormwind's borders unnoticed, the small party utilized Medivh's magic to remain hidden as they pressed into &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20tribe\"&gt;Gurubashi&lt;/a&gt; lands. Their objective became the trolls' leader, named &lt;a href=\"Jok%27non\"&gt;Jok'non&lt;/a&gt;, who ruled from a large ziggurat in central Stranglethorn. If their leader were slain, Llane and his party were confident that the Gurubashi would descend into chaos and infighting. Unbeknownst to the humans, however, Jok'non and his followers had been dabbling in the forbidden &lt;a href=\"blood%20magic\"&gt;blood magic&lt;/a&gt;s of one of their most powerful gods, the &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt; spirit known as &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20the%20Soulflayer\"&gt;Hakkar the Soulflayer&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen Llane and his companions finally engaged the troll leader, the ensuing battle proved brutal. Large attention was drawn to the fight atop the ziggurat as Medivh personally dueled Jok'non. The troll's dark blood magics came perilously close to overwhelming Medivh, who was forced to unleash the full might of his &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt; powers. The resulting spell instantly slew every troll in the area, their screams echoing throughout Stranglethorn.\nShaken by their friend's display of raw power, Llane and Lothar (with Medivh in tow) immediately set off back to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;. Though they had successfully achieved their expedition's goal, both men were shaken by the display they had witnessed and began to harbor doubts as to the well-being of their long-time companion.\nGurubashi Vengeance.\nAlthough no Gurubashi &lt;a href=\"jungle%20troll\"&gt;jungle troll&lt;/a&gt; survived the encounter in central Stranglethorn to testify as to the events that occurred there, the other trolls quickly pieced together who was responsible. Furious at this brazen attack, the Gurubashi forces united under the leadership of the late &lt;a href=\"Jok%27non\"&gt;Warlord Jok'non&lt;/a&gt;'s son, &lt;a href=\"Zan%27non\"&gt;Zan'non&lt;/a&gt;. The trolls then immediately prepared for all-out war on the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s, and began to mobilize and march in the direction of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;.\nThough Stormwind had been fighting with the Gurubashi for some time, they had not yet faced the trolls fully united as they were now. Used to dealing with relatively minor raiding parties, Stormwind's southern defenses instantly crumbled under the tide of foes. The trolls' numbers proved well beyond anything the kingdom could have foreseen or imagined. Large numbers of civilians unable to escape the Gurubashi advance were slaughtered in grotesque and shocking ways upon being overtaken. Having achieved a common purpose for the first time in hundreds of years, the Gurubashi &lt;a href=\"jungle%20troll\"&gt;jungle troll&lt;/a&gt;s wasted little time on anything other than their primary objective: the utter destruction of the humans' capital city of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;. To this end, pushed directly toward the city itself, encountering nothing that could effectively halt their invasion.\n&lt;a href=\"Barathen%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Barathen&lt;/a&gt; understood the gravity of the situation, though most of the kingdom continued to reel. The king recalled all major forces to the gates of Stormwind City itself, to face the attackers in a pitched battle if necessary. At this time, &lt;a href=\"Llane%20Wrynn\"&gt;Prince Llane&lt;/a&gt; and his two friends informed the king of what had transpired in Stranglethorn; though upset, King Barathen did not see fit to punish the three men given the already dire circumstances. Before long, the Gurubashi army arrived outside Stormwind's walls in terrifying numbers.\nZan'non had since learned of many of the dark magics of his father, and used these powers to create powerful new &lt;a href=\"Dire%20troll\"&gt;mutated soldiers&lt;/a&gt;. These beasts scaled the city's walls with ease, using their unholy strength to rip apart fortification and defender alike. As the trolls continued to clash with the soldiers of Stormwind, the death toll began to rise rapidly. Realizing that the current situation was unwinnable, King Barathen chose to mount a desperate attack with his own &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Royal%20Guard\"&gt;elite guards&lt;/a&gt; directly into the heart of enemy lines. Bravely seeking to slay Zan'non himself, Stormwind's king was still desperately outnumbered. Barathen Wrynn came close to his goal but was ultimately killed on the field of battle.\nLlane Wrynn, now king, was overcome with guilt at his father's death, lamenting his actions that began the conflict originally. Despite his grief, the former prince refused to give into despair. Though Stormwind's defenses were on the verge of collapse, Llane would not give up on those that now looked to him for leadership. He pleaded with &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt; to once more unleash the full might of his powers to turn the tide of battle, to which the &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; ultimately agreed. From atop the battlements of Stormwind, Medivh the &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt; once more harnessed the full might of his abilities. With unmatched , , and &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; magics, the mage laid waste to the troll forces. Innumerable Gurubashi were frozen, incinerated, or simply ripped apart by the unbridled powers at work. The trolls' deaths were particularly torturous, a fully intended action on Medivh's part.\nWhen Medivh had finally finished, Stormwind City and its defenders still stood unscathed, though the same could not be said for the Gurubashi. Almost the entire troll army had been annihilated in the maelstrom of raw power (including Warlord Zan'non) with only a small handful fleeing alive.\nAftermath.\nIn the wake of the destruction, the citizens of Stormwind began to bury the dead and repair the damage to their city. They rejoiced for their salvation at the hands of Medivh, who was now regarded as one of the kingdom's greatest protectors, and happily accepted &lt;a href=\"Llane%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Llane&lt;/a&gt; as their new ruler. &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt;, too, benefited from the recent events, being raised to one of the highest commands in the military.\nThe general populace never became aware of the secret expedition into the heart of Stranglethorn that sparked the war, or the direct involvement of their new king. However, the consequences of their actions weighed heavily upon Llane, Lothar, and Medivh, having led to the deaths of hundreds.\nHis unrestricted use of his full and terrible powers deeply troubled Medivh, who now doubted whether he possessed the will required to temper such abilities. The events of the Gurubashi War were what ultimately convinced the &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt; to seek out answers to the many questions that had been plaguing his mind. Shortly afterward, he traveled to the ancient tower of &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt; at the behest of &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;a mysterious woman&lt;/a&gt; in his dreams. There, Medivh would ultimately uncover his destiny and his Guardian birthright, which would alter the course of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s history forever.\nSome time later, the &lt;a href=\"demon%20lord\"&gt;demon lord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; (residing within Medivh) would utilize the example set by the Gurubashi War to convince the Guardian of Azeroth's pettiness. The flimsy and arbitrary reasons for the war between &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"jungle%20troll\"&gt;jungle troll&lt;/a&gt;s was placed in stark contrast to the powerful unity of the races of Azeroth during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, millennia before.\nSpeculation.\nBlackwater Cove, the town that would later be known as &lt;a href=\"Booty%20Bay\"&gt;Booty Bay&lt;/a&gt;, was presumably one of Stormwind's new settlements that sparked the Gurubashi War since it has been said that the trolls ran the humans who lived there out."}

The conflict was the result of the increasingly costly sacrificial demands of Hakkar the Soulflayer, whom the Gurubashi worshipped. In return for vast conquests, the Soulflayer demanded increasingly larger amounts of blood sacrifices, ultimately culminating in his attempted summoning by his Atal'ai zealots. While initially unconcerned, the Zandalari trolls soon came to the conclusion that Hakkar would drive the Gurubashi Empire to ruin.\nTo combat this, a large force was sent to &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt; where it joined with Gurubashi forces who resented the loa's insatiable demands and the strict theocracy established by his priests. Upon learning that the Atal'ai intended to summon Hakkar into the physical world itself, they forcefully stormed the Gurubashi capital of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Gurub\"&gt;Zul'Gurub&lt;/a&gt;. For days, the two sides battled among the vine-covered ziggurats of the city, until eventually the Zandalari-led forces began to gain the upper hand. Ultimately, they succeeded in preventing Hakkar's summoning and slew the majority of his crazed followers. Following their defeat, many of the Atal'ai and even the Hakkari who had fought against them were either killed or forced to flee the region. They subsequently settled in the nearby &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20of%20Sorrows\"&gt;Swamp of Sorrows&lt;/a&gt;, where they began construction of the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Atal%27Hakkar\"&gt;Temple of Atal'Hakkar&lt;/a&gt;, still intending to summon the Soulflayer. Before this could occur, however, it was destroyed by the &lt;a href=\"aspect\"&gt;aspect&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt;, of the &lt;a href=\"Green%20dragonflight\"&gt;Green dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nA savage god.\nFollowing the cataclysmic events of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20Empire\"&gt;Gurubashi Empire&lt;/a&gt; found itself languishing in the southern reaches of a new continent, the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;. Cut off from old hunting farming lands, famine and poverty became rampant throughout the &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s' lands. Although having made small recoveries since then, the Gurubashi Empire was still a shadow of its former self.\nTraditionally revered by almost all troll peoples, the ancient &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt; spirits came to be seen as a means of salvation for the destitute nation. While the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20Empire\"&gt;Amani Empire&lt;/a&gt;, in similar straits, to the north honored a wide pantheon of these beings, the Gurubashi ultimately turned to revering one. Answering their call for deliverance, &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20the%20Soulflayer\"&gt;Hakkar&lt;/a&gt;, the Loa of Blood, promised to help the Gurubashi extend their empire and once more achieve prosperity. He would aid them in conquering the entire lower half of the continent, in return for large numbers of blood sacrifices. The vast majority of Gurubashi seized on this opportunity, and those who personally devoted themselves to the Soulflayer became known as the &lt;a href=\"Hakkari\"&gt;Hakkari&lt;/a&gt;. With Hakkar's assistance, they soundly defeated nearby packs of &lt;a href=\"gnolls\"&gt;gnolls&lt;/a&gt; and tribes of &lt;a href=\"murlocs\"&gt;murlocs&lt;/a&gt;, as well as other trolls who stood in the way of Hakkar and the Gurubashi. Those taken prisoner were used as part of the vast offerings demanded by Hakkar; the loa would gorge on the blood of the captives for years.\nUnder the loa's guidance and control, the Gurubashi had succeeded in achieving all that they desired, conquering vast swaths of lands as well as many of the islands that dotted the coasts of the &lt;a href=\"South%20Seas\"&gt;South Seas&lt;/a&gt;. From &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;their island in the ocean&lt;/a&gt;, and in their self-appointed role as protectors and leaders of the troll race, the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; watched these events unfold with great interest. Initially, they were very pleased with the actions of their &lt;a href=\"jungle%20troll\"&gt;jungle troll&lt;/a&gt; brethren, who had apparently returned to the ways of conquering and traditional worship.\nSoon, however, the Zandalari's joy turned to disquiet. They consulted myths and delved into ancient historical accounts. What the Zandalari would discover shook them to their core. This loa, Hakkar, also known as the 'Soulflayer' (a name he richly deserved), filled his adherents with a murderous rage and reveled in their darkest emotions. The carnage, chaos, and destruction that invariably followed suited the Blood God perfectly - he had developed a taste for it. His bloodlust could \"never\" be sated and, worse, he would only become more powerful as he consumed more bloodshed in his name, as his tie to the world that was feeding him grew stronger.\nRecognizing the deadly threat that Hakkar posed to not just the Gurubashi, but also the entire world, the Zandalari rallied a large force and immediately set sail for Stranglethorn to warn the jungle trolls and put a stop to the Hakkari.\nCivil War.\nHaving set sail for the southern Eastern Kingdoms, the Zandalari arrived in Gurubashi territory, ready to fight the Hakkari. Meanwhile, Hakkar's demands continued to escalate, and he began to grow impatient with the Hakkari. He now demanded that they begin a ritual to summon him into the physical world itself, allowing him to directly feast on the blood of his victims. So vast was his hunger that he dreamed of eventually devouring the lives of all &lt;a href=\"mortal\"&gt;mortal&lt;/a&gt; creatures on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. By now, most of the Hakkari had begun to guess at the Soulflayer's insatiable appetite and were shocked at the prospect of the power he might gain and the damage he might wreak if given the ability to feed unchecked. By the time the Zandalari had arrived, the Gurubashi Empire was already in a state of civil unrest due to the increasing demands of Hakkar.\nThe Zandalari soon met up with the many Gurubashi trolls who, despite their empire's recent success, also saw the mortal danger that was Hakkar's influence, but who had kept their dissent well-hidden from the Hakkari. However, it was not long before the Hakkari themselves joined the coup, informing the others that an extremely radical and zealous group of the Hakkari, known as the &lt;a href=\"Atal%27ai\"&gt;Atal'ai&lt;/a&gt;, were attempting to summon the Blood God himself into the physical world, regardless of the obvious consequences.&lt;ref name=\"Troll Compendium/Jungle Troll Tribes#The Hakkari\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"Troll%20Compendium/Jungle%20Troll%20Tribes%23The%20Hakkari\"&gt;Troll Compendium/Jungle Troll Tribes#The Hakkari&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nHorrified by the Atal'ai's plans, the Zandalari and their combined force, including the Hakkari, stormed the Gurubashi capital of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Gurub\"&gt;Zul'Gurub&lt;/a&gt;, where the summoning was taking place. They immediately engaged the Atal'ai, who fought with terrifying zeal. Battles raged across the vine-strewn capital and among the mighty ziggurats. Many fell as the fight for the temple city raged on, but the Zandalari and their allies eventually began to gain the upper hand. Finally, atop Hakkar's bloodstained shrine, they succeeded in defeating Hakkar's avatar and most of his crazed followers. Although greatly relieved by their victory, the Zandalari-led forces agreed to remain vigilant for any sign of Hakkar's reappearance. They knew that the loa was not truly dead\u2014his spirit had merely been banished from the physical world.\nExodus of the Hakkari and the Temple of Atal'Hakkar.\nAlthough the majority of the Atal'ai were killed during the civil war, and in particular during their defeat in Zul'Gurub, some still managed to escape into the surrounding jungles. In response to this, the Zandalari victors ruthlessly hunted them throughout the region, killing many more. Yet, a small group succeeded in making good their escape, fleeing to the forlorn &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20of%20Sorrows\"&gt;Swamp of Sorrows&lt;/a&gt;. Unshaken in their devotion to Hakkar, they began the construction of a new temple to their god, the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Atal%27Hakkar\"&gt;Temple of Atal'Hakkar&lt;/a&gt;, where they fully intended to resume the summoning which had been interrupted with the fall of the temple city.\nMeanwhile, having helped fight the fanatical Atal'ai, the Hakkari hoped that their role in carrying out sacrifices for Hakkar would be forgotten. They soon discovered otherwise. Once the more immediate threat of the Atal'ai had been eliminated, the victorious trolls turned on the Hakkari as well, seeking vengeance for the many evil deeds they committed in the Soulflayer's name. The Hakkari subsequently found themselves persecuted almost as ruthlessly as the Atal'ai, despite the fact that they had fought against the fanatics in the war. Many former priests were tortured and executed in grisly public spectacles. Others were torn apart in mob violence. The luckiest of the Hakkari were simply stripped of all their possessions and forcibly ejected from Zul'Gurub. They were warned not to return on pain of death.\nBitter and desperate, the surviving Hakkari came to a terrible decision. They tracked those they had betrayed to the Swamp of Sorrows and pledged to aid the Atal'ai in attempting to summon Hakkar to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; once more. Pleased by the Hakkari's suffering and convinced of their change of heart, the Atal'ai welcomed their former brethren into the temple. Even so, Hakkar had not forgotten that the Hakkari had betrayed him in opposing his first entry into Azeroth, and so the hungry god would always regard the faithful Atal'ai with greater favor. Both groups now bent all their efforts toward bringing about Hakkar's entry into the physical world.\nThe &lt;a href=\"aspect\"&gt;aspect&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Green%20Dragonflight\"&gt;Green Dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; and mistress of the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt; the Dreamer, soon learned of the trolls' machinations in the region. Disgusted, she released her full wrath on the temple, blasting its foundations apart and causing it to sink beneath the swamp. To this day, the temple's ruins are guarded by mighty &lt;a href=\"green%20dragons\"&gt;green dragons&lt;/a&gt;. What much of Azeroth does not know, however, is that the dragons are actually guarding the wrong location. In recent years, the exiled Atal'ai have discovered that Hakkar's physical form can only be summoned within the ancient capital of the Gurubashi Empire, Zul'Gurub.\nLegacy.\nFollowing the war, the remnants of the Gurubashi Empire split into various tribes and factions, such as the &lt;a href=\"Bloodscalp\"&gt;Bloodscalp&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Skullsplitter%20tribe\"&gt;Skullsplitter&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20tribe\"&gt;Gurubashi&lt;/a&gt;. These groups ultimately went their separate ways, claiming their own territories in the vast jungles of Stranglethorn Vale. These scattered tribes soon began fighting with one another, and at length the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear tribe&lt;/a&gt;, which was smaller than most, was driven off the continent altogether and took to the seas. Hoping to avoid further conflict, they settled on a series of &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Islands\"&gt;remote desert island&lt;/a&gt;s. This exodus eventually proved to be a blessing, however, when they joined and achieved prosperity in the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Another tribe known to go into exile was the &lt;a href=\"Shatterspear%20tribe\"&gt;Shatterspear tribe&lt;/a&gt;, which settled in far away &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;.\nA fragile and relative peace eventually settled over the broken empire. Nevertheless, trolls continued to speak of a prophecy that Hakkar would one day be reborn into the world; and on that day, would consume it whole.\nSpeculation.\n&lt;a href=\"Var%27gazul\"&gt;Var'gazul&lt;/a&gt; may have been a leader of the Gurubashi in the conflict."}

They reside in their capital of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Gurub\"&gt;Zul'Gurub&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe Gurubashi civil war.\nEstablished long before the Great Sundering, the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20Empire\"&gt;Gurubashi Empire&lt;/a&gt; took its name from the strongest tribe of jungle trolls at the time. The jungle trolls ruled the southern jungles of ancient Kalimdor until the Burning Legion's first invasion, which wrought havoc and devastation throughout the continent and culminated in the Great Sundering.\nThe long centuries following the Sundering were difficult ones for the troll race. 1,500 years before the opening of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, the jungle trolls, driven to desperate ends, enlisted the aid of the god &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20the%20Soulflayer\"&gt;Hakkar the Soulflayer&lt;/a&gt;. Hakkar brought the trolls great power, but in return, the bloodthirsty god required that souls be sacrificed to him.\nHis demands quickly escalated, and he grew impatient with his loyal priests, the &lt;a href=\"Hakkari\"&gt;Hakkari&lt;/a&gt;. He told them to find a way to summon him physically into the world, so that he might directly drain the blood of his victims. Most of the Hakkari were horrified at the idea, but the &lt;a href=\"Atal%27ai\"&gt;Atal'ai&lt;/a&gt;, a small extremist faction of the Hakkari, decided to do as Hakkar wished.\nBefore the Atal'ai could complete the summoning, the other jungle trolls, including the Hakkari, rose up in open revolt against the cruel god. Even the &lt;a href=\"Zandalar%20tribe\"&gt;Zandalar tribe&lt;/a&gt; was drawn into the conflict, which finally ended with the destruction of Hakkar\u2019s avatar. Driven from the jungles, the Atal'ai were hunted nearly to extinction. Yet a small group of Atal'ai escaped into the Swamp of Sorrows, where they secretly built a great temple to their god: the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Atal%27Hakkar\"&gt;Temple of Atal'Hakkar&lt;/a&gt;. The other jungle tribes, including the Gurubashi, then turn on the Hakkari and killed or exiled for them evil deeds they had done in Hakkar's name, even though they had fought the Atal'ai. The surviving Hakkari would join the remaining Atal'ai in their temple.\nThe Gurubashi War.\nYears after the &lt;a href=\"Gnoll%20War\"&gt;Gnoll War&lt;/a&gt;, Stormwind's farmers and settlers would increasingly push southward claiming territory close to the jungles of &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt;. Skirmishes would erupt between the Gurubashi and Stormwind forces but the elderly Barathen would refuse to order an invasion into Stranglethorn and was focused on fighting a defensive war, much to the outrage of his son &lt;a href=\"Llane%20Wrynn%20I\"&gt;Prince Llane&lt;/a&gt;. While King Barathen's strategy against the Gurubashi was effective it would be unable to stop every attack, one which saw slow, barbaric, and gruesome deaths delivered to the villagers of three towns in &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt;. This would ultimately prove to be the final straw of Prince Llane, &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;, who in defiance of his father's continued de-escalation, journeyed south to bring war to the Gurubashi. Though initially shielded by Medivh's magic the three friends would end up in the fight for their lives when they battled &lt;a href=\"Jok%27non\"&gt;Jok'non&lt;/a&gt;, a Gurubashi Warlord empowered by &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20the%20Soulflayer\"&gt;Hakkar the Soulflayer&lt;/a&gt;. Ultimately the three friends would prove victorious and return to Stormwind, shaken by Medivh's powers. \nWhile none of the Gurubashi who witnessed Jok'non's death survived, it took very little to the imagination for the trolls to see who was responsible. Rallying under Jok'non's son, &lt;a href=\"Zan%27non\"&gt;Zan'non&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20War\"&gt;Gurubashi launched an invasion&lt;/a&gt; intent on destroying Stormwind. In the face of the troll onslaught, Barathen recalled all his forces to the stronghold's gate, believing that the survival of Stormwind would depend on one colossal battle. As the death toll mounted on both sides Barathen mounted a desperate counterattack against the Gurubashi. Though almost succeeding in claiming Zan'non's head, Barathen would die on the field of battle. Llane, driven by guilt, would plead with Medivh to unleash his power on the Gurubashi as he has done against Jok'non. Though frightened of his power Medivh would accept Llane's request and destroy the Gurubashi forces (Zan'non included), an act that would ultimately avenge Barathen.\nHorde resistance.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Orcish%20Horde\"&gt;Orcish Horde&lt;/a&gt; invaded Azeroth most of their forces war against the humans of Stormwind. However Kilrogg led his &lt;a href=\"Bleeding%20Hollow%20clan\"&gt;Bleeding Hollow clan&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt;, which reminded the orcs of their ancestral home of &lt;a href=\"Tanaan\"&gt;Tanaan&lt;/a&gt;. Thus the Bleeding Hollow were determined to claim Stranglethorn for themselves, however, the Gurubashi refused to share their lands with outsiders and the two forces would clash in battle. Though the Gurubashi were weakened by the Gurubashi War their knowledge of the land allowed for them to launch a guerrilla campaign to drive the invading Bleeding Hollow out of the region. Kilrogg and his Bleeding Hollow would eventually be ordered to retreat by &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Warchief Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; after he learned of the conflict and concluded that too many orcs were dying for no apparent gain.\nThe Soulflayer's return.\nAfter Hakkar's avatar in Zul'Gurub was destroyed, things within Stranglethorn would settle down. However, over time the Gurubashi lost much of its power and prestige. At some point, the Gurubashi exiled &lt;a href=\"Zanzil%20the%20Outcast\"&gt;Zanzil&lt;/a&gt; from the tribe and actually spit and threw stones at him. Even though the Gurubashi never gave a definite reason for their actions, it was possible that Zanzil was making other Gurubashi his mind slaves. Following this, the Gurubashi would live their own lives in relative peace and not bother the other Jungle tribes in the region like the &lt;a href=\"Bloodscalp%20tribe\"&gt;Bloodscalp tribe&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Skullsplitter%20tribe\"&gt;Skullsplitter tribe&lt;/a&gt;, who wared with each other. They didn't even raise a fuss when the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear tribe&lt;/a&gt; returned and helped the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; create the &lt;a href=\"Grom%27gol%20Base%20Camp\"&gt;Grom'gol Base Camp&lt;/a&gt;. The Gurubashi's isolationist policy would end when word reached them that that the Atal'ai and Hakkari were able to successfully resurrect Hakkar the Soulflayer within Zul'Gurub. Eager to prove themselves and return to their former glory the Gurubashi returned to the capital and pledged their allegiance to the Soulflayer. \nThe Gurubashi tribe guarded Hakkar and his minions with reckless fervor, believing that the Gurubashi empire would be restored in return for their loyalty. They are so driven to reach such former glory that they don't seem to care that Hakkar has enthralled five high priests of the trolls' primal gods. When word of Hakkar's presence reached the Zandalar tribe in the &lt;a href=\"South%20Seas\"&gt;South Seas&lt;/a&gt;, they were horrified to discover the enslavement of their kindred, the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; high priests. King Rastakhan then sent emissaries from the island of Zandalar to the Eastern Kingdoms, where the trolls recruited champions from Azeroth's many races in the hopes that Hakkar would once again be defeated.\nThe Zandalari's call to arms was answered by the proud defends of Azeroth who ventured into the &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Gurub\"&gt;Zul'Gurub&lt;/a&gt; and killed many of Gurubashi and ultimately defeated Hakkar. Even the five high priests &lt;a href=\"High%20Priest%20Venoxis\"&gt;High Priest Venoxis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"High%20Priestess%20Jeklik\"&gt;High Priestess Jeklik&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"High%20Priestess%20Arlokk\"&gt;High Priestess Arlokk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"High%20Priest%20Thekal\"&gt;High Priest Thekal&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"High%20Priestess%20Mar%27li\"&gt;High Priestess Mar'li&lt;/a&gt; and the hydra &lt;a href=\"Gahz%27ranka\"&gt;Gahz'ranka&lt;/a&gt; were slain. While &lt;a href=\"Bloodlord%20Mandokir\"&gt;Bloodlord Mandokir&lt;/a&gt; survived the assault he would later be tortured to death by the Bloodscalp tribe. The surviving Gurubashi would be led by &lt;a href=\"Jin%27do\"&gt;Jin'do&lt;/a&gt; and remain in Zul'Gurub.\nCataclysm.\nThe tribe is apparently willing to work with the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Horde\"&gt;Dark Horde&lt;/a&gt;, as they were requested for a witch doctor to come and sacrifice one of the &lt;a href=\"Bravo%20Company\"&gt;Bravo Company&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Krakauer\"&gt;Krakauer&lt;/a&gt;, in a dark ritual. Their ritualist, &lt;a href=\"Ritualist%20Tarak\"&gt;Ritualist Tarak&lt;/a&gt;, was slain by an adventurer and two members of the Company, &lt;a href=\"Jorgensen\"&gt;Jorgensen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Messner\"&gt;Messner&lt;/a&gt;, before the ritual was complete.\nWhen the struck the land, the Gurubashi remained holed up in Zul'Gurub where Jin'do began implementing a plan to return Hakkar to the world. Jin'do's plan would see the Gurubashi membership increase thanks to the aid of adventurers and &lt;a href=\"Ohgan%27aka\"&gt;Ohgan'aka&lt;/a&gt; who helped bring Bloodlord Mandokir back to life, and Jin'do would recruit Zanzil back into the fold. Zanzil would then go on to attempt to resurrect High Priest Venoxis and High Priestess Jeklik, though only Venoxis would return to life as adventurers thwarted Jeklik's resurrection. Meanwhile, High Priestess Arlokk's sister &lt;a href=\"High%20Priestess%20Kilnara\"&gt;Kilnara&lt;/a&gt; has risen to the position of High Priestess and aids Jin'do in his plans.\nThe Gurubashi would later gain unexpected help from the &lt;a href=\"Zandalar%20tribe\"&gt;Zandalar tribe&lt;/a&gt; when the mysterious prophet only known as &lt;a href=\"Zul\"&gt;Zul&lt;/a&gt; issued a call for Azeroth's embattled troll populations to unite into a single empire. Accompanied by members of the Gurubashi Jin'do arrived at a meeting in &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt; where he, &lt;a href=\"Daakara\"&gt;Daakara&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; and the Darkspear, and an unknown &lt;a href=\"Ice%20troll\"&gt;Ice troll&lt;/a&gt; were told by Zul about &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Drak\"&gt;Zul'Drak&lt;/a&gt; being lost to the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; and how &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Farrak\"&gt;Zul'Farrak&lt;/a&gt; is now a wasteland. They are told that the Zandalari plan to reclaim the former glory of the troll race, will crush any who stand in their way and states that the Troll Empire will rise again. The Gurubashi represents cheer and accept the Zandalari's offer. Vol'jin who views the Horde as his true brothers sends members of his tribe to both Orgrimmar and Stormwind recognizing that the threat of new troll empire is something that the Horde can't handle alone. While Vol'jin is able to gather a mobile force to keep the Amani from surging out of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt;, he is unable to contain the Gurubashi.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Zandalari\"&gt;war against the Zandalari&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Stranglethorn\"&gt;Northern Stranglethorn&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bambala\"&gt;Bambala&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Livingston\"&gt;Fort Livingston&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nesingwary%27s%20Expedition\"&gt;Nesingwary's Expedition&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Grom%27gol%20Base%20Camp\"&gt;Grom'gol Base Camp&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Rebel%20Camp\"&gt;Rebel Camp&lt;/a&gt; come under attack by serpents sent by &lt;a href=\"High%20Priest%20Venoxis\"&gt;High Priest Venoxis&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"High%20Priestess%20Kilnara\"&gt;High Priestess Kilnara&lt;/a&gt; sends panthers to attack the Rebel Camp and Grom'gol while the panther &lt;a href=\"Mauti\"&gt;Mauti&lt;/a&gt; attacks the hunters at Nesingwary's Expedition. Both Grom'gol and the Rebel Camp later come attack by Gurubashi trolls led by &lt;a href=\"Bloodlord%20Mandokir\"&gt;Bloodlord Mandokir&lt;/a&gt;. After heroes of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; beat back the Gurubashi attack they are sent to the &lt;a href=\"Cape%20of%20Stranglethorn\"&gt;Cape of Stranglethorn&lt;/a&gt; which faces its own troubles.\n&lt;a href=\"Zanzil%20the%20Outcast\"&gt;Zanzil the Outcast&lt;/a&gt; aids the Gurubashi by turning the inhabitants of both &lt;a href=\"Hardwrench%20Hideaway\"&gt;Hardwrench Hideaway&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Explorers%27%20League%20Digsite\"&gt;Explorers' League Digsite&lt;/a&gt; into voodoo zombies by poisoning the food in each town. After saving their respective towns adventurers will be sent to speak to a troll who is warning &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Revilgaz\"&gt;Baron Revilgaz&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Booty%20Bay\"&gt;Booty Bay&lt;/a&gt; about the Gurubashi. This troll turns out to be none other than Vol'jin, the Darkspear leader himself.\nDarkspear agents inside &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Gurub\"&gt;Zul'Gurub&lt;/a&gt; have discovered that &lt;a href=\"Jin%27do\"&gt;Jin'do&lt;/a&gt; is wrestling &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20the%20Soulflayer\"&gt;Hakkar the Soulflayer&lt;/a&gt; into submission, holding him by spirit chains and stripping out his power into himself. They enlist adventurers to put an end to Jin'do's mad plans once and for all. Upon destroying the spiritual chains holding the Soulflayer in place, Hakkar turns upon Jin'do, and utterly destroys him, leaving only the corpse of \"Jin'do the Broken\". Hakkar then returns the adventurers to the mortal realm, promising to deal with them another time, before vanishing. Though Hakkar is free, the Zandalari have lost their hold on Zul'Gurub, while the Gurubashi was dealt a severe blow that it may not recover from.\nMists of Pandaria.\nThe Gurubashi were part of the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Invaders\"&gt;Zandalari Invaders&lt;/a&gt;, attacking the northern shores of &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, along with the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Drakkari%20tribe\"&gt;Drakkari&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Farraki\"&gt;Farraki&lt;/a&gt; tribes. They make an appearance in the quests related to the resurrection of &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen\"&gt;Lei Shen&lt;/a&gt;, and later appeared as part of &lt;a href=\"Horridon\"&gt;Horridon&lt;/a&gt; fight in &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Throne of Thunder&lt;/a&gt; raid. Their leader, &lt;a href=\"High%20Priestess%20Mar%27li\"&gt;High Priestess Mar'li&lt;/a&gt;, was slain during the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Elders\"&gt;Council of Elders&lt;/a&gt; fight.\nBattle for Azeroth.\n&lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20Thug\"&gt;Gurubashi Thug&lt;/a&gt;s harassed the &lt;a href=\"merchant\"&gt;merchant&lt;/a&gt;s at &lt;a href=\"Port%20of%20Zandalar\"&gt;Port of Zandalar&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; was allowed to come into the area. They, as well as &lt;a href=\"Amani%20Thug\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sandfury%20Thug\"&gt;Sandfury Thug&lt;/a&gt;s, were put down by Horde adventurers. &lt;a href=\"Tal%27gurub\"&gt;Tal'gurub&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt; is a Gurubashi enclave in Zandalar. &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jamba\"&gt;Vol'jamba&lt;/a&gt;, a Zandalari troll, took over Tal'gurub and enslaved the minds of the Gurubashi residents. The ghosts were aided by Horde adventurers, and the living residents were also freed from mindslavery.\nThey later appeared at the &lt;a href=\"Speaker%27s%20Step\"&gt;Speaker's Step&lt;/a&gt;, having worked themselves into a murderous rampage. An adventurer culled them. They apparently developed a mental weakness since the rise and fall of Hakkar. Part of the reason why they were upset was because the Darkspear had been granted an embassy in Dazar'alor, despite the Horde having helped them against the &lt;a href=\"Jambani\"&gt;Jambani&lt;/a&gt;.\nCulture.\n&lt;a href=\"Razzashi%20Hatchling\"&gt;Razzashi raptors&lt;/a&gt; are among the cleverest predators in the jungle, making them favored by the Gurubashi trolls. The only known &lt;a href=\"Swift%20Razzashi%20Raptor\"&gt;Razzashi Raptors&lt;/a&gt; were said to have been in the custody of &lt;a href=\"Bloodlord%20Mandokir\"&gt;Bloodlord Mandokir&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Gurub\"&gt;Zul'Gurub&lt;/a&gt;. This species of raptor has not been seen in many years. The purebred royal raptors of Zul'Gurub, these mounts have become a rare sight in &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt;. The Gurubashi have been known to fly into a rage at the sight of any non-troll riding one of their precious beasts.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Black%20War%20Raptor\"&gt;Black War Raptor&lt;/a&gt; is bred from the same vicious line that sired &lt;a href=\"Ohgan\"&gt;Ohgan&lt;/a&gt; and brought victory to the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20Empire\"&gt;Gurubashi Empire&lt;/a&gt;.\nStranglethorn's Gurubashi trolls often capture &lt;a href=\"Tree%20Python\"&gt;powerful snakes&lt;/a&gt; to keep as pets or to cook as meals."}

It has existed for a while (longer than the undead Forsaken have), and evolved in the shady underground of black markets and rogues' guilds as the tongue spoken by people of ill-repute. When the Forsaken took the Undercity, they adopted Gutterspeak as their official language. One explanation would be that the Forsaken, discarded and abandoned by their loved ones, found it appropriate to adopt this language of the rejects of society. They decided to keep their language from the other races of the Horde so they can converse and plan without being overheard.\nIn \"Warcraft\" lore, Forsaken can still understand and speak Common. However, they never speak it under normal circumstances. Some have forgotten how to understand Common (see below). However, in \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\", &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;undead player characters&lt;/a&gt; can speak only Gutterspeak and &lt;a href=\"Orcish%20%28language%29\"&gt;Orcish&lt;/a&gt;.\nSample words (speculation).\nThis is the list of words created by the in-game language parser for the Common language and is listed as language number thirty-three (word range 1371-1494) in the Language text file. \nIn the in-game translator, the language parser for Gutterspeak shares similar words with Common and Gnomish. \nNote: The language algorithm used by the in-game \"translator\" merely makes the words \"look\" like Gutterspeak. It does not actually use a specific dictionary. Therefore, translated in-game speech isn't true Gutterspeak.\nLanguage barrier.\nIt has not been explained within the context of the game why the Forsaken in \"World of Warcraft\" are not able to speak or understand their language during life, &lt;a href=\"Common%20%28language%29\"&gt;Common&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe inability of Forsaken to speak and understand &lt;a href=\"Common%20%28language%29\"&gt;Common&lt;/a&gt; is not found in other sources. The Forsaken encountered by the main characters in &lt;a href=\"The%20Sunwell%20Trilogy\"&gt;The Sunwell Trilogy&lt;/a&gt; are capable of speaking Common.\nGame mechanics.\nThe real-world explanation for the fact that undead aren't able to speak Common is simply because the developers don't want players communicating across factions. In the &lt;a href=\"beta\"&gt;beta&lt;/a&gt;, the undead player characters spoke Common (besides Orcish) and thus could communicate with Alliance characters. This led to a huge amount of vitriol and bile that was spewed both ways, so this functionality was removed and Gutterspeak was introduced. There is some speculation (though unlikely) this could change as, since \"\", cross-faction communication is increasingly possible. Both night elf and blood elf &lt;a href=\"demon%20hunter\"&gt;demon hunter&lt;/a&gt;s can speak &lt;a href=\"Demonic%20%28language%29\"&gt;Demonic&lt;/a&gt;, allowing cross-faction communication. Additionally, void elves can speak &lt;a href=\"Thalassian\"&gt;Thalassian&lt;/a&gt; and so can freely communicate with blood elves. Also in \"Legion\", the Pandaren language, once divided into faction-specific dialects, was unified into a single cross-faction language.\nIn the game, neutral undead NPCs are capable of speaking to the Alliance.\nIt has been theorized that Common and Gutterspeak are translated to Orcish in the exact same manner, although this claim is disputed. Those disputing it say that while \"lol\" translates to \"bur\" in Orcish from both Common and Gutterspeak (along with several other tested phrases), these are similarities purposely put in because undead were once living and thus once spoke Common, and have since then changed their language somewhat. It is more likely, however, that when Blizzard wanted to create a language barrier, they left undead speaking the same language, but gave Gutterspeak the same translation scheme as common to both Orcish and Common as Common has to Orcish, thus creating a barrier, but removing the need for explaining why they speak \"different\" languages. This is corroborated by the translation filter using identical 124-word long sample word lists for showing Common and Gutterspeak to non-speakers.\nFan speculation.\n&lt;a href=\"Dan%20Golthas\"&gt;Dan Golthas&lt;/a&gt; states:\nSome fans who have tried to reconcile the contradiction of the language barrier have theorized that the Forsaken just don't want or choose to talk Common. Some due to their hatred of humanity, others because they wanted to break their ties to their preceding life (some non-canon RPG books agree with this theory), and some, like Dan Golthas, who have \"forgotten\" how to speak Common for some reason.\nOne theory would be that it is related to Forsaken exhibiting signs of old age, losing their identities and eventually their sentience. They appear feeble and scared, and forget who they are. Likewise, it is possible that when something is killed and raised as a undead, memories of language are lost. However, this does not fit with how many Forsaken in-game clearly remember full details of their previous lives, including names, conversations and events, even from decades before. It also does not explain how all Forsaken player characters know Gutterspeak and Orcish upon creation.\nIn the RPG.\nAccording to lore found in the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Player%27s%20Guide\"&gt;Horde Player's Guide&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; have not lost the ability to understand Common, but just never choose to speak it under normal circumstances. Forsaken learn the languages of their enemies and their allies (who may soon become their enemies). Thus, they are often fluent in several other languages besides Common and Gutterspeak, including &lt;a href=\"Orcish%20%28language%29\"&gt;Orcish&lt;/a&gt;."}

It is a form of justice all unto itself, and legends about Gwyarbrawden quests often finish with detailed descriptions of the prey's long and grisly death. Dwarven clan leaders do not publicly acclaim its existence, but neither do they condemn it, and it is a part of dwarven society that very few outsiders know about.\nThe ritual predates the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;War of the Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt;.

Some murlocs, but not all, later used the mur'gul model with the spikes (and not their usual fins) and mur'gul likely influenced their current design.\nIn the RPG.\nMur'gul are monstrous &lt;a href=\"humanoid\"&gt;humanoid&lt;/a&gt;s who have thick, warty skin, webbed extremities ending in claws, and bulbous eyes that have a feral gleam. A row of needle-sharp teeth poke from their frog-like mouths. A\nfew long spines jut from their backs.\nThese creatures were once &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt;s, but were cursed and twisted by the powers of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. The mur'gul delight in capturing both &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s and murlocs \u2014 torturing and then eating their victims. They infest the sea, clambering aboard vessels and slaying everyone onboard.\n\"The first bit of the above paragraph was made more vague in the later \"Dark Factions\" version with the addition of the following.\"\nMur'gul are vicious, murloc-like aquatic humanoids. Scholars speculate as to their origins. Some say that these creatures were once murlocs, but the Burning Legion's powers cursed and twisted them. While mur'gul resemble murlocs to a degree, they are far more vicious and bloodthirsty \u2014 and dangerous.\nMur'gul are distinct from &lt;a href=\"mutant%20murloc\"&gt;mutant murloc&lt;/a&gt;s having originated earlier and being significantly stronger.\nThese beings form small groups \u2014 often, but not always, related. Such gangs steal from one another, and mur'gul will try to raid nests of rivals for eggs to eat. Mur'gul organize in a rather spontaneous way, primarily to raid murlocs or humans. If these raids go poorly, the mur'gul may very well turn on one another. Mur'gul wander and many do not even have a fixed territory; lairs are temporary affairs used to hold prisoners or for mating. They only keep equipment they can either use or carry easily, though a temporary lair may have treasures from past victims.\nThese savage creatures fear only one race: the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Nazjatar%20Empire\"&gt;Nazjatar&lt;/a&gt;. Despite their own vicious nature, mur'gul are superstitious and fear the magical power of the naga.\nMur'gul will press any advantage, though they begin with nets to subdue victims. They swarm over their enemies, tearing them to pieces and feeding right on the battlefield. More powerful enemies are lured into the water where the mur'gul have a greater advantage. Mur'gul quietly tear at the bottom of ships and break rudders before attacking.\nMur'gul are able to breathe in both air and water environments but are only partially &lt;a href=\"amphibious\"&gt;amphibious&lt;/a&gt;, as they are much more comfortable in \u2014 and adapted to \u2014 underwater life. Mur'gul can function perfectly well out of water for one hour, any more than that and they are overexposed to the air and become fatigued. To recover they must immerse themselves in water for at least an hour.\nAppearance.\nLike that of murlocs, mur'gul skin color varies greatly, from pale green to purple to turquoise to red. Their skin is warty and knobbed, not as smooth as a murloc's. A mur'gul's body usually bears spots and speckles of a contrasting color.\nLanguages.\nMur'gul automatically know how to speak &lt;a href=\"Nerglish\"&gt;Nerglish&lt;/a&gt;, and can know &lt;a href=\"Common%20%28language%29\"&gt;Common&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Low%20Common\"&gt;Low Common&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Nazja\"&gt;Nazja&lt;/a&gt;. They are also capable of picking up the languages of the creatures with which they interact.\nNecromancers.\nMur'gul necromancers are specialized. Unlike most &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt;s, necromancers rarely deal with undead. Instead, they use their magic's power over life forces to debilitate and slay their opponents."}

Muradin was believed to have perished in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; when Arthas claimed the &lt;a href=\"runeblade\"&gt;runeblade&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt;.\nHowever, during the &lt;a href=\"War%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;War against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, it was revealed that Muradin survived this brush with death, and wandered the wastes of Northrend with no memory of his identity. He was eventually found by the &lt;a href=\"Frostborn\"&gt;Frostborn&lt;/a&gt; and made leader of their clan under the name &lt;a href=\"Yorg%20Stormheart\"&gt;Yorg Stormheart&lt;/a&gt;. Rediscovered by his brothers years later, Muradin rejoined the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and commanded its forces during the &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel%20%28instance%29\"&gt;siege of Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the petrification of his elder brother Magni during the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Shattering&lt;/a&gt;, Muradin returned to &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; to lead his clan in the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;Council of Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt;. He is a supporter of the dwarven clans moving forward from the past and building a new future together, although he remains cautious of his niece &lt;a href=\"Moira%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Moira&lt;/a&gt; and her ability to control &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;her own people&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nSecond War and aftermath.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, Muradin served as the official liaison between &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;, defended his homeland during the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Ironforge\"&gt;Siege of Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;, and accompanied the Alliance armies shortly before the battles at &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;.\nMuradin later became the official ambassador of &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt;. During that time period, he grew close to the royal family, and one day got lost while trying to reach &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%27s%20palace\"&gt;the palace&lt;/a&gt;'s royal quarters. He accidentally stumbled upon the young Prince &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; hitting an ancient piece of armor, finding him a poor warrior and prefiguring how he would later train the human in combat. Over time the dwarf also became on a first-name basis with every one of the palace chefs, even going to extra efforts to secure the friendship of the pastry chefs in order to make sure the cooking would be up to his tastes.\nOne day, Muradin discussed over breakfast what was to happen of &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Alterac&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Aiden%20Perenolde\"&gt;Aiden Perenolde&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil\"&gt;Terenas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thoras%20Trollbane\"&gt;Thoras Trollbane&lt;/a&gt;, and called &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Lord Daval Prestor&lt;/a&gt; a friend of his. The &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; ambassador &lt;a href=\"Krix%20Wiklish\"&gt;Krix Wiklish&lt;/a&gt; also tried to sell him &lt;a href=\"shredder\"&gt;shredder&lt;/a&gt;s, but Muradin refused and sent him off.\nArthas: Rise of the Lich King.\nAs Arthas grew up, Muradin took it upon himself to teach the lad all he knew about fighting with blades and the two became close companions on many adventures. \nMuradin was also one of the founding members of the dwarven &lt;a href=\"Explorers%27%20League\"&gt;Explorers' League&lt;/a&gt;, which was dedicated to exploration and archaeology across the world. In his travels, Muradin visited Northrend and became fascinated with the desolate continent. He returned to it often, observing its ferocious natives and sketching its ruined architecture. It was during one expedition to &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; in search of the runeblade &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt; that Muradin met Arthas for the final time. In his obsession to destroy the &lt;a href=\"dreadlord\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mal%27Ganis\"&gt;Mal'Ganis&lt;/a&gt;, Arthas had Muradin lead him to Frostmourne, betraying his own men in the process.\nLittle did the dwarves of the &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Expedition\"&gt;expedition&lt;/a&gt; know, the dreadlords actually manipulated them by leaving clues about Frostmourne at their encampment.\nThe older and wiser Muradin was distressed by the change he saw in the young prince, but Arthas refused to listen to his counsel. Muradin gave a final desperate warning about the cursed blade and was thought to be its first victim when the ice imprisoning it shattered and a jagged shard impaled him. Some accounts claimed Arthas caused Muradin's \"death\" when claiming the sword (which is true from a certain point of view, as Arthas caused the explosion), though Arthas did make a final attempt to heal Muradin with the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; before he took up Frostmourne.\nAfter Muradin's \"death\", his second in command &lt;a href=\"Baelgun%20Flamebeard\"&gt;Baelgun Flamebeard&lt;/a&gt; took command of the remaining dwarves and led them into the ruined city of &lt;a href=\"Azjol-Nerub\"&gt;Azjol-Nerub&lt;/a&gt; below &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Glacier\"&gt;Icecrown Glacier&lt;/a&gt;.\nAmong the Frostborn.\nWhen the ice encasing Frostmourne shattered, Muradin was, in fact, merely wounded and knocked unconscious. A short time after Arthas left, Muradin awoke. Confused, hurt, and with total amnesia, he wandered out into the snow.\nMuradin was eventually tracked down by a group of &lt;a href=\"Frostborn\"&gt;Frostborn&lt;/a&gt; dwarves, who followed his trail of blood-soaked snow during an extremely harsh blizzard. These Frostborn just happened to be on their way home to &lt;a href=\"Frosthold\"&gt;Frosthold&lt;/a&gt; from a trek across the Dragonblight. Not about to let their new-found cousin freeze to death, they took him along with them, and a short time later they came under attack by a &lt;a href=\"jormungar\"&gt;jormungar&lt;/a&gt;. After slaying the worm single-handedly and saving the dwarves, they took him in and gave him the name &lt;a href=\"Yorg%20Stormheart\"&gt;Yorg Stormheart&lt;/a&gt;, after a legendary Frostborn warrior. Eventually, Muradin/Yorg became King of the Frostborn.\nDuring his time with the Frostborn, Muradin met some &lt;a href=\"taunka\"&gt;taunka&lt;/a&gt; who had a great heart\u2014and an even greater capacity to drink him under the table.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; can see a flashback of the interaction between Arthas and Muradin prior to Arthas claiming Frostmourne in the &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne%20Cavern\"&gt;Frostmourne Cavern&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt;. It reveals that Muradin was not slain.\nYorg brought his people into the Alliance, which had begun journeying into Northrend to do battle with the Lich King, the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"iron%20dwarf\"&gt;iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt;. Despite his people befriending the Alliance and the Explorers' League, he expressed concern over involving his people in wars that would result in their deaths.\nMuradin is eventually &lt;a href=\"The%20Brothers%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;reunited with both Brann and Magni&lt;/a&gt;, and recalls his lost memories. He then leaves the frost dwarves to hunt down Arthas. &lt;a href=\"Velog%20Icebellow\"&gt;Velog Icebellow&lt;/a&gt; replaced Muradin as their leader.\nIcecrown Citadel.\nMuradin is standing near &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt; inside Icecrown Citadel at Light's Hammer. \nMuradin later commanded the &lt;a href=\"gunship\"&gt;gunship&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"The%20Skybreaker\"&gt;\"Skybreaker\"&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Gunship%20Battle\"&gt;Gunship Battle&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the Gunship Battle, he leads the Alliance to &lt;a href=\"Deathbringer%27s%20Rise\"&gt;Deathbringer's Rise&lt;/a&gt; where they encounter &lt;a href=\"Deathbringer%20Saurfang\"&gt;Deathbringer Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;. After defeating the Deathbringer, &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; will arrive in a small &lt;a href=\"zeppelin\"&gt;zeppelin&lt;/a&gt; to claim his son but will be halted by Muradin, who has no choice but to refuse to let him pass. &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian&lt;/a&gt; intervenes on Saurfang's behalf, remarking that the survivors of the &lt;a href=\"Angrathar%20the%20Wrathgate\"&gt;Wrathgate&lt;/a&gt; had spoken of how the young orc had died with honor, and allows the father to claim his son's body. &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; breaks down into tears, expressing pride in her king for this act.\nBefore the &lt;a href=\"Plagueworks\"&gt;Plagueworks&lt;/a&gt; wing of the citadel was opened, Muradin made the following remark if Alliance players spoke to him after killing &lt;a href=\"Deathbringer%20Saurfang\"&gt;Deathbringer Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;:\n\"I've brought in the best gnomes we've got to get those doors open. They're estimatin' that it's gonna take another 28 days before that door comes down!\" \nWhen a raid member brings &lt;a href=\"Arthas%27%20Training%20Sword\"&gt;Arthas' Training Sword&lt;/a&gt; to Muradin (who appears in &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Light's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;, regardless of faction, when someone has &lt;a href=\"Personal%20Property\"&gt;the appropriate quest&lt;/a&gt;), Muradin speaks fondly of Arthas and wishes he was able to stop him from claiming &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt;.\nElemental Unrest.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Unrest\"&gt;Elemental Invasion&lt;/a&gt;, Muradin fought to protect the &lt;a href=\"Mystic%20Ward\"&gt;Mystic Ward&lt;/a&gt; of Ironforge from the rampaging elementals.\nThe Shattering: Prelude to Cataclysm.\nAfter performing a &lt;a href=\"Tablets%20of%20the%20Earth\"&gt;ritual&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Old%20Ironforge\"&gt;Old Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to calm the elements, King &lt;a href=\"Magni\"&gt;Magni&lt;/a&gt; was petrified. His daughter &lt;a href=\"Moira\"&gt;Moira&lt;/a&gt; sought to rule &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;, but the intervention of King &lt;a href=\"Varian\"&gt;Varian&lt;/a&gt; forced her to rule as part of a &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;council&lt;/a&gt; instead which Muradin was invited to be a part of. Yet Muradin was nowhere to be found at the time as gryphons were sent after him but without success.\nFire and Iron.\nMoira became the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;Dark Iron&lt;/a&gt; representative, Muradin spoke for &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard%20clan\"&gt;Clan Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Kurdran%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Kurdran Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt; returned from &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; to represent the &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20Clan\"&gt;Wildhammer Clan&lt;/a&gt;. Muradin gave Kurdran a jovial welcome, and the two warriors shared many tales over pints of ale and even showed Magni in Old Ironforge. However, their relationship soured due to a disagreement over whether the &lt;a href=\"Hammer%20of%20the%20High%20King\"&gt;Hammer of the High King&lt;/a&gt; should be reforged as an act of unity. Even after Kurdran learned that the pieces of the hammer were fakes, Muradin felt the symbolism was what mattered and urged Kurdran to go through with it for the good of his clan. When Kurdran opted to publicly destroy the pieces instead (stating that the dwarves should be looking to the future rather than the past), Muradin gladly moved to support him (which forced Moira to do the same). Kurdran then stepped down from the council and gave his seat to &lt;a href=\"Falstad\"&gt;Falstad&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm era.\nMuradin, &lt;a href=\"Moira\"&gt;Moira&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Falstad\"&gt;Falstad&lt;/a&gt; now act as the leaders of the united dwarven clans, ruling from the &lt;a href=\"High%20Seat\"&gt;High Seat&lt;/a&gt; as the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;Council of Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt;. Muradin acts as &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard%20clan\"&gt;Clan Bronzebeard's&lt;/a&gt; representative to the Council.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; loyal &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;Dark Iron clan&lt;/a&gt; attack the &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20Airfield\"&gt;Ironforge Airfield&lt;/a&gt; and was repelled, &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Stonebreaker\"&gt;Commander Stonebreaker&lt;/a&gt; sends an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; to inform the Council of what had happened. Moira calls the report nonsense and accuses Stonebreaker of treason and conspiring against her &lt;a href=\"Dagran%20Thaurissan%20II\"&gt;son's&lt;/a&gt; birthright. Muradin opposes Moira's claim to the throne, and vouches for Stonebreaker's loyalty. He then talks down to Moira for failing to control her people, and Falstad suggests that she shouldn't have a place at the table. Moira denies the claim, and she sends the adventurer to arrest the traitor &lt;a href=\"Ambassador%20Slaghammer\"&gt;Ambassador Slaghammer&lt;/a&gt;.\nMuradin tasked &lt;a href=\"Forba%20Slabchisel\"&gt;Forba Slabchisel&lt;/a&gt; with leading the expedition sent to survey the damage that the &lt;a href=\"Stonewrought%20Dam\"&gt;Stonewrought Dam&lt;/a&gt;'s destruction caused on the &lt;a href=\"Wetlands\"&gt;Wetlands&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe three rulers were visited by &lt;a href=\"Li%20Li%20Stormstout\"&gt;Li Li Stormstout&lt;/a&gt; who was looking for Magni. The Council could not help her and Muradin told Li Li what happened to Magni.\nMists of Pandaria.\nOne day, &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian&lt;/a&gt;'s had discovered that &lt;a href=\"Zandalar%20tribe\"&gt;Zandalari trolls&lt;/a&gt; threatened the &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;dwarven capital&lt;/a&gt; by rallying the &lt;a href=\"Frostmane%20tribe\"&gt;Frostmane trolls&lt;/a&gt; against them. Surely, the king thought, if he helped them with their &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; problem, they would give him more troops for his campaign against the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. But what the King did not realize is that the dwarves did not trust one another. When Varian sought the help from the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;Council of Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt;, both Muradin and &lt;a href=\"Falstad%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Falstad&lt;/a&gt; declined to offer aid in Ironforge\u2019s defense for they feared that if they left to fight the Frostmane trolls, the Dark Irons would take advantage of their absence to defeat the remaining clan and take over Ironforge. Frustrated, Varian argued that if no one would help, then Ironforge will fall under siege. Only &lt;a href=\"Moira%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Moira Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt; offered aid, stating that the Dark Irons will prove their loyalty to the Council, &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; in the defense of Ironforge. And so Moira and the High King set out in the snow to save the city, leaving the others to think about their actions.\nThe High King, his champions, and the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt; worked together to save Ironforge. On their return, the other dwarven leaders were ashamed of their behavior and vowed never again to allow fear or distrust to cloud their judgment. Free to trust one another, all three dwarven leaders pledged their full strength to the Alliance cause.\nMuradin was in favor of combining &lt;a href=\"Fenella%20Darkvire\"&gt;Fenella Darkvire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Carrick%20Irongrin\"&gt;Carrick Irongrin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fendrig%20Redbeard\"&gt;Fendrig Redbeard&lt;/a&gt; as a team to help rebuild the Jade Serpent statue.\nMuradin, alongside other Alliance leaders received a letter from &lt;a href=\"Xuen\"&gt;Xuen&lt;/a&gt; inviting them to the trial of &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; and was present in the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20White%20Tiger\"&gt;Temple of the White Tiger&lt;/a&gt;.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nMuradin visits &lt;a href=\"Lunarfall\"&gt;Lunarfall&lt;/a&gt; to inform &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;the Commander&lt;/a&gt; of various threats to the Draenor campaign. He is one of several Garrison visitors that can appear every day.\nFault Lines.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni&lt;/a&gt; awoke from his petrification, Muradin informed his brother about the Council of Three Hammers, how they had tried everything to bring him back, and that &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; had changed much in the king's absence. He then asked how Magni finally got free, to which Magni replied that \"she told me it was time\". When Magni went to see the city he had once ruled, Falstad began to complain, but Muradin told him \"Let him get his head straight\". The Council then began to discuss the repercussions of Magni's return, with Muradin arguing that by all the laws under the mountain, the city was Magni's by right, but Magni simply replied that he had not come to reclaim his crown. The former monarch then uttered a grave warning about the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s return and set off to warn the other &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; leaders, saying that there was not enough time for him to answer all of Muradin's questions.\nLegion.\nMuradin along with the other members of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;Council of Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt; led the defense of &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Morogh\"&gt;Dun Morogh&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Invasion\"&gt;Legion Invasion&lt;/a&gt; event.\nMuradin attends the funeral of &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and cries for his old friend.\nWhen a &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt; carrying the &lt;a href=\"Blades%20of%20the%20Fallen%20Prince\"&gt;Blades of the Fallen Prince&lt;/a&gt; visits Muradin, the dwarf expresses anger.\nWhen an &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; player reaches Prestige Rank 2, Muradin can be found in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt; alongside other notable leaders of the Alliance. During &lt;a href=\"A%20Royal%20Audience%20%28Alliance%29\"&gt;A Royal Audience (Alliance)&lt;/a&gt;, he is present at the ceremony hosted by King &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; that congratulates the character for their battles against the Horde, following their receiving of the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Marshal%27s%20Medal%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Grand Marshal's Medal of Valor&lt;/a&gt; from the King, as well as an artifact appearance.\nBefore the Storm.\nAs a member of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;Council of Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt;, Muradin welcomed King &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; who had gifted &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; ten wagons of &lt;a href=\"%3ABarley\"&gt;:Barley&lt;/a&gt;. They celebrated the gift with a feast, but left with Falstad and &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt; to let Anduin and Moira speak. Later on, he was one of the Alliance leaders summoned by &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; for a meeting. Muradin heeded Magni's plea for healers to heal Azeroth and Anduin's discovery of &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt;. Muradin noted that with enough Azerite, one could bring down a whole city.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nMuradin is one of the possible &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; commanders during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Stromgarde\"&gt;Battle for Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt;. Muradin's &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; forces consist of a mix of all three dwarven clans of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;Council of Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt;. In time, the Alliance merged victorious and claimed &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20Keep\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt; as their own.\nHe was later present on the &lt;a href=\"Anduin%27s%20vessel\"&gt;Kul Tiran vessel&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Harbor\"&gt;Stormwind Harbor&lt;/a&gt; with the other Alliance leaders to witness the &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tirans&lt;/a&gt; gifting the vessel to Anduin and rejoining the Alliance.\nFollowing the fall of &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;, Muradin was present at Stormwind Embassy meeting where he learned that the armistice ending the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt; between the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; was signed. Though unable to trust the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; for all that they've done, in light of &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;'s defection, he was open to the idea of peace. However, should the Horde sound the drums of war once more, he vowed the &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard%20clan\"&gt;Bronzebeard clan&lt;/a&gt; shall put them in their place.\nExploring Azeroth.\nMuradin was planning to make a trip to Northrend to check up on the state of the land and on old allies. The right time arose when a letter from &lt;a href=\"Velog%20Icebellow\"&gt;Velog Icebellow&lt;/a&gt; arrived, detailing a weapon found by the Frostborn. The mace had runes that linked to Muradin and to both of their ancestors. He invited his brother, Brann and Magni, to join him on the journey across Northrend, and they agreed.\nThe Vow Eternal.\nMuradin and his family were among those who attended the wedding of &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thalyssra\"&gt;Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt;. During the reception they spoke with &lt;a href=\"Zekhan\"&gt;Zekhan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nPersonality.\nMuradin is a kindhearted dwarf, fond of good ale and good company. He is a steadfast ally and a ferocious enemy. His years abroad have tempered his Ironforge accent, and he carries himself proudly \u2014 he represents both the Bronzebeards and all of Khaz Modan. He enjoys a challenge, whether in exploration, game or battle. Muradin relishes a good fight and willingly throws himself against his enemies. A dwarf of many interests, he appreciates foremost ancient architecture, new lands, strange creatures, and the mysterious titans. Muradin possesses high morals and ethics, is very friendly and is always helping those in need and smashing evil whenever he finds it.\nCombat.\nMuradin begins a battle by activating his stoneskin ability and grabbing his long rifle, blasting away at the most powerful opponent he can see. When the enemy closes to within range of his hammer, he attempts to stun opponents with his Storm Bolt feat before charging into melee, activating his stone flesh ability at the same time. Against a single opponent, or when fighting alongside powerful allies, he uses his Bash feat to keep foes out of the action. Other skills in \"&lt;a href=\"Heroes%20of%20the%20Storm\"&gt;Heroes of the Storm&lt;/a&gt;\" include agile leaps and a super-charged punch that can send a target flying.\nMemorable quotes.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nStormwind Embassy gossip.\nPeace with the Horde?\nI'd be lyin' if I told ye that I trust 'em after all they've done...\nBut who knows?

The letter and item became available in-game on November 6, 2013, at approximately 6 PM PST.\nA few players have reported receiving more than one letter with Murkalot's Flail attached to multiple characters. The reason for this issue is unknown, but it may be that these extra letters are sent to the first character logged in to \"on that specific realm\". If the player has characters on more than one realm, the player may encounter this issue. The only thing to do is to open the letter, loot the item, and delete it; Murkalot is limited to one per Battle.net account. On the plus side, the player now has multiple copies of the letter."}

One day, he left to go fishing, but his return was delayed by getting tangled in his own fishing nets, and when he returned everyone was gone, taken by &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Gordunni\"&gt;Gordunni clan&lt;/a&gt;. One month later, Murky was once more tangled up in his nets and was in danger of being crushed against rocks lining a river. He was saved by &lt;a href=\"Aramar%20Thorne\"&gt;Aramar Thorne&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Makasa%20Flintwill\"&gt;Makasa Flintwill&lt;/a&gt;, who he befriended, and the trio later encountered the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thalyss%20Greyoak\"&gt;Thalyss Greyoak&lt;/a&gt;. He called his friends Urum, Mrksa, and Duluss.\nEventually, a group called the &lt;a href=\"Hidden\"&gt;Hidden&lt;/a&gt;, who had been chasing the two &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s, kidnapped Murky and demanded that Aram hand over the compass he held in exchange for Murky's life. The exchange, however, was interrupted by the Gordunni party led by &lt;a href=\"Wordok\"&gt;Wordok&lt;/a&gt;, who captured Aram and Thalyss and took them to &lt;a href=\"Dire%20Maul\"&gt;Dire Maul&lt;/a&gt;, where they would be forced to fight for the amusement of &lt;a href=\"King%20Gordok\"&gt;King Gordok&lt;/a&gt;. The Hidden's leader, &lt;a href=\"Malus\"&gt;Malus&lt;/a&gt;, ordered &lt;a href=\"Throgg\"&gt;Throgg&lt;/a&gt; to kill the murloc but the human changed his mind and brought him to Dire Maul. The murloc had a chance to run, but he did not.\nWhile the Hidden and the rest of ogres watched the mak'gora between &lt;a href=\"King%20Gordok\"&gt;King Gordok&lt;/a&gt; and Malus, Murky used his nets to entrap the Hidden and he ran to help his friends just in time when chaos erupted by Gordok's death. As Wordok tried to move the murloc prisoners, Murky jumped on him, covering his eyes. Wordok caught Murky and started to tear him, but Makasa stabbed the ogre. Murky rushed to hug her but apparently never realized that Wordok was still alive and posed a threat which was ended by &lt;a href=\"Hackle\"&gt;Hackle&lt;/a&gt; whom he called Ukle.\nMurky and the rest escaped and joined Aram on his trip to &lt;a href=\"Gadgetzan\"&gt;Gadgetzan&lt;/a&gt; to uncover the secret of his compass.\nHe can understand &lt;a href=\"Common%20%28language%29\"&gt;Common&lt;/a&gt;, but only speaks &lt;a href=\"Nerglish\"&gt;Nerglish&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpeculation.\nHe might be the &lt;a href=\"Murky\"&gt;Murky&lt;/a&gt; encountered in \"\", but it remains unconfirmed."}

According to &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, murlocs are smarter than what other races think\u2014smart enough to not let anyone know.\nHistory.\nIntroduction.\nMurlocs are a very ancient race of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; who evolved to survive in Azeroth's dangerous aquatic environments. Based on several accounts and clues, it is now believed that murlocs (or, more appropriately, their ancestors) may pre-date &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s. These ancient murlocs lived in the oceans' depths and therefore were never known to the world's early land-dwelling races. According to the &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarven&lt;/a&gt; explorer &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, murlocs are believed to be descended from &lt;a href=\"gorloc\"&gt;gorloc&lt;/a&gt;s, who are in turn speculated to be descended from an unknown frog &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Guardian\"&gt;Ancient Guardian&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere are some who believe that murlocs are new to Azeroth.\nBackground.\nMurlocs' history is shrouded in mystery. This is due not only to the fact that these creatures appeared on Azeroth's shores fairly recently but also because murlocs shun mortals, holding little tolerance for other races, and rarely, if ever, speak anything but their own garbled language. In recent times, these creatures have been moving in-land steadily from their oceanic dwelling places and inhabiting more areas of Lordaeron and the rest of Azeroth. This move in-land has resulted in them adapting to fresh-water lakes and rivers. Several clues point to the fact that their steady infiltration of the world's landmasses may be a coordinated effort. Whether or not this enterprise has been undertaken strictly of their own accord is not yet known. In the last few years, the vile &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; have begun reemerging from their watery abodes, causing historians to speculate that their migration may have triggered the murlocs' slow encroachment onto land. Some also guessed that the murlocs might be working in concert with the sinister amphibians; the naga may not be the only nightmarish horrors lurking in the seemingly bottomless oceans of the world. Several indicators from the murlocs themselves point to the possibility that the fish-men are but worshippers or underlings of perhaps several deep-sea monstrosities that currently lie sleeping, or at least waiting, in the murky fathoms \u2014 and even more disturbing, that the murlocs' emergence is an indication of their incipient awakening.\nAccording to some old stories, murlocs rose up from the deep seas of Azeroth.\nThird War.\nMurlocs also became unwittingly responsible for the shape of the present-day &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Murlocs attacks on the troll &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear tribe&lt;/a&gt; spurred the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;ish &lt;a href=\"warchief\"&gt;warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; (at the time waylaid on the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Islands\"&gt;Darkspear Islands&lt;/a&gt;) and his warriors to drive off the marauding fish-men worshipping the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Zar%27jira\"&gt;Zar'jira&lt;/a&gt; and then to form an alliance between the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; which lasts to this day. This troll-orc alliance would form the heart of the modern-day &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nA small murloc encampment was located south of &lt;a href=\"Strahnbrad\"&gt;Strahnbrad&lt;/a&gt;, near the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Camp\"&gt;Blackrock Camp&lt;/a&gt;. It was raided by Prince &lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"footmen\"&gt;footmen&lt;/a&gt;.\nA group of murlocs living near &lt;a href=\"Hearthglen\"&gt;Hearthglen&lt;/a&gt; captured the &lt;a href=\"farmer\"&gt;farmer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mark%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Mark&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nMurlocs are sometimes forcibly enslaved by the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;, killed if they do not submit. &lt;a href=\"Deep%20murloc\"&gt;Deep murloc&lt;/a&gt;s were also seen serving the naga under &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Naz%27jar\"&gt;Lady Naz'jar&lt;/a&gt; both during the &lt;a href=\"Vashj%27ir%20quests\"&gt;Vashj'ir storyline&lt;/a&gt; and in the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20the%20Tides\"&gt;Throne of the Tides&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Bilgefin\"&gt;Bilgefin&lt;/a&gt; tribe of murlocs was corrupted by the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; and used against the &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Morheim\"&gt;Morheim&lt;/a&gt;. There are more corrupted murlocs, the &lt;a href=\"Felfin\"&gt;Felfin&lt;/a&gt; tribe, at the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;.\nMurlocs continue to serve the naga under &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt;. According to &lt;a href=\"King%20Mrgl-Mrgl\"&gt;King Mrgl-Mrgl&lt;/a&gt;, the naga have been dismembering their own murloc slaves and wiping out entire murloc tribes to use as ritual and spell components, as well as using them in terrifying magical experiments. He also claims that the murlocs have fled from a certain area of the ocean with ferociously bubbling water and unbearably high heat, but has no idea what is causing it.\nBiology.\nMurlocs possess bulbous bodies, large mouths lined with rows of sharp fangs, clawed hands and feet, slime-coated skin, and can breathe underwater. Individuals range in coloration from turquoise to darkish grey, and while their heights vary from 3.5 ft. to 6 ft, they stand at an average of just 4 ft.\nFemales tend to be slightly larger than the males, however. Depending on the variety, murlocs may lean towards a closer resemblance to frogs or to fish; the iconic green murloc, for example, has coloration similar to the .\nOriginally from the sea, Murlocs move in-land has resulted in them adapting to fresh-water lakes and rivers.\nMurlocs have an excellent underwater vision and can see in almost pitch blackness. They possess small scent glands that produce a foul-smelling pheromone. According to &lt;a href=\"Cannary%20Caskshot\"&gt;Cannary Caskshot&lt;/a&gt;, \"they get that smell on stuff, and when another murloc smells it, they go all crazy! Makes great bait for 'em.\" When the &lt;a href=\"Mosshide%20Representative\"&gt;Mosshide Representative&lt;/a&gt; was splashed in a bottle of potent pheromones, the nearby murlocs entered a violent frenzy and soon attacked and killed the &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt;.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Apothecary%20Renzithen\"&gt;Apothecary Renzithen&lt;/a&gt;, murlocs retain their free will in undeath, though it is unclear whether this is caused by a natural resistance to the will of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; or if the undead murlocs, like the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;, broke away at some point from the greater &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. Despite this, the Scourge were able to bolster their ranks with the &lt;a href=\"mur%27ghoul\"&gt;mur'ghoul&lt;/a&gt;: a group of undead murlocs.\nYoung.\nBaby murlocs are referred to as tadpoles. They are less hostile than the adults, and some are even collected by other races as pets and companions. Baby murlocs are usually kept close to the adults, but can sometimes be found inside large clams, such as those off the east coast of &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt; or in the &lt;a href=\"Narsong%20Trench\"&gt;Narsong Trench&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Krasarang%20Wilds\"&gt;Krasarang Wilds&lt;/a&gt;. During November, the secretive &lt;a href=\"Squigglefin%20tribe\"&gt;Squigglefin tribe&lt;/a&gt; of murlocs often sends young tadpoles out to explore, adventure and begin their tale.\nThe young one have bigger eyes and are bright green, darkening when getting older. When they are young and useless, they are carried on murlocs' back.\nInfant murlocs have a large buck tooth, and also possess a small tail. The latter is a feature adults lose, giving birth to the speculation that murloc larvae are purely aquatic, but as the individual grows their water-adapted features gradually disappear, making them more capable of living on land. Baby murlocs are prone to high pitched infantile babbling and gurgling, often in a sing-song style, and have also been known to dance.\nMagic.\nFor many years these enigmatic creatures appeared to be capable of only the most basic magic. The fish-men are fully capable of casting potent earth and water spells (elemental), and their numbers on land increase by the day.\nIntelligence.\nMurlocs may appear colorful and simple to the casual observer, and their supposed intelligence has been debated. Some argue that, since their guttural language is impossibly difficult to decipher, they have limited intelligence. However, their use of weaponry and uncanny fighting abilities imply a rather sinister racial intellect. Murlocs may not be as dumb as everyone thinks they are. Several clues point to the fact that their steady infiltration of the world's land masses may be a coordinated effort. Whether or not this enterprise has been undertaken strictly of their own accord is not yet known.\nAdditionally, &lt;a href=\"Druids%20for%20the%20Ethical%20and%20Humane%20Treatment%20of%20Animals\"&gt;D.E.H.T.A.&lt;/a&gt; representative &lt;a href=\"King%20Mrgl-Mrgl\"&gt;King Mrgl-Mrgl&lt;/a&gt; discovered, after he had learned their language, that the &lt;a href=\"Winterfin%20tribe\"&gt;Winterfin tribe&lt;/a&gt; of murlocs in the &lt;a href=\"Borean%20Tundra\"&gt;Borean Tundra&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; are as intelligent as any of Azeroth's more \"civilized\" races. Whether this is scientifically true, or if he is just too attached to the murloc species, is yet to be seen. According to &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, murlocs are smarter than what other races think\u2014smart enough to not let anyone know.\nCulture.\nMurlocs pass down their history orally, which given how incomprehensible their language is to other races (although some are capable of learning and speaking it fluently), adds to the mystery surrounding them. Just adding to the confusion, murlocs do not measure time like most other races do, so pinpointing dates of important events is very difficult for historians. Nonetheless, most of the currently accepted knowledge of murlocs comes from outside observation.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Thalyss%20Greyoak\"&gt;Thalyss Greyoak&lt;/a&gt;, a murloc has no more valuable possession than his or her nets.\nLanguages.\nMurlocs speak &lt;a href=\"Nerglish\"&gt;Nerglish&lt;/a&gt;, a language shared by the &lt;a href=\"makrura\"&gt;makrura&lt;/a&gt;, that is incomprehensible to other races (although some are capable of learning and speaking it fluently). There are recorded instances of murlocs capable of more structured speech, as evidenced by the conversations held by the &lt;a href=\"Murloc%20Sorcerer\"&gt;Murloc Sorcerer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; during the Horde's stopover in the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Islands\"&gt;Darkspear Islands&lt;/a&gt;. The Winterfin tribe is known to speak a dialect that is apparently different enough to not make it usable with common Nerglish.\nReligion.\nMurlocs have been known, in certain instances, to worship enigmatic sea-deities (sometimes including &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;). The &lt;a href=\"Rockpool%20tribe\"&gt;Rockpool tribe&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt; worship &lt;a href=\"Neptulon%20the%20Tidehunter\"&gt;Neptulon the Tidehunter&lt;/a&gt; as a god. When the &lt;a href=\"dryad\"&gt;dryad&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Taryndrella\"&gt;Taryndrella&lt;/a&gt; died, the &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Murky%20%28Traveler%29\"&gt;Murky&lt;/a&gt; hoped that she was eating a fish feast at the feet of the great tide &lt;a href=\"god\"&gt;god&lt;/a&gt;s.\nCuisine.\n&lt;a href=\"Siamese%20Cat\"&gt;Siamese Cat&lt;/a&gt;s are considered a delicacy by giant murlocs. The &lt;a href=\"Winterfin%20tribe\"&gt;Winterfin tribe&lt;/a&gt; are known to make a form of stew made from &lt;a href=\"orca\"&gt;orca&lt;/a&gt; blubber. Deep in &lt;a href=\"Nazjatar\"&gt;Nazjatar&lt;/a&gt;, however, murlocs only eat three things: crabs, fish, and people.\nTerritories, villages and tribes.\nMurlocs congregate on shorelines in tribes and villages. In recent times, the murlocs have spread to many regions in both the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. On Kalimdor, the murlocs are most commonly found inhabiting inland lakes and the eastern shores, though a few tribes do prowl the long beaches between &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, probably the highest level murlocs live &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt;. In the Eastern Kingdoms, murlocs can be found terrorizing almost every coastal shore and inland body of water. In Northrend, the Winterfin murlocs tolerate the presence of outsiders, although their trust must be earned before one is truly accepted.\nMurloc items.\nAs a companion pet.\nA number of murloc &lt;a href=\"companion\"&gt;companion&lt;/a&gt;s have been added to the game over the years, each as part of a special promotion, with the pet no longer available once the promotion has ended. Companions found in-game are highlighted in bold.\nOther accounts.\nPopularity.\nOutside of the game, murlocs have been used as a mascot for &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard Entertainment&lt;/a&gt;, given away as in-game pets at &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon\"&gt;BlizzCon&lt;/a&gt;. The murloc has also been used to advertise products outside of the \"Warcraft\" series, such as a advertising . A song has also been written, with Murlocs as the subject, named \"I am Murloc\" by &lt;a href=\"Samwise%20Didier\"&gt;Samwise Didier&lt;/a&gt;. The Korean player Jang Min Chul sometimes wears a murloc suit after winning a game. In addition, &lt;a href=\"J%21NX\"&gt;J!NX&lt;/a&gt; has created a &lt;a href=\"murloc%20plushie\"&gt;murloc plushie&lt;/a&gt; which can be bought &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.jinx.com/world_of_warcraft/other/talking_murloc_plush_toy.html%3Fcatid%3D39%26amp%3Bcs%3D2%26amp%3Bcsd%3D39\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and a murloc vinyl figure which may be bought &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.jinx.com/p/world_of_warcraft_murloc_pop_vinyl_toy.html%3Fcatid%3D\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe mini-game \"&lt;a href=\"Failoc-alypse\"&gt;Failoc-alypse&lt;/a&gt;\", released during &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon%202009\"&gt;BlizzCon 2009&lt;/a&gt;, involves battling waves of \"failocs\" to defend BlizzCon.\nMurlocs have spawned a large following of fans in the Warcraft community. This had led to the creation of websites, fan fiction, videos, and games like the ones below!\nInspiration.\nMurlocs may be another one of the numerous references to H.P. Lovecraft found in World of Warcraft. In his story \"The Shadow Over Innsmouth\", a man encounters an ancient, fish-human hybrid race known as \"The Deep Ones.\" The story implies that they have been living in the ocean for centuries, and slowly advancing to land, where they will claim it as their own by breeding with coastal humans. Furthermore, the Murlocs' implied worship of deep-sea monstrosities is reminiscent of \"The Deep Ones\"' fervent worship of their Deep-Sea god, Dagon.\nIn the RPG.\nMurlocs organize into small tribes and larger clans. The clans can muster their tribes into a fighting force when needed for invasion. Rarely, clans may join each other to form larger forces.\nTactics.\nMurlocs are pack fighters, preferring to swarm opposing forces with overwhelming numbers. When pressed, the pack breaks and murlocs run back to the safety of water, often leaving their allies behind. Some warriors view murloc tactics as cowardly. More experienced warriors know better.\nThose who pursue the murlocs to the water are crushed without mercy. Despite their monstrous appearances and weak bodies, murlocs are cunning foes with sharp senses and sharper reflexes. Naturally, murlocs are incredible warriors underwater. All too often, when a murloc group retreats to water, it\u2019s to draw enemy forces into the numerous hidden murlocs waiting claws. Underwater, murlocs use their aquatic skills and numbers to decimate enemy forces.\nWhen engaging in battle underwater, murlocs attack from all directions, using their numbers and amphibious bodies well. Like a swarm of piranhas, murlocs dart out of the swarm and attack quickly, then retreat back into the safety of the swarm. Even trivial wounds are considered great hits, as the more the swarm attacks, the weaker the enemy becomes. Furthermore, the swarm does not allow the victim to escape. The strongest combatants can die of drowning or blood loss when engaging in underwater combat with a murloc army.\nOn land, murlocs are not nearly as dangerous. Despite their agility, most murlocs are slow and clumsy on land, ill-equipped for the rigors of dry worlds. Murloc forces rarely move far inland (except to find large bodies of water), preferring to stay near the safety of water. When forced to battle on land, murlocs employ similar hit and run tactics, attempting to weaken the foe before going for the kill.\nFaith.\nMurloc faith is strange. Some accounts report that religion plays a dominant role in their society, though they do not revere a single, common deity (to our knowledge, at least). Their religion is then polytheistic, animistic, and even a bit shamanistic. They have rituals involving communication with the sea and its powers, and they worship the water and the powerful entities within it. Murloc beliefs incorporate powerful creatures that live around them, and their pantheons are dynamic, changing to include new creatures they encounter. They may add or remove creatures to their worship structure to reflect recent events. A tribe may venerate a whale (or may even raise its status to whale-god) until a giant sea serpent drives it away, at which point their beliefs change to center on the sea serpent as the chief object of their reverence. Another tribe may worship a naga sea witch until she is killed by sharks, at which point she is replaced by the sharks. A nearby creature that exemplifies murloc values \u2014 such as a strong shark or a quick fish \u2014 becomes a living symbol of the murloc faith. As the animals die or move on, the murloc faith mutates to find new symbolism in their surroundings. Some are known to revere the &lt;a href=\"Deep%20Mother\"&gt;Deep Mother&lt;/a&gt;, a representation of the ocean. All things in the water are her children. Though murlocs have not been observed to unite behind a single deity, some rumors claim that all murlocs revere an entity called \"the One in the Deeps\". However, it is unclear whether this is also a representation of the ocean or if it is even an entity at all.\nVillages.\nMurloc villages consist of a collection of rough mud-and-twig huts strewn about without pattern. These villages typically have no fire, no clear walkways, and no fortifications. The huts are crude and plain, and the settlement is otherwise featureless except for the shallow basin often found behind the shaman's hut. Most huts stand on stilts to protect them from the tides and flooding.\nIn sharp contrast to their primitive exteriors, the interior walls of most murloc huts are often elaborately decorated. Some depict branching coral while others contain mosaics of shell and stone and yet others possess surprisingly delicate tapestries of shaded seaweed. The huts are usually open to the air, with small wooden pillars to hold the roof. Murlocs sleep in the water or on woven mats of seaweed, tied firmly enough to maintain their shape but still loose enough to look like small rectangular nets. Hooks of coral hold weapons and other items on the walls or pillars.\nArtisans.\nMurlocs rarely work in metal and almost never touch fire. They are expert carvers, however, and can work stone, shell, coral, or wood into fabulous shapes and amazing scenes and designs. One such example is a lifelike piranha carved from a short piece of coral. Shaman staffs are also works of art, carved to hold bone and shell chips as well as teeth, flippers, and claws of various sea creatures not seen by most land dwellers. The Blacksilt murlocs of the Bloodmyst Isle are also known for their stone-carved idols.\nMurlocs don't trade these items, though; they typically trade only shells and seaweed and other raw materials (in the case of the Winterfin murlocs, unopened clams). It is claimed that they sometimes award traders with their artwork after particularly good trades.\nSpeculation.\nIf Brann is correct about a frog Wild God creating the gorlocs and by extension murlocs, it may have been &lt;a href=\"Krag%27wa\"&gt;Krag'wa&lt;/a&gt;."}

The Murloc High Sorcerer himself was changed to a &lt;a href=\"deep%20sea%20murloc\"&gt;deep sea murloc&lt;/a&gt;."}

It follows several characters based on World of Warcraft Community Managers (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Fangtooth\"&gt;Fangtooth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Caydiem\"&gt;Caydiem&lt;/a&gt;) which work for the mysterious, all-powerful, and clearly-allegorical Law. Despite its inclusion of CM characters, its scope and tone are fairly epic, and growing moreso as the trilogy progresses. (It's currently about a third of the way through its second book, The Emerald Queen - believed to be a reference to &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt;.)\nThe story is set 700 years in Warcraft's future, and so makes lots of assumptions, but seems to follow existing lore quite closely, adapting to new content and such (e.g. the &lt;a href=\"Azuremyst%20Isles\"&gt;Azuremyst Isles&lt;/a&gt; appear in a flyover scene). Though it is at times dark and serious, the story also follows Blizzard's lead in keeping a light tone at times, with character banter, pop culture references (Fight Club, Top Gun), and WoW in-jokes (e.g. campfires raise characters' spirits; a character at one point references specially-baked bread with a flat top, meant to stack in your backpack).\nThe Murloc is Lonely has been spotlighted by &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.worldofwarcraft.com/\"&gt;worldofwarcraft.com&lt;/a&gt; several times, and appears in the &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.worldofwarcraft.com/community/communitylinks.html\"&gt;Community Spotlight Archive&lt;/a&gt;."}

It presented a variety of information about &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt;s. The original article, formerly located at &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.worldofwarcraft.com/misc/murloclore/murlocs.html\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, did not survive the overhaul of the World of Warcraft Official Website. \nThe Murlocs.\nMurloc origins are shrouded in mystery. This is due not only to the fact that these creatures appeared on Azeroth's shores fairly recently (as far as world history goes, anyway) but also because murlocs shun mortals and rarely, if ever, speak anything but their own garbled language.\nWhat's been known up until now about the fish-men is the following: they are not the most intelligent creatures. They congregate on shorelines in tribes and villages. They have been known, in certain instances to worship enigmatic sea-deities (sometimes including naga). And they seem to care little for the mortal races.\nHowever, recent accounts by select individuals who managed to gather information \u2014 either by spying, torturing or surreptitiously gaining the murlocs' trust, have brought some interesting details to light\u2026\nFirst, murlocs may not be as dumb as everyone thinks they are. Several clues point to the fact that their steady infiltration of the world's land masses may be a coordinated effort. Whether or not this enterprise has been undertaken strictly of their own accord is not yet known.\nAlso, the murloc race may be far older than most believe. Several accounts and clues seem to substantiate this. In fact, it is now believed that murlocs (or, more appropriately, their ancestors) may even pre-date trolls. Of course these ancient murlocs lived in the oceans' depths and therefore were never known to the world's early land-dwelling races.\nIn the last few years, the vile naga have begun reemerging from their watery abodes, causing historians to speculate that their migration may have triggered the murlocs' slow encroachment onto land. Some also guessed that the murlocs might be working in concert with the sinister amphibians.\nBut perhaps the most startling revelation to come from recent intelligence-gathering efforts was this: the naga may not be the only nightmarish horrors lurking in the seemingly bottomless oceans of the world.\nSeveral indicators from the murlocs themselves point to the possibility that the fish-men are but worshippers or underlings of perhaps several deep-sea monstrosities that currently lie sleeping, or at least waiting, in the murky fathoms \u2014 and even more disturbing, that the murlocs' emergence is an indication of their incipient awakening.\nIf that is the case, the mysterious and somewhat underestimated murlocs may be the world's first glimpse at something far more terrifying."}

Use &lt;a href=\"AoE\"&gt;AoE&lt;/a&gt; spells like &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Explosion\"&gt;Arcane Explosion&lt;/a&gt; to kill them and then proceed into the Axis and defeat the scions.\nStage 2: Seeking Answers.\nHead directly west and kill (or avoid) the second pack of Illusory Wyrmlings. An icy barrier is blocking the way into the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Stasis\"&gt;Hall of Stasis&lt;/a&gt;, but when you and Azuregos approach the barrier shatters. Trails of arcane energy are spread out across the floor of the hall and bursts of energy are constantly bombarding the ground.\nAvoid getting hit as you make your way to the Hall of Stasis, where arcane energy is blanketing much of the ground. Azuregos automatically begins levitating above the floor.\nUse &lt;a href=\"Blink\"&gt;Blink&lt;/a&gt; to pass over the arcane energy and kill the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Aberrant\"&gt;Arcane Aberrant&lt;/a&gt;s spread through the hall. As you proceed to the &lt;a href=\"Librarium\"&gt;Librarium&lt;/a&gt;, you can see Aberrants locked in combat with &lt;a href=\"Voidtouched%20Nexus-Stalker\"&gt;Voidtouched Nexus-Stalker&lt;/a&gt;s.\nOnce at the Librarium, Azuregos stops levitating and runs to the center of the chamber.\nSuddenly, the &lt;a href=\"Echo%20of%20Aluneth\"&gt;Echo of Aluneth&lt;/a&gt;, a large &lt;a href=\"arcane%20elemental\"&gt;arcane elemental&lt;/a&gt; mini-boss, appears in the center of the chamber.\nStage 3: Echoes of Ancient Power.\n&lt;a href=\"Spellsteal\"&gt;Spellsteal&lt;/a&gt; the Echo's \"Quickening\" buff to more easily help Azuregos defeat it.\nStage 4: The Way Out is Through.\nTwo Voidtouched Nexus-Stalkers run in and block the path towards the Rift, while a &lt;a href=\"Voidtouched%20Channeler\"&gt;Voidtouched Channeler&lt;/a&gt; stands further back. Kill them both and proceed to the edge of the Rift. In the far distance, near the Rift itself, Nexus-Prince Bilaal is floating above the platform and channeling &lt;a href=\"void\"&gt;void&lt;/a&gt; energy into himself.\nStage 5: Consumed by Void.\nAzuregos jumps into the air and transforms back into his dragon form. Jump up on his back to ride to Bilaal's location. During the flight, the following occurs:\nAzuregos drops you on Bilaal's platform and begins circling around it. The Nexus-Prince has two main abilities: \"Void Consumption\", which deals Shadow damage and slows your movement speed, and \"Force of Gravity\", which pushes you back. If you fall off the platform, you won't die and will just get flung back up, but try to avoid it nonetheless by standing with your back to one of the formations around the platform.\nAggroing Bilaal:\nKilling Bilaal:\nStage 6: Breaking and Binding.\nUpon entering the portal, you finally reach the Nexus Vault. Aluneth is floating above the central platform while groups of &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Projection\"&gt;Arcane Projection&lt;/a&gt;s are roaming around the area. Three small arcane domes are scattered across the platform, surrounded by floating crystals. Stepping into the domes will apply the \"Aegwynn's Crystals of Binding\" buff, the description of which reads: \"Crystals designed by &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt; specifically to nullify Aluneth's magics.\"\nWhile the Projections are easy to kill, they will regenerate within a few seconds, making it rather pointless to try and kill them. Instead, step into the domes and begin placing the three &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Scrolls%20of%20Meitre\"&gt;Ancient Scrolls of Meitre&lt;/a&gt; given to you by Kalecgos during &lt;a href=\"A%20New%20Threat%20%28mage%29\"&gt;A New Threat (mage)&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe first scroll is placed in the southwestern dome.\nThe second scroll is placed in the southeastern dome.\nThe third scroll is placed in the northern dome.\nUpon placing the third scroll, the Arcane Projections vanish.\nFinal Stage: The Power of Aegwyn.\nAfter looting and equipping Aluneth, Azuregos says the following:\nUse the &lt;a href=\"Portal%20to%20the%20Nexus\"&gt;Portal to the Nexus&lt;/a&gt; to return to Azuregos. Upon returning to the Rift:\nUse the portal and return to Kalecgos to complete the quest."}

Since you seek to put an end to the &lt;a href=\"ethereal\"&gt;ethereal&lt;/a&gt;s and claim Light's Wrath, I would ask that you also free my brother from their grip.\nWith the &lt;a href=\"Surge%20needle\"&gt;Surge Needles&lt;/a&gt; destroyed, the shield has dissipated. The &lt;a href=\"Nexus\"&gt;Nexus&lt;/a&gt; awaits, &lt;name&gt;.\nCompletion.\nYou have my gratitude for saving Azuregos, &lt;name&gt;. I can rest easy knowing that the Nexus is under his care.\nAs for you, I can see you're full of surprises. Never in my time have I seen a priest who can control the chaotic energies of Light's Wrath. \nYou are truly the hero we need to face the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nNotes.\nOn accept:\nEntering the portal that normally leads to the &lt;a href=\"Nexus%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Nexus dungeon&lt;/a&gt; will place you in a single-player scenario which takes place in &lt;a href=\"the%20Beyond\"&gt;the Beyond&lt;/a&gt;, an altered version of the Nexus similar to the version seen during the &lt;a href=\"Dragonwrath%2C%20Tarecgosa%27s%20Rest\"&gt;Dragonwrath, Tarecgosa's Rest&lt;/a&gt; questline.\nStage 1: The Azure Prisoner.\nWhen you first enter the scenario, Azuregos has been imprisoned in the center of the &lt;a href=\"Axis%20of%20Alignment\"&gt;Axis of Alignment&lt;/a&gt; by a &lt;a href=\"Scion%20of%20Fire\"&gt;Scion of Fire&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Scion%20of%20Ice\"&gt;Scion of Ice&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Scion%20of%20Magic\"&gt;Scion of Magic&lt;/a&gt; and is at a mere 1% health.\nA pack of &lt;a href=\"Illusory%20Wyrmling\"&gt;Illusory Wyrmling&lt;/a&gt;s are roaming in front of the path to the Axis. Use &lt;a href=\"Mass%20Dispel\"&gt;Mass Dispel&lt;/a&gt; to destroy them and then proceed into the Axis.\nAfter killing the three scions, heal Azuregos to full health.\nStage 2: Seeking Answers.\nHead directly west and Mass Dispel (or avoid) the second pack of Illusory Wyrmlings. An icy barrier is blocking the way into the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Stasis\"&gt;Hall of Stasis&lt;/a&gt;, but when you and Azuregos approach the barrier shatters. Trails of holy fire are spread out across the floor of the hall and fiery pillars are constantly sprouting up from the ground.\nAvoid getting hit by the pillars and kill the two &lt;a href=\"Wrath%20Ember\"&gt;Wrath Ember&lt;/a&gt;s near the end of the hallway as you make your way to the Hall of Stasis. Once in the Hall proper, the holy fire has scorched much of the ground. Azuregos automatically begins levitating above the floor.\nUse &lt;a href=\"Levitate\"&gt;Levitate&lt;/a&gt; to pass over the fire and kill the additional &lt;a href=\"Wrath%20Ember\"&gt;Wrath Ember&lt;/a&gt;s spread through the hall. As you proceed to the &lt;a href=\"Librarium\"&gt;Librarium&lt;/a&gt;, you can see Wrath Embers locked in combat with &lt;a href=\"Voidtouched%20Nexus-Stalker\"&gt;Voidtouched Nexus-Stalker&lt;/a&gt;s.\nOnce at the Librarium, Azuregos stops levitating and runs to the center of the chamber.\nSuddenly, a patch of fire erupts in the center of the Librarium.\n&lt;a href=\"Judgment%27s%20Flame\"&gt;Judgment's Flame&lt;/a&gt;, a massive &lt;a href=\"unbound%20elemental\"&gt;unbound elemental&lt;/a&gt; mini-boss, appears.\nStage 3: Cleansed by Holy Fire.\nThe elemental has two abilities: \"Diffusion\", which sacrifices 15% of its own health to deal Fire damage, and \"Replenishing Flames\", which completely heals it over a period of time. Pillars and patches of fire also appear throughout the Librarium as the fight progresses. &lt;a href=\"Stay%20out%20of%20the%20fire\"&gt;Don't stand in them.&lt;/a&gt;\nOnce Judgment's Flame reaches 50% health, it uses Replenishing Flames to completely heal itself.\nFollow Azuregos' advice and use &lt;a href=\"Mind%20Control\"&gt;Mind Control&lt;/a&gt; to take control of the elemental and then simply spam Diffusion to make the creature kill itself.\nStage 4: The Way Out is Through.\nTwo Voidtouched Nexus-Stalkers run in and block the path towards the Rift, while a &lt;a href=\"Voidtouched%20Channeler\"&gt;Voidtouched Channeler&lt;/a&gt; stands further back. Kill them both and proceed to the edge of the Rift. In the far distance, near the Rift itself, Nexus-Prince Bilaal is floating above the platform and channeling &lt;a href=\"void\"&gt;void&lt;/a&gt; energy into himself.\nStage 5: Consumed by Void.\nAzuregos jumps into the air and transforms back into his dragon form. Jump up on his back to ride to Bilaal's location. During the flight, the following occurs:\nAzuregos drops you on Bilaal's platform and begins circling around it. The Nexus-Prince has two main abilities: \"Void Consumption\", which deals Shadow damage and slows your movement speed, and \"Force of Gravity\", which pushes you back. If you fall off the platform, you won't die and will just get flung back up, but try to avoid it nonetheless by standing with your back to one of the formations around the platform.\nAggroing Bilaal:\nKilling Bilaal:\nStage 6: A Will of Fire.\nUpon entering the portal, you finally reach the Nexus Vault. Light's Wrath is sitting in a pillar of light in the center of the area.\nUpon interacting with Light's Wrath, you begin channeling into it for 30 seconds. However, all the while Light's Wrath will deal damage to you, forcing you to shield and heal yourself while you're channeling. If you succeed, a holy nova will erupt from the weapon and it will cease dealing damage to you.\nFinal Stage: To Wield the Flame.\nAfter looting and equipping Light's Wrath, Azuregos says the following:\nUpon returning to the Rift:\nUse the portal and return to Kalecgos to complete the quest."}

Seeking to end the North Wind's domination of his people, the taunka hero &lt;a href=\"Stormhoof\"&gt;Stormhoof&lt;/a&gt;, brother of &lt;a href=\"Chieftain%20Swiftspear\"&gt;Chieftain Swiftspear&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Camp%20Tunka%27lo\"&gt;Camp Tunka'lo&lt;/a&gt;, did battle against the North Wind in the &lt;a href=\"Plain%20of%20Echoes\"&gt;Plain of Echoes&lt;/a&gt; and weakened it, but did not manage to defeat it before he fell.\nBiding its time as it regained strength, the North Wind plotted an insidious revenge against both Stormhoof and his people: It would erase the hero from history, altering the timeline and ensure its continued domination of the Storm Peaks. It changed the recorded history of Tunka'lo, portraying Stormhoof as a servile insurrectionist executed for his \"crimes\", rather than the hero who had liberated his people. This also had the effect of altering the memory of the people of Tunka'lo. It was not until &lt;a href=\"Xarantaur\"&gt;Xarantaur the Witness&lt;/a&gt;, a Watcher of the &lt;a href=\"bronze%20dragonflight\"&gt;bronze dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, arrived in Camp Tunka'lo did anyone realize something was amiss. Aided by the powerful &lt;a href=\"The%20Lorehammer\"&gt;Lorehammer&lt;/a&gt; and adventurers of the Horde, Xarantaur sought to discover what had caused the change in the timeline. The North Wind's minions blocked the Witness' efforts at every turn, but he was ultimately successful in discovering the truth.\nSeeking to set things right, Xarantaur sent those who had aided him back hundreds of years in time to play the part of Stormhoof and face the North Wind again. Once more, Stormhoof fell while greatly weakening the North Wind, but this time, the hero was not alone. With a blast from the &lt;a href=\"Horn%20of%20Elemental%20Fury\"&gt;Horn of Elemental Fury&lt;/a&gt;, the North Wind was annihilated, ending its cruel reign over the Storm Peaks."}

In the later case, if the owner logs off or HSs, this will make effort in vain. Before patch 2.3 you had to ask every single member of the raid to check the corpse in order to find out who'd be the owner, but now it's already possible to check this on the tooltip.\nChapter 6 still drops from the level 80 version of Onyxia as the level 60 encounter is no longer available. Chapter 8 from Ragnaros has a time limit upon entering MC. The precise time is unknown, but it is relatively short, under two hours at least.

Now, only the retrieval of her gemstone heart can end the curse and allow passage to the Oracle's domicile.\"\nEnchanted Gemstone.\n\"The spectral bridge that leads to the Oracle's domicile is powered by an enchanted gemstone. You must recover the enchanted stone before the bridge's magics can be activated.\"\nBattle.\nJourneying into the depths of Stonetalon Peak, the Horde forces came to a cross roads. &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; suggested they split up to find the end of both passages. Thrall and a party of Orcs and Trolls took the right path, while &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Tauren\"&gt;Tauren&lt;/a&gt; warriors took the left. Cairne warned Thrall to be careful, since all manner of creatures dwelled within the mountain's depths.\nThe Orcs journeyed through the winding tunnels of the mountain, coming under attack from undead, quilboars, kobolds and other monsters, as well as parties of humans, dwarfs and elves ordered by Jaina to delay their advance. Eventually, they came to a sealed chamber containing a statue of a Night Elf princess. The statue communed with Thrall, identifying itself as &lt;a href=\"Aszune\"&gt;Aszune&lt;/a&gt;, and that none could pass until her 'heart' was returned to her. Returning into the tunnels, the Orcs came upon a band of harpies attacking a red dragon. The Orcs waited until the harpies had killed the dragon, then fell upon the harpies, killing them all and recovering from the dragon's hoard the gem known as the '&lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Aszune\"&gt;Heart of Aszune&lt;/a&gt;'. Thrall returned the gem to the statue of Aszune, freeing her spirit and opening the way to the chamber beyond; the lair of the Oracle. However, there was no way to cross; Thrall reasoned a spectral bridge was present, but there was no way to access it. Thrall hoped Cairne might find a way to activate it...\nCairne and his tauren kin meanwhile proceeded down their path, encountering similar resitance from the denizens of the mountains. At a junction in the tunnels, they came to an outcrop overlooking a pit full of Quillboars; too many for the Tauren to defeat. However, Cairne noticed the pit was infact a spiked trap, and triggered the device, killing all the quillboars in the pit. Sifting through the bodies, Cairne recovered a strange gem which he recognised as the spirit stone required to activate the spectral bridge to reach the Oracle. Proceeding through the caverns, Cairne and his men rejoined with Thrall in the chamber and activated the bridge, crossing into the Oracle's chamber...\n&lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina&lt;/a&gt; and her forces were already present; upon seeing the Orcs had caught up to them, Jaina and her forces prepared to fight to the death, but a stern voice rang out, demanding that there would be no violence in the place. Thrall recognised the voice; they were not speaking to an oracle, but &lt;a href=\"the%20Prophet\"&gt;the Prophet&lt;/a&gt;. The Prophet confirmed this, and stated he had brought them to the place for a purpose. The Prophet explained that the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; had returned; having already annihalated &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; would be next to feel their wrath. Only by uniting would the humans and Orcs be able to resist the oncoming shadow.\nJaina dismissed such an idea as madness, but the Prophet impressed upon her the severity of the threat posed by the demons. He told Thrall that the demons had already corrupted &lt;a href=\"Grom%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grom Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; and that if they didn't act soon, he and the entire Orc race would be lost to the demons forever. Thrall refused to let this happen, insisting he would die before he let such a thing occur. The Prophet explained that Hellscream was key to the destiny he had promised the Orcs, but that Thrall would need help to free Grom. Jaina tried to back out, but the Prophet was adamant; for the sake of all &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, the Alliance and the Horde must ally together."}

He was approached by a &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href=\"Mardigan\"&gt;Mardigan&lt;/a&gt; who infiltrated his Wolf Cult. Though Gervase considered him a fine candidate for their ranks, Mardigan refused to undergo the final test of a kill to become a worgen. Gervase wanted to turn the young man into a worgen anyways and abducted him, sending him to &lt;a href=\"Roland%27s%20Doom\"&gt;Roland's Doom&lt;/a&gt;. Mardigan's father, &lt;a href=\"Karlain\"&gt;Karlain&lt;/a&gt;, alongside &lt;a href=\"Revil%20Kost\"&gt;Revil Kost&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ambrose\"&gt;Ambrose&lt;/a&gt;, wanted to free Mardigan. As the trio entered the mine, Gervase infected Mardigan turning him into a worgen. After seeing this, Karlain rushed to attack Gervase and his worgen, however they almost overwhelmed him if not for the interference of Revil and Ambrose, the latter being killed by Gervase. Revil turned to face Gervase. After seeing his face, he was very shocked and immediately attacked him with a great fury. He was finally able to slay him with Karlain's assistance. After the battle was over, Revil and Karlain took the corpse of Ambrose out of the mine to bury, but shortly afterwards, Revil returned to the corpse of Gervase, speaking about his revenge being completed by Gervase's death. Revil picked up a doll and tossed it at the body of Gervase. Then the body and the toy were burned and the Scythe of Elune taken by Revil. It is implied that Gervase and his Wolf Cult were the ones who had Revil's family murdered. After all, Gervase and his worgen may have been responsible for the death of Revil's kid whose doll he left to burn."}

Creating your own addon will be a difficult process for novice coders, but the end satisfaction is worth it.\nSee also: &lt;a href=\"AddOn%20programming%20tutorial/Introduction\"&gt;Writing a HelloWorld AddOn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20DebugTools\"&gt;Blizzard DebugTools&lt;/a&gt;.\nFirst Steps.\nFigure out what you want your addon to do. Don't try and get into the details too much, just decide what you want the overall goal to be. I usually start by asking myself these questions:\nGet Your Information: The WoW API.\nGetting information from WoW is critical to making your addon function. The &lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft%20API\"&gt;World of Warcraft API&lt;/a&gt; has a list of functions that will give you that information. These are your building blocks, and if you don't have a block you need (or thought you needed) then you'll have to find another way to get information for your addon. Don't be discouraged, as with any programming language there are many different ways to accomplish your goal, so keep looking until you find a way.\nYou should also &lt;a href=\"Viewing%20Blizzard%2527s%20interface%20code\"&gt;get the source code&lt;/a&gt; of Blizzard's default interface. This allows you to view how existing functionality is implemented in the interface, as well as find examples of how some API functions are used.\nEditing Tools.\nBefore you can write any sort of code, you'll want to have a tool that lets you edit you addon files. All addon files are plain text files, meaning even Notepad will do. You can also get Lua and XML specific text editors, which will highlight syntax for you, in turn making your coding a lot easier.\nTo review the list of tools and get one you'd like, head to the &lt;a href=\"Lua%20editors\"&gt;Lua editors&lt;/a&gt; page.\nFile Types.\nThere are three primary types of files that you'll need to worry about with addon editing:\nTOC File.\nThis is the file that instructs WoW in some basics about your addon and what other files you want loaded. Here's a short example of one:\n ## Interface: \n ## Title: My AddOn\n ## Notes: This AddOn does nothing but display a frame with a button\n ## Author: My Name\n myAddOn.xml\nYou can read more about what you need or can put in a TOC over at &lt;a href=\"The%20TOC%20Format\"&gt;The TOC Format&lt;/a&gt;\nLua Files.\n&lt;a href=\"Lua\"&gt;Lua&lt;/a&gt; files contain functional pieces of code. You may choose to only have one of these or break up your code into multiple files for a specific purpose. Here's a short example of one:\nXML Files.\nXML files are used to specify the visual style of your frames. More importantly though a frame allows you to easily pass events to your Lua files. Check out &lt;a href=\"XML%20User%20Interface\"&gt;XML User Interface&lt;/a&gt; for details. Here's a short example of an XML file:\n &lt;Ui&gt;\n &lt;Script file=\"MyAddon.lua\" /&gt;\n &lt;Frame name=\"MyAddon\"&gt;\n &lt;Scripts&gt;\n &lt;OnLoad function=\"MyAddon_OnLoad\" /&gt;\n &lt;/Scripts&gt;\n &lt;/Frame&gt;\n &lt;/Ui&gt;\nStart Coding!\nThe &lt;a href=\"HOWTOs\"&gt;HOWTOs&lt;/a&gt; here has a ton of great examples to help you learn. Don't be shy to dig through someone else's addon for help, just be sure not steal code and give credit where credit is due.\nYou may especially start by creating a very basic \"Hello World\" AddOn as described in the &lt;a href=\"AddOn%20programming%20tutorial/Introduction\"&gt;AddOn programming tutorial Introduction&lt;/a&gt;.\nSlash Commands.\nA slash command is one way for the user to interact with your addon. These will be the easiest way for a beginner to let the user supply command and change options.\nThe page covers this pretty well.\nA Basic UI Frame.\nThe &lt;a href=\"XML%20User%20Interface\"&gt;XML User Interface&lt;/a&gt; page covers a lot of a great basics.\nSavedVariables.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Saving%20variables%20between%20game%20sessions\"&gt;Saving variables between game sessions&lt;/a&gt; article covers the key points. For folks new to Addons but not other programming languages, just bear in mind that:\nLocalization.\nIt's a good idea to plan from as early as possible to have your addon be localizable, even if you yourself only speak one language. Review this great article for some things to think about: ."}

Very low level characters will die during the trip, so be sure to remove your weapons and armor if you do not want a &lt;a href=\"durability\"&gt;significant repair bill&lt;/a&gt; in the end.\nGetting to Wintergrasp through Icecrown.\nTo get to &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt;, the easiest way is from &lt;a href=\"Howling%20Fjord\"&gt;Howling Fjord&lt;/a&gt;, through &lt;a href=\"Grizzly%20Hills\"&gt;Grizzly Hills&lt;/a&gt;, then &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Drak\"&gt;Zul'Drak&lt;/a&gt;, through &lt;a href=\"Crystalsong%20Forest\"&gt;Crystalsong Forest&lt;/a&gt;, then north to Icecrown. It is recommended to stop at your faction's or neutral towns in order to add &lt;a href=\"flight%20path\"&gt;flight path&lt;/a&gt;s for when you return at a higher level.\nGetting to &lt;a href=\"Wintergrasp\"&gt;Wintergrasp&lt;/a&gt; requires the player to die at least once in order to get onto a mountainside that leads into Wintergrasp. A major advantage that allows for players to reach Wintergrasp is the use of the &lt;a href=\"swift%20spectral%20gryphon\"&gt;swift spectral gryphon&lt;/a&gt; when you die, despite being at a lower level.\nPlease refer to the accompanying map to get to the spot where you will need to die. The quickest way to get through is by following the red path. Essentially, you will need to go to the south side of &lt;a href=\"Ymirheim\"&gt;Ymirheim&lt;/a&gt;. From there, there will be a path up to the top wall surrounding the &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt;. You will then need to go to the west tower (&lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Darkness\"&gt;Cathedral of Darkness&lt;/a&gt;), and then along the south walkway to the rock face (marked in yellow). Once there, there are three accessible ways to get up the rock face a bit: one on the left, one in the center (the rock jutting out onto the walkway), and one on the right. You will need to get up on the left side, which will end up going out and over beyond the walkway edge. You will only be able to go up onto the second rock (which comes up to the edge of the walkway), but that is all you will need. Then, using a ranged attack (if you don't have a ranged attack, you will need to aggro the , and then run back up to the spot), attack the closest Glacial Bonelord to you in order to aggro him and kill you. You will want to go up onto the third rock up (to the left) and as far back as you can in order to get the farthest reach when you rez again. After you are dead, fly your gryphon up over the rock where you died and as far south as you can rez. You should be now on the mountainside facing Wintergrasp. From there, you will be able to go to the mountain's edge and fall into Wintergrasp.\nAn alternative to going through Ymirheim (marked in green) is to go along the bottom around to the north of Ymirheim and then south through the gates, but there are many more mobs along that route so it will take longer.\nAs a third alternative - recommended for characters of low level: If you happen to die in Icecrown, fly with your gryphon over the southern edge of the area, near the Cathedral of Darkness. As soon as you leave Icecrown, you will lose your ghost gryphon, but you will be in Wintergrasp - now all you have to do is let a spirit guide at a graveyard - best is of course the one north of the Fortress - rez you. Welcome to Wintergrasp!\nScreenshots.\nAll have summaries to explain them.\nGetting to Dalaran from Wintergrasp.\nIn order to get to Dalaran, one must use the portal inside &lt;a href=\"Wintergrasp%20Fortress\"&gt;Wintergrasp Fortress&lt;/a&gt;. The only problem is that you will need to have had your faction's side win in order to gain control over the fortress.

That means you are either a &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;Mage&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Priest\"&gt;Priest&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"Warlock\"&gt;Warlock&lt;/a&gt;. For all these classes a wand is a powerful tool for conserving mana, which is very important since they primarily use their mana to deal damage.\nHow is this achieved? When a &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt; you are fighting is on low health it is better to finish him off using a wand than to cast another spell that will use your mana. Using a wand doesn't use any mana. That means less &lt;a href=\"downtime\"&gt;downtime&lt;/a&gt; and a faster and more secure progression. Also when you are out of mana then you can use a &lt;a href=\"wand\"&gt;wand&lt;/a&gt; instead of some melee weapon since wands usually have higher damage.\nSo, how do I get one?\nThe &lt;a href=\"vendor\"&gt;vendor&lt;/a&gt;s don't sell them (&lt;a href=\"Wand%23Wand%20Vendors\"&gt;a few do&lt;/a&gt;, but not that you can use), they never drop (at low levels), and you haven't seen any as a quest reward (you will, but not for a while).\nThe wand you want is the &lt;a href=\"Lesser%20Magic%20Wand\"&gt;Lesser Magic Wand&lt;/a&gt;. This wand is created by characters with the &lt;a href=\"Enchanting\"&gt;Enchanting&lt;/a&gt; profession. These are one of the few items an enchanter can make and sell directly, so you should be able to find them in your &lt;a href=\"auction%20house\"&gt;auction house&lt;/a&gt;. \nBut sometimes it costs more than you can afford because new players don't usually have a handle on &lt;a href=\"Making_Money_Guide\"&gt;how to make money in WoW&lt;/a&gt;, so how can you do this? 5 or more silver is a lot of money when you are first starting.\nMaking your own wand.\n\"It might be good at this point to mention that picking up mining and auctioning what you mine should easily earn you enough income to buy the wand in the auction house. Skinning also works, especially since you are killing a lot of skin-ables as you level. Now back to our regular program ...\"\nTo make the &lt;a href=\"Lesser%20Magic%20Wand\"&gt;Lesser Magic Wand&lt;/a&gt;, you will need:\nIt is possible to get an enchanter who will craft this for you, as long as you provide the mats, however most enchanters require a fee. To make this wand yourself you will need to pick up the &lt;a href=\"Enchanting\"&gt;Enchanting&lt;/a&gt; profession. If you do so, you will need to create a &lt;a href=\"Runed%20Copper%20Rod\"&gt;Runed Copper Rod&lt;/a&gt; and level your skill up to 10.\nGathering materials.\n&lt;a href=\"Simple%20Wood\"&gt;Simple Wood&lt;/a&gt; is easy enough since it is stocked by most Trade Vendors, and if not, your Enchanting &lt;a href=\"Trainer\"&gt;Trainer&lt;/a&gt; will have an Enchanting &lt;a href=\"Vendor\"&gt;Vendor&lt;/a&gt; standing nearby that sell it. At 9 copper, you can afford it. \n&lt;a href=\"Lesser%20Magic%20Essence\"&gt;Lesser Magic Essence&lt;/a&gt; is going to be more difficult, but there are 2 ways to acquire this. If you are getting another enchanter to craft the wand for you, you can simply pick it up at the Enchanting vendors (stood nearby the Enchanting trainers). However, it is in limited stock, so you may have to wait at the vendor or keep checking back for it to appear.\nThe other option, and the preferred option if you are intending to level the enchanting skill yourself, is to take &lt;a href=\"tailoring\"&gt;tailoring&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Farming\"&gt;farm&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"linen\"&gt;linen&lt;/a&gt;. (Linen is also used for the &lt;a href=\"First%20Aid\"&gt;First Aid&lt;/a&gt; which is a secondary profession and no matter what class you are you should pick it up). Use the linen cloth to make linen bolts, this will increase your tailoring skill (until it turns gray in your tailoring menu). The goal is to reach tailoring 30.\nYou can wear tailored goods; make what you can wear to upgrade your gear cheaply, this will also increase your tailoring skill. You shouldn't have to make trash items to level up your tailoring skill. Don't bother training for things you aren't going to make. Your goal is to learn to make the &lt;a href=\"Brown%20Linen%20Pants\"&gt;Brown Linen Pants&lt;/a&gt; at Tailor skill 30. This is the first tailored article you can make that can be &lt;a href=\"disenchanting\"&gt;disenchanted&lt;/a&gt; which is needed to gather the material you require for the &lt;a href=\"Lesser%20Magic%20Wand\"&gt;Lesser Magic Wand&lt;/a&gt; and the cheapest item you can make that can be &lt;a href=\"Disenchant\"&gt;disenchanted&lt;/a&gt;. \nNow, make Brown Linen Pants and disenchant them. They yield Strange Dust about 80% of the time, and Lesser Magic Essence about 20% of the time. You need two Lesser Magic Essences and one Strange Dust. Each disenchantment will raise your enchanting skill (at this skill level) - so you should be close to the Enchanting skill 15 you need to make the wand.\nNow, buy a &lt;a href=\"Copper%20Rod\"&gt;Copper Rod&lt;/a&gt; from the trade vendor for 1 silver 24 copper, and create a &lt;a href=\"Runed%20Copper%20Rod\"&gt;Runed Copper Rod&lt;/a&gt; by enchanting it. This will consume the Copper Rod, one Lesser Magic Essence and one Strange Dust, and leave you with a &lt;a href=\"Runed%20Copper%20Rod\"&gt;Runed Copper Rod&lt;/a&gt;.\nCreating the wand itself.\nEither disenchant a few more robes or enchant some of your gear (use up some of that Strange Dust) to get your Enchanting skill to 15. Then create a Lesser Magic Wand by enchanting it. This will consume the Simple Wood and one Lesser Magic Essence.\nNow equip your &lt;a href=\"Lesser%20Magic%20Wand\"&gt;Lesser Magic Wand&lt;/a&gt;. You're done.\nAfter you are finished.\nIf you do not desire to continue as a tailor, sell or use up your linen bolts. (You are probably hurting for bag space, so you might want to continue being a tailor until you can make a full set of &lt;a href=\"Linen%20Bag\"&gt;Linen Bag&lt;/a&gt; at Tailoring skill 45.) Linen cloth can be sold, but you may want to use it for First Aid. \nIf you do not desire to continue as an enchanter, your enchanting materials, Lesser Magic Essence and Strange Dust, can be sold. The Runed Copper Rod is &lt;a href=\"Soulbound\"&gt;Soulbound&lt;/a&gt; and can only be sold to a vendor."}

She now leads the &lt;a href=\"Mag%27har%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Mag'har orcs&lt;/a&gt; who managed to escape from Draenor, and pledged her people's loyalty to &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnlike most leaders, Geya'rah supported the increasingly hostile actions of &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;. This led to her standing as a loyalist when the Horde rose up in rebellion against her, though she would ultimately come to regret this decision after Sylvanas abandoned the Horde. Quickly shifting her allegiances, Geya'rah admitted her mistake. As such, Geya'rah retained her position and was later seated on the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Council\"&gt;Horde Council&lt;/a&gt; as the Mag'har orc representative.\nBiography.\nAs a child, &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"scholar\"&gt;scholar&lt;/a&gt;s taught Geya'rah to read and write. would tell her about the &lt;a href=\"warchief\"&gt;warchief&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20Orcs\"&gt;Frostwolf Orcs&lt;/a&gt; joining with the , Geya'rah would eventually rise to the rank of Overlord and serve as 's second-in-command during the &lt;a href=\"war%20between%20the%20Lightbound%20and%20the%20Mag%27har\"&gt;war between the Lightbound and the Mag'har&lt;/a&gt;. As the Mag'har and &lt;a href=\"Lightbound\"&gt;Lightbound&lt;/a&gt; clashed, events on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; would see to a &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;new war&lt;/a&gt; between the Horde and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. In the midst of this, &lt;a href=\"Eitrigg\"&gt;Eitrigg&lt;/a&gt; sought to travel to the and call upon the debt the Mag'har owed to the Horde for liberating them from &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;'s meddling and the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s corruption.\nGeya'rah would later encounter Eitrigg and a &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Horde champion&lt;/a&gt; after they had been taken prisoner under suspicion of being Lightbound spies. During her interrogation, Warchief Hellscream arrived and recognized the two as coming from Azeroth. After hearing Eitrigg's request for aid, Geya'rah objected on the grounds that the Mag'har couldn't pledge soldiers to aid the Horde when they faced enemies of their own. Believing that having a common foe would sooth Geya'rah's wariness, Warchief Hellscream requested that the two Horde emissaries assisted Geya'rah in putting down an ogre uprising led by &lt;a href=\"Kor%27gall%2C%20Greatson%20of%20Kor%27gall\"&gt;Kor'gall, Greatson of Kor'gall&lt;/a&gt;. After slaying the traitorous ogre Geya'rah would inform Eitrigg and the Horde champion about the threat of the Lightbound.\nAfter receiving word that &lt;a href=\"Beastwatch\"&gt;Beastwatch&lt;/a&gt; was under attack by the Lightbound, Geya'rah rushed to its defense. With Beastwatch secured Warchief Hellscream and Overlord Geya'rah were approached by and informed that the entire Lightbound army was spotted heading towards them. While Lantresor gathered every orc he could to Beastwatch, Geya'rah held the line with her Warchief. During the battle, &lt;a href=\"Yrel\"&gt;High Exarch Yrel&lt;/a&gt; herself appeared on the battlefield and offered the Mag'har one last chance to embrace the light. As Warchief Hellscream and Lantresor charged against the Lightbound, Eitrigg activated the shard of the &lt;a href=\"Vision%20of%20Time\"&gt;Vision of Time&lt;/a&gt; in his possession in order to return to Azeroth. Though wishing to her follow her Warchief in battle, Overlord Geya'rah followed his last order to lead the Mag'har to Azeroth.\nBelieving that there was no time to mourn what was lost, the Overlord declared that the Mag'har would make a new home in Azeroth. To this end, Overlord Geya'rah pledged her people's loyalty to &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas\"&gt;Warchief Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. After the Mag'har made a new home for themselves in &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20the%20Brave\"&gt;Hall of the Brave&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Honor\"&gt;Valley of Honor&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, Geya'rah would remark to &lt;a href=\"Mag%27har%20orc%20%28playable%29\"&gt;Mag'har adventurers&lt;/a&gt; that the Mag'har face a new future and that they had to make their mark upon the land. To this end, she sent them to meet with &lt;a href=\"Ambassador%20Blackguard\"&gt;Ambassador Blackguard&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar%20Embassy\"&gt;Orgrimmar Embassy&lt;/a&gt; and then to go forth and claim victorious across Azeroth. After said adventurers proved themselves to the Horde, a pleased Geya'rah honored them with a &lt;a href=\"Heritage%20of%20the%20Mag%27har\"&gt;symbol of their proud lineage&lt;/a&gt;.\nTides of Vengeance.\nGeya'rah joined the other leaders of the Horde in attending Talanji's coronation.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine&lt;/a&gt; was arrested and &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Zelling\"&gt;Zelling&lt;/a&gt; was killed for their parts in freeing &lt;a href=\"Derek%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Derek Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; from Horde captivity, Geya'rah believed that Sylvanas showed strength by punishing Baine for deceiving and betraying her, and is one of only two Horde leaders to voice support for her decision (the other being Gallywix).\nRise of Azshara.\nOverlord Geya'rah, along with &lt;a href=\"Jastor%20Gallywix\"&gt;Jastor Gallywix&lt;/a&gt;, were the only two leaders to stay loyal to Sylvanas. Under Sylvanas's command Geya'rah armed her forces for battle against their enemies, which caused the Overlord to remark that the Mag'har always stood ready to crush the bones of their enemies. During the conflict, &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; challenged Sylvanas to a &lt;a href=\"Mak%27gora\"&gt;Mak'gora&lt;/a&gt;, which ended in his death and Sylvanas's abandonment of the Horde. In light of Sylvanas's betrayal, many of her former loyalists bent the knee to Saurfang's revolutionaries, Overlord Geya'rah among them. Overlord Geya'rah subsequently attended Saurfang's funeral. She remarked that while Sylvanas was a strong warchief she was not a true warchief because everything she did was for herself - whereas Saurfang sacrificed everything he had for the Horde. She then vowed to remember that a true warchief must have both strength and honor.\nSometime later, Overlord Geya'rah had taken to leading marches throughout the city, warning the Mag'har to be on the lookout for Sylvanas's loyalists. She called for them to remember that while Sylvanas was a strong warchief she only fought for herself, not for the Horde. She declared to her troops that a great leader must have more than strength, that they must be true to their people, and live and die for them. She ordered them to not forget this and that they must not repeat Sylvanas's mistakes. Should she encounter &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; during one her marches, the Overlord will greet him by birth name Go'el.\nVisions of N'Zoth.\nA version of Overlord Geya'rah appears in the &lt;a href=\"Vision%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Vision of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;. In it, she and her Mag'har refused to drink the blood of N'Zoth which resulted in the destruction of the Mag'har. As the only survivor, she has vowed to fight against the corrupted Horde.\nIn the aftermath of &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;'s death and the end of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, Geya'rah and the other Horde leaders received the terms for an armistice from the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Grand Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, putting the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt; on hold indefinitely, if not permanently. With that matter settled, &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; addressed the absence of a &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt;. Despite support for Thrall to take the mantle on again, he refused, citing that he had promised Varok Saurfang he would not take on the role once more. Instead, he brought up the idea of the Warchief being necessary, instead bringing in the belief that a change was needed for the Horde's leadership. With this, the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Council\"&gt;Horde Council&lt;/a&gt; was created, with Geya'rah representing the Mag'har orc clans. In a conversation with &lt;a href=\"Lilian%20Voss\"&gt;Lilian Voss&lt;/a&gt;, Geya'rah admitted that the Mag'har had never known life without a Warchief, and this sudden change would be rather difficult for them. In light of Voss representing the Forsaken on the council, Geya'rah inquired if Voss was the future queen they sought. However, she was informed that while Voss would speak on her people's behalf, she would not rule as Voss felt that there was &lt;a href=\"Calia%20Menethil\"&gt;another&lt;/a&gt; more suited to the task.\nGeya'rah later vowed that the Mag'har stand with the Horde, whether at peace or at war.\nShadows Rising.\nIn light of &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Talanji\"&gt;Queen Talanji&lt;/a&gt;'s call for the Horde to respond to the Zandalari &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Dazar%27alor%20%28battle%29\"&gt;wounds&lt;/a&gt; during a &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Council\"&gt;Horde Council&lt;/a&gt; meeting, the Mag'har voted in her favor. While not directly mentioned, it is assumed that as their leader and representative, Overlord Geya'rah was present due to the implication that &lt;a href=\"Lilian%20Voss\"&gt;Lilian Voss&lt;/a&gt; was the only missing council member for most of said meeting. She was not present at the meeting when &lt;a href=\"Zekhan\"&gt;Zekhan&lt;/a&gt; was sent to &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt; nor at the congregation that ended in favor of &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ji%20Firepaw\"&gt;Ji Firepaw&lt;/a&gt; meeting with &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting that she, like &lt;a href=\"Rokhan\"&gt;Rokhan&lt;/a&gt;, was out of the city at the time of the meeting.\nQuotes.\nOrgrimmar Embassy.\nThe Mag'har stand with the Horde, whether we are at peace or at war."}

Sometime after Gul'dan left Garad would become increasingly ill and Geyah would be greatly concerned and distressed that would not be able to discover why, though unknown to all Gul'dan secretly poisoned Garad with the ceremonial dagger giving to him at the end of the parlay. Garad would die in battle against the and after laying Garad to rest, Drek'Thar would ask the spirits to bless their new chieftain . Even as Geyah began making the preparations to move out of the Chieftain's hut, both Drek'Thar and Durotan (who was approved of by the spirits) would realize that something was off with the spirits. \nOver time the Redwalkers would grow bold and directly attack the Frostwolves but would be repelled and with the death of their hunting party the Redwalkers would retreat north. While leaving a few scouts to watch over the Frostwolves the Redwalkers would through unknown means take their strength from the spirits, all the while anticipating that the Frostwolves would come to their aid.

While the bulk the clan would be spared, the Frostwolves would be forced to find a new home. The destruction of their home would have a profound Geyah, who would be able to save only a few of the sacred scrolls, and as such her ability to contribute to the clan had come under a devastating blow.\nFollowing Gul'dan's second attempt to gain Frostwolf allegiance for his Horde, Geyah would be outraged at his refusal to end the parlay as per tradition when the warlock was refused. Sometime later the spirits would be able to get a message of sorts to Drek'Thar and Durotan would decide to lead a party north to aid the spirits, while leaving leave Draka and Doomhammer in charge of the village.

At the same time, the Steam Springs are still occupied by hostile robots, and the Festering Pools are still occupied by the undead."}

When the command was given for the battle to begin, Gharga led the fleet against the Alliance until the Horde retreat was signaled. Wasting no time in following his orders, Gharga ordered the navy to retreat from Theramore.\nFollowing the destruction of Theramore from the &lt;a href=\"Focusing%20Iris\"&gt;Focusing Iris&lt;/a&gt; empowered &lt;a href=\"mana%20bomb\"&gt;mana bomb&lt;/a&gt;, Gharga basked in pride at witnessing the power of the Horde as he gazed at the ruins of Theramore through his spyglass.
