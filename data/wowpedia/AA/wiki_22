{"id": "13197", "revid": "38791128", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=13197", "title": "Spawn", "text": "Spawn describes the process of a &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"spawned%20object\"&gt;spawned object&lt;/a&gt; entering the game world. This can happen due to various causes \u2014 most mobs killed by players return after a certain time (this is called respawn), other mobs come into existence when their preconditions are met (e.g. certain attacking mobs on a patrol quest). Depleted &lt;a href=\"Resource%20Node\"&gt;Resource Node&lt;/a&gt;s also respawn after some time.\nWhen players first enter a new area, and some time ago other players killed many mobs (e.g. to fulfill a quest), the new arrivals may easily be surprised by respawns. This effect is alleviated by the fact that right after a respawn, mobs stand still and do not attack for about 5 seconds. This gives players enough time to move out of the &lt;a href=\"aggro%20radius\"&gt;aggro radius&lt;/a&gt;, if they react quickly.\nMob respawn time.\nMost normal mobs usually are on a 15 minute respawn timer. This may be different depending on the area and mob types as well the population of players within the area. Additionally, if an area is heavily farmed, and the mobs are killed very quickly right after they spawn, the game may switch to a fast respawn mode for that area, which means that mobs and resource nodes return much more quickly, usually within one minute. Looting or not looting creatures and npcs does not matter, it all depends on the different spawn timers. \nThe following is an overview of mob types and their usual respawn timers:\nNote: while actions like &lt;a href=\"skinning\"&gt;skinning&lt;/a&gt; cause corpses to disappear, there is no evidence that this makes the mob respawn faster."}

It won't be ready to hatch for a little while, but when it does you'll have a great pet! \nNotes.\nIn order to receive this quest, you must first purchase two mugs of Dark Iron Ale. The Dark Iron Ale Mugs can be purchased from , the bartender of the &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Guzzler\"&gt;Grim Guzzler&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Depths\"&gt;Blackrock Depths&lt;/a&gt;.

If you do this quest with a party, you'll need one mug for the party and one for each participant. The fastest way to get to the Grim Guzzler is to ask for a portal from someone who has &lt;a href=\"Direbrew%27s%20Remote\"&gt;Direbrew's Remote&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce you have obtained the mugs, go to at the &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Faire\"&gt;Darkmoon Faire&lt;/a&gt;, right click on the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20Ale%20Mug\"&gt;Dark Iron Ale Mug&lt;/a&gt;, target Morja and place a mug at her feet. In a few seconds, her pet frog will return to her to lap up the ale and you'll be able to obtain the quest/reward. Note that the beer on the ground stays active for a minute or two allowing multiple characters to turn in a beer to get the reward.\nIf a party member already has a Jubling pet, be sure that it's dismissed. Otherwise it will lap up the ale used for bait before Jubjub comes to Morja and the bait mug will be wasted."}

Converting the research station into an extensive hive, they renamed themselves the qiraji and calling their new home &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe research station also held a darker secret; it had the secondary purpose of serving as the prison of &lt;a href=\"C%27Thun\"&gt;C'Thun&lt;/a&gt;, one of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s who had reigned over primordial Azeroth before being cast down and imprisoned by the Titans. The arrival of the qiraji turned the station from a prison into a seat of power - as the aqir had worshiped and served the Old Gods, so the qiraji chose to become the servants of C'thun. The qiraji spent the next thousands of years building an army capable of exacting revenge upon the whole of Kalimdor.\nA third group of aqir traveled further south to the land that would become known as &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;. They became known as the &lt;a href=\"mantid\"&gt;mantid&lt;/a&gt;, and fought with the &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; servants of the &lt;a href=\"titanic%20watcher\"&gt;titanic watcher&lt;/a&gt;s stationed there. Comments by &lt;a href=\"Kil%27ruk%20the%20Wind-Reaver\"&gt;Kil'ruk the Wind-Reaver&lt;/a&gt; suggest that the various descendants of the aqir were aware of each other and ruled much of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor%20%28landmass%29\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; together prior to the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt some point, the qiraji and the &lt;a href=\"sand%20troll\"&gt;sand troll&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Sandfury%20tribe\"&gt;Sandfury tribe&lt;/a&gt; were at brutal war. They failed to destroy &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Farrak\"&gt;Zul'Farrak&lt;/a&gt; because of &lt;a href=\"Theka%20the%20Martyr\"&gt;Theka&lt;/a&gt; who sacrificed himself and took dozens of the insectoid warriors with him cursing them as mindless scarabs.\nThe War of the Shifting Sands.\nOnly the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;, who once inhabited Silithus, stood in their way. The &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Shifting%20Sands\"&gt;War of the Shifting Sands&lt;/a&gt; raged for long, agonizing months. The night elves were always on the defensive, always outnumbered, always being driven back. The whole of Silithus was soon engulfed by the &lt;a href=\"silithid\"&gt;silithid&lt;/a&gt; and their qiraji hosts. The night elf army was pushed back through &lt;a href=\"Un%27Goro%20Crater\"&gt;Un'Goro&lt;/a&gt;, to the borders of the &lt;a href=\"Tanaris\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt; desert. Out of desperation, the night elven leader &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt; sought the aid of the elusive &lt;a href=\"bronze%20dragonflight\"&gt;bronze dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;. Their initial refusal to interfere was reversed when the brazen qiraji attacked the &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt;, home and province of &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt;, the Timeless One. Nozdormu's heir, &lt;a href=\"Anachronos\"&gt;Anachronos&lt;/a&gt;, agreed to enlist the bronze dragonflight against the marauding qiraji. Every able-bodied night elf joined the cause, and together they forged a campaign to retake Silithus. Even with the might of the dragons backing them, however, the sheer numbers of the qiraji and silithid proved overwhelming. And so Anachronos called upon the progeny of the remaining flights. Even so, it seemed that the numbers of qiraji and silithid were never-ending. So the dragons and Fandral hatched their final, desperate plan: to contain the qiraji within the city, to erect a barrier that would confine them until a more hopeful stratagem could be devised. With the blessing of Elune the barrier was erected before their eyes, rock and stone and roots from beneath the sands emerging to create an impenetrable wall. Even the winged soldiers who attempted to fly over the barrier met with an invisible obstruction that they could not pass. The qiraji who remained outside the wall were quickly slain. The dragon told Fandral that should any mortal ever wish to pass the magical barrier and access the ancient city, they need only strike the scepter against the gong and the gates would open. He then handed the scepter to the arch-druid.\nHoping to contain the threat for all eternity, the arrogant Fandral then broke the scepter, both insulting and angering the bronze dragonflight. His actions that day created a rift between the allies that has existed to this day.\nReawakening.\nThe threat posed by the qiraji has thus remained behind its wall for thousands of years. Recently, however, the unmentionable Old God slowly awakened from his slumber beneath Ahn'Qiraj. Behind the gates of the Scarab Wall, the merciless qiraji stirred once again. Empowered by the Old God, C'Thun, the qiraji prepared their legions for a worldwide assault to avenge their bitter defeat at the hands of the night elves a thousand years ago.\nIt was discovered that some of the qiraji were finding ways past the wall. &lt;a href=\"Anachronos\"&gt;Anachronos&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"bronze%20dragon\"&gt;bronze dragon&lt;/a&gt;, helped the adventurers of Azeroth open the &lt;a href=\"Scarab%20Wall\"&gt;Scarab Wall&lt;/a&gt; to prevent more incursions. There was a lot of preparation both the Horde and the Alliance had to deal with before the gates could be opened. There were two primary branches of this prep work: gathering war supplies and reconstructing the Scepter of Shifting Sands. After &lt;a href=\"Shiromar\"&gt;Shiromar&lt;/a&gt; rang the gong with the Scepter the ancient gates of Ahn'Qiraj opened, revealing the horrors of a forgotten war.\nOpening of the Gate.\nAfter the Gates of Ahn'Qiraj were shattered, and the qiraji poured forth. The combined forces of the Horde and the Alliance, with &lt;a href=\"High%20Overlord%20Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;High Overlord Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; as their Supreme Commander, had to stop the qiraji before they could overrun Silithus and eventually Kalimdor. The qiraji &lt;a href=\"General%20Rajaxx\"&gt;General Rajaxx&lt;/a&gt; commanded the opposing forces, and an endless flow of &lt;a href=\"silithid\"&gt;silithid&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"anubisath\"&gt;anubisath&lt;/a&gt;s flooded Silithus. This battle stretched across all of Kalimdor, with qiraji &lt;a href=\"Resonating%20Crystal%20Formation\"&gt;resonating crystals&lt;/a&gt; summoning the insects. Nonetheless the &lt;a href=\"Might%20of%20Kalimdor\"&gt;Might of Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; was victorious. The last of the qiraji forces were defeated, retreating back to the ancient city-fortress of Ahn'Qiraj. The qiraji resonating crystals littering Kalimdor vanish as quickly as they appeared, leaving behind nothing but sundered earth.\nAdventurers fought the qiraji and finally reached the chamber of C'Thun. After C'Thun was defeated &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20C%27Thun\"&gt;his remnants&lt;/a&gt; were brought to &lt;a href=\"Caelestrasz\"&gt;Caelestrasz&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Burning Crusade.\n&lt;a href=\"Harbinger%20Skyriss\"&gt;Harbinger Skyriss&lt;/a&gt; is one of the qiraji entities that the naaru kept locked up within the &lt;a href=\"Arcatraz\"&gt;Arcatraz&lt;/a&gt;. As a servant of the Old Gods, he seeks to usher in his masters' vision of conquering all of the &lt;a href=\"world\"&gt;world&lt;/a&gt;s in the &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20universe\"&gt;universe&lt;/a&gt;. He corrupted &lt;a href=\"Warden%20Mellichar\"&gt;Warden Mellichar&lt;/a&gt; into releasing all the prisoners within the Arcatraz.\nCataclysm.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Invasion\"&gt;Elemental Invasion&lt;/a&gt;, it is revealed that some qiraji led by &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Sarsarun\"&gt;Prince Sarsarun&lt;/a&gt; still reside in Ahn'Qiraj and some work for &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt; due to their joint faith in the Old Gods. &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s led by &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; defeated these qiraji before they could invade &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt;.\nSince the arrival of &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, the qiraji have not been seen. Though contained, they remain a threat.\nCulture.\nThe qiraji share their progenitor's hatred of non-insectoid life and are utterly inimical to the other races. They hold a particular dislike for the Titans, who like other servants of the Old Gods they consider usurpers, and their servants.\nThe qiraji and their servants wield items made with the rarest and finest materials: bones from gargantuan ancient creatures, gems from the depths of the earth, metals pure and strong. The most powerful qiraji wield items of such might they'd give pause even to a dragon. The rings worn by the qiraji lieutenants are rumored to grant them formidable abilities. The corrupted gems that adorn them could, in theory, be swapped out with more pure materials to create uncorrupted versions of the rings.\nIt seems that female qiraji must constantly keep their face covered.\nEach of the &lt;a href=\"silithid\"&gt;silithid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"hives\"&gt;hives&lt;/a&gt; in Silithus has a crystalline prism in it. They are apparently a means for the qiraji to communicate various messages and orders to the silithid.\nTypes.\nQiraji gladiator.\nQiraji gladiators are walking, male qiraji warriors with pincer-like claws led by &lt;a href=\"General%20Rajaxx\"&gt;General Rajaxx&lt;/a&gt;. They have human-like feet, and some of their carapace seems to be armor. They are the most common type of qiraji. They are apparently the male counterpart to the qiraji battleguards, but how qiraji actually reproduce is unknown.\nQiraji battleguard.\nQiraji battleguards (possibly also known as swarmguards) are flying, feminine qiraji warriors with huge insectoid eyes alongside their humanoid ones, and long scythe-like claws hidden under their sleeves. They are very fast and agile, but also less armored than other types of qiraji. It seems to be that the battleguards must constantly keep their face covered. They are apparently the female counterpart to the qiraji gladiators, but how qiraji actually reproduce is unknown. It is also unknown where their clothing ends and their carapace begins, though their shoulder guards do detach upon death.\nQiraji prophet.\nQiraji prophets are a type of eight-legged qiraji spellcaster who command powerful mental abilities, often able to take control of their enemies' minds and turn them against each other. Veiled by a robe, qiraji prophets have eight visible legs and three elytra used as shoulder guards and a back-plate. They have long antennae and covered faces. Their robes feature sleeves, which is odd because they have no apparent arms in them. Their breastplate also seems to be the lower half of their head, or at least hangs from under it, and features what seems to be their arms and pincers.\nQiraji emperors.\nQiraji emperors are a type of qiraji who command powerful psionic abilities, feeding off other nearby emperors' powers to fuel their own.\nTypes.\nGladiators:\nBattleguards:\nProphets:"}

He along with &lt;a href=\"Rokmar%20the%20Crackler\"&gt;Rokmar the Crackler&lt;/a&gt; resided in the caverns for many years until the arrival of the naga where they were enslaved.\nHistory.\nQuagmirran along with Rokmar the Crackler were two very powerful beings that resided within the Serpentshrine, alongside their brethren, before the Naga arrived. The two giants were targeted by the Naga and enslaved, then later used to subjugate various other natural races under the Naga's control. Following their enslavement and usage their wills were broken and are both too far gone to save, Adventurers are sent to slay both Rokmar and Quagmirran by Watcher Jhang.\nPrior to his enslavement, He and &lt;a href=\"Hungarfen\"&gt;Hungarfen&lt;/a&gt;, another fungal giant, ruled jointly and peacefully over their kin. With his enslavement and later his death, Hungarfen was left to rule alone, Which has thrown the Underbog into somewhat of a chaotic state.

He was captured by the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; while wandering the region's serpentine caverns and subjected to excruciating torture.

After freeing him you can talk to him and he will buff you with a 30 minute \"Mark of the Bite\" which grants you 110 Nature Resistance and +5% on all stats. This will help with the Poison DoT and his AoE as they both are Nature based. \nThe fight is primarily a tank and spank fight, with healers concentrating on healing the tank and cleansing the dot from the poison bolt volley.\nHeroic Mode.\nThe strategy does not change between normal and heroic, though more care to survival should be taken due to the extra damage."}

For example, poor quality &lt;a href=\"weapon\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; have no stat bonuses. \nPoor quality items cannot be &lt;a href=\"disenchanting\"&gt;disenchanted&lt;/a&gt;.\nPoor quality equipment typically does not &lt;a href=\"bind\"&gt;bind&lt;/a&gt;, and has the advantage that it can be used, then traded. However, poor quality weapons and armor sell slowly at &lt;a href=\"auction%20house\"&gt;auction&lt;/a&gt; and have a high listing fee. Even when a poor quality item has comparable stats to a Common quality item, often buyers will pass it by due to the stigma of 'poor quality'. You will probably find that you are better off vending these items. \nIf you are just starting \"World of Warcraft\", from level 1 through about level 10, poor quality gear that drops is pretty good. In these levels, mobs drop poor quality gear, and bosses drop common quality gear that is only slightly better. Check the gear you find and compare the relevant numbers. Some Poor quality drops may be better than some of the common quality gear you are using. (compare and ) Another example, and both drop in the &lt;a href=\"Solliden%20Farmstead\"&gt;Solliden Farmstead&lt;/a&gt; pumpkin field in &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt;; it's a toss-up which one is better.\nFrom level 1, you will be looking for \"&lt;a href=\"Frayed%20collection\"&gt;frayed&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Unkempt%20collection\"&gt;unkempt&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"cloth%20armor\"&gt;cloth armor&lt;/a&gt;, \"&lt;a href=\"Ragged%20Leather%20collection\"&gt;ragged&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Scraggy%20Leather%20collection\"&gt;scraggy&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"leather%20armor\"&gt;leather armor&lt;/a&gt;, and \"&lt;a href=\"Flimsy%20Chain%20collection\"&gt;flimsy&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"mail%20armor\"&gt;mail armor&lt;/a&gt;.\nAround level six, when you've just left your beginning area and are starting your village, you will be looking for \"&lt;a href=\"Patchwork%20Armor%20set\"&gt;patchwork&lt;/a&gt;\" cloth armor, \"&lt;a href=\"Worn%20collection\"&gt;worn&lt;/a&gt;\" leather armor, and \"&lt;a href=\"Loose%20Chain%20collection\"&gt;loose&lt;/a&gt;\" mail armor.\nFor the average non-twink, the lowest level &lt;a href=\"shoulder\"&gt;shoulder&lt;/a&gt; items appear at level 15 and 16, and are typically Poor quality. These are in demand, and can sell for gold on the auction house. Blacksmiths and tailors can craft Common quality and level 17 shoulders, so the demand drops off fast. (Note that much better shoulders can be obtained through instances at these levels. The is a quest reward from an quest item found on the end boss in &lt;a href=\"The%20Wailing%20Caverns\"&gt;The Wailing Caverns&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Rethilgore\"&gt;Rethilgore&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Shadowfang%20Keep\"&gt;Shadowfang Keep&lt;/a&gt; is farmable for his .)\nOne particularly important poor quality item, &lt;a href=\"Noboru%27s%20Cudgel\"&gt;Noboru's Cudgel&lt;/a&gt;, starts a quest.\nUseless items dropped by mobs, also known as salvage items, \"vendor junk\", or \"vendor trash\" (VT), are Poor quality items and are good for one thing and one thing only: to sell to a &lt;a href=\"vendor\"&gt;vendor&lt;/a&gt;. This does not mean they are worthless, since some Poor quality items can sell for a decent amount of money (at level 70 some items can sell for several gold).\nCommon (white).\nMost quality items are either used for &lt;a href=\"profession\"&gt;profession&lt;/a&gt;s, spell &lt;a href=\"reagent\"&gt;reagent&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"quest%20item\"&gt;quest item&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"consumable\"&gt;consumable&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"equipment\"&gt;equipment&lt;/a&gt; items bought from a &lt;a href=\"vendor\"&gt;vendor&lt;/a&gt; or awarded by a low level &lt;a href=\"quest\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt;, or are crafted by a &lt;a href=\"profession\"&gt;profession&lt;/a&gt; in the earlier crafting &lt;a href=\"recipe\"&gt;recipe&lt;/a&gt;s. \nCommon quality &lt;a href=\"weapon\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; usually have no stat bonuses and don't drop from mobs.\nCommon quality items cannot be &lt;a href=\"disenchanting\"&gt;disenchanted&lt;/a&gt;.\nCommon quality mob drops and purchased items typically do not &lt;a href=\"bind\"&gt;bind&lt;/a&gt;, and have the advantage that they can be used, then traded. Common quality quest awards are typically &lt;a href=\"Bind%20on%20Pickup\"&gt;Bind on Pickup&lt;/a&gt;. \nCommon quality weapons and armor sell slowly at &lt;a href=\"auction%20house\"&gt;auction&lt;/a&gt; and have a high listing fee. You will probably find that you are better off vending these items. There is a good market for many common crafting materials. For example, most cloth can be sold at the &lt;a href=\"Auction%20House\"&gt;Auction House&lt;/a&gt; for much more than vendors will pay. &lt;a href=\"Shirt\"&gt;Shirt&lt;/a&gt;s are an exception. Shirts are cosmetic, and there is a market for them. These are usually overproduced by tailors, driving the price down. Common &lt;a href=\"shoulder\"&gt;shoulder&lt;/a&gt; items for level 17 can be sold. Common &lt;a href=\"head\"&gt;head&lt;/a&gt; items in the low 20s can be sold. These are usually overproduced by crafters, driving the price down.\nSince common quality gear items are less restricted by binding than better quality items, some common quality equipment items are more valuable than their 'better' counterparts. &lt;a href=\"Bag\"&gt;Bag&lt;/a&gt;s in particular have this, and some vendor &lt;a href=\"wand\"&gt;wand&lt;/a&gt;s may be better than their Uncommon quality counterparts.\nAn item that a &lt;a href=\"Profession%23Enchantments\"&gt;trade skill enchantment&lt;/a&gt; is enchanted on should usually be a low level common or poor quality &lt;a href=\"cloth%20armor\"&gt;cloth&lt;/a&gt; item (typically a glove). This is so any character can use the item and so that it does not bind. The exception is when there is a specific item that has the same skill bonus, because then you want to cast on that item so the bonuses stack. (Some folks may prefer the enchantment on a &lt;a href=\"Bind%20on%20Equip\"&gt;Bind on Equip&lt;/a&gt; glove they can't accidentally give away.)\nFunctionally for the player, grey and white quality items are similar; grey has somewhat lower stats, but neither have bonuses, neither bind (except for quest awards), neither can be disenchanted. White \"parts\" items are used in something; in a recipe or for a quest; grey \"parts\" items are generally not useful anywhere except to sell to a vendor. \nFrom level 1, you will be receiving Common quality gear from quests. Some white items will drop, especially from low level bosses. Buying a white item from a vendor for a slight upgrade from a grey is not warranted; only upgrade if you get a substantial stat boost, especially in weapon dps. By all means, craft anything for yourself that you can use if you have the profession to do so. Uncommon quality gear becomes increasingly available though the teen levels, and you should be phasing out your whites. \nTrivia: the most absolutely useless items in the game are white, not grey - excess quest items. Many quest items have no vendor value, cannot be auctioned, and can only be used within the context of the quest. It is often possible to acquire an excess of these items beyond what the quest requires. If the dropped item has to be transformed, additional drops can be acquired after the transformation, before the turn-in. The excess is useless and can only be kept or destroyed. Examples: the Dwarven mining tools in &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt; that have to be destroyed for &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Digging\"&gt;Dwarven Digging&lt;/a&gt;, and the necklace worn by the &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt; chief in eastern &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt; from which you have to remove a gem for &lt;a href=\"Ferocitas%20the%20Dream%20Eater\"&gt;Ferocitas the Dream Eater&lt;/a&gt;. Also, if a spawned mob can drop the item, you may have an extra one drop. Example: in the &lt;a href=\"Draenei\"&gt;Draenei&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Red_Snapper_-_Very_Tasty%21\"&gt;Red Snapper&lt;/a&gt; quest, you can net your last needed red snapper, have a &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt; spawn, and have another &lt;a href=\"Red%20Snapper\"&gt;red snapper&lt;/a&gt; drop - and it's not even edible, nor will your hunter pet eat it.\nUncommon (green).\n items are usually random &lt;a href=\"world%20drop\"&gt;world drop&lt;/a&gt;s, with an overall drop rate between 1% and 10% of kills, are crafted by a &lt;a href=\"profession\"&gt;profession&lt;/a&gt; in mid range crafting &lt;a href=\"recipe\"&gt;recipe&lt;/a&gt;s, or are awarded by a mid level &lt;a href=\"quest\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Jewelcrafting\"&gt;Jewelcrafters&lt;/a&gt; have the ability to produce Uncommon quality &lt;a href=\"ring\"&gt;ring&lt;/a&gt;s as soon as they receive &lt;a href=\"apprentice\"&gt;apprentice&lt;/a&gt; training.\nUncommon equipment is usually &lt;a href=\"Bind%20on%20Equip\"&gt;Bind on Equip&lt;/a&gt;, though items dropped from bosses or awarded by quests will generally &lt;a href=\"Bind%20on%20Pickup\"&gt;Bind on Pickup&lt;/a&gt;.\nMost Uncommon quality equipment items can be &lt;a href=\"disenchanting\"&gt;disenchanted&lt;/a&gt;, though there are some &lt;a href=\"disenchanting%23Non-Disenchantable%20Items\"&gt;exceptions&lt;/a&gt;)\nIt's a good idea to sell unused uncommon items at the &lt;a href=\"auction%20house\"&gt;auction house&lt;/a&gt; instead of to vendors, or &lt;a href=\"disenchant\"&gt;disenchant&lt;/a&gt; them for enchanting reagents.\nThe primary difference between uncommon items and items of higher quality is that Uncommon items generally only include bonuses to one or two different stats. &lt;a href=\"Itemization\"&gt;Itemization&lt;/a&gt; for most classes these days is fairly complex, and it's not uncommon to need around four-six different stat types. (say, Agility, Stamina, Intellect, AP, crit rating, and hit rating for Hunters)\nAlthough most people usually want items primarily for ego gratification reasons, the fact that tend to offer bonuses to around four different stats, generally means that they are a far more desirable upgrade in purely objective terms, as well.\nYou won't see an uncommon item drop in your beginning subzone. You will probably see a few in your village level play. The first time you get one is an awesome moment. The honeymoon won't last. By the twenties levels, Uncommon items will be your bread and butter gear, and you will be striving for Rare items. Excess Uncommon items with poor stat combinations become disenchanter trash.\nRare (blue).\n quality can also be referred to as quality.\nRare items usually come from instances (mostly boss drops or &lt;a href=\"dungeon%20quest\"&gt;dungeon quest&lt;/a&gt; rewards, with some trash drops) or are crafted by a &lt;a href=\"profession\"&gt;profession&lt;/a&gt; in high level crafting &lt;a href=\"recipe\"&gt;recipe&lt;/a&gt;s. A few are awarded by high level non-dungeon &lt;a href=\"quest\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt;s, usually at the end of a long &lt;a href=\"quest%20chain\"&gt;quest chain&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Satchel%20of%20Helpful%20Goods\"&gt;Satchel of Helpful Goods&lt;/a&gt;, awarded for completing a random lower-level dungeon using the &lt;a href=\"Dungeon%20Finder\"&gt;Dungeon Finder&lt;/a&gt;, also contains a Rare item. Rare PvP items can be bought with &lt;a href=\"Honor%20point\"&gt;Honor point&lt;/a&gt;s.\nMost Rare quality equipment items can be &lt;a href=\"disenchanting\"&gt;disenchanted&lt;/a&gt;, yielding a &lt;a href=\"shard\"&gt;shard&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe &lt;a href=\"Dungeon%20Finder\"&gt;Dungeon Finder&lt;/a&gt; has made it far easier to acquire rare items while leveling.\nEpic (purple).\n quality items are designed to allow players to continue growing in power after they reach the level cap; thus, epic armor and weapons require the highest level that existed when they were introduced (60, 70, 80 or 85) and are &lt;a href=\"armor%20set\"&gt;tiered&lt;/a&gt; so that for as long as possible, players will still have something to strive for. They generally have much better bonuses than other items of their required level.\nLike rare items, there are a few &lt;a href=\"Bind%20on%20Equip\"&gt;BoE&lt;/a&gt; world drop epics. Most &lt;a href=\"Bind%20on%20Pickup\"&gt;BoP&lt;/a&gt; epic items are found in &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt; instances, or top level recipes for tradeskills. Starting with &lt;a href=\"Tier%2011\"&gt;Tier 11&lt;/a&gt;, some PvE epics from the newest tier can be bought with &lt;a href=\"Valor%20point\"&gt;Valor point&lt;/a&gt;s, and some from previous tiers can be bought with &lt;a href=\"Justice%20Points\"&gt;Justice Points&lt;/a&gt;. Epic items dropped from heroic 5-player dungeon bosses in &lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;Wrath of the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, but in &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; they drop rare items instead. Some epic items are sold by vendors for gold, but require &lt;a href=\"exalted\"&gt;exalted&lt;/a&gt; reputation with a specific faction.\nPvP epics requiring level 85 can be bought with &lt;a href=\"Conquest%20point\"&gt;Conquest point&lt;/a&gt;s or obtained as drops from &lt;a href=\"Argaloth\"&gt;Argaloth&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Baradin%20Hold\"&gt;Baradin Hold&lt;/a&gt;. Lower-level PvP epics can be bought with &lt;a href=\"Honor%20point\"&gt;Honor point&lt;/a&gt;s, and those from &lt;a href=\"Season%208\"&gt;arena season 8&lt;/a&gt; also drop from bosses in the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20Archavon\"&gt;Vault of Archavon&lt;/a&gt;.\nMost quality equipment items can be &lt;a href=\"disenchanting\"&gt;disenchanted&lt;/a&gt;. \nLegendary (orange).\n items, such as &lt;a href=\"Sulfuras%2C%20Hand%20of%20Ragnaros\"&gt;Sulfuras, Hand of Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thunderfury%2C%20Blessed%20Blade%20of%20the%20Windseeker\"&gt;Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shadowmourne\"&gt;Shadowmourne&lt;/a&gt;, are a step up from epic items and are truly exceptional. Not only do they have even better stat bonuses than epic items, but they also serve pivotal roles in the game's &lt;a href=\"lore\"&gt;lore&lt;/a&gt;. These items usually require the completion of a long chain of quests, as it is with Thunderfury, but this is not always the case.\nLegendary items cannot be &lt;a href=\"disenchanting\"&gt;disenchanted&lt;/a&gt;.\nArtifact (light gold).\n quality items are a step above Legendary. They are objects of unimaginable power, and like legendary items, are grounded deeply in Warcraft lore. &lt;a href=\"Artifact\"&gt;Artifact&lt;/a&gt; weapons debut in \"\", with one artifact per class specialization. Previously, the Artifact item quality existed in the game since launch and was used for GM items unavailable to players.\nHeirloom (Blizzard blue).\n items are &lt;a href=\"Bind%20to%20Account\"&gt;Bind to Account&lt;/a&gt;, allowing a player to freely mail the item to other characters on the account that reside on the same realm. Heirloom weapons, armor, and trinkets have the ability to scale to the level of the person wearing them with stats equivalent to a Rare quality item. Some scalable heirloom armor will transform into the type of armor the player is capable of wearing (for example: plate armor will temporarily transform into mail when given to a level 1 warrior).\nFor players who have more than one \"World of Warcraft\" account on the same &lt;a href=\"Battle.net\"&gt;Battle.net&lt;/a&gt; account, some heirloom items became Battle.net account bound in &lt;a href=\"Patch%204.1\"&gt;Patch 4.1&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn \"\", the quality color for heirlooms is changed from light gold to Blizzard blue, presumably to avoid confusion with artifacts, introduced to players in the same expansion.\nWoW Token (Blizzard blue).\n items are special items purchased from the &lt;a href=\"In-Game%20Shop\"&gt;In-Game Shop&lt;/a&gt; and give players the ability to legitimately purchase &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; using real money. The only items with this quality are the WoW Token in-game items, so see that article for more information.\nTips.\nQuality is an indication of how good an item is for gameplay, but other factors must be considered. The level of the item is important, higher is better; quality only makes up for a limited level discrepancy. The appropriateness of the buffs must be considered; there is no point to acquiring an item that has buffs that do nothing for your character class. \nBlizzard often assigns qualities to limited access items to help prevent the player from accidentally throwing away an item. For example, the characteristics of &lt;a href=\"companion\"&gt;companion&lt;/a&gt;s are pretty equivalent, but Blizzard assigned a or quality to pets that are obtainable only through a special code. You can still throw the item away, but you are more likely to notice. "}

{"id": "15129", "revid": "55502594", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=15129", "title": "Emerald Dream", "text": "The Emerald Dream (also known as the Emerald Dreaming, the Dream of Creation, the land of dreams, or simply the Dream or Dreaming) is a vast, ever-changing spirit world that exists outside the boundaries of the physical world and is the verdant realm of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspect&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt;. The Emerald Dream represents how &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; would have been if intelligent beings had not altered its surface, or what the world might some day be again.\nThe Emerald Dream apparently has some kind of ancient link with the realm of &lt;a href=\"Ardenweald\"&gt;Ardenweald&lt;/a&gt;, where souls close to nature, such as &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt; herself, rest in the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;, essentially being opposite blooms connected to the same tree, with the former personalizing &lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;Life&lt;/a&gt; in its waxing stages, and the latter embodying Life in its wane. Where the Dream represents the spring and summer of the cycle of life, Ardenweald reflects autumn and winter, in essence, being the highest expression of the relationship between endings and beginnings - between &lt;a href=\"Death\"&gt;Death&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;Life&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn this world of untamed nature, &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s gain insight and oneness with the Great Cycle, and everything about them is rooted in cycles and transience, and the Emerald Dream itself.\nNature of the Dream.\nThe Emerald Dream is a vast and ever-shifting dimension of spirits and nature magic that defies mortal perceptions of reality. Time and distance hold no meaning in this intangible realm, and a day in the physical world can feel like decades in the Dream.\nThe Dream's Purpose.\nThe Dream is under the protection of the green &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspect&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt;. After the titans had shaped Azeroth, they sent Ysera into an eternal trance and charged her with watching over all of Azeroth from the Dream. As a result, green dragons guard every portal into the Dream, and they always see both the landscape of Azeroth and the corresponding dreamscape. This enchanted vision, known as dreamsight, allows green dragons to perceive their surroundings with perfect clarity despite the dragons' closed eyes.\nUnlike Azeroth, the Emerald Dream is a realm that is primarily spiritual instead of physical. All who enter the Dream can affect it to a minor extent, but only temporarily: the underlying structure of the Dream inevitably reasserts itself. Even Ysera cannot change the Dream permanently, nor, indeed, would she wish to do so. She does not control the Dream; on the contrary, it is closer to the truth to say that the Dream controls her. Using the Dream as her unfaltering guide, she regulates the ebb and flow of nature and the evolutionary path of the world itself.\nPerception of the self inside the Dream.\nThe creatures of Azeroth can visit the Emerald Dream either physically or via dreams, as the realm's name indicates. When an individual's spirit visits the Dream, leaving the body behind, that individual will manifest his or her dreamform, which normally looks and behaves much as that individual's physical body might. Hence, for most creatures, moving through the Dream is achieved in the normal fashion, despite the realm's chiefly spiritual character. These rules do not apply to druids of sufficient skill or experience, who are trained to see beyond physical reality. These druids might be capable of abnormal movement in the Dream (e.g., a night elf who can sprint at a greatly accelerated rate, walk through solid objects, or fly). It is quite rare to see such unusual capabilities in non-druids, but it is not beyond the realm of possibility.\nCharacteristics of the Dream.\nThe Dream can be affected by all dreamers to a minor and temporary extent. However, no living creature except the titans has ever been able to permanently change the Dream. Ysera herself cannot control or shape the Dream, which has its own ecology and a variety of inhabitants, both sentient and non-sentient. Time is meaningless inside the Dream. As a result, the green dragonflight, which spends the majority of its time in the Dream, is extremely long-lived. Ysera's consorts in particular almost never emerge from the Dream and are effectively immortal, as are all other permanent denizens in the Dream. Because the titans invested a great deal of work in perfecting their design of Azeroth, the Emerald Dream is not one a single perfect vision of what Azeroth would become. The finished design of the planet was the product of many previous flawed or unfinished models. The Dream, therefore, has multiple layers, one for each of these earlier incarnations. These older layers of the Dream are often incomplete and therefore limited in scope, relative to the finalized Dream.\nThe Emerald Dream was originally described as \"a vast, ever-changing spirit world, existed outside the boundaries of the physical world. From the Dream, Ysera regulated the ebb and flow of nature and the evolutionary path of the world itself.\" This implies less stagnation than the Emerald Dream described in other sources.\nThe spirits of departed animals on Azeroth travel to the Emerald Dream as their afterlife, with the mighty &lt;a href=\"G%27Hanir\"&gt;G'Hanir&lt;/a&gt; in particular serving as the home to the spirits of winged creatures. The &lt;a href=\"Wild%20God\"&gt;Wild God&lt;/a&gt;s, having been linked to the Dream by Freya, also come here after dying, as do members of the green dragonflight such as Ysera and the former &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20of%20Nightmare\"&gt;Dragons of Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;. Some druids, such as &lt;a href=\"Elerethe%20Renferal\"&gt;Elerethe Renferal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thaon%20Moonclaw\"&gt;Thaon Moonclaw&lt;/a&gt;, do as well, though it is unclear if all druids do.\nHistory.\nCreation.\n&lt;a href=\"Freya\"&gt;Freya&lt;/a&gt;, one of the nine &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Keeper\"&gt;Keeper&lt;/a&gt;s, created the Emerald Dream during the Ordering of Azeroth to serve as the underlying blueprint for the planet. Some believe that she wove the Emerald Dream into being from nothing, others claim that this strange place had always existed in some form, a dream born from Azeroth's slumbering &lt;a href=\"world-soul\"&gt;world-soul&lt;/a&gt;, which Freya tapped into and molded what would become known as the Dream as a way to commune with the nascent titan.\nWithin the Emerald Dream, she planted &lt;a href=\"G%27Hanir\"&gt;G'Hanir&lt;/a&gt;, the Mother Tree, a single massive tree set atop a high peak. From it bloomed many fruits and flowers, and new life flowed outwards in waves, sweeping across the land. Freya sculpted many pools of life in other locations within the Dream, but G'Hanir was the first, the tallest, and the most radiant. For millennia, it served as a source of healing and balance that extended beyond the Dream and into the physical world, acting as a guide for Azeroth's natural life.\nAs she set out to populate the world with life, she placed one of the first seeds in what would become &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, near the powerful energy of the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt;. From it grew &lt;a href=\"Fu%20Zan\"&gt;Fu Zan&lt;/a&gt;, the first tree. It grew strong and tall, drinking deeply from the Vale's resonant power. More trees arose around it. Lush forests, both in the Dream and in the waking world, sprang to life across the region. All of Pandaria's forests descended from it.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt; became one of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspect\"&gt;Dragon Aspect&lt;/a&gt;s, she was sent into an eternal trance and charged by the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s with watching over all of Azeroth from the Emerald Dream. As a result, green dragons guard every portal into the Dream, and they always see both the landscape of Azeroth and the corresponding dreamscape. This enchanted vision, known as dreamsight, allows green dragons to perceive their surroundings with perfect clarity despite the dragons' closed eyes.\nThe very first connection that the green dragonflight forged with the Dream was the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Bough\"&gt;Dream Portal&lt;/a&gt;, located on the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Bough\"&gt;Ancient Bough&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;. Nature magic billows out of the portal, encouraging life to thrive in the surrounding &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Gardens\"&gt;Emerald Gardens&lt;/a&gt;. All of the primordial flora and fauna thriving in the Dream is reflected on the &lt;a href=\"Ohn%27ahran%20Plains\"&gt;Ohn'ahran Plains&lt;/a&gt; that border the Gardens.\nNordrassil.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, the druid &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; made use of the Emerald Dream to enter into the palace of &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt; and thwart the plans of Lord &lt;a href=\"Xavius\"&gt;Xavius&lt;/a&gt;. After the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, three of the Dragon Aspects grew a &lt;a href=\"World%20Tree\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt;, atop the new &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity%20%28Hyjal%29\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;, and Ysera linked Nordrassil to the Emerald Dream. Her action was primarily meant to prevent abuse of the Well and to keep the Well's powers from growing. The tempering energies of the Dream act as a calming influence on the Well's chaotic energies. Secondarily, Nordrassil's connection to the Emerald Dream allowed the druids of Azeroth to travel easily to the Dream.\nSince that time, all &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s have periodically hibernated while their spirits wandered the dreamways. This hibernation is not some sort of physical requirement for druids, though; rather, the hibernation was a communion with the Emerald Dream. The druids were learning more about the natural world through the Dream. There was always something new for the druids to learn, even in the smallest blade of grass. The first druids molded the forests of &lt;a href=\"Val%27sharah\"&gt;Val'sharah&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt; to be a reflection of the Dream\u2014no more than an echo, but as close to the Dream as the real world could ever come.\nIn the aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Krasus\"&gt;Krasus&lt;/a&gt; entered &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt;'s domain of dreams using a poison that nearly killed him since death could be compared to the deepest sleep.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the druids empowered Nordrassil with the night elves' immortality and the energies of countless night elf spirits. Nordrassil then gave off a blast of energy that killed the demon lord &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt;, ending the war and sealing the Burning Legion's defeat on Azeroth. Although Nordrassil was not killed in the process, the night elves' noble sacrifice left them mortal and cost the druids their easily accessible link to the Emerald Dream. Thus, reaching the Dream has become a significantly more difficult prospect, and fewer druids are able to walk the Dream today.\nTeldrassil.\nCertain that the night elves' immortality could be restored, Archdruid &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt; proposed growing a replacement World Tree, though the dragons showed no sign of offering their assistance in the process. Archdruid Malfurion Stormrage flatly refused; he argued that without the blessing of the dragonflights, the tree would be an abomination. When Malfurion fell into a mysterious coma, Fandral became the new leader of the druids. His first act was to persuade the rest of the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; to grow the World Tree, which they named &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;. Teldrassil is not linked to the Dream or to the Well of Eternity. Contrary to Fandral's hopes, the new World Tree has not restored the night elves' immortality.\nGeography.\nLayers.\nThe Emerald Dream also has multiple layers, described by &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt; as different testing versions of Azeroth. These layers were created because the titans invested a great deal of work in perfecting their design of Azeroth, and so, the finished design of the planet was the product of many previous flawed or unfinished models. Each layer represents an abandoned segment or idea that the titans tried and ultimately discarded. Malfurion observed that it looks like neither the &lt;a href=\"Plane\"&gt;mortal plane&lt;/a&gt; nor the Emerald Dream. He saw that one mountain peak lacked its northern face, while another peak looked as if someone had started molding it like clay but had lost interest. These older layers were normally uninhabited, invisible and incomplete, therefore limited in scope, relative to the finalized Dream. But they could be accessed by any who knew how to navigate them.\nIn World of Warcraft.\nClassic.\nMost references to the Emerald Dream in the original version of the game occur in &lt;a href=\"Moonglade\"&gt;Moonglade&lt;/a&gt;, which is the haven for the &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s on Azeroth. The references occur in quests that involve &lt;a href=\"Remulos\"&gt;Keeper Remulos&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Keeper%20of%20the%20grove\"&gt;Keeper of the grove&lt;/a&gt; and the ruler of Moonglade. Likewise, much of the Nightmare's influence upon the Emerald Dream involves the &lt;a href=\"green%20dragonflight\"&gt;green dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, the protectors of the Emerald Dream under the jurisdiction of &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt;.\nOne of the earliest mentions of the green dragonflight's corruption - and thus the Nightmare's influence - was the dragon &lt;a href=\"Eranikus\"&gt;Eranikus&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Atal%27Hakkar\"&gt;Temple of Atal'Hakkar&lt;/a&gt;, a lvl 45-50 &lt;a href=\"dungeon\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt;. The dragon, along with an army of lesser green dragons, had been dispatched by Ysera to take care of the &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s within the temple in the &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20of%20Sorrows\"&gt;Swamp of Sorrows&lt;/a&gt;. There, the trolls attempted to summon &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20the%20Soulflayer\"&gt;Hakkar the Soulflayer&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;-like being. The temple was smashed to bits by the dragons, but they ultimately fell to Hakkar's corruption themselves. The &lt;a href=\"Shade%20of%20Eranikus\"&gt;Shade of Eranikus&lt;/a&gt; is now the final boss within the dungeon. \nA similar result of the Nightmare's corruption can be found in the &lt;a href=\"Wailing%20Caverns\"&gt;Wailing Caverns&lt;/a&gt; where several druids have gone into madness. One of them, &lt;a href=\"Naralex\"&gt;Naralex&lt;/a&gt;, was planning to use the cave to return &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt; to its once lush state, by connecting to the Dream. He was however captured by the Nightmare, and its presence corrupted the creatures within the cave.\nIn &lt;a href=\"patch%201.8.0\"&gt;patch 1.8.0&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20of%20Nightmare\"&gt;Dragons of Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; were also added to the game. These dragons were once the lieutenants of Ysera, protecting the Emerald Dream from evil and whatnot. They have, however, also been corrupted by the Nightmare, twisting their powers and turning the dragons into what they once fought. There were &lt;a href=\"World%20boss%23Dragons%20of%20Nightmare\"&gt;four of them&lt;/a&gt;, each having emerged from one of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Tree\"&gt;four portals&lt;/a&gt; connecting Azeroth to the Emerald Dream. They were found in &lt;a href=\"Duskwood\"&gt;Duskwood&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Grove\"&gt;Twilight Grove&lt;/a&gt;), the &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Seradane\"&gt;Seradane&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Feralas\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Dream%20Bough\"&gt;Dream Bough&lt;/a&gt;), and &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Bough%20Shadow\"&gt;Bough Shadow&lt;/a&gt;). Although the portals are inactive, the dragons could be fought and killed, all of them being &lt;a href=\"World%20boss\"&gt;outdoor raid-bosses&lt;/a&gt;. The Dragons of Nightmare were later removed in \"\" (see &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream%23Cataclysm\"&gt;below&lt;/a&gt;).\nEach of the Dragons of Nightmare also dropped a &lt;a href=\"Nightmare%20Engulfed%20Object\"&gt;Nightmare Engulfed Object&lt;/a&gt;, which came from the Emerald Dream. This item gave a &lt;a href=\"Shrouded%20in%20Nightmare\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt; which requested the player to hand it in to Keeper Remulos. Purifying the object revealed that it was actually the &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%27s%20Signet%20Ring\"&gt;ring&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, who was fighting the Nightmare inside the dream. The &lt;a href=\"Waking%20Legends%23Notes\"&gt;brief dialogue&lt;/a&gt; with Malfurion, who was communicating with Keeper Remulos, implied that the Nightmare did not only corrupt the Emerald Dream but also sought to invade Azeroth.\nThe story behind the Nightmare's corruption of the Emerald Dream was further fueled by the &lt;a href=\"The%20Scepter%20of%20the%20Shifting%20Sands%20quest%20chain\"&gt;Scepter of the Shifting Sands quest chain&lt;/a&gt;, added in &lt;a href=\"patch%201.9.0\"&gt;patch 1.9.0&lt;/a&gt;. Requesting the player to craft &lt;a href=\"The%20Scepter%20of%20the%20Shifting%20Sands\"&gt;The Scepter of the Shifting Sands&lt;/a&gt; in order to open the raid-dungeons &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt;, the player would seek out the &lt;a href=\"red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue&lt;/a&gt; and green &lt;a href=\"dragonflight\"&gt;dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;s to acquire the shards the scepter was made of. The &lt;a href=\"Green%20Scepter%20Shard\"&gt;Green Scepter Shard&lt;/a&gt; focuses on the green dragonflight, combining the fate of Eranikus in the Sunken Temple with the one of the Dragons of Nightmare. \nIt was revealed that Eranikus held the Green Scepter Shard, but would not give it up while under control of the Nightmare. Malfurion Stormrage, again communicating from the dream, sent the player to Keeper Remulos which told that Eranikus had to be summoned and defeated in Moonglade in order to be freed from the Nightmare. To summon him, Keeper Remulos required &lt;a href=\"The%20Nightmare%27s%20Corruption\"&gt;fragments of the Nightmare's corruption&lt;/a&gt;. Three of these fragments dropped from random lesser green dragons which were also found at the Dragons of Nightmare's locations. The fourth one dropped from a &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Corrupter\"&gt;satyr&lt;/a&gt; which preached the Nightmare's power. When Eranikus, having become &lt;a href=\"Eranikus%2C%20Tyrant%20of%20the%20Dream\"&gt;Tyrant of the Dream&lt;/a&gt;, was summoned, he declared that he would destroy both Moonglade and Malfurion. Holding Eranikus back, &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; eventually arrived and cleansed the dragon with the power of &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;. Redeemed and freed from the Nightmare's grasp, Eranikus handed over the shard and returned to the Emerald Dream to fight the Nightmare.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nThe quest chain describes how the Emerald Dream is under assault from outside forces as well, led by an ancient &lt;a href=\"arakkoa\"&gt;arakkoa&lt;/a&gt; spirit called &lt;a href=\"Anzu\"&gt;Anzu&lt;/a&gt;. One of the missions in the quest chain is waking up and protecting &lt;a href=\"Clintar%20Dreamwalker\"&gt;Clintar Dreamwalker&lt;/a&gt; which is sleeping in the &lt;a href=\"Stormrage%20Barrow%20Dens\"&gt;Stormrage Barrow Dens&lt;/a&gt; in Moonglade. Several bizarre plants which likely originate from the Dream can be found here. &lt;a href=\"Phantasmal%20Lash\"&gt;Phantasmal Lash&lt;/a&gt;ers which are suppressed by &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Dreamwarden\"&gt;Cenarion Dreamwarden&lt;/a&gt;s are also seeping out from the Dream.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nSo far, the Emerald Dream can only be visited twice:\nWorld of Warcraft: Stormrage.\nDuring the events of the &lt;a href=\"War%20Against%20the%20Nightmare\"&gt;War Against the Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;, the Emerald Nightmare was almost able to take hold of the whole Emerald Dream and Azeroth at the same time. However, the Nightmare Lord was eventually defeated with the help of a coalition of races, stopping the crisis.\nDespite Xavius' defeat at the hands of Malfurion Stormrage and his allies, the Nightmare was not entirely destroyed following its master's defeat. One small part stubbornly stayed in the &lt;a href=\"Rift%20of%20Aln\"&gt;Rift of Aln&lt;/a&gt;, and Malfurion could only seal off the vicinity around the rift until a time that another war would be in their favor.\nCataclysm.\nThe story around the Emerald Dream was continued in Cataclysm, at a greater degree than in the two past expansions. Much of it is connected to the novel \"&lt;a href=\"Stormrage\"&gt;Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;\", in which the plot happens after \"Wrath of the Lich King\". The novel reveals that the corruption in the Emerald Dream is caused by the former &lt;a href=\"highborne\"&gt;highborne&lt;/a&gt; and later &lt;a href=\"satyr\"&gt;satyr&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Xavius\"&gt;Xavius&lt;/a&gt;, who takes the form of a twisted tree. Upon his defeat, Malfurion senses that the true force between the corruption, and Xavius' master, is nothing less but another Old God. This being reaches into the Dream through the &lt;a href=\"Rift%20of%20Aln\"&gt;Rift of Aln&lt;/a&gt;, from somewhere in Azeroth's deep ocean. The Emerald Dream-events in Cataclysm are a continuation of this story, where it is revealed that the Old God &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt; is responsible for the Emerald Nightmare.\nBecoming a new zone in Cataclysm, Hyjal features several events related to the Dream. With most of the threat in the Dream defeated in the novel, Ysera has entered Azeroth to continue her fight there. She can be found in the game at &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt; where she has taken humanoid form. She asks the player to aid several &lt;a href=\"ancients\"&gt;ancients&lt;/a&gt; who are returning to Azeroth from the Dream. These ancients returning are &lt;a href=\"Aessina\"&gt;Aessina&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Aviana\"&gt;Aviana&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Goldrinn\"&gt;Goldrinn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tortolla\"&gt;Tortolla&lt;/a&gt; and eventually &lt;a href=\"Malorne\"&gt;Malorne&lt;/a&gt;. It is also revealed that &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt;, who in the novel became insane due to the Nightmare's corruption, was afterward moved to the &lt;a href=\"Barrow%20Dens\"&gt;Barrow Dens&lt;/a&gt; in Hyjal. As the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; seeks to capture him, the green dragon &lt;a href=\"Alysra\"&gt;Alysra&lt;/a&gt; asks the player to smuggle him out to her in the quest &lt;a href=\"Through%20the%20Dream\"&gt;Through the Dream&lt;/a&gt;. To avoid the cultists, the player and Fandral escapes the Dens through the Emerald Dream, encountering creatures called &lt;a href=\"Nightmare%20Terror\"&gt;Nightmare Terror&lt;/a&gt;s. Fandral did still join forces with the Twilight's Hammer, though as an ally instead of a prisoner. Seemingly having regained his sanity (and replaced it with a desire for vengeance), he is now the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Flame\"&gt;Druids of the Flame&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Nightmare Dragons were also affected by the Cataclysm. While Emeriss and Lethon were killed in the novel, it did not mention anything about Ysondre nor Taerar. In the game it turns out Ysondre has escaped the corruption and asks the player in the quest &lt;a href=\"Taerar%27s%20Fall\"&gt;Taerar's Fall&lt;/a&gt; to aid her slay Taerar, who is still corrupted. The fight takes place in &lt;a href=\"Feralas\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt;, but on the border to &lt;a href=\"Thousand%20Needles\"&gt;Thousand Needles&lt;/a&gt;. The dragonspawn in the Dream Bough have had their levels reduced, and are no longer elite. The dragonspawn in Shadow Bough have also had their levels lowered, and are also no longer elite, possibly due to the nearby &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt; becoming a low-level area for &lt;a href=\"goblin%20%28playable%29\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s. The &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Grove\"&gt;Twilight Grove&lt;/a&gt; has become a &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"archaeology\"&gt;archaeology&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"dig%20site\"&gt;dig site&lt;/a&gt;, and Seradane has been abandoned.\n&lt;a href=\"Naralex\"&gt;Naralex&lt;/a&gt;, finally having regained from the Nightmare while sleeping in the &lt;a href=\"Wailing%20Caverns\"&gt;Wailing Caverns&lt;/a&gt;, have used his powers to bring life back to the dusty plains outside the caverns. &lt;a href=\"Overgrowth\"&gt;The area&lt;/a&gt; is however suffering from the Emerald Nightmare which is seeping out from the dream.\nDawn of the Aspects.\nDuring a meeting of the &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Accord\"&gt;Wyrmrest Accord&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Merithra\"&gt;Merithra&lt;/a&gt; notes that the Nightmare is stirring within the Rift of Aln and seems to be seeking a new Nightmare Lord to replace &lt;a href=\"Xavius\"&gt;Xavius&lt;/a&gt;. However, Ysera says it is now the duty of the Druids to watch over the Emerald Dream as she has become mortal following the &lt;a href=\"Hour%20of%20Twilight\"&gt;Hour of Twilight&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nThe Emerald Dream is entered by druids to recover artifact weapons &lt;a href=\"Claws%20of%20Ursoc\"&gt;Claws of Ursoc&lt;/a&gt; the staff &lt;a href=\"%3AG%27Hanir%2C%20the%20Mother%20Tree\"&gt;:G'Hanir, the Mother Tree&lt;/a&gt;.\nDruids of the Cenarion Circle gain access to the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dreamway\"&gt;Emerald Dreamway&lt;/a&gt;, through which they can traverse Azeroth via portals.\nThe Emerald Dream corrupted by the Nightmare is entered by the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;class order leaders&lt;/a&gt; in order to defeat Xavius, who has been resurrected and re-allied with the Burning Legion. The Emerald Nightmare has returned in full force and corrupted much of the Dream once again. Upon killing Xavius the Nightmare Lord, the Dream was restored, along with several druid ghosts. Despite this, &lt;a href=\"Remnant%20of%20the%20Void\"&gt;a remnant of the corruption remains&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt an unknown point after this, but before the end of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the Nightmare still threatened the Dream.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nAdventurers enter the Emerald Dream with &lt;a href=\"Merithra\"&gt;Merithra&lt;/a&gt; to save what remains of the &lt;a href=\"green%20dragonflight\"&gt;green dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; after shadows of the Void are on the rise in the Emerald Dream.\nDragoflight.\nAfter the awakening of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Primalists\"&gt;Primalists&lt;/a&gt; (who wanted to scour Azeroth of titanic influence) attacked the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Gardens\"&gt;Emerald Gardens&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to reach the portal to the Dream on the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Bough\"&gt;Ancient Bough&lt;/a&gt;. Merithra did not know why they were after the Dream, but stated that she \"shudder[ed] to think what they wish to do to it\". With the help of their &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt; and adventurer allies, the greens defeated the Primalist leader &lt;a href=\"Koroleth\"&gt;Koroleth&lt;/a&gt; and scattered her forces, making the portal safe once more.\nIn the RPG.\nDescription.\nAlso called Green Dream, it appears to those who travel within it as how &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; would have been if intelligent beings had not altered its surface, such as &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"elf\"&gt;elves&lt;/a&gt;, with the cut forests, farmed prairies, diverted rivers or built cities. It is a vision of the world as a verdant natural paradise. Tranquil forests stretch away in every direction, and rolling hills and majestic mountains mimic Azeroth's landscape.\n&lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and the Emerald Dream are quasi-duplicates of each other \u2014 the Emerald Dream is Azeroth as seen through a magic lens, untouched by the hands of mortals. The mountains are in the same places in both worlds, but where a human metropolis stands in Azeroth, a lush field, vacant of artifice, grows in the Emerald Dream.\nTauren ancestors dwell deep within the Dream.\nAccess.\nThe Emerald Dream can be visited in dreams or in the flesh. Although the &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s enter the plane through their connection with nature, accessing the Emerald Dream via more conventional magic is possible, but the plane's natives do not look kindly upon intruders.\nSome creatures cannot help but dream of the plane and find themselves there without any preparation or conscious intent; these dreaming creatures arrive in the Emerald Dream and often have prophetic and helpful visions. Other creatures intentionally use dreams to reach the Emerald Dream, such as the &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s.\nInhabitants.\nThe entire plane is the dominion of &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt;, the mighty green dragon Aspect, and she and her brood ensure that none despoil this paradise.\nNature is in a perfect balance in the Emerald Dream. Animals of all types inhabit the world, including some that are extinct on Azeroth and subspecies that never got the chance to evolve. Many fey creatures, such as sprites, dryads and keepers of the grove, also roam the Dream. However, it is not only the native inhabitant creatures that roam the Dream. Creatures from Azeroth constantly visit, though they may or may not know it.\nList of races:"}

The aesthetics of the zone are fairly unique, and while several assets were reused in the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dragonshrine\"&gt;Emerald Dragonshrine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stormrage%20Barrow%20Dens\"&gt;Stormrage Barrow Dens&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dreamway\"&gt;Emerald Dreamway&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare instance&lt;/a&gt;, many have not been seen elsewhere.\nDevelopment.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Mark%20Kern\"&gt;Mark Kern&lt;/a&gt;, the Emerald Dream was originally planned to be the place where player characters went upon dying in \"World of Warcraft\". Once there, they could meet characters who had died in the lore and who would give quests that could only be completed in the Emerald Dream. Players could either find a spirit guide to bring them back to the real world or stay in the Dream and complete quests.\nRumors dating back to the early development phase of \"World of Warcraft\" in 2003 suggest that the Emerald Dream was later planned to be added in an 'at that time' future patch or expansion pack as an endgame zone or as a new continent. Newer speculation suggests that the Emerald Dream was originally intended to be an endgame instance, but got scrapped because &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard&lt;/a&gt; wanted it to be the main theme of an expansion. &lt;a href=\"Tigole\"&gt;Tigole&lt;/a&gt; stated in late May 2007 that Blizzard had \"actually done a lot of work on the Emerald Dream but we scrapped what we had for bigger, grander plans.\"\nBlizzard quotes.\nBack before \"World of Warcraft's\" closed beta phase, &lt;a href=\"Tigole\"&gt;Tigole&lt;/a&gt; mentioned interesting details about the Emerald Dream, that seem to support the idea that it would be released.\n&lt;a href=\"Tigole\"&gt;Tigole&lt;/a&gt; on Sat, 06 Dec 2003 06:01:04 PSTActually, we have some pretty cool stuff planned for druids. They will definitely have a link to the Emerald Dream. There's also a zone on the way to the peak of Mount Hyjal called Moonglade that will be very core to druid characters. Our *master of Warcraft lore*, Chris Metzen, is never short on ideas when it comes to the druid class. I was running around the Emerald Dream last Thursday... you guys are in for a treat. The level designers are doing a killer job.\n&lt;a href=\"Tigole\"&gt;Tigole&lt;/a&gt; on Sat, 06 Dec 2003 22:01:05 PSTThe Emerald Dream is shaping up to be extremely cool. We don't want to preview any of that content yet as it is *endgame* and we want some surprises for players. [...] The zone is massive and beautiful. And once the content team is done with it, it will be exceedingly challenging &gt;=]\n&lt;a href=\"Nethaera\"&gt;Nethaera&lt;/a&gt; on Wed, 06 Sep 2006 08:19:20As for the Emerald Dream, there are no plans for anything as of yet but it is a consideration for the future. The Emerald Dream opens up a lot of different opportunities and the Burning Crusade is definitely not going to be the last of the expansion packs. There are many different places and storylines that can be pursued. The story is going to keep growing and as it does so, people will get to experience it.\n&lt;a href=\"Chris%20Metzen\"&gt;Chris Metzen&lt;/a&gt;, November 2013 at &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon\"&gt;BlizzCon&lt;/a&gt; (interview with South Korean videocast PlayersCut)The Emerald Dream is a nice idea and the team has talked about making it into an expansion many times. Building an entire expansion worth of zones around a green lush forest theme would get very boring, so the Emerald Dream would be better used as raid, dungeon, or a subzone, not an entire expansion."}

When the Nightmare spreads, it consumes the life force of all it touches. The more it spreads, the weaker &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt; magic becomes. It is a realm of death, &lt;a href=\"decay\"&gt;decay&lt;/a&gt;, and nightmare.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"War%20Against%20the%20Nightmare\"&gt;War Against the Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;, it was revealed that the Emerald Nightmare was under the rule of a figure known as the Nightmare Lord, who in fact was really &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;'s old nemesis &lt;a href=\"Xavius\"&gt;Xavius&lt;/a&gt;. However, it was also revealed that Xavius himself was a minion of a powerful yet ancient evil, residing in the &lt;a href=\"Rift%20of%20Aln\"&gt;Rift of Aln&lt;/a&gt;, and possibly also beneath Azeroth's oceans. Despite the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Xavius\"&gt;Xavius&lt;/a&gt; and the removal of much of the nightmare through the course of \"&lt;a href=\"Stormrage\"&gt;Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;\", the noting of a still-corrupted area indicates that the Nightmare is still a threat. Its influence is slowly overtaking the forests of &lt;a href=\"Val%27sharah\"&gt;Val'sharah&lt;/a&gt; through the World Tree &lt;a href=\"Shaladrassil\"&gt;Shaladrassil&lt;/a&gt; during the events of \".\nThe Nightmare acts like a heavy shroud, warping reality, altering the perception of all living things, and bending the boundary between reality and dream. None are immune to the Nightmare's corruption, and it has been known to take hold of &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;former Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;demigods&lt;/a&gt; and even &lt;a href=\"Nightmare%20Imp\"&gt;demons&lt;/a&gt;. When a mortal has become corrupted by the nightmare, there is no return. Only death will set them free, although &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;'s power in &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;'s presence has seemingly cleansed or resisted its corruption to varying degrees on several occasions, such as with &lt;a href=\"Eranikus\"&gt;Eranikus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Elothir\"&gt;Elothir&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt;. Once cursed, the nightmare will begin consuming the victim's thoughts and filling their head with the voices of other corrupted beings, even the nearby flora. The curse itself, however, is known to make the victims very, very powerful, rivaling even that of &lt;a href=\"ancient\"&gt;ancient&lt;/a&gt;s.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nThe origins of the Nightmare stretch back to 4,500 years before the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, when a small group of &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s led by &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt; took six branches from &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt;, the World Tree, and planted them over &lt;a href=\"saronite\"&gt;saronite&lt;/a&gt; that had begun to appear across the world. The five first branches grew into &lt;a href=\"Great%20Tree\"&gt;Great Tree&lt;/a&gt;s, while the last and greatest branch\u2014planted over the largest source of saronite in the &lt;a href=\"Grizzly%20Hills\"&gt;Grizzly Hills&lt;/a&gt;\u2014became the World Tree &lt;a href=\"Vordrassil\"&gt;Andrassil&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, Andrassil's roots went deep enough that they touched the prison of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt;, corrupting the tree and spreading madness throughout the nearby wildlife. The druids sorrowfully destroyed the World Tree, believing that this act would halt Yogg-Saron's corruption. What they did not know, however, was that Yogg-Saron had used the trees planted by Fandral as a doorway for the Old Gods to access the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;. The Old Gods spread small seeds of corruption throughout the dreamways, in time these seeds polluted the Dream beginning what would become known as the Emerald Nightmare. While Yogg-Saron was the Old God who opened the Emerald Dream to its brethren, &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt; later became the one who took the most active role in its corruption.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nThe &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Naralex\"&gt;Naralex&lt;/a&gt;'s former acolytes in the &lt;a href=\"Wailing%20Caverns\"&gt;Wailing Caverns&lt;/a&gt; were corrupted by the Nightmare - transformed into the wicked &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Fang\"&gt;Druids of the Fang&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href=\"Naralex\"&gt;Naralex&lt;/a&gt; himself slept, trapped within the Nightmare. The Green Dragon &lt;a href=\"Eranikus\"&gt;Eranikus&lt;/a&gt; was corrupted by the Nightmare. Even &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt;'s most trusted lieutenants (&lt;a href=\"Lethon\"&gt;Lethon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emeriss\"&gt;Emeriss&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Taerar\"&gt;Taerar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ysondre\"&gt;Ysondre&lt;/a&gt;) were &lt;a href=\"Four%20Dragons\"&gt;warped&lt;/a&gt; by this dark power within the Emerald Dream. &lt;a href=\"Malfurion\"&gt;Malfurion&lt;/a&gt; fought at &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;' side against the Nightmare within the dream, but was eventually turned into an &lt;a href=\"Unwaking\"&gt;Unwaking&lt;/a&gt; himself.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Gates%20of%20Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;opening of the Gates of Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Corrupter\"&gt;satyr&lt;/a&gt; which preached the Nightmare's power was situated in Duskwood.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nThe Nightmare found a way into one of the wings of the &lt;a href=\"Stormrage%20Barrow%20Dens\"&gt;Stormrage Barrow Dens&lt;/a&gt; where strange creatures of nightmare suddenly came into the waking world. The &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Dreamwarden\"&gt;Cenarion Dreamwarden&lt;/a&gt; were constantly trying to keep the threat at bay. Plantlife was thriving here, but this was not the case in the Emerald Dream. &lt;a href=\"Clintar%20Dreamwalker\"&gt;Clintar Dreamwalker&lt;/a&gt; could be found asleep in one of the rooms and he was part of the quest chain for &lt;a href=\"Swift%20Flight%20Form\"&gt;Swift Flight Form&lt;/a&gt;. It seems &lt;a href=\"Anzu\"&gt;Anzu&lt;/a&gt; was behind these attacks.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nWhile on the &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt; quest &lt;a href=\"Hope%20Within%20the%20Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Hope Within the Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;, Remulos sends the player into a phased version of a portion of Moonglade to gather .\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Valithria%20Dreamwalker\"&gt;Valithria Dreamwalker&lt;/a&gt; encounter she opens portals to the Nightmare, where the player can find dream clouds.\nStormrage.\nDuring the events of the &lt;a href=\"War%20Against%20the%20Nightmare\"&gt;War Against the Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;, the Emerald Nightmare was almost able to take hold of the whole Emerald Dream and Azeroth at the same time trapping most of the most powerful heroes of the world in sleep reliving their nightmares.\nHowever, the Nightmare Lord was eventually defeated with the help of a coalition of races, stopping the crisis.\nDespite Xavius' defeat at the hands of Malfurion Stormrage and his allies, the Nightmare was not entirely destroyed following its master's defeat. One small part stubbornly stayed in the &lt;a href=\"Rift%20of%20Aln\"&gt;Rift of Aln&lt;/a&gt;, and Malfurion could only seal off the vicinity around the rift until a time that another war would be in their favor. Xavius's spirit was also sealed inside the Rift of Aln.\nCataclysm.\nThe Emerald Nightmare is present in the &lt;a href=\"Nightmare%20Scar\"&gt;Nightmare Scar&lt;/a&gt;, located at the center of the regrown area of &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Barrens\"&gt;Southern Barrens&lt;/a&gt; known as the &lt;a href=\"Overgrowth\"&gt;Overgrowth&lt;/a&gt;. The Nightmare's influence in the Barrens following the Cataclysm suggests that the evil controlling the Nightmare may have taken advantage of the &lt;a href=\"Shattering\"&gt;Shattering&lt;/a&gt; to attempt to infect &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; once again.\n&lt;a href=\"Taerar\"&gt;Taerar&lt;/a&gt; still plagues &lt;a href=\"Feralas\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt; from the portal at &lt;a href=\"Dream%20Bough\"&gt;Dream Bough&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ysondre\"&gt;Ysondre&lt;/a&gt; is trying to stop him for good.\nThe Nightmare is present in the dream around the &lt;a href=\"Hyjal%20Barrow%20Dens\"&gt;Hyjal Barrow Dens&lt;/a&gt;, trying to prevent Fandral Staghelm's transfer out of the prison.\nDawn of the Aspects.\nDuring a meeting of the &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Accord\"&gt;Wyrmrest Accord&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Merithra\"&gt;Merithra&lt;/a&gt; notes that the Nightmare is stirring within the Rift of Aln and seems to be seeking a new Nightmare Lord to replace &lt;a href=\"Xavius\"&gt;Xavius&lt;/a&gt;. However, Ysera says it is now the duty of the druids to watch over the Emerald Dream as she has become mortal following the &lt;a href=\"Hour%20of%20Twilight\"&gt;Hour of Twilight&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nThe Emerald Nightmare is revealed to be still active, with its source being located at the tainted World Tree, &lt;a href=\"Shaladrassil\"&gt;Shaladrassil&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Val%27sharah\"&gt;Val'sharah&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Xavius\"&gt;Xavius&lt;/a&gt; has been revealed to have re-established his ties to the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; and attempts to use the Nightmare to corrupt the world, while his satyr underlings roam the tainted glades of Val'sharah. However, his true loyalties remain with the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAfter Xavius is killed, the Emerald Nightmare begins to dissipate and the Emerald Dream is restored. However, &lt;a href=\"Remnant%20of%20the%20Void\"&gt;a small remnant of void&lt;/a&gt; remains in the form of a flower. A &lt;a href=\"shadow%20priest\"&gt;shadow priest&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Xal%27atath%2C%20Blade%20of%20the%20Black%20Empire\"&gt;Xal'atath, Blade of the Black Empire&lt;/a&gt; will hear it state that the Nightmare was almost completely removed, but that the Rift of Aln is deep and vast and that the Old God's prison is weakening. The Nightmare still holds a grip on areas of the Dream, as seen in the Deaths of Chromie.\nThe Deaths of Chromie.\nAt an undisclosed point in the future, but before the end of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dragonshrine\"&gt;Emerald Dragonshrine&lt;/a&gt; comes under attack by the Nightmare. The satyr &lt;a href=\"Thalas%20Vylethorn\"&gt;Thalas Vylethorn&lt;/a&gt; plots the death of &lt;a href=\"Chronormu\"&gt;Chronormu&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth and aftermath.\nTrue to Xal'atath's words, the Nightmare has survived the death of Xavius, at least in a form. It was most prominently discovered by an Alliance adventurer and the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20Embers\"&gt;Order of Embers&lt;/a&gt; during the investigation into the &lt;a href=\"Drustvar\"&gt;Drustvar&lt;/a&gt; region of &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;. There, the ancient enemies of the Kul Tirans and former rulers of the island, the &lt;a href=\"Drust\"&gt;Drust&lt;/a&gt;, and their king &lt;a href=\"Gorak%20Tul\"&gt;Gorak Tul&lt;/a&gt; were discovered to have survived destruction at the hands of Kul Tirans centuries ago by escaping into a death realm they called '&lt;a href=\"Thros%2C%20the%20Blighted%20Lands\"&gt;Thros, the Blighted Lands&lt;/a&gt;'. Though unknown to them, and to the Alliance, this was, in fact, an off-shoot of the Emerald Nightmare. \nLater, while the Alliance adventurer worked with &lt;a href=\"Katherine%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Katherine Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; to discover &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina's&lt;/a&gt; location, they found that she had been pulled into Thros. Though the two succeeded in freeing her from the dark realm, and fend off Gorak Tul once more, the Blighted Lands appear to still persist.\nAdditionally, during the Alliance and Horde's ongoing struggle over Darkshore, &lt;a href=\"Gren%20Tornfur\"&gt;Gren Tornfur&lt;/a&gt; seems to be wielding the power of the Nightmare in the form witnessed in \"\".\nDuring the fight against &lt;a href=\"Ra-den%20the%20Despoiled\"&gt;Ra-den the Despoiled&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Essence%20of%20Nightmare%20%28Ny%27alotha%29\"&gt;Essences of Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Night%20Terror%20%28Ny%27alotha%29\"&gt;Night Terrors&lt;/a&gt; are fought.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Zekhan\"&gt;Zekhan&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the corruption of the Nightmare has remained in the Wailing Caverns since Naralex's rescue. In his words, the corruption is stronger than any war machine, greed, or blind bravery.\nShadowlands.\nWhile in her &lt;a href=\"wildseed\"&gt;wildseed&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ardenweald\"&gt;Ardenweald&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt; was troubled with nightmares. When the &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Walker\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt;s were working on helping Ysera, nightmare manifestations such as &lt;a href=\"Disturbed%20Nightmare\"&gt;Disturbed Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;s appeared.\nAppearance.\nThe corrupted environment and beings take the colors black, gray, red, and violet in their appearance. The nightmare seems to have a penchant for fleshy and thorny black-red growths; spreading like weeds and vines. It leaves an ichorous purple mist, from which sometimes nightmare lurkers erupt.\nThe nightmare affects the ancients and dragons most prominently. Ancients become withered, their bark turning black with red-hewn streaks within it. The dragons become thin and emaciated with strange red light growths. Their skin becomes shades of black and gray in the case of dragons and whelps. In the case of the drakes, their skin seems to have disappeared, leaving them emaciated black bone and red growth skeletal dragons.\nIn the RPG.\nThe Emerald Nightmare was created using the twisted thoughts and fears of sleeping beings' subconscious minds to corrupt the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;. The Nightmare travels slowly through the Dream, leaving corrupted, vicious animals and Unwaking travelers in its path. Many &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s were called to the Emerald Dream to help fight back its effects. The green dragons did what they could, though they dared not risk becoming themselves corrupted. The &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Ysera\"&gt;Eye of Ysera&lt;/a&gt; had not yet been approached by the Nightmare, but some feared that one day it will.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; is not a place of total perfection. It can be shaped and twisted by dreams, usually without a sleeper's knowledge. Sadly, nightmares are themselves a crafting of the subconscious and have given rise to their own place within the Dream. The Nightmare, as the denizens call it, is not a specific location, but a constantly roaming effect that travels about unpredictably. The skies above the Nightmare are constantly clouded, creating a gloomy, depressing zone that weakens and deadens everything it touches. The beautiful green vegetation is twisted into brown decay, while ordinarily peaceful creatures are corrupted into shadowy, mutated versions of themselves known as &lt;a href=\"Corrupted%20Ones\"&gt;Corrupted Ones&lt;/a&gt;. The Corrupted Ones are vicious and cruel, hunting anything they can, even after they leave the Nightmare's affected zone. \nWorse still, some dream-travelers who enter the Nightmare \u2014 or are engulfed by its movements \u2014 become trapped in the Emerald Dream. They cannot leave, so their bodies back on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; remain in a permanent sleep, slowly starving to death unless tended by helpful aides. While trapped, they are known as the &lt;a href=\"Unwaking\"&gt;Unwaking&lt;/a&gt;; they are also corrupted and will do anything to get back home. The Nightmare is believed to be slowly growing in size and power.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

{"id": "206422", "revid": "38791128", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=206422", "title": "Emerald Void", "text": "Emerald Void is a &lt;a href=\"Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Raids%20achievements\"&gt;dungeon &amp; raids achievement&lt;/a&gt; earned for defeating &lt;a href=\"Ley-Guardian%20Eregos\"&gt;Ley-Guardian Eregos&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Oculus\"&gt;Oculus&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Heroic\"&gt;Heroic&lt;/a&gt; difficulty without anyone in your party using an &lt;a href=\"Ley-Guardian_Eregos%23Drake_Abilities\"&gt;Emerald Drake&lt;/a&gt;.\nStrategies.\nThree amber, 2 ruby.\nIn order to get Emerald Void, you need three Amber Drakes and two Ruby Drakes. All the DPS takes an Amber Drake while the tank and healer take Ruby Drakes.\nThe healer on the Ruby Drake begins the fight over one of the platforms. It is important to not pull &lt;a href=\"Ley-Guardian%20Eregos\"&gt;Ley-Guardian Eregos&lt;/a&gt; off the healer. Once the Ruby Drake dies, the healer should land on a platform and start healing the Ruby Drake that is now tanking Eregos. The three Amber Drakes take turns Time-Stopping on his enrage. It is better to take a holy priest talent spec'd into &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20of%20Redemption\"&gt;Spirit of Redemption&lt;/a&gt; or a Resto Shaman that has an Ankh available because Eregos will hit everyone with Arcane Barrage sometimes killing the healer.\n5 Amber Drakes.\nThis strategy requires perfect group coordination to pull off.\nOne person is designated to start the pull. The other four activate their temporal rifts as Eregos flies past (this will not engage him). The puller hits him twice to begin the encounter, then hits time stop and hits him one more time. At this point the other four drakes should have 8-10 charges on Eregos. Now the puller activates Temporal Rift, and the other four hit him with a single shock lance (which should hit for well over 100k due to their charges). After casting their lance, they return to rifting. At this point the puller has 10 charges (from the other drakes' lances), and casts shock lance himself, which also hits for over 100k, and gives the other four drakes 10 charges. The other four then hit him as the puller rifts. Repeat this pattern until 60%. After the arcane phase, select a new drake to be the \"puller\", and start over again. Eregos dies really fast on this strategy, which is the key, because you have no healing, and no tank to evade attacks.\n-edit-\nYou have to time your time-stops correctly or Eregos will summon whelps that can overwhelm the party. Also, returning to him after Astral shift and timing a time-stop is important or this will ruin coordination and he will summon whelps.\nAnother 5 amber drake strategy.\nEmerald Void\nWe spent a couple of hours, but when we went through the tactic one more time we all got it. Basically you use 5 Bronze Drakes. You'll make a spell rotation using Stop Time, Shock Lance and Temporal Rift.\nSTEP 1\nOnce it reaches 10 stacks, the four players who previously used Shock Lance uses Temporal Rift.\nThe Player 1 will then (when there is 4 Temporal Rifts up) release his Temporal Rift by using his Shock Lance ability. This will do a lot of damage to the boss, and remember - don't release the Temporal Rift before there is 4 Temporal Rifts up, important!\nSTEP 2\nNow keep in mind that you also need a Time Stop rotation.\nWhen Player 1 channels Temporal Rift, he should also use his Time Stop ability after the boss has attacked him once. When STEP 1 is done, you'll change positions. This means;\nDuring or after STEP 2 he'll go into the Void Phase, making him immune to attacks. You are now to fly in a circle to the left around the boss, or away from the boss.\nIt does not matter which way you chose to do it, the only thing that matter is keeping the group stacked and avoiding the Planar Anomalies balls.\nWhen he returns to normal;\nSTEP 3\nSTEP 4\nNow start from the beginning again - Player 1 Time Stop etc.\nNow you got the rotation, simply rinse and repeat. If you do this right you will have zero Whelping adds spawning, which makes this very doable. You might need some tries, but it's worth it."}

These wayward sentinels passed through the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Tree\"&gt;Great Tree&lt;/a&gt;s into &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, intending to spread madness and terror throughout the mortal kingdoms.\nThe mysterious dark power within the Emerald Dream transformed the once-majestic Emeriss into a rotting, diseased monstrosity. Reports from the few who survived encounters with the &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt; told of horrifying tales of putrid mushrooms erupting from the corpses of their dead companions. Emeriss was truly the most gruesome and appalling of Ysera's estranged green dragons.\nStormrage.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"War%20Against%20the%20Nightmare\"&gt;War Against the Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;, Emeriss was one of the major antagonists as a servant of the Nightmare. She and Lethon attacked Eranikus in order to corrupt him, but thanks to &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;, the corrupted dragons were forced to retreat. When Tyrande, Broll, Lucan and Thura were flying on a green dragon in order to leave the Dream, Emeriss attacked them, though the group was able to get to Azeroth. \nEmeriss later returned to battle Tyrande and &lt;a href=\"Malfurion\"&gt;Malfurion&lt;/a&gt;, but Tyrande attempted to remove Emeriss's corruption with the power of &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;. However, the dragon was so far gone that there was nothing left to heal, and she was simply disintegrated. Tyrande remarked that, \"...there was nothing left \"but\" the corruption... and when I tried to heal that... it left only emptiness...\"\nLegion.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Ysondre\"&gt;Ysondre&lt;/a&gt; is taken by the Emerald Nightmare once again, the corrupted spirits of her deceased comrades join her in the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dreamway\"&gt;Emerald Dreamway&lt;/a&gt;, including Emeriss.

{"id": "550816", "revid": "38791128", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=550816", "title": "Emeriss (Classic)", "text": "Emeriss was one of the four &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20of%20Nightmare%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Dragons of Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;. Since &lt;a href=\"WoW%27s%2013th%20Anniversary\"&gt;WoW's 13th Anniversary&lt;/a&gt;, Emeriss is available during the anniversary event.\nOverview.\nEmeriss was one of the Emerald Dragons. The other Emerald Dragons are &lt;a href=\"Lethon\"&gt;Lethon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ysondre\"&gt;Ysondre&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Taerar\"&gt;Taerar&lt;/a&gt;. These dragons are world spawns located in &lt;a href=\"Duskwood\"&gt;Duskwood&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Grove\"&gt;Twilight Grove&lt;/a&gt;), the &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Seradane\"&gt;Seradane&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Feralas\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Dream%20Bough\"&gt;Dream Bough&lt;/a&gt;), and &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Bough%20Shadow\"&gt;Bough Shadow&lt;/a&gt;). They were raid level difficulty. However, some dragons are more challenging than others. Emeriss was considered to be the second hardest. However, this was debatable as the difficulty of &lt;a href=\"Lethon\"&gt;Lethon&lt;/a&gt; largely depended on the quality and experience of one raid member. Emeriss, by comparison, required the attention and focus of all your raid members. The dragon was very easy if everyone did their job well but she would make quick work of your raid if mistakes happened.\nAll four dragons shared the Sleep (summoning \"Dream Fog\"), Noxious Breath, Tail Sweep, Mark of Nature and Aura of Nature abilities. Each dragon also had a few unique abilities. One of these was considered the dragon's ace move, and would be performed when the dragon lost 25 \u00b1 5% of its max life. In other words, the ace move would only be performed three times; when the dragon was at 25%, 50%, and 75% life. When it was performed, the dragon would also yell something.\nNotes.\nCurrently, Emeriss casts Corruption of Earth randomly at +/- 10% of 75%,50%, and 25%. That means that at 85%, 60%, and 35%, the ranged and melee DPS need to run out. Your raid needs Healer groups to stay in at 85,60, and 35%. Have a priest in each of the healer groups and your top dps in groups with priests in them. At the mentioned percentages, have everyone but the people in groups with priests in them run out. When corruption is cast, have the priests spam prayer of healing on their groups. Make sure that the people in the groups stay close enough to the priest, but spread out just enough to avoid getting the priest chain slept. Smart priests that know how to avoid the sleep clouds are key to this strategy. Nature resists apparently also help resist the sleep clouds.\nThis is also a world boss, keep in mind that her difficulty will change, pending on the levels of the raid, thus again, making her a lot more difficult than she seems.\nTrivia.\nWhen the dragons were released to the game, it was possible to counter Emeriss' Corruption of the Earth-spell with the device &lt;a href=\"Ultra-Flash%20Shadow%20Reflector\"&gt;Ultra-Flash Shadow Reflector&lt;/a&gt;. This would cause the spell to be reflected, forcing Emeriss to kill herself within few seconds. The glitch was rapidly patched the week after when Blizzard had become aware of it."}

At least three of them appeared in ' and '.\n&lt;a href=\"Dissension\"&gt;Dissension&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpon arriving in the Alliance base in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, the Alliance Emissary was greeted by &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Luc%20Valonforth\"&gt;Captain Luc Valonforth&lt;/a&gt; who informed him that the prince was away on a mission and would return shortly. Alliance Emissary was sent by King &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;Terenas Menethil II&lt;/a&gt; to have his son Prince &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; come back to &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; with his forces and to have them give up the hunt for the &lt;a href=\"dreadlord\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mal%27Ganis\"&gt;Mal'Ganis&lt;/a&gt;, after Lord &lt;a href=\"Uther\"&gt;Uther&lt;/a&gt; persuaded the king to do this.

Arthas interrogates his prisoner concerning entry to the inner kingdom. The stubborn high elf insists that the \"fallen prince\" will not be able to enter their land, citing that not only their gates will protect their capital, but the enchanted forests as well.\nSaid prisoner is labeled as \"priest\" in the cutscene, but uses the emissary model.\n&lt;a href=\"A%20Dark%20Covenant\"&gt;A Dark Covenant&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt; repaired three observatories, Lord &lt;a href=\"Garithos\"&gt;Garithos&lt;/a&gt; took his forces to battle the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; and left Kael awaiting orders. The next day, an emissary arrived bringing news from Grand Marshal Garithos. The message said that the observatories Kael had repaired detected a large undead force led by &lt;a href=\"Dalvengyr\"&gt;Dalvengyr&lt;/a&gt;, and that he had to crush them before they could march on &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;. Kael was too confident that his forces would defeat Dalvengyr easily, unfortunately, Lord Garithos also ordered all foot soldiers, cavalry, and support teams to meet him in the front lines, leaving only the blood elves. Kael demanded the actions of Lord Garithos, but the emissary just replied that Garithos had great confidence in Kael's \"abilities\" and wished him luck saying \"be creative\".\n&lt;a href=\"To%20Tame%20a%20Land\"&gt;To Tame a Land&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"The%20Founding%20of%20Durotar\"&gt;The Founding of Durotar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; received a letter from the human leader to meet in &lt;a href=\"Razor%20Hill\"&gt;Razor Hill&lt;/a&gt;. Rexxar was informed and suspected a trap, so he went in the place of Thrall, yet when he arrived he did not meet the human leader and instead found an emissary. The emissary was surprised to see a &lt;a href=\"half-ogre\"&gt;half-ogre&lt;/a&gt; instead of the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt;. He revealed to Rexxar that he wanted to kill the warchief but would settle with killing Rexxar. As Rexxar suspected, it was an ambush from &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;, but he had brought with him &lt;a href=\"Misha\"&gt;Misha&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rokhan\"&gt;Rokhan&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Chen%20Stormstout\"&gt;Chen Stormstout&lt;/a&gt;. They fought back and killed the humans. With his last strength, the emissary told Rexxar that it was only the beginning of a greater invasion, dying moments later."}

This has perhaps led to her hatred of the Alliance. \nThe Blank Scroll.\nZiya was assigned a &lt;a href=\"plundersquad\"&gt;plundersquad&lt;/a&gt;, and ordered to raid &lt;a href=\"Pandaren\"&gt;Pandaren&lt;/a&gt; treasuries, temples, and armories for valuables and weapons to fuel the Horde war machine. Her squad was whittled down to &lt;a href=\"Arko\"&gt;Arko&lt;/a&gt;, an inexperienced goblin mage. \nSpending the night on the chilly northern shore of &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, Arko asked Ziya to tell him a story. Ziya chose the tale of &lt;a href=\"Rakalaz\"&gt;Rakalaz&lt;/a&gt;. She did not get very far before the infamous monster exploded through the sand and attacked the two goblins, exposing the doors to a &lt;a href=\"Lorevault\"&gt;Lorevault&lt;/a&gt; in the cliff behind them. After sending a distress call to Trade Prince Gallywix's &lt;a href=\"uberzeppelin\"&gt;uberzeppelin&lt;/a&gt;, Arko fled, and Ziya was rescued by &lt;a href=\"Lorewalker%20Shuchun\"&gt;Lorewalker Shuchun&lt;/a&gt;. \n&lt;a href=\"Druz\"&gt;Druz&lt;/a&gt;, Gallywix's chief enforcer, arrived and claimed the Lorevault for the Bilgewater Cartel. Ziya insisted on a finder's fee for the discovery, and Lorewalker Shuchun refused to allow either goblin into the Lorevault without her. The three companions entered the large golden doors. \nAs they faced various challenges based on Pandaren legend, Druz and Ziya argued over the purpose of the war against the alliance, the true nature of Trade Prince Gallywix, and the danger of seeking simple answers to complex problems, eventually realizing that their arguments were actually creating the traps. The source of these creations turned out to be a dangerous Pandaren artifact: &lt;a href=\"The_Blank_Scroll_%28item%29\"&gt;the Blank Scroll&lt;/a&gt;\nDruz and Ziya attempted to claim the scroll. Realizing that her warnings were going unheeded, Lorewalker Shuchun activated the scroll, and showed the goblins a vision of a terrible future: the Bilgewater Cartel goblins were declared traitors to the Horde for hiding a powerful weapon from Warchief &lt;a href=\"Garrosh\"&gt;Garrosh&lt;/a&gt; Hellscream. the \"&lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt;\", &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; were destroyed by the orcs, and &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; itself was devastated by the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; and horrors from the sea.\nStunned by what they had seen, Druz and Ziya decided to leave the Blank Scroll in Lorewalker Shuchun's hands. Druz gave Ziya some paid time off to escort Lorewalker Shuchun \"where she needs to go\". Ziya found she was grateful for some respite from the war she had fought for years."}

He was banished thanks to the combined efforts of &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nConfrontation with Aegwynn.\nOn the &lt;a href=\"world\"&gt;world&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, at the very start of &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt;'s tenure as &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardian of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt;, Zmodlor appeared and started a &lt;a href=\"cult\"&gt;cult&lt;/a&gt; called the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Blade%20clan\"&gt;Burning Blade&lt;/a&gt;. Zmodlor's cultists took over the &lt;a href=\"school\"&gt;school&lt;/a&gt;house of the village &lt;a href=\"Jortas\"&gt;Jortas&lt;/a&gt;, planning to sacrifice its children using a sword covered in oil and set alight as a ritual tool. Aegwynn appeared just in time to save the children and neutralize Zmodlor, with the event being her first ever demon banishment.\nZmodlor's return.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, Zmodlor was among the demons summoned to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. One of many demons who survived the war, Zmodlor sought to destroy the fragile peace between &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt;.\nZmodlor recruited both orcs and humans who were prejudiced against one another into a new incarnation of the Burning Blade cult, promising each that he was only interested in helping them destroy the other. None of his minions were aware that he was also recruiting among their enemies. Among the members of Zmodlor's Burning Blade were &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;'s chamberlain, &lt;a href=\"Kristoff%20%28human%29\"&gt;Kristoff&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Burx\"&gt;Burx&lt;/a&gt;, one of &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;'s chief warriors. Another was the human &lt;a href=\"Margoz%20%28human%29\"&gt;Margoz&lt;/a&gt;, who recruited new members in the &lt;a href=\"Demonsbane%20Inn\"&gt;Demonsbane Inn&lt;/a&gt; in Theramore. When the soldier &lt;a href=\"Strov\"&gt;Strov&lt;/a&gt; followed Margoz from the inn to investigate, Zmodlor slew him. Zmodlor later cast protective wards to trap Jaina and Aegwynn in &lt;a href=\"Bladescar\"&gt;Bladescar&lt;/a&gt; to prevent them from interfering.\nZmodlor's plan nearly succeeded, and a battle had already broken out at &lt;a href=\"Northwatch%20Hold\"&gt;Northwatch Hold&lt;/a&gt; before Jaina was able to discover Zmodlor's hideout atop &lt;a href=\"Dreadmist%20Peak\"&gt;Dreadmist Peak&lt;/a&gt;. Jaina and Aegwynn confronted Zmodlor and several of his &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s, and they were able to banish him to the Twisting Nether yet again.\nAegwynn did not believe that Zmodlor was acting on his own in using the Burning Blade to inflame violence between Orgrimmar and Theramore, telling Jaina that \"a plan of this complexity is far beyond him\". The identity of Zmodlor's master remained a mystery.\nWhile speaking with Thrall following these events, Jaina stated that the Burning Legion would have a hard time rescuing Zmodlor a second time and that because he is a minor demon it would not be worth the effort.\nSpeculation.\nBurning Blade clan.\nIt is unsure if the backstory referred to in \"&lt;a href=\"Cycle%20of%20Hatred\"&gt;Cycle of Hatred&lt;/a&gt;\" is still canon, with the book implying that Zmodlor was somehow responsible for the creation of the Draenic Burning Blade clan after having already created a human cult of the same name on Azeroth centuries ago.\nZmodlor's master.\nThough it was never hinted beyond Zmodlor's master being smarter, it is reasonable to assume that the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Felwood\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt; was ultimately responsible for the plan because the Burning Blade is part of the Shadow Council. \nZmodlor's race.\nCycles of Hatred never specifically states what kind of demon Zmodlor is, but he is described as a massive and hideous demon with leathery skin, &lt;a href=\"bat\"&gt;bat&lt;/a&gt; wings, and flaming eyes.\n&lt;a href=\"Nathrezim\"&gt;Nathrezim&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"doomguard\"&gt;doomguard&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"annihilan\"&gt;annihilan&lt;/a&gt; all fit this description, though nathrezim and annihilan are rarely described as \"minor\" demons as Zmodlor is. Zmodlor's work also involved a lot of subterfuge, which is generally considered to be the specialty of the nathrezim, but Aegwynn did state that he did not have the intelligence to come up with the scheme on his own."}

Most common zombies are &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s, but &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"high%20elf\"&gt;high elven&lt;/a&gt; zombies have also been encountered.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20Invasion\"&gt;Scourge Invasion&lt;/a&gt;, adventurers could be &lt;a href=\"Zombie%20Infestation\"&gt;transformed&lt;/a&gt; into zombies. Others were tasked with bringing back the &lt;a href=\"Dual-Plagued%20Brain\"&gt;brain of a zombie&lt;/a&gt; for study.\n&lt;a href=\"Plague%20eruptor\"&gt;Plague eruptor&lt;/a&gt;s are a type of powerful zombies, designed to spread horror and chaos across the world of the living.\nBackground.\nLike ghouls, zombies were once men, peasants, and warriors alike. They lack a lot of the intelligence their risen comrades do, even in comparison to &lt;a href=\"abomination\"&gt;abomination&lt;/a&gt;s. Slow moving and instinctual, you can find these creatures within the areas either once or still under &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; control.\nZombies, due to their lack of intelligence and their numbers, are often used as fodder in the front lines of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. Most do not seem to be affiliated with any group and just mindlessly wander. \nSome Zombies have managed to be part of the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; and seem to have rational thought.\nZombies can be found most notably in &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Western Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Eastern Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nBackground.\nZombies are nothing more than animated corpses. Zombies are often brought to horrifying unlife to serve as frontline troops for the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;'s armies. Zombies are often plague carriers, infested with all manner of parasitic creatures. Their bodies are in a suspended state of decay, their flesh perpetually sloughing away or peeling aside to reveal bone and desiccated organs. Of all the undead, zombies are one of the more horrific varieties, for their lack of free will is all the more apparent in their pitiable state of their bodies. Even more horrible is the fact that not all zombies lose their memories and personalities \u2014 a few zombies retain their memories, trapped within a decaying corpse compelled to serve their former enemies. Every so often, a zombie retains its intellect or develops a form of sentience over long years. No one has been able to create this circumstance intentionally, nor does anyone understand why or how it happens.\nZombies are the lowest form of existence in the undead food chain and are often overlooked because of their simplicity and lack of ambition. These undead are created from plague-infected individuals, but their bodies are not as riddled with the disease as those of more powerful undead. In fact, zombies not only retain their mortal memories, but also are occasionally capable of retaining the original personality and morality of their mortal life. This does not often aid them, however, and usually is a torment to the zombie trapped within Ner'zhul's vicious armies. Zombies are despicable, degraded creatures with little purpose other than to serve as cannon fodder for Ner'zhul's massive forces. They are sorrowful creatures, capable of great strength but holding little hope for salvation other than their own deaths. Occasionally, one breaks free of the necromantic control imposed by Ner'zhul's forces and escapes \u2014 but he is not accepted into society nor offered a chance for peace through proving that he is more than a ravening undead creatures. Truly, these are beings to be pitied. They speak &lt;a href=\"Low%20Common\"&gt;Low Common&lt;/a&gt;.\nHuman zombies.\nZombies are corpses animated by necromancy. The creature was once human, but now stares ahead with dull, lifeless eyes. Bits and pieces of dead flesh hang from its body as the walking corpse slowly plods forward. Most zombies have no memories of their lives and are capable only of obeying simple commands, such as \u201cAttack!\u201d or \u201cMarch!\u201d Their unthinking obedience makes them perfect tools for frontline assaults, for their plodding onslaught is both demoralizing and relentless. Rumors say that not all zombies are so lucky as to have no memories. Some retain full knowledge of their pre-death identities as well as their knowledge and skills. These memories do them no good, however, for they remain under the control of the Scourge, forced to obey their masters' commands and to suffer their existence within their own decaying corpse. These creatures are objects of pity, but no less dangerous than their mindless fellows. Zombies without memories have no speech, though they can make meaningless sounds. Intelligent zombies know the same languages they did in life and can sometimes manage halting speech.\nA zombie's approach to combat is simple: It attacks whatever enemy it is ordered to attack and does not stop until it is destroyed. Some zombies use weapons (such as &lt;a href=\"club\"&gt;club&lt;/a&gt;s) if they have them. If not, they use their slam attack. Zombies neither attempt to dodge nor do they retreat.\n&lt;a href=\"Gehennis\"&gt;Gehennis&lt;/a&gt; is a zombified female human &lt;a href=\"barbarian\"&gt;barbarian&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Zombie\" is an acquired template in the \"&lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20RPG\"&gt;Warcraft RPG&lt;/a&gt;\"."}

They cannot use their usual abilities or spells, but gain access to new, unique zombie abilities (see below). Player Zombies can infect other players and NPCs, and can communicate with other player Zombies regardless of faction.\nNPCs which are killed, or die from the disease, also come back as &lt;a href=\"Plague%20Zombie\"&gt;Plague Zombie&lt;/a&gt;s and have their level reduced to the next level divisible by 10. So the 75 city guards become 70, the 65 town guards become 60, except that mobs less than 10 become 1st level.\nFAQ.\nFrom 0.

However, more can be found in the mini gauntlet after &lt;a href=\"Chrono-Lord%20Epoch\"&gt;Chrono-Lord Epoch&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith the massive changes to this instance with the 4.0 Patch, it would seem near impossible to accomplish this achievement with a purely random group. Although some modifications could be made depending on group composition, it's very much still achievable.\nThe first nine waves should be treated as normal, with disregard to killing as many zombies as needed to make it through the instance. Upon the spawning of Salramm the Flesh-Crafter, all DPS should run to the cast-iron gate west of the entrance to the inn where Arthas first fights the Infinite Dragonflight. The tank and healer should run to Salramm and pull him to the DPS, at the gate. Hold Salramm at the gate for two minutes, attempting to do as little damage to Salramm as possible, and to single target down every add. Leave zombies alive. After two minutes have passed, burn down Salramm, and hug the left wall into the inn. Proceed through the instance, until Chrono-Lord Epoch is defeated. At this point, split the group into two groups: 1) A healer and a DPS; 2) Everyone else. The healer should run through the first half of the dungeon, and pick up all 85 zombies, while the second group moves with Arthas to the clearing, but the second group should NOT start the gauntlet. The first group should finish up gathering zombies, and begin AoE'ing, at the same time the second group pushes into the gauntlet, killing as many zombies as possible - at least 15.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

This means that players can spend almost the entirety of a character's leveling journey in the same expansion, allowing them to experience stories more fully than with the &lt;a href=\"%23Previous%20versions\"&gt;previous system&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe below list shows zones' default level ranges. Timewalking Campaigns increase these ranges' upper limits to 50.\nExpansion summary.\nGenerally speaking, zones have a maximum level they scale to based on which expansion they are set in, and a minimum level they scale to based on how far into the expansion characters are expected to reach that zone. Dungeons follow this trend as well. All of the maximums instead go to 50 when in a &lt;a href=\"Timewalking%20Campaigns\"&gt;Timewalking Campaigns&lt;/a&gt;. Some starting zones are exceptions to this rule.\nThe minimum scaling level, or \"level requirement\", varies within each expansion. For most expansions, the zone encountered first has a minimum level of 10, while the final leveling zone typically has a minimum 5 levels below the maximum for the expansion, with intermediate zones' minimums distributed in between, often in increments of 5. Dungeons follow a similar pattern, while some end-of-expansion content has a level equal to the maximum for the expansion and does not scale. Exceptions include:\nPrevious versions.\nAs of &lt;a href=\"patch%208.2.5\"&gt;patch 8.2.5&lt;/a&gt;, most content was scaled based on the following level bands:\nBetween &lt;a href=\"patch%207.3.5\"&gt;patch 7.3.5&lt;/a&gt; and patch 8.2.5, starting zones had their own band, which spanned levels 1 - 20. Only a few &lt;a href=\"instance\"&gt;instance&lt;/a&gt;d starting zones (such as &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28starting%20zone%29\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;) retained this level band after 8.2.5."}

The damned souls who arrived in the realm were tortured and twisted by the Jailer until they willingly served him for eternity as his &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt; soldiers.\nAges ago, Zovaal was known as &lt;a href=\"Arbiter%20%28title%29\"&gt;the Arbiter&lt;/a&gt;, responsible for judging the souls that entered the afterlife. However, he later tried to upset the balance of the cosmos in the belief that the &lt;a href=\"First%20Ones\"&gt;First Ones&lt;/a&gt;' creation was flawed and unable to stand against a coming threat that he had foreseen. He tried to claim the &lt;a href=\"sigil\"&gt;sigil&lt;/a&gt;s of his fellow Eternal Ones, intending to use them to reach the &lt;a href=\"Sepulcher%20of%20the%20First%20Ones\"&gt;Sepulcher&lt;/a&gt; in the First Ones' realm of &lt;a href=\"Zereth%20Mortis\"&gt;Zereth Mortis&lt;/a&gt;, whose secrets would allow him to unmake reality and replace it with one in which all would serve him. As punishment for trying to steal their sigils, his counterparts stripped him of his power, used the newly-created magic of Domination to imprison him in the Maw, and created a &lt;a href=\"Arbiter\"&gt;new Arbiter&lt;/a&gt; to replace him.\nDuring his ages of imprisonment, the Jailer learned to harness the Domination used to bind him and continued scheming and working with various allies in both the Shadowlands and the world of the living, such as the &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt;, all with the unchanged goal of reaching the Sepulcher. He set his sights on the mortal world of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and intended to use the power of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28titan%29\"&gt;its world-soul&lt;/a&gt; in the rewriting of reality. He imprisoned one of his brothers, the &lt;a href=\"Primus\"&gt;Primus&lt;/a&gt;, and used him to create the &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Helm of Domination&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt;\u2014instruments that the nathrezim then gave to the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, an entity whom Zovaal intended to use as a herald that would allow him to reach Azeroth. However, this purpose was rejected by &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;all&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;three&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;mortals&lt;/a&gt; who came to bear the title of Lich King.\nThe Jailer later instead allied with &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; and convinced her that his end goal was to tear down the unfair system of Life and Death and replace it with one in which everyone would have true freedom. Not long thereafter, a plot by the nathrezim resulted in the Arbiter falling dormant. All souls who entered the Shadowlands instead began pouring into the Maw, empowering the Jailer while the rest of the Shadowlands grew isolated and withered from a lack of &lt;a href=\"anima\"&gt;anima&lt;/a&gt;. Zovaal's allies\u2014including the &lt;a href=\"Forsworn\"&gt;Forsworn&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Bastion\"&gt;Bastion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxus\"&gt;Maldraxxus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mueh%27zala\"&gt;Mueh'zala&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ardenweald\"&gt;Ardenweald&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sire%20Denathrius\"&gt;Sire Denathrius&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Revendreth\"&gt;Revendreth&lt;/a&gt;\u2014took advantage of the drought to sow chaos among the most important afterlives and the &lt;a href=\"covenant\"&gt;covenant&lt;/a&gt;s that ruled them in order to prevent them from unifying against the Jailer. On Azeroth, Sylvanas destroyed the Helm of Domination, opening a rift between the mortal world and the Shadowlands, and brought several leaders of Azeroth into the Jailer's hands; he used the power of Domination to turn one, &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, into his unwilling champion.\nAlthough &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s of Azeroth\u2014dubbed &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Walker\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt;s\u2014entered the Shadowlands and helped strengthen and reunite the covenants, they were unable to stop the Jailer from obtaining the sigils of the other Eternal Ones. With Sylvanas' aid, he attacked &lt;a href=\"Oribos\"&gt;Oribos&lt;/a&gt; itself, the home of the Arbiter, and claimed the final sigil\u2014his own\u2014from her. Sylvanas turned against him upon realizing his true motives, but he discarded her and used the sigils to escape with Anduin through a portal to Zereth Mortis. The Maw Walkers pursued him and, after freeing Anduin and &lt;a href=\"Crown%20of%20Wills\"&gt;building up a resistance&lt;/a&gt; to his Domination magic, managed to confront and destroy Zovaal in the heart of the Sepulcher of the First Ones before he could complete his plan of harnessing Azeroth's life force to unmake existence.\nZovaal is the main antagonist and final boss of \"\".\nBiography.\nAncient times.\nBinding of the Banished One.\nThe Jailer was an evil older than reality itself. Along with his fellow &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Ones\"&gt;Eternal Ones&lt;/a&gt;, Zovaal was created by the &lt;a href=\"First%20Ones\"&gt;First Ones&lt;/a&gt; in their realm of &lt;a href=\"Zereth%20Mortis\"&gt;Zereth Mortis&lt;/a&gt; and given life in the &lt;a href=\"Crypts%20of%20the%20Eternal\"&gt;Crypts of the Eternal&lt;/a&gt;. He was given the position of &lt;a href=\"Arbiter%20%28title%29\"&gt;Arbiter&lt;/a&gt;, responsible for judging mortal souls entering the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt; and assigning them to appropriate afterlives, and he and each of his siblings were granted &lt;a href=\"sigil\"&gt;sigil&lt;/a&gt;s symbolizing their &lt;a href=\"covenant\"&gt;covenant&lt;/a&gt;s' purpose. The First Ones forbade the Eternal Ones from returning to Zereth Mortis.\nHowever, at some point, Zovaal came to believe that the designs of the First Ones were flawed and that the divided cosmos they had created would not be able to survive an unknown threat that he foresaw coming in the future. According to what he much later told &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, his role as Arbiter also meant witnessing the lives of countless mortals whose existence had been defined not by their own choices, but by the whims of fate and outside circumstances. He saw the same battle for freedom and control play out time and again over the eons, but this was all for naught, as\u2014in Zovaal's words\u2014the idea of anyone truly having free will was only a lie perpetrated by the First Ones. He also noticed that out of all the souls he judged, those who came from the world of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; had the greatest potential and strongest wills. Zovaal came to believe that the Eternal Ones' sigils were keys to forbidden knowledge locked within Zereth Mortis' &lt;a href=\"Sepulcher%20of%20the%20First%20Ones\"&gt;Sepulcher of the First Ones&lt;/a&gt; that he could use to destroy the current reality and its \"flawed cycle\" and instead forge a new, united cosmos dominated under his will, where all would be forced to serve him. When his siblings rebuked his heresy, he tried to claim their sigils by force.\nZovaal was so powerful that it required all of the Pantheon of Death to unite in order to defeat him, but in the end, the &lt;a href=\"Primus\"&gt;Primus&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxus\"&gt;Maldraxxus&lt;/a&gt; led them to victory. The pantheon placed Zovaal on trial in &lt;a href=\"Oribos\"&gt;Oribos&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Kyrestia%20the%20Firstborne\"&gt;Kyrestia the Firstborne&lt;/a&gt; pronounced him guilty of betraying his duty as Arbiter, and the &lt;a href=\"Winter%20Queen\"&gt;Winter Queen&lt;/a&gt; declared that he had threatened the entire cycle of Life and Death, whereas &lt;a href=\"Denathrius\"&gt;Sire Denathrius&lt;/a&gt; ambiguously told Zovaal that he could have chosen another way and that they could've accomplished great things together. When the Primus asked him for the reason for his betrayal, Zovaal replied that the Eternal Ones were merely preserving a cosmos that was doomed.\nAs punishment for his treachery, the Eternal Ones decided to banish Zovaal to the inescapable &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt;, where he would forevermore be its Jailer. They stripped him of his &lt;a href=\"anima\"&gt;anima&lt;/a&gt; and his sigil\u2014leaving a gaping hole at the center of his chest\u2014and used them to create a &lt;a href=\"Arbiter\"&gt;new Arbiter&lt;/a&gt; to judge souls in his place. According to Zovaal himself, he was \"torn in two\" and left feeling eternally incomplete. &lt;a href=\"Mal%27Ganis\"&gt;Mal'Ganis&lt;/a&gt; later described the Arbiter and Zovaal as \"two parts of a whole\".\nIn order to lock Zovaal away within his prison, the Primus created an entirely new system of magic, the language of &lt;a href=\"Domination\"&gt;Domination&lt;/a&gt;, and used its runes to carve the sentence of the Eternal Ones into his brother's flesh. The magic within the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20the%20Forest\"&gt;Heart of the Forest&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ardenweald\"&gt;Ardenweald&lt;/a&gt; was used to keep the Maw inescapable and ensure that Zovaal would remain bound forever. With these measures, the Pantheon of Death believed Zovaal's confinement to be \"absolute and irrevocable\".\nReign in the Maw.\nThe Primus hoped that eons of imprisonment might cause Zovaal to repent for his sins. Instead, they only caused him to grow more malevolent, and he never gave up his goal of reclaiming the power that had been \"stolen\" from him and seeing his schemes through to their end. Though it took him countless eons, the Jailer eventually gathered enough strength to break his chains. After countless more, he found a way to weaponize the power of Domination and use it against his enemies. Unbeknownst to the other Eternal Ones, Zovaal did not act alone in his original betrayal; he had a group of like-minded allies who continued acting on his behalf after his imprisonment and have influenced various events on the mortal plane throughout history.\nOne of them was his fellow Eternal One Denathrius, ruler of &lt;a href=\"Revendreth\"&gt;Revendreth&lt;/a&gt;, who willingly gave his sigil to the Jailer at some point. Denathrius also created a race of master spies, the &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt;, to infiltrate the other cosmic forces and spread the influence of Death. Many nathrezim ended up pretending to serve the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. As part of a \"gambit\" by the Jailer, they convinced the Legion's ruler &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; to let them corrupt the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20%28titan%29\"&gt;titan world-soul&lt;/a&gt; of the planet &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt; with Death magic to turn him into a resurrection engine for the Legion's armies. In this way, they ensured that if Argus was killed, his Death-corrupted soul would travel to Oribos and slam into the new Arbiter, rendering her dormant.\nAnother ally of the Jailer was the &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mueh%27zala\"&gt;Mueh'zala&lt;/a&gt;, who made a pact with the &lt;a href=\"keeper\"&gt;titanic keeper&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Odyn\"&gt;Odyn&lt;/a&gt;, claiming one of his eyes in exchange for giving him the ability to gaze into the Shadowlands. This led to Odyn creating the &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt; as an imitation of the Shadowlands' &lt;a href=\"kyrian\"&gt;kyrian&lt;/a&gt;. Mueh'zala gave Odyn's eye to the Jailer, who twisted it into the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;Eye of the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, an instrument allowing him to see all that transpires within the Maw and possibly other realms as well. At some point, Mueh'zala also brought the first Val'kyr &lt;a href=\"Helya\"&gt;Helya&lt;/a&gt; to the Jailer's side.\nAt one point, the souls of four wicked giants\u2014&lt;a href=\"Chain%20of%20Bahmethra\"&gt;Bahmethra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bracer%20of%20Hrestimorak\"&gt;Hrestimorak&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nilganihmaht%20Control%20Ring\"&gt;Nilganihmaht&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Bracelet%20of%20Salaranga\"&gt;Salaranga&lt;/a&gt;\u2014were damned to the Maw. The Jailer was pleased by the long list of crimes they'd committed in life, bound their souls in armor, and elevated them to become his chosen torturers. However, the four secretly set out to usurp him by building an army of their own. The Eye of the Jailer discovered their plot, and when the giants attacked, the Jailer defeated them one by one. Instead of simply destroying their souls, he claimed a hand from each and condemned their broken souls to the river forever. He then asked his chronicler &lt;a href=\"Varithoman\"&gt;Varithoman&lt;/a&gt; to make a record of the giants' crimes and how they had been punished, as a reminder to others that it is folly to defy the Banished One.\nOver time, the tale of the Jailer's imprisonment became a legend passed down only in whispers among denizens of the Shadowlands. He became known as a \"bogeyman\" figure, and the mere mention of his name was said to hold dark power. Even the &lt;a href=\"attendant\"&gt;attendant&lt;/a&gt;s' detailed records in Oribos contained only oblique references to the events surrounding his banishment. In fact, for most of the Shadowlands' known history, there was very little evidence to show that the Jailer even existed, let alone what he looked like or what his purpose was beyond overseeing the souls condemned to the Maw, since nothing that entered the realm could escape and tell the tale. The attendants of Oribos were unaware that the Jailer had once been the Arbiter and incorrectly believed that the artificial Arbiter that they served was the original one created by the First Ones themselves. However, there are still some very ancient and worn records that reference a time when the Arbiter was \"not quite so benevolent\", implying that they're remnants from the time when Zovaal was the Arbiter. It was said among the attendants that the Jailer was filled with hatred for the Arbiter, and &lt;a href=\"Tal-Inara\"&gt;Tal-Inara&lt;/a&gt; believed that if he struck her down, it would mean the end of everything the First Ones made.\nThe vessels of Domination.\nAt some point, the Primus noticed that the Jailer's influence was seeping outside of the Maw and left Maldraxxus to investigate the matter. Before leaving, he left behind a warning message in &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20the%20Primus\"&gt;his sanctum&lt;/a&gt; telling his fellow Eternal Ones that they had to see to their defenses, that Zovaal must not reach the Sepulcher, and that all would be lost if the Arbiter was not protected. He then traveled to the city of &lt;a href=\"Korthia\"&gt;Korthia&lt;/a&gt;, entrusted his sigil to the &lt;a href=\"attendant\"&gt;attendant&lt;/a&gt;s there, and bound it with the &lt;a href=\"magic%20of%20memory\"&gt;magic of memory&lt;/a&gt;, which he hoped that not even Zovaal could untangle. Once he arrived in the Maw, the Primus' suspicions proved true: the Jailer, having forged his chains into a weapon, brought about his brother's defeat. In a reversal of the way the Primus had once imprisoned him, the Jailer stripped him of his memories and turned him into a broken prisoner called the &lt;a href=\"Runecarver\"&gt;Runecarver&lt;/a&gt; deep within &lt;a href=\"Torghast%2C%20Tower%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Torghast&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Jailer extracted countless designs to use for his &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt; army from the Runecarver's mind, the most notable of which were the designs for the &lt;a href=\"mourneblade\"&gt;mourneblade&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Helm of Domination&lt;/a&gt;. Zovaal had concluded that the power of the &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28titan%29\"&gt;immensely powerful world-soul&lt;/a&gt; slumbering within &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; would be the key to his plan of eradicating reality and he intended for the blade and the helm\u2014the \"vessels of &lt;a href=\"Domination\"&gt;Domination&lt;/a&gt;\"\u2014to be a way of establishing his influence on the planet so that he could claim his final prize, \"the secret that the First Ones sought to hide.\"\nThe &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt; masquerading as members of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; bore the vessels of Domination across the &lt;a href=\"veil\"&gt;veil&lt;/a&gt; and used them to imprison the soul of &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;, the first &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;. The demon lord &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; planned to use the Lich King to create an army of undead &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; in order to weaken Azeroth in preparation for a Legion invasion, whereas the Jailer intended for the Lich King to herald his own coming and reign on Azeroth. The nathrezim made the Legion believe that the Lich King was solely their instrument and not an instrument of Death, and in this way tricked them into helping to spread the Jailer's influence on the mortal plane. The nathrezim built a stronghold for the Lich King, &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, whose secret true purpose was to one day channel Azeroth's life force into the Shadowlands via the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Souls\"&gt;Forge of Souls&lt;/a&gt;. However, Zovaal at some point decided that Ner'zhul was \"weak-willed\" and unworthy of the purpose Zovaal had planned for him.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; took up Frostmourne and became the Lich King's champion. As a mourneblade, Frostmourne could shatter its victims' souls into fragments. Many of the fragments that Arthas tore from his kills were sent to the Jailer, who stored them away in the &lt;a href=\"Ossuary%20of%20the%20Banished\"&gt;Ossuary of the Banished&lt;/a&gt; in Torghast. One of these victims was &lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther the Lightbringer&lt;/a&gt;, whose incomplete soul was sent to &lt;a href=\"Bastion\"&gt;Bastion&lt;/a&gt;, setting in motion a chain of events that led to the Jailer swaying the &lt;a href=\"kyrian\"&gt;kyrian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Devos\"&gt;Devos&lt;/a&gt; to his side and convincing her to form the rebel &lt;a href=\"Forsworn\"&gt;Forsworn&lt;/a&gt;. Another was &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, whom Zovaal came to know and understand through Frostmourne.\nFollowing the Third War, Ner'zhul and the Scourge rebelled against the Legion. The nathrezim &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt;, in a conversation with Sylvanas, commented that the Lich King was straying from \"the path of his master\" and that Arthas was too prideful to be \"the instrument that is necessary\". It's not clear if by \"master\" he was referring to the Jailer or Kil'jaeden.\nArthas ultimately usurped Ner'zhul to become the new Lich King. Ner'zhul's soul ended up in the Maw, where the Jailer informed him of how he had failed in his role as herald and confined him to eternal torture within his stronghold, the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Sanctum of Domination&lt;/a&gt;. The Jailer subsequently tried to use the new Lich King to herald his coming instead, but Arthas also proved to be a failure: he was too weak to master Frostmourne's potential and defied the Jailer to instead pursue his own desire for power and conquest. After Arthas' defeat, Devos and Uther cast his soul into the Maw, where the Jailer laid claim to it.\nArthas was succeeded as Lich King by &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt;. During his years on the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt;, Bolvar could sense a malevolent presence at the edge of his mind. Although he did not realize that it was the Jailer trying to twist him into a pawn, he managed to resist the Banished One's influence. Even so, Bolvar reflected years later that he didn't know how many of his actions furthered Icecrown Citadel's true purpose.\nA new pact.\nAfter Arthas' death, Sylvanas Windrunner committed suicide at Icecrown. &lt;a href=\"The%20Nine\"&gt;The Nine&lt;/a&gt;, a group of &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt; serving the Jailer, showed her visions of the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;'s future until she asked for oblivion. Her soul found itself in the Maw, where she was tortured by the Mawsworn until the Jailer intervened and revealed himself to her. He told her about his past, presenting the other Eternal Ones as cruel beings who had ripped out his heart and imprisoned him in the Maw simply for altruistically wanting to replace the First Ones' unfair design\u2014a reality in which no one truly had free will\u2014with a better one. He claimed that it was the \"false Arbiter\" who had sent Sylvanas to the Maw, despite her heroism in life, and continued that he needed her help\u2014the help of a willing ally, not a slave\u2014to break the system of Life and Death so he could give everyone true freedom.\nSylvanas initially refused to believe him, thinking that he was simply telling her what she wanted to hear, and grew furious when he explained his involvement with Frostmourne and the Lich King, as she thought it meant that her death and undeath at Arthas' hands were ultimately his fault. The Jailer insisted that he was not the one who'd commanded Arthas to kill her, and that while Arthas cut her down, he wanted to lift her up. To convince her, Zovaal summoned the Nine so they could show some of the Shadowlands' infinite afterlives to her and let her judge the unfairness of the First Ones' design for herself. Before leaving, he whispered something to the Val'kyr that Sylvanas couldn't hear.\nViewing the various afterlives convinced Sylvanas that the Shadowlands were a flawed system, but she still didn't trust the Jailer. He told her that he was confident she'd join him eventually but that he didn't want to force her, since he needed a willing partner. He continued that she needed to abandon her mortal morals and attachments, since the ends\u2014ending all suffering forever\u2014justified any means. He asked her to send a Val'kyr to him once she'd decided to join him, and to watch for five future events as signs that his words were true: a fiery darkness would return, she would have to \"step out of the shadows and lead\", a blade would pierce the heart of the world, she would hold the blood from its wound, and finally, she would topple a king and shatter the sky itself. With this, the Val'kyr brought Sylvanas back to the world of the living. To prevent the rest of the Shadowlands from noticing that the Jailer had saved her from the Maw, the Val'kyr &lt;a href=\"Annhylde\"&gt;Annhylde&lt;/a&gt; took Sylvanas' place in the realm.\nA few years later, the Burning Legion launched its &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt; of Azeroth, fulfilling the first of the Jailer's prophecies. At the start of the invasion, the Jailer's servant Mueh'zala whispered to &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; on his deathbed to convince him to name Sylvanas the new &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; with the words \"You must step out of the shadows and lead\", the same ones Zovaal had used. This finally convinced Sylvanas, and she sent &lt;a href=\"Signe\"&gt;Signe&lt;/a&gt; to tell the Jailer that she accepted his pact. As part of the alliance, Zovaal gave Sylvanas the ability to wield the Domination magic of the Maw. His first task for her was to go to &lt;a href=\"Helheim\"&gt;Helheim&lt;/a&gt; to meet with another one of his allies, &lt;a href=\"Helya\"&gt;Helya&lt;/a&gt;, and obtain the &lt;a href=\"Soulcage\"&gt;Soulcage&lt;/a&gt; from her. Sylvanas was to use it to force &lt;a href=\"Eyir\"&gt;Eyir&lt;/a&gt; to send her Val'kyr to Helya so she could corrupt them. However, the plan was thwarted by &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the end of the invasion, Azeroth's heroes killed the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20%28titan%29\"&gt;soul of Argus&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; impaled Azeroth with &lt;a href=\"Sword%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;his sword&lt;/a&gt; and caused the world-soul to start bleeding &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt;, fulfilling two more of the Jailer's prophecies. Meanwhile, as Zovaal and the nathrezim had planned, Argus' soul traveled to &lt;a href=\"Oribos\"&gt;Oribos&lt;/a&gt; and rendered the Arbiter dormant. In her absence, all souls entering the Shadowlands began funneling into the Maw instead of being sorted to their just afterlives, thereby depriving the other realms of &lt;a href=\"anima\"&gt;anima&lt;/a&gt; and threatening to make the Jailer strong enough to break free from the Maw.\nZovaal sent the nathrezim &lt;a href=\"Mal%27Ganis\"&gt;Mal'Ganis&lt;/a&gt; to Azeroth to inform Sylvanas of the new situation and instruct her to start unleashing death and destruction on Azeroth. She complied and used her position as warchief to plunge Azeroth into the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, causing mass casualties and thereby feeding the Maw with even more new souls that could be conscripted into the Mawsworn army and causing both her and the Jailer to grow more powerful.\nShadowlands.\nWith his bindings broken, the Jailer intended to \"reclaim what [was] his\". &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Renathal\"&gt;Prince Renathal&lt;/a&gt; believed that if the Jailer escaped, all the realms of Death would fall. Similarly, &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Moonberry\"&gt;Lady Moonberry&lt;/a&gt; was of the belief that a freed Jailer would plunge all of the realms of the Shadowlands into inescapable, crushing despair. Meanwhile, &lt;a href=\"Sire%20Denathrius\"&gt;Sire Denathrius&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Herald%20Dalora\"&gt;Herald Dalora&lt;/a&gt; believed that the Jailer would bring a torrent of change that would leave Death, and those who shaped its victory, as the only powers remaining, and Denathrius' nathrezim similarly believed that those who had been loyal to Zovaal would be rewarded after reality was \"born anew\". &lt;a href=\"Devos\"&gt;Devos&lt;/a&gt; believed that the Eternal Ones' imprisonment of Zovaal was a \"great injustice\" and that he sought to \"free us from the prison we have built for ourselves\".\nThe Jailer instructed Sylvanas to defeat the Lich King Bolvar and destroy the &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Helm of Domination&lt;/a&gt; in order to tear open a rift through the &lt;a href=\"veil\"&gt;veil&lt;/a&gt; separating the Shadowlands from the world of the living. He also entrusted her with finding a selfless and heroic soul, one who could slip into the realm of &lt;a href=\"Bastion\"&gt;Bastion&lt;/a&gt; and claim the &lt;a href=\"sigil\"&gt;sigil&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Kyrestia%20the%20Firstborne\"&gt;Kyrestia the Firstborne&lt;/a&gt;, the Eternal One who ruled the &lt;a href=\"kyrian\"&gt;kyrian&lt;/a&gt;. After opening the rift, Sylvanas sent her Val'kyr to kidnap leaders of Azeroth's &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and bring them to the Maw: &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;. They tried to kidnap &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; as well, but she defeated her attackers. In the Maw, the Jailer took a special interest in these four prisoners and personally oversaw their torture alongside Sylvanas to test them and see which of them could be turned into a weapon.\nWith the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;war against the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;heroes of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; soon traveled into the Maw to rescue the leaders and managed to meet up with Jaina, Thrall, and Anduin. The group was joined by Baine after the Jailer decided that the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; chieftain was \"unworthy\" and threw him off a platform. The Azerothians subsequently fought their way to a &lt;a href=\"Eroded%20Waystone\"&gt;waystone&lt;/a&gt; of the First Ones in the hopes of using it to escape the Maw. The Jailer was stunned to see the waystone responding to the presence of Azeroth's champion and sent his Mawsworn army to stop them, but Anduin used the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; to hold off the attackers long enough for the champion to escape. The Jailer declared this to be \"interesting\", and when Anduin told him that he had failed, the Jailer calmly replied that he had precisely what he needed. The Jailer subsequently brought Anduin, Thrall, Jaina, and Baine into &lt;a href=\"Torghast%2C%20Tower%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Torghast&lt;/a&gt; for further torture.\nThe adventurers, now called &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Walker\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt;s, eventually breached the &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20the%20Primus\"&gt;Seat of the Primus&lt;/a&gt; and discovered the Primus' warning. When Sylvanas informed the Jailer of this, he declared that while it was unfortunate, it was of little consequence and the nuisance would be dealt with. Not long after, Sire Denathrius revealed himself to be in league with the Jailer and channeled his immense amounts of hoarded &lt;a href=\"anima\"&gt;anima&lt;/a&gt; into the Maw. Prince Renathal stated that the Jailer would surely use this power to shatter his bonds. The remaining Eternal Ones and &lt;a href=\"covenant\"&gt;covenant&lt;/a&gt; leaders subsequently decreed that each mortal had to choose a covenant so that the realms could regain their strength and once again stand together against the darkness. With the guidance of Bolvar\u2014who used the shards of the Helm of Domination to peer into the tower\u2014the Maw Walkers repeatedly ventured into Torghast to rescue their captured allies and take Baine, Jaina, and Thrall to the safety of &lt;a href=\"Oribos\"&gt;Oribos&lt;/a&gt;. However, Bolvar's repeated gazing into the tower eventually allowed the Jailer to gaze back, and the heroes could not find any sign of Anduin, who had been taken deeper into the Torghast than the others. In a private conversation with Sylvanas, the Jailer proclaimed that they had to begin preparation of their new \"weapon\". Sylvanas convinced the Jailer to leave Anduin to her, arguing that bringing him around into believing in their cause would yield superior results.\nHowever, as time passed and Sylvanas failed to convince Anduin, the Jailer decided that a more \"direct approach\" was necessary. Having learned from his previous mistakes with the Lich King, the Jailer decided to use &lt;a href=\"Domination\"&gt;Domination&lt;/a&gt; to control Anduin directly and turn him into a weapon that would succeed where the Lich Kings had failed. He had Anduin's sword &lt;a href=\"Shalamayne\"&gt;Shalamayne&lt;/a&gt; transformed into a &lt;a href=\"mourneblade\"&gt;mourneblade&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kingsmourne\"&gt;Kingsmourne&lt;/a&gt;, and inserted what was left of &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;'s soul into it to serve as the source of Anduin's Domination. At the same time, Sire Denathrius was defeated and captured and Sylvanas asked the Jailer how they should recover him. The Jailer simply replied that every soul had its purpose and that Denathrius had fulfilled his. He then declared that it was time to forge their next weapon and that they'd come too far to falter. While Sylvanas took the completed Kingsmourne to Anduin and tried one last time to convince him to join them willingly, the Jailer struck at Bolvar in Oribos through the Helm of Domination in an attempt to seize control of his mind. However, Jaina and the Maw Walker were able to sever the connection.\nChains of Domination.\nIn the hopes of uncovering secrets of the First Ones and the key to fulfill his vision for the Shadowlands, the Jailer pulled a fragment of the long-lost realm of &lt;a href=\"Korthia\"&gt;Korthia&lt;/a&gt; into the Maw from where it had been hidden in the &lt;a href=\"In-Between\"&gt;In-Between&lt;/a&gt;, specifically in search of the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20Secrets\"&gt;Vault of Secrets&lt;/a&gt; and its most precious treasure: the sigil of the Primus.\nAfter failing to convince Anduin, Sylvanas forcibly Dominated him, equipping him with Kingsmourne and a suit of armor covered in Domination runes that allowed the Jailer to control his actions. The Jailer sent his new vessel to &lt;a href=\"Elysian%20Hold\"&gt;Elysian Hold&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Bastion\"&gt;Bastion&lt;/a&gt; to obtain Kyrestia the Firstborne's sigil. Kyrestia recognized the Jailer's presence in Anduin and demanded that the former release the king from his grasp. In response, the Jailer's voice spoke through Anduin to proclaim that \"He is bound to me, just as you once sought to bind your own brother\". Anduin then stabbed the Archon through the chest with Kingsmourne to extract her sigil before returning with it to Torghast. The Jailer commented that three keys now remained before \"they\" would see that \"Death was never meant to be chained\".\nThe Jailer's next target was the sigil of the &lt;a href=\"Winter%20Queen\"&gt;Winter Queen&lt;/a&gt;. He sent his Mawsworn\u2014led by Sylvanas herself\u2014to invade &lt;a href=\"Ardenweald\"&gt;Ardenweald&lt;/a&gt;, and the four covenants rushed to defend it. During the battle, &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; confronted Sylvanas and revealed that she had killed the latter's champion, &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller\"&gt;Nathanos Blightcaller&lt;/a&gt;. Sylvanas was surprised by this, and Tyrande mockingly told her that the Jailer was intentionally keeping secrets from her. The covenants ultimately pushed the Mawsworn out of Ardenweald, but Anduin managed to breach the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20the%20Forest\"&gt;Heart of the Forest&lt;/a&gt; and steal the Winter Queen's sigil. Meanwhile, the Jailer's forces assaulted &lt;a href=\"Oribos\"&gt;Oribos&lt;/a&gt; to claim yet another sigil, that of the Arbiter, but the covenants and the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; managed to hold off the attackers. Unwilling to wait for the Jailer to make his next move, the Maw Walkers led the covenant forces in storming into the Maw and Korthia in order to stop the Jailer from shattering the barrier around the Maw and invading the rest of the Shadowlands. Notably, the Maw Walkers worked with &lt;a href=\"Odyn\"&gt;Odyn&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt; to defeat the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;Eye of the Jailer&lt;/a&gt; and force it to leave the Maw for the safety of Torghast. Meanwhile, in his search for the Sepulcher, the Jailer pulled a fragment of &lt;a href=\"Zereth%20Mortis\"&gt;Zereth Mortis&lt;/a&gt;\u2014the land of the First Ones\u2014 containing \"Sepulcher access cyphers\" into his seat of power, the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Sanctum of Domination&lt;/a&gt; atop Torghast. He also had his &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt; minions capture Korthia's fatescribe, &lt;a href=\"Fatescribe%20Roh-Kalo\"&gt;Roh-Kalo&lt;/a&gt;, and bring him to the Sanctum in order to tear knowledge from his mind.\nIn Korthia, a Maw Walker, the &lt;a href=\"attendant\"&gt;attendant&lt;/a&gt; leader &lt;a href=\"Tal-Galan\"&gt;Tal-Galan&lt;/a&gt;, and the Primus' apprentice &lt;a href=\"Bonesmith%20Heirmir\"&gt;Heirmir&lt;/a&gt; recovered the sigil of the Primus from the Vault of Secrets before the Mawsworn had a chance to. Hoping to untangle the magic binding it, Heirmir and the Maw Walker brought it to the Runecarver in Torghast, causing all of his memories to be restored and transforming him back into the Primus. The Jailer immediately noticed this and arrived to the &lt;a href=\"Runecarver%27s%20Oubliette\"&gt;Runecarver's Oubliette&lt;/a&gt; with a Mawsworn army. While Heirmir and the hero battled the minions, Zovaal and the Primus fought by launching beams of energy at each other. As the battle progressed, the Jailer stunned Heirmir and the Maw Walker and summoned Anduin. The Primus reminded his brother that his sigil would be lost forever if he was struck down, but he wasn't expecting Anduin to be carrying a mourneblade. Anduin used Kingsmourne to sever the sigil from the Primus' body and launch it into the Jailer's waiting hand. Having now obtained all but one of the sigils he needed, Zovaal teleported himself and his minions away, allowing the Primus and his allies to leave Torghast alive. The Primus considered Zovaal to be a fool for letting them live and believed that his desire to have them bend to his will would be his undoing. He subsequently stated that the mortals had to face Zovaal in the Sanctum of Domination. As a contingency, each of the covenants also had to forge new sigils so that they could pursue Zovaal in case the assault failed.\nThe Maw Walkers and their allies\u2014Bolvar, Thrall, and Jaina\u2014later assaulted the Sanctum, fought through the Jailer's minions, and confronted Sylvanas at the &lt;a href=\"Pinnacle%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Pinnacle of Domination&lt;/a&gt; at the top of the tower. She stalled them long enough for the Jailer to enact his plan: not to break out of the Maw, but instead to expand its boundaries around Oribos. He latched onto the city with his chains and ascended to the Arbiter's chamber, the &lt;a href=\"Crucible%20%28Oribos%29\"&gt;Crucible&lt;/a&gt;, where he began breaking through her defenses. Sylvanas and Anduin kept the heroes occupied long enough for Zovaal to destroy the Arbiter's shield and merge with her by absorbing her essence. The orb-shaped sigil entered and filled the hole in his chest, restoring the &lt;a href=\"anima\"&gt;anima&lt;/a&gt; that the other Eternal Ones had taken from him and causing him to recover his full set of armor. The victorious Jailer immediately opened a large portal to &lt;a href=\"Zereth%20Mortis\"&gt;Zereth Mortis&lt;/a&gt; before using Domination to incapacitate Thrall, Bolvar, and Jaina. Sylvanas told Zovaal that they now had everything they needed, but he replied that he had endured \"the &lt;a href=\"First%20Ones\"&gt;makers'&lt;/a&gt; flawed design\" for too long and revealed his true goal: not to break the system of Death and give everyone free will as Sylvanas had believed, but to forge a new reality where all would be forced to serve him.\nRemembering similar statements by &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, Sylvanas fired a black arrow at the Jailer\u2014which he caught without even laying an eye on her\u2014and told him that she would never serve, thereby effectively turning against him. After a brief silence, the Jailer replied that it was a \"pity\" that she was \"still chained by mortality\". However, as payment for helping him regain what had been stolen from him, he gave Sylvanas the fragment of her soul that had been severed by &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt; many years prior, causing her to fall unconscious. With Sylvanas no longer of any use to him, the Jailer unchained the Maw Walkers' allies and left Sylvanas' fate in their hands before telling Anduin to accompany him and bear witness to the end of reality. The two left through the portal, which closed behind them.\nSylvanas remained unconscious as the lost part of her soul was forced to endlessly relive the crimes the rest of her soul had committed over the years, which the Jailer believed would surely destroy her. Back in Korthia, the Primus warned that all would be undone if Zovaal succeeded in finding the knowledge he sought in the Sepulcher. He then began working on a way to follow the Jailer to Zereth Mortis.\nEternity's End.\nBy returning to the forbidden realm of Zereth Mortis, Zovaal defied the most sacred laws of his First One creators. His Mawsworn quickly spread across the realm like a plague in search of a way into the Sepulcher. The Mawsworn initially laid siege to the &lt;a href=\"Enlightened\"&gt;Enlightened&lt;/a&gt; village of &lt;a href=\"Haven\"&gt;Haven&lt;/a&gt;, but the Jailer personally arrived to call off the attack since he believed that the place was of no consequence. While the Maw Walkers and their allies arrived to Zereth Mortis, the Mawsworn used Domination to take control of &lt;a href=\"automa\"&gt;automa&lt;/a&gt;, the realm's caretakers, and destroy the obelisks protecting the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Afterlives\"&gt;Forge of Afterlives&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, nathrezim led by &lt;a href=\"Mal%27Ganis\"&gt;Mal'Ganis&lt;/a&gt; infiltrated the covenants to disrupt their efforts. When a Maw Walker confronted Mal'Ganis, he revealed that this had merely been to stall for time and let Zovaal and Anduin reach the Forge of Afterlives. At the Jailer's command, Anduin dominated &lt;a href=\"Dausegne\"&gt;Dausegne&lt;/a&gt;, the automa protecting the Forge. The Jailer then arrived in person and forced Dausegne to disable the Forge, allowing him to use it to transport himself, Anduin, and Dausegne directly to the Sepulcher and seal the way behind them.\nBack in Oribos, &lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther the Lightbringer&lt;/a&gt; helped Sylvanas awaken from her coma. She joined forces with the Maw Walkers and their allies and told them that they had no chance of defeating Zovaal without a way to resist his Domination, and that freeing Anduin might be the key. After opening the way into the Sepulcher and fighting through its defenders, the Maw Walkers confronted Anduin at &lt;a href=\"Domination%27s%20Grasp\"&gt;Domination's Grasp&lt;/a&gt;. The Jailer commanded Anduin to destroy the heroes and sever his final tie to mortality. The heroes helped gradually restore Anduin's willpower, but the Jailer still refused to release his grasp on the king and whispered to him to fulfill his \"final purpose\"\u2014annihilation\u2014while Kingsmourne seemingly began draining his soul. Anduin mustered the will to resist and split Kingsmourne in half, freeing himself from the Jailer as well as releasing the fading remnant of Arthas' soul. However, Zovaal himself was already on the cusp of victory, having reached the Sepulcher's final chamber\u2014the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Heart of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;\u2014and putting Domination in place to prevent anyone from following him.\nThe heroes brought Anduin out of the Sepulcher, but he didn't know how to counteract the Jailer's power. With the guidance of the &lt;a href=\"Primus\"&gt;Primus&lt;/a&gt;, the Maw Walkers and their allies instead used the &lt;a href=\"Cypher%20of%20the%20First%20Ones\"&gt;language of the First Ones&lt;/a&gt; and the resistance that Anduin and other past victims of Domination had built up to reforge the remnants of the &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Helm of Domination&lt;/a&gt; into a new object of power: the &lt;a href=\"Crown%20of%20Wills\"&gt;Crown of Wills&lt;/a&gt;. The Crown allowed the heroes to become resistant to Domination, which Bolvar and the Primus believed would be the key to finally defeating Zovaal. The Maw Walkers returned to the Sepulcher, defeated the Jailer's &lt;a href=\"Lords%20of%20Dread\"&gt;dreadlord minions&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Rygelon\"&gt;constellar he had Dominated&lt;/a&gt;, and confronted him in the Heart of Eternity just as he put his final plan into action: he activated the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Souls\"&gt;Forge of Souls&lt;/a&gt; below &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt; to draw the life force of the &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28titan%29\"&gt;soul of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; into the Sepulcher, trying to pull her soul into the Shadowlands, so that it could power the &lt;a href=\"Machine%20of%20Origination\"&gt;Machine of Origination&lt;/a&gt;, which he could then use to remake existence. If successful, Zovaal's efforts would've triggered a chain reaction, causing his power to cascade outward from Zereth Mortis into the heart of each of the other cosmic forces, binding one after another to his will until they were all dominated by his power.\nHowever, with their resistance to Domination and with a boon granted by Azeroth herself, the Maw Walkers were able to protect the world-soul from the Jailer's attacks, prevent him from configuring the Machine, and ultimately defeat him. As he fell to his knees, he watched in disbelief as both his armor and his body gradually dissolved. In his final moments, Zovaal repeated what he had told the other Eternal Ones during his original betrayal eons earlier: \"A cosmos divided will not survive what is to come.\" The last of his power then faded from him, leaving only a lifeless vessel behind. With the death of Zovaal, Azeroth was saved and the rift Sylvanas had created in the sky over Icecrown closed.\nAfterward, the &lt;a href=\"broker\"&gt;broker&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Firim\"&gt;Firim&lt;/a&gt; examined the Sepulcher and feared that Zovaal's efforts might've left behind a tiny crack in the pattern keeping the six forces in balance, a crack that would only grow until the balance was in danger of being shattered by another force. Firim hoped that the First Ones had anticipated this eventuality and left countermeasures in place, but he remained fearful of the possibility that they had in fact never intended for their design to endure. The Jailer's defeat\u2014along with the ascension of a &lt;a href=\"Pelagos\"&gt;new Arbiter&lt;/a&gt;\u2014marked the beginning of a new era for the Shadowlands, as the afterlives could start to recover from the anima drought. Bolvar, however, noted that the most insidious thing about the Jailer was that, even in defeat, the doubt he'd sowed in his enemies over the years still lived on.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

The leader of the Zanchuli Council and chief advisor to King Rastakhan, Zul has earned his name and title through his many years &lt;a href=\"Sight\"&gt;foretelling accurate futures&lt;/a&gt;, providing the kingdom's military and agriculture with a tremendous advantage. From a young age, Zul was burdened by prophecies of dark times and the end of the world. Many of these prophecies came to pass, including the coming of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;. While some of the catastrophes were not as grim as Zul predicted, the events did come to pass. Zul has lived many lives of trolls, preaching and predicting and standing by the side of his friend and king, Rastakhan.\nAfter the Cataclysm devastated parts of &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;, Zul took the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Fleet\"&gt;Golden Fleet&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Empire\"&gt;Zandalari Empire&lt;/a&gt; and led them across the globe to reunite the other &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"tribe\"&gt;tribe&lt;/a&gt;s. He also orchestrated the attempted assault on &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; from behind the scenes to renew ties with the &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt;. He is one of the main antagonists on &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt; during the first part of \"\". \nBiography.\nAmong the &lt;a href=\"Zanchuli%20Council\"&gt;Zanchuli Council&lt;/a&gt; are many &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s of incredible power and forbidden knowledge. One of the most respected of these is Zul. Even as a child his dark and terrible visions had come true down to the last horrifying detail. He commanded fear and respect as one of the dark prophets: seers capable of witnessing great tragedies before they come to pass. This is a power referred to as the &lt;a href=\"Sight\"&gt;Sight&lt;/a&gt;, and Zul had a student named &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jamba\"&gt;Vol'jamba&lt;/a&gt; who also had the Sight. During the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt; Zul was present with the Zandalari forces in &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Drak\"&gt;Zul'Drak&lt;/a&gt;, where he witnessed the &lt;a href=\"Drakkari\"&gt;Drakkari&lt;/a&gt; sacrificing their &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt; for power.\nYears ago Zul warned &lt;a href=\"King%20Rastakhan\"&gt;King Rastakhan&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Shattering\"&gt;a terrible Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;. For Zul had seen a vision of a &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;great armored dragon&lt;/a&gt; clenching the world in his ferocious jaws. Months later Zul returned, bearing more grim news from his visions. He saw a &lt;a href=\"Naga\"&gt;legion of serpents&lt;/a&gt; pouring forth from a gaping fissure that tore open the floor of the ocean. Still, King Rastakhan did nothing. Finally, mere months before the Cataclysm, Zul returned. Tearing his clothes and throwing his staff to the ground, Zul spoke of earthquakes and tidal waves. He described the golden capital of Zandalar slowly sinking beneath the waves in the aftermath of the Cataclysm, its once-great people drowning as their mighty works slipped forever beneath the sea. He advised the council and the king to unite with the other troll tribes and to abandon their doomed homeland. Despite Zul's infamy, the council refused to believe in the scope of the disaster to come. Many felt that Zul was grandstanding to increase his own status and power.\nKing Rastakhan tired of Zul and his troubling nightmares. To be rid of the prophet, he granted Zul the use of his largest ships, so that he and his followers could seek a new land if his visions came to pass. They scoffed as he and his followers began assembling a war fleet and reaching out to the lesser troll races. The old prophet sailed all around the oceans, meeting with the other tribes like the &lt;a href=\"Sandfury%20troll\"&gt;Sandfury troll&lt;/a&gt;s or the &lt;a href=\"Drakkari\"&gt;Drakkari&lt;/a&gt;. \nBut Zul's vision were visions of the truth. &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;'s Cataclysm rocked &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt; to its foundation. The spine of the land broke in two, and soon, the city and all its riches began to slide into the hungry sea. The Zandalari people turned to their King for help, but there was only one Zandalari equipped to help them: The prophet Zul. Even now the mighty and enigmatic troll empire slides into the sea, and Zandalari peasants and warriors alike flock to Zul for guidance on what to do next. But though Zandalar was indeed damaged, it did not sink as Zul predicted. While Zul and the Golden Fleet left Zandalar, those that stayed behind endured and rebuilt.\nRise of the Zandalari.\nLed by Zul, &lt;a href=\"War%20against%20the%20Zandalari\"&gt;the Zandalari issued a call&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s embattled troll populations: unite into a single mighty empire and save their race from extinction. Zul was the leader of the Zandalari delegation that appeared at the meeting of the troll tribes, inviting them to join the Zandalari at Rastakhan's proposal. When &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; refused, Zul threatened him that against &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20the%20Soulflayer\"&gt;the powers&lt;/a&gt; they would soon unleash, none would stand against them for long.\nMists of Pandaria.\nIn the wake of the mists vanishing around Pandaria, Zul has sent Zandalari scouts under the command of &lt;a href=\"Prophet%20Khar%27zul\"&gt;Prophet Khar'zul&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gara%27jal%20the%20Spiritbinder\"&gt;Gara'jal the Spiritbinder&lt;/a&gt; to find out information about their ancient mogu allies. Setting up on the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Reckoning\"&gt;Isle of Reckoning&lt;/a&gt;, the Zandalari immediately go about invading Zouchin province, massacring a large percentage of its populace in order to penetrate deeper into Pandaria. Eventually, the Zandalari discover and reconnect with the mogu clans inhabiting the mountains of &lt;a href=\"Kun-Lai%20Summit\"&gt;Kun-Lai Summit&lt;/a&gt;. The Zandalari and the mogu immediately go about raising stone, jade, and terracotta warriors to fuel the mogu army which is intent upon retaking Pandaria from the Pandaren. Zul then orders the Zandalari to find information about the dreaded First Emperor of Pandaria, &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen\"&gt;Lei Shen&lt;/a&gt;, the Thunder King. They find his body secured by several hundred terracotta soldiers. After taking his body away, the mogu enter to raise the terracotta to fight. Although the Zandalari succeed in resurrecting the Thunder King, Prophet Khar'zul and a large amount of the Zandalari invasion force are killed in the process. Lei Shen immediately allies with Zul and goes about uniting the mogu clans and the Zandalari.\nAfter Lei Shen's resurrection, Zul orders Gara'jal to break into the &lt;a href=\"Mogu%27shan%20Vaults\"&gt;Mogu'shan Vaults&lt;/a&gt; and discover the secrets and weapons within to make the Zandalari stronger. Gara'jal eagerly assaults the Vaults, but he and his Zandalari forces are eventually killed on top of a terrace overlooking Zouchin Province.\nLei Shen returns to his &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;island citadel&lt;/a&gt; with the majority of Zul's Zandalari army and along with the Mogu, forms then into an enormous army which is bent on reclaiming Pandaria for the Mogu and Lei Shen. Zul orders the Zandalari to immediately begin land assaults on the continent itself.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nThe Horde infiltrated &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Stockade\"&gt;Stormwind Stockade&lt;/a&gt; to free Zul and &lt;a href=\"Princess%20Talanji\"&gt;Princess Talanji&lt;/a&gt;. Throughout their escape from &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;, Zul used his powers of prophecy to guide the group to safety; for example, telling them to jump into Stormwind's canals in order to avoid &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; who was just about to enter the area. Zul also set the city on fire to force the Alliance to decide between capturing them or putting the fires out. Afterward, he traveled to &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt; with the Horde and Talanji.\nIn Zul's absence his pupil &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jamba\"&gt;Vol'jamba&lt;/a&gt; had taken control of the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20tribe\"&gt;Gurubashi&lt;/a&gt; enclave of &lt;a href=\"Tal%27gurub\"&gt;Tal'gurub&lt;/a&gt;. King Rastakhan ordered Zul to deal with the situation and though agreeing Zul remarked that his former student wouldn't die by his hand. Thus Zul and the newly christened &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Speaker of the Horde&lt;/a&gt; ventured forth to Tal'gurub. While he dealt primarily with his former student, he left the task of dealing with &lt;a href=\"Jambani\"&gt;his followers&lt;/a&gt; to the Speaker. After hearing of Vol'jamba's prophecy, Zul instructed the Speaker to dismiss it because the truth was being distorted by fear. In order to deal with Vol'jamba, Zul ordered the Speaker to sabotage Vol'jamba's precautions in order to kill Vol'jamba. Following the death of his former pupil, Zul remarked that it was a pity that he wasn't able to teach him the most important lesson of all - that you must plan even for the futures that you have not seen. With matters in Tal'gurub dealt with, Zul sent the Speaker to report their success with Rastakhan.\nUnder directions from Zul, &lt;a href=\"Yazma\"&gt;Yazma&lt;/a&gt; enlisted the Speaker of the Horde in spreading his word to &lt;a href=\"Nokali%20the%20Scarred\"&gt;Nokali the Scarred&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Doomsayer%20Volkini\"&gt;Doomsayer Volkini&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Dockmaster%20Cobo\"&gt;Dockmaster Cobo&lt;/a&gt;. At Zul's command, &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Kao\"&gt;Warlord Kao&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Kao-Tien\"&gt;Kao-Tien&lt;/a&gt; launched an attack on &lt;a href=\"Warport%20Rastari\"&gt;Warport Rastari&lt;/a&gt; in order to lure away &lt;a href=\"Zolani\"&gt;Zolani&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Habutu\"&gt;Habutu&lt;/a&gt; from King Rastakhan's side. After discovering this, Habutu rushed to the King's side only to be killed by Yazma. Reeling from Habutu's death, Rastakhan was stabbed in the back by Zul. As Rastakhan collapsed to the ground, Zul told him that he had grown stagnant and let the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Empire\"&gt;Zandalari Empire&lt;/a&gt; rot and decay. Declaring that the Zandalari shall no longer treat with outsiders nor bargain with loa, Zul openly stated his allegiance to &lt;a href=\"G%27huun\"&gt;G'huun&lt;/a&gt;. When Rastakhan was rescued by Zolani, Zul refused to go after them convinced that in time they would come to him. Despite his words when he received word that Rastakhan was in &lt;a href=\"Zeb%27ahari\"&gt;Zeb'ahari&lt;/a&gt;, Zul's followers took to besieging the village. During this time, it was discovered that Zul had struck an accord with &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen Rastakhan recovered his strength, he rallied the Zandalari and the three eldest loa within Zuldazar: &lt;a href=\"Rezan\"&gt;Rezan&lt;/a&gt; Loa of Kings, &lt;a href=\"Gonk\"&gt;Gonk&lt;/a&gt; the Great Hunter, and &lt;a href=\"Pa%27ku\"&gt;Pa'ku&lt;/a&gt; Master of Winds in hunting Zul down. In their hunt for Zul they discovered that he and Yazma have corrupted the once pristine tombs of &lt;a href=\"Atal%27Dazar\"&gt;Atal'Dazar&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Mugamba\"&gt;Mount Mugamba&lt;/a&gt; and seek to twist the power of the ancient kings buried there for their own dark machinations, and revive &lt;a href=\"Dazar\"&gt;Dazar&lt;/a&gt;, first king of the Zandalari, using techniques Zul learned from the revival of Lei Shen, so he could rule the reborn troll empire in Rastakhan's place. Having witnessed the Drakkari sacrificing their loa for power in &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Drak\"&gt;Zul'Drak&lt;/a&gt;, Zul sought to do the same to the loa of Zandalar.\nSeeking to stop the prophet, the Zandalari army fought their way towards Atal'Dazar. During the confrontation with Zul, Rezan was slain and revived by Zul's dark power. While Rezan walked the lower levels of Atal'Dazar, Zul used his essence to revive &lt;a href=\"Dazar\"&gt;Dazar&lt;/a&gt;, the first king of the Zandalari.\nSeeking to break the final seal holding G'huun imprisoned Zul led his forces to attack &lt;a href=\"Dazar%27alor\"&gt;Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt; in order to break the final seal and release the blood god. Rastakhan, empowered by &lt;a href=\"Bwonsamdi\"&gt;Bwonsamdi&lt;/a&gt;, fought Zul and defeated him, but &lt;a href=\"Mythrax\"&gt;Mythrax&lt;/a&gt; succeeded in destroying the final seal. The mortally wounded Zul laughed defiantly at Rastakhan and told him to enjoy ruling over his kingdom of ashes, before Rastakhan angrily shoved him off the ledge, sending Zul falling into the flames below to his death. Zul would be revived as an undead by G'huun, but he was only a hollow shell of his former self. From within &lt;a href=\"Uldir\"&gt;Uldir&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"blood%20troll\"&gt;blood troll&lt;/a&gt;s fought under his command, until a group of adventurers stormed Uldir and killed Zul, who, with his last words, declared that this wasn't the future he was promised.\nQuotes.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nGossip.\nDe moment I saw your face in Stormwind, I knew de time of de prophecy was upon us.\nDe spirits show me many things, and in dese visions, I have seen your face at de head of many great events to come.\nThings are in motion, &lt;class&gt;.

It was apparently ruined during the ancient battle between &lt;a href=\"Sethraliss\"&gt;Sethraliss&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mythrax\"&gt;Mythrax&lt;/a&gt;. Long ago, statues of the three &lt;a href=\"sethrak\"&gt;sethrak&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Keepers%20%28sethrak%29\"&gt;Keepers&lt;/a&gt;\u2014&lt;a href=\"Sulthis\"&gt;Sulthis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Korthek\"&gt;Korthek&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Vorrik\"&gt;Vorrik&lt;/a&gt;\u2014were built around the ruins, and sethrak traveled from near and far to place tokens of their affection at the feet of the statues. When Sulthis began suspecting that Korthek was planning treachery, he hid &lt;a href=\"Sulthis%27%20Keystone\"&gt;his keystone&lt;/a&gt; to Atul'Aman in Zul'Ahjin and recorded a message for Vorrik before being killed by Korthek.\nIn the modern day, &lt;a href=\"Faithless\"&gt;Faithless&lt;/a&gt; forces led by &lt;a href=\"Overseer%20Nerzet\"&gt;Overseer Nerzet&lt;/a&gt; scour the ruins in search of Sulthis' key. Meanwhile, a crew of &lt;a href=\"vulpera\"&gt;vulpera&lt;/a&gt; looters\u2014based out of a small building in the northwest corner of the city\u2014sneak in and out of the ruins, ransacking treasure from under the sethrak's noses, though some have been taken prisoner by the Faithless.\nAfter their reunion at the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Akunda\"&gt;Temple of Akunda&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bladeguard%20Kaja\"&gt;Bladeguard Kaja&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rakera\"&gt;Warguard Rakera&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Meerah\"&gt;Meerah&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; traveled to Zul'Ahjin in search of Rakera's friend &lt;a href=\"Julwaba\"&gt;Julwaba&lt;/a&gt;, who had gone to excavate the ruins and whom Rakera hoped would know more about the mysterious weapon (Mythrax) sought by &lt;a href=\"General%20Jakra%27zet\"&gt;General Jakra'zet&lt;/a&gt;. After surviving an attack from Jakra'zet's troops, the group found Julwaba alongside her dying &lt;a href=\"Devoted\"&gt;Devoted&lt;/a&gt; friend &lt;a href=\"Serrik\"&gt;Serrik&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href=\"Kiro\"&gt;Kiro&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nisha\"&gt;Nisha&lt;/a&gt;, who were passing through the ruins on their way to the Faithless stronghold in the north. After Kiro helped heal Serrik, the sethrak directed the adventurer to investigate a &lt;a href=\"Crumbling%20Statue\"&gt;Crumbling Statue&lt;/a&gt; in the center of the ruins if they wanted to unlock the city's secrets. By placing sapphires in the statue's eyes, the adventurer triggered the old message from Sulthis and obtained the Keeper's keystone.

The &lt;a href=\"Zandalari\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; rallied the troll tribes against this new foe and summoned the &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt; to fight by their side, tearing through the aqiri ranks and even wounding Kith'ix, forcing it to retreat. The Amani trolls tracked Kith'ix's trail far to the northeastern woodlands, cutting through an unending mass of aqiri guardians. In a final savage battle, the entire tribe flung itself in a suicidal attack against Kith'ix and its remaining insectoid minions. Only a tiny fraction of the troll army survived. Even so, the C'Thrax succumbed to its tireless hunters.\nAtop the site where they had killed Kith'ix, the trolls established a new settlement. It would one day grow into a sprawling temple city known as Zul'Aman. With the C'Thrax gone, the aqir no longer fought with as much ferocity or purpose and the war between the aqir and the trolls shifted dramatically.\nEmpire's Fall.\nThousands of years later, when the &lt;a href=\"high%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; were first exiled and landed in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, they met violent clashes with the forest trolls, who viewed them as defiling their homeland. At the time of the founding of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, the Amani Empire was the most powerful empire in the Eastern Kingdoms; they still held much of northern Lordaeron in their territorial grasp.\nEventually, the high elves joined with the humans of &lt;a href=\"Arathor\"&gt;Arathor&lt;/a&gt; and defeated the forest trolls in an immense battle that signaled the end of the forest trolls' empire. The Amani would never recover enough to extend their land beyond their home province of Zul'Aman, but they continued to be an enemy of humans and elves for thousands of years.\nSilvermoon itself was constructed over the site of sacred &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; grounds, which earned the elves further enmity from the neighboring &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani tribe&lt;/a&gt;.\nSecond War.\nLed by &lt;a href=\"Zul%27jin\"&gt;Zul'jin&lt;/a&gt;, the Amani trolls joined the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;. They did so in part to fight against the high elves, who had joined the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. After the Amani, several other &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;forest troll&lt;/a&gt;s joined the Horde war effort as well and proved to be a valuable addition to the Horde. However, Zul'jin seemed to have disappeared mysteriously after the end of the war and the defeat of the Horde. In truth Zul'jin had been captured by the high elves and freed by an Amani war party, and retreated into Zul'Aman to recuperate.\nFall of Zul'jin.\n&lt;a href=\"Zul%27jin\"&gt;Zul'jin&lt;/a&gt;, planning to take revenge against Quel'Thalas, saw the opportunity when most of the blood elves and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; were busy fighting on Outland. He had his champions harness the power of the loa with the help of the cunning &lt;a href=\"Hex%20Lord%20Malacrass\"&gt;Hex Lord Malacrass&lt;/a&gt;. Not wanting to fight a war on two fronts, the Horde sent a task force of some of their strongest champions to kill the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt; leadership.\nAt the entrance to Zul'Aman, adventurers encountered &lt;a href=\"Budd%20Nedreck\"&gt;Budd Nedreck&lt;/a&gt;, who convinced them to also steal the treasures within as well. Not only did said adventurers steal the treasures, but they also were able to beat back the Amani within Zul'Aman and successfully killed Warlord Zul'jin. With Zul'jin dead, the halls of Zul'Aman become quiet until the coming of the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt;. With the aid of the Zandalari, a new troll empire was brewing, spearheaded by &lt;a href=\"Daakara\"&gt;Warlord Daakara&lt;/a&gt;.\nRise of the Zandalari.\nAll of the troll tribes were invited to become a part of this new empire, including the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear\"&gt;Darkspear&lt;/a&gt; under Chieftain &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt;. However, Vol'jin has declined this offer, and instead joined forces with the &lt;a href=\"Ranger-General%20of%20Silvermoon\"&gt;Ranger-General of Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Halduron%20Brightwing\"&gt;Halduron Brightwing&lt;/a&gt;, and his &lt;a href=\"Farstriders\"&gt;Farstriders&lt;/a&gt; to counter the threat this new empire poses. In turn, Halduron has called upon &lt;a href=\"Vereesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Vereesa Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; and her rangers to join the battle, and the three can be seen planning their next move on the outskirts of Zul'Aman.\nHeroes of the Alliance and the Horde then entered Zul'Aman and thwarted the Zandalari plans by killing Daakara.\nAmani Pass.\nOutside Zul'Aman &lt;a href=\"Vereesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Vereesa Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Halduron%20Brightwing\"&gt;Halduron Brightwing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; have allied to combat the new threat within Zul'Aman. The following conversation plays every five minutes.\nWorld of Warcraft: Cataclysm.\nDungeon Journal.\nEchoes of unfulfilled vengeance linger in the one-time capital of the Amani tribe, Zul'Aman. Though the Amani trolls answered their warlord's call to arms, Zul'jin was denied his goal of restoring the empire to its former glory. Where he failed, the Zandalar tribe will succeed. Left unchecked, the united tribes will reclaim their lands and savor a merciless retribution.\nDescription from website.\nSeething with hatred against his ancient enemies in the Alliance, and spiteful towards his former allies among the Horde, who chose to ally themselves with the blood elves, Zul'jin rallied an army of trolls and sealed power from the Amani animal gods within the strongest of his warriors in pursuit for revenge. Zul'jin was slain and his army scattered, but the potent magics invoked in Zul'Aman remain. Now, along with several other tribes, the Zandalar trolls, devastated by the Cataclysm, have come to see Zul'Aman as a symbol of salvation for their people. They have traveled to the ancient forests to see Zul'jin's plan brought to fruition - and, with it, the rise of a unified troll empire, filled with godlike power and prepared to claim dominion over all of Azeroth.\nIn the RPG.\nThe &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;forest troll&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"kingdom\"&gt;kingdom&lt;/a&gt; of Zul'Aman is a dark, primal woodland and the only place of life in the &lt;a href=\"Blackened%20Woods\"&gt;Ghostlands&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s' &lt;a href=\"voodoo\"&gt;voodoo&lt;/a&gt; energies permeate the climate, and ancient, stepped ziggurats rise above the canopy. &lt;a href=\"Jin%27zakk\"&gt;Warlord Jin'zakk&lt;/a&gt; is rumored to command the trolls, and his &lt;a href=\"witch%20doctor\"&gt;witch doctor&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;s provide him with &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; support.\nHistory.\nOnce, forest trolls controlled a vast swath of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. Their empire was called &lt;a href=\"Amani%20Empire\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt;, and the area currently known as Zul'Aman was their power center. Their dominion stretched across the continent, and they threatened the nascent &lt;a href=\"human%20nation\"&gt;human nation&lt;/a&gt;s and the fledgling &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;kingdom of Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; with extinction. Eventually, the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; traded &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; knowledge to the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s for help in defeating the trolls, and the two races bludgeoned the forest troll empire. Now, this tiny area in northeastern Lordaeron is all that remains of the trolls' continent-spanning empire.\nIn the years after their defeat, the trolls largely gave up their imperialist mindset, though they protect their small territory zealously. They have never forgiven the humans or the elves for their near-genocide. Warbands patrol the forest, slaying all living and &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; creatures that are not trolls or natural forest beasts. They worship ancient deities, though whether these deities are the mythic &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt; or some strange creation of their voodoo witch doctors is unknown. With &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; and Quel'Thalas in ruins, the trolls move out to reclaim their kingdom.\nAny trolls encountered try to kill on sight. Explorers need to be careful but are not totally without allies in Zul'Aman. Several bands of high elves, survivors from Quel'Thalas, fled south and now wander throughout the forest. Those who stay one step ahead of the trolls survive; those who do not will learn first-hand what the cannibalistic trolls do with their victims. &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; patrols, hunting the elven refugees, also stalk through the land.\nThe Scourge group in Zul'Aman is led by &lt;a href=\"Ru%27sad\"&gt;Necromancer Ru'sad&lt;/a&gt; and they are having difficulties trying to end the elves as they know the forests better than the undead. Incorporeal troops such as &lt;a href=\"shades\"&gt;shades&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"ghost\"&gt;ghost&lt;/a&gt;s would be more helpful as the &lt;a href=\"ghoul\"&gt;ghoul&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;s make a fearsome amount of noise trudging through the overgrowth alerting the elves. The &lt;a href=\"gargoyle\"&gt;gargoyle&lt;/a&gt;s are somewhat more useful; they fly through the clearings and dense tangles of the jungle and allow the undead to discover refugee groups which they later kill as they sleep. The Scourge are confident that it is only a matter of time before they finally destroy all of the elves. They intend to prevent them from joining with their allies in &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;, or rally together. They intend to stop them from reviving the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;.\nA great witch doctor, &lt;a href=\"Ral%27jin\"&gt;Ral'jin&lt;/a&gt;, rised to prominence in Zul'Aman. Ral'jin sent out &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s to capture hundreds of prisoners for use in a massive sacrifice, planning to use this ritual to summon &lt;a href=\"Ula-Tek\"&gt;Ula-Tek&lt;/a&gt;, the Serpent Goddess. This information is bad news, but the &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; are particularly concerned: they have seen the devastation that an &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Lord\"&gt;elemental lord&lt;/a&gt;'s rebirth brings, and a bona fide &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt; must be even more powerful. The &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt;, however, are jubilant. Ula-Tek, perhaps an Old God, could serve as a companion and ally to &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt;. The Dark Iron sent a contingent to Zul'Aman to wish their goodwill and to protect Ral'jin as he completes the lengthy ritual.\nPeople and culture.\nForest trolls are vile creatures. They practice evil voodoo magic and worship primal beings they call the Forest Gods. Violent cannibals, forest trolls eat their own kind as well as their enemies with equal zest. The trolls joined forces with the Horde in the Second War, as the orcs promised them vengeance against Lordaeron and Quel'Thalas, but the trolls' savagery was too much even for the orcs. Due to this the trolls also hate orcs now, who they feel betrayed them. In short, forest trolls hate everyone \u2014 including each other.\nWitch doctors control Zul'Aman, with &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;s and warchiefs in lesser leadership positions. The exception to this tradition is &lt;a href=\"Jin%27zakk\"&gt;Warlord Jin'zakk&lt;/a&gt;, who rules the entire kingdom. The voodoo witch doctors wield arcane magic, while shamans provide divine support. Forest troll society revolves around hunting, spear fishing, shamanism, and voodoo. They make their capital at the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Ula-Tek\"&gt;Shrine of Ula-Tek&lt;/a&gt;, a massive ziggurat they hold sacred. Forest troll society is patriarchal, though cunning and aggressive females occasionally hold important positions. Forest trolls are primitive, possessing few metalsmithing skills and no knowledge of steam technology though they are masters with thrown weapons, be they axes or spears.\nWith both Lordaeron and Quel'Thalas fallen, the forest trolls see a chance to regain their old empire. They push the borders of their realm ever outward. Warbands strike south, north and west, seeking to reclaim more of their land. The trolls are myriad \u2014 almost 20.000 total, and most of them skilled hunters. They have been fighting for centuries and are competent tacticians. Alone, Zul'Aman has little chance against the Scourge. However, if approached in the right manner (by a tauren or goblin, perhaps) and promised their empire, they may be willing to join an alliance.\nLike all trolls, Zul'Aman's forest trolls are lean, strong and tough. They possess long ears and noses and jutting canines. Their faces are hard and feral. Forest troll hide ranges from dark brown to light green. Many forest trolls wear primitive jewelry, often wood or bone, on their clothing, strung around their necks or thrust through their noses and earlobes. The males often maintain tall, dyed mohawks. Some paint themselves in tattoos. Forest trolls are organized into tribes, with names such as &lt;a href=\"Blackleaf%20tribe\"&gt;Blackleaf&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Treeblight%20tribe\"&gt;Treeblight&lt;/a&gt;, and members of the same tribe are relatively loyal to each other.\nGeography.\nZul'Aman is a temperate forestland of towering trees, dark shadows and ancient ruins and ziggurats. These ruins and odd, stepped pyramids remain from the days of Zul'Aman's empire, but they could be much older, even &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt; or Old God remnants. Elevation rises toward the north, and a hilly region dominates the Quel'Thalas border. The mighty &lt;a href=\"Greenrush%20River\"&gt;Greenrush River&lt;/a&gt; begins in Zul'Aman's &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Abassi\"&gt;Lake Abassi&lt;/a&gt; and exits the region in the southwest crossing the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Eastern Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt; and emptying into &lt;a href=\"Darrowmere%20Lake\"&gt;Darrowmere Lake&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Maisara%20Hills\"&gt;Maisara Hills&lt;/a&gt; to the northeast, are sacred to the trolls.\nPrimitive forest troll settlements are scattered throughout the region. Weathered ruins hide among the trees, covered with vines and the dust of ages. Trolls guard treasure and captives, and ancient ruins of indeterminate origins dominate forest clearings."}

It has since been reworked and replaced by a &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman%20%28instance%29\"&gt;5-player Heroic dungeon of the same name.&lt;/a&gt;\nIt was one of the first instances to require no attunement and was intended to be more accessible to players on tight schedules. It was designed to be more difficult than &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt; and with better &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman%20loot\"&gt;loot&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, the first bosses in ZA would often require Karazhan-level gear, while the later bosses would need significantly better - at the time, even Tier 5 equipped groups didn't consider this a walk in the park. Since the instance only contained six bosses, it indeed required less time than a full clear of Karazhan. Though the Ghostlands region is Horde territory, the area around Zul'Aman was considered &lt;a href=\"contested\"&gt;contested&lt;/a&gt;.\nEncounters.\nThe instance involved players fighting four avatars of the forest troll \"gods\": the bear, eagle, lynx and finally dragonhawk. These gods were channeled into the bodies of four troll warriors. After defeating the four gods, players faced off against the witch doctor that called on the gods, and finally against &lt;a href=\"Zul%27jin\"&gt;Zul'jin&lt;/a&gt; himself. The final troll boss was not only be a powerful foe; he was also able to draw upon the ghostly spirits of each of the four liberated animal gods and change his own shape to access their powers.\nQuests.\nThe Zul'Aman quest chain started in &lt;a href=\"Lower%20City\"&gt;Lower City&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Shattrath\"&gt;Shattrath&lt;/a&gt;, but could also be started near the instance entrance.\nThe instance had multiple quest givers outside the entrance for events that occur inside, including time-sensitive missions (e.g. rescues) that offered differing rewards based on how quickly the task was accomplished.\nWalkthrough.\nTimed Event.\n\"See &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman%20timed%20event\"&gt;Zul'Aman timed event&lt;/a&gt;\"\nThe first four bosses in the zone each had a hostage NPC. Upon entering the instance, a timer started. When it ran out, all remaining hostages were killed. When a hostage was rescued before the timer ran out, it opened a chest with extra loot and added some bonus time on the timer. The feeling was quite similar to the infamous 45-minute Stratholme runs (&lt;a href=\"Dead%20Man%27s%20Plea\"&gt;Dead Man's Plea&lt;/a&gt;) in original WoW. Since the first four bosses could be attempted in any order, there was some leeway for raids to choose a matching boss depending on competence and group make up.\nNalorakk.\n&lt;a href=\"Nalorakk%20%28BC%20Classic%29\"&gt;Nalorakk&lt;/a&gt;, the Bear Lord was the easiest fight in Zul'Aman. He was a fierce creature the size of a &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Gurub\"&gt;Zul'Gurub&lt;/a&gt; berserker with the head of a bear. The encounter was still pretty complex: As the raid made its way up to the boss's platform, Nalorakk sent waves of trash mobs to attack the party, the last of which consisted of trolls mounted on bears accompanied by two trolls. You could not initiate combat with Nalorakk until these last four trash mobs were dead. During the fight, Narolakk alternated between his troll form and a bear form.\nAkil'zon.\nThe eagle-headed &lt;a href=\"Akil%27zon%20%28BC%20Classic%29\"&gt;Akil'zon&lt;/a&gt; in the north-western corner was the second-easiest boss and most raids attempted him next after killing Nalorakk. This boss sent waves of non-elite eagles against the raid as they engaged elite trolls on the way up and fended off elite trolls from the flank (&lt;a href=\"Akil%27zon%20gauntlet\"&gt;Akil'zon gauntlet&lt;/a&gt;). The boss fight required some attention and skillful maneuvering by the entire raid, but after some learning it was rather easy to master.\nJan'alai.\nNext up: &lt;a href=\"Jan%27alai%20%28BC%20Classic%29\"&gt;Jan'alai&lt;/a&gt;, the Dragonhawk hybrid. The path to him was rather uneventful (when compared to the first two bosses), still, packs of fierce trolls and patrols calling for reinforcements offered some challenge. The boss fight itself had an interesting twist. On two pillars, two lairs of dragonhawk eggs were located. If the eggs were smashed, adds spawned from them. During the fight, the boss periodically summoned hatchers to smash the eggs. Although it was tempting to kill the hatchers as soon as they spawn, it was better not to do so and let them crush some eggs, because when the boss' health reached 35%, he spawned all remaining eggs. Besides this, the boss regularly threw a lot of bombs, which the raid had to learn to avoid.\nHalazzi.\nThe last of the animal bosses, &lt;a href=\"Halazzi%20%28BC%20Classic%29\"&gt;Halazzi&lt;/a&gt; the Lynx Lord, was a very hard-hitting melee/shaman based boss. There wasn't a lot of fancy tactics, it was mostly a gear check for the tank and healers. With Kara/Gruul gear alone, this fight was very difficult, and at least some SSC/TK/ZA gear was recommended.\nHex Lord Malacrass.\nAfter the four animal bosses were all defeated, the way to the inner sanctum opened up, leading to &lt;a href=\"Hex%20Lord%20Malacrass\"&gt;Hex Lord Malacrass&lt;/a&gt; and the big man himself. Malacrass earned his lofty title by weaving the dark magic that enslaved the animal gods, but alas, his in-game representation was as inert as the lynx and eagle lords'. The trash mob groups leading to him required some skill to master, and the boss himself needed very good interrupts. Besides dealing large amounts of AoE damage to the entire raid, he frequently casted heals which had to be interrupted by all means.\nZul'jin.\nThe end boss of the instance was &lt;a href=\"Zul%27jin%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Zul'jin&lt;/a&gt;. The fight consisted of five phases, while the boss shifted through all of the animal aspects encountered before. Each of the phases required a different tactic, the key to success was survival \u2014 all raid members had to learn what to do in each phase. To bring him down was the crowning achievement in any Zul'Aman run.\nNotable Loot.\n\"See &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman%20loot%20%28removed%29\"&gt;Zul'Aman Loot&lt;/a&gt; for everything that dropped in the instance.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Amani%20War%20Bear\"&gt;Amani War Bear&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe much sought after Amani War Bear dropped in Zul'Aman as a reward for successfully completing the timed event. At the time it was a very challenging mount to obtain and is no longer obtainable in any way since &lt;a href=\"patch%203.0.2\"&gt;patch 3.0.2&lt;/a&gt;, where it was removed. When &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Zul'Aman was re-released as a 5-Player Heroic&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"patch%204.1.0\"&gt;patch 4.1.0&lt;/a&gt;, it was succeeded by a similar mount with a similar unlock requirement: The &lt;a href=\"Amani%20Battle%20Bear\"&gt;Amani Battle Bear&lt;/a&gt;.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

Left unchecked, the united tribes will reclaim their lands and savor a merciless retribution.\"\nDescription from website.\nSeething with hatred against his ancient enemies in the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, and spiteful towards his former allies among the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, who chose to ally themselves with the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;, Zul'jin rallied an army of trolls and sealed power from the Amani &lt;a href=\"Loa\"&gt;animal gods&lt;/a&gt; within the strongest of his warriors in pursuit for revenge. Zul'jin was slain and his army scattered, but the potent magics invoked in Zul'Aman remain. Now, along with several other tribes, the Zandalar trolls, devastated by the Cataclysm, have come to see Zul'Aman as a symbol of salvation for their people. They have traveled to the ancient forests to see Zul'jin's plan brought to fruition - and, with it, the rise of a unified troll empire, filled with godlike power and prepared to claim dominion over all of Azeroth.\nGeography.\nMuch like its original incarnation, the instance involves players fighting four avatars of the forest troll \"gods\": eagle, bear, lynx and dragonhawk.

Though the Ghostlands region is Horde territory, the area around Zul'Aman is considered &lt;a href=\"contested\"&gt;contested&lt;/a&gt;. The instance entrance is hard to miss, as it is a massive troll structure with large gates. A small camp with a flight path named Hatchet Hills is located near the meeting stone."}

{"id": "147019", "revid": "22514", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=147019", "title": "Zul'Aman timed event", "text": "NOTE: For the current bear mount run in Zul'aman, see the achievement &lt;a href=\"Bear-ly%20Made%20It\"&gt;Bear-ly Made It&lt;/a&gt;.\nAn interesting highlight of the &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt; instance is the Zul'Aman timed event, which is similar in some regards to the &lt;a href=\"Dead%20Man%27s%20Plea\"&gt;45-minute Baron run&lt;/a&gt;.\nOverview.\nEnter the instance and talk to &lt;a href=\"Harrison%20Jones\"&gt;Harrison Jones&lt;/a&gt; to start the event and open the doors. You will now have 20 minutes to defeat the first animal-boss of your choice. Any of the &lt;a href=\"Loa\"&gt;loa spirit&lt;/a&gt; bosses will do and there is no required order, but two of them will add extra time to the timer.\nTherefore you have exactly 45 minutes to kill the first four bosses, which is a challenging task! Guilds that are doing &lt;a href=\"Serpentshrine%20Cavern\"&gt;Serpentshrine Cavern&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Eye\"&gt;The Eye&lt;/a&gt; will likely get three bosses down within 45 minutes, whereas guilds doing &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Mount%20Hyjal%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Battle for Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt; content are the only ones likely to get all four. &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=\"Tier%204\"&gt;Tier 4&lt;/a&gt; equipped raids should be able to get at least the first two chests, until they gear up with Zul'Aman and heroic badge equipment. Note that you must kill the boss before the timer expires. Unlike the Baron timed quest, engaging a boss before the timer expires is not sufficient.\nThe loot from the event is dependent on the number of hostages you rescue. All loot is from the Zul'Aman timed event loot table (see &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman%20timed%20event%23Loot\"&gt;below&lt;/a&gt;).\nStrategy.\nA key facet of the timed event is handling the packs quickly. You should chain-pull every pack, and have different healers conserve mana and rotate drinking. Do not free prisoners during the timed event. All prisoners can be freed once the timed event finishes. They do not despawn, and there is no timer on them.\nThe recommended boss order for this strategy is Eagle -&gt; Bear -&gt; Dragonhawk -&gt; Lynx. The reason is because after you've killed the Bear boss you're standing at the start of the Dragonhawk packs, and after the Dragonhawk boss you are practically staring at the entrance to the Lynx boss. While it might be possible to also do a more traditional Bear -&gt; Eagle -&gt; Dragonhawk -&gt; Lynx order, you lose valuable time traversing back and forth. The raid members should also equip their for faster travel.\nHowever, if your group is just not good enough and still has problems with the first 2 Bosses, stay with the classic order: Bear, Eagle. This will make sure you get at least one, maybe two chests, because depending on your DPS, the Bosses might not die fast enough.\nThe following would be a typical timed event: \nThis way, even a low DPS group can almost guarantee at least 1 chest. It also gives enough time to recover from a wipe and still go for the chest if that should happen."}

All the goods requested are craftable or obtainable through player &lt;a href=\"profession\"&gt;profession&lt;/a&gt;s, with the major raw materials obtainable within the Eastern Plaguelands. The writ awarded from this exchange, and hence the goods the player must supply, is randomly assigned from the choices given in the &lt;a href=\"Craftsman%27s_Writs%23Available%20Writs\"&gt;list below&lt;/a&gt;. However Craftsman's Writs are not soulbound to the player, so the player may choose to trade or sell their writ if they wish, or purchase more preferable writs on the auction house.\nTo complete a writ quest, the player must turn in their goods to , also at Light's Hope Chapel. As a reward, the player may choose either an &lt;a href=\"Insignia%20of%20the%20Dawn\"&gt;Insignia of the Dawn&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Insignia%20of%20the%20Crusade\"&gt;Insignia of the Crusade&lt;/a&gt; and also receive a further reputation increase with the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt;.
