{"id": "27424", "revid": "41371859", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=27424", "title": "Charred Vale", "text": "The Charred Vale is a large valley once a verdant place but now lies mostly in flames and lava in the southwest section of the &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. The exact name of the place prior to being charred is unknown, but it was here that &lt;a href=\"Bloodfury\"&gt;Bloodfury&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Harpy\"&gt;harpies&lt;/a&gt; called their home and &lt;a href=\"treant\"&gt;treant&lt;/a&gt;s roamed the area to protect their forest. The &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Venture%20Company\"&gt;Venture Company&lt;/a&gt; decimated the vale and enraged its spirits and released numerous &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt;s when the vale's guardians, the treants, drove the goblins back. As they left, the treants were probably corrupted by goblin's weapons.\nThanks to the efforts of the adventurers and the &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Sun%20Rock%20Retreat\"&gt;Sun Rock Retreat&lt;/a&gt;, the forest had started to regrow once more, hoping it would again become a beautiful green forest. However, after &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, a nearby dormant volcano erupted, spewing out lava into the vale where it destroyed half the area and opened a path to the &lt;a href=\"Veiled%20Sea\"&gt;Veiled Sea&lt;/a&gt;. Since most of the harpy population was on the western part of this vale, they were likely killed off, except for those that managed to escape in time. The only known survivor is &lt;a href=\"Sister%20Riven\"&gt;Sister Riven&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the destruction's wake are &lt;a href=\"Black%20Dragon%20Whelp\"&gt;Black Dragon Whelp&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Fissure-born%20Fire%20Elemental\"&gt;Fissure-born Fire Elemental&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Black%20Drake\"&gt;Black Drake&lt;/a&gt;s under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Seldarria\"&gt;Seldarria&lt;/a&gt;. \nTraveler.\nRecently, the Charred Vale became the chosen location of one of the &lt;a href=\"Mechanical%20Engineers%27%20Guild%20of%20Azeroth\"&gt;Mechanical Engineers' Guild of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s main events, attracting hundreds of spectators, even &lt;a href=\"Gazlowe\"&gt;Gazlowe&lt;/a&gt;. Gazlowe and his crew took &lt;a href=\"Aramar%20Thorne\"&gt;Aramar Thorne&lt;/a&gt; and his friends to the \"&lt;a href=\"Cloudkicker\"&gt;Cloudkicker&lt;/a&gt;\" and flew them from &lt;a href=\"Tanaris\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt; to the Charred Vale. After saying goodbye, the engineer left them in the Vale and the goblins continued to the MEGA event's location. The children continued north through the smoldering vale for seven hours, and &lt;a href=\"Taryndrella\"&gt;Taryndrella&lt;/a&gt; tried to heal a withered tree, but she was too young to be successful. Dodging dragon nests, they were eventually surrounded by black drakes and whelps. A drake took hold of &lt;a href=\"Makasa%20Flintwill\"&gt;Makasa Flintwill&lt;/a&gt; until it was defeated by the &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Thal%27darah%20Overlook\"&gt;Thal'darah Overlook&lt;/a&gt; while the other dragonkin fled.\nIn the RPG.\nThe Charred Vale was once a tranquil and verdant section of forest, but in recent times a number of fire and earth &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt;s appeared here, burning and blasting the ancient trees. To complicate matters further, &lt;a href=\"Harpy\"&gt;harpies&lt;/a&gt; not only maintain a presence here but seem to flourish. Corrupted &lt;a href=\"treant\"&gt;treant&lt;/a&gt;s also wander the vale, along with &lt;a href=\"basilisk\"&gt;basilisk&lt;/a&gt;s and even a few &lt;a href=\"chimera\"&gt;chimera&lt;/a&gt;s. It is possible that the corruption of the vale is caused by the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s found to the south in &lt;a href=\"Desolace\"&gt;Desolace&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe road to Desolace leads through this vale, and thus it is suggested that inexperienced adventurers invest in a flying mount to travel over this region rather than walking through it on foot. The denizens of &lt;a href=\"Sun%20Rock%20Retreat\"&gt;Sun Rock Retreat&lt;/a&gt; are concerned with discovering why elementals spring from beneath the earth in this vale. It is perhaps due to the &lt;a href=\"ley%20line\"&gt;ley line&lt;/a&gt;s that cross under &lt;a href=\"Mirkfallon%20Lake\"&gt;Mirkfallon Lake&lt;/a&gt; that the elementals are drawn to the area around the Charred Vale.\nSpeculation.\nAn in-game sign pointing towards the Charred Vale has a plank over, suggesting the area was renamed after deforestation. However, there is nothing in the lore that provides us with what it was once named. Due to the harpies living here, its original name could have been the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20the%20Bloodfuries\"&gt;Valley of the Bloodfuries&lt;/a&gt;."}

(aoe ranged is approximately 10 yds.) The Raid will Single Target burn the first single invoker, when that invoker is down, the OT will then taunt the other invoker and position him again away from both the MT and raid (outside of AOE range).

(THIS TANK WILL REQUIRE LOTS OF HEALING!) The OT should taunt one of the invokers away from the main group of mobs that the MT is holding.

(a Raid may be able to Aoe some of these groups, however, for safety we did the targets one at a time since it was our first time in)\nGroup A Roughly 2-3 of These Groups (aoe possible?)\nWith this group it is easiest to have 1 tank hold threat on 1 Invoker and the Assaulter while the other Tank pulls the 2nd invoker away from the first tank and out of aoe range of the Raid. (aoe ranged is approximately 10 yds.) The Raid will Single Target burn the first single invoker, when that invoker is down, the OT will then taunt the other invoker and position him again away from both the MT and raid (outside of AOE range). The Raid will again single target burn this invoker, and when it is down the Raid will turn and burn the Assaulter.\nAn Alternate strategy to use with just one tank is to keep the group all together and have the entire raid focus on one invoker at a time. This will only work if you have people assigned to interrupt their Flame Wave AoE ability.\nGroup B Approximately only 1 of these groups (aoe possible)\nTank these separately burn one down then the other\nGroup C 3 of these Groups total (NOT AOE POSSIBLE)\nThis Group is larger than the others and is the most difficult.\nThe MT should run in gaining some threat on all the mobs. (THIS TANK WILL REQUIRE LOTS OF HEALING!) The OT should taunt one of the invokers away from the main group of mobs that the MT is holding. (again out of aoe range of MT and raid) Single target burn this invoker, then the OT will taunt the second invoker, Repeat with Commander, Assaulter and finally the last assaulter, in that order.\nYou may be able to change the kill order slightly and try Invoker, Commander, Invoker, Assaulter, Assaulter. However, 2 invokers in the Same group are a sure problem, and I don't recommend it.\nYou can use the same alternate strategy here as with Group A. You need to have your OT pull the Commander at least 10yds away so that he cannot use his Rallying Shout ability. You can kill the Commander after you kill the rest of his group. Doing it this way will not be an issue as long as you interrupt the invokers' Flame Wave AoE ability\nGroup D 2 Groups total (aoe possible?)\nSeparate them and single Target burn them down individually."}

{"id": "46349", "revid": "38791128", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=46349", "title": "ChatThrottleLib", "text": "ChatThrottleLib is a small, embeddable library by that keeps outbound chat and addon communication from exceeding the output rate limit in WoW that otherwise causes players to disconnect from the server. It also has a number of features that will help you make your addon communication run smoother!\nBenefits of using ChatThrottleLib:\nChatThrottleLib does:\nCommunications libraries already using ChatThrottleLib.\nIf you are communicating through these libraries, you do not need to worry about throttling at all. And if you are depending on them / including them, ChatThrottleLib is already there and does not need to be included again; you can use it directly for regular chat.\nChatThrottleLib APIs.\nChatThrottleLib:SendChatMessage.\n ChatThrottleLib:SendChatMessage(\"prio\", \"prefix\", \"text\", \"chattype\", \"language\", \"destination\"[, \"queueName\"[, callbackFn, callbackArg]]);\nThe following parameters are the same as the &lt;a href=\"API%20SendChatMessage\"&gt;SendChatMessage&lt;/a&gt;() API:\nThe following parameters are optional:\nChatThrottleLib:SendAddonMessage.\n ChatThrottleLib:SendAddonMessage(\"prio\", \"prefix\", \"text\", \"chattype\"[, \"target\"[, \"queueName\"[, callbackFn, callbackArg]]]);\nThe following parameters are the same as the &lt;a href=\"API%20SendAddonMessage\"&gt;SendAddonMessage&lt;/a&gt;() API:\nThe following parameters are optional:\nNotes on outbound rate.\nThe World of Warcraft servers will disconnect you if you generate too much output. This is not limited to chat output; any type of output can cause it. Some of you may have noticed that holding down your right mouse button and wiggling it wildly for an extended time can kick you off.\nIn my own testing, I've found that a data rate of 3000 CPS will cause a disconnect if sustained for more than a few seconds. There seems to be an input buffer of something along the lines of 32KBytes serverside. Filling it would be what causes the kick.\nA total output of 2000 CPS seems safe.\nChatThrottleLib will allow bursts of up to 4000 bytes and after that throttle its output to 800 CPS, to allow room for actual game events. This used to be 8000/1000 but some servers seem more sensitive than others. See this &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.cosmosui.org/forums/viewtopic.php%3Ft%3D15916\"&gt;cosmosui.org forum thread&lt;/a&gt;.\nChatThrottleLib will also assume that there's a 40-byte overhead associated with sending messages, so if you're sending \"hi\", it will count as 42 bytes for traffic shaping purposes. It's fairly unscientific, I'm assuming it's fair estimate of source + destination + chattype + some envisioned protocol overhead.\n40 bytes seems a bit on the high side for sending data, possibly because the sender does not need to be included (obviously), but it seems about right on the receiving end from measuring actual network traffic (excluding ethernet+IP+TCP headers).\nAs of v11, ChatThrottleLib also assumes that the server-side rate limiter is somewhat cranky shortly after logon and zoning, and only allows a tenth of the normal rate for the first 5 seconds. This is based on observations from &lt;a href=\"PartyQuests\"&gt;PartyQuests&lt;/a&gt;, which used to send the entire quest log (plus texts) to party members - immediately after login if you are logging in to a player still in a party. It has been seen to cause disconnects on at least one server.\nThrottling algorithms.\nThere are two types of traffic shaping going on in ChatThrottleLib.\nPer-stream shaping.\nEach prefix + chattype (+ destination) tuple is treated as a separate stream. Streams output is simply round-robined, i.e. they get the same amount of messages per second. Not necessarily the same CPS though. Doing full-out data rate shaping seemed like unnecessary overhead for very little gain.\nPrioritization.\nTraffic in the three priorities will be fully data rate shaped so that the net output stays at 800 CPS. Higher priorities do not force lower priority traffic out of the way utterly. In a fully loaded system (with full output in all priorities), each priority gets 1/3rd of the available bandwidth.\nIt is fully balanced. Examples of attempted transmit rates and actual output results:\nSee for an illustration of how output in different priorities will be shaped over time.\nIf you would like to see rate changes in action during development, load ChatThrottleStats.lua in your addon. It displays a small string in the top left corner of your screen showing current rate through the library, burst availability, and rate of traffic bypassing the library. FPS based throttling being in effect causes the string to go red.\nChange Log.\nv11.\n\"Aug 25 2006\"\nv12.\n\"Sep 14 2006\"\nv14.\n\"Apr 4 2007\"\nv15.\n\"Apr 8 2007\"\nv16.\n\"Apr 14 2007\"\nv17.\n\"May 27 2007\"\nv18.\n\"Aug 21 2007\"\nv19.\n\"Nov 11 2007\"\nv20.\n\"Oct 15 2008\"\nv20-30200.\n\"Aug 5 2009\"\nv21.\n\"Aug 7 2009\"\nv22.\n\"Mar 27 2011\"\nHow to use ChatThrottleLib.\nMethod 1:\nMethod 2:\nYou're done, and can now use ChatThrottleLib:SendChatMessage and ChatThrottleLib:SendAddonMessage to send your messages!\nThe library has built-in checks for if it has already been loaded, and avoids loading again if so.\nIf your addon has a newer version of the library than one that has already been loaded, it will replace the old version.\nNote that you should never ever take local copies of ChatThrottleLib:SendChatMessage et al, since that prevents proper upgrading, and is likely to cause severe breakage:\n local SendChatMsg = ChatThrottleLib.SendChatMessage -- never ever do this!!!!"}

Aware that such a task would require strong allies, Illidan summoned &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Vashj\"&gt;Lady Vashj&lt;/a&gt; and her &lt;a href=\"Naga\"&gt;Naga&lt;/a&gt; from the depths of the ocean, and with their help made good his escape to the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;. Here he began his search for a powerful artifact known as the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Eye of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, with which he could destroy &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; once and for all.\nHowever, despite the Naga rearguard's best efforts, the &lt;a href=\"Warden\"&gt;Warden&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; along with her lieutenant &lt;a href=\"Naisha\"&gt;Naisha&lt;/a&gt; managed to tail the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Hunter\"&gt;Demon Hunter&lt;/a&gt; across the ocean with a small force of &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt;. Landing upon islands not shown on any of the Night Elves' charts, Maiev realised to her shock that she had arrived in the ancient city of &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt;, sunken beneath the waves thousands of years ago. Pondering upon this, she and her companions began to search the islands for signs of Illidan.\nQuests.\nMain Quests.\nLocate Illidan.\n\"Illidan and his forces are based somewhere on this chain of islands. Hunt him down and put an end to this chase.\"\nNaga Guardians.\n\"The Betrayer has escaped into the Tomb of Sargeras, and you must follow. To gain entrance, you must eliminate Illidan's Naga minions from the Tomb's entrance.\"\nOptional Quests.\nSilence the Ghosts.\n\"Drak'thul is haunted by the ghosts of his betrayed comrades. You must find and destroy the pits from which the ghosts spawn. Within one of them lies the artifact that first raised the Orc remains. Bring the artifact to Drak'thul to show him that the curse has ended.\"\nThe battle.\nAfter safely establishing a base camp, Maiev and her Watchers began exploring the islands which, save for a band of murlocs in the nearby ruins and some scattered sea giants, was largely uninhabited. After a while, the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; began to attack the camp in groups from west and north, but they were easy prey for the &lt;a href=\"ancient%20protector\"&gt;ancient protector&lt;/a&gt;s and skilled archers waiting in the camp. Marshaling enough troops for a counter-assault, Maiev enlisted the aid of &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; shipbuilders to take the battle to the enemy.\nAfter eradicating the western naga camp and setting up a secondary base, Maiev set sail for the northern isles, where she stumbled upon the ancient library of Suramar and recovered the few undamaged tomes she could find. Continuing onwards to the final naga fortification in front of a massive structure, the Warden and her Sentinels made their way past the serpentine defenders to catch a glimpse of their prey as he shattered the gates and disappeared into the temple-like structure. After slaughtering the remaining naga, Maiev brought a contingent of warriors with her as she entered through the gates.\nDrak'thul's Torment.\nShortly after they made landfall, Maiev met an ancient &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; by the name of &lt;a href=\"Drak%27thul\"&gt;Drak'thul&lt;/a&gt;.

Moving quickly through the woods, their skills and senses start working in unison--their twin wills bent on finding their beloved priestess before it's too late.\"\nThe battle.\nPrelude.\n&lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; fell in the &lt;a href=\"River%20Arevass\"&gt;River Arevass&lt;/a&gt; when &lt;a href=\"Shards%20of%20the%20Alliance%20%28WC3%20NightElf%29\"&gt;holding back&lt;/a&gt; a horde of approaching undead on a bridge, Tyrande was washed away by the river deep into &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Maiev\"&gt;Maiev&lt;/a&gt; reconvened with Malfurion and told him that she had seen Tyrande \"torn apart with my own eyes\". Driven mad with grief, Malfurion led a &lt;a href=\"The%20Ruins%20of%20Dalaran%20%28WC3%20NightElf%29\"&gt;furious assault&lt;/a&gt; upon Illidan at the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Dalaran\"&gt;Ruins of Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; after having seen a vision from the local spirits that would destroy the world if not stopped. Illidan was defeated and lamented his loss. Before Maiev could execute him, Illidan told Malfurion that he was attempting to destroy the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, to which Malfurion stated that he had killed Tyrande attempting to do so. Illidan was caught by surprise by this accusation, but &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; chimed in and told Malfurion that Tyrande might be still alive as she was simply swept down the river. Realizing that Maiev had duped him, Malfurion immediately released Illidan and bound Maiev. Illidan proposed that they work together to save Tyrande. Malfurion agreed and the two began exploring the River Arevass to see where Tyrande was. Malfurion was disgusted with the presence of the naga and asked Illidan how he acquired their services, to which Illidan replied that it would be better not to talk about it.\nBattle.\nThey discovered Tyrande and a small number of &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;s, who had jumped into the river after the mistress, in &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt;. They were being attacked by the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; and, although the fight seemed hopeless, the women built a small camp and stood their ground. An air rescue was impossible due to a large undead air force that was flying around. Illidan insisted to Malfurion that he be the one to rescue Tyrande, as he and his Naga could move quickly down the river to her position if Malfurion could hold the Scourge off for long enough. Malfurion agreed to this plan, and the brothers moved into position.\nIllidan and his Naga moved down the river as the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; pressed hard against &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%27s%20Forces\"&gt;Malfurion's Forces&lt;/a&gt;, who contended most of the attack to Tyrande and her Sentinels, however, Tyrande was also hard-pressed by another undead group. Illidan discovered that the river had been dammed by a group of &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;forest troll&lt;/a&gt;s called the &lt;a href=\"Shadowglen%20Trolls\"&gt;Shadowglen Trolls&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Krag%27jin\"&gt;Krag'jin&lt;/a&gt;; his forces massacred Krag'jin and his trolls to destroy the obstruction. The Scourge units were assaulted from the south and were taken by surprise by Illidan's Naga, after defeating that base he marched north and destroyed the undead base that was between him and Tyrande. Meanwhile Malfurion destroyed a base of the Scourge and hold up against another base who sent numerous undead against him. \nUpon destroying the main Undead base responsible for the attacks on Tyrande, he arrived to rescue her. At first, Tyrande thought that he was there to kill her personally, but learned that he and Malfurion had worked together to save her. Illidan created a &lt;a href=\"portal\"&gt;portal&lt;/a&gt; through which he and Tyrande escaped, while their forces fought a way free between the Scourge and joined with Malfurion's Forces.\nAftermath.\nTyrande and Malfurion were overjoyed. Malfurion admited that, if Illidan had not aided him, he wouldn't have been able to save Tyrande. Illidan then travels to &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, just as Maiev arrived and accused the two of letting a criminal walk free. Tyrande attempted to talk Maiev out of it, but Malfurion stopped her, telling her that Maiev became vengeance herself, and prayed that in her zeal she wouldn't cause more havoc than Illidan doing so."}

The series is narrated by &lt;a href=\"Lorewalker%20Cho\"&gt;Lorewalker Cho&lt;/a&gt;.

To the northeast, you'll find a cave where the organization trains their new recruits. I'm interested in what exactly they are teaching these neophytes.\nI only tell you this because you seem to be looking for work. If you're interested in a little coin, sack the cave and return with their spellscrolls.\nThe cave is somewhat hidden: exit &lt;a href=\"Razor%20Hill\"&gt;Razor Hill&lt;/a&gt; from the east, and follow the canyon's eastern ridge.\nRewards.\nYou will receive: \nProgress.\nThe scrolls, &lt;name&gt;, the scrolls!\nCompletion.\nThis is quite interesting. These rites aren't all that different from the spells which are taught to Horde warlocks. This merits further investigation!\nNotes.\nTo find the cave, go to the north side of Razor Hill. Instead of going into the canyon, turn right and go past the fence. Turn left as soon as you are able. Go up the ridge and head north. The cave will be straight ahead at .\nThe Burning Blade in the cavern have a high chance of inflicting Felblood on player upon their death, which \"significantly\" increases Fire and Shadow damage taken if it stacks more than once. Either try to drop the stacks if they get to 2 or 3, or gain 5 stacks to transform into a demon for 30 seconds, granting you increased health regeneration and critical hit rate, along with immunity to Felblood. Do take note, that explosion that inflicts Felblood also deals Fire damage - keep yourself topped up to avoid a mutual kill situations."}

This foreboding realm is also the homeland of the brutish &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s, who wage constant, fierce battles against one another to gain the favor of their merciless &lt;a href=\"gronn\"&gt;gronn&lt;/a&gt; masters.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Once a &lt;a href=\"Tanaan%20Jungle\"&gt;lush and verdant land&lt;/a&gt;, the Hellfire Peninsula is now a dry, barren wasteland rendered lifeless by the dark practices of &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s. It is here that the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; stands, cementing the peninsula's place in history as the site of many pitched battles between the &lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Lothar\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. The nefarious &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; has gathered here also, using the area as a staging ground for its apocalyptic &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;crusade&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Nagrand is the last unscarred region in Outland. It is the ancestral home of the orcs and the heart of early orcish &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;ism. Today it is a fertile retreat where &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt;s commune with mortals on a regular basis. Marauding ogres from the Blade's Edge Mountains, meaning to claim the territory as their own, currently pose the greatest threat to this unspoiled reserve.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Netherstorm\"&gt;Netherstorm&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"The region of Netherstorm was a verdant open range called the Fields of Farahlon until &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; was ripped apart. Normally imperceptible to mortals, the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; bled into the physical realm and unleashed a tumultuous arcane storm that warped the surrounding territory. The &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; are now using the technology of a &lt;a href=\"Tempest%20Keep\"&gt;captured naaru vessel&lt;/a&gt; to harness the storm's magic, further compromising the already unstable land.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Valley\"&gt;Shadowmoon Valley&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"This valley is a grim spectacle of demonic magic run amok. Day and night, molten fel energy erupts from the land and lights the sky with bilious green flame. To the east lies the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;'s seat of power. With the Dark Portal reopened, Illidan and his allies struggle to hold off Legion reinforcements and keep all &lt;a href=\"Dimensional%20gateway\"&gt;other Outland portals&lt;/a&gt; closed.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Terokkar%20Forest\"&gt;Terokkar Forest&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"New hope has come to this ancient forest. Aided by the benevolent &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt;, a group of &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; has rebuilt &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt;. The city has since thrown open its doors to welcome refugees of many different races from all over Outland. Yet the past has not left this area unmarked. To this day, only adventurers and graverobbers visit the haunted subterranean ruins of &lt;a href=\"Auchindoun\"&gt;Auchindoun&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Zangarmarsh\"&gt;Zangarmarsh&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Zangarmarsh is a tranquil area that has largely evaded the demonic influence. The marsh's innumerable lakes and pools are clean of any taint, and most native animals and fungi give off soothing phosphorescent light. Only recently has the area's self-contained ecology faltered. &lt;a href=\"Coilfang%20Reservoir\"&gt;Something&lt;/a&gt; is causing the water levels to drop. The marsh's giant mushrooms are dying, as are the creatures that rely upon the mushrooms for food.\"\nFactions.\n&lt;a href=\"Aldor\"&gt;The Aldor&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"The Aldor are an ancient order of &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s who revere the naaru, and to this day they assist the naaru known as the &lt;a href=\"Sha%27tar\"&gt;Sha'tar&lt;/a&gt; in their battle against Illidan and the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Though they have suffered much at the hands of the blood elves who later became the Scryers, they have put aside open warfare for the sake of the Sha'tar. The Aldor's &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Unending%20Light\"&gt;most holy temple&lt;/a&gt; lies on the &lt;a href=\"Aldor%20Rise\"&gt;Aldor Rise&lt;/a&gt;, overlooking the city from the west.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Scryers\"&gt;The Scryers&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Illidan's ally, &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;, sent a large regiment of blood elves to destroy Shattrath City. However, upon arriving, the elves simply laid down their weapons to the defenders' great surprise. &lt;a href=\"Voren%27thal%20the%20Seer\"&gt;Vorenthal&lt;/a&gt;, their leader, asked to speak with the naaru &lt;a href=\"A%27dal\"&gt;A'dal&lt;/a&gt;. Vorenthal claimed that in a vision he had seen that the blood elves' only hope for survival lay in serving the Sha'tar. The naaru accepted the defectors, who consisted of some of the best and brightest in &lt;a href=\"Sunfury\"&gt;Kael'thas' army&lt;/a&gt;, and they became known as the Scryers. Their dwelling lies on the &lt;a href=\"Scryer%27s%20Tier\"&gt;Scryers' Tier&lt;/a&gt; in Shattrath City.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Sha%27tar\"&gt;The Sha'tar&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Shattrath City, meaning \"dwelling of light,\" was once the draenei capital. When the Burning Legion turned the orcs against the draenei, the fiercest battle was fought there. The draenei fought valiantly, but in the end, the city fell. Shattrath City was left in ruins and darkness until the Sha'tar arrived. The Sha'tar, or \"born from light,\" are the naaru who came to Outland to fight the demons of the Burning Legion. With the help of the Aldor, the city has been largely rebuilt and the Sha'tar have assumed leadership. They have managed to unify the diametrically opposed factions of the Aldor and the Scryers in a common goal: defeating the Burning Legion.\"\nRaces.\n&lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;Blood elf&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"For thousands of years, the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; cultivated a shining, magical kingdom within the forests of &lt;a href=\"northern%20Lordaeron\"&gt;northern Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. But six years ago, the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;undead Scourge&lt;/a&gt; invaded &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; and drove the elves to the brink of extinction. Led by the &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt;, the Scourge drained the mystical &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;, thereby severing the elves from the source of their power. The elves suffered greatly without the Sunwell, for they had become &lt;a href=\"Magic%20addiction\"&gt;addicted&lt;/a&gt; to its &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; energies. Prince &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; renamed the surviving high elves \"blood elves\" in honor of their slaughtered brethren. Led by the prince, the blood elves fought the Scourge until &lt;a href=\"Othmar%20Garithos\"&gt;human prejudice&lt;/a&gt; forced them to flee to &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. There Kael'thas swore allegiance to the demon Illidan Stormrage, and in return Illidan taught the refugees to &lt;a href=\"Mana%20Tap\"&gt;feed&lt;/a&gt; their addiction by draining energy from alternative sources. Thanks to Illidan's teachings, the blood elves of Azeroth regained their health. Today they have retaken much of their homeland. Sponsored by Queen &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, they have chosen to ally themselves with the Horde. The blood elves eagerly await the day Kael'thas will return to lead them into a glorious destiny.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Draenei\"&gt;Draenei&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Recently a terrible explosion tore open the skies above northern &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Dimensional%20ship\"&gt;dimension-traveling&lt;/a&gt; vessel &lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt;, bearing representatives of the draenel race, plummeted from the heavens and crashed on Azeroth. The draenei, or \"exiled ones,\" are the remnants of the &lt;a href=\"eredar\"&gt;eredar&lt;/a&gt; who did not fall to the Burning Legion's corruption. These dedicated servants of the Light were on a mission to gather a coalition of allies that could stop the horrific &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;. Years ago in Outland, the scattered and desperate draenei saw &lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Lothar\"&gt;Alliance forces&lt;/a&gt; drive back the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and destroy the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;. These acts gave the draenei hope, and they began plans to send some of their people to Azeroth on a diplomatic mission. However, due to blood elf sabotage, the Exodar barely reached its destination. Now, stranded a world away from home, the Draenei must establish a new base on Azeroth from the ruins of the Exodar as well as gain the trust and cooperation of the Alliance.\"\nDungeons.\n&lt;a href=\"Auchindoun\"&gt;Auchindoun&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"For thousands of years, the draenei have been interring their dead in Auchindoun, their most sacred temple. However, it was infiltrated by agents of the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt; bent on summoning &lt;a href=\"Murmur\"&gt;a horrifying creature&lt;/a&gt; of immense evil. Their vile act of magic resulted in a massive explosion that blew the temple apart and reduced the surrounding area into a &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Wastes\"&gt;charred wasteland&lt;/a&gt;. The blast also caused a rift in the Nether itself, drawing the otherworldly &lt;a href=\"Ethereal\"&gt;Ethereal&lt;/a&gt;s into Outland. The interred draenei now walk the ruins as restless spirits. Meanwhile, the horrific entity summoned by the Shadow Council threatens to overwhelm their efforts to contain it. You must prevent this evil from being unleashed upon an unsuspecting world. Auchindoun is divided into four wings, and is designed for a party of five characters levels 64-70.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Deep within the Caverns of Time, &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt;, guardian of the fabric of time itself, has awakened. &lt;a href=\"Infinite%20dragonflight\"&gt;Dark, sinister agents&lt;/a&gt; have infiltrated the timeways, attempting to alter the course of the past, present, and future. As a result, the &lt;a href=\"bronze%20dragonflight\"&gt;bronze dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; has begun enlisting heroes to prevent the fabric of history from unraveling forever. You will undertake missions to prevent the sabotage of three key historical events. If any of the then-young Thrall's &lt;a href=\"escape%20from%20Durnholde%20Keep\"&gt;escape from Durnholde Keep&lt;/a&gt;, the momentous &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Mount%20Hyjal%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Battle of Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Opening%20the%20Dark%20Portal\"&gt;opening of the Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt; - were to be altered, the consequences to the history of Azeroth would be disastrous.\"\n\"The assault on the timeways has begun. The balance of time is in jeopardy, and if the past is not saved, there will be no future.\"\nStory of &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"The orc known as Thrall came from unlikely and humble beginnings. He was found as a baby among the lifeless bodies of slaughtered orcs, including his parents, after an attack by human soldiers. &lt;a href=\"Aedelas%20Blackmoore\"&gt;Aedalas Blackmoore&lt;/a&gt;, the officer who discovered and adopted him, decided to raise Thrall as a &lt;a href=\"gladiator\"&gt;gladiator&lt;/a&gt;. He brought Thrall to his fortress of &lt;a href=\"Durnholde%20Keep\"&gt;Durnholde Keep&lt;/a&gt;, which was being used as an orc &lt;a href=\"Internment%20camp\"&gt;interment camp&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n\"Thrall developed both superior fighting skills as well as a brilliant strategic mind during his upbringing at Durnholde. He befriended a human woman, &lt;a href=\"Taretha%20Foxton\"&gt;Taretha Foxton&lt;/a&gt;, who aided him in a daring escape plan. The walls of Durnholde proved insufficient to hold one with Thrall's abilities and resourcefulness-he escaped to find his true calling, that of &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; of the Horde.\"\nStory of &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"The Prophet. The Keeper of Secrets. The Last Guardian of Tirisfal. The mighty sorcerer Medivh was known by these and other names, which is fitting as no single name can encapsulate the significance of his life and deeds to the history of Azeroth. He was corrupted and used by the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20lord\"&gt;Demonlord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; to open the Dark Portal, which allowed the orcs to invade Azeroth - and was subsequently defeated by his own apprentice, &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n\"Even the death of his mortal body didn't prevent him from playing a key role in the Battle of Mount Hyjal. In the guise of a mysterious prophet, he guided Thrall and &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina&lt;/a&gt;, along with &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;, to marshal their forces in an effort to defeat the Burning Legion. After this victory, which preserved the continued existence of Azeroth, Medivh vanished to places unknown.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Coilfang%20Reservoir\"&gt;Coilfang Reservoir&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"The delicate ecology of Zangarmarsh has been thrown out of balance. Unnatural phenomena are corrupting and destroying the marsh's native flora and fauna. This disturbance has been traced to the foreboding Coilfang Reservoir. It is rumored that the leader of this mysterious edifice is none other than the infamous &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Vashj\"&gt;Lady Vashj&lt;/a&gt;. Only you can discover her nefarious plans and stop them before it's too late. Coilfang Reservoir is divided into four areas, three of which are five-man dungeons (the &lt;a href=\"Slave%20Pens\"&gt;Slave Pens&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Underbog\"&gt;Underbog&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Steamvault\"&gt;Steamvault&lt;/a&gt;), in addition to the 25-man raid dungeon, &lt;a href=\"Serpentshrine%20Cavern\"&gt;Serpentshrine Cavern&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Citadel\"&gt;Hellfire Citadel&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"On the blasted world of Outland near the Dark Portal stands the Hellfire Citadel, a nearly impenetrable bastion that served as the Horde's base of operations throughout the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;s. For years this gargantuan fortress was thought to be abandoned... until recently. This very much operation battle station has become inhabited by marauding bands of red, furious &lt;a href=\"fel%20orc\"&gt;fel orc&lt;/a&gt;s. Where this savage new breed came from is a mystery, but what's worse is that their numbers seem to be growing. Hellfire Citadel is the first new dungeon that players will encounter in Outland. It will consist of three complete dungeon wings designed for 5-man groups, as well as an exciting raid encounter.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Karazhan%20%28raid%29\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"The decrepit tower of Karazhan once housed one of the greatest powers Azeroth has ever known: the sorcerer Medivh. Since his death, a terrible curse has pervaded the tower and the surrounding lands. The spirits of &lt;a href=\"Nobles%20of%20Darkshire\"&gt;nobles&lt;/a&gt; from nearby &lt;a href=\"Darkshire\"&gt;Darkshire&lt;/a&gt; reportedly walk its halls, suffering a fate worse than death for their curiosity. More dangerous spirits wait within Medivh's study, for it was there that he summoned demonic entities to do his bidding. However, the brave and foolish are still relentlessly drawn to Karazhan, tempted by rumors of unspeakable secrets and powerful treasures. Forge a group of ten stalwart heroes, and journey to the tower in &lt;a href=\"Deadwind%20Pass\"&gt;Deadwind Pass&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 but be warned that only those who have achieved level 70 should dare enter.\"\nSource.\nThe page can still be viewed &lt;a href=\"https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20070925053807/http%3A//media.worldofwarcraft.com/bc-minisite/index.htm\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; through the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//web.archive.org/\"&gt;Wayback Machine&lt;/a&gt;, but as the Flash Player was deprecated in 2017 and officially discontinued at the end of 2020, it can't be viewed anymore with modern navigators.

It presented information about a variety of things in the Warcraft universe. The original article, formerly located at http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/burningcrusade/townhall/, did not survive the overhaul of the World of Warcraft Official Website. \nThousands of years ago, the exiled &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; landed on the shores of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; and founded the enchanted kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;. These &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt;, as they called themselves, created a fount of vast, magical energies within the heart of their land - the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;. Over time, they grew dependant on the Sunwell's unstable energies - regardless of the bitter lessons they'd learned in ages past.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the villainous Prince &lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; invaded &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; and reduced the once-mighty realm to rubble and ashes. His undead army decimated nearly ninety percent of the high elven population. In addition, he used the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;'s energies to resurrect &lt;a href=\"Kel%27thuzad\"&gt;Kel'thuzad&lt;/a&gt; - a powerful &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Lich\"&gt;Lich&lt;/a&gt; - thereby fouling the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;'s mystical waters. The few elven survivors, realizing that they had been cut off from the source of their arcane power, grew increasingly volatile and desperate.\nIn the midst of the elves' darkest hour came &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; - the last of Quel'Thalas' royal bloodline. Kael, as he was commonly known, knew that the remnant of his people would not long survive without the nourishing magics that once empowered them. Renaming his people &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;, in honor of their fallen countrymen, he taught them how to tap into ambient mystical energies - even demonic energies - in order to sate their terrible thirst for magic. In search of a new destiny for his people, Kael'thas ventured to the remote world of &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; where he encountered the fallen night elf, &lt;a href=\"Illidan\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt;. Under Illidan's tutelage, Kael and his blood elves have regained much of their former power.\nUnfortunately, the blood elves' practice of embracing demonic energies resulted in them being shunned by their former comrades in the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. Thus, the remaining blood elves on Azeroth look desperately to the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; to help them reach Outland, where they can reunite with Kael'thas and achieve the golden destiny he promised them.\nRead more about the blood elves in the &lt;a href=\"The%20Burning%20Crusade%20Townhall/History%20of%20the%20Blood%20Elves\"&gt;blood elf history&lt;/a&gt;.\nTrivia.\nThe contents of this description also appear in the hard-to-reach &lt;a href=\"Saga%20of%20the%20Sin%27dorei\"&gt;Saga of the Sin'dorei&lt;/a&gt;.\nSource.\nThe page can still be viewed &lt;a href=\"https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20061110074555/http%3A//www.worldofwarcraft.com/burningcrusade/townhall/bloodelves.html\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; through the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//web.archive.org/\"&gt;Wayback Machine&lt;/a&gt;."}

It presented information about a variety of things in the Warcraft universe. The original article, formerly located at http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/burningcrusade/townhall/, did not survive the overhaul of the World of Warcraft Official Website. \nNearly twenty-five thousand years ago, the &lt;a href=\"eredar\"&gt;eredar&lt;/a&gt; race arose on the world of &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;. They were extremely intelligent and had a natural affinity for magic in all its myriad forms. Using their gifts, they developed a vast and wondrous society.\nUnfortunately the eredar's accomplishments caught the attention of &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, the Destroyer of Worlds. He had already begun his Burning Crusade to eradicate all life from the cosmos, and he believed that the brilliant eredar would be pivotal in leading the vast demonic army he was gathering. Thus, he contacted the eredar's three most prominent leaders: &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt;. In exchange for the loyalty of the eredar race, Sargeras offered untold power and knowledge.\nAlthough the offer sounded very tempting, Velen had a vision of the future that filled him with sick dread. Sargeras had spoken the truth: the eredar who joined the Dark Titan would indeed gain enormous power and knowledge. However, the eredar would themselves be transformed into demons.\nVelen saw the &lt;a href=\"Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt; in all its terrible might and witnessed the destruction it would wreak upon all of creation. He hastened to warn &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt;, but they dismissed his concerns, for they had been enticed by Sargeras' promises. They gave Sargeras their allegiance and were transformed into colossal beings of depthless evil.\nThe sheer power that &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; commanded made direct opposition unthinkable. &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt; nearly despaired, but his prayer for help was overheard. A being came to Velen and explained that it was one of the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt;, a race of sentient energy beings bent on stopping the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; offered to take Velen and any other like-minded eredar to safety.\nDeeply relieved, &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt; gathered the other eredar who had thus far refused to join &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;. Naming themselves the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;, or \"exiled ones\" in the Eredun language, the renegades barely escaped from Argus, with the Burning Legion only moments behind. Kil'jaeden was furious with what he felt was Velen's betrayal, and the demon vowed to hunt Velen and the rest of the draenei to the ends of the cosmos if need be.\nThe Legion chased the draenei for many thousands of years. The draenei visited many worlds and explored much of the known cosmos in their quest to find safe harbor. Still the &lt;a href=\"Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt; would not give up its pursuit. Meanwhile, the enigmatic naaru race blessed the draenei with Light-given knowledge and power. The naaru explained that there were other forces in the cosmos that would stand against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. One day the naaru would forge them into a single unstoppable &lt;a href=\"army%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;army of the Light&lt;/a&gt;. Deeply affected by the naaru's words, the draenei vowed to honor the Light and uphold the naaru's altruistic ideals.\nEventually Velen and his draenei settled upon a remote and peaceful world that seemed an ideal refuge. They named it &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, or \"Exiles' Refuge\", and there they quietly cultivated their society once again. Ever wary of being discovered again by Kil'jaeden's forces, Velen and his mystics kept their magics hidden for generations.\nIn time the draenei met and befriended the shamanistic orc clans that already lived in the tranquil southern grasslands of &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt;. Aside from engaging in some limited trade, the draenei and orcs regarded one another with respect but kept mostly to themselves.\nIn spite of the draenei's caution, Kil'jaeden discovered their secret refuge on Draenor. He learned more of the world and its inhabitants, and he grew intrigued by the mighty orc race. A plan unfolded in his mind, and the demon lord began to laugh. He could see precisely how to mold the orcs into the instrument of his wrath. It was merely a matter of time and pressure.\nAnd so Kil'jaeden began to corrupt the orcs, first through the elderly shaman Ner'zhul, and then through his apprentice, Gul'dan. The orc clans dedicated themselves to the art of war and joined to form a single, murderous &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Even the wisest shaman learned warlock magics and abandoned the teachings they had once revered.\nSmoothly manipulated from a state of wary acceptance into blind rage and bloodlust, the orcs attacked the draenei. This bloody conflict lasted nearly eight years, but the orcs' triumph was inevitable. The draenei were mighty due to their Light-given powers, but the demon-maddened Horde was mightier still. The orcs killed over eighty percent of the draenei race and sent the rest fleeing for safety to the remote corners of the world.\nAfterwards, draenei who had fought the Horde and survived found that they had been affected by the fel energies wielded so freely by the orc warlocks. These draenei have since mutated into lesser forms, resulting in a series of subspecies. The &lt;a href=\"Broken\"&gt;Broken&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Ones\"&gt;Lost Ones&lt;/a&gt; (as seen above) are two such genetic offshoots. Their warped bodies bear only a rough resemblance to the proud draenei they once were, and quite a few have lost their grip on sanity.\nSource.\nThe page can still be viewed &lt;a href=\"https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20070908131034/http%3A//www.worldofwarcraft.com/burningcrusade/townhall/draenei.html\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; through the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//web.archive.org/\"&gt;Wayback Machine&lt;/a&gt;."}

It presented information about a variety of things in the Warcraft universe. The original article, formerly located at http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/burningcrusade/townhall/, did not survive the overhaul of the World of Warcraft Official Website.\nGeneral.\nWhat does the title of the World of Warcraft expansion refer to?\n\"The Burning Crusade\" refers to the Burning Legion's ongoing efforts to destroy life throughout the universe. To date, the Burning Legion's exploits have been documented in Warcraft III and in our War of the Ancients novel trilogy. As part of World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade, players are able to travel through the Dark Portal to confront the Legion on otherworldly battlefields.\nWhat are some of the features of the expansion?\nIn addition to new races, zones, and dungeons, there are a number of other new features included in the Burning Crusade expansion. Check out the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20070629121216/http%3A//www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/burningcrusade/index.xml\"&gt;features page&lt;/a&gt; for more details.\nWhat is the ESRB rating for the expansion?\nWorld of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade is rated \"Teen\" by the ESRB.\nDo you have to pay any more than the current monthly fee for the expansion?\nNo. While you need to purchase the expansion in order to upgrade, you will continue to have the same subscription options available to you.\nHow many copies of the expansion are needed for players with multiple accounts?\nYou need one copy of the expansion for every World of Warcraft account that you wish to upgrade.\nDo you need to own the expansion to play with friends who have it?\nThere are many aspects of the expansion that are available to all players. However, in order to experience certain content, such as Outland, or be able to play as one of the new races, players have to purchase the expansion.\nWhat content is restricted to those with the expansion?\nThere are a number of features in The Burning Crusade that are only available to expansion owners. To name a few: the two new races, the ten new levels of experience (level 61-70), all of the new zones, and the new Jewelcrafting profession.\nIs there a downloadable option for The Burning Crusade?\nYes. Please go to our &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.worldofwarcraft.com/account/burning-crusade-direct-online-upgrade.html\"&gt;Burning Crusade Digital Upgrade page&lt;/a&gt; to download The Burning Crusade.\nIs there a Collector's Edition of The Burning Crusade?\nYes, there is a Collector's Edition package available. For more details on what's included, see our official .\nWill there eventually be a \"combo pack\" including both the original game and expansion (with the appropriate CD Keys)?\nWe have no plans to do so at this time. However, it's always possible that we will at some point in the future.\nTechnology.\nAll Platforms.\n\"System requirements are subject to change.\"\nSupport.\nWill we continue to receive free downloadable update patches? Will these patches continue to include new content such as dungeons and events?\nYes, we plan to support World of Warcraft in the same manner as before, which means providing frequent content updates for areas of the game we feel are most in need.\nCan we expect the same pace of content releases after the release of The Burning Crusade?\nYes. We'll continue to produce fun and exciting content as quickly as possible.\nIs there content in The Burning Crusade for players who aren't yet level 60?\nYes, there are two new races, each with starting zones from levels 1-20. In addition, the new profession, &lt;a href=\"Jewelcrafting\"&gt;Jewelcrafting&lt;/a&gt;, is available to all expansion players regardless of level.\nRaces.\nWhat new races are introduced in the expansion?\nThe expansion introduced two new races to World of Warcraft: the &lt;a href=\"The%20Burning%20Crusade%20Townhall/Draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; for the Alliance and the &lt;a href=\"The%20Burning%20Crusade%20Townhall/Blood%20Elves\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; for the Horde.\nWhat are the blood elves?\nNo longer trusted by the Alliance, these former high elves have joined the Horde to hunt down the demons that destroyed their homeland of Quel'Thalas.\nWhat are the draenei?\nDescended from the eredar, the same ancient race as Archimonde, leader of the Burning Legion's recently thwarted invasion of Azeroth, the draenei resisted the demonic forces that corrupted their brethren and fled their ancient homeworld, devoting themselves to ending the Legion's apocalyptic crusade.\nWhy did you decide to add the draenei as the new Alliance race?\nThe draenei visited many worlds in their travels and explored much of the known cosmos on their quest to find safe harbor. During this exodus they befriended the enigmatic naaru - a race of beings with a deep affinity for the Holy Light of Creation that empowers the paladins of Azeroth. The naaru blessed the draenei with this power in an effort to help them in their struggle. This makes them a natural ally of the Alliance races who embrace this holy power.\nIn addition, the draenei hold no affinity for certain Horde races. They outright hate the orcs, who nearly drove the draenei to extinction in Outland. And more recently, the blood elves stole technology from the draenei and also sabotaged their dimensional ship, which crash landed on Azeroth.\nWhere did the draenei come from?\nThe draenei's flight from the Legion eventually led them to a remote, peaceful world, which they named Draenor. In time, the draenei met and befriended the native orc clans that lived on this tranquil planet. For many years they lived peacefully with their shamanistic neighbors, until Kil'jaeden discovered their hiding place and corrupted the orcs, pitting them against the draenei. The orcs nearly eradicated the entire draenei race during the ensuing war. Recently, the surviving draenei fled Outland, and a small group of these refugees landed on Azeroth.\nGameplay.\nIs the level cap raised in the expansion?\nYes, the level cap has been raised to 70 from the original maximum level of 60. In addition to the level increase, every class gains access to additional talents and abilities or spells as they advance from level 60 to level 70.\nAre there any soloable quests for Levels 60 - 70?\nYes, there are many solo, group, and raid quests for players leveling from 60 to 70.\nAre there new emotes in the expansion?\nWe do plan to implement new emotes at some point in the future.\nAre there any more player customization options or the ability to change existing features?\nAt this time we do not have plans for additional character customization options. However, it is always possible for the future.\nHas the character limit increased from 10 per realm?\nWe feel that 10 characters per realm is still a very reasonable and flexible number and at this time have no plans to increase this limit.\nAre there realms where only players who have purchased the expansion can play?\nNo. All our realms will host both expansion and non-expansion players.\nRaids &amp; Dungeons.\nAre there new dungeons and battlegrounds included in the expansion?\nYes, there are many new dungeons, both raid and small group, included with The Burning Crusade. A new battleground, \"Eye of the Storm,\" is also included. One new dungeon that we're excited about is &lt;a href=\"The%20Burning%20Crusade%20Townhall/Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt;, also known as Medivh's tower, which is located in Deadwind Pass. Because Medivh has played such a central role in Warcraft lore, we think that a lot of longtime players will be especially interested in seeing what Karazhan contains. As an example of other new locations that may be introduced, we plan on making some of the battles from the past accessible through the Caverns of Time. Also, Illidan's ominous Black Temple will be a fixture in the game as well.\nAre there any new instance dungeons in Azeroth?\nIn addition to the many instanced dungeons included in Outland, the expansion currently has two new dungeons, Karazhan and Caverns of Time, that are located in Azeroth.\nCan you tell us more about dungeon difficulty and how it works?\nNew dungeons introduced with The Burning Crusade have two difficulty options; normal and heroic difficulty. In order to unlock the heroic level of a dungeon, players will need to be level 70 and achieve other objectives. While the challenge at heroic difficulty is much greater, the rewards also scale up accordingly.\nDo 25-player-capped raid dungeons also have the heroic difficulty option?\nNo. The heroic difficulty option is only available in the new non-raid dungeons introduced with The Burning Crusade.\nAre older raid encounters such as Molten Core and Blackwing Lair going to be switched to use a token loot system similar to Naxxramas?\nWe have no plans to adjust the loot system of our previous raid dungeons.\nWill the current 40-player-capped raid dungeons remain capped at 40 players?\nAt this time, we have no plans to change the player caps of our existing raid dungeons.\nWill there be any more 40-player-capped raid dungeons?\nAt this time we have no plans to create additional raid dungeons that accommodate more than 25 players.\nAre there any plans to introduce new outdoor raid encounters, such as Lord Kazzak and Azuregos?\nOne new outdoor raid encounter, Doom Lord Kazzak, can be found in Outland. We definitely have plans to implement additional outdoor raid encounters.\nWill we see changes to the reset times of the pre-Burning Crusade end-game instances?\nIt's possible, but there are no plans to do so at this time.\nWill it be possible to kill Illidan in the Burning Crusade?\nIllidan doesn't think so. As a matter of fact, he's probably thinking about destroying your character for simply entertaining the thought.\nThe World.\nAre there new lands to explore in the expansion?\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Burning%20Crusade%20Townhall/Map%20of%20Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; is opened with the expansion. Players last visited Outland in , alongside Illidan as he conquered the pit lord Magtheridon's domain. Players also gain access to Quel'Thalas, the region to the northeast of the Plaguelands where the blood elves reside, and the Azuremyst Isles, a grouping of islands off the northeastern coast of Kalimdor where the remaining draenei crash-landed after fleeing Draenor.\nWhere is the Dark Portal?\nThe Dark Portal is located in Blasted Lands. Players need to be level 58, with the Burning Crusade expansion installed, to pass through the Dark Portal.\nDo you have to travel through the Dark Portal every time you want to visit Outland?\nNo. Players can bind their hearthstones to any of the inns in Outland. Additionally, all player abilities that allow for travel, such as the warlock's Summoning Ritual, also work in Outland.\nWill there be faster travel methods available to players who wish to travel between Kalimdor and the Eastern Kingdoms?\nThere are no plans to introduce faster travel between the continents at this time.\nDo the draenei and blood elves have their own starting areas in Azeroth?\nYes. Each of these races begins in a brand-new starting zone, both of which are in Azeroth.\nDoes The Burning Crusade include additional content for Azeroth?\nAbsolutely - two new dungeons are available, along with the new starting zones for both the draenei and blood elves."}

For years this gargantuan fortress was thought to be abandoned...\nUntil recently.\nThough much of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; was shattered by the reckless &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;, the Hellfire Citadel remains intact \u2013 inhabited now by marauding bands of red, furious &lt;a href=\"Fel%20orc\"&gt;fel orcs&lt;/a&gt;. Though the presence of this new, savage breed presents something of a mystery, what's far more disconcerting is that the numbers of these fel orcs seem to be growing.\nDespite &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grom Hellscream's&lt;/a&gt; successful bid to end the Horde's corruption by slaying &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt;, reports indicate that the barbaric orcs of Hellfire Citadel have somehow managed to find a new source of corruption to fuel their primitive &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Fury\"&gt;bloodlust&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhatever authority these orcs answer to is unknown, although it is a strongly held belief that they are not working for the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerhaps the most unsettling news to come from Outland are the accounts of thunderous, savage cries issuing from &lt;a href=\"Magtheridon%27s%20Lair\"&gt;somewhere deep beneath the citadel&lt;/a&gt;. Many have begun to wonder if these unearthly outbursts are somehow connected to the corrupted fel orcs and their growing numbers.

It presented information about a variety of things in the Warcraft universe. The original article, formerly located at http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/burningcrusade/townhall/, did not survive the overhaul of the World of Warcraft Official Website.\nChapter 1: The Founding of Quel'Thalas.\nAlmost seven millennia before the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, the exiled &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; landed on the shores of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; to seek out a new home. These outcasts were led by &lt;a href=\"Dath%27Remar%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Dath'Remar Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;, whose surname meant \u201che who walks by day\u201d.\nCut off from the powerful energies of the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; and no longer &lt;a href=\"immortal\"&gt;immortal&lt;/a&gt;, many of the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; died from exposure or starvation during their long journey. In addition to these hardships, the elves were forced to flee the site of their first settlement, &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt;, due to a &lt;a href=\"Zakajz%20the%20Corruptor\"&gt;mysterious evil influence&lt;/a&gt; that drove many of their number mad.\nAs they pressed further inland, the high elves developed a blood feud with the cunning, barbaric &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt;, who controlled most of the northern reaches of Lordaeron. Finally the exiles reached a region whose forested glades reminded the high elves of their distant homeland in &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. The elves drove out the resident &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Forest%20troll\"&gt;trolls&lt;/a&gt; and founded the &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;kingdom of Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;.\nUsing a vial of sacred water stolen from the first Well of Eternity, the high elves created a fount of &lt;a href=\"Arcane\"&gt;mystical power&lt;/a&gt; at a convergence of powerful &lt;a href=\"Ley%20line\"&gt;ley&lt;/a&gt; energies in Quel'Thalas. They named this fountain the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;, and its potent arcane magic fed and strengthened all high elves on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Thus, the city of &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt; was established. The power of the high elves grew, and they cast an enchantment on the &lt;a href=\"Eversong%20Woods\"&gt;forest&lt;/a&gt; that would keep them bathed in eternal springtime.\nElven magi crafted monolithic &lt;a href=\"Runestone\"&gt;Runestone&lt;/a&gt;s along the borders of Quel\u2019Thalas; these massive stones powered a magical shield intended to mask the elves' magic from &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;extra-dimensional threats&lt;/a&gt; and protect the land from invasion. The hard-won peace of Quel'Thalas would endure for roughly four thousand years.\nChapter 2: Arathor and the Troll Wars.\nThirsty for revenge, the Amani trolls eventually gathered together and staged a vicious campaign to destroy the elven civilization forever. The high elves were hopelessly outnumbered. The current king of Quel'Thalas, &lt;a href=\"Anasterian%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Anasterian Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;, desperately sought allies to aid him in the war, and so it came to pass that the king struck a partnership with the human nation of &lt;a href=\"Arathor\"&gt;Arathor&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe elves taught a small number of humans how to wield magic. With these new magi and the armies of Arathor, the high elves succeeded in destroying the trolls\u2019 power base. The &lt;a href=\"Amani%20Empire\"&gt;Amani empire&lt;/a&gt; would never fully recover from its defeat.\nQuel'Thalas had been saved, and so the high elves pledged their loyalty and friendship to the nation of Arathor and to the bloodline of its king, &lt;a href=\"Thoradin\"&gt;Thoradin&lt;/a&gt;. As a result of the alliance between Arathor and Quel'Thalas, the wizard nation of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; was formed, where humans and elves would study magic for years to come.\nChapter 3: The Second War (Warcraft 2).\nThe isolationist elves took little interest in the events of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;. Nevertheless, they provided the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; with token support, for the last descendent of King Thoradin, &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Lord Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt;, commanded the Alliance military forces. The high elves had not forgotten their pledge.\nThen the Horde recruited &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani trolls&lt;/a&gt; into its ranks. Shortly thereafter, the Horde burned down the borderlands of Quel\u2019Thalas and slaughtered many high elf civilians. Furious at this wanton destruction of life, the elves subsequently committed all their resources to the war.\nBy the time the Horde was driven back, however, the orcs and trolls had already achieved their true goal: to steal and desecrate many of the Runestones that powered the elves\u2019 defensive shield. The &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Gul%E2%80%99dan\"&gt;Gul\u2019dan&lt;/a&gt; then used the pilfered stones to power his devious Altars of Storms.\nNevertheless, the Alliance ultimately won the Second War, and most of the vanquished orcs were rounded up and placed in &lt;a href=\"Internment%20camp\"&gt;internment camps&lt;/a&gt;. In the war's aftermath, the cost of rebuilding was significant, particularly when added to the cost of maintaining the internment camps. Without a common enemy, the human nations began bickering over territorial claims. To make matters worse, the high elves abruptly seceded from the Alliance, blaming the humans' poor leadership for the burned forests of Quel'Thalas. High elves gradually grew further and further apart from their &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarven&lt;/a&gt; allies.\nChapter 4: The Third War (Warcraft 3).\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the evil prince &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; laid waste to Quel\u2019Thalas, &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20invasion%20of%20Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;wiping out most of its population and reducing large tracts of the mighty kingdom to ash&lt;/a&gt; in his quest to reach the Sunwell. Yet not all who fell before Arthas stayed dead: his courageous archenemy, &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Ranger-General Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, was raised into &lt;a href=\"undeath\"&gt;undeath&lt;/a&gt; to serve the merciless prince as a powerful, tormented &lt;a href=\"banshee\"&gt;banshee&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;undead armies&lt;/a&gt; closed in on the Sunwell, a high elf named &lt;a href=\"Dar%27Khan%20Drathir\"&gt;Dar'Khan Drathir&lt;/a&gt; (who hoped to gain the favor of the Lich King) aided Arthas by lowering the shields surrounding the Sunwell. Dar\u2019Khan\u2019s treachery resulted in an explosion that knocked him unconscious and scattered most of the Sunwell\u2019s powers.\nThe wizard Borel (also known as &lt;a href=\"Krasus\"&gt;Krasus&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Korialstrasz&lt;/a&gt;) sensed the mystical energy being unleashed and succeeded in trapping a portion of it inside an &lt;a href=\"avatar\"&gt;avatar&lt;/a&gt; disguised as a young human girl, &lt;a href=\"Anveena\"&gt;Anveena&lt;/a&gt;. Unaware of Borel's deed, Arthas then used the remaining energies of the Sunwell to reanimate the spirit of &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; in the form of a nightmarish &lt;a href=\"lich\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the aftermath of the battle, King Anasterian lay dead along with the members of the &lt;a href=\"Convocation%20of%20Silvermoon\"&gt;Convocation of Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;, the high elves\u2019 ruling body. &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;, Sylvanas Windrunner\u2019s second\u2013in\u2013command, assumed temporary leadership of the high elves, for the true heir to the throne, &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Prince Kael\u2019thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;, was still in Dalaran. The few remaining high elves to survive the Scourge's invasion quickly grew ill and apathetic.\nIt became clear that the high elves had become &lt;a href=\"Magical%20addiction\"&gt;addicted&lt;/a&gt; to the Sunwell\u2019s arcane energies. Being constantly suffused in magic had fundamentally changed their race. Now that the source of their magic was gone, they were suffering acute pangs of withdrawal.\nChapter 5: Rise of the Blood Elves.\nPrince Kael\u2019thas was the last of the royal line and a member of Dalaran\u2019s ruling council, the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;. When the Sunwell was defiled, he was studying magic in Dalaran. He returned to find his homeland in ruins and most of his people dead. He realized that the surviving high elves were all suffering from the same lethargy, which had been brought on by their loss of magic. Determined to salvage what he could, Kael\u2019thas rallied the survivors and renamed them the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;sin\u2019dorei, or \"blood elves\"&lt;/a&gt;, in honor of those who had fallen to the Scourge.\nThirsting for vengeance, Prince Kael\u2019thas and the healthiest of his warriors immediately joined the campaign against the Scourge in Lordaeron while Lor\u2019themar and a ranger named &lt;a href=\"Halduron%20Brightwing\"&gt;Halduron Brightwing&lt;/a&gt; remained behind to safeguard the land and seek a cure for their people.\nIn joining the Alliance resistance forces, Kael\u2019thas and his people were met with suspicion and outright hostility, particularly from the prejudiced human &lt;a href=\"Garithos\"&gt;Grand Marshal Garithos&lt;/a&gt;. Garithos assigned the blood elves increasingly difficult missions until Kael'thas was forced to accept the assistance of &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Vashj\"&gt;Lady Vashj&lt;/a&gt; and her &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;. When Garithos discovered that the blood elves were working with the naga, he felt that his distrust had been vindicated. He imprisoned the hapless blood elf soldiers in the dungeons of Dalaran and sentenced them to execution.\nFortunately for Kael'thas, Lady Vashj arrived in time to break the prisoners free. She then led them to the &lt;a href=\"portal\"&gt;portal&lt;/a&gt; that Kel'Thuzad had opened during the Third War in order to allow &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; entry into Azeroth. Kael'thas and his warriors followed the naga through the portal and into the shattered realm of &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. There, the elves met the one being capable of putting an end to their painful hunger: the renegade demon, &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;.\nMost of Kael'thas' group chose to stay in Outland, but &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Rommath\"&gt;Rommath&lt;/a&gt; was sent back to carry a message of hope to those blood elves remaining in Quel\u2019Thalas. Rommath accomplished his mission: relaying tales of a glorious promised land, spreading the teachings of Illidan (teachings which Rommath smoothly attributed to Prince Kael'thas), and planting the notion that Kael'thas might one day return to lead his people to paradise. Rommath has since remained in Quel\u2019Thalas to help rebuild and await the prince\u2019s return.\nChapter 6: Reconstruction.\nMonths later, the traitor Dar\u2019Khan \u2013 now a powerful agent of the Scourge \u2013 returned to Quel\u2019Thalas. There he battled the avatar of the Sunwell, Anveena, and a band of heroes aided by &lt;a href=\"Blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragons&lt;/a&gt;. Despite the magics he wielded, Dar\u2019Khan was destroyed in the end. Under the watchful protection of Lor\u2019themar and Halduron, Anveena has decided to stay in the ruined city and begin the process of renewal.\nOnly a handful of individuals know that Anveena is actually the avatar of the Sunwell\u2019s power. Lor\u2019themar and his people keep this secret tightly guarded.\nMeanwhile, Rommath and the &lt;a href=\"Magisters\"&gt;new order of elven magi&lt;/a&gt; made great progress in tutoring their brethren to manipulate arcane energies. Soon the spires of Silvermoon rose skyward once again, powered by volatile magics. The blood elves have even begun retaking portions of Eversong Forest. Emboldened by the promise of Kael\u2019thas' return, the prince\u2019s weary people now focus on regaining their strength and forging a new path into an uncertain future.\nSource.\nThe page can still be viewed &lt;a href=\"https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20070828081605/http%3A//www.worldofwarcraft.com/burningcrusade/townhall/history-be.html\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; through the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//web.archive.org/\"&gt;Wayback Machine&lt;/a&gt;."}

As its name suggests, it is a land devoid of life.\nBut it was not always so...\n&lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;, the Last &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt;, made his home in Deadwind, in the bright tower of &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt;. Though he was the greatest &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;wizard&lt;/a&gt; of his day (and humanity's intended custodian) Medivh was secretly possessed by the dark spirit of &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras, the Destroyer of Worlds&lt;/a&gt;. Through Medivh, Sargeras opened the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; and allowed the &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;orcs&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;wage war&lt;/a&gt; upon the mortal &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs the war progressed, Medivh fought against Sargeras' control. The raging conflict within him finally drove the wizard irrevocably insane. His childhood friend and the king's lieutenant-at-arms, &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt;, suspected the mage of treachery. With the aid of Medivh's young apprentice, &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;, Lothar stormed Karazhan and killed his one-time comrade. Since that day, a terrible curse has pervaded both the tower and the lands around it - casting a dark pall over Deadwind Pass and the region that is now known as Duskwood\nIn recent years, nobles of &lt;a href=\"Darkshire\"&gt;Darkshire&lt;/a&gt; ventured into Deadwind Pass to investigate the blight that had settled over the region. They entered the dark tower \u2013 but never emerged. In fact, witnesses maintain that the dread &lt;a href=\"Ghost\"&gt;spirits&lt;/a&gt; of the nobles now reside within Karazhan's walls, cursed to revel in the tower's crumbling opera house for eternity. Yet far more perilous spirits reside within Medivh's macabre study, for it was there that &lt;a href=\"Demon\"&gt;demonic entities&lt;/a&gt; responded to the deranged wizard's summons.\nDespite the myriad terrors that lie within, adventurers are still drawn to Karazhan - tempted by rumors of unspeakable secrets that may be found within the tower's arcane libraries. It is said that the vast, magical halls house the powerful spellbooks of Medivh himself. \nOnly one thing is certain when visiting the dreaded tower of Karazhan...\n... you may never find your way out.\nThe decrepit tower of &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt; once housed one of the greatest powers &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; has ever known: the sorcerer &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;. Within its halls and corridors, he summoned all manner of otherworldly beings, researching magics no other would dare touch. Karazhan now stands abandoned; with its master gone, the monstrous things and untamed powers have grown unchecked, waiting to pounce on whoever is brave or foolish enough to enter its halls. Forge a group of ten stalwart adventurers and journey to the wasted land between &lt;a href=\"Duskwood\"&gt;Duskwood&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20of%20Sorrows\"&gt;Swamp of Sorrows&lt;/a&gt; known as &lt;a href=\"Deadwind%20Pass\"&gt;Deadwind Pass&lt;/a&gt;, where the mystical tower lies.

In the upcoming expansion, a new tool for finding a hearty group of cohorts will be available: our new Looking For Group interface! Here's an overview of this new interface, including details on a few of the new ways to locate companions to share your adventures with!\nThe Basics.\nWe've added a new icon on your action bar, next to your Social button. This will open a window that prompts you to indicate whether you want to start a group or join one that's already in the process of being assembled. Depending on your selection, either the \"Looking for Group\" or the \"&lt;a href=\"Looking%20For%20More\"&gt;Looking for More&lt;/a&gt;\" interface appears next. Both interfaces have tabs at the bottom that let you easily switch between the two. The Looking for Group interface allows individual players to be added to a player listing with other eligible players in the Looking for More interface. These players can also choose to be added to a dungeon queue that will match them with other solo players or groups by enabling Auto Join. The Looking for More option allows a solo player or group to search out additional members to complete a group. You can also choose to have other players added to your newly created or existing group for a dungeon by enabling Auto Add members. \nLooking for Group Interface.\nThe Looking for Group interface contains several dropdown menus that let you search for a number of groups at the same time. Each dropdown menu contains category options that indicate the type of group you're looking for, and each category option provides a different list of secondary options.\nSo, using the interface, you can for example be added to a player listing for a quest, zone and a dungeon with the option to Auto Join the first available group for your selected dungeon. The Auto Join option can be toggled off, should you wish to manually search for and accept invitations for your dungeon selections.\nSource.\nThe page can still be viewed &lt;a href=\"https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20071012024117/http%3A//www.worldofwarcraft.com/burningcrusade/townhall/lookingforgroup.html\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; through the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//web.archive.org/\"&gt;Wayback Machine&lt;/a&gt;."}

Following the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; invaded Draenor by crossing through the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;. To their horror, they discovered that &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; - the dark warlord of &lt;a href=\"Horde%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; - had constructed a series of new gateways that could lead the beaten Horde to newer, unspoiled worlds. As the Alliance forces closed in around him, Ner'zhul opened his gateways as a means of escape. However, the gateways' clashing energies resulted in a catastrophic explosion that ultimately ripped the world of Draenor apart.\nNearly thirteen years later - towards the end of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; - the fallen &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt;, discovered that huge chunks of Draenor still existed - floating upon the astral winds of the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;. After his defeat at the hands of the evil &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Prince Arthas&lt;/a&gt;, Illidan fled to the remnants of Draenor and dubbed them Outland. He quickly seized control of the chaotic region and sealed the last of Ner'zhul's cursed gateways.\nThough he is the undisputed ruler of the ravaged land, Illidan lives in fear that he will be discovered by his powerful enemies - most notably Arthas, the new &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, and the remaining Lords of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Currently, Outland is home to a number of scattered &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; tribes, primitive orcs and the powerful, &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; creatures of the Nether itself. Agents of the Burning Legion have also targeted the region as a vital strategic location in their unending &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt; to scour all &lt;a href=\"life\"&gt;life&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;universe&lt;/a&gt;.\nSource.\nThe page can still be viewed &lt;a href=\"https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20070925081924/http%3A//worldofwarcraft.com/burningcrusade/townhall/outland.html\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; through the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//web.archive.org/\"&gt;Wayback Machine&lt;/a&gt;."}

It presented information about a variety of things in the Warcraft universe. The original article, formerly located at http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/burningcrusade/townhall/, did not survive the overhaul of the World of Warcraft Official Website. \nProfession Updates.\nWith the release of \"\", many core aspects of the game will be improved, expanding the choices available to players and streamlining some gameplay elements. For example, new &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"encounter\"&gt;encounter&lt;/a&gt;s are being designed for a maximum of &lt;a href=\"25-player%20mode\"&gt;25 players&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Honor%20system\"&gt;PvP system&lt;/a&gt; will change how honor works in the game. Following this general strategy of making gameplay even more rewarding and expanding the playing experience with new, interesting content, the professions of \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" are also set to receive major updates to ensure that they remain a fun and worthwhile part of your adventures in &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;beyond&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the time came to begin the &lt;a href=\"profession\"&gt;profession&lt;/a&gt;s update for the expansion, the dev team took a very close look at all the work that had gone into the profession system so far. There were some things the team felt could be improved in \"World of Warcraft's\" professions to make them more interesting, more valid, and most importantly, even more fun. The expansion will allow the dev team to upgrade the profession system, and to provide players with cool new gadgets, equipment, and consumables that will help them brave the many challenges of &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn the following pages, you'll find a brief summary of what changes you can expect to see in \"World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade\" for each profession. Keep in mind that there is always a chance that these plans may change, but this is what's on the drawing board at the moment.\n&lt;a href=\"Alchemy\"&gt;Alchemy&lt;/a&gt;.\nWe felt that alchemy needed some way to allow players to specialize in specific areas, but the dev team wanted to avoid limiting the recipes a player could learn. As a result, alchemy specialization will be included with a twist. Alchemists will be able to specialize in &lt;a href=\"Potion\"&gt;Potion&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Elixir\"&gt;Elixir&lt;/a&gt;s, or &lt;a href=\"Transmute\"&gt;Transmutation&lt;/a&gt;. By focusing in one of these three fields, you have a chance to produce two goods instead of one when you make an item belonging to your specialization.\n&lt;a href=\"Blacksmithing\"&gt;Blacksmithing&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe most exciting innovation in blacksmithing will be the ability for blacksmith players to make quality items that only they can wield. A master &lt;a href=\"swordsmith\"&gt;swordsmith&lt;/a&gt; will be able to forge a special &lt;a href=\"sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt; for him(or her)self, and a suit of epic &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; awaits the master &lt;a href=\"armorsmith\"&gt;armorsmith&lt;/a&gt;. The smith will be able to upgrade these special items, so they will always be a solid item for the smith to wear or wield no matter what stage of the game he or she is in. To allow everyone to take advantage of this, blacksmith specialists will be allowed to change their focus in \"The Burning Crusade\".\n&lt;a href=\"Enchanting\"&gt;Enchanting&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe planned changes to enchanting will include many brand-new enchantments, such as the new &lt;a href=\"%3ASpellsurge\"&gt;:Spellsurge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Battlemaster%20%28enchant%29\"&gt;Battlemaster&lt;/a&gt; weapon enchantments, and improved wizard and mana oils. There will even be enchantments that you can cast on your rings, assuming you can find the well-hidden formulae.\n&lt;a href=\"Engineering\"&gt;Engineering&lt;/a&gt;.\nEngineers will discover schematics for many new and intense gadgets from the inventive minds of the Gnomish (and Goblin) R&amp;D labs \u2013 such as &lt;a href=\"Nigh-Invulnerability%20Belt\"&gt;Nigh Invulnerability Belts&lt;/a&gt; and yes, &lt;a href=\"%3ARocket%20Launcher\"&gt;:Rocket Launcher&lt;/a&gt;s. You will be able to use a &lt;a href=\"Mote%20Extractor\"&gt;Mote Extractor&lt;/a&gt; to gather resources from clouds of gas and magic found in various parts of &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. An important tool being added for the raiding engineers is the ability to make various colored smoke flares to mark important locations.\n&lt;a href=\"Herbalism\"&gt;Herbalism&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere will be new, rare &lt;a href=\"herb\"&gt;herb&lt;/a&gt;s only found in Outland, and some will bestow (or inflict) strange effects on the herbalist who picks them. Also, plant beasts roam the shattered lands beyond the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, and their alien forms hold rare ingredients only harvestable by herbalists. You will \"skin\" the plant beasts using your herbalism skill to acquire the ingredients they are carrying, much like &lt;a href=\"Skinning\"&gt;skinner&lt;/a&gt;s harvest beast hides for &lt;a href=\"leather\"&gt;leather&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Jewelcrafting\"&gt;Jewelcrafting&lt;/a&gt;.\nJewelcrafting allows the creation of &lt;a href=\"necklace\"&gt;necklace&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"ring\"&gt;ring&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"trinket\"&gt;trinket&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"socket\"&gt;socket&lt;/a&gt;able &lt;a href=\"gem\"&gt;gem&lt;/a&gt;s. Many items in the \"Burning Crusade\" are equipped with colored sockets, and fitting your item with cut gems will provide you with special bonuses. Also, if you match all the colors on the socketed item with the right types of gems, you'll receive an additional bonus to the stats you get from the individual jewels.\nYou can read more about jewelcrafting &lt;a href=\"The%20Burning%20Crusade%20Townhall/The%20Art%20of%20Jewelcrafting\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Leatherworking\"&gt;Leatherworking&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe improvements to leatherworking are all about more, more, more. There will be more high-end armor sets that provide viable protection even when players make it into the end-game dungeons and raids. The dev team is also adding new &lt;a href=\"armor%20kits\"&gt;armor kits&lt;/a&gt; that are an upgrade over the current ones, fairly easy to make, and a very good alternative when you cannot get that high-end enchantment. There will even be leatherworking leg enhancements that are better than the ones from &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Gurub\"&gt;Zul'Gurub&lt;/a&gt;!\n&lt;a href=\"Mining\"&gt;Mining&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhat mining really needed was a few more types of metal at the endgame, so those have been added. In the expansion, there will be two types of high-end base metals (&lt;a href=\"Fel%20Iron\"&gt;Fel Iron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Adamantite\"&gt;Adamantite&lt;/a&gt;) and two rare metals (&lt;a href=\"Eternium\"&gt;Eternium&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Khorium\"&gt;Khorium&lt;/a&gt;). Also, just like herbalists, miners will find that some of the strange inhabitants of Outland yield up rare materials for the forge-fires when they're slain. Miners will be able to \"skin\" these monsters to gain the materials used by engineers and blacksmiths to make their unique items.\n&lt;a href=\"Tailoring\"&gt;Tailoring&lt;/a&gt;.\nTailoring doesn't have many powerful high-end items, so more are being added for the expansion. You will also be able to specialize in one of three types of tailoring. As with alchemy, each specialization of tailoring will give you a chance to make more of a base material than you'd normally obtain. Also, tailors will be able to make and use a nifty consumable item that should prove to be especially useful in &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt; situations \u2013 the thrown net!\nSource.\nThe page can still be viewed &lt;a href=\"https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20080914114333/http%3A//www.worldofwarcraft.com/burningcrusade/townhall/professions.html\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; through the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//web.archive.org/\"&gt;Wayback Machine&lt;/a&gt;."}

In the upcoming expansion, players will finally be able to play &lt;a href=\"classes\"&gt;classes&lt;/a&gt; that were previously unavailable to their faction. The blood elves have harnessed the power of the Light for their own needs, and the Horde recognizes the value of these renegade &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knights\"&gt;blood elf paladins&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, the draenei have been granted the wisdom and strength of the elements, and a number of draenei now follow the path of the &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;. Read on to learn more about the new class combinations available to players of World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade.\nStealing the Light.\nNot long ago, in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;...\n&lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Prince Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; and his blood elves waited until the newly arrived &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; departed &lt;a href=\"Tempest%20Keep\"&gt;Tempest Keep&lt;/a&gt;. He had little interest in what the naaru hoped to accomplish on this shattered world: it was Tempest Keep that had brought him here. At the prince's signal the elves stormed the dimensional fortress, quickly defeating its automated defenses and claiming its satellite structures. The only real threat the elves discovered was a lone &lt;a href=\"M%27uru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; who had stayed behind to maintain the keep's defenses. With some difficulty, Kael'thas subdued the energy being and sent it to Quel'Thalas so that the &lt;a href=\"Magical%20addiction\"&gt;magic-addicted&lt;/a&gt; blood elves could feed upon it.\nBack in the capital city of &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Magister%20Astalor%20Bloodsworn\"&gt;Magister Astalor Bloodsworn&lt;/a&gt; was not content with this idea. After long months of study and experimentation, he and his fellow &lt;a href=\"Magisters\"&gt;wizards&lt;/a&gt; learned how to manipulate and corrupt the naaru's luminous energies. In the end the wizards devised a process by which the powers of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; could be transferred to recipients who had not earned such abilities. Instead of feeding upon the naaru's magic, the blood elves would wield the naaru's Light-given powers themselves.\n&lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt;, formerly a &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;ess, had recently renounced her vows, for she felt the Light had abandoned her people. She learned of the wizards' achievement and volunteered to be the first to bend the stolen powers to her will. With her decision a new order was born: the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knights\"&gt;Blood Knights&lt;/a&gt;. These renegade &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s are able to harness the sacred powers of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;'s noblest heroes.\nMost members of the Blood Knights were once part of the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Guard%20%28Quel%27Thalas%29\"&gt;Royal Guard&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 proud defenders of &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elven&lt;/a&gt; society who came to believe that the Light had &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20invasion%20of%20Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;failed them&lt;/a&gt; in their hour of greatest need. They see their appropriation of the captive naaru's powers as well-deserved justice.\nAlthough &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and High Chieftain &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; openly opposed the blood elves' methods, they recognized the Blood Knights' strategic value. Indeed, it is likely that the group figured heavily in the Horde's ultimate decision to offer membership to the blood elves.\nBlood elf paladins have swiftly grown confident in their borrowed abilities. Nevertheless, as even the most inexperienced mage will attest, when powerful forces are manipulated against their intended purpose...\nThe consequences can be perilous.\nVelen's Vision.\nIn recent years, &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt;, the noble leader of the draenei, was granted a vision...\nIn it he saw the &lt;a href=\"Broken\"&gt;Broken&lt;/a&gt;: formerly healthy draenei who had de-evolved during the orcs' murderous crusade to wipe out the draenei race. According to Velen's vision, the Broken would rise to power once again and aid their displaced brethren.\nVelen's vision was given substance in the form of &lt;a href=\"Nobundo\"&gt;Nobundo&lt;/a&gt;, a one-time draenei &lt;a href=\"Vindicator\"&gt;Vindicator&lt;/a&gt; who had regressed while the orcs decimated his race and tore the planet apart. Like his fellow Broken, Nobundo had lost contact with the Light, and so he ventured far into the deserts of Outland to meditate and pray for guidance.\nAfter decades of silence, an unfamiliar voice finally answered his prayers. It was not the Light that whispered to him, but the &lt;a href=\"Elemental\"&gt;wind&lt;/a&gt;. The breeze spoke to him of lost truths, of the might of the &lt;a href=\"element\"&gt;element&lt;/a&gt;s--of the delicate balance of power embraced by the &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;.\nNobundo listened eagerly and learned all he could. When he judged the time was right, he departed the desert determined to use this knowledge to help the draenei race. However, most draenei refugees greeted the sight of a Broken with skepticism and outright prejudice. Only one of the healthy draenei did not shun the Broken: the wise and perceptive Velen.\nVelen had heard the philosophy of the shaman before, but Nobundo revealed new truths. The elements were timeless; they stretched across the cosmos to inhabit every world they touched. With the proper training, the draenei might learn to wield this overlooked, seemingly inexhaustible source of power.\nVelen rejoiced to realize that his vision was coming to pass. Accordingly he took Nobundo with him when he and his fellow refugees took possession of the naaru satellite structure &lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt; from the blood elves. Thus it was that Nobundo journeyed with the draenei to the world of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nNobundo found that unlike the desolate wastes of Outland, Azeroth possessed abundant elemental energies. He shared his knowledge of shamanism with the draenei on Azeroth, and all who adopted its path flourished.\nThe time for the draenei shaman to test themselves draws near, for the battle against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; is once again at hand. And the fate not only of Azeroth, but of all worlds, hangs in the balance.\nSource.\nThe page can still be viewed &lt;a href=\"https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20070927181722/http%3A//www.worldofwarcraft.com/burningcrusade/townhall/classcombo.html\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; through the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//web.archive.org/\"&gt;Wayback Machine&lt;/a&gt;."}
{"id": "630878", "revid": "38791128", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=630878", "title": "The Burning Crusade Townhall/The Art of Jewelcrafting", "text": "This article is a copy of \"The Burning Crusade Townhall\", an official article by &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard Entertainment&lt;/a&gt;. It presented information about a variety of things in the Warcraft universe. The original article, formerly located at http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/burningcrusade/townhall/, did not survive the overhaul of the World of Warcraft Official Website. \nJewelcrafting.\n\"World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade\" will introduce a lot of new features to expand the game in many interesting and fun ways. One of these additions is the introduction of a new profession: &lt;a href=\"jewelcrafting\"&gt;jewelcrafting&lt;/a&gt;.\nJewelcrafters learn the art of creating beautiful jewelry and trinkets from metals and rare &lt;a href=\"gem\"&gt;gem&lt;/a&gt;s. By processing the raw ore mined from the various &lt;a href=\"deposit\"&gt;deposit&lt;/a&gt;s and mineral &lt;a href=\"vein\"&gt;vein&lt;/a&gt;s, jewelcrafters can extract gems from the ore which they can then use for their craft. Although miners sometimes find gems while gathering &lt;a href=\"ore\"&gt;ore&lt;/a&gt;, jewelcrafters mostly rely on their prospecting skills to get more of the precious stones.\nJewelcrafters work with gems in many different ways. If a jewelcrafter uses gems to create jewelry, he usually only needs the raw, uncut stones for his work. These &lt;a href=\"ring\"&gt;ring&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"amulet\"&gt;amulet&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"trinket\"&gt;trinket&lt;/a&gt;s function just like those that can already be found in the game, with a few notable exceptions. For example, jewelcrafters can learn to create gemmed figurines that they can carry in their trinket slots. While these figurines all provide passive benefits, they can also be used to provide the player with a short buff \u2013 just enough to give you that little damage boost or maybe that quick burst of extra healing power you may need in a tricky situation. These figurines will bind when picked up, so only jewelcrafters will be able to use their powers.\nAnother way jewelcrafters can use gems is by cutting them, preparing them to be used in &lt;a href=\"socket\"&gt;socket&lt;/a&gt;ed items. Gems come in many different colors and shapes. Different types of gems have different basic properties, and a gem's cut also determines the effect this gem will have. Jewelcrafters can learn several types of cuts for each kind of gem: the &lt;a href=\"%3AAzure%20Moonstone\"&gt;:Azure Moonstone&lt;/a&gt;, for example, can be cut into a lustrous, stormy, solid, or sparkling Azure Moonstone, and each one of these cuts offers different bonuses when used in a socketable item. Placing cut gems into an item's sockets will add the bonuses of these gems to those of the item, allowing players to customize their equipment to better suit their individual play style or the different roles their class can fulfill.\nAt higher levels, socketed items and specially cut gems become an important part of an adventurer's \"bag of tricks\". Both armor and weapons can have sockets. Some socketed items can be found in dungeons, but the expansion will also introduce a lot of new recipes for all the professions, including many recipes that let &lt;a href=\"leatherworker\"&gt;leatherworker&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"blacksmith\"&gt;blacksmith&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Tailoring\"&gt;tailor&lt;/a&gt;s create socketed items. Socketed items can be of , , or even quality. An item's sockets can also have a specific color; if you put a gem of a matching color in each socket, the item will reward you with a special stat bonus beyond the gems' regular effects. However, you can also put gems of a different color in these slots if you would rather have a specific gem's effect instead of the added bonus.\nSocketing.\nAny &lt;a href=\"character\"&gt;character&lt;/a&gt; can insert gems into an item's sockets \u2013 you do not need to be a jewelcrafter to do that. However, you will need to ask a jewelcrafter or become one yourself to obtain most of the gems you can socket. Another source of cut gems are the expansion's high-level bosses. There are rumors that some of these monsters hold stones with powers beyond those of regular gems, but getting your hands on these jewels might prove to be a most formidable challenge; it seems unlikely that their owners would part with their precious stones willingly.\nOn the right side, you can see a preview of the current item-socketing interface from the game. When you shift-right click a socketed item, this box will appear, displaying the item's current stats and any gem effects that are currently on the item. You can add new gems to the item by placing one of the gems from your inventory into one of the item's sockets. The interface allows you to play around with different gem configurations, so you can try out how different gems will affect your item before you decide on what gems you want to socket. Once you have found a configuration you like, you can press the \"Socket Gems\" button to socket the gems you picked.\nSocketing gems will lock them into place, and there is no way to remove a gem once it has been socketed. You can put a new gem into a socket that already holds a gem, but by doing so you break the old one out of its socket, shattering the gem and making it unusable. This allows you to add gems to your new socketed items right away without having to wait until you find the \"perfect\" collection of gems, since you always have the option of upgrading your item later.\nTry putting some gems from your inventory into the socketed item and check out how they affect its stats; this should give you an idea of how socketing will work in the expansion, but please keep in mind that both the stats and the interface presented here may change as we progress further in the development of the new jewelcrafting and item-socketing features of \"\".\nSource.\nThe page can still be viewed &lt;a href=\"https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20070908131034/http%3A//www.worldofwarcraft.com/burningcrusade/townhall/draenei.html\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; through the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//web.archive.org/\"&gt;Wayback Machine&lt;/a&gt;."}

It succeeded the &lt;a href=\"The%20World%20of%20Warcraft%20Bestiary\"&gt;World of Warcraft Bestiary&lt;/a&gt; and was followed by the &lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20the%20Lich%20King%20Expansion%20Features/Bestiary\"&gt;Wrath of the Lich King Bestiary&lt;/a&gt;. The original article did not survive the overhaul of the World of Warcraft Official Website, but can still be viewed through online archives (see &lt;a href=\"%23Source\"&gt;below&lt;/a&gt;). \nBestiary.\n&lt;a href=\"Demon\"&gt;Demon&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s, oh my...&lt;br&gt;\n will introduce a whole new world and many new dungeons to the game. A multitude of strange, wondrous and terrifying creatures inhabit these wild, untamed lands. This page contains a few of the many new monsters that make up the vast and varied bestiary of the Burning Crusade. From arcane thieves to savage demigods, from nightmares of an ancient past to magnificent beasts never seen before, they all can be discovered in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; and the still unexplored lands of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Broken\"&gt;The Broken&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s of Outland were not the only ones to suffer the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s demonic corruption. The Broken, led by the great &lt;a href=\"Akama\"&gt;Akama&lt;/a&gt;, fell prey to the demons' sinister influence, and just like the orcs, they too were changed by the corruption. Though they lost some of their former powers, the Broken still present a clear danger to all of &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan's&lt;/a&gt; enemies throughout Outland. It almost seems like a miracle that the Broken somehow managed to preserve their &lt;a href=\"Shaman\"&gt;shamanistic&lt;/a&gt; heritage, yet no one can say for sure how many of their traditions are still intact. From the safety of the fortified villages the Broken hold in Outland, they lord over their lesser cousins, the wretched &lt;a href=\"Lost%20One\"&gt;Lost One&lt;/a&gt;s.\n&lt;a href=\"Eredar\"&gt;Eredar&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe eredar are one of the oldest known races in the universe. They comprise the commanders and strategists of the Burning Legion. Exceptionally skilled in magic, their mastery of the &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; arts is renowned throughout the scattered worlds of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;Great Dark Beyond&lt;/a&gt;. The likes of &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;, feared and loathed for their unmatched cruelty and cunning, are among the more infamous members of the eredar race \u2013 the vanguard of an unstoppable, demonic army bent on universal annihilation.\n&lt;a href=\"Ethereal\"&gt;Ethereal&lt;/a&gt;s.\nTreading the chaotic spaces between worlds, the ethereals are astral travelers who dwell within the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;. They are known to be collectors and traders of arcane items and artifacts. Now drawn to Outland, many ethereals are seeking to track down its treasures and steal them back into the Twisting Nether. They are liars and scoundrels who will stop at nothing to pursue their mysterious aims. The ethereals have no care at all for the Burning Crusade. They would even play both sides of the conflict against each other if doing so would serve to further their own goals.\n&lt;a href=\"Fel%20orc\"&gt;Fel Orcs&lt;/a&gt;.\nMystery and speculation surround the corrupted fel orcs who recently appeared in Outland. Though little is known about these savage warriors, the most disturbing revelation to come to light is that their numbers appear to be steadily increasing. Even more perplexing is the fact that the orcs have discovered some alternate source of fel energies to feed upon, despite the slaying of &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s subsequent release from demonic corruption. Regardless of their connection to &lt;a href=\"Fel\"&gt;fel energies&lt;/a&gt;, however, it is believed that this new breed is not working with the Burning Legion. What authority they do answer to remains a mystery.\n&lt;a href=\"Fleshbeast\"&gt;Fleshbeast&lt;/a&gt;s.\nIt is said that the sleep of reason produces monsters, that fantasy abandoned by sanity brings forth creatures of nightmare. For most, the horrors of their sleeping hours cannot follow them into the waking world; yet some are haunted by them even long after the veils of sleep have parted. The mindless fleshbeasts were brought into this world by &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;, summoned from some unspeakable place beyond. Once, the wizard used the fleshbeasts in his clandestine experiments within the laboratories of &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt;. Medivh is gone, but the slavering, hungering creatures of his twisted nightmares still remain, forever stalking the gloomy shadows of Karazhan.\n&lt;a href=\"Forest%20troll\"&gt;Forest Trolls&lt;/a&gt;.\nLong before the rise and fall of the kingdoms of men, the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Forest%20troll\"&gt;trolls&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; had built an enormous &lt;a href=\"Amani%20Empire\"&gt;troll empire&lt;/a&gt;. After centuries of war and hate, an alliance of &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;elves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s finally dealt a crushing blow to the Amani when they defeated a great troll army at the foot of the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. The empire did not recover from the defeat, and the trolls never rose as one nation again. Yet some forest trolls survived, each generation nurturing their hatred of the elves in the &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;dark forests&lt;/a&gt; of the north for thousands of years. During the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, the Amani trolls were briefly allied to the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, and the forest troll &lt;a href=\"Zul%27jin\"&gt;Zul'jin&lt;/a&gt; was one of the greatest heroes the trolls have ever known.\n&lt;a href=\"Fungal%20giant\"&gt;Fungal Giants&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe unique gases and nutrient-enriched soil of &lt;a href=\"Zangarmarsh\"&gt;Zangarmarsh&lt;/a&gt; have given rise to a wondrous, diverse wetland ecology. The marsh's fungal giants stand as a prime example of the habitat's remarkable fauna. Though relatively non-aggressive, these lumbering behemoths are savagely efficient at dispatching their adversaries when provoked. They feed on other native swamp creatures, as well as any Lost Ones unlucky enough to stray too close to the giants' beloved hideaways.\n&lt;a href=\"Gronn\"&gt;Gronn&lt;/a&gt;.\nMonstrous. Cyclopean. Terror incarnate. Words cannot begin to describe the terrible gronn of Outland. Some say the gronn gave rise to the lesser &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s, yet if so, the gronn show but little love for their offspring, lording over the ogre clans with an iron fist. Though they are not famed for their intelligence, such rumors are cold comfort in light of the undeniable fact that the gronn wield devastating power.\n&lt;a href=\"Naaru\"&gt;Naaru&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; descended upon the eredar's &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;homeworld&lt;/a&gt;, a race of sentient energy beings \u2013 the naaru \u2013 helped a small band of eredar to escape the dark titan's corruption. Soon the eredar refugees began calling themselves the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;, or \"exiled ones\". Moved by the draenei's courage, the naaru blessed them with &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;-given knowledge and power. Ultimately the benevolent naaru hoped to unite all who opposed the Burning Legion and forge these heroes into a single unstoppable &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;army of the Light&lt;/a&gt;. In pursuit of that goal, the naaru have recently traveled to Outland in a dimensional fortress known as &lt;a href=\"Tempest%20Keep\"&gt;Tempest Keep&lt;/a&gt;. Most of the naaru disembarked to reconnoiter the ravaged land. In their absence, an army of &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Prince Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; overran the keep and took its sole remaining guardian hostage. With Tempest Keep in blood elf hands, the naaru find themselves stranded in Outland, facing a precarious future.\n&lt;a href=\"Ogre%20lord\"&gt;Ogre Lords&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is believed that the massive, cyclopean gronn are the ancient ancestors of the ogres. If so, the ogre lords of Outland are the only ogres known to retain some of the physical traits of their gronn progenitors, such as the bony, calcified protrusions on their head and back, as well as a portion of the gronn's immense size and strength. Other unique characteristics possessed by the ogre lords are their intelligence and reasoning abilities, which are more acute than those of their ogre cousins. This combination of brute strength and increased intellect make the ogre lords worthy of both respect... and fear.\n&lt;a href=\"Ravager\"&gt;Ravager&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThese predatory beasts are found all across Outland, often lurking behind rocky clusters and towering escarpments, waiting to pounce on any prey foolhardy enough to wander within striking range of their blindingly fast, razor-sharp claws. Whether or not these creatures were mutated by the volatile energies unleashed when &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;'s multiple &lt;a href=\"portal\"&gt;portal&lt;/a&gt;s ripped Outland apart is still a source of speculation. One thing, however, is for certain: these vicious carnivores are not to be trifled with.\n&lt;a href=\"Rock%20flayer\"&gt;Rock Flayers&lt;/a&gt;.\nRock flayers are one of Outland's indigenous species. Many careless wanderers have been killed by the primitive humanoids who roam the slopes and peaks of the &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Blade's Edge Mountains&lt;/a&gt; in murderous packs. Though they primarily hunt smaller mountain animals, they are not afraid of stalking potential prey that is much bigger than they are. There are accounts of packs of rock flayers taking down even mighty &lt;a href=\"elekk\"&gt;elekk&lt;/a&gt; that had wandered into the rock flayers' territory. Their vicious blade scythes and climbing claws are so sharp they can even cut through sheer rock, enabling the rock flayers to climb the most difficult overhangs with ease. Even for a predatory species, they are extremely fast and very aggressive.\n&lt;a href=\"Sporebat\"&gt;Spore Bats&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe deadly spore bats are a more highly evolved sub-species of the &lt;a href=\"spore%20walker\"&gt;spore walker&lt;/a&gt;s. Like their walker cousins, the spore bats draw ingredients from the environment and combine them to form virulent &lt;a href=\"Poison\"&gt;toxins&lt;/a&gt; used in subduing the spore bats' prey. Unlike the walkers, however, the spore bats have the added advantage of flight in their arsenal. No corner of Zangarmarsh is safe as long as these silently gliding death-dealers are on the prowl.\n&lt;a href=\"Spore%20walker\"&gt;Spore Walkers&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is believed that the spore walkers evolved over time from the simple organisms that dwell within the depths of Zangarmarsh into the more efficient hunting, killing and eating machines that they are today. Utilizing their environment, the spore walkers are able to derive toxins from the spores and &lt;a href=\"Fungus\"&gt;fungi&lt;/a&gt; of the marsh, which they in turn use to stun or immobilize their prey. When traveling through the marsh, adventurers would be wise to steer clear of these highly accomplished predators.\n&lt;a href=\"Warpstalker\"&gt;Warp Stalkers&lt;/a&gt;.\nWarp stalkers are crafty, predatory hunters indigenous to &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; that have been corrupted by the Burning Legion. Some reports even suggest that Legion officers employ the stalkers as mounts, utilizing the creatures' uncanny abilities to phase in and out of the physical and astral dimensions at will. Unbound by the constraints of physical reality, these powerful, mystical creatures often range far and wide: almost no realm is out of reach.\nSource.\nThe bestiary can still be viewed &lt;a href=\"http%3A//web.archive.org/web/20101124173644/http%3A//www.worldofwarcraft.com/burningcrusade/townhall/bestiary.html\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; through &lt;a href=\"http%3A//web.archive.org/\"&gt;http://web.archive.org/&lt;/a&gt;.

It presented information about a variety of things in the Warcraft universe. The original article, formerly located at http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/story/index.html, did not survive the overhaul of the World of Warcraft Official Website. \nThe Isle of Quel'Danas.\nAlthough the war against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; continues to rage on &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, the latest front has emerged on Azeroth itself. The &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Isle of Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt;, located in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;, has become the Legion's most recent target in its ongoing mission of destruction. &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;, former leader of the blood elves, has revealed himself as the Legion's formidable new ally. Despite furious opposition from his own people, Kael'thas persists in his efforts, believing that he will obtain infinite power.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sunstrider\"&gt;Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; dynasty began ruling the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt;, also known as quel'dorei, after their departure from &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; long ago. Unlike their &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; ancestors, the high elves continue to embrace arcane magic in all aspects of their lives. Using a vial of sacred water stolen from the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;, they established a new source of power for their people: the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;. Though weaker than its source, it bathed the high elves in magical energy for thousands of years, allowing them to prosper in their new homeland.\nBut the Sunwell's great power ultimately became a liability. After his corruption by the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; army stormed through the high elf kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, destroying &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt; to gain access to the Sunwell. Arthas used the Sunwell's magic to revive the necromancer &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;, and the fountain's energies were irrevocably defiled.\nThe quel'dorei suffered many devastating losses at the hands of the Scourge. King &lt;a href=\"Anasterian%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Anasterian Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; was among the countless dead, leaving his son, Kael'thas, to lead the harrowed survivors. An exceptional scholar of magic, Prince Kael'thas understood that the Sunwell's contamination would eventually destroy his people. Faced with a terrible dilemma, he chose to destroy the Sunwell.\nIn the wake of these tragedies, most of the surviving high elves gathered under Kael'thas, and he renamed them the &lt;a href=\"sin%27dorei\"&gt;sin'dorei&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 \"children of the blood,\" more commonly known as blood elves \u2013 in memory of their fallen kin. Already burdened by grief, the blood elves weakened even further after being deprived of arcane energy. Lengthy exposure had made them dependent on magic, and some of the most fragile sin'dorei died from acute withdrawal. Although many of the healthier elves were capable of fighting their addiction, Kael'thas became preoccupied with finding a cure.\nIncreasing tensions with the Alliance complicated his hopes, leading the prince to side with &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Vashj\"&gt;Lady Vashj&lt;/a&gt; in Outland. In return for Kael'thas' support, Illidan taught him how to siphon arcane energy from alternative sources to satisfy his cravings. Kael'thas passed these techniques along to his people in Quel'Thalas, who were led by &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; in his absence. Though far from ideal, draining magic in this way alleviated the high elves' symptoms for short intervals.\nDissatisfied with the limits of arcane magic, the prince began consuming fel energy to acquire even greater power. &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the Burning Legion, began to secretly entice Kael'thas with promises of salvation for the blood elves. The prince's actions became increasingly controversial among some of the sin'dorei in Outland, who eventually banded against him. They settled in &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt;, calling themselves the &lt;a href=\"Scryers\"&gt;Scryers&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter learning about the blood elf prince's transgressions, Azeroth's heroes attacked him in &lt;a href=\"Tempest%20Keep\"&gt;Tempest Keep&lt;/a&gt;, a fortress he had stolen from the naaru. Kael'thas suffered a horrific loss, barely managing to survive the defeat. Though brutally injured and deformed, the prince publicly declared his total allegiance to the Burning Legion. Since then he has assisted with the invasion of the Isle of Quel'Danas, his actions allowing the Legion's demons to seize control of the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell%20Plateau\"&gt;Sunwell Plateau&lt;/a&gt;, the home of the ancient fountain.\nWhen Kael'thas destroyed the magical reservoir, some of its essences lingered in the surrounding lands. The red dragon &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Korialstrasz&lt;/a&gt; gathered these remnants and disguised them as a human girl named &lt;a href=\"Anveena%20Teague\"&gt;Anveena Teague&lt;/a&gt;. For a time, she managed to live in safety, and she even developed her own personality and emotions. However, the Burning Legion learned of her existence and is now holding her captive in the Sunwell Plateau. With her immense power the Legion has opened a portal strong enough to facilitate Kil'jaeden's materialization on Azeroth.\nFighters from Shattrath City have joined together as the &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Sun%20Offensive\"&gt;Shattered Sun Offensive&lt;/a&gt;, journeying to the Isle of Quel'Danas to prevent the Legion's invasion. Although the Shattered Sun Offensive's outpost is constantly besieged, the defenders offer their support to adventurers launching assaults on the Sunwell Plateau and Kael'thas' stronghold, &lt;a href=\"Magisters%27%20Terrace\"&gt;Magisters' Terrace&lt;/a&gt;. But this desperate coalition may not be enough to counter the terrible power of the Burning Legion's supreme commander as he forces his way into Azeroth. \nSource.\nThe page can still be viewed &lt;a href=\"https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20100207213153/http%3A//www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/story/isleofqueldanas.html\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; through the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//web.archive.org/\"&gt;Wayback Machine&lt;/a&gt;."}

Just that Kil'jaeden was cut off from Azeroth but not indefinitely. Yet with the threat of war between Horde and Alliance, and continuing danger of the scourge, they could not prepare for a war that could happen millennia in the future, when danger was already happening around them.\"\n\"With the portal newly opened, people had to reevaluate their priorities. Draenor had not been destroyed, but had become outland, where Illidan Stormrage is fighting to solidify his power base. Many of the loved ones they had thought perished with Draenor were still alive. Tracts of land were left untouched by fel magic or Ner'zhul's reckless sorcery. Recently, horde and alliance have gained new allies in the blood elves and draenei.\"\n\"With the reactivation of the portal, it has become a double-edged sword. Illidan and his forces are fighting to keep all the other portals in Outland closed, but his loyalties remain in question. Should even one of the portals open, the forces of the Legion would invade Outland. Their inevitable triumph over Illidan would set off a chain reaction, with countless more worlds falling to the legion, Azeroth would have little hope.\"\n\"To prevent such a scenario, the people of Azeroth have sent out scouts to bring back information from outland. They now understand the current layout and disposition of the enemies in Outland. They have compiled maps, bestiaries, and strategies. Knowledge that is key to the conquest of Outland.\"\n\"Unfortunately tensions between Horde and Alliance remain, and they cannot be set aside lightly. The narrator thinks of the lives lost and grieves bitterly. He wishes to kill, but cannot afford to be blinded by bloodlust. He remembers that it was the Burning Legion that first set his people at one another's throats. He cannot permit the burning crusade to engulf other worlds. He must bring the war to an end, and find a way.\""}

Abused and beaten from his earliest days, the hardship only strengthened his body even as it broke his mind. Now there is not an ogre in Highmaul who will not give him a wide berth as he hacks away at slaughtered carcasses to pass his days.\"\nOverview.\nThe Butcher attacks relentlessly, hacking at his foes with his dual implements of destruction. His main abilities seek to target large clumps of enemies, and positioning is key to handling and overcoming his attacks.\nAbilities.\n&lt;a href=\"Night-Twisted%20Cadaver\"&gt;Night-Twisted Cadaver&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn Mythic Difficulty, Night-Twisted Cadavers will spawn and walk towards The Butcher in a final, vain attempt to slay him. When the Cadaver reaches The Butcher or when they walk near a player, they will Explode, leaving a pool of Pale Vitriol behind for the duration of the encounter.\nStrategy.\nThe Butcher encounter is a very simple single-phase fight that is frequently compared with &lt;a href=\"Patchwerk\"&gt;Patchwerk&lt;/a&gt;; it has very few mechanics and the main challenge of the encounter is an extremely tight &lt;a href=\"enrage%20%28mechanic%29\"&gt;enrage&lt;/a&gt; timer necessitating very high DPS from all members of the raid.\nNormal / Heroic.\nPreparation / Managing Cleave.\nPrior to the pull, the raid leader will generally assign three groups, two of which will stack separately in melee range to soak Cleave, the third will stack at range to bait in Bounding Cleave and the fourth will contain the two tanks.\nThe only major mechanic of the fight to be managed by the DPS is Cleave which applies the debuff Gushing Wounds. If any member of the raid reaches five stacks of this debuff they will instantly die. The normal strategy for the fight is to have two groups assigned to stack in melee, which will stack on the boss's backside behind each of his feet, one group on the side of the left foot and the other on the side of the right foot.\nCleave hits the largest clump of players near him so these groups must contain at least 3 players to ensure Cleave will not inadvertently hit the tanks. In order to control the flow of stacks onto the raid and ensure stacks will fall off, the raid leader must assign two \"trigger\" characters, one for each group, that will move in and out of their respective stack points to force the boss to either target their group or target the other group. For example, if Group 1's trigger is John and Group 2's trigger is Mary, when it's Group 1's turn to soak Cleave John will stack with his group and Mary will move out of her group, causing the Butcher to hit Group 1 with all of the Cleaves, then when it is Group 2's turn to soak Cleave John will move out of his group and Mary will move into hers, forcing the Butcher to use Cleave on Group 2 instead. Prior to the Frenzy, the groups should be alternating at 2 stacks, but after the Frenzy the Butcher's increased attack speed will require alternating on 3 stacks.\n&lt;a href=\"Hunter\"&gt;Hunter&lt;/a&gt;s are particularly desired for their ability to act as triggers as moving into and out of their group is generally not a DPS loss, though other mobile ranged DPS or healers can be used as well if qualified hunters are not available. Melee DPS can act as triggers if the groups are far enough apart that it creates a gap that the trigger can move into without having to stop attacking the boss.\nRanged DPS / Healers.\nAny ranged DPS or healers not assigned to a melee group to soak cleave should stack up at a designated point far away from the boss to bait in Bounding Cleave. When he knocks the whole raid away, they should quickly move back to their stack point to ensure they get hit.\nHealers should have their strongest healing cooldowns for when the Butcher hits 30% and begins to Frenzy. This is also the point that the group should generally use &lt;a href=\"Heroism\"&gt;Heroism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bloodlust\"&gt;Bloodlust&lt;/a&gt; or similar abilities.\nTanking.\nThe Butcher has three tank mechanics in addition to his fairly powerful melee attack. Heavy Handed will copy his attacks onto the nearest target within 5 yards of his primary aggro target; if there is no other target within 5 yards of his current tank he will instead hit the tank twice. This necessitates the two tanks stacking on top of each other for the entire fight, but also not with any of the melee DPS as Heavy Handed can hit a non-tank as well which will probably cause a death.\nHis second tank mechanic is the Cleaver, which applies a stacking DoT on the tank. While this ability will simply need to be healed through for some tanks, avoidance-oriented tanks like &lt;a href=\"Monk%20abilities\"&gt;Brewmaster&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Monk\"&gt;Monk&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Druid%20abilities\"&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Druid\"&gt;Druid&lt;/a&gt;s should use their avoidance cooldowns (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Elusive%20Brew\"&gt;Elusive Brew&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Savage%20Defense\"&gt;Savage Defense&lt;/a&gt;) to attempt to dodge this ability, as it can be avoided and if avoided it does not apply its DoT.\nHis third tank mechanic is the Tenderizer, a single-target nuke which applies a debuff that increases damage of successive Tenderizers. The tanks should swap at 2 stacks of this ability and have a cooldown ready for reducing the damage of the second one.\nWhile not a tank mechanic per se, the Butcher's Frenzy is very remniscent of &lt;a href=\"Patchwerk\"&gt;Patchwerk&lt;/a&gt; and the boss will start doing increased damage and start attacking quite a bit faster, so having major defensive cooldowns ready for the 30% mark is essential for surviving the last minute of the fight."}

{"id": "555583", "revid": "38791128", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=555583", "title": "The Catacombs", "text": "The Catacombs are a series of underground tunnels the stretch out for miles to miles. It is filled with underground creatures that include kobolds, furbolgs and trogg. It also has ancient an treasure buried underneath, guarded by dragons and earthen. The area is most likely located under Kalimdor. &lt;a href=\"Tale%20of%20the%20Fox\"&gt;Tale of the Fox&lt;/a&gt; tells the story of &lt;a href=\"Marin%20the%20Fox\"&gt;Marin the Fox&lt;/a&gt; and his encounters underground. \nLocation.\nAside from certainty that the location of the Catacomb is on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, it is hard to pinpoint a direct location with the little information given. Fortunately, after examining the evidence, the conclusion reached involves the entirety of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. Since no evidence of kobolds digging under the sea is known, this can only mean that the race exists purely under the earth and the only place that fits most to all of the criteria is Kalimdor. \nWhere am I?\n&lt;a href=\"Frostfur\"&gt;Frostfur&lt;/a&gt;.\nShould an adventurer encounter Frostfur during a Dungeon Run and be defeated, she says the following: \"That's how we handle things, in Winterspring.\" While it can simply be her birth place, taking it a face value means that the adventurer was under &lt;a href=\"Winterspring\"&gt;Winterspring&lt;/a&gt;. To also support this, Frostfur is white, the standard color of all the furbolgs in Winterspring.\nKinds of Furbolgs.\nAside from &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Jari\"&gt;Elder Jari&lt;/a&gt; most of the furbolgs look like those of Kalimdor. The main difference between the two is the Northrend furbolgs are more fluffy with more fur. The best way to explain Jari is that in &lt;a href=\"The%20Comic\"&gt;The Comic&lt;/a&gt;, Varian and Broll tried to free several furbolgs from their corruption in Kalimdor. If one notices their eyes, they have no irises. This means that the dire furbolg can be found in Kalimdor.\n&lt;a href=\"George%20%28Hearthstone%29\"&gt;George&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Karl%20%28paladin%29\"&gt;Karl&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Journey%20to%20Un%27Goro\"&gt;Journey to Un'Goro&lt;/a&gt; expansion, two paladins of the silver hand were brought to light. In the description of and , they were lost and found. However, this is no longer the case as they are lost again. Since this takes place in &lt;a href=\"Un%27Goro%20Crater\"&gt;Un'Goro Crater&lt;/a&gt;, they must be on Kalimdor.\n&lt;a href=\"Desperiona\"&gt;Desperiona&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sethria\"&gt;Sethria&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Seriona\"&gt;Seriona&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe twilight dragon Seriona wishes to bring back the twilight dragon flight. In Mount Hyjal, Desperiona was a fertile twilight dragon. Seriona could also be fertile. Also there is the presence of more twilight dragons in the form of &lt;a href=\"Sethria\"&gt;Sethria&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Maximillian%20of%20Northshire\"&gt;Maximillian of Northshire&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn%20embassy\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile one may wonder how a cleric ended underground. However, if Graves the Cleric is part of the &lt;a href=\"Brotherhood%20of%20Northshire\"&gt;Brotherhood of Northshire&lt;/a&gt; then he could have followed Maximillian of Northshire. If he is part of the Argent Dawn, they have an embassy in Darnassus. Either way, this proves that followers of the light can be found here. \n&lt;a href=\"Goggeroc\"&gt;Goggeroc&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnderground, there appears to be a titan vault with the evidence of &lt;a href=\"Brimstone%20Warden\"&gt;Brimstone Warden&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kraxx%20%28golem%29\"&gt;Kraxx (golem)&lt;/a&gt;. While there does not appear to be a titan vault aside from Uldum. There used to be an &lt;a href=\"earthen\"&gt;earthen&lt;/a&gt; named Goggeroc who used to be worshiped by the kobolds in the area. This could signify that their is a hidden titan vault under &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt;.\nDjinn.\n&lt;a href=\"Djinn\"&gt;Djinn&lt;/a&gt; are only local to Kalimdor and the elemental plane. &lt;a href=\"Jeeru\"&gt;Jeeru&lt;/a&gt; can be encountered underground along with a .\nChronomancer Inara.\nThis is one of the conclusive proof as the bronze only make their home in Tanaris. Chronomancer Inara claimed to have out foxed them. Also \nTemporus can only be gotten to from the Caverns of Time. \n&lt;a href=\"The%20Mothergloop\"&gt;The Mothergloop&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere are plenty of oozes in Kelimdor, including the famous hearthstone &lt;a href=\"Acidic%20Swamp%20Ooze\"&gt;Acidic Swamp Ooze&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dustwallow%20Marsh\"&gt;Dustwallow Marsh&lt;/a&gt;.\nIronwood Golem.\nThe material for creating golems can be found in &lt;a href=\"Feralas\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt;.\nRhok'delar.\nUnlike the other legionaries, Rhok'delar can no longer be obtainable in Azeroth and it could only be gotten from Felwood. \nDemons of Felwood.\nAs to why there are demons underground, Felwood is infamous for underground passages run by the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Vustrasz%20the%20Ancient\"&gt;Vustrasz the Ancient&lt;/a&gt;.\nA red dragon guarding treasure is rare if not unheard of. &lt;a href=\"Andrestrasz\"&gt;Andrestrasz&lt;/a&gt; the ancient lives in a cavern and even though he is not guarding anything, it is very similar to Vustrasz.\n&lt;a href=\"Blackseed\"&gt;Blackseed&lt;/a&gt;.\nBlackseed appears to be corrupted by an Old God. Kalimdor has C'Thun.\nIxlid's environment.\nIxlid's environment in described and moist and moldy, where fauna and flora have taken over. &lt;a href=\"Maraudon\"&gt;Maraudon&lt;/a&gt; fits this description. \nEttins.\nWhile Ettins are rare in Kalimdor, there are a few such as &lt;a href=\"Dormus%20the%20Camel-Hoarder\"&gt;Dormus the Camel-Hoarder&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gadoon\"&gt;Gadoon&lt;/a&gt;.\nMissing from Kalimdor.\nWhile everything is accounted for in Kalimdor, there is one creature who is not present and that is the . Since it is only one card, it may not look like a big deal as he could have found a way to get to Kalimdor, but this mob could mean that the underground extents to the Broken Isles. However, until it is proven that kobolds can build underground tunnels that can go underwater like the gnomes, this cannot be possible. Also, the Broken Shore lacks Old God presence.\nWhere I'm not..\nBroken Isles.\nThere is a lot of evidence that the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt; is where its mostly likely located, but it presents a problem. Should one look at the promotional art one can easily make the connection between &lt;a href=\"Candle%20Rock\"&gt;Candle Rock&lt;/a&gt; and the location itself for its similarities. However, there is one thing missing that was in the trailer where the same location is shown, &lt;a href=\"King%20Togwaggle\"&gt;King Togwaggle&lt;/a&gt;. The answer to whether this takes place under the Broken Shore can be seen at the trailer where it confirms that King Togwaggle should be there but isn't. \nAnother candidate to evidence could &lt;a href=\"The%20Darkness\"&gt;The Darkness&lt;/a&gt;, since he most likely is the &lt;a href=\"Devouring%20Darkness\"&gt;Devouring Darkness&lt;/a&gt;. However, according to a quest to slay him, he was once the custody of the wardens. This means that the Devouring Darkness can move around and be transported anywhere. \nThere are also no troggs here. \nOutland and Argus.\nWe can easily remove these two planets as possible candidates as there are &lt;a href=\"kobold\"&gt;kobold&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"troggs\"&gt;troggs&lt;/a&gt;. The creatures found on these planets are all unique and none of them are found in the Catacombs. \n&lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Plane\"&gt;Elemental Plane&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe Elemental Planes are also a bust. Aside from &lt;a href=\"stone%20trogg\"&gt;stone trogg&lt;/a&gt;s and earthen, these lands are meant for elements alone. There is no reason for there to be creatures of flesh, or if its even possible for living creatures to have existed there without help from the outside world. Also, we run in the same problem as Outland and Argus, in that there are no &lt;a href=\"kobold\"&gt;kobold&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt;s and flesh &lt;a href=\"troggs\"&gt;troggs&lt;/a&gt;.\nNorthrend.\nNorthrend is another guess, but this too provides missing inhabitants. For one, the main stars of the expedition, the &lt;a href=\"kobold\"&gt;kobold&lt;/a&gt;s are missing. There is their cousins, the &lt;a href=\"snobold\"&gt;snobold&lt;/a&gt;, but according to the , the is their greatest weakness. This means that is cannot be them as none of them have candles on their head. Also, they are usually seen around &lt;a href=\"magnataur\"&gt;magnataur&lt;/a&gt; and freezing environments, none of which are found. \nAlso, troggs are also missing from here. \nPandaria.\nSimilar to Outland and Argus, Pandaria has its own set of creatures. While there could be troggs thanks to the &lt;a href=\"Grummle\"&gt;Grummle&lt;/a&gt;s. There are no groups of kobolds or furbolg in the area, as they are replaced by &lt;a href=\"virmen\"&gt;virmen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt;.\nEastern Kingdoms.\nThe Eastern Kingdoms could be a rival to Kalimdor, but it lacks one of the most prominent races, the &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt;s. There was the &lt;a href=\"Experiment%20Furbolg\"&gt;Experiment Furbolg&lt;/a&gt; but this is just one and was probably brought by the Highborne, not enough time to end underground. The &lt;a href=\"djinn\"&gt;djinn&lt;/a&gt; are also missing."}

You are to seek him out.\n&lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt; wanders the desert wasteland of &lt;a href=\"Desolace\"&gt;Desolace&lt;/a&gt;, traveling between &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon\"&gt;Stonetalon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Feralas\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt;.

However he has left Azeroth to join our expedition into &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;.\nHowever, he left his companion, &lt;a href=\"Rokaro\"&gt;Rokaro&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Shadowprey%20Village\"&gt;Shadowprey Village&lt;/a&gt; with this information.

He also wanders slightly into Stonetalon Peak and Feralas (as far as &lt;a href=\"The%20Twin%20Colossals\"&gt;The Twin Colossals&lt;/a&gt; in Feralas) so if you're having no luck finding him, search a little into both zones.\nRexxar was moved from his patrol area to the &lt;a href=\"Thunderlord%20Stronghold\"&gt;Thunderlord Stronghold&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Blade's Edge Mountains&lt;/a&gt; of northern &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. He has been replaced by an orc named &lt;a href=\"Rokaro\"&gt;Rokaro&lt;/a&gt;, who resides at &lt;a href=\"Shadowprey%20Village\"&gt;Shadowprey Village&lt;/a&gt;. He does not patrol as Rexxar did, and thus is easy to find."}

Years ago, when his father disappeared, young Anduin was crowned king of Stormwind. Due to his age, he was unable to rule, and the task of regency was given to Highlord Bolvar Fordragon, a venerated paladin of the Alliance. Once King Varian returned to reclaim his throne, the prince began to focus his efforts on spiritual matters and diplomacy, traveling throughout Azeroth to understand how he might heal lands and souls ravaged by war. Anduin's spirit and empathy -- so unlike his father's warrior impulses -- enabled him to form strong bonds with the draenei Prophet Velen and even a few members of the Horde.\nWith Pandaria revealed to the world, the young prince has personally led a campaign to unveil the region's secrets and cool the flames of war that threaten to consume the continent.

During the battle, Khadgar was struck by a terrible spell and aged dramatically. His body turned frail, but his mind remained sharp. After the orcs were driven back through the Dark Portal, Khadgar supervised the construction of Nethergarde Keep, a fortress built to watch over the breach between realms.\nAll seemed quiet at the Dark Portal, until the orc traitor Garrosh carved a path into an alternate version of Draenor's past. There, the legendary orc warlord Grommash Hellscream forged a destructive army of orcs: the Iron Horde. Using Garrosh's knowledge of the original portal, the Iron Horde built a new gateway to Azeroth. With little to stop the orcs, the Iron Horde poured into Azeroth and laid waste to Nethergarde Keep. Unrivaled in his wisdom and experience, Khadgar was summoned to help repel the invasion. War looms over the Dark Portal yet again.

Though he wasn't demonically influenced himself, Garrosh was haunted by his family's legacy: his father, Grommash Hellscream, was the first orc to embrace corruption by drinking the blood of the pit lord Mannoroth. Garrosh lived in the shadow of his father's acts until he met Warchief Thrall, founder of the renewed Horde, who explained to the younger Hellscream how Grommash ultimately gave his life to lift the demonic blood-curse, and freed his race from servitude to dark forces.\nUplifted, Garrosh joined Thrall in Azeroth and quickly became a hero of the Horde by leading a successful offensive against the Lich King. When Deathwing shattered the world, Thrall was forced to leave his throne to stop the destruction, and left Garrosh as his successor. Looking for ways to gather more resources and new territory for his people, Hellscream has initiated several brutal strikes against the Alliance, razing the city of Theramore and later clashing over the continent of Pandaria. As warchief, Garrosh's controversial actions -- among them claiming the heart of an Old God and ravaging Pandaria's Vale of Eternal Blossoms -- fueled rebellion, leading Horde dissidents and a vengeful Alliance to besiege Orgrimmar and depose him.\nVictorious, Orgrimmar\u2019s liberators dragged Hellscream to trial in Pandaria, where they recounted each of his crimes against Azeroth.

Ner'zhul sought to undercut their alliance when he learned the pact would make the entire orc people slaves to demons, but before he could, Gul'dan betrayed him and took his place. Gul'dan became the first known warlock and the head of the Shadow Council, a cabal of resourceful orcs who secretly served the Burning Legion from within orc society. Gul'dan's actions would ultimately lead to the corruption of the Horde; he deceived several leaders of the orcish clans into drinking the blood of the pit lord Mannoroth, binding them to the Legion.\nWith a unified orc army at his back, Gul'dan launched an unprovoked attack against Shattrath City, and razed the draenei capital. Even though the orcs had followed Kil'jaeden's orders, the demon lord abandoned them, leaving them to fight amongst themselves for years on a world that quickly turned barren from the use of destructive fel magic.\nGul'dan saw a new destiny for the Horde after being contacted by the corrupted human sorcerer, Medivh. The orc warlock was promised endless power in exchange for conquering Azeroth and freeing the body of the fallen titan, Sargeras. The Shadow Council built and opened a Dark Portal with Medivh's help, and the orcs plundered their way across the Eastern Kingdoms, eventually laying siege to Stormwind City. With victory in his grasp, Gul'dan decided he no longer wished to wait for Medivh to voluntarily tell him the location of Sargeras' tomb. The warlock was searching deep within Medivh's mind when the human sorcerer was killed during a daring raid, and Gul'dan fell into a coma. By the time Gul'dan awoke, most of his followers were dead, and the Horde was now firmly under the command of Orgrim Doomhammer.\nGul'dan swore allegiance to the new Warchief by assembling an undead army \u2013 the dreaded Death Knights \u2013 from the corpses of Stormwind's fallen heroes. However, when Doomhammer's Horde needed him the most during the Second War, Gul'dan and some of his clans abandoned Doomhammer to seek the tomb of Sargeras, where he uncovered the terrible truth behind his efforts: Sargeras never had any intention of granting him power at all. Gul'dan was torn to shreds by the masses of vicious demons inside the tomb, and his very skull became a focus of demonic power."}

Driven by his thirst for power (and his desire to impress Tyrande Whisperwind), Illidan made a pact with the Legion to secure the entrance of its leader, Sargeras, into Azeroth through the might of an artifact called the Demon Soul. The efforts of Malfurion Stormrage, Illidan's twin brother, disrupted the Legion's plot; the demons were defeated, and Illidan was imprisoned.\nDuring the Third War, Tyrande released Illidan from millennia of imprisonment, hoping that the Betrayer would redeem himself by battling a returned Burning Legion. Though Illidan fought to defend his people, he soon slipped into darkness: after absorbing the energies of the demonic Skull of Gul'dan, Illidan became a demon, an act for which he was banished by Malfurion. Fleeing the wrath of the night elves, the twice-condemned Illidan allied himself once again with the only entity that would accept him -- the Legion. Illidan's demonic masters sent him to destroy the Lich King, who had broken free of their influence, but Illidan failed to do so. To protect himself from the Legion's vengeance, Illidan hid on Outland, a destroyed world that he would eventually seek to rule."}

A renewed Zhu grew to grudgingly accept (and even welcome) the champions of both factions, joining forces with them to strike at the Thunder King and Warchief Garrosh Hellscream, whose ambitions ravaged Pandaria's precious Vale of Eternal Blossoms. Zhu and his disciples have yet to falter in their dedication to their homeland - but it remains to be seen if they will rise to defend the world beyond the Mists as well."}

It presented information about &lt;a href=\"The%20Lich%20King\"&gt;The Lich King&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Lich King.\n\"Through demonic punishment, the Lich King was born with a singular objective: controlling the massive throng of undead known as the Scourge.\"\nNer'zhul was an elder orc shaman who rose as high as warchief of the orc clans of Draenor... and fell low enough to become a slave of the Burning Legion. After the Second War drew to a close, Ner'zhul -- guided by visions of death -- frantically opened new portals to worlds that the orcish hordes might invade, but the magical stress of creating so many portals at once tore Draenor apart. Ner'zhul escaped the death of his homeworld by fleeing into the nearest rift, only to find the demon Kil'jaeden lying in wait for him. Kil'jaeden had long manipulated Ner'zhul's visions to guide the orcs down a dark path, and now the demon punished his puppet by destroying Ner'zhul's body and encasing his spirit in an icy cask that would come to be called the Frozen Throne. This act birthed the Lich King, a spectral presence made to command the Scourge, an army of undead that would serve as the Burning Legion's advance weapon against Azeroth.\nDespite his orders, the Lich King plotted to break free of the Legion's influence. During the Third War, he summoned Arthas Menethil, the fallen prince of Lordaeron, to serve as his most loyal death knight. When the Lich King was threatened by the forces of Illidan the Betrayer, Arthas traveled to the Frozen Throne of Northrend and broke the ice surrounding his master, donning the Lich King's helm and merging with him. Years later, the Alliance and Horde would march to destroy the Lich King, but they discovered that the Scourge, now loosed upon Azeroth, would always need a leader. The brave highlord Bolvar Fordragon volunteered to become the new jailor of the damned, dedicating his existence to containing the ravages of the undead."}

When Go'el escaped his prison, he traveled in search of not just aimless freedom but his roots, eventually finding wisdom in the shamanic beliefs of his ancestors.\nThrall's shamanism guided his actions as he re-formed the Horde, becoming its warchief and leading his people to settle in an arid land that he called Durotar, in honor of his father, Durotan. Thrall led the Horde through a seemingly unceasing series of trials: the lifting of the demonic blood-curse that had tainted the orcs, a Burning Legion attack on Mount Hyjal, and the fall of the dreaded Lich King. When Deathwing returned and shattered the world, Thrall stepped down from his role as the Horde's warchief, instead joining the Earthen Ring, a powerful shamanic group, in an attempt to put the elements to rest and stop the Destroyer. Thrall chose Garrosh Hellscream as his successor, and that decision haunted him as the ruthlessness of the new warchief brought the Horde to the point of insurrection. Garrosh\u2019s defeat, the birth of Thrall\u2019s son, and the emergence of a new warchief seem to have had a rejuvenating effect. Whole once more, Thrall now readies himself to combat a truly personal threat to all Azeroth, as a savage reflection of his people roars forth from a universe beyond."}

She answered the call of the Sisters of Elune, followers of the night elves' Goddess of the Moon, and became a novice priestess, while the Stormrage brothers followed different paths. Their destinies merged anew when the Burning Legion arrived on Azeroth.\nTyrande and Malfurion grew close and battled against the invading demons together, but Illidan pursued a darker path, feigning allegiance to the Burning Legion and succumbing to the temptations of power. After the defeat of the Legion and the Sundering, Tyrande and Malfurion helped rebuild elven society; Illidan was imprisoned beneath Mount Hyjal.\nThe couple could not remain together for long; soon after the night elves settled near Mount Hyjal, Malfurion and the other night elf druids were needed in the Emerald Dream. While Malfurion slept in the Dream, Tyrande commanded her people, forming the Sentinels \u2013 the night elven army \u2013 to guard their lands and allies.\nDuring the Third War, Tyrande sent her Sentinels to deter the advances of the Horde in Kalimdor, but ultimately ended up working with them to battle the armies of the Burning Legion, an effort that also forced her to awaken the druids, including Malfurion, from the Emerald Dream. Their time together was cut short when the elder Stormrage suffered from the corruption of the Dream, but Tyrande joined her lover to defeat the menace, and they both returned to Azeroth, where they protected their people (and the other races of the Alliance) from the destruction caused by Deathwing and the advances of Garrosh Hellscream in Kalimdor."}

The legend of noble Uther guides the Alliance years after his passing.\"\nMany devout followers of the Light were killed during the First War, unprepared for the sheer brutality of warfare against the Horde. The leader of the Clerics of Northshire, Alonsus Faol, believed that the Light could protect the faithful and devoted, and thus began training the most virtuous knights of Lordaeron to wield the Light in battle.\nThe first knight to be named a paladin was Uther, who helped found the Knights of the Silver Hand alongside Archbishop Faol and became a legend among his order. When the Second War began, Uther fought alongside his brother-in-arms, Turalyon, to fend off the forces of Horde commander Orgrim Doomhammer and lead the Alliance in a final, successful attack on the Dark Portal. In the wake of the Horde's defeat, Uther helped rebuild Stormwind City and cared for the sick and injured.\nUther remained in a leadership role with the Silver Hand for years, eventually taking Lordaeron's prince, Arthas Menethil, as his apprentice. The two forged a close relationship as teacher and student, and together they served justice throughout the land\u2026until the Scourge struck Lordaeron. Arthas' growing anger at the spreading plague of undeath led him to horrific acts\u2014such as the culling of Stratholme\u2014and his thirst for vengeance drove him to madness. After the prince became a champion of the Lich King and killed his own father, Uther decided to personally guard the urn of the slain king. Arthas and Uther fought in Andorhal, and when the battle ended, the legendary paladin lay dead.\nToday, followers of the Light pay their respects to Uther at Stormwind's cathedral, where a statue of the revered paladin was built.

The young blood elf lived a survivalist existence until she was arrested for theft and later sold to Rehgar Earthfury, who put her to work as a gladiator alongside the night elf druid Broll Bearmantle and the orc Bloodeye Redfist. When Redfist was killed, Valeera and Broll were teamed up with an amnesiac human warrior who would later become known as Lo'Gosh, the \"Ghost Wolf.\"\nThe trio quickly discovered that Lo'Gosh was Varian Wrynn, the missing king of Stormwind, and they embarked on a journey to restore his memory and throne, pitting themselves against the black dragon Onyxia, who secretly controlled the human kingdom.

Years later, Varian reclaimed Stormwind City and initiated its reconstruction, marrying the beautiful Tiffin Ellerian and raising a son, Anduin, whom he named after the great Alliance hero Anduin Lothar. Long after the dust settled from the Third War, Varian was kidnapped by minions of the black dragon Onyxia, who split Varian into two separate beings: one embodying his strength and resolve, and one bereft of willpower. The dragon hoped to kill Varian's warrior qualities, yet still rule Stormwind by using the weaker king as her puppet. But Varian's stronger half escaped his captors, and earned a new name for himself as the legendary gladiator Lo'Gosh, the \"ghost wolf.\"\nAfter reuniting his selves and reclaiming his throne, King Wrynn organized the campaign against the Lich King in Northrend and defended his realm against the terrors of Deathwing's Cataclysm. In recent days, Varian has turned his eye toward his old enemies in the Horde, and many in his council fear that their king actually desires another years-long war between Horde and Alliance. Varian's ongoing struggle -- to balance his warrior's instincts with his duties as a king -- grew even more critical in the wake of Theramore's destruction and throughout the battle for the continent of Pandaria."}

Thousands of years ago, the Dark Titan, Sargeras, offered Velen's people immense power, but he wisely refused it. He foresaw that accepting that power would lead to tremendous suffering. However, other, less principled individuals agreed to the titan's bargain. Velen realized that he could not safely remain on Argus. Defying the Dark Titan himself, Velen and his brave followers escaped with help from the naaru, mysterious beings of the Holy Light.

They rallied together to forge the Iron Horde and threatened draenei settlements all over Draenor. Now, the ancient Prophet faces yet another threat. For as long as he has gazed into the skies above Draenor, a dark power has lurked there. Velen had hoped never to confront it, but the orcs are prepared to unleash it.

The items in this set which were mob drops have been replaced by upgraded items, and the recipes can no longer be created due to the removal of required items such as &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Rune\"&gt;Frozen Runes&lt;/a&gt;."}

This single-minded devotion to weaponry and fighting styles makes him much feared by his enemies who cross him, and close allies to those who manage to befriend him. A gladiator prides himself on having equal proficiency over every weapon imaginable. Most also strive to become peerless experts in a weapon of their choice. This chosen weapon weaves and sings in the gladiator's hand, carving a swath through all foes.\nMost gladiators come from the ranks of &lt;a href=\"fighter\"&gt;fighter&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s, or &lt;a href=\"barbarian\"&gt;barbarian&lt;/a&gt;s, who find the discipline and rigors of training a welcome challenge to master.

Please accept this as a small token of my gratitude.\nAnthion is... no... he can't be...\nDetails.\nGetting to the Baron in 45 minutes is one of the toughest objectives in game at level 60. It requires a concentrated group of five working together very well. Everyone should have their Dungeon Set 1 (or equivalent) equipment; there's not much chance you'll succeed with lesser gear.\nIdeal party make-up.\nConventionally, your group \"must\" have a &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Shackle%20Undead\"&gt;Shackle Undead&lt;/a&gt; is absolutely required. In addition, a &lt;a href=\"tank\"&gt;tank&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;Mage&lt;/a&gt; are virtually required as well. A &lt;a href=\"Rogue\"&gt;Rogue&lt;/a&gt; is a good addition, as is a &lt;a href=\"Warlock\"&gt;Warlock&lt;/a&gt;, because high DPS is needed to go through Stratholme as fast as possible. A &lt;a href=\"Druid\"&gt;Druid&lt;/a&gt; would be useful for the &lt;a href=\"Mark%20of%20the%20Wild\"&gt;Mark of the Wild&lt;/a&gt; buff, and a &lt;a href=\"Shaman\"&gt;Shaman&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt; would be excellent as an &lt;a href=\"off%20tank\"&gt;off tank&lt;/a&gt;; any of those would also be useful for backup healing and resurrecting, especially Druids with their in-combat resurrecting.)\nYou could also make a DPS party, where you substitute out the priest in favor of two healing/DPS hybrid classes (druid, shaman, or paladin). For example: Warrior, Rogue, Mage, Druid, Shaman would have a good chance of success even without the ability to shackle.\nKeep in mind when creating your party that different classes require different amounts of downtime, which you must strive to avoid. Warriors and rogues make good choices for this encounter because they have no mana. Druids are also an excellent choice. They can regenerate mana while in a feral form, so if you have a balance druid, for example, he can nuke until out of mana, then switch to cat form and melee while his mana regenerates. A druid can also Innervate the healer, further reducing your downtime, or backup heal while the Priest is drinking. There are, however, a few things your party must have:\nGeneral points on buffs.\nThe primary casters should stock up on &lt;a href=\"Major%20Mana%20Potion\"&gt;Major Mana Potion&lt;/a&gt;s. (Around 10 per caster is a very safe number to have.)\nEveryone should carry about 5&lt;a href=\"Major%20Healing%20Potion\"&gt;Major Healing Potion&lt;/a&gt;s. Ideally everyone should have their &lt;a href=\"First%20Aid\"&gt;First Aid&lt;/a&gt; skill at 300 and be able to create and use &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Runecloth%20Bandage\"&gt;Heavy Runecloth Bandage&lt;/a&gt;s as needed. Use &lt;a href=\"First%20Aid\"&gt;First Aid&lt;/a&gt; liberally to save the healer's mana for important heals!\nIt might also be worth farming &lt;a href=\"Stratholme%20Holy%20Water\"&gt;Stratholme Holy Water&lt;/a&gt; beforehand if the party's DPS is going to be low.\nEnsure all abilities with cooldowns are available before you start. (Inner Focus, Innervate, racial abilities, etcetera) You should rebuff and mana up immediately before opening the gate.\nNormal pulls.\nThe biggest challenge in a 45-minute run is that you are constantly pulling mobs. When your current target is between \u00bc and \u00bd life, someone starts to pull the next mob so there is no downtime. The only time you should not do this is when the entire party needs to eat, drink and rebuff. As soon as the first group member is filled up again, start pulling again. It does not really matter who pulls, as long as it is done swiftly. The general policy on eating and drinking is \"little and often\". You do not need full health or mana, and it'll slow you down if you try to fully recharge after each fight.\nOn all the non-boss mobs, it is recommend that the tank tanks with either a two-handed weapon or dual-wields. This will add more DPS, and only increases damage done to you by a minimal amount. As long as the tank remembers to use a shield on the bosses, there should be no problem. \nWhen pulling, use crowd control as usual. Do not use sap unless you have two Rogues, because it will take too much time to stealth around the target. You should always kill the Eyes of Naxxramas first, because they summon assistance. The casters should be silenced as much as possible to decrease damage taken. \nUsing an offtank.\nIf you have an offtank (OT), one DPS should be assigned to assist the MT and one to assist the OT. When you have multiple mobs attacking, they take different targets. Whichever group finishes first should move on to another target, the choice of which should be made as follows: highest preference goes to an attacking mob that isn't being burned down by the other group; next is the mob that \"is\" being burned down by the other group; last is any shackled or sheeped mobs.\nOne strategy has the two DPS's trading off which tank they assist after each kill in order to allow them to drink/eat between each fight. The DPS assigned to the maintank on a pull moves up to make the next pull and assist the offtank. The DPS that was on the offtank drinks/eats and then assists the maintank. You would rotate as follows:\nThis strategy works based on the presumption that the MT can take more damage than the OT, so he requires less assistance and can withstand having no backup DPS for a while.\nLooting.\nIt's recommended to not loot trash mobs, as that consumes a surprising amount of your very limited time. Only loot the minibosses, and even then need/greed as fast as possible. (don't pass and wait for the roll!)\nWipes.\nWiping is very painful in a 45-minute run, and more often than not necessitates a reset. Even so, it's definitely possible to wipe and still finish the run in time. If it looks like you're going to wipe, do it quickly; trying to grind out the win wastes too much time, and it's quicker to resurrect and rebuff than to drag out a painful fight.\nOf course you really should just avoid wiping in the first place. The most common wipes are due to accidental proximity pulls, and those are easy to do in a 45-minute run because of the number of mobs left untouched. Just be aware of your position and surrounding mobs at all times and you should be okay. (Turning on the mob health bars is a great way to see mobs that you normally wouldn't see until you ran into them.)\nBaroness Anastari.\nKill all the mobs in the entry courtyard. You can leave the ones to the right of her &lt;a href=\"ziggurat\"&gt;ziggurat&lt;/a&gt;, however the banshee and crypt crawler to her left must be killed. Now, pull her to the courtyard. You should be nuking her down as fast as possible, apart from that it is business as usual. The higher your tank's shadow resistance, the easier it will be. You should aim to have her down within 8 minutes. \nAfterwards, you can clear the ziggurat with just a Mage\u2014have the Priest throw a shield and a renew on him and he's good to go. This frees the entire rest of the party to start working on the mobs leading to Nerub'enkan.\nIf you have a good Hunter, the Baroness can be soloed at maximum range. Let the hunter engage her at maximum range, and DPS her to death. If everyone else in the party is behind the hunter, she will not move or mind control anyone, making this a very easy fight. The hunter will need heals and shields, but is easily kept up by one priest.\nNerub'enkan.\nTo reach him, clear all mobs on the right side of the street leading to his ziggurat. Stay on the right side of the street to avoid some mobs. You do not have to kill the mobs directly to the right of his ziggurat though. Kill him as usual, he should be down within 13 minutes of starting. Again, only the mage needs to clear the ziggurat. Everyone else moves on to clear the rat trap, if the Priest has Holy Nova it's a good AoE attack for this if there aren't any other AoEers in the group. \nMaleki the Pallid.\nOn the other side of the rat trap, pull the human mobs on the right and AoE. You can safely ignore the ghouls on the left. Afterwards, clear out all the patrolling mobs, such as gargoyles, banshees and crypt crawlers. Now, proceed up to the right side of the fountain and clear the space leading to the ziggurat. Be careful not to proximity-pull the ghouls around the corner to the right. You can now AoE the mobs to the left of the steps, and ignore the ones to the right. Then proceed with the ones on the steps. \nMaleki should be engaged on top of the steps. Move the whole group up there to avoid line of sight issues. Kill Maleki as usual. You should aim to have him down within 23 minutes of starting time. As usual, send in the Mage to clear out the ziggurat while the rest of the party heads to the Gauntlet.\nThe Gauntlet.\nAfter killing Maleki, fight your way down to the right wall. The ghouls to the left of the gate can be skipped, but take out the ones to the right. Ignore Magistrate Barthilas, he is optional. You can come back and do him after finishing the quest though. As soon as everyone has entered the gates, you start pulling. Do not wait for the mobs to walk to you, but pull them as fast as possible. Start with the mobs to the right and in the center, and kill the ones on the left last. It is recommended to fight the final 4-5 mobs outside the gate, so that you have better visibility. It is essential that the bile adds are dealt with as fast as possible, since they will concentrate on the healer. \nIt's recommended that you kill a Venom Spewer as the final mob. Eat and drink before killing him. Once he is dead, &lt;a href=\"Ramstein%20the%20Gorger\"&gt;Ramstein the Gorger&lt;/a&gt; will come out of the slaughterhouse. When you have killed him, wait until you have killed the wave of skeletons. Loot him as soon as you are going to enter the slaughterhouse to kill the Baron. \nThe five elite Black Guard Sentries can be dealt with in two ways. If you have two AoE players (mages/warlocks): shield the casters, frost nova, and AoE. Otherwise, shackle one and focus on MT and OT targets. \nBaron Rivendare.\nYou do not have to kill the Baron in 45 minutes, you only have to engage him in 45 minutes. However, if you wipe after engaging him, you will fail the quest. From this point, it is exactly the same as on a normal Baron run. After you have taken him down, you can talk to &lt;a href=\"Ysida%20Harmon\"&gt;Ysida&lt;/a&gt; and finish the quest."}

They marched all the way to the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Isle of Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt;, killing everyone and destroying everything in their path. The Dead Scar practically splits &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; in half and goes through &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt; itself. It begins at &lt;a href=\"Deatholme\"&gt;Deatholme&lt;/a&gt;, the Scourge headquarters in Quel'Thalas, and runs through the &lt;a href=\"Ghostlands\"&gt;Ghostlands&lt;/a&gt; and across the &lt;a href=\"Elrendar%20River\"&gt;Elrendar River&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"Eversong%20Woods\"&gt;Eversong Woods&lt;/a&gt;. The path then continues across the woods and through the shattered main gates of Silvermoon, stopping at the coast of the &lt;a href=\"North%20Sea\"&gt;North Sea&lt;/a&gt;. It then picks up once more on the southern tip of the Isle of Quel'Danas, before ending at the location of the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThird War.\nThe &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; was instructed by the &lt;a href=\"dreadlord\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tichondrius\"&gt;Tichondrius&lt;/a&gt; to bring the corpse of the &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;, the source of the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt;' &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;, in order to resurrect him in a much more powerful form. Transporting his remains in the &lt;a href=\"Urn%20of%20King%20Terenas\"&gt;urn&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;King Terenas&lt;/a&gt;, Arthas and the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; began their march across the &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands\"&gt;Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt; of northern &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"elfgate\"&gt;elfgate&lt;/a&gt;s that protected the elven kingdom from invaders. The treacherous &lt;a href=\"magister\"&gt;magister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dar%27Khan%20Drathir\"&gt;Dar'Khan Drathir&lt;/a&gt; betrayed his own people and helped Arthas through the gates. The &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; forces subsequently destroyed all in their path, &lt;a href=\"blight\"&gt;blight&lt;/a&gt;ing the very land they trod upon. They walked from &lt;a href=\"Deatholme\"&gt;Deatholme&lt;/a&gt;'s location straight to &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt;, cutting through the forests and even &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Silvermoon\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt; itself. Before leaving for the island, Arthas froze the sea between the continent and the Sunwell's isle. The path they took across Quel'Thalas remains burned into the soil to this day. Kel'Thuzad was eventually resurrected, and the Sunwell defiled, thus cutting the elves off from their source of magic.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nThe tainted soil of the Dead Scar draws &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; to it and completely disrupts the energy in the &lt;a href=\"ley%20line\"&gt;ley line&lt;/a&gt;s beneath it. The undead presence along the Dead Scar is considerable. Though they are fairly weak, their numbers are enough to keep the Silvermoon &lt;a href=\"Ranger%20Corps\"&gt;Ranger Corps&lt;/a&gt; busy fending off the undead marauders. In the recently named &lt;a href=\"Ghostlands\"&gt;Ghostlands&lt;/a&gt; however, the undead were amassed behind the walls of &lt;a href=\"Deatholme\"&gt;Deatholme&lt;/a&gt;, where the traitor Dar'Khan Drathir and his lieutenants commanded the Scourge efforts in Quel'Thalas.\nAlong the edge of the Dead Scar at the &lt;a href=\"East%20Sanctum\"&gt;East Sanctum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Eversong%20Woods\"&gt;Eversong Woods&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Apprentice%20Mirveda\"&gt;Apprentice Mirveda&lt;/a&gt; embarked in a dangerous line of research, one that her own former mentor had lost hope for. She ventured into the Dead Scar by herself to collect samples and see if it was possible to heal the defiled ground. She concluded that her endeavors were hopeless, for the very nature of the soil was altered, and deemed the taint irreversible.\nAs discouraging as the research results were, they still contained valuable data. A magister needed to review her work before it could be taken seriously. Her mentor &lt;a href=\"Magistrix%20Landra%20Dawnstrider\"&gt;Magistrix Landra Dawnstrider&lt;/a&gt; found the notes shocking; if they were correct it would mean that the damage to the land on the Dead Scar is irreversible. If that were the case, she believed that it would be one more reason for her race to escape this world and find their true fate in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;.

At the northern end could be found the commander of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt; forces &lt;a href=\"Brutallus\"&gt;Brutallus&lt;/a&gt;, verbally sparring with the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragon\"&gt;blue dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Madrigosa\"&gt;Madrigosa&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nAfter the end of the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20Campaign\"&gt;Argus Campaign&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Windrunner\"&gt;Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; sisters reunited in the &lt;a href=\"Eversong%20Woods\"&gt;Eversong Woods&lt;/a&gt; and traveled to the Ghostlands through the Dead Scar, fighting the undead, until they reached &lt;a href=\"Goldenmist%20Village\"&gt;Goldenmist Village&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Heritage%20of%20the%20Sin%27dorei\"&gt;Heritage of the Sin'dorei&lt;/a&gt; questline, the blood elven adventurer, accompanied by &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;, witnessed echoes of the past showing high elf defenders and their encounters and struggle against the Scourge and their ultimate demise by Arthas. They explored the surroundings of &lt;a href=\"Deatholme\"&gt;Deatholme&lt;/a&gt; and also went near the &lt;a href=\"East%20Sanctum\"&gt;East Sanctum&lt;/a&gt;. On their way, they encountered corpses of high elven defenders (either lying on the ground or being impaled on a frozen spike) and ballistae, and also enemies.\nShadowlands.\nThe undead of the Scourge rallied by &lt;a href=\"Vorath\"&gt;Vorath&lt;/a&gt; made their way through the Dead Scar. As the countermeasure of the sin'dorei, three &lt;a href=\"Protection%20Ward\"&gt;Protection Ward&lt;/a&gt;s were placed in the middle of the Scar, barring their advance north with holy bolts. A &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;sin'dorei hero&lt;/a&gt; mounted on a &lt;a href=\"Thalassian%20Warstrider\"&gt;Thalassian Warstrider&lt;/a&gt; cut a swath of destruction on the road leading to Deatholme with a ranseur empowered with magic from the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;."}

They are the ones who serve as a line of defense, a patient &lt;a href=\"assassin\"&gt;assassin&lt;/a&gt;, or a failsafe in case a tense diplomatic meeting goes poorly. They are specialized assassins, able to slay with one painstaking shot from a rifle or crossbow. Although many associate the dead shot with the gun, many dead shots, notably night elves, are skilled with the bow or crossbow. They all share the qualities of a sharp eye and almost unnatural patience. The dead shot is skilled, of course, in specific ranged attacks, but they also have abilities that allow them to melt into the background, wait for hours on end for their prey to appear, and spot a sparrow in a tree three-hundred yards away.\nAny race may pick up a ranged weapon, and any race may become expertly skilled in it. Still, most dead shots are night elf &lt;a href=\"archer\"&gt;archer&lt;/a&gt;s or Ironforge dwarf &lt;a href=\"sharpshooter\"&gt;sharpshooter&lt;/a&gt;s.\nWith the diminished numbers of the Alliance showing weaknesses, the dead shot has become quite necessary, as their stealth and range can allow them to kill several enemy troops before they can be found or reached. Dead shots prefer to work alone, but occasionally seek companions if they worry about the enemy discovering their location. Most dead shots are virtually worthless in melee combat.\nFew dead shots are impatient. Where most people consider patience to be the ability to sit through long diplomatic meetings, or deal calmly with unruly prisoners, most dead shots make no rash decisions - no matter what. They are slow to anger and view every problem with a cool, calculating manner, acting only when they feel it necessary. This quality is useful in military circumstances, but in life dead shots prove to be infuriating individuals, devoid of passion or spontaneity.\nDead shots serve as backup to troops on the front line, or as the first line of defense, ordered to fall back if the enemy gets within a certain range. Although still lethal at point-blank range, the dead shot is not likely to live long if their enemies locate them. Those dead shots that join groups commonly travel with military units, and dead shots who favor guns enjoy the company of &lt;a href=\"tinker\"&gt;tinker&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Scout\"&gt;Scout&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"beastmaster\"&gt;beastmaster&lt;/a&gt;s, both classes that prefer solitary existence, also get on well with dead shots on a personal level. The rare dead shot who prefers company seeks it among verbose people, enjoying a good conversation to break up the hours of solitary hunting he must endure.\nAbove all, the dead shot must be able to concentrate on her target in order to fulfill her duty; she cannot become distracted. The dead shot remains hidden during battle. The dead shot\u2019s closest friend is her weapon, and she knows it better than she knows any living being. The dead shot can make an lethal shot One Shot, One Kill.\nDead shots in the world.\nNight elf Dead shots.\n&lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;Night elves&lt;/a&gt; favor the cover of night and their natural ability to shadowmeld, making them deadly predators lying in wait for their prey.\nIronforge dwarf dead shots.\n&lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20dwarf\"&gt;Ironforge dwarves&lt;/a&gt; took their skill in engineering and made better and better weapons, naturally becoming the masters of their creations.\nHuman dead shots.\n&lt;a href=\"Human\"&gt;Human&lt;/a&gt;s, as always, follow the other races and learn from their masters, so it is not out of place to see a sharp-eyed human with a crossbow or gun perched atop a tower, scanning the horizon.\nHalf-elf dead shots.\n&lt;a href=\"Half-elf\"&gt;Half-elves&lt;/a&gt; prefer the solitary work conditions of the dead shot.\nGnome dead shots.\n&lt;a href=\"Gnome\"&gt;Gnome&lt;/a&gt;s appreciate the freedom of ranged combat, as most prefer to keep out of melee - and some think the farther they are from combat, the better.\nHigh elf dead shots.\n&lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;High elves&lt;/a&gt; are rare dead shots, as they prefer magic as their ranged weapon of choice; but some hearken to their past and take up the bow, realizing that two hundred arrows are more readily available than two hundred spells.\nKnown.\nEagle Eyes\nWorld of Warcraft"}

{"id": "107369", "revid": "22514", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=107369", "title": "Downranking", "text": "Downranking described the usage of spell ranks lower than the highest one in order to increase damage or healing per mana spent, or for the use of a secondary, rank-independent effect, in trade for a lower amount of damage or healing. For healers, this was sometimes necessary to prevent overhealing. Mana reservation was the desired aim. In most circumstances, downranking is no longer a viable tactic.\nDownranking has been nerfed several times. The first time, it was nerfed so that any spell learned below level 20 suffered a penalty. Then, with &lt;a href=\"patch%202.0.1\"&gt;patch 2.0.1&lt;/a&gt;, it was nerfed again so that any spell of a certain number of levels too low was nerfed.\nThe most severe nerf was introduced with the release of &lt;a href=\"patch%203.0.2\"&gt;patch 3.0.2&lt;/a&gt;, which caused player spells to cost a percentage of the caster's &lt;a href=\"base%20mana\"&gt;base mana&lt;/a&gt;, which either remained constant for all ranks or decreased with higher ranks.\nFinally in &lt;a href=\"Patch%204.0.1\"&gt;Patch 4.0.1&lt;/a&gt; downranking was completely removed from the game, with the character's spells scaling with the level of the character and only needing to be learned once.\nIn addition to voluntary downranking, when a buff spell is cast on a character whose level is too low to receive that buff, the character will receive a downranked version of the buff instead.\nPractical uses of downranking.\nDownranking is still useful in a few circumstances:\nDownranking Algorithm.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nAt some point between patch 2.2 and the release of Wrath of the Lich King, the downranking formula was changed again.\n&lt;a href=\"Ghostcrawler\"&gt;Ghostcrawler&lt;/a&gt; made the following statement about the downranking formula:\nBurning Crusade.\nAs of 2.2, the downranking algorith is as follows:\nEach spell rank has a range in which it is supposed to be used. Greater Heal rank 2, for instance, is learned at level 46 and lasts until level 51 (Rank 3 is learned at level 52). The range for Greater Heal rank2 is thus 46-51. \nThe spell coefficient is given as follows:\n downrank = (spell_maxlevel + 6) / playerlevel;\n if (downrank &gt; 1) downrank = 1;\n if(spell_minlevel &lt; 20) \n sub20downrank = 1.0 - ((20-spell_minlevel) * 0.0375);\n if(sub20downrank &lt; 0) sub20downrank = 0;\n downrank = downrank * sub20downrank;\nThis number is in turn multiplied with your spell coefficient and your bonus healing/damage. \nDownranking is the process of using a lower than maximum &lt;a href=\"spell\"&gt;spell&lt;/a&gt; rank in order to gain higher efficiency per &lt;a href=\"mana\"&gt;mana&lt;/a&gt;. It is particularly used by healing classes - &lt;a href=\"Shaman\"&gt;Shaman&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Druid\"&gt;Druid&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Priest\"&gt;Priest&lt;/a&gt;s - in order to extend their longevity in long boss fights.\nGeneral Downranking Penalty.\nA penalty for downranking to spells below level 20 has been present since early in the game's development. Shortly before the release of the 2.0 content &lt;a href=\"patch\"&gt;patch&lt;/a&gt;, an additional downranking modifier was added in order to combat significant downranking of &lt;a href=\"healing\"&gt;healing&lt;/a&gt; spells in &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt;ing. With the original system, as long as the spell was over level 20, there was no penalty. This led to situations where certain classes were using spells down to into the lower 20s and compensating for the lower base healing amount by stacking &lt;a href=\"spell%20power\"&gt;+heal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"stats\"&gt;stats&lt;/a&gt;, resulting in an extreme increases in healing per &lt;a href=\"mana\"&gt;mana&lt;/a&gt; beyond what &lt;a href=\"Blizzard\"&gt;Blizzard&lt;/a&gt;'s encounter design had intended.\nThe new formula scales down bonus healing and damage for spells which could have been learned more than 11 levels ago, by a simple multiplier:\nCalculation:\nsLvl = Level that the rank of this spell can first be learned\ncLvl = Caster's Current Level\nDownranking Multiplier = Min(1, (sLvL + 11) / cLvl)\nExample: &lt;a href=\"Flash%20Heal\"&gt;Flash Heal&lt;/a&gt; 4\nFlash Heal 4 is a level 26 &lt;a href=\"Priest\"&gt;Priest&lt;/a&gt; spell. For a level 70 player, the multiplier for Flash Heal 4 is therefore Min(1, (26 + 11) / 70) = 0.529. This is in addition to the multiplier reduction due to Flash Heal's cast time - the final multiplier, including this, is 0.227\nLevel 20 penalty.\nThe original form of downranking penalty was the Level 20 penalty, applied to all spells level 20 and below based on the level the spell was learned. This applies from the moment the spell is acquired, but it usually does not matter to the lower level characters as &lt;a href=\"spell%20power\"&gt;spell power&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"gear\"&gt;gear&lt;/a&gt; is rarely available until later in a character's progression.\nCalculation:\nsLvl = Level that the spell is acquired at\nLevel 20 Penalty Multiplier = 1 - ((20 - sLvl) * 0.0375)"}

I\u2019ll divert my attention away from my vital research to waste time discussing my work with an appliance who won\u2019t comprehend it, so you can report it to someone who won\u2019t listen, so he can decide whether my work is up to standards that haven\u2019t been set, because he never understood what I was working on to begin with. Does that sum things up? Hm?\nGuh.\nIn life, when I could still taste, feel, and experience happiness, I wasted precious hours studying mathematics. As a banshee, I chose to research a less unsavory subject: the emancipation, analysis, and practical application of souls. I have founded an entirely new field of study. I call it Soulology!\nI\u2019ve approached my studies methodically and precisely. What I\u2019ve learned has enabled me to develop entirely new technologies to cheaply and efficiently harvest souls, refine them, and then focus them into to their purest essence. And I can do it with finer precision and with greater care than the clumsy manipulations managed by most Warlocks.\nBEHOLD THE SOULARIUM\nWhile the living are . . . crude in their base form, the souls they contain are truly remarkable! Once freed from their fleshy prisons, they soar free to become a readily accessible energy source far richer and more versatile than Stormsurge\u2019s ludicrous light shows. And there are other perks as well: terrifyingly powerful weapons! Vast amounts of information delivered instantly! Fewer gnomes!\nI\u2019ve even developed a prototype that allows for soul essence transposition. Why travel from place to place, when you can simply swap essence with another creature that is already where you wish to be?\nOf course, there are always challenges. . . . Zerek has been helpful, but I could always use more test subjects. And the souls are remarkably persistent in maintaining a connection with their erstwhile hosts. Also, while the Soularium grants access to impressive stores of knowledge, the sudden catastrophic memory loss is\u2014admittedly\u2014something of an inconvenience. \nStill, I\u2019m certain that Dr. Boom will agree that what I\u2019ve accomplished here is among the most important breakthroughs in Boom Labs. Now, fetch me some more gnomes. I have work to do."}

Players must have completed &lt;a href=\"Translating%20the%20Ledger\"&gt;Translating the Ledger&lt;/a&gt; before will offer this quest.\nObjectives.\nFind Narain Soothfancy's book, buried on an island in the &lt;a href=\"South%20Seas\"&gt;South Seas&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nI knew that book would come in handy some day! Thankfully, I had the wit and foresight to stow it somewhere safe.\nDon't worry, it's in a place that nobody could ever hope to find it! I needed a gyrocopter just to get there the first time. Unfortunately I crashed it on the beach on my way back. It was through that accident that I gained these super-gnomish psychic powers!\nLook for my crashed gyrocopter somewhere on &lt;a href=\"Land%27s%20End%20Beach\"&gt;Land's End Beach&lt;/a&gt; and swim south from there! You'll know the spot when you see it!\nRewards.\nUpon completion of this quest you will gain:\nCompletion.\nThe book is gone! On top of the dirt mound is a note.\nNotes.\nIn order to complete this quest, a short side quest or certain buffs are necessary. As the island that the &lt;a href=\"Freshly%20Dug%20Dirt\"&gt;Freshly Dug Dirt&lt;/a&gt; is on is in the &lt;a href=\"Fatigue\"&gt;Fatigue&lt;/a&gt; waters southeast of &lt;a href=\"Land%27s%20End%20Beach\"&gt;Land's End Beach&lt;/a&gt;, so there must be some way to increase swim speed so players aren't forced to suffer several unnecessary deaths.\nFortunately, is in the waters just off the beach. Talk to her and she offers a one-off quest, &lt;a href=\"Love%20Song%20for%20Narain\"&gt;Love Song for Narain&lt;/a&gt; that has you deliver her love letter to Narain. After Narain predictably stammers out a \"no\", talk to her again and she will buff you with a swim speed increase buff. Use this buff to swim to the island before the Fatigue timer runs out.\nYou can also reach the island by means of other buffs. You can use a shaman's &lt;a href=\"Water%20Walking\"&gt;Water Walking&lt;/a&gt; spell, or &lt;a href=\"Elixir%20of%20Water%20Walking\"&gt;Elixir of Water Walking&lt;/a&gt;, then travel to the island riding a &lt;a href=\"mount\"&gt;mount&lt;/a&gt;. A priest's &lt;a href=\"Levitate\"&gt;Levitate&lt;/a&gt; spell to run across the surface of the water will not work without additional boosts in speed. You can also reach the island if you are a druid who owns the Glyph of Aquatic Form."}

The dracthyr were created in the ancient past at &lt;a href=\"Aberrus\"&gt;Aberrus&lt;/a&gt; by the black &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspect\"&gt;Dragon Aspect&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Neltharion&lt;/a&gt;, who combined the essence of dragons with the adaptability of the mortal races to create a race of ideal soldiers. Neltharion fashioned the &lt;a href=\"Forbidden%20Reach\"&gt;Forbidden Reach&lt;/a&gt; off the coast of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt; to serve as the dracthyr soldiers' training ground, but after a terrible battle against the &lt;a href=\"Primalists\"&gt;Primalists&lt;/a&gt;, Neltharion put the dracthyr into a slumber that lasted. Recently, the Primalists' return caused the dracthyr to stir, and they now seek to forge their own path in &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; by joining both the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe dracthyr are divided into armies known as &lt;a href=\"weyrn\"&gt;weyrn&lt;/a&gt;s, each led by a Scalecommander. &lt;a href=\"Scalecommander%20Azurathel\"&gt;Scalecommander Azurathel&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Warders\"&gt;Obsidian Warders&lt;/a&gt; joined the Alliance, while &lt;a href=\"Scalecommander%20Cindrethresh\"&gt;Scalecommander Cindrethresh&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Talons\"&gt;Dark Talons&lt;/a&gt; joined the Horde. &lt;a href=\"Scalecommander%20Viridia\"&gt;Scalecommander Viridia&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Healing%20Wings\"&gt;Healing Wings&lt;/a&gt; traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href=\"Scalecommander%20Sarkareth\"&gt;Scalecommander Sarkareth&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Ebon%20Scales\"&gt;Ebon Scales&lt;/a&gt; defected from the dracthyr army after feeling abandoned by Neltharion and renamed themselves the &lt;a href=\"Sundered%20Flame\"&gt;Sundered Flame&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Scalecommander%20Emberthal\"&gt;Scalecommander Emberthal&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Adamant%20Vigil\"&gt;Adamant Vigil&lt;/a&gt; was wiped out by the &lt;a href=\"Primalists\"&gt;Primalists&lt;/a&gt;, and she remained in the Forbidden Reach to search for answers.\nHistory.\nThe dracthyr were created by &lt;a href=\"Neltharion\"&gt;Neltharion&lt;/a&gt; the Earth-Warder, &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspect\"&gt;Dragon Aspect&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;. Neltharion was concerned at the rift between the Dragon Aspects and &lt;a href=\"Primal%20Incarnates\"&gt;Primal Incarnates&lt;/a&gt;, and he knew a war was coming even though &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; thought she could soothe tensions with only words. The &lt;a href=\"drakonid\"&gt;drakonid&lt;/a&gt; were slow, and &lt;a href=\"dragonspawn\"&gt;dragonspawn&lt;/a&gt; fragile, but Neltharion saw potential in the mortal races that had begun to emerge across the world. He created the dracthyr as ideal soldiers, combining the essence of dragons with the traits of mortal races. While the direct processes used were largely unknown, the dark history of the dracthyr were immortalized in the halls of &lt;a href=\"Aberrus%2C%20the%20Shadowed%20Crucible\"&gt;Aberrus, the Shadowed Crucible&lt;/a&gt;. Countless experiments were conducted before anything even resembling a dracthyr could be created, primarily done so by experimenting on and augmenting &lt;a href=\"drakonid\"&gt;drakonid&lt;/a&gt;s; often to horrific results.\nWhile other dragonkin were sturdy and loyal, they lacked the cleverness and adaptability needed to fight the war that Neltharion felt was sure to come against those who defied the reign of the Aspects. They would embody the might of all five &lt;a href=\"dragonflight\"&gt;dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;s, instilled with the potential of the mortal races that had begun to spread across the world. They were to be the ultimate soldiers. Neltharion fashioned the &lt;a href=\"Forbidden%20Reach\"&gt;Forbidden Reach&lt;/a&gt; as a secret training ground for the dracthyr. He also used the &lt;a href=\"Oathbinder\"&gt;Oathbinder&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; relic to infuse his dracthyr soldiers with &lt;a href=\"Order\"&gt;Order&lt;/a&gt; magic, bounding them to his will. In a battle with &lt;a href=\"Raszageth\"&gt;Raszageth&lt;/a&gt; and the Primalists, the Oathbinder was destroyed. Though Raszageth was sealed away, Neltharion could no longer directly control the dracthyr without the relic and so deemed them a risk. He contacted his best friend &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt;, beside himself and telling Malygos everything was falling apart and the dracthyr needed to be contained.\nDragonflight.\nThe dracthyr were ordered to the creches beneath the Forbidden Reach by Neltharion, where they were sealed away by Malygos in magical stasis and watched over by his &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;. They remained there, abandoned and forgotten for nearly 20,000 years, awakened from their long slumber only when the &lt;a href=\"Primalists\"&gt;Primalists&lt;/a&gt; returned to break &lt;a href=\"Raszageth\"&gt;Raszageth&lt;/a&gt; free, as an ancient, magical surge rippled through the Forbidden Reach, the dracthyr awoke, but from their long stasis their memories became a blur.\nAs a powerful storm was unleashed by Raszageth, the dracthyr evacuated the Forbidden Reach, the only home they ever knew. After Raszageth's attack, the dracthyr of the &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Warders\"&gt;Obsidian Warders&lt;/a&gt; journeyed with &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, where they joined the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. The dracthyr of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Talons\"&gt;Dark Talons&lt;/a&gt; journeyed with &lt;a href=\"Ebyssian\"&gt;Ebyssian&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, where they joined the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. While there, these dracthyr learned about visage forms from Ebyssian and Wrathion and were able to adopt mortal visages in order to better commune with other races.\nMany &lt;a href=\"Dracthyr%20Freshscale\"&gt;Dracthyr Freshscale&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Eager%20Freshscale\"&gt;Eager Freshscale&lt;/a&gt;s later traveled to &lt;a href=\"Algeth%27ar%20Academy\"&gt;Algeth'ar Academy&lt;/a&gt; to learn more about the powers of the dragonflights and pledge to serve one of them, with each of the five dragonflights sending recruiters.\nDuring their pursuit of &lt;a href=\"Scalecommander%20Sarkareth\"&gt;Scalecommander Sarkareth&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Forbidden%20Reach\"&gt;Forbidden Reach&lt;/a&gt;, Ebyssian and Emberthral alongside the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; came across the imprisoned black dragon &lt;a href=\"Adamanthia\"&gt;Adamanthia&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"High%20Creche\"&gt;High Creche&lt;/a&gt;. As they observed her state of imprisonment, they realized that she was not only alive, but that her petrification was caused when Neltharion siphoned the black dragon's essence from the drachtyr.\nWithin &lt;a href=\"Aberrus%2C%20the%20Shadowed%20Crucible\"&gt;Aberrus, the Shadowed Crucible&lt;/a&gt;, adventurers encountered the forgotten experiments - &lt;a href=\"Zskarn\"&gt;Zskarn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Neldris\"&gt;Neldris&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Rionthus\"&gt;Rionthus&lt;/a&gt; who was classified as \"Experiment 328\", the earliest known \"successful\" version of Dracthyr to exist.\nCulture.\nThe dracthyr see Neltharion as both their general and their father.\nDracthyr keep signets on their horns which function like military . The dracthyr's name is inscribed on the signet so that any dead bodies can be identified and remembered.\n\"Talon\" is a junior rank in the dracthyr army.\nIf a dracthyr dishonors their creche, the rules dictate that they must fall honorably in battle.\nBeing created only to fight and kill, they may have initial trouble with other things such as crafting and the arts. As a race created to be soldiers, they weren't taught the concept of vacations or weekends and need it explained to them. However recreation isn't entirely alien to them, since they know about the sport &lt;a href=\"Talon%20Toss\"&gt;Lish Llrath&lt;/a&gt;.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Falastrasz\"&gt;Falastrasz&lt;/a&gt;, the dracthyr may be young, but what they lack in experience they make up for with a boundless thirst for knowledge.\nWeyrns.\nThe dracthyr army is divided into factions called &lt;a href=\"weyrn\"&gt;weyrn&lt;/a&gt;s, with each dracthyr assigned to a weyrn that best matches their skills. Each weyrn is led by a Scalecommander, a dracthyr chosen and groomed for the position by the Earth-Warder himself. Members of a weyrn are as close as clutch-mates; it is a bond that shall never be broken, forged of duty and honor in service to dragonkind.\nEvokers.\nEvery dracthyr is an expert soldier. Whatever weyrn they belong to, they use their talents to defend dragonkind in service to the Earth-Warder. Yet even among such illustrious ranks, there are a select few who transcend the skills of their kin, who are able to master the specialties of all weyrns and shift between roles at will. These are the &lt;a href=\"evoker\"&gt;evoker&lt;/a&gt;s, the best of the best, finest of the finest.\nThese elite forces possess the rare potential to focus their essences into an instrument of preservation or a weapon of devastation. The journey to such mastery is long, and few dracthyr can see this path through. But those who learn to harness their full potential shall be honored with the title of evoker.\nSpeculation.\nThe &lt;a href=\"dragonman\"&gt;dragonman&lt;/a&gt; race are also dragons combined with mortals, and the &lt;a href=\"chromatic%20dragonflight\"&gt;chromatic dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; are also dragons that use the powers of all five flights. Both of them may have been &lt;a href=\"Nefarian\"&gt;Nefarian&lt;/a&gt;'s attempts to replicate his father's dracthyr."}
