The subgroup arose by adapting to the beating of the hot Tanaris sun after being separated from their &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; brethren in the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;.\nA sand troll &lt;a href=\"empire\"&gt;empire&lt;/a&gt; has never been formed - in fact the only known tribes of sand trolls are the &lt;a href=\"Farraki%20tribe\"&gt;Farraki&lt;/a&gt; (also known as the Sandfury) and &lt;a href=\"Sandscalp%20tribe\"&gt;Sandscalp&lt;/a&gt; tribes. Sand trolls mostly keep to themselves and attack all outsiders.\nHistory.\nAncient history.\nSeveral thousand years prior to the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, the Sandfury tribe (then known as the Razorbranch tribe) was originally part of the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20Empire\"&gt;Gurubashi Empire&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt; split the jungle trolls' territory, which left the Sandfury in the middle of the desert of &lt;a href=\"Tanaris\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt;. The capital of the Sandfury is the troll city of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Farrak\"&gt;Zul'Farrak&lt;/a&gt;, but they have few other remaining settlements - Tanaris has long since reclaimed them, leaving it dotted with buried ruins. The trolls have been forced to give up the majority of Tanaris to outsiders, and are thus fierce to defend what remains theirs.\nElemental Unrest.\nThe Sandfury allied with the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; shortly prior to the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;. Under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Hydromancer%20Kulratha\"&gt;Hydromancer Kulratha&lt;/a&gt;, they attempted to summon &lt;a href=\"Kai%27ju%20Gahz%27rilla\"&gt;Kai'ju Gahz'rilla&lt;/a&gt; for the Twilight cult. This alliance did not appear to last long after that.\nTraveler.\n&lt;a href=\"Zathra\"&gt;Zathra&lt;/a&gt; is a mercenary hired by the &lt;a href=\"Hidden\"&gt;Hidden&lt;/a&gt; to track down the compass owned by &lt;a href=\"Greydon%20Thorne\"&gt;Greydon Thorne&lt;/a&gt;, and later by his son &lt;a href=\"Aramar%20Thorne\"&gt;Aramar Thorne&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Chief%20Ukorz%20Sandscalp\"&gt;Chief Ukorz Sandscalp&lt;/a&gt; is revealed to still be alive.\nPandaria.\nThe Sandfury, now calling themselves the Farraki, allied with &lt;a href=\"Zul\"&gt;Zul&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari troll&lt;/a&gt;s during their invasion of &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;. A large number of sand trolls can be found on the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Isle of Thunder&lt;/a&gt; and inside the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Throne of Thunder&lt;/a&gt;.\nDraenor.\nA single sand troll, &lt;a href=\"Defector%20Dazgo\"&gt;Defector Dazgo&lt;/a&gt;, apparently joined the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt; on .\nBattle for Azeroth.\nOnce again referred to as the Sandfury, they can be found at &lt;a href=\"Tal%27farrak\"&gt;Tal'farrak&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"General%20Jakra%27zet\"&gt;General Jakra'zet&lt;/a&gt; is a sand troll on the &lt;a href=\"Zanchuli%20Council\"&gt;Zanchuli Council&lt;/a&gt;, the leading council of the Zandalari. He earned his place after the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; crushed his people to dust, and so he does not like the Horde.\nCulture.\nTo survive the harsh desert lands the Farraki trolls learned the secrets of &lt;a href=\"blood%20magic\"&gt;blood magic&lt;/a&gt; - drinking blood allowed them to access the darkest &lt;a href=\"voodoo\"&gt;voodoo&lt;/a&gt; powers. They also practice &lt;a href=\"necromancy\"&gt;necromancy&lt;/a&gt; upon their own dead, allowing their ancestors to help the tribe survive in their harsh desert environment. When you need every troll you have to help out to get by, having one of them die is a big problem, which is why the Farraki learned to raise the dead with &lt;a href=\"voodoo\"&gt;voodoo&lt;/a&gt;. Farraki &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;s are imbued with the darkest of &lt;a href=\"mojo\"&gt;mojo&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe powerful &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bwonsamdi\"&gt;Bwonsamdi&lt;/a&gt; watches over the spirits of the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear&lt;/a&gt; trolls, but many of the Farraki tribe's fallen members are offered no such protection after death. These tortured spirits obey &lt;a href=\"Witch%20Doctor%20Zum%27rah\"&gt;Zum'rah&lt;/a&gt;, a cruel &lt;a href=\"witch%20doctor\"&gt;witch doctor&lt;/a&gt; who uses his dark magic to force the city's dead into unending service.\nSand trolls are frequently cannibalistic, though not always.\nFaith.\nThe sand trolls have worshiped a monstrous &lt;a href=\"hydra\"&gt;hydra&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href=\"Gahz%27rilla\"&gt;Gahz'rilla&lt;/a&gt; for thousands of years. Ever wary of the beast's icy wrath, the trolls will only rouse Gahz'rilla when they have plentiful sacrifices to sate the ravenous creature's appetite. Within Zul'Farrak, the legendary hydra is a common motif in architecture and ornamentation. The ornamentation modeled after the hydra demigod is &lt;a href=\"Gahz%27ridian\"&gt;Gahz'ridian&lt;/a&gt; (as coined by &lt;a href=\"Marvon%20Rivetseeker\"&gt;Marvon Rivetseeker&lt;/a&gt;).\nLike most other &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; cultures, the sand trolls worship the &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt;: a complex pantheon of primal, often animalistic spirits and gods. It is unknown to what extent the sand trolls retain the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20Empire\"&gt;Gurubashi&lt;/a&gt; pantheon, but they are known to worship at least three loa: &lt;a href=\"Kimbul\"&gt;Eraka no Kimbul&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mueh%27zala\"&gt;Ueetay no Mueh'zala&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shadra\"&gt;Elortha no Shadra&lt;/a&gt;.\nAppearance.\nSand trolls have coarse, cracked skin tending toward brown and gold colors, (with some sand trolls being an orange-gold) bearing only a rough resemblance to their &lt;a href=\"jungle%20troll\"&gt;jungle troll&lt;/a&gt; ancestors. Sand trolls also have thinner manes of hair than their brethren. Sand troll females can be 6 feet tall. Whether 6' is short, tall or average for a female is unknown. Unlike most other trolls, whose tusks are of an ivory (lighter, sometimes darker) color, the tusks of sand trolls vary between dark gray to black.\nSand trolls have brown and striking blue eyes. &lt;a href=\"Sul%20the%20Sandcrawler\"&gt;Sul the Sandcrawler&lt;/a&gt; has white or silvery eyes. Undead sand trolls instead have golden eyes."}

He is the last Drust of this organization originally created by his people. Ulfar does not think highly of Gorak Tul, and believes Tul's twisted ways have disgraced their kind. Ulfar can be a hard teacher, but he's fair.\nHistory.\nIn his youth Ulfar was mentored by &lt;a href=\"Kivarr\"&gt;Kivarr&lt;/a&gt;, a wise and powerful Thornspeaker.\nUlfar was among the Drust who disagreed to &lt;a href=\"War%20against%20the%20Drust\"&gt;wage war against the human settlers&lt;/a&gt; thousands of years ago, prompting the &lt;a href=\"Thornspeakers\"&gt;Thornspeakers&lt;/a&gt; to leave the Drust and join Kul Tiran society. Some of the humans' Kul Tiran descendants heard the call of the wilds and sought to learn the ancient ways, which the Thornspeakers taught them. Now Ulfar is the only Drust Thornspeaker left.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nAfter gathering cores from &lt;a href=\"Drust%20construct\"&gt;Drust construct&lt;/a&gt;s at &lt;a href=\"Gol%20Koval\"&gt;Gol Koval&lt;/a&gt;, the Thornspeakers delivered the cores to Ulfar and told him of the Drust's return. When &lt;a href=\"Katherine%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Katherine Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; sought to save her daughter &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Thros\"&gt;Thros&lt;/a&gt; and the grip of Gorak Tul, &lt;a href=\"Lucille%20Waycrest\"&gt;Lucille Waycrest&lt;/a&gt; directed an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; to Ulfar. Ulfar at first did not want to aid them for he felt the door to the Blighted Lands should remain closed, but an attack from Gorak Tul made Ulfar realize that Thros was already open and its denizens no longer confined to their own realm.\nAs &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Admiral\"&gt;Lord Admiral&lt;/a&gt;, Jaina would commission &lt;a href=\"Dorian%20Atwater\"&gt;Dorian Atwater&lt;/a&gt; to build a &lt;a href=\"Anduin%27s%20vessel\"&gt;special ship&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;. Wood for the vessel was sourced from the &lt;a href=\"Algerson%20Lumber%20Yard\"&gt;Algerson Lumber Yard&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Boralus\"&gt;Boralus&lt;/a&gt;, though the shipment needed to first be purified of dark influence with the aid of the Thornspeakers. Ulfar succeeded in cleansing the wood at their request and sent the Thornspeakers to &lt;a href=\"Stormsong%20Valley\"&gt;Stormsong Valley&lt;/a&gt; to further aid construction. Ulfar himself later made an appearance at &lt;a href=\"Port%20Fogtide\"&gt;Port Fogtide&lt;/a&gt; for the ship's blessing.\nShadowlands.\nSeeking to save the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Fae\"&gt;Night Fae&lt;/a&gt; possessed by the &lt;a href=\"Drust\"&gt;Drust&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt; sent the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt;s among the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Fae%20Covenant\"&gt;Night Fae Covenant&lt;/a&gt; to Ulfar for guidance, who she had met during her life. He recognized the curse in question and revealed that they would need to claim a portion of &lt;a href=\"Gorak%20Tul\"&gt;Gorak Tul&lt;/a&gt;'s power to break it. He subsequently sent them to imbue a &lt;a href=\"Drust%20Fetish\"&gt;Drust Fetish&lt;/a&gt; with Gorak Tul's power and warned them to handle the fetish with caution, when the task was completed. He then sent them to return to the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt; and seek out Kivarr, his old mentor, believing that she could offer the guidance that he cannot.\nUltimately it was discovered there was no way to liberate those possessed by the Drust, as &lt;a href=\"Gorak%20Zhar\"&gt;Gorak Zhar&lt;/a&gt;'s power was too great."}

As punishment, Sargeras imprisoned Ulthalesh's spirit in &lt;a href=\"Ulthalesh%2C%20the%20Deadwind%20Harvester\"&gt;the scythe&lt;/a&gt; of the same name.\nBiography.\nIn the ancient past, Ulthalesh was one of the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s who were defeated by the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; and imprisoned in the realm of &lt;a href=\"Mardum%2C%20the%20Shattered%20Abyss\"&gt;Mardum&lt;/a&gt;. Ulthalesh ruled Mardum with an iron fist and plotted for the day when he could take revenge on Sargeras. When the titan returned and shattered Mardum to recruit forces for the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, scores of demons refused to join him and instead rallied around Ulthalesh. In answer to the challenge, Sargeras forged a great &lt;a href=\"felsteel\"&gt;felsteel&lt;/a&gt; scythe and used it to harvest the souls of the rebellious demons, trapping them in a new prison. Ulthalesh, the strongest of will, was the last to be devoured. Sargeras named the weapon \"&lt;a href=\"Ulthalesh%2C%20the%20Deadwind%20Harvester\"&gt;Ulthalesh&lt;/a&gt;\" after the dreadlord who had opposed him.\nUlthalesh's spirit gave the scythe great strength, but also a curse. The scythe obeyed its wielders' commands until they were mortally wounded, at which point Ulthalesh consumed their souls. Over centuries, Sargeras bestowed the blade on numerous servants, only for Ulthalesh to devour their spirits. Over the wailing of souls trapped in the weapon, the titan could hear the dreadlord's laughter. During the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, Sargeras gave the scythe to the &lt;a href=\"eredar\"&gt;eredar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sataiel\"&gt;Sataiel&lt;/a&gt;, who used it to completely drain the life from the land now known as &lt;a href=\"Deadwind%20Pass\"&gt;Deadwind Pass&lt;/a&gt;, creating a powerful magical nexus in the process. Sataiel knew she should inform Sargeras of this new power source, but Ulthalesh whispered to her from within the scythe, convincing her to keep the nexus to herself and hide from the Legion until the two of them had gathered enough strength to kill Sargeras himself.\nWhen Sargeras discovered Sataiel's betrayal centuries later, he manipulated &lt;a href=\"Scavell\"&gt;Scavell&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardian of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt;, into hunting her down and killing her. Scavell then hid the scythe where no one could find it, but Sargeras knew that Ulthalesh had become even stronger from Sataiel's spirit and that he was still plotting on challenging the Dark Titan. Centuries later, Sargeras\u2014now possessing the Guardian &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;\u2014sent the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Riders\"&gt;Dark Riders&lt;/a&gt; to find the scythe and hide it in the &lt;a href=\"Karazhan%20Catacombs\"&gt;Karazhan Catacombs&lt;/a&gt; in order to deny Ulthalesh any further opportunities to gain more power through finding new wielders.\nAccording to \"&lt;a href=\"%3AA%20Hypothetical%20Examination%20of%20the%20Legion%27s%20Weaknesses\"&gt;:A Hypothetical Examination of the Legion's Weaknesses&lt;/a&gt;\", a tome outlawed and deemed apocryphal by the Legion, the scythe is one of the few things in the universe that Sargeras fears. Ulthalesh does not care about the fate of its wielder, since if they die and are consumed by him, he only becomes more powerful. He has been playing his game with Sargeras for millennia and \"knows the meaning of patience\". During the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the scythe was retrieved from Karazhan by a &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;champion&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20the%20Black%20Harvest\"&gt;Council of the Black Harvest&lt;/a&gt;. As of the end of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; believes that the weapon is still in the hands of the champion. Khadgar also believes that even though Sargeras has been defeated and imprisoned at the &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20the%20Pantheon\"&gt;Seat of the Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;, Ulthalesh still hopes to one day slay his old nemesis."}

{"id": "325903", "revid": "40372170", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=325903", "title": "Ultraxion", "text": "Ultraxion is the fifth boss to appear in the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt; raid. He is so monstrous that he cannot land atop Wyrmrest Temple, so players must stand on the ledge and battle him as he flies next to the temple. The damage in the fight is reminiscent of &lt;a href=\"Patchwerk\"&gt;Patchwerk&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt; with just ridiculous amounts of damage; a &lt;a href=\"gear%20check\"&gt;gear check&lt;/a&gt; boss. However, while Patchwerk was a simple &lt;a href=\"tank%20and%20spank\"&gt;tank and spank&lt;/a&gt;, Ultraxion has mechanics which can tax the coordination abilities of the raid.\nWorld first \"heroic\" kill on 25-man achieved 7.12.2011 by Exodus - US-Ysondre.\nBackground.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"More an abomination of dark energy than a dragon, Ultraxion has spent his short life absorbing the essence of captured &lt;a href=\"nether%20dragons\"&gt;nether dragons&lt;/a&gt;. Ultraxion is the only &lt;a href=\"twilight%20dragon\"&gt;twilight dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; has praised, and his arrogance is overshadowed only by the crackling energies surging through his twisted form. Loyal to his master, Ultraxion swears to bring about the fall of &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nAbilities.\nAfter 6 minutes have passed, Ultraxion will cast Twilight Eruption, a 5 second cast that will instantly wipe the raid.\nStrategy.\nUltraxion is a DPS and healing race, requiring the group to handle a tank-swapping mechanic while doing high DPS to the boss and surviving constant AoE damage and the Hour of Twilight effect.\nThe fight takes place in the Twilight Realm, and players must be in the realm to do damage to Ultraxion. The Heroic Will ability, which appears on a &lt;a href=\"ExtraActionButton1\"&gt;big purple button&lt;/a&gt; in the center of the screen, allows players to escape the realm for several seconds. Using this ability properly is the key to surviving the fight.\nAll players need to be aware of the Hour of Twilight cast, which comes about once a minute (45 seconds on normal). One person (or three in 25-man) must remain in the twilight realm or the raid will instantly wipe; the other players must use their Heroic Will button to escape the twilight realm and avoid the damage.\nTanks.\nTanks must use damage reduction cooldowns to survive the Hour of Twilight - note the Last Defender of Azeroth buff which doubles the power and halves the cooldowns of these abilities. Tanks must also manage the Fading Light debuff. The current tank will receive the Fading Light debuff at some point; when he is about to die, the offtank must taunt Ultraxion and the current tank must use Heroic Will to survive Fading Light. After the Heroic Will ends, that tank will generate no threat for 5 seconds; he must then watch the offtank until the next Fading Light, and taunt to pick Ultraxion back up.\nDPS.\nDPS must watch for the Hour of Twilight effect, and be ready to use Heroic Will to survive it. DPS players can maximize their damage by saving the Heroic Will for the end of the Hour of Twilight cast bar. DPS should stack near the front of Ultraxion for AoE heals. If DPS receives the Fading Light debuff, they must use Heroic Will when they have just a few seconds left before the Fading Light effect triggers.\nHealers.\nHealers need to heal the AoE damage from Unstable Monstrosity, which is split among the entire raid. The cast rate for this AoE gets faster every minute the fight goes on, starting at once per six seconds and peaking at one tick per second for the last minute before the enrage at six minutes. Throughout the fight, Alexstrasza, Ysera, and Kalecgos will provide assistance in the form of buffs for the healers, Each of these buffs can only be given to one healer at a time, so decide wisely who should get them. Normally the red buff is best used on Holy Priests (Renew, Prayer of Healing, HW:Sanc) and Druids (Wild Growth, Rejuv, Lifebloom), the green buff for Holy Paladins (Divine Light) and Shamans (Greater Healing Wave), and the blue buff for Shamans (Chain Heal spam), Disc Priests (Prayer of Healing spam) and Paladins (Holy Radiance spam), though depending on the healers different combinations might work just as well.\nFading Light details.\nPeriodically throughout the fight Ultraxion will cast Fading Light on the tank and one (for 10-man, three for 25-man) other player(s). Each affected player will get a debuff with a timer between 5 and 9 seconds. If the player is still in the twilight realm when the buff expires they die. To avoid this use Heroic Will to exit the twilight realm when the buff has around 3 seconds remaining. Since Heroic Will only lasts 5 seconds if you use it too early you will return to the twilight realm in time to be killed by Fading Light. If you do not use it at all you will be killed by Fading Light. \nIf you have lag you are somewhat doomed.\nHeroic Mode and surviving Hour of Twilight.\nFor difficulty levels other than LFR, a certain number of players must remain in the twilight realm during Hour of Twilight (and be exposed to massive damage) to avoid a wipe.\nIn 10-man normal the default tactic is to have the tanks take turns because Last Defender of Azeroth guarantees that every properly-specced tank has an appropriate 90-second survival cooldown. Optimizations are possible (such as a DK with &lt;a href=\"Anti-Magic%20Shell\"&gt;Anti-Magic Shell&lt;/a&gt; eating all of the Hour of Twilight).\nFor 25-man or heroic this means that some non-tank players who can survive a 300,000 point hit must remain in the twilight realm and absorb the Hour of Twilight.\nThe major complicating factor in heroic mode is the Looming Darkness. A player who suffers Hour of Twilight during a heroic encounter is afflicted by Looming Darkness which lasts for 2 minutes. If a player with Looming Darkness suffers another Hour of Twilight they are instantly killed. This means that players in heroic mode can not absorb an Hour of Twilight more than once every 3 casts or they will die (which is still preferrable to wiping).\nBuilding a successful cooldown rotation (and actually executing it) can be quite confusing if you don't have enough &lt;a href=\"Anti-Magic%20Shell\"&gt;Anti-Magic Shell&lt;/a&gt;. Consult the following chart to help you choose a rotation:\nNon-Tank Abilities.\nThe following abilities can be used by non-tanks to survive Hour of Twilight casts.\nKeep in mind that especially in 25m raids, external single-target and raid cooldowns can also be used to keep players alive, especially non-tanks that are required to soak. Effective single-target cooldowns are &lt;a href=\"Pain%20Suppression\"&gt;Pain Suppression&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20Spirit\"&gt;Guardian Spirit&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Hand%20of%20Sacrifice\"&gt;Hand of Sacrifice&lt;/a&gt;, while raid cooldowns that can allow players to survive include the T13 4-piece tank bonuses (Vampiric Brood and Shield Fortress), &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Guardian\"&gt;Divine Guardian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rallying%20Cry\"&gt;Rallying Cry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Anti-Magic%20Zone\"&gt;Anti-Magic Zone&lt;/a&gt;, and . Depending on your raid composition, multiple cooldowns may need to be stacked to ensure every player's survival.\nDPS death knights with &lt;a href=\"Anti-Magic%20Shell\"&gt;Anti-Magic Shell&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Icebound%20Fortitude\"&gt;Icebound Fortitude&lt;/a&gt;, balance/restoration druids with &lt;a href=\"Barkskin\"&gt;Barkskin&lt;/a&gt;, holy/ret paladins with &lt;a href=\"Glyph%20of%20Divine%20Protection\"&gt;Glyph of Divine Protection&lt;/a&gt;, enhancement shamans with &lt;a href=\"Shamanistic%20Rage\"&gt;Shamanistic Rage&lt;/a&gt;, and destruction warlocks with &lt;a href=\"Glyph%20of%20Soul%20Link\"&gt;Glyph of Soul Link&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nether%20Protection\"&gt;Nether Protection&lt;/a&gt; are not necessarily able to eat an Hour of Twilight without assistance, but have excellent mitigation abilities and hence are excellent candidates for staying out with help from the above cooldowns. \nThe Heroic Will effect can be bound to the \"Extra Action\" keybinding. If you use an addon that changes your interface, this may prevent trouble with the button. An alternative to permanently assigning a key binding is to create a macro of \nand load it onto your action bars for the fight.\nSolo Strategy.\nSoloing Ultraxion is a challenging DPS race because you must kill Ultraxion before the first Hour of Twilight. Use all your DPS cooldowns immediately and kill the boss as quickly as possible.\nTo solo Ultraxion 25H at level 100, an item level of 650 or higher is recommended.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;\nSpeculation.\nIt is possible Ultraxion was originally meant to be &lt;a href=\"Chromatus\"&gt;Chromatus&lt;/a&gt;, possibly because animating a chimaera-like being turned out too hard for the developers. Chromatus just disappeared from the story, and Ultraxion drops a chromatic drake mount. It could also explain why the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; was present in the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Eternity%20%28Dragon%20Soul%29\"&gt;Eye of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;, as Chromatus was originally imprisoned in an &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Prison\"&gt;Arcane Prison&lt;/a&gt;, technology of the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;Blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;."}

The warden will also be immediately aware if her target dies while his name is on the blade's handle.\nThis odd weapon is a moon sword - a curved night elf blade that forms an almost complete circle. The umbra crescent's dark length is covered in mystic Kaldorei runes that glint with silver luminance.\nThe wielder can inscribe the name of a given quarry on the blade's handle. This target must be a creature the wielder is tracking down. The umbra crescent gives the general direction of the target and grants the wielder the ability to recognize him regardless of disguise or\nattempts to conceal his identity with magic. Should the target die while his name is on the blade's handle, the wielder is immediately aware of the fact. While the target lives and is not within 5 feet of the wielder, the name cannot be changed."}

Although the area is almost completely isolated from the rest of the world and sandwiched between three deserts, the crater is filled with exotic plant life and even more exotic creatures. Ranging from peaceful &lt;a href=\"earth%20elemental\"&gt;earth elemental&lt;/a&gt;s to raging &lt;a href=\"devilsaur\"&gt;devilsaur&lt;/a&gt;s, the locals are not to be trifled with.\nPlayers will want to farm &lt;a href=\"Ravasaur%20Hatchling\"&gt;Ravasaur Hatchling&lt;/a&gt; and do dailies for &lt;a href=\"Whistle%20of%20the%20Venomhide%20Ravasaur\"&gt;Whistle of the Venomhide Ravasaur&lt;/a&gt; in this zone. In addition, circling the border of Un'goro is an excellent way to farm &lt;a href=\"Thorium%20Ore\"&gt;Thorium Ore&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Un%27Goro%20Madness\"&gt;Un'Goro Madness&lt;/a&gt; event happens here.\nHistory.\nAncient history.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s shaped &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Freya\"&gt;Freya&lt;/a&gt; designed Un'Goro Crater to be an area for experimentation along with &lt;a href=\"Sholazar%20Basin\"&gt;Sholazar Basin&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt;. All three locations were places where the power of the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; had coalesced. The &lt;a href=\"Wild%20God\"&gt;Wild God&lt;/a&gt;s emerged from these cradles of life. According to &lt;a href=\"Nablya\"&gt;Nablya&lt;/a&gt; one might call Un'Goro Crater the titans' petri dish. This coincides with theories of Un'Goro being the home of the titans when they inhabited &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;.\nFrom the &lt;a href=\"Shaper%27s%20Terrace\"&gt;Shaper's Terrace&lt;/a&gt; Freya performed tests and experiments, though ever since she left, Nablya has taken her place to observe and watch over Un'Goro. Normally the titanic watchers do not interfere with the matters of Azeroth, but here in Un'Goro, they are free to take a more direct approach. As Un'Goro is the experimental ground of the Titans, it is their right to do so. Many of the creatures in the crater existed long before the titans arrived, but some did not. Nevertheless, they observe them all, without prejudice. Like &lt;a href=\"Sholazar%20Basin\"&gt;Sholazar Basin&lt;/a&gt;, Un'Goro is unusual ecologically and geographically, it contains &lt;a href=\"Power%20crystals\"&gt;crystal&lt;/a&gt; pylons, and has remnants of guardian constructs that protect the land.\nSome of the ancient &lt;a href=\"dinosaur\"&gt;dinosaur&lt;/a&gt;s of Un'Goro were nearly 300 feet long.\nRecent history.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Shifting%20Sands\"&gt;War of the Shifting Sands&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elven&lt;/a&gt; army was pushed back through Un'Goro Crater, to the borders of the &lt;a href=\"Tanaris\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt; desert. Something in Un'Goro prevented the &lt;a href=\"Qiraji\"&gt;Qiraji&lt;/a&gt; from being able to take the land.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nAn &lt;a href=\"Marshal%20Expeditions\"&gt;expedition&lt;/a&gt; troupe led by &lt;a href=\"Williden%20Marshal\"&gt;Williden&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hol%27anyee%20Marshal\"&gt;Hol'anyee Marshal&lt;/a&gt; set foot into the crater. However their endeavor was not fully prepared for everything, having underestimated the savagery of Un'Goro, and ended sooner than they wished. They sought higher ground from the savage beasts of the crater once their base camps were overrun, making their escape at &lt;a href=\"Marshal%27s%20Refuge\"&gt;Marshal's Refuge&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Elemental\"&gt;Elemental&lt;/a&gt;s &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Invasions%20%28Classic%29%E2%80%8E\"&gt;invaded&lt;/a&gt; the area only to be fought by the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj%20War\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj War&lt;/a&gt;, the area was invaded by the armies of &lt;a href=\"C%27Thun\"&gt;C'Thun&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt some point, the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kova%20Broadhorn\"&gt;Kova Broadhorn&lt;/a&gt; and her &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt; companion &lt;a href=\"Miles%20Corebender\"&gt;Miles Corebender&lt;/a&gt; came here to find the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dhambeela\"&gt;Dhambeela&lt;/a&gt;\nWrath of the Lich King.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Shaper%27s%20Terrace\"&gt;Shaper's Terrace&lt;/a&gt; was discovered while war ravaged &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; struck Azeroth, it disrupted the cloaking mechanism that kept a similar building as the &lt;a href=\"Shaper%27s%20Terrace\"&gt;Shaper's Terrace&lt;/a&gt; hidden.\nThe titans did not foresee the scenario that a member of an intelligent races discovered them there. So they required to perform some new tests. Marshal's Refuge was also attacked by &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Guardian\"&gt;Stone Guardian&lt;/a&gt;s, forcing the troupe to flee and find another shelter with a small number of casualties. Williden Marshal and his team built a new camp for them, &lt;a href=\"Marshal%27s%20Stand\"&gt;Marshal's Stand&lt;/a&gt;, which had some improvements when compared to their old refuge, indicating that they managed to adapt themselves to live at Un'Goro Crater.\nThe area between the &lt;a href=\"Lakkari%20Tar%20Pits\"&gt;Lakkari Tar Pits&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Marshlands\"&gt;Marshlands&lt;/a&gt; also changed, blooming with hundreds of flowers as a result of the &lt;a href=\"bloodpetal\"&gt;bloodpetal&lt;/a&gt;s. The blooming grew to such an extent that it begun to throw off the natural balance in the area.\nLegion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the border between Tanaris and Un'Goro was &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Invasions\"&gt;attacked&lt;/a&gt; by demons but was successfully defended by &lt;a href=\"Maximillian%20of%20Northshire\"&gt;Maximillian of Northshire&lt;/a&gt; and, surprisingly, &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Guardian\"&gt;Stone Guardian&lt;/a&gt;s.\nExploring Azeroth.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; wondered why &lt;a href=\"Sholazar%20Basin\"&gt;Sholazar Basin&lt;/a&gt; and Un'Goro Crater were shaped so similarly, his brother &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann&lt;/a&gt; theorized that it could be to see how two similar setups diverge over time, like a science experiment. Or that there was one thing the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s and their &lt;a href=\"keeper\"&gt;keeper&lt;/a&gt;s were trying to accomplish, and making two different places to work on it was better than one. However, these theories led Brann to wonder what they were trying to learn.\nGetting there.\nUn'Goro can be reached from &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt; to the west or &lt;a href=\"Tanaris\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt; to the east. In the South-Western most point of Tanaris there is a path between two dark-grey stone pillars (in &lt;a href=\"Thistleshrub%20Valley\"&gt;Thistleshrub Valley&lt;/a&gt;). In some places it is possible to jump into the crater in stages, avoiding death. However, those who don't want to take the chance can use the ramps leading down to the crater floor, found in southwestern &lt;a href=\"Tanaris\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt; and northeastern &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;. The flight path for the zone is south of the volcano, known as &lt;a href=\"Marshal%27s%20Stand\"&gt;Marshal's Stand&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeography.\nUn'Goro is a massive crater full of amazingly lush jungle and teeming with life. &lt;a href=\"Dinosaur\"&gt;Dinosaur&lt;/a&gt;s roam freely here, as the land is wild and unpredictable. At the center of the crater a volcano rises, and &lt;a href=\"fire%20elemental\"&gt;fire elemental&lt;/a&gt;s prowl. In addition, many strange and beautiful crystals dot the landscape, their purpose unknown to most but an object of research for some of the adventurous scientists camped in the area.\nThere are no &lt;a href=\"instance\"&gt;instance&lt;/a&gt;s in Un'Goro Crater, nor any &lt;a href=\"battleground\"&gt;battleground&lt;/a&gt;s.\nMaps and subregions.\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//wow.gamepressure.com/map.asp%3FID%3D37\"&gt;Topographic map of Un'Goro Crater&lt;/a&gt;\nNotable characters.\nAt Marshal's Stand, &lt;a href=\"Williden%20Marshal\"&gt;Williden Marshal&lt;/a&gt; has led a team of explorers and biologists to take refuge from the crater's monstrous wildlife.

Most quests in this area involve performing tasks for the scientists found at &lt;a href=\"Marshal%27s%20Stand\"&gt;Marshal's Stand&lt;/a&gt;, studying the life, history, and crystals of the crater. There is also a chain in which players help to identify and deal with the &lt;a href=\"silithid\"&gt;silithid&lt;/a&gt; menace which has appeared in southern Un'Goro.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Shaper%27s%20Terrace\"&gt;Shaper's Terrace&lt;/a&gt; was added in \"&lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;Wrath of the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;\".

Designed to celebrate the release of the \"\" expansion for \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\", the event debuted March 17, 2017, lasting for three days.\nDescription.\n\"The &lt;a href=\"dinosaur\"&gt;dinosaur&lt;/a&gt;s in Un'goro are getting restless. Time to go pay them a visit!\"\nEvent.\nUn'Goro Madness revolves around defeating a number of elite bosses, primarily giant dinosaurs. Similar to world bosses, each has a range of powerful abilities and will require a large group of players to defeat.\nThe only reward from defeating these bosses is the guaranteed drop, &lt;a href=\"Dino%20Mojo\"&gt;Dino Mojo&lt;/a&gt;, which cumulatively improves the damage dealt, damage taken, movement speed and size of both the player and their target. The buff lasts for 3 days, and is not active in &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"instance\"&gt;instance&lt;/a&gt;s, but can be useful for outside content, such as &lt;a href=\"world%20quest\"&gt;world quest&lt;/a&gt;s. With no cap on the number of stacks obtainable, the buff also serves for bragging rights, with advanced stacks granting an additional boost to the player's \"Awesomeness\" stat.\nEach boss currently active is marked on the Un'Goro Crater map with a large red X. The bosses respawn rapidly, with three usually active at a time. The order of respawns appears to be random, with a number of possible bosses spread across the zone.\nGameplay during the event typically sees one or more large groups of players rotating around the zone from boss to boss, in a more or less endless hunting party. After each boss defeat players throw their freshly looted Dino Mojo onto each other, buffing both themselves and their target. Since a single player can quickly gain high stacks if multiple other players choose them as their target, requests for the buff in /say or /yell are common.\nBosses.\nThe bosses are all golden elites. Some are based in existing mobs, while others are entirely new to the event.\nThe bosses vary substantially in difficulty. For example, Tyrantus is a simple melee boss who is easily defeated by most groups, while Akaridal summons a range of large adds with their own powerful abilities, and will often wipe groups. Sherazin and Queen Zavra are other examples of complex bosses with potentially fatal mechanics.\nAdaptations.\nMost bosses use one or more of the following 'Adaptations' as part of their special abilities. The term \"Adaptation\" is a reference to the new ability debuting in \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\" with the expansion."}

The &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Sundering&lt;/a&gt; shattered the jungle trolls' territory and isolated the Razorbranch, leaving them stranded in the middle of what swiftly became the desert of &lt;a href=\"Tanaris\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt;. The relentless desert sun of Tanaris beat down on the trolls, who gradually adapted to their harsh new environment, becoming &lt;a href=\"sand%20troll\"&gt;sand troll&lt;/a&gt;s, now known as the Sandfury tribe. Today they bear only a rough resemblance to the jungle trolls from whom they are descended.\nThe capital of the Sandfury is the troll city of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Farrak\"&gt;Zul'Farrak&lt;/a&gt;, but they have few other remaining settlements. Tanaris has long since reclaimed them, leaving it dotted with buried ruins. Since the Sundering, the sand trolls have been forced to give up the majority of Tanaris to outsiders, and are thus fierce to defend what remains of their lands.\nLong ago the Sandfury waged a brutal war against the &lt;a href=\"qiraji\"&gt;qiraji&lt;/a&gt;. The martyr &lt;a href=\"Theka%20the%20Martyr\"&gt;Theka&lt;/a&gt; was slain and thus Zul'Farrak still stands because of his brave sacrifice. Even in death he maintains a vigil over his beloved city, and it is said that the dozens of &lt;a href=\"insectoid\"&gt;insectoid&lt;/a&gt; warriors who killed him were cursed to live as mindless scarabs, scuttling at the martyr's side.\nThey worship &lt;a href=\"Gahz%27rilla\"&gt;Gahz'rilla&lt;/a&gt; as a deity. They also worship the &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Shadra\"&gt;Shadra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kimbul\"&gt;Kimbul&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Mueh%27zala\"&gt;Mueh'zala&lt;/a&gt;.\nModern era.\nBy a few years after the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, much of the Sandfury homeland lay in ruins, its cities squatted in by invading &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Wastewander\"&gt;Wastewander&lt;/a&gt; bandits. The tribe had developed hostility toward both the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the &lt;a href=\"silithid\"&gt;silithid&lt;/a&gt; descendants of the Aqir, and the goblins who founded the nearby city of &lt;a href=\"Gadgetzan\"&gt;Gadgetzan&lt;/a&gt; in service to the &lt;a href=\"Steamwheedle%20Cartel\"&gt;Steamwheedle&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Trade%20Prince\"&gt;Trade Prince&lt;/a&gt;s. Adventurers from those factions were in part attracted to Zul'Farrak due to , which was rumored to reside in Zul'Farrak. &lt;a href=\"Chief%20Ukorz%20Sandscalp\"&gt;Chief Ukorz Sandscalp&lt;/a&gt; was obsessed with restoring his tribe to its former glory, raised on stories of a time when trolls lorded over their ancient lands without interference from foreign interlopers. Nevertheless, new battles broke out daily between the sand trolls and a wide assortment of interlopers.\nThe Sandfury need every troll to pitch in just to scrape by, so they learned to raise the dead with voodoo so every troll could continue working even after death.\n&lt;a href=\"Sandsorrow%20Watch\"&gt;Sandsorrow Watch&lt;/a&gt; is a series of watchtowers used to keep an eye on their holdings. One watchtower was lost to the &lt;a href=\"Mithril%20Order\"&gt;Mithril Order&lt;/a&gt; group, led by &lt;a href=\"Trenton%20Lighthammer%E2%80%8E\"&gt;Trenton Lighthammer\u200e&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nShortly before the &lt;a href=\"the%20Shattering\"&gt;Shattering of the world&lt;/a&gt; the Sandfury trolls were working with &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;. Led by &lt;a href=\"Hydromancer%20Kulratha\"&gt;Hydromancer Kulratha&lt;/a&gt;, they attempted to have the great &lt;a href=\"hydra\"&gt;hydra&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kai%27ju%20Gahz%27rilla\"&gt;Kai'ju Gahz'rilla&lt;/a&gt; attack Stormwind and Thunder Bluff. Adventurers led by &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; defeated Gahz'rilla and killed Kulratha. \nAfter the Shattering the Sandfury did not seem to have a particularly active connection to the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;, having none of the ambassadors present in other cities such as &lt;a href=\"Shadowforge%20City\"&gt;Shadowforge&lt;/a&gt;. Neither Alliance nor Horde have made any moves to crush the trolls of Tanaris, although the &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Cartel\"&gt;Bilgewater Cartel&lt;/a&gt; goblins attempted to ally with the Dunemaul ogres that occupy several former troll settlements.\n&lt;a href=\"Ruuzlu\"&gt;Ruuzlu&lt;/a&gt;, right hand of Chief Ukorz Sandscalp, planned to use the tribe's &lt;a href=\"scarab\"&gt;scarab&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"basilisk\"&gt;basilisk&lt;/a&gt;s, and undead to retake Tanaris for the Sandfury empire.\nBy the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, Zul'Farrak had become a wasteland. In their desperation the Sandfury tribe joined the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; together with the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20tribe\"&gt;Gurubashi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Drakkari%20tribe\"&gt;Drakkari&lt;/a&gt; in their &lt;a href=\"War%20against%20the%20Zandalari\"&gt;attempt to reclaim their former glory&lt;/a&gt;.\nTraveler.\n&lt;a href=\"Shadra\"&gt;Shadra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kimbul\"&gt;Kimbul&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Mueh%27zala\"&gt;Mueh'zala&lt;/a&gt; were summoned by the Sandfury trolls at &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Farrak\"&gt;Zul'Farrak&lt;/a&gt; so they could sacrifice their prisoners - &lt;a href=\"Aramar%20Thorne\"&gt;Aramar Thorne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Makasa%20Flintwill\"&gt;Makasa Flintwill&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Taryndrella\"&gt;Taryndrella&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hackle\"&gt;Hackle&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Murky%20%28Traveler%29\"&gt;Murky&lt;/a&gt; - to them, although the loa refused their sacrifice, much to the trolls' surprise.\nMists of Pandaria.\nThe Farraki were a part of the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Invaders\"&gt;Zandalari Invaders&lt;/a&gt;, a group composed of the four main troll tribes united under the Zandalari banner. They arrived upon the northern shores of the mist-shrouded continent of &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;. They quickly dispatched their representatives to reforge their old alliance with the &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt;. In that expedition, the sand trolls used the name \"Farraki\".\n&lt;a href=\"General%20Jakra%27zet\"&gt;Jakra'zet&lt;/a&gt; was part of the sand troll forces in Pandaria. Despite the outcome of the Pandaria campaign, Jakra'zet's skill in strategy and tactics could not be denied. &lt;a href=\"Zul\"&gt;Prophet Zul&lt;/a&gt; advocated for Jakra'zet to be put on the &lt;a href=\"Zanchuli%20Council\"&gt;Zanchuli Council&lt;/a&gt;, the high council of the Zandalari, and he was also made general of the Zandalari army.\nLegion.\nThey were present during the &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Invasions\"&gt;Legion invasion&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Tanaris\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth and aftermath.\nOnce again referred to as the Sandfury, they can be found at &lt;a href=\"Tal%27farrak\"&gt;Tal'farrak&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt;. They, alongside the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20tribe\"&gt;Gurubashi&lt;/a&gt;, are harassing merchants by the dock. A Horde adventurer is sent to break these thugs up, before being sent into Tal'farrak to remind the Sandfury of their place.\n&lt;a href=\"General%20Jakra%27zet\"&gt;General Jakra'zet&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Vol%27dun\"&gt;Vol'dun&lt;/a&gt; commands a large host of Sandfury that betrays Rastakhan. Though they are ultimately defeated, their actions lead to the freeing of &lt;a href=\"Mythrax\"&gt;Mythrax&lt;/a&gt;, and later, the destruction of the final seal of &lt;a href=\"G%27huun\"&gt;G'huun&lt;/a&gt;. Despite this, not all Sandfury followed Jakra'zet in his betrayal. After &lt;a href=\"Rastakhan\"&gt;Rastakhan&lt;/a&gt; is slain in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Dazar%27alor\"&gt;Battle of Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt;, Sandfury warriors make up the procession that mourns him. Here, they are neutral to the Horde, fighting back only if attacked first.\nAfter the Fourth War, two Sandfury trolls were captured in the Mithril Order watchtower. They were to be interrogated about the legend of Sul'thraze."}

Though farseers were historically seen with &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; shaman in great numbers, most races that practice &lt;a href=\"shamanism\"&gt;shamanism&lt;/a&gt; seem to have farseers.\n&lt;a href=\"Dark%20shaman\"&gt;Dark shaman&lt;/a&gt; can be dark farseers.\nHistory.\nLong ago, the first Farseer of the &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt; was given a vision of the elements. In the vision, she foresaw the arrival of a new Farseer, one who would lead the Ring through a time of terrible crisis and unite the elements.\nAncient orc far seers represent the pinnacle of shamanistic power. These powerful shaman are counted amongst &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;'s closest advisors and are constantly in tune with the workings and maneuverings of the Horde. Far seers are not only tied to the elements of the earth and sky, but are also adept at foretelling the future. They can be granted visions of distant places and summon both the elements and &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20wolf\"&gt;spirit wolves&lt;/a&gt; to protect them. Far seers can &lt;a href=\"Chain%20Lightning\"&gt;summon lightning&lt;/a&gt; or the element of earth to induce a massive &lt;a href=\"Earthquake\"&gt;earthquake&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the demon-worshiping &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock clan&lt;/a&gt; that lived in &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac Mountains&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; had two farseers: &lt;a href=\"Mazrigos\"&gt;Mazrigos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Throk%27Feroth\"&gt;Throk'Feroth&lt;/a&gt;. They, along with the rest of the clan, were killed by the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"the%20Mag%27har\"&gt;the Mag'har&lt;/a&gt; were found by the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; coming from &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Among the Mag'har was a group of farseers called the &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Sons\"&gt;Lightning Sons&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; was named Farseer of the Earthen Ring, become the leader of the organization after Thrall's departure. &lt;a href=\"Nobundo\"&gt;Nobundo&lt;/a&gt; believed that the adventurer was the subject of the first Farseer's prophecy. The Farseer and the Earthen Ring went about restoring balance to the elements. This included visiting the elemental realms and assisting the elementals in finding a suitable leader after the deaths of &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Al%27akir\"&gt;Al'akir&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn Warcraft III.\nThe Far Seer is a &lt;a href=\"Hero%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;playable hero&lt;/a&gt; for the orc race in \"Warcraft III\". A mystical hero who is adept at commanding the elements, he can cast &lt;a href=\"Chain%20Lightning\"&gt;Chain Lightning&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Far%20Sight\"&gt;Far Sight&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Feral%20Spirit\"&gt;Feral Spirit&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Earthquake\"&gt;Earthquake&lt;/a&gt;. The only playable Far Seer in the campaign for both ' and ' is &lt;a href=\"Thrall%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Drek%27Thar%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Drek'Thar&lt;/a&gt; is briefly played in the &lt;a href=\"The%20Founding%20of%20Durotar\"&gt;bonus orc campaign&lt;/a&gt;.\nCustom names include: Gar'dal Grimsight, Negal Fireye, Kazil Darkeye, Magis Coldeye, Gorr Grimwolf, Kag'ar Winterfang, Morg Wolfsong, Kazragore, Fenris'ar Gul, Nazgrel.\nIn the RPG.\nThe far seers are an elite group of ancient orcs who represent the pinnacle of shamanistic power. These powerful shamans, who preside over matters mystical for the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, are counted amongst Thrall's closest advisors and are constantly in tune with the workings and maneuverings of the Horde. Far seers are not only tied to the elements of the earth and sky, but are also adept at foretelling the future. Their wisdom is outshined only by their courage and ferocity in combat. When the enemies of the horde advance, the far seers mount their loyal dire wolves and wade into battle wielding all the elemental powers of their shamanistic birthright.\nFar seers are adept at seeing places and events that are distant in both space and time, allowing them to foretell the future to a degree. Many say that they are the pinnacle of shamanistic development. The far seer is an orc tradition, but they sometimes train members of their allied races in its ways, especially tauren. These shaman are wise and often old. Most shaman of this type do not actually earn the title \"far seer\" until late in their lives, but they must begin training at an early age.\nFar seers are some of the most respected shaman in the Horde. Most of them ride great white wolves to battle \u2014 some say this practice is in homage of the Frostwolf clan, of which Thrall was the chieftain before he united the Horde. The orc far seer is the most respected of shaman. He is not a dedicated battlefield mage; however, the guidance provided by his visionary powers can prove to be more valuable than a dozen skilled warriors. In combat, a far seer prefers to sit back and summon spirits to do his bidding, but if he's pressed into melee, he can be a formidable adversary.\nIn addition to being the &lt;a href=\"warchief\"&gt;warchief&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; is also an accomplished and practicing far seer. He was trained by the ancient far seer &lt;a href=\"Drek%27Thar\"&gt;Drek'Thar&lt;/a&gt;."}

One of the most tragic heroes among the Broken of &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, Nobundo was formerly a &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"vindicator\"&gt;vindicator&lt;/a&gt; but lost the ability to call upon the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; during the fall of &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt; and was deformed by the fel energies released. Shunned by his people, Nobundo took up the calling of the shaman while wandering the wilds of Outland, and introduced it to his people with the blessing of the wise Prophet &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt;. He would accompany his people to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; onboard the \"&lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt;\", and guide new draenei shaman as they began on their path.\nIn the wake of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, Nobundo has lent his services to the &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt; to help calm the raging elements of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nOn &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, Nobundo was a member of the Vindicators and one of the greatest followers of &lt;a href=\"Akama\"&gt;Akama&lt;/a&gt;. He and &lt;a href=\"Maraad\"&gt;Maraad&lt;/a&gt; participated in the fights against &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s that were marching on &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt;. They found and killed &lt;a href=\"Hok%27lon\"&gt;Hok'lon&lt;/a&gt; and his generals, leaving the ogre forces in disarray. Rather than slaughter their foes, the draenei then immediately returned to Shattrath.\nHe met and spoke with the draenei &lt;a href=\"Shaka\"&gt;Shaka&lt;/a&gt; on brief occasions, and he always found her pleasant and engaging.\nUnbroken.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s betrayed the draenei, slowly but surely, the draenei cities such as &lt;a href=\"Karabor\"&gt;Karabor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Farahlon\"&gt;Farahlon&lt;/a&gt; were destroyed by the orcs, and Shattrath became their last holdout.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt; wanted to completely abandon Shattrath, his lieutenant &lt;a href=\"Exarch%20Larohir\"&gt;Exarch Larohir&lt;/a&gt; convinced him against it. Larohir knew enough draenei had to stay behind to be slaughtered to protect the rest, because if the orcs (and Kil'jaeden) weren't convinced they had wiped out the draenei they would never stop hunting them down. Velen reluctantly agreed, and so it was that as Velen and many other draenei fled, volunteer Vindicators under Larohir's command and even civilians (some with families) of Shattrath stayed behind to fight the orcs and buy the rest some time. Nobundo was one of the brave &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s who stayed behind to fight in the Siege of Shattrath.\nDuring the battle, there was an odd explosion, and &lt;a href=\"red%20mist\"&gt;red mist&lt;/a&gt; filled the air. From his defensive position on the wall, Nobundo could see this mist sickening the draenei, stinging their eyes, burning their lungs, causing retching, horrible migraines, and bloody vomiting. The mist rose up to Nobundo's position and afflicted him as well. It was then that he was confronted by an orc, whose description could only have been &lt;a href=\"Grom%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grom Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; holding &lt;a href=\"Gorehowl\"&gt;Gorehowl&lt;/a&gt;. He leaned back as Grom charged, Gorehowl slashing his chest through his armor instead of cleaving him in two and numbing his left side, while his &lt;a href=\"Hammer%20of%20the%20Naaru\"&gt;Hammer of the Naaru&lt;/a&gt;, a Light-blessed crystalline weapon, crushed the fingers of Grom's right hand; Grom only smiled. Unable to use Gorehowl, Grom grabbed hold of Nobundo with his left and when Nobundo tried to call on his powers of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;, he found that he could no longer use them. Unable to hold back any longer, he vomited thick blood onto Grom. Grom bellowed, headbutted him in the face, and let him fall from the wall, an &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt; below breaking his fall. The wall then collapsed, and he was covered with debris.\nHours passed, and he was awoken by the screams of draenei women. As he dragged himself out of the rubble, he was horrified to see the &lt;a href=\"Lower%20City\"&gt;Lower City&lt;/a&gt; as a dumping ground for the slaughtered draenei... including women and children. From the upper ledges such as &lt;a href=\"Aldor%20Rise\"&gt;Aldor Rise&lt;/a&gt;, they were being systematically tortured and murdered by the celebrating orcs, who then tossed the corpses down. Although he desperately wanted to help those captives, he was forced to admit that deep inside, he knew that the battle was over. Nobundo witnessed Shaka's death, and the guilt of his inability to help her haunted his dreams and echoed in his mind for a long time afterwards. Besides the fact that he was greatly outnumbered, his left leg was broken in the fall and he now had no Light powers to heal it with. He also could feel something inside him urging him to escape, to survive for a greater purpose, a greater destiny and someday make a difference once again. He managed to crawl out of Shattrath into &lt;a href=\"Terokkar%20Forest\"&gt;Terokkar Forest&lt;/a&gt;, only to pass out and be awakened in &lt;a href=\"Zangarmarsh\"&gt;Zangarmarsh&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe was supposedly found by the draenei who fled, as were other draenei who survived the battle, &lt;a href=\"Akama\"&gt;Akama&lt;/a&gt; (who was in a coma), &lt;a href=\"Korin\"&gt;Korin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Herac\"&gt;Herac&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Estes\"&gt;Estes&lt;/a&gt;. The other four who could walk were eventually banished, due to the red mist which in the end deformed them. The \"unaffected\" draenei called them \"Krokul\" \u2014 \"&lt;a href=\"Broken\"&gt;Broken&lt;/a&gt;\", and for that they could never be in contact with one of the draenei again. In one final act of adding insult to injury, Nobundo's Hammer of the Naaru was confiscated by a former friend named &lt;a href=\"Rolc\"&gt;Rolc&lt;/a&gt;, the last remaining piece of his past, and of who he once was.\nYears passed, with some Broken devolving further into the madness of the &lt;a href=\"Lost%20One\"&gt;Lost One&lt;/a&gt;s, or even committing suicide when this change was apparent. As for Nobundo, at night his sleep was always haunted by dreams of the slaughter at Shattrath City, the corpses of the dead women accusing him of cowardice and of abandoning them, and every day he would walk to the peak of a mountain and sit, praying, hoping, to somehow regain his mastery over the Light and that his nightmares would finally end.\nCountless times he did this, but would always go back to the Broken camps disappointed. Though one day, when his prayer was finally answered, no heavenly voice told him what to do, nor did a &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; descend from on high to aid him. No, Nobundo's prayers were answered by the &lt;a href=\"elemental%20spirit\"&gt;Wind&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs with generations of &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s, and countless other races, the wind revealed to Nobundo the delicate balance of nature, the powers and truth of the Five Elements and the path of the &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;. Guided to the mountains peaks of &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt; (perhaps it was the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Plateau\"&gt;Elemental Plateau&lt;/a&gt;), he began his training, taught by the elements themselves. He listened eagerly, and over the years, came to understand and follow this path.\nInvigorated by this new power, Nobundo set out to inform the draenei of his discovery, only to find that most draenei wouldn't listen to a broken. However, one draenei did listen to him: Velen.\nThe leader of the draenei realized that the way of the shaman, as well as the Light, was a path worth treading, and Nobundo became one of his inner circle. Velen also helped Nobundo to confirm to himself that his leaving Shattrath was not an act of cowardice, but was so that his survival would ensure that he would be able to embrace a destiny greater than he could of ever imagined. Despite everything that had happened to him, he had not given up, not even once, which is why the elements had contacted him, and why Velen himself had chosen him. His understanding of this made the elements proud, and from then on, Nobundo would no longer have the nightmares.\nWith Velen's support and encouragement, Noubundo met up with him at &lt;a href=\"Telredor\"&gt;Telredor&lt;/a&gt; in Zangarmarsh and introduced the shaman's path to the draenei, teaching all who were willing to listen. The shaman would eventually accompany Velen in the raid to retake the \"&lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt;\", and survived the crash on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. He remains there today, ready to share his knowledge with aspiring shamans in the service of the draenei \u2014 and now the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nFarseer Nobundo is a &lt;a href=\"shaman%20trainer\"&gt;shaman trainer&lt;/a&gt; located in the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Hall\"&gt;Crystal Hall&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"capital%20city\"&gt;capital city&lt;/a&gt; of the \"Exodar\", where he told his story to young draenei adventurers. He also directed young shaman in their training over the elements, sending them to &lt;a href=\"Aqueous\"&gt;Aqueous&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Velaada\"&gt;Velaada&lt;/a&gt;, and fashioning them shaman totems.\nHe is also part of the Alliance version of &lt;a href=\"Children%27s%20Week\"&gt;Children's Week&lt;/a&gt;, where the &lt;a href=\"Draenei%20Orphan\"&gt;Draenei Orphan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dornaa\"&gt;Dornaa&lt;/a&gt; shows Nobundo her shamanistic powers. He asked the orphan matron to allow Dornaa to study with him at the \"Exodar\".\nThe Cataclysm era.\n&lt;a href=\"Muln%20Earthfury\"&gt;Muln Earthfury&lt;/a&gt; asked &lt;a href=\"Krelna\"&gt;Krelna&lt;/a&gt; to send a runner to inform Nobundo and the other draenei shaman about &lt;a href=\"Shotoa\"&gt;Shotoa&lt;/a&gt;.\nVelen sent Nobundo to represent the draenei at &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;'s memorial and honor Magni's goal of trying to heal the earth and understand the elements. It is here that &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; sees him for the first time.\nIn addition to his role as the draenei race's primary shaman trainer, Nobundo assists &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; in maintaining the rift at the &lt;a href=\"Maelstrom\"&gt;Maelstrom&lt;/a&gt;. During the battle with &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; in the nightmare caused by &lt;a href=\"Iso%27rath\"&gt;Iso'rath&lt;/a&gt;, Nobundo uses the element of water to fight off Deathwing until he is ultimately killed.\nHe and many others see that Thrall is not able to help them, so instead Nobundo tried to help Thrall, but he is interrupted by a vivid &lt;a href=\"Rehgar%20Earthfury\"&gt;Rehgar Earthfury&lt;/a&gt;. After Thrall returned from his trip, Nobundo welcomed him.\nNobundo later traveled to &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, and is present to witness &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Aggra\"&gt;Aggra&lt;/a&gt; become life-mates.\nLater, when the Aspects were planning their battle against Deathwing, Thrall in earthen form was being tortured by Deathwing. After discovering this Nobundo, &lt;a href=\"Muln\"&gt;Muln&lt;/a&gt;, and Aggra tried to rescue him.\nTides of War.\nWhen an orc courier for &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; sent by &lt;a href=\"Eitrigg\"&gt;Eitrigg&lt;/a&gt; arrived at the Maelstrom the members of the Earthen Ring learned &lt;a href=\"Northwatch%20Hold\"&gt;Northwatch Hold&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt; have fallen to the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Nobundo also learned that in the battle against Northwatch Molten Giants were enslaved and used in the attack and that a mana bomb was used to destroy Theramore both done on &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Warchief Hellscream's&lt;/a&gt; orders. Nobundo then informed Thrall that the Earthen Ring would understand if he were to leave and that they would continue to heal the land. When Thrall told him that nothing was greater than healing the world, Nobundo understood how much the admission costs the former Warchief. \nLater on, Thrall informed Nobundo and the others that he had received a vision of water elementals being enslaved and used to destroy Orgrimmar. Upon learning that the culprit would be at &lt;a href=\"Fray%20Island\"&gt;Fray Island&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Muln%20Earthfury\"&gt;Muln Earthfury&lt;/a&gt; suggested that everyone help out. However, Nobundo disagreed, reasoning that since only Thrall received the vision, only Thrall should go.\nLandfall.\nNobundo represented the draenei of the Alliance in the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Seven%20Stars\"&gt;Shrine of Seven Stars&lt;/a&gt; summit, where the Alliance dignitaries and allies discuss the pros and cons of using &lt;a href=\"Sha\"&gt;Sha&lt;/a&gt; power. He agreed with &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;'s proposal in destroying the Sha.\nLegion.\nNobundo is one of the few surviving members of the Earthen Ring following the catastrophic battle at the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the demons attacked the &lt;a href=\"Maelstrom\"&gt;Maelstrom&lt;/a&gt; he helps to fight them off, and after the retrieval of an &lt;a href=\"artifact\"&gt;artifact&lt;/a&gt; of great power he moves in to the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Azeroth%20%28Class%20Hall%29\"&gt;Heart of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, an ancient cave located at the Maelstrom. When the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; attacked the \"Exodar\", Nobundo alongside his fellow shaman - &lt;a href=\"Fister%20Rockfist\"&gt;Fister Rockfist&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Liani%20the%20Lifegiver\"&gt;Liani the Lifegiver&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Da%27kesh%20the%20Elementalist\"&gt;Da'kesh the Elementalist&lt;/a&gt; - helped to evacuate the civilians from the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Hall\"&gt;Crystal Hall&lt;/a&gt; but were cornered into a shaft. He was prepared to make his final stand but with the arrival of the champions from the Class Orders, he successfully defended himself.\nA ritual was conducted to call upon the Elemental Lord of Water: &lt;a href=\"Neptulon\"&gt;Neptulon&lt;/a&gt;. The Tide Hunter already knows the threat and comments to have what the time is given. Nobundo says to him that all hope is not lost. He remarks that if the Elemental Lords unite alongside the Earthen Ring, there's a chance of intercepting the Burning Legion attacks across Azeroth.\nIn Skywall, Nobundo helps to revive &lt;a href=\"Thunderaan\"&gt;Thunderaan&lt;/a&gt; and make him the new &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Lord\"&gt;Elemental Lord&lt;/a&gt; of Air. Walking in the domain, he ponders if there is a place that exists beyond Azeroth.\n&lt;a href=\"Therazane\"&gt;Therazane&lt;/a&gt; is battling the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; again and Nobundo is obliged to help take care of this renewed conflict in order to recruit the Elemental Lord of Earth. After the situation is resolved, The Stonemother was pleased and will return the favor and always pays her debts to the Earthen Ring. Nobundo is deeply grateful on that remark.\nThough Nobundo didn't venture into the &lt;a href=\"Firelands\"&gt;Firelands&lt;/a&gt; to see the new elemental to take up the mantle of the &lt;a href=\"Smolderon\"&gt;Elemental Lord of Fire&lt;/a&gt;, he awaited &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;the Farseer&lt;/a&gt; back at the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Azeroth%20%28Class%20Hall%29\"&gt;Heart of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. He announces that we gather together to commemorate a newly forged alliance; a fulfillment of prophecy.\nLegionfall.\nNobundo was one of the order hall champions who met &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Krasus%27%20Landing\"&gt;Krasus' Landing&lt;/a&gt; to discuss the &lt;a href=\"Pillars%20of%20Creation\"&gt;Pillars of Creation&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Magatha%20Grimtotem\"&gt;Magatha Grimtotem&lt;/a&gt; came to the &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt; for help against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;Farseer&lt;/a&gt; chose to bring the &lt;a href=\"Doomstone\"&gt;Doomstone&lt;/a&gt; to Nobundo for safekeeping, deciding it would be unwise for it to be in the Elder Crone's control. He also convinced an angered &lt;a href=\"Muln%20Earthfury\"&gt;Muln Earthfury&lt;/a&gt; that it was best to keep Magatha under close watch in the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Azeroth%20%28Class%20Hall%29\"&gt;Heart of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth and aftermath.\nNobundo was in the Maelstrom when a grievous wound, caused &lt;a href=\"Azerite%20elemental\"&gt;Azerite elemental&lt;/a&gt;s to come forth in order to claim the newly formed &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt;. Despite the onslaught, &lt;a href=\"Nobundo\"&gt;Nobundo&lt;/a&gt; was able to secure the Doomstone, and reported as such to the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Farseer&lt;/a&gt;.

He gave Zekhan a letter that detailed Nobundo's history with shamanism, and he also told them about the elementals on the Isles, including &lt;a href=\"Hauter\"&gt;Hauter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Temper\"&gt;Temper&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuotes.\nThe Exodar.\nGreetings, &lt;race&gt;.\nMy story? It is kind of you to ask. Very well.\nLong ago on the planet Draenor - the remains of which are now known as the Outland - all of the draenei lived in peace.\nBut then the Burning Legion came, and they corrupted the orcs with their fel magics.\nWith no other option we fought to survive, but exposure to these fel energies had horrible effects upon some of us, over time transforming us into the Broken like me, or worse, the seemingly mindless Lost Ones.\nShall I go on?\nThe fel energies also had the side-effect on the Broken and the Lost Ones of cutting us off from the Light.\nAt the time I did not know exactly why, but as a vindicator I insisted on finding out. I decided to make a pilgrimage to do just that.\nAnd so it was that after the war came to its fateful end, I journeyed into the desert of the fragmented planet, beseeching the Light to return to us.\nBut decades passed, and the Light never answered my prayers.\nIs this something that you wish to hear more of?\nI had been fortunate to find an oasis and made the decision to stay there until I received an answer.\nSo there I sat, moving only when absolutely necessary, living off of the creatures that would come near the pool. Such was my pride.\nAs I said, decades passed without an answer. But I can remember a particularly beautiful sunset one evening.\nA warm zephyr blew across the land and I was sure that I heard a voice, but no one was around.\nAs you can imagine, I thought that I was finally losing my mind.\nThere was something strange about that wind; it didn't stop.\nFor weeks it blew across the land, waxing and waning, but never ceasing.\nAnd all the time the voice continued, though I could not understand it, nor did I know where it was coming from.\nMy time in solitude had taught me how to calm myself and look inward. This I did in order to keep my sanity.\nAnd that is when I began to understand the voice. It was coming from the wind itself and it had much to say!\nIt spoke to me of secrets and power, and also of truths.\nThe Light had not forsaken the Broken! The fel energies that the orcs had wielded long ago against the draenei had infused us, causing a break in our ability to be heard by, or perhaps to hear, the Light.\nThe same that had been responsible for the degradation of our bodies.\nBut our spirits were not broken, and the air offered to me another path, through which I might deliver my people.\nIt taught me the path of shamanism, which in a way is just another facet of the Light.\nJoining the wind was the water of the oasis, the fire from my camp and the earth upon which I sat. All had something to say.\nOver the next few years they taught me what it was to call upon and be one with the elements of the world.\nAnd they told me that the worlds of all of the stars in the sky, even this one, are made up of these elements.\nBut the day came when I felt that I had learned enough to leave.\nI returned to my people and was greeted with smiling faces and outstretched arms, mostly from the Broken.\nThe prejudices against us from many draenei had continued in my absence.\nBut it was as if they knew that I was coming, and I soon found out why.\nVelen, the prophet and leader of all of the draenei, had seen my return in one of his visions and was there to greet me as well.\nHe asked to speak with me in private and as I related my story to him, he nodded and smiled, for this too he had foreseen.\nVelen urged me to take a leadership role amongst the Broken.\nBut more importantly, he asked me to teach shamanism to all; Broken and draenei alike. I accepted.\nWe knew then that given the prejudices of some that this would be a difficult proposition at best.\nThere are those that despise the Broken because we are a frightening reminder of the past.\nAnd there are others who believe the way of the shaman to be a &lt;a href=\"Blasphemy\"&gt;blasphemy&lt;/a&gt; against the Light.\nIn any case, that is my tale.\nLegion.\nGossip.\nThere is great power in the Heart of Azeroth. There may be no closer place to all of the elements on Azeroth, than where we now stand.\nSkywall is truly a wondrous place, &lt;name&gt;. I have seen nothing like it in all my life.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nNever have I felt the world to be in so much turmoil. I can only imagine what Magni, who feels everything that Azeroth feels, is going through.\nI hope that these efforts are not too late."}

The Farstriders are based in &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt;, but they have several camps and lodges scattered all across Quel'Thalas. They are considered part of the blood elf government.\nIntimately bound to the wildlands, and with a deep respect for the law, the rangers that compose the Farstriders' ranks remain noble, traditional, and valiant protectors of blood elf society.\nHistory.\nFormation.\nThe Farstriders were initially comprised of little more than a group of &lt;a href=\"high%20elven\"&gt;high elven&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Elven%20ranger\"&gt;ranger&lt;/a&gt;s, who loosely fought together during the &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Wars\"&gt;Troll Wars&lt;/a&gt; to keep &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; safe. Of them, &lt;a href=\"Talanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Talanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; was the greatest.\nRoughly 500 years ago, a group of similarly dedicated fighters formed and officially took on the name \"Farstriders.\" Their mandate was, originally, to protect Quel'Thalas far beyond its actual borders and look after high elf interests all over &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, and while the Farstriders still see their mission as a broad one, this ambitious goal narrowed over time; today, the Farstriders rarely range beyond Quel'Thalas. The commander of the Farstriders was given a unique, historic title: &lt;a href=\"Ranger-General%20of%20Silvermoon\"&gt;Ranger-General of Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nInheritor to the title of ranger-general, &lt;a href=\"Lireesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Lireesa Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, summoned the kingdom's most elite Farstriders to her spire on the day her eldest daughter, &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, was to begin formal training as her own successor. Among those gathered were &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;, Lireesa's deputy and future regent lord, and &lt;a href=\"Halduron%20Brightwing\"&gt;Halduron Brightwing&lt;/a&gt;, a future ranger-general. The youngest Windrunners, &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas\"&gt;Sylvanas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vereesa\"&gt;Vereesa&lt;/a&gt;, watched the proceedings from the spire. Alleria named her prey and entered the wilderness of Eversong to claim the kill that would mark her worthiness; but Sylvanas, after conferring with her &lt;a href=\"Verath%20Windrunner\"&gt;father&lt;/a&gt; and the Farstriders, grew concerned for her sister and struck out to ensure her safety. The ranger-general's trial had gone awry: Alleria's prey got the better of her, and Sylvanas slew the beast to save her life. Lireesa raged at the outcome - Alleria had been shamed before the Farstriders she was born to lead, and robbed of the chance of redemption - but Alleria did not plan to succeed her mother. The ranger-general believed all that mattered lay in Quel'Thalas, that they were protectors of the people and leading the Farstriders must be a ranger-general's primary concern; Alleria wished to experience the world and form bonds with peoples beyond her cloistered kingdom, and resented the traditions that dictated she inherit a title she did not desire. \nThe Farstriders suffered for Lireesa and Alleria's feuding. A splintering occurred between those loyal to the ranger-general and those who shared Alleria's beliefs. Eventually, Alleria abdicated entirely, and made known her intention to leave Quel'Thalas with her ranger company. She convinced her furious mother to elevate Sylvanas in her place, as the younger Windrunner was well respected among the Farstriders, had the strong support of Theron and Brightwing, and had surpassed her as a ranger. Publicly, Lireesa framed the upheaval in as dignified a manner she could: the ranger-general declared that it was time for the Farstriders to reclaim the meaning of their name, and once again look to the world beyond their borders. Alleria and her rangers would depart to fulfill this charge, while Sylvanas would become ranger-general and lead the Farstriders in her stead.\nThe young &lt;a href=\"Vereesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Vereesa Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; was inducted into the entry ranks of the Farstriders some time before the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, rising to become among the best of her training group. More than one of her tutors scolded her for her reckless attitude and fighting style, derogatorily comparing her impatience to that of a &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;'s.\nAt some point, Lor'themar served as a &lt;a href=\"lieutenant\"&gt;lieutenant&lt;/a&gt;, and during a patrol his three-men group was captured by &lt;a href=\"Zul%27jin\"&gt;Zul'jin&lt;/a&gt; who killed the two rangers and briefly tortured Lor'themar. Several archers had also accompanied &lt;a href=\"Magister\"&gt;Magister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dar%27Khan%20Drathir\"&gt;Dar'Khan Drathir&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Priest\"&gt;Priest&lt;/a&gt;ess &lt;a href=\"Liadrin\"&gt;Liadrin&lt;/a&gt;, and apprentice &lt;a href=\"Galell\"&gt;Galell&lt;/a&gt; to investigate a malfunctioning &lt;a href=\"Runestone\"&gt;Runestone&lt;/a&gt;, but they were ambushed by forest trolls as well. The archers were killed and the others were taken prisoner.\nSecond War.\nPrior Quel'Thalas' participation in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, Ranger General Lireesa and her husband were slain while on king's business in &lt;a href=\"Eastweald\"&gt;Eastweald&lt;/a&gt;. The Farstriders established there, supported by rangers from Silvermoon, concluded she'd been ambushed and killed by &lt;a href=\"Amani\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt; trolls, the Farstriders' long nemeses. Sylvanas, reluctantly empowered by King &lt;a href=\"Anasterian%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Anasterian Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; to more thoroughly investigate the deaths, revealed evidence of &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;orcish&lt;/a&gt; involvement - a threat Lireesa had not believed in. When Sylvanas confronted Anasterian with this knowledge, the king destroyed the evidence and forbade the Farstriders from acting in reprisal. Demanding loyalty from his incumbent ranger-general, the king swore Sylvanas to silence on the matter - the high elves would not involve themselves in a war that was not their own, nor would the Farstriders increase their patrols as though something were amiss.\nWith their leader fallen, the Farstriders gathered at &lt;a href=\"Farstrider%20Retreat\"&gt;Farstrider Retreat&lt;/a&gt; to elect the new ranger-general. As Lireesa's second and the highest-ranked ranger behind Sylvanas herself, Lor'themar Theron led the Farstriders in a eulogy to the fallen, a retelling of &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Seven%20Arrows\"&gt;the battle that won her fame&lt;/a&gt;, and moved to swear Sylvanas in as her successor. Many were willing to call Sylvanas their new ranger-general, but some were more hesitant, or beholden to personal grudges. &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Helios\"&gt;Helios&lt;/a&gt; still believed Alleria should bear the title, and would not commit to a vote until her return. A quarrel broke out - Helios held to the tradition of the eldest Windrunner leading the Farstriders; Lor'themar reminded those present that Alleria had disinherited herself and chosen the world beyond over Quel'Thalas, while Sylvanas was entirely dedicated to the Farstriders - but Sylvanas' critics were not swayed until Alleria herself arrived to second Theron's words. Lireesa's eldest shamed the dissidents for not believing in their ranger-general's judgment, and gave Sylvanas her full support. Sylvanas was sworn in unanimously.\nFollowing Sylvanas's ascension to ranger-general of the Farstriders, she inducted an unlikely apprentice into the Farstriders' ranks - the human ranger, &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Marris\"&gt;Nathanos Marris&lt;/a&gt;. Sylvanas took what was considered an inordinate amount of pride in her talented human disciple, as noted by several of her comrades, and a number of the other Farstriders did not take kindly to the presence of a human in their ranks. &lt;a href=\"Halduron%20Brightwing\"&gt;Halduron Brightwing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Renthar%20Hawkspear\"&gt;Renthar Hawkspear&lt;/a&gt; both argued against his inclusion in their ranks, while Quel'Thalas' scion &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Prince Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; himself demanded Sylvanas dismiss him from the ranger corps, though Sylvanas persisted in his training. Regardless, Nathanos proved himself a valuable ally and was the first and last human to achieve the rank of Ranger Lord and be trained with the Farstriders.\nAs the forces of the Amani and the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt; encroached upon northern &lt;a href=\"Eversong\"&gt;Eversong&lt;/a&gt;, the Farstriders sortied to push back the invaders. Notable Farstrider commanders such as Sylvanas' second-in-command, &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;, the ranger-captain &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, and their comrade &lt;a href=\"Halduron%20Brightwing\"&gt;Halduron Brightwing&lt;/a&gt; were part of the conflict, and the Farstriders were instrumental in holding off the Amani until the Horde's subdued &lt;a href=\"red%20dragon\"&gt;red dragon&lt;/a&gt; allies began to lay waste to the forests. \nWhile Sylvanas remained behind to help secure Quel'Thalas, it was Halduron and his platoon of rangers, assisted by some of Silvermoon's priests and priestesses, who defeated and apprehended the troll chieftain, Zul'jin, amidst the burning woodlands. The rangers, many of whom had lost loved ones in their many conflicts with the trolls, tortured the leader of their ancient enemy extensively. Halduron had hoped to keep Zul'jin alive long enough to be brought back to Silvermoon, but an Amani war party was able to cause a damaging enough diversion for their leader to escape the elves' grasp. When the Farstriders and the Alliance forces had succeeded in driving off the invaders, Alleria and Lor'themar led their rangers to &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; to relieve the human capital. \nSome time after the conflict was over, Anasterian, who had only reluctantly committed to the war in the first place, cited poor leadership on the humans' end that led to unnecessary violence in the elven homeland as an excuse to withdraw his kingdom from the Alliance. Thus, the nation of Quel'Thalas and the Farstriders went back into their isolation from the wider world. The Farstriders saw little action during this time; the odd Amani war-party aside, Quel'Thalas enjoyed a peaceful end to the Second War.\nThird War.\nThe Farstriders were the high elves' first line of defense during the &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20invasion%20of%20Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Scourge invasion of Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;. They were the first to learn of the fall of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, wrought on by the twisted &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Arthas\"&gt;Prince Arthas&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; hordes. Farstrider scouts informed Ranger-General Sylvanas of the approaching death knight, and Sylvanas led a raid of rangers herself to meet him. After mocking the Ranger-General's attempts to convince him to turn back, Arthas strode on towards the elfgates, and the Farstriders dispersed to put a stop to him before the Scourge's unholy trail of destruction could spread further into the elven kingdom.\nFirstly, the Farstriders rained a hail of arrows down upon the invaders, while a contingent drew their blades and targeted the mortal members of the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Cult of the Damned&lt;/a&gt;. Against the Farstriders' superior abilities, the living members of the cult proved little match, though their corpses were swiftly reanimated and any elves that fell followed suit. Before long, Ranger-General Sylvanas gave the order to retreat, the undead &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; fast approaching the elfgates and cutting its way through the rangers. Sylvanas came to realize that they could not win this battle but held out hope that the &lt;a href=\"Magisters\"&gt;Magisters&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt; could still turn the battle around, if they knew what was coming. Farstrider scouts were sent north to inform them, but Arthas had them swiftly murdered at every turn.\nThe Ranger-General made numerous efforts to halt the Scourge advance, including destroying the main passage leading to &lt;a href=\"Elrendar\"&gt;Elrendar&lt;/a&gt; and keeping the Key of Three Moons out of Arthas' grasp. However, these attempts proved mostly futile: Arthas supplemented the destroyed bridge with his shambling, mindless servants, and a traitor named &lt;a href=\"Dar%27Khan%20Drathir\"&gt;Dar'Khan Drathir&lt;/a&gt; ensured that Arthas knew exactly where to find his much-coveted key.\nThe Farstriders launched a large-scale &lt;a href=\"dragonhawk\"&gt;dragonhawk&lt;/a&gt; attack on the invaders. After some initial successes, their valiant beasts were largely fought off by the Scourge's stone &lt;a href=\"gargoyle\"&gt;gargoyles&lt;/a&gt;.\nSylvanas herself fell before &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt; after single combat with the scion of Lordaeron, and the Farstriders fought a desperate battle for survival without her leadership. In an act of surpassing cruelty, Arthas raised Sylvanas and many of her fallen Farstriders from the grave, and forced them to battle their homeland in his name. Sylvanas, a spectral banshee rather than an undead corpse, was sent into Silvermoon to massacre the innocent with her horrifying new powers. Ranger Lord &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; and his rangers were patrolling near &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt; around the time of the invasion, and rushed to check on the hidden &lt;a href=\"mooncrystal\"&gt;mooncrystals&lt;/a&gt; after catching signs of an invasion. They joined with &lt;a href=\"Halduron%20Brightwing\"&gt;Halduron Brightwing&lt;/a&gt;'s ranger company and rushed north to Silvermoon, and the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;.\nTheir efforts thwarted, the Farstriders were pushed back to the capital, and &lt;a href=\"Belo%27vir%20Salonar\"&gt;Belo'vir Salonar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister\"&gt;Grand Magister&lt;/a&gt; of Quel'Thalas, took over the defense of the city in Sylvanas's place.\nPost-invasion.\nWhen the battle was over, Ranger Lord Lor'themar Theron became the acting high elven leader, and the Farstriders were instrumental in keeping the survivors of the Scourge onslaught safe. Upon their arrival at Silvermoon, Lor'themar and the remaining Farstriders had gathered together all the survivors they could find. They established a defensible position within Silvermoon and fought back the wandering dead that maintained a vigil in the area. The next day, the Farstriders struck out and made sweeping perimeter searches of Eversong, seeking out survivors they had missed or those trying to reach the city, and leading them to safety.\nAfter learning of the devastation of Quel'Thalas, Prince &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; returned to his homeland. He renamed the survivors \"&lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;\" in honor of their fallen brethren, and commanded Lor'themar to safeguard the elven homeland from the Scourge remnants, while he took 15% of the blood elven people to join the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20resistance\"&gt;Alliance resistance&lt;/a&gt;. With Sylvanas' demise, a void was left, and the Farstriders elected Halduron Brightwing as their new ranger-general, as he was both a talented leader and a skilled ranger.\nOnce she'd reclaimed her body from &lt;a href=\"Deatholme\"&gt;Deatholme&lt;/a&gt;, Sylvanas, now a free-willed undead, sought out the Farstriders as her first choice of ally. She was certain her old friends and comrades Lor'themar and Halduron, with whom she'd formed the Trio, would see past the horrors she'd been forced to commit and perhaps even allow her to rejoin and lead their unit of rangers.\nSuch hopes turned to ash as she spied their patrol near &lt;a href=\"Farstrider%20Retreat\"&gt;Farstrider Retreat&lt;/a&gt;. As she prepared to unveil herself, the two comrades' grim conversation turned to Sylvanas' downfall, and the death she'd visited upon their people. Her old friends concluded that nothing of the Sylvanas they'd loved now remained, and hoped only that their friend's spirit would find its well-earned rest. Shaken by their words, and knowing they would look upon her visage and see only a butcher who'd slaughtered the innocents of their kingdom, Sylvanas departed Quel'Thalas with a heart turned even colder. The allies she needed would not be found in Quel'Thalas \u2013 at least not yet.\nThe Ghostlands.\n&lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Halduron%20Brightwing\"&gt;Halduron Brightwing&lt;/a&gt; led the Farstriders in doing battle with the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; all over Quel'Thalas, with varying success. They noted that the Scourge numbers were increasing and soon learned that the resurgence of the great traitor &lt;a href=\"Dar%27Khan%20Drathir\"&gt;Dar'Khan Drathir&lt;/a&gt; himself was the cause. The hunters picked up his track and launched an ambush on him; however, they were met with a raid of high elven skeletons blocking their path, and the traitor eluded justice. Lor'themar, Halduron, and their rangers later captured and interrogated &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; and his companions, but joined forces with the blue dragon's party upon discerning their good intentions. The rangers aided Kalecgos in battling Dar'Khan on &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt;.\nReclaiming Quel'Thalas.\nThe blood elves had made little progress with reclaiming the kingdom, the Scourge still inhabiting it in strong numbers. Nevertheless, the Farstriders continued their battle against the undead, and were eventually relieved by &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Rommath\"&gt;Grand Magister Rommath&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"magisters\"&gt;magisters&lt;/a&gt;, who quickly went about using the radical new teachings advocated by &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; (ostensibly &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas\"&gt;Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt;) to expel the invaders and reclaim much of Quel'Thalas with stunning efficiency. &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt; itself was rebuilt \"almost overnight,\" and the blood elves' fortune was beginning to look far better.\nHowever, the teachings Rommath brought back to Quel'Thalas caused some friction within the Farstriders: &lt;a href=\"Renthar%20Hawkspear\"&gt;Renthar Hawkspear&lt;/a&gt; and his rangers openly opposed them, an act that led the newly-named Regent Lord of Quel'Thalas &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; to banish them &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands\"&gt;south&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuel'Thalas also looked to finding allies around this time, and the Farstriders were initially of a dubious mind regarding their alliance with the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. They also opposed the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knight\"&gt;Blood Knight order&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Farstriders were perhaps the most unaffected by the pangs of magic addiction and withdrawal and felt a much lesser hunger for the arcane than some of their brethren. The cause of this was unknown.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;Invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt;, the Farstriders did not usually range far from home, instead, they fought to reclaim and control the southern section of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, which has been heavily afflicted by the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;Plague of Undeath&lt;/a&gt;, and the southernmost areas that had fallen under the control of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. The Farstriders were also fighting to hold onto &lt;a href=\"Eversong%20Woods\"&gt;Eversong Woods&lt;/a&gt;, which was being threatened by the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20Empire\"&gt;Amani trolls&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Farstriders held the &lt;a href=\"Ghostlands\"&gt;Ghostlands&lt;/a&gt; via their numerous holdings throughout &lt;a href=\"Eversong%20Woods\"&gt;Eversong Woods&lt;/a&gt; with the unlikely assistance of the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;; primarily concerned with dealing with the Amani &lt;a href=\"Forest%20troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s still holding out within Quel'Thalas from the &lt;a href=\"Farstrider%20Retreat\"&gt;Farstrider Retreat&lt;/a&gt;. They would also take the fight into the &lt;a href=\"Ghostlands\"&gt;Ghostlands&lt;/a&gt;, from their main base in the &lt;a href=\"Farstrider%20Enclave\"&gt;Farstrider Enclave&lt;/a&gt;. Halduron and a Farstrider platoon joined with the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knights\"&gt;Blood Knights&lt;/a&gt; in dealing with &lt;a href=\"Dar%27Khan%20Drathir\"&gt;Dar'Khan Drathir&lt;/a&gt;'s first reappearance in the &lt;a href=\"Ghostlands\"&gt;Ghostlands&lt;/a&gt;. Although Farstriders and &lt;a href=\"Magisters\"&gt;Magisters&lt;/a&gt; rarely see eye-to-eye, they had a very common goal when it came to seeing the great traitor Dar'Khan Drathir, now an undead servant of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, dead.\nPost Quel'Danas.\nAfter the dramatic events surrounding the treacherous &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Prince Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt; has been restored to its people. Around this time, a number of the &lt;a href=\"Sunfury\"&gt;Sunfury&lt;/a&gt; forces returned home to serve their people, and the Farstriders have been less stretched with protecting Quel'Thalas' borders as a result.\nCataclysm.\nThe Farstriders and &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear tribe&lt;/a&gt; formed an alliance against the new &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; empire brewing in &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt;, and a regiment of &lt;a href=\"Farstrider%20Troll-Hunter\"&gt;Farstrider Troll hunters&lt;/a&gt; could be found on its outskirts. With most of the Farstriders away on duty, Halduron called upon support from an unlikely source -- &lt;a href=\"Vereesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Vereesa Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; and her own rangers, who traveled to Quel'Thalas to assist their homeland against the Amani threat.\nMists of Pandaria.\nA Farstrider regiment was deployed to &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; roughly two months after the continent's discovery. Accompanying &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;, the Farstriders (as well as &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knight\"&gt;Blood Knight&lt;/a&gt; divisions) served as bodyguards for the Regent Lord, and as a protective measure for the &lt;a href=\"Reliquary\"&gt;Reliquary&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Ranger%20Orestes\"&gt;Ranger Orestes&lt;/a&gt; was tasked with tracking down and capturing a &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; warlord alongside Blood Knight &lt;a href=\"Aenea\"&gt;Aenea&lt;/a&gt;, and Farstriders were seen subduing the captured mogu with chains after the deed was done.\nFollowing &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Rommath\"&gt;Grand Magister Rommath&lt;/a&gt;'s assault on &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; to rescue the &lt;a href=\"Sunreavers\"&gt;Sunreavers&lt;/a&gt;, Lor'themar ordered &lt;a href=\"Halduron%20Brightwing\"&gt;Halduron Brightwing&lt;/a&gt; to assemble the Farstriders, noting that the time had finally come for the sin'dorei to take their future into their own hands. Halduron and his Farstrider rangers then assisted Lor'themar and the &lt;a href=\"Sunreaver%20Onslaught\"&gt;Sunreaver Onslaught&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; forces.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20in%20Draenor\"&gt;war in Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Sunsworn\"&gt;Sunsworn&lt;/a&gt; contained a number of rangers, assisting the Blood Knight-heavy force in their battles across &lt;a href=\"Talador\"&gt;Talador&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, Halduron led the Farstriders to &lt;a href=\"Trueshot%20Lodge\"&gt;Trueshot Lodge&lt;/a&gt;; many named Farstriders, some familiar, could be found in and around the camp. The Farstriders were responsible for uncovering the whereabouts of their old comrade &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, after torturing a demon into giving up information on &lt;a href=\"Niskara\"&gt;Niskara&lt;/a&gt;, a Legion world inhabited by the &lt;a href=\"Inquisitor\"&gt;Inquisitor&lt;/a&gt; demons. Joining forces with &lt;a href=\"Vereesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Vereesa Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, they returned to the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt; to plan a rescue. &lt;a href=\"Ranger%20Orestes\"&gt;Ranger Orestes&lt;/a&gt; lost his life in the attempt.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Unseen%20Path\"&gt;Unseen Path&lt;/a&gt;'s new leader was inaugurated, Halduron vowed that the Farstriders would fight at their side.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, several Farstriders accompanied Lor'themar Theron on the regent lord's excursion into &lt;a href=\"Nazjatar\"&gt;Nazjatar&lt;/a&gt;, and were commanded by &lt;a href=\"Ranger%20Captain%20Natacha\"&gt;Ranger Captain Natacha&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; was deposed as &lt;a href=\"warchief\"&gt;warchief&lt;/a&gt; of the Horde, Lor'themar dispatched Farstriders to hunt down Sylvanas and her right hand, former ranger lord Nathanos Blightcaller, both of whom had disappeared in the battle's aftermath.\nOrganization.\nThe Farstriders is a small but highly skilled group of rangers. The organization can trace its roots back to the Troll Wars when a loosely affiliated band of high elf warriors occasionally worked together to defend Quel'Thalas.\nOver time the Farstriders' focus has evolved. Today the Farstriders do not usually range far from home. Instead, they are trying to reclaim the southern section of Quel'Thalas, which has been heavily afflicted by the plague: the southernmost areas have fallen into Scourge possession. The Farstriders are also fighting to hold onto Eversong Woods, which is being threatened by the Amani trolls of Zul'Aman, to the east of Quel'Thalas.\nAlthough Halduron Brightwing is the blood elves' military commander, the Farstriders as an organization have never been a formal military, and are considered separate from Silvermoon's standing army. However, this is contradicted during a conversation between Halduron Brightwing and an envoy sent by Lor'themar Theron, during Patch 4.1 of the Cataclysm expansion, where Halduron Brightwing argues the point that as the official military commander of Quel'Thalas, he has the right to call upon the aid of whoever he wishes (in reference to him seeking the aid of Vereesa Windrunner.)\nRanks.\nThe Farstriders have a ranking system by title, and it appears to possess a fairly straightforward command hierarchy.\nPromotion to Ranger Lord, or \"Alar'annalas\", is often done in a formal public ceremony. The ranger-general drapes the new ranger lord in a \"Fora'nal\" cloth, symbolizing their progression and imparts encouraging words. The head of state may even pay their respects.\nUnsurprisingly, the Farstriders tend to use mostly &lt;a href=\"blood%20elven\"&gt;blood elven&lt;/a&gt; crafted designs for their outfits, and usually wield bows, crossbows, swords, or polearms. Unlike the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knights\"&gt;Blood Knights&lt;/a&gt;, they do not usually display any particular preference for their color code, and are typically seen in varying attire. Halduron himself sports a mostly blue outfit; however, standard Farstrider attire is often green.\nIn the same way player blood elf &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s were considered part of the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knight\"&gt;Blood Knight&lt;/a&gt;s through their class quests, player blood elf &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s were considered part of the Farstriders, but received comparatively few quests to emphasize this affiliation.\nBeliefs and practices.\nThe Farstriders have long been considered valiant and honorable elves who regarded the law with deep respect and faith. Indeed, they have long been considered the epitome of selfless dedication.\nSince the Scourge's bloody rampage through Quel'Thalas, the Farstriders have lost some of their optimism. Even so, they are nobly maintaining their role as protectors of blood elf society. Perhaps due to their ties to the land, these rangers tend to be spiritually, mentally, and physically healthier than many other blood elves.\nThey see their mission as a broad one: to seek out and eradicate evil. Their primary focus is on Quel'Thalas itself, but they also occasionally venture abroad, carrying out surgical strikes where they feel their efforts will have the greatest effect.\nWhile many of their brethren focus on magical supremacy and the wonders of the arcane, the Farstriders retain some of their forebears' connection to nature, feeling at home in the forests and finding allies in the wilderness - while Silvermoon has many political divisions, in nature the Farstriders find allies that do not know deceit. Intimately bound to the wildlands, the Farstriders are experts at their craft and know the forests of Quel'Thalas like no others, outclassing even their ancient enemy the Amani in terms of woodsmanship and stealth.\nThe Farstriders' salute is a fisted hand to the heart. When a Farstrider vows to kill an enemy, they name the target their prey. Farstriders are trained to communicate silently via hand signals: arm extended \u2013 get to ground; palm up \u2013 hold position; hand on heart \u2013 prepare to fire; lower right hand, fingers splayed \u2013 stand down, do not fire. \nSylvanas Windrunner believed the Farstriders protect Quel'Thalas from the true face of Azeroth \u2013 the rangers expose themselves to horror so their people's aesthetes, and others with gentler hearts, can flourish in its absence. Service in the Farstriders comes with prestige \u2013 exceptional athleticism, agility, and marksmanship skills can elevate even a commoner to a certain kind of nobility.\nThe Farstriders are not opposed to torture, sometimes practicing it with a brutality that unsettles fellow elves. They famously employed it on Zul'jin, beating him ruthlessly and gouging out his eye to take vengeance for the lives his campaigns had claimed, and have also made use of it on captured demons for the purpose of interrogation.\nRelations.\nThough initially icy in relation to their prospective alliance with the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, the Farstriders seem capable of putting racial prejudice aside when needed -- gladly working with the Darkspear tribe -- and Halduron Brightwing himself seems highly respectful to his Horde allies; the ranger-general is noted as displaying few of the haughty prejudices the elves are known for.\nTheir feud with the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knight\"&gt;Blood Knight&lt;/a&gt;s is well known. Due to the knights' &lt;a href=\"M%27uru\"&gt;method&lt;/a&gt; of wielding the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;, the Farstriders looked down upon the Blood Knights, considering them to be immoral, and hoped they would see the light. In turn, the Blood Knights considered the Farstriders afraid of grasping true power.\nThe Farstriders also seem at odds with several of the &lt;a href=\"Magisters\"&gt;Magisters&lt;/a&gt;. This is perhaps fuelled by the various allusions given to &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Rommath\"&gt;Grand Magister Rommath&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Halduron%20Brightwing\"&gt;Halduron Brightwing&lt;/a&gt; not seeing eye-to-eye on many matters.\nThe comments of &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City%20Guardian\"&gt;Silvermoon City Guardian&lt;/a&gt;s indicate their cold feelings towards the Farstriders.\nThe &lt;a href=\"dark%20ranger\"&gt;dark ranger&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; were once &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elven&lt;/a&gt; Farstriders, who fell during the Scourge invasion of Quel'Thalas. After &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; regained her body, she raised Dark Ranger Velonara. She did so probably with the others as well.\nMembers.\nOther Farstriders.\nThough the term 'Farstrider' refers to the blood elven organization, remnants of the original ranger corps that did not become sin'dorei can be found outside of Quel'Thalas. &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Lithien%20Lodge\"&gt;Quel'Lithien Lodge&lt;/a&gt; was where the banished rangers under &lt;a href=\"Renthar%20Hawkspear\"&gt;Renthar Hawkspear&lt;/a&gt; took up residence, though they were later turned into &lt;a href=\"Wretched\"&gt;Wretched&lt;/a&gt;. The high elf &lt;a href=\"Vyrin%20Swiftwind\"&gt;Vyrin Swiftwind&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"Farstrider%20Lodge\"&gt;Farstrider Lodge&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Loch%20Modan\"&gt;Loch Modan&lt;/a&gt;, was also referred as a Farstrider.\nIn the RPG.\nOrganization.\nAlthough every Farstrider is a ranger, a rare few do take on roguish pursuits. The organization can trace its roots back to the &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Wars\"&gt;Troll Wars&lt;/a&gt;, when a loosely affiliated band of high elf warriors occasionally worked together to defend Quel'Thalas. Roughly five hundred years ago, a group of similarly dedicated fighters formed and officially took on the name \"Farstriders\". Their mandate was to protect Quel'Thalas far beyond its actual borders and look after high elf interests all over &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. The commander of the Farstriders was given a unique title: &lt;a href=\"Ranger-General%20of%20Silvermoon\"&gt;Ranger-General of Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;.\nOver time the Farstriders' focus has evolved. Once, Farstriders traveled far and wide. These days, most stay within Quel'Thalas's borders, maintaining the peace and fighting off the Scourge and Zul'Aman. While the occasional band ventures into the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Eastern Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt;, they don't go far from home anymore.\nMilitary tactics.\nFarstriders use similar tactics to other elven regiments, preferring bows. A good Farstrider is never seen in battle. The blood elf rangers prefer to hide among camouflage and in trees, sniping with their longbows.\nFarstriders are independent of Silvermoon's military forces. Rather, Farstriders are structured more like a mercenary group. While individual Farstriders bear military designations, the bands are independent. Most Farstrider bands include from 3 to 5 members and answer only to the ranger-general.\nFarstriders prefer guerilla tactics to frontal assaults. They always attack from cover, using trees and rocks to cover their traces while sniping at enemies. A Farstrider band splits up just before the attack, surrounding the enemy forces. Once in position, the lead ranger gives a birdcall to ready the others. Then all rangers bombard their enemies with arrows. They hamper fleeing targets with spells such as entangle. When discovered, a ranger retreats to a more strategic location and renews his assault. The Farstriders hunt and exterminate any enemies that escape the spells and arrows. Farstriders are quick, expert and ruthless.\nMembership.\nFarstriders are all blood elves. Furthermore, everyone is a ranger of some sort. While the rare Farstrider may focus on roguish pursuits, the faction is entirely combat-related, and even their rogues are deadly with a bow. Or without, for that matter. Joining the Farstriders is no mean task. You must go through an extensive trial period, testing your archery skills as well as your survival and stealth skills. No Farstrider is truly a greenhorn, though. To become a Farstrider, a character must have excellent stealth and survival skills and at least some training as a ranger. A newly inducted ranger receives extensive training in guerilla tactics, as well as lessons in anatomy. Senior members are killing machines. They can put an arrow through a goblin's heart at 500 paces and not even break a sweat. Most senior Farstriders have killed more beasts than any soldier in the blood elf military. They make &lt;a href=\"Defias\"&gt;Defias&lt;/a&gt; assassins look like babies.\nHigh elven rangers.\nThe few high elves who join the Farstriders often succumb to blood elf ways and declare themselves sin'dorei. Thus, all Farstriders are blood elf rangers.\nAs such, the high elves no longer possess an official Farstrider organization, though a small number of high elven rangers are still seen in residence at their elven lodges. &lt;a href=\"Farstrider%20Lodge\"&gt;Farstrider Lodge&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Loch%20Modan\"&gt;Loch Modan&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; territory, has since become a &lt;a href=\"dwarven\"&gt;dwarven&lt;/a&gt; hunting lodge since the conversion from &lt;a href=\"quel%27dorei\"&gt;quel'dorei&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"sin%27dorei\"&gt;sin'dorei&lt;/a&gt;, and some exiled rangers (now &lt;a href=\"Wretched\"&gt;Wretched&lt;/a&gt;) once made the &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Lithien%20Lodge\"&gt;Quel'Lithien Lodge&lt;/a&gt; their home away from home.\nNight elven Farstriders.\nFarstriders is also a name given to a small night elf organization based in Ashenvale. They were the only unified night elf presence dwelling in Ashenvale, before the Third War, as a reclusive group of rangers. The Farstriders use the terrain and other inhabitants to train in their specialized skills. They hold a difference of opinion regarding strangers in Ashenvale. Some believe that their duty is to welcome and protect travelers, as long as they show no threat to the forest. Others see any strangers as unwelcome interlopers who must be \u201cescorted\u201d to the southern border. Still, whatever their opinion on Ashenvale, the Farstriders bow to the wishes of the ancients and the sentinels. They lived in the &lt;a href=\"Farstrider%20Camp\"&gt;Farstrider Camp&lt;/a&gt;. Outraged Farstriders prevented orcs that mined &lt;a href=\"Goldcrease%20Mine\"&gt;Goldcrease Mine&lt;/a&gt; from taking the gold.\nRelations.\nBlood elves are known for their grudges. Of all the blood elves, Farstriders carried a deep resentment towards the Horde. They went out of their way to slay trolls, even those of the Horde. They hate the undead as well, they didn't like the fact that the Horde let the Forsaken into their ranks. They have had little experience with tauren, and don't have much quarrel with them but see them as bestial brutes. Despite the fact that blood elves and undead do not get well together, Sylvanas offered assistance to the blood elves despite the feelings of the Farstriders, leading to the blood elves joining the Horde."}

However, during the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, Farthing revealed himself as the new leader of the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; cult and attempted to use &lt;a href=\"Xal%27atath\"&gt;Xal'atath&lt;/a&gt; to resurrect &lt;a href=\"Zakajz%20the%20Corruptor\"&gt;Zakajz the Corruptor&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe is confronted and slain in the &lt;a href=\"Grave-Prison%20of%20Zakajz\"&gt;Grave-Prison of Zakajz&lt;/a&gt; below &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Priest%23Shadow\"&gt;shadow priests&lt;/a&gt; seeking to claim Xal'atath for themselves.\nBiography.\nWhile Farthing once appeared to be a bishop of the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Holy%20Light\"&gt;Church of the Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;, in truth he was a member of the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; who served as the hand to the Twilight Father, &lt;a href=\"Archbishop%20Benedictus\"&gt;Archbishop Benedictus&lt;/a&gt;. While the Twilight Father left to serve &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, Farthing maintained his role as a bishop in Stormwind and continued infiltration and recruitment efforts there for some time until the fall of Deathwing and Benedictus, at which point he claimed leadership of the remaining Twilight's Hammer and ordered them to go quiet in order to allow their foes a temporary victory. However, at some point he found (or perhaps was found by) &lt;a href=\"Xal%27atath\"&gt;Xal'atath&lt;/a&gt;, an ancient &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt; artifact.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Bishop%20Arthur\"&gt;Arthur&lt;/a&gt;, Farthing's replacement in the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt;, the bishop left &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; under the pretense of investigating the accusations and rumors regarding Benedictus' ties to the Twilight's Hammer. He had apparently not quite been himself for some time before leaving, and had started arguing with himself, growing more secretive and ignoring ceremonies.\nWhile Farthing was once a cautious and calculating master who preferred the secrecy of the shadows to direct action, ever since he found the Black Blade his entire demeanor changed and he became arrogant, commanding and audacious. He also began communicating with the dagger, and from it he learned of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Empire\"&gt;Black Empire&lt;/a&gt;, the ancient domain of the Old Gods before they were cast down by the &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt;. With the dagger in hand, he ordered the Twilight's Hammer to set up camp near the &lt;a href=\"Whispering%20Forest\"&gt;Whispering Forest&lt;/a&gt; in the western mountains of &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt;. While this made them visible to the enemies of the cult, Farthing believed it to be worth the risk, as he had somehow acquired knowledge of a titan-forged complex below the nearby lake which housed the grave-prison of &lt;a href=\"Zakajz%20the%20Corruptor\"&gt;Zakajz&lt;/a&gt;, an ancient servant of the Old Gods. Using Xal'atath, Farthing intended to resurrect Zakajz in order to restore the Twilight's Hammer to their pinnacle while also cementing his leadership of the cult.\nFarthing's efforts were halted when a &lt;a href=\"priest%23Shadow\"&gt;shadow priest&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; seeking to claim Xal'atath for themself infiltrated the complex with the aid of &lt;a href=\"Shadowlord%20Slaghammer\"&gt;Shadowlord Slaghammer&lt;/a&gt;, a spy from &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;. While Slaghammer was busy holding off waves of Twilight cultists, the priest adventurer confronted Farthing and fought him until Xal'atath escaped from the deacon's hands. When Farthing expressed confusion over what was happening, Xal'atath called him weak and pitiful, saying that the Twilight Father had not dared to wield it, for he had known the price of failure. The Black Blade then proceeded to kill Farthing before allowing itself to be claimed by the priest champion.\nObjective of.\nHe needs to be killed for the eighth stage of &lt;a href=\"Blade%20in%20Twilight\"&gt;Blade in Twilight&lt;/a&gt;.\nRelatives.\nHe may be related to &lt;a href=\"Coleman%20Farthing\"&gt;Coleman Farthing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Yvette%20Farthing\"&gt;Yvette Farthing&lt;/a&gt;."}

The city appears deserted except for a large number of s plus some other NPCs in the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Strength\"&gt;Valley of Strength&lt;/a&gt;, and there are some guards wandering around the rest of the city.

It is even possible to go outside and into the rest of the world, with more refugees outside the gates of Orgrimmar.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; player is &lt;a href=\"Phasing\"&gt;phased&lt;/a&gt; for all of Durotar and safe from all Horde NPCs and Horde players; indeed, all the regular NPCs are missing. Only if they leave Durotar, or step off a &lt;a href=\"Zeppelin%20tower\"&gt;Zeppelin tower&lt;/a&gt; and onto a docked zeppelin route will they leave the phased zone. Returning to Durotar or zeppelin tower will re-phase the player.\nEver since &lt;a href=\"Patch%203.0.2\"&gt;Patch 3.0.2&lt;/a&gt;, some Alliance players came to realize that the phasing mechanic could allow them to complete the &lt;a href=\"Fishing\"&gt;Fishing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Achievement\"&gt;Achievement&lt;/a&gt;s and in total safety from any Orgrimmar guards or Horde players. While this wasn't strictly a game-breaking mechanic, it \"was\" unfair to Horde players who wanted to complete and , as there is no opportunity to phase &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; in the same way. This is likely the reason why exactly six months later, &lt;a href=\"Patch%203.1.0\"&gt;Patch 3.1.0&lt;/a&gt; changed this so that phased players can only fish up trash."}

It is located in north east &lt;a href=\"Felwood\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt; and includes the tunnel that connects Felwood with &lt;a href=\"Moonglade\"&gt;Moonglade&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Winterspring\"&gt;Winterspring&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nWhen the corruption of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; crept into the sacred forests of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, the furbolgs fell under the corruptive influence of the Burning Legion. However, amidst the chaos and the madness, the &lt;a href=\"Timbermaw%20tribe\"&gt;Timbermaw tribe&lt;/a&gt; escaped the darkness that had fallen on Kalimdor. In the safety of Timbermaw Hold, the furbolgs of the Timbermaw tribe weathered the storm, yet they were forced to watch helplessly as the forest they had loved so much was slowly turned into a twisted, festering perversion of its former self. The corruption had sunk in deep, so that even long after &lt;a href=\"Illidan\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt; had consumed the source of the corruption, a powerful &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; artifact called the &lt;a href=\"Skull%20of%20Gul%27dan\"&gt;Skull of Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;, and vanquished the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s' leader &lt;a href=\"Tichondrius\"&gt;Tichondrius&lt;/a&gt;, the taint on the woods still remained.\nThe furbolgs wary of all strangers, fearing that they may mistake them for their corrupted brethren and attack. However, the Timbermaw tribe are painfully aware that they will not last on their own; adventurers who seek out Timbermaw Hold in northern &lt;a href=\"Felwood\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt; and prove themselves as friends of the Timbermaw tribe will learn that the furbolgs value their friends above all else. Though they possess no fine jewels or any worldly riches, the Timbermaw's shamanistic tradition is still strong. They know much about the art of crafting armors from animal hides, and they are more than happy to share their healing/resurrection knowledge with friends of their tribe. The Timbermaw's main concerns are putting an end to their corrupted brethren's suffering and finding a cure to heal the wounds the corruption of Felwood has inflicted upon the land, so that one day, the ancient forests will once again resound with the peaceful chants and the soft laughter of the children of the forest.\nCataclysm.\nSince the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the Azshara entrance to the Hold has been replaced with the &lt;a href=\"Blackmaw%20Hold\"&gt;Blackmaw Hold&lt;/a&gt; area, with the &lt;a href=\"Blackmaw%20tribe\"&gt;Blackmaw tribe&lt;/a&gt; having a schism with the Timbermaws.\nWarcraft III map.\n\"Centuries ago, Dragons abandoned this place when it was overrun by Satyrs.\"\nIn the RPG.\nThis ancient furbolg fortress is located near Felwood's eastern border. It is a vast and rambling place, rumored to run deep into the slopes of Mount Hyjal. No one knows for sure how big it is, since the furbolgs abandoned it in ages past. &lt;a href=\"Undead\"&gt;Undead&lt;/a&gt; and satyrs may now wander the shadowed corridors... along with whatever cursed furbolgs still roam the depths. Wise travelers would bypass the site entirely if it were not the only passage through to Winterspring and Hyjal Summit.\nTimbermaw Hold is impressive, almost exclusively underground in a system of tunnels, it also contains simple wooden homes inside. Well-sculpted paths lead from Felwood to Moonglade and Winterspring; it contains tunnels to &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; as well, but those aren't available to everyone. The furbolgs here work with the druids of Moonglade frequently, and are some of the staunchest allies of the night elves and the Alliance. If the Scourge ever reappears here, the furbolgs will be some of the most valuable additions against them.\nSpeculation.\nBefore the Cataclysm, the entrance to Timbermaw Hold in the northern mountain range of Azshara, now redesigned as &lt;a href=\"Blackmaw%20Hold\"&gt;Blackmaw Hold&lt;/a&gt;, was merely filled in with dirt and guarded by &lt;a href=\"Gatekeeper%20Rageroar\"&gt;Gatekeeper Rageroar&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Timbermaw%20Shaman\"&gt;Timbermaw Shaman&lt;/a&gt; furbolg, and two &lt;a href=\"Timbermaw%20Den%20Watcher\"&gt;Timbermaw Den Watcher&lt;/a&gt;s. However, the gate is extremely unlike any other furbolg construction. The gate's history is unknown.\nThere is a side tunnel in the Timbermaw Hold, currently blocked by a door headed south, that may connect it with another area. This round, wooden door is a separate object from the cave walls, but has no functionality.\nThere is also the possibility that the Timbermaw Hold may be connected with the Hyjal &lt;a href=\"Barrow%20Deeps\"&gt;Barrow Deeps&lt;/a&gt; since they are known to host at least one uncorrupted furbolg clan, and these connecting tunnels could also be the route used by Tyrande and Malfurion to reach the summit of Mount Hyjal before the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt; after freeing &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;."}

Players begin at unfriendly reputation with Timbermaw Hold faction, but can very quickly (30-60 minutes) reach exalted. There are a few short quest chains and some one-time quests which provide a large amount of reputation. Also, there are repeatable turn-in quests for items dropped from enemies in the &lt;a href=\"Deadwood%20tribe\"&gt;Deadwood tribe&lt;/a&gt; (Felwood) and &lt;a href=\"Winterfall%20tribe\"&gt;Winterfall tribe&lt;/a&gt; (Winterspring). Each kill on these enemies also provides a small amount of reputation.\nBuilding a reputation with this faction allows access to a number of crafting recipes and other benefits such as the &lt;a href=\"Stave%20of%20Fur%20and%20Claw\"&gt;Stave of Fur and Claw&lt;/a&gt; disguise item.

This will allow you to loot &lt;a href=\"Deadwood%20Headdress%20Feather\"&gt;Deadwood Headdress Feather&lt;/a&gt; items from the Furbolg in the area. These feathers can be turned in via a repeatable quest to Grazle for 2000 reputation per 5 feathers. Players may choose to simply grind the Deadwood here in the south area for 20 reputation each kill, and turn in feathers all the way until exalted. This is a good option if you want to save the rest of the zone's quests for later, or just want a simple alternative. Be on the lookout for the level 45 rare spawn &lt;a href=\"Ragepaw\"&gt;Ragepaw&lt;/a&gt;, which provides a bit more reputation.\n\"Level 47\u201349+\": Head to the northernmost point of &lt;a href=\"Felwood\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt; and speak to &lt;a href=\"Nafien\"&gt;Nafien&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ferli\"&gt;Ferli&lt;/a&gt; outside the Timbermaw Hold tunnel entrance, and complete their quests. While doing so, kill Deadwood until you locate a &lt;a href=\"Deadwood%20Ritual%20Totem\"&gt;Deadwood Ritual Totem&lt;/a&gt; (quest starter item) and have collected Feathers in multiples of 5 to turn in to Nafien. Hand in the one-time quests and all Feathers. Accept the &lt;a href=\"Speak%20to%20Salfa\"&gt;Speak to Salfa&lt;/a&gt; quest and head into the Timbermaw Hold tunnel. Inside, turn in &lt;a href=\"Deadwood%20Ritual%20Totem%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Deadwood Ritual Totem (quest)&lt;/a&gt; and pick up &lt;a href=\"Runecloth%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Runecloth (quest)&lt;/a&gt; (and &lt;a href=\"Sacred%20Cloth\"&gt;Sacred Cloth&lt;/a&gt;, if a tailor).

Hand in &lt;a href=\"Delivery%20for%20Donova\"&gt;Delivery for Donova&lt;/a&gt; and complete all of Donova Snowden's furbolg quests. Travel to Winterfall Village (east of Everlook) to pick up the two quests just outside the entrance and complete them.\n\"Until exalted\": Travel back to Timbermaw Hold and hand in &lt;a href=\"Winterfall%20Activity\"&gt;Winterfall Activity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Runecloth%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Runecloth (quest)&lt;/a&gt; (30 &lt;a href=\"runecloth\"&gt;runecloth&lt;/a&gt; needed, dropped commonly in Winterfall Village), and &lt;a href=\"Sacred%20Cloth\"&gt;Sacred Cloth&lt;/a&gt; (Tailors only, requires 2 &lt;a href=\"Mooncloth\"&gt;Mooncloth&lt;/a&gt;). Turn in all Feathers (x5) and Beads (x5) that you have on-hand. Continue killing Deadwood or Winterfall furbolg for reputation and to collect Feathers or Beads for turn-ins.\nRewards.\nWhen you reach Exalted, &lt;a href=\"Gorn%20One%20Eye\"&gt;Gorn One Eye&lt;/a&gt; within Timbermaw Hold offers you a quest, &lt;a href=\"The%20Root%20of%20All%20Evil\"&gt;The Root of All Evil&lt;/a&gt;. The quest explains that the source of the corruption stems from a &lt;a href=\"Satyr\"&gt;Satyr&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Xandivious\"&gt;Xandivious&lt;/a&gt;. He gives you a Demon Summoning Torch which you must take to the top of Winterfall Village. Using the torch summons Xandivious. When defeated he drops a bag that contains \"Essence of Xandivious\". When you return the essence you are awarded the &lt;a href=\"Defender%20of%20the%20Timbermaw\"&gt;Defender of the Timbermaw&lt;/a&gt;, a trinket with a 10 minute cooldown that summons a pet shaman that can both heal and fight."}

They are presumed to be the only furbolg tribe to escape demonic corruption, though this may not be true due to the existence of &lt;a href=\"Krolg\"&gt;Krolg&lt;/a&gt;, an uncorrupted furbolg who was once part of the &lt;a href=\"Foulweald%20tribe\"&gt;Foulweald tribe&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Stillpine%20tribe\"&gt;Stillpine tribe&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Azuremyst%20Isle\"&gt;Azuremyst Isle&lt;/a&gt; from \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;The Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;\". However, many other races kill furbolg blindly now without bothering to see if they are friend or foe. For this reason, the Timbermaw furbolgs trust very few.\nHistory.\nWhen the corruption of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; crept into the sacred forests of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, it was the creatures of the wild who first felt its monstrous power. Once gentle animals were transformed into abominable, rabid killers; their flesh rent and their spirits desecrated, they quickly succumbed to the demons' influence. Soon after, the furbolgs, the ursine children of the forest, suffered the same fate, as their entire species was driven mad by the surrounding corruption. However, amidst the chaos and the madness, one &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt; tribe escaped the darkness that had fallen on Kalimdor. In the safety of &lt;a href=\"Timbermaw%20Hold\"&gt;Timbermaw Hold&lt;/a&gt;, the furbolgs of the Timbermaw tribe weathered the storm, yet they were forced to watch helplessly as the forest they had loved so much was slowly turned into a twisted, festering perversion of its former self. When the spirits of the forest spoke to them no more, the Timbermaw knew that their home was gone... possibly, forever. The corruption had sunk in deep, so that even long after &lt;a href=\"Illidan\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt; the Betrayer had consumed the source of the corruption, a powerful &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; artifact called the &lt;a href=\"Skull%20of%20Gul%27dan\"&gt;Skull of Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;, and vanquished the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s' leader &lt;a href=\"Tichondrius\"&gt;Tichondrius&lt;/a&gt;, the taint on the woods still remained. And so, the dead forest became known only as Felwood. \nWith the Burning Legion defeated, the Timbermaw furbolgs have recently taken their first, careful steps outside of the safety of Timbermaw Hold. They are wary of all strangers, fearing that they may mistake them for their corrupted brethren and attack. However, the Timbermaw are painfully aware that they will not last on their own; adventurers who seek out Timbermaw Hold in northern &lt;a href=\"Felwood\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt; and prove themselves as friends of the Timbermaw will learn that the furbolgs value their friends above all else. Though they possess no fine jewels or any worldly riches, the Timbermaw's shamanistic tradition is still strong. They know much about the art of crafting armors from animal hides, and they are more than happy to share their healing talismans with friends of their tribe. The Timbermaw's main concerns are putting an end to their corrupted brethren's suffering and finding a cure to heal the wounds the corruption of Felwood has inflicted upon the land, so that one day, the ancient forests will once again resound with the peaceful chants and the soft laughter of the children of the forest.\nCataclysm.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Blackmaw%20tribe\"&gt;Blackmaw tribe&lt;/a&gt; broke ranks from the Timbermaw tribe who no longer are present in &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt;'s part of &lt;a href=\"Timbermaw%20Hold\"&gt;Timbermaw Hold&lt;/a&gt; and the area previously in their control is now the area of the Blackmaws, with Timbermaw Hold becoming the &lt;a href=\"Blackmaw%20Hold\"&gt;Blackmaw Hold&lt;/a&gt;.\nFaction.\nThe Timbermaw furbolgs guard the &lt;a href=\"Timbermaw%20Hold\"&gt;Timbermaw Hold&lt;/a&gt; cave that connects &lt;a href=\"Felwood\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Moonglade\"&gt;Moonglade&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Winterspring\"&gt;Winterspring&lt;/a&gt;. You start out as with these furbolgs; you must attain at least an reputation to pass through their cave without them attacking you. If you choose to further build reputation with the Timbermaw, you may be able to access special items, exclusive tradeskill recipes and quests."}

This movement is ordinarily perceived by mortals as regular and determinant, functioning much like a clockwork; yet perception does not dictate reality: time is chaotic, always in flux, and completely malleable, flowing like the sands of an hourglass. While there is an infinite number of timeways, according to &lt;a href=\"Aman%27Thul\"&gt;Aman'Thul&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;, there is only \"one true timeline\", although some would have it otherwise, and without the truth of time as it is meant to unfold, the fabric of reality will unravel.\nTime is a construct of &lt;a href=\"Magic%23Order%20and%20Disorder\"&gt;Order&lt;/a&gt; and can sometimes move differently according to location. saw decades pass after the portal with &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; was closed while mere years happened elsewhere. The perception of time is also chaotic in the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;; to souls in the Shadowlands, it can seem like eons have passed since their deaths whereas only a few months or years have elapsed in the world of the living. Living mortals which are influenced by the force of Order perceive time the way they do. Without a tether to their mortal plane, they no longer have the same perception. Nevertheless, time of some kind, apparently in a less linear way, seems to exist in the Shadowlands, as the &lt;a href=\"Primus\"&gt;Primus&lt;/a&gt;, before leaving his realm and disappearing, had an ally able to peer into the timeways to see every possible outcome for his military and its various tactics in order to determine the best possible ones.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt;, all that matters is this moment, and living in the moment itself is that far more important than dwelling upon the past or future, serving as Time's First Lesson, and one should try not to get caught up in all the loose ends of Time's tangled web. Time itself is, from a certain perspective, an \"illusion\", in that the only true reality is the now, with every past moment being a memory, and every future moment a hope or fear that has not yet manifested, and only by &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; truly being in the present moment was he able to free Nozdormu from the timeways which he was trapped within. Nozdormu told Thrall that it was this quiet, the pause between breaths, the small moments of one's life in which one was receiving and learning rather than giving that made all beings what they truly were, and thereby gave them the strength for their greatest journeys.\nMoving between different points in time is called &lt;a href=\"time%20travel\"&gt;time travel&lt;/a&gt;.\nCharacteristics.\nIn all known realms of the cosmos, time flows forward, ever forward. Chaotic energies in places like the Twisting Nether can affect how quickly it flows, but it only flows forward.\nOnce an event happens, it cannot be changed. These events and choices, made up of all creatures and forces in the cosmos, join together like a river, sharing the same reality. Different choices and different possibilities naturally spin off the river of time like small creeks and estuaries, ebbing and flowing for a while. If these shades of what could have been are left alone, they will eventually dissipate into nothing. If efforts are made to preserve them (or alter them), they can indeed remain in existence indefinitely. They can even be made to feed back into the main river\u2014dead creatures can seemingly \"live again,\" and the past (or future) may literally come back to haunt you. This is not a natural phenomenon, and the inhabitants of the main timeway will often find these experiences to be quite alarming.\nBut the only timeway that has a permanent effect on the cosmos is the main timeway. Creatures like the bronze dragons, who have command of temporal magic, can see all the countless tributaries of alternate universes and timelines, and they can even move back and forth along the stream to observe the past and the future.\nIf that main river is disrupted, it could spell doom and disaster. All life on Azeroth depends on time to flow ever forward. Without the surety that the sun will rise and set each day, the seasons would not pass, the cycle of life would become meaningless, and all living creatures would eventually die from being unable to sustain themselves. It is the most sacred mission of the bronze dragonflight to keep that from happening.\nDue to its damages, in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; the passage of time feels different to members of the &lt;a href=\"bronze%20dragonflight\"&gt;bronze dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;.\nApparently, all alternate versions of the same character (from different timeways and alternate realities) are more or less part of the same being, such as in the case with &lt;a href=\"Draka\"&gt;Draka&lt;/a&gt;, using an analogy of a rope with different threads which can be pulled off, but which \"at some time come together to make that rope\" - basically, alternate versions of various characters are able to exist as temporarily separate entities which lead separate existences for a while, but still basically part of the \"same rope\" which will all eventually come together in the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;.\nAppearance.\nTemporal magic manifests as a bronze or golden light.\nRarely, the essence of time can become crystallized to form an &lt;a href=\"Epoch%20Stone\"&gt;Epoch Stone&lt;/a&gt;: golden mineral matter that radiates the weight of ages. To form, this mineral requires rapid passage through the eras. Its presence indicates that the place or the being in which the stone is found may not exist in one time at all, but shift rapidly from &lt;a href=\"timeway\"&gt;timeway&lt;/a&gt; to timeway.\nChronomancy.\nChronomancy is the &lt;a href=\"Arcane\"&gt;arcanic&lt;/a&gt; art of weaving time. Time &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; is a young field of research. This discipline falls under the school of &lt;a href=\"The%20Schools%20of%20Arcane%20Magic%20-%20Transmutation\"&gt;Transmutation&lt;/a&gt;, allowing the deceleration of events (through &lt;a href=\"Slow%20Fall%20%28ability%29\"&gt;Slow Fall (ability)&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Slow\"&gt;Slow&lt;/a&gt;), the acceleration of events (through &lt;a href=\"Time%20Warp\"&gt;Time Warp&lt;/a&gt;), or returning you back to your previous location and health (through &lt;a href=\"Alter%20Time\"&gt;Alter Time&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Temporal%20Shield\"&gt;Temporal Shield&lt;/a&gt;) among other possibilities.\nTo fulfill their duty of protecting the timeways, the agents of the &lt;a href=\"Timewalkers\"&gt;Timewalkers&lt;/a&gt; may use a &lt;a href=\"%3ATimewalker%20Staff\"&gt;:Timewalker Staff&lt;/a&gt;, an instrument for manipulating time magic as shepherding the timeways is a dangerous work. In their ranks, the Weavers are &lt;a href=\"Arcanist\"&gt;arcanists&lt;/a&gt; who specialize in chronomancy. Only they can repair damage to the timeways, open temporal portals, and other such tasks.\nModifying divination magic with temporal magic can allow one to see across time.\nThe &lt;a href=\"%3ASands%20of%20Time\"&gt;:Sands of Time&lt;/a&gt; can be used by skilled chronomancers to alter the course of time.\nInfluences.\n&lt;a href=\"Bronze%20dragonflight\"&gt;Bronze dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;.\nEmpowered by &lt;a href=\"Aman%27Thul\"&gt;Aman'Thul&lt;/a&gt;'s cosmic powers, the dragon &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt; and his flight were enabled to guard time itself and police the ever-spinning and interweaving pathways of fate and destiny. All who sought to disrupt the timestream flow faced the Great Aspect and his brood's &lt;a href=\"Keepers%20of%20Time\"&gt;Keepers of Time&lt;/a&gt;.\nIntrusive time-shifting of the &lt;a href=\"Infinite%20dragonflight\"&gt;Infinite dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; creates tears in time itself, twisting it infinitely into crystallized essences.\nShortly after the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Krasus\"&gt;Krasus&lt;/a&gt; believed that Nozdormu held time together against an anomaly.\nMembers of the bronze dragonflight can help &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s &lt;a href=\"Time%20Travelling\"&gt;time travel&lt;/a&gt; to older versions of some &lt;a href=\"zone\"&gt;zone&lt;/a&gt;s.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20North%20Wind\"&gt;The North Wind&lt;/a&gt; was responsible for time going awry in eastern &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Peaks\"&gt;Storm Peaks&lt;/a&gt;, with time rifts being present that needed to be closed. The corrupt timeline was restored with &lt;a href=\"The%20Lorehammer\"&gt;The Lorehammer&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;.\nTime is meaningless inside the Dream. As a result, the green dragonflight, which spends the majority of its time in the Dream, is extremely long-lived. Ysera's consorts in particular almost never emerge from the Dream and are effectively immortal, as are all other permanent denizens in the Dream.\n&lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the orcs entered the Nether they journeyed through time and space from another world and into Azeroth. A spell that would cast one into the past was hardly that much different.\nTime passes differently deep inside the Twisting Nether, and it is impossible to tell whether days, years, or centuries have passed. &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria&lt;/a&gt; have fought in the Nether for a thousand years from their perspective, while on Azeroth it has been only a few decades.\n&lt;a href=\"Immortality\"&gt;Immortality&lt;/a&gt;.\nImmortal creatures essentially stop aging when they reach adulthood, and thus, they cannot die merely from old age. It was Nozdormu's blessing on &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt; which conferred immortality, immunity to aging and disease, to the entire &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;kaldorei&lt;/a&gt; race; Nozdormu has likewise blessed &lt;a href=\"Xarantaur\"&gt;Xarantaur&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jonathan%20the%20Revelator\"&gt;Jonathan the Revelator&lt;/a&gt; with immortality.\n&lt;a href=\"Spirit%20of%20Air\"&gt;Spirit of Air&lt;/a&gt;.\nAided by the Spirit of Air, a shaman may be able to see faraway objects or events, whether the distance be physical or temporal.\n&lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt;s.\nWith the titans intrinsically being aligned with the Arcane and Order, some members of the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"Aman%27Thul\"&gt;Aman'Thul&lt;/a&gt; have considerable mastery over time itself. The &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Aman%27thul\"&gt;Eye of Aman'thul&lt;/a&gt; created the &lt;a href=\"Nightwell\"&gt;Nightwell&lt;/a&gt;, and Aman'Thul claimed that time was the one force capable of binding the \"relentless fury\" of &lt;a href=\"Argus%20the%20Unmaker\"&gt;Argus the Unmaker&lt;/a&gt; during their confrontation, attempting to collapse time around him and briefly dissipating his form, though his powers failed to truly subdue him. Aman'Thul's vision of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s one day causing the &lt;a href=\"Hour%20of%20Twilight\"&gt;Hour of Twilight&lt;/a&gt;, capable of potentially wiping out all life on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, was one of the reasons the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; empowered &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt; and the other Aspects with their powers, to ultimately avert this single catastrophe, although Aman'Thul for all his vast powers was not omniscient and was unaware &lt;a href=\"Neltharion\"&gt;Neltharion&lt;/a&gt; would eventually be corrupted into &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Timewalkers\"&gt;Timewalkers&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt;' loss of power following the fall of &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, the bronze dragons required mortal help to police the timeways. Vowing to protect them at any cost, the &lt;a href=\"Keepers%20of%20Time\"&gt;Keepers of Time&lt;/a&gt; reformed themselves as the Timewalkers, a new faction comprised of both dragons and mortals.\n&lt;a href=\"%3AVision%20of%20Time\"&gt;:Vision of Time&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Vision of Time was an hourglass created by &lt;a href=\"Kairozdormu\"&gt;Kairozdormu&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"%3AEpoch%20Stone\"&gt;:Epoch Stone&lt;/a&gt;s from the &lt;a href=\"Timeless%20Isle\"&gt;Timeless Isle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"%3ASands%20of%20Time\"&gt;:Sands of Time&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Hourglass%20of%20Time\"&gt;Hourglass of Time&lt;/a&gt;. During &lt;a href=\"Garrosh\"&gt;Garrosh&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"War%20Crimes\"&gt;trial&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, Kairoz smashed the hourglass to bring Garrosh to Year -4 of an &lt;a href=\"Draenor%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;alternate universe Draenor&lt;/a&gt;. The Vision of Time and its shards can also be used to see through time by those without any particular knowledge of chronomancy.\nNightborne.\n&lt;a href=\"Elisande\"&gt;Elisande&lt;/a&gt; was a master in time magic. She put an army into a time lock which contained &lt;a href=\"Lesser%20Chaotid\"&gt;chaotids&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Pulsauron\"&gt;pulsaurons&lt;/a&gt; that hid between threads of time.\nSome &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt; rewind time to heal.\nNaaru.\nThe &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; technology of the \"&lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt;\" can warp time.\nOld Gods.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s have appeared capable of disrupting the timeways, as their past interference in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; has demonstrated; it required &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt;'s full concentration and strength to just barely hold their machinations at bay, and they are also responsible for eventually corrupting Nozdormu into his twisted future self of &lt;a href=\"Murozond\"&gt;Murozond&lt;/a&gt;. It has been implied they are allied with the &lt;a href=\"infinite%20dragonflight\"&gt;infinite dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, as they worked together with &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;'s servants during the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, and brought &lt;a href=\"Aedelas%20Blackmoore%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Aedelas Blackmoore&lt;/a&gt; from an alternate timeway into the main reality, where he slew &lt;a href=\"Arygos\"&gt;Arygos&lt;/a&gt; to reanimate &lt;a href=\"Chromatus\"&gt;Chromatus&lt;/a&gt;. They also appear to be capable of constantly seeing all paths and possible futures, and embrace them all simultaneously as truth, in contrast with the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;, even being aware of the &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt;'s covert manipulations as detailed in &lt;a href=\"Enemy%20Infiltration%20-%20Preface\"&gt;Enemy Infiltration - Preface&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"Il%27gynoth%2C%20Corruption%20Reborn\"&gt;Il'gynoth, Corruption Reborn&lt;/a&gt; noting that .\nTailoring.\nTailors can mend &lt;a href=\"Time%20Rift%20%28BfA%29\"&gt;Time Rifts&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Synchronous%20Thread\"&gt;Synchronous Thread&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Timeweaver%20Delormi\"&gt;Timeweaver Delormi&lt;/a&gt; is among a group known as the &lt;a href=\"Synchronous%20Tailors\"&gt;Synchronous Tailors&lt;/a&gt;.\nWildlife.\nDue to the &lt;a href=\"infinite%20dragonflight\"&gt;infinite dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; attack on the &lt;a href=\"Temporal%20Conflux\"&gt;Temporal Conflux&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Thaldraszus\"&gt;Thaldraszus&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;, unstable temporal energy was seeping into the &lt;a href=\"Flowing%20Forest\"&gt;Flowing Forest&lt;/a&gt;, and its &lt;a href=\"Time-Charged%20Bear\"&gt;bears&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Time-Charged%20Vorquin\"&gt;vorquin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Time-Charged%20Ohuna\"&gt;ohuna&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Time-Charged%20Hornswog\"&gt;hornswogs&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Time-Charged%20Salamanther\"&gt;salamanthers&lt;/a&gt; were infused with time magic, making them hostile."}

{"id": "202572", "revid": "40286973", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=202572", "title": "Time-Lost Proto-Drake", "text": "Time-Lost Proto-Drake is an extremely &lt;a href=\"Rare%20mob\"&gt;rare monster&lt;/a&gt; which occasionally appears among the mountains of the &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Peaks\"&gt;Storm Peaks&lt;/a&gt;. It is especially sought after because it has a 100% chance of dropping &lt;a href=\"Reins%20of%20the%20Time-Lost%20Proto-Drake\"&gt;Reins of the Time-Lost Proto-Drake&lt;/a&gt; when killed. Because of its rarity, many players may hunt it for weeks before they even see it at all, much less kill it themselves.\nThe drake is out of reach of ground attacks for most of its flights, and must usually be pulled while on a flying mount or in flight form.\nKnown flight routes, spawn locations and patterns.\nThe spawn spot coordinates are: - - - Each spawn spot can spawn either Time-Lost Proto-Drake or &lt;a href=\"Vyragosa\"&gt;Vyragosa&lt;/a&gt;. The routes can differ slightly from time to time, but remain relatively the same. Most add-ons only show the most common path taken. \nAny time Time-Lost Proto-Drake or Vyragosa spawns, it can go either clockwise or counter-clockwise on all four paths. However, each path has a direction it usually flies towards on: the spawn overlooking Frozen Lake usually goes clockwise, the spawn overlooking the large waterfall tends to go counter-clockwise, the spawn from Brunnhildar tends to go counter-clockwise, and the spawn from Ulduar Ravine tends to travel counter-clockwise. Again, however, all have been observed sometimes traveling opposite the norm.\nThe only spawn time-related information one can count on is that after Vyragosa or Time-Lost Proto-Drake are killed, neither will spawn for 6 hours. Spawns can be anywhere from 6-22+ hours after a kill. This all depends on how fast rares are being killed across Northrend. There has been extensive studying and experimenting done on this. Every time a team was camping all four spawn spots with a secondary team scouring Northrend killing every rare they could find, the times shifted more towards every 6\u201311 hours as opposed to the more normal 12\u201320 hours.\nThere is no discernible pattern involving how many minutes before or after the hour or what hour of the day it will \"usually\" spawn from. None of the spawn spots are more active than any of the others. It is all random.\nConnection with Vyragosa.\nTime-Lost Proto-Drake appears to share spawn points, flight routes, and possibly spawn timers with , another rare spawn monster in the &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Peaks\"&gt;Storm Peaks&lt;/a&gt;. The current speculation is that Time-Lost Proto-Drake is a \"rare spawn\" of Vyragosa; that is, whenever Vyragosa would normally spawn, there is a small chance that Time-Lost Proto-Drake will spawn instead in her place. Because the two creatures share the same spawn points and paths, Vyragosa sightings can be used as a good way to identify potential Time-Lost Proto-Drake flight routes.\nThe drake was the first rare spawn of a rare spawn before the introduction of &lt;a href=\"Aeonaxx\"&gt;Aeonaxx&lt;/a&gt;.\nTips.\nTime-Lost Proto-Drake is not a challenging fight and should be easily soloable by all classes. However, having some &lt;a href=\"Snowfall%20Lager\"&gt;Snowfall Lager&lt;/a&gt; on hand is highly recommended. Since it often flies out of reach of most attacks, this will allow one to attack it in the air to initiate combat, and then use the Lager to avoid falling to one's death after dismounting.\nThe absolute best way to farm Time-Lost Proto-Drake is to pick a direct spawn spot and camp it. While it is currently still popular to pick a route-central, multi-path crossing, this is not the most logical place to sit at. When sitting at one of these, you have no idea who is at, near or passing by any of the four spawn spots. Thus, for all you know, all four of the known spawn spots are camped and, usually, you cannot even see them from the popular multi-path camp spots. Yet, if you pick a spawn spot such as Frozen Lake's, that can see Ulduar Ravine and Waterfall's flight path, you are guaranteed a 1/4 chance of directly tagging a spawn, plus the chance of seeing one en-route. The further you are away from the spawn spot(s), the further down your chances drop.\nFlying around is clearly the worst way in regards to actually scoring the kill. No matter how good your path may be, you do not know which of the four it can spawn from and you don't know which direction it went. It is entirely possible that even four people can be out flying around and just miss it by a few yards out of sight. As aforementioned, the further you are from a spawn spot, the more your chances fall. Conversely, the more you move around the more likely you are to miss it for any variety of reasons.\nIf you are truly interested in obtaining this very rare mount, be prepared to invest a \"lot\" of time camping the Storm Peaks. The creature's name is apt; anyone who puts in the time to hunt for it will surely have quite a bit of \"time lost\" for their efforts. Be patient.\nSee &lt;a href=\"Rare%20mob%23Addons_and_other_assistance\"&gt;Rare mob&lt;/a&gt; for information on addons and other means of making rare mob locating easier."}

Then follow the objective tracker to complete the assigned tasks.\nAs players defeat the requested enemies or finish tasks, they will gain standing with &lt;a href=\"Soridormi%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Soridormi's friendship faction&lt;/a&gt;, earn &lt;a href=\"Paracausal%20Flakes\"&gt;Paracausal Flakes&lt;/a&gt;, and Temporal Essence points.

Players must first speak with Soridormi to opt into the event and load into the Time Rifts phase, where two timeways are invading.\nIn the first stage, lasting for nine minutes, players will be tasked with individual or group activities. These tasks include killing as many enemies as possible under a time limit, grouping up to defeat a named elite target, flying through or running over enemies, dragging large objects to portals, or minigames like identifying enemies from the wrong timeline.\nIn this stage, keep an eye out for quest-starting objects or NPCs after completing tasks! These quests are criteria of an account-wide achievement and also grant reputation with Soridormi.\nKills of requested (non-elite) enemies are worth one point of reputation, two &lt;a href=\"Paracausal%20Flakes\"&gt;Paracausal Flakes&lt;/a&gt; and three Temporal Essence. Completed tasks are worth 20, 30, and 50 respectively.\nOnce the nine-minute timer runs out, a large portal spawns in the center of the reservoir and all players should enter it. After the loading screen, players will be in one of the invading timeways' boss encounters. Defeat the boss, look for another quest-starting NPC or object, then take the portal to exit the timeway and return to Soridormi.\nQuests.\nOnce a week, Soridormi offers &lt;a href=\"When%20Time%20Needs%20Mending\"&gt;When Time Needs Mending&lt;/a&gt;, an account-wide wrapper quest for the event, which rewards a &lt;a href=\"Contained%20Paracausality\"&gt;Contained Paracausality&lt;/a&gt; that contains roughly , a &lt;a href=\"Soridormi%27s%20Letter%20of%20Commendation\"&gt;Soridormi's Letter of Commendation&lt;/a&gt; (+1,000 rep), and a &lt;a href=\"Paracausal%20Cluster\"&gt;Paracausal Cluster&lt;/a&gt; (1,000 &lt;a href=\"Paracausal%20Flakes\"&gt;Paracausal Flakes&lt;/a&gt;).\nThere are fourteen items to be found across the seven invading timeways, which are all required for the &lt;a href=\"Temporal%20Acquisitions%20Specialist\"&gt;Temporal Acquisitions Specialist&lt;/a&gt; achievement:\nFinally, as players improve their standing with Soridormi, she offers a quest with a reward at each reputation level:\nRewards.\nEight vendors near Soridormi trade in &lt;a href=\"Paracausal%20Flakes\"&gt;Paracausal Flakes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dilated%20Time%20Capsule\"&gt;Dilated Time Capsule&lt;/a&gt;:\nAchievements.\nThere are nine achievements involved with the scenario:\nInvasions.\nEach Time Rift scenario, two timeways will invade from a set of seven. One of those timeways will be the boss encounter.\n&lt;a href=\"A.Z.E.R.O.T.H.\"&gt;A.Z.E.R.O.T.H.&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn this timeway, &lt;a href=\"King%20Mechagon\"&gt;King Mechagon&lt;/a&gt; has succeeded in his effort to return anyone of flesh into robotic parts. The Overlord Mechagon encounter takes place in a unique mechanical arena.\n&lt;a href=\"Azewrath\"&gt;Azewrath&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn this timeway, the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; won the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; 10,000 years ago, which drastically changed the outcome of the war and led to the fel corruption of many races. In the first stage of the scenario, players come across &lt;a href=\"Ellemayne%20%28NPC%29\"&gt;Ellemayne&lt;/a&gt;, an uncorrupted night elf, who hands over a &lt;a href=\"Map%20to%20Suramar\"&gt;Map to Suramar&lt;/a&gt;, looking for help with the resistance under the command of &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Illidan Stormrage boss encounter takes place on a &lt;a href=\"Legion%20ship\"&gt;Legion ship&lt;/a&gt;, reusing the &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden%20%28Tomb%20of%20Sargeras%20tactics%29\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; map in &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the encounter, Illidan drops &lt;a href=\"An%20Antlered%20Skull\"&gt;An Antlered Skull&lt;/a&gt;, that of &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Azmerloth\"&gt;Azmerloth&lt;/a&gt;.\nAzmerloth is one of apparently many timeways that have been overrun by &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt;s.

Additionally, several named murlocs have crossed over, such as &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grrrmrrsh Hrrnglscrrrm&lt;/a&gt;, and a minion of &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwingurlugull&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Gill'dan boss encounter takes place at the base of &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Ergbrgls Flrgmrbbl&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Mrrglblight&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the encounter, &lt;a href=\"Alulgultasza%20de%20Urgl-Blalul\"&gt;Alulgultasza de Urgl-Blalul&lt;/a&gt; appears and offers players the &lt;a href=\"Azmerlothian%20Hourglass\"&gt;Azmerlothian Hourglass&lt;/a&gt;, capable of briefly bringing her to the main timeline, where she has a conversation with &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Azmourne\"&gt;Azmourne&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Lich King encounter takes place atop the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt;, much like &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;the original encounter&lt;/a&gt; in the primary timeline.\nAfter the encounter, players notice a &lt;a href=\"Gilded%20Vase\"&gt;Gilded Vase&lt;/a&gt; in a place of prominence atop Icecrown.\n&lt;a href=\"Azq%27roth\"&gt;Azq'roth&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Fury of N'zoth encounter takes place in a special Black Empire-themed arena.\nAfter the encounter, a &lt;a href=\"Chipped%20Stone%20Tablet\"&gt;Chipped Stone Tablet&lt;/a&gt; stands out, detailing the efforts of one sacrifice attempting to save another.\n&lt;a href=\"Ulderoth\"&gt;Ulderoth&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe special mechanic for this timeway is Ulderoth Mutagen Orbs, which function like &lt;a href=\"Anima%20Cell\"&gt;Anima Cell&lt;/a&gt;s from &lt;a href=\"Torghast\"&gt;Torghast&lt;/a&gt;.

Beings can travel forward, backwards, or sideways (hence visiting an &lt;a href=\"alternate%20universe\"&gt;alternate universe&lt;/a&gt;, as in \"&lt;a href=\"Warlords%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Warlords of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;\") through time and have the ability to change history sometimes (like killing &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20the%20Houndmaster\"&gt;Hakkar&lt;/a&gt;) or steer a timeline towards an &lt;a href=\"Alternate%20timeline\"&gt;alternate future&lt;/a&gt; (as what happens when &lt;a href=\"Murozond\"&gt;Murozond&lt;/a&gt; sends &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to the &lt;a href=\"End%20Time\"&gt;End Time&lt;/a&gt;).\n&lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt; explained two different theories of time to &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; while he was still an apprentice. One followed the most common idea of a sequential series of events, while the other was one of predetermined history. He used the comparison between a clock and a sand time as a metaphor to explain himself. With a sand timer, all the events in time are there, what order in which they are determined (passing through the sand timer) is random, but that which we experience and see will appear to be in order, and still have the same outcome. Both theories share the idea that nothing people do can change the future, they need only play their part to lead up to it.\nTeleporting to the future is called chronoporting.\nKnown instances of time travel.\nCaverns of Time.\nLocated in the eastern part of &lt;a href=\"Tanaris\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt; contain various portals to different key historical periods and events in &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; history. The caverns act as a crossroads for the various timeways, and through them one can travel back and forth along the ebb and flow of time. The &lt;a href=\"Bronze%20Dragonflight\"&gt;Bronze Dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; protect the Caverns of Time and seek to make sure history is unchanged so that the timeways are not altered. Usually, the &lt;a href=\"Keepers%20of%20Time\"&gt;Keepers of Time&lt;/a&gt; are tasked with normal maintenance and fixing ordinary minor disturbances like rogue mages changing something in the past to elevate their status or wealth in the present.

Here, time has no meaning, and the sun neither rises nor sets. Its unique characteristics have brought the Isle under the scrutiny of the &lt;a href=\"bronze%20dragonflight\"&gt;bronze dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, pandaren explorers, and the black dragon &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Timeless Isle is a level 30-35 PvE zone located to the east of the Jade Forest. Seek the Isle alone or in a group to collect &lt;a href=\"Timeless%20Coin\"&gt;Timeless Coin&lt;/a&gt;s (which will allow players to purchase unique gear from the locals) or to do battle with massive creatures and dangerous world bosses. Among the latter are &lt;a href=\"Ordos\"&gt;Ordos&lt;/a&gt;, the lost Yaungol fire god; and the four &lt;a href=\"August%20Celestial\"&gt;August Celestial&lt;/a&gt;s, who stand ready to test the mettle of adventurers taking part in Wrathion's legendary quest.\nWhile there are quest-givers on the Timeless Isle, they are not there to give specific directions; they encourage players to simply throw themselves into the experience, collecting coins and reacting to the dynamic events, bosses, and puzzles that emerge from the depths of the isle\u2019s unexplored interior...\nHistory.\nThe Timeless Isle, so named because it exists in a state of perpetual sunset, was once a place of great reverence for the &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt;. It was here that trials of wisdom, hope, strength, and fortitude took place in front of the great &lt;a href=\"August%20Celestials\"&gt;Celestials&lt;/a&gt;... where warriors and aspiring leaders would show their willingness to walk in the footsteps of the great Emperor, &lt;a href=\"Shaohao\"&gt;Shaohao&lt;/a&gt;. As a testament to their goal of achieving balance in all things, the pandaren monks even existed in harmony with the nearby &lt;a href=\"Yaungol\"&gt;Yaungol&lt;/a&gt;, worshippers of the fiery &lt;a href=\"demigod\"&gt;demigod&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ordos\"&gt;Ordos&lt;/a&gt;.\nBut one day, the island vanished. Some scrolls indicate that the Timeless Isle has come and gone throughout history\u2014sometimes just a glimmer in the distance, often appearing in different locations. Some less fortunate adventurers dared step foot on the island during these moments and were just as quickly lost to the Timeways, never to be seen again.\nNow\u2014and perhaps only for a moment\u2014the island has returned.\nGetting there.\nPlayers are first introduced to the Timeless Isle via the quest &lt;a href=\"A%20Flash%20of%20Bronze...\"&gt;A Flash of Bronze...&lt;/a&gt;, which starts automatically upon entering their faction's shrine in the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt; after arriving at level 90. After meeting up with &lt;a href=\"Chromie\"&gt;Chromie&lt;/a&gt; outside the entrance to the &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20Knowledge\"&gt;Seat of Knowledge&lt;/a&gt; above &lt;a href=\"Mogu%27shan%20Palace\"&gt;Mogu'shan Palace&lt;/a&gt;, she starts &lt;a href=\"Journey%20to%20the%20Timeless%20Isle\"&gt;Journey to the Timeless Isle&lt;/a&gt; and hands players the . The timepiece is a one-time use teleport, sending players directly to the watcher's position on the isle, either at the &lt;a href=\"Tushui%20Landing\"&gt;Tushui Landing&lt;/a&gt; for the Alliance or the &lt;a href=\"Huojin%20Landing\"&gt;Huojin Landing&lt;/a&gt; for the Horde. At the landing point is a flight path, which can then be used for return trips to the isle.\nUnder 90, or if you want to get there on your own, from the southeastern tip of &lt;a href=\"Jade%20Forest\"&gt;Jade Forest&lt;/a&gt; (just north of &lt;a href=\"Moonwater%20Retreat\"&gt;Moonwater Retreat&lt;/a&gt;), fly east-southeast over &lt;a href=\"Mistveil%20Sea\"&gt;Mistveil Sea&lt;/a&gt; through the &lt;a href=\"fatigue\"&gt;fatigue&lt;/a&gt; waters to reach the island. Even with only 225 skill, players will reach land before the fatigue bar empties.\nAs of April 15, 2015, players under 90 cannot fly there.\nGeography.\nThe Isle is lushly forested, with flora similar to that found in the &lt;a href=\"Jade%20Forest\"&gt;Jade Forest&lt;/a&gt;. The waters of the &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Lake\"&gt;Ruby Lake&lt;/a&gt; are colored a strange reddish hue, possibly due to the ruby crystals found deep within the mountains of the Timeless Isle. &lt;a href=\"Yaungol\"&gt;Yaungol&lt;/a&gt; control the mountainous regions of the island, led by their \"fire god\" &lt;a href=\"Ordos\"&gt;Ordos&lt;/a&gt;, while the lowlands are mostly abandoned save for the &lt;a href=\"Celestial%20Court\"&gt;Celestial Court&lt;/a&gt; where many residents of Pandaria have gathered to watch the August Celestial's trials. The &lt;a href=\"Huojin%20Pandaren\"&gt;Huojin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tushui%20Pandaren\"&gt;Tushui&lt;/a&gt; pandaren have made landfall and established camps at the western shore, but have been asked by the Celestials to not press further inland. \nPerpetual Freedom.\nOnce you're on the Timeless Isle, it's open-world adventuring at your own pace. There are a couple quests on the island, but they're not going to tell you exactly where to go and what to do. Instead they exist to encourage you to explore caverns, discover underwater grottos, and battle all manner of frightful beasts for great rewards.\nThe island offers greater challenges as you move away from the serene forest surrounding the temple grounds and into the fiery &lt;a href=\"Ordon%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Ordon Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cavern%20of%20Lost%20Spirits\"&gt;Cavern of Lost Spirits&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Croaking%20Hollow\"&gt;Croaking Hollow&lt;/a&gt;, and other mysterious locales. As this is an open-world experience, everything except the raid bosses is designed to be taken on solo. Being able to take on large creatures by yourself also means that, when the number of people visiting the island dwindles, you'll still be able to bring new characters there and engage with everything it has to offer. While the Elites on the island are standard \"&lt;a href=\"tap\"&gt;group-tap&lt;/a&gt;\", all of the &lt;a href=\"Rare\"&gt;Rare&lt;/a&gt;s are \"&lt;a href=\"Tap%23No%20tap\"&gt;no-tap&lt;/a&gt;\", so if you see anyone fighting them, even someone from the opposite faction, you can join in and both benefit from bringing it down. Everything on the island also drops something unique. For the easier enemies, it may be consumables that grant you &lt;a href=\"Timeless%20Coin\"&gt;Timeless Coin&lt;/a&gt;s (see below) or aid you in your adventures into darker places, while tougher enemies can drop epic &lt;a href=\"BoA\"&gt;BoA&lt;/a&gt; tokens that can be used to gain Item Level (ilvl) 496 loot, upgrade tokens to gain ilvl 535 gear, Lesser Charms, battle pets, and more.\nPower Unending.\nThose who choose to join the burning ranks of the &lt;a href=\"Ordon\"&gt;Ordon&lt;/a&gt;, the yaungol followers of Ordos, will have access to the powers of the &lt;a href=\"Censer%20of%20Eternal%20Agony\"&gt;Censer of Eternal Agony&lt;/a&gt;. Using the Censer will flag you for PvP to everyone-even your own faction. Your skin takes on a bright flame effect, showing all around that you've summoned the rage of Ordos and are out for blood. Using the Censer also immediately reduces your health to 10% of its maximum (which you can then heal back up over time), keeping it from becoming a quick ganking device. On PvE realms, the rules of flagging still apply; it won't become open warfare, but players can choose to engage these flagged players if they like. On PvP realms, though, this menacing new threat will certainly be a target for both factions. Finally, when you kill other players while you\u2019re under the effects of the Censer, you'll gain &lt;a href=\"Bloody%20Coin\"&gt;Bloody Coin&lt;/a&gt;s, a currency that can be exchanged for exclusive rewards.\nQuests.\nThere are only a handful of quests on the isle:\nAfter that, the isle is largely self-directed:\nInstead are a number of events that occur randomly all over the isle.\nEndless events.\nTimeless events occur all over the Timeless Isle. These events are varied and include treasure chests guarded with good loot and a healthy amount of &lt;a href=\"Timeless%20Coin\"&gt;Timeless Coin&lt;/a&gt;s, out-of-the-way treasure chests requiring creative exploring to get to, special spawned mobs, and bosses that will take a group to defeat, among many others. Most non-trivial chests and mobs will drop a &lt;a href=\"timeless%20armor%20token\"&gt;timeless armor token&lt;/a&gt; or two, which can be turned into an item level 496 epic randomly-enchanted item.\nWild pets.\nThere are a huge number of wild pets on Timeless Isle, but most are found as drops rather than as actual wild pets wandering the isle:\nAchievements.\nThere are a number of achievements awarded for completing activities on the Timeless Isle across all types of the game:"}

The following key can be used to determine where a gem can be obtained from.\nCrafted (C).\nJewelcrafters (skill levels 300-325) can craft most gems. Those with skill level 350+ can also craft many gems. Finally, jewelcrafters with skill level 365+ can craft &lt;a href=\"%23Meta\"&gt;meta&lt;/a&gt; gems.\nSpecial gems.\nMeta.\nMeta gems match meta sockets. These gems have special requirements that must be met for the gem's bonus to activate. For example, in order to gain the benefits of a &lt;a href=\"Destructive%20Skyfire%20Diamond\"&gt;Destructive Skyfire Diamond&lt;/a&gt; there must be a minimum of 2 gems of the listed colors (Red, Blue &amp; Yellow in this example) between all the items currently equipped on the character. \nIt should be noted that gems which match multiple socket colors can fulfill meta gem requirements for any color they match (a Green gem counts as a blue gem and a yellow gem, Orange = yellow + red, and Purple counts as red + blue). For example, if a meta gem needs 3 red and 2 yellow to activate, 3 orange (red/yellow) gems can activate this gem. Also, a gem does not have to match its socket to contribute to a meta gem; therefore, the player may choose to lose an item's gem bonus in order to activate the meta gem's bonus. As mentioned at the top of this article, so far, only high-end helms have meta sockets."}

Before you go through the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, you must have the &lt;a href=\"The%20Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;The Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt; Expansion Pack installed.\nYou also may have a mage friend offer to port you to Shattrath once you are of level for Outland. Though there's no harm in doing so, the quest progression for Outland starts at the Dark Portal so it is suggested that you first enter through there.\nGetting to the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis was formerly difficult, but &lt;a href=\"Patch%203.2\"&gt;Patch 3.2&lt;/a&gt; trivialized it. Every city has a portal leading straight to the &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt; right next to the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;. These portals are found near wherever the mage trainers are; ask a guard if you aren't sure where. You must be level 58 or higher to use them, however.\nHonor Hold.\nWhen you arrive in Outland, you will automatically have a flight path to &lt;a href=\"Honor%20Hold\"&gt;Honor Hold&lt;/a&gt;, which will be your main quest hub for early Hellfire Peninula. In Honor Hold, you can find quests for &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Ramparts\"&gt;Hellfire Ramparts&lt;/a&gt; which is part of Hellfire Citadel, and is the first instance in Outland.\nGetting to &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere is one Capital city in Outland, Shattrath, which is a neutral city open to both Horde and Alliance.\nTo get there, you can either cross Hellfire directly west to Zangarmarsh and then follow the road south to Terokkar (you cannot miss the city when going this route, it's very obvious), or you can take the southern exit from Hellfire into Terokkar Forest, and then turning west when the road does.\nThere are two Inns in Shattrath, one on &lt;a href=\"Scryer%27s%20Tier\"&gt;Scryer's Tier&lt;/a&gt; and one on &lt;a href=\"Aldor%20Rise\"&gt;Aldor Rise&lt;/a&gt;. On your first visit you can set you hearthstone at whichever you wish as you will be neutral with both, but once you choose either the &lt;a href=\"Scryers\"&gt;Scryers&lt;/a&gt; Faction or the &lt;a href=\"Aldor\"&gt;Aldor&lt;/a&gt; Faction (the other will not like you anymore), you should set your hearthstone to the matching inn.\nReturning to Azeroth.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Terrace%20of%20Light\"&gt;Terrace of Light&lt;/a&gt; there are permanent portals leading to each of the four Alliance Capital cities (and each of the four Horde Capital cities too, unusable by the Alliance). Many find it helpful to set their Hearthstone to Shattrath so they can get to any city in Azeroth they wish to quickly.\nThere are also portals to Stormwind and Orgrimmar right beyond the portal in corresponding camps."}

The group has dedicated itself to defending &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; and the Sound from external threats that might emerge, though they specialize in fighting monsters and creatures from the sea, centered around &lt;a href=\"Anglepoint%20Bay\"&gt;Anglepoint Bay&lt;/a&gt;. The group maintains a &lt;a href=\"Outrigger%20Post\"&gt;base&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Krakenbane%20Cove\"&gt;Krakenbane Cove&lt;/a&gt;.\nEventually, as the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt; progressed, the Outriggers would accept an offer to crew a new flagship constructed specifically for King &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"Rosaline%20Madison\"&gt;Rosaline Madison&lt;/a&gt; acting as first mate on board.\nHistory.\nThe Outriggers would become a well-established force within &lt;a href=\"Tiragarde%20Sound\"&gt;Tiragarde Sound&lt;/a&gt; as one of the region's staunchest defenders, with trophies of their victories known to be displayed in &lt;a href=\"Boralus\"&gt;Boralus&lt;/a&gt; itself. From &lt;a href=\"Outrigger%20Post\"&gt;Outrigger Post&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Anglepoint%20Bay\"&gt;Anglepoint Bay&lt;/a&gt;, the monster hunters kept a close eye on Tiragarde Sound's westernmost sea gate, integral to the kingdom's security.\nAt the same time as the &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiran%20civil%20war\"&gt;Kul Tiran civil war&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Anglepoint%20Wharf\"&gt;Anglepoint Wharf&lt;/a&gt; and the nearby bay became gradually corrupted by &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods%27%20forces\"&gt;dark forces&lt;/a&gt; of immense power. With the help of &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;heroes&lt;/a&gt;, the betrayal of &lt;a href=\"Director%20Deepwarden\"&gt;Director Deepwarden&lt;/a&gt; was uncovered and his followers' influence gradually pushed back. The Outriggers, in particular, focused on culling any corrupted monsters in Anglepoint Bay, while also targeting eggs twisted by dark magic.\nIn one final attack, a colossal &lt;a href=\"kraken\"&gt;kraken&lt;/a&gt; known as &lt;a href=\"Viq%27Goth\"&gt;Viq'Goth&lt;/a&gt; directly assaulted the walls of Anglepoint's sea gate. Led by &lt;a href=\"Rosaline%20Madison\"&gt;Rosaline Madison&lt;/a&gt;, the Outriggers would man the harbor defenses and rain death down upon the sea terror. After a fierce battle, the kraken retreated, signaling victory for the defenders.\nWhen the Horde attacked Anglepoint Wharf with the intention of destroying the protective seagate with &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt; explosives, the Outriggers helped to defend the wharf until &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Admiral\"&gt;Lord Admiral&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; and the Alliance emissary arrived to finally drive the Horde forces off.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Dazar%27alor\"&gt;Battle of Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiran\"&gt;Kul Tiran&lt;/a&gt;s began construction of a unique flagship to be gifted to High King &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Tandred%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Tandred Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; himself would seek out the Outriggers at &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Admiral\"&gt;Lord Admiral&lt;/a&gt;'s vessel. Though initially reluctant, Rosaline Madison agreed to the offer, enticed by the idea of getting revenge on the Horde for the attack on Anglepoint. In the role of first mate, Rosaline would gather the other Outriggers and board the &lt;a href=\"Anduin%27s%20vessel\"&gt;new vessel&lt;/a&gt; for its maiden voyage from &lt;a href=\"Stormsong%20Valley\"&gt;Stormsong Valley&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;."}

The term is sometimes used pejoratively, describing where the previous content is steamrolled but does not include an improvement of tactics or avoidance, simply that a player cannot be harmed as easily.\nA major exception to this are scenarios where the players equipment is essentially meaningless, such as most vehicle fights, or were attacks by enemies have an effect by percentile amounts."}

Fortunately, Naralex and his &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; disciple &lt;a href=\"Muyoh\"&gt;Muyoh&lt;/a&gt; managed to seal off the Nightmare corruption thanks to the aid of brave &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s, and they believed the balance of nature would take hold here once again.\nAt some point after the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; attack on &lt;a href=\"Camp%20Taurajo\"&gt;Camp Taurajo&lt;/a&gt;, the tauren refugees built &lt;a href=\"Camp%20Una%27fe\"&gt;Camp Una'fe&lt;/a&gt; at the edge of the jungle, but the forest had since grown beyond it.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the animals at the Overgrowth were acting strangely due to the appearance of the &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Wailing%20Caverns\"&gt;Wailing Caverns&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the war, &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt; reported that while the mark of the Nightmare corruption remains, animals here will heal in time without the druids' help. It also seems that wandering adventurers stop by often.\nNightmare Scar digsite.\nA portion of the Overgrowth region is filled with broken ground and is a night elven &lt;a href=\"archaeology\"&gt;archaeology&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"dig%20site\"&gt;dig site&lt;/a&gt;."}

{"id": "48930", "revid": "22514", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=48930", "title": "Overhealing", "text": "Overhealing is the concept of &lt;a href=\"healing\"&gt;healing&lt;/a&gt; more than is required. For example, if a player has 3000 out of 5000 &lt;a href=\"health\"&gt;hit points&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"healer\"&gt;healer&lt;/a&gt; heals for 4000, that healer has overhealed for 2000, meaning that 50% of the amount healed was overhealing. Slight overhealing is always to be expected, usually ranging from 10-30% depending on the encounter and the spells used. Higher overhealing than that is generally undesirable, as the healer spent mana on healing that was not needed and which never actually restored health to the target, as it was already at full health. It is however worth noting that overhealing has no negative effects beyond the mana used and time spent, and if neither are scarce then overhealing has no real negative effects.\nOverhealing and tank healing.\nIn most high-end &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt; encounters, overhealing is standard practice on the &lt;a href=\"main%20tank\"&gt;main tank&lt;/a&gt;, as &lt;a href=\"reactive%20healing\"&gt;reactive healing&lt;/a&gt; is not enough - the only option is to be &lt;a href=\"Proactive%20Healing\"&gt;proactive&lt;/a&gt; and land heals all the time just in case they're needed. This tactic is generally of much less use in five man &lt;a href=\"instances\"&gt;instances&lt;/a&gt;, as the tanks in such situations generally have much lower &lt;a href=\"avoidance\"&gt;avoidance&lt;/a&gt;, higher health compared to how hard the bosses are hitting, and there will be no other healers healing the same tank.\nOne way to achieve proactive healing on a main tank while minimizing overhealing is to start casting a heal that could potentially overheal and then interrupt it by moving slightly, pressing escape, or using a /stopcasting &lt;a href=\"macro\"&gt;macro&lt;/a&gt; just before the spell lands if the tank is at full health when the spellcasting is almost completed.\nOverhealing and threat.\nHealing generates &lt;a href=\"threat\"&gt;threat&lt;/a&gt;. However, overhealing does not generate any threat for any amount that does not actually heal. In the above example, the healer sent 4000 points of heal, but only 2000 points of healing were actually 'absorbed' by the target. The extra 2000 points of healing do not generate any threat at all.\nThis is important. Overhealing a tank does \"not\" make the tank's life more difficult or threaten the healer with &lt;a href=\"aggro\"&gt;aggro&lt;/a&gt; above and beyond the given situation. No matter how much healing a healer lands on a tank, only healing that heals damage actually taken by the tank will generate threat, and that is health that would have to be healed up anyway if the tank is to survive. This means that the only real difference between a healer who constantly spams huge heals on the tank and one who heals just enough to keep the tank at full health is the amount of mana used.\nOverhealing and healing meters.\nThere are many &lt;a href=\"addons\"&gt;addons&lt;/a&gt; that can track the overhealing done by the healers in a group or raid. This can be a very useful tool for a healer, as it makes it easier to keep track of performance when trying to improve your healing techniques. Such statistics are not always useful or accurate, however, and there are however a number of factors that must be taken into account when evaluating them:"}

Illusion effigies can also be used to communicate across large distances, with the effigy taking on the form of the controlling arakkoa, and seemingly allowing them to see and hear from the location of the effigy.

By combining the effigy with relics of &lt;a href=\"Terokk%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Terokk&lt;/a&gt;, Iskar allows adventurers to relive the Talon King's greatest tales, and eventually is able to waken Terokk from his long slumber in shadows.\nThe same effigy was later used by Terokk in his battle against &lt;a href=\"Kargath%20Bladefist%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Kargath Bladefist&lt;/a&gt;, allowing a brave adventurer to take control of an avatar of the Talon King. When the avatar was defeated, Kargath pulled forth the adventurer themselves, but Shadow-Sage Iskar was able to retrieve them, with Kargath left holding only a crude effigy. \nThis instance appears to exceed the usual capabilities of the illusion effigies, and may have been possible only with the combined power of Terokk and Iskar."}

Illysanna briefly appeared in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, accompanying &lt;a href=\"Kayn%20Sunfury\"&gt;Kayn Sunfury&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nAs the daughter of &lt;a href=\"Kur%27talos%20Ravencrest\"&gt;Kur'talos Ravencrest&lt;/a&gt;, Illysanna enjoyed a position of power and privilege. She attended council meetings with sorcerers from the &lt;a href=\"Moon%20Guard\"&gt;Moon Guard&lt;/a&gt;, priestesses from the &lt;a href=\"Sisterhood%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Sisterhood of Elune&lt;/a&gt;, and other influential figures. She first met &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, with his brother &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; and their mutual friend &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; when the three came to &lt;a href=\"Black%20Rook%20Hold\"&gt;Black Rook Hold&lt;/a&gt;. She met the trio only briefly, and they did not leave any lasting impressions on her. Illidan, in particular, seemed like just one more sorcerer among the hundreds who had joined the resistance.\nUnlike her father Illysanna did not trust Illidan, especially when Kur'talos made him leader of the Moon Guard after the death of &lt;a href=\"Latosius\"&gt;Latosius&lt;/a&gt;, for Illidan had his mages channel their power into him to empower his own spells, which put the defenseless soldiers open to attack from the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. As time passed Illysanna noticed how Illidan's mood darkened and believed it had something to do with a change in the relationship between Illidan, Malfurion, and Tyrande. Whenever Illysanna brought up Illidan's mood to him, Illidan would try to change the subject or simply glare at her.\nAfter her father was assassinated on orders from Lord &lt;a href=\"Varo%27then\"&gt;Varo'then&lt;/a&gt;, Illysanna's hubris began to crumble away and she started to question everything and everyone. She searched for a way to strike back at the Legion and make them suffer as she had, and in doing so, realized that while Illidan was cold and arrogant, he was right in that fighting the demons meant making sacrifices. But in the wake of Kur'talos's death, Illidan had vanished, with rumors among the resistance saying he had died, and others saying he had betrayed them to the demons. But confident that he was still on their side and working in the shadows, Illysanna left to go find him and walk in his footsteps.\nIllysanna eventually became a &lt;a href=\"demon%20hunter\"&gt;demon hunter&lt;/a&gt; and was locked up in the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20the%20Wardens\"&gt;Vault of the Wardens&lt;/a&gt; in the aftermath of the War of the Ancients, and freed ten thousand years later, along with the &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt; who had been captured on &lt;a href=\"Mardum\"&gt;Mardum&lt;/a&gt;, by &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;. After escaping her prison, Illysanna assisted The Slayer in retrieving the &lt;a href=\"Twinblades%20of%20the%20Deceiver\"&gt;Twinblades of the Deceiver&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Varedis%20Felsoul\"&gt;Varedis Felsoul&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, she was shot down from the sky and was sacrificed on a Legion's altar. Later on, she returned and briefly appeared in the retaken \"&lt;a href=\"Fel%20Hammer\"&gt;Fel Hammer&lt;/a&gt;\" and later made her way to Black Rook Hold.

The nobles no longer have any illusion that they can avoid a fight. Elisande will not allow them to stand idly by while Suramar is overrun by &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Outlanders&lt;/a&gt;.\nI would not assume victory just yet, my friend.\nBe cautious, and be strong. I will see you soon.\n (appears after completing &lt;a href=\"Trial%20by%20Demonfire\"&gt;Trial by Demonfire&lt;/a&gt;)\nI do not have long.

The selflessness of the player's act - bringing the crystal to him despite the immense power it contained - led Haramad to decide to deliver the crystal to the naaru, rather than to Solannas (and thus to Kael'thas).

{"id": "12383", "revid": "39299307", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=12383", "title": "Wailing Caverns", "text": "The Wailing Caverns is in the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Barrens\"&gt;Northern Barrens&lt;/a&gt;, to the south of &lt;a href=\"Crossroads\"&gt;Crossroads&lt;/a&gt;, on the north side of the &lt;a href=\"Lushwater%20Oasis\"&gt;Lushwater Oasis&lt;/a&gt;. The Wailing Caverns is one of the first &lt;a href=\"instance\"&gt;instance&lt;/a&gt;d dungeons that lower-level &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; players encounter. One primary reason to venture into the Wailing Caverns is for &lt;a href=\"BoP\"&gt;BoP&lt;/a&gt; drops from the numerous bosses in the instance. Some of the quest rewards are also highly desirable. Even the &lt;a href=\"poor\"&gt;poor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"quality\"&gt;quality&lt;/a&gt; drops are better than ordinary; a stack of typical trash drops is worth around five to ten silver.\nHistory.\nThe Wailing Caverns are a network of underground caverns within the heart of the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt;. Its waterways carry underground rivers for miles beneath the savannah, and naturally bubbles to the surface as small oases throughout the Barrens. The caverns were discovered by the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Naralex\"&gt;Naralex&lt;/a&gt;, who named them after the mournful howls produced by the wind traveling through the caverns and the steam venting through small cracks in the rock. Naralex believed that if he connected the underground waters directly to the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;, he could spread growth across the Barrens and restore the region to its original lush state. He traveled into the caverns with his &lt;a href=\"Disciples%20of%20Naralex\"&gt;loyal disciples&lt;/a&gt; and settled into meditation, allowing the Dream to connect to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; through his body. However, he was unexpectedly overwhelmed by the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;. Unable to wake, the sleeping Naralex inadvertently channeled the Nightmare's energies into the caverns, corrupting the waters, the wildlife (which turned into &lt;a href=\"deviate%20creature\"&gt;deviate&lt;/a&gt; forms), and his disciples, most of whom went insane and became the &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Fang\"&gt;Druids of the Fang&lt;/a&gt;.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"Years ago, the famed druid Naralex and his followers descended into the shadowy Wailing Caverns, named for the mournful cry one hears when steam bursts from the cave system's fissures. Naralex planned to use the underground springs to restore lushness to the arid Barrens. But upon entering the Emerald Dream, he saw his vision of regrowth turn into a waking nightmare, one that has plagued the caverns ever since.\"\nWorld of Warcraft.\nAfter the group of druids became trapped and corrupted in the Wailing Caverns, the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; launched a rescue mission, cleansing the caves of the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; and saving several of the druids.\nLegion.\nCorruption continued to flourish in the Wailing Caverns since Naralex's awakening. Some deviate critters had survived, and they were now growing and multiplying in numbers. An adventurer went there to &lt;a href=\"%23Wailing%20Critters\"&gt;cleanse the caverns&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth and aftermath.\n&lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt;, the blood of Azeroth, flowed through the Wailing Caverns in tremendous quantities and was fought over by the Horde and Alliance. Due to the Azerite, the animals of the Overgrowth were acting strangely.\nAs powerful magic seeped through the Wailing Caverns that was transforming the Barrens, Alliance and Horde champions were sent into the Caverns in order to devise a way to leverage that magic. &lt;a href=\"Musu%20Gentlemoon\"&gt;Musu Gentlemoon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hannah%20Bridgewater\"&gt;Hannah Bridgewater&lt;/a&gt; were known participants.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Zekhan\"&gt;Zekhan&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the corruption of the Nightmare has remained in the Wailing Caverns since Naralex's rescue, and even the Horde and Alliance abandoned interests in the area's natural resources.\nDungeon denizens.\nBosses.\nThe following bosses are present in the Wailing Caverns:\nWalkthrough.\nThe part of the dungeon before entering the actual instance is filled with 14-17 &lt;a href=\"raptor\"&gt;raptor&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"wind%20serpent\"&gt;wind serpent&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"ooze\"&gt;ooze&lt;/a&gt;s. This part is easy, just follow the path till you get to the instance. The one pool on the path that you cannot walk around is a minor trap with two &lt;a href=\"threshadon\"&gt;threshadon&lt;/a&gt;s. If you are doing &lt;a href=\"Trouble%20at%20the%20Docks\"&gt;Trouble at the Docks&lt;/a&gt;, the NPC you are looking for, &lt;a href=\"Mad%20Magglish\"&gt;Mad Magglish&lt;/a&gt;, can be found in three different locations. He can be hard to find as he is invisible (when you get close to him he appears and attacks you). Upon entering the cavern you will come to the first intersection (T shaped) where you can go left toward the instance entrance or straight to a small drop off. The small nook to the right is the first location where Mad Magglish may be found. If you can't find him there, proceed down the left passage toward the instance entrance. You will come upon a second intersection where you can go straight (to the instance entrance), go left or go right path. Both the left and right passages lead to a dead-end. You may find Mad Magglish in either the left or right passage (his camping area or the blind alley). \nWhen you enter the instance take the quests in the entrance and then continue to follow the path killing all in your way until you reach a large cavern area - &lt;a href=\"Screaming%20Gully\"&gt;Screaming Gully&lt;/a&gt;. Be warned - the raptors will call for help when almost dead. In this room is one of the four &lt;a href=\"Fanglords\"&gt;Fanglords&lt;/a&gt;, named \"&lt;a href=\"Lady%20Anacondra\"&gt;Lady Anacondra&lt;/a&gt;\". Kill any mobs Lady Anacondra has with her, and then focus on her. Lady Anacondra often drops &lt;a href=\"Serpent%27s%20Shoulders\"&gt;Serpent's Shoulders&lt;/a&gt; and is near the entrance, and is well worth farming just for that item.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Druid%20of%20the%20Fang%20%28mob%29\"&gt;Druids of the Fang&lt;/a&gt; deserve a special mention, they'll engage first with lightning bolts, and then shapeshift into Cobras to engage in melee. When heavily damaged, they'll morph back to heal themselves. Each &lt;a href=\"Druid%20of%20the%20Fang\"&gt;Druid of the Fang&lt;/a&gt; is also capable of putting a party member to sleep. If you have a shaman, tell him/her to use a Tremor Totem whenever someone's asleep, and use &lt;a href=\"Wind%20Shear\"&gt;Wind Shear&lt;/a&gt; to disrupt a druid's initial lightning bolt to force them to charge. Also save a &lt;a href=\"kick\"&gt;kick&lt;/a&gt;, shock, or &lt;a href=\"counterspell\"&gt;counterspell&lt;/a&gt; for their final heal. The same technique can be used to fight each of the Leaders of the Fang. &lt;a href=\"Deviate%20Shambler\"&gt;Deviate Shambler&lt;/a&gt;s later can cast regeneration on themselves, purge utterly counters this.\nAfter Lady Anacondra, you can either go to the east or west along the river. Jump down into the water and head west. Somewhere along this river, you'll meet a &lt;a href=\"turtle\"&gt;turtle&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href=\"Kresh\"&gt;Kresh&lt;/a&gt;. He wanders around in the waters that run through the dungeon. Kresh is a non-aggressive turtle and no tougher than any of the normal elite mobs. He drops a really nice blue shield (&lt;a href=\"Kresh%27s%20Back\"&gt;Kresh's Back&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Worn%20Turtle%20Shell%20Shield\"&gt;Worn Turtle Shell Shield&lt;/a&gt;) or can be tamed by a hunter. Killing Kresh is not necessary to complete the instance, and you can ignore him. Climb the circuitous path up from Kresh's pool. Once you have traveled up the path you will find yourself in a big room filled with random monsters. Just follow the path and clear the monsters. Most of them are easy to kill, but be careful of additional monsters who wander around. After defeating the monsters you will find &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Cobrahn\"&gt;Lord Cobrahn&lt;/a&gt;, another one of the four Fanglords. Lord Cobrahn may drop &lt;a href=\"Robe%20of%20the%20Moccasin\"&gt;Robe of the Moccasin&lt;/a&gt;. In the same area you will find &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Pythas\"&gt;Lord Pythas&lt;/a&gt;, another one of the 4 Fanglords. Pythas is the toughest of the Leaders of the Fang. He puts out a lot of melee damage, and he has a lot of hitpoints. \nJump off the cliff, you'll return to the main room and go east. The &lt;a href=\"Deviate%20Faerie%20Dragon\"&gt;Deviate Faerie Dragon&lt;/a&gt; is a rare mob you may encounter in this area. Not difficult, drops nice caster gear, but appears rarely. Odds are good that you will never see him unless you enter the instance repeatedly to hunt for him. The next (optional) boss along the path is \"&lt;a href=\"Skum\"&gt;Skum&lt;/a&gt;\", a big old &lt;a href=\"thunder%20lizard\"&gt;thunder lizard&lt;/a&gt;. Skum generally won't cause you any serious problems himself, but in addition to the two druids guarding his pen, there are usually a number of other druids, dreadfangs, and oozes nearby, which you may want to remove before killing Skum himself. Skum drops a semi-good dagger, &lt;a href=\"Tail%20Spike\"&gt;Tail Spike&lt;/a&gt;, or a high agility cape, &lt;a href=\"Glowing%20Lizardscale%20Cloak\"&gt;Glowing Lizardscale Cloak&lt;/a&gt; so if you have any &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt;s or hunters you may as well drop him. Eventually you will find a big room with \"&lt;a href=\"Verdan%20the%20Everliving\"&gt;Verdan the Everliving&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Lord%20Serpentis\"&gt;Lord Serpentis&lt;/a&gt;\". Serpentis is a very standard melee fighter for the most part, with less hit points than Pythas. Kill any of the random mobs around Serpentis first, don't let him get past your tank(s), and don't get near and aggro Verdan the Everliving, and you should be fine. &lt;a href=\"Verdan%20the%20Everliving\"&gt;Verdan the Everliving&lt;/a&gt; on the other hand is a very different story. Killing Verdan is optional, he is not the object of any quest. \nAfter you've killed all four Leaders of the Fang, go back to the entrance and speak with the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; druid &lt;a href=\"Muyoh\"&gt;Muyoh&lt;/a&gt; to start the Naralex event. You'll have to escort the Muyoh through a path of mobs to wake up Naralex. Even if you cleared the path, there are two set points along his path at which mobs will spawn; dispatch them when they appear. None of these are particularly difficult. When you reach Naralex, Muyoh will begin to wake him. You must continue to protect the Disciple while he wakes Naralex. A few waves of mobs spawn, serpents, then slimes, that can be easily dispatched. You get enough time to eat and drink between waves of mobs, if everyone stays on the island and deals with the current wave quickly enough. The last spawn is the boss &lt;a href=\"Mutanus%20the%20Devourer\"&gt;Mutanus the Devourer&lt;/a&gt;, a huge &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt;. You won't have a long rest before him, Mutanus comes up rather quickly, but you should be able to get everyone's health and mana restored. Mutanus can be tough depending on who you have in your party.\nLoot.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Deviate%20Hatchling\"&gt;Deviate Hatchling&lt;/a&gt; is a very rare drop from the &lt;a href=\"Deviate%20Ravager\"&gt;Deviate Ravager&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Deviate%20Guardian\"&gt;Deviate Guardian&lt;/a&gt; raptors inside the Wailing Caverns.\nWailing Critters.\nStarting with &lt;a href=\"patch%207.2.0\"&gt;patch 7.2.0&lt;/a&gt;, the Wailing Caverns are also home to a special solo &lt;a href=\"scenario\"&gt;scenario&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Pet%20Battle%20System\"&gt;Pet Battle System&lt;/a&gt; called Wailing Critters."}
