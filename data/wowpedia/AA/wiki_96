Nests can be found near settlements and along roads. Bane spiders carefully cover up corpses for later feeding, which also hides them from potential victims.\nBane spiders swarm quickly over a victim, biting and then retreating behind cover. They are attracted to holy characters such as &lt;a href=\"paladins\"&gt;paladins&lt;/a&gt;, preferring to attack them first. This attraction is related to their unholy power, as the spiders show no real awareness beyond this one expression of intent.\nBane spiders can regenerate their health due to the power of undeath within them, although damage from blessed weapons or attacks based on holy energy does not regenerate. Bane spiders are not truly undead, yet the power that flows through them renders them vulnerable to all spells and effects that \"target undead\", as well as those that \"target vermin\"."}

If you place items in one bank, you will be able to access them in another. (Canonically, this is accomplished through the use of Automated Teleportation Modules; ATM's for short.) However, players are not able to use the banks of opposing factions, because they cannot talk to the tellers.\nBank space.\nInitially a character's bank account (vault storage space) contains 28 item storage slots at no cost. An additional seven &lt;a href=\"bag%20slot\"&gt;bag slot&lt;/a&gt;s for more space are purchasable. These provide no additional item storage slots, but allow placement of a &lt;a href=\"bag\"&gt;bag&lt;/a&gt; that has item storage capacity. The bags can be changed out and it is common practice to progressively place larger bags. The cost of the bag slots increases with each extra slot purchased starting at , (then increasing to , , , , , , for a total of for all slots (not including the bags that go into them).\nPlayers can craft using materials currently stored in the bank, from anywhere in the world, without needing to retrieve the items first.\nUnlike a real bank, you cannot store currency within the bank, only items.\nReagent Bank.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Reagent%20Bank\"&gt;Reagent Bank&lt;/a&gt; is a 98-slot bank tab which stores only &lt;a href=\"crafting%20reagent\"&gt;crafting reagent&lt;/a&gt;s.

After being freed from the grasp of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, many banshees joined the ranks of the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;, once led by the \"Banshee Queen\" &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe male counterpart of the banshee is the &lt;a href=\"spectre\"&gt;spectre&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nBanshees were once beautiful female &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; who were brutally murdered by &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;fall of Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. Their restless spirits were left to wander the world for many ages in silent, tortured lamentation. Over the years they became jealous of the living and seeded a deep hatred for all life. Yet when the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;, became aware of them, he gathered them together and promised them vengeance upon the living. Ner'zhul gave them terrible voices so that the living would finally hear their timeless anguish. Thus, the banshees pledged themselves to the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; cause and began serving as valuable warriors in the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;.\nA large amount of &lt;a href=\"high%20elf\"&gt;high elf&lt;/a&gt; banshees were raised by the Scourge during &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;'s conquest of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;. The most notable of these victims of the undead was the &lt;a href=\"Ranger-General%20of%20Silvermoon\"&gt;Ranger-General of Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, who was killed and raised by Arthas himself, though she later managed to reclaim her physical body. When the Lich King's grasp of the Scourge began to weaken some time after the war's end, Sylvanas and several of her undead servants broke free from the Scourge and eventually managed to establish the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nThe spectral banshees can fly and are fond of hammering their enemies with tortured blasts of sonic force. Their unnerving, unholy screams can be heard from miles away.\nIn Warcraft III.\nCreep units &lt;a href=\"Ghost%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Ghost&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wraith%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Wraith&lt;/a&gt; are also banshees.\nIn the RPG.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"kaldorei\"&gt;kaldorei&lt;/a&gt; clashed in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, 10,000 years ago, many &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; women fell. Their brutal murders returned them as banshees, and for millennia they wandered the world in lamentation, losing ever more of their dwindling sanity. Eventually, the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;, learned of their existence and recruited them into the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. Banshees fought in the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; alongside other undead, and when &lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; attacked &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, he found that he could make banshees of &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; as well. After the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the Lich King lost control of some of the banshees, including their queen &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;. Not long after Arthas raised her as a banshee, she broke from his control, taking fellow banshees with her. She regained her physical body and established the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;. This act gives many banshees hope, and a strong cadre of free banshees can now be seen serving with the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;. Most banshees still remain enslaved to the Lich King's will though, and can be found throughout the &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands\"&gt;Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;. Many wild, unaffiliated banshees exist.\nAlthough uncommon, according to \"&lt;a href=\"Manual%20of%20Monsters\"&gt;Manual of Monsters&lt;/a&gt;\", it appears that it is possible for human women, and even men from other races, to become banshees upon their undeath.\n\"Banshee\" is an acquired template in the \"&lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20RPG\"&gt;Warcraft RPG&lt;/a&gt;\".\nInspiration.\nThe is a female spirit in Irish mythology, usually seen as an omen of death and a messenger from another world. They are believed to herald the imminent death of a person with loud shrieks and wails."}

Their restless spirits were left to wander the world for many ages in silent, tortured lamentation. Over the years they became jealous of the living and seeded a deep hatred for all life. Yet when the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;, became aware of them, he gathered them together and promised them vengeance upon the living.

Thus, the Banshees have pledged themselves to the &lt;a href=\"Undead\"&gt;Undead&lt;/a&gt; cause and serve as valuable warriors in the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. The spectral Banshees can fly and are fond of hammering their enemies with tortured blasts of sonic force. Their unnerving, unholy screams can be heard from miles away.\nInformation.\nBanshees are very good at supporting units, coming with their initial spell of Curse and can later learn Anti-Magic Shell and Possession. They're still fairly weak like &lt;a href=\"Necromancer%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt;s and need protection. Banshees are the bane of any army that is heavily invested into ground units, as they can steal them and turn them against their owner if given the chance.\nSpells and abilities.\nurse (Autocast).\nThis is a very useful spell in intense battles as this makes units more likely to miss, which stacks up when their attack speed is boosted. Curse is automatically set to cast on enemies, but disable it so she does not waste mana on insignificant skirmishes.\nDispel, or use &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Breaker%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Spell Breaker&lt;/a&gt;s to remove the curse and transfer it to an enemy unit.\nAti-magic Shell.\nNotes: The shell takes damage, before it is modified by armor rating or armor types.\nThis protects a unit from spell damage that could otherwise kill them, such as the &lt;a href=\"Mountain%20King%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Mountain King&lt;/a&gt;'s Storm Bolt or &lt;a href=\"Warden%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Warden&lt;/a&gt;'s Shadow Strike. \nDispel the anti-magic shell.\nPssession.\nNotes: The Banshee takes 166% damage while possessing a unit.\nThis spell is highly effective in taking over enemy ground armies by robbing them of their own units. When a Banshee possesses a unit, your food value can change. A Banshee costs 2 food; if she possesses a &lt;a href=\"Tauren%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Tauren&lt;/a&gt;, then the player's food would rise 3 slots because a Tauren costs 5 food. Note that this can cause you to rise to Low or High Upkeep and may also prevent training further units or reviving a slain Hero if it goes over your food cap.\nThey can be used as an alternative to a &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Ranger%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Dark Ranger&lt;/a&gt; if a player wishes to access the tech trees of other races, but the only disadvantage they have over her is that a Banshee cannot be used to possess an aerial unit.\nWhile attempting to possess a unit, both the Banshee and the targeted unit will be frozen in place. A white orb will also appear over the Banshee indicating a possession attempt.\nPossession is channeled spell, and thus can be interrupted as with any other channeled spell. The Banshee is not invulnerable when she attempts to case Possession, so killing her before she possesses her target will also work. Aerial units or units possessing spell resistance/immunity can also work. \nUpgrades.\nAny items in the inventory will be dropped upon successful Possession."}

{"id": "649126", "revid": "46586549", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=649126", "title": "Banshee loyalists", "text": "The Banshee loyalists are &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; members who sided with &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; during the last stages of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, fighting against &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;'s rebels. After the Horde was reunited, they were given a chance to rejoin with the rest of the Horde by renouncing Sylvanas. Ultimately though, a number of them remained loyal to the Banshee Queen and left the Horde for good.\nHistory.\nBattle at the Gates of Orgrimmar.\nAfter Saurfang's revolutionaries and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; established themselves in &lt;a href=\"Razor%20Hill\"&gt;Razor Hill&lt;/a&gt;, Sylvanas ordered her forces to collapse the canyon between Razor Hill and &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;. Knowing that this was only a temporary measure, Sylvanas ordered &lt;a href=\"Overlord%20Geya%27rah\"&gt;Overlord Geya'rah&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jastor%20Gallywix\"&gt;Jastor Gallywix&lt;/a&gt;, the only two leaders of the Horde to side with her, to prepare for battle. While Geya'rah remarked that the Mag'har always stood ready to destroy their enemies, Gallywix revealed that the mechs were good to go but remarked that they weren't cheap and that Sylvanas better be ready to pay on delivery. Sylvanas and &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller\"&gt;Nathanos&lt;/a&gt; also sought to secure Orgrimmar from internal dissident by arresting &lt;a href=\"Eitrigg\"&gt;Eitrigg&lt;/a&gt; and burning the propaganda that dissidents within the city had been spreading.\nSeeking to weaken their enemies, Nathanos ordered the loyalists to sabotage the enemy siege weapons, however, Saurfang had anticipated this and ordered his revolutionaries to deal with Sylvanas's &lt;a href=\"Spy\"&gt;spies&lt;/a&gt; and protect their siege weapons. At the same time, Nathanos sought to strengthen the loyalists' army by rallying the citizens of Orgrimmar to their cause.\nThough the loyalists were prepared to fight Saurfang's revolutionaries and the Alliance, the battle would never come. Instead, Varok Saurfang, recognizing the loyalists as his fellow brothers and sisters in the Horde, challenged Sylvanas to &lt;a href=\"mak%27gora\"&gt;mak'gora&lt;/a&gt;. When Sylvanas questioned why she should accept his challenge, Saurfang merely pointed out that she wanted him to suffer, causing Sylvanas to wordlessly agree. While Sylvanas armed herself, Saurfang was granted &lt;a href=\"Dra%27gora\"&gt;Dra'gora&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shalamayne\"&gt;Shalamayne&lt;/a&gt; by Anduin. Sylvanas initially had the upper hand against Saurfang, however, when she began to mock him about hope, Saurfang got his second wind by declaring that Sylvanas couldn't kill hope. As Saurfang turned the tide against Sylvanas he claimed that she had failed to kill hope at &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;, failed in getting the Horde and Alliance to keep killing each other, and further declared that the Horde would endure, as it was strong. Varok then managed to slash Sylvanas across her eye. This turn caused an enraged Sylvanas to declare that the Horde was nothing, that they were all nothing. Sylvanas then killed Saurfang quickly with a blast of unknown magic, and abandoned the Horde altogether.\nAftermath of the battle.\nIn the wake of Sylvanas's betrayal, most of her loyalists bent the knee to the revolutionaries, though they were viewed in a poor light by some members of the Horde. However, people like &lt;a href=\"Gazlowe\"&gt;Gazlowe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"First%20Arcanist%20Thalyssra\"&gt;First Arcanist Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; would defend them, stating that they were now loyal to the Horde, and if they asked for forgiveness, it should be given, as the Horde needed to be united now more than ever. Those &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20Loyalist\"&gt;who refused&lt;/a&gt; to renounce her were bound in chains, while others were faking their disgust with Sylvanas, and some were exiled. At the same time other loyalists, like &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller\"&gt;Nathanos Blightcaller&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Ranger%20Lenara\"&gt;Dark Ranger Lenara&lt;/a&gt;, would successfully evade the Horde and reunite with Sylvanas. In time, &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;loyalists adventurers&lt;/a&gt; joined them, at which point Nathanos departed, and Sylvanas spoke privately with them. Declaring that , Sylvanas revealed that even though Saurfang's challenge ended the war, it was largely meaningless as countless souls had been fed to the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;hungering darkness&lt;/a&gt;. She mentioned that though she cared nothing for the living, she did pity the Forsaken and abandoned them because they clung to hope. Revealing that she had struck a bargain with &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt;, Sylvanas remarked that the armies of Azeroth would fight &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;her master&lt;/a&gt;, who would line the streets with corpses and, in the end, he too would serve Death. Her reflection finished, Sylvanas remarked that nothing lasts and that the loyalists will understand when they see each other next.\nShadows Rising.\nHorde agents discovered two loyalists on a ridge in the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Barrens\"&gt;Northern Barrens&lt;/a&gt;, and after alerting a patrol in the area, they were able to track and capture them. However, the spies had swallowed some foul concoction and died before they could be questioned. Though their purpose could not be discovered, the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Council\"&gt;Horde Council&lt;/a&gt; celebrated their passing as it meant Sylvanas no longer had eyes in &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile working in the shadows, as both the Horde and Alliance race to uncover their next move, Sylvanas tasked Nathanos Blightcaller and &lt;a href=\"Sira%20Moonwarden\"&gt;Sira Moonwarden&lt;/a&gt; with a terrifying gambit: to kill the troll &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt; himself, &lt;a href=\"Bwonsamdi\"&gt;Bwonsamdi&lt;/a&gt;. To that end, they allied with the &lt;a href=\"Widow%27s%20Bite\"&gt;Widow's Bite&lt;/a&gt;, a group of &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; rebels led by a &lt;a href=\"Witch%20%28disambiguation%29\"&gt;witch&lt;/a&gt; known as &lt;a href=\"Apari\"&gt;Apari&lt;/a&gt;. In order to weaken the protections around Bwonsamdi's shrines, Nathanos was forced to hand over something precious and irreplaceable to the witch. Thus, after a moment, he handed his officer's badge given to him by Sylvanas when they were among the living, and warned Apari that if she failed to destroy the loa's shrines as promised, then the consequences would be severe.\nWith this accord, the Widow's Bite and the Banshee loyalists fought side by side and finally clashed with the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Empire\"&gt;Zandalari Empire&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Nazmir\"&gt;Nazmir&lt;/a&gt;, where they were discovered attempting to sacrifice children in order to weaken one of Bwonsamdi's shrines. Thanks to the courage of &lt;a href=\"Zekhan\"&gt;Zekhan&lt;/a&gt;, the children were saved, and due to their smaller amount of numbers, the loyalists and their new allies fell back. In light of their alliance, Sira revealed that Lelyias was a skilled healer who could help her with her leg injuries, however, Apari refused. This vexed Sira who noted that the Widow's Bite were loyal to Apari, that they would fall apart without her leaving the loyalists with no reinforcements, and more importantly, to Sira, was they needed the witch to survive until the loa Bwonsamdi was killed.\nAfter successfully weakening several of his shrines, Nathanos and Apari gave the order for their forces to strike at the loa's &lt;a href=\"Necropolis%20%28Nazmir%29\"&gt;Necropolis&lt;/a&gt; for the final assault on Bwonsamdi. Prior to the battle against the loa &lt;a href=\"Tayo\"&gt;Tayo&lt;/a&gt;, a Widow's Bite member, outraged, and being disgusted with Apari's actions in harming children had decided to defect to the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, ultimately aiding them by revealing the traps Nathanos had set up. With the traps disabled, the Horde clashed against them with greater numbers. During the conflict, Apari was killed and, proving Sira's fears true, the Widow's Bite collapsed leaving the Banshee loyalists to stand on their own against the Horde. While many of the dark rangers on the battlefield would be slain, Sira was captured and taken prisoner, and Nathanos narrowly escaped the battlefield knowing that he had failed his mission.\nShadowlands.\nAt some point, Sylvanas personally journeyed to &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt; where she fought against the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. After winning the battle, she took the &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Helm of Domination&lt;/a&gt; from him and shattered it, thereby piercing the veil between Azeroth and the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;. She was soon approached by Nathanos, who informed her of the failure to kill &lt;a href=\"Bwonsamdi\"&gt;Bwonsamdi&lt;/a&gt;. While acknowledging that it was a blow to her plans, Sylvanas was confident that it was a setback that they could overcome. After learning that Blightcaller was going back to the &lt;a href=\"Marris%20Stead\"&gt;Marris Stead&lt;/a&gt; to await further orders, Sylvanas told him to not remain idly, and that she expected him to return to her with a means to prevent Bwonsamdi's meddling with their plans.\nIn time, the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; discovered Nathanos at his home, and they alerted the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; causing &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; to send &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt; to deal with him. In the subsequent confrontation, Nathanos met his end at his own home, with &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; dealing the final blow.\nSylvanas herself was eventually confronted within the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Sanctum of Domination&lt;/a&gt;, where she was able to successfully ensure that the Jailer was able to claim the &lt;a href=\"Arbiter\"&gt;Arbiter&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"sigil\"&gt;sigil&lt;/a&gt;. However, &lt;a href=\"Zovaal\"&gt;Zovaal&lt;/a&gt; then revealed that his goal wasn't to break the system of Death and give everyone free will, as Sylvanas thought, but to forge a new reality where all would be forced to serve him. Realizing that she herself was included in that statement, Sylvanas declared \"I will never 'serve'\" and fired a black arrow at the Jailer in defiance. The Jailer easily deflected it before reuniting Sylvanas with her soul fragment that was once stolen by &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt; and leaving her to be captured by the Maw Walker and her allies, who subsequently placed the Banshee Queen in the custody of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter being given the chance to make amends for her sins, Sylvanas joined the fight against the Jailer, where she personally aided in freeing Anduin from his control. Following Zovaal's death, Sylvanas submitted to the judgment of Tyrande Whisperwind, who sentenced her to scour the Maw and liberate every soul within its dark depths. However, before entering the Maw to begin her penance, Sylvanas shared some final words with adventures who remained loyal to her throughout the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, she acknowledged their commitment, even when she felt that her own actions did not merit such dedication. Admitting that she wasn't sure what fate awaited her, she revealed that if she ever felt the need for trusted allies, they knew that she could call upon them. With her final words shared, Sylvanas entered the Maw to begin her penance.\nIt is unknown what effect, if any, these events could have on the Banshee loyalists. However, as the Forsaken returned to &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt; and started rebuilding &lt;a href=\"Brill\"&gt;Brill&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Ranger%20Lenara\"&gt;Dark Ranger Lenara&lt;/a&gt; was among them. It is unknown if Lenara discarded the Banshee loyalists or if the Banshee loyalists as a whole rejoined the Horde.\nDragonflight.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; defeated the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Fenris%20Isle\"&gt;Fenris Isle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dori%27thur\"&gt;Dori'thur&lt;/a&gt; carried a message from Sylvanas, who was still within the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt;, to her Horde adventurer loyalists. In this message, the Dark Lady admitted regret for her past actions and realized her days of leadership were over and considered the newly-formed &lt;a href=\"Desolate%20Council\"&gt;Desolate Council&lt;/a&gt; to be the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;'s rightful leaders and future. Before she left, she reminded the adventurer to be in allegiance to the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, considering all of them \"more than arrows in her quiver\" and hoping to one day walk among them again. She then explained that there were many souls yet to be freed, including &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller\"&gt;one that was most dear to her&lt;/a&gt;."}

It was the &lt;a href=\"second%20invasion\"&gt;second invasion&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. During the war, the ancient &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; were reintroduced to the world.\nThe events of the war were chronicled in \"\".\nPrelude.\nAfter their defeat in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; was captured by &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; for his failure. As punishment, the Deceiver destroyed Ner'zhuls body, and tortured his spirit until he agreed to serve the Legion once again. His soul encased in a suit of armor which was then bound to the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt;, Kil'jaeden hurled his creation towards &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; where it smashed into &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Glacier\"&gt;Icecrown Glacier&lt;/a&gt;. Thus the first major player of the Third War, the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; was born. Once on Azeroth, the Lich King took control of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; and he had the &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; take the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;Plague of Undeath&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;.\nBefore the start of the war, the prophet &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt; came to the young orcish Warchief &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; in a dream. Medivh told him that he must rally the newly-reformed shamanistic Horde and move them across the sea to &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; in order to escape the shadow that was coming to consume the land. Trusting the prophet's words, and wishing to find a new home for his people, Thrall listened to his call, fought his way through Lordaeron's troops and sailed west.\nScourge of Lordaeron.\nThe following events started during the month of October.\nDisturbance in the north.\nA rumor had started to travel around Lordaeron telling how a mysterious plague had gripped the northern lands, as the majority of Lordaeron's attention was focused on the Horde's flight and rebelling orc clans. When Medivh appeared before King &lt;a href=\"Terenas\"&gt;Terenas&lt;/a&gt; telling him just as he told Thrall: to save his people, he must travel west, Terenas told him that he would defend his kingdom. To do so, he sent his own son &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;, who was dealing with the rebelling orcs with Sir &lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther the Lightbringer&lt;/a&gt; north to investigate. &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; was sent from Dalaran to aid in the investigation.\nCult of the Damned.\nAfter joining &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, Prince Arthas discovered that &lt;a href=\"Andorhal\"&gt;Andorhal&lt;/a&gt;'s granaries were wrought with a plague that killed all who are infected (within a period of time) after they had encountered &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; in the town of &lt;a href=\"Brill\"&gt;Brill&lt;/a&gt;. Since &lt;a href=\"Andorhal\"&gt;Andorhal&lt;/a&gt; was the main distribution point for grain in the area, this meant that many other towns were in danger. As they fought their way through the infected city of &lt;a href=\"Andorhal\"&gt;Andorhal&lt;/a&gt; they bore witness to a unique devastation like &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; had never seen. They hunted down and attacked Kel'Thuzad for his crimes against the people. The necromancer told Arthas that he served a greater power, a dreadlord named &lt;a href=\"Mal%27Ganis\"&gt;Mal'Ganis&lt;/a&gt;, and that he was responsible for the Scourge. Enraged, Arthas vowed he would kill Mal'Ganis and they traveled to &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt; to confront him after slaying the corrupted wizard.\nRise of the Scourge.\nWhile in &lt;a href=\"Hearthglen\"&gt;Hearthglen&lt;/a&gt;, Arthas and Jaina's forces were attacked by legions of &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;. Arthas had Jaina search for Uther while he and his forces remained to protect the town from the Scourge. It was then he learned the truth behind the plague. The plague didn't just kill those infected, it turned them into the undead, and thus, the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. Before his army was defeated, Uther and his knights arrived and saved the town. Not long after this battle, Arthas was met by Medivh, who warned the prince to travel west to &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. Like his father, Arthas refused, saying his place was with his people. Jaina believed the prophet's words but Arthas would not be swayed to leave his kingdom. They continued to &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt; to deal with the threat of the Scourge.\nCulling of Stratholme.\nUpon arriving at &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;, they discovered that the grain had already been distributed amongst the townsfolk. Arthas, not wanting to deal with an entire army of undead, ordered Uther and his &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s to destroy the town. Uther was appalled by this, saying he wouldn't follow the order even if Arthas was the king. For his defiance, Arthas disbanded the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; and called all those still loyal to Lordaeron to come with him. Uther took his followers and left, and Jaina quickly followed. Abandoned by his teacher and friend, Arthas continued to Stratholme to slaughter the town.\nUpon arrival, Arthas met Mal'Ganis himself. The two had a race of sorts for the lives of the town. Arthas wished to destroy them, Mal'Ganis wished to corrupt them. When the town was in ruin, Arthas demanded a final showdown with Mal'Ganis. Mal'Ganis, however, slipped away, vowing to meet him in Northrend.\nAfter the Culling, Jaina and Uther returned to Stratholme to bury the dead. Jaina was met by Medivh, who told her Arthas would only die if he went to Northrend. The prophet then told Jaina, as he had told everyone else, that she must travel west to Kalimdor, a request she answered to.\nAfter Stratholme was purged, some former paladins, now called &lt;a href=\"Deathlord%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Deathlords&lt;/a&gt;, committed the same heinous act in many other cities across Lordaeron.\nRise of the death knight.\nAfter arriving in Northrend, Arthas discovered the brother of the dwarven king &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin&lt;/a&gt;. Upon arriving at Northrend, Muradin's expedition was attacked by the undead and was cut off from the rest of the world. He had come to Northrend to obtain the runeblade &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt;. The two armies then established a new camp and fought together against the undead, famished and vicious packs of &lt;a href=\"Wolf\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt;, strange beings that seemed to be &lt;a href=\"Wolvar\"&gt;part wolverine and part human&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href=\"ice%20troll\"&gt;ice troll&lt;/a&gt;s.\nWhen word from Lordaeron called Arthas's men back home, the prince used mercenaries to burn their ships before turning his forces on the mercenaries. With no way to get home, he told his men that their only way home was to get the Frostmourne. When he finally found the blade, he and Muradin learned that the blade was cursed. Arthas accepted this curse and took the blade, though Muradin was believed to be killed in the process (he was knocked out with terrible amnesia). With the Frostmourne, Arthas lead an assault on the Scourge base where Mal'Ganis was stationed and killed the dreadlord. With the cause of his madness dead, Arthas fled to the wilderness of Northrend leaving his men to fend for themselves. \nMonths later, Arthas returned to Lordaeron to get his just rewards. When he greeted Terenas, he took up the cursed sword and, without a moment of consideration, slew his father. Arthas then named himself King of Lordaeron and gave the land to the Scourge. Weeks later, Arthas, now a &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt; under the orders of the Lich King, was given the task to bring the dead necromancer Kel'Thuzad back from the dead. To do so, Arthas had to take his remains to a place of magical power. Arthas fought and killed his former mentor Uther for the urn he was carrying. The urn carried the ashes of his father, which Arthas disposed of and placed Kel'Thuzad's remains inside. The only magical nexus with the necessary power was the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt; deep inside &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;, the capital of the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt;. To revive Kel'Thuzad, the Scourge would have to burn &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;.\nFall of Quel'Thalas.\nUpon reaching the borders of Quel'Thalas, the Ranger-General &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; became a quick thorn in the death knight's plan. Despite the mighty elf gates, the destruction of an important bridge, and many well-trained rangers, the Scourge plowed their way through Quel'Thalas' defenses on their way to &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;, and from there the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Isle of Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt; and the Sunwell. Before Sylvanas could warn Silvermoon of the Scourge invasion, her camp was raided and she was taken prisoner. Arthas tortured her and, rather than give her the peace of death, he used his power to turn her into the first &lt;a href=\"banshee\"&gt;banshee&lt;/a&gt;, making her a slave to the Scourge. With its defenses destroyed, the Scourge entered Silvermoon and slaughtered all the high elves in the city. When Arthas reached the Sunwell, he placed Kel'Thuzad's remains in the enchanted waters, thus turning him into a &lt;a href=\"lich\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt; and corrupting the Sunwell. With his business in the area done, Arthas had the Scourge kill the remaining high elves of Quel'Thalas.\nThe Defiler.\nWith Kel'Thuzad revived, they had to do their job for the dreadlords. Upon eradicating the remnants of the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock clan&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, the Scourge traveled south to &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; to obtain the &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Medivh\"&gt;Book of Medivh&lt;/a&gt; and use it to summon &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; himself to Azeroth. The Kirin Tor used their most powerful magics but failed to prevent the Scourge from stealing the spellbook. With the book, Kel'Thuzad summoned Archimonde and the Burning Legion to Azeroth. Archimonde's first order of business when entering the world was to destroy Dalaran with his great power. From this point and for the rest of the war, Archimonde, the field commander of the Legion, led the invasion of Azeroth himself and planned to take control of the second &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity%20%28Hyjal%29\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; under the &lt;a href=\"World%20Tree\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt;.\nFlight to Kalimdor.\nRight after the fall of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, Jaina Proudmoore brought the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Human%20Expedition\"&gt;remnants&lt;/a&gt; with her to Kalimdor following Medivh's request.\nHaving fled the Eastern Kingdoms, the Horde was scattered while sailing past the &lt;a href=\"Maelstrom\"&gt;Maelstrom&lt;/a&gt;. Some of the ships landed in a chain of islands near the Maelstrom where they met the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear tribe&lt;/a&gt;. Here the orcs aided the trolls, then led them on an escape to Kalimdor.\nIn Kalimdor, &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grommash Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, chieftain of the prominent Warsong clan, had landed with his clan. Before they could regroup with Thrall, they ran into Jaina's soldiers and battles soon began.\nWhen the rest of the Horde reached and regrouped on Kalimdor, Grom directly defied Thrall's orders by attacking Jaina Proudmoore's encampment after giving in to his instinctual bloodlust. As a punishment he was sent further into the massive &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt; Forest where he would collect lumber to build a base for the orcs.\nMeanwhile, Thrall began his search for the rest of the Horde, and eventually came across the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt;, and their leader &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;. After helping Cairne repel invading &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt;s, Cairne told Thrall of an oracle up in the Stonetalon Mountains who could aid the Horde in their journey.\nUpon reaching the Stonetalon Mountains, Thrall and Jaina met the prophet who called doom long before the Scourge of Lordaeron, Medivh. Medivh asked that the Horde and the Alliance work together, forgetting their old hatreds to battle a new, more powerful enemy.\nMannoroth.\nGrom Hellscream and his clan started collecting lumber as they had been ordered to. However, by doing so, they enraged the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;. After battling the night elves, their demigod &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt; stepped in personally to deal with the Warsong clan. \nAfter fighting a lost battle, the orcs realized that they couldn't kill Cenarius by conventional means. Cenarius saw the orcs as demon spawn and therefore only their total eradication would satisfy him. To defeat them, Grom and the followers drank from a mysterious fountain that empowered them, not knowing that it had been defiled by the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20of%20Mannoroth\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"pit%20lord\"&gt;pit lord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt;. Energized and turned into &lt;a href=\"fel%20orc\"&gt;fel orc&lt;/a&gt;s, the Warsong successfully attacked and killed Cenarius. With the orcs once again doing the bidding of the Burning Legion, Mannoroth stormed up to Grom and revealed it was his blood that empowered the orcs. Despite their victory, they were once again under demon control, and thus the control of the Burning Legion.\nTo help their new allies, Jaina created a magical &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Gem%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;soul gem&lt;/a&gt;. Thrall would need to capture the mighty Grom within it, and take the gem to a prepared magical circle to free his spirit of corruption. Standing between the humans and free orcs, however, was the entire &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20clan\"&gt;Warsong clan&lt;/a&gt;, fortified with scores of demons that waited in ambush and mighty &lt;a href=\"infernal\"&gt;infernal&lt;/a&gt;s that rained from the sky. Despite his woes of killing many of the Warsong clan, Thrall captured Grom and brought him back for a ritual of cleansing. Along with Thrall's &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;s, Jaina, and Jaina's best &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"sorcerer\"&gt;sorcerer&lt;/a&gt;s, they managed to pull the demonic taint out of Grom. Thrall and Grom then challenged Mannoroth, and though Thrall was defeated, Grom managed to deliver a killing blow, destroying Mannoroth and freeing the orcs at the cost of his own life. Thus Grom redeemed himself for bringing them into the Legion.\nWith the deaths of Cenarius and Mannoroth, Archimonde launched the invasion on Kalimdor, coming from the southeastern point of &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt; into Ashenvale.\nReturn of the night elves.\nWhen it became evident that the Burning Legion had returned, &lt;a href=\"Tyrande\"&gt;Tyrande&lt;/a&gt; led her Sentinels into the trees, fleeing a wave of undead which had destroyed a human and orc camp. As they fled, they were cornered by dreadlords and Archimonde. Tyrande believed that with the Defilers' return the only way to defeat the Burning Legion was to use the forces of old, the sleeping &lt;a href=\"druids\"&gt;druids&lt;/a&gt; and their leader, &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, her old love. After waking Malfurion, the next order of business was to awaken the rest of the &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Talon\"&gt;Druids of the Talon&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Claw\"&gt;Druids of the Claw&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn their quest to free the druids, they discovered the prison that held the old &lt;a href=\"demon%20hunter\"&gt;demon hunter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;. Tyrande believed that the Betrayer, as the night elves grew to call him, could be a powerful ally against the Burning Legion and left Malfurion to awaken the druids while she freed Illidan. Malfurion continued on to awaken the druids, who had grown feral after almost ten millennia in the caves. However, the &lt;a href=\"Horn%20of%20Cenarius\"&gt;Horn of Cenarius&lt;/a&gt; freed them of their madness.\nThe Betrayer.\nTyrande continued her quest to free Illidan, fighting her way through &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;the warden&lt;/a&gt;'s guards. Tyrande placed her trust in Illidan, believing his power would help them against the Burning Legion. Malfurion, however, still distrusted his reckless brother. Eager to prove himself, Illidan vowed he would show his brother the demons had no hold over him and he led a portion of the night elf army to Felwood. Shortly after, the death knight Arthas found and battled with Illidan. As the two were evenly matched, there was no reason for Arthas to engage Illidan. Illidan demanded that Arthas reveal the reason for his presence in Felwood. Arthas told him of a powerful artifact: the &lt;a href=\"Skull%20of%20Gul%27dan\"&gt;Skull of Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;. The skull was responsible for the corruption of the night elves' beloved forest. Arthas played to Illidan's thirst for power, mentioning that the skull held immense power, and Illidan took the bait willingly.\nAfter fighting his way through the demons, Illidan reached and consumed the power of the Skull. With its power added to his own, he slew the leader of the dreadlords, &lt;a href=\"Tichondrius\"&gt;Tichondrius&lt;/a&gt;, and helped seal the Legion's defeat. When Malfurion and Tyrande found the new demon-night elf that was now Illidan, Malfurion banished Illidan for his demonic corruption, claiming that he was \"no brother of his\". A very resentful Illidan tore his way through the dead trees and was not heard of until the coming of the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle of Mount Hyjal.\nAfter Illidan's banishment, Medivh called Malfurion and Tyrande to a secret grove where he had Thrall and Jaina meet them. Medivh revealed that he was the one who helped &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; create the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; and allowed the Horde to invade Azeroth. After he was slain for his crimes, he had to return to right his wrongs and protect Azeroth from the Legion's return. Medivh asked that the mortal races unite to defeat the Legion, as their combined power was their only hope.\nTo prepare for the demons' attack, three camps were built around Mount Hyjal. Malfurion devised a plan to use the power of the World Tree itself to destroy Archimonde. As he went back up the summit to make the necessary preparations for Archimonde, Jaina and Thrall used whatever night elves Tyrande could spare to fortify their bases. Archimonde tore his way through ranks of human knights, elven sentinels, and orcish warriors and smashed his way through the human castle and orc fortress. Jaina was able to teleport most of the surviving troops. Before Thrall escaped death, he managed to hurt Archimonde with a bolt of his shamanistic lightning, an incredible feat in itself. With the two bases destroyed, Archimonde stormed through the night elf gate protecting the summit. \nWith Archimonde at the World Tree, Malfurion used the Horn to call on the ancient spirits in the area to attack the demon. In an instant, they detonated into a massive explosion that destroyed the Defiler, much of his demon army with him, and the World Tree. The price for this defeat was the night elves' immortality, but the Third War was over.\nAftermath.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Battle of Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; was a significant blow against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. As &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt; put it in \"&lt;a href=\"Cycle%20of%20Hatred\"&gt;Cycle of Hatred&lt;/a&gt;\" to Theramore Guard colonel &lt;a href=\"Lorena\"&gt;Lorena&lt;/a&gt;, they \"did more damage to the entirety of demonkind than has been done in thousands of years.\"\nTerror of the tides.\nBristling with newfound power and free to roam the world once more, &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; set out to find his own place in the scheme of things. However, &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; confronted Illidan and made him an offer he could not refuse. Kil'jaeden was angered by &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt;'s defeat at &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, but he had bigger concerns than vengeance. Sensing that his creation, the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, was growing too powerful to control, Kil'jaeden ordered Illidan to destroy &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; and put an end to the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; once and for all. In exchange, Illidan would receive untold power and a true place amongst the remaining lords of the Burning Legion.\nIllidan agreed and immediately set out to destroy the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt;, the icy crystal cask in which the Lich King's &lt;a href=\"ghost\"&gt;spirit&lt;/a&gt; resided. Illidan knew that he would need a mighty artifact to destroy the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt;. Using the knowledge he had gained from &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;'s memories, Illidan decided to seek out the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; and claim the Dark Titan's remains. He called in some old &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; debts and called the serpentine &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; from their dark undersea lairs. Led by the cunning &lt;a href=\"sea%20witch\"&gt;sea-witch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Vashj\"&gt;Lady Vashj&lt;/a&gt;, the naga helped Illidan reach the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;, where Sargeras' tomb was rumored to be located.\nAs Illidan set out with the naga, &lt;a href=\"Warden\"&gt;Warden&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; began to hunt him. Maiev had been Illidan's jailor for ten thousand years and relished the prospect of recapturing him.\nCurse of the blood elves.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; irrevocably tainted the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;, Prince &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; gathered a group of Quel\u2019Thalas\u2019s defenders and destroyed the fount to avert it from obliterating his people. Although the high elves were spared from continued exposure to the Sunwell\u2019s dark energies, in the fount\u2019s absence they suffered terribly from withdrawal. As a result, Kael\u2019thas desperately searched for a means to help his people\u2014whom he had renamed the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20resistance\"&gt;Alliance resistance&lt;/a&gt; formed under Grand Marshal &lt;a href=\"Garithos\"&gt;Garithos&lt;/a&gt;' command, who had rallied the surviving humans of &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. Along with reinforcements from &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;, the Alliance resistance had managed to retake &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, pushing the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; back to the &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands\"&gt;Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;.\nCivil war in the Plaguelands.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s defeat at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Battle of Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; returned to his ruined kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; to rule over his undead subjects, annihilate the last pockets of human resistance, and oust the remaining &lt;a href=\"dreadlord\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt;s who were unaware of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s defeat. However, the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;'s powers began to wane and demanded Arthas travel to &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt; to defend it from &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Forces&lt;/a&gt;. With the Lich King's control over the undead faltering, one group of undead broke away from the Scourge and freed themselves of the Lich King's domination. Among them was &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; who plotted with the &lt;a href=\"Dreadlord%20Insurgents\"&gt;Dreadlord Insurgents&lt;/a&gt; to destroy Arthas.\nSurviving members of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; in Lordaeron retook portions of the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Eastern Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. Yet after the death of Highlord &lt;a href=\"Alexandros%20Mograine\"&gt;Alexandros Mograine&lt;/a&gt;, these holy crusaders underwent a schism: some following the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt;, comprising of zealous humans that cling to their scattered holdings, obsessed with eradicating the undead and retaking their once-beautiful homeland, and the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt;, which took a less extreme approach to combat the Scourge and accepted members from all of Azeroth's races into their ranks.\nThe colonization of Kalimdor.\nUnder &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20troll\"&gt;Darkspear troll&lt;/a&gt;s were brought together on &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; to become the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;new Horde&lt;/a&gt;, to which the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; would later join. A peace agreement was made between the Horde and Alliance after the war, and Thrall has made it his job to ensure that nothing happens to break this already stressed pact.\nA new Alliance.\nWithout Lordaeron, the rebuilt city of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; would become the new base of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, with the &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20dwarf\"&gt;Ironforge dwarves&lt;/a&gt; becoming their staunchest and closest geographical allies. The budding nation of &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt; has also aligned itself with the Alliance, with Lady Jaina hoping the Alliance can reunite the distant human kingdoms. The &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt; had been unable to help in the Third war as they were dealing with their own issues closer to home \u2014 namely a &lt;a href=\"trogg\"&gt;trogg&lt;/a&gt; invasion of their city. Because an invasion of troggs paled in comparison to the might of the Scourge, the gnomes decided they would fight their war alone. In the end they were forced to flee &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt; and with their king, &lt;a href=\"Gelbin%20Mekkatorque\"&gt;Gelbin Mekkatorque&lt;/a&gt;, settled in &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; with the dwarves as refugees. The night elves, dealing with the loss of their immortality, adjusted to their mortal existence. Sometime during this adjustment period, &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;'s spirit was lost in the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; and could not wake from his magically induced coma. Going against Malfurion's wishes, &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt; led the druids in growing &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;, which became the new capital of the night elves. Having been exposed to the world outside their forests once more, the night elves decided they would have to make alliances with the wider world. Because of the animosity with the orcs for their continuing lumbering of &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Gulch\"&gt;Warsong Gulch&lt;/a&gt;, the night elves in the end joined the Alliance.\nBrave new world.\nAs &lt;a href=\"battleground\"&gt;battleground&lt;/a&gt;s pushed the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; further to war, Lady Jaina Proudmoore invited King &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and Warchief &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; to a summit in Theramore to find solutions for the hostilities. However, King &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; went missing under suspicious circumstances while en route to the diplomatic summit. Stormwind was believed to be going through a state of disarray and young &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; was given the crown so that order could be preserved within the kingdom of Stormwind, at the behest of the royal councilor, &lt;a href=\"Katrana%20Prestor\"&gt;Lady Prestor&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Highlord%20Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Highlord Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; acted as a kind of Regent of Stormwind or the Supreme Commander of Stormwind's forces on behalf of King Anduin, with Lady Prestor advising Bolvar on the proper use of Stormwind's resources. \nAfter their loss on Kalimdor, some forces of the Burning Legion retreated to &lt;a href=\"Darkwhisper%20Gorge\"&gt;Darkwhisper Gorge&lt;/a&gt; while remnants of the Scourge went to &lt;a href=\"Razorfen%20Downs\"&gt;Razorfen Downs&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the age of &lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;, \"\"Four years have passed since the mortal races banded together and stood united against the might of the Burning Legion. Though &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; was saved, the tenuous pact between the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; has all but evaporated.

{"id": "491525", "revid": "46586549", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=491525", "title": "Third invasion of the Burning Legion", "text": "The third invasion of the Burning Legion was a large scale conflict started in 32 &lt;a href=\"ADP\"&gt;ADP&lt;/a&gt; between the people of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"felsworn\"&gt;felsworn&lt;/a&gt; races they allied with. This invasion, like the others, is a sub-conflict of a much greater war, the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;, in which the remaining free worlds in the universe attempt to stave off and defeat the Burning Legion. The war was formally ended after the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20Campaign\"&gt;Burning Crusade was ended on Argus&lt;/a&gt;.\nBeginning of the invasion.\nThe Tomb of Sargeras.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt;'s defeat at in the alternate , &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;alternate Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; was sent to Azeroth by &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; to open the way for the Burning Legion. Guided by the voice of Kil'jaeden, Gul'dan found his way to the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;, though he was soon confronted by &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Archmage Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; who had followed his trail from Draenor. Gul'dan's mission was to re-open the &lt;a href=\"Dimensional%20gateway\"&gt;portal&lt;/a&gt; inside the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href=\"Elisande\"&gt;Elisande&lt;/a&gt; and her &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; had closed during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; using the &lt;a href=\"Pillars%20of%20Creation\"&gt;Pillars of Creation&lt;/a&gt;, and allow the Burning Legion into Azeroth.\nAfter a heated duel between Gul'dan and Khadgar, who was aided by &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;, Gul'dan managed to break the magical seals locking the power source buried beneath the Tomb. Gul'dan absorbed all of it and with that power, he got rid of Khadgar and Maiev by making the roof collapse on top of them. While they were busy getting themselves out of the rumbles, Gul'dan, after a moment of hesitation, poured all the energy he had gained into the closed portal. The Legion thus began its third invasion of Azeroth.\nThe battle at the Broken Shore.\nAfter being warned of the Legion's coming by Archmage Khadgar, a massive counter-attack was formed by the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; as well as other factions, to assault the Tomb of Sargeras at the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt; and attempt to close the portal. Just before the battle, discovered that there was a trap set by the Burning Legion, but the agents were ambushed by &lt;a href=\"Detheroc\"&gt;Detheroc&lt;/a&gt;, who then impersonated &lt;a href=\"Master%20Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; and led the defenders of Azeroth into the trap. After many casualties and the destruction of most of the Azerothian fleet, a sizable force managed to penetrate the island and push the Legion back to the main portal. At the last moment, however, nearly all the most powerful demons of the Burning Legion made their return and overwhelmed the armies of Azeroth. The Horde's forces were flanked and forced to retreat off the island. Without the Horde, the Alliance was forced to retreat as well before the might of the Legion.\nThe battle resulted in the deaths of a considerable amount of troops as well as both &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Warchief Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt;; the leaders would be succeeded by &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, respectively.\nDuring the funerals of the Alliance and Horde's deceased leaders, &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt; envoys discovered a plot by &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s masquerading as guards to ambush the gathered faction leaders during their time of mourning. The Illidari revealed these demon assassins and aided the Alliance and Horde in repelling the ambush. For their service, the Alliance and Horde welcomed the Illidari as allies in the war against the Burning Legion.\nAssault on Azeroth.\nThe Legion nearly immediately started attacking major cities and areas of strategic importance, notably: &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tanaris\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Barrens\"&gt;Northern Barrens&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Morogh\"&gt;Dun Morogh&lt;/a&gt;. All factions of Azeroth worked to repel the attacks, led by famous heroes such as &lt;a href=\"Falstad%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Falstad Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"High%20Overlord%20Saurfang\"&gt;High Overlord Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; and even &lt;a href=\"Jastor%20Gallywix\"&gt;Trade Prince Jastor Gallywix&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring this time, &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;King Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; awakened from his slumber, and revealed that he had become one with the &lt;a href=\"world-soul\"&gt;world-soul&lt;/a&gt; of Azeroth. He explained to Archmage Khadgar and his brother &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann&lt;/a&gt; that Azeroth was, in fact, a nascent titan. He told them about the powerful &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; relics called the &lt;a href=\"Pillars%20of%20Creation\"&gt;Pillars of Creation&lt;/a&gt;, the only way to close the Legion's portal inside the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; and end the invasion.\nKhadgar thus rushed to &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt;, looking for clues as to the relics' location. The Legion had sent their own troops to take the Tower down, but Khadgar, aided by an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;, managed to find the answer he was looking for in time, in an old book written by the first &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardian of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt; himself, &lt;a href=\"Alodi\"&gt;Alodi&lt;/a&gt;. They now knew that they had to sail to the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;, where the Pillars of Creation resided.\nThe class orders.\nWith the failure that was the Battle for the Broken Shore and with tensions between the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; preventing faction leaders from working closely, members of each class decided to unite and focus on this threat, and do what needed to be done. Class orders represent their collective effort to band together and face the threat posed by the return of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nWar on the Broken Isles.\nDalaran.\n&lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; is moved to &lt;a href=\"Deadwind%20Pass\"&gt;Deadwind Pass&lt;/a&gt; in order to safeguard the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; from a Legion incursion. Knowing that the combined forces of the greatest champions of Azeroth are necessary to succeed in resealing the portal, Archmage &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; made a plea to the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Six\"&gt;Council of Six&lt;/a&gt; to readmit the Horde back into the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; in order to fight the demons at full strength.\nThe leader of the Kirin Tor at the time, &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, was in opposition to this but the Council put the matter to a vote and the majority voted against her. In response, Jaina left the Kirin Tor, unable to condone the Council's decision. Khadgar assumed leadership of the Kirin Tor after Jaina's departure.\nThe secrets of Ulduar.\n&lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; later informs Khadgar that his brother &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; has regained consciousness and wishes to speak with them at &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt;. Khadgar, an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; companion, and Brann travel to Ulduar where they find Magni under attack by demons under the command of &lt;a href=\"Inquisitor%20Ha%27zaduum\"&gt;Inquisitor Ha'zaduum&lt;/a&gt;. Khadgar and his allies defend Magni and afterward, Magni reveals that the ritual that changed his body has made him able to commune with &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; itself. Furthermore, he tells them that Azeroth is not just an ordinary world, she is a &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;. Following Magni to the &lt;a href=\"Celestial%20Planetarium\"&gt;Celestial Planetarium&lt;/a&gt;, Magni shows them the history of the &lt;a href=\"keeper\"&gt;keeper&lt;/a&gt;s and how they were charged by the titans to keep order in the world of Azeroth.\nTo aid them, the titans gave them five mighty artifacts known as the &lt;a href=\"Pillars%20of%20Creation\"&gt;Pillars of Creation&lt;/a&gt;. When their work was done, the keepers sealed the Pillars away. But like so many relics, they ended up in the hands of mortals. Khadgar recalls reading about those Pillars before from a tome in &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;'s library. Magni tells Khadgar that Azeroth has counseled him that the Pillars are the key to sealing the Legion's gateway into Azeroth and to preventing another Burning Legion invasion.\nKnowledge from Karazhan.\nAfter learning of the &lt;a href=\"Pillars%20of%20Creation\"&gt;Pillars of Creation&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt;, Khadgar returns to &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt; with an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; to find their location, as knowledge of the pillars had been entrusted to the &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardian of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt;. But Khadgar's reminiscing about his apprenticeship years ago is interrupted when an echo of Medivh himself interferes and brings down Khadgar's wards around the tower, allowing the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; to invade and try to stop them from finding the Pillars' location. Khadgar is able to alter the tower's defenders to fight off the Burning Legion while he and the adventurer retrieve a &lt;a href=\"Notable%20Antiquities%20of%20Ancient%20Azeroth\"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; authored by &lt;a href=\"Alodi\"&gt;Alodi&lt;/a&gt;, the first Guardian, which contains information on the Pillars of Creation.\nBack in Dalaran, Khadgar summons the spirit of Alodi to gain insight about the whereabouts of the Pillars of Creation. Alodi tells Khadgar that his research led him to the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;. Though he never found their exact locations, he believed the Pillars laid in the hands of the peoples of that ancient land. Knowing where to begin their search, Khadgar made preparations to transport Dalaran to the Broken Isles. The Council of Six, now including the blue dragon &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt;, has convened to combine their sorcery to &lt;a href=\"blink\"&gt;blink&lt;/a&gt; Dalaran to the Broken Isles, destroying the six &lt;a href=\"Legion%20ship\"&gt;Legion ship&lt;/a&gt;s attacking it in the process.\nThe teleportation successful, they declared Dalaran a neutral staging ground for the factions, where they would coordinate the search for the &lt;a href=\"Pillars%20of%20Creation\"&gt;Pillars of Creation&lt;/a&gt; and combat the Legion, and invited champions to utilize Dalaran's resources in order to spearhead their search for the Pillars.\nVal'sharah: Return of the Nightmare.\nThough &lt;a href=\"Xavius\"&gt;Xavius&lt;/a&gt;, the Nightmare Lord, was &lt;a href=\"War%20Against%20the%20Nightmare\"&gt;defeated&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; in 27 ADP, the Nightmare remained within the &lt;a href=\"Rift%20of%20Aln\"&gt;Rift of Aln&lt;/a&gt;. When the Burning Legion returned, Xavius on behalf of his Old God masters began to take over the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;, once more. Xavius' main target was the &lt;a href=\"World%20Tree\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shaladrassil\"&gt;Shaladrassil&lt;/a&gt;, located in the forests of &lt;a href=\"Val%27sharah\"&gt;Val'sharah&lt;/a&gt;. Through Shaladrassil he could corrupt the rest of the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Dream&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen Malfurion returned to Val'sharah, he found his mentor, &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;, in a coma. After some investigating he learned of the return of Xavius and with the aid of the Archdruids of Val'sharah, he summoned &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0 to aid them against the Nightmare. Cenarius was soon completely corrupted by the Nightmare. Due to the grief of losing his mentor, Malfurion went to confront Xavius in a fit of rage, but ended up captured. In an attempt to rescue him, Ysera fell into a trap, in which Xavius used the corrupted &lt;a href=\"Tear%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Tear of Elune&lt;/a&gt; to defeat and corrupt Ysera. &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; went on a mission to find Malfurion and confront Xavius. Malfurion was taken far too deep into the forest and Tyrande was unable to follow at the moment. A corrupted Ysera attacked the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Temple of Elune&lt;/a&gt; in Val'sharah but was eventually slain by Tyrande, the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;class order leader&lt;/a&gt; helping her and the &lt;a href=\"Sisterhood%20of%20Elune\"&gt;priests of Elune&lt;/a&gt;.\nSent by Tyrande, &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;order leaders&lt;/a&gt; went into the corrupted grove beneath Shaladrassil and defeated the Shade of Xavius to free Malfurion. Malfurion then led an attack into the Emerald Nightmare itself. The class leaders fought off many corrupted guardians of the Dream, including &lt;a href=\"Ursoc\"&gt;Ursoc&lt;/a&gt; and eventually Cenarius. The attack ended in the death of Xavius. With Xavius gone, the Nightmare disappeared, though it still stirs within the Rift. The guardians of the Dream, including the Archdruids of Val'sharah, Ursoc, and Ysera, all live on within the Emerald Dream.\nThe conflict in Stormheim.\nBoth the Alliance and Horde have deployed their forces to &lt;a href=\"Stormheim\"&gt;Stormheim&lt;/a&gt; in order to claim the &lt;a href=\"Aegis%20of%20Aggramar\"&gt;Aegis of Aggramar&lt;/a&gt; for their faction.\nSylvanas Windrunner takes the entire Forsaken fleet to Stormheim. While her Horde forces pursue the Aegis of Aggramar, Sylvanas intends to search for another treasure that she will be pursuing through her own means. The Alliance receives word of this mobilization and &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sky%20Admiral%20Rogers\"&gt;Sky Admiral Rogers&lt;/a&gt; track Sylvanas' fleet with the &lt;a href=\"Skyfire\"&gt;Skyfire&lt;/a&gt;. Believing Sylvanas herself was a passenger on one of the ships, the Skyfire deliberately attacked the Forsaken fleet. Unable to make contact with the rest of the Alliance fleet, the Skyfire proceeded with their assault alone. Though their forces managed to board the Forsaken's ships and kill their captains, when they boarded the royal flagship, the Alliance discovered that Sylvanas had already left the ship and that &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller\"&gt;Nathanos Blightcaller&lt;/a&gt; was leading a Horde force to sabotage the Skyfire. Genn would face off against Nathanos himself during the defense of the ship, who goaded Genn to fight him using his worgen form.\nUltimately, by the actions of Forsaken boarders, the Skyfire was sabotaged and crashed on Stormheim. The Skyfire was destroyed but its crew was able to evacuate before the crash and rallied in the &lt;a href=\"Skyfire%20Triage%20Camp\"&gt;Skyfire Triage Camp&lt;/a&gt; while combating the Horde. The Skyfire survivors were evacuated to &lt;a href=\"Greywatch\"&gt;Greywatch&lt;/a&gt; where Genn Greymane oversees the campaign to acquire the &lt;a href=\"Aegis%20of%20Aggramar\"&gt;Aegis of Aggramar&lt;/a&gt; and hunt for Sylvanas. Meanwhile, Nathanos rallies the Horde survivors and attempts to search for Sylvanas. After discovering she did not wish to be followed, Nathanos focused his attention on the Alliance, commanding Horde champions to inflict their wrath on them on his behalf before they pursue the Aegis.\nEventually, &lt;a href=\"Havi\"&gt;Havi&lt;/a&gt; contacts the adventurers and guides them in how to undergo the ancient trials that they need to perform in order to claim the &lt;a href=\"Aegis%20of%20Aggramar\"&gt;Aegis of Aggramar&lt;/a&gt;. Havi instructed them to slay other champions in the Broken Isles wishing to undergo the trials in order to be seen as a valid contender by &lt;a href=\"Yotnar\"&gt;Yotnar&lt;/a&gt;. When they bring the heads of these champions to Yotnar, they discover that Yotnar has been dismembered by &lt;a href=\"God-King%20Skovald\"&gt;God-King Skovald&lt;/a&gt; who declares that he will be the one to claim the Aegis, and with his new powers bestowed upon him by the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, he dismisses the need to undergo the trials and plans to claim the Aegis by force. Yotnar is disgusted by Skovald's disrespect and instructs the adventurer to go to the titan console to learn of the three trials they need perform which are: the Trial of Might, the Trial of Will, and the Trial of Valor. The first trial is the Trial of Might and Yotnar tasks the adventurer to reassemble his body and defeat him in combat. After being proven worthy, Yotnar recognizes the adventurer's strength and grants them the blessing of the Watchers.\nThe second trial is the Trial of Will. In this trial, the adventurer travels to &lt;a href=\"Hrydshal\"&gt;Hrydshal&lt;/a&gt; where they infiltrate the vrykul city, rescue the enslave &lt;a href=\"Thorignir\"&gt;Thorignir&lt;/a&gt; and aid them in slaying their captors. After the adventurer rescues the Thorignir brood, &lt;a href=\"Thrymjaris\"&gt;Thrymjaris&lt;/a&gt; empowers the adventurer's artifact with the power of storm and thunder and together, the dragons and the adventurer laid waste to Hrydshal.\nThe last trial is the Trial of Valor. Havi tells the adventurer the lore of the vrykul &lt;a href=\"Bonespeakers\"&gt;Bonespeakers&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Haustvald\"&gt;Haustvald&lt;/a&gt; though since they have aligned themselves with Skovald, they will not be of any help. Havi, however, knows that &lt;a href=\"Vydhar\"&gt;Vydhar&lt;/a&gt; still honors the old ways and advises the adventurer to seek the tree out in &lt;a href=\"Runewood\"&gt;Runewood&lt;/a&gt;. When the adventurer meets Vydhar, they discover that the Bonespeakers are using runestones to bind his tree and keep him silent. After turning the runestones as he instructed, he is released from his binds and reveals to the adventurer the ritual of wakening needed to summon the honored dead. The ritual of wakening will summon the dead vrykul rulers whose judgment will decide if the adventurer is worthy. Though the adventurer has managed to prove themselves to most of the dead vrykul, the adventurer discovers that &lt;a href=\"Ashildir\"&gt;Ashildir&lt;/a&gt;'s grave has been desecrated. The adventurer and &lt;a href=\"Shieldmaiden%20Iounn\"&gt;Shieldmaiden Iounn&lt;/a&gt; investigate Ashildir's bones and find out that the Bonespeakers were behind the grave's disturbance and were seeking to use magic to sunder the very essence of the &lt;a href=\"Valkyra\"&gt;Valkyra&lt;/a&gt; queen. Fortunately, the adventurer and Iounn were able to use the Bonespeakers' own magic to their advantage and use their runes to return Ashildir's spirit to her bones, thereby summoning her. Ashildir tells the adventurer that they must act quickly as the Bonespeaker &lt;a href=\"Runeseer%20Faljar\"&gt;Runeseer Faljar&lt;/a&gt; is using his forbidden magic to bind her spirit and force her judgment on the God-King. The adventurer and Ashildir go to confront Faljar but Faljar abandons his plan to subjugate Ashildir and just decides to banish both the adventurer and Ashildir to &lt;a href=\"Helheim\"&gt;Helheim&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Helheim\"&gt;Helheim&lt;/a&gt;, the adventurer and Ashildir plan their escape from the prison realm by finding a cooperative spirit to aid them in sneaking past &lt;a href=\"Guarm\"&gt;Guarm&lt;/a&gt; and ask &lt;a href=\"Helya\"&gt;Helya&lt;/a&gt; to release them back to the mortal world. They found an ally in &lt;a href=\"Colborn%20the%20Unworthy\"&gt;Colborn the Unworthy&lt;/a&gt; who hatched a plan to disguise the three of them as &lt;a href=\"Kvaldir\"&gt;Kvaldir&lt;/a&gt;. Though Colborn himself was detected, the adventurer and Ashildir managed to approach Helya but not before catching a glimpse of Sylvanas Windrunner striking some sort of bargain with the fallen keeper. Helya agrees to release Ashildir and her adventurer if they prove themselves worthy by defeating her champion &lt;a href=\"Geir\"&gt;Geir&lt;/a&gt;. Helya used her magic to weaken the adventurer, however, and does not believe they will be able to accomplish her task. Fortunately, Ashildir knows of a way for the adventurer to regain their strength. Ashildir believes the Kvaldir ships carry special lanterns that can release bonds of the spirit. With the special lantern, the adventurer unbound the missing fragments of their will, valor, and might of their spirit. With their strength restored, the adventurer defeats Geir and fulfilled Helya's bargain. Though Helya attempted to go back on her word and keep them there her word was binding. Thus the adventurer and Ashildir were rescued by beams of light and returned to the mortal world. The adventurer found themselves near &lt;a href=\"Valdisdall\"&gt;Valdisdall&lt;/a&gt; where Havi congratulates them on completing the final trial and earning Ashildir's favor. Though the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Halls of Valor&lt;/a&gt; were now opened to the adventurer, Havi reminds them that God-King Skovald and his followers still bar their way and must be dealt with.\nThe Thorignir have come to the defense of the Halls of Valor but they are besieged by the &lt;a href=\"Felskorn\"&gt;Felskorn&lt;/a&gt;. The Thorignirs' leader and old ally of the adventurer, &lt;a href=\"Vethir\"&gt;Vethir&lt;/a&gt;, has been captured and is being subjugated. The adventurer frees Vethir, and together they destroy the portals profaning the &lt;a href=\"Gates%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Gates of Valor&lt;/a&gt; and slay Skovald's demon lieutenants, thus cutting Skovald off from demon reinforcements. With the Felskorn army broken, the adventurer proceeds to confront God-King Skovald and kills him, thus earning the Aegis of Aggramar as their reward.\nAfter Sylvanas returns from &lt;a href=\"Helheim\"&gt;Helheim&lt;/a&gt;, she takes a contingent of &lt;a href=\"dark%20ranger\"&gt;dark ranger&lt;/a&gt;s on &lt;a href=\"The%20Oblivion\"&gt;The Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; to the outskirts of &lt;a href=\"Skold-Ashil\"&gt;Skold-Ashil&lt;/a&gt;. There they attempt to overtake the vrykul city by force but are repelled. Sylvanas chooses a different approach and waits for an adventurer to undergo a rite of ascension to gain access to the vault that Sylvanas desires entrance to. Later on, Genn Greymane uncovers that the Forsaken means to plague Greywatch like they did Gilneas. Greymane commands his forces to destroy the plague caches and the invading Forsaken apothecary to secure Greywatch and later sends &lt;a href=\"Lorna%20Crowley\"&gt;Lorna Crowley&lt;/a&gt; to uncover what Sylvanas seeks in &lt;a href=\"Skold-Ashil\"&gt;Skold-Ashil&lt;/a&gt;. As Lorna discovers that Sylvanas means to create more &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt; by subjugating &lt;a href=\"Eyir\"&gt;Eyir&lt;/a&gt;, Genn musters the Alliance fleet in trying to assault &lt;a href=\"Dreadwake%27s%20Landing\"&gt;Dreadwake's Landing&lt;/a&gt;. The battle at &lt;a href=\"Greymane%27s%20Offensive\"&gt;Greymane's Offensive&lt;/a&gt; goes poorly as the Horde armies repel Greymane's forces. After hearing news of Lorna's intelligence, Genn personally goes to the vault in Skold-Ashil to confront Sylvanas.\nAt the vault, Sylvanas uses a magical lantern called the &lt;a href=\"Soulcage\"&gt;Soulcage&lt;/a&gt; to bind Eyir and tortures the Val'kyr to obey her commands. Genn lets out a beastly howl and speaks to Sylvanas in a menacing tone from the shadows. Genn tells Sylvanas her quest for immortality has left her vulnerable and cries out that he will have his vengeance on her as he pounces at her from the ceiling. He declares he will avenge Varian, Gilneas, and his son as he strikes at her; eventually knocking her down. Genn then charges at her but Sylvanas evades him and shoots a poisoned arrow at his shoulder, thus turning Genn human. Sylvanas taunts Genn by saying she overestimated him, and calling him an \"old wolf\". Genn then reveals that he stole Sylvanas' magical lantern during his last charge and smashes it on the ground, thus freeing Eyir. Sylvanas watched in shock and anger as Eyir is released from her binds and disappears. Genn walks out of the vault, snapping the shaft of Sylvanas' poisoned arrow lodged in his shoulder, and tells Sylvanas that since she stole his son's future, he now took hers. Genn is recovered by Lorna and the Gilneas Brigade and is treated for the poison back at Greywatch. Meanwhile, Sylvanas is determined more than ever and plans her next move.\nSuramar.\nTwilight of Suramar.\nWith its return, the Legion began assaulting the magical dome that had been protecting and isolating Suramar for the last 10'000 years. During the assault, Gul'dan offered Grand Magistrix &lt;a href=\"Elisande\"&gt;Elisande&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Nightborne\"&gt;Nightborne&lt;/a&gt; a deal: bring down the dome and allow the Burning Legion access to the Nightwell, in exchange for their lives and a place among the Legion's rank, with the added promise that he would leave the internal social structure of Suramar intact. After much pondering, Elisande decided to accept Gul'dan's offer, in order to spare the lives of her people.\nThis resulted in a dissident movement led by &lt;a href=\"First%20Arcanist%20Thalyssra\"&gt;First Arcanist Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt;, an advisor to Elisande, to resist Elisande and prevent the Burning Legion from entering the city. After a failed attempted coup due to the betrayal of &lt;a href=\"Advisor%20Melandrus\"&gt;Advisor Melandrus&lt;/a&gt; who had literally stabbed her in the back, Thalyssra had to watch the dome dissipate from outside the city. Grand Magistrix Elisande began rooting out political dissidents within the city to consolidate power and ensure no future rebellions.\nNightfallen rebellion.\nExiled, Thalyssra set about liberating Suramar from the Burning Legion and gaining back access to the Nightwell. With help from a &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;class leader&lt;/a&gt; sent by Khadgar, she made her base of operations in Shal'Aran, an ancient underground elven ruin. She gathered other exiles and made contact with dissidents hiding in Suramar. The Nightfallen, through various contacts, infiltrated Suramar City. They carried out assassinations, stole supplies, helped other dissidents, and got an ally in Elisande's court in the form of Lady &lt;a href=\"Ly%27leth%20Lunastre\"&gt;Ly'leth Lunastre&lt;/a&gt;. \nThalyssra has also set about ending the Nightfallen curse and cure the withered. The class leaders during a mission in &lt;a href=\"Falanaar\"&gt;Falanaar&lt;/a&gt; retrieved a seed from an arcan'dor tree. &lt;a href=\"Valewalker%20Farodin\"&gt;Valewalker Farodin&lt;/a&gt;, the last guardian of the ancient seed began working toward a way to use the arcan'dor seed to cure and sustain the Nightfallen, before they devolve into withered. After directing the power of various leyline feeds to Shal'aran, the arcan'dor seed slowly grew into a tree and is now able to cure the Nightfallen of their addiction and return them to their Nightborne form.\nThe Hunt for Illidan.\nEarly in the war, the mysterious Light's Heart arrived. After much struggle, the heroes of Azeroth were able to awaken the Heart via the Tears of Elune. The Heart revealed itself as the sentience core of the Prime Naaru Xe'ra, who informed them that Illidan Stormrage was key to stopping the Legion. Xe'ra took adventurers through Illidan's past, hoping for them to gain a better understanding and see him as more than a monster. Once this was done the Illidari and the other Class orders set out to reclaim Illidan's soul. Eventually, it was discovered that Gul'dan had struck a deal with Helya, in which she would keep it in Helheim. The Heroes of Azeroth ultimately retrieved Illidan's soul after attacking Helheim and killing Helya.\nBattle in the Nighthold.\nEventually, Gul'dan sought to use the power of the Nightwell and the body of Illidan to summon Sargeras into Azeroth. The heroes of Azeroth stormed the citadel, dispatching many demons and managing to persuade a dying Elisande to turn on Gul'dan. At the Font of Night atop the palace, the heroes faced Gul'dan, as well as the demon-possessed Illidan. After a long struggle the heroes managed to defeat Gul'dan and purge Sargeras from Illidan's body. Illidan immediately finished off Gul'dan and then told the assembled heroes to follow him into the abyss.\nAssault on Broken Shore.\nThe assault, triggered by a Legion attack on &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, echoed &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;a similar effort&lt;/a&gt; launched at the war's outbreak; one which ultimately resulted in a decisive victory for the Burning Legion.\nIn preparing for the imminent assault on the Legion-held Broken Shore, representatives from all of the various &lt;a href=\"Class%20Order\"&gt;Class Order&lt;/a&gt;s met to form the &lt;a href=\"Armies%20of%20Legionfall\"&gt;Armies of Legionfall&lt;/a&gt;, a new unified faction dedicated to thwarting the Burning Legion. Under the direction of &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Archmage Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;, this new force successfully threw back the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s' assault on Dalaran and secured a foothold on the Broken Shore itself.\nBased from the position of &lt;a href=\"Deliverance%20Point\"&gt;Deliverance Point&lt;/a&gt;, the Armies of Legionfall quickly set about engaging the Legion throughout the Broken Shore, securing further gains against &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;'s forces. The mortals' primary goal remains the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, the focal point of the Burning Legion's invasion, where they seek to sever the Legion's link the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter weeks of a hard-fought battle, Azeroth's heroes, at last, entered the dark &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;. Using the &lt;a href=\"%3APillars%20of%20Creation\"&gt;:Pillars of Creation&lt;/a&gt; to unbar &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt;'s protective wards, the band of heroes eventually defeated the remnants of the fel army in the vault and faced &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;' own &lt;a href=\"Avatar%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;avatar&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Prophet%20Velen\"&gt;Prophet Velen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Khadgar\"&gt;Archmage Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Illidan\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt;, and Azeroth's heroes pursued &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; to his &lt;a href=\"Legion%20ship\"&gt;command ship&lt;/a&gt; and vanquished him once and for all. With the death of Kil'jaeden, the Deceiver's command ship began to crash on Argus. Khadgar teleported everyone to the safety of &lt;a href=\"Azsuna\"&gt;Azsuna&lt;/a&gt; through a rift Illidan had opened with the &lt;a href=\"Sargerite%20Keystone\"&gt;Sargerite Keystone&lt;/a&gt; before the ship exploded. However, after arriving safely on Azeroth, it was revealed Illidan had left a rift from Azeroth to &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt; open, much to Khadgar's dismay. Horrified, Khadgar asked Illidan what he had done, and Illidan responded that sometimes the hand of fate must be forced.\nLegion Assaults.\nIn direct response to the attack on the Broken Shore, &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Assaults\"&gt;Legion Assaults&lt;/a&gt; are launched against the denizens of the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;. \nIn &lt;a href=\"Azsuna\"&gt;Azsuna&lt;/a&gt; Legion forces have turned the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20a%20Thousand%20Lights\"&gt;Temple of a Thousand Lights&lt;/a&gt; into a conduit for other Legion worlds. As such the Legion has heavily entrenched themselves within the temple, even as they attack the rest of the region. &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Farondis\"&gt;Prince Farondis&lt;/a&gt; directs the adventurers in liberating Azsuna and directs them in destroying the conduit. With the conduit severed the heroes of Azeroth work with the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Dragonflight\"&gt;Blue Dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; to push the Legion out of the &lt;a href=\"Ley-Ruins%20of%20Zarkhenar\"&gt;Ley-Ruins of Zarkhenar&lt;/a&gt; before flying to the &lt;a href=\"Legion%20ship\"&gt;Legion ship&lt;/a&gt; in order to put an end to the &lt;a href=\"Xeritas\"&gt;Xeritas&lt;/a&gt;, the commander of the &lt;a href=\"Assault%20on%20Azsuna\"&gt;Assault on Azsuna&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Highmountain\"&gt;Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; the Legion scorches the land, cause suffering to the &lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20tauren\"&gt;Highmountain tauren&lt;/a&gt;, and lay siege to &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Totem\"&gt;Thunder Totem&lt;/a&gt; itself. &lt;a href=\"Mayla%20Highmountain\"&gt;Mayla Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lasan%20Skyhorn\"&gt;Lasan Skyhorn&lt;/a&gt; direct the adventurers in thinning out the demons attacking Thunder Totem. However, despite boosting their defenses the Legion still persists in attacking Thunder Totem, which convinces Mayla and Lasan that they need to strike at the heart of the Legion forces. After successfully securing Thunder Totem heroes take flight towards the Legion ship in order to rescue prisoners, plant explosives, and to kill &lt;a href=\"Fel%20Commander%20Erixtol\"&gt;Fel Commander Erixtol&lt;/a&gt;, the commander of the &lt;a href=\"Assault%20on%20Highmountain\"&gt;Assault on Highmountain&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Stormheim\"&gt;Stormheim&lt;/a&gt; the Legion uses their invasion of the region as a distraction in order to establish a foothold on the &lt;a href=\"Shield%27s%20Rest\"&gt;Shield's Rest&lt;/a&gt;. Working with &lt;a href=\"Vethir\"&gt;Vethir&lt;/a&gt;, the adventurers seek to cleanse the isle of the demons but are interrupted by the arrival of &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Commander%20Alexius\"&gt;Lord Commander Alexius&lt;/a&gt;, Legion commander in charge of of the &lt;a href=\"Assault%20on%20Stormheim\"&gt;Assault on Stormheim&lt;/a&gt;. After wounding Vethir Alexius briefly engaged in battle with the heroes before stunning them and ordering his Legion ship to fire upon them. As the demon moves to attack the &lt;a href=\"Gates%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Gates of Valor&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr%20of%20Odyn\"&gt;Val'kyr of Odyn&lt;/a&gt; arrives to shield adventurers from the ship's blast. Transported to the Gates of Valor, the heroes liberate members of &lt;a href=\"Thorignir\"&gt;Vethir's brood&lt;/a&gt; who then bring them to the Legion ship where the heroes proceeded to slaughter the demons on board including Alexius.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Val%27sharah\"&gt;Val'sharah&lt;/a&gt; the Legion has completely claimed &lt;a href=\"Starstalker%27s%20Point\"&gt;Starstalker's Point&lt;/a&gt;, converted &lt;a href=\"Black%20Rook%20Hold\"&gt;Black Rook Hold&lt;/a&gt; into their stronghold and have darkened the skies. &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Jarod%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Commander Jarod Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; instructs the adventurers with thinning their ranks before sending to &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;. The demigod aids them in reclaiming Starstalker's Point by securing the entry point into the Starstalker's Point and directing the adventurers to destroy the barriers preventing none Legion forces from entering the warden tower itself. With the tower secured and the skies liberated the adventurers are then sent to the Legion ship by &lt;a href=\"hippogryph\"&gt;hippogryph&lt;/a&gt;s, lent by the &lt;a href=\"Dreamweavers\"&gt;Dreamweavers&lt;/a&gt;, where they kill &lt;a href=\"Dread%20Vizier%20Gra%27tork\"&gt;Dread Vizier Gra'tork&lt;/a&gt; the commander of the &lt;a href=\"Assault%20on%20Val%27sharah\"&gt;Assault on Val'sharah&lt;/a&gt;.\nArgus Campaign.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Assault%20on%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Assault on Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;ians traveled on the \"&lt;a href=\"Vindicaar\"&gt;Vindicaar&lt;/a&gt;\" to take the fight to the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; on their homeworld \u2014 &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;. There, the \"Vindicaar's\" forces regrouped with the &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Army of the Light&lt;/a&gt;, recruited the &lt;a href=\"Argussian%20Reach\"&gt;Argussian Reach&lt;/a&gt;, and salvaged whatever weapons they could find in order to assault the Burning Legion capital of &lt;a href=\"Antorus%2C%20the%20Burning%20Throne\"&gt;Antorus&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; however, worked to create a &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Pantheon\"&gt;Dark Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; and was using Argus's own &lt;a href=\"world-soul\"&gt;world-soul&lt;/a&gt; to regenerate his fallen armies. Sargeras's ultimate endgame was to turn Argus's world-soul into a dark &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; and use it to annihilate everything. The \"Vindicaar\"'s forces were able to liberate the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; and together they destroyed &lt;a href=\"Argus%20the%20Unmaker\"&gt;Argus the Unmaker&lt;/a&gt; and imprisoned Sargeras, thus ending his &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn his last moments before the Pantheon sealed him within their &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20the%20Pantheon\"&gt;Seat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; impaled &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; with his sword, in &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;. Sargeras's last spiteful act may have dire ramifications, however. &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; was the first to witness the power of titan blood and the wound inflicted by Sargeras has caused Azeroth to hemorrhage. Both the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; have taken a keen interest in &lt;a href=\"Azerite\"&gt;Azeroth blood&lt;/a&gt; as a resource, which could spell a new &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;war&lt;/a&gt; between the two factions. The wielders of powerful &lt;a href=\"artifact\"&gt;artifact&lt;/a&gt; weapons used their artifact weapons to absorb the poisonous power of Sargeras's sword in order to save Azeroth's &lt;a href=\"world-soul\"&gt;world-soul&lt;/a&gt;, rendering their weapons unstable. Still, their sacrifices have aided in Azeroth's recovery.\nSpeculation.\nThe invasion was very likely referenced as the Third Host by the members of the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20Wake\"&gt;Argus Wake&lt;/a&gt;.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

Very few people actually use the term \"own\"; it is (essentially) invariably purposely spelled \"pwn\", although in speech they would probably pronounce it \"pown\" (or \"pone\") \u2014 though the correct pronunciation would be \"poon\" based on the fact there are no vowels in the word. Many players will use \"pwn\" or the past tense \"pwned\", \"pwnd\", or \"pwnt\" jokingly. The word is also purposefully used incorrectly as a noun, \"That battle was pwnage!\" or in a noun-phrase \"I am The Pwnage!\"\nExamples:\nYounger gamers are steadfast in their belief that the origin of this word dates back to the days of WarCraft when a map designer misspelled \"Own\" as \"Pwn\". What was originally supposed to be \"player has been owned\" was \"player has been pwned\".\nOlder gamers, those that were around before video games and those that grew up using BBS's for online entertainment, will argue that the origin of this word dates back several hundred years ago to the game of Chess when checkmating your opponent with a Pawn, the lowest valued chess piece, was termed Pawned and, without using l337 speak, simply typed pwn, pwnd, etc. when executing this form of checkmate.\nIt is, however, more likely that the origin of the word is the same as that of ZOMG in that it was actually just a typo, having had the character \"P\" pressed instead of the character \"O\" \u2014 which is just to the left on the standard keyboard.\nThere have also been rumors of foreign keyboard construction types lacking certain keys, most notably the \"O\" and \"L\" keys, hence other misspellings supposedly performed on purpose by players with said keyboards. Some examples would be: \"KIK\" instead of \"LOL\" or \"KK\" rather than \"OK\"; but this is only speculation.\nThe end result is the same; one would rather pwn than be pwnd themselves. The term grew from there and is now used throughout the online world and especially within online games."}

Oxhorn, Staghorn and Mortuus have decided to invent curse words in order to aid communication.\nInventing Swear Words 2.\nSince the previous swear words that they invented have not caught on yet, Oxhorn, Staghorn and Mortuus meet again in order to come up with a new one and to discuss promotion strategies. They enlist the help of Hat the singing turtle and Lacy, who is Mortuus\u2019 girlfriend. But things don\u2019t go exactly according to plan.\nInventing Swear Words 3.\nOxhorn, Staghorn and Mortuus have been unsuccessful in getting their newly invented swear words to be used, and so they go off to the Un'Goro Crater in search of the Master of Euphemisms, to see if he can help.\nInventing Swear Words 4.\nAfter grossing out all his friends by announcing his engagement, the day has finally arrived for Mortuus to marry Lacy, the love of is life. Even if she is a giant half-cow womanish... thing. And who officiates the wedding? Why, none other than &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Gorchuk\"&gt;Warlord Gorchuk&lt;/a&gt;, who has apparently had his fill of red snappah and is masterful!\nInventing Swear Words 5.\nOx, Stag and Mort have figured out a way to spread their invented swear words--hack into Blizzard's chat filter! The process, however, may be more complicated than they planned.\nMore Machinima.\nHat vs. Barnaby.\nHat the Singing Turtle loves to sing, and he has many fans. There are others, however, think that his singing is pure rubbish. Barnaby the crab is one of them. What is left to do when your precious singing has been insulted by an ornery crab? Why, defend your honor, of course. A fight of epic proportions is sure to ensue!\nKrick in the Back!\nOxhorn gets a krick in his back. Warlord Gorchuk helps him out.\nRed Snappah!\nAt long last, the gates to Ahn'Qiraj will soon open! Surely Warlord Gorchuk has something mighty for Oxhorn to do in order to help open the gates. Wait... he wants peacebloom? That doesn't seem very mighty...\nOxhorn Tells Off Xfire.\nXfire sponsored a contest for up-and-coming Machinima film makers, asking them to each make an advertisement for their contest with a cash reward based upon the number of downloads the advertisement got. Why, this is pure exploitation, and Oxhorn will have nothing to do with it! Watch while Oxhorn picks on Xfire (and, more than anything, himself) acting like a snooty fool.\nThe Joy of Punting Gnomes.\nThis is a short commercial Oxhorn made in response to Xfire's \"VIP\" contest. They asked a few authors to make a promo commercial that would be aired on MTV and its affiliates, and then they would pick the best one. \"Squirrelbane\" by the fellows over at Myndflame was chosen over mine (for reasons that are obvious).\nDrunken Kodo Riding.\nOxhorn has a few drinks and then goes out for a lovely ride through The Barrens on his kodo, Busco. Little does he know that the Orgrimmar Mounted Police are watching his every turn!\nElf On.\nElf On--Apply directly to an Elf! Do Elves annoy you on a daily basis? Elf On.

Will the man win them over with the power of his rhetoric? Will the engineers prove how foolish he is and dismiss him? Or will the Invisible Pink Unicorn show up and startle everyone?\nWe Eat Flesh!\nFrancis Baconmeister Jr. loves meat, and he owns a meat-only restaurant to prove it. But what will happen when a bunch of hippie elves protest his fine establishment? And what on earth is his secret ingredient?\nMighty Morphin' Midget Gnomes UNITE!\nMidget Gnomes unite! Blue, Yellow, Pink, Green, Red! All the Mighty Morphin' Midget Gnomes want to do is eat cupcakes and watch a bull-fight, but their boss, the Giant Floating Head, wants to send them on a mission. Will a compromise be made so that both parties get their way? Or will the Giant Head assert his authority? Or will the Gnomes poke out his eyes and read copies of the swimsuit edition of Good Gnomekeeping?\nMusical Machinima.\nROFLMAO!\nAll I can say is, ROFLMAO!\nAn Oxhorn Brand Medley.\nEver wonder what would happen if all the characters from the Oxhorn Brand Universe were to collide? This song incorporates quotes and choruses from many of his movies. Can you recognize them all?\nThe Anti-Elf Anthem.\nOf all the men of Azeroth, I must say that my least favorite race is the Elf! This is an anthem for all of those like me who detest Elves with every fiber of their being. And to all those who play Elves out there, I fully realize that you are free to choose whichever race you want. And you chose wrong. \nHehe, just joking.\nKinda.\nThe Great Kodo.\nBy far, the best mount is the game is the kodo. This movie is a tribute to the kodo and everything that makes the kodo the greatest creature to have lived (in Azeroth).\nBirth of the Forsaken.\nThis movie tells the story of how the Forsaken came to be.\nThe Tauren's Kilt.\nHe adapted a song called \"The Scotsman\" by The Irish Rovers and sang it for this film.\nCourting a Celt.\nHe made this for the Axe/Xfire contest, using the game Dark Age of Camelot.

Who bears the blame for this unfortunate accident? Why, none other than the cursed gnome!\nWork Work, Zug Zug, Dabu.\nA labor day special!\nHoliday Specials.\nOxhorn's Christmas Special.\nOxhorn, Staghorn and Mortuus are going to a Christmas party at Shattrath, but the trip is taking too long. Staghorn craves some pecan pie, and they concoct a devious plan. \nThe 12 days of Winters Veil.\nTo everyone at Blizzard Entertainment, WarCraftMovies.com, his fellow machinimator peers and most importantly, all the fans whose support has made movie making all the more worthwhile, he wish you all a merry Christmas and a happy Winter\u2019s Veil!\nHark! Hear the Wails.\nA short carol in World of Warcraft, with a devious twist. Original music by him, based on a traditional Christmas carol.

The Elves of the world have other plans.\nRabbit Stew.\nOx just can't seem to color the perfect Easter egg. Will Mort or Stag do any better?\nDrama Machinima.\nRacing the Grimtotem.\nRoper and his wife Lanalee are on hard times and have only silverleaf soup to eat. They have already begun to talk of eating the family kodo when Lanalee finds a flyer in Gadgetzan promoting a race to be held in the Shimmering Flats, with a prize that is more than enough to buy food with. But does the family kodo have it in him to win the race? And even if they do win, who will lose, and what will be the consequences of either winning or losing? Especially when the other racers belong to the thuggish Grimtotem clan...\nOxhorn's Characters.\nOxhorn.\nOxhorn was raised in Mulgore, and didn\u2019t have a particularly interesting \nchildhood. Oftentimes people will say that they are related to Thrall or \nCairne or some other prominent figure in some way, like being Thrall\u2019s \nnephew\u2019s cousin\u2019s tutor\u2019s massage therapist, but Oxhorn isn\u2019t related to \nanyone special. No, his parents were just two hard-working Tauren that \nlived perfectly hum-drum lives. \nNow that he is grown, Oxhorn likes to spend his time riding his kodo Busco, \njoining his friends for a drink at the local pub, perpetuating hatred towards \nall of elf-kind, and shooting little movies. He has been in a lot of movies, \nand has played a number of roles, but he is best known for the grammatical escapades he has undertaken with his friends Staghorn and Mortuus. \nStaghorn.\nStaghorn is level thirty-three. He wears green iron armor and likes \nit so well that he has no intention of ever changing it. He belongs to \na guild named Reluctance, which role-plays all the time, and he takes \nhis role-playing very seriously. \nAfter spending hour after hour with his guild-mates, tagging \u201c\u2013eth\u201d \nto the end of every word and throwing out nuggets like \u201cdost\u201d, \n\u201cthou\u201d and \u201cforsooth\u201d, Staghorn will often hang out with his friends Oxhorn and Mortuus to relax. Mortuus, however, tries hard to make Staghorn\u2019s relaxation hardly relaxing.\nMortuus.\nMortuus is an uber l33t d00d. You know that guy that pwns ur flak hard? \nYou know that guy who hangs out in Darnassus waiting for some gray elf to walk by? You know that guy who camps the graveyard, waiting for you to respawn? Mortuus, Mortuus, Mortuus. And he makes no apology for his behavior. After all, you chose to play the Alliance, and it is his mission to remind you every day that you chose wrong. \nMortuus has spent so much time perfecting his l33t ninja skillz that he \nnever had a chance to learn the English language properly, and thus he \ncan\u2019t help but speak in l33t. But don\u2019t make fun of the way he talks, or \nhe\u2019ll r0xorz ur b0xorz with some r0ffle-waffles, you n00bish bloiting \nblits. Ftw.\nLacy.\nLacy is Mortuus\u2019 girlfriend. She is a big ugly female Tauren. Now, Tauren are not \nugly by nature. In fact, many Tauren women are down-right beautiful. It\u2019s just that \nLacy is not one of those Tauren women. In the words of Oxhorn, \u201cShe looks like she \nwas tied to the bumper of the ugly truck with the ugly rope and then dragged down Ugly Street for fifty ugly miles.\u201d \nLuckily for her, Mortuus thinks that she's hot, and the two have been dating \nfor quite some time. They eventally get married, and even have children, which, as described by Ox and Stag, are \"dead cow-bies\".\nHat.\nHat is a singing turtle. He was born in a little pond in The Barrens, but he could not relate to the other turtles. They all wanted to eat crickets and worms, and while crickets and worms are all fine and dandy, all Hat really wanted to do was sing. As far as turtles go, Hat sings fairly well, but poor Hat can hardly compare to professional singers. \nBut that doesn\u2019t bother him! No sir, if Hat wants to sing, Hat will sing, and there is nothing that can get in his way! Except for Barnaby, who can\u2019t stand his singing.\nWarlord Gorchuk.\n&lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Gorchuk\"&gt;Warlord Gorchuk&lt;/a&gt; was responsible for collecting supplies donated by the Horde in order to open the gates to Ahn\u2019Qiraj. At the time, he tormented poor Oxhorn, who just wanted to enter a super-cool new dungeon. Now that the gates are open and Gorchuk is retired, his only life goal is to annoy Oxhorn at every available opportunity.\nAssociate Professor Evil.\nAssociate Professor Evil was sent to the Evil Alchemist University by his parents so that he might become the most evil alchemist ever. He studied hard while he was there, and didn\u2019t have much of a social life. All of his friends dropped out and are now selling cheese or cockroaches in the Undercity, but Associate Professor Evil graduated with honors, and now works at the Evil Alchemist University, instructing students in evil alchemy. \nIn order to maintain his reputation, he must be constantly pursuing evil\u2026 pursuits. He has decided that he wants a lot of power, and has concocted a number of schemes in order to get such power. He and his pet crab named Barnaby travel all over Azeroth, when he is not teaching, in order to find new ways of attaining evil power. Instead, Associate Professor Evil ends up solving some social ill, which forces many to ask whether or not he is truly evil at all.\nBarnaby.\nBarnaby is Associate Professor Evil\u2019s pet crab. He\u2019s a rather laid\nback guy. When Associate Professor Evil found him, Barnaby was \ntrying to catch cheese from a river. Associate Professor Evil pointed \nout that it is impossible to catch cheese from a river, and Barnaby realized that he made a good point. \nHe was so impressed by Associate Professor Evil\u2019s smarts (and the \nbit of cheese he gave him) that Barnaby decided to follow him. \nEvery now and then, Associate Professor Evil will make some \noutrageous demand of Barnaby, like \u201cKill all the beggars in \nOrgrimmar for me, Barnaby\u201d or \u201cKill all the gold farmers in Dead \nWind Pass for me, Barnaby,\u201d but Barnaby is pleased to oblige, for \nit often means that he\u2019ll be able to feast on his favorite dish\u2014elf.\nThunk.\nThunk is an Ogre, born and brought up in Dire Maul, named for the sound he made when he fell out of his mommy\u2019s belly. He always thought it was a terribly cute story, but he has yet to get a warm reception after telling it. Thunk, however, has never been one to give up. No, he will continue to tell the story, and to eat turkey, and to do a great many things that other ogres don't want to do, because that\u2019s just the kind of guy he is. He is also a very polite ogre, which is why the other ogres don\u2019t let him hang out with them at Dire Maul and other oger-ish places, for what kind of ogre is polite? \nInstead, he eats turkey and attends self-help meetings to learn more about himself. He usually ends up hating whatever he learns about himself, and instead hangs out with his friend Associate Professor Evil, who also shares his love of turkey.\nThe Horde-shop Quartet.\nThe Horde-shop quartet is led by Oxhorn, and includes three friends he \nfound in Orgrimmar one day. He discovered that they could sing, and so \nhe conscribed them to help him sing an anthem for all those who hate \nelves. They had such a good time singing the song that Oxhorn has \npromised to get them all together for another song, someday. \nDr. Strange Orc and Dink.\nDr. Strange Orc and Dink inexplicably found themselves floating in space one day. They have no idea how they got there. It is therefore their mission to find ways to entertain themselves. This is usually accomplished by singing old songs that no one else would ever enjoy and harassing passing meteorological objects.\nMaster of Euphemisms.\nThe Master of Euphemisms lives within a cave in the Un\u2019Goro Crater.\nHe is the master of wordplay, and can fill any seemingly harmless phrase\nwith naughty meaning. On many occasions he has been accosted by \nfemale trolls who think that his \"pinnacle of manly vigor\" is quite nice, \nand so he wears a disguise when meeting strangers to scare them \naway. His self-imposed exile has gone on for a very long time, which \nhas given him years to hone his euphemism art and, by consequence, \nincrease his fame, causing all female trolls to yearn for his \"upwardly \nmobile ham radio\" even more. They constantly beckon for him from the \nmouth of his cave, and some even see past his disguise. He now spends \nmost of his time defending himself from the rambunctious advancements \nof ladies whose \"kettles are boiling\" for him. \nIt's a hard life.\nHippy Elf.\nHippy Elf is an elf who is a hippy. He is quite annoying. He usually says something politically correct before being killed in the most horrible way imaginable. Now, many might say that this is just mean of me, to constantly be killing the same elf over and over again in my movies. \nWell\u2026 yeah. So?\nQuintus.\nQuintus is a graduate student at the Evil Alchemist University, and is Associate Professor Evil\u2019s underling. He lives in the tower and eats gruel. He is an intelligent man and willingly puts himself under Associate Professor Evil\u2019s authority, but he is not afraid to defy his master if the situation warrants. He is cold and logical, and unlike his master, never allows himself to be overcome with passion. He will make a good professor someday.\nMighty Morphin Midget Gnomes.\nMidget Gnomes unite! Blue! Green! Pink! Yellow! \nRed! The Mighty Morphin\u2019 Midget Gnomes are the secret defenders of Stormwind City. Whenever \nthe city is in terrible peril, the Mighty Morphin\u2019 Midget Gnomes are there! Cross them and they \nshall unite and transform into a terrible and \npowerful being that none can stop! \nUnless you are over three feet tall.\nOxhorn\u2019s Unabridged Dictionary.\nBLIT.\nnoun:\n1.

It is unknown why Ozruk has remained in the Stonecore, but it has become apparent that the guardian now believes that anyone opposed to &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; is a threat to &lt;a href=\"Deepholm\"&gt;Deepholm&lt;/a&gt;, and should therefore be destroyed.\"\nStrategy.\nOzruk should be pulled into the tunnel and tanked against a wall, this is so that on the knockback the tank will need minimal repositioning, the tank should run to the opposite wall and continue tanking as normal.\nHeroic Difficulty.\nIn heroic mode, there are a few changes.\nPeriodically, he will cast a paralyze debuff on the party, followed by a spell called Shatter. The paralyze effect lasts for eight seconds, and deals about 50,000 damage when it expires, this damage can be avoided by removing the debuff before it expires.\nParalyze can be broken by taking damage and is also dispellable. There are a couple of ways to deal with this:\nAfter casting Paralyze, Ozruk will begin to cast Shatter, it is essential that your group is away from the boss as this will one shot most players (including tanks).\nThe other main ability in heroic is his Ground Slam, which will erupt a cone of spikes from the ground in the direction he is facing. There is a cast time on this so the tank should ensure he is facing away from the group at all times and once Ozruk starts casting the tank should temporarily move behind him. This ability will one shot a tank. Melee and ranged should not be infront of the boss, but if they are they will also need to move.\nFinally, Ozruk will enrage at 25% health for 1 minute, increasing his damage by 50%. This can be dispelled with any Enrage removing ability.\nYou should plan to kite Ozruk slowly down the hall during this encounters, with the tank always running away from the rest of the group during the Shatter cast, so that Ground Slam will always be directed away from the party. Don't let him go too far, or you'll run into mobs on the other side of the tunnel.\nA good plan to use against Ozruk is for the tank to immediately run behind him (so the tank's back is toward the narrow tunnel). This will ensure that all other party members are behind Ozruk at the mouth of the tunnel when he casts Ground Slam. Upon casting Ground Slam, the tank should run straight through Ozruk and stop behind him until the spell is done. Once the spell has been cast, the tank should then immediately go to the other side, again with his back to the narrow tunnel. Ozruk will cast Shatter soon after Ground Slam, and this method will once again ensure that he is facing away from other party members at all times. As long as the tank continues to move \"back and forth\" through Ozruk as he casts Ground Slam, the fight will be fairly easy.\nWarrior tanks should resist the temptation to return to Ozruk after Shatter using Charge or Intercept. Ground Slam is cast very soon after the Shatter phase, and if you accidentally rush behind the boss before this happens, the boss will face the party and probably kill many of them.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

It is the final boss of the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20the%20Tides\"&gt;Throne of the Tides&lt;/a&gt; in \"\" and makes several appearances during the &lt;a href=\"Vashj%27ir\"&gt;Vashj'ir&lt;/a&gt; storyline.\nBackground.\nCataclysm.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Kelp%27thar%20Forest\"&gt;Kelp'thar Forest&lt;/a&gt;, players starting out in Vashj'ir are immediately shipwrecked by Ozumat.\nPlayers reach &lt;a href=\"Abyssal%20Depths\"&gt;Abyssal Depths&lt;/a&gt; via a new submarine, which is immediately used to attack Ozumat. Later during the naga's battle against Neptulon, &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Naz%27jar\"&gt;Lady Naz'jar&lt;/a&gt; unleashes Ozumat. Ozumat attaches itself to &lt;a href=\"Neptulon\"&gt;Neptulon&lt;/a&gt;'s \"head\" leading to the victory of the naga. After the battle with Ozumat in the Throne of the Tides, Ozumat swims away with Neptulon.\nNeptulon would eventually free himself.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nOzumat has not been seen since the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, but the drunk &lt;a href=\"Master%20Gunner%20Line\"&gt;Master Gunner Line&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Thresher%27s%20Wharf\"&gt;Thresher's Wharf&lt;/a&gt; claims to have killed him singlehandedly. Ozumat shows up, despite the claim, in &lt;a href=\"Nazjatar\"&gt;Nazjatar&lt;/a&gt; where he can be seen peering in through the waterwall with a few &lt;a href=\"Abyssal%20Megrim\"&gt;Abyssal Megrim&lt;/a&gt;s.\nDungeon journal.\n\"Tales of the monstrous kraken that terrorize &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s high seas were once relegated to myth... but no longer. By some ill means, the naga have bent Ozumat - the patriarch of all kraken - to their will and unleashed him against &lt;a href=\"Neptulon\"&gt;Neptulon&lt;/a&gt; and his followers.\"\nAbilities.\nStage One: Filthy Invaders!\nPlayers begin this encounter by talking to Neptulon, then agreeing to defend him while he attempts to cleanse the waters surrounding him. If Neptulon dies, the encounter will reset. Stage one lasts 60 seconds.\nStage Two: The Beast Returns.\nWhen stage two begins, three Faceless Sappers jump into the room from the ceiling and begin to channel on Neptulon. Ozumat then swims in attaches himself to the room, but he is unattackable during this stage. Killing all three Faceless Sappers ends this stage.\nStage Three: Tidal Surge.\nStage three begins when the three Faceless Sappers are destroyed. Ozumat begins to inject his blight into the entire room, and becomes attackable. When Ozumat reaches less than 10% of his remaining health, Ozumat retreats and the players win.\nTactics.\nThe encounter consists of three phases. During phase 1, three different types of adds spawn, and must all be tanked and killed; the murloc packs are AoE'able, while the faceless adds require single-target damage. Interrupts on the casters are beneficial here. After a certain amount of adds have been killed, Phase 2 will begin.\nIn Phase 2, three faceless sappers appear and begin channeling a spell at Neptulon; DPS must kill those sappers. The tank must pick up and kite the Blight Beasts that spawn through this phase, taking care not to kite them through the other party members. Ozumat makes an appearance in this phase, spewing Blight of Ozumat at random party members, leaving a blighted area on the ground that people should move out of. The phase ends once all three faceless sappers have been killed; Neptulon purifies the waters, granting everyone a +health, +damage, and +regeneration buff. The Blight Beasts should be killed at this point.\nPhase 3 is a DPS race: Ozumat must be driven off before Blight of Ozumat, now cast at the entire room, stacks to the point of being unhealable. This is generally the phase you wish to use DPS cooldowns on. Ozumat will capture Neptulon and retreat when his health has been reduced enough. A chest called &lt;a href=\"Neptulon%27s%20Cache\"&gt;Neptulon's Cache&lt;/a&gt; will be left behind, containing loot for the encounter.\nQuotes.\nThat vile beast has been driven off, but my precious waters have been tainted!\nI must cleanse them at once.If you insist on lingering here, prepare to defend yourself.\nWe are ready!\nSpeculation.\nDespite antagonizing both the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to &lt;a href=\"Neptulon\"&gt;Neptulon&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt; forces, Ozumat may not be acting of his own accord - his will was apparently \"bent\" by the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

{"id": "391651", "revid": "5625905", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=391651", "title": "Pacifist Challenge", "text": "The Pacifist Challenge is a popular challenge of gameplay where one must level a character in very unusual circumstances. This challenge is not regulated as much as the &lt;a href=\"Ironman%20Challenge\"&gt;Ironman Challenge&lt;/a&gt; and the only rule is no killing.\nThe most important thing to remember is this is a self-challenge, not a competition. \nApproaches.\nAs a rule, even very first quest requires killing. Hence the pacifist abandons the usual game flow and needs to think that else could be done. One of the first approaches may be to explore the territory. Discovering a new area gives more or less same amount of points as killing a mob. It is important to learn to avoiding mobs and evading from the battle. Normally you cannot just run away from the mob in combat, but applying something like early available &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Torrent\"&gt;Arcane Torrent&lt;/a&gt; may help to evade. Running towards guards to seek protection may be acceptable, if the mob just runs away after seeing them. For the 1-10 level characters and mobs in front of the level 80 guards, this is often the case. Later in the game, there are some means of fighting that do not kill (traps, etc). They may be useful even for a pacifist. \nYou may also decide that destroying something that is not alive is not killing. For instance, &lt;a href=\"mechanical\"&gt;mechanical&lt;/a&gt; mobs are very obviously machines (&lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt;s are somewhat more questionable). Of course, thinking only makes sense if you play on your own. If you join the pacifist community, you must follow the rules of that community - often even destroying the ice sculpture may count as kill, because this increments the kill count as visible via WOW API.\nThere are also many quests that require to find or collect something. However somebody who never killed may not be entitled to take such quests. For instance, if the Blood Elf refuses to kill these &lt;a href=\"Mana%20Wyrm%20%28mob%29\"&gt;Mana Wyrms&lt;/a&gt; (the first quest to do), there are no other task even after reaching the level 3 via alternative means. If quests are not accessible, it may be possible to raise some money by selling the own gear and clothes.\nFinally, since professions become available (level 5 required), it is possible to learn a gathering profession and travel around by just collecting resources. From this point the progress may become more sustainable, even if many resources may be much more difficult to approach if you cannot fight with the mobs nearby.\nWhile there is no strict rule \"never be killed\" with this playing approach, using death as a way to achieve something (evade, for instance) degrades the game into comedy, so may be better to think how to get without this.\nIf you want to be listed in some \"pacifist community website\", beware of the possible additional rules (no own death, no buffs, etc.)"}

Unfortunately, there was &lt;a href=\"Vandros\"&gt;a loyal noble&lt;/a&gt; to Azshara in his &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Farondis\"&gt;court&lt;/a&gt; that gave word to her. In a frightening display of &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; power Azshara remotely destroyed the Tidestone, releasing a wave of dark energy over all of &lt;a href=\"Azsuna\"&gt;Azsuna&lt;/a&gt; that shattered the region and cursed its citizens to live on as &lt;a href=\"ghost\"&gt;ghost&lt;/a&gt;s.\nLegion.\nTen millennia later during the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the Tidestone was stolen by &lt;a href=\"Tidemistress%20Athissa\"&gt;Tidemistress Athissa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Parjesh\"&gt;Warlord Parjesh&lt;/a&gt; so that Queen Azshara herself could restore it for her own purposes.

It was used in the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt; to open a gigantic rift within the ocean and around &lt;a href=\"Nazjatar\"&gt;Nazjatar&lt;/a&gt;, trapping the forces of the Alliance and Horde in Queen Azshara's domain. The power of the Tidestone also kept a vengeful &lt;a href=\"Neptulon\"&gt;Neptulon&lt;/a&gt; at bay, just as it did the sea. The Tidestone was kept at the &lt;a href=\"Tidal%20Conflux\"&gt;Tidal Conflux&lt;/a&gt;, in front of the &lt;a href=\"Gate%20of%20the%20Queen\"&gt;Gate of the Queen&lt;/a&gt;. The Alliance and Horde used one of the &lt;a href=\"Javelins%20of%20Suramar\"&gt;Javelins of Suramar&lt;/a&gt; to destroy the ward around the Tidestone. Afterward, &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"First%20Arcanist%20Thalyssra\"&gt;First Arcanist Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt; used the stone's power to open the path to the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Palace\"&gt;Eternal Palace&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpeculation.\nThough &lt;a href=\"Children%20of%20Nar%27thalas\"&gt;Children of Nar'thalas&lt;/a&gt; only says that Azshara \"released a wave of dark energy over all of Azsuna and its inhabitants\" causing the citizens of &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Nar%27thalas\"&gt;Nar'thalas&lt;/a&gt; to live on as ghosts, the Tidestone's destruction seems to have also caused a massive &lt;a href=\"ley-line\"&gt;ley-line&lt;/a&gt; explosion that radiated outward from the stone's location under Nar'thalas Academy, as well as a massive inland tsunami some time before the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt; made the area near the ocean at all (indeed, the &lt;a href=\"El%27dranil%20Shallows\"&gt;El'dranil Shallows&lt;/a&gt; seem to be at least in part a watery blast crater). &lt;a href=\"Drowned%20Student\"&gt;Drowned Student&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Drowned%20Instructor\"&gt;Drowned Instructor&lt;/a&gt;s haunt the ruins, seemingly killed by drowning and not the dark energies directly. The damage to the &lt;a href=\"Ley-Ruins%20of%20Zarkhenar\"&gt;Ley-Ruins of Zarkhenar&lt;/a&gt; also lines up with the sundered ley-line at the stone's location, though with undamaged land in between."}

Her marriage was arranged at birth in order to give her family a place in the Stormwind &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Nobles\"&gt;House of Nobles&lt;/a&gt;. While she and Varian initially disliked each other, they eventually became inseparable. Tiffin helped Varian control his occasional anger issues and taught him economics, while Varian helped teach Tiffin about politics and social etiquette. &lt;a href=\"Vellcinda%20Benton\"&gt;Elsie Benton&lt;/a&gt;, one of the kitchen servants, recalled the queen to be not just a great beauty, but also very kind.\nShe eventually came to be beloved by the people, and was the strongest supporter of paying the &lt;a href=\"Stonemasons%27%20Guild\"&gt;Stonemasons' Guild&lt;/a&gt; the initially agreed-upon sum. When Tiffin was attempting to calm the rioting stonemasons, sadly, she was killed by a rock thrown, an event which drove Varian into a deep depression. The effects of her death were felt keenly throughout the entire city. Varian vowed to punish those responsible and dealt with the rioters more severely. The Stonemasons, fleeing the city, hid in the rural areas of Westfall to escape prosecution. Knowing Varian's anger would never fade, many were forced to remain in hiding.\nHer death left a deep impact on Varian. During Varian's time as the gladiator Lo'Gosh, Varian saw a vision of Tiffin while he meditated in the &lt;a href=\"Pools%20of%20Vision\"&gt;Pools of Vision&lt;/a&gt;. Tiffin warned Varian that his people and his son needs him, which spurred Lo'Gosh to return to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"War%20Against%20the%20Nightmare\"&gt;War Against the Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;, Tiffin, alongside their son Anduin, acted as one of Varian's nightmares.\nAccording to Varian, when he and his son visited Tiffin's final resting place after the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, Anduin (who stated his belief that love outlasted \"everything\") was in fact the person Tiffin loved most of all, and he shared many of the same qualities as his mother, such as the art of gentle persuasion, and her sincere love which moved the world.\n&lt;a href=\"Tiffin%20Ellerian%20Wrynn%20Memorial\"&gt;Memorial to Tiffin&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe memorial was written by Varian.\nApperance.\nTiffin was a beautiful woman with fair skin, hip-length golden blonde hair and big blue eyes. Her son, Anduin, looks a lot like her. As a member of royalty, she wore long dresses of white and gold tones."}

She is always accompanied by her &lt;a href=\"ohuna\"&gt;ohuna&lt;/a&gt; companion, &lt;a href=\"Altan\"&gt;Altan&lt;/a&gt;, and is well-versed in reading omens from &lt;a href=\"Ohn%27ahra\"&gt;Ohn'ahra&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nTigari and her clan traveled to &lt;a href=\"Maruukai\"&gt;Maruukai&lt;/a&gt; to attend the &lt;a href=\"Khural\"&gt;Khural&lt;/a&gt; with the other clans. After arriving to the city with &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Shikaar\"&gt;Clan Shikaar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ohn%20Seshteng\"&gt;Ohn Seshteng&lt;/a&gt; went to Tigari to speak with her about a troubling omen she'd received from &lt;a href=\"Ohn%27ahra\"&gt;Ohn'ahra&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s helped them clarify the omen, revealing that Ohn'ahra was in danger of a betrayal. Tigari joined &lt;a href=\"Khanam%20Matra%20Sarest\"&gt;Khanam Matra Sarest&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sansok%20Khan\"&gt;Sansok Khan&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"krutal\"&gt;krutal&lt;/a&gt; during Sarest's meeting with the &lt;a href=\"green%20dragonflight\"&gt;green dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;'s emissary &lt;a href=\"Gemisath\"&gt;Gemisath&lt;/a&gt;. Sarest agreed to honor the ancient pact between the &lt;a href=\"Maruuk%20Centaur\"&gt;Maruuk&lt;/a&gt; and the green dragons, but &lt;a href=\"Balakar%20Khan\"&gt;Balakar Khan&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Nokhud\"&gt;Clan Nokhud&lt;/a&gt; interrupted the meeting by revealing his allegiance with the &lt;a href=\"Primalists\"&gt;Primalists&lt;/a&gt; and killing Gemisath. After adventurers saved the city from Balakar's forces, Sarest told Tigari and Sansok to prepare their clans for war and ordered Clan Ohn'ir to find Ohn'ahra so that Sarest could obtain her blessing, blow the &lt;a href=\"Horn%20of%20Drusahl\"&gt;Horn of Drusahl&lt;/a&gt;, and ally with the green dragons.\nUnbeknownst to Tigari, the Nokhud had lured many of the Ohn'ir into an ambush at &lt;a href=\"Ridgewater%20Retreat\"&gt;Ridgewater Retreat&lt;/a&gt; several days prior using a false summons presented as being from the khan herself. Tigari traveled to Ridgewater Retreat and met up with the mystics who'd survived the Nokhud attack. She sent her companion &lt;a href=\"Altan\"&gt;Altan&lt;/a&gt; to investigate reports of an outsider working with the Nokhud, but the bird did not return. Tigari was soon joined by &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s and by her anxious apprentice &lt;a href=\"Boku\"&gt;Boku&lt;/a&gt;. The khan told them that they needed to delay the Nokhud to buy time for Sarest's plan. Tigari sent the adventurers to take back totems stolen by the Nokhud and find Altan, who'd been captured by the outsider: the Primalist &lt;a href=\"Shela%20the%20Windbinder\"&gt;Shela the Windbinder&lt;/a&gt;. Tigari then left with the survivors to rally the rest of Clan Ohn'ir while sending Boku and the adventurers to find Ohn'ahra at &lt;a href=\"Windsong%20Rise\"&gt;Windsong Rise&lt;/a&gt;. Before parting ways, Tigari told the anxious Boku that she had faith in him.\nOhn'ahra was ultimately captured by the Primalist leader &lt;a href=\"Koroleth\"&gt;Koroleth&lt;/a&gt;. Shortly after, &lt;a href=\"Scout%20Tomul\"&gt;Scout Tomul&lt;/a&gt; arrived in Maruukai to tell the khans that the Nokhud had attacked the &lt;a href=\"Horn%20of%20Drusahl\"&gt;Horn of Drusahl&lt;/a&gt;. Sansok warned that it might be a diversion. Sarest agreed and decided not to commit all the Maruuk's forces, instead going with the adventurers to confront the Nokhud herself. She ordered Tigari and Sansok to prepare their clans to march on &lt;a href=\"Nokhudon%20Hold\"&gt;Nokhudon Hold&lt;/a&gt; once Ohn'ahra had been found and the green dragons had been summoned. Shortly after, Sarest told Tomul to inform the khans about a change of plans: instead of heading to Nokhudon Hold, they would march to the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Gardens\"&gt;Emerald Gardens&lt;/a&gt; and join the dragons against the Primalists. After the Primalists were defeated in the &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Scar\"&gt;Storm Scar&lt;/a&gt;, the green dragon &lt;a href=\"Merithra\"&gt;Merithra&lt;/a&gt; invited the khans to join her at the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Bough\"&gt;Ancient Bough&lt;/a&gt;, where they held a ceremony to empower the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Oathstone\"&gt;Emerald Oathstone&lt;/a&gt; and renew the ancient pact between dragons and centaur through an exchange of ceremonial gifts. Tigari's gift, representing Clan Ohn'ir, was &lt;a href=\"Ohuna%20Feather\"&gt;a feather&lt;/a&gt; from Altan\u2014a substitute for a feather from Ohn'ahra, who was still held captive by the Nokhud."}

They are said to have been hunted into extinction.\nLike their distant &lt;a href=\"nightsaber\"&gt;nightsaber&lt;/a&gt; cousins, tigers are renowned for their razor-sharp claws, incredible agility, and love of being scratched behind the ears.\nConsidered to be lucky, tigers carved of jade are prized, but taming a jade tiger itself is an even greater prize. A rarely seen family of tigers, many believe (perhaps incorrectly) that some residual magic or other event is responsible for the unique color of the zipao tiger.\nHistorians claim that &lt;a href=\"Reins%20of%20the%20Swift%20Spectral%20Tiger\"&gt;spectral tigers&lt;/a&gt; were created when &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; exploded, unleashing energies that warped the world's flora and fauna.\nThe blood from the prowler tigers in &lt;a href=\"Talador\"&gt;Talador&lt;/a&gt; is sometimes added into elixirs as a coagulant and can be used in combination with &lt;a href=\"Snapdragon%20Frond\"&gt;snapdragon fronds&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Riverhopper%20Eye\"&gt;riverhopper eye&lt;/a&gt; to create a resurrection potion. Tiger blood can also be used as a pigment. &lt;a href=\"Daggle%20Bombstrider\"&gt;Daggle Bombstrider&lt;/a&gt; asks &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to gather tiger blood for her, intending to sell it on the black market after spreading a rumor about how it improves muscle or adds potency to &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; summoning spells. &lt;a href=\"Far%20Seer%20Mok%27thardin\"&gt;Far Seer Mok'thardin&lt;/a&gt; asks adventurers to gather a pristine tigress fang for him to use in a powerful enchantment. &lt;a href=\"Linzi%20Hewstrike\"&gt;Linzi Hewstrike&lt;/a&gt; claims that people often request heavy leather or rough hides from her, but thinks that they would also appreciate if she had softer material such as tiger or &lt;a href=\"panther\"&gt;panther&lt;/a&gt; fur. The &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"jungle%20troll\"&gt;trolls&lt;/a&gt; use the hides of &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt; tigers to create blankets, armor, and tents.\nIn the RPG.\nThese &lt;a href=\"big%20cat\"&gt;great cats&lt;/a&gt; stand more than 3 feet tall at the shoulder and are about 9 feet long.

It has a 10% chance to trigger while using a two-handed weapon, and a 5% chance to trigger while dual wielding.\nHistory.\nMists of Pandaria.\nTiger Strikes originated in &lt;a href=\"Patch%205.0.4\"&gt;Patch 5.0.4&lt;/a&gt; as a passive ability for Windwalker monks that would had an 8% chance on each &lt;a href=\"attack\"&gt;attack&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"proc\"&gt;proc&lt;/a&gt; a 50% attack speed buff and 4 extra attacks. The ability remained unchanged throughout &lt;a href=\"Mists%20of%20Pandaria\"&gt;Mists of Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; and was a minor tool in the Windwalker kit.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Patch%206.0.2\"&gt;Patch 6.0.2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Warlords%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Warlords of Draenor&lt;/a&gt; made the ability available to all monk specializations (except Mistweavers in &lt;a href=\"Stance%20of%20the%20Wise%20Serpent\"&gt;Stance of the Wise Serpent&lt;/a&gt;) and redesigned to use the new &lt;a href=\"multistrike\"&gt;multistrike&lt;/a&gt; stat. In this version, the ability had an 8% chance (5% while dual-wielding) to proc off both attacks and multistrikes, and would give the monk a 25% multistrike buff for 8 seconds.\n&lt;a href=\"Patch%206.2\"&gt;Patch 6.2&lt;/a&gt; increased the multistrike buff to 35% but also changed the ability so it would only proc off of attacks--multistirkes could no longer trigger the effect. This change primarily benefited Brewmaster monks (who did not ordinarily focus on multistrike) by increasing their self-healing potential through &lt;a href=\"Gift%20of%20the%20Ox\"&gt;Gift of the Ox&lt;/a&gt;. It had a more negative effect on Mistweavers and Windwalkers, which due to their emphasis on increasing their multistrike anyway would not gain additional procs and uptime of the effect through their multistrikes."}

They were seemingly founded by a man only referred to as \"the Tiller\".\nFaction description.\n\"The Tillers are peaceful and productive pandaren, working with the land to feed the massive appetites of their people.\"\nPlayer-operated farm.\nThe Tillers have a quest chain that leads to the farming mini-game. By becoming business partners with &lt;a href=\"Farmer%20Yoon\"&gt;Farmer Yoon&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Sunsong%20Ranch\"&gt;Sunsong Ranch&lt;/a&gt;, who has plenty of knowledge but lacking in physical experience, the player can earn the right to farm the ranch, through &lt;a href=\"phasing\"&gt;phasing&lt;/a&gt;, to plant seeds for cooking ingredients. Upon reaching Revered (Note that level 90 is not required), you may also plant special seeds that produce profession materials. All faction increases and dailies with the Tillers revolve around using the farm and improving it, or helping out your new neighbors. Unlocking Sunsong Ranch will also unlock the &lt;a href=\"Tillers%20Shrine\"&gt;Tillers Shrine&lt;/a&gt;, another way to check your standing with individual Tillers, and a visual indicator of how many votes you've gotten for the two of you to join the Tillers.\nOnce you have unlocked four patches of soil with Farmer Yoon's quests, you can plant whatever seeds you can buy, and grow a plant that will become Ripe when daily quests reset. At level 90, harvesting a plant gives a small amount of reputation. For Vegetables, unless the next day is a bountiful time for a certain crop (you can pay &lt;a href=\"Jogu%20the%20Drunk\"&gt;Jogu the Drunk&lt;/a&gt; to see what that will be), or your plant becomes big and Plump, you will get five ingredients from one seed. A bountiful day will give you seven instead, and a Plump crop will give you three extra (Note you can have a plump bountiful crop). Also, harvesting vegetable crops have a 50% chance of producing 1-3 seeds of that crop, and there is a rare chance to get a Tiller gift (see Known members further down). There is also the chance that your seed will immediately grow into a Bursting plant, which can be harvested right away and can give extra if its currently a bountiful day for that crop (As predicted the day before).\nNaturally, budding crops need care, whether from pests (big or small), weeds, or just making sure that the plant is healthy. As Yoon will show you, his grandpa's &lt;a href=\"Vintage%20Bug%20Sprayer\"&gt;Vintage Bug Sprayer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rusty%20Watering%20Can\"&gt;Rusty Watering Can&lt;/a&gt; can assist you with some of this. Other solutions will require a more hands-on approach, something an experienced adventurer is more than equipped to deal with. If you're not sure what to do about a status problem, Yoon can be asked for specific advice. With the problem out of the way, one only needs to wait until their Growing crop is ready for harvesting. However, if you plant something that you later want to get rid of for whatever reason, the &lt;a href=\"Dented%20Shovel\"&gt;Dented Shovel&lt;/a&gt; can help you dig up the Growing plant and have that spot ready for another crop.\nReaching different levels of reputation with the Tillers will unlock a short questline to expand your farm, and a local NPC will then spend 15 minutes to upgrade the ranch by clearing another quarter section of the field. This clearing requires you to be online for it to progress. Each upgrade will give you four more patches of soil to farm. Yoon will mail you a letter to remind you that an upgrade is available, along with a &lt;a href=\"Basic%20Seed%20Pack\"&gt;Basic Seed Pack&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe first opportunity to do so will be upon reaching Honored, which &lt;a href=\"Gai%20Lan\"&gt;Gai Lan&lt;/a&gt; does by clearing weeds with his weed sprayer. The second is at Revered, at which &lt;a href=\"Fish%20Fellreed\"&gt;Fish Fellreed&lt;/a&gt; will repair the Broken Wagon (and unlock the story of how it got that way), which also clears the weeds around it, and sets it beside the road. The third is at Exalted, at which &lt;a href=\"Haohan%20Mudclaw\"&gt;Haohan Mudclaw&lt;/a&gt; will bring over his &lt;a href=\"mushan\"&gt;mushan&lt;/a&gt; beast &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20%28mushan%29\"&gt;Thunder&lt;/a&gt; to repeatedly ram the Mossy Boulder until it's destroyed.\nThe first and second upgrades to the farm have no special requirements beyond reputation and level 90. The third upgrade to the farm requires that Yoon and you be members of the Tillers, which requires you to have gotten all 5 votes.\nWhen each of the three quarter sections of the field are cleared of certain obstacles, kits can be bought from &lt;a href=\"Gina%20Mudclaw\"&gt;Gina Mudclaw&lt;/a&gt; to make working the farm faster. By clearing the weeds, then fixing the Broken Wagon, and then removing the Mossy Boulder, you will unlock an irrigation kit, an anti-pest system, and a plow, respectively.\nKnown members.\nMany members of the Tillers track their individual friendliness level with adventurers, shown on their gossip windows. Such members have a preferred gift and food that will increase the adventurer's standing with them. The gifts can be found randomly in &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Soil\"&gt;Dark Soil&lt;/a&gt; piles all over the &lt;a href=\"Heartland\"&gt;Heartland&lt;/a&gt;, while their food can be created with Zen-level &lt;a href=\"Cooking\"&gt;Cooking&lt;/a&gt;.\nEach member will have a daily to turn in food, in a stack of five. Gifts can be given at any time to any member, but giving preferred gifts will reward more reputation.\nTo give all ten members of the Tillers their preferred meal each day, the following ingredients are required, ordered by quantity:\nConspicuously absent from the list of cooking specializations above is &lt;a href=\"Way%20of%20the%20Brew\"&gt;Way of the Brew&lt;/a&gt;. However, Jogu offers various quests requiring the Way of the Brew as you progress through his reputation.\nOther members of the Tillers track standing based on the overall faction and not individually:\nCouncil.\nThe Tillers Union is controlled by five council members, each with their own duties and responsibilities. &lt;a href=\"Haohan%20Mudclaw\"&gt;Haohan Mudclaw&lt;/a&gt; heads the council, but most major decisions are voted on. The council members are:\nIt would appear that controlling council members may appoint a replacement for themselves at their own discretion, though likely only members of the Tillers Union may be considered for the job.\nNPC locations.\nWhen the NPCs are not visiting the market you can find them on this map:\nReputation ranks.\nIn addition to the main Tillers reputation, your character has friendship reputation with each major Tiller NPC. There are six levels of Friendship reputation; the first five require 8400 rep to advance:\nChee Chee, Ella and Sho each have short, personal questlines to do once you become Buddies, which advance when you reach higher levels of friendship. Only Jogu is the exception at Acquaintance, as going through his utilizes leveling the Way of the Brew. Chee Chee needs help finding his prized sheep Sheepie, Ella is too shy to ask the other Tillers for help with her dream of becoming a top-notch brewer, and Sho assigns you to eliminate threats to the farmers in the Valley.\nUpon reaching Best Friend, you'll no longer be able to hand in cooking or &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Soil\"&gt;Dark Soil&lt;/a&gt; items to the NPC (as there would be no point). Once you become Best Friends with all 10 Tillers, the special seeds available from &lt;a href=\"Merchant%20Greenfield\"&gt;Merchant Greenfield&lt;/a&gt; at Revered will replace the Tiller gifts looted from food crops."}

Timber Lords have existed for a long time, and predates World of Warcraft. They are a Hero class that is unavailable to the majority of players.\nThe reason Blizzard said Death Knights were the first \"Hero Class\" is because they didn't know of the Timber Lords, but in Warlords of Draenor Saurfang revealed it to them, and demanded that they created Timber Lord NPCs as a tribute to his grand work. \nTimber Lords will generally only attack trees, but may attack others if provoked. Luckily, as they are invisible to most due to their permanent stealth passive, and level cap of 30 levels above what players can achieve(it has been like this since the original game), you rarely see them. Timber Lords are among the deadliest foes in existence, and is matched only by Saurfang himself, and, to Saurfang's annoyance, Crowley. But apart from that, Timber Lords are the deadliest combatants in Warcraft, and can easily beat Sargeras in an arm wrestling competition(a statement which is based on fact).\nThe first Saurfang fact was created by a Timber Lord in Saurfang's honor, and has been on Saurfang's friendlist ever since.\nLittle is known about Timber Lord abilities, but it is known that their class consists of a DPS spec, a Tank Spec, and a Tree-Killing Spec(which is extra good at killing trees).\nThe only motive of the Timber Lords is to seek out and chop down as many trees as they can, and as such, they have their own PvE content, which generally consists of killing trees.\nThe Timber Lords have luckily been forbidden by Saurfang to chop down Nordrassil, but they did at some point chop down Teldrassil, which is the true reason for the tree being destroyed. It is rumored that Teldrassil was part of a Timber Lord-specific world event, in which Corrupted Teldrassil was a boss. The reason no players ever witnessed this, is because the game was released for the Timber Lords several months before it went live for the rest of the world."}

Its body has a vaguely humanoid shape, standing four feet high and weighing around 50 pounds. They do not speak or understand any known language.\nThey are normally peaceful creatures that live in harmony with the land, but any sort of disruption (such as pollution) drives them into an unnatural frenzy. An angered timberling attacks anything that moves. Timberlings can be made peaceful again only by removing the source of their discomfort and returning the land to its natural state. A symptom of the timberling's current disease are tumors within their bodies, filled with &lt;a href=\"poison\"&gt;poison&lt;/a&gt;.\nTimberlings attack by forming their woody limbs into fist-like appendages. When they strike a foe, they leave behind a clump of shoots that expand rapidly, enhancing weaknesses in the victim's defenses. Timberlings attack the nearest enemy, pummeling until the foe stops moving.\nSpeculation.\nBog beasts?\nTimberlings may be a sub-category of bog beast, as it is said there are bog beasts on Teldrassil near Lake Al'Ameth."}

The Kabal take their corrupted mana, turn it into tattoo ink and get ornate, detailed designs tattooed on their bodies, which not only mark one's dedication to the organization, but can also serve as a handy nightlight or a massive reservoir of power if a member ever find themselves in a situation where they need a little extra push of mana to cast a powerful spell. As many of the faction's potions are highly unstable, with some possibly even being powerful enough to level all of Gadgetzan, the Kabal use enchanted chains to keep them stabilized."}

Kadavan developed a device to carry out this feat, which Ragnok used to enslave a number of nether dragons. When the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragon\"&gt;blue dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tyrygosa\"&gt;Tyrygosa&lt;/a&gt; resisted the device, Ragnok threatened to kill Kadavan for his failure until the ethereal reminded him that he only promised that the device would ensnare nether dragons, which it had. In response, Ragnok ordered Kadavan to improve the device so as to capture Tyrygosa as well. Kadavan readily complied.\nDuring Ragnok's attempt to seize the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, Tyrygosa captured Kadavan and demanded to know how to shut off the device and free the captive nether dragons. Kadavan eagerly agreed in exchange for his own life, but before he could explain how to disable it &lt;a href=\"Jorad%20Mace\"&gt;Jorad Mace&lt;/a&gt; destroyed the device. Kadavan explained that though the nether dragons were now free, the device's destruction would cause the collars affixed to the dragons to rapidly siphon away their energy and kill them unless they found a suitable source of power to sustain them until the collars burned out. Tyrygosa opened a portal to &lt;a href=\"Coldarra\"&gt;Coldarra&lt;/a&gt; and called the nether dragons to follow her to the &lt;a href=\"Nexus\"&gt;Nexus&lt;/a&gt;; Kadavan, still held fast in her claws, went helplessly along.

After &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20invasion%20of%20Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;the fall of Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, Kael'thas led what remained of his people, the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;sin'dorei&lt;/a&gt;, in the service of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20resistance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. Striving to placate his people's addiction to &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;, he later covertly allied with &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, but betrayed him to the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; when its master, the &lt;a href=\"demon%20lord\"&gt;demon lord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;, enticed Kael with the promise of salvation for the blood elves.\nHe was branded a traitor after his allegiance to the Legion was revealed, losing the support of Quel'Thalas. Defeated in the &lt;a href=\"Tempest%20Keep\"&gt;Tempest Keep&lt;/a&gt;, he would be brought back by his demon masters and return to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider%20%28Magisters%27%20Terrace%20tactics%29\"&gt;shadow&lt;/a&gt; of his former self. Kael'thas' purpose was to summon Kil'jaeden through the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;, but his plans were foiled by the &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Sun%20Offensive\"&gt;Shattered Sun Offensive&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;agents&lt;/a&gt; and the sacrifice of &lt;a href=\"Anveena%20Teague\"&gt;Anveena Teague&lt;/a&gt;. He was defeated by their forces in &lt;a href=\"Magisters%27%20Terrace\"&gt;Magisters' Terrace&lt;/a&gt;.\nHis soul was confined to the plane of &lt;a href=\"Revendreth\"&gt;Revendreth&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt; for his many sins, such as his massive pride and how his pact with the Legion corrupted his people who he was meant to protect. However, his sins became a tool for Sire &lt;a href=\"Denathrius\"&gt;Denathrius&lt;/a&gt;, who brutally tortured Kael to create more anima for himself. After being &lt;a href=\"Sun%20King%27s%20Salvation\"&gt;rescued&lt;/a&gt;, he was taken to &lt;a href=\"Sinfall\"&gt;Sinfall&lt;/a&gt; where his true repentance could begin under the tutelage of &lt;a href=\"The%20Accuser\"&gt;The Accuser&lt;/a&gt;. Since then, he has become a valuable ally of the &lt;a href=\"Venthyr%20Covenant\"&gt;Venthyr Covenant&lt;/a&gt; in the war against &lt;a href=\"the%20Jailer\"&gt;the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;. He found and worked with his old ally, &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Vashj\"&gt;Lady Vashj&lt;/a&gt;, (now a member of the &lt;a href=\"Undying%20Army\"&gt;Undying Army&lt;/a&gt;) to hunt down the Jailer's &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt; infiltrators.\nKael'thas serves as one of the protagonists (later antagonist) in \"\" and the secondary antagonist in . He returned as a supporting character in .\nBiography.\nDalaran.\nThe only son of &lt;a href=\"Anasterian%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Anasterian Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;, king of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, Prince Kael'thas was also a powerful &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; and member of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Six\"&gt;Six&lt;/a&gt;, the shadowy high council of the Kirin Tor. Though he spent much of his time in Dalaran, he occasionally returned to Silvermoon. On one such visit, he was invited to hear the musician &lt;a href=\"Lirath%20Windrunner\"&gt;Lirath Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; perform at one of &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Saltheril\"&gt;Lord Saltheril&lt;/a&gt;'s parties at &lt;a href=\"Saltheril%27s%20Haven\"&gt;Saltheril's Haven&lt;/a&gt;; the prince was so impressed with Lirath's music that he became Lirath's patron, moving the musician into Silvermoon's Artists' Quarter and finding him an apprenticeship. Lirath would later be appointed Royal Musician. At one point Kael'thas briefly considered courting Lirath's older sister, &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas&lt;/a&gt;, but she made it clear she wasn't interested after inadvertently embarrassing Kael'thas at a &lt;a href=\"Remembrance\"&gt;Remembrance&lt;/a&gt; ball.\nSometime before the Second War, Kael'thas took an issue with the human &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller\"&gt;Nathanos Marris&lt;/a&gt; being admitted to the &lt;a href=\"Farstriders\"&gt;Farstriders&lt;/a&gt;, and sent a letter to Quel'Thalas demanding that Sylvanas dismiss Nathanos from the ranger corps. Despite this opposition, however, Sylvanas persisted, and her response was simply that Nathanos would be a loyal ally.\nShortly before the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, he and the other members of the high council questioned &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; about the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s and the events in &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt; that led to the death of &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;. Two years later, Kael'thas alongside &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Krasus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Antonidas\"&gt;Antonidas&lt;/a&gt; battled against &lt;a href=\"Death%20knight%20%28Old%20Horde%29\"&gt;death knights&lt;/a&gt; who came to steal the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Dalaran\"&gt;Eye of Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;. However, the death knights escaped with the help of the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;. The elven prince failed to save his colleague and friend &lt;a href=\"Sathera\"&gt;Sathera&lt;/a&gt; from the undead knights.\nDespite his status as both Quel'Thalas' royal prince and his place on the Council of Six, Kael'thas proved himself an approachable individual and quickly took to &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Lady Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;. His charm and \"perfectly\" handsome features impressed the young &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer\"&gt;sorceress&lt;/a&gt;, though his regality and her longing for &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Prince Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; had her rebuke his advances - such as traveling to visit the beautiful &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;elven&lt;/a&gt; homeland, &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, where magic was even more commonplace than &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;. Arthas, in turn, came to view the older Kael with jealousy. Later, Arthas himself was to visit Dalaran to study, and Jaina began a relationship with him. Kael'thas did not take kindly to this, and upon discovering it simply feigned mild surprise that Arthas would be so secretive about having a woman such as Jaina.\nKael'thas was opposed to the notion of upkeeping the &lt;a href=\"internment%20camp\"&gt;internment camp&lt;/a&gt;s, viewing the orcs' inability to control their dependency on &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; blood as a testament to their lack of formidability as a people. This brought him into conflict with Antonidas, Jaina, and Arthas, who had come to believe that sentient individuals - lethargic or not - should be shown mercy and that the orcs were not beyond salvation.\nThird War.\nAs a member of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Six\"&gt;Council of Six&lt;/a&gt;, Kael was present when &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; was expelled from Dalaran.\nAfter a dramatic turn of events, the treacherous Prince Arthas ravaged his own homeland and led an attack on Quel'Thalas. His brutal conquest of the elven kingdom resulted in the utter destruction of &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt;, the defiling of much of the high elven forests, the tainting of the legendary &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt; (thus forcing a withdrawal-based lethargy on the elves), the total slaughter of around 90% of the high elven race, and the killing of Kael's father, King &lt;a href=\"Anasterian%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Anasterian Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;.\nKael'thas learned of this while in Dalaran, and a remorseful &lt;a href=\"Jaina\"&gt;Jaina&lt;/a&gt; attempted to console him. Kael'thas lashed out at her, berating her for her relationship with such a butcher, and made one final allusion to the fact that she had chosen such a monster over him. Cursing &lt;a href=\"humanity\"&gt;humanity&lt;/a&gt;, viewing himself as a fool for ever assuming that humans could aid him, Kael'thas stated that his people had thus been reborn, by the blood of those who are forced to serve her \"beloved\" in death. With his father gone, Kael'thas knew that leading his people was now his duty alone.\nKael'thas abandoned Dalaran to its fate and rushed to the aid of his people. Once he entered the forests, Kael sent &lt;a href=\"Rommath\"&gt;Rommath&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;, to inform the elves about the coming of their prince.\nKael'thas arrived in Silvermoon to an icy reception. His prolonged absence had been noted, and the populace was downtrodden, fearing the prince would abandon them. Kael first met with Lor'themar, who had rallied the elves in his absence, and was shown to the body of his father. Kael performed a &lt;a href=\"Thalassian\"&gt;Thalassian&lt;/a&gt; blessing and told his father that he was lost without him; that Anasterian was the king, not him. He asked his father for the strength to lead their people forward and watched that night as Anasterian was cremated on a funeral pyre.\nKael'thas made no excuses for being absent in Quel'Thalas' darkest hour. He resolved to prove himself to the elves and do whatever he could to rebuild their kingdom. It was hard as he had always felt distant from his people. They were largely insular and isolationist and he was quite the opposite. He wanted to see the world, interact with other races and learn new ideas. Despite this, he loved his people and kingdom.\nKael'thas then left to observe the defiled &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt; and witnessed the dark, twisted energies pulsating from it. Fearing a further catastrophe upon the elves and the land, and an attack of the Amani trolls, Kael'thas rallied a group of volunteers to destroy the corrupted Sunwell. He took three mooncrystals with him to this end, all three of which survived the sealing of the Sunwell, albeit &lt;a href=\"Verdant%20Sphere\"&gt;altered&lt;/a&gt;. Kael took them into his possession thereafter. Though he had saved his people from continued exposure to the dark energy, the destruction of the Sunwell resulted in a withdrawal-based lethargy for the elven race.\nKael'thas renamed his shattered people \"&lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;\" in honor of their fallen brethren and resolved to see Quel'Thalas shine once again.\nThough King Anasterian had removed Quel'Thalas from the Alliance prior to the undead onslaught, Kael rejoined what was known as the \"&lt;a href=\"Alliance%20resistance\"&gt;remnants of the Alliance&lt;/a&gt;\" battling the Scourge in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. Though this alliance was Kael's best bet for vengeance upon the Scourge, he came under the bigoted scrutiny of its prejudiced leader, &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Marshal%20Garithos\"&gt;Grand Marshal Garithos&lt;/a&gt;, who had long despised the elves.\nKael'thas took a number of his most powerful followers to join the Alliance resistance, though the majority of his people remained behind in Quel'Thalas. Kael'thas commanded the great ranger, &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;, to safeguard the shattered elven kingdom, to protect their exhausted people, and to keep what remains of Quel'Thalas untainted from the Scourge. As such, Kael appointed Lor'themar as regent lord. Before leaving, he took his family's shattered runeblade &lt;a href=\"Felo%27melorn\"&gt;Felo'melorn&lt;/a&gt; into his possession, planning to one day reforge it into a symbol of hope and power his people could again be proud of - a reminder that even in the face of overwhelming hardship, the blood elves would not be broken. In time, Kael'thas succeeded, and the mighty royal blade was reforged.\nKael'thas officially decreed that his father would be the last king of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, leaving the crown unclaimed.\nThe hunt for Illidan.\nFollowing the destruction of &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;, Kael began to notice an emptiness within himself and his brethren, an insatiable hunger and disharmony. However, there was no time to deal with that, as Kael had other duties.\nKael and his soldiers were stationed in the &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt; when a disturbance began to rile up the undead in and around &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;. They had begun to raid the outposts Kael had established, so he gathered up his forces to seek refuge in the relative safety on the other side of the &lt;a href=\"River%20Arevass\"&gt;River Arevass&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs he was loading the supply wagons, he was met by two unexpected strangers, &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;. These night elves had pursued &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; for three days across the sea. Kael guessed that perhaps Illidan was behind the disturbances at Dalaran, and when he told them his tale, Tyrande immediately offered her assistance, thinking that he could help them track down Illidan. Maiev believed it to be a waste of time but reluctantly agreed. With the protection of the night elves and their &lt;a href=\"mountain%20giant\"&gt;mountain giant&lt;/a&gt; allies, Kael quickly made his way to Pyrewood Village to retrieve his buried supply caches. As they gathered more reinforcements, Maiev asked Kael where the rest of his brethren were, and he told them of the destruction of Quel'Thalas. Tyrande empathized but warned that vengeance and rage were not a pleasant road to walk.\nAs they arrived in Pyrewood, the undead were lying in wait and ambushed the &lt;a href=\"caravan\"&gt;caravan&lt;/a&gt;. Kael, Maiev, Tyrande, and their forces battled off the first attackers, but as the second wave advanced, they realized that the caravan would never survive another assault. Maiev and Kael rushed the caravan across the bridge, while Tyrande stayed to fend off the undead alone. As she called upon the powers of Elune to protect her, the bridge fell away, and Tyrande was swept down the river. Kael wanted to pursue her, but Maiev stopped him, saying that she was a warrior and knew the risks. Maiev then demanded that Kael honor their bargain, and help her capture Illidan.\nKael and Maiev tracked Illidan to Dalaran, where Kael's scouts found him performing a strange ritual with a mysterious gem. &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; came and told them that Illidan's spell was using the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Eye of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; to break &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; apart. Immediately, they advanced upon his location, while Kael defended their bases from the voracious undead. After freeing the &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Magroth%20the%20Defender\"&gt;Magroth the Defender&lt;/a&gt; from the Naga, he pledged to help them. When Illidan's spell was interrupted, Malfurion approached his brother and condemned him for his part in Tyrande's death. Kael, perplexed, suggested that it was premature to assume she was dead and was vehemently silenced by Maiev.\nMalfurion, realizing he had been duped, left Maiev entangled in vines while he and Illidan set off to save Tyrande. Maiev eventually freed herself and set off in pursuit, while Kael'thas was left in the ruins of Dalaran.\nThe rise of the blood elves.\nKael found the Grand Marshal &lt;a href=\"Othmar%20Garithos\"&gt;Othmar Garithos&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, who dismissed his story of the night elves as a fanciful excuse. Garithos, Kael's commanding officer, harbored a poorly-hidden disdain for all non-human races. Garithos informed Kael that a strikeforce was &lt;a href=\"Misconceptions\"&gt;encroaching&lt;/a&gt; on Dalaran and that he was going to head them off at the mountains. Kael was quick to volunteer his assistance, but Garithos had other plans. He explained that a second force was believed to be approaching from the east and that the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Observatory\"&gt;arcane observatories&lt;/a&gt; needed repairs so that they could be used to spot them. Kael did as ordered, but when he came to &lt;a href=\"Lordamere%20Lake\"&gt;Lordamere Lake&lt;/a&gt;, he found the &lt;a href=\"shipyard\"&gt;shipyard&lt;/a&gt; ruined, and had no route across the water. &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Vashj\"&gt;Lady Vashj&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; witch, soon arrived to offer her aid, citing their common ancestry. Vashj gave him boats, which Kael used to ferry his troops to the outlying observatories.\nWhen Garithos returned from the front, he condemned Kael for consorting with the naga, despite the prince's assurances that they were not a threat to the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. Garithos warned Kael that he would not tolerate treason before leaving Kael to keep things in line at Dalaran. An &lt;a href=\"Garithos%27%20Emissary\"&gt;emissary&lt;/a&gt; sent by Garithos arrived the next day with further orders, reporting that the observatories had detected an undead force in the west. Kael was to defeat them, though the emissary also recalled his foot soldiers, cavalry, and support teams to the front lines. Kael was left with only his fellow elves to aid him, and the undead were quick to overtake the outposts across the river. Once again, Lady Vashj arrived with her naga, and though Kael was wary of accepting her offer, she insisted that without her help, he and his brethren would surely fall. Realizing that it would be impossible to survive without these reinforcements, Kael accepted, and together they defeated the undead.\nAfter the battle, Kael told Vashj about how his people felt an emptiness ever since Quel'Thalas was destroyed. Vashj explained to Kael that just like the naga, his people were addicted to magic. Without the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt; to give them a constant supply of magical energies, they would surely suffer a fatal withdrawal. Kael heard Garithos approaching, and bid Vashj to flee, but Garithos' men saw the naga escaping and arrested Kael and his people for treason. Garithos smugly told Kael that he now had all the proof he needed to deal with him and the other elves as he felt they deserved, and he had them all imprisoned in the &lt;a href=\"Dungeons%20of%20Dalaran\"&gt;Dungeons of Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;.\nVashj crept in through the sewers of the dungeons and freed Kael, then helped him free his brethren. Vashj promised him an escape from his human oppressors through &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;'s interdimensional portal, where her master, Illidan, was waiting on the other side. As they neared the exit, Kael met his former comrade, &lt;a href=\"Kassan\"&gt;Jailor Kassan&lt;/a&gt;, who he was forced to slay in order to escape. Upon leaving the dungeons, the blood elves and naga fled through the portal Archimonde used to enter the world of Azeroth, and into a new world.\nKael found himself on the barren lands of &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;, and Vashj revealed that this &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; was once the orcish homeland of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;. They searched for Illidan for days, until Vashj caught a familiar scent on the winds. Maiev had captured Illidan and was escorting him back to her base in a prison wagon. Kael and Vashj's forces quickly rushed into the fray and battled &lt;a href=\"Maiev\"&gt;Maiev&lt;/a&gt;'s army in order to retrieve the unconscious Illidan and return him to their base, where they could undo the magical lock that kept him caged.\nIllidan was pleased with the tenacity of all his servants, new and old alike, and told them of the situation in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. To flee from his vexed master, &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;, Illidan had fled to Outland only to find it overrun by &lt;a href=\"Magtheridon\"&gt;Magtheridon&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Fel%20Horde\"&gt;Fel Horde&lt;/a&gt;, an army of &lt;a href=\"fel%20orc\"&gt;fel orc&lt;/a&gt;s, reinforced by demons arriving through &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;'s dimensional gates. Kael had hoped Illidan might be able to cure the blood elves of their addiction to magic and asked if he could help them. Illidan sadly told him that there was no cure for their condition, but promised Kael that if he joined him, he would provide the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; with enough magical energies to keep their hunger sated forever. Upon hearing this, Kael pledged his loyalty to Illidan.\nKael and Vashj protected Illidan as he went about closing the interdimensional gateways. Kael discovered a camp of &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; being assaulted by orcs and lent them his aid. He was greeted by &lt;a href=\"Akama\"&gt;Akama&lt;/a&gt;, the Elder Sage, who offered his allegiance to Illidan. Finally, the time came to assault Magtheridon's &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt;. Illidan, Kael, Vashj, and Akama all led their forces against Magtheridon's fortress, infiltrating it and finally defeating Magtheridon in his own throne room.\nAs Illidan stood triumphant, Kil'jaeden descended from the fiery sky and rebuked Illidan for his insolence in trying to hide. The demon gave him one last chance to save himself - destroy the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt;, or face his eternal wrath.\nAssault on the Frozen Throne.\nKael and his new allies returned to &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, where they were immediately met by &lt;a href=\"Anub%27arak\"&gt;Anub'arak&lt;/a&gt; and his troublesome race. Though they kept them at bay, &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt;'s forces slowly advanced on the &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt; Glacier.\nThe blood elves, thirsty for vengeance, attacked the newly arrived Arthas in a large-scale &lt;a href=\"dragonhawk\"&gt;dragonhawk&lt;/a&gt; ambush. Arthas was able to push them back, with the help of his &lt;a href=\"nerubian\"&gt;nerubian&lt;/a&gt; ally, Anub'arak, and was greeted by a familiar sight - Kael'thas, brandishing a reforged &lt;a href=\"Felo%27melorn\"&gt;Felo'melorn&lt;/a&gt;. After a heated exchange, Arthas charged the elven prince, though Kael'thas teleported out of the fray for the time being. Arthas fled into &lt;a href=\"Azjol-Nerub\"&gt;Azjol-Nerub&lt;/a&gt;, and after his ascent out of it, Kael'thas attacked him once more.\nThe two appeared to be fairly evenly matched; Felo'melorn proving an adequate counter to the mighty &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt;. However, the tides began to turn, and despite Kael's vicious assault of both powerful fire spells and Felo'melorn's precision, Kael'thas was pushed back by Arthas - the death knight empowered further by the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;'s proximity. Knowing that he could not win this battle, and forced into the snow, Kael'thas once again teleported himself away, deeming that he had bought Illidan enough time. \nKael successfully withdrew, but Felo'melorn was lost in the battle. As such, Arthas was left with only one more obstacle - Illidan himself. After fierce combat, Arthas managed to get the best of Illidan, and Illidan's twitching body was tossed to the ground. Kael and Vashj were left leaderless on the snowy slopes of &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt; as Arthas claimed his destiny. Together they took Illidan's unconscious body with them as they fled back to &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;.\nA month later, when Magtheridon was being moved to &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Citadel\"&gt;Hellfire Citadel&lt;/a&gt; he accompanied the Illidari into the fortress. A week later, &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Malande\"&gt;Lady Malande&lt;/a&gt; reported that Kael took his forces to close a Legion's &lt;a href=\"Dimensional%20gateway\"&gt;portal&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Netherstorm\"&gt;Netherstorm&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nKael'thas, together with 15% of the blood elven people, made the journey into &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; with his new allies. With the goal of finding a lasting method to sate the elven addiction, and claiming a new homeland for the sin'dorei, Kael'thas thus put his plans into motion. However, he had not forgotten about his people still in &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Rommath\"&gt;Grand Magister Rommath&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful Archmage who had served Kael'thas' ambitions faithfully, was sent back to reclaim &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; with a contingent of &lt;a href=\"magisters\"&gt;magisters&lt;/a&gt; - and to spread Illidan's teachings of draining magical power, teachings smoothly attributed by Rommath to the blood elven scion. Kael'thas named &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; Quel'Thalas' regent, to safeguard the country until the prince's return to lead their people. Emboldened by the reclamation of shining Quel'Thalas, and the prince's promises of a glorious future, the blood elves began to work towards their own great journey - to reunite with their prince in the promised haven of Outland. Rommath informed him about the possible alliance with the Horde.\nAs Illidan prepared his army of &lt;a href=\"demon%20hunter\"&gt;demon hunter&lt;/a&gt;s to assault &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;, Kael'thas became alienated. Several of his followers had left him to join Illidan to be trained as demon hunters and he believed he could harness fel magic just as they did to sate his addiction. Soon, the fel gnawed at his mind, causing him to become more paranoid of his people, believing them to think of him as a failure. Many believed that the fel magic made him unstable. He believed his travel to Outland to have been a mistake since he was no closer to finding a cure to the addiction than before and the suffering of the blood elves had only increased. He was too prideful to return to Quel'Thalas without a cure, yet also deeply ashamed and angered of his own inability to find one. In this state of emotional turmoil, the prince was contacted by Kil'jaeden. The demon lord told him of more effective ways to harness fel energy and that Illidan had withheld them from him because he did not deem them worthy, only tools in the war against the Legion. In return for teaching Kael'thas, Kil'jaeden simply asked him to abandon Illidan. The prince refused, but doubts began to plague his consciousness.\nKael'thas sent &lt;a href=\"Voren%27thal%20the%20Seer\"&gt;Voren'thal the Seer&lt;/a&gt; and his forces to attack &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt; and the newly arrived &lt;a href=\"Sha%27tar\"&gt;Sha'tar&lt;/a&gt;. Kael'thas had requested that demon hunters would join the fray, but Illidan refused him, greatly angering the prince. Before the battle even started, Voren'thal threw down his weapons and defected. This betrayal was a devastating blow to Kael'thas, as Voren'thal's ranks included some of the most gifted magisters and scholars he had led into Outland. The prince saw Voren'thals betrayal as a sign of his own failures to his people and a rift began to grow between him and Illidan that widened as the demon hunter had only eyes for his planned assault against Legion worlds. Believing that Illidan planned on abandoning the blood elves and enticed by the demon lord's promises of salvation for his people, Kael'thas turned to Kil'jaeden as his new benefactor.\nKael'thas, with some of his most &lt;a href=\"Sunfury\"&gt;powerful servants&lt;/a&gt;, claimed the magic-rich area of &lt;a href=\"Netherstorm\"&gt;Netherstorm&lt;/a&gt; as his base of operations in Outland. Displaying his long-severed ties to the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;, Kael'thas ordered the callous destruction of the local &lt;a href=\"Kirin%27Var%20Village\"&gt;Kirin'Var Village&lt;/a&gt; and its residents. Kael'thas himself claimed the citadel of &lt;a href=\"Tempest%20Keep\"&gt;Tempest Keep&lt;/a&gt; as his own and was able to overcome its powerful defenders - including a &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt;, named &lt;a href=\"M%27uru\"&gt;M'uru&lt;/a&gt;, whom Kael'thas sent back to &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt; for his people to feed upon by opening a portal with the technology of the Keep. He maintained these portals to send mana cells harvested from the Netherstorm to Quel'Thalas, still appearing as the benevolent prince.\nHis attack on Tempest Keep also led to the outmanned &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; being forced to flee in a vessel, the \"&lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt;\", though several of Kael'thas' agents were able to give pursuit. Upon the draenei vessel's crash into Azeroth itself, Kael remained in touch with his underlings and instructed them to create a portal - the &lt;a href=\"Sun%20Gate\"&gt;Sun Gate&lt;/a&gt; - capable of allowing reinforcements from Tempest Keep to arrive and slaughter the draenei.\nAs the forces of the Alliance and Horde began pouring into Outland, Kael'thas and his followers originally accepted the blood elven pilgrims. However, these new arrivals were given menial tasks and treated little better than slaves, until Voren'thal's &lt;a href=\"Scryers\"&gt;Scryers&lt;/a&gt; discovered that Kael'thas had entered into an alliance with the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; through the revelations of &lt;a href=\"Sunfury\"&gt;Sunfury&lt;/a&gt; deserters. Despite this revelation some other elves still decided to join their prince, prompting a recruitment war between Kael's forces and the Scryers.\nMany blood elves didn't want to believe the rumors that Kael'thas had pledged himself to the Burning Legion. But when they arrived at the Netherstorm, they saw the truth with their own eyes. These blood elves sent word back to Lor'themar Theron and other high-ranking elves in Quel'Thalas, who with a heavy heart came to the consensus that Kael'thalas was lost and had to be vanquished. And so, the Horde officially declared war on Kael'thas.\nDuring this time, he had in his possession one of the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity%23Vial%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Vials of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;, granted to him by Illidan, as did &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Vashj\"&gt;Lady Vashj&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Cipher of Damnation.\nThrough spying on the &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt; and their activities in &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Valley\"&gt;Shadowmoon Valley&lt;/a&gt;, Kael'thas gained the knowledge of &lt;a href=\"the%20Cipher%20of%20Damnation\"&gt;the Cipher of Damnation&lt;/a&gt;. The Cipher of Damnation was used by &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; to sunder the orcs' connection to the spirits of the land and may have been the same as (or similar to) the spell uttered by &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer-Thane%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt; when he summoned the fiery destroyer &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"A%27dal\"&gt;A'dal&lt;/a&gt; discovered the plans of Kael'thas and requested help from any able-bodied adventurers to prevent Kael'thas from ever using the Cipher of Damnation. Through their efforts the cipher was recovered, depriving Kael'thas of a powerful weapon. These brave adventurers were granted the &lt;a href=\"The%20Tempest%20Key\"&gt;key to Tempest Keep&lt;/a&gt;, and sent to dispatch Kael'thas himself.\nDefeated.\nPrince Kael'thas was ultimately cornered in his reinforced sanctuary of Tempest Keep, &lt;a href=\"Eye%20%28Tempest%20Keep%29\"&gt;The Eye&lt;/a&gt; by the Horde forces. He was defeated, though the timely arrival of &lt;a href=\"Priestess%20Delrissa\"&gt;Priestess Delrissa&lt;/a&gt; had allowed him to escape death. His image appeared in Shattrath, berating &lt;a href=\"A%27dal\"&gt;A'dal&lt;/a&gt; for not finishing the job with the same efficiency that he had claimed Tempest Keep.\nThe Sun King returns.\nDespite his defeat in Tempest Keep, Kael'thas survived the ordeal with the aid of &lt;a href=\"Priestess%20Delrissa\"&gt;Priestess Delrissa&lt;/a&gt; and continued to advance the plans of his dark masters. His appearance, however, was changed because of fel magic: his skin was sickly pale, and a crystal was lodged in his chest, and one of his &lt;a href=\"Verdant%20Sphere\"&gt;Verdant Sphere&lt;/a&gt;s is gone, having been taken by those who defeated him previously. Having collected the necessary energies from his manaforges in Netherstorm, Kael'thas returned to Quel'Thalas to reinvigorate the Sunwell - not as the source of his people's magic, but rather as the mystic portal that will allow him to summon his new master, Kil'jaeden, much as the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; was used to summon Sargeras ten millennia before. or as the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity%20%28Hyjal%29\"&gt;second Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; during the Third War was intended.\nWhile the Alliance and Horde directed their forces to the Black Temple, Kael'thas and his Legion comrades made his return to Quel'Thalas through the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, while his armies took a portal in the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Throne of Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;. He briefly assaulted &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt; with his &lt;a href=\"Felblood%20elf\"&gt;felblood elves&lt;/a&gt; to retrieve M'uru. The &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knights\"&gt;Blood Knight&lt;/a&gt; matriarch, &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt;, witnessed this herself and traveled to Shattrath - renouncing her loyalty to &lt;a href=\"Sunstrider%20dynasty\"&gt;House Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; and offering to fight alongside the Sha'tar for Silvermoon's sake.\nFollowing this, the combined forces of the &lt;a href=\"Scryers\"&gt;Scryers&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Aldor\"&gt;Aldor&lt;/a&gt; formed the &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Sun%20Offensive\"&gt;Shattered Sun Offensive&lt;/a&gt;, dedicated to ending Prince Kael'thas' dark ambitions. Kael'thas took up residence in the &lt;a href=\"Magisters%27%20Terrace\"&gt;Magisters' Terrace&lt;/a&gt;, reinforced the isle with his &lt;a href=\"Dawnblade%20%28blood%20elves%29\"&gt;last&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Shadowsword\"&gt;loyal servitors&lt;/a&gt; and Burning Legion assistance, and abducted the mortal avatar of the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href=\"Anveena%20Teague\"&gt;Anveena Teague&lt;/a&gt;, who had been placed under blood elf protection in Quel'Thalas.\nInside the Terrace, heroes assisted by &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; battled their way to the twisted prince's inner sanctum. Kael'thas made his final stand, a shadow of his former self, and was cut down by the Shattered Sun Offensive, who claimed his head. Unlike his final thoughts in Tempest Keep, he did not meet his end with a cry for his homeland upon his lips; but with raving insanity instead wished only a violent death upon his killers.\nAftermath.\nThe betrayal of Kael'thas sent shockwaves throughout the Kingdom of Quel'Thalas, and as Kael'thas was the last known member of the &lt;a href=\"Sunstrider%20dynasty\"&gt;Sunstrider dynasty&lt;/a&gt;, Regent Lord &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; has become the sole leader of the blood elves. His once noble goals for his people aside, Kael'thas is now reviled as a traitor, who attempted to sell both his people and himself to the Burning Legion. His death brought an unhappy end to the Sunstrider dynasty, casting a bitter pall over the blood elves left behind. Kael's allegiance to the Legion severely hampered blood elf relations with the other races of Azeroth, connections Lor'themar had to take steps to repair.\nIronically, Kael'thas' increasingly desperate quest to relieve his people of their addiction would ultimately bear fruit. With the \"blessing\" of the Burning Legion, his own followers were permitted to gorge themselves on colossal amounts of &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; power, thus becoming known as \"&lt;a href=\"Felblood%20elf\"&gt;felblood elves&lt;/a&gt;\" in the process. His actions in abducting &lt;a href=\"M%27uru\"&gt;M'uru&lt;/a&gt; indirectly led to &lt;a href=\"Prophet%20Velen\"&gt;Prophet Velen&lt;/a&gt; using M'uru's \"heart\" to revitalize the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt; - that had been defiled by both the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;. As such, Kael'thas' people have the Sunwell returned to them, now a mixture of both &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"holy\"&gt;holy&lt;/a&gt; power.\nRommath, who was perhaps left the most shattered of all after Kael'thas' betrayal, mentioned that Kael'thas had been buried on Quel'Danas.\nShadowlands.\nUpon his death, the &lt;a href=\"Arbiter\"&gt;Arbiter&lt;/a&gt; assigned Kael'thas' soul to the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt; realm of &lt;a href=\"Revendreth\"&gt;Revendreth&lt;/a&gt;. There, &lt;a href=\"Denathrius\"&gt;Sire Denathrius&lt;/a&gt; took him to &lt;a href=\"Pride%27s%20Prison\"&gt;Pride's Prison&lt;/a&gt; within &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Nathria\"&gt;Castle Nathria&lt;/a&gt;, not to redeem his sins but to amplify them, burdening Kael'thas with the sins of others through experiments and filling him with immense &lt;a href=\"anima\"&gt;anima&lt;/a&gt; and sins beyond what he already carried. This corruption to his &lt;a href=\"sinstone\"&gt;sinstone&lt;/a&gt; made Kael'thas' soul very strong, but also very unstable, self-destructive, and pushed to the limit of its existence, rendering him a weapon that must either be redeemed or would be cast into the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"the%20Nine\"&gt;the Nine&lt;/a&gt; showed the realms of the Shadowlands to &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, they showed her the confined Kael'thas in Castle Nathria. Sylvanas decided that the prince had earned his fate, and noted the irony that both he and &lt;a href=\"Zul%27jin\"&gt;Zul'jin&lt;/a&gt;\u2014the former leaders of two races who loathed each other\u2014were being tormented in the same realm, both unaware of each other's presence.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Accuser\"&gt;The Accuser&lt;/a&gt; chose to personally oversee Kael'thas' redemption, cleansing him of his excess sins with the help of the &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Walker\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpon learning that &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; was not only in Maldraxxus but also partially responsible for the troubles of Revendreth, in combination with his being unburdened of the sins of others, he was filled with anger and swore vengeance for Quel'Thalas. Kael'thas was part of the combined Venthyr and &lt;a href=\"Necrolord\"&gt;Necrolord&lt;/a&gt; forces that confronted Kel'Thuzad, but the archlich escaped to the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt;. Though Kael'thas' fury had not abated, he began to accept his own responsibility for failing his people.\nChains of Domination.\nKael'thas accompanied the covenant forces that invaded the realm of &lt;a href=\"Korthia\"&gt;Korthia&lt;/a&gt; and occasionally appears as a visitor in &lt;a href=\"Keeper%27s%20Respite\"&gt;Keeper's Respite&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn time, Kael'thas was reunited with &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Vashj\"&gt;Lady Vashj&lt;/a&gt; when she and the Maw Walker were sent to Revendreth by the &lt;a href=\"Primus\"&gt;Primus&lt;/a&gt; in order to deliver &lt;a href=\"The%20Unseen%20Guests%20Among%20Us\"&gt;missives&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Renathal\"&gt;Prince Renathal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Stonewright\"&gt;The Stonewright&lt;/a&gt;. As they departed, Vashj reminded Kael that they were there to hunt the &lt;a href=\"dreadlord\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt;s and told him not to join them this time.\nAs the group joined Renathal's entourage and headed towards the Stonewright, Kael'thas questioned Vashj as to why she was sent to &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxus\"&gt;Maldraxxus&lt;/a&gt; when she had no shortage of sins herself. In response, she informed him that she also had no shortage of victories and questioned if he could say the same. After the Stonewright revealed that &lt;a href=\"Chelra%20the%20Bladewall\"&gt;Chelra the Bladewall&lt;/a&gt; had been a nathrezim, Kael was stunned and remarked that he had grown too trusting in his penance. Kael, Vashj, and the Maw Walker then joined forces in hunting them down and recovering the &lt;a href=\"Medallion%20of%20Wrath\"&gt;Medallion of Wrath&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Nal%27ragas\"&gt;Nal'ragas&lt;/a&gt;, while uncovering hidden nathrezim. During their mission, Kael commented on how Illidan would have relished this and questioned Vashj as to what fate was chosen for him. Vashj merely pointed that Kael was assuming that Illidan was dead and mortal, things that she wasn't sure were true. As the mission progressed, Kael couldn't help but express regret at having allied with the nathrezim in life. Though the trio was able to track and down and kill Nal'ragas, the latter had already given the medallion to &lt;a href=\"Mal%27Ganis\"&gt;Mal'Ganis&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the Maw Walker located and challenged Mal'Ganis to reclaim the medallion, Kael'thas fought against &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Kivretan\"&gt;Lady Kivretan&lt;/a&gt;. However, after the Maw Walker killed &lt;a href=\"Gorgannon\"&gt;Gorgannon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Diathorus%20the%20Seeker\"&gt;Diathorus the Seeker&lt;/a&gt;, Mal'Ganis entered the fray, and Kael, alongside &lt;a href=\"The%20Curator%20%28venthyr%29\"&gt;The Curator&lt;/a&gt; and The Stonewright, aided in the fight by stunning Mal'Ganis with beams of anima. They were subsequently joined by Renathal, wearing the &lt;a href=\"Crown%20of%20the%20Harvesters\"&gt;Crown of the Harvesters&lt;/a&gt;, and learned that Mal'Ganis and his cohorts had been a ruse in order to allow for the successful rescue of &lt;a href=\"Sire%20Denathrius\"&gt;Sire Denathrius&lt;/a&gt;. In response, Renathal had Mal'Ganis imprisoned and in a conversation with the Maw Walker, admitted that if Kael was farther along in his penance, the prince would consider him as a new Harvester of Envy or Dread.\nWhen Kael'thas learned that &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; had been permanently destroyed at the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Sanctum of Domination&lt;/a&gt;, he expressed frustration that the kill should have been his to avenge Silvermoon. But when the Accuser asked him what it would have accomplished and if it would have changed the fate of his people, Kael faltered, expressing regret that he was not at Silvermoon when it fell, a failure that has haunted him ever since. The Accuser, now knowing that the retribution Kael sought would only be for himself and not for his people, revealed that what Kael sought was not vengeance but redemption; that for all the crimes he committed in his life, having failed to prevent &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;' fall was not one of them. She advised him to repent for all his other sins but forgive himself for the fall of his kingdom. Kael agreed, knowing that he had work to do.\nLegacy.\nKael'thas and his downfall have been referenced several times since \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;The Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;\".\n&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magus%20Telestra\"&gt;Grand Magus Telestra&lt;/a&gt;, rumored to be Kael'thas' mentor, defected from the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; when &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt; reminded her of the unfair treatment Kael received while imprisoned in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Tae%27thelan%20Bloodwatcher\"&gt;High Examiner Tae'thelan Bloodwatcher&lt;/a&gt; mentioned that the prince's statues still stand within &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt;. He used Kael as an example of past mistakes he feels his people are still living in the shadow of and states that the time has come for this to change.\n&lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; conjured a vision of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;'s past, citing Kael'thas as one of its greatest traitors. &lt;a href=\"Aethas%20Sunreaver\"&gt;Aethas Sunreaver&lt;/a&gt; likened the callous leadership of &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; to Kael's own in the prince's insanity, viewing their methods similar and their potential effect on the sin'dorei as equally catastrophic; just as the blood elves broke away from Kael'thas, Aethas believed they must heed the lesson learned from the prince's downfall, and never walk down that path again.\n&lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt; referenced Kael'thas and his betrayal to the Burning Legion when she dealt with the &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"nightfallen\"&gt;nightfallen&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt;, drawing parallels to her own people's struggles. The Nightborne leader &lt;a href=\"Elisande\"&gt;Elisande&lt;/a&gt; erroneously believed that the sin'dorei would have understood her choice to ally with the Legion when it was this very action that led them to turn against Kael'thas. Like Kael, she felt that serving the Legion would save her people; and like Kael, this decision led to her death.\nKael'thas destroying the Sunwell is experienced by blood elf players during the questline to unlock their &lt;a href=\"heritage%20armor\"&gt;heritage armor&lt;/a&gt;.\nPersonality.\nKael'thas was a cunning and powerful mage, as well as a gifted tactician and an accomplished warrior. He was hailed as a true champion of the blood elf people and a defender of their race's ancient heritage, but eventually fell prey to the dark influences of &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; while sojourning on &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, having been enticed by the demon lord with the promise of salvation for his people.\nProud and astute, the prince of Quel'Thalas could be both an amiable and a ruthless man. He proved himself approachable, but he also advocated drastic measures (such as the extermination of the lethargic orcs) that were at odds with the Kirin Tor's ethics. The prince was imposing to some and charming to others, and almost always regal and composed. The Third War's brutal aftermath had a huge effect on Kael, who would assume the mantle of leadership in his murdered father's place and find himself having to deal with the many problems his equally beleaguered people were faced with. Overcome with hatred for the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, on the receiving end of racism from the Alliance resistance, and balancing the weight of a nation on shoulders weary from the addiction ravaging his people, Kael had become a much more desperate leader by the time he left Azeroth for Outland.\nAs Kael'thas fell further into despair and addiction, his actions became much bolder and more questionable; while Kael once derided the notion of trusting demons and considered the idea of draining demonic magic to be \"madness,\" he would go on to do both himself, falling prey to Kil'jaeden the Deceiver. Following this, Kael's actions became more callous and cruel. Though judged as being on the path to madness by this point, he retained enough self-awareness to keep his dark dealings and draining of demons a secret from his people back on Azeroth, knowing most would be horrified if they knew the truth. By the time of his &lt;a href=\"Magisters%27%20Terrace\"&gt;revitalization&lt;/a&gt;, Kael, now a shadow of his former self with fel burning in his very veins, had no qualms even with attacking his own kingdom. Like fellow prince &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt;, Kael was characterized as having a thorough love for his homeland and its people; but also like Arthas, the extremes he went to for them destroyed most of what he was in the process.\nKael loved his father, &lt;a href=\"Anasterian%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Anasterian&lt;/a&gt;, but the two did not always see eye-to-eye. While Kael felt loyalty and duty-bound to the Alliance, his father rescinded his own allegiance to it, and recalled the elves to their enchanted kingdom after the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;. Kael remained in Dalaran despite this, and his father worried whether Kael'thas truly understood that it would one day fall to him to rule Quel'Thalas. Kael was left shattered by Anasterian's death and strove to make his father's memory proud.\nIn the RPG.\nKael declared that the blood elves would not let the Scourge enjoy their plunder, and planned to raze &lt;a href=\"Blackened%20Woods\"&gt;the entire forest&lt;/a&gt;. Before Kael left shattered Quel'Thalas, he managed to salvage the skull of his father, &lt;a href=\"Anasterian%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Anasterian&lt;/a&gt;, from the ruins of Quel'Thalas. The skull is among the artifacts that &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; believes would be needed to restore the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;. Illidan gave him &lt;a href=\"Black%20Plate%20of%20Kael\"&gt;black plate armor&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Felo%27melorn\"&gt;Flamestrike&lt;/a&gt; remained in his possession.\nKael was a &lt;a href=\"wizard\"&gt;wizard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"fighter\"&gt;fighter&lt;/a&gt; in the \"&lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20RPG\"&gt;Warcraft RPG&lt;/a&gt;\", which was changed to a &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt; in the \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft%20RPG\"&gt;World of Warcraft RPG&lt;/a&gt;\".\nDescription.\nPrince Kael\u2019thas was once a respected member of the Kirin Tor of Dalaran. He was an accomplished wizard and a hero of the high elf kingdom of Quel\u2019Thalas. Yet when the elven kingdom was destroyed and the high elves pushed to the edge of extinction, Kael\u2019thas and his surviving brethren grew dark and brooding. Renaming his followers the blood elves, Kael\u2019thas led them to abandon the Alliance and join forces with Illidan the Betrayer. In exchange for their loyalty, Illidan taught the blood elves how to siphon demonic energies from their enemies in exchange for magical power. Now Kael\u2019thas and his blood elves exist only to hunt demons and strip them of their powers. Though his principles and honor have been cast to the winds, the former elven hero finds his new pursuit more than adequate revenge for the loss of his beloved homeland.\nCombat.\nKael enjoys beginning a fight by summoning a phoenix or two before laying down a few flame-based attacks and then wading into melee.\nQuotes.\nShadowlands.\nGossip.\nAfter defeating &lt;a href=\"Sun%20King%27s%20Salvation\"&gt;Sun King's Salvation&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Nathria\"&gt;Castle Nathria&lt;/a&gt; or beginning &lt;a href=\"Confronting%20Sin\"&gt;Confronting Sin&lt;/a&gt;, Kael'thas has this gossip:\nStop bothering me.

At the bidding of his new master, the wayward prince returned to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and seized the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;, hoping to use the fount as a means to open a doorway for the demon to this new and verdant world. Kael'thas is a brilliant tactician, a powerful warrior, and his veins burn with limitless &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; magic.\"\nAbilities.\nI'll turn your world... upside... down.\nWhen Kael'thas Sunstrider reaches 50% remaining health he casts Gravity Lapse until defeated.\nStrategy.\nPhase 1.\nAt the start of the fight, Kael'thas will largely stick to melee, as well as throwing out the occasional Fireball. If you have no one in melee range, Kael will resort to casting spells instead. Fire Resistance isn't necessary, although a bit of it (from a Paladin Aura or a Fire Resistance Totem) will help. Kael's casts can also be interrupted so players with silencing abilities should be sure to interrupt his Fireball, and a single shaman can avoid almost all damage from fireballs by alternating grounding totem and earthshock. However, it is not possible to interrupt the Flamestrike, Phoenix, or Gravity spells. He also uses Flamestrike which is easily avoidable, but will kill you if you stand in for the initial hit. You should kill the bird and the egg before Kael'thas reaches 50%.\nManaging Phoenixes\nTen seconds after combat begins, Kael will summon a phoenix, and will continuously summon new ones every minute for the duration of the first phase. When a phoenix is out it needs to be beaten down quickly (with ranged damage), by at least two party members. The phoenix should be kited away from the tank and Kael, as it will eventually explode when it dies, dealing tremendous damage and throwing nearby players backwards. Once it dies an egg will spawn in its place, which will very soon hatch and respawn the phoenix if it is not destroyed. A total of two phoenix spawns are almost unavoidable for most groups. Take Kael to 50% to start Phase 2 \"after\" the second phoenix egg is broken; having even one phoenix up during Phase 2 is an almost guaranteed wipe.\nTo minimize the damage Hellfire causes to players that the phoenix passes, you should plan out positioning and aggro.\nPhase 2.\nPhase 2 begins when Kael'thas hits 50% health. After a few seconds, Kael'thas will cast Gravity Lapse, which will throw your entire party into the air and allow you to float freely around, much like the fight with him in &lt;a href=\"Tempest%20Keep\"&gt;Tempest Keep&lt;/a&gt;. He'll begin channeling Arcane Energy onto your entire group, which deals 300 damage every second for 30 seconds. He will also summon three Arcane Orbs, which will hit you in melee range for around 2k+. It is thus vital for your party to swim around and avoid the orbs. It is a good idea to move outward immediately, while still trying to DPS Kael'thas as much as you can. A healer with an AoE, such as a Priest, or &lt;a href=\"Heal%20Over%20Time\"&gt;HOTs&lt;/a&gt; like Druids, is tremendously helpful for this fight, whereas Paladins and Shamans will have extreme difficulty keeping an entire group alive due to the nature of their healing. There is no tanking at this point. Ranged DPS may continue firing upon Kael as opportunities present themselves, but the priority is to above all give the orbs a \"wide\" berth.\nPhase 3.\nAfter 30 seconds Kael'thas will tire and Gravity Lapse will end, giving you a few seconds to freely attack Kael without reprisal. Kael takes 50% more damage in this state. After 10 seconds, he will get back up again and re-cast Gravity Lapse (repeat Phase 2), so try and do as much DPS as you can while you have the chance. Again, tanking does nothing.\nIt is possible for classes with at least 1 healing spell (such as an Affliction Warlock) to solo the boss for the remaining 50% on both Normal and Heroic, as Kael will no longer use direct attacks. For this reason, do not assume that your group has wiped if you lose some members during the encounter. Thus as long as there are any remaining survivors, do not release your body if you die during the encounter, lest you not get credit for the kill while you return back in spirit form. Alternatively\u2014if you feel confident that the battle will last long enough, you can safely walk back, and will be transported back to the room Kael is in when he recasts gravity lapse.\nHeroic.\nIn Heroic Mode, Kael's damage with Fireballs and Flamestrikes is increased.\nAfter sixty seconds (and if still in phase 1) Kael will use the Shock Barrier ability (identical in behavior to the one he uses in Tempest Keep, and similar to the Priest in the &lt;a href=\"Maulgar\"&gt;Maulgar&lt;/a&gt; fight), which will absorb 10,000 damage. When the shield has taken the 10,000 damage, it will disappear and allow someone to interrupt the Pyroblast that he is casting. The Pyroblast will kill any tank that lacks sufficient spell damage reduction. It is very possible (especially with &lt;a href=\"Bloodlust\"&gt;Bloodlust&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Heroism\"&gt;Heroism&lt;/a&gt;) to take Kael to phase 2 before this time has elapsed, and if done he will not cast Pyroblast. Also note that the 60 second delay is perfect for a &lt;a href=\"Warlock\"&gt;Warlock&lt;/a&gt; to time a &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Doom\"&gt;Curse of Doom&lt;/a&gt; to hit during the shield, making it trivial to interrupt.\nPaladins should bubble (after he has started casting) and then use Righteous Defense on Kael's target at the last second of the Pyroblast cast to prevent all damage and save a character from certain doom. Warriors can use Shield Wall and Last Stand to survive it (Spell Reflect will not work). Druid tanks are out of luck.\nNote that the tank dying to the Pyroblast does not mean the group will wipe. Usually Kael'thas will hit 50% shortly after the Pyroblast and start phase 2. A tank is unnecessary in phase 2 since Kael does not move and does not directly attack.\nAlternative.\nPhase 1\nLine of sight the pyroblast. After interrupting a fireball, drag him over to the wall near the start, then when the pyroblast beings to cast, run around the corner, it will be canceled, and he will go back to casting fireballs. If you have no one to interrupt, tank him where he starts, and then run around to the back of the room when the pyroblast starts.\nPhase 2 &amp; 3\nSame as the other strategies. Stay away from the Orbs and DPS down Kael as much as you can. Good luck!\nAlternate Phase 2 strategy.\nThis works both in regular and heroic modes. Once phase 2 occurs, everyone should swim to the door near the ground, but not touching it as it will cause you to get shot up. Have the healer top everyone off while the orbs slowly make their way to the group. Since the group has several seconds before the orbs reach the group, this strategy works for all healer classes since the healer can remain stationary, heal, and know that everyone is within range without having to worry about the orbs' AoE damage. Once the orbs get close, have everyone swim around/above the orbs and get close to Kael'thas and start to dps. If timed correctly, the orbs will not have time to reach the group and the healer will still be able to remain stationary and heal without worrying about the orbs. Phase 3 should occur shortly and then back to phase 2. Rinse and repeat.\nHealing tips.\nPhase 1 is relatively easy to heal for any class, so long as people are not taking the damage that's avoidable (flamestirke and hellfires). Kael's burst damage, especially on Heroic, is powerful but predictable. Solicit the help of any rogues/shaman to interrupt Kael's fireballs, and if you have a warrior tank, remind him to Spell Reflect and Shield Bash as often as he can. \nPhase 2 of this fight, however, is the epitome of a Healer Check. Provided no one hits the bubbles and causes undue stress on their healer, either the healer has the skill, mana efficiency and gear to heal through the ticks, or he doesn't. Very little else is a factor in phase 2, as a good healer can technically solo Kael from 50 to 0. \nTree of Life is a good healer because it has many HoTs and many of them are instant, and this makes healers job easier at Gravity Phase.\nHoly Priests are also exceptional healers this fight once Phase 2 begins. Make frequent use of Prayer of Mending and stay close to at least one other party member. It will exhaust itself in 5 seconds, restoring a great deal of health. Spam it every time it pops. \nDuring Gravity Lapse, rely mostly on your Hots and instant cast spells. It is dangerous to stay in one place very long. If you have good +Healing, this shouldn't be a problem. \nAt the end of Gravity Lapse, use this time to top of your party with Circle of Healing, Prayer of Healing or Chain Heal, as insurance against someone touching a bubble in the next air phase. All DPS should be within range of your spells during this time.\nPrioritizing Targets in Phase 2\nA party member's death is both a blessing and a curse - while you will have less DPS on Kael, you also will have less damage to heal as Kael's Arcane Bolts will only be draining 4 members, reducing your chances of going OOM and killing everyone. Prioritize your targets as follows:\n1. Yourself\nThe healer is, by far, the most important target here - if you die, it's most likely a wipe. \n2. DPS Warriors/Rogues/Warlocks/Enhancement Shamans\nThey are non-mana dependent (or much less mana dependent) DPS, and will still be fighting at 100% efficiency, even if it goes 10 Gravity Lapses. \n3. DPS with Mana\nThey are vital, but can run out of mana. Not as important as the others. \n4. The Tank\nAfter Phase 2, the tank is no longer a factor - he's just a bad DPSer. If it's between almost anyone else, and him, let him die.\n5. OOM DPS\nAt this point, they are mana/time sinks for you. Heal them as a last resort. \nPaladin Healing\nPaladins will need to be able to squeeze every bit of healing out that they can, as they are arguably the least optimal healers this fight, with only 1 instant cast, mana inefficient heal on a cooldown, no hots and no group heal.\nIt's a good idea for Paladin healers to throw Blessing of Light on everyone during the seconds between when Kael says: \"I'll turn your world... Upside Down.\" and while being launched into the air. You will be hard pressed to heal while in the air, and will need to make the most out of each opportunity. \nUse Divine Shield if the majority of your party has fallen below 50% life, even if you are healthy. Position yourself in the middle of the room to do this. This will give you range on all your party members, and allow you to heal without fear of the bubbles for 15 seconds. \nUse Flash of Light and Holy Shock while in the air to keep as mobile as possible. You will be amazed at how fast bubbles can creep up on you if you try for Holy Light. Save Holy Light for when Gravity Lapse ends, as you will want to top everyone off before the next Gravity Lapse.\nIf you use Divine Shield just before Kael casts Gravity Lapse you will not get thrown into the air. This makes it significantly easier to heal your party as you can move faster while on the ground as well as avoiding the couple of seconds it takes to re-orient yourself when thrown into the air.\nLoot.\nAs of patch 2.4.2, Kael can drop a &lt;a href=\"Primal%20Nether\"&gt;Primal Nether&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Note: Kael'thas drops BOP versions of many Outland recipes. These recipe drops are BOP, even if the recipe is normally a BOE world drop. They can only be looted by people who need the recipe and will not be seen unless someone in the group needs it.\nQuotes.\nUsed when Kael'thas tired from Gravity Lapse, this was a placeholder quote during the earliest phases of public testing:\nSound files.\nSee \"&lt;a href=\"PlaySoundFile%20macros%20-%20Eastern%20Kingdoms%20instance%20sounds%23.C2.A0Kael.27thas%20Sunstrider.C2.A0.3CLord%20of%20the%20Blood%20Elves.3E\"&gt;Sound files of Eastern Kingdoms: Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;\"\nGains.\nAfter killing this NPC you will gain:"}

It's a very interesting fight with five phases. Phases 2 and 3 are &lt;a href=\"DPS%20race\"&gt;DPS race&lt;/a&gt;s, while 4 and 5 are one big &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20survival\"&gt;Battle for survival&lt;/a&gt;. Overall, many veteran raiders consider this to be one of the most challenging and most enjoyable boss encounters in the whole of &lt;a href=\"The%20Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;The Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;.\nAbilities.\nKael'thas, his advisors, and the phoenixes are immune to &lt;a href=\"Taunt\"&gt;Taunt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Crowd%20Control\"&gt;Crowd Control&lt;/a&gt; and all &lt;a href=\"snare\"&gt;snare&lt;/a&gt; or slow effects. The Weapons are susceptible to all of these effects.\nThe advisors enter Phase 1 with half of their normal HP. After they are resurrected for Phase 3 they are at full health.\nRaid composition.\nThis fight favors ranged damage dealers because there are mobs which are highly dangerous for melee (Thaladred and Capernian), and the Phoenix eggs are much easier killed by ranged (only 15 sec time to do 70k damage), melee lose too much time running to the egg.\nStrategy.\nPhase 1: Introducing the Advisors.\nThe raid can leisurely kill each advisor. To make phase 3 easier, each advisor should be killed in a pre-planned location.\nThe advisors engage in the following order:\nPhase 2: The Weapons.\nAfter all advisors are dead, Kael'thas summons his arsenal of seven legendary weapons. By killing and looting these weapons all raid members can equip themselves with legendary weapons for the rest of the fight (the weapons are multi-drop but unique; one player can theoretically pick up one copy of each). Killing the weapons is a mixture of AoE and focus fire. There should be an AoE kill zone, where most of the weapons are held, while the remaining DPS concentrate on one weapon after the other. Here's an overview of the weapons in a reasonable kill order:\nHas a Multi-Shot attack, drops aggro if any melee or pet attack it. Preferably tanked by a hunter facing it away from the raid to avoid Multi-Shot hitting others. This is the most dangerous weapon and should be killed first by all hunters and ranged DPS which do not take part in the AoE.\nLow melee damage, attacks with Frostbolt and Frost Nova. It likes to cast a Frost Nova, run away 10-15 yards and then start to Frostbolt. It's a highly desirable item because its \"use\" ability grants immunity to the Remote Toy debuff, and it increases the damage output of casters. It also has low HP and dies faster than the other weapons.\nLow melee damage. Heals itself and friendly targets, which must be interrupted. The melee damage dealers should control and kill this first.\nHits normal but attacks very fast. Has a Thrash ability (similar to Prince Malchezaar's phase 2 ability) that grants it two extra attacks.\nHits for 1-1.5K every 2s on plate. Applies a stacking Rend DoT. Each stack ticks for an additional 500 damage every 3s for 15s; the Rend attack that applies the DoT can miss, be dodged or parried.\nFrequently Whirlwinds, which one-shots any non-tanks. Must be tanked slightly away from the other weapons, near the edge or even outside the AoE zone. Not very useful for most raid members, therefore it's not a problem if it doesn't die quickly.\nDoes high damage. Has a \"shield spike\"-like ability which when activated can reflect a lot of damage to a fast attacking melee DPSer. Also has much higher HP and armor than the other weapons. The tanks can manage phase 3 without it, but they must absolutely have it to tank Kael'thas in phase 4.\nWeapon tank list:\nThe weapon corpses despawn after 60 seconds, and the looted weapons disappear 15 minutes after being looted. Players also lose them when releasing (after a death) or when the encounter is reset.\nIt's not a big problem to have two weapons alive (e.g. the and ) when phase 3 starts.\nAlternative strategy.\nSome guilds believe that managing to get all weapons down before phase 3 is the basis for a perfect Kael'Thas kill. Suggested raid composition for this is 3 tanks 6 healers and 16 DPS players. The DPS composition should include at least 2 hunters, 3 mages and 3 warlocks.\nAs soon as the weapons spawn the main tank should grab the axe. The bow should be tanked by 2 hunters. The staff should be tanked by your off tank (A good position is behind Kael'Thas). A paladin tank can and should tank all the other weapons.\nThe Two hunters should be left alone to kill the bow. The mages and warlocks should start by nuking the axe. The Melee should take care of the staff very very fast. As soon as the staff is down the DPS you have assigned to the axe should change their focus to the group of weapons tanked by the protection paladin regardless if the axe is down or not (it will be finished later by the hunters). Additionally they should proceed in good order to loot the Staff one by one (if all of them rush to get it then the AoE on the group of weapons will be too low to take them down in time). At the same time the melee should focus on the cosmic infuser which will now be tanked by the tank that was on the staff (assign a rogue or two to stop it from healing).\nAs soon as the two hunters finish with the bow they should proceed to loot it and then finish off the axe (hence freeing the main tank for phase 3)\nThe AoE group should by now have started their AoE (with at least 40 seconds remaining). The moment the cosmic infuser comes down the tanking paladin should move a few yards back to allow the healers to loot easily at this point melee and the mace tank should nuke the shield.\nThe AoE should continue non stop with the addition that the mages and warlocks should now target the Phaseshift Bulwark (shield) and cast any instant spells they have (such as fire blast or a curse) so the can hasten the downing of the shield.\nEach time a weapon goes down the tankadin should move another 3 yards backwards to allow for easier loot.\nThe last two weapons that will go down are the Infinity blade and warp slicer (in that order). Two rogues and possibly a DPS warrior or an enhancement shaman should loot the infinity blade to use it in the mind controlled of the raid during phase 4.\nIf you have followed this tactic then the last weapon should go down just about the moment phase 3 starts. Such a smooth handling of weapons is the half of a very smooth performance in phase 3 and hence a very promising phase 4 and 5.\nPhase 3: All Four Advisors.\nExactly two minutes after the start of Phase 2, Kael'thas resurrects all the advisors at once. The advisor tanks and their healers should start to move to their assigned advisors (or rather their corpse) about 10 seconds before the end of Phase 2, so that they can immediately pick up the advisors.\nAdvisor tank list:\nKill order.\nAs before, Thaladred and Capernian should be avoided by melee. All four advisors can be safely attacked by ranged. Since Thaladred is the biggest nuisance, ranged DPS should concentrate on him first. One melee damage dealer with the should put the debuff on him, but very carefully - the player must be highly aware of imminent gaze shifts, move away *before* each shift, and get back in only when some other person gets the gaze.\nAll other melee damage dealers should concentrate on Sanguinar first and Telonicus second.\nAfter Thaladred is down, ranged DPS can either help the melee group at Sanguinar, or start on Capernian. This decision mainly depends on whether the melee group is strong enough to kill Sanguinar on their own, or the ranged DPS have to help.\nWhen all other adds are down, Telonicus is finished off last by all damage dealers together.\nAlternative strategy.\nSince all of your tanks are now free and all of the weapons are down, the melee and your Main tank should head to Sanguinar (One healer needed and a CoH priest for the melee group). \nOne of your off tanks must tank Telonicus the engineer (one or two healers needed) and one of your warlocks tank Capernian (one healer needed - preferably a paladin in the group with the warlock for the fire resistance aura). That leaves one healer for the ranged DPS group (preferably a resto shammy or a CoH priest)\nKill Thaladered with your ranged DPS as fast as possible and then proceed to Sanguinar.\nAs soon as Sanguinar is down, the melee group and their healers should proceed to kill Telonicus. \nThe Ranged DPS should then start with Capernian (you should have approximately 1 min left before phase 4) and kill her.\nAs soon as Capernian is down everyone should move and finish off Telonicus (don't forget to rebuff the tanking warlock with salvation). The main tank should take position in front of Kael'Thas. Telonicus should be down just as Kael comes out to play. \nYou are now in a very good position to do a very clean Kael'Thas kill. The rest of this strategy (phase 4 and 5) is the same with the \"classic\" one.\nPhase 4: Kael'thas Sunstrider.\nThree minutes after the start of Phase 3, Kael'thas himself enters the fight. If only one advisor is still up at that point, a smooth kill is close. If two or more are still up, a wipe is highly probable.\nFireball should be interrupted as much as possible.\nMind Controlled raid members should best be sheeped. It's also possible to use the with low damage skills (e.g. Hamstring, Shiv) to dispel the MC. Stunning is not always effective because the buff from the may be in effect. In addition to that hunter freezing traps must be set randomly on the ground, and all kinds of fears should and must be used when Kael is mind controlling your raid members. This will solve a lot of problems and it will improve the reaction time of your mages. (Decursive add on is a must for mages here)\nFlamestrike MUST be avoided at all costs by everyone in the raid. Set Spell Details to High to see the glow on the ground, which is visible during the 3 sec cast time before it hits. The AoE looks similar to a Paladins Consecration.\nEvery 30\u201340 seconds Kael'thas summons a Phoenix. The graphic effect for this summon is identical to Flamestrike, however the cast time is much shorter, and it deals no damage.\nPhoenix handling.\nAfter its birth, the phoenix can either be &lt;a href=\"kite\"&gt;kite&lt;/a&gt;d by a ranged damage dealer, or simply be tanked by the fire resist tank (it melees for ~800 on plate). It continually uses a hellfire ability which damages itself (5% HP) and everybody around it for ~5,000 fire damage per 2s tic, resulting in an (at most) 40 second life span. Upon its death, it will do an Ember Blast (4,500 fire damage melee range knockback, binary resist) and then turn into a Phoenix egg. This egg has ~70k HP and must quickly be killed, else it spawns a new Phoenix after 15 seconds.\nPyroblast.\nEvery 60 seconds Kael'thas casts an invariable sequence of Shock Barrier, 3 successive Pyroblasts and Arcane Disruption.\nEven with all the possible mitigations in effect, Pyroblast deals up to 23,265 fire damage. Tanks with the can use it to absorb one Pyroblast. If the damage dealers are up to it, the best course of action is to burn down the shield fast enough to interrupt the second pyroblast. Failing this, a tank with ~20k HP can just barely survive one pyroblast (with the Infernal Protection buff from the , a &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Protection%20Potion\"&gt;Fire Protection Potion&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Nightmare%20Seed\"&gt;Nightmare Seed&lt;/a&gt; and PW:Shield). If a raid consistently fails to interrupt the second pyroblast, it's possible to have the tank eat the first one and absorb the second. This gives the healers enough time to bring the tank up to survive the immediately following arcane disruption. The third pyroblast can always be interrupted, because the shock barrier autmatically wears off after 10 seconds, which leaves a 2 second window for the interrupt.\nEvent Cycle.\nIn summary, there's a 60 second rotation which takes place over the entire phase:\n[0sec]-&gt;[20sec](MC + Arcane Disruption)-&gt;[40sec](Phoenix + MC + Arcane Disruption)-&gt;[60sec](Shock Barrier + 3 Pyroblasts + Arcane Disruption).\nFlamestrike can happen all the time.\nPhase 5: True Power.\nOnce Kael'thas' health reaches 50%, he does a short cutscene and becomes invulnerable for a while. During this time, all remaining Phoenixes and their eggs should be killed. With unlucky timing it's possible that he reaches 50% just as he begins a pyroblast cycle, and thus become invulnerable (and truly uninterruptible) while casting 3 pyroblasts. Although this is a rare event, it doesn't hurt to pay attention to this possibility, and slow down some DPS if it could occur.\nGravity Lapse.\nIn Phase 5, he no longer uses Mind Control and Pyroblast, instead he regularly casts a combination of Gravity Lapse, Nether Vapor and Nether Beam. Gravity Lapse teleports the entire raid to Kael'thas' position and up in the air from there. In order to avoid the Nether Vapor debuff and Nether Beam chaining, the raid must move away from Kael and spread out, best in three dimensions. Near the end of the 30 sec duration, people should try to keep close to the ground to minimize falling damage, but must not get too low, else they take damage and get launched back up high in the air.\nKael'thas continuously uses Shock Barrier during a Gravity Lapse, and the phoenixes go into a kind of evade mode. There's no point in trying to deal damage during that time.\nAt the end of a Gravity Lapse, Kael'thas and the phoenixes return to their prior targets, there's no aggro drop. Mages should &lt;a href=\"Counterspell\"&gt;Counterspell&lt;/a&gt; Kael's first Fireball so that he runs to the MT. The raid should initially be careful with DPS because the tank needs to build some rage first. This is a good opportunity to burn down the phoenix and his egg.\nEnrage.\nKael'thas has no built-in hard enrage timer. The only problem is that the legendary weapons looted in phase 2 despawn 15 minutes after acquiring them. It's possible to bring him down using normal equipment, but the Arcane Disruptions cause the healers to run out of mana sooner or later.\nNotes.\nIt is a good idea to use &lt;a href=\"Heroism\"&gt;Heroism&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Bloodlust\"&gt;Bloodlust&lt;/a&gt; prior to Phase 4, so that Kael'thas can't buff himself when mind controling a shaman. Some raids prefer to go all-out at the start of Phase 2, others wait until Phase 3.\nSoloing Kael'thas.\nEven at level 90, using the legendary weapon buffs will be necessary. Specifically, the staff's immunity to stuns, silences, and disorients. \nSave cooldowns for phase 3. In phase one, start the encounter, then run to the southern end of the room to drag Thaladred and Sanguinar as far away as possible when phase 3 starts. Thaladred must still be kited, as the 8-yard-radius fear will hit high-level players. Kill Capernian where she spawns (by Kael), then drag Telonicius down to where the other two are before killing him.\nIn phase two, single-target the shield, the longbow, then the infuser, then AoE all of the rest of the weapons. Equip the staff and use it's ability to gain immunity to stuns, silences and disorients. The staff must remain equipped or the buff will be lost.\nIn phase three, stand near where Capernian's corpse is, and quickly pop cooldowns to blow her up before the other three close the gap. Kill Sanguinar next (for the AoE fear), then Telonicus (for the stun debuff), then kite around and kill Thaladred. Feel free to swap back to normal weapons once the advisors are dead and all debuffs have worn off (like Telonicus's Remote Toy).\nPhases four and five are straightforward, but make sure to get out of the Flamestrike area of effect before it lands. However, any pet-using classes should dismiss their pets at the start of phase four, and classes that can call temporary pets (such as mages' Mirror Image) should refrain from doing so against Kael himself, as he can cast Mind Control on the player; the player will then attack his pets until they are dead, and the encounter will be considered as wiped and come to an end and reset.\nEven when winning seems in your grasp, beware. Several nether clouds will appear around Kael now and then at the end of the fight, stacking a debuff which can one-shot kill you if ignored. If you can avoid these, you'll be fine by this point.\nLoot.\nKael will drop the &lt;a href=\"Verdant%20Sphere\"&gt;Verdant Sphere&lt;/a&gt;, three Tier 5 helm tokens, and three other pieces of loot. Any players on the quest &lt;a href=\"The%20Vials%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;The Vials of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; will also individually see &lt;a href=\"Kael%27s%20Vial%20Remnant\"&gt;Kael's Vial Remnant&lt;/a&gt;.

He first appears alongside the &lt;a href=\"Timewalkers\"&gt;Timewalkers&lt;/a&gt; investigating the &lt;a href=\"Timeless%20Isle\"&gt;Timeless Isle&lt;/a&gt;, where he enlists players in helping create an &lt;a href=\"Vision%20of%20Time\"&gt;artifact&lt;/a&gt; that can peer into other timeways. He plays a pivotal role in the events of \"\".\nKairoz is affiliated with a faction of discontent bronze dragons that believes they should change history to create a better future, despite having &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Mortals\"&gt;lost the power&lt;/a&gt; to perceive the full impact these changes could have on the timeline. Kairoz believes in the motivations of the &lt;a href=\"Infinite%20Dragonflight\"&gt;Infinite Dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, but has his own viewpoint and plans independent of the Infinites, &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt;, or Wrathion.\nBiography.\nThe Timeless Isle.\nKairoz first appeared at the &lt;a href=\"Celestial%20Court\"&gt;Celestial Court&lt;/a&gt;, where he and a contingent of &lt;a href=\"Timewalkers\"&gt;Timewalkers&lt;/a&gt; were carrying out an investigation on the mysterious properties of the &lt;a href=\"Timeless%20Isle\"&gt;Timeless Isle&lt;/a&gt;, a place where both the flow of time and causality have halted. There he befriended &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, and tasked the player with helping him empower and refine an artifact of his own creation: the hourglass known as the &lt;a href=\"Vision%20of%20Time\"&gt;Vision of Time&lt;/a&gt;.\nOver the following weeks, the player used the hourglass to witness visions of the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; and two potential futures: one in which Kairoz observed the aftermath of &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;'s defeat from afar, and another in which Garrosh has destroyed &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Harbor\"&gt;Stormwind Harbor&lt;/a&gt; and murdered those who opposed his reign.\nKairoz then directed the player to use the hourglass at a crux of intersecting timeways in the cellar of the &lt;a href=\"White%20Tiger%20Temple\"&gt;White Tiger Temple&lt;/a&gt;, where it showed a vision of Anduin visiting an imprisoned Garrosh. With the artifact nearly complete, Kairoz hesitantly asked the player to take the hourglass to the &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt;. There, the player experienced a final vision in which Kairoz stood over the slain body of &lt;a href=\"Soridormi\"&gt;Soridormi&lt;/a&gt;, the prime consort of &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt;. Kairoz bid the player to tell no one of these potential futures lest they alter the course of time, and vowed to complete the Vision of Time to learn what the future truly holds.\nThe trial of Garrosh Hellscream.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, Kairoz secretly sent a message to &lt;a href=\"Zaela\"&gt;Zaela&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt; and tasked her with gathering up &lt;a href=\"Shokia\"&gt;Shokia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thalen%20Songweaver\"&gt;Thalen Songweaver&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Harrowmeiser\"&gt;Harrowmeiser&lt;/a&gt;. He later provided her and the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Infinite%20dragonflight\"&gt;Infinite dragon&lt;/a&gt; mounts.\nDuring the trial of Garrosh Hellscream, Kairoz and his fellow bronze dragon &lt;a href=\"Chronormu\"&gt;Chronormu&lt;/a&gt; introduced the Vision of Time as a means of providing hard facts about past events without relying on possibly incorrect memories. Kairoz worked with &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; throughout the trial, while Chromie worked with &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;.\nNear the end of the trial, Kairoz tinkered with the Vision of Time in order to further &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt;'s agenda. Chromie grew suspicious of Kairoz's actions, so he locked her in a cage to prevent her from interfering. As the trial reached its end, Kairoz summoned multiple alternate timeline versions of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s heroes that fight their original counterparts, causing chaos in the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20White%20Tiger\"&gt;Temple of the White Tiger&lt;/a&gt; and distracting everyone while he activated the Vision of Time and escaped with Garrosh through a time portal. This action broke the Vision of Time, and Kairoz was only able to take a small fragment through the portal with him.\nJourney to Draenor.\nKairoz brought Garrosh to &lt;a href=\"Draenor%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;alternate Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, thirty-five years in the past, where they watched from a hilltop as led a band of &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s through .\nKairoz revealed that he had brought Garrosh to a timeway similar to the past of their own, but \"not a perfect mirror image.\" In order to blend in, he transformed himself into an orc. Believing that Azeroth isn't strong enough to take on the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; alone, he explained that his plan was for Garrosh to help him gather the orcs into a &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;new Horde&lt;/a&gt; and bring it to Azeroth to fight against the Legion. However, Kairoz was not satisfied with just one Horde free of demonic taint: he wanted to cultivate an infinite number of Hordes drawn from all the timeways. His fatal error came when he turned his back on Garrosh, who immediately stabbed Kairoz to death with the shard of the Vision of Time.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20in%20Draenor\"&gt;war in Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, Kairoz's body can be found in the &lt;a href=\"Time-Lost%20Glade\"&gt;Time-Lost Glade&lt;/a&gt; in . He is located by &lt;a href=\"Chromie\"&gt;Chromie&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;, and an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;; Kairoz's spirit, still thinking he is facing Garrosh, battles them, and is killed.\nIn World of Warcraft.\nQuests.\nThe following quests serve as introduction to the &lt;a href=\"Timeless%20Isle\"&gt;Timeless Isle&lt;/a&gt;\nVisions.\nEach week, Kairoz tasks the players with gathering 50 &lt;a href=\"Epoch%20Stone\"&gt;Epoch Stone&lt;/a&gt;s to empower the &lt;a href=\"Vision%20of%20Time\"&gt;Vision of Time&lt;/a&gt;, and sends them to use the hourglass to reveal visions of events occurring in the present, future, or a possible alternate future.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;\nQuotes.\nJust look at this place! An entire ecology secluded, cut off from all known timelines!\nIt is rare for one such as I to be surprised by, well, anything really. I shall relish every moment I spend here.\nSpeculation.\nDue to his implied involvement in the murder of Nozdormu's consort and affiliation with the group of dissenters within the Bronze dragonflight, there is a strong possibility that Kairozdormu is the catalyst that eventually leads to the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Infinite%20dragonflight\"&gt;Infinite dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;. A further piece of evidence is that shortly before Garrosh killed him, Kairoz proclaimed: \"We will be limited by nothing. Not even time. The possibilities are infinite. I will become infinite\u2014\"\n&lt;a href=\"Micky%20Neilson\"&gt;Micky Neilson&lt;/a&gt; clarified that Kairoz is a believer in what the Infinite dragonflight was even if it's not around. He has his own viewpoint more so than anything involving the Infinites or Nozdormu.\nIt is uncertain whether Kairoz's plans to cultivate an infinite number of Hordes from Draenor, as well as forces from Azeroth and other worlds, would have been successful. &lt;a href=\"Aman%27thul\"&gt;Aman'thul&lt;/a&gt; stated that there is only one true timeline, and some alternate timeways seem to become unstable and eventually threaten to collapse after outside interference, as was the case with &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;'s journey through the Caverns of Time. Furthermore, Chronicles Vol. 3 also seems to emphasize that interference in alternate timeways is not a natural or desirable thing, and that usually most of these timeways eventually fade by themselves. The game itself, however, tends to contradict this point, as does some commentary from developers, which seem to regard the alternate timelines as inevitable and constant. Additionally the commentary of cosmic beings is suggested by the broker Firim to be biased towards the power they embody, so Aman'thul's view may simply represent that of Order's rather than the actual way of things.\nAs Kairoz stated that there is a traitor among his allies, he was probably speaking about himself in the future as he released Garrosh Hellscream from his trial."}

{"id": "242970", "revid": "46586549", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=242970", "title": "Kaja'mite", "text": "Kaja'mite is a type of ore found primarily beneath &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Kajaro\"&gt;Mount Kajaro&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Kezan\"&gt;Kezan&lt;/a&gt;. It can also be found on the &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Isles\"&gt;Lost Isles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;. The consumption of vaporized kaja'mite causes a range of effects, such as heightened senses, hallucinations and increased intelligence. Stopping consumption of kaja'mite leads to a marked decline in intelligence however. It's most famously responsible for having given the &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s their high intelligence and helping them evolve into masters of alchemy and engineering. They consider it to be the most valuable ore in existence, and by goblin law, all kaja'mite belongs to goblins. The mineral is used in the creation of an intelligence-boosting drink, &lt;a href=\"%3AKaja%27Cola\"&gt;:Kaja'Cola&lt;/a&gt;, and in the creation of tools with the marketing slogan \"Kaja'mite: accept no substitutes!\"\nHistory.\nIn ancient times, the keeper &lt;a href=\"Mimiron\"&gt;Mimiron&lt;/a&gt; had discovered kaja'mite and, attempting to determine its properties, he experimented on various races. He found that the ore was extremely potent and that it increased the intellect of his subjects. One of these subjects was a small primitive race that roamed around the forests near &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt;. By consuming kaja'mite, they were transformed into a new, highly intelligent race known as the &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s. However, when the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt; happened thousands of years after the goblins' creation, they were cut from the supply of the ore. In just a few short generations, most changes and boosts to their intelligence vanished. The goblins then took refuge on the isle of &lt;a href=\"Kezan\"&gt;Kezan&lt;/a&gt; and they had already forgotten the influence kaja'mite once had on their society.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari troll&lt;/a&gt;s use kaja'mite for their rituals. Early in their history, the goblins were forced to mine it by the Zandalari who came to Kezan, desiring the mineral for their complex rituals. However, its magic gave them great intelligence and the goblins overthrew the trolls one hundred years before the opening of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, however, kaja'mite supplies ran low, and as the goblins' intelligence dwindled, their inventions became increasingly unreliable. As a result, the goblins turned to mercantilism as a source of income and transformed Kezan into a profitable trading hub after years of &lt;a href=\"cartel\"&gt;cartel&lt;/a&gt; wars.\nCataclysm.\nA &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20%28playable%29\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"player%20character\"&gt;player character&lt;/a&gt; starts out owning a kaja'mite mine called &lt;a href=\"Kaja%27mine\"&gt;Kaja'mine&lt;/a&gt; with troll slaves as workers. The kaja'mite is turned into an idea-inducing beverage known as &lt;a href=\"Kaja%27Cola\"&gt;Kaja'Cola&lt;/a&gt;.\nA kaja'mite mine is located on the &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Isles\"&gt;Lost Isles&lt;/a&gt; and is mined by a group of intelligent monkeys. Some of the monkeys have been enslaved by &lt;a href=\"Pygmy\"&gt;pygmies&lt;/a&gt;. Later, &lt;a href=\"Jastor%20Gallywix\"&gt;Jastor Gallywix&lt;/a&gt; enslaves his own &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Cartel\"&gt;Bilgewater Cartel&lt;/a&gt; to mine the kaja'mite on the isles before he is stopped by the Horde and goblin player.\nAfter the goblins reach &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt;, Kaja'mite is no longer a plot point. Although the lack of mention of Kaja'mite after the goblin starting experience could illustrate the short supply status of the substance.\nBefore the Storm.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20Campaign\"&gt;Argus Campaign&lt;/a&gt;, during a conversation between &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas\"&gt;Sylvanas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jastor%20Gallywix\"&gt;Jastor Gallywix&lt;/a&gt;, the warchief told the goblin leader that she was aware there was no more kaja'mite.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nWhen the goblins of the Bilgewater Cartel first arrived on &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;, they got word of the Zandalari's old kaja'mite quarry at &lt;a href=\"Gorilla%20Gorge\"&gt;Gorilla Gorge&lt;/a&gt; near the &lt;a href=\"Village%20in%20the%20Vines\"&gt;Village in the Vines&lt;/a&gt; and immediately made their way to it. The Zandalari stopped mining kaja'mite at the quarry because of intelligent &lt;a href=\"gorilla\"&gt;gorilla&lt;/a&gt;s, a result of the kaja'mite.\nIn the RPG.\nKaja'mite is a strange ore with magical powers that is named after &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Kajaro\"&gt;Mount Kajaro&lt;/a&gt;. The goblin's capital city of &lt;a href=\"Undermine\"&gt;Undermine&lt;/a&gt; was likely declared so because it was the mine that contained the vital kaja'mite. The goblins searched fruitlessly for more deposits of kaja'mite all over the world for thousands of years. Goblin intelligence peaked about 500 years before the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, and has been declining ever since."}

During a golden age which lasted for millennia, the &lt;a href=\"empire\"&gt;empire&lt;/a&gt; was ruled by the beautiful and intelligent &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt;, one of the most remarkable and powerful rulers ever to hold sway in &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, and in whose honor the kaldorei capital city of \"&lt;a href=\"Zin-Azshari\"&gt;Zin-Azshari&lt;/a&gt;\" (meaning \"The Glory of Azshara\") was named. Incidentally, kaldorei society was highly class-based, with the &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; ruling from the very top of the social ladder.\nThe empire thrived and prospered uncontested for thousands of years until the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; when a civil war erupted between Queen Azshara and her Highborne (who were attempting to summon the demon lord &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; into the world) and the &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Resistance\"&gt;Kaldorei Resistance&lt;/a&gt; (who wished to prevent this). Ultimately, the Resistance succeeded in its goal but in doing so caused the collapse of the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; which, in turn, triggered the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, a cataclysmic event which not only tore the empire apart, but also the continent itself. In its wake, nothing remained of the once mighty Kaldorei Empire, the surviving night elves going on to form the nation of &lt;a href=\"Darnassus%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;, while Queen Azshara and her Highborne, having become the first &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;, began a long stage of plotting and rebuilding under the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt;, poised to one day make a return.\nAt its peak, the Kaldorei Empire was the largest nation that Azeroth has ever seen, with the exception of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Empire\"&gt;Black Empire&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt;, which preceded it.\nRegional leaders in the night elf empire subordinate to the Queen were styled as princes/princesses (though any actual relation to Azshara is unknown), such as Princess &lt;a href=\"Aszune\"&gt;Aszune&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Tortheldrin\"&gt;Prince Tortheldrin&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Eldre%27Thalas\"&gt;Eldre'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Farondis\"&gt;Prince Farondis&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Azsuna\"&gt;Azsuna&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Toreth\"&gt;Prince Toreth&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Loreth%27Aran\"&gt;Loreth'Aran&lt;/a&gt;, and the ruling princes and princesses in &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt;, although by the time of the War of the Ancients the city was led by &lt;a href=\"Elisande\"&gt;Elisande&lt;/a&gt; who had the title of 'Grand Magistrix' instead. Naga and satyr continue this trend, though these might be self-styled.\nHistory.\nThe Well of Eternity and the rise of the night elves.\nAround 15,000 years before the events surrounding the first opening of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Kalimdor\"&gt;Ancient Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; was dominated by the &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; race. Many different variations of trolls existed, each with their own attributes and differing appearances. Most reclusive of all trolls, however, were the so-called &lt;a href=\"dark%20troll\"&gt;dark troll&lt;/a&gt;s, who lived underground and only ventured out during the dark of the night. These nocturnal tendencies led to a change in these trolls; their skin became blue-hued and greyish. Separate from the other, thriving, troll nations, the dark trolls eventually settled in the very center of Kalimdor, having discovered the mesmerizing power that was the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;.\nOver time, the dark trolls underwent dramatic changes as a result of their constant proximity to the well, resulting in a greatly heightened intelligence and new, more sleek, forms. With these new physical changes also came cultural and spiritual ones. They abandoned many of their old customs, such as language, in favor of developing their own, more refined versions. Additionally, they began to worship a new deity - &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;, the moon goddess - who the dark trolls believed had a direct connection to the Well of Eternity. Their language was also further influenced by the discovery of &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; artifacts in the well's vicinity (as well through communion with Elune) and it was through this that they learned the name of the continent on which they lived: Kalimdor, or \"Land of Eternal Starlight\". Using their newfound language, and in light of the great changes which had occurred with them, the 'dark trolls' now gave themselves the new name of \"kaldorei\", or &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;, meaning \"Children of the Stars\".\nEventually, the night elves also came in contact with many of the nature spirits in the region, most notably the demigod &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;, who saw such potential in the fledgling race that he began to teach them about the natural world, hoping that they may too become caretakers of it. Now a thriving society in central Kalimdor, with their capital \"Elun'dris\" (meaning \"Eye of Elune\") on the banks of the Well of Eternity itself, the kaldorei began to further explore the depths of the well, and were subsequently introduced to &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; and sorcery. Before long, many night elves had become proficient sorcerers, wielding the power obtained from the well to drive the burgeoning nation onward. New temples, cities, and infrastructure such as roads were also created in this era, serving further to advance kaldorei society and power.\nThe kaldorei started their rise to power by defeating the nearby troll tribes. Against their enemies, the kaldorei used overwhelming military power, their armies supported by Elune's blessings. The night elves' greatest soldiers were bestowed the goddess' fury through dangerous rituals, and these Night Warriors secured Kalimdor for the empire. The night elves ended up subjugating some of the people they conquered, such as nascent &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s, to use them as slave labor, but also came to conflict against the &lt;a href=\"Earthen\"&gt;early&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt;. The line of &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Ravencrest\"&gt;Ravencrest&lt;/a&gt; rose to prominence during that time, the military power of &lt;a href=\"Black%20Rook%20Hold\"&gt;Black Rook Hold&lt;/a&gt; extending over most of the realm.\nDuring this period of prosperity, a new leader emerged among the kaldorei. Ascending to the throne, the ambitious and deeply beloved &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt; now set the Kaldorei Empire on the path to true greatness, as well as great destruction.\nThe age of Azshara.\nBeautiful beyond compare, charismatic, young yet wise beyond her years, Azshara embodied the most prized aspects among the kaldorei people. She was proficient in sorcery and constructed &lt;a href=\"Azshara%27s%20Palace\"&gt;a large palace&lt;/a&gt; in the night elves' capital city where she and her closest courtiers (known as the \"quel'dorei\" or &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt;) resided. Usually sorcerous in some manner, the Highborne served many different roles in service to the Queen, from advisors such as &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Xavius\"&gt;Lord Xavius&lt;/a&gt;, to handmaidens like &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Vashj\"&gt;Lady Vashj&lt;/a&gt;. All, however, were part of the highest social strata of kaldorei society and possessed a distinct belief in their self-superiority over the 'lower-born' majority of night elves. This did not impress the other kaldorei who, in turn, developed an ever-present animosity for the egotistic Highborne. Significantly, this resentment did not extend to the Queen herself, who was looked upon with such adoration by the populace that the kaldorei capital was renamed \"&lt;a href=\"Zin-Azshari\"&gt;Zin-Azshari&lt;/a&gt;\" or \"The Glory of Azshara\", in her honor.\nUnder the rule of Queen Azshara, the night elf nation exploded into a sprawling empire resplendent with impressive architecture, great cities, and ornate temples. Vast, luminescent highways limned by the silver light of Elune herself stretched across the continent, connecting all of civilization together. The empire saw the creation of such marvelous wonders that &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; would never see its like again, even in the modern age. Expeditionary forces, too, would be sent to explore and spread the empire's borders, bringing back tales of far-away lands and races, such as &lt;a href=\"dragons\"&gt;dragons&lt;/a&gt;, and returning with samples of foreign flora and fauna. The Queen herself personally oversaw the construction of a grand new temple to Elune, a sprawling expanse of gem-encrusted bridges and effervescent lakes at the western edge of Kalimdor. Upon its completion, she named the mesmerizing grounds \"&lt;a href=\"Lathar%27Lazal\"&gt;Lathar'Lazal&lt;/a&gt;\", or \"Seat of the Sky\". Azshara now lorded over more territory than any other single ruler in history, eclipsing even such previous conquerors as the &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; Thunder King, &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen\"&gt;Lei Shen&lt;/a&gt;. One area, however, which the Queen deliberately avoided was &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, publicly to honor the night elves' previous pacts with the forests, but in truth due to a deep disgust and caution that Azshara harbored for the ancient magics which permeated Hyjal. As a result, it became one of the few areas of the continent left wholly untouched by the empire.\nAs the Kaldorei Empire continued to expand, Cenarius became increasingly disturbed by what he saw as an abandonment of the ways of nature in favor of the appeals of magic and sorcery, as well as the endless hubris and arrogance of the Highborne. As their nation's power grew, the kaldorei also severed diplomatic ties with the other races of the continent, spurred on by their Queen's dogged commitment to ideas of racial purity and kaldorei superiority. These beliefs ultimately served to create an atmosphere of xenophobia in the psyche of the night elves, convinced that they were inherently better than the lesser, more primitive races.\nThe only other race which posed enough of a threat (albeit small) to draw the attention of the empire were the aggressive, and openly hostile, troll nations. Small, separate conflicts subsequently broke out between the two races, but the trolls were consistently unable to stand against the kaldorei mastery of the arcane and were routed as a result. Undisturbed by the trolls' rabid battle lust, and having no desire to control their remaining lands, Queen Azshara ultimately negotiated a deal with the &lt;a href=\"Zandalar%20tribe\"&gt;Zandalar tribe&lt;/a&gt; of trolls, the unifying force between all the tribes. In return for a halt to all troll incursions and hostilities against kaldorei territory, the trolls would \u2014 by Azshara's grace \u2014 be allowed to remain in possession of their sacred Zandalar Mountain, south of the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;. This humiliating agreement which the trolls had no choice but to acquiesce to led to great resentment of night elves (and elves in general) among the troll race.\nHaving dealt with all external threats, Queen Azshara began to become more detached from the rest of the kingdom, spending more and more time inside the palace walls. Gradually, she became obsessed with the potential of the Well of Eternity; a potential, she believed, that the kaldorei had only scratched the surface of. Azshara believed that if they should unlock the full power of the Well, the Kaldorei Empire could ascend to new and previously unimagined heights of greatness. Thus she, and the Highborne, began delving into the Well's mysteries, experimenting with its untold power. These reckless experiments, however, sent bolts of magic shooting through the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;. It was not long until more malevolent forces took notice, in the form of the fallen-titan &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. After eons of searching, Sargeras had finally discovered the location of Azeroth, and with it, its world soul.\nWar of the Ancients.\nAround 10,000 years before the events of the Dark Portal, unbeknownst to the rest of the kaldorei, their queen and the Highborne had been contacted by a mysterious entity, not from their world. Queen Azshara and her followers eagerly began to communicate with this entity, who desired a massive gateway to be opened using the Well of Eternity itself, so that it may come to Azeroth. The entity, &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, intentionally played on the night elves' arrogance and hubris, having first contacted the Queen's chief advisor, the cunning &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Xavius\"&gt;Lord Xavius&lt;/a&gt;, who immediately brought it to the attention of Azshara. Queen Azshara was utterly enthralled by what she saw as Sargeras' glorious perfection. So enamored was she, that she immediately ordered the Highborne to make preparations to summon Sargeras and the Burning Legion. The Queen intended to rule at the demon lord's side in a paradise where all she considered impure \u2014 including her own, non-Highborne, people \u2014 was purged. As the Highborne began their summoning, many kaldorei had gathered outside the royal palace, curious and frightened about the now-raging currents of the Well of Eternity, and wanting to receive guidance from their revered and beloved monarch. What they received, however, as the gates swung open, were waves upon waves of &lt;a href=\"demons\"&gt;demons&lt;/a&gt; who swept across the grounds, slaughtering any they came across. Thus began the War of the Ancients, a conflict which would, quite literally, shape the face of the world and ultimately tear the mighty Kaldorei Empire asunder.\nMeanwhile, a promising young night elf called &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, who had been training with the demigod Cenarius to one day become the first mortal &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt; had become aware of something very wrong occurring in &lt;a href=\"Zin-Azshari\"&gt;Zin-Azshari&lt;/a&gt;, even before the actual summoning began. Following the commencement of the ritual, countless demons began to spread out from the Well of Eternity, storming across the empire and laying waste to forests, cities, and all else which they came across. A night elf resistance movement was subsequently formed to halt this threat. Although aware of the Highborne's treachery, all those surviving kaldorei fighting the demons refused to believe that their Queen had any direct part in it. They convinced themselves that she was, at the very least, their prisoner, and at worst being totally misled by her duplicitous counselors. Thus, the resistance felt that they were not only fighting to save their way of life, but also to save their exalted leader, unaware of the fact that Azshara was, herself, the chief instigator of these events.\nAmong the ranks of the resistance were three young night elves: Malfurion, his sorcerer brother, &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, and their childhood friend and priestess-in-training, &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;. Led by kaldorei general Lord &lt;a href=\"Kur%27talos%20Ravencrest\"&gt;Kur'talos Ravencrest&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Ravencrest\"&gt;House of Ravencrest&lt;/a&gt;, the resistance initially suffered resounding defeats at the hands of the seemingly-endless demonic legions. It was not until Malfurion made the daring move of entering the druidic &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; and using his powers to slay Lord Xavius, that the kaldorei's fortunes began to change. Following more minor successes, some brought about by Illidan, who had become a skilled sorcerer, and Tyrande, who was a member of the &lt;a href=\"Sisterhood%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Sisterhood of Elune&lt;/a&gt;, a militant order of all-female warrior priestesses, the resistance even succeeded in gaining the initiative. However, they were simply unable to overcome the Legion's impossible numbers. Many of the Highborne had also been turned into a new type of demon, the &lt;a href=\"satyr\"&gt;satyr&lt;/a&gt;, which bolstered the demons' ranks. At the desperate request of Malfurion, Cenarius agreed to rally Kalimdor's mighty &lt;a href=\"Wild%20God\"&gt;Wild God&lt;/a&gt;s against the Legion, but warned that it would take considerable time. Meanwhile, also at the night elf's request, the &lt;a href=\"Dragonflights\"&gt;Dragonflights&lt;/a&gt; resigned to join the fray in their duty to defend Azeroth. At the suggestion of the Earth-Warder, &lt;a href=\"Neltharion\"&gt;Neltharion&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt; agreed that the best way to combat the demons would be to collectively infuse a large portion of their powers in an artifact known as the 'Dragon Soul'. Having done this, however, Neltharion (to be known ever after as Deathwing) betrayed the other dragons at the behest of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt;, taking the Dragon Soul for himself and using it to attack all in his vicinity; dragon, night elf, and demon alike. Although Deathwing was forced to retreat, the event marked a terrible blow for those resisting the demonic invasion.\nThe fall of Zin-Azshari and the sundering of the world.\nSoon after, Illidan, having changed sides in the conflict, managed to steal Deathwing's artifact (now also known as the 'Demon Soul'), delivering it to Azshara and the Highborne who immediately used it to hasten the summoning of Sargeras himself. As the resistance began to lose more and more ground, a new leader rose among them (following Lord Ravencrest's assassination). &lt;a href=\"Jarod%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Jarod Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; was young, intelligent, and an excellent strategist. Under his encouragement, the resistance expanded to include many of Azeroth's other races, such as &lt;a href=\"earthen\"&gt;earthen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"furbolgs\"&gt;furbolgs&lt;/a&gt;, (many of whom had been regarded with disgust in previous times) which significantly aided the night elves' now diminished forces. This was coupled with a large defection among the Highborne, led by &lt;a href=\"Dath%27Remar%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Dath'Remar Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;, who refused to help Azshara advance her megalomaniac plans any longer, and pledged themselves to the resistance instead. It was at this time that the Wild Gods, now roused, also arrived to lend their aid. With a revitalized and powerful force, Commander Jarod Shadowsong now prepared to launch a massive, desperate assault on Zin-Azshari itself, where Sargeras' summoning was nearing completion.\nCountless individuals fell on both sides in one of the bloodiest engagements in history. Meanwhile, having learned that the Well of Eternity itself was being turned into a massive portal, Malfurion and his companions, now joined once more by Illidan who claimed his previous allegiance to have been a ruse, succeeded in reclaiming the Demon Soul from the city and used it to launch a devastating attack on the demon and Highborne forces. With their spellwork now unraveled, the Well of Eternity destabilized and the portal collapsed, sucking many of the demons and their lord back through. The earth itself began to shake as the unstable energies emanating from the well started to cause the ground to tear apart. With the surviving night elves fleeing to the safety of Mount Hyjal, the Well, unable to endure any more abuse, finally collapsed, triggering an implosion so large that it tore Kalimdor apart, destroying most of its landmass and leaving only the &lt;a href=\"Maelstrom\"&gt;Maelstrom&lt;/a&gt; where once there was the majestic kaldorei capital. When the earthquakes and destruction had ceased, the surviving kaldorei emerged to discover that over 80% of Azeroth's landmass had disappeared in what became known as \"The Great Sundering\". Nothing remained of, what once was, the Kaldorei Empire.\nLegacy.\nAt the height of its power, the Kaldorei Empire was one of the largest and most powerful the world has seen. Its cultural, technological, military, and magical advancements surpassed almost all others, before or since. Even following the catastrophe that was the Sundering, echoes of the once mighty nation can be seen across Azeroth in the form of ancient and neglected ruins.\nFuture of the kaldorei.\nWith the conclusion of the War of the Ancients, the largest group of surviving night elves founded a new nation built upon a worship of nature, and led by two of the war's greatest heroes: Malfurion Stormrage and Tyrande Whisperwind. Unlike the empire which preceded it, this new country (called &lt;a href=\"Darnassus%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;) institutionally shunned the arcane arts, blaming them for the near-destruction of the world and forbidding their use. As a result, many of the surviving Highborne were exiled when they refused accept this law. They ventured far to the east to the newly-formed continent of the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;. After much wandering, and a dramatic change in appearance due to a disconnection from the Well of Eternity's power, these quel'dorei, now calling themselves &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt;, eventually founded the kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;. This new nation, unlike Darnassus, ultimately ended up sharing many similarities with the Kaldorei Empire of ages past. This included an overbearing reliance on magic, which they received from their own, smaller Well of Eternity, &lt;a href=\"The%20Sunwell\"&gt;the Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;.\nAzshara.\nAzshara, and those who had followed her to the end, were looked back on by subsequent night elves as being evil and arrogant traitors who had almost brought about the end of the world. Unknown to the survivors, however, the Queen and her followers had not perished in the ruinous events of the Sundering. As her city sank into the depths of a new ocean, Azshara was offered a proposition from an unlikely source. The &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt; promised her that, in exchange for her future service, they would not only save her and her followers from drowning, but also transform them into more than they ever were. Thus, Azshara and her remaining followers became the first of the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;, and began the reconstruction of a &lt;a href=\"Nazjatar%20Empire\"&gt;new empire&lt;/a&gt; under the waves of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt;, Azshara herself now ruling as Empress of the Naga from her sunken capital of &lt;a href=\"Nazjatar\"&gt;Nazjatar&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Highborne.\nAlthough many &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; perished during the war, became naga during The Sundering, or were exiled to the Eastern Kingdoms following the foundation of Darnassus, some still managed to survive in various ruins across the world. Eventually, thousands of years later, they are beginning to make a revival in night elf society. Having become more accepting to the use of magic once again, Darnassus has begun to allow many Highborne to return to their society, resulting in a surge in new night elf mages; something which had been rarely seen since the fall of the Kaldorei Empire, over 10,000 years before.\nThe nightborne.\nUnknown to the majority of surviving night elves, the city of &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt; survived the Sundering due to the efforts of its mage leaders, led by the Highborne &lt;a href=\"Elisande\"&gt;Elisande&lt;/a&gt;. These Highborne reluctantly rejected Queen Azshara's allegiance with Sargeras and succeeded in preventing a demonic invasion of Suramar by sealing an inter-dimensional portal that was opened in the city's temple of Elune using the &lt;a href=\"Pillars%20of%20Creation\"&gt;Pillars of Creation&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing this, they sealed the remainder of the city in an impenetrable magical barrier and would continue on living thinking that the rest of the world had been lost to the demons. For 10,000 years, they would continue to further develop their mastery of the arcane, placing emphasis on discipline and control, and utilizing the power of their own arcane font, the &lt;a href=\"Nightwell\"&gt;Nightwell&lt;/a&gt;. They would, significantly, find themselves separated from nature. This would lead to an unorthodox corruption in their power source that would ultimately change their physical appearance. These changed kaldorei, known as the &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt; (due to their distinctive black-grey skin) became a new variation of the night elf race. The nightborne, and Suramar, were only rediscovered when events precipitating the &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third coming of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; triggered the collapse of their protective barrier, soon followed by a brutal occupation by forces of the Legion. A nightborne resistance has subsequently emerged and works to free the city and its people, as well as to enact justice for what they consider to be an affront to all they have stood for, fought for, and endured for the last ten millennia.\nReligion.\nThe Kaldorei Empire was one which possessed a deep devotion to religion, and religious rituals. Their goddess, &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;, was seen as the personal matron of the kaldorei, and was revered and honored through the construction of vast and elaborate temples and shrines across the empire. Additionally, within kaldorei society, those who served the goddess, most notably the priestesses of the &lt;a href=\"Sisterhood%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Sisterhood of Elune&lt;/a&gt;, were deeply respected and elevated to a position of importance above many others.\nAlthough not worshiped in the same manner as Elune, the kaldorei also held a deep respect and devotion for the forces of nature, most significantly the &lt;a href=\"Wild%20God\"&gt;Wild God&lt;/a&gt;s and other guardians of the world such as the demigod &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;. While never a full religion, nature worship remained prevalent in kaldorei society well into the waning days of the empire. This form of nature worship would ultimately be vigorously adopted by the empire's immediate successor, in Darnassus, encouraged by the &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAn almost universal cult of personality also developed around the revered Queen Azshara throughout her long reign. While not quite deified, Azshara was praised and adored to such an extent that it bordered on treating her as a divine. It is perhaps accurate to say that the individual citizen of the Kaldorei Empire had a deeper personal connection and love for their queen than they ever did for any particular deity."}
